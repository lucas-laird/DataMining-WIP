My husband told me not to post a review about how incredibly delicious it was because then everyone in town will be eating there and it will get too crowded.
Oh well, I'm writing the review anyways! 
Chef Carlos Hernandez never dissapoints. He makes the juiciest tastiest burgers ever!
Even the bun is perfection, it doesn't fall apart when loaded up with yummy toppings. The French fries are hot, and crisp with a light beer batter coating, also perfection.
Pastas are good, the mussles are num num num.
Now about last nights Valentines Dinner.
It was a wine pairing and Chef Carlo NAILED it! Each wine was the perfect compliment to each course.
We started with lobster bisque cappuccino. Served in a demitasse cup with a frothy head, it was about the best I've ever had. Smooth, rich and creamy with an intense lobster flavor, delicious.
The salad was arrugula with pear slices, small blue cheese crumbles, and walnuts with a very light dressing. Soooo good.
Our main course was filet mignon, topped with lobster tail, atop a bed of red bell pepper mashed potatoes with fingerling carrot and green been accompianments. 
Everything was outstanding. Tender, flavorful meats, creamy mashers, all dente veggies, ooohhh lala.
Dessert was a hot chocolate molten cake topped with berries. Ooozing with chocolaty goodness. Absolutely Devine. We also had the vanilla raspberry pannecota, it was wonderful.
 To top it off, Chef Carlo greeted us when we arrived, and again took time at the end to come out and say thanks.
Do your self a favor, and check this place out. 
The also do catering for special events. 
The only downside is occasionally they have a lesser experienced person serving tables.",i93CKTXA-klVGvTt5wGcsg,1,0,5,5UsNAaTWfR73UGWIZrIQVQ

Longtime culinary star, Chef Carlos, cooks and meets and greets and just generally does lots correctly.  His eatery is nestled inside Charlie's Saloon. But fear not, it's worth writing about...obviously. There were scores of items on the menu calling my name, all priced right, but alas the pesto burger (perfect bun, fresh mozz slices..etc.) with proper fries was the winner. Starter salad was nearly perfect too. Net-net, damn tasty lunch, charming service, and free WiFi to boot. Next time...dessert.",g1xkuGkYJei-giycftr0tg,2,1,5,DMA1atS-bfe8ZycvfEZQ2g

fried goat cheese cake with balsamic glaze over top, say no more, this is on my top 10 food items list. and lets just say most of them are at 5 star restaurants but this definitely made the list! perfect breading, good quality goat cheese, and perfect amount of glaze and its not too overbearing in anyway.

we had 2 wraps with fries as well and those were both good size, with good flavors. fries cooked perfect with good seasoning and not overly salty. had a steak the first visit and not exactly a place i would expect a good steak but thats exactly what i got with good flavoring and at a great price point. 

white table cloth restaurant that is connected with a bar with gaming and its in the chevron station parking lot. too funny. this place is right down the st from my house which makes it convenient but hard to stay healthy with fried goat cheese. what a find from my girlfriend. thank you to the other yelpers for this find!",BuyhJjFRLIXhp6WrTJfTUQ,2,1,5,mW-gsM67YKob_KkoBNIr2w

The food at Carlos' is BEYOND excellent. The mozarella antipasta/caprese salad is delish. He makes the cheese himself !
The fettuccine has great flavor, loved the sausage in it. 
Lobster bisque isnt to be missed. 
Chicken cordon bleu is excellent  
the chefs dessert is pretty good. If you take the crunchy garnish/strawberry/chocolate drizzle/and some ice cream together in one bite it tastes like a bowl of cereal lol 

The service is divine. Iris reminds me of myself. Efficient, crowd pleaser, and just a nice hardworking chick. Love you Iris! You're a perfect fit for Carlos' and I wish nothing but the best for you. 

Chef Carlos is a great guy. Any business that closes at 9 where the chef takes an hour out of his time to speak to his guests is something you dont see anymore. You have a new follower/believer/foodie fanatic   :P

I am sorry they were closed on Tuesday. I would have loved to hit you up for a third time on my short 6 day visit. 

Atmosphere is relaxing (for Vegas especially). Its a great getaway from the bright gaudy lights, shiny floors, brass finishes.  It reminded me of my trip to Italy.  It reminded me to slow down, savor every bite.  Food here is to be enjoyed. It's not a place to go, put something in your system for energy and go. Being next to Spectators bar was okay, it doesnt say carlos. But if he served food from  a dump truck, i think i would still eat it.",m2IiUYm8HKLkgYiuxuq1Iw,1,1,5,6wMqcgXdQ42A6lEXIPLLew

Instead, we found a real treasure.  Carlos, himself, greeted us at our table and from there it just kept getting better.

Fresh made, to order, nacho chips with fresh pico, real cheese, and guacamole were awesome.  Beer battered onion rings were as good or better than any in the valley.

Then the burgers.  The special burger for the day was the guacamole burger which made me raise an eyebrow but wow.  Angus beef on rolls Carlos said he has shipped from a bakery in Chicago.  The blend of the carmelized onions, pepperjack cheese, lettuce and tomato was so right, it was the first time I didn't need mustard, pickle nor ketchup.  Then, the handcut fries are just that perfect crunch on the outside and puffy lightness in the middle.

There are so many things on the menu we want to try, we'll be back.... a LOT.

609645,2012-07-17,0,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"We wanted to try someplace different remembered Carlo's kitchen from Yelp reviews and the Las Vegas Weekly.  We arrived on a Saturday about 6 pm and it was empty, scary , too late to run someone already noticed us.  We sat down and the waitress was bubbly and nice .  
         I had read the yelp reviews and already knew the chicken nachos was the way to go for apps  and I'm glad we got it , The corn chips were fried to order and very hot and crisp, the chicken was shredded and cooked in some kind of sauce which made it very tasty and moist not dried out like I thought when I first saw it .  
       For my entree I had one of the specials  wienerschizel , sauteed speazel , beer gravy and red cabbage all for  8.99  ,What!!!   The cutlet's were nicely breaded and cooked perfectly. Spaezle was solid as was the gravy! Everything on the plate was tasty.   
         For dessert we had the chef indulgence for one that wife and I shared , big mistake we should have gotten the bigger size for 2 . Anyway live and learn won't make that mistake again. 
        The dessert platter had a cheesecake spring roll very creative and good, It also had a banana foster cake like square, brownie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
       Chef Carlo's came out a couple of times through out our meal to seem how we liked it which was nice. Just by talking to him you could tell he has passion for his food and by the taste of his food you know he has the skills!!!  We will be back !!!",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,2,1,4,sO0mVCOxm_UX2ebYrzS6XA
644018,2014-08-21,0,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"I always go between two and three stars but the category of ""meh"" just seems to fit especially in light of the fact that I have wanted to try this place for some time based on other yelpers and was underwhelmed by the experience.

We sat there for a few minutes and then realized that it was likely no one would help us unless we flagged them down so my friend went and told the bar tender (the dining area is seperate from the bar) that we were there. 

A nice older lady helped us. The only reason I note that she is older is that she clearly had a hard time hearing our orders, and due to her difficulty she missed that my friend ordered a ""chicken ceasar salad"" and only heard the ceasar salad part... when she brought out his order and it was pointed out to her she said she could get the chicken but it would take awhile. 

As to the food - Carlos came out and greeted us. I notified him that we had not been there before and asked for recommendations. He said that the specials of the day were always good. Today it was chicken parmagian and a greek feta burger, he touted that the burger was wonderful and clearly the way to go. He described the 85/15 fat percentage of the angus beef and the brioche bun. Taking his recommendation this is what I ordered - medium rare. 

The burger was somewhere in between a medium rare and a medium. It was quite large and came with french fries. The cost was $10.99, a little hefty for a burger from a bar and not a ""burger bar"". The bun was great, buttery and did not become soggy. It stood up well to the burger. The patty was what you would expect for homemade. However, the toppings weren't what I thought I just didn't truly get the mediterranean flavor profile I was expecting. There seemed to be a lot of wilted greens, what I believe was spinach, and the flavor of the greens overpowered the delicate flavor of feta. The french fries were frozen but they were crispy and fine, more like pub fries, nothing outstanding but nothing bad either. I ordered a side of ranch for the fries - the ranch was house made although it had an odd flavor I can't even describe it, clearly it was some house seasoning that I am not used to in ranch. And my big pet peeve they didn't tell us and they charged $.50 for ranch. I could see charging for ranch or other dressing if a patron was abusing it, but with the up charge for burgers etc. and they can' t fork out a few pennies for a side of ranch is just unacceptable to me and then if you are going to charge at least have the decency to notify me ahead of time. I know  you are saying it's just 50 cents, but truly it is the principle of the matter to me.

Also, there was one other couple that walked in shortly after us but we put our order in first. We arrived at 12:10, put our order in around 12:20 and it took about half an hour for our food. For fresh cooked, and the fact that Carlos was probably the only one in the kitchen, I understand but I only note this as if you are on your lunch hour and looking for a quick bite based on service and the length to get your food this might not be your best bet. 

Another friend got the nachos. I had one. It was good, chips fried from flour tortillas. However, even thought it was the appetizer size it was a lot smaller than I had anticipated and my friend was not full upon leaving.

On the upside they had fresh brewed ice tea ($2.00) but I didn't get that many refills as due to the lack of service I had to flag someone down for a refill and then later she came back once to refill again. Yes three teas may be plenty for some, but they were smaller glasses which were filled with ice (which is fine) but servers should be attentive to empty drink glasses to provide prompt refills, especially when there are only two tables.

 I am not one of those people that absolutely avoid all smoke but I did find that it detracted from the dining experience.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,cbVekRRecmGYVaxy2XLltw

The younger members of our group savored various burgers, including the night's cordon blue burger.  Great fresh fries; they did not even blink at the request for ranch dressing.  

Hubby and I were in awe:  he with pasta, shrimp and spicy sausage; me with the veggie tower. And the amazing grilled romaine salad.  Wow and yum!  

Enjoyed meeting Carlos as he came around to check on diners.  Learned this location had only been open a week or so.

Kudos to Iris who not only served us thoroughly and thoughtfully, but snapped a photo for us, to commemorate the celebratory family night.

769752,2013-04-22,0,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,This place is well hidden gem on the west side of town.  The exterior is misleading but once you walk in and see the white tablecloths you know your in for a great meal.  I've eaten here twice - had the pork chops and the Jack Daniels salmon.  Both were excellent.  Chef Carlos ventured out of the kitchen to visit both times to check on our meals which always impresses me.  The prices are very reasonable for these nicely prepared meals.  The chocolate lava cake is well worth the 5.95 price and Iris was nice enough to serve with a second plate and setting so that we could share it.

At that point the chef came out and explained the meal we were ordering how he prepared it, etc. (amazing explanations on the menu items). I ordered the chicken sandwich which sounds boring, but it was anything but, the sauce was amazing (no sysco premade stuff), and perfectly cooked to where it was moist (not over fried like at hooters).

1352451,2014-05-02,6,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"Came here for lunch on a thursday afternoon with some friends. Randomly came across this location upon yelp to try new places. 

Easy to find location located right next to the Chevron gas station on the SE corner of Flamingo & Durango. 

Greeted and seated very fast. (though it was quite empty - one other customer at the restaurant. 

After we were served our waters, the waitress left and came back later to tell us the specials right before taking our order. (little out of order i think? don't people usually mention the specials when you get the menu?)

I had gotten one of the specials for today. 

Mixed Grill BBQ Pork Chop, Andouille Sausage, and a side of cole slaw and waffle cut sweet potato fries - $12.99 - i guess i was expecting it to be a bit bigger in portion size. Especially in comparison to the Chef C Teaser my friend got (refer to pictures). BBQ Pork Chop was grilled and glazed with a BBQ sauce. Size was relatively small. Maybe the size of my palm, maybe slightly smaller. Sausage was two pieces, fairly good, in size? together, maybe like 6"" in length (lol . . . i know what some of you may be thinking . . . ! ! ) Flavor wise, both were pretty good. The pork chop was cooked well and was juicy. Sausage was a bit ""burnt"" to a way were the casing was black but flavor was good. The cole slaw (wasnt a preference in terms of salad anyway) was ok. A little bitter, not sure what types of cabbage or w/e the chef was using. The waffle cut sweet potato fries were fresh and super crispy. Almost can say that was the best part of the dish. Lol which means probably wont get this again XD 

Chicken Wings - (Mild/Medium/Chef's Special Hot Sauce) served with French Fries and Ranch/Bleu Cheese Dressing - $8.99- Decent portion for an appetizer. Variety of wings and drumsticks. The chicken wings were cooked perfectly. Juicy meat. Easy to eat and flavored well. 

Chef ""C"" Teaser - Chicken fingers, chicken wings, onion rings, pepper jack shots, mac & cheese bites, french fries, celery & carrots, ranch/bleu cheese) - $14.99 - despite the higher price for an appetizer, this dish is no joke ! SO MUCH FOOD ! Friend ordered this as a entree, could barely eat half even with some help from my other friend and I. The pepper jack shots were light, slightly spicy. Shaped like hush puppies. One of my favorite items on this plate. Wings were the same as the chicken wings listed above. Fries were thickly cut. In between normal fries and maybe steak fries. Best bang for the buck ! great for sharing or eating as an entree between two people ! 

Overall, good experience. Chef Carlos came out to greet us (which is surprising, you rarely ever see that much anymore). Great service.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,6,7,3,07chXgrjJ4J_1uuzIq7ocw
1404927,2013-10-18,0,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"My wife and I went into the former Putters now Spectators for lunch yesterday. The prior kitchen operator was OK for bar food. We had noticed that he (Carlos) had moved from Charlies months ago. I'm always a little Leary when there is a bio of the cook in the menu. Really? Just a little tacky.

We started out in the bar where the wife played $40 and had a coke, I had a beer and did not gamble. The place was empty except for the usual cast of bar flies speaking of past glories. The bartender (forget her name. Long blonde hair) served me a beer  (immediately returned to the 'regulars' and spoke on the bar phone extensively) $3.50 pricey for a draft Miller Lite and the server from the restaurant brought the wife her diet coke. The server knew the menu and specials. She was very prompt and attentive, sorry forgot her name also. Ordered the 'Hamburger special' in addition to the usual had spinach, mushrooms and Swiss. My wife ordered Nachos w/ shredded beef. 

We moved into the dining room very nice, clean and complete with white table cloths.
Now I understood why most items on the menu were $9.99 for lunch. After a short wait the food arrived. The burger (which I ordered medium) arrived well done with fries. It was OK, hard to mess up a burger except for being over cooked. Now the nachos were another story...Super thick/hard chips, some cheez whiz type stuff on the plate, a little (and I mean little) pica de giao (sp), a tiny drizzle of sour cream and a dab of guac on top of the (tough) shredded beef. No jalapenos, olives, re fried beans, real cheese melted on top nor salsa on the side. My wife had to ask for salsa.Terrible. (Great nachos are available at Bj's on E. Trop and Harmon or the Peppermill on the strip). It's hard to believe that a supposedly good cook cannot create a wonderful plate of nachos. (Just read his bio)

I guess the topper is that the Mrs was not even comped for her Coke after playing $40. How cheap is that. I was told that the bar and eatery were separate. Guess she should have had a shot of Jack or was told the 'rules' before ordering.

Needless to say we will not be back. The two stars are for the server, if not for her there would be no stars. Sorry.",tIjhXTwrkDJCo070eUIuhA,0,0,2,mV8b3UOcPFYYoq_9uHyQjQ

Before going I called to see if they could accommodate my gluten free requirements due to having Celiac disease.  Chef Carlos explained that due to being an actual trained chef (in other words, not just some short order cook) he was familiar with gluten free food, preparation and cross contamination concerns for someone with the disease.  We went knowing that I'd be in good hands!

The food was amazing, and as with everyone else, he came out and visited with us.  

Finding out we were in town from San Diego, with him being from San Diego originally, we had a great time sharing memories and hearing his stories and learning about his family's restaurant there that we need to make a trip to!

He went over the items in the menu with me and let me know what I could and could not eat from his menu.  The ""coulds"" definately outweighed the ""could nots"".

The experience and the food was so amazing, that we had an opportunity to plan a trip back to Las Vegas Thanksgiving Week and part of the reason we decided to go for it was so that we could drive back home on Thanksgiving Day, right after having Thanksgiving Dinner at his restaurant, which he had told us he'd be doing when we visited.

For those of you looking for catering, he also does that.  If we lived in Las Vegas, we'd probably hire him for all our parties!",dC85xfrtXt_RjU8caMnBWw,2,2,5,rv9PVgnAlGik816SZ0_stw

I've been in fancier/more expensive restaurants and rarely received personal attention from the chef!  We chose a dessert sampler plate which did not disappoint!

The appetizers, from grilled heats of romaine, with mango chutney sauce with balsamic vinegar, to fried goat cheese cakes were wonderful.

Its hard to pick any one entree over the other. There all just that good.  I settled on burger for lunch, half pound Angus burger with all the fresh toppings, that was probably the best burger I have had in years.

The building is split between a video poker bar and dining room.  We arrived mid afternoon and sat in the bar area.  After being greeted by two friendly employees, (one, a trainee), we ordered a couple Ice Teas to drink while searching over the menu.  I opted for the daily special of Talapia Fish and Chips, and the wife had their standard burger.  After placing our order, Carlos emerged and greeted us with a hearty smile and thanked us for our patronage.  After hearing about his formal chef training, I was looking forward to a tasty meal.  And Carlos delivered with perfectly battered and fried fish, a coleslaw not too tart or sweet, and perfect french fries.  The wife's burger was definitely gourmet in size and flavor.

Service was amazingly fast and consistent, Ice Tea glasses never went empty, food was made with skill and expertise, and the prices were amazing for the quality and quantity.  Carlos even checked back with us to ensure we were enjoying our meal.  That sort of personal touch is so lacking from today's industry; so glad to have experienced it again   It's also great to support local eateries that do everything so perfect!

Our server was so nice and very attentive... always re-filling our drinks and providing us with information about the best items on the menu.  We started with the chicken nachos and WOW.  So good!  
Before our entrees showed up, Carlos came out from the kitchen and chatted with us for a bit.  We learned about the kind of food he likes to cook and his future ambitions to open a restaurant focused on unique fusion foods.  
For my main course, I had the cheeseburger... I know that most of the time a cheeseburger is JUST a cheeseburger.  But, the bun on this one was toasted to perfection, toppings fresh, meat cooked just right... the fries were delicious (a little greasy though) AND the ranch is home made!  Other people in my party ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich , crispy chicken sandwich, crispy chicken wrap and the avocado burger (it was one of the daily specials).
After we ate, Carlos came out again to ask us how everything was.  We topped the meal off with creme brulee.  It was not the best I've ever had (I'm not a huge fan in the first place), but pretty good.  It actually reminded me of flan for some reason.

This is American bar fare with a true culinarian touch, including daily specials and a featured soup prepared from fresh ingredients. The night I visited, I enjoyed the best cream of broccoli soup I've ever had in a bar. It was simply prepared, with a brunoise of onions and celery as aromatics, a topping of shredded cheese, and broccoli so fresh I just had to ask if Dana Carvey was in the back choppin' broccoli. 

Our server was very sweet and thorough in explaining the menu and the nightly specials. My husband initially focussed in on the chicken wings, which have received some praise in the Weekly, but changed his mind for the chicken parmesan, one of the chef's specials. It was served with a side of linguine marinara and sauteed broccoli and carrots. I was happy to see him eat his veggies, a reflection that they were fresh and tasty. For only $8.95, this was an unbeatable deal. My vegetarian chipotle black bean burger with pepper jack cheese was exactly how I like my burgers-- lots of flavor! My meal had just enough grease to remind me that I was eating in a bar. I agree with Jadira that the fries are something special and I couldn't imagine eating here without an order of those amazing battered potatoes. My husband requested a side of ranch for dipping and I was very impressed when they served up a homemade dressing with fresh herbs. That's right, in a bar.

Typed in ""Restaurants"", ""Las Vegas"", and ""Highest Rated"" and Carlo's Kitchen popped up.

Eh, why not? Great reviews and the fan photos really helped making the final dining decision very easy.

Inside of Charlie's bar, say what? Who would have known such a stellar eatery could be found nestled inside of a typical Vegas pub? Yelpers, that's who!

No sooner did my party get sat our very attentive server came to grab our drink orders.  Glasses never empty and our palates totally satisfied we thoroughly enjoyed our dishes here at Carlos.

From succulent pork chops to perfectly seasoned fettuccine and a goat cheese fritta that will make you want thirds, you will not be disappointed.

Take away the bar aspect of this eatery and it the point has been made that the food is out of this world; lets get to my most favorite part of this dining experience.. The chef in charge of all dishes that leave the kitchen personally came out to greet our table! Not only did he come out to greet us at the beginning of our meal but he checked on our table of (7) after our feeding frenzy came to a close to follow up.

A brilliant display of customer service that I honestly thought was completely lost in this city.

Chef Carlos was very kind and made me feel very comfortable and welcomed. he explained the specials and answered all my questions regarding the food prep and sauces that came with entrees. i am a huge chicken fingers with mild buffalo sauce fan. i have a weakness for well prepared fries and onion rings. i have tried so many eateries around the USA and worldwide; only a few places know how to make real french fries with a light batter and hand dip onion rings in beer batter to coat the onions evenly without making it soggy.i started with the pinto bean soup with tortilla slivers drizzled with sour cream. OMG... it was out of this world creamy, tangy,and all the warm feelings of comfort food. next, the chicken fingers with fries came out.i asked him to make the chicken extra wet with mild sauce and, WALLAH! it was perfect! the fries were the true test of his culinary knowledge. OMG...they were seasoned just right, so crispy you can hear it with first bite. the chicken fingers were thinly pounded and so juicy and tender.  it is not dry and hard . on the contrary.. it was supple, mildly hot, and swimming in my favorite condiment: mild buffalo sauce! when i asked for extra ranch sauce for dipping, his daughter the server was happy to deliver. other places always tell me there is extra charge and watch me strangely as if no one ever asks for extra ranch ?! the onion rings are THE BEST i have ever had. trust me. i can't explain it. you just have to try it. it is lightly dipped in a beer batter but, not over fried. don't think too hard; just GO to Carlos'. he will take damn good care of your tummy!",TPbGlI0S0atAURmNl3P_sw,0,0,5,ogsk7h-Ku5ibb7PGfbDUDw

It's not an overly fancy joint located inside Spectators bar. In fact, Carlos explained to us (yes, he visited the table multiple times - more to come on that) that they used to be located inside of Charlie's Bar and had recently moved to this location. But the great thing is that the restaurant is separate from the bar and there wasn't a smokey smell in there - just a smell of amazing food.

So the service...we were greeted by Iris, a very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive server. Absolutely awesome! She told us the specials, took our drink order, and throughout our entire meal was checking to see how we were enjoying the food and most importantly, kept our beverages filled!

Now to the food, there is good food, there is bad food, then there is Carlos' food. Prior to ordering Carlos came out and introduced himself to us, shook our hands, and wanted to find out how we heard about the restaurant. Of course we gave our Yelpsters props for correctly identifying this place as bomb-digity. He wanted to make sure we knew the specials then even told us how some of the items were prepared. He emphasized that he didn't cut any corners, everything is homemade. Literally errrthing is homemade. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken wrap. It was delicious, but very very spicy. The buffalo sauce was hot and spicy, but not in a bad way, in an addicting way. The blue cheese dressing in the wrap was also homemade and some of the best I've ever had. The french fries, which I'm sure were homemade as well, were amazing. As good as mine was, my wife was the ""order winner"" as she got the Asian burger special. Carlos used a ginger based Asian sauce that brought out so much flavor in the burger then topped it with Wasabi mayo and an Asian-slaw. I've had Fukuburger and Bachi Burger and both are awesome, but are second stringers compared to Carlos' creation. Maybe the best burger I've ever tasted. And for the grand finale we ordered the lava cake. Absolutely the best I've had. Carlos told us that the secret was that he used Belgian chocolate. He also makes his owned whipped cream.

Carlos came out and checked on us mid-way through our meal to see how we liked everything. I almost gave him a standing ovation right then and there. He then checked on us one more time before we left and thanked us for our business. As the owner and executive chef I certainly wouldn't expect this kind of attention, but I really appreciated it. Both my wife and I really enjoyed chatting with him. I hope Carlos' Kitchen thrives in it's new location. Anyone who is that genuine about the food coming out of their kitchen deserves the utmost success.

Simply put, 5 stars, one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,5,2,5,eg2orPkq2LfV_5JDxxpTmQ

Oh my goodness it was fancy!  Beautiful ice sculpture, fruit carvings and can I mention the beautiful cake that made me drool??  I was pleasantly surprised when the lovely lady who was celebrating shared her cake.  Chef Carlos can get down on some desserts let me tell you!  

After my niece and I checked out the lovely reception we decided we should probably order.  We had an assortment of fried goodness for an appetizer.  Can't be positive but I think it included stuffed jalapenos, macaroni and cheese triangles or squares some shape with corners, tasty balls of some sort and onion rings.  The blue cheese was freshly made from what I overheard and had chunks of cheesy goodness. It was excellent!

I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap extra spicy, my niece ordered the cheese steak sandwich.  Of course I had to try it!  My wrap was spicy enough and packed with goodness.  I was sad when it was gone.  My nieces sandwich was flavorful and meaty.  So good when I need a meat fix! Too bad it's so far!

Dessert was pure bliss! It's a known dish from what I've heard.  As if the fried stuff stopped after the food!  It was a dessert fit for a queen.  Fried cheesecake, bananas foster, brownie and ice cream on a bed of crispy goodness and strawberries.  I'm craving it all over again just thinking about it.  Chef Carlos and his staff were awesome.  Making sure I had just enough beer to wash down all the fried decadence.  You can bet I will be returning.  Maybe if I call ahead I can get some beef wellington!

Andre got the ribeye with veggies instead of the traditional sides and he was very happy with it. He raved about it and told the sever how fantastic it was.

It was date night time on a Friday so my husband and I had the pleasure of visiting this place. Chef Carlos came over and introduced himself and his staff before going into the kitchen and we were served the rest of the night by the sweetest waitress. I forgot her name but she was genuinely nice, not fake nice, and so sweet that I wanted to give her a hug and become BFFs. Moving on...

Looking at their menu, they have the standard bar fare, but alas, what is this? Goat cheese balls? Yes please. Breaded and fried goat cheese served with balsalmic vinegar and mango chutney for your choice of dipping and a mixed greens salad. They were delicious, creamy, gooey, and all other words associated with cheese. For my entree, I got the salad that had strawberries, walnuts, bleu cheese and chicken. All the ingredients were super fresh and blended very well together. 

My husband got the spicy chicken sandwich which I stole several bites of. First off, the chicken was perfectly crispy and tender. The spicy sauce on it was not generic and surprisingly complex for a hot sauce. The bread. Oh the bread. I don't know what kind of bread they used but boy was it the perfect accompaniment. It did not ever get soggy, even at the end, and had the most fantastic chew to it. This was served with beer battered fries and when I tried one, I just had to order a basket because I knew my husband would get mad if I ate all of his.

The food here is undoubtedly stellar and the prices are fair considering the quality of the ingredients they use. I just wish it wasn't in a super smokey bar. My nose is pretty sensitive to smoke and I don't really want to smell that while I'm eating. I also wouldn't be able to bring my kids to this casual eatery because of its location. Regardless, I will be back for the food as my stomach is already craving the spicy chicken sandwich...",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,4,4,4,_I1bTkdoJR9QvlJieIWVzA

I went to this place on a recent trip to Las Vegas, based on the reviews here on Yelp and another site. This place is about 4 miles off the Strip, but it is so worth the trip. This is one of the best meals we had while in Vegas, regardless of the price. The food is very well prepared and presented, the service is quick and friendly. Once your food is served, the owner/chef, makes his way to your table to make sure that your food is as expected. This is a small place that has recently moved so even though the address says Durango, it is actually located on Flamingo, at the corner of Durango and Flamingo, beside a gas station and in the same building as a sports bar. If you want a finely prepared meal, that doesn't break the bank, this is your place. I wish we had one here in North West Florida.",SEvoyBMcqAB19fWIWH_3vQ,1,0,4,8U_sDtSwckK87t4asCdMYA

Carlos! wow!! Yum!!!

2719988,2013-07-30,6,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"Okay, Mr Carlos, you got my attention with your 4 1/2 star average. Now lets put it to the test.

When I pulled up to the building, it says Carlos's Kitchen but when you stick your head in the door, (which happens to be two of them. One on the right for the bar and one on the left for the restaurant) you can get really confused as to where to go if the server is not there to greet you. So I stood there for a bit wondering if I should play video poker at the bar or just sit down and wait.

So the waitress finally sits me down after she sees me just standing there like a statue. At first I didn't know where she came from but then realized there was no hostess for she was both. I assumed she came out of the kitchen because like I said, it is kind of confusing where to go.

So while im looking at the menu, she is going on about the daily specials but I had my mind made up on the Spicy Chicken from the tip I saw off the Yelp business listing. I gotta say it was a good choice. The sandwich is decent size, the chicken breast was juicy, and the sauce that was on it had that extra kick to wake up you taste buds. Also the french fries that came with it deserves some attention as well. There is some kind of breading on it that gives it a certain crunch and extra flavor. I cant put my finger on what it is, but it is definitely good to the point that you want to finish your fries.

Service was, let's just say a bit slow. I don't know if it was because there was only one server or the cook takes his time or what. I noticed there only 3 other tables being served so im not sure if this was your typical lunch crowd. As for the prices, they are comparable to Denny's or Chili's. A typical meal will run you 10 to 15 dollars per person. 

Lastly, since the bar is right next door and there is no barrier that segways from there, you will have secondhand smoke coming in from there, which is quite a negative if you ask me. My suggestion would be to put a swinging door there of some type and that should stop most if not some of the smoke from coming in.

So Mr Carlos, what other Yelp peeps are saying are legit. It's just that I cant really spend more than 45 minutes for lunch and eat without having to think about lung cancer. Your restaurant is definitely worthy of good quality time spent with friends and/or family.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,12,8,4,i4BFiXlBmiRlpQpdVqj89g
2778507,2012-02-01,4,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"I read about this place in Las Vegas Weekly a while back and learned that the chef used to be an instructor at Le Cordon Bleu. Gaming taverns aren't exactly known for their food, but this one might challenge others for having the best bar food around.

Looking at the menu there's a lot of typical bar fare -- burgers, wraps, salads, nachos, wings, etc. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted because nothing stood out. It all sounded pretty average... nothing unique. But the execution, at least with the one item I got, was excellent.

The buffalo chicken wrap ($8.99) was about the size of a Chipotle burrito, filled with plenty of crispy chicken tossed in a wing sauce (your choice of mild or hot) with blue cheese dressing, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was accompanied by some delicious fries that were both light and crispy.

I'm willing to go back for more, I just wish the menu had more personality... more items that differentiated the place from other bars... unique dishes that you couldn't get anywhere else.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,10,6,4,wxNfQC9r-0xLxPl7A__bTA

The fish was lightly battered and was crisped to perfection. The tilapia was very fresh and if kind of just melted in your mouth.  The burger my bf ordered was cooked medium rare... I wish I knew exactly what was in it to better describe it, however all I can say was it was so juicy and flavorful! It was in a sesame bun that was toasted and came with a side of fries. Our daughter enjoyed the Dessert very much. We ordered the deep fried cream cheeee...  mmmmmmmmm... I'm getting hungry thinking about the food from there.

2861452,2012-02-07,2,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"This is a review for Carlos Kitchen during Super Bowl XLVI 2012.  I don't know about anyone else, but I hate going to an overcrowded bar, especially during events like the Super Bowl.  Last year, I ended up going to a PT's and there was an annoying drunk that blew into a trumpet every chance he got.  I don't mind the loudness in a bar (it adds to the excitement of the game), but stuff like that is just a annoying in my opinion.  Needless to say, this year Jade and I were in search of a bar that met our criteria:
1:  Good Super Bowl deals on drinks and food
2:  A place that wasn't overly crowded
It's a pretty simple list and we ended up at the best place, which I'm sure we will be frequenting during every Super Bowl.... Carlos' Kitchen.  If you've never heard of this place, you definitely got to check it out.  Not only did they have a killer Super Bowl deal, there was plenty of seating available and the service was amazing.  It's locally owned/operated and Carlos himself even came by our table a few times during the night to see how everything was.  Here is the deal:
BIG SCREEN in the Dining Room and screens available throughout the Bar area
All-You-Care-To-Eat Buffet for $10.00 

Hamburger Sliders, Mini Spicy Chicken Sandwiches, Chips and Salsa 
BATTLE of the CHOWDERS: Manhattan v. New England!!
In honor of the New York Giants:
  NY Style Pizza
  Hot Dogs
In honor of the New England Patriots: 
  Shrimp Cakes
  Fresh Mussels 

Their full menu was also available for the night. 

Also, Charlie's (this is where Carlos' Kitchen is located.. inside Charlie's) offered Happy Hour Drinks
$1.00 Domestic Draft (Bud, Bud Light, Miller Light) & $2.00 Well Drinks

Pros:
* The food was awesome for the price!   We were a huge fan of the homemade pizza .  The chips and Salsa was also amazing!
* Incredible service.  Like I mentioned above, Carlos himself even came by to check on us.
* Spacious seating and the atmosphere was NOT a blanket of cigarette smoke

Cons:
* N/A   I really can't think of any negatives.


Overall:

  This is definitely a place to check out during Super Bowl for the upcoming years.   They had some pretty good finger foods and good deals on drinks too!  As you can see with how they arranged the special Super Bowl menu, they definitely had some Super Bowl spirit!  Awesome Super Bowl deals and incredible service... I'll definitely be back.  Highly recommended!  
Tips:
*  Carlos' Kitchen is inside Charlie's Saloon 
*  They have an App that can be downloaded for specials

2927135,2011-12-23,4,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"It's not very often that the owner of the restaurant is your server. It was kind of funny. At first I thought he was the chef since he was wearing a white chef jacket, but then he came up to us and said, ""My name is Carlos and this is my kitchen."" He introduced himself AND explained the name of his restaurant.

I kept reading about how specials are posted on a board, but I couldn't find it at first and I didn't want to just get a regular sandwich or burger. I eventually noticed it behind the bar area and for today they had Enchiladas, a Southwestern burger, and a turkey ruben. I asked Carlos what was in the Southwestern burger and he said it had Pepper Jack Cheese,Roasted Peppers Grilled Onion, Lettuce,& Tomato with Chipotle Ranch. I was going to order it, but my mom jumped on that before I did, so I went with the Enchiladas. We both got iced tea that was always refilled once it hit the halfway mark. 

While waiting, I took a look around the place. It's definitely Arizona Charlie themed, as Lucy E stated and it doesn't have the best ambiance. When we first walked in, we were greeted by a strong smell of smoke, but we just sat at one of the tables farthest from the bar area and it was fine. The furniture is pretty outdated with some old looking floral print fabric and our table cloth kept trying to fall off. Normally I would knock off some stars for that, but the food + service was outstanding. It seemed like everyone working at Charlie's Saloon was involved in the restaurant. The bartender in the saloon went up to us a few times to see how we were doing, gave us our menus when we just sat down, and asked how the Enchiladas were. When I told him they were great, he said, ""That's what I'll be having for lunch. Everything in Carlos' Kitchen is amazing. You could probably throw a dart to pick anything on the menu and it'll come out awesome."" Before we even ordered the burger, Carlos said all their burgers are very good. You can tell that Carlos and everyone that works here is very proud of the food. 

Carlos came out with our plates. The first thing I noticed was that the Enchilada plate looked a lot smaller than the ones you'd get at Mexican restaurants, but it was the perfect portion. Normally other places will just fill the plate with a bunch of sauce and watery beans, but this plate just had the two Enchiladas in the center and a small portion of beans and rice on the right and left. At first I thought the sauce was going to be overbearing because it looked like there was a lot of it, but it actually had a nice subtle flavor that complemented the Enchiladas perfectly. I'll be honest, I scraped my plate clean. I don't even remember the last time I ever did that, but I couldn't help it. The Enchilada plate was just so yummy and the portion was perfect. It didn't leave me overly full and I didn't have to waste any of it.

I took a bite of my mom's burger and it was good. The patty was very juicy and I actually really liked the Chipotle ranch that was inside. When I took a pic of the burger, it looked like there was A LOT of cheese in it, but the piece I ate didn't have any cheese on it, so I can't really comment on it ruining the burger (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w3pRWx5xOnPmmuZL7c9Pvw/l.jpg). My favorite part about that dish was the beer battered french fries. They are soo long, so crisp, and perfectly breaded (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ie6f7x2-KBkbpdbxKJAuRA/l.jpg). I absolutely love their fries!

When we were done with our meals, Carlos talked to us for a while. He told us about how everything they make is from scratch including their soups. They always have a different soup and they just create it from whatever vegetable is in abundance at the grocery store or whatever is in season. He also told us about the New Years Eve Feast they're having for $20.12 (clever, right?). It includes: Mixed Greens with Poached Pears, Bleu Cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette,
Grilled Filet Mignon topped with Two Sauteed Prawns, Eggnog Pannacotta with Brandy Caramel Sauce and fresh Whipped Cream. It's an awesome deal and it's served from 4pm-midnight.

Everything about our experience here today was excellent an I'll definitely be coming back to try out some more of their daily deals and definitely some of their soup!

Tips:
*Carlos' Kitchen has an app that you can download for free! It shows you their daily specials, menus, and restaurant info
*Daily specials are posted on a board on the left side of the bar area. It's next to the kitchen door",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,13,9,5,-usjVpm3q3sf6ybTvBqqSg
3013983,2012-07-01,1,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"I rarely head to one restaurant twice on the same day, but this place was an exception.  After reading rave reviews on Yelp and passing by several times in the past few months, I gave in this morning to my hubby's persistence and decided it was time to give this place a try.  I am one of those people who believe that environment reflects quality.  If that were true, this place should be filled with frozen food out of a box and canned sauces.  After all, being in a 24/7 bar doesn't scream awesomeness up front. 

I am now ready to apologize for even thinking that way, especially after trying the food here.  It's a breath of fresh air, or, in this case, a spoonful of great tastes.  I love the fact that it's odd and the food is a total contrast to the setting.  I also love the fact that the chef loves his food and patrons so much that he says hello personally to all his patrons.  It's the small things that make this place a hidden gem.

When you first drive up you see this empty sign on the front wall and then walking through the front doors you see this dark bar with poker machines on the counters, then this small restaurant seating area to the left.  There's a sign with the menu posted, but no host podium, so you stand there and wonder, ""should I just sit, or wait for someone?""  Sure enough they read your mind and the nicest server comes to seat you anywhere you wish.  

I tucked myself in to a white cloth-covered booth that was a bit interesting to me.  I've never seen cabinet liners (they prevent the table cover from slipping) under a tablecloth before.  That's actually pretty clever, but odd once again.  The chairs have those floral pillows on them, the backings of the booths are the same pattern, then there's the decor on the wall of tiny copper pots and pans.  You do see frames filled with articles of praise for this place, which is nice to read while you wait to place your order (and the wait isn't long at all).

The menu is simple.  Simple is good.  I hate having 14 pages to sift through, ten types of meats to think of with fourteen side dishes to choose.  Chef Carlos pairs everything well so you don't have to think.  All you have to do is order what you want.  With the small menu it's easy.  There are a few specials if you're in the mood to try something other than the usual dishes, and I suggest that you do.

My first meal ever at this restaurant is the portobello sandwich with grilled red onions, mixed greens, jack cheese, and bell pepper.  It's served on a hoagie roll with fresh french fries.  The edges were just the right crispiness and the mushrooms could convert you to vegetarian.  It's meaty, flavorful, and done well.  Sometimes veggie sammies are wet and the bread gets soggy, but the bread was yummy and stayed perfect the whole meal.  I even tried my hubby's Greek burger (the special) and it was fantastic.  The meat is seasoned perfectly, and every topping compliments each other and isn't overwhelming.  As for the fries, they are delicious and crispy.  We even had onion rings, and they're fantastic.  When menus say ""beer battered"" you order them craving that beer taste only to be left wanting, but these onion rings have that flavor well pronounced.  The crispy batter sticks, even when cutting them down with a fork, and that's something that hardly happens for me when I eat onion rings anywhere.  

In the end I had to try one dessert, so I ordered the lava cake, which I craved after watching Master Chef the other night (it was their cooking challenge dish).  His lava cake was creamy, warm, and had that perfectly baked crunch edge on the outside that I love.  Although not served with ice cream, the sauces braided around it was a lovely touch and the whipped cream was nice, too.  

We loved it so much that four hours later we came back to eat dinner.  I have to say that the food that evening was just as spectacular. I could rave on about both meals, but all you need to  know is that it is worth a try.  Don't be afraid of the atmosphere or location because that doesn't matter.  What matters is that this man, this brilliant man with over 2 decades of serious hotel, restaurant, catering and teaching at Cordon Bleu experience offers us locals a chance to eat beautiful, filling, yummy food without the need to fork out a mortgage payment or slip on a tiny black dress or suit and tie.  This man doesn't need the velvet seats or fancy bottled water.  All he needs is a place to be creative, to do what he loves without restraint, and to create happy accidents like the cheesecake spring rolls.  

Give this place a try and I promise you that you will walk out happily surprised and satisfied that you found a hidden gem in the most unlikely of places.  I know I walked out so excited that I came back for dinner the same day.  I plan to eat my way through his entire menu.  I challenge you to do the same.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,4,3,4,kmkCodINOzv9SWRxa0ICkg

3040436,2013-08-15,0,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"The epitome of the ""hidden gem"" restaurant  in a city filled with fast food or over-priced hyper-famous celebrity joints, Carlos' Kitchen is just what the undecided diner needs. 
The food is so good for the price that if I were one of those who could afford to eat at a Wolfgang's or other Vegas strip profile eatery very week, I'd go to Carlos' instead and leave giant tips. I feel comfortable there-- no gourmet snobs giving me the ""he's not hip"" glances; but even if you order a more familiar dish, the quality always proves you HAVE found food you aren't used to.... unless you're used to paying more. 
You will probably have trouble choosing a favorite dish. These are CHEFS. They're real pros that do everything well, not just one sauce or bread handed down from a forgotten talented relative.
If forced to choose, I would ask Carlos if he has the ingredients to make his amazing ""Greek burger"". You'll be thinking about that  one long after you eat it.
It's too bad people like ""Susy Y"" have to pretend they are pro food critics when their observational skills are so poor (a male employee sleeping there??), then visit the one night (I've ever heard of) the door being open between the dining room and bar. Which reminds me (there's so much she got wrong), it is NOT a bar burger, just because a bar is attached to the room and the food can go to the bar. And I highly doubt yet another very young, typically posturing hipster-pseudo-intellectual could tell the difference between medium rare and medium, being that's somewhat relative anyway... Yet she went ahead and wrote it about it of course, yet guessed at what is obviously sautéed spinach, which I would HOPE isn't sharing even strength with the feta. Have an opinion, but please see life from more years, highs and lows before posing as someone who knows food. When a city like vegas has most people whipping by to get to the nearest McDonald's, it's no wonder guys like Carlos have to struggle with finding a location and the amount of help to start. I could see that challenge a mile away... so I was surprised when the food was that good (just check out other reviews) and the service was that good. Clearly if someone had a problem with Carlos' it would be an off-night (nobody's perfect) or a review from an over- privileged punk.",bgeRXhVJrLtlOTVlEqoJLQ,1,0,5,sinJV-1qhq9Hs4YaIVKAhA

We came in a little over an hour before closing and only one other table had been sat. Our waitress was very nice and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Aside from their normal items, they also offer a soup of the day and different daily specials.

As other reviews have mentioned, the separation between the restaurant and bar itself, isn't much of one. Since I used to smoke myself, I don't complain but you can definitely see the smokiness in the air of the restaurant and that's a bit disappointing. It could be because we were in a bit late but I can certainly see how this would bother a lot of people. 

I ordered the burger special that day which was The Southwest Burger. It was a decent burger but cooked unevenly. I'm not sure how they managed to do so but half the burger was cooked medium rare, like I like, and the other half was overdone...at least for my taste. Even so, the burger itself had decent flavor and it was a good size patty for a $10 buyer. The fries were really the saving grace for me and I could have made myself sick eating them. They have a thick, salty breading and are just delicious. The wifey ordered a ribeye which she enjoyed but didn't amaze with it's $17 price tag.

Chef Carlos came out to check on us and the other couple there which was much appreciated. And while the food was decent, it's a bit overpriced.

The specials sounded amazing so we tried the chipotle ribs and the BBQ hamburger plus my husband got the clam chowder. My husband said the chowder was amazing;some of the best ever.  Our meals were very good, especially for the price. 

The place is cute. It was kind of empty and everyone that was there seemed to be friends or family. Or maybe they're just regulars. Our server had to have been the Chef's mom.  She was a little scattered and forgot to charge us for items which I pointed out to them but friendly none the less.

3242533,2013-04-06,1,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"Just finished having lunch here and it was fabulous. Started off with the onion rings and nachos with beef as our appetizers. The rings were crispy,yet light and the beer batter was the best I have ever tasted. Devoured them. The nachos were fantastic as well with the home made chips. Hubby and I were fighting over the guacamole.  We split a guacamole burger which was the special burger of the day and it was unbelievably good. Fresh tomatoes, crisp lettuce, caramelized onions, green chiles, cheese, and guacamole topped a juicy patty that was cooked to perfection. Normally I put mayo and ketchup on my burger but this time I ate it as is.  So much flavor you didn't need to add anything to it. 

Chef Carlos was so warm and welcoming and chatted with us before and after our meal. Our server Iris was an absolute doll and was friendly and very attentive.

3318251,2012-08-03,1,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"I'm glad I looked this place up or I'd have never found it - THANKS YELPERS!! 

I ate myself stupid - meal, drink, dessert & coffee - for $17 + tip. Plus, I got to watch the Olympics as I sat at the bar with 4-star quality food.

Ok, so the restaurant's situated in a bar. About 1/3rd of the bar is restaurant-style sit-down, but since it was 4:30 and I was by myself for this particular adventure, I just sat at the bar and enjoyed the $1 draft happy hour. The menu specials change daily and they're totally at odds with the surroundings (who would consider Bourbon Glazed Grilled Salmon and Creme Brulee standard fare at a sports bar?? I digress...). Either way, if you're debating a trip over, you can check the specials and menu on the website above.

So, Carlos himself came over to talk to me about the menu and I mentioned Yelp (to which he said, ""They've been very good to me."") and asked about the chicken nachos that have been raved about by many. He informed me that, in addition to the chicken nachos that get all the attention, he has shredded beef nachos that are equally as good. I decided to take his advice and tried them. Conclusion: HOLY SH!T, THESE ARE GOOD! 

*Nachos, Deconstructed*
The Base - Chips and Cheese: 
- The chips are obviously fresh-fried and crispy throughout (no soggies, even toward the middle, at the end of my food-fest). 
- ""Mo' Cheese, Mo' Better"" seems to be the guiding principle here and it's melted perfectly (no stray non-melties and it isn't cooked so much that it's browned or crunchy). If you're like me and delight in just melting a pile of cheese on a plate to pick at as a snack, then you'll be happy. If you think I'm gross, well... that sucks.
Veggies:
- Consisted mainly of green onions, pico de gallo and tomatoes. Not too heavy on 'em and balanced in flavor.
- Guacamole - I know, avocado's a fruit, so sue me. There was a big, ice cream scoop-sized lump of it resting on top of the pile of nachos. Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster, it was great. Nice and creamy, without the bitterness you get with so many other guac's. I dug it.
Beef:
- Juicy, tangy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. I would have seriously just been happy with a plate of the stuff. 
Accessorize:
The whole pile was drizzled with sour cream and either queso fresco or panela cheese. 

For dessert, there's a Chef's Indulgence (which consists of 3 or 4 different desserts and was tempting, despite being alone and already pretty full), but I decided on Creme Brulee and a cup of coffee. The creme brulee was on par with the nachos - made from scratch, perfectly done and just the right texture. I had done away with decorum at about nacho #4, so I just continued on that tack by using my finger to scrape out the remainders of the custard in the bottom of the ramekin (that's the beauty of it being in a dark bar - nobody even looked sideways at my piggish ways). 

Excellent meal with excellent company (I talked with Carlos for nearly 20 minutes as I ate). In addition to the food, he told me he offers cooking demonstrations on Saturdays, which sounds like something fun to do. He's obviously well-rounded in his experience and after chatting with him, found out that he's been all over the country cooking for restaurants and four-star hotels, in addition to cooking his way through Germany (hence the spaetzle special that pops up from time to time), Italy, France and Luxembourg. 

If you've made it this far, I hope I've conveyed how impressed I was. Can't wait to go back!",V8a3Qy3o1xp_-9XqtmRFZg,2,1,5,7X2iJBju6fdp6aiauJSDRA

From the appetizers (any of them I've had almost all of them) to the deserts. Chef Carlos not only makes an amazing dish but the presentation of the food makes you feel as if you are eating at the most expensive restaurant. I tell everybody I know about this place!

Carlos is awesome; he always come to the table to say hi and check on the food and service ( which has never disappointed). We bring anyone who comes from out of town here also.

My bf and I came here for the first time tonight for dinner. At first, when we saw that the location was in an old Vegas bar, we were skeptical but it's just his starting location. He will get bigger and can only get better! 

We ordered the Chicken Angelina and Fettuccine Don Carlos. Both were good but the chicken was our favorite! There's something in that sauce that makes this now one of our new spots, if not to try everything else on the menu, but just to come back each time for that. For dessert, we ordered the Chef's Indulgence. Sooo wonderful and made us wanting more. Loved the bananas foster and cheesecake rolls!

What was super cool about our experience was that the chef came out to greet everyone. He knew we were new and introduced himself, and spent some time talking about the menu and why and how he came up with some of the items on it. Chef is a very smart man, you can tell and will be very successful.

3591706,2012-07-26,1,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"The sheer level of quality of food for price ratio is enough to give this place five stars. But even if the prices were double, the food would still easily be worth it. But I'm sure glad they aren't, as I'd be going broke soon enough.

A lot has been covered by reviews previous to mine. The atmosphere is odd, though separated enough that you can ignore the bar that offers little compared to the food on the table in front of you. I've had about half a dozen meals here now, and none of them have been short of outstanding.

If nothing else, the food is just simply perfectly cooked and seasoned. In particular, one of the specials, short ribs, is a dish you could easily pay upwards of thirty dollars for at a fine dining restaurant. And boy, is it just as good as all those other places. But not only is the meat good, even the vegetables are incredibly delicious. My mouth waters even thinking about how good that dish is.

I've also had a burger here. I'd actually recommend going for a main dinner special over it, but it's still excellent. Of particular excellence is the onion rings. I got them in lieu of fries in order to lower the calories of my meal, but the fact is they're so good it's worth it to get them anyways.

I've also had a pork chop special,chopped steak, a San Francisco melt sandwich, as well as the goat cheese cakes and the Chef's Indulgence dessert. The first time I got the goat cheese cakes, I was dumbfounded. It was the first item I had there, and it, no exaggeration, looked like a dish from a michelin-starred restaurant. The presentation was magnificent, and the cakes themselves were unbelievably textured and full of flavor. The Chef's Indulgence dessert struck me the same way - far more extravagant than a 5.99 price would suggest.

If you enjoy fine dining foods at a price that rivals a Dennys (who doesn't?), then make a point to visit Carlos' Kitchen.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,4,2,5,W-wq0tcL-ECoQ8W8Sr7pHA

I also like how charming it is in the restaurant.  We've had the same waitress each of the three times we've been, and she is so cute and nice.

I went because i was in the mood for burger and fries and hate fast food.  It definitely was not disappointing.  Great burger flavor, cooked perfectly, great bun, toasted just right and LOVED the fries.

I loved that the chef/owner meets everyone who comes in.  The guy seems to care.  I thought the waitress was friendly and responsive. It seemed a tiny bit long of a wait for a burger but then I was really hungry to it could just be my growling stomach.  That being said both burger and fries were hot of the grill, out of the basket so there was no waiting around.  The got it to me seconds after it was done.

I tried the dessert you see everywhere here and really liked it.  SUPER sweet so if you like something mildly sweet this won't work for you.  I wasn't sure what it was by photos but wanton wrapped cheesecake fried and ice cream and fried something else that was supposed to be bananas foster but tasted like more cheesecake (fine with me) and brownie and then fried wonton strips that look like noodles and everything drizzled with chocolate syrup and fruit syrup.  I actually liked the light crunchy of the fried wonton strips with the sweet syrup. It was fun.

The regular menu wasn't small but not as big as a lot of kind of ""pub food"" places I have seen.  I was hoping for a special I was interested in like schnitzel but just decided to stick with the plan on burger and fries.
-------------------------------------------------
Note:  I was there fairly early for dinner but it seemed very family friendly.  there were only 2 other groups and both had youngish children to early teens.  One said they came there all the time.  The waitress either knew kids well and/or had them herself because she immediately said there was not a kids menu but suggested some really good things the kids got excited about
-----------------------------------------------


Now a few things I think could use improvement:
1. It smells a little musty like old cigarette smoke.  There's a bar attached but not burning cigarettes.  I looked at all the curtains and window coverings and things and all clean and fresh paint.  I'm guessing the ceiling tiles absorbed a lot of smoke previously.  minor but noticable
2. definitely ""on a budget"" decorating so kudos for trying to put out white table clothes and padding underneath but if you can't iron the creases out at least 86 the plastic flowers on the table.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,3,1,3,gElRNoFdP_MS0snBYFjfqQ

Baby Back Ribs was accompanied by the best homemade coleslaw and superb fries.  Burrito was the best burrito ever eaten along with the sauce Carlos had made.

Don't worry that you are at the wrong place when you geet there.  The restaurant is inside a bar in a strip mall.  Go in, you won't be disappointed.  We had a great experience at the Firenze Lounge in the Ravella Hotel with Chef Marco.  We asked him for recommendations, and he said we should try his dad's restaurant.  His dad, Carlos, is a world class chef who taugh at Le Cordon Bleu, and now has this little place inside a bar.  Our group wanted an adventure, so we went for lunch the next day.

We were greated by the friendly bar staff, and then our order was taken by Carlos' sous chef.  He was great, and you could tell that our meal wasn't goingg to be your typical bar food.  My wife and I split a grilled cheese (four cheese) sadwich and we each had a cup of Tomato basil soup.  The sandwich was good, but the soup was awesome!  The soup was made fresh, and coutons in the soup even seemed like they made them right there.  I wanted to lick the cup.  

Our friends had the angus burger and the strawberry chicken salad.  Both were very good.  They were both very good too.

3883489,2012-06-26,2,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"Before I launch into this, let me say I've only been to Carlos' Kitchen once, and I generally dislike reviewing a place based on 1 visit.  Not to say you can't get a genuine feel for a place after 1 visit, more like there are so many places I frequent that I haven't reviewed and I feel those fully-realized thoughts would be more beneficial to Yelp readers.  But upon leaving Carlos' Kitchen, after just 1 visit, I felt compelled to chime in and share this gem with locals sooner rather than later.

One of the reasons I feel comfortable reviewing Carlos' is that every other positive review of this place is already spot-on.  YES, Carlos was there and came to visit my table (at 9:30pm on a weekday, despite an otherwise empty dining room) - a classy, genteel, respectful move if there ever was one in the restaurant biz.  YES, my food was hot to order, well presented, plentiful, and above all, delicious.  YES, there is always multiple specials of the day, your server will describe them in precise detail, and it won't be a scam like Cream of Yesterday's Entree Soup. YES, the place is a poker bar with scant distance from the smokey bar to the seating area, but once the food starts landing all that melts away.  And YES, the prices are far more reasonable than they have any business being (Hot app, sandwich, special-of-the-day dinner salad, and 2 soft drinks came in under $40, even after tax/tip,).  

So what else do I want to add to this conversation that hasn't already been said?  Thanks for asking, I'll tell you...

Carlos' Kitchen looks like a Timbers, a PT's, a Lodge, an Outside Inn, a Sierra Gold, a Bilbo's, both inside and out.  The difference, the reason you should choose to eat here versus all those other close, fast & convenient options, is because Carlos is a dedicated chef and absolutely yearns to make you happy.  Without putting words into his mouth, he's crafted these dishes and prepares them for you because he wants people to eat better food, and there's more than one way to accomplish that goal besides being a 5-star Strip restaurant (which he could totally do if he wanted,). The easiest way for Carlos to reach the masses, or just to simply make one person's day better with a good meal, is to serve pub grub next to a video poker machine and do it better than anyone else in the neighborhood.

These types of restaurants used to be the norm, and they can be again if Vegas makes the concerted effort to drive past TGI Friday's and Red Lobster and support the guy who got up that morning intent on making their day better through nachos, burgers, and chocolate cake.",INBUCYK-dguQKfDWIwug0w,5,4,4,aPDV4OaUTw8WUaVl1l1Bog
3966522,2013-07-01,8,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"To all previous Yelp friends who reviewed Carlos' Kitchen--THANK YOU!  I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.

We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.

The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!

Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  

Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!

Every other aspect of my experience of Carlos's Kitchen was outstanding. The service was above par with a young tattoo'ed lady (sorry i forgot your name) that was very sweet and attentive. Just like others mentioned Carlos himself came from the kitchen to introduce himself and offer some feedback on the menu and looking for feedback as well from his customers which i found very refreshing. And the food itself.... 

Chicken nachos on recommendation of Yelpsters was pretty damn tasty with the seasoned chicken, but the highlight for me was the huge clump of fresh guac on the top and the fresh salsa on the side. That guac was solid. 

There was a seafood pasta (forgot the fancy name) that was on the specials board for the day. Had a heavy portions of mussels, shrimp, in a red sauce served with spaghetti that was so good. The fresh garlic slivers and fresh ingredients really shined with dish. Even the damn garlic bread was that good with fresh garlic, but i am a sucker for dough. 

The BBQ burger was good but i made a mistake by ordering it. Ill be honest i was disappointed after trying the pasta that i had ordered ""just a burger"". It was cooked well with an onion ring inside and the BBQ sauce combo that gave it great flavor but id say that its a hamburger but a good one. The fries were very tasty and not what i expected as they were larger style steak fries which are usually not too crispy but these were which i love. 

Dessert was the platter that came with cheesecake egg roll, warm brownie bite, and another cheese cake bite. All of which was excellent but i think next time ill go for one larger dessert to enjoy rather than just bites like a sampler style situation. 

All in all the food, service, and people were all very positives notes as the simple thought behind serving people good food, with good service, and a smile will always do well is true here. My only suggestion would be to order one of the specials rather than ""just a burger"" although the burger is good i always feel like i can replicate it at home and i cant with some of the other food that may be served here by Carlos so take advantage of his skills and let him serve you up something proper. You can count on me being a return customer as just Carlos's approach and appreciation to his customers was enough to win me over.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,1,1,4,41ilgOVosrBvSqaEySWWqg

The new location is a definite improvement because the bar is in a separate space, separate door, so the smoke doesn't travel to the dining area. The dining area was  clean and comfortable. 

Food: 
Goat Cheese Cake - goat cheese was breaded and fried, which is not complicated but simple is very good. 

Nachos with chicken - it was decent. The chips are freshly fried, topped with toppings and then baked.  

Mussels - These were overcooked and a lot of them has cracked shells. Becasue they were overcooked, the mussel stuck onto the shell.  

No dessert order. 

I would come back but I just would not order the mussels.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,4,3,3,GVpinN1gIhZjKctOr0rB0Q

It was a blue cheese and bacon burger which he cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The quality of ingredients was good and prepared well.  I walked out thinking that his abilities were being wasted in this environment.  I would like to see what he could do in fine dining.,cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,1,0,5,1aEji37QwvI_TcYi_fLIwg

Very friendly person. We got to meet his daughter as well, who had a menu item named after her, which is the Chicken Angelina. It's a very delicious item, the ingredients have been put alot of thought into as they taste amazing together at once.

I had a special, it was a southwestern burger. what I loved the most were the peppers he used. They were unique. They weren't spicy at all, in fact it was sweet and crunchy. the patty was juicy too. I ended up drooling while eating.

The dessert was lovely in presentation. The Creme Brulee was just right, it wasn't overpowering in sugar, it felt so light. The items are pricy, but Carlo puts alot of effort into his meals.",a7Oby4yiZ8wHKvu2zhoC5Q,5,2,5,k2OoHZsFTFx4dMwkzQ79ww

Anyway, after much review reading from Yelp, the fiance and I decided to give it a shot, as we were tired of all the Asian food we eat. :)

Atmosphere and decor is alright. It's not too fitting since it's attached to a bar. The restaurant isn't too big, and it wasn't incredibly busy either.

Our servers name was Iris, a very nice lady who seemed very knowledgeable about the menu and how the items were prepared. She was the only server working though, and it showed, She was very busy with the 7 tables at once and we overheard her apologize to every table about their waits. We had to wait awhile to order, however we did not mind too much.

Fast forward to the food. For our appetizer, we ordered the beef nachos. It was pretty disappointing. I appreciate that the chips are fried to order, however it seemed very unnecessary. We had very little toppings, a few scraps of meat, and the cheese was glued to all the chips. It wasn't too ""stringy"", it just seemed like the dish was sitting under the heat lamp too long. 

Our entrees were alright too. I had the crispy chicken sandwich w/fries and a broccoli cream soup. The chicken wasn't as crispy, and the buffalo sauce seemed a bit off. The soup was bland however the presentation was beautiful. The fries are AMAZING. My fiance ordered the Chicken Angelina, a chicken breast in garlic-spinach mashed potatoes with dijon mustard sauce. It was pretty decent, no complaints. 

The service was a little slow, and the chef came out and spoke to everyone about their meals and asked how everything was. It was very neat to see a chef come out and greet the customers, one of the reasons why this is a three star review.

Overall, we appreciate the effort of the chef. Our food is decent and the service was friendly but slow. There are just too many other places in the valley to justify us returning. Best of luck though, the chef is a nice guy.",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,0,0,3,r-xB8LwCArbOMKjeADyd7A

Our server, Angelina, was friendly, responsive, and very thoughtful.  Between the two of them, the service can't be beat!

As for the food...It was wonderful!  Looking at the menu, you may think that you have tried some of those dishes before--I guarantee that you haven't.  Everything has been home made and reinterpreted, all the way down to the delicious ranch dressing.  It is herby and fresh--very delicious for dipping crispy fries!

Our group ordered the hummus appetizer, the goat cheese cakes, and the tomato mozz anitipasto appetizers.  They are ALL prepared in a way that you haven't seen before!  The tomatoes have been peeled and marinated, the mozz has been re-created into a light mousse, and the hummus is served with an assortment of grilled vegetables kissed by a balsamic glaze.  Delicious!

I had the Chicken Angelina, a side of herbed polenta, and the chef's indulgence dessert.  Also, very amazing.  See the pictures!  The presentation is beautiful!

4447743,2013-12-26,0,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"So we were visiting family in LV.  A co-worker of mine who had recently been to LV told me about CK.  How he found it I will have to ask him next time I see him.  And a word about him, he is a chef caliber cook who was filmed on a segment on a TV cooking show a few years ago.  He raved about CK.  Was a walking, living, breathing commercial.

So on to CK.  I was thoroughly impressed.  First is the menu has the basics, but he adds specialty items for those wanting something a little fancier than standard comfort food.  Most places try to do one or the other.  First restaurant I have been to where the chef came out, introduced himself, and answered any questions about the menu. 

I had the bleu burger.  I don't order many burgers because they are so easy to make at home.  But owing to the good reviews I figured it would be good and it was.  I ordered it medium and it was just right.  Maybe the best burger I have had out.  

My wife ordered the spicy chicken salad.  He told her it would be hot and she said OK.  She said it was a bit warm for her but ate her share.  Not going to blame him when he gives you a heads up.  Others in our group were completely satisfied with their entrees.   

We had a goat cheese appetizer and deserts. I had the chocolate lava cake.  I normally don't order deserts at a restaurant because of a severe peanut allergy and a near death experience many years ago after eating a store bought cake.  But Carlos said he makes the lava cake on site and there isn't a peanut in the joint or on the ingredients list.  So I trusted him and boy it was good.

In summary:  Very good food.  Reasonable prices.  Incomparable attention from the Chef.  What is wrong with Las Vegas?  This place should be full on a Saturday night.  We will be back next time we are in town.",mpk4emgTX6SKCmtn4LxYkg,4,0,5,-5ARGkYIXlygyHWk5apFiA

I have looked long for a restaurant that serves the excellent food, has excellent service, has excellent prices, with perfect portions (IMO), with a casual environment, and open late. This restaurant meets all the criteria that i look for in my ideal restaurant.  My rating stands unchanged.

I have had the pleasure of being taken care of by both Angelina and Iris.  You know your service is great when you remember your servers names after only one visit and they remember you.

The food is consistently amazing, and the prices make it a neighborhood joint you can afford to keep coming back to. The burgers are phenomenal, the nachos are a perfect substitute for dinner when you're not that hungry but require munchies to go with your beer. Every time I've tried the special of the day, I have been shocked at how cheap the place is. My all-time favorite is a bleu-cheese steak alfredo type pasta dish that I have been craving for about a week now. I am normally not an alfredo person; they normally end up either slimy and watery, or so rich I feel sick halfway through the plate. I don't even know how I ordered this alfredo, but it was perfect. I sopped up every drop of the sauce with my bread, and was still super sad when it was gone.

I've never had anything I didn't deeply enjoy here, and the very small staff are always amazingly attentive, offer great suggestions (see entry: me eating alfredo) and make you feel like you're in on some amazing secret. 

Pros:
- Great food, great prices. Seriously, what more do you people want?!
- Warm, friendly, oddly ""small town"" atmosphere. 
- Super easy parking, great location in town.

Cons:

Review: The girlfriend and I were looking up new places to eat and found that a lot of Yelp users had high regards for this place.  We thought to give it a shot.

The location is a little shady, but don't let that turn you away as it almost did for me.  We walked in and were greeted immediately by the chef/owner.

It was weird seeing this type of dining in a setting like this, but we learned the food made up for it.

She ordered the Chicken Angelina and I had the special of the day (Prime Rib).

Chicken angelina: beautifully cooked, moist inside, perfectly grilled, texture was great.  The sauce really complimented the chicken with notes of dijon mustard.

Prime rib: very soft, not too salty, good portion size. I devoured it quickly.

Dessert: Creme brulee and chocolate lava cake.

Creme brulee - I really recommend this.  It's one of the most underrated desserts.  He does this one really good.  The creme is soft in texture and perfect in consistency.  Not overpoweringly sweet.  The caramelized sugar on top was delicious.",g_6pJL8vHCOTJtCjEGvqCQ,4,1,4,klVvLth-DqF3WBfhKotQ5g

If you're a nacho lover, there is no other spot you need to try more. The chips are fried to order. There is generous cheese gooeying up the plate, homemade salsa and guac (although I wanted more of the green charmer!). We went with chicken, and it is prepared from a whole chicken, shredded and flavorful! I would also go back just for chips and salsa.

Onion rings what? I just had a couple of my husband's, but they had this magical stripe that was creating some gustatory goodness.

And, cream of broccoli soup! I love soup as much as I love nachos, and this soup was comfort liquified. I can't wait to try more of the soups of the day. 

And to think that upon walking in, the environs inspired a fleeting thought of walking out. It is an uninspired video poker bar complete with eau du smoke, and the furniture is upholstered in a 90s patio furniture floral. Honestly, I felt a little sad. I had anticipated Carlos' area to be a bit more separate than it actually is, so have no disillusions of escaping the overall vibe of a video poker establishment, at least initially. 

The testament to the food is that by the end of my meal the environment had faded to a sidenote. I couldn't even smell the smokiness in the air. I guess my nostrils were too fascinated with the essence of nachos. 

Service from Angelina is without doubt the best. She has a lovely way of describing all of the dishes, and her passion for the food really elevates the experience, not that the food needs any help!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,23,14,4,zvq1k-PAPbvMylRcn1UOaQ

_________________________

I picked this place for my birthday celebratory dinner #4. I just had a good feeling after reading reviews of respected yelpers and friends.

When I pulled into the parking lot and even when my husband and I walked in the door, I didn't doubt my restaurant choice. Yes, it's located adjacent from a gas station. Yes, it's in a random bar.  The sooner you get past these non-important facts, the sooner you get to eat some amazing food.

IMHO, the location of this restaurant adds a wonderful element of surprise and awe to any superficial first impressionists.  
I would recommend Carlos' Kitchen to my mom and sister. I have never said that before and I probably would never say that again--- so let me say it one more time: I would recommend Carlos' Kitchen to my mom and sister.  The magnitude of that statement is this : They are food snobs and they complain about EVERY little thing possible - not to the chef or management-- but to me --- for YEARS!!!! (i.e. ""Remember when you told about that gelato place and they didn't even know how to pronounce 'pistachio'  correctly??!""). Hmph.

Ok, back to actual useful information:  In addition to the special of the day, they have a soup of the day,  catch of the day, burger of the day, and wrap of the day. For appetizers we had the Tortilla Crusted Shrimp and the Goat Cheese cake. The shrimp had an amazing crunch to it and the sauce had the perfect bite to it. I'm not a big goat cheese person, but mixed with the sauce - it was quite pleasing.

For the entrée I had the Pasta Fettuccine Don Carlos. My husband had the burger of the day - he doesn't remember what it was called but it had guacamole on it . I think his exact words were - ""I don't know what it was called, but it was one of the best burgers I've ever had"". My pasta was perfectly cooked and it was a big enough portion to enjoy it for lunch the next day. There were ample amounts of shrimp and the sauce was just delicious. My friend enjoyed the special of the day which I believe was a rib-eye - I don't remember exactly because he was the first one finished - I think he ate it before anyone could ask for a bite.

Chef Carlos came out to greet everyone. He was warm and sincere. My husband had to wait on his burger just a few minutes after we received our food, so Chef Carlos came out again to apologize and said that dessert was on him. It wasn't a big deal to us but who were we to argue?! Plus... as much as we thoroughly enjoyed the food ---- Dessert was the BEST part. We all split the Chef's Indulgence....and indulgent it was!!! Everything on the plate was just... I can't even begin to describe. It had bananas with a crunchy coating on it, and brownies... you know, now that I think about it, there was more on the plate but when you split a dessert with 3 other people, I'm just glad I remember 2 things.

The consensus once everyone was finished was a meal well done. For the price, it's a steal of a deal: Great ""strip-quality"" food at an off the strip price. 

I will DEFINITELY be back with my mom and sister in tow.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,2,2,5,fPBafWCGQir5X13qDq34Qw

We started with the chicken nachos.  The chips are thick cut, served fresh, good seasoning on the chicken.  The love the melted cheese all over the chips.  We loved these nachos so much, we're still talking about them days later.

We were told about the specials and decided we both go with one.  I got the ahi tuna, with garlic mash, caramelized onions, roasted veggies, with a ginger sesame glaze.  This was so good, I wanted to lick the plate.  My tuna had just enough sear and with the glaze, it wanted more. 

My husband got the wienershizel, with speazel, beer gravy and red cabbage.  I love red cabbage, this was great.  The pork cutlet was thin, breaded lightly and golden brown. He enjoyed his just as much as I did. 

Of course one look at the desert  menu and we had to go with the chefs indulgence, cheese cake rolls, mini bite molten brownie, banana foster bites and vanilla ice cream.  It was so good, we wished we had gotten it for two instead of just one, I was trying to save us some calories, oh well, there is always next time!

Good service, good food, great prices, and a chef that cares, what else could you ask for, right?",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,3,0,5,Mr3nlw50ZegXYkCwmR6Kcg

However, the reason for the 4 stars is the simple fact that the gentleman who greeted us from the bar and told us about everything was very friendly and couldn't have been nicer. We'll definitely be going back on another night to try out the food.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,0,0,4,4EwYwfaSeEnYEtkXYb9OpA

My husband and I got burgers, cooked exactly as we asked, my daughter got the special--chicken fettuccine alfredo with  portobello mushrooms--of course also sampled by her parents :), and it was savory and delicious. I'm excited to go back and try new dishes,  because I can see Chef Carlos is a man that loves to cook, and wants to create a great experience.",JzWi9-DgRitg6hopsEK4yQ,1,0,5,u4FOBXgCve0cMh0mw0kH9Q

The presentation of all the dishes was beautiful, looked like something u would get at a fine dining restaurant and play over 25 for a dish, but surprisingly all the dishes on the menu here are less than 15 bucks. I also got a daily special which was a salmon penn pasta with six salmon slices, with tomato alferdo sauce, tasted so good i could easily finish two bowls of those and it only coast 8.99. This place is definitely going to be one of my favorite places to eat from now on.",U57tEkjNpqlFCEEPRbx4DQ,2,1,5,HK7pVva0m7TEMUFRt87jFw

Ribeye and steak Salad were ok, nothing special. Buffalo Chix wrap was gross. Buff sauce was way salty and overpowering. I couldnt finish it. Good fries. Nice service.  but I dont think I will be back unfortunately.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,1,0,2,KOWEdxEnLBjWOXy6egshKQ

5953306,2014-02-15,2,Lw9EBaDVg5R36dIE6N2oqw,"Went there just now, based on the Yelp reviews. We were the only people on the restaurant side, which was weird, didn't think they were open! Service was perfect, food was not bad at all, but nothing outstanding to recommend. The fries and the nachos with chicken were the best part, the Reuben was my least favorite - they do it with cubed corned beef, and small cubes, at that. And not many cubes. So it lacks the hearty bite of a great Reuben, more like a ""Hot Pocket"" consistency.
Overall, it was clean but loud (the sports fans and jukebox in the bar next door are perfectly audible, since there is no door dividing the two, just an open archway). No big deal, but far from ""romantic"", if that's what you're looking for.
Again, it was just ""meh"".",crL0l0Jq2s9E3AudnsUzvw,2,2,3,Hxw0Srgci6xlnrY_osAm7A
