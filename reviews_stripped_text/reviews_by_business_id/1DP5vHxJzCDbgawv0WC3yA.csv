23194,2014-05-16,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I was in Vegas several days to see shows, visit friends, and casino hop.  I had heard about this ""show"" or shall I say ""experience"" in the press and thru mutual friends.  I was looking forward to a great/unique evening.  The space is very unique, chic chic, glitzy and smoky with piped in smoke for the oooh/aaah ambiance.  It's an impressive entry and first impression.  There are three shows with different content in all three.  I stayed for all three.  Booze is pricey.  In fact everything in that hotel is pricey. Martini's $24 bucks.  
Now.........here we go.........my biggest complaint was the show.  I have seen numerous Cirque shows, cabaret shows, dinner theatre shows, etc.   This is not my first rodeo as they say.  This show or should I say all three shows lacked direction, had no punch, the talent was mediocre, the comedy was basically non existent......in that I didn't laugh but maybe a couple of times.  Some performers were phoning it in (Piff the Magic Dragon) others were just plain dull.  The calibre of talent was that of  those auditioning for America's Got Talent........except that they don't.  Actually, I might be being a bit harsh.  I think the talent could be better if it were for a much better director.  They tout this as a speakeasy, interactive experience, but it could have been a fantastic experience.  Instead i found it to be lukewarm at best.  The show and talent do not rise up the impressive club surroundings itself.  
Pricey, underwhelming, and not worth the hype.  Save your $$.",DnpIewa79u6a8yvcnwroSA,1,1,2,cy7ux3Qwbx1qlxOz85KVyQ

The food was EXCELLENT as always, and good value for money. The shows blew us away, especially the singers and the band. They're really are crowd pleasers. We have a birthday in our group and were presented with the most elaborate looking and best tasting desert I ever saw or tasted. 

This place is an absolute MUST do. We chill continue to come every time we visit Vegas. The food is the best, and the shows are different every time. Staff are knowledgeable and friendly and the cocktails are the best in Vegas.

All of the entertainers were awesome and really do a great job at interacting with the crowd. We didn't have dinner but I can say drinks were pretty expensive but hey its the Cosmopolitan, it's expected. 

The only issue that we had was how inconvenient it was to get out of your seat. We sat in the padded bench seating area and the chairs infront of us were so close that there's no way a shorter person would be able to see over the person in front of them. It was also such a pain to get past people to go to the bar because you basically had to step on all the people in your row just to get out.

64995,2017-03-04,2,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"We were planning to try for dinner, but discovered that afternoon that they offer some happy hour specials from 6-7, so we decided to go early to get in on some of the specials, hoping to try more of the menu this way.

The hostess was inexplicably rude and unhelpful, but we made our way into the craft cocktail lounge (which at 6:15 PM had only a couple of folks in it-- not too surprising), and our server/bartender April was awesome. The space was beautiful, the china and flatware lovely-- lots of attention to small details. In the craft cocktail room, you can also peruse a selection of vinyl to play on the record player.

We each had two cocktails from the happy hour options, and they were great. We tried several of the happy hour food choices (smaller tastes of some regular menu options) and were very pleased by all of them. We got the fingerling potato poutine, endive salad, short rib stroganoff (VERY small portion for the $15 price point, but it was so rich and delicious that we didn't care!), brioche with butter, and Brussels sprouts with chicken skin and sherry gastrique. All the servers and runners were friendly, and food came out to the table quickly.

All in all, we spent about $75 for five small plates and two pairs of cocktails. Definitely worth it!

There is a band that performs about 40 minute sets on the hour in the other bar, so we left and came back, hoping to catch the next set. The same rude hostess ignored us again, but a second hostess said that the bar area was open seating so we could go right in.  We sat down at a small table in the corner and were informed that it was reservation only, despite what the (much nicer) hostess had told us. It's only open seating AT THE BAR, not at the tables IN THE BAR. The bar was completely full, so we had to leave, which was a disappointing ending to a pretty great evening that left a bad taste in our mouths.

Four stars for great food and service in the cocktail room, one star docked for confusion and unnecessary side-eye from the first hostess.",yPv_UqK41aaKPw-7oPAnnQ,1,1,4,-pMGdlTFlAc4Hu1bkkecuA

89334,2015-07-02,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"My husband and I had the good fortune to visit Rose Rabbit Lie on the 2nd night it was open in December a few years ago and it was love at first sight.  We were there for the Vegas Nocturne show and were huge fans--we saw it four times before it closed down six months later and were heartbroken, but were still so glad that they were keeping the place open for dinner.  We celebrated last NYE there with a dinner that was to die for and the entertainment was top notch--they had brought in a whole show starring Desi DeLauro (sp?) for three nights and we saw her on the 29th and then came back and saw her again on NYE because the show was so great.

The performance space that they have right now sits vacant in the back and we are crossing our fingers that they will find something that is the right ""fit"" for the club and bring back a show because it's such a beautiful space.  Each room is unique and classy and the speak-easy style that is the running theme shows in all of the little details down to their cut-crystal glasses.  We LOVED ordering a flask of alcohol that came in the coolest glass flask with the RRL logo that we got to keep!  It's just those little things that make this place outstanding.

While there for drinks this last trip we enjoyed the live band and the singers, tap dancers, and the over-all ambiance that is like NO OTHER in Las Vegas.  Believe me, I know--I have been to Vegas over 100 times in the past 10 years and this place is in my top 3 for taking people for dinner and entertainment.  It's unique and special and I love to watch the look on people's face that I bring here for the first time.

We were able to talk to Brian ""Mac"" Mcatee who is the production manager for the entire place and he was so awesome to take the time to sit and talk with us and answer questions about the possibilities of bringing some sort of permanent entertainment back as a show (they are working on it--fingers crossed!) and the production that he oversees every night has the greatest talent.

Then I discovered that we were among the handful of people who actually had to pay to get in, which was kind of a gut punch as cocktails are tremendously expensive.

A very interesting stage show, some of the players interact with the audience, but the price point is very out of proportion to the actual performances.

If you're amongst the lucky majority that received a complimentary admission, go take a peek but I heavily suggest avoiding this place unless you smoke $90 cigars lit with $20 bills.

The performance art was entertaining and the interaction with the audience brought out a ""third dimension"" to the show.  Think of well-dressed street performers, a little bit of ""Tap Dogs"", a little ""Blue Man Group""-ish.

I don't want to say it's a rip, but it's certainly priced for the Romanovs and not exactly worth the tremendous entry fee, especially when most of the club seemed as if they were there on comps.

Feeling a little jaded and, well, financially leeched.

It's a stage show and then a standard night club. If you morphed the marquee with a sprinkle of cabaret and a very light touch of Cirque du Soleil, drop $300 for a couple, there you have rose rabbit lie.",OPiV-yNPoLf57J1OWUdylA,7,2,2,dUxHemd2a1rKz1FpkS6zIw

So since it has been talked to death on Yelp, I'll try to keep it to the point.  

-Food and drinks are expensive, be prepared.
-It's true that it's Absinthe Lite, or at least the 8pm show.  Less profanity (which I wanted more of, actually) but there are still really great performances.
-Wander around, talk to the employees, find out cool things about the place.
-Stick around after the show to watch performances at the bar.
-Ask where the study is and have a drink there.  They offer the full drink menu as well as a couple you can only find at this bar.  Locals, if you are familiar with the Laundry Room when it first opened, you'll be happy to see Jun working here!
-Keep yourself ready for surprises....you never know what kind of crazy things you will see!

The drinks are really good and not that terribly priced for the Strip.  I asked for something boozy and my bartender made me just that - let's just say I was laughing a little too hard at Mr. Piffles during the show.

Also, we ordered a couple of the veggie items from the menu (Fennel Salad and Curry Cauliflower).  I really didn't think they were worth the price.  The portions were small (think tapas) and they had too much going on.  Next time, I'll spend the money on another drink.

271801,2014-02-14,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Details of the Vegas Nocturne show have been sufficiently covered in other reviews, but I will simply say that the show is hilarious and highly entertaining with a diverse, talented cast.

Comparatively speaking, I think the tickets are about 35-50% overpriced for the entertainment value provided, but the room is quite small with a limited schedule so I can understand that the tickets may need to be priced such as to cover expenses of the production.  I would definitely see the show again, but only via discounted or comped tickets.

Far more concerning is that the drinks in both the bar area and showroom are also about 35-50% overpriced.  In my case, one round of only two drinks (a Bombay Sapphire martini and a single Jameson neat) was $40, plus tip.  WAY. TOO. MUCH.  Offensively too much.  That was the most I've ever paid for a similar round of drinks in all of Vegas.  

Prices this high pretty much guarantee that Rose. Rabbit. Lie. cannot maintain a loyal local customer base, but rather will be limited to mostly tourists and locals splurging on special occasions.  I would love to drop in and hang out in the bar whenever I was at the Cosmopolitan, but those kind of prices will prohibit regular visits.

As for entertainment spilling over into the bar and restaurant area, that was a lot of fun to watch. However, since the bar and restaurant is sort of a backstage area, random short bits of music from the show is all you can hear while Vegas Nocturne is going on - this area is otherwise absent of music during that time - so that is quite annoying.  Having seamless and continuous music throughout the bar and restaurant during the main show definitely needs some work.

I can't comment on the restaurant or food, except to note that the menu is filled with fancy shmancy nonsense such as caviar and bone marrow. Not my cup of tea, nor within my desired dining budget.

I give the bar and show three stars now, but with lower cocktail prices, possibly lower ticket prices, and better management of music in the bar and dining rooms during the shows, then I'd have no problem giving five stars.",AjOXGFfe6FPKvOKvGpGniw,2,0,3,wEsGVh4feFNy1eykWjH6pg
272617,2017-03-20,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"What can I say about this place? We stumbled across it while heading towards the buffet and knew I had to make an effort to dine there the next time I was in Vegas. 

Rosé. Rabbit. Lie. Is a modern supper club...a dinner and a show...something of a dying breed of establishments. A throwback to 40s & 50s, it's a modern twist on a classic tradition. They have an elaborate selection of modern interpretations of classic cocktails...including the use of clarified milk. The wine list...wowzers. If you can't find something on there you don't belong near a wine glass! I opted for the Sezarac...an adaptation of 1950/Langford old fashion...it was pungent and powerful and the absinthe rinse really set it off!

The food is served ""tapas"" style...meant to be shared; The portions are a bit smaller and guests are encouraged to order a few things for the table. The short rib poutine was my favorite of the dishes we chose. Short rib, fingerlings and cheese...how can you go wrong? I've heard great things about the caviar tacos but I wasn't brave enough to try them!

The desert menu included a tapas style dessert called the chocolate atrium...which includes various chocolate delight served under a giant glass dome...the presentation looked fabulous...the apple butter cheesecake jumped out for us and we opted for that. We were not disappointed!

And now...the icing on the cake...the entertainment! This is the real reason I wanted to come here. Every night, about every hour or so, they have live entertainment which includes a 4 piece band, singers and dancers...this is what sets this place apart. These musicians and dancers and true entertainers, engaging and entertaining the entire room.

I can't wait till the next time I'm in Vegas and can come back to Rosé. Rabbit. Lie.",U8uZXGIK4R1akCLpHUD_Rg,0,1,5,bM0qWF5E5AAyT3Gjve4gKg

They had 2 singers, one was not that great, the other ""Aretha Franklin"" type was very good.  There was a tap dancer and kid doing some hip hop dancing.  Very loud with the live band, but entertaining nonetheless.

The food was average, but grossly overpriced.  $24 got 3 scallops.  3 average sized scallops.  I was glad I had snacked on chips and salsa before our reservation.

Our server was terrible.  We were seated near the band (very loud) so I pointed to what I wanted on the menu.  Out comes a plate of oysters, which I did not order....cannot stand them.  Our waitress comes back with the plate after I sent it back, and proceeds to argue with me about ordering it.  She handled the situation very poorly...what's it to her?  If it had been incorrect but something I'd still eat, I would have just kept it.  But I do not like oysters at all, I definitely wouldn't order them.  She also was one of those servers that asks a question, but then basically runs away before you have time to answer.

The bad service tended to overshadow the rest of the evening.  Overall a cool concept, but they could definitely use some fine tuning.  With all the great restaurants in Vegas, I'd definitely skip this one.",3trN7ayCwXNcHBA9M0kIDg,0,0,3,O10UW_Aq9MjaOco-n70P1w

370535,2014-02-24,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"First off let me begin by saying I'm the CEO of Party Tours here in Las Vegas so I know nightclubs. I went to see what all the buzz was about with my wife for our 10th wedding anniversary.  We had a one bedroom suite at the Cosmopolitan overlooking the fountains which was top notch so we were juiced on having a great night.  Rose Rabbit Lie did not let us down and in fact blew us away.  We went to the 10:00pm show and then had bottle service once it opened up into a nightclub.  Here is what we ventured into.  First I will start off with the door staff - Most Nightclubs the guys at the doors are so stiff and have no time for a sense of humor but I actually had a few laughs talking to them prior to going in (Again - this will not happen at any other nightclub in Vegas unless you have 5 hundreds flashing) We were then escorted to our seats which I have to say were bigger and more comfy then say Cirque De Soleil or another show like that.  Now for the entertainment.  At first I was thinking ""Oh great this is going to suck"" but the show is designed that way to suck you into it.  I was blown away by this lady who came out and beep boxed like nothing you have ever heard.  I had to keep looking over at the mixer board to make sure the sounds were actually coming from her and not some inserted technical magic but it was 100% all her and she received and deserved a standing ovation.  I know they change things up with different acts but this night I saw what had to be hands down the best tap dancing duo ever. These guys tapped danced to hip hop and created a sound that was well incredible.  There was so much talent there that I cant describe everything but I have in 1 day send over about 20 people to buy tickets for this show because I want them to have fun and not only that I know few personally.  That's the downside of living in Vegas is you have every friend you have ever know call you with them or their friends coming to Vegas but on the flipside its also the best part.  You always get to see friends that move away because everyone comes back to Vegas. Anyways, I know the owner, manager, my waitress, the door guy may be reading this and I wanted to say thank you to everyone at RRL for showing us the most Epic night we've had in a long time.

It is diff cause it's hollow to take in more flavor but it was a bit more stiff and I'd like more chew. The black pasta with egg on top was my fave however.

An homage back to vintage Vegas with a modern twist where you can have classic dishes and cocktails while watching and listening to amazing entertainment. Beef Wellington, Shrimp Cocktail, Beef Stroganoff, Crab Louis and even Bananas Foster (done table side)! All must haves!

While the food and drinks are amazing, the entertainment really puts the icing on the cake! Three singers, a full band, a tap dancer, breakdancer and pop & lock dancer will have your head spinning because the come out of nowhere and provide one of the most memorable experiences that you can experience in Las Vegas. 

Start the evening off in The Study which is a hidden speakeasy inside the restaurant. They have an an awesome record collection where you can choose what you want to listen to while you are sipping on some of the coolest craft cocktails you will find. They even have new albums on vinyl.

If you are looking for a amazing dinner or a cocktail at the bar while watching the entertainment you can't go wrong.

This isn't a quiet place, but it's not meant to be, but you can request to sit in an area that is away from the band if you want a quieter spot. 

I love this place and will be back again and again!",0r2a6uMYvxKfYelfNtaCwQ,0,0,5,Qzsw3Sg7fZwidMBdxZnu8A

We were so happy to have found this jazzy joint, because it was everything we were looking for. The drinks are dynamite. I was pleasantly surprised by the food - we had oysters on the half shell, black tonnarelli, and the pot a pho. Everything was beautifully prepared and very tasty. The decor was exceptional. The entertainment was, of course, the best part. The live band did a fabulous job and all of the performers were truly talented.

615900,2014-03-03,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,Wow... What a disappointment!  Save your money...  The drinks were good but VERY expensive -greater than $45 for two cocktails.  The ambiance in the bar was interesting and different.  Even the talent in the bar was good.  But DO NOT waste your time on the show.  We discussed leaving half way through but we were holding out for it to get better.  Guess what... It got worse!  The talent and the type of show reminded me of a high school production.  Dinner was OVERPRICED and mediocre.  Definitely not worth the $250 ( for 2).  Service was not good.  The wait staff had too many tables but there was additional servers.  Yet food arrived cold on a couple of the tapas.  Oh yeah!  Careful the 15% gratuity is added to the bill without us being told.  Overall what we thought was going to be a night to remember turned out to be a night we want to forget.  Total cost of the evening greater than $550.  Value $50.  Save your time and money. Btw:  this is my first time writing a review for Yelp.  But because the experience was so bad I needed to share it.,0mHpN2TH9CzryXKTY3SWzw,1,0,1,kmnp1kH00MZ7zSQlmNXXYA

618861,2014-03-01,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"ANIMAL LOVERS - TAKE NOTICE! One of the acts in this show includes a sweet chihuahua. Until that act came on, I was enjoying the show and would gladly have given it 4 stars. 

However, this act ruined the entire show for me. ""Piff the dragon"" makes his dog Mr. Piffles do some 'tricks'. The way 'Piff' handles the dog (roughly, and sort of bouncing/shaking him around at points making him 'dance'), and the things he has this dog do, are unkind at best. I'm sure he doesn't intend to be 'unkind', per se, but he clearly sees himself as doing a 'good' thing by 'rescuing' these animals and then making them do 'tricks' in a loud (and uncomfortable, possibly scary) environment. I find this inhumane and disgusting. 

How do I know about his attitude regarding these dogs? Well, I did my due diligence  (with the hope that I'd found out something that would make me feel better about the whole thing - I was wrong). At the bottom of this Yelp review, I've cut/pasted his comments from a  ***VegasSeven interview (link from Rose Rabbit's Facebook page). 

--------
Sidenote: The balance of the show would have received my wholehearted enthusiasm, had it not been for this. I'm surprised (disappointed?!) that no one else on Yelp has objected to this ridiculous and unnecessary act. Oh, but there was the woman in the front row who screamed at the guy 'You're an asshole' multiple times, and was ultimately escorted out of the theater. I probably should have gone with her, but I wanted to support the balance of the actors, many of whom were talented and were clearly working so hard to entertain the audience. I truly applaud acts such as the first woman (balancing the sticks/bones); the  two 'couples' (one was quite acrobatic, the other was a clever lip synced mashup); the bathtub dude; the final lovely contortionist, and everyone else who really put their heart in to their craft. 

So, I'm sorry to say that until I learn that they have permanently removed this act (and do not replace it with another one involving animals), my score for Vegas Nocturne will remain at one star. 

--------
***From the Piff the Dragon interview: 

http://vegasseven.com/2014/02/27/seven-questions-vegas-nocturnes-piff-magic-dragon/

""Also, Las Vegas is a big Chihuahua town. A lot of them here. A lot of abandoned ones, but at least Las Vegans love them enough to get them in the first place. And that means there are a lot of duplicates, so if [my sidekick] Mr. Piffles ever gets sick, I can just drive out to the I-15 and get a barrelful.""

So Mr. Piffles is easily replaceable?

""See, here's the thing: When you rescue a dog, what I found was that they're so beaten down by life that anything else is a good option. So when I told him I wanted him to do card tricks, he said ""no problem."" He ran out and read some books. Studied with the greats. That's what I respect about him. He puts in the work.""

681499,2017-11-11,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I was in Las Vegas this past weekend with my girlfriends and i had the chance to visit this unique restaurant. I will break down this review in parts, so that what is most important gets mentioned and the people who want to visit know what to expect :)

The Food
 3.5 stars: The decoration of the dishes were great, they look beautiful; and the plates in which they were serve really si some of the prettiest china that i have ever seen, however i expected more from the flavors, they were good but honestly nothing really outstanding. i have been to many celebrity chefs restaurants and i know what to expect from the quality, flavor combination and textures.

The Service
5 stars: We were seated right away, even though the restaurant looked quite busy which is always nice. Our server was truly fantastic, his name was Manni i believe, im not sure if i was just lucky to get the best server or something but he really made us feel special that night. He was dressed super nice and his personality was charismatic, sweet and professional. he recommended the prettiest drinks! one that had a bird shape for my friend who wasn't sure what to get by saying that he had snapchat material drinks or something funny like that, when he change our plates he brought plates printed flowers and said that we all deserve flowers and he had brought some for us ladies, that they were there that we just needed to find them, it was awesome when we finally notice the printing on the plates :)  in addition to that on other little details  his service was super spot on and profesional, truly felt like we were at a top fine dining destination.

The Show
5 Stars: It was awesome, it felt nice that it doesn't matter where you are sitting down the show kind of goes al over the place, which is decently worth mention in this review. also they were different kind of performances break dancing, tap dancing, different singers.... one the reasons why i give it 5 stars for this is because the show is actually interactive, they mingle with the customers and one of the singers did with one of my friends; she got so nervous but we loved the pictures that came out from that moment.

Conclusion:
This place is awesome! it was totally an experience, what the food was missing definitely gets made up by the show and the service! i recommend asking for manni he is the best server i ever had in a restaurant. I also recommend to come on a kind of a party mode, to order drinks and go out to the club after this is the perfect place to start your night with!",mkaVtG8KywO8LP6A3kmBeQ,0,0,5,zlZt9nANw6R94DLwFscZQg

692897,2014-04-12,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I had originally bought a $30 ticket to see the midnight show of Vegas Nocturne (standing room only), but luckily I got a promotional offer for two complimentary tickets, so I used them to see the other two shows at 7:30 and 9:30 as well. I watched all three shows back to back.

The first two shows were quite good, with my favorite being the first one -- it had more circus-style performances, whereas the second show had more rhythm/beatbox and dance performances. I found the first show a little funnier and more engaging, although both were entertaining, and both shows had a different set of acts, with no overlap between them. I'd give 4 stars to the 7:30 show, and 3.5 stars to the 9:30 show (rated as if I'd paid full price for the tickets).  For the 7:30 show I sat in row E, which is the first elevated row -- it has an excellent view, but the chairs in this row are folding chairs, so you give up a bit of comfort.  Each show lasts about 90 minutes. Oh, and don't expect any storyline to these shows -- they're mostly a series of unrelated acts.

I expected the midnight show to be similar, but it had only about 30 minutes of acts, with some repeats from the first two shows, and then they opened the floor for dancing. I stayed another 30 minutes and called it quits. I give the midnight show only 2.5 stars, even though it was ""only"" $30 for a standing room ticket.

There is no real way to describe or emote what this experience is like.  Definitely do dinner and a show, I recommend watching both first and second show.

My sister is very adventurous and asked our waiter if we could give him a dollar amount and he bring us out whatever he wanted us to try. While I know this drives some servers crazy, Patrick was game. He took down our restrictions, and created an amazing tasting menu for us. We started with the Brioche bread. It was so delicious I could have stopped there but we had only just begun. Next came a roasted Octopus which was melt in your mouth tasty. Also Oysters Rockefeller which melted on the tongue and Lobster cocktail, a zesty refreshing treat. Just amazing. Each flavor complimented the next.  Next came Steak tartare with a crispy cornichon (similar to delicate pork rind but not pork). Amazing. But we didn't stop there. Bone marrow left us speechless. Spread on the bread with a light sprinkling of the salt provided and it blew us away. After all of this flavor we were not prepared for the meat dishes that followed. First, the short rib stroganoff was so tender it fell apart as we ate it and so full of flavor our eyes crossed.  Next came the lamb. In my family we take our lamb very seriously and this was perhaps the 2nd best lamb any of us had ever eaten (1st place goes to our Grandmother's of course)

Did I forget to mention the Brussel Sprouts? I despise Brussel Sprouts and I wanted to order a second round of them. Roasted with a mild balsamic flavor and other herbs I could not begin to imagine and my slimy childhood torture became a new favorite.

There are many things we tried that I would never have ordered but am so glad I did. My eyes have been opened to new flavors and a new experience. I am looking forward to our next visit. 

Oh desert....  We tried the chefs special, a strawberry goat cheese concoction that was light, refreshing, and delectable. We also tried a delicious creamy dessert with pear crisps that was so good my sister bogarted the entire bowl. 

We paired all of this with a Pinot Gris and a Malbec from the wine list and were not disappointed. 

Entertainment: After we ordered, musicians arrived and began playing jazz. Around the arrival of our first course, a chanteuse appeared and walked through the dining rooms greeting all tables as she sang. She was amazing. As the evening progressed, dancers appeared and a male singer who had great pizazz. I have read complaints about the entertainment tax in other reviews so I asked about it.  Apparently the state has instituted a tax on entertainment and none of this goes to the restaurant or the performers so I accept it as part of the overall experience and frankly, if you are pinching pennies, this isn't the place for you. There is too much temptation. 

Overall experience: Amazing.",y7IJNeKsJiY7Wt0S9QvBqw,1,1,5,QCOTGVO9sRVAu0muhoZH-Q

About midway through dinner the dividers dropped In between the bar & dining area allowing everyone to enjoy the live jazz singer.  Being my birthday someone in my group had made the beautiful singer aware of this.  She walked over and serenaded me at the table, lots of fun.
We decided on bananas foster for desert which was prepared table side, also very good.  We asked for a tour of the place which was incredible.  So many hidden doors to different rooms (speak easy style)

They played great music between the band's set and when the band was playing, they had two different female singers, an awesome tap dancer and a great break dancer who was maybe 16yrs old.  The food was absolutely perfect. 
- I started with this cocktail called Down the Rabbit Hole - gin, carrot, ginger, orange, not sure what else.  Very well balanced. I felt like I was drinking a healthy spa juice.
- caviar tacos - literally bite sized caviar filled Yukon potato chip as a shell with citrus.  AMAZING.
- oysters Rockefeller - perfectly fried oysters sitting on a creamed spinach with bacon bits. So good.
- slow roasted octopus with lima beans, chickpeas and it had two different sauces - one was pesto-y and the other not sure - delicious.
- bone marrow - with toasted Italian bread - it came with seasoned salt and this topping of parsley, pickled white fish, capers and pickles - you're meant to spread the marrow on the bread, sprinkle some salt and then the topping.  The hubs kept raving about what a perfect combination it was.
- short rib stroganoff - it was more of a deconstructed version with a slab of the most tender short rib meat, with a sheet of pasta on top, some sliced fennel which was not as strongly flavored so The hubs loved it, and shallots and parsnip.  We chose between that and the lamb saddle.  The waiter recommended both. It was really good.
- The hubs actually wanted dessert because he knew it would not disappoint.  We got the lemon tart with toasted meringue and basil sorbet.  The lemon part was a little thick for me but the combination with the basil sorbet was perfect. 
- The dark chocolate dessert was DEVINE.  It came with chocolate mousse, chocolate ice cream, orange sorbet, a sheet of hazelnut chocolate that had some crunch in it like crispy rice bits, and brownie pieces.  THIS WAS AMAZING.
- We enjoyed our meal with a lovely Italian Brunello wine.

Just excellent ingredients and presentation of the food and drink. The entertainment was great too -- a jazz trio and female lounge singer.

Entertainment- The entertainment starts at the top of every hour and lasts for 40 minutes with a 20 minute break before the next act starts. The two singers that night really worked the room and were very entertaining and included the audience!

Food- We ordered quite a few dishes as we had not eaten much that day and were very hungry. I would suggest starting with the Brioche Rolls and trying a Caviar Taco. As others said, the Caviar Taco was very small but definitely worth the experience! For entrees we ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, Duck Pasta, Short Rib Stroganoff and the Grilled Octopus. All were amazing but the Grilled Octopus was quite burnt in some places so we could have done without it, but I would definitely suggest the other dishes as they were unlike anything we've tried in the past! 

Waiter- The only reason I will give this review 4 stars is due to the fact that our waiter was not very helpful when it came to suggesting drinks and food and he was almost too pushy at certain points of the meal.

We're still talking about it having just come back from the trip. First I will say, having one of the late dinner reservations made for an amazing personalized experience. We were seated in the front dining room next to the bar area, prime viewing for the entertainment. Ryan made a few suggestions on the menu and they did not disappoint, the French Onion popovers were light and airy with just the perfect combo of cheese and french onion sauces drizzled over. The Ricotta pasta might have been our favorite of the main dishes we shared. Creamy filled pasta with the just right amount of spice in the ragu. So good! I can't forget the drinks and desert! We had a bottle of the rosé which was a nice compliment to some of the spice. Ryan also treated us to a taste of a vintage champagne that was comp'd for a wedding party. I believe it was Gasto? Clicquot, dry yet a little buttery, amazing! If that wasn't enough we had bananas foster for desert, homemade banana bread flambéed at the table. I know I'm forgetting some of the other items we tried but trust me when I say nothing was less than delicious!

As a designer, I can zero in on a skewed picture or an out of place lamp. The interiors here are just impeccable, no detailed was spared. Ryan gave us a backstage tour of each room and little tidbits about the themes. There's even a full concert venue behind the library room. Then there are the secret doors in every room, weather they're just for fun like one above the stage for a performer to pop in. Or one connecting the front bar to the dining room, very fun.

Wait, the same performers who are performing in the show next door that I just paid $135 to see? And why is this a tax if it's not a government charge? Well, they're actually just charging you 10% more for everything on the menu without telling you, and taking the money. Really sleazy, in my opinion.

I purchased four tickets for the show after reviewing the comments on Yelp.  Also, through the reviews here, I purchased the 2 for 1 tickets on Living Social.  

After seeing the show, I am shocked by the disconnect between the reviews here and the show I watched.  The show was generally slow, unimpressive, and literally put me to sleep during a portion of it.  There really was no theme to the show as it is mostly made up of disconnected acts.  There's a woman balancing sticks, a guy walking on a wire, a contortionist, a guy dressed as a green dragon telling jokes that were not funny, etc.  One of the few positives of the show was a female singer with an amazing voice that was singing background for some of the acts.  I would have preferred to watch a show of her singing, then heading to the strip to watch acts just as good for a few bucks in tips.  

Regarding the four of us that watched the 8PM show on Sat. night, when discussed, the girls rated the show 2 stars, myself and the other guy gave it a 1 star.  I may have rated the show a 2 star, but given the overwhelmingly positive reviews posted here, I feel an obligation to downgrade the rating because I honestly believe many of the posts here are overly optimistic at best, and misleading at worst.    

Full disclosure:  I like the Cosmo as a hotel.  However, I am not a big ""show"" guy.  I think every Vegas show is overpriced, but I get that it's Vegas and you've got to pay to play.  Nevertheless, the bottom line is that I will not recommend this show to any of my friends and family.  I did not buy any drinks, but I have a feeling I would have been underwhelmed by those too.  I saw some people holding glasses and as one of the guys in my party pointed out, the drinks looked really small.

I'd like to mention that the waiter, after I inquired, gave me a menu that showed vegetarian and vegan options- that was cool.  The place is quirky with a cool bar area we waited in. They were out of 2 different beers that were on their cocktail menu. At dinner they were out of 2 different red wines the table wanted- all that is not cool at all. 
The ambiance is loud with live entertainment. We were seated in a room that was adjacent to a room with a little stage, and the entertainers sometimes flowed into our room and walked around. There were singers, tap dancer/singer, dancers, all with unusual talents and big personalities. 
Food: This is where they need to improve on some levels. The $15 caviar taco was kind of comical. It was the tiniest taco you could create and really can't be shared. The hard shell just crumbles and then it's a bit destroyed. The caviar flatbread was excellent, the lobster cocktail was excellent, the pork belly bites were great I heard, and the waiter never brought our brussel sprouts so I can't comment on that.  The meat eaters ordered a big roast. It came in a glass dome all smoked up inside and waiter carved it.  I had the salmon en-papillote that was very rich, and I was too full to eat much of it. The desserts were very disappointing. The bananas foster was supposed to be a little bit of a show but the waiter just brought a cart over with the different elements and heated already made sauce in the pan. The bananas went in and I never saw any flames, and that was poured over a firm cake- it just wasn't all that great and I expected them to make the sauce for real at the table. We watched him heat up some sauce- big deal. The smores was a huge disappointment. It was one smore in a glass smoke filled dome, which was cute, but it tasted bad and nothing like a real smore. It had a hickory flavor, which is off putting, and the chocolate & strange marshmallow was closer to a meringue. It didn't hold a candle to real smores.
I read that the menus were wax sealed, and I did see the wax seal on the menu but it was already ""unsealed"" by someone else. All menus at our table were like that, so I'm not sure if others on other days received actual sealed menus.

Over all the place was cool and fun, but the fact that many drinks were not available and some dishes were trying way to hard to be different makes me give the place 3 stars.

So, kudos to the staff for not giving me any crap like you'd tend to see at many higher-end places in the area.

Literally, every thing we ordered was good on taste (2 stars because food quality was good) but extremely unsatisfying and we ordered almost everything and kept ordering because we were trying to add up the dishes to make one whole meal.  Some ""dishes"" came out in pieces, one piece per person. Check out my pics.

Place feels cramped. If it wasn't for the food, I'd give this place one star. I guess you should arrive drunk to numb out the noise. It's just not my kind of setting. There was some entertainment that we could have done without. It was odd to have someone randomly dance on one end of this tiny place and then another performer singing her lungs out. For myself and the table, there was too much going on. It's pricey and I don't get it.  There's no organization to their madness.

Half of the people in this small restaurant seemed to enjoy the environment so I'm not knocking it or telling you not to go. Just want to prepare you for what you're in for. I enjoy entertainment with dinner but this was loud, crowded and confused (Friday night). Our group complained the entire time and we were wondering what Rabbit Hole we fell in to. Name suites the restaurant well. If it sounds like something you would enjoy, go for it!",JYvkqiTW9pCMRtZRRD6Vtg,3,2,2,zRhjyYqfMpXRapN3qHsxjQ

Dinner was an experience -  the band was impressive and played favorites from 70's - 90's.  The food was hit or miss.  The thumbnail sized caviar taco was tasty even if small.  The deconstructed beef stroganoff was a miss.  While the short rib was tender, it lacked flavor and there was no cream or noodle to boot.  I liked the Brussels sprouts; my friend didn't.

I enjoyed the guy who was tap-dancing, the singing ladies, and the one guy who was breakdancing, but a lot of the acts were in locations we couldn't see. I think maybe it's best to come for the bar and just for drinks, because there is a stage there.

We were still full from an unexpectedly big lunch, so we ordered five plates (four to share). My friend got the caviar taco, and she loved it. I'm not a big fan of it, so I decided not to shell out the fifteen dollars.

The steak tartare was very onion-y, but delicious. The accompanying chicharron reminded me of a more oily and savory shrimp chip. It paired splendidly with the rest of the dish. 

The octopus was overly charred. My friend wouldn't even touch half of it. I tried to salvage it by cutting off the outside. Totally not worth the price we paid. We should have brought it to the attention of our server, in hindsight, but too late now.

The scallops were very sweet, but at $12 each, I'm not sure...I saw three scallops in all the pictures we saw online, but we only got two.

The duck confit pasta was rich. But that time, we were forcing ourselves to finish the rest of the meal, but it was a lovely end.

It gives off this feeling of a secret bar, secret club that only those with secret passwords can enter (perhaps prohibition times).  There's live performances with a live band that filled the room with music while we were there.  The blue and purple litted room gave off a swanky type of feel with an old school vibe.  

We ordered the foie gras (delicious and generous in portion), duck pasta (excellent), white asparagus (good but pricey), caviar taco (good but pricey),  and mediterranean pizza (good and generous in portion).  Overall the food was good but depending on what you order, it can get pricey.  We ate an average amount of food since we were going to other places to eat afterwards so if you choose to do the full meal, it'll probably be two to three hundred for two people.

As other's stated it is pricey but if you order carefully it's not really too bad for special occassions.

1 moscow mule 
3 whiskey smashes
2 orders lobster cocktail - nice and full of meat but I didn't care for the sauce
1 rabbit fricasee - excellent
1 mediterranean pizza - also excellent
1 short rib stroganoff - not typical stroganoff but very tasty
1 chicken jidori - wife complained chicken was under cooked
1 almond joy dessert - wife enjoyed
1 smore's dessert - I thought it was tasty

We also got a free heart shaped sugar cookie for Valentine's day. We went early, around 6:15 so the entertainment didn't start until around 7 or 7:30. We watched the band perform, a couple of singers and a dancer. It was enjoyable. Service was pretty good too though the main waiter could have checked back more frequently.

chocolate ice cream- surprisingly this wasn't too sweet at all. I love the sweet and saltiness with the crunch pieces of chocolates. The drizzle of chocolate and the fresh lacquered orange rinds were the perfect combination!

After reading their menu, I wanted to try every single thing that they offered, however, since that wasn't going to be possible, I got the dishes that really stood out to me. 

I loved that the atmosphere felt very mysterious and dark. I also enjoyed the live music to go along with my birthday dinner!

We ordered the Glazed Brussels Sprouts with Manchego, Smoked Paprika, and Chicken Skin (8-10). Next we had the Steak Tartare with Worcestershire Gelée, Cornichon,  and Egg Emulsion (10-10). Next, there was the Short Rib Stroganoff with Herb Past and Roasted Maitake Mushroom (10-10). Following, we had the Roasted Foie Gras with Black Mission Fig Jam, Candied Pistachio and Brioche (10-10).

- Caviar Tacos: Hackle back Caviar/ Yukon Gold Potato Shell/ Hamachi with Russian Osetra Caviar (12-10)
- Caviar Flatbread: 63 Degree Egg, Bacon, Thyme (12-10)

- Cookie Jar: (On the house birthday special!)
- Chocolate Terrarium (the creamiest, crunchiest, most delicious dessert ever)

1412184,2015-11-02,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I feel like this concept has been redone over and over again, only to become a cheaper version of what it should have continued to be. 

I previewed Rose. Rabbit. Lie. during their first industry preview, roughly 2 years ago, and was thoroughly impressed with the venue.  The location and check in was the most bothersome feature of the experience, but the show, food, drinks (according to my friends) was amazing!  I remember being seated at a railing in a Vip booth, and watching the very entertaining show.  There was the girl on the ring (or a bubble?), some tap dancers, a comical hostess, and a very funny guy dressed in a dinosaur costume w/a dog.  I'm totally spacing on his name now.  I know he's become a sensation outside of his short act here, but he was the highlight of the show!  I remember laughing, being mesmerized by the acrobatics and theatrics, and feeling like this was a concept that could really work! 

I remember I ordered the Brussel sprouts that night because I just felt like having a snack. It was the most expensive plate of Brussel sprouts I ever had ($20), but it was sooooo good.  

I visited a few more times briefly (mainly to meet up with clients that I had setup for a dinner there). All of the feedback was really good.  According to my clients description of the acts in the show, things were evolving a little, but nobody complained that it wasn't worth the time there. 

The nightclub portion of the club never seemed to take off, but I think that's just because people who visit Las Vegas are looking to change scenery after dinner.  With marquee close by, it's difficult to compete...

Fast forward about a year, and I came in one night for a friends birthday dinner. We ordered a huge spread of food. The meal cost us about $1500 all in (about $150 per head). Everything was very expensive, but we tried so many things, I almost thought it was well worth everything that we got + most of them were boozing pretty hard. At this time there was a live band playing in the dining room and there were girls that would dance on the bar tops from time to time. It was a very interesting meal in terms of the entertainment, but it wasn't a total let down...just wasn't quite the same experience as my first visit.  Did they cancel the show?  Hmmmmm.  Who knows...that theater room didn't even seem open. 

I visited again about 3 weeks ago. We were the first to arrive of our party of 7, so we waited in the library room off to the side.  It smelled like a dirty mildew rag! I hate that smell!  I do like the vibe in there tho. There's a record player in the room where you can put on an album of choice (tons to choose from!). The service is good in there as we were approached several times about drinks.  I ended up with a sparkling water and my boyfriend got an old fashion.

As soon as the rest of our party arrived we were brought into the main dining room and offered a table right across from the bar & right in front of the live band. Waaaaaay too loud!  We couldn't even hear each other saying how much we didn't like the table. We asked the waitress if we could be moved further from the stage.  She escorted us 3 tables away to the back of the same room, but it didn't solve the noise problem.  It was just extremely loud and the table we were offered was very large so I don't think we would have been able to enjoy any conversation with the people across the table. It was hard to hear even the person next to me!  The other weird thing was there was 7 of us and they gave us a table with 3 2-seat benches. We tried to squeeze 3 of us on one of the benches, and it was very snug (none of us are overweight). Awkward.  We asked to be moved again. 

They brought us into the next room (behind the bar). It was at this point that I realized the speakers in the room were what was causing the place to be so loud. It wasn't the live band, it was the speakers projecting the sound of the live band.  It was still so loud, but at least this table was smaller so we were able to carry conversation across the table.  We stuck with it.  

We ordered several items: roasted beet salad, cauliflower, endive salad, beef tartar, scallops, jidori chicken, a flatbread, and the crew ordered the drinks in those souvenir flasks.  Everything was delicious.  I remember being blown away by the scallops, beet salad and beef tartar. The flatbread was the most boring dish but we ate it.  It wasn't terrible. 

Service was here and there.  Sometimes they were quick to bus things off the table, and other times our waters ran dry and we needed another set of silverware and couldn't find anyone.  

The performances were very loud.  The sound system in there needs to be toned down quite a bit.  I do have to say that their vocalists were all very good!  The ""show"" is not really a show at all anymore. It's short dance/singing snippets. Meh. Not sure it added anything to the experience. 

So, will I go back?  That's a strong maybe....",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,6,5,3,fqHp1QWgwk1LfoRd9Oqfag

Dinner is definitely a great culinary concept, with small share plates ranging from salads, stuff guyuer, to rabbit, to fio gra, to deviled eggs they make some super delicious dishes. 

And then there is the show, which is funny and amazing at the same time. Now I still here the absinthe show is a little bit better but the whole ambiance with it being like a speak easy and drinks makes this a different concept to me then anything else in Vegas.

My only comment would be that the house-made marshmallow either didn't caramelize properly or there was an issue with execution, it looked and smelled wonderful but the flavor just wasn't there.

After we ordered our food, a live performer came on and started singing covers from Michael Jackson and Imagine Dragons, and everyone was on their feet jammin out. Really love the atmosphere that this place brings. A night full of entertainment.

Let's get to the food....some of the best I've ever had. Each dish that came out was flawless and savory. RRL does their dinner tapas style so make sure you order around 2-3 dishes per person. 

Must Gets!:
Sweet Corn Royal
Seared Foie Gras
Hokkaido Sea Scallops
Banana Bread Pudding....OH and they cook it right in front of your table

Noms!:
Roasted Quail
Duck Confit Pasta
Short Rib Stroganoff

It's Good...But could do without:
Berkshire Pork

1444837,2016-03-06,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"This place was recommended to us by a co-worker who happens to live locally. We weren't sure what to expect, but we knew we wanted a fun experience, some good food but also be able to chat and drink. We got all of that and more. This place is fantastic. We arrived early, for Vegas standards, 7pm. We had decided no reservation, in case we wanted to try another place for dinner. We had our choice of seats from the bar and that's where we posted up. 

Staff: From the moment we walked in, the stage manager (Mack) and bartenders (Matt, John and Kasen) were extremely friendly and accommodating. We ended up spending 4 hours in this place and had the best time. Staff constantly interacted with us, asking questions and engaging in conversation, even when busy. We also asked them to be creative with cocktails, which they did amazingly.

Shows: The shows were fantastic. Singers/dancers/musicians were all wonderful. I felt like they had a great balance of performing and when they took breaks, the music was also great. It gave our group a chance to chat and catch up while waiting for the next act. 

Food: Two of us spilt three of the small plates: Brussel sprouts, which were to die for... The octopus which was perfectly cooked/seasoned and the porcini flatbread which was yummy but nothing too out there. I would recommend all three. Also, those three plates were plenty for the two of us. 

Highly recommend this bar, even if just a drink or two before dinner. It's definitely worth it.",vIkl7MSwSxV1DeWOunYJoA,2,0,5,1CS_UtX00_L-LX6k5dVLbQ
1444965,2014-07-07,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"We saw two shows during our week in vegas. MJ ONE at Mandalay, and Rose. Rabbit. Lie. at Cosmopolitan. I didn't know what to expect going in, but figured I'd get a ""Vegas experience"" here, and a ""Cirque experience"" at MJ ONE. This show was nothing short of amazing! 

Extremely pleased with the price of the tickets, seats, and vision/hearing to the stage. They perform right before your eyes, mingling with the audience as they go on (unscripted - see more than one to understand). The acts are all varied but carry the common theme of either impressive feats or raunchy comedy. You will love it, as long as you're not easily offended (prepare for potentially nudity, animal involvement, cursing, and sexual innuendo). 

If you want a truly vegas night, check this place out! Oh, and come back (free of charge) for the midnight show and after party. 

Also, if you're thinking dinner but aren't sure about the menu/pricing at the dinner portion of this show (as we were) I HIGHLY suggest Comme Ca over on the Strip side of Cosmo - its a few stories up with pleasant views of the strip and going on a fireworks night (we were on the fourth of July) is an - obvious- added bonus. 

I've heard they have good happy hour specials on their cocktails and some food. But if you miss that plates are $30/pp. Don't miss the steak & some drinks before seeing Rose. Rabbit.

1496588,2015-08-15,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"A group of 6 of us went for dinner, here are my thoughts. To enjoy the experience of the music show fully you have to be in the bar area, which is just PAINFULLY LOUD. That is quite unfortunate, when you are spending a lot of money on dinner. But wait, because it gets.. worse.

Food : Very over priced, and really mediocre. It was a huge disappointment. I cook better, and while my cooking is free there are of course some hidden fees, and undisclosed charges, if and when I invite you. **Disclaimer** We only ate from the tapas style menu sharing family style. None of us ordered a big entree. They advise something like 3 items a person, which is about $60 or more each, if memory serves.

I burnt my hand and got a blister from touching one of the bones in the bone marrow dish. There was no warning from the waiter that it was BURNING hot, and there was no other way to get the marrow out.

Really the food was bad. I think some of it was made by Chef Boyardee.

Drinks : Decent mixed drinks.

 Atmosphere : In the bar area the music show was awesome! The decor and setting really cool. The volume level from the speakers unpleasant, and actually painful. The live music, with the singers moving through the restaurant and engaging the audience (diners) is the reason to check this pace out.

Staff : Were really nice. They had the potential to be obnoxious due to the type of menu, and spin they put on the food. Deep down tho I think they know it's a rip off.

Conclusion. All said and done, we had a memorable and fun experience in the company of people we love and care about.",DpKBupB8p5Gr67rCPzGQ9Q,2,0,2,UKTXRBUUYcy8Gc-yYPo2NQ

The entrance looks like a speak easy and there's a juggler out front to greet  you. But bring a few bucks it isn't cheap.  They had a $1200 crab dish.

They sat us in the back so it was kinda hard to see the jazz musicians.  I guess you have to have a large party or get there early to get the primo seats. If I had gotten better seats I would have given this place 5 stars.

Note: They are in ""transition"" aka possible closure... so they blocked access to half the  dining room, we were only able to see half the stage.",pIuM0630qXEjAJ98PF3Urw,1,0,4,S9Cwt2AQ6D1VEJwHpTtQHw
1506003,2016-06-28,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is a place I won't soon forget. Walking up to the ominous doors with the low lighting and the restaurant name and logo lit by red lights...it's like something from a movie. When your table is ready, they walk you in and you pass sights that are overwhelming to the senses. Beautiful, extravagant people, ordering caviar dishes and drinking champagne, watching their servers pull apart their roasts for them. 
When you sit down, they offer multiple types of water and give you the menus. Our mineral water was offered for free on account of them not bringing it out in a timely manner, which was totally unnecessary but much appreciated.
We decided against ordering any alcohol, and luckily we weren't treated poorly because of that!
We ordered and shared the caviar flatbread, the Argentinian empanadas, brussel sprouts, and duck confit pasta. I didn't try the brussel sprouts because I don't like them, but of all the dishes, the caviar flatbread was the most disappointing. There was too little caviar and too much bread and cheese. It looks a little silly--I would actually feel better about paying the same price for a better-made, smaller flatbread, with the caviar more evenly spread across, rather than stacked in small piles.
The empanadas and the sauce that came with them were absolutely delicious. Crispy on the outside, flavorful, tender beef on the inside. The sauce was tangy, if I recall, but I remember it going well with the empanadas.
The duck confit pasta was my favorite dish. The cheesy sauce is rich and goes well with the thick, starchy pasta, the cooked spinach and the salty duck. Absolutely wonderful. 
We then shared the chocolate terrarium. It is surely a unique dessert, and fun to try once. However, if only sharing amongst two people, the chocolate quickly becomes overwhelming. It contains hazelnut ice cream, cookie crumbles, truffles, brownies, and various types of milk chocolate bars. It was like a creation by Willy Wonka!
Perhaps the best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere. Every 10 or so minutes, one of the various performers of the night will sing a song while walking around the restaurant, and include patrons in their performance. It fun, it's quirky, and the whole experience was one of our best on this vacation. Hope to return next time we're in Vegas!",m3VudXLzVbgMw1BWy7q4Ug,3,2,5,RbyWAsObMWCorbV4hb6hRg

1527580,2015-01-06,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"PHENOMENAL. So, so Cosmo - just the right amount of wrong ;) When in Vegas, it's usually buffets or drunchies for me so RRL was a nice change of pace. 

While we made a reservation, they were running late so they had us wait in The Study. Many of the drinks in there are ""exclusive"" to The Study, by the way! So definitely worth a visit. The drinks we had were one of the best I've had. I had Salt of the Earth (Tequila, Mezcal, Lime, Cucumber, Chipotle, Cilantro Salt). Very smokey/tangy. Loved it. 

But these drinks are Vegas-priced. To provide some perspective, at $14+ a drink, it's like ordering a plate on the menu. 

Upon finally being escorted to our table, they were mid-performance of this fantastic Vegas-esque man with ridiculously amazing sideburns and bell bottoms. He was climbing all over the tables, fixtures...very entertaining! 

As the servers will tell you, everything is meant to be shared here! We ordered a bit of everything from each section:

*Warm Bloomsdale Spinach Salad  (Grilled Shiitakes, Goat Cheese, Marcona Almonds, Soy Dressing): While I'm not a fan of Goat Cheese, this salad packed a punch of flavor! It could be too wet/wilty for some people's preference but pretty tasty

*Glazed Brussels Sprouts (Manchego, Smoked Paprika, Chicken Skin): I believe the Chicken Skin was supposed to add textural difference but didn't do much. I've had better Sprouts. Skip it! 

*Rabbit Fricassée (Vichy Carrots, Rose Petals, Beech Mushrooms à la Grecque, Sauce Zingara): First time I've had Rabbit and wow, it's really like Chicken! Great flavors and really hearty without being too heavy. Reminded me of a Ragu. 

*Bone Marrow (Sweet and Sour Short Rib, Green Apple, Mustard Fruit): For the price, this is a GREAT value. A lot of marrow and topped with heaping portions of Short Rib. 

*Roasted Foie Gras (Black Mission Fig Jam, Candied Pistachio, Brioche): Had to get this because we can no longer get this in LA. Also my first time having Foie Gras and it's like pure fat melting in your mouth. It's a little pungent/game-y without the bread but the pieces of pear it was a great refreshing complement 

*Caviar Taco (Hackleback Caviar/Yukon Gold Potato Shell/ Hamachi): Our server totally upsold us on this BUT I'm so glad he did. This was the PERFECT bite. The citrus-y notes with the meatier hamachi contrasted so perfectly with the salty caviar. However at $15 per taco, this is by far the most expensive taco I've had :) 

We also ordered the Paloma Pomegranate on Tap (El Tesoro Blanco Tequila, Pomegranate Nectar, Housemade Sparkling Grapefruit) - STRONG! But that's never a bad thing in Vegas right? Will be back to try the Moscow Mule on tap! 

Few closing remarks: 
*There's a LE (Live Entertainment Tax) that's more than Tax itself but I'd say worth it! 
*Faith & Flower in DTLA is RRL's sister restaurant but, I prefer RRL. However, I can't imagine this in LA....just maybe in Hollywood. Because they're sister restaurants, same Executive Pastry Chef.

1554534,2015-11-19,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Not impressed. My group of 5 really did not enjoy ourselves here. First, this place is LOUD. We were not even in the main room with the piano and we were legitimately yelling at each other across the table. It was not conducive to any kind of group conversation, you can only hear the people directly next to you.  

Second, this place is a fortune. I don't mind laying down some cash for a great meal (and yes, Vegas is expensive) but for what you get with your money here it is a complete scam. They say they are a tapas bar but I've never seen tapas like this. Call it what it is-- it's just skimpy  portions of food. Our waitress told us they recommend 3-4 tapas per person (and the tapas are approximately $25-35 a piece). We're talking well over $100 per person just for food, no drinks or appetizers. Also, our group was a bunch of ladies, I don't know how many small plates they would recommend for men...

When we got our food I could not believe how tiny these plates were. I get tapas frequently...this was just ridiculous. One little prawn is not a tapa. On top of that, the food wasn't even good! It was not terrible but for those prices I'd hope the meager portions they give out would be super tasty. Not even. We were very disappointed in the food which is sad since we were so heavily committed $$$-wise at that point. Additionally, if you aren't fond of red meat, pork or game, this place has very limited options. 

Moreover, they have a very disappointing wine list. Small selection and enormously over priced compared to other comparable restaurants in Vegas. 

We had 5 women, two glass of wine each and dinner and our bill was $700. What a joke. The food wasn't god awful but I'd certainly never recommend this place to anyone.

The shows are fantastic, we watched the 10 pm (long) one and the shorter midnight show the same night and each was completely different.  The show isn't a play, it's more of little vignettes where 1, or 2, or 3, or many people come out and perform a 10-minute bit.  Bite sized shows.  The entertainment can completely span the gamut from amusing to compelling to impossible.  One of the employees said we would have to see the show no less than 6 times to feel like we've seen all the acts.  

The ""SHHHH"" nature of Rose Rabbit Lie totally did it for me.  We had no idea what to expect and no one would tell us!  It's a restaurant, and a bar, and it's gorgeous, and there are private rooms, and it's dinner theater, and you ""have to go to experience it.""  And it's ""unexplanable.""  I want to keep that hype going for you throughout this review.

Yes the food is expensive.  All of the Cosmo's food is expensive.  But here you're not just paying for gourmet, you're paying for EXCLUSIVITY.  You're here because you want to feel like THIS IS HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVE.  And you do!  Check it out, each person's menu is only for that person, and then it is thrown away.  The menu is wax sealed on parchment and once you break the seal, it's your menu.  You may keep it or they will trash it.  The silverware is ornate and has an ivy design carved into it.  There are little pewter animals that come out with the tapas for you to rest your silverware on.  You can order anything, literally, anything - off menu, blend the entrees, and it will be prepared.  The design styling is DIVINE.  Every last detail has been noticed, agonized over, and purposefully placed.  And no one tells you ""no."" Wander anywhere you want, sit anywhere you want, I decided I wanted to meet Butterscotch, the fantastic beautiful beatboxer/MC and so she came down and took a picture with me.  I also met the ""twin"" boys who tapdance on your dinner table, they're actually cousins, I met their uncle as well.  Seriously, anything goes.

THE SHOW: I don't want to give anything away, and really mere words cannot do it justice.  Believe the hype and bring your pocketbook and prepare to have an unforgettable evening.  If you can't handle the prices eat somewhere else and come here for cocktails, or ORDER THE GARDEN DESSERT.

A little challenging to find but worth the effort.  Very good food and drinks.

I was with a group of 12, since this is more of a tapas menu the server suggested we set a price point / person and allow them to select the course.  We decided on 65/ person (we should've said 50 as this was too much food).  Everything except the B Sprouts (I just hate b sprouts) was great.

When my group first entered the bar area (separated from the stage), we were extremely pleased. Festive music was being played by a live band on a small stage to our left. People were drinking, dancing, and being merry all around. Great start to the evening. 

The stage area was semi impressive. It looks something like this.

Now for many acts, you can seat anywhere and get the same show as any one else, for other acts they use a screen and project images onto it and those sitting on the sides near the staging area can't see anything. 

There was also plenty of staff on the evening of our show, but no one ever walked by our group and asked if we wanted drinks (which we did). Every time we wanted something we had to squeeze out of our very tight seating and work our way to the bar. It was irritating. 

The acts however, were incredible. Rose.Rabbit.Lie does in fact attract some wildly talented people. A beautiful vocalist/beat boxer named Buttercup I believe, 2 young hip hop/tap dancers (this guys are insane), a woman that floats in and out of a suspended orb as though she's weightless, and a variety of other acts. For the most part the show itself is extremely entertaining. 

The after show was also a little frustrating. Apparently there used to be a private room, one that if you discovered, would host a most interesting after party. We found the room, only to be told it wouldn't open for another half hour, so we waited. We were then told that you needed to reserve the room before hand. We asked a server to double check, he told us we could go in, we would just need to wait about 30 minutes or so. So we waited, only to be told by another server that the room was booked up and we'd have to go. Lots of disorganization. 

I'd return to see Rose.Rabbit.Lie again, but I wouldn't recommend anyone else go until they've worked out the kinks in their show.",_1xH3x70kO1l17cYftaHqA,6,4,3,8NeV0xaFtKJSx6m6--qClg

1598131,2015-02-06,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Amazing food with French flair, great atmosphere, live music, and of course a bit of an Alice in Wonderland feel inside.

GOOD 1:  The decorations and visuals of this place are amazing to say the least.  It's like Steam punk meets Alice in Wonderland at a Jazz Club.

GOOD 2:  The food.  All the plates are ""small plates"" meant for sharing.  There's only 3 - 4 bites on each plate so you tend to order 5 - 6 plates for 2 people and you get a great sampling of just about everything.

GOOD 3: Live Entertainment !  The wall grids between the main dining area and the bar motorize down to reveal a Jazz band that plays throughout dinner service.   Whilst this is happening there are several different singers performing and a beautiful female juggler doing some visually fun stuff.

GOOD 4:  Take some home !  They have a few signature drinks that are served in glass flasks that are etched with the RRL logo.  The best part is you can take the flask home with you.  The flasks hold about 5 - 6 pours for a standard high-ball glass with some ice.  Oh... and the ice is a large solid block of crystal clear goodness that lasts all dinner long.  

GOOD 5: Wait staff.  This is a finely tuned machine when it comes to the staff.  Everyone working together and helping each other.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the food, had ready suggestions that weren't at all pushy, and was engaging when needed.

BAD 1:  Pricey.  This place is a 5 star restaurant for sure and has the price tag to come with it.   We had a light dinner for 2 with cocktails and our bill was $168 + Tip.  I hate saying price is ever a bad thing because we knew very well what things cost before we ordered, but it might be sticker shock for some so I mention it anyway.

Overall this place was amazing.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and especially the live entertainment.  This is definitely on my list of ""must go"" places to eat in Las Vegas now.  I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a great restaurant experience and fine dining.",Z4Q2qAL7fjr931r9qK9G7Q,1,1,5,rOJEepGmeCldUtilHF6_FA

A band played about 5 songs and then it was ""last call"" around 12:30. Is this Vegas? On a Friday night?

When the hostess takes you in to be seated, you are greeted with the lovely and modern decor.  The dimly lit dining room makes for a cozy and intimate dinner experience.  Our service was great with the attentiveness of our waiter.  His delightful demeanor kept our table happy for the evening.

I've only been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie before to see their Nocturnal show. I miss the show and their talented acts.  I was excited to try their dining side with some friends.  My husband and I started with their Herb Brioche Rolls.  I wish their rolls were complimentary like many places but you can't win them all.  They were delicious, soft and a great start for dinner.  

Next up is their Ancient Grain Salad.  This Farro Salad has shaved pecorino with toasted pistachios.  It was my first time trying this salad.  There seemed to be a citrus vinaigrette infused.  I loved the flavor and the texture of the salad.  The grains were almost quinoa like.  I enjoyed this.  

We split our entrees of Penne Pasta and Jidori Chicken.  The chicken was juicy but there wasn't any distinct flavor in this dish.  I wish the sauce they used gave it more to make it memorable.     The Penne Pasta wasn't like your normal penne noodle that you'd think.  It was almost like one long noodle that twisted up to make a mound.  The braised pork sauce had a great flavor.  I especially like the sheeps milk ricotta.  It was something different and unique.  

Of course when dining with L.C., we don't skip dessert.  I didn't go big like she did but I certainly enjoyed the Apple Butter Cheesecake.  This dessert normally comes with Cilantro Syrup but I asked to leave that off.  The description of the apples say roasted but mine were surely not.  It didn't ruin the dessert though.  The light cinnamon tasting crust of this dessert combines well with the apples and cheesecake.  It's very light and tasty.  

The lovely ladies providing the live singing were great entertainment during our meal.  I think that I'm getting to that age where I'd rather have a conversation during dinner and it was impossible to do with our friends.

We had an 8pm reservation and were immediately greeted by a friendly staff that took us to our table. The dining room was just starting to accommodate guests but quickly filled with a myriad of customers that provided a lively atmosphere in support of the jazzy performers singing velvet renditions of well-known hits. 
Manny quickly greeted us at our table and walked us through the menu with precision. He would go on to be one of the highlights of the evening. Quick, polite, attentive but not obtrusive and made us feel welcomed. His knowledge of the menu was critical and helped us navigate the delicious options presented to us. 
We each enjoyed the caviar tacos then our paths diverged as she chose the beef tenderloin and I selected the stroganoff followed by the signature Cod. We could not have been more pleased with Manny's guidance as the preparation, presentation and flavors were above expectation. I highly recommend requesting him as your server if you choose Rose. Rabbit. Lie; you are in capable hands!
On a typical night we would have enjoyed everything to this point and left extremely happy but enter Brandon Tebbe, Master Sommelier. 
It was a rare pleasure to be guided through a magnificent Italian Red, a port that was heavenly and a celebratory glass of champagne to close out the evening. Brandon is a rare breed; transparent, kind and an expert at his craft. I would, without hesitation, take any recommendation Brandon had in selecting the perfect pairing or bottle just because! 
Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is a great experience but exceeds expectation because of its people. From Manny's smart service through Brandon's exquisite guidance we could not have been more pleased. Add it to your list and enjoy the ride!",nh8RzEXu_Pb3gn8kNo6uMQ,1,0,5,clZbrdWARhvxNBxeYWNljA

Definitively a small plates approach, so if you are starving this could get super expensive, but everything we had was amazing - calamari with eggplant puree, steak tartare, short rib stroganoff, and the cookie jar for dessert (not going to tell you what's in the jar but we ate every single bit!).  Little pieces of the show spilled into the dining room throughout the evening, and at nine when the show ended the cast came into the bar area, the band played, the singers sang, and the show's ""characters"" brought some color to the dining room.

1674319,2014-01-24,2,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Location: Cosmopolitan= high expectations for me since this is my favorite hotel on the strip. Inside the Cosmo, I have to say it is a bit difficult to find but as long as you look for directions to the Wicked Spoon, it's right next door. While waiting to go inside, I noticed many people go up to the bouncers and ask if it was the Wicked Spoon, it was kind of funny actually because the bouncers showed them it's right next to it without having an annoyed look on their face. I can't imagine how many times they are asked that question, because the entrances are really too close together. 

From the outside you have no idea what to expect. There are big doors that you can't see in and get a peek what is happening inside. I have to say, I wouldn't know it is a restaurant inside if I did not read the reviews. It's not a restaurant in which you can walk up, see the menu posted, and see the seating from the from of it and ask the hostess to seat you. Later on I spoke with the manager and he told me you need reservations normally. It is not very ""inviting"" from the outside, so I am assuming they don't get many people just walking by wanting to come in, since you really can't tell what's behind the closed doors, giving it some mystery. 

There were about 8-10 hosts/guards standing outside and letting people in, making it feel exclusive to gain entry. When we walked through the doors, there was a room almost like a rotunda with more rooms with closed doors. We were led to the theater room. I was impressed when I entered. I liked the music, the small venue, the dim lights and there are 2 bars on each side of the round stage and seating area. The drinks were free but to me, very watered down taste and nothing special. I am hoping that the drinks everyone raves about in the other reviews are much better, because they are paying top dollar for those drinks. Since mine were free, I could not complain much. 

We get seated and the show starts, first with some comedy which I found offensive at times and just not funny at all. The acts, most were pretty entertaining and kept my interest. The contortionist (disturbing), dragon guy (annoying and not funny) his dog was the cutest part but it was also really sad as the dog was shaking and scared. The tightrope walker, walked and jumped, nothing amazing. The acts I did enjoy were the balancing act, hottie in the bathtub, fire girl, wine glass music, and the others. I don't think the acts amazed me, but it kept my interest to wonder what was next. 

Comedy -1 star
Venue/Concept/Intimate vibe/connecting rooms- 5 stars

I think if I had paid for the tickets, I am not sure it's worth the price I saw on their website. I am curious to try the restaurant even though it looks really pricey and supposedly the acts that are on the stage, those people wander throughout the bar/restaurant and do a little ""scene"" from whatever they did on the stage. I wonder if this is seen from the restaurant room or only the VIP area with the couches/restaurant area? I am curious about that. 

As I walked around, I loved the idea of different rooms and found them to be quite unique.  I did see the people who were up on the stage socializing after in the bar area. I am not sure if this is how it usually is or because it was the grand opening night.

In short yes it's expensive but what do you expect? It's Vegas and the COSMO! I ended up getting the lobster cocktail and the superrrrrr delicious bone marrow (it'a a must have!) Ended up spending well over $125 before tips on the meals and several drinks. For me? It was worth it! I probably would've ordered more if hadn't my date and I didn't eat a few hours earlier. During our food we also we treated to some performances at our bar... think Coyote Ugly with actual talent. 

As for the entertainment,  I decided to catch the 12 Oclock show. The midnight show doesn't have the full scale production of the early shows but I still loved it... probably slightly more. It's more raw, a little less cheesy with the acting and goes right into the super (and multi) talented performers. The performer in me really enjoys the collaborative aspect of performance... when Butterscotch (who I feel is the superstar of Vegas Nocturne)  the immensely talented Beat boxer/singer/beat maker  gets involved with the other performers it's a real treat. 


Again the tap dancers and table drummers always end up getting the crowd's loudest applause and even from me the second time. Just amazing acts with great showmanship. I seen a few new acts this time including the fire artist and the contortionist that shot an arrow in a ridiculous position. 

The update gets a new star because I really enjoy the entire premise of Rose Rabbit Lie and Vegas Nocturne.

The food wasn't as tasty as I had expected.  It was just- okay. Maybe it was what we had ordered but being a fine dining place, we expected every dish to blow our minds! 

Steak Tartare - Beef Chicharron, Cornichon, Savory Mayonnaise
It was good, but very small. 

Duck Confit Pasta - Spinach, Parmesan Cream, White Wine
This was the best dish in my opinion, the pasta was chewy and the sauce was mmm..so tasty. 

Pot au Pho - Filet Mignon, Beef Brisket, Foie Gras, Thai Basil Nage
Very underwhelming dish.  Was hoping for more flavors but it was very bland

Roasted Foie Gras -Harry's Strawberries, Black Pepper Streusel, Lemon Verbena
Again, i'm a HUGE foie gras fan and this was not the best I've ever had. 

I didn't feel like this meal was worth the value.  The service was great and the ambience was nice, but the food just okay.",HN2H8wkLcVPZqeACItUSNA,2,2,2,qI2AtoAqIQhtAX8GVBpPaA

Our reservation was for 11:15pm, after the Britney concert. When we arrived we were taken trough what looked like a ""secret door'. We sat right by the stage and were able to see the entire show. The show was very speakeasy feeling; all the acts were wonderful. Some people complain about the noise and yes, it can get a little loud but I was still able to converse with my friend.

The food is phenomenal as well. Dining works as tapas and are shared with the table. Our waiter was awesome and let us know if we should be ordering more or were ordering too much. He also answered any questions we had and gave excellent reccomendations. I definitely reccomend the caviar tacos. If I return (which I am sure I will) I would order more than one. The frog legs were also wonderful. The entire menue was very ecclectic and different; the only way I would not reccommend this resturant was people in your party are not avdenturous diners or picky eaters.

There is also a second bar which is thorugh a different secret door. It looks like a lounge and very 1920's with big leather chairs. We were not able to get a drink as it was closed for the night. I will definitley get a drink from there next time I go though.

1861976,2014-02-26,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"So it's a modern supper club, or better yet a Vegas supper club which is much much more.  My review is for dinner and the show,  and a friendly walk through of the rooms.  It's a little Alice in Wonderland,  a little Cirque du Soleil, a little Japanese game show,  and all Vegas.   No doubt,  it's entertaining and fits in nicely at the Cosmo.

I've been here twice, both for dinner and once to see the show from the bar viewing area.  The space is lively and robust, its multiple rooms creating a slightly disorienting feel and complete with sliding blinds to separate the main room from the entry bar area.  It's modern yet retro, I think that's the best way to describe it.

What you see may not be real.  The two guys in suits emphatically discussing the super bowl contenders did it for so long that eventually I caught on.  There's old school stuff and a little burlesque.

Dinner holds its own very well and changes fairly frequently if I use my two visits as a gauge.  Seared foie gras, then au torchon, bone marrow, wonderful oysters rockefeller and sweetbread are my highlights.  Consistent throughout.  There's a great wine and spirits list, and service is attentive and friendly.

It will be interesting to see how they keep it fresh and innovative, at the very least I hope to make another visit to find out.",t1iaOuRXk6oEW3vKt58wfg,2,1,4,OcZZeCRl1MJV92IhbCh3Vw

Only issues I had were they wouldn't substitute out the foie gras.  I agree that it should be illegal to serve tortured animals, so I tried to get something other than foie gras atop my appetizer.  No substitutions.  Fine, I get it.  Secondly, they kept wheeling dirty dishes around the restaurant.  Strange, and unappealing.  

Beef Wellington was hella expensive ($275) and took forever.  Over 45 minutes from when we ordered.  It would be fine if this place were conducive to dinner conversation, but it's louder than STK, but without the ambiance.

There are several cool rooms throughout the entire restaurant show.  We ate in the library and even got a little preshow entertainment which was cool.

The actual showroom is actually quite small but this makes it an intimate experience.  Drinks are also extremely expensive in the showroom.  We had great seats and could see the stage perfectly.  The show is very whimsical with a hint of comedy.

WONDERLAND?:  What's in a name?  And with a unique name such as this, one may not know what to expect once you check in for your reservation.  Much like Alice plunging down the rabbit hole into land of unique creatures and unexpected adventures, visitors/diners are treated to exceptional culinary delights and surprising/energetic/striking entertainment.

THE RABBIT HOLE:  Surely Alice did not know the adventures that awaited her in Wonderland.  Similarly, the closed doors at Rose. Rabbit. Lie mimic that curiosity, mystery, wonder, and intrigue.  We began our evening with drinks in a room that could easily pass for a speakeasy lounge.  The service was friendly, the craft cocktails inventive, and the mood relaxing.  

Oppositely, the vibe of the main dining room was lively, entertaining, and just downright FUN.  There was live entertainment during our meal and throughout the evening, as musicians, singers, and various performers took to the stage with their remarkable talents.  

TEA TIME:  Thanks to our server, we were informed that the dishes at are meant to be shared.  Collectively we ordered the caviar tacos, heirloom squash, scallops, duck confit pasta, and ribeye steak.  Firstly, if you're a lover or fan of caviar, do order the caviar tacos.  Being a novice when it comes to caviar, I'm unfamiliar with the types and varieties, but I can honestly say I did enjoy the caviar tacos immensely. 

Overall, all the dishes were superb.  I wish I could pick a favorite, but it seems that would require some degree of difficulty as my dining companion and I had only good things to say about our food.  I enjoyed every dish, and despite being quite full from the first four dishes, we made a gallant effort to finish off our ribeye steak, but to no avail.  Still, I can offer a bit of advice:  Trust your sever.  At our server's recommendation, we ordered the sea scallops, and as already mentioned, it was a dish we found to our liking very much.

PLAY:  I don't want to give away too much detail about the talent except to say the entertainers/performers provide extraordinary entertainment.  There was never a dull moment throughout the entire night, and just when you think you've seen it all, the performers pull another rabbit out of their hat so to speak.  Eat, drink, laugh, talk, and enjoy merriment!

LEGENDARY:  The service was of EPIC proportions surely.  Our server was a friendly and outgoing young lady.  The one thing that stands out about her, besides her good nature, was that she always had a smile on her face.  It goes without saying that our meal was an even more memorable and positive experience thanks to our server's knowledge about the menu, endless patience, and outstanding recommendations.  Despite being responsible for other tables, she always checked on us in a timely manner making sure things were alright, the food was prepared well, and just ensuring we were having a pleasant evening.

We had front row so we got to see everything up close. The opening wait was jaw dropping. The whole show was just fun. Had such a great time. We had dinner in the music bar after the show and enjoyed ourselves so much. Dinner is served tapas style which is perfect for me. We decided to order the tuna, calamari with chorizo, duck confit pasta, brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skins and beef stroganoff. We weren't impressed with the tuna. I love the calamari salad with squid ink. Hubby was not a fan at all. Our favorite had to be the duck confit pasta. It was just perfect. The beef stroganoff had tender short ribs with a mushroom puree that was divine.  Dinner (food only) was about $100. Not too bad for Vegas.

I loved the fun drinks. I had the pisco punch which had a nice pineapple taste. I also tried the monkey gland which had to be my favorite.  I think it was the orange foam and fresh lime zest. I think the drinks were a little pricey ($16 average) but they were strong. 

There were entertainers coming through during dinner. Kept it interesting. We decided to stay for the nightclub to open. There's no additional charge if you stay for the club to open around 12:30 after their last show. The place was packed and the skinny cute girly DJ was full of energy.

We were led through a hexagonal room, reminiscent of the elevator inside the Haunted House at Disneyland, and through two doors. We were greeted by a dining room boasting a full mural of the Garden of Earthly Delights and other spectacular aesthetics. 

We received TREMENDOUS SERVICE from ALEXANDER, enjoyed great food & cocktails, and excitement from tap dancing twins, ""Ben Franklin"" + his glass harmonica, aerialists, a furry, dancers, and a creepy silent corpse-like bride among other visual felicities- all of which exceeded my expectations for the evening and I hope yours. 

COCKTAILS
RRL is totally on-board with the pre-Prohibition, craft cocktail movement and I couldn't be more pleased.  The coolest offering and smartest move was purchasing their signature glass flask (which you can take home). I picked the Jack Rose which happened to be THE best Jack Rose I've ever had.  The large flask served 6 and a bit. 

FOOD
Dinner was served tapas style and delicious.  I was in charge of ordering and took our group on a tour of the menu from ""herbivores delights"", ""from the sea"", ""Plates around the table"", ""pearls from a spoon"".  We had a 10pm seating, so the ""Feast"" section was ignored.  Mind you, the Feast section has 3 items ranging from $95 for a free range chicken to a whole roasted giant Alaskan red king crab at $1200. 

We ate:
{Herbivores Delight}
GOUGERES with truffle mornay
POACHED WHITE ASPARAGUS with a bacon vinaigreette and fried egg
CAULIFLOWER and GREEN APPLE VELOUTE with brown butter and tarragon Chantilly
HEIRLOOM TOMATOES with burrata
BEETS & AVOCADO in a red wine cream with raspberry, arugula and fried shallots

{From the Sea}
CRISPY OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER w house cured bacon, spinach, chartreuse, and bacon dust
MARINATED BIG EYE TUNA with blood oranges, cucumbers and pickles chiles
LOBSTER COCKTAIL coconut emulsion, water chestnuts, lemongrass and mango

{Plates Around the Table}
FOIE GRAS TORCHON served with duck fat fries
BONE MARROW
SHORT RIB STROGANOFF
DUCK CONFIT PASTA
FROG LEGs with a cilantro lime chimichurri

{Pearls for a Spoon}
CAVIAR FLATBREAD with a 63 degree egg, bacon and thyme

DESSERT
THE most delicious variety of cake-like cookies that were served in container shaped like Colonel Sanders.  I had hoped for a lion with a crown, but apparently other guests had broken them and they didn't have anymore. 

PRICING
The above sections range from $5 to $36 per dish
The Feast section has 3 items ranging from $95 for a free range chicken to a whole roasted giant Alaskan red king crab at $1200. 

The great thing about the 10pm seating was that once we were done, RRL started their midnight show.  After the midnight show, the place turns into a nightclub.

2016684,2016-07-10,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Meh is exactly what I think of the food here. The entertainment was fun during dinner but the food was super lackluster.

We ordered brioche rolls, caviar flatbread, Hokkaido sea scallops, beef stroganoff and duck confit pasta for three of us to share.

The food was so dense and rich I was only able to eat a roll, 1/4 of the duck confit pasta, and one slice of the flatbread. And trust me, these portions are tiny!

The brioche rolls were great! Super soft and served with butter. 

The caviar flatbread was good but way too cheesy for my tastes. The Parmesan overwhelms any other flavor on the dish.

The duck confit pasta was my favorite! Duck and lemon flavored pasta with big shavings of cheese over it. I may come back just for that...or maybe just try to recreate it at home.

I took my leftovers home and ate them pretty promptly after. The beef stroganoff was ok. The sauce was too salty for my liking and the one noodle laid on top was weird. Stroganoff is usually kinda creamy so I was missing that to balance out the salt.

The sea scallops were SALTY! The dish is already seasoned but then the scallops are finished with salt on top. What were they thinking?? The veg that came with the dish is all pretty forgetful.

We got the cookie jar for dessert. I had the sprinkled cake ball and a bite of brownie. The cake ball was delicious and the brownie was very chocolate-y! It was fun to pass the thing around the table and choose different items!

Overall a fun experience but would I come here again? Doubtful. The food was too salty. I should have just ordered the duck pasta and cookie jar.",1a63w3mxCP47DA4IhS40fw,1,0,3,DviuYR3cj4TZ7R-MoprnIg

None the less,  I had a good time and I probably would return to try some of their other food items, wine and see some of more of the tacky Las Vegas style shows. 

My 3 stars are really a 3.5-3.7 range. I'm disappointed with dinner, mostly because I had such high hopes. There were just too many misses than hits, and when you mess with my sister's birthday dinner meal, well that's a problem. The service I will say was excellent. Definitely where they are getting their extra points. We were a bit tardy for our reservation, but didn't have to wait too long. We were seated in a small table for 3 right in front of one of the many stages around the restaurant. The dinning experience is pretty awesome (touristy trap part).  

We enjoy ""Tapas style/small plate "" dinning so we ordered a few things. The Wagyu steak tar tar was delicious, and was the best thing we ordered. We also had the fingerling potatoes and the argentine empanadas. Both were OK, the empanadas we more EH than OK. The misses were in the flavors and execution. Presentation, playing and overall decor is amazing, I just wish the food matched the preciseness and thoughtfulness the restaurant has. 

We also had a bottle of Tempranillo which was quite nice. My cocktails was delicious, but whoah I won't even tell you the price lol

Overall it was a nice night, with good company, but disappointed in the dinning experience. If only they would step it up a notch with the fine dinning, then absolutely they would receive a 5.",4fgzWORy2oj3oA5O1qxVEg,5,2,3,nWgTpX_XkLZat9oxvuW6Fg

One of the bridesmaids couldn't come on the trip, so she called the restaurant ahead of time and ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to be sent to our table when we arrived as a surprise gift to the bride-to-be.  When we arrived, the restaurant told us the bottle of wine was on the house.  No mention that it was actually a gift from our friend.  That is just wrong.  We didn't realize it was from our friend until she texted us asking if we got the wine yet.  We were ordering our food and the waitress kept telling us we needed to order more.  We told her we already ate before and just wanted to sample a little bit of everything.  We did order a number of dishes, but she wanted us to order 4 of each one.  Lady, that is just way too much for us.  She was being all rude about it. I had a question about one of the drinks with seasonal fruits (since one of my friends is allergic to certain fruits), and the very rude waitress acted annoyed at me, said she was going to go ask about it, and never came back to our table.  For a restaurant with 4$, you would expect better service than this. I wish I could give 0 stars.

The live entertainment and food were pretty good.  I can't give higher than 1 because of the terrible service.  I will never come back here nor recommend to anyone that I know.",TRWWCS2v5PseeW5ONAjdng,2,0,1,u8qaPG8u1V1jN5kFmV5G0Q

This place is really different. You feel like you are walking through a 21+ fun house almost. I really liked how much the spaces can shift and move around since we are not at that level yet in Chicago. We came after dinner in the Cosmo and had the Cookie Jar for dessert. Great idea for after dinner bites since there is something for everyone. I also love that they have Moscow Mules on tap, so so smart. Our waitress was beautiful and very friendly but since it was pretty dead on a Sunday I would have liked her to show us around a bit more. 

The reason I'm not ranking this as high as others is there were some definite issues during our experience. The music was all over the place and at points shut off completely. The entrance is very unwelcoming by the staff who just looks at you instead of asking if you want to go inside (again, we were there on a Sunday night and it was dead). I also found myself a little lost getting out of there but I think that's part of the plan! The salon with the record player is really nice but overall I think they have some bugs to work out to make this a consistent experience whether or not they have a lot of guests.

2091506,2014-06-15,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"This place is amazing. I was planning a 2 nights trip to vegas and didn't know which show to go to. Luckily Livingsocial had a promotion (I think they still do) for tickets to the Vegas Nocturne Show at Rose Rabbit Lie. I think a lot of people have watched their commercial on youtube. Unfortunately it didn't give me any clue at all. The video was weird, freaky, yet intriguing and just confused me. Anyhow, it seems exciting and fellow Yelper gave a high rating, so I purchased ticket for a saturday night. I am going to spill a lot of beans here but you must be there to experience it. No one can ever tell you too much about this place because the surprises just keep coming and coming and the show's rundown rotates all the time.

So I purchased the ticket for 10pm, I arrived early and tried to get into the restaurant section of Rose Rabbit Lie. They said it was full house, and can't let me in until a few minutes before the show start. So I ended up at next door and try their Wicked Spoon, pretty good buffet I must say.

So I entered the Rose Rabbit Lie around 9:45 and got a drink. Living social tickets only grant you those plastic seats, not sofa. It wasn't too comfortable for the whole hour.
The show is fascinating, the surprises just keep rolling. I was lucky and got invited to the stage XD. Sorry, i won't tell you how they did the magic puppy trick but I know!

After the show, they lead us to the next door and had a drink. They announced the nightlife starts at noon, but before that there is another show at 1130. Anyhow, we waited around and had more drinks.
At 12pm, there is a beautiful lady, whos the DJ, and started the party. Everyone started dancing and the sound system are pretty cool.
About 30 minutes into the mix, she took out 2 drum sticks and then 3 drummers walked into the middle of the dance floor!! it was the highlight of the night so far.

I think I will stop here and you somewhat get the idea. It is a new hot spot in vegas, I love it, You should definitely try it out.",d8ARRWq58GF8idrzmH2ZZg,2,2,5,QrpBER7SIGrR7JJ0_-3QSQ

Located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel - also one of my favorite Vegas hotels - there is a Cirque-esque performance at midnight, an awesome DJ, super friendly staff - and that's including their security - and they have craft cocktails! No more of that $15 vodka on the rocks crap from the nightclubs. For about the same price, you can get a quality drink. There's also a lot of seating - stadium/theatre-like seating surrounding a dance floor - so if you get there early enough, you're in a group of girls and they haven't completely sold out of tables, you just might snag the perfect seat for the show. 

My rec? Do Marquee first; check out the RRL performance at midnight, stick around for a lot of dancing, then head back to Marquee (also in Cosmopolitan).

We sat second to the last row and we were still maybe 25 feet from the action.  On the flip side, the bar was really close and we definitely enjoyed our beers during the show.

The lady with the red hair and the MC definitely created an exciting dynamic with the rest of the ""family"" in between acts.  

I was really impressed with the acrobat who at the end who shot an arrow with her feet.  Feats of magic by itself weren't too impressive, the way they used creative humor (like the man in the dino suti) to engage the audience the whole time was refreshing vs the normal 1-liners.

The guy in bathtub doing the rope acrobatics and the asian acrobat balancing umbrellas using her feats were really impressive up close and personal.  After the show, the crowd is led into the dining area / exit for live music in which the cast members (still in their roles) take part in the show.

Definitely a great show that stands out compared to the big budget shows that Vegas is known for.  We heard the show at 9 is much more risque and more fun to watch for adults.",RravdxekL7fK8iag5s9Z7w,1,0,5,MLKhx-z6pUNPGJBjEIhPew

The Band was Loud... But really good. The Singers were Awesome. They took old classic hits and revamped them in a new way & made them their own.  

The DANCERS were out of this world FABULOUS.  One was Aaron Turner.  He was tapping like the best of the best ... Think Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire.  It was a throwback to a time gone by.  Aaron is from Las Vegas & was a runner up on So You Think You Can Dance. 

The other dancer,  Bailey Munoz,  is a street hip-hop stylist. He was in constant motion. Dressed to go with the upscale vibe & throwback 1930's to 1940's style venue.  He is also a local talent who has one top awards in Dance contests. He is very young 

The weird part is we only knew about the fame and names of the dancers because one of our dinner companions had been their dance teacher. So they both came over to hug her & say hi to us.  

There was no host or MC so no one was introduced. I So Wish we went to it when it included Nocturne. It sounds & looks like it was Amazing!

We chose the tasting menu. 

The Steak Tartar was Unique & Totally Delicious. My husband said it was the best he has ever had. 

Next Tiny Caviar Tacos & I mean Tiny!!! 
What they were sitting in on the plate was a mystery.  They were actually very tasty.  
There were lots of plates of wonderful creations... 

The frustrating issue was that with everything that came out, as it was loud and dark and we had no idea what was being served. So plate after plate of mystery food. 

Toooooo  much Caviar for me.  It was all very very tasty but I am not a big Caviar fan. There was a lot of food, so unlike other reviewers, I did not have the too small portions experience. 

My suggestion to the venue is: 
Get an MC to introduce the Exceptional Talent & make some Printed Tags to come out with the foods on the tasting menu as it is too loud to hear what it is.  Also a small flashlight at each table could be fun & that way you could see the food.  I put a small whole oyster in my mouth & some of the salt it was sitting on top of. I had No idea it was a tiny serving of Oyster Rockefeller. After I removed it from my mouth, I did manage to drink some water to recover from the remainder of the SALT taste in my mouth & I did enjoy the taste... But it was not a great part of the night. 

The Deserts were tiny but delightful. Very unusual, fresh & rich tastes.

Customer service: 
I had to redeem my promotion by May 31st. Once redeemed, I must see the show within 5 days.  You must do this in person. Then I reserve my seats at the Rose Rabbit Lie box office, which is to the right of the East Tower parking elevators during the day and up on the second floor by the west escalators after 4PM. Excellent customer service all the time...especially inside Rose Rabbit Lie!

Concept:
Great Gatsby x Alice in Wonderland x Variety show
The whole dining/drinking/show experience is like being in an exclusive speakeasy where the performers interact and entertain you as their personal guests throughout the night!

The rooms:
It's a maze with hidden doors.  I didn't get to see all the rooms but I stopped a lot of the staff for suggestions and they walk you to where you want to be. Yes, they escort you.  So nice! This was how we found a secret, quiet bar. 

The show:
From the producers of Absinthe, Nocturne is a fun combination of acrobatics, tap dancing, beat boxing...you know what? Each show is different. That's why people come back! It's the greatest show and signing experience! Just go, the show is superb, hilarious, modern, classy, and not so classy all at the same time. Have you seen Fuerza Bruta in New York? It's not the same, but it has a similar concept. I went to the 930pm showing and a DJ did come out at the end of the show.  Only weds-sat

Dinner music: 
A polka band playing Top 40's. the best renditions of today's music that I've ever heard. I am tired of hearing ""Happy"" by Pharrell...but last night when an actress sang it in a nasal voice set to polka, it really made me happy. And gleeful. Just...so...oh em gee. 

Tips:
If you're an identity member, check your inbox for that promo email! Promo tickets get seated in folding chairs instead of couches. Get front seats. It's a small stage, no stadium seating, intimate, so get close!

Park at the west elevators, go up to the casino level, then take the escalators to the second floor. Follow signs to Rose rabbit lie. It's by Wicked Spoon. 
Go straight to the staff. They will guide you. 

Arrive  an hour or two prior to your show time and tell them you'd like to go to the bar. This way, you'll get in and will have time to explore. It's small, it gets crowded after the 730 show because guests may stay as long as they want.  Go early. 

Drinks are expensive but perfect. 

Make dining reservations in advance!

If you're claustrophobic, this is not for you. It can get crowded!

Not for kids. Get a babysitter. 

Dress code: casual elegant. What you'd wear to Jay Gatsby's Baz Luhrman party or an upscale Alice in Wonderland.

2200001,2014-06-03,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"**Review for nightclub portion only.

We were thoroughly surprised by this place and had a great time! Normally it's $30 to get in (doors at 11pm), but they were having a special free for locals thru the month of May with a password. (Thanks to Nik O. for letting me know about it!)  First night we went was on Friday. We liked it so much that we came back again the next day! 

So I was confused about this place for the longest time. Is it a restaurant? Bar? Theater? Do you have to have reservations for dinner to see the show?  If you don't want to pay for a pricey dinner, just go to the club portion at 11pm. Actually, when you get to the front of the line, the bouncers will ask you for a reservation, or if none, your ID for the club, and they write something down on a ticket and you give it to the door guy. They open up the door and inside is a room with MORE doors! Really reminded me of the elevator in the Haunted Mansion, but the room doesn't stretch. They guy inside looks at your ticket and opens the appropriate door. The other doors must lead to the restaurant and other parts of the ""mansion"".

The show starts promptly at midnight. Since we went two days in a row, we were able to see two shows but they were about 80% the same acts. The highlights were the contortionist girl who can balance herself on a pole and spin herself around by her teeth! The fire eating girl. The beat boxing girl. There was also this guy that jumps thru a tiny hoop, not head first, or feet first, but with both head and feet at the same time! The stage rotates with each act, and you can go behind the stage in the ""backstage"" area and see the next performers to come on.  There are mini shows in this area too, along with performers on the back section of the circular stage so really there is something to watch all over the place.

After the show, the stage rotates and a female DJ with a huge Marie Antoinette style (not really) wig comes out with a DJ booth that looked like mangled up brass instruments. They do a really good job of bringing people out to the dance floor immediately after the show's end. There are still performers around, go go dancers (I especially liked the disco ball man), an aerialist, even someone walking on the roof. The biggest difference between the first and second night's show was the performers after the actual show.

The staff here are great. From the door men, to the backstage crew and the performers, everyone here looks like they really enjoy their job. The bouncer remembered us from the night before. And I was able to get a little chat in with the fire eating girl before she went on. We told me she remembered us from the night before (I doubt it!) but it was so nice of her to say that and to chat with me for a bit.

I can't rate it 5 stars though bc everything here (drinks and food) is just so unnecessarily pricey! Entry fee of $30 is totally fair though for the entertainment you get.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,5,1,4,tidGVk5jwb9Bdvwj3X3JaA
2217131,2014-11-14,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I was not sure about wanting to come to Rose. Rabbit. Lie. for dinner. I like my meals to be, well, meals.  I don't need my restaurant to blend into a club and a bar and whatever else the ads say about this place.  I also heard about this place in its previous format - when Vegas Nocturne was still part of the experience.  Now that it has departed the supper club is more like a speakeasy with really good food.

Our server was extremely knowledgeable.  He had multiple things to say about every single item on the menu (and not just repeating the ingredient list).  He was able to make recommendations based on our personal likes and dislikes, as well as based on the size of our group.  He told us about the one special for the evening and really sold it to us.  Not that white truffles need to be sold.

One of the most memorable parts of the evening was when the chef brought out the big honkin aforementioned white truffle.  He wanted to say hi personally and show us the $2000 worth of truffle he had in his possession.  When the dish was served later he also brought it out personally and shaved the truffles at the table.  It was a really nice touch to have that kind of service.

Overall, the service was impeccable.  We had a few dishes sent out complimentary just because chef thought we would like them.  We had the bartender make us a drink on very vague direction and it was outstanding.  The entertainment was impossibly good, including tap dancers, a woman with a great set of pipes, and a kid who looks like he could be a grifter on the strip but is instead charming everyone in Rose. Rabbit. Lie.

Overall it's a wonderful place to go and have a different experience.  It's not your normal night out for dinner, and it's probably not for everyone.  Since most of the menu is for sharing, it can get very expensive very fast.  I also assume that if it's a slow night your experience may not be as great.  That said, it's definitely worth it to check out something more than just another celebrity chef restaurant on the strip.",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,3,1,4,Raj-kF7jsQvqMlX0DlUQwQ

2246832,2014-07-12,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"We won tickets to see Vegas Nocturne and went on a Saturday night for the 7:30 show. The venue has a speak-easy atmosphere and all the staff were very friendly. We had a drink when we arrived and one drink was all we needed:) The bartenders were awesome, had patience with our group, and helped us choose what to have without overselling. The drinks were very pricey but it's Vegas! For the show we had second row seats and before the show the performers/hosts came around and talked with us. We later learned that they were gathering intell on us to participate in the show. We didn't get included but some others around us did. The performance was amazing and was sort of a variety type show. I won't tell you much as you'll have to see if for yourself (or read other reviews that reveal more!). What I will say is that the early show is little less provocative but still very adult. 

The dress code is similar to a nightclub; no sneakers, no athletic wear, no shorts, etc.The show lasted about 90 minutes. Our seats were folding chairs but they weren't that uncomfortable. It might have been nice to sit a little further back in one of the more comfy chairs with a table but being close to the action was worth it. I can't say that I enjoyed one performance more than the others because they were all impressive. The ladies will enjoy the bathtub performance though;)

I know others have complained about ticket prices and if I had to pay face value for what our tickets were I doubt I would have went. However, if you can find them at a decent price (less than $50) I'd say go and check this out. There's always a deal to be made in Vegas so I'm sure tickets can be found! Plus they can easily make up for it with their drink prices:) I've heard the later the show the less expensive but definitely more intense.",MpnhAw36801hzClpvy5kvA,0,0,4,3d4hWD8rxWfpZ4eRADXmXw

Positives:
- The jazzy and somewhat sexy atmosphere; the place is decorated like a cool retro supperclub.   Would be a great date place
-  The singers and dancers who perform just a few feet away and sometimes interact with you.   Really fun and by far the best part of the night
- Food:  While nothing to rave about, it's not bad and sometimes rather creative

Negatives:
- In a town of overpriced food, this was really overpriced -- the prices would be fine with larger portions but they were ridiculously tiny.  While the food was fine, this wasn't Joel Robuchon but I felt like it was priced like it
- There was something a little too studied about the whole place, like it was trying too hard to make money and you were just a way of doing so.  

Maybe my expectations were too high (I had friends who went earlier when I heard the entertainment was much better) but somehow I left feeling dissatisfied.   That said, I can see how others really enjoy this, especially the cool entertainment.",gipgMGX89Jp0jLqJ-y4rhg,5,3,3,sazH5AtVb1FC5VihMTbmyg
2257854,2018-07-01,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Highly recommend this place for the entertainment value (didn't eat here) although the pours are top-notch. 

My wife and received some recommendations to go here from our cocktail waitress at the Cosmopolitan so we wondered in through a non-descript entrance next to the Wicked Spoon buffet. RRL consists of 2 Rooms: the Main dining room with a bar & live entertainment, and a ""Secret Room"" which is reportedly very low key with custom cocktail creations. We were there for live music so we chose the dining room. It's open seating at the bar and around the bar, and you can order off their full menu anywhere in the main room. Otherwise, better make RSVPs for a table.

We grabbed the open corner bar chairs at the bar for literally the best seats in the house to catch the live entertainment (our bartender agreed). RRL's dining room is one big room, with either singers or dancers moving throughout the room while performing. Each area has an dlevated platform of sorts for the dancers. Views can sometimes be partially obscured. 

Keno our bartender was superb and was kind enough to tell us what to expect crom the entertainment, and when. Most nights the entertainment consists of a 3 piece band: bass, drummmer, and pianist with 2 singers. Sets are usually for 15-20 mins every hour. We returned Friday night, and the slready good entertainment value skyrocketed to superb. Fri/Sat nights throw in another guitarist, another singer, and 3 awesome male dancers: a tap dancer, break dancer, and a way too-cool ""Robot"" dancer.

Libations are unsurprisingly pricey here, but well made. TIP: drink one of their 3 ""Craft in the Bottle"" drinks. They are each served in a unique take-home flask (makes for a great souveneir). We loved their ""Old Dog New Trick"" cocktail ($35). Their 3 flask-size drinks are actually a good value given it's 4 drinks + a flask ($9/drink). 

The night zoomed by and was very memorable, especially the occasional ""swooning"" of one of the singers to my wife. Stop here for some relaxed fun and great entertainment. Ask for Keno if sitting at the bar, and tip him well.",MqcfaSdLXh7H1Aey_HPUsw,0,0,5,hFAnrRecTkuk2gJGNBgtdw

I was confused before arriving, and I think I'm even more confused now that I've been.

At one moment, I'm in a study sipping on a hand crafted $16-plus-tax-plus-tip Mark Twain in ""The Study"", and the next I'm being swept into a private room by a young version of the Mad Hatter for story time.

After being given some punch which ""aids in forgetting"" about the story that I'm about to be told, I'm presented with a blindfold from a silver platter, which by the way, also holds an old school revolver.  The story, which is told by the Mad Hatter's counterpart, is deep and interesting, yet difficult to follow.  My heightened senses of hearing and scent are stimulated with various sound effects including the sound and smell of burning fire.  When I'm asked to remove my blindfold, there is a contorted woman in the room, doing a handstand, holding a bow & arrow with her feet, and aiming it at the Mad Hatter who is playing the piano on the opposite side of the small room.  After he is shot by the arrow and dragged out of the room, we're asked to quickly evacuate as well.

The level of weirdness and wonder doesn't change much throughout the night, as there is constantly something interesting going on.  Tap dancers on the bar, a guy playing a saw like a violin, singers, a female beat boxer, and more are just a few examples of the entertainment that seemed to pop up randomly both in context and location throughout.  I never knew where to comfortably take it all in, as at some points I was either behind the stage, hovering in the dining area, saddled up to the bar..  I always had that feeling that someone was going to tell me ""you're not supposed to be here""; but they never did.

All these experiences occurred within a few short hours, and I was (almost) completely sober.  I'd definitely like to come back for more!",5Af5mVbYDRQ_24dBFfMgmg,22,16,4,3nwGjFm_ozUp1Ak7e2cndQ

Show was very different. We got tickets for 50 a piece, and I wouldn't pay more than that for it. There was some comedy, magic, a contortionist, a female beatboxer, tap dancers, and much more. There was one act that involved a girl getting fully nude, but she threw in comedy through out her act and she was so skinny and small that my girlfriend and I both said that we weren't sure anyone would find it particularly offensive. Also, it was 10 at night in Vegas so I wasn't surprised. Tap dancing brothers were amazing. Truly talented, very charming. Could've watched them for longer. Beatboxer was good too, but on stage for quite some time so it got a little old. Some acts were not impressive, but I suppose some people probably liked those and didn't like others. The night ended with a ping pong ball fight which was fun.

We had a widows kiss and a moscow mule for drinks. Both packed a punch. Widows kiss good for brandy enthusiasts.

rose. rabbit. lie. is the latest happening at The Cosmopolitan.

It is billed as a ""rebirth of the social club"" and a ""grand social experiment.""  so, there you go...I'm sure that explains it perfectly.  Essentially what they have done is broken down the walls (some of them anyway) between typically separate venues like a restaurant, club, cocktail bar, and a live entertainment theater and brought them together in one spot.  The club doesn't start until after the last show, the restaurant is semipermeably divided from the entertainment, but the interplay creates a unique experience for sure.  There are several bars in the space as well--including one sensational place for quintessential cocktails...The Study...

The Study...  This niche bar is a small secluded treasure inside of rose. rabbit. lie.  They offer well-crafted, often boozy, but always balanced cocktails.  The Study serves up many classically inspired drinks as well as offering several modern variations.  The staff is staff here is elite and will work off the menu to delightful results as well.  The drinks start around $16 and are worth the price.

Nocturne is the show at RRL.  It is a whimsical interplay of circus acts...wait...or is it side show acts?...you'll have to find your way into the Cloak Room to know for show.  The shows are different at each time slot, but similar in concept.  I found the 8pm & 10pm shows to playfully fun and amusingly cheesy.  The individual acts range from tap dancers to contortionist; tight wire to burlesque; balance acts to aerial ropes.  In the same way that Coldplay is Radiohead Light, Nocturne is Absinthe Light.  Great in it's own right, but falling short to purists of the original.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,36,27,4,m471Tr8IqnPuagJNjC9B-Q

2452994,2014-08-30,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Loved it.  

Don't know why people are complaining about the food, because I thought everything was exceptional.  I had the salmon and the shrimp / corn thing, and both were flavorful, well-done, and delicious.  Yes, the plates are small, but the waiter told us first thing that it was ""tapas-style"" and they recommend three plates per person.  We did two, and that was plenty.  Most of our group had a hard time narrowing down what we wanted because so many things looked so tasty.

Don't know why people are saying there's no show, because there was entertainment all evening long.  There were a few of great lounge singers and a couple of dance acts, and all were outstanding.  Yes, it's loud; there's a show going on.

The chocolate terrarium was pretty damn cool, reminded me of Coquette's ""chocolate garden"" but taken to another level entirely.

The drinks were outstanding.  They were very small, and that's my only wish for this place.

2553538,2014-03-30,4,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I ended up at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. on a Friday night for a friends birthday. We had all purchased the Living Social deal. We were seeing the 10 o'clock showing and arrived early to pick up our tickets at will call.

There was an immediate smile on my face when we entered the bar. My first impression of this place was that it reminded me of the newer version of the Great Gatsby movie. There was a small band playing a swing/jazz cover of Macklemore which was great, and there was an act going on right next to them. A girl, 3 legs, and a suitcase. I won't spoil too much here. 

It was tightly packed and the rooms are dark and intimate. A peek at the drink list was interesting. I ended up paying $16 for a cocktail.  I'm not even going to get into how overpriced this place was. You're on the strip, you know the routine. Even the flatbread pizza has caviar on it, if you see where I'm going with this. 

The show started promptly, and if you have a Living Social coupon, you end up getting seated on folding chairs which were not as uncomfortable as we expected. People around us were ordering food at their tables and I have to admit, everything smelled absolutely delicious.

As far as the show goes, it was a fun experience... but I honestly felt bored at times. Particularly by the main announcer and his sidekick. If you have seen Absinthe (if you haven't, GO!) you will definitely see the physical similarities. They just did not have the same charisma and charm as The Gazillionaire and Penny Pibbets, the 2 hosts of Absinthe. 

The show is created by Spiegelworld, who also created Absinthe which is why I am comparing the two. Certain acts seemed to really drag on and brought moderate chuckles from our group. Don't get me wrong, the show is still a must see and there were wonderful performances, including LOTS of tap dancing, and a very beautiful and talented beat boxer. My absolute favorite act was the 2 performers with chinese yo-yo's. 

If you have the money to see multiple shows on the strip, then by all means go and experience this place. The decor, music, and entertainment is truly fantastic, but I felt as though the marketing really tries to push that this is a new ""social experiment"" thing. It's a fun bar, with a great vibe. The roaming performers is really interesting, but that's about all there is to say about it. Multiple rooms is not really all that innovative, especially considering the Cosmo's own nightclub Marquee does a great job at doing the exact same thing, just sans performers. The layout here is also an absolute nightmare.

Overall, I feel they were attempting to mock and/or pay tribute to cheezey lounge acts, but a lot of the time it was mostly cheezey. So, yeah, if your budget's tight but you're still looking for burlesque, lounge acts and hilarious/crass humor, Absinthe is really the show to go to.",mloua2rXvKQuayyY9KqEhg,13,6,3,sByQsRPrkAf6pLnK8udRbg

We finished with the table side bananas foster which was a fun experience. They have a cart with a burner on it and do the whole preparation with the flambé next to you. It's not cheap, but it seems like it would serve 4 people for dessert.

While we were there there was a great jazz band playing. One of them was tap dancing on the piano and it made for a great show during dinner.

Rose. Rabbit. Lie.  What can I say?  This is a crazy, awesome experience. This venue opened a couple of years ago at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas and you need to experience it at least once. Fortunately, it's comprised of 3 different venues, so you'll have more than one reason to return. 

If you've never been to this place and ask any of the hotel staff to describe what this place is about, you'll probably be hard pressed to get a straightforward answer. In fact, we ran into so many staff who were unable to describe it, that my husband and I started thinking that it was the hotel's marketing strategy to raise interest in it.  Admittedly, this may have changed by now since our experience was 1 year ago, but I thought I should mention it, just in case it hasn't.

This venue is made up of 3 sections: their main restaurant, their bar/cocktail lounge, and their intimate concert venue. The first night we ate at their restaurant at around 9pm. At this time, the restaurant was full and the show was underway in the bar area.  The bar area/lounge had a variety of musical and dance acts that played throughout the evening, and since the restaurant was adjacent to the lounge, our dinner experience felt more like a hip, dinner show.  Some of the acts included a blues singer, a pre-teen tap dancer, a ballad crooner, and a contortionist. The musicians and dancers would continuously move throughout the restaurant, which only emphasized the intimacy of the venue. But even with all of the musical acts, the star of the night was the restaurant's dinner menu, highlighted by their desserts.  For the latter, we chose their flower garden: the ""dirt"" was crushed up Oreo cookies, and embedded in the dirt were gummy ""worms,"" hot fudge, meringue ""rocks,"" ice cream, laced with edible flowers.  The dessert plate was served to us under a see through, glass cloche. The presentation was truly a work of art!  The only thing to keep in mind is that this place is pretty expensive, and their portion sizes are small. But the experience is well worth it.

The next night we went to a concert in their concert hall; the hotel front desk gave us free tickets to see the concert at check-in and we took advantage of it. The hall had seating similar to a supper lounge, with a small bar in the back, table service, and a small dance floor. The concert started with a dance number with their in-house dancers; (I recognized some of the dancers from the previous night's dinner show).  By the end of the concert, the audience was invited to dance on the dance floor with the rest of the band. Lots of fun!

I highly recommend coming here.",dLs5hRZOgJY7yk7WxuEhqA,2,1,5,iMQ8vVWGR_LDIimu8z8V9Q

As soon as this place opened I put it on my ""list"" of things to do because the curiosity was enticing. There was a Groupon for the show so my roomie & I purchased and went for the 9pm show. We made dinner reservations for 815pm so we could try the food as well. 

The atmosphere is contagious. The attention to detail is amazing. We were seated and had a delicious dinner as various acts happened around us through the hour. During dinner random man comes to our table, hands my roommate a card and tells her to ""make sure the magic dragon gets this"" and leaves. WTH? All of the food which is tapas style was good. I got a moscow mule and my roomate picked another signature drink, both yummy. We also decided to do a shot of absinthe each, the vibe of the place just called for it! After that we were ready. 

At 855 we were ushered into the show room and watched the show which was awesome. Variety. Loved it. 

We liked it so much we stayed for the midnight show which is a DIFFERENT show. There is a person named butterscotch who is very talented. There are 7 rooms in the establishment (one of which is VIP ONLY). We saw all 7 :) 

We found the magic dragon who did an fancy card trick for us & we got to hold his puppy Puffin.

2630127,2017-12-08,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"In selecting Rose. Rabbit. Lie. for our first business dinner of the week, our host described this as a funky, strange, incredible experience which, by the way, includes some mighty fine fare. OK, then, sign me up!

We began our evening in the bar, which has a cool speakeasy feel to it. There is a room in the back with a couch along its three walls and heavy drapes that can be pulled closed for privacy. My glass of champagne was the perfect beginning to our very nice evening.

The hostess escorted us into the dining room. I was struck by the ambience - funky (in a very good way) is certainly an accurate description. The live music was a very nice touch, although the noise level overall made conversation quite difficult. We were told that there are ""acts"" that roam the restaurant and entertain guests table side. Our host was surprised and a somewhat disappointed that this did not occur during our visit.

For appetizers our host selected oysters on the half shell, heirloom tomatoes, and Wagyu steak tartare. I don't do oysters; it's a texture thing for me. However, my colleagues trumpeted their deliciousness as they tried to persuade me to try one. No dice. The heirloom tomatoes accompanied with a whipped straciatella cheese, basil and a honey vinaigrette dressing were very flavorful and easily took top prize in my book. The Wagyu steak tartare was outstanding also, and I found the pairing with the heirloom tomatoes to suit me perfectly.

Our host also selected three dinner entrees for our group. RRL is known for its Beef Wellington. Oh. My. Gosh. It was perfect. Fork tender and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it was easily my favorite entree of the three. I'd go back again just for this. Hitting the major protein groups, our host also selected the Roast Chicken and Sole Meuniere. The chicken was OK - it's chicken - but the gnocchi served with it were delectable. And the sole, served with an almond brown butter and caviar was an amazing combination of flavors that caused my taste buds to dance a polka. I would go back for this as well.

Dessert selections included Bananas Foster, cooked flambe table side. The banana bread was amazing as was the sauce; some of the best BF I've had. But my favorite, and most unique dessert was the Chocolate Terrarium - yes, a terrarium. Served on a round wooden platter, this dessert offers a selection of fine chocolate goodness including chocolate pudding, chocolate buttermilk cake, puffed wild rice, crispy chocolate tuille, and hazelnut ice cream, all artfully positioned on a bed of chocolate ""soil"" which reminded me of crushed Oreos. The presentation was artful, and for this chocolate lover, the flavors were the perfect rounding out of a very nice meal.

I'm not a gambler, but experiences like Rose. Rabbit. Lie make me appreciate the opportunities to visit Las Vegas. Very nice!",8sAGXoMY7I9quLmCO1F8ZQ,4,0,4,k1WnCWw7hj22TyqF0yU_1g

Oysters- super fresh, great quality, and don't forget the sauce! 
Caviar flat bread - by the time I got to the flat bread I was feeling somewhat full. However, was so tasty and flavorful; I kept eating. Haha.
Steak tartare- Yum! I started off with eating this, it was nice and juicy. Served w/ toast.
Pancetta burger- boyfriend ordered this one. Although I had a taste, it was delicious as well. Served w/ an egg, which meant bomb dot com.

There were four of us and with only one drink each our bill was still $125 per person. The problem is we were seated in a room that literally nothing happened for over two hours...no juggling, no tapdancing, no contortionist...zilch. Every time the door would open to our dining room we'd think something was about to happen....and it didnt. Finally when we were paying our bill two guys came out and had bowler hats on which they did tricks with on the bar. okay, nothing special really. Our water was really nice and after we payed he gave us a tour of the whole venue..I think he obviously knew we were a bit disappointed in the "" experience"".

The food was amazing, not one dish was bad, though the sauce with the octopus was a tad spicy for me. The entertainment was great, and we were seated right by the piano so had a great view. The only reason I voted 4 stars was all of their cocktails had bitters, I even ordered a gimlet (not on their menu) and it had bitters, never had one like that before, not really a fan.

Saw this 10 pm show on a Thursday night with 3 other Yelp friends of mine. Might as well have been 3 in the morning on a Sunday night because what I witnessed was bizarre and a bit abstract. 

When you enter this venue, it is literally a whole other dimension, like you were high on some kind of drug. The way the place is set up makes you think the interior designer did not know what they were doing, but once you get settled and have a better feel only than you will understand why this place was designed this way.

As we were ushered to our seats, the first thing I noticed was that show area itself was a bit intimate, like the stage was purposely built for all of us like we were close friends or something. It's not your typical stage show area for we were surrounded by a bar/lounge/restaurant type atmosphere all rolled into one.

Now, as for the show itself, bravo! What you get is pretty much nonstop action of different performers doing things that you might have never witnessed anywhere else. With character names like Captain Frodo and Piff, the Magic Dragon, you get a variety of entertainment that I can only describe as ""Unexpected"" not to mention some nudity and what adult show could use a little bit of T and A?

I will definitely would not mind watching this again for I was told not every show is quite the same. More nudity perhaps? LOL. Anyways, for those that are thinking of watching this show, you will definitely get your money's worth! Enjoy!

We purchased the Living Social deal which was $134 for two admissions to the 10pm show. When we showed up, we were told they were in the  ""VIP""  area. We were led to our seats, and it was literally right up against the side wall, so we viewed the entire show from the side. Not sure how that was considered VIP, think they were blowing smoke up our ass.  I wasn't entirely impressed with the show. In fact there were some parts where I was down right bored, the part with ""mr piffles"" was painfully dumb. I thought the original Absinthe show was 100 times better (I can't attest to the new Absinthe, and I understand this is a different show, but everyone was comparing this to Absinthe). 

I enjoyed the bar and the band playing at the bar more than I enjoyed the show. The prohibition style cocktails are fun with the different elixirs and what not. I did try the oldest cocktail in the US, Sazerac, it was really good, but I ended up switching back to my usual of Dark & Stormy, they use Goslings Ginger Beer (my favorite). I noticed there was a cost difference in the drinks at the bar and inside the show. In the show, they tack on a L.E.T service charge, gratuity and tax. So two drinks was $45, but at the bar, they just charge service fee and tax. Which after gratuity still ends up being $45. You can see a couple rounds of drinks will end up forcing you to take out a second mortgage (kidding). 

I loved the vibe of the bar. The band was awesome, and the there were a couple tables where everyone was dressed up in flapper outfits. I will for sure come back to hang out at the bar again, and in the future when I have out of town guests, this place would be fun to take them.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,12,8,3,lPOCxD5Wxcq89DImiX3_8Q

The bar doesn't require cover and you can go anytime before 11:45ish. At midnight they have a show and at that point they charge $30 cover. The bar is really cool and has a craft cocktail vibe. However, they have these really cool sliding panels that let you enjoy a glimpse of the festivities in the other rooms. I'm not going to spoil the fun, but you really do have to go check it out for yourself. 

We liked it so much that we went back the next night to check out the Midnight Show. It was like nothing I had ever seen. Again, i doing want to ruin it by detailing the show, but seriously, it's a really fun atmosphere. You can do bottle service if you want. Or, like us, do the $30 ticket for the show. It's totally worth it. At some points you'll be saying ""WHAT THE??? HOW??"", at other times you might laugh your A$$ off, and at other times, you'll be in awe. 

It's only a 30 min show, after which it turns into a club w/ an amazing DJ. During that time there are some random performances as well. All in all, one of the best surprises in Vegas for me in a long time. It doesn't hurt that I'm seriously addicted to the Cosmo hotel & casino as well.

2747432,2016-02-26,4,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"This supper club possesses a cryptic name & boasts mysterious deeds done behind a heavy door. Rose.Rabbit.Lie. is a fantasy; we got drunk on the esthetics alone. Lace-designed flatware, menus bearing wax seals, furniture pieces that look straight out of a modern museum -- I expected nothing less from the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 

However, the reality of our dinner was quite sobering. The impeccably-plated bits and bobs of edibles (as nothing is decently sized) are overly expensive because the taste doesn't justify the prices. We laughed at the comical one-bite size of their unspectacular $15 caviar taco. The porcini flatbread I was most excited about was a flavor failure. Three tiny pieces of short rib make up their beef stroganoff, & again, the flavors were overshadowed by plating and presentation. Brussel sprouts, jidori chicken, & fingerling potatoes were worse versions of things we've had before, but the roasted octopus and the lobster cocktail got our table's approval. 

If I only ate with my eyes, they'd get 5 stars. My unsatisfied mouth and (hungry) stomach are leaning closer to 3 stars. 

The majestic chocolate terrarium is worth the hype (& this is coming from someone who doesn't usually go for chocolate desserts.) I loved that everything, down to the ""dirt,"" was edible. The marshmallowy parts were especially fun to eat.

The small, intimate theater is perfect for the variety acts, making stunts seem more dangerous and impressive. I'm not sure how often they change the acts, but some acts mentioned in other reviews weren't in this show. But, the ones they did have were crowd pleasers -- full of raunchy humor, skill, talent, and feats of strength.

We didn't have the chance to dine there, but I'd love to come back to experience the food. You'll find the talent from the show performing in the dining rooms before and after they've performed in the theater. In the theater there are two bars with specialty cocktails that'll run about $15 each.

I felt like I was in a Fitzgerald novel or had fallen down the rabbit hole the entire time we were there.  Even the silverware is decadent looking!  I loved it and would recommend it to anyone from 21 to 99+.

Here are my tips for making the most out of your visit:

(1)  Ask to be seated in the Music Room, Library or Swimming Pool area.  The Study is lovely and apparently has some amazing cocktails that are not available in the other ""rooms,"" but most of the action happens elsewhere.  

(2) Go light on the savory dishes.  We weren't wowed by the French-style ""tapas"" that we ordered (braised pork, Waldorf salad, beet salad, calamari, and a few others).  I had read about the small portions, but the salads were shockingly small--maybe 4 tiny lettuce leaves in the Waldorf salad.   Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but nothing stood out as fantastic.

(3) Order the Terrarium dessert!  It's visually stunning and deliciously decadent.  

(4)  If you like cocktails, you will be highly satisfied.  As others have mentioned, they have some specialty drinks that you won't find anywhere else.  The tea and coffee menu is unique as well.  

(5) Walk around.  Make sure that you walk around the restaurant and check out the other rooms during your visit.  Our waiter even offered to give us a tour before we left.  

(6) Do not be in a rush.  Our dinner lasted almost 3 hours.  Other tables seem to stay even longer.  We didn't feel rushed at all by our server and enjoyed getting to see all of the acts that rotate through the restaurant while you are eating.

Note:  We did not pay to see a show.  However, you will see performances all night long throughout the restaurant.  My favorites were the wacky gal singing a polka version of ""Blurry Lines"", the creepy man playing some sort of glass accordion, the tap dancing twins and the dancing suitcase.

When we arrived we were ushered into the study, their pre-dinner waiting area. First off, the bartender had ZERO personality. I know it's their job to mix drinks, not perform a comedy show, but a damn smile would've been nice. The decor in the study was nice. Classic, very reminiscent of a speakeasy. 
When our table was ready we were led into the main restaurant through a live singer. We were all excited, thinking we'd have a view of this during dinner. Boy were we wrong. The room we were in had absolutely no view of the performance and we were one of two tables sat in this room, with about 20 empty tables! There was a small stage where we were but nothing ever happened on it. 
As other reviewers have mentioned, the food was quite tasty. We especially enjoyed the flatbread, both the Mediterranean and caviar. However, the portions were a joke. I realize it's a tapas style restaurant but three (rather small) scallops for $18 was a major disappointment and frustration. Our server did manage to garner a few redeeming points for the restaurant, suggesting many options for our group and being very friendly.

Their menu is... random. It ranges from caviar tacos to steak stroganoff (my entree of choice) to pho (I had a taste of my girlfriend's and it was bomb!), to chocolate terrarium (it looked too pretty to eat... but we definitely went in). They also had an extensive cocktail menu. The service was friendly throughout our meal.

I really liked the concept of the roaming performers. It made the dinner entertaining and there were many Snapchat worthy moments. The performers also made an effort to stop by each table so everybody is included. Our experience went from singers to tap dancers and several different outfit changes!

The flavors and textures where amazing. The roasted corn, caviar flat bread, duck confit and short rib stroganoff where my favorites. The frog legs, pork belly and rabbit were also incredibly good.

2891877,2015-02-06,3,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"WOW. What a place!

I was hesitant to try out Rose.Rabbit.Lie. because of the mixed reviews on Yelp. However, I am so happy I put those premeditated thoughts aside and instead chose to give this place a whirl on my own. So here it goes:

*The Spot- We made a last-minute reservation on OpenTable for a Friday night, about an hour before we wanted to show up (surprised this was even possible). When we arrived, we were greeted by some very attractive female hostesses who walked us to our table. Everything inside is very swanky, and just about everyone who works here is beautiful. The pictures you see on Yelp of the decor don't do justice for what you actually see in this space. 

*Service- Our server was a little blonde doll who looks like she literally just stepped out of a magazine (and she had one of the best manicures I've ever seen, might I add... but I am a nail polish freak, and I know this has nothing to do with the restaurant.) But anywho, she was very friendly, down to earth, and made some pretty good recommendations on food and drinks. She also wasn't too over-the-top or pushy, and let us sit at our table for over 4 hours without making us feel like she wanted us to move along for another group to come in. There was another gentleman that was helping her out, and he was very nice to talk to as well. Both were very attentive and made us feel welcome.

*Entertainment- the table we sat at was great for the in-house entertainment. If you can request it, I would call in and ask for the table in the ""music room"" right in front of the stage and just to the left of the bar. Here you will be able to see all the acts, as they primarily perform from this room but do tend to walk around the whole restaurant from time to time. The band was awesome and had me dancing in my seat most of the night. There was also an older gentleman who tap danced on top of the piano.... what a sight! One of my other favorite acts was this little Asian Break Dancer, he was maybe 10 years old, but had moves like he'd been dancing for 20+ years. Super talented and was definitely working the room! Another act was this ""Aretha-Franklin-esque"" singer. Her voice was phenomenal and she was born to entertain.... she had the entire restaurant's attention when she was singing. She even came over and got me up out of my seat to dance around with her and ""feather-tease"" some of the guys standing at the bar. Hilarious!

*Food- we really loved everything we ordered. And I recommend each of these: Glazed Brussels Sprouts, Rock Shrimp & Butternut Squash Agnolotti, Short Rib Stroganoff, and Steak Tartare. The Caviar Truffles for dessert are a must!!!

After spending 4+ hours at this place, enjoying the entertainment, eating whatever we wanted to order, and drinking several alcoholic beverages (maybe 8 cocktails between the two of us), I'd say the $350 tab was very fair. I can't wait to come back to this spot, and will be sending any of my friends who visit Vegas to Rose.Rabbit.Lie. as well.  #winning",Y78xL2sadoZKiQ1ZH0XUjw,3,3,5,XVG0v-Ut6NvgTpFANv9iJg

Order a bunch of plates for your group, especially trying the rabbit, salads, and foie gras.

Caveat: we had a group of about 9 and were seated at a tall table.

Came here for a company event with a set menu, and unfortunately nothing on the menu impressed us; the meal was nothing more than a standard catered meal that was prepared in mass ahead of time with no flair or stand-out flavor. 

Apps for the table to split were beyond strange; how do you split an octopus tentacle as an app with your fellow co-workers, and the beet salad was the same strange concept. 

Entrees were a flavorless fish and a flavorless filet. To give them credit, filets were cooked to a perfect medium rare. Also, entrees were not plated with a starch. 

If I was the pastry chef, I'd be downright ashamed of the ""chocolate mousse"" that was served. It's like having a fake hair piece fall out on the dance floor... I wouldn't claim it as mine. So cloyingly sweet that it was largely left untouched by the table.

There is no other place like this in Vegas. This HAS IT ALL!

Cool vibe, Great atmosphere, Wonderful music and entertainment, Good service, Mouth-Watering food and Unique drinks!

The Setting - - 
Went here on a Saturday night with the husband and 2 out-of-town friends.  It was a first for all of us and we weren't sure what to expect.

Started off in the bar area.  Small, enclosed and separate room off the main restaurant area.  Little did we know there's a door that connects the 2, but it's a different door than the one you enter in from check-in.

There's a separate little alcove in the bar... so we sat in there to chat and catch up while our table was prepared. (We were a few minutes early.)

The Restaurant - - 
It's like walking into another dimension ... dark like a club, but with the ambiance and setting of a lounge all set in an Alice-In-Wonderland meets Michelangelo meets New Orleans Jazz Club meets Cirque-du-Soleil feel and vibe.
Basically...  it's ULTRA COOL and Fantastic!
We fell in love with it immediately.

The Drinks - - 
Hand crafted and incredibly unique.  
You really do need to be adventurous, and just trust them because unless you are a crazy bartender that makes all kinds of drinks... you won't recognize half the ingredients.

The Food - - 
Even more reason to fall in love with this place.  
Almost every dish they brought out was phenomenal.
There were only a couple that were ""very good"".
Most were ... ""Oh, It's Gone, Let me lick the plate and Let's order another"" type of dish.
The style is family or tapas style (but not Spanish).... so small plates meant to be shared.
We ordered a number of different items.  The most noteworthy and exceptional were: the Steak Tartare, the Rabbit, the Pork Belly, the Seared Scallops and the Short Ribs.  I've never had Steak Tartare before and now I'm a fan.  This one was rich and creamy.  Oh man... while writing this ... I'm re-living the bites right now.
The menu changes slightly so what's posted on-line isn't exactly the same as what we saw.

Oh!  Save Room for Dessert!!!
They have a number of amazing looking desserts.  One is a chocolate dessert that comes in a glass dome and looks like a plant... it's all edible.  We didn't get this but the table next to us did and they really enjoyed it.  
I saw S'mores on the menu and almost got that until my eyes saw Bananas Foster... and Yes, it's done tableside... Flames and All!
While it wasn't the best ever BF I've ever had. (I'm something of a BF snob.) It certainly was very rich, very sweet and very sinful.  They don't flame the bananas for very long so you can definitely taste the rum. Oh Yea!  Lick The Plate!

The Entertainment - - 
Live music... so it was a bit loud and hard to hold a conversation but it is Fantastic.
We also saw a Tap Dancer.... he was Amazing! Tap Dancing is not a lost art... it's alive and well at RRL and it's not to be missed.
We also saw a juggler-slash-contortionish. She was pretty darn flexible and coordinated. (something I'm not) So, we were impressed and wow-ed!

Overall - - 
Totally going again!  Maybe next month... Too soon?  Nah!  :)

First of all, their Herb Brioche Rolls, which sound delicious, were uninteresting and texturally weak. The butter was delicious. The foie gras looked pretty, but it wasn't seared properly or high quality. The scallops were cooked well, but not interesting...a disconnect from the environment and entertainment. The highly recommended beef stroganoff was not seasoned well or tender enough. At first, I thought we just ordered the wrong dishes, but many of these dishes were recommended by the server as signature plates.

The service was not exceptional or impressive. They have this concept where the servers wear whatever they want. Some of the bussers dressed better than the servers...still think there should be a standard, and it seems Management is lacking in their dress code check of the staff. It was sometimes difficult to tell who worked there and who didn't...it would be great if there was one piece of clothing that would differentiate the customers from the servers. Our water was not consistently filled, constantly had to ask for ice (because that is not part of their normal service, and this is Vegas in August!). Just expected more from the service...Wicked Spoon right outside of Rose.Rabbit.Lie offers better and more attentive service!

Lastly, the entertainment is fantastic! Every act is unique in their own way. The house band is excellent. You want to watch everything and not go anywhere else!

There are a ton of roaming entertainers, including a a piano player, an 8-bit band(?), a burlesque dancer, tap dancers, magicians, a beatboxer, aerialists, etc. performing every 15 min or so. So you're paying for an overall experience, which is cool. I spoke to some diners about the performances and they all said they were welcome distractions and didn't take anything away from the meal. So there's that...

Take some time to explore the different rooms and all of their features. You'll find little quirky things all over the place. At midnight the venue opens up and there's a small show with many of the roaming performers. In the end, I dropped $100 on drinks, but was entertained thoroughly for 2.5 hours. Sure, that $$ could've bought a Cirque tik, but this is a totally different experience.

The entertainment was fun to watch.  We saw singers, a break dancer, and a tap dancer.  They made the restaurant come alive.

Service was alright to me.  I'm not sure what happened exactly but the hostess had some kind of problem with my reservation and then questioned me after my party was seated.  We didn't really see our waitress at all during our experience.  

Food was alright, it really depends on what you order.  

Brioche rolls: Very good starters.  Rolls were soft and fluffy with delicious butter.
Caviar Flatbread: This disappointed me.  I expected something fancy and delicious but it just looked like they made a chessy flatbread and then dump a scoop of caviar to jack up the price.  I think I would have been happier with the taco instead.
Beef stroganoff: Very greasy and tiny as hell for the price.  It looked funny since it was literally a piece of meat with a noodle on top.
Duck Confit Pasta: My favorite.  Duck was tender.  Perfect lemon flavoring added to the pasta.
The Cookie Jar: This is a brilliant idea.  We were all pretty full but we just couldn't leave without dessert.  There was a lot of variety and surprises in the beautiful jar.  We passed it around the table and everyone grabbed what their heart desired.  Everything in the jar was delicious and satisfied our sweet tooth.

It's a very small and intimate setting with no bad seats in the house.  When you enter through the doors it feels like you are a part of the show.

I wont give too many details but it's a great modern variety show that's very funny, entertaining, and stretches some boundaries.  

Some of my favorites are the opening act where the women balances about 20 3-5 foot sticks.  Other favorite acts included the crazy tennis guy who fit his body through 2 tennis rackets.   Tons more.  The music was great.

The only knock is with the extremely high price of drinks.  We ordered 2 soda waters with lime and it was $15.  However, the show made up for it.   I havent seen Absinthe but cant wait to go see it.

Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and did a fabulous job bringing out the plates at a consistent pace so we never had too much or too little to choose from. He dis forget to order our Salmon dish BUT made up for it by bringing us an extra plate of Scallops on the house.

Food: 4.5/5
Onto the food, our server suggested 3-4 dishes per guest to share since the portions are smaller and it is a tapas style restaurant, he also suggest 3-4 mains to share among the group. We opted for 2 dishers per guest and ordered 4 main dishes wish turned out to be a perfect amont of food for our group of 7 (4 females, 3 males). The ""on tap"" moscow Mules & Paloma's were delicious and all in all our group spent $650 for the evening which includes the L.E.T (Live Entertainment Tax). We left a gratuity on top of that as well.

Entertainment: 4.25/5
We had a reso for 8pm and this seemed to coincide with the start of the live entertainment. We fortuantely were seated in a booth in the main bar near the ""piano stage"" I am calling it since another room also had a stage. This location was perfect as we had clear view of the performers and were close enough that they would interact with us while they performed.
The enteraintment was a mix of singers, tap dancers & a young asian break dancer named Bailey who we loved.  Each performer wore a costume to match the 1930's ambience of the place. If you want less interaction with the entertainment then it makes sense to sit towards the back of the restaurant.

Ambience/Decor: 5/5

The issue here is value for money. 

We paid $130 each + some bogus service charges for ""VIP Seating,"" which is on a couch, on the floor, behind three rows of folding chairs. Any action that wasn't elevated on the stage couldn't be seen. I felt extra bad for the ""VIPs"" seated to my right, who were seated so far stage left that they strained to see the entire show, craning their necks. They couldn't see *anything* that appeared on the drop down screen. Drinks were absurdly expensive as well.

I think the show is fun and has its moments. It's sometimes clever, sometimes acrobatic, but sometimes obvious and toilet humoury--which has its place, but not at these prices. There was nothing spectacular about it. It was a circus sideshow--sword eater, ball juggler, table-thumping, man in a dinosaur costume, and a ginormous ping pong ball explosion. There seemed to be no governing principle tying these things together. It was all for shock value.

Instead of leaving gratified and mystified like I do with most shows, I left thinking ""Huh. That was weird.""

Drinks
-Our friend had one of their cocktails and enjoyed it a lot. 
-My husband got a coffee (he was feeling tired and wanted to be able to stay up to go out), and kept proclaiming it to be the best coffee he's ever had. It was served in a clear glass cup (nothing too special, but he enjoyed the look), with a butter cookie on the side. Our friend and him split another one of these at the end of the meal.

Food - exceptional! We appreciated the vast menu of veggie options, as well as the generally large serving sizes for the price.
-Spring pizza - Again, my husband declared this was the best pizza! It was served on a flakey, almost puff-pastry-like crust. It was light on cheese (we prefer), with basil pesto and a hearty serving of lemon. It was the best description of spring pizza I'd seen with those flavors mixing.
-Tomato-braised lentils - This was another great one. A bit salty for me, but one of our friends said this was her favorite dish of the night. It was heavy on the tomato and a very generous portion of lentils cooked perfectly. 
-Glazed brussel sprouts - These reminded me of my favorite brussel sprouts at Mezetto in NYC. A touch of sweet and salty, with a bit of manchego cheese to top it all off.
-Spring pea cavatelli - After we had spring peas on a toast in Santa Monica, my husband has been searching for them in dishes again. They are the perfect mix of earthy crunch. The pasta was also cooked to perfection.
-Our friends had a few meat dishes that they loved.
-Chocolate Terrarium dessert - WOW! It's pricey, but if you don't have a lot of drinks, the bill still comes out very reasonable with this, especially for the entertainment and service you're getting too. This is the most phenomenal dessert I've ever seen (see picture too). The menu description doesn't do the artistry justice - it simply lists Chocolate Pudding, Chocolate Buttermilk Cake, Chocolate ""Soil"", Pu ed Wild Rice, Crispy Chocolate Tuile and Hazelnut Ice Cream. It is a work of art and delicious to boot! More of a dark chocolate flavor for sure. We also saw them make the bananas foster, and while the table side production is cool, the chocolate dessert is more of an amazing presentation.

Service
Very attentive. From changing out plates to wiping crumbs from the table to making sure our water was refilled consistently - nothing was overlooked!

Entertainment
Unfortunately, no shows were going on this evening. But we did see three phenomenal singers go through the restaurant, one great tap dancer and a hip hop dancer. It seemed like they all tended to meander more toward the band (in the other room from us), but it was still very enjoyable and differentiated.

3168304,2014-03-21,6,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Just the right amount of wrong. That about sums this place up. 
I was expecting a typical crowded dance club with loud music and annoying people spilling drinks all over the place, but was pleasantly surprised with an indescribable experience. It was one of those times I wanted to scream at my friends, ""You have to see this for yourself!"" since describing it in words did not seem to do the place justice.

You first enter a high ceilinged foyer and proceed into a darker room with a small stage on the right. Booths and small tables stand anxiously only a few feet away from the stage as sitting onlookers watch the double jointed break dancer move on this stage in ways that made his body look like Gumby, totally boneless! This stage wrapped around all the way to the other side into a much larger auditorium type room with comfy leather seats wrapped around in a semi circle around the other half of the stage, but this side has a catwalk protruding from the stage,

The circular part of the stage rotates. A talented female beat boxer was shooting out rhymes faster than Kanye West ever would it seemed while the stage was spinning and the break dancer continued the dance moves. Bring on green frog, a man in half a chicken suit, an Asian fairy with ""pixie dust"" that looked a lot like cocaine but maybe it was just sugar, dancers dressed in Steampunk suits or lack there of. There was definitely no separation from the performers and the audience. Everyone was mixed into the action. The energy was fun and lively and didn't stop there.

There are two bars straddling the sides of the auditorium type room and as we got drinks, an elegant ballerina/acrobat came out and balanced upsidedown while holding her weight biting down on a pole and shot a compound bow hitting an arrow straight through the target on the opposite end of the catwalk - Crazy Cirque du Soleil type unbelievable act! 

A fire eater dazed everyone with dancing and playing with fire while a remixed version of Audioslave's Cochise was playing in the background only moments later. Then, a blonde first dressed in baggy janitor wear, stripped down to a beautiful blue glittery prom style gown, and then to almost nothing but tassels, while dazzling with more dancing. Then there was an act with slapping hands on a table with powder and more dancing. A strip tease occurred pulling a member from the audience to sit on the chair in front of everyone, but just when things got interesting, we learn, it was meant for something else. Totally random shtuff... 

I'm not sure exactly how much time passed, but suddenly the walls closed splitting the auditorium type room and the other side, and you are forced to go to the auditorium type room to continue the fun. The catwalk disappears and suddenly the place is now a true dance club. A beautiful DJ dressed on Baroque era elegant clothing with high standing wig and all remixes and plays what seems to be everyone's favorite song at some point from Nirvana remix to today's hits to 90s R&B-Rap - everything was hit. To break the monotony of traditional, performers would randomly enter the center of the dance floor and start swing dancing, or a band would play sick drum solos or that tall handsome guy would rap tribute ""Let Me Clear my Throat,"" while everyone screamed with excitement and got down. Even the song, ""Don't Stop Believing"" by Journey came on. 

My hubby absolutely hates clubs and reportedly tells people that this was one of the best nights he's had and would return again. He, who I literally have to drag out to make an appearance, actually really loved this place. I am impressed!! It was just us and my hubby's best friend and his wife. The four of us had a blast and all thanks to @brian_t_at_marquee_lasvegas for introducing us to this place!

The entertainment here is quirky Vegas. They have live singers with a band and then the shows themselves include acts like tap dancers, contortionists, more live music, etc. It's a pretty cool show, especially considering there's no ticket price! The vibe here in general is one of my favorites in Vegas. 

The drinks here are cocktail masterpieces. I really enjoyed my Moscow Mule which is award-winning. They are all craft cocktails, made from scratch and taste delicious. We shared a couple tapas plates and the one that stood out the most was the Wagyu steak.

3229466,2015-09-05,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I went here with A LOT of family and didn't really know what to expect. I found out that the family matriarch had reserved a private room for this family reunion/double birthday party. We were seated in a main dining area at first. Then when attention was brought to the fact that a private room had been booked we were ushered into a room/bar area. There were people sitting at the bar, I thought that maybe once they left that they wouldn't bring more people in, but they did...which made the whole toast part of the evening kind of awkward.
Our table was really small and we were pretty crammed, but drinks were good. Then came the food...I was underwhelmed by most of it. I liked the duck confit, but for some reason the noodles in the dish were comically long. The asparagus dish was a joke, a caricature of what you would expect a asparagus dish to be at a fancy restraint, that being 1-2 spears on a pretentiously dressed plate.
For our entree, I ordered a medium rare filet minion. My filet was pretty good, a bit too salty though and the green stuff it sat on was sad and flavorless (cooked spinach maybe? I don't remember). Everyone but my daughter ordered a medium rare filet. All but one of these filets came out cooked medium rare. Unfortunately, this filet went to my cousin, who happens to be an executive chef. That's when it became clear how bad the management at this restaurant was on this particular night. 
Our chef relative very nicely asked for a new filet, as the one she recieved was overcooked. 
The manager brought her another one and asked if she would cut it open, she did, and again the steak was overcooked. She asked the manager what temp the steak was cooked to and he said medium rare plus. She told him ""I'm a chef, there is no medium rare plus."" The manager then began to argue with her that because of the process they use, they can't cook the filet to medium rare, at which point she very purposely looked at each of our steaks that had been cooked medium rare, but the manager either ignored this or didn't realize. 
The manager asked her to try a ribeye instead. Really? You want to trade out a filet for a ribeye? She clearly wasn't happy about this and said she didn't really want a ribeye, but if that's all they can do then fine. She was brought a ribeye that looked very grisly, even in the dim light. She took a bite and spit it into her napkin, saying it was very overcooked. Then my husband tried it and also spit it into his napkin...I have never, EVER seen my husband spit food out. Then a piece was given to my 12 year old daughter, who stabbed it repeatedly just to tenderize it enough to get it on her fork. She too deemed it ""really tough"" my daughter was also underwhelmed by her pasta dish. (She's 12, it shouldn't take much to impress her. Give her a totinos pizza and she will gobble it up)
The manager came back after this whole ordeal and was told he should really take a look at the food that was coming out of the kitchen. He said nothing and just put the plate on a shelf near the bar, where it sat there rotting until we left (maybe it's still there). My cousin at this point was pretty livid and just asked for bread, which she nibbled on while fuming.
To put it in perspective; my cousin stated "" I have sent food back six times in my life, three of them were tonight.""
This would be unacceptable at any restaurant, but is ludacrious at this price point.
I would have given this place one star, but the bartender and servers were good and much more attentive and cared more than the manager so they alone brought the rating up.",O0o7XCUaTt0EOPFx0OfUMA,0,1,2,n7bMJuMbBQeYxKtLpQN_eQ

3250376,2017-05-01,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I decided to spoil myself last week and visit Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I must say that my party of one was an 'over-the-top' WOW experience!

Walking in, I was greeted by a hostess and several oversized closed doors and was told which to go through depending on what I was looking for. Once inside, I was told that it may be last call (oh no!!)  BUT a chef calmed my thoughts confirming I would be able to indulge...so I did.

When I say experience, I mean it starts from the beginning (walking in), through the end. RRL is into details, from the service and presentation, down to the printed silverware, and to the amazing talents. I love that it felt like an intimate speak easy to me! My server Ryan, (lord help me if that isn't his name! It has been a week) explained I was in for a treat with the shows, and I had the perfect seat.

I ordered the crispy oysters (yum!), black Tonnarelli (incredible),  and my favorite within the 'Pearls For A Spoon' segment on the menu, are the caviar tacos with the Russian Golden Osetra option.  After I had the first bite, I immediately ordered another. It couldn't be over!! With an oceanic flavor that is not overwhelming, these bites melted in my mouth. The crispness of the potato shell, is the perfect texture combo and flavor enhancer. I have found my Vegas guilty pleasure. 

Once my meal was complete, Ryan brought me a dessert menu to look over. Though these all sounded amazing, I was a bit full. However, Ryan surprised me with a mini dessert terrarium! I was blown away by the gorgeous display. My photo does not do this art display any justice, you have to see for yourself (and yes, this tasted incredible). Very fun!

Thank you to Rose. Rabbit. Lie for an amazing experience and an incredible evening. I will be back!",p9V1lqCHXWbwUM0xsHliBw,2,0,5,hi8CS6704tjCn4dtWTYORw

This place is very very pricey. But you pay for the experience! I love the cosmopolitan, everything in there from the decor to the buffet is super contemporary and rose rabbit lie keeps with that theme. 

It's a cross between a restaurant, lounge, and night club. I don't know how else to put it. There's live entertainment which I really enjoyed. That night we had a jazz band which first featured a lady juggling balls dancing on top of the piano and then we had someone sing. Love it. 

The food is served tapas style. 

Calamari: skip. Not good. Not crispy. 

Salmon: this was so good. It's cooked in a plastic bag which your server has to cut open. The fish was buttery and moist. Citrus sauce with tomatoes and potatoes. 

Potato gratin: also a favorite that night. Served in a mini cast iron skillet, it comes out super hot. Crispy on top.

Beet salad: variety of beets with avocado and a creme fraiche. I love beets so this was great, but very very small portion. 

Loved the overall experience here, great place to grab drinks. Just make sure you're wallet is prepared, I mean they do have a $1200 crab.",X8IAENX8apicBoKNHa0cvg,2,2,5,nTfkhjg5BNADRHxuRV6LJQ

I was worried about being interrupted while eating as I don't really like being involved in the show, and it was two WONDERFUL singers just walking through the restaurant singing standards and modern hits. The band was great and was the appropriate volume, which was another concern. We were headed to a show at 9, so we were dressed up for the occasion and felt perfectly dressed there. Would definitely recommend!

Food-wise, they ask that you order all at once so that they can bring out your meal as it will best compliment each other. We ordered the herb brioche rolls, a rabbit special, the duck confit pasta, the poutine and the brussels sprouts. It was more than enough food for two people and all of it was rich and delicious.

salad that was drenched in vinegar.  They also encourage you to order 3-4 dishes per person! They say it's a tasting menu. I was full after my salad...could barely get through the entree.

Before dinner, we stopped by the bar to have a drink. The bartender recommended me try their rumble in the jungle cocktail and it was delicious! For dinner, we ordered four appetizers to share. Two of their signature appetizers: wagyu steak tartare and short rib stroganoff. The tartare tasted fresh and nicely seasoned. It's really good! The short rib was very tender, but nothing special tastewise. We also ordered seared foie gras (which is always a must in my book and yes, this place cooked it right!) and duck confit  pasta, which was the only dish I didn't like. Waaaay too salty! I have to say the pasta was perfectly cooked al dente though!  For entrée, I had their pot au pho. It's their play of a deconstructed pho. It's basically a filet mignon with a slice of brisket, 2 meatballs, a mini foie gras, and a small amount of broth poured into the dish. I really liked this dish. The filet was cooked perfectly. The brisket was tender. The meatballs were flavorful. The foie gras was just a great bonus for me! Lol the broth was tasty.  From service standpoint, our server was not that great. Kinda had an attitude. He should take a note or two from the bartenders at the bar cos they were very pleasant! Honestly though, there are other way better restaurants in Vegas for the price!

So for 8 of us, we had to pay $64 just to have the cake cut and put on plates.

The $16 daiquiri was delicious...but the night went down quickly. The snooty prissy waiter buzzed about with efficiency but void of personality or convivial spirit.

The food is precious-foodie;  miniaturized versions of real dishes. My wife enjoyed her beet salad, which consisted of two razor thin beets and a soul patch of lettuce and radicchio.

If you're not familiar with poutine , it's a traditional hearty Canadian dish of French fries, curds and gravy. Here, it's four super tiny fingerling potatoes served in the smallest ramekin imaginable (think espresso cup), unremarkably flavored for $16.

Sweet corn with an odd sea foam like froth that was airy, but ugly and actually got it the way of the canned-like corn.

The beef stroganoff was a small sweaty salty stringy rib with no sour cream. $32

Then there was the entertainment. Imagine an experimental jazz group playing music written by Sponge Bob Square Pants. It was juvenile and sounded like they were under water. Here's a tip: find a song with a melody.

I suppose I should be grateful for the pace. In at 6:30, out at 7:15. No lingering here. Obviously a rush to turn tables.

I would change the name to something simpler. Drop the first two words and just call this place Lie....its designed for suckers who are easily hoodwinked by chi chi talk as a ruse to charge $125 (not including tip) for $8 of ingredients.",BgZwJBhVWKq1Urs4rKBdiA,4,3,2,PnDqnu3-oUwYoNc4REHokg

The bar/lounge area we went into was where most of the performance was happening at.  The stage even changes throughout the performances and is surrounded by a semi-circle of seats.

The singer is sassy with an amazing voice.  The dancers were awesome and they provided a huge range of dance from tap to breakdancing to jazz (shoutout especially to the little filipino boy dancing to Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars).  The dancers even borrowed members in the audience to join in their performance and they would dance throughout the lounge.  You'll definitely get a close and interactive experience here!!  The entire vibe was awesome.  Apparently you have to buy tickets to have a seated view, but we saw decently from standing near the bar.  They even open up the floor for the audience to dance every so often.  

The other side of the stage is connected to the restaurant side.  There's a smaller stage back there with a more relaxed act during dinner.

The band, a good one, and the singers, also good, setup in the bar area and we watched from the next room, although there were no barriers. There is no focus on the music from those eating and drinking. It is background noise. That is a shame.

1. Old fashioned was TERRIBLE. Had to send it back.
2. Moscow mule was way too sweet, very little alcohol. I thought this was supposed to be a mixology themed restaurant?
3. The short rib was overcooked. 
4. The penne rigatoni was not bad but needed salt. Too watery. 
5. Steak tartare was our favorite (and the only good) dish.
6. The potatoes were just okay, total letdown.

Rose.Rabbit.Lie is a restaurant. Vegas Nocturne is a show with two performances. But over the evening the one kind of blends into the other and where you eat dramatically affects how much 'show' is in your dinner theatre. There are quiet rooms that focus on the food, medium rooms that offer a mix, and a noisily packed bar/dining room in which enjoying one's dinner would be nearly impossible. When making your reservation (speaking with your hostess?) you should let them know what you want.

That said, the food itself is inventive and for the most part utterly delicious. Almost everything comes in small plates so you'll have a chance to sample many dishes though the prices are aggressive. BTW, the mixed drinks are spectacular.",5qIwy91T9rAQj3_2O4cn5g,0,0,5,5CS9cz23AJfBETVFtBn14g

3453673,2014-02-17,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Wow. The first description that comes to mind is Alice in Wonderland meets Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I don't even know where to start.  It's dreamy and prohibition era feeling, but every now and then you will see something that makes you wonder if someone slipped drugs in your drink at the blackjack table earlier. We had the whole experience here for Valentine's Day including dinner, lots of drinks and comped seats for both the 8pm and 10pm cantos. We enjoyed dinner in the study and were amazed by the quality of the drinks, especially those exclusive to the study. Yes, they're pricey, but they're handcrafted cocktails that take a bit more work than a rum & coke (and taste a ton better) and we noticed the quantity was pretty good too (not overloaded with ice like many bars). Between my husband and I, we probably tried 8-10 different drinks and were consistently impressed by each one. Our server did a great job of steering us towards (or away) from drinks based on what we liked about our prior beverages too. 

For dinner, we chose to do the Valentine's menu which was AMAZING in every regard. There were separate ""his"" and ""hers"" menus with different choices for the first 2 courses and for dessert, truncated by a shared main dish. First, we were brought a nicely presented brioche bread. I like bread, but I can usually pass it up to save room for the real meal. One look at this bread and I knew I wouldn't be passing it up. Best bread I've ever had!  It was freshly baked, warm, lightly salted and so soft it almost melted in your mouth. We loved it so much, we ended up ordering more of it during the show later! We then had a fabulous lobster cocktail and fried oysters rockefeller. We fell in love with the lobster cocktail and thought it was a pretty good amount of lobster for a a first course! We then had a loup de mer and a duck confit pasta. I didn't think I was a duck fan, but I am now. That pasta was cheesy flavorful deliciousness!  Our main course was a shared Beef Wellington dish (a smaller version of their $275 ""feast"" on the regular menu). WOW. We were both floored by this dish. From the foie gras and shaved truffle to the perfectly cooked beef and beautiful pastry dome, every aspect of this dish was perfection on a plate. I can't even remember exactly what our desserts were, but we nearly licked both plates. I know one had butterscotch pudding and the other was little peaks of what looked like meringue but tasted so much dreamier. Then there were the chocolates. I bit into the first one (a salted caramel chocolate) and promptly yelled ""Oh my god!"" It was that good.  We later found out the chocolates were house made, they need to box those up and sell them!

As we were wrapping up dinner, we began to take in the decor more. Behind me was a nice collection of jazz and soul records, and next to it a picture of a man resembling Robert Plant in the 60s sitting on a tractor wearing nothing but a banana hammock. Nothing like a bit of contrast! As we were paying our tab the oddities began. A hunched over guy in a sweat suit climbs up a ladder and disappears into the wall, twin tap dancers emerge from another wall and start dancing on the bar. A wonderful singer emerges from somewhere else. It made me so excited to see what was in store at the two shows we were about to see! We wandered out, opening random doors to see what else the place had in store. My husband even nearly walked into the kitchen on our self tour, but nobody seemed to mind much! The bigger main dining rooms were buzzing with energy, but it made me appreciate our experience in the quiet little study even more. With a large group though, the bigger rooms would be a blast! 

We made our way in for the 8pm canto, which began in an ethereal and dreamy way and took us on a ride of comedy, disbelief, music and sexuality. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't been, but we were amazed and loved the entire show. It was like an upscale freak show! We had a short break after the 8pm show and went back in for the 10pm. This time we were seated in the back row closest to the bar in individual arm chairs with a little cocktail table in front of us. So cozy! We couldn't help but order some food (more of that awesome bread and some great calamari!) The 10pm canto was markedly different in tone to the 8pm, much more sexually charged, more foul language (much to my delight), a more upbeat disco sort of feel. I loved that the shows were SO different. Many of the performers were the same, but their acts were different in every way so nothing was repeated from the 8pm. We also had tickets for 12pm and I wish we could've gone but we had to take off to meet a friend. I could've stayed there all night though, I was having such a great time!!  I think Rose.Rabbit.Lie makes for a perfect date night and also can't wait to try it out with a group of friends next time we're in town!

I ordered the caviar tacos (osetra upgrade), the uni perciatelli, the foie gras torchon and duck fat fries, as well as the bone marrow. Everything was delicious. The wine pairings were great too. Then I went to the 10:00 Nocturne show, which I absolutely loved. It was raunchy and entertaining. We stayed for the 12am show and danced a little after.

3459261,2016-03-14,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Excellent food and top-notch service in a fully engaging music and theater focused environment at a price point that seems incongruous with the experience.

I had the pleasure of eating twice at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. and so my opinion is formed by a data sample that may be larger than some. In both cases I experienced the tasting menu with a group. In both cases the cuisine was imaginative and delicious. Each dish built on the previous one extremely well and built anticipation for what was coming next. Plates are small but dense and full of flavor. The first courses were seafood heavy but set up the palate nicely for the pasta and beef dish that came towards the end. You'll have the opportunity to experience caviar and foie gras in the same evening. If the food were the end of the story, it alone would be worth the price of admission. But, it turns out, the food is table stakes at this eatery.

The mid-week experience included a wonderful live band and two phenomenal vocalists who kept us more than entertained throughout the meal. The Saturday evening experience raised the ante significantly by turning the entire restaurant into a theater with dancers appearing secret doors overhead and a stage that appeared from behind an ornate curtain that initially seemed merely decorative. All the performers were top-notch and the variety of music and dance kept things engaging. Singers roam the floor bringing diners into the show. I even got to appear on stage with Sky, a vocalist who made sure I wasn't allowed any inhibitions. Everyone in my party was blown away by the show on both evenings.

The music (even the bumper tunes) is a main focal point--Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is not for those wanting a quiet evening where chatting with others is a primary goal so set your expectations accordingly. But even those in our party who were initially put off by the volume came around after a few songs (and, admittedly drinks) because the performances are so engaging.

The trifecta for both nights was the service. Both servers we had were attentive, aware of the situation at the table at all times, and paced the meal perfectly. Support staff was equally attentive--empty plates were removed promptly and settings were replaced before new courses came to the table without fail. Occasionally the course descriptions were given too quickly and lost in the environmental noise so hold onto a menu if you want to explore the fabulous ingredients you're enjoying. We had some of the best service we had while in Vegas.

In this diner's opinion, Rose. Rabbit. Lie. should be on any tourist's list. Oh, and ask about the name. Let me know what they tell you and we'll compare notes.",2O_IjvT8NKGzdW2qCGi0kw,2,1,5,0ythitqlvN8bnaGW2Zo_Cw

In case you're confused about what Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is, it's a show, restaurant, and bar all in one. The night we went, we did all three. We saw the show first, which was great. It's the same people who do Absinthe (which I love) over at Caesar's Palace. While I'm glad I saw the show at Rose. Rabbit. Lie., Absinthe is way better and worth your money so much more. The show at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. feels like a less funny, trying harder version of Absinthe.

If you stop by the bar area, you get plenty of entertainment without the show price. There are dancers and different acts stopping by every 15 minutes or so. They're the same people who are in the show. Some of them are pretty amazing and fun to watch. The drinks are delicious but a little on the pricey side.

By far, the best thing about Rose. Rabbit. Lie is the food. The restaurant was amazing! The next morning, I woke up still craving the brussel sprouts and the calamari. Everything we had was amazing. The service was great and there's great attention to detail. The silverware gets propped up by what looks like fancy monopoly pieces. The food is tapas style, so even though each plate isn't expensive, the bill adds up pretty quickly.

So.....20 minutes later we finally got waters and someone took our order, we tried to flag people down numerous times and didn't understand why a red-headed girl was just standiing in the corner texting and talking to the bartender. A table had the chocolate terrarium delivered and I didn't know what it was, no one had started eating it but I saw they had forks.

I hear that all of them are different. The 8Pm has a multiple acts with a little sexual mixed with comical. Can't forget the cutest actor of all. A puppy dressed in a dragon costume. Heart melted. The first act was crazy impressive with a girl balancing a feather on the end of these sticks. It is hard to describe but so worth it. The couple act where they acted out songs for it was hilarious.  No seat in the place is a bad seat.

The drinks are pricey but very tasty. I have not try the food yet but on my to do list. 

The place was packed after the show so I didn't stay after to drink. I plan to see the other shows and maybe hang out earlier to get more of the experience.

Every restaurant in the Cosmo seems to think they're the only option in town until they have locals who come once and never again, as is my experience and RRL. The GM Julio actually took the time to come over to our table (per our request) to say hello, however he missed a HUGE opportunity to gain repeat business by acting like our $400 tab was insignificant although we were the only table eating and added insult to injury as he walked passed us multiple times in the ""club"" area afterwards without so much as a simple hello or thank you.

The entertainment was on point--it rotated between two different lounge singers, a tap dancer and a break dancer. Definitely made dinner fun. We started with the potato rosettes--honestly I could have eaten about a pound of those potatoes, yum! I ordered the chicken with pesto and gnocchi which was so tender and the pesto was so flavorful! My husband ordered the smoked pork belly and this was the star meal. They bring it out with a glass lid so you can see all the smoke. Then they lift the lid and it's the most heavenly smokey smell. The pork belly was so delicious we raved about it to our family and friends. Ended the meal with the cheesecake which was good but nothing amazing.

We had pre-purchased tickets to the 8pm show, and made a dinner reservation directly after.  The show itself was both amazing and mind boggling; consisting of comedy, dance, acrobatics, music, and just plain oddities.  The performance lasted about an hour and a half, and is one that can truly not be missed.

The venue itself is super cool, and is comprised of many rooms emulating a ""mansion"".  We were ushered into the study after the show where we had handcrafted cocktails prepared by the mixologist (who, by the way, totally dressed the part), and then taken to our table for dinner.  Let me add that the crystal glass wear here is totally on point!

Dinner was a great mix of small plates, and from my experience, you can't really go wrong here.  A few of my must-try recommendations would be the brioche, beet salad, shortrib, and duck pasta.  If you have a hankering for caviar, the selection here is BEYOND!  While we ate, a couple of different live acts made their way through the room, including a pair of amazing tap dancers!

Post-meal we had the pleasure of watching a ""secret show"" that is in a private room and only hosts ~12 guests at a time.  I would lovvvvve to expand upon this, but that would ruin the surprise! Hint: don't give the snack guy any money ;)",_gGmS9ktBBxXWnLO7IJwAw,10,8,5,amh-wsEJF1EYNKBeI58-7w

3642895,2014-02-28,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"This place is weird - in the best way possible!  Came for dinner on a Saturday night with two friends.  Made the reservation on Open Table 3 days before - no problem.

I was a bit thrown off in the beginning. You see someone at the front door, who then shows you to someone else.  That someone then walks you inside, where you are greeted by another person, and then taken to a ""holding area.""  Then that person, after trying to sell you the $130 per person show, checks you in.  After all this, you are escorted to your table.  

The dining room is on the smaller side (as compared to other Vegas eating establishments), and has a lively, yet intimate feeling.  There is an awkward elegance about the whole thing - from the way the wait staff is dressed to the chandeliers, it all screams Mad Hatter chic.  

Drink: we ordered a $45 flask filled with the most delicious vodka concoction.  The name escapes me (Blue Moon maybe?), but it was light blue in color and absolutely delicious.  We were apprehensive about the price at first, but it gave all 3 of us a very nice buzz,  and we got to keep the flask.  We almost ordered another one... almost.  

Food breakdown:
- herb brioche rolls: just the butter alone is worth the $4.  Quite possibly the best butter I've ever tasted.   
- vegetable crudite: interesting presentation, but a pass at $15.  Veggies are baby-sized (couple of baby carrots, some baby radishes), and the mushroom floor (spongy in texture) and green goddess sauce - although nice on the palate - do not justify the price.  
- curried cauliflower: one of my favorites.  The portion was small, but flavors were spot-on.
- brussel sprouts: asked for it sans crispy chicken skin, and they were able to accommodate.  Tasty; cooked to perfection.   
- heavenly eggs: extremely fragile so be careful when handling. (I learned the hard way). Small in size but big in flavor - they don't skimp on the truffle. 
- oysters on the 1/2 shell: friends enjoyed it, but stated they were ""thin.""  I don't eat oysters so I have no idea what that meant, and was too tipsy at that point to ask.
- mushroom flatbread: our waiter recommended this as a vegetarian option and it was incredibly tasty.  Not on the menu, so the accommodation was greatly appreciated.  
- pan roasted salmon: friends thought it was the worst dish of the night
- french fries: made with duck fat so vegetarians beware (waiter warned me). 

note: that they bring the food out one or two items at a time, and in a specific order. This is tremendously beneficial for people (like myself) who cannot pace themselves while eating. It also really allows you to enjoy the ambiance. 

Entertainment: acts will spill over from the show/bar area next door and into the dining area.  In the time we were there, we witnessed tap dancing twins, fushigi, and a man dressed like a clown playing with metallic rings (creepy).  We also caught some of the burlesque/singing happenings in the other room.    

Although there were some misses (initial arrival situation, some of the food), the whole experience was quite enjoyable and unique.  2 1/2 hours flew by and all I can remember is laughing, clapping, singing, eating, and drinking to my heart's delight.  All in all, it was money well spent, and I'll surely return the next time I'm in town.",xfrRKuHXbvz7J_dShdsTHw,20,1,5,Q4kQ6m8B7e9G4O9wrmF29A

Ambiance- 5/5 Exceptional ambiance. 3 different rooms with slightly different curation. Very nice decor and lighting.

Some of my favorite dishes from the night: 
Heavenly Egg, Slow Roasted Octopus, short rib stroganoff & all their deserts.

3663064,2014-01-01,2,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Overall, I would come back to catch the show but the food is nothing out of the ordinary. 

Location (5 stars): Located next to wicked spoon buffet on the second floor in the cosmopolitan.

Ambiance (5 stars): Whole restaurant set in 1920s gay atmosphere to incorporate a glimpse of the ""canto"" (show) with dinner. There are three different cantos nightly at 8pm, 10pm, 12am. The canto are about two hour long and cost ~$100 but the midnight showing is ~$30. Even though you are only here for dinner, an entertainment tax will be added to your bill since the canto start off in. There are many doors that lead to 6 different rooms. 

Food (3 stars): I had set high expectations for the food but rose.rabbit.lie did not deliver. The portions are indeed small since its tapas, but for the price to quality and taste ratio it was not worth the bang for the buck. We had caviar  taco, Brussels sprouts, Rockefeller oysters, rabbit fricassee, foie gras torchon, and I don't remember the name for dessert.

Caviar taco: World's smallest taco...1 taco about the size of a 1/2 dollar for $15. Saltiness  from caviar mixed with freshness of the raw fish.  I would skip this unless you want to see something cute.

Brussels sprouts: I have been fond of this veggie and it was cooked to perfection.  Caramelized and accompanied with crispy chicken skin and cheese! If you are looking to add a veggie to your meal, this is your dish.

Rockefeller oysters: Nothing amazing comes to mind after trying one of these suckers which cost $4.50 each.

Rabbit: Personally, this dish was not for me. The rabbit was tender but the sauce was on the salty side.

Foie gras torchon: An interesting twist to foie gras. Cold foie gras accompanied with hot duck fat fries. Both portions melts in your mouth.


Service (3 stars): With a nice restaurant excellent service should be a bare necessity, but the restaurant did not deliver this also. It started out with seating us at our table. I had arrived early and was offered to with be seated or wait at the study bar. I opt to wait at the bar until my significant other arrive. We then waited for someone to seat us after our table was ready for about 15mins and no one ever called us. We had to ask about our table before we got seated. Our water glasses were never refilled and the waitress was occupied with too many patrons.

3671266,2014-06-05,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Best show and bar in Vegas! If you love the concept of a speakeasy and live music, this is the place to go. To start with, the food and drinks are unique, well executed, and delicious. You must get the beef stroganoff! ! To die for. The mussels, sea bass, caviar flatbread, and raspberry napolean were also just as beautiful to eat as they were to look at. 

Now for the show. This show is more interesting, beautiful, funny, and just genuine than any show in Vegas, including Cirque shows. The stage makes you feel like you're watching a show at a friend's house; it's very intimate. I dont want to give too much away, but you'll be crying by the end either from the jokes or from being emotionally moved by the performances.

3675171,2014-01-28,5,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Not bad, Cosmo.  Not bad.  Decided try out RRL with the wife and a few friends to figure out what all the hype is about at that ""new place in The Cosmopolitan"".  Hit up a 6pm reservation to try out some of the eats on the restaurant side and decided to focus only on that this time around (in other words, we skipped the show and decided to grub down and budget on that instead).  We were immediately greeted and ushered through a few doors before settling in at our dinner table.  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE RESTAURANT ONLY!  Here's what I experienced:

- Service was ON POINT.  Our waiter and various servers were very attentive to our dinner party and accommodated us whenever we had a question about the menu, drinks, decor, etc.  I would say this was probably the best thing about my RRL experience.  Service is not usually a top priority to me but the staff did damn well and reflected the price I was paying tonight if not more!

- Watch your wallet; the price here is STEEP.  The $$$$ above this review is a correct assessment of the price points you will commit to when visiting.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind shelling out some hard-earned cash for good food.  However, we just came for dinner in a party of 4 and was hit with multiple ""taxes"" including auto-gratuity (18%), an entertainment tax (even though we didn't go to the show), service tax (??) and sales tax (which is a given).  What?  Felt a little blindsided there with all of the charges but I guess coming over to sing a song with the glass harmonica player yielded some kind of extra charge........ remember, restaurant side only.

- The food and drinks.  The food, although served ""tapas style"" and pretty small, was actually pretty good.  I enjoyed the Uni and Lobster Perciatelli, the Branzino on creamed spinach and topped with raisins, and fresh oysters with a side of horseradish butter WHICH WAS THE BOMB BTW.  But the highlight of the night was the BRUSSEL SPROUTS.  Hot damnnn!  You must get this when you come here.  Period.  Those dishes were the culinary highlights IMO and although they didn't amaze the crap out of me for the price, it was pretty damn tasty.  THE DRINKS were pretty good as well.  Reminiscent of cocktails at H&R or The Laundry Room, these drinks hit the spot too.  I opted for the Pisco Punch and it was a nice chill drink to sip on throughout the night.

- The entertainment, although we didn't get to see the show, spilled over into the main room where we were eating for a little bit.  We got to hear a few tunes from the live band, some singing/beatboxing from a performer, and some carnival-like antics.  I would consider coming to just watch the band play but if I get hit with entertainment charges for doing that, then I probably would come less often.. (can't you tell I'm still a little irritated with that ent. charge...) Anyway, from what we saw, it was entertaining and kept us occupied during dinner for a short while and enhanced the ambiance a bit.

Overall, I give the RRL dining experience a 3.5 (rounded up to 4) star.  The ambiance and service was stellar and the food was pretty good but the price and size of the dishes and extra random charges definitely offset the positives of our visit.  I know it's the Cosmo on the strip and all but the charges added on to the bill that wasn't anticipated soured it for me (third time about the ent. charge.. grrr... okay, I'm done now haha).  Like I said, I don't mind spending top dollar for stellar eats but it wasn't a mind blowing awesome experience that would garner an immediate second look. Maybe I will come back to catch the midnight showing of Nocturne at the $27.27 price point but I don't think I'll be back any time soon to dine in only.  I'd rather catch some quick drinks, sit around and listen to some jazz tunes, and converse a little with friends before venturing elsewhere for the night.  Will update on the next visit.

Edit: Looked into the entertainment tax and decided that I shouldn't kill the messenger.. still irritating but that's the way the mandate works, I guess. Nice place and grubs but unfortunately the tax imposed for entertainment w/o seeing the actual show is still a buzzkill.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,8,7,4,EETT3TQu7YWbYmm7mXrymg
3677345,2015-02-23,4,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I fell down the rabbit hole in the Cosmopolitan, and I loved it. 

Just like the commercials say, ""just the right amount of wrong"", Rose. Rabbit. Lie. really is just the right amount of wrong. By the end of my dining experience, and it truly is an experience, I half expected the little white bunnies and kittens to come trotting through the restaurant to their own little ditty. Something RRL should seriously consider. 

In true Alice in Wonderland fashion, RRL is not easily accessed. Of course later we learned there was an elevator near the front of the hotel that took you quite close to the restaurant, but that's no fun. Instead we made our way up the winding staircase and down the long hall to a host's desk positioned outside an unassuming door. Once inside, we were escorted to the ""library"", where we had cocktails during out wait. The cocktails are inventive, imaginative, and just potent enough to make you wonder if Alice herself slipped one of her little mushrooms into your glass. 

After cocktails, we were escorted into the dining room, where the mesmerizing chaos ensued. Hypnotic lighting, gyrating performers, plush and sumptuous booths, and cozy corners make up this intoxicating space. It was enough to just sit and watch the performers dance above us from our booths and sip our drinks, but dinner needed to be had, and the caviar flat bread with a 63 degree egg crooked it's little doughy finger at us from the menu. Also on our order were the brussel sprouts and chicken skin, slow-roasted octopus and chorizo, rock shrimp and butternut squash, frog leg lollipops and chimichurri, and the short rib stroganoff. Everything was exquisite and honestly it's difficult to select my favorite dish. Every pairing was well-complimented by its accoutrements. If the Cheshire Cat were holding me hostage in his tree, I supposed I'd select the octopus. But the flatbread... and but the shrimp... I give up. The cat can poison me. 

Rose. Rabbit. Lie. was our favorite meal of our four-day trip, and we will be back to see what adventures Alice and her gang of mischievous friends have in store for us next.",XtKwxbdNIHjEM3ajUoX9OQ,6,5,5,IyBJTCVjjvraXC4y5pgeuw

Caviar taco

Amazing! It's hard to choose a favorite but I would say the sprouts, beef strog and the caviar taco were the best.

I love small plates so I can try everything. 

Now, for dessert, I was actually disappointed. We tried the chocolate terrarium because of course it was the must try but frankly, it was just too much chocolate for me. I would have rather spent the $35 to try a multitude of different tasting desserts.

Lobster Cocktail: BF's favorite lobster dish throughout the entire vegas trip! the creaminess mixed with lobster meat was the right combination. 
Caviar Taco: A must order here at Rose.Rabbit.Lie. Tiny, but it's to die for, served on a bed of chips.
Glazed Brussel Sprouts: a twist of my favorite veggie with fried chicken skin.
Roasted Foie Gras: It ain't a meal in Vegas unless there's foie gras on the table, and Rose.Rabbit.Lie. serves this dish with a brioche, fig jam, and candid pistachio!!
Bone Marrow: oh my god, this is by far the best bone marrow dish I've tasted, with some sweet and sour short ribs on top!!
Short Rib Stroganoff: unlike any beef stroganoff I've ever had, this dish focuses more on the meat itself, not overly creamy, and the pasta is just there to justify the rib. Oh, my compliments to the chef!!

and finally...

Chocolate Terrarium: This is the grand finale of the whole Rose.Rabbit.Lie. dining experience!

The LATE show is supposedly MORE PROVOCATIVE  and the EARLY show isn't provocative but definitely has those SEXUAL INNUENDOS. I would like to see the late show just to see the difference.

At the show I was very impressed. Super interactive and very engaging with the audience. The show is also very intimate. The audience gets a very close look at the show so you can never really get a bad seat. Just think, they're passing audiences popcorn, giving you shower curtains during splash zone, or pieces of chocolate. I mean..it was LEGIT. The acts aren't boring at all. The hook of the show is pretty cool and definitely works for the place. 

My favorite acts:

BONE BALANCING GODDESS
DANCE DUET
CONTORTIONIST

Other acts I saw that was ""ok"":

MAGIC TRICK (even though I got picked to go up.) You can't TRICK me into liking the magic trick just because a cute dog is in it! (like my pun?) I think being picked to help with the trick killed it for me ONLY because I was snooping around trying to figure out the trick.

MAN IN TUB: Aerial straps. Ok it is pretty cool and sexy, but after you see the Atherton Twins from Zarkana do the aerial straps, it's kind of like no matter how wet he is, he still doesn't fly as high...

WALKING THE BORDER: same as above.

We went to the show and stayed later to watch more mini acts at the bar, in which we ended up staying for a good 4 hours. We ordered that TERRARIUM thing. It's very pretty AND cool, but at some point eating flowers isn't that great anymore. :( But I did love eating the dirt which is a mixture of choco mousse, brownies, cake, and what tastes like Ferrero Rocher. I'd buy this for someone if it's a special occassion (because they put a candle in it), but not worth the $35. Invest in on the caviar tacos.

The cappuccino is also probably the best cap I've ever tasted. Extra dry and foamy. Bold and full. Perfect night cap (that's a pun too).

==here is a good tip==

People get confused if you HAVE to watch the show to experience the experiment. NO YOU DON'T. You can eat there, or have drinks, or just watch the show. You don't HAVE to do all three. To watch the show you do have to walk into the bar and wait around until show time (so you can choose to go early or stay later after the show see more).

They do small mini shows throughout the place like every 15 minutes. So it's like watching a smaller version of the actual paid show. So, if you only plan on drinking or eating and not watching the show, just go up to the hostess and tell her. Left side is for dining and right side is for the bar/show.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,17,8,5,d0wYb6kZpXIwjBXsITSifQ

It sounded like it would be fun with the entertainment, and the menu looked pretty good. I didn't have any other expectations than that. 
I was blown away by how wonderful everything was from start to finish. 
Our server Elizabeth was fantastic. She suggested a tasting menu for the nine of us. So she basically got our ideas on what we would like and not like, and she ordered a selection from the menu. Her picks were fantastic. 
Among the things we had: the brioche rolls (heavenly), the steak tartare was amazing, the duck confit pasta (so f'ing good), we even had the Beef Wellington which was so amazing I think got shivers. They finished us off with a selection of cookies, which was perfect because we were so full. 
They have a female sommelier (Kat) that opens the champagne bottles with a saber!! She worked with our party on which bottles we should get and she knew the menu backwards and forwards. I was so impressed with her!
There were singers that would walk around the restaurant and then join the live band. There were dancers that would appear and dance around your table. You never knew what was going to come around and entertain you.

I booked this dinner last minute on a Friday and thankfully, they were available.

Absolutely love the ambiance and the charm, with live music to boot. I asked the server to move our table closer to the stage and he didn't hesitate to seat us right in front. Awesome.

The food, which I didn't expect much of, was surprisingly delicious. It's small French inspired plates that are shared at the table. Even the three other Parisians I was with approved!

Wine list is extensive, cocktails are tasty. The price isn't so bad for the quality you get. But we ordered two bottles of champagne and wine, which ended up being close to paying for a table at a club.

There is plenty of downtime to chat between the free dinner shows. The actual show itself, which we had tickets for after the dinner, is even better. A lot of interaction with the audience and plenty of sex jokes. The very first act consisted of a magic trick with full strip show! I particularly enjoyed the singer/beatboxer.

3756508,2015-08-17,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"This restaurant was recommended by a cocktail waitress at the Mandarin Oriental Sky Bar. She gushed about the place and the caviar tacos (which are $15 each) in particular. Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is located in the swanky new Cosmopolitan hotel. When you walk in you are immediately transported into a modern speak-easy setting. Our reservations were for 9:15pm and they were backed up so we had to wait about 40 minutes in the bar for a table. It's $18 for a cocktail at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. but at least they make them strong. The drinks expert felt bad we were waiting so long and gave us all a small glass of sparkling pink Italian wine.

Once a table was finally ready, we were seated in a section away from the live entertainment. I can't decide if this was a good thing because the interior of the restaurant was so unbelievable loud or if it was a bad thing because when we wanted to see the entertainment we had to leave the table. The entertainment was outstanding, there was a female singer, young breakdancing boy and a male tap dancer who performed on top of the piano as well as a live band. I would have preferred to sit with a view of the entertainment, especially once I learned that we were responsible for a Live Entertainment tax on the bill.

The waiter recommended three small plates per person but we opted for 3 entrees and 4 small plates to share between four people. This was enough food for four, and we probably would have been satisfied with one less dish. The food was high-quality and very rich so it was filling despite small portion sizes. The menu is upscale with ingredients like foie gras and duck confit. There is even an option for $1200 Alaskan King Crab to share between 4-5 people! My favorite dishes was the grilled octopus and duck confit pasta. It was the first time I'd ever tried octopus and I was pleasantly surprised by the texture. The herbed brioche rolls were also delicious but I think that the restaurant should provide them for free to every table. Paying for bread just seems wrong, especially when you have to pay for entertainment and even the house water is $2/bottle.

I would recommend this restaurant for the entertainment and the food, but be prepared for your digestive system and bank account to take a hit from all the rich food and hefty prices.",kihGyl_MeOYV8VasNGjN4A,3,0,3,JjN2linp3QQPH7uPVHgkzw

The show was the highlight of my most recent trip to Vegas. There was an open champagne bar until midnight which was fun. We had front row seats to the very fun show. It is so hard to describe this show because there was so much happening! There was a round stage that rotated with different variety acts. I don't want to ruin the surprise for you, but it was nonstop craziness! There were singers, dancers, contortionists, and dj. You couldn't get bored because there was constantly something new to see!

It's only the 4th day this place is open at the Cosmo, and we came to check it out. Didn't know what to expect. Open bar for girls 12-1am, well vodka drinks only, but free drinks is always awesome! 

The lounge has 2 sides connected by a rotating circular stage. Thu-Sunday, there's a variety show with different acts performing on stage. The seating is a semi-circle around the stage in these large cushy soft chairs that are super comfortable. The acts I heard is different every night, the night we came, we saw tap dancing, acrobatics, peepshow, comedians, some singing, beatboxing and some ballet dancing. Really very interesting and great performances with lots of talents. After the acts, a really cool DJ played for the rest of the night and we got to shake ""what our mama gave us"" for a few hours after the show on the small dance floor. 

I love how small and intimate this place is, and the layout/decor is done very well. The staff there is super nice, unlike alot of the staff at the other lounges on the strip. I asked one of the boucers where the bathroom was, and he took me over there and showed me so I wouldn't get lost and smiles the whole way around.

3782965,2014-01-20,9,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Rose Rabbit Lie is like no venue you've been to in Vegas. 

Yes... it is another venue on the strip that offers the typical ""bottle service"" but you can't come with preconceived notions based off of what you have experienced in Vegas. Rose Rabbit Lie is a club, a live theater, a restaurant, and a speakeasy ...AT THE SAME DAMN TIME.

Secret rooms... mysterious doors... roaming performers...great eats...and the best cocktails in town. 

RRL might sound like too much going on when you hear about it but everything will make sense once you experience it for yourself. The venue has ticketed shows playing at 8pm, 10pm and 12pm. After these shows are over walls will open up and the room turns into a dance club with a DJ. This is probably when you start drinking and taking down shots. 

I can't remember the last time that I was out past midnight just because I wanted to be. I arrived in time to make most of the last show and try some of their food menu. The show was entertaining but very strange, definitely memorable. I would go into details but I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. As for the food, I tried the rabbit fricassee, steak frites, and bone marrow. They were all pretty good but pricey for tapas, but that should be expected when dining in the Cosmo. 

I chose to not start drinking until after the show because I wanted to see the venue sober...( my tolerance is ridiculously bad). We luckily got a tour of the place and was able to see every room.
TIP: If you see a door and it doesn't look like a kitchen or staff service well, go through it. It probably leads to another room. 

My favorite room by far has to the speakeasy/study in the back which is small and intimate but lively. They have a couple shelves of old school classic records that you can pick through and play on their record player which is fun. My friends had a great time going through them, reminiscing the good old days when they were ...well my age.
There is an exit door into the casino from this room which makes leaving the maze stress-free. 

WARNING: Their drinks hit hard. 
Expect their signature cocktails to blow your mind. These drinks were delicious! Probably some of the best cocktails I've ever had. 
They serve their signature cocktails in martini glasses but most of their drinks are served in heavy spinning cups with a single large block of ice. Pretty neat and very fun especially when you're intoxicated...that or I'm just easily amused. 

I recommend everyone to come experience Rose.Rabbit.Lie. They definitely changed the game and brought something new and refreshing to the Vegas strip.

*Ambiance: Mystical and charming with blue toned lights, bright paintings and art surrounding the walls, plush booths, and fantastic piano and live singing. When you walked in, almost felt like you were going through the rabbit hole as the reception area is so quiet.

*Drinks: Moscow Mule, R.R.L. Old Fashioned and a Widows Kiss.
All the drinks were good and not too strong, but too much ice for your buck so it seemed like we would finish in a couple sips. Best drink was the Widow's Kiss - sweet yet has a bite with the Brandy.
 
*Dessert: Chocolate Terrarium 
Beautiful representation like the forbidden rose in Beauty and the Beast!! Everything in the terrarium was edible and was tasty! However, I thought there was a big imbalance of the components. There is so much soil and is rather dry but not enough of the hazelnut ice cream or chocolate pudding to pair it with. There was also some marshmallow component that was delicious but again so little of it. We ended up finishing with about half the dessert left over and for $35, we felt it was wasteful.

*Service: When our waiter found out we were just ordering drinks and dessert, he got very passive aggressive. Almost immediately after we ordered he was pretty snarky and then within 30 seconds we had servers crowding around our table taking away our silverware and plates.

Only reason I gave a 4 star rating was because the dining part of the show is extremely expensive.  I didn't realize 2-3 tapas a person plus a cocktail could accumulate to a $500.00 bill for 4 people.

The best part of the show was the tap dancing twin brothers who made it a night to remember.  From my understanding every night the show is different.

If you truly appreciate the early 1920's and a different experience from most traditional shows, this is the place to be!",u90s9wJ9pMK2FMpy5F8Wpg,2,1,4,rH1bgVGJss6OUhn7mzmA8g

The Crispy Chicken was the most memorable dish of the night-- though the authenticity of the shaved ""black truffle"" was highly dubious. Other dishes like oysters and steak tartare were solid but is probably better at many other places. This place offers quite a bit of caviar but this isn't the place to order caviar.

We were first seated in the middle of the back room but clearly there wasn't enough room for a table there. The wait staff had to ask us to slide or move our chairs so they could get by. At one point they had to push a flambe cart by and one of us had to get out of our chair to make way. There were plenty of empty tables, so we asked to be moved to a different table against the wall. Our waitress was not happy about that and wasn't afraid of showing it. She continued to be rude to us the whole night, taking our orders in a highly condescending manner and acted totally offended when we needed a change of plates and flatware. 

The poor quality of service was totally incongruous with a place that has the nerve to charge $275 for a beef wellington, $95 for a roast chicken, and $1200 for king crab.",4YgPGKtt06JuIYTQlTr58Q,9,4,2,SnRD2MQM_ymNiS6UUsZeJQ

Once we did get service, the dessert and cocktails we chose were delicious. The entertainment was several lively and very loud singers, which made it hard to have a conversation.

So good, in fact, that we ended our night there both nights we were in Vegas. Sure, some of the performances were repeated. but we didn't care.

I love the crazy wigged DJ they always have. The drink tickets this time were for a delicious vodka fruity drink they called The Devil Inside. It was awesome. And two drink tickets for each girl was great.

The first night we came in, we didn't have a promoter so we lied about our names on guest list because the front staff practically showed us the list. We got in no problem.

The second night we came much later, probably about 1 am. A promoter stopped us on the first story of the hotel and asked us if we were on the guest list, we weren't, so he led us up there and we got in under his name. Score.

The only bad thing about Rose Rabbit Lie for me is that the music is like old school mixed with EDM. I don't like old music very much. It's not as easy for me to dance to. So I was dancing a lot less here.

3959371,2017-10-14,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I'll start with the good: This restaurant has such an amazing vibe to it and upbeat atmosphere. You are almost transported into a different world as the hostess takes you through one of the two doors into the restaurant.
The live entertainment was absolutely phenomenal. One minute you had a beautiful woman singing, the next a tap dancer gets up on stage and starts performing. Such a cool idea for a restaurant!
The food and drinks were very well prepared & had a nice variety to them. Plus for vegetarians: they have a separate menu for non-meat eaters! 

Now I'll go into the bad: Our service was horrendous. It took 15 minutes just for the server to come over and greet us and give us the cocktail menu. After the cocktail menu arrived, we looked it over and decided what we wanted to order for both drinks and food. Our server came over and took our order. We thought from that point service would get better but it didn't. Our reservation was at 9pm and we didn't get our cocktails until 9:45pm because of the fact that it took forever for the server to greet us and to even take our order. 
The girls I was dining with and I have all been servers so we know what it's like to get caught up in the hustle and bustle but when you see your server go to all of his other tables except ours, it makes you wonder why he was ignoring us.

The restaurant overall was absolutely amazing & I will highly recommend it to anyone & even go back! The only thing that could improve is service.

3966775,2014-01-11,10,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Wow!  Now that I've been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I understand how the whole thing fits together and works.  I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.

I got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.

There are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  

Most of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tête de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!

I chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut ""stone"".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the ""stone"" was very tasty!

Service was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.

From here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  

The show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.

The show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.

This was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,34,21,5,L8ukDqfUKIXGkn3KZwFuYA

3996664,2015-06-20,3,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I've come here twice now, and think there are far better restaurants in Vegas than this one. I think the concept is interesting with a ""show"", but the end result is a super loud experience where it's so loud that you can't hear yourself think or have a conversation at the table. If I want loud music where I have to yell over to talk to people, I'll go to a club, but would prefer not to have the same experience when dining.

The first time I went here (last year), I was seated in the back, behind the stage so we couldn't really see anything of the show going on. The second time I went here, there were 2-3 singers / dancers, which were good performers, but I think I prefer decoupling the show + dining experience. 

The food itself was fine, but totally overpriced - the dishes are small and while they are inventive, if you share dishes, you may be eating one or two bites of something and wondering where the rest of the dish is. I remember the food being better and of more value last year when I went, but think that I can get better food (and more) at other places in Vegas, for less money. The plates are pretty small, so most dishes are best shared between 2-3 people. If you have a larger party of 3+, consider getting 2 or more of the same dish (depending on your party size) so that you can eat more than just one piece of pasta or one bite of something.

White Asparagus ($18) - Asparagus - singular - as in one asparagus stalk. Yes, the hazelnut pesto is delicious, as is the parmesan emulsion (think a puffy cloud of airy parmesan). The one or two bites will be delicious but you will be wondering why you paid $18 for one piece of asparagus. I would not recommend getting this.

Warm Brioche Rolls ($5) - If you want to try to leave full from dinner and plan to drink post-dinner (and have food in your stomach), get this. There are 3 rolls per order, so value-wise, pretty good, relative to the other dishes. They are warm, fluffy and fresh.

Fingerling Potato Poutine ($12) - 6 small pieces of fingerling potatoes with a sauce. But nothing special. Again, a few bites and you'll be wondering where the rest of your dish is, and why you paid $12 for some potatoes.

Duck Confit Pasta ($14) - Pasta is filling, so this is a good dish to get - the pasta was fresh, with a white cream sauce and the duck was tasty. I'd recommend this.

Herb Roasted Ribeye ($58) - This was good, if you like to pay ~$60 for 5 pieces of steak. Each bite will cost you about $5. Stick to a steakhouse if you want meat.

Penne Pasta ($24) - This was my favorite dish of the night, with a tomato sauce, fresh, al dente noodles, and perfectly cooked pork. I would definitely get this again (and maybe only this), and would recommend it.

All in all, an expensive meal that will set you back around ~$60-80 per person and you may even leave hungry. If you do come here, pick the pasta dishes since I think they are better executed and more filling than the other dishes. There were some interesting dishes and flavors, but all in all, not a great value for your money and a very loud experience where you'll be yelling to have a conversation. Pick either a show or dinner, but don't combine the two.",cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,9,3,2,aBET2l9u9tMVtU7tV4DLTA

The atmosphere was unlike any other restaurant I've been to. The lighting and decor was like a modern spin on a 20s club. They have a band and performers which was the highlight of the dinner. They perform hits from different decades with a little spin on them.  They also had a few different dancers. All of them walk around and interact with the visitors. There are no bad seats in this place! 

One tip- don't be fooled by the menu. At first glance prices look in line with other places around town which I thought was a little odd given the $$$$ most sites give it. These are all small plates and it is intended that you order multiple courses. So plan accordingly!

I went with my husband and parents. I was a little nervous that we may not all enjoy it but I was wrong. We were all in awe of the whole experience, including the food! I'm pretty sure we all had empty plates at the end of each course.

One final piece of advice, we thought we would have enough time for our 8 pm reservation and our 10 pm show at Caesars. We were wrong. It was an extra 20ish minutes for us to be seated and with all the courses and our attention being drawn to the performers, we were late getting to our show.

The show nocturne did not do the cuisine justice and was a collection of street acts with exception of the exceptional female rapper and twin tappers.  The rest you could see on the street or some off-strip late night cheap show.

Don't pay for premium tix, the entire room is small enough that you see the same thing from the back as you do from front row.  I'd go for $25 for the rapper and tappers but skip the rest.",ZmtW5Rb6yPZmEcVkdzq39A,3,2,3,pHG6rKGlj8XTwAn-B0cqfw
4026806,2016-05-20,4,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Our experience at Rose Rabbit Lie was disappointing. I am a Las Vegas local and I have reservations about recommending this place to other locals.

I came here for my best friend's birthday on 5/14/16 at 8p with a group consisting of 6. I made reservations well in advance, checked in when I arrived 15 minutes early, and then approached the stand to be seated promptly at 8p with my entire group there. Somehow my OpenTable reservation was not confirmed as I did not receive points for dining here. This is just an (albeit minor) annoyance I found out after the fact.

We were seated at a booth right in front of the bar. I was confused because pictures I saw online were of a dining room with a stage. I acknowledged this was my fault as I did not do my due diligence prior to booking. But why would they seat a big group that's celebrating a birthday at a small table in the bar? I made reservations a few weeks beforehand and let them know it was a birthday. I didn't ask for us to be moved because the band and singer in the bar area were lively and entertaining. We all seemed okay to stay and I didn't want to further aggravate our waitress who acted annoyed with our presence as soon as we arrived. **They have multiple rooms, check on this when you reserve.**

SERVICE
We begin to look at the menu (they have a separate allergen menu which was unexpected and a huge plus!) and our waitress comes over to check on us. I ask her if she can split the bill 3 ways. She was extremely rude from that point on. I wish I caught her name because I'm sure they have higher standards of service than what she provided.

FOOD
The food was very good. But we all agreed that it was a very expensive snack (we ended up at Secret Pizza after). Expect to spend a lot of money-- it's small plate style so you won't get a lot of bang for your buck. But it's delicious and a very unique experience. It's kind of silly though because the dishes are mini works of art that you can't see because of the lighting. You're being charged for fancy plates you can't fully enjoy. What's more is that it's hard to eat because they pack you into a table and there's not enough room for everyone's plates. It seems like the menu doesn't fit the establishment. While I agree that it should be on the pricier side, it shouldn't be as expensive and it would make much more sense to offer large entrees instead of small plates that you need to order several of.

ENTERTAINMENT
We loved the singer, band, tap dancer, and drunk couple on the dance floor (may vary with crowd) that entertained us while we dined. Truly, it was a cool experience and the entertainers were talented and interacted with the crowd. Get seated in another room if you want more than music; the bar area was just a singing and dancing type place. If you have a big group, it's hard to have conversation because it's very loud.

TL;DR
Bad service; yummy expensive food that's hard to enjoy in that environment; great entertainment. Not good for large groups but would be much better for a party of two. Disappointed that I chose this place to celebrate my bestie's birthday.",MyUAcr735ghKrBgaIBdI4w,13,1,2,j68cD9UXC7q9Bw0ejQOVdQ

Do as little or as much as you like in one venue. Bring your all friends too including Negative Nancy you've been neglecting because she will love it too! RRL, as others have stated, is a social experiment composed of a restaurant, bar, show, and club but more interactive.  Filling in the ""Right Amount of Wrong"" gap Cosmopolitan has been missing.  Something new for errrr'body.

We started off by picking up our 10pm show tickets at the counter just up the escalator, and then check in for dinner around the corner at the host stand.  Our dinner resv was somehow lost, but luckily they had table available for us. The hostess were so sweet checking back on us at the bar to see if the rest of our party has arrived.  The bar was lively and the mixoligist made some great suggestions. Their beverage program is actually quite impressive.  We we're able to have our fave drink, Whiskey Smash (Templeton Whiskey, Mints, Sour, Simple Syrup), throughout the evening even though each bar has their own drink menu from what I've been told. 

Dinner was pretty crazy with all the workers moving so fast and side acts.  You could def feel the energy.  There were so much going on at one point i thought i was changing wardrobe with all the hands touching our tables, but it was just the server assistants and runners clearing up plates and dropping off dishes. I almost forgot we ordered those! Braised Pork with Polenta and Black Truffle, Pan Roasted Sweetbreads (Pancreas) with Root Beer Ajus, Brussels Sprouts wrapped with Chicken Skin, and Bone Marrow wish Short Ribs just to name a few.  Tapas style done well.  Rene, our server, gave us exceptional service and made sure we were on time for our 10pm show.  

After dinner we made our way to through a couple doors and into theater where we had the pleasure to be taken care by Heather and Jen (Jaeger?) during the show. They made sure to pampered us at our pace without being oppressive.  And I really wish i remember the server assistant's name because he was on point too!  

The show itself was entertaining.  I grew dimples that night from smiling so much, but unfortunately i can't say anymore about the acts because that wouldn't be fair.  So on that note, Butterscotch!!  We stayed through the midnight canto and party a little afterward because it was THAT good of a time.  Money well spent.

One thing i really want to reiterate was the impeccable service we received.  It should be noted that EVERY staff we encountered were attentive and cordial.  I almost didn't want to return to the real world because that would mean losing that VIP status.  With that said i can't wait to returned as honored guest and have RRL show my buddies a hell of a time!",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,16,14,5,JXooPpyOYNUbkpoITeZxhQ

It is not the place for a quiet evening and those that complain about the noise level should have done their research. It's also not the place for a first date where you want to get to know each other but, it would be for those that find conversation challenging;-) The entertainment is secondary (a few were not extremely talented) but, that just added to the charm. The food and drinks were amazing - some standard menu items are transformed into something incredible. Every dish had a twist that made it unique as well as the drinks. Even the recommended wines were spot on. Darius our waiter was awesome and we got to meet the wonderful manager Jason Carr. The Onion Soup Popovers were outrageously divine and one of the many unique items on their menu as was the Coconut Creamed Corn. In some cases, you'd think the ingredients wouldn't go together but after that initial taste, it was all off the charts. I was bummed that they only do Bananas Foster for large groups and the Chocolate Terrarium looked great but too much for the two of us so, we opted for the Peach Parfait, thinking it wouldn't be too decadent after such a rich meal, we were wrong. The Roasted Summer Peach, Peach Puree, Coconut Tapioca, Brown Butter Ice Cream, Oat Crumble - OMG! The flavors just demand to be enjoyed and who would ever think to put them all together and have them taste so insanely good!!

The entertainment was excellent but very loud. Half the time my wife could not hear me speak. It has a more club atmosphere with singers/dances moving all around. The seating was also very close together. Often the waiters had to ask me to move in so they could walk by with trays or charts.

Food was amazing.  Show was unique and amazing.  Service was impeccable.  

And the Ambiance.  There is nothing like it in the world as far as I'm concerned.  A full sensory experience that is worth every penny.  Do the whole dinner and show.  It's worth it!  

7:30pm-- Entered the hostess room which was very dramatic (I'm not going to ruin it).  Was seated in the ""Parlor"" of the restaurant which is set up like rooms of a mansion.  Enjoyed bits of show that spilled out into our dining area as the walls moved up and down.  Ate some of 40+ Small plates from a wax sealed menu.  All of the items were to die for.  I was not disappointed by any of them.  This included:
-Warm herb brioche rolls
-Roasted Brussels sprouts
-Slow braised pork
-Fois gras with duck fat fries
-Braised short rin stroganoff
-Titos Moscow Mule (on tap)
-Birthday Bear Cookie Jar (see pictures)

9:30pm--Saw the most amazing show in the ""great room"".  It was a revue style performance.  It's so hard to explain.  Dancers, comedy, burlesque, and more!  The pictures don't do any of it justice.

12:0pm--Stuck around and caught the 12:00pm show for free standing in the back.  Not as good at the 9:30 show, but also very cool.  I love that each show time is different.

4126430,2016-04-27,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"LOVED my experience here last month. Best choice for a birthday.

I feel I've seen it all but this was a different experience from the get-go, as soon as we arrived and felt compelled to started snapping photos of this life-size diorama right outside the venue. Felt like something out of Alice in Wonderland: the styling, the lighting, the intrigue.

Started with drinks just past the hostess stand in The Study, where they featured exclusive cocktails even to what was offered inside. My ""Rumble in the Jungle"" was so smooth. I can't even begin to describe the taste. Curious, in a good way. Familiar, but interesting.

Once we were seated for dinner, Madeline was our server and the absolute sweetest. She walked us through the menu and what we ended up going with was the just the right amount of food. For the two of us, we were stuffed but not uncomfortably so: caviar tacos, shrimp cocktail, poutine, duck confit pasta, rib-eye. I came for the overall experience but the food really surpassed my expectations as I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.

Now, the entertainment. Again, I can't begin to describe the experience. The lounge singers were FAB...not the cheesy types you'd imagine but 2 women performing covers of modern hits with such confidence and flourish and their own twist, all while working the room...I was entranced. At one point there was a kid tap dancer who performed with a live band (on top of a piano no less,) and stole the show. Then a man joined him on the stage...I had to blink several times but my eyes didn't deceive me, it was Aaron Turner himself, from So You Think You Can Dance. I love the show so had a fan girl moment...Madeline heard from my friend that I was a fan, and ended up surprising me with a meet-and-greet/photo opp once he left the stage. It was a simple gesture but meant a lot especially on my actual birthday. He was so nice and gracious.

It was only my trip to Vegas this past weekend that reminded me that I've been meaning to complete this review for over a month. I was hoping to pop in again for those amazing cocktails, and to see the performances this time up close and personal. Alas, they're only open Wed-Sat. Bummer!

There was supposed to be a ""secret"" entry to the study for Breakfast at Piffany's that you had to ask about, but apparently now, it is something you have to call ahead and make reservations for. Would have been good to know in advance...when we asked waiters about it, they told us we could go, and sat us at a table while they ""sat up"" the room. So we sat around for an hour being told that we could go, which pissed off the waiter whose section we were put in, and then were told that now the room is reservations only and we, in fact, couldn't go. Nobody really seemed to know what was going on, until finally the manager came over to tell us that we couldn't go and we had to leave. Well. Bye.

It's a nice variety show, but that's pretty much it. It's not a ""social experiment"" the way it was originally touted. Also, about 20% of the seating is TERRIBLE, which is where we wound up.

The box office assured us that there ""were no bad seats"" - but I can definitely assure you that there are. The acts that I could appreciate were good.

Completely disappointed after reading all of the reviews. Was expecting something unique, exciting and fun, but instead I paid $100, sat in a terrible seat, and then was put at a table for an hour expecting a midnight show, which I never got to see.

After seeing the menu online, I knew immediately that I'd be ordering the Short Rib Stroganoff.

I realize they serve small plates, but even Barbie could've eaten this dish and still been hungry afterward. $24 and still hungry after I ate? Not okay. The overall dish itself was ""meh"".

However, the actual experience was definitely mixed.  First off, I made a reservation through open table about a month in advance (because my sister was visiting), but when they seated us, they put us in the library/study.  When my boyfriend asked where all the performers were, we were told we would need to wait 40 minutes to move to the main restaurant/lounge.  Can I get a WTF?  How was I supposed to know to specifically request this?  The bus boy was really nice and we only had to wait about 20 minutes, but rather lax/lame hosting if you ask me. 

Pros: Our cocktails in the library/study were good and tasty.  My favorite was the Suisse Abyss - chocolate-y but not too sweet.  Also, once we finally were seated in the lounge, it was really fun.  Upbeat, energetic performers.  A woman with a giant flower on her head (I love a good accessory) who had 2 costume changes belted out some fab tunes, and a male singer would walk around and serenade the diners.  There was also some tap dancing... on a piano.  

Cons: Our waiter was Vegas cheesy (5 o'clock shadow and actor-wannabe demeanor) - and kept pushing items on the menu that didn't sound that great but were pricey.  The food was a giant ""meh.""  The $15 caviar tacos were ok, but nothing special, and both pastas we ordered (a penne caviar special and duck confit) were decent but not memorable.  We also ordered the foie gras (customary preparation, again nothing special), and the fried chicken - average. 

I will concede that we were kinda indecisive and ordered on the heavier side, but the food theme seemed to be maximum flash, minimum substance.  Also, the desserts looked so unsatisfying for the pricing that we decided to forego all together.  For example, our waiter pushed the chocolate terrarium - but another table ordered it and it looked like slabs of bark that were really made out of chocolate.  Umm, no thanks.

All I know for sure is that I was suspended in a wonderfully floaty state of confusion the entire evening, as I was led through a maze of sumptuously decorated rooms full of weird performers doing weird shit, plying me with fabulously sumptuous drinks and dishes. I felt like Alice in Tsarist-era Wonderland, as if at any moment Josephine Baker would pop out of a Victrola and offer me a magic banana with a tag reading ""EAT ME."" Magnifique!
Second caveat: I could never afford going here myself, but a visiting liberal-elitist New York journalist pal invited me to accompany him on a sort of VIP PR tour. We were heavily schmoozed by PR people...but PR snowjob or not, this place is super fucking cool! 
It's the same vibe as Absinthe - creepy vintage cabaret, with Hieronymous Bosch murals and old telephones and freaky performers being artsy in every corner as you sip craft cocktails and eat ""updated"" versions of classic, old-school Vegas fare like rack of lamb and beef Wellington. Three times a night, they put on an actual show with acrobats and shit, but you have to buy special tickets for that in addition to dinner and drinks. And then after the last show -- excuse me, ""canto""-- the showroom turns into a nightclub...and you can par-taaaay late into the night, if that's your bag.
Since my friend was being schmoozed, it was seen to that our experience was exceptionally fabulous, and to that end we were hosted by a smart young hipster-type in a velveteen jacket and Morrissey glasses, with the most astonishingly earnest stream of P.R.B.S. flowing effortlessly from his mouth all night long. I don't mean to make him sound insincere -- he was amazing in that he was totally earnest about every adjective he used. Words like ""mixologist,"" ""craft bitters"" and ""ice chef"" rolled effortlessly and completely irony-free off his gilded tongue, and with every word he spoke I found myself more and more spellbound by his surreal gravitas. Plus, he had the most amazing vocabulary of anyone I've ever met!
Now, it's true that Rose.Rabbit.Lie. is pretentious to a fault -- but somehow, that's part of its charm. As mentioned, it's not for the feint of wallet-- those fabulous craft cocktails will set you back $16 or more apiece...but astonishingly, it's worth it! They were some of the best drinks I've ever tasted -- and I've tasted 'em all! I supposed it helps that they're heavy into bitters, and use my all-time favorite spirit Campari liberally (I had a cocktail containing Campari jelly...!!!)...but drinks aside, the ambiance and atmosphere alone are totally worth ponying up the cash for (you're subsidizing a huge and very attentive staff). The experience really is that fabulous -- the aforementioned ice chef is responsible for carving giant chunks of ice into various shapes, like diamonds (!!!), that sparkle in your cocktail like a Liz Taylor-Richard Burton quaalude-fueled sex-a-thon.
After drinks in the fabulously-appointed ""study,"" we went onto dinner in the dining room. Our gracious host ordered a huge feast of just about one of everything, and it was truly exceptional in the details --- the menus are sealed and stamped with wax, plus there are all manner of weird 1%er tableware accouterments like animal-shaped silverware-rests, filigreed forks and swan-shaped pewter sea-salt dishes with tiny spoons. 
After stuffing ourselves with foie gras, caviar, lobster and champagne, we retired to the showroom to watch the last of the three nightly ""cantos"" of Vegas Nocturne -- basically, an Absinthe-style sort of burlesque circus about an hour long, after which the showroom turned into a nightclub, and a Sexy Lady DJ came out and played club music while everyone danced. Maybe I'm just jaded, but I found the whole showroom component of the evening boring. The show itself was nothing you can't see elsewhere, and I just felt it wasn't cool/creative/freaky enough to live up to the rest of the place.
If/when I return to Rose.Rabbit.Lie., I plan to dress to the nines and spend the whole night boozing in the Study, with maybe a few small bites here and there to soak up all that Campari. Our host mentioned something about an old-fashioned record player in there, with free-for-all records, so I think it would be much more fun to just get genteelly sloshed while doing the Charleston to Al Jolson or some such, late into the wee hours. Pre-gaming with my medication was great, and psychedelics would also greatly enhance the experience...if one were so inclined. 
Overall, as pretentious and expensive as it is, I am compelled to wholeheartedly recommend Rose.Rabbit.Lie. as one of my favorite new places to party -- I've already made plans, in fact, to come back with some friends next month! See you there!!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,30,27,4,frfWF9zQP1ede_vC8J5qJg

4251161,2014-02-25,2,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"My review is WAY overdue. I was able to come for free thanks to an awesome comp by Edwin P. Thanks Edwin! I had been anxiously awaiting the opening and was intrigued by the concept, a social experiment. Hmmm.

My friend and I scored two tickets to the 10:00 pm canto. As other Yelpers have mentioned, there are three cantos or acts. One at 8, then 10 and another at midnight. They supposedly get more risqué as the night progresses. I had an idea of what to expect, I figured it'd be a mix between Absinthe and The Act (neither of which I've seen btw). Anyway, we we're let in a little early and hung out near the bar area taking it all in. The bar is decorated super nice, it had a vintage, Gatsby feel to it, with a modern edge. There was a quartet at the entrance playing a mix of smooth jazz and modern favorites. A girl that closely resembled Janelle Monae was signing, damn could she sing. From there they took the party into the next room and we were met by a woman swinging from the ceiling and a bunch of attractive men hanging around her. They performed for a while, while mingling with the guests until we're were all directed into the theater next door.

My friend and I both bought a drink, I cannot recall what they were called buy mine had bourbon and it was delish. I didn't think the hardware was all that, honestly. We took our seats and after about ten minutes were moved up to the front, SCORE! I will interject at this point to inform you that the seats we originally had cost $127, and the seats at the front cost $170ish. Holy crap that's pretty expensive. Nonetheless, the seats were amazing. The performers were literally right in front of us, within 2-5 feet of us. All of ten performances were mesmerizing and funny. All the performers interacted with the people throughout the performance. No one particular act was my favorite, they were all unique. There was the sex bunny chick that did awesome things with feathers and her body, the weird dragon guy who is apparently really famous with his poor Chihuahua (Piff the Mahon dragon, is he?). There was a hot, sexy beast of a man that played around in a bathtub splashing us with water (luckily they provided us with a shower curtain to put over us lol). 

Afterwards we headed to the bar to have another drink. The same performers from the show were hanging out and interacting with the public. This is why you pay so much for the tickets, because they keep on entertaining you throughout the night., the constant entertainment goes into the price of the ticket. Social experiment aptly describes Rose.Rabbit. Lie. It is a restaurant, bar, performance space, live show, cabaret and everything in between. Simply put its genius. I've heard stories from different people that have gone and it seems like everyone has a different experience. I am particularly envious of the experiences of Robin Leach and the like, who have had private dances and invitations to secret rooms. Alas, I will have to become a regular to find out more.

Welcome to a fantasy filled with flashing lights, live entertainment, upgraded classic cuisine and of course, mystique.

After asking my Las Vegas big hitters for recommendations, both Philip T. and Rod U. (HI) mentioned RRL as an exciting venue to try out. I vowed myself to not get caught up on the photos and reviews and allowed my anticipation to peak once we arrived at the front check-in table. 

As the hostess accompanied us to our table, we could not avoid the visual creativity inside. Our table was closer to the back but we were able to see just enough of the performers. The room was full of electricity, colorful lights, live singers and band members and entertainers in elaborate to skimpy costumes. 

For drinks, we ordered the Old Fashioned $16 and the Moscow Mule $14. Both were on par and satisfying.

For our meal, we shared:

- Smoked Beet Salad - Toasted Ricotta Salata, Hazelnut, Balsamic Gelée ($14)
- Brussel Sprouts - Sherry Gastrique, Manchego Cheese, Crispy Chicken Skins ($11)
- Empanadas - Braised Veal Adobo, Broken Chimichurri ($12)
- Slow Roasted Octopus - Confit Tomato, Spiced Almonds, Romesco ($18)

All four of these tapas style dishes were outstanding. I loved the risks the chef took by using these basic ingredients and adding a flare of creativity to make them stand out. We especially loved the octopus as it was tender and still maintained a pleasant chew. 

Who could eat dessert after this meal? Apparently, the ladies next to us thought we could eat more and offered to share their Chocolate Terrarium ($35). This was the most extravagant chocolate dessert you could put your hands and mouth on. Covered inside a glass terrarium, it's packed with wall to wall chocolate delights in a garden setting. Visually stunning and earns another accolade for ingeniousness. 

For those of you considering to visit RRL, I don't want to spoil it for you any further but if you do, open all your senses to be impressed. It's located inside the Cosmopolitan Casino and reservations are highly recommended by using OpenTable.

I wished this evening didn't end and I wanted to stay. In the end, I realized this wasn't just Las Vegas; it was an unforgettable experience.",bH3Uc0YNlnKubj8cT4nQ0w,41,42,4,QZoVKZBfSY2P2_BDj7rtBg

Hali was very helpful over email in booking a table for me & my group of 30 friends, and checked in a few days before to make sure we were good to go. I wasn't sure what to expect as I had heard it was a show, lounge, club...all rolled into one. 

We came for the late night show, and when we arrived were quickly escorted to our table, and there were several people helping to arrange bottle service. They were all extremely helpful throughout the night, and so friendly. We even had a bouncer guy who would escort the girls to the bathroom (and kept the weird creepers away)!! They gave us a huge area that was very close to the stage & there was plenty of room for all 30 of us to sit and enjoy the show. The show itself was the highlight! It was so off beat and entertaining, a little bit of acrobatics, dance, music, weird comedic stuff...everyone in my party loved it. I was very happy, because I wanted something a little different, not the typical Vegas club scene...and this was definitely it. 

After the show ended, it became a full blown club...not a lounge. I was told it was a more casual lounge, but the music was bumpin and it was hard to talk to people. We had a blast dancing for about an hour or two and then it just became really hot in there, too loud & too much (typical club scene in Vegas). The music is also majority electronic (or at least it was the night we were there), and we were hoping for more of a mix of hip hop, pop, electronic. 

Overall, we had such a great time here. The show is so much fun, the service was great, and it's a little different than the typical Vegas club scene. I would definitely recommend!!!",2Fz0y4vhlT4duztrKMfDyQ,1,1,4,-xx0CyZInk2R1-jz_LghUA

We arrived at 6:00 on a Wednesday and the restaurant was fairly empty. As the night went on the restaurant filled up. The restaurant was quiet as we began our meal and grew much louder when the band started at 7:00. I enjoyed the music that the band played and the singer had a beautiful voice. It did get too loud for conversation so come on the earlier side if you want to enjoy dinner conversation. 

Our sweet waiter was a wealth of information. He gave us the whole menu rundown noting signature dishes and portion sizes for each menu category. He engaged us in nice conversation, but not in an interruptive way. Our table was on the smaller side, but attention was paid to clearing plates frequently to make it work. Overall, service was top notch.

To begin the meal we started with Caviar Flatbread, Argentinian Empanadas, and Glazed Brussel Sprouts. The Caviar Flatbread was nicely presented with the egg and caviar hand spooned over the flatbread tableside. It was a nice size and had a lovely flavor without any one flavor overwhelming the dish. The Argentinian Empanadas were my favorite of the starters. The veal inside was flavorful and tender with a perfect pastry on the outside. I enjoyed the Ignore sauce served alongside, but it wasn't necessary as the empanadas had plenty of flavor on their own. The Brussel Sprouts were good with plenty of flavor from the sherry and  a touch of cheese for a pop of flavor.

The main course was a small plate of Short Rib Stroganoff and the Penne Pasta entrée. The Short Rib Stroganoff was my favorite. It was served with three small stacks of short rib with a lovely layer of semolina, bread crumbs, mushrooms, and delicious sauce. The flavors in this were great, my husband and I both loved this. The Penne Pasta was perfectly cooked with a delicious pork rage that included capers. I loved the pasta and the ragu, but didn't care for the sheep's milk ricotta on top. 

A sweet ending to the meal for sure. We ordered the Campfire S'mores and Cookie Jar. The s'mores were beautifully presented in a fun manner. I liked their interpretation of s'mores and the marshmallow had a lovely smoky flavor. The Cookie Jar was full of various cookies ranging from macarons to brownie bites to biscotti. I loved the presentation with a unique jar featuring cookies on the top and inside of the jar. There were enough cookies for two to three people to share. Some of the cookies were outstanding (almond biscotti, macarons, chocolate truffle, and oatmeal raisin), but others were so so (brownies and an unknown flavorless cookie). My understanding is that the exact cookie selection varies by night, but I enjoyed enough of the cookies that I would order this again.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,7,5,4,b6l3rjfrS4F4S0f6RuY26A

The duck confit was also very good. Overall it was great food with entertainment and a fun atmosphere. Exactly what you would want in Vegas!",_0Giumz6c4lSsTOaJpX_2g,0,0,4,nFNDqqlXESyzTipEWmJYfg

It is buried deep inside Cosmo, just past the buffet. The decor is cool and quite unique. There is a big bar inside too if you have some time to kill before your reservation.

On top of the dining experience you get entertainment. Throughout our dinner there were various performances. There were singers and dancers. All of which were very good and entertaining. They do not perform non stop so you get plenty of time to still eat and talk.

They had a special Memorial Day Picnic themed option that night. It was pricey but it was designed to feed multiple people. When it came out we were shocked. They actually ended up pulling the table next to us to our table so they could make room for everything. The meal came with short rib on the bone, turkey sausage, beer can chicken, corn, mac and cheese and biscuits. I may have missed something, but you get the idea. They really did a great job with the presentation too. They put it on a huge platter and made it special.

All of the food was great. We both loved the short rib. The flavor was on point. The sausage and chicken were good too, but not on the level of the short rib. It was so tender and flavorful. The mac and cheese and corn were both very good. The biscuits, however, were great. Due to the immense size of our meal I did not get to enjoy more of them that night, but wow were they good.

I am comfortable saying the meal could have fed 4 people without a problem. We took the leftovers back to LA the next day and got two meals out of them.

We will certainly be back to try more of their regular menu items in the future. This is a great place to enjoy a meal and be entertained. The meal will be pricey, but the experience makes it worth it.",3wB-JjsUjkvdNUDRnChsVg,6,5,5,RRCQOMK2rZF9AdW5IwEMMQ

First, the entertainment. A talented house band, amazing jazz, tap dancing, and so much interaction with the audience/diners. I've heard that the entertainment changes frequently so it's a guarantee that you will not see the same thing twice. 

Second, the food.  Similar to a tapas style meal. Absolutely amazingly scrumptious! We ordered 4 small plates but received 3 additional plates compliments of the chef.  Dessert options made it too difficult to pick just one, so we ordered two. Unique cocktails in addition to classic libations. And they are affordable!

Ed Sullivan must be turning over in his grave!  (With apologies to all the young whippersnapper Yelpers who never heard of him).  Because Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is Ed Sullivan on crack.  And that is a compliment.

Our last-minute comp tix for the show were the icing on the cake for our pre-planned Cheap Date Night at the Cosmopolitan.  With a BOGO for Wicked Spoon and $25 each in free slot play in hand (thanks Cosmo and United Airlines!), we jumped at the chance to combine all three, and we chose the 10 pm show.  That gave us plenty of time to stuff our faces and stretch out those elastic-waist pants before heading off to the coolly strange show venue.  But alas, we were not disposed to sample the culinary offerings or the overpriced cocktails on this night.

As others have mentioned, if you loved Absinthe, you will love this lower-altitude variety cousin (due to the lower ceilings) - silly, kinky, funny, sexy, bizarre - performed by some very talented performers.

It wasn't until we were leaving and noticed another line forming that we learned that they put on three shows a night.  How do they do that?  By varying the acts.  Flying pingpong balls, Piff the Magic Dragon and his cute and docile (medicated?) chihuahua, a cute and comical striptease, a Chinese couple balancing and tossing plastic thingumabobs are among the acts we saw.  But past performance may not be indicative of future results.  We didn't love all of them.  Just most of them.  And did I mention that the venue itself is worth the price of admission??

Also, I was a little confused when we walked into the venue.  Staff doesn't really give you the low-down when you walk in - but I guess it's all a part of the adventure.

4517057,2017-03-21,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"This place is very near the top of my list of favorite dining experiences. The ambiance is wonderful, the service impeccable, the entertainment delightful, and the food...omg, utterly amazing. Starting with the Brioche Rolls, they are not to be missed. Freshly made, and they come right out of the oven to the table. My husband and I kept looking at one another in amazement, repeating, ""wtf??? How can rolls be THIS delicious?!""  The Fingerling Potato Poutine with Short Rib ""Gravy"" was out of this world. I quote ""gravy"" because it's actually incredibly tender shreds of short ribs. It was definitely a 5-star dish. Sticking with the ""Social Menu"", we then shared the empanadas, and they were also delicious. Just a couple of small bites each, so it's easy to be put out by the value (or lack thereof). Next we ordered the Wagyu Steak Tartare, and really loved it. At $18, this is where we started to question the craziness of the prices, as it was a very small plate - just a couple of very small bites each. We decided to end with the Brussels Sprouts and the Scallops, and sadly, this is where the magic started to fall apart. I had read positive reviews about the Sprouts, but we disliked them so much, we sent them back. They had a charred taste that I just couldn't get past. And I do like Brussels Sprouts, just not in this preparation. Finally, the Scallops were nicely prepared and flavorful, but $24 for two small Scallops was where we drew the line. Yes, this place is very expensive, but we truly enjoyed the place and will definitely return, but will scrutinize other reviews about specific dishes.  

The structure is a little confusing, as people have talked about ""Show times and tickets"". The band plays on the hour for 40 minutes. We had a dinner reservation, and the dining room is next to the lounge where the band plays. Screens drop down between the dining room and lounge, so the entertainment is heard and enjoyed from both areas. We weren't aware of separate tickets for the show. In fact, we went to the lounge only (no dinner) a couple of years ago, sat at the bar and ordered drinks, and enjoyed the entertainment from there without having paid a cover charge or purchased tickets. Maybe things have changed, so I recommend calling in advance. 

Finally, the most important tip I can offer to those who want to experience the food without spending a fortune:  The Social Hour (Happy Hour in other establishments) in the Library Room.  The room itself is very cool, with one whole wall LP record albums. You can browse through and choose what you'd like to hear, and someone will happily put it on the turntable for you. We listened to Otis Redding then Aretha Franklin.  The Social Hour menu prices are only good for a single hour - 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, but during that hour you can sample many of the menu items at a significant discount. The Brioche rolls for $2, the Fingerling Potatoes were, I think, $5.  Cocktail specials were $8 each, and were interesting and unique. You don't get the entertainment in this bar, but the old albums and great atmosphere make up for that at least in some part.",215Kvszp3nklgygWsY8HjA,4,0,5,2mUROM83vqi8ndro8SY5cg

She took us back to our table which my friend had reserved a week before. We were the second table as you walked in the door in the bar area right in front of the band. It was loud and we got a draft every time the door was opened. Secondly, our waitress was by far the worst. She was fake and quite rude. She was definitely upset that we weren't ordering heavy from the bar and that we only order 6 items off the menu. I say this because she was very attentive and nice to the table next to us who were two men who were drinking heavily. She gave us the impression that she was trying to get rid of us the whole time. The food was mediocre at best. The hot items came out cold and the cold items were at room temperature. Needless to say I will not be going back and was not impressed.

Strongly preferred Absynthe (same producer) over this. We LOVED that show. Probably one of our favorites. Mixed in raunchy comedy with Vegas-style acrobatics.

I mostly didn't like the magic acts. You can always figure out how it was done, and I hate that.

As we watched the table next to us receive plate after plate and drink after drink.  It took another 20 minutes at least to get another dish. The bus boy was nice enough to check on us, as it seems the waiter had forgotten about us. We finally got our steak which was warm and had been plated a while before it was given to us. I made a comment to the assistant manager before leaving and was offered a drink. I laughed and said I'm obviously pregnant to which he responded well come back when you can drink and I'll get you one?? Horrible service,  poor management and mediocre food.

4592919,2014-05-15,8,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I don't even know where to begin.  Rose.Rabbit.Lie is so completely unique and 100% fun.  It's operates on a whole 'nother level when compared to the predictable bar and nightclub scene that's de rigeur elsewhere on the Strip.

So, what is Rose.Rabbit.Lie, exactly?  It's a fusion of restaurant, speakeasy cocktail lounge, interactive funhouse, theater, and dance club.  Tucked away at the very back of the second level of the Cosmo, the venue is quite unassuming on the outside -- which belies the massive and gorgeously appointed interior.

When entering, you find yourself in a small circular anteroom that's the ""hub"" of Rose.Rabbit.Lie, and all the various rooms are found off of it.  Depending on whether you have restaurant reservations, show tickets, or are simply in the mood to sip a cocktail, you'll be led to a different area of the venue.  

The concept seems simple, but the distinctions between the various rooms are more fluid.  As the night progresses, walls tend to disappear.....and the venue morphs....

First the restaurant merges into the bar....
Then the bar merges with the theater.....
Then the theater transforms into a nightclub.

On the first night I visited Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I arrived with a ticket for the midnight show.  It was only 11pm, so I wandered into the lounge and enjoyed a delicious Paloma cocktail.  The crowd was very friendly, and more adult than elsewhere in the Cosmo.  Shortly before midnight, I wandered into the theater room, where I enjoyed a performance of Vegas Nocturne, a series of variety/cabaret acts starring Butterscotch, Piff the Magic Dragon + Mr. Piffles, a knockout of a drag queen, tap-dancing twins, a fire-eater, a sword-swallower, and more.  When the show was over, the stage recessed into the ground, revealing a huge dancefloor on which the audience was invited to dance the night away, with the help of Butterscotch's awesome beats.

I loved it all so much, that I came back the following night.

That's when I was *really* blown away.

I wasn't expecting anything in particular, since I didn't have show tickets this time 'round.  Instead, the show came to me!  The various acts from Vegas Nocturne were mingling with the bar patrons and breaking out into spontaneous performances around the bar -- and, occasionally, on top of it!  It was all so eye-poppingly cool!

Things got even better.  A sweetheart of a bartendress personally introduced me to a hottie of a shirtless acrobat, who asked me to be his ""assistant"" for a hat-throwing trick.  It was all so seamlessly pulled off, that some of the other bar patrons asked me if I worked there and had planned the trick with the acrobat in advance.  They were shocked when I told them that I hadn't.  Amazing.

There's more.  It involves secret rooms and fish funerals.  I can't reveal any other details, though.  You have to see it for yourself.

Every moment I spent in this venue ultimately become an amazing memory.  Let it be known that I absolutely LOVE Rose.Rabbit.Lie!!!",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,18,12,5,nlgMtrkU7LeFb-LrGPRRew

4633710,2014-01-27,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Chaos. Controlled and uncontrolled. Planned and unplanned. Bearable and unbearable.

We originally had midnight tickets to Vegas Nocturne (which should - and maybe does? - have its own Yelp page as it's a separate ticketed show within the Cosmo's Rose.Rabbit.Lie ""social experiment."") 

Part of me wants to give the entire restaurant, craft cocktail bar, show and experience 3 stars but then part of me feels guilty doing so - like I'm viewing it all wrong or with a too-critical eye. 
**Edit, I realized as writing this that the experience WAS worth 3 stars instead of 4. 

We walked in at 7:30 p.m. for our 8 p.m tickets to a ROARING main bar. I'm talking... you couldn't move roaring. We were never told we could explore any of the various other doors/saloons/sections, but instead were heralded in like shocked sheep. A five-piece jazz band played Top 40 covers, a woman sang on top of the bar, the contortionist (from the show, later on) tried to join her, only to fall off the bar in what I can presume was NOT planned. 

Then, suddenly, we were being told to take our seats for the show. We barely had time to buy our drinks. We sloshed between diners, drinkers and performers... trying not to bump into someone's $1,000 bottle of champagne or bite of caviar... and moved into the 'main stage' area and took our seats. The show itself was...... good. But ""the best Vegas has to offer?"" I'm not sure.

You see, two nights in a row Le Reve at the Wynn was cancelled while we were in Vegas due to a technical difficulty. I have seen that show once before and was slack-jawed in awe the entire production.  We traded our midnight ""Vegas Nocturne"" tickets (and by 'traded' I mean, got our measly $30 back and paid $130+ each for the 8 p.m. show) and were prepared to be wowed. Yes, it had me on edge a few times, but mostly, it's a variety show with a cast of characters that sometimes meld together, sometimes don't. When the show was over, we were ushered out and not told that we could hang around and see the various rooms (disappointed we missed those.) 

Overall, you're paying Cosmopolitan prices for a 3-star show. Then again, your'e in Vegas, where everything is outrageously priced. Did we get what we paid for? I'm really not sure..... I would have preferred to see the 7 p.m. Le Reve followed by the midnight Nocturne, but it is what it is. 

Had the chaos during our entrance been less severe and had we had the chance to see the other rooms of Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I'd probably give 4 stars. Just be prepared to fight the crowd, pay $22 for two Stellas (or, $40+ for two craft cocktails) and see a show that's not quite living up to the hype.

Though it's expensive, it's a good comparison to what you would've paid at the clubs, except you get better food, drinks, don't pay cover and don't have to fight the crowd.

Well folks, let's start with LIE.

The website and media coverage read that this was the show to end all show. I agree: the show should end. Period. What a complete waste of time and money. The show itself was nothing more than a group of acts that made no sense whatsoever. The only two striking acts were the brothers tap dancing and the female voice/rap artist. The guy with the dragon suite and ""Mr. Piffles'? Come guys, you can do better than that. And the fully clothe female ""accountant"" that can hide a red handkerchief? Do you really think stripping down to bare skin will sell? Spearmint Rhino does a bette act. And at the end with all the ping pong balls being shot all over the room? It is like the equivalent of being inside an inflatable castile with lots of balls floating around. The ""MC"" and hostess who sat on the side of the stage? Useless. The show is a big white LIE.

RABBIT

The bar area had a better lounge act and music entertainment than the show itself. It was as amusing as pulling a rabbit out of a hat.


ROSE

Really?

Supposedly this is from the same creators of Absinth next to Ceasars Casino. Take your money and buy a VIP ticket for Absinthe. Sit in the front row and you will have a greater time than us spending $137 VIP ticket for the worse show on the strip.

BTW...

I agree with other reviewers. The food is so bad compared to what is available as dining choices at Cosmo. Eat elsewhere before you arrive for the show. You will have a better time.

BUT THEN...

There are attendees that no matter how bad the show is, will still rate this show us one of the best. It just goes to show we are all different.

SAVING SOME $$$$

If you purchase a Groupon or Living Social thinking you scored big with a 2 for 1 price, you got it wrong. First of all, you will be seated in plastic folding chairs at the back of the room while everyone else who paid full price will be seating in nice upholstered chairs.

The policy of the restaurant was to let both or neither of us order off the his/her price fix menu; only one of us wanted it, but that was not allowed.

So we ordered another dish after eating our first two dishes- then she commented on how they would be changing plates for the main courses and that's why they liked having people order all the items together.

The caviar tacos were really cute and small. They tasted ridiculously good with the hamachi tucked inside (Thanks to the server for recommending). 
The warm spinach salad was a little too salty but still had all the right flavors.
The brussel sprouts took awhile but they were tender and not too shabby.
The RABBIT. I LOVED THE RABBIT...and the Foie was equally as amazing. It was my friend's first time trying it and it was exciting to see that she enjoyed it too.

A few reasons as to why I give it only 4 stars and not a perfect score: Drinks are way overpriced. Tickets are insanely expensive. Food wasn't mind-blowing... don't get me wrong, it was wonderful, but I was really expecting to be shipped off to another universe. For drinks, I purchased an Airmail & a glass of pinot noir & my total was $39 before tip. I've never spent that much money on drinks on the strip before.

I was trying to treat my family with a nice meal and they couldn't even remember to pour the champagne so we'd wasted half a bottle that we wouldn't have even known was left until I asked. By this point we all just wanted to leave as it was too loud and we wanted to be able to talk.  They offered to comp us dessert, although one of the party had already left as he was disgusted at the service and couldn't deal with the noise. Afterwards I spoke with the manager explaining we'd enjoyed the food but our champagne had been taken away and not served.  He was extremely rude and in a condensed version basically said he couldn't do anything but we could take the rest of the champagne with us.  The whole point was to have it with the meal, not to take a warm open bottle illegally in a car! Reading through reviews,  I'm not the first to have found the manager rude and treating guests poorly.  If you go, go with someone you don't want to talk to and I hope you don't have any problems because you'll just be left with extremely rude treatment and a bitter taste in your mouth.",AqgKsVe0xwlPD4t8C1Jp_A,1,1,1,01ZTwAr6dfn-Bxovnv-xjw
4900268,2017-10-21,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I've now gotten into the speakeasy, The Study, and wow. The drinks menu there is inspired, but I didn't actually order any drinks off of it, because the bartender said they also made drinks based on your individual preference, and I said sure, make me something I'll like. I pretty much just said spirit-forward, and she suggested an autumnal take on an old fashioned, which I tried and immediately fell in love with - I believe it had bourbon, apple, cinnamon liqueur, and a splash of Ardbeg for smoke. I was only going to get one drink, but the bartender's first creation was so delicious, when she mentioned she used Ardbeg, I just *had* to challenge her creativity, because I freaking love Ardbeg neat (in fact, now that I'm writing this review, I'm just going to *have* to go pour myself some), but it's rare to see it used effectively in cocktails. I told her to make Ardbeg the center of her second cocktail, and dang if that one wasn't even better than the first - main ingredients in that one were some sort of citrus juice, ardbeg, and house-made chipotle simple syrup that I am also going to have to try to make for my own use, because it was crazy good. Actually, it was a little sweet at first, and not quite smoky enough, but I mentioned that, and this is what I love so much about a bar where the drinks are made to your specification: she took it back and fixed it until I said it was perfect. (Just wish I'd remembered to get her name, so I could've called out how great her cocktailcrafting skills were. Oh well, I'm sure everyone working there is talented, anyway.)

It is a bit dangerous on the wallet, as it's a bit pricey, and you won't know exactly how much up front (I believe the first drink was $18 before tip, and the second around $20), but for drinks this good and this creative, every once in a while, I can loosen up and just pay for quality. You bet your butt I'll be back pretty much whenever I can get away with it. 

Main downside of the Study is, you don't get to see any of the show, but upside is, it's also probably the most laid-back place I've gotten to sip cocktails this good. It really does feel like a study, or at least it did when we were there - maybe it gets crazier late at night (I was there around 10).",7PHHxsjyk7I7oM6ENxwZZQ,3,1,5,_zu8J-0oBUI4u_BlU31f6Q

We almost cancelled since we had just flew in and dropped bags - but reviews said it was really too good to pass up - and they were right. You will not be disappointed. My hubby and I had caviar tacos - yes these little tiny bite size tacos stuffed with caviar. Just Perfection. Then we shared the French onion soup popovers. This is a play on French onion soup but it's a basket of this perfect pastry and two dishes you spoon on the onion soup flavor and this cheese and it gives the flavors without the soup. Amazing. Next the entree, we shared the PHo but it was lent typical - it had pieces of brisket, filet and foi gras in this flavored broth - again we could not believe every dish was a 10. We ended on the most decadent version of banana fosters I have had - flaming at the table and enough for two - poured over yes, banana bread and these little balls of perfect vanilla ice cream. Unbelievable- and that was the meal. The entertainment was gorgeous too - sang so beautifully and we were entertained throughout the meal. Wow.

4921750,2015-06-15,3,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I decided to take my mom and my sister to the 1st seating at 6:45 and was extremely excited to be there. They seated us in a great location and I was hoping for the grand treatment everyone had mentioned (like the purse holder and the amazing side shows). None of this happened. The waiter did greet us but seemed to want to rush our order. We needed to take our time since the menu is pretty large and definitely wanted to space everything out to make the most of the shows so I was put off a little. 

When the band started, we were so excited. The wall came down btwn the dinner side and the bar and a woman in a gorgeous red dress came out to sing. Except she didn't really sing. Somehow they got stuck on talking about BOOB sizes for the entire 20 min they were out there. They then proceeded to point out women around the bar for their breast size. It was so inappropriate! I'm all for a joke but the ENTIRE TIME? When she did sing, she was lovely but she would also stop singing when someone pulled out a camera. I assume she thinks she looks bad while mid verse? 

On to the food. The presentation was top notch Most of it was very good and you could overlook the pricing on the portion size and if you ordered properly, you won't be hungry or broke when you leave. 

DO ORDER-
Steak Tartare- Worcestershire Gelée, Cornichon, Egg Emulsion
Short Rib Stroganoff- Penne Pasta, Maitake Mushrooms, Glazed Pearl Onions 
(BEWARE- it only has one sad noodle for the huge portion of meat so be prepared to only have one bite of noodle if you're sharing).
Fingerling Potato Poutine. A little mushy but packed with flavor
coconut tapioca (can't remember the details but it came in an ice cream cup.

Delicious but too small-
Hokkaido Sea Scallops- Poached Salsify, Lemon, Vermouth
Caviar Tacos- Hackleback Caviar/ Yukon Gold Potato Shell/ Hamachi
(BEWARE they're smaller than a quarter but really delicious)

DON'T BOTHER- (I'll post pics)
We actually had to send back the Salmon fish. It was gorgeous when it arrived Salmon as it's cooked in a plastic bag which your server has to cut open. The fish had a weird tomato sauce and it was so fishy that it lingered forever. After sending it back, the waiter seemed pissed/bitter and they never checked on us again (not even for water) except to bring us the check and the dessert I mention below.  

Can't even remember what ""salad"" it was. It had an egg on top and 2 pieces of asparagus and a few croutons but almost no lettuce. 

The dessert they gave me for my birthday was so gross I couldn't finish. It was really pretty in a glass but the 2 macaroons were beyond stale and the cake ball (?) covered in sprinkles was ice cold and so dense, I couldn't eat it. I don't know why they even bothered. 

I eat at the cosmo so much and I was planning to bring my department here for work but not sure I feel comfortable with how it all went and the inconsistancy to give it another chance... time will tell.",7KYXjipzX5U9VBIKRPP7DA,4,2,3,Iw60yQSBVSRd8LMve4jSMQ
4924671,2017-05-06,5,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Rose Rabbit Lie is on my list of memorable Vegas experiences. For one, I've never dined with live entertainment singing to me. Two, the dishes here have amazing presentation and are presented quite differently than what I was expecting. Lastly, the entire ambiance was something I will never forget - from the menus to the lighting, walls, and the decor.  

I don't usually dine at upscale, pricey restaurants often - so when I do, I like to go all out. Located in the Cosmopolitan, Rose Rabbit Lie is right next to the Wicked Spoon. It's hard to miss with the mysterious doorway and lighted up red signage.  

I'll get to the drinks and food in a bit but THE MENUS. The menus had fine gold detailing and was so intrinsic that I had to take multiple pictures...at different angles...shhh. The whole restaurant screamed Alice in Wonderland and I loved it. However, we did have a difficult time trying to get service when there was a mix-up with one of our dishes. We were compensated, but the whole ordeal of how the restaurant handled things gave my boyfriend a negative experience for the rest of the night.  

DRINKS: Got the Thyme to Rumble, my bf's sister had Shrub 'N Tug, and bf had an Old Fashioned. All were $16 each. 

Highly recommend the Thyme to Rumble. It was smooth and to my liking. One of the best cocktails I've tried. I nearly finished 2 glasses and they were about to give me another refill but I declined and just asked for water. 

APPETIZERS: Caviar Taco $15, Glazed Brussels Sprouts $13, Argentinian Empanada $12, Slow Roasted Octopus $16. 

My bf wanted to try the caviar taco. It was a cute mini, bite sized taco and I couldn't believe he paid $15 for it. He said it was okay. The brussel sprouts were tender and had a strong taste of sherry. The empanadas came with this delicious sauce and definitely helped with the dry pastry. At least the meat inside was juicy. Out of all the appetizers we ordered, my favorite was the octopus - I'm biased for seafood. Even though it was a very small portion, I still enjoyed it. The octopus had a good char, crunch and was delicioussss.  

ENTREES: we each ordered our own - Pot au Pho $38, 20 oz. Bone-In Ribeye $56, Kurobuta Pork Chop $36.

I was very surprised when my pho came out with no broth or pho noodles. Then to realize that they actually pour the broth in front of you and this particular pho was 'reinvented'. It was very different but still had the same flavors. There was enough meat from the filet mignon and brisket, but I wished there was...MORE to it? The foie gras and thai basil wasn't enough for me to complete my usual pho craving, but in the end I was full and it wasn't bad. I wouldn't order this again though.  

I had a taste of the ribeye and it was amazing. You can't screw up meat that's for sure.  

One thing they did screw up on was my boyfriend's entrée. He had ordered the pork chop, but they gave him the pho instead. So we got 2 orders of pho...in trying to get a waiter to fix this mess; took much longer than it should have. One of them said the pho was on the house but they forgot to give us the broth. In trying to get the broth, the waiter's remarks to my bf was that it got 'soaked up'. Excuse you, but we can confirm to you that THERE WAS NO BROTH TO BEGIN WITH. My boyfriend then asked how long it would take for his pork chops and they replied with something like it'll be out shortly. He waited around 20-30 minutes and nothing. We tried to get someone's attention, but all waiters looked like they were pretending to be busy or avoiding our gazes/table. It was really annoying. My bf didn't even touch the pho because he wanted what he originally ordered which was the pork chops and he felt like the whole situation was his fault when it wasn't. You're the one who got his order wrong... 

After what seemed like ages, the pork chops finally came out and the waiter apologized. At this point all my bf wanted to do was eat. He ended up really enjoying the pork chops. It was very flavorful and cooked well - I'm glad he was able to put aside the whole shitty experience he had and make the best out of this. 

DESSERT: Chocolate Terrarium $35 
Everyone should order this for dessert, even if you're not a fan of chocolate. It's unique and I've never see/had anything like it. It's beautiful, like a live replica of a plant/flower. Everything in the terrarium was edible and sooo yummy. I liked how they mixed different textures and flavors together - such as the ice cream and marshmallows. We tried to finish as much as we can but ended up leaving a bit cause we were just too full.  

Overall, I really had a great time here and I'll never forget it. I would like to come back again with my bf so that he can have a better experience lol.",29XxHvrJAyvuRaPXu_h-QA,12,7,5,NXXIV-WzWVjaRCLNDrW2Hw

It's located next to the Wicked Spoon so we had a easy time finding it. As soon as we entered everyone was super friendly helping us find our seats and also at the bar. I was stoked to try out the cocktails. The lucky guy who got the chance to serve up mine was ""Tony"" I asked him to help me pick out my first drink to try, after he scolded me for that being the worst thing to say to a bartender he helped me pick a drink and left me with a Smile! He was really great! I ended up going back for seconds. My favorite drink ended up being this apple one. Since I'm terrible! I didn't keep track of the names but it was delicious . The first one I got was really strong and had a punch in the name lol..

Now as far as the actual show is concerned I thought it was OK! I know that it made me laugh a few times but it honestly felt too long and if I would've paid full price I would of been pretty upset . I think if you're unsure about whether you'd like the show I would check this place out as a night club / lounge or go to the cheaper 12am show. I swear my cocktails were strong enough I was even dozing off during some parts. 

My favorite was this part of the show that requires splash zone gear!

When the show is done you're free to explore all the other areas. It's really cool but hard to navigate while everyone is having dinner.
I can't wait to go back and try the food it looked so delicious and smelled great! I also wanna check out the night scene here but overall this place is the new place to be! And I had tons of fun..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,4,4,4,Ea1YxDguAoT8xPRNaUpcmg

This place is what's been missing from my life..... my 15-plus years of hitting Vegas.... all of it was building up to the moment I walked into Rose Rabbit Lie.

I came through the dining room... which was connected to the bar..... which was connected to some backstage lounge... which was connected to the club/stage area. This place is like a living movie/theater/reality set. I've never seen anything like it. The variety show itself was outstanding, from beat-boxing, to dancers, to singers, to comedy, to....... that weird gender-bender dream we've all had but will NEVER admit (yes... we've ALL had it... at least once).

I never thought I'd ever say I'd love a club..... but this is no club... this is.... a living stage, complete with wet dream.

The next 3 dishes were great and delicious, but then there was the glass cup lol. It came with foam on top, resembling and smelling like the most delicious cappuccino on this planet but we were all mistaken. 

Upon further inspection, it was actually another custard type of mix. It tasted like leftover pot roast mixed with heavy cream and celery. After 3 of us tasted it, no one else dared and it was pushed aside. The waiter admitted he hadn't tasted it and was the first time they were trying it out. We expressed our dissatisfaction and he cleared the table. The risotto was crunchy and bland, but the oysters were delicious. The dessert that arrived at the table was presented very sloppy.

Alice fell down the rabbit hole after eating a hit of acid and a tab of ecstasy. When she came to, she found herself in this horrible excuse of a night club in Las Vegas. What was touted as a great venue for live shows and next-level nightclubbing, she found to be a badly orchestrated mess of adults dressed up as furries (FURRIES!! full grown adults dressed in animal and fantasy costumes), a live performance that kept getting interrupted by awkward silences from the DJ and audience, a senior citizen dressed as a drag queen on stage, and about four or five employees getting right in her face and asking her menacingly, if she was having a good time. 

Poor Alice. She left a nightclub where there was an actual headlining DJ, so she could meet her friends who'd gotten on the guest list for this place. Next time she'll just stick to the original tea party she was holding court at. This place made an acid trip look like a less expensive vacation.  


(Disclaimers: there were no actual drugs or fairy tale characters involved, and the staff that wasn't dressed as furries were very accommodating and nice, unlike lots of other clubs on the strip. Are you guys owned by the Light Group as well? If so, you're one of the only tolerable staff roster under their belt.)",LeFy6UD83i65aniX4Rjf7Q,8,6,2,Cs9Sdm9ZttSW9XPNC7ubDg

I hate to go from 5 stars, to 4 stars, to 2 stars, but dinner was a definite miss for me.

They NO LONGER HAVE THE SHOW.  Vegas nocturnal is no longer next door, so all they have are a few singer and dancers performing every 30 mins or so, but its not what it was before. Sadly its Vegas so you can see this almost anywhere.  They weren't bad, but nothing was memorable.  

Oh its an its very loud... I know some people are sensitive to a lot of noise at restaurants.

Food was just ok.  I liked the foie gras, but otherwise it wasn't very memorable.  I wouldn't get the flatbread... flavors were all over the place.  Wagyu was super salty, but well cooked.   Portions are very small.

4990954,2014-01-05,5,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I had a great night at Rose. Rabbit. Lie.  We went to the 8 pm show.  It was an artsy version of Absinthe.  It had a nice mix of acrobatics, humor and oddball comedy.  It is better than Absinthe in the following ways: 1) The seats fit my fat ass.  I felt like I was being tortured squeezing in those Absinthe seats; 2) You can get up and go to one of two bars at the show venue any time you like.  Skoll!; 3) The decor makes you feel like you are at a high class joint whereas Absinthe makes you feel like you are at an Eastern European circus.  The same people produce both shows btw.

We then headed to find grub.  It was a bit confusing.  Since you can eat in any one of the 4 other rooms, we didn't know where to head after the show.  With some consultation, we were lead back to the front of the house to see the hostess.  They were very cordial and sat us next to the stage in one of the rooms.  There were many small acts that happened everywhere all the time: on top of the piano, on the bar, at our table, in all the rooms.  You really get your bang for the buck when it comes to entertainment.  Not a dull moment in sight.  There was a definite cabaret feel in the air.  The decor is Cosmopolitan  modern.  Fits right in with the hotel.  

I can see a lot of repeat value here.  You can try out the different dining room/bars.  They all are meant to have a different vibe.  You can just come for the show.  You can just come to have dinner.  You can just come and have cocktails.  You can go to the nightclub.  

You gotta be impressed with a menu that is wax sealed.  It means you get a different menu every night, no?  Our nice waiter, Patrick, gave us all the menus as souvenirs.  

We ordered the heavenly egg with truffles.  It was a very small portion but tasty.  I ordered the lobster and was disappointed because it was way too salty.  The flatbread was tasty.  It reminded me of the pizza with the egg on it from Due Forni.  

The desserts were outstanding.  I haven't seen Oeufs a la neige on a menu since I was little.  That dessert was light and airy and not too sweet.  The Pine Nut Mousse was delicious and inventive.  That red beet meringue seems molecular gastronomy freeze dried to me.  Went really well with the poached pear's sweetness.  The Mousse is not what you'd expect.  It is more like a sponge with gingerbread crumbs on the bottom.  The chocolate pudding looked like an egg in a nest.  The caramel ice cream is the egg.  The nest is dehydrated chocolate mousse.  So fun to eat.  We also got extra desserts that were visual and tasty feasts.

I have to add a note about the flat wear and service pieces because I love restaurants that work on the little things.  Love the little rabbit fork holders, the printed patterns on the silverwear, the french press set, the cups etc.  It all just fits the Cosmo's flair.

After reading numerous reviews about this place, I still decided to take a chance on hosting my Hustands 50th Birthday Dinner. Numerous emails with the staff and calls to outline what kind of dinner i wanted to host. Every assurance that we would not have the service issues, i had read about. None of this mattered to the staff on site:
45 minutes to get cocktails to the table, numerous mistakes on orders, even though all courses were pre ordered and pre paid, they failed to make enough main course to feed all of my guests, leaving people waiting to dine. 

The kicker for me, was the check drop less than 2 minute from singing Happy Birthday, no ask of coffee, dinner drinks, no time to wolf down dessert. Just the check drop to one of my guests, when clearly I was the one hosting. With the instruction we need to hurry up, as the table was being given to the next guest. In fairness this was at the two hour mark. However if you take 45 minutes to deliver drinks, and no food, how do you expect people to eat 4 courses and dessert, in an hour and fifteen minutes. THE SERVICE was the WORST, the ATTITUDE with it, even worse. When i spoke to the manager about this issues, he said, well this is why i was brought in .

Rose.Rabbit.Lie, youve just tried to hard...

Yet again Cosmopolitans recreation of an attepmt to make a chic, modern version of a Burlesque, Cabaret, nightlife showroom, with no burlesque or cabaret, let alone even the slightest feel of the ""social-club.""

For granted, the opening female performer beatboxing and overlaying her own music on stage with an R&B cover of current popular hiphop needs a record deal! Also the beautiful scantilly clad contortionist, keep her too!!

The rest of the sloppy, unchoreographed ""show"" can do away. Almost had remembrance of a less raunchy, pitiful storylined version of ""The Act""(their shows were more theatrical).

That aside, cocktails were great, powerfully overpriced for just being a few classics and a few simple basic cocktails with added bitters(i.e. The washington apple and fuzzy navel) They were tasteful and aromatic, but i expected more, especially being  at the Cosmo. Plus, i was shocked when the bartender didnt know what i was speaking of when i asked for an orange swath!

All in all, i had a great time, it was underwhelming, but i had fun. Perfect for the tourist whos never seen the likes, not so much for the Local who has seen it all.

Great door staff by the way, welcoming and smiling.

The entrance and ambiance set an edgy vibe to the space and feel for the night. The seating varies from tables to 2 person booths, to bar top seating. It's an incredibly stimulating environment between the many colors and textures in the decor, the premium menus, food presentation, sleek automated screens that are lowered during the performances and raised during their breaks for privacy. 

We had a number of dishes that were all delicious and adventurous in their own right, including the charred octopus, the braised kale, the herb rolls, and the agnolottii pasta. The black cod was one dish we personally didn't fall in love with as the blossom tea broth was beautifully served and had a gorgeous purple hue to add a fun element to the dish but the taste felt out of place and too acidic.

We also enjoyed the prawns entree but regretfully passed on dessert which looks unreal from what we saw coming to other tables around us. (We're suckers for Milk Bar desserts located in The Cosmopolitan!) The entertainment also seemed to be slightly watered down for a Wednesday night as we only had the live musicians and two vocalists performing. 

But all in all it was an exceptional experience and I will definitely look to go back in the future on a weekend night to experience the full lineup of entertainment. 

On a side note, we were also happily surprised to not see a Live Entertainment Tax on our final bill which we were expecting!",76CP9Yw-34M_rNnOcwXzkw,2,2,4,4X1x0nGSAbVNZkyuZTyqaQ

The cast and ushers stay pretty true to character and try to interact with patrons as much as they can while trying to get ready for their cues and provide entertainment.  

I had tickets for the 8pm Show.  I usually show up a little early to get settled in and get a feel for the atmosphere, but really had no idea what I was getting into with this place!  I tried to research and google and yelp, but really still wasn't sure.  ""It's like Absinthe"" is a great explanation if you've seen Absinthe but as I haven't, it didn't really help.

They play live music as you walk in and they're covers of popular modern songs.  The band and singers are phenominal and do a great job of putting a bit of an old school twist on a modern song.  

Around showtime, you're led into another room where there's a bit of a tidbit of a show that leads you to the main show room. 

The showroom is small, but accomodating.  The seats can be a bit cramped and I wouldn't recommend getting up mid performance anyways, but if you're at the end, it's a bit of a hastle.  There really aren't any bad seats though.  

The show itself is about what you'd expect from someone who's got too much money, on the sauce, and just enjoying life.  It's light, fun, and at times a bit random.  I can't say too much as the audience is sworn to secrecy, but at least there were assigned seats.

I really enjoyed the show and plan on going back again!  I think the intimacy of the theater coupled with the acts that are engaging and sometimes bizzare always manage to leave the audience laughing and entertained.  


TIPS:  

* Get there early so you can really take the place in and have the time to enjoy your drink/food.  It really is a bit of a shock.

* Dress nicely - it does have a dress code, but it's pretty easy.  But you really do stand out and it's harder to get immersed into the feeling when you don't mesh well with everything else.  Besides, IT'S NIGHT TIME IN VEGAS!

* No flash photography, but the lighting is usually sufficient to get a decent shot of what you want.  The stage is round and the actors play to all parts of the stage.",arMixfJTyczy_yb5qBXdlg,3,2,5,DKXpOWHfOYRVyaIJXWWuag

Once you enter the Cosmopolitan from valet, the entrance is right up the first escalators.  After giving the security guards your ticket, you're taken in the first room: a hostess station room.  You'll notice lots of different doors.  Omg, I felt like I was in an episode of Alice in Wonderland.  We showed our tickets and was whisked away to the bar area up the stairs.  The layout was pretty rad.  Two bars on either side of the room.  There was a section with oversize chairs in a half moon stadium seating layout. The middle was a revolving stage and some trapdoor staging.  We were in for a great treat! 

At the bar, I decided to get the Moscow Mule for around $10.  Such a cool thing, it was on tap!  The flavor was great! I must say it was probably the best Moscow Mule I've ever had.  The garnish was a couple of candied ginger pieces.  Great touch to the drink and really brought out the ginger flavor.  The actual show was pretty awesome!  Without giving away the entire show, I really enjoyed the montage of different acts and talents.  My favorite were the twin tap dancers. They were on point! There was a little bit of comedy, suspense and a whole lot of personality!  I highly recommend this place!

After the show, we were taken to another room called the Study.  It was another bar area/lounge set up like a home library.  The cool thing was that some of the performers actually engaged in the audience in this room.  My only problem was the server there. I don't know her name but she was a little rude to our table.  At one point, one of my friends was a little loud and she ""cut"" him off as he seemed inebriated.  Funny part was, HE WAS OUR DESIGNATED DRIVER!  Bad call on her part, but not the complete end to our lovely evening.

We walk into a room of doors and shown the door to the showroom. I really think the presentation of the different rooms is fun and impactful. 

We grabbed some drinks and while they are $14-16 a cocktail, they are quite delicious.  We got the whiskey smash which was refeshing and the monte carlo that brought out the best in the whiskey. 

We sat down and thankfull were seated on the bench instead of the foldup. The Fiance and I were a bit hungry so we ordered the caviar and egg flatbread. There isn't a full service here for food but we were able to go pick up our food at the bar when ready and bring to our table. It was good combination of flavors and nice crisp and light texture, but a bit skimpy on toppings. 

The show was inappropriate and fun as expected. I think the people in it are awesome as they have the best emotes and really sell their character. 

After the show they usher you through the bar where a live band plays. The awesome thing is the people in the show perform little solo acts here. We saw three before they stopped and did curtain call for the next show. 

This place is fun and doesnt take itself so seriously.  It's a great dinner and show place that actually doesnt suck and is tired.

- Intimate vibe

Cons:
- Pricey, pricey, pricey
- Location is Cosmo is horrible... so far away from everything

Food, drinks and the show tickets are so expensive that I wonder how they will maintain. I wish them the best and hope they will continue to entertain. Many of these style venues are not successful in Vegas as they are more geared towards a NYC or SF type crowd of people with money that enjoy the off the wall theater.

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sautéed spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

The house band was decent, the two singers were excellent, but they definitely were paying attention to the tables that were ordering the most from the bar. And they took a whole lot of breaks - probably more than two thirds of the time we were there, they were on a break. There was also only one other performer - a break dancer, and he was on stage for no more than a minute. Seriously.
We stayed way longer than we normally would have, expecting ""something"" to happen, but... nothing. Service was a bit rushed and now that I think back to it from my notes, it was quite unfriendly and cold, with no real reaction to our orders or interaction at all, other than taking down the orders and delivering them. For the cost, which had an obvious surplus over normal menu prices because of the 'atmosphere', we definitely would've liked more welcoming service. 

To share:
herb brioche rolls - bordier butter, Maldon salt
Wagyu Steak Tartare - Beef Chicharron, Cornichon, Savory Mayonnaise

Her plate:
Black Bucatini - Alaskan King Crab, Uni Butter, Coddled Egg, Smoked Trout Roe

His plate:
Glazed Brussels Sprouts - Sherry Gastrique, Manchego Cheese, Crispy Chicken Skins
Penne Pasta - Slow Braised Pork Ragù, Sheep's Milk Ricotta

The brioche rolls were airy, buttery, and perfectly cooked. We barely had a chance to get through them before our next course was out, though - it would've been nicer to have more than a minute or two to savor.

The wagyu was expertly cut, delicate, and flavorful. The chicharrons were a delicious vehicle for eating this tartare, but the cornichons were a little too plentiful.

D's brussels and pasta were both received as ""adequate but boring"" - the brussels tender but not interestingly crisped, the pasta ""just pasta"".

My black bucatini was definitely the flavor star of the meal, as unctuous as you'd want it to be with the uni butter and the trout roe. My only complaint here was temperature - it was almost room temperature when it was served, so the butter was very very apparent by the time I was done eating. It really did taste great, but the texture got a bit odd.

We were both a bit underwhelmed by the drinks, mostly because of how much they'd been talked up by everyone else. I had the Moscow Mule on tap, and he had the Rum Punch. Both were okay, but neither inspired a re-order. Good but not something that made us grab the drink again and say wow, these were really kinda disappointing.

I think that this is an okay show. It does lack in humor. There are some funny parts, but it's seems to be too copied from Absinthe. I know it's the same creators, but they seem to use a lot of that show in this one. Same type of characters, same type of humor. It's just not near as humorous. 

Also, the acts are very simple. There is nothing that wow's you. They were all basic ""magic"" tricks that you learn when you're a kid. They try to make it more appealing to have a naked woman hiding a red scarf in her body parts...it's just kind of bizarre to me. You had a guy swallowing swords, a dude with a rat (chihuahua) that he puts into a cannon and shoots it (not really...) and a flexible lady in a plastic ball. The coolest part for me was the twins tap dancing. And I do love me some tap dancing. 

Overall, the show was good/decent. It was entertaining enough, but it just didn't do it for me. I've seen most of the shows on the strip, and they all are roughly the same concept, of course.

This place makes me so happy. I can't wait to come back here next time I'm in town. Live band playing great upbeat jazz, a tap dancer doin' his thing on top of the piano, and a live singer all performing simultaneously together. 
The food was also very innovative and upscale. 
Our server/bartender Marcus was a wizard with the cocktails and made us a bunch of different off menu delights. He was also bursting with personality and very attentive.

All the reviews about the fabulous performances you have read no longer apply....yelp does not let me post a link, so search google for rose rabbit lie/news and you will see that Nocturne, the show, is no more.

Unfortunately I didnt know that ahead of time, so we arrived for a 10pm reservation on a Friday night.  I would think, prime time.  But the ""show"" was really lame - nothing more than a band playing too-long versions of standard rock songs (Beatles, Prince).  Each song went on for 13 minutes so the singer could work the crowd.  Very very boring.  Another boring, no-energy singer joined the band later and she spent the entire time singing bent over the piano, singing to the piano player with her back (her gigantic posterior, actually) pointed at the crowd.  We never saw her face.  Very poor lounge act, and no magic, no contortionists, none of the stuff I read about.  A really terrible ""show"", which, after a while became annoying.  We paid and left after about 1 1/2 hours of this.

The food and cocktails were great, and prices were reasonable by Vegas standards, though!  Pity about the terrible, annoying entertainment.  My recommendation, do not consider going here until they et their act together, literally.",GuYxV6_-_y0vobc7ibywbA,17,5,1,X_PbXOaFwrqgTV2wFe3eZw

Or, head across the street to Tix4Tonight and get them for $40. 

The show is sort of a variety show, but 3 of the acts incorporated tap dancing or similar rhythmic drumming with body parts. They definitely twist a couple things around, and you get something wholly unexpected and hilarious (a cross-dressing juggler on a pogo stick or the bath show with a guy essentially doing silks), but there were also a couple acts that fell flat, and nothing was particularly awe-inspiring.

I sat at the bar and ordered a drink, the Widow's Kiss, from the variety of original luxury cocktails. I ordered the Crispy Chicken which was absolutely exquisite with the puree and black truffle.
The live music was icing on the cake. The entertainers sang and danced up and down the bar area, interacting with patrons.
I happened to meet Mary Smith from Motown group The Supremes that night, which was a real treat.

Perhaps the most misunderstood restaurant on The Strip and thought by some to have closed down due to its assumed synonymy to Vegas Nocturne it was with little regard for the now defunct show that myself and three friends descended the wormhole of Rose. Rabbit. Lie. and with food and drink as our focus even as various forms of entertainment paraded the dining room I'm happy to report that not only is the kitchen still open, but that it is also turning out some of the most impressive plates in the 702.  Considered by some to be misbranded from the start while others bemoan the space as frankly overdone it was just after 6:30 that I arrived to find my friends waiting in the subdued Library Bar and with tab soon settled it was onward to the dining room that we progressed - a cozy fourtop at the center of the room affording us a full view of the well-appointed confines where service would shine brightly amongst the best in the city with a casual wink underlying unwavering knowledge of the menu, ingredient sourcing, and even technique.  Often times trending far too loud for casual conversation as acts ranging from a real-life Jessica Rabbit to break-dancing Teens and a Jazz quartet roamed the dining room it was with five small plates that our meal began and with gratis $15 tacos stuffed with roe whetting our palates for more both the truffle imbued gougeres and glazed carrots would prove early favorites, the former an ethereal flavor bomb wrapped in delicate choux while the later deftly walked a fine line between earth and acid.  Moving next to two house-made pastas from which the better would be a dispute and then onward to supple sautéed rabbit served alongside creamy fried oysters atop an herbal cream fortified with pork it was finally with the tableside feast of chicken that our savories did culminate and although some may balk at the $98 tab it would be hard to name a better bird in all of Las Vegas, Savoy's $180 Guinea Hen or Robuchon's $250+ Pintade taken into account.  To this point all smiles it was nearly three hours after our arrival as the band riffed on Elton John that a duo of desserts was presented and although the crowned cookie jar was rather blasé aside from the succulent macarons the much-heralded terrarium was nothing short of a masterpiece; a decadent composition of textures and temperatures with elements both savory and sweet that rivals presentations at Atelier Crenn, Red Medicine, or even Alinea for a finish with flare, an absolute must order for anyone who loves chocolate while though those looking for something more fruit driven (and truly afire) might be wise to consider one of the tableside flambées...something I surely won't pass up as I plan a return visit before year's end.

Balancing a high price point with exemplary ingredient sourcing and service that stands far ahead of its competition Rose. Rabbit. Lie. may be the most underrated restaurant on Las Vegas Boulevard today and although the sound level often proves far too loud for casual conversation the show itself actually proves quite entertaining, as well.  Still up in the air in the post-Nocturne era with a lawsuit hanging in the balance one can only hope that when the dust settles Rose. Rabbit. Lie. will continue to thrive and even if the concept should rebrand or shutter that the culinary team will be kept intact - a meal in the library perhaps the best-of-both-worlds for those seeking truly innovative cuisine in space that seems miles from any casino floor but not yet willing to invest in a night at Pierre Gagnaire's Twist or e by Jose Andres.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,6,5,gbiOiNM3yMrmYXj7j4iqQw

Story - We were about five minutes late for our reservation, and when we arrived the hostess said that our table was ready but that we needed to be out by 830 because someone else had a reservation after us. I thought this was a weird thing to say but figured ""hey we have 2 hours that will be plenty of time.""

We get in an are seated in an absolutely BEAUTIFUL space. I mean the decor is impeccable, from the lighting down to the silverware absolutely incredible. 

Our waiter comes and drops off the menus at our table and does a brief explanation of how the menu works. Explaining that most people get 3 or 4 items, one from each column of the menu. He then leaves us to decide, and this is where things got weird. 

Our waiter comes around for drink orders, now I am feeling a little under the weather so I just get a diet coke, and our waiter says to me, ""that's it?"" I say yes, and he moves on...the rest of the table orders drinks, keep in mind there are 7 of us. 

I only order one item [again not feeling great)  from the menu, the octopus,which was SO GOOD however,  I only ordered one thing I expected it to come out with everyone else's entrees instead of their appetizers. So that was super uncomfortable for me as I just sat there while the entire rest of the table ate their entrees.

During this time we had the performers and they were amazing as well. The first Singer totally reminded us of Jessica Rabbit and was just an incredible singer. 

Dessert times this is my favorite part of dinner lol. I was so excited to get the Panna Cotta I could not wait. Our server comes and drops off dessert menus and then DISAPPEARS FOR 30 MINUTES. So we did not end up ordering desert because at this point it was 815 and if you remember, the hostess told us we had to be out by 830.

We had beet salad, snow peas salad, sauted calamari, steak tartare, duck confit pasta, salmon, brussel sprouts, and braised pork.  For dessert we had s'mores.

The entertainment far outweighed everything else and it was the bessssst start to the night. I'd come back for the live entertainment alone, so catchy and fun. The performers really know how to engage the crowd with great song choices which makes it such a blast. 

If you want to order from the pre fixed menu, then everyone at your table has to do so. We all agreed since everyone was quite happy with the selections. For $50 you'll have an appetizer, main, and dessert. The caviar taco is an additional $10 and it's probably as big as my thumb. It's presented really cutesy though. I opted out, already had quite a good amount of food coming. 

If you'd like an alcoholic beverage from the pre fixed menu, it's also an additional charge. Friends that ordered the drinks said they were unbalanced- too sweet/too sour depending on the choice, and pretty terrible. 

The meal overall wasn't amazing but it was pretty good. 

The bread to start was really good, texture on point. The shrimp cocktail, also delicious! The shrimp were super fresh and the flavors were well balanced with just enough tang without being overpowering. I got the Belgian Endive nix the jamon as a starter. Can't say I was super impressed but was fine. I quite enjoyed the Crispy Loup de Mer (even though it could have used a bit more seasoning). It was made extremely well, and flaked perfectly. It was a pretty large portion, too. 

For dessert, they were out of the Meyer Lemon Tart so opted for the Campfire S'mores which I only ate the toasted marshmallow off of since I found the rest to be un proportional in ratio. Marshmallows are my favorite anyways. I realllyyy wanted the Terrarium but was way too full so I admired it from someone else's table far, far, away. So pretty. Sigh. 

I much appreciated the stunning presentation here. 

The service was a bit slow, not everyone received their food at the same time but it's nbd if you aren't starving. 

For all you studly vegetarians, you get your own separate menu, just ask.

2 drinks
- Pisco Punch 
- Watermelon Apple
$40

- Doors open 15min prior to show time. Before we watched the show, we got a couple drinks that were pretty good but really expensive. A small cocktail was about $20. We got 2. There was a lot of alcohol in the drink so we sipped in for about 30 min to finish it. Not too fruity. 
- We got our tickets an 1.5hr earlier before the show started and we got pretty good seats. I didn't have to move around because of someone's big head. 
- The chairs were pretty close together, no personal space, but manageable. 
- The show was entertaining. I'd say the most memorable performance was the tap dancing. The twins had a lot of energy 
- There was a beat boxer which was amazing. 
- Another Tap dancing couple. They started with their hands and then using both hands and feet. They battled the tap dancing guys which was really fun to watch.
- Piff the magic dragon was pretty funny. Disappearing dog trick. 
- There was also a guy that took off a lot of underwear....haha
- Contortionist was out of this world. 
- There was also this other performance where this lady stripped butt naked. She'd have this red cloth it would disappear then reappear. How she did it, boggles my mind. LOL 
- Some acrobatic acts and a yo-yo performance that was fantastic! 
- It seemed more like a variety show and at the end, you can either leave or stick around and lounge. 
- Still don't understand why it's called what it is, but I'd recommend that you should see it. You get to throw a bunch of ping pong balls at everyone at the end. LOL. It gets wild.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,5,5,4,yegzWJnZFkWyn3grTsyP_g

Seeing, being awake  and partaking in a whimsical experience is fun, unreal and confusing. Moulin Rouge-esque vibe. I went here with Yelp friends for dinner and drinks.

Located on the 2nd floor and the same side as Wicked Spoon. Big double door with girls with a clipboard and guys in red velvet jackets. You'll be taken to the foyer. Lots of doors that remind me of Choose Your Own Adventure - which door leads to what? If you close your eyes and spin around a few times, you wouldn't know which door you should open...and then, there are hidden doors. So cool!

We had entertainment while we were eating, drinking and talking. The lights would flicker and get dim when a show is about to start but they orchestrate food service so well. They have girls with tassels on poles, polka band playing David Guetta's ""Memories"" and a maid singing to ""Blurred Lines"" in polka version, twin tap dancers, a contortionist, etc.

Their cocktail menu is pretty hardcore - lots of whiskey, bourbon, rum and tequila which I'm not a huge fan of because of what they can do to me BUT I tried a few drinks anyway. They're quite strong but good - like a kick on the head strong. The food was also delicious - small portions.

Airmail:
Rum, orange blossom honey, lime and sparkling wine. Out of all the drinks we've sampled, this was the perfect one for me. Citrusy and a nice balance between rum and wine. 5/5

White Rum:
It looks and tastes almost like fruit punch but with a kick. This was served in the Cloak Room and I love how they made reference to ""The Shining""'s redrum...redrum. 5/5

Suisse Abyss:
Absinthe, creme de cacao, cream and grated Swiss chocolate on top. You can get this drink from The Study where the famous bartender Ju is at. This drink looks like dessert but it's nothing like it. 4/5

Rumble in the Jungle:
Cachaca, 12yr rum, clarified Thai milk tea, bamboo served with a cinnamon stick. Also from The Study cocktail menu. This was strong but I loved the flavors. 5/5

Braised Pork:
Soft, juicy chunks of pork with polenta air, black truffle and gremolata. It's a rich and creamy dish. 5/5

Loup De Mer en Croute:
Branzino with creamed spinach. The skin is wonderfully crisp and the sauce was a bit citrusy. 5/5

Butterscotch:
The presentation is very earthy and organic. You have globs of butterscotch, a lump that of hazelnut cream and crisp cookie that looks like a rock with flowers on top and twigs made of chocolate. 5/5

Thanks to DV, DN and IA for a fantastic evening! I was highly entertained and they had my attention the whole night which is quite a feat since my attention span is short.

5323674,2017-08-08,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"It bewilders me how this amusingly-punctuated establishment remains staunchly outside the radar of most Vegas visitors. Yes, it's hidden away in the caboose of Cosmopolitan, but the Wicked Spoon buffet is literally right outside, and visitors can't possibly miss seeing the glowing red ""Rose.Rabbit.Lie"" sign next to the buffet entrance.

Anywho. I've never eaten a single bite here, so I can't riff on the rabbit-sized-portion meme that consistently reappears on R.R.L Yelp reviews. My OCD visiting sequence is as follows: a) arrive right at 6pm, just after the doors open, b) immediately enter the anteroom and hang a left into The Study for cocktails 1 & 2, then c) pop into The Library and grab a cushy barstool at the bar around 7pm, just as the live entertainment kicks off.

Most people who visit R.R.L to dine or to sit at The Library's bar seem to miss The Study, which is a shame. It's a much quieter, more intimate bar that's actually an homage to the adventurous spirit of 19th-century British explorers.  Wooden bookshelves display African art and antique knicknacks, and the entire place looks like a study belonging to the guy Timothy Dalton played in Penny Dreadful.  The cocktail program here is, in my opinion, second to *none* on the Strip; the drinks are unique, innovative and served in delightfully intricate barware. Come early and grab the dark little alcove booth in the corner if I haven't gotten there first.

But the real magic is in the Library. Bathed in soft purple lights, the sleek, long bar is staffed by knowledgable bartenders nearly (but not quite) on par with The Study's keepers.  Bizarrely, the rotating menu of *draft* cocktails (generally mule variants) are quite impressive, as is the set cocktail menu, providing you can read it at all due to the low lights.

If you're very lucky, just as you settle in to your absurdly tall barstool, one of R.R.L.'s resident vocalists will begin belting out ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Or perhaps someone will start tap dancing through the bar area. Or someone might jump on top of the piano and start break dancing.  You're never quite sure what's going to happen here, and I wish I could somehow put the euphoria that this place makes me feel into words.  But everything is purple, everything is electric, and everyone is smiling without even trying.

There's a timeless coolness to this place that I think is lacking in Las Vegas.  Long after Martin Garrix and Chainsmokers stop appearing on Wynn Social billboards, a stiff drink, a beautiful room, a passionate vocalist and an epic jazz band will still be cool...will *always* be cool.",5Oxq2pC8lt-wkxY7coBLCA,6,0,5,1w8P8nj00qKfBOAZ4k82Aw

Our waiter was great, and the only highlight of the evening.  Food was low quality and difficult to see in the dimly lit showroom.  In the span of 5 minutes, had a tap dancer, tumbling kid, and an Aretha Franklin look a like.  Weird and contrived, even for Las Vegas.  Weird crowd too.

5362090,2014-10-31,2,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Sadly, classic case of caveat emptor in Vegas. Truely a unique experience, I've recommend RRL to everyone.  I would like to think it was just a bad night, but alas my experience is likely indicitive of a bigger issue.

The bottom line: since last visit prices increased and portion size decreased. (I wish I had realized this last night as the owner happen to be seated at a table behind us with his friends and we had a long conversation about how much we loved the place.)

Took a friend for her 40th birthday as a treat. At first glance in looking at the menu the prices seamed higher than I recalled, but not until comparing reciepts at home today (and the menu here in yelp) was it confirmed. I also left last time feeling full and satisified. This time ordered more and more, but alas left not so full.

Examples of some of the changes:
- Calamari
    Previous Price: $10 (also price they show on menu online) 
    Last night: $14

- Short Rib Stoganoff
    Previous Price: $19 (also price they show on menu online) 
    Last night: $34 
   Also, look at the pics of fellow yelpers, it used to be 3 portions of rib with  pieces of pasta. Last night it was only 1 with garnish. (not exactly a big plate portion as indicated)

For roughly the same meal, last time our check was just under $200 for 2 people including a bottle of wine. Last night, with the addition of a flatbread, but otherwise the same meal just over $400.  ouch!

There are more examples, but you get the idea. I'm sure RRL would say they are just a business adjusting prices based on food costs, and the one time out-of-towners on expense accounts won't bat an eye.

As a local this went from being my go-to-special plate, to a place that's not quite worth it. (sadly)  


Since RRL has entertainment, they charge the LET tax plus sales tax (18%), so that on top of inflated prices and smaller portions...  too much for this gal.

I'm including my prvious review below as context .

Review from 8/22 visit 5 Star
Well done RRL. While the ticketed show is closed, the restaurant has incorporated 30 minute acts that change & evolve throughout the night. Think speak-easy meets super club with modern tapas plates and a cocktail & wine list fit for foodies.

The food, entertainment, service and decor are top notch. Perfect for a special night out or client entertaining.

We went on a Wednesday for the 8:00 show. I don't want to give anything away so I won't name the acts, it ruins the surprise factor. Besides I took an oath.
We had some drinks from the bar at the show, The Washington Apple and The Whisky Smash. Both were excellent drinks, the apple was more on the sweet side. Yes they are pricey drinks but what show drinks aren't expensive, at least your getting a well made drink by someone that knows what they are doing.
Before the show I felt like I couldn't tell cast from guests, there were some characters in the audience that made for good people watching. Things and people for the show are being pushed around, readying for the show as you wander around looking for the bathroom. There's just so much eye stimulation going on.
Our seats weren't that hot but we didn't pay for them so I wasn't complaining. +1 for not having to sit on those folding chairs. (My boney ass is thankful)
After the show we went over to the restaurant/bar to check it out. It was packed. A band plays while some of the show's cast put on a show of their own before the next show starts. There were a lot of people eating and at the bar drinking.

SHRIMP & GRITS
I love Shrimp & Grits. I make Killer Shrimp & Grits. I know Shrimp & Grits! These were great  Shrimp & Grits!  Tender, Sweet Shrimp, Perfectly Spiced, served over rich, creamy, flavorful Grits.

BONE MARROW
There was a time when I wouldn't have given Bone Marrow a second thought, but now I order it almost any time I see it on a Menu. This version of the dish was one of the best I've had.

LAMB SADDLE
Actually prepared two ways. Roasted Loin and Shank en Daube (stew). Perfectly cooked, tender and rich.

ROASTED FOIE GRAS
Another perfectly prepared dish. Fig Jam and Candied Pistachios helped cut the Richness of the Foie Gras.

CAMPFIRE S'MORES
A fun inventive take on the childhood favorite! Smoke rose from the plate as our server lifted a glass dome.

Wow, so where do I begin?  We got there at 7:30, and were promptly seated, at a table that rocked so much our drinks almost spilled.  We asked the waiter for his help, and he came back with something to put under one side of the table to stop it from rocking.  He couldn't do it though, because there had already been so many things stuck underneath it, it was impossible - so we moved to another table.  There was this really cheezy lounge singer, SO LOUD, that we couldn't hear ourselves to have a conversation, nor could we hear the waiter trying to explain things on the menu.
There was some guy tap-dancing on the piano, now sure if he was part of the show or what, but this unreasonably loud singer that seemed out of a dive-bar in Compton, and a tap dancer on the piano was hardly the ""entertainment"" we were expecting!  We thought it would be like some of the pictures we've seen, girls dancing, in costume, more like ""acts"", etc.  Was this in another room maybe?  Who knows, we were never told there were any other options other than this one, which was awful.
 Okay - so lets move onto THE FOOD portion of the evening.  First of all - MAKE SURE you don't touch any of the dishes on the hot entrees & appetizers!  They are HOT, and will BURN you!  We got burned TWICE before we learned our lesson!  The wait staff DOES NOT TELL YOU ""this plate is hot"" when they deliver the food!  They put it on the table, explain it briefly, (which we could barely hear), then walk away.  Later when I spoke to who I thought was the manager about it - I told her that we got burnt from the plates, and that they should tell people to be careful that the plates are hot! she simply said ""oh yes, that probably would be a good idea"". 
LOL, great.  We got the first item, which was the Lobster Cocktail"" which was *awesome*, but very very small.  We each got a bite of lobster, that was about it.  But it was excellent, so we were hopeful.  The next dish, (and every subsequent one after that) was just awful.  The shrimp & grits - (HOT plate! don't touch!) so salty, impossible to eat.  The rolls (again, hot plate! don't touch!) - under cooked, doughy. The grilled octopus - weird, almost mushy? Not sure how else to describe it, but yuk.  Mahi - very good, but very acidic sauce.  That was it, we got 5 things.  Then we decided to try dessert, so we got the Chocolate Terrarium, it was very big - and had many things inside, but the only good part was the pudding, how can you go wrong with pudding! And the ice cream. The cake was very bla, and the crumbled ""dirt"" cake - again, gets a big fat ""yuk"" certainly not a $35 dessert!! So 5 appetizers, 1 dessert, 2 beers, and a coffee, after they added tax of around $12, and then seriously - LE tax on top of that - ""Live Entertainment"" tax of another $15 - we were at $150 - plus tip, $180.

The drinks were 4 stars for sure, but we had to give two stars based on the unfulfilled potential of the place. It opened in 2014 as a Spiegelworld show, and the venue reflects that. There's spots for acrobats to perform, and a big stage that's now reserved for private events. Instead we got a lounge singer crooning Radiohead and another with too much plastic surgery singing Edith Piaf so off key you'd think it was karaoke night at the local tonedeaf society. In short, it's a shell of what it promised to be, and you should save your money for elsewhere.",MEj1rd4Wk8FV-55QZ3CEBA,0,0,2,7ynQvj3Z-iFv14BnDv0nZA
5483529,2014-02-24,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Definitely a classy experience! But you have to go in with the expectation that you're going to be spending $16/cocktail at the main bars and $20 during the show (they auto-add gratuity/fees).

Despite the pricey cocktails, the ambiance is amazing and the allure of the hidden mysteries that lie behind secret doors is too tempting to miss. 

We purchased the livingsocial deal for the 10pm canto and picked up our tickets around 6:15 on the night of the show. We were seated in the second row of section 100, but in the corner... so while we were very close to the action, we were behind the entertainers and couldn't see the images on projector screen.

We were fortunate to be ""invited"" back to both the Cloak Room before the 10pm canto and the Study after the show. We had just purchased drinks at the bar in the Music room and were waiting patiently when a male/female duo approached us and asked us what our plans were for the evening. We told them we had tix for the 10pm canto and said perfect... they'd swing by to pick us up and take us to the Cloak Room after the performer finished her song. In the cloak room, we saw two mini-acts (the tap dancers and the sideshow freak Captain Frodo) and also enjoyed a complementary tequila punch! They then led us out another secret door and to the show room just in time for the 10pm canto.

After the show, we went back to the bar to wait out the transition for the 12:00am show. We purchased another set of drinks and after sitting at the bar for a few minutes, the same woman approached us and asked if we'd like to visit the Study. Through another set of doors, we were led into another large room with a bar and a sideshow with the Dragon and his dog Mr. Piffles was taking place. Apparently, there is one cocktail special to this room (Down the Rabbit Hole) which we didn't get to experience. But the Dragon asked me to check behind a mirror in the wall and his chihuaha Mr. Piffles was behind it. He told me to get him, but didn't give me more direction... when I asked, he said hang on to him... :) so I got to hold cute Mr. Piffels and then I passed him on to another patron for a bit until staff retrieved him.

All in all, a lovely/exciting experience. My partner and I were trying to discern how you got ""selected"" to visit the other rooms... it definitely seemed like they were picking pairs of two, and since both of our times we'd just purchased a drink... my partner said ""you have to pay to play!"".

Which may not be wrong... during our stay in the study, there was an ""auction"" for a stale croissant... and a woman bid $55 which she actually paid! they took her into a back room and apparently did a strip tease!

At 12:30a, we left the Study and realized the main bar/restaurant were mostly empty and a whole new crowd had taken over the show room with the club. Some of the original patrons were still dancing, but it definitely seemed like an entirely new crowd.

If you can still get the Living Social deal, do it. I'd def recommend going early to get your tickets (which have assigned seats). We arrived back at about 9:25pm (no line, but escorted into main bar).",Vj6LEuuEvwxxp1O2ZS5xyg,5,1,4,xypIh8lZSrTSgUXjaxLBRg

I don't know the last time I've seen a Tap dancer at the level of Fred Astaire (think White Christmas) but here, I did! Outstanding talent, good variety of music, breaks between sets so you can mingle & chat. The set up & timing of everything is well thought out. 

After seeing the outrageously beautiful images of their dishes & learning its dinner with a show, I thought this would be a fun experience. They also feature some of my husband's/my favorite things: pork belly, caviar, scallops, octopus, crab, beef Wellington, & for the person with a giant sweet tooth, incredible dessert options. We opted for the chocolate terrarium. I requested a table in the lively room based on the reviews & they delivered. 

I'll keep this brief because it's an experience & it won't suit every taste but we did have a ball in addition to a fantastic meal. It's a fun night! 
Not a single dish disappointed, & I think my favorite was the crab Louie. Another highlight was the shrimp cocktail with the lime foam- intriguing & delicious. I'm a sucker for bell jars so the unique presentation is fun. 

Few eh comments:
- busser was efficient & refilled our waters promptly but seemed disinterested & disregarded multiple requests 
- the menus were paper with sealing wax; I'm old fashion so I love that detail but my husband's trifold had two rips up along the folded edge- it was coming apart. I hoped he had't noticed but he did & we switched menus. In my book those little details go a long way to make an experience 
- I encouraged my husband to order the tasting menu but that required we'd both need to order it, this was not stated on the menu. I can't eat a 3,4,5,6,7 course meal. That was disappointing.
We opted to build our own which worked fine but I'd have rather known in advance & not hyped that item while reviewing the menu together. 

Dishes are small, flavors are bold & rich. 

Crab Louie - 10
Shrimp cocktail - 7
Pork belly - 10 (per my hubs)
Scallop - 10 (melt in your mouth)

On a recent visit, when my first time friends asked to explain what kind of stuff went on a couple of years back, I kind of blew my own mind rattling off the random shit my wife and I had seen.  From Piff the Magic Dragon's Vegas debut to the guy that could fit his whole body through tennis rackets to the grumpy female custodian that would sweep the floors all night until 1am where she then randomly stripped off all her clothes save for panties and pasties to start dancing like a maniac.  How exactly was that role worded in the job description?

I've been pretty averse to going back since Spiegelworld and Vegas Nocturne left the building and took all their toys with them over a year ago.  I feel grateful to had seen what I did for the brief time it was around.  That's not to say it's a bad time in its current incarnation, there's still an entertaining evening to be had.  But an exciting venture down a rabbit hole it is not.  This is a cool restaurant with great acts of song and dance between tasty bites and a solid cocktail menu.

The food has gone pretty much unchanged since they opened, which is totally fine with me. It's still creative, delicious and very fitting with the modern supper club vibe.  Caviar flatbread topped with bacon and thyme was an excellent way to start the meal.  Salty and rich, just like the singer who planted a big kiss on my cheek as she commented on my choice of hairstyle.

The seared foie gras and plum mostarda went nicely in that fatty and fruity way.  Duck confit pasta with its wonderful pieces of fowl and light parmesan cream sauce would definitely be something I would get again.  Our group also enjoyed the ""modern"" beef stroganoff, the perfectly grilled Hokkaido sea scallops, and the crazy ""Chocolate Terrarium"" dessert.

Tip: Make a reservation on the 45min mark to catch the entertainment at the right time.  They typically start on the hour (starting at 7pm) and take a break after 40min of performing.

The food is also a form of entertainment, with unique plates and great presentation.  Don't be surprised if you food comes on an ornate plate or your sauce is in a chicken foot.  Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is known for their Beef Wellington and Chocolate Terrarium (again, great food presentation).

Another tip for desert... the Campfire Smores is a great desert but the smoke can be a bit much and overwhelm the chocolate (tasting charcoal/smoke in every bite isn't that great), but you can ask for the desert without the smoke.  You've been warned :)

Ordered:
Ancient Grain
Smoked Beet Salad
Argentinian Empanadas (2 orders)

Dress code says upscale, but staff informed that nice jeans and tops were okay (I saw some people dressed more casually, so I think the dress code is a suggestion). 

Food was AMAZING! I read a lot about portion size being very small, so I ordered an appetizer, two sides, and one larger plate....it was way too much food! I could have done without one side/veggie and probably no appetizer, but it was all delicious.

Desert was shared among the table: banana's foster (or some version of it) and the terrarium desert (delicious and artistic!)

Entertainment was also great. That night they had two different lounge singers, one tap dance, one break dancer, and one dancer doing to robot. They alternated after every 2-3 songs/dances. They took only short breaks, so the entertainment was pretty consistent the entire time.

OVERALL: there are a LOT of issues that need to be worked out to make this place worth going to again. The biggest for me is that if you are trying to create a unique space, then the vision has to be clear and EVERYBODY has to understand it and be a part of it. Otherwise its just a mediocre show and expensive drinks with crappy music. 

//-- BREAKDOWN --//

Ambiance/Setup: The concept was supposed to be a mansion party with nooks and crannies to disappear into but the layout was four parallel rooms right next to one another with small doors creating flow issues.  The interior layout creates massive traffic jams with no large gathering areas that were away from necessary access points. There were lines outside waiting to get in to the show that you also had to wait in just to access the bar. None of the ushers/bouncers/people standing around with headsets and clipboards knew what was going on and seemed confused themselves. After the early show,  they have to stop letting people in because they don't have enough room for the capacity of people they let in.  Chatting up the ushers/bouncers and asking them to describe the space, nobody could generate a clear answer nor say why they were holding people outside. 

Restaurant: Did not eat there, but have heard from many people that the food is really good. 

Bar: A couple days after I checked my bank account and noticed several charges to my account from RRL. one was refunded, but still got charged for somebody else's drinks. Also, I ordered the same drink from a couple different bartenders and got charged different prices, $20 for a Jameson and ginger-ale was one of them. 

Show: Typical Speigle production, similar to Absinthe in the way tries to be a ""non-show"" show. However the acts were only OK and there was no chemistry amongst the cast to create something cohesive. I really enjoyed the seating though, it was nice to be able to put your drink down and stretch out a little. Most notable was the tap dancing, these guys were pretty rockin. 

Club: after the 12am show, the stage is removed partially and the show room becomes a club. The music was REALLY bad even though the hot, faux dreadlocks dj looked like she was plucked from a Berlin underground metal rave, she was playing generic clubby pop. Once again, just not cohesive with the feeling they were trying to create, something a little more daring for the music choices would have gone a long way to sell the space as different.",3EPBhYWMcglaqhJYgcofHg,7,1,2,P7IUYjJHxbwIrvClvCROQw

The performers were amazing, people stayed until closing to watch the singers and you could tell everyone just loves what they do there, the energy is great.

Located on the 2nd level inside the Cosmopolitan hotel right next to Wicked Spoon, you will find this little gem. Want to pay club prices for drinks but don't want to get your foot stepped on like inside a club? Come here! Prior to coming, I thought this place is a tapas restaurant. It is not. It is more like a tasting menu and it's pricey. But hey, it's Vegas. We weren't full from the food at all but the entertainment was fun. If you are looking for an experience, come here because this was one of the coolest dinner experiences I've ever had. But if you want something that's a bang for your buck, look elsewhere.

We had reservations at 6:30pm. I reserved via OpenTable and requested a table near the band. They sat us at a table where the band was right behind me! So cool. But the entertainers do move around the room so you'll be able to see the different acts. Show starts at 7pm and gets livelier as the night goes on.

Boyfriend got an Old Fashioned and I got some sort of whiskey drink, forgot the name. Each drink was at least $15.
Caviar Taco 5/5 - So good, but oh so little. I swear I could eat like 40 of these. When the dish came out I thought it was a JOKE. At $15 a pop they are not cheap.
Wagyu steak tartare 4/5 - Tasty
Short rib stroganoff 3/5 - The meat was very tender but it lacked flavor. I did enjoy the semolina sheet on top along with the mushrooms
Brussel sprouts 3/5 - Good. It has a hint of sweetness since it was glazed but I quickly got sick of it.
Chocolate terrarium 4/5 - Probably the biggest order we had our whole dinner. It was more for the display. It will make all you chocolate lovers happy. Chocolate pudding.. cake.. krispy.. tuile.. all with hazelnut ice cream. Worth to get it and share. My boyfriend and I struggled to finish this. Chocolate waaaaastedddddddddd.

What a nice change to the #vegas scene. A throwback place with a cool #bar scene with live piano bar music. It's sad but it's something I usually only experienced through movies. It was sexy and cool. Great cocktails and a nice vibe. Not sure if the concept will work, but I hope it does.

  Rose.Rabbit.Lie is very unique restaurant, 1 of the most exciting on the Strip, serving delicious food, strong cocktails,  interactive shows, fascinating, and I didn't know what to expect. Late night dining with reinvented social club.

    Expect the unexpected, shows through out the dinner. You can laugh and it's truly Vegas style. It's grand, and it's surely delivered. 

     This time I got to chat with chef Wesley Holton, who formerly worked at Daniel in New York, then Daniel Boulud's DB Brasserie at Wynn Las Vegas as well as The Water Club and Michael Mina's Seablue at the Borgata in Atlantic City, helms the kitchen. 

   The food was on point, we love everything. 

- Scallops were so good with black truffles, OK everything truffles are good in my book :-)

- The bone marrow, a MUST ORDER!

- Rabbit Fricassée, Vichy Carrots, Rose Petals, Beech Mushrooms à la Grecque, Sauce Zingara, MUST TRY.

- Wagyu Steak Frites, Sauce Choron, Tempura Potatoes, Wilted Spinach was quite tasty. 

- Crispy Chicken, Potato & Scallion Pureé, Black Truffle, yes truffle!

- Florida Frog Leg, Pickled Fava Bean, Cilantro-Lime Chimichurri, unexpected but was quite nice.

- Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly, Fava Bean, Bacon Consommé, Preserved Ramps, ORDER IT!

- Beef Wellington, Prime Tenderloin, Puff Pastry Atrium, Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Creamed Spinach, Roasted Maitake, Black Truffle. This is a GIGANTIC plate, will feed a whole table ;-) so much flavor, layer to layer of goodness gracious! 

- Amazing caviar selection here, from California Sturgeon to Russian Osetra, to Siberian Osetra, to Hackleback, you only live once, so order it :-)

   The wine list was equally delicious here. 

- Shafer Hillside Select 2009 Stagleap Napa Valley $600 per bottle

- 1995 Chateau Latour Bordeaux $2,500 

- Krug Champagne baby, when you go Krug, it's difficult for you to go back :-) 

  Our group got so much fun, we got up and danced with the performers. You won't be able to talk to each other much because it was loud.  However, our group, my clients, love every bit of it. 

    Our waitress and the sommelier were both wonderful on JAN 8th, 2015. I'm looking forward to return soon. THANK YOU chef Wes Holton for an amazing dinner. 

    Rose.Rabbit.Lie is something NEW and UNEXPECTED for you to try out. Still 1 of the hottest shows in Las Vegas now and 1 of my favorite.",JADdo9NEeO5Az9aOYbyvZA,11,9,5,06JUfYSoN809z_cenjC8sw
5645335,2014-02-05,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"My husband and I were in Vegas last weekend and had heard about this new restaurant inside the Cosmopolitan.  The restaurant was a unique experience and the food was excellent.  The wait staff was very attentive and accommodating.  We bought tickets to their 10pm show ""Nocturne"", and that was a disappointment for the amount of money we paid for the tickets.  But the restaurant gets 5 stars!!  Next time we will do dinner and skip the show.  Highly recommended if you like the tapas style restaurant.  It gives you a chance to try many small portions of food.  Our waiter suggested the Brussel Sprouts, which neither of us had ever tried before and they were delicious!  Highly recommended this restaurant!",Dj_u9F3sKwlhR5u7SCw-Rg,3,2,5,xLRGRiY9F4d9U01yUtwYLQ
5652656,2014-01-19,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Rose. Rabbit. Lie is spectacular!  Thank you to the inspired minds to recognize that it was time to think of something special. This concept could hold its own anywhere in the world but it is right where it should be!  

For anyone looking to dare to truly enjoy the night this is the only place to go. For someone looking for an unforgettable dining experience with a staff that is friendly, funny and a true attention to detail Rose. Rabbit. Lie will exceed your expectations. 

If you are looking to experience a cocktail that is worth remembering Rose. Rabbit. Lie takes it to a place that is not only outside the box, they built a new box!  From the true professionals behind the multiple bars, to the custom glassware ( that spin!) and hand carved ice, it is in a class of its own!  

Now for the entertainment. Vegas Nocturne is anything but run of the mill. There are 3 distinct ""Cantos"" that unfold as the night evolves. Each one is unique and moments from each canto can happen anywhere inside Rose. Rabbit. Lie. It is awe inspiring, unique and cool!

Thank You Rose. Rabbit. Lie for changing the game!  Many places claim to have something for everyone. Rose. Rabbit. Lie is the only place that does. You are one of a kind and that is something that takes so many things to come together it is flummoxing if one was to sit down and really think about it!",GjVAyY5axHFdHLnRNgC3PQ,4,3,5,_T7dWYVCJaJ_npLG33SQmA
5654835,2015-06-05,5,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?

First of all they eliminated the spinning cocktail glasses.  All of them.  Imagine the look on my face when the bartender in the 'study' informed me they would not be returning.  Ever.  Those were my only reason for getting a cocktail as I'm not a big drinker to begin with, at all.

Secondly, the menu has changed, dramatically.  No more brussel sprouts with crispy chicken skin.  I was told that was a seasonal item.  Funny how I had them in June, July and November of last year.  Pretty sure it is June today as well.  

No more fried chicken either.

No more braised pork belly.

No more morel spaghetti.

Instead I had a $12 Fingerling Potato Poutine, which was a bunch of mushy potato wedges covered in creme fraiche, on top of braised short ribs.  Fail.

Glazed English Peas $12 with almost no bacon visible on 3 little pieces of romaine.  It was tasteless and boring and the peas went everywhere.  For some reason it was very hard to eat.  Fail.

White Asparagus $18, literally 1 piece of asparagus on a bed of hazelnut pesto and 2 pieces of wood sorrel.  Better than the peas, but still obscene for the price point.  HUGE fail.

Jamison Farm Lamb Saddle $24.  I didn't try but the brother and the husband said it was good.

Short Rib Stroganoff $38, my only familiar dish on the menu... can't go wrong with that one.  Fork tender, consistent to the other 5 or 6 times I've been here.


Okay, so besides the obvious decline in food quality and the change in menu, how can this restaurant go from 5 stars in my eyes down to 1?  The staff and ambience.  The service was ridiculous.  We were talking, a lot.  We weren't eating quickly and before we could finish a plate people would come by, ask if we were done then take the plate away before we could say anything.  TWICE I said ""No, thank you.""  To which they would reply ""You're welcome..."" and there goes the rest of my peas... the rest of my asparagus, the rest of my fucking short ribs.

The acts were the band and 1 singer.  We were there from 8-11 between the bar and the dinner.  There were no dancers, no tap dancers, no burlesque ladies, no nothing.  Just a band ( a good band) and 1 lady singing her poor heart out (she's fantastic) but that was it.  I had sold the idea of this wonderful menagerie of wonder at dinner to my brother and he kept asking when the acts were going to come out.  They never did.  I know the show (Nocturne) has been canceled for some time but part of the charm of the restaurant was that they continued to have rotating acts which made dinner very interesting.

The food is no longer a draw.  There is not really a variety show to speak of anymore.  I guess I can just remember what it was like when it was awesome because now it is just abysmal.  It breaks my heart to say this, because this WAS my favorite place to eat in vegas, but save your money and go somewhere else.  It's just not worth it.",ig5IJbIuq-gopoPIEUlm1w,10,5,1,nMIakEJ30V_MC-DDjzGkCw

For my main I had the halibut with the butterfly pea tea broth. It was so cool to see the purple broth and everything was cooked to perfection. I have to say the best thing of our meal was that chocolate terrarium!! I wanted to face plant into heir homemade marshmallow they had piped on to.

5667664,2014-11-04,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I cannot even begin to express how much I enjoyed Rose. Rabbit. Lie.!  I've been to Vegas many times, but this is so far, the best experience I've had in Vegas. Spent five days in Vegas a couple weeks back and decided to have a fancy date night on our first night in the city. I had heard from a friend that this place was supposedly ""really good"". Thought this would be a great place to kick off our Vegas vacation. 

Had reservations at 9pm, but when we got there, our table wasn't ready. We were escorted to a lounge that resembled a mini library while we waited for our table, which we didn't really mind because we had wanted to get pre-dinner drinks anyways. As the door for the lounge opened, another door leading to the main dining room opened up and it felt like a different world hidden behind the door. Definitely got me excited for our dinner. 

The lounge was quiet compared to the door we had just walked by. It definitely had a Great Gatsby feel. We tried Airmail and El Diablo, both delicious, but I enjoyed Airmail more. Once we finished our drinks, we were escorted into the main dining room. Decor was great and I loved the lighting in the restaurant. As soon as we sat down, a band started to play. I was sitting back to back with the band with a partition between us. As the music started to play, I said how awesome that there was a band in the other room, and then as I said that the partition started to go down and I was watching the band from behind. It was really cool that the partition goes down, because then even in our part of the restaurant, we could watch the entertainment as well. The band was great, so was the kid that was tap dancing on the piano. 

Now let's get to the good part -- the food!

Rose. Rabbit. Lie was a great place for us because we are small plates type of eaters. We love food so when given the opportunity to try a number of dishes, we are happy. 

Started off with the gougeres, which is like a soft biscuit filled with truffle mornay sauce. That was good, but not the greatest thing. We also got the oysters on the half shell. Four oysters with a trio of sauces -- cognac cocktail sauce, mignonette, and horseradish sorbet. Used all three and the combination was amazing. Oysters were really fresh too! We also got the Heavenly Eggs, which I had seen on the menu, but didn't seem too exciting. However, our amazing server convinced us to try these and I am SO glad he did! Rather pricey at $6 each for a small piece of egg custard with black truffle. But OMG! So delicious! If you come to Rose. Rabbit. Lie, you HAVE to order this. Something different for sure but you won't regret it. We almost got another order. 

After that, we moved on to the brussel sprouts, which has crispy chicken skin, manchego, and paprika. They were good, but I think next time I will order a new dish to try in its place. Got the bone marrow, which was really good as well! Also ordered the duck confit pasta, and I would definitely order this again. Sometimes pasta with a cream sauce can leave me feeling heavy and full, but not this. A smaller serving of pasta than usual, but then again we were sharing everything. I might have to get my own order next time :P We ended our meal with small chocolate truffles served on ice for dessert and those were good too, really smooth and not too sweet.

If you're looking for something different to do in Vegas, I highly recommend going to Rose. Rabbit. Lie. I wouldn't recommend it for a first date since it does get loud in there, making it hard to talk. But the ambiance and live entertainment is great, food and its presentation is amazing, service is wonderful, and it's just such a fun experience! I will definitely be going back.",MC10XA8UJqmfIZq1tguy9A,0,0,5,LQ3Wig6on5g09jOlYHxneQ
5674395,2014-10-29,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Wow, review #600!  And I seriously thought that I already wrote my review of Rose.Rabbit.Lie - oh well, here it goes!

Overall, it was a great experience.  We dined on a Tuesday night and I was surprised to see how busy it was inside!  The restaurant was a bit difficult to find and is a very odd location (near the buffet), so keep that in mind when visiting.  It's a trek!

It's a shame that they couldn't keep the Vegas Nocturne thing going, because it's a wonderful concept!  Although the performers we experienced were good, they weren't particularly great.  I didn't feel like we were seeing anything we wouldn't see if we came back the next night.  But still, this is a unique dining experience in Vegas and I certainly suggest visiting if you get the chance.

It's all small plates, meant to be shared.  There were 2 of us and I feel like we got a great taste of the menu.  We started with the herb brioche rolls.  While good, I think I would skip these next time.  I also found it strange that there were 3 of them, but 2 of us.  In no particular order, we also tried the following:

Poached Asparagus ($16): Fried Egg, Warm Bacon Vinaigrette, Herb Salad.  I absolutely love asparagus and it would be hard to screw this up. They didn't - it was delicious!

Crispy Calamari ($16):  Lemongrass, Green Curry, Charred Eggplant.  This wasn't my favorite. The combo of the curry and lemongrass was not what I was expecting.

Wagyu Steak Frites ($28):  Sauce Choron, Tempura Potatoes, Wilted Spinach. Pretty darn delicious!  The tempura potatoes are large (there are only 2), so don't be surprised when they come out and you were expecting french fries. :)

Short Rib Stroganoff ($22):  Herb Pasta, Roasted Maitake Mushroom.  Really good!  We already knew we were going to order this and it came highly recommended by our server as well.  Definitely didn't disappoint!

Cherries Jubilee: I don't remember the exact price, but it was expensive!  We figured that we only live once and it would be awesome to have our dessert made tableside.  They have a roving cart and make the cherries jubilee and the bananas foster at your table.  Although pricey, it was worth every penny - especially if you are in a group.  There was plenty of dessert for everyone and it was REALLY good!

This could easily be a 5 star review, however I found our service to be lacking and also our table was VERY uncomfortable.  We were seated at a high 2 top, separated from the bar by a screen.  I felt like we were on top of the people next to us (we were in the middle).  Our server had to stand behind me to take our order or deliver food.  Although it was a busy night, I don't think it was so busy that we all had to be crammed together!  Also, while everyone else received a large bottle of water for their table, we didn't.  We asked a few times for refills and then finally just asked for our own bottle, which took forever to get.

Overall, it was an amazing experience, and as I previously mentioned, one of a kind.  If you are looking for something different while in Vegas, this is a great option!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,5,1,4,nN_KOWxQ2GJ6-zV11iwZXQ
5677358,2014-01-23,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Definitely the social experiment it claims to be.

Like a sequel to Alice and Wonderland we entered into a rabbit hole entrance with seven or eight differnt doors leading to undisclosed locations. We went into one of the bars and grabbed a drink. All of a sudden secret panels opened up revealing a back stage dining room with two ladies diving in and out of a huge martini glass filled with water. After the secret panels went back into place a band started to play and a secret suitcase was placed on top of the piano, it started to move and dance about. Then time for the show.

Full of suprises,extreme talent and adult humor the show mimics the style of Absinthe but in a more personal, intimate setting. There are three showings per night and each one is supposed to be different. We saw the one at 10pm and we will definitely go back and highly recommend it.",cc6XcRAXcPkAW9C15VvBmg,2,2,5,Fo_QKNaVHtrm5Eta5Xci1Q

But the idea of having a show and a cool restaurant/bar worked really well for us. The club scene can get old and the restaurant and a show typical evening in Vegas is nice but every now and then you may need something a bit different, so this was a good change for us. 
But by reading the most recent reviews, I'm not sure if they are still offering the shows. I would still visit this place for its atmosphere though.",yyNfwGyg2_ZN_Qsl9kkR3Q,1,2,4,HdOn9xBhBcC-RhmXpdJIHQ
5707132,2017-09-11,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Overall I had a great time at Rose. Rabbit. Lie. 

The food was 3 stars for me but the entertainment, atmosphere, drinks & service made me bump up my review up to 4 stars. 

The food for the price was just ok for me. It was a solid 3. I went with a group of 9 people so we got to try a lot off the menu. 

Get: Brussel Sprouts, Beef Tartare, Octopus, Mussels, Crab Louie

Pass: Caviar Taco, Bone In Ribeye, Porkchops, Shrimp Scampi, Short Rib Stroganoff, Duck Confit Pasta, Spring Pea Pasta

Dessert: The presentation for the 2 desserts we got were amazing. The taste pretty good. But it was huge and expensive. Worth a try if you go w a big group but not worth it if you go with a date. The amount of dessert kind of became overwhelming at the end. We got the Chocolate Terranium ($35) & Bananas Foster ($53)

The drinks were very good! I loved my drink,  Through the Looking Glass! Presentation was amazing and I loved how it was lightly sweet! Enjoyed the whole thing! Their famous Femme Fatale was pretty amazing too!

The atmosphere and entertainment was so fun! I loved all the performers, from the singing, band, piano, tap dancers and break dancers! Very cool! Plus the performers interact with the customers which is really fun!

The service was amazing! No complaints!

I would rather come here to sit at the bar, order a drink & grab an appetizer and hang out watching the entertainment rather than to have a full on dinner. 

Overall a 4 star experience... just wished the food tasted better for the price.",IKi5cCvrzNqF1RqqXQ5E3Q,2,2,4,bN33xx-SGGQ5-VT574imBQ

I really love the concepts of the place. Your eyes and ears will always be looking or hearing great things. (However, we heard more and the only good looking thing we saw was our waitress) My friend was able to get a reservation for 9 for a table of 5. We were seated more in the back of the restaurant. This was a horrible location. We were not able to see any acts. There was a  stage near us but they never open it. I'm not sure what we suppose to do here or do we get up and go to another room. 

I got to try the Belgian endive, black truffle salad, glazed brussels sprouts, and 20 oz bone-in ribeye. Both salads were okay. I really enjoyed the brussels sprouts. The ribeye was not good. I didn't enjoy it at all. I wouldn't come back here to eat. The only plus is the presentation is really nice here.

We were with 2 other couples & everyone loved the food: appetizers, dinners & dessert. Nothing was worth avoiding. One of the wives was a little apprehensive about the menu but ended up loving everything she ordered! 

ALERT: If you are a foodie, you will love the flavors! If you are used to chain restaurants and simple menu/flavors, come to the bar for the drinks & show! Not a bad thing, I think that explains the low reviews for the food. 

EXPERIENCE: This place = a MUST for your Vegas trip. Sometimes restaurants get lost in Vegas because its competitive & the list is loooong. Move Rose.Rabbit.Lie to the top of your list (we found out about it from someone we shared a cab with the year before) 

SERVICE: outstanding. Attentive. Consistently good from beginning to end. 

CONFESSION: Even the details on the plates and silverware were gorgeous. I'm not gonna lie, I thought about gathering up all of the silverware and putting it in my purse (not really, but my filipino auntie's would have!) Tita Norma for sure!

FOOD: Everything was great. We ordered appetizers, entrees and the cookie jar. The cookie jar was the only thing big enough to share. Everything else was too delicious to pass around!

Experience: Unforgettable and worth seeking out! I was looking up the singer on Youtube afterwards and trying to find her music. 

Drinks: Prohihibition inspired cocktails. Had to order another because it was so good!!! 

Entertainers: singers gave me goosebumps with the notes the belted out! Transported me back to another era. Tap dancing. Break dancing. Ohhhh my.

When my friend and I were walking around the Cosmopolitan, a promoter gave us passes for the midnight show. My friend was too tired to go so I went alone.

But after a break from the band, we were able to settle in and talk and eat and drink, and then when the next set started, with an incredible soul singer and dancer, we were fully onboard.  

The menu is a lot more complex than you'd expect from the atmosphere.  The drinks were a little too methodical and overpowering, but they did the job.  The wine list is very good and complimented the food well.  Lots of dishes with egg or caviar, and they are all spectacular.

It was dimly lit and had little corners you could sit and chat with friends or a date. I also loved the fact that you could sift between a handful of records and play what you wanted. I thought the records seemed like some of them had seen better days, but that's probably because people could mess with them all they wanted. Still a very cool feature! 

While my negroni was good, it had a touch too much compari in it. As I drink them more and more, I definitely recognize the delicate balance between compari, gin and vermouth. I still feel confident if I would have ordered another drink, it would have been decent too. 

We tried to go into the restaurant side, because there was a very talented lounge singer belting out the tunes, but it smelled VERY fishy. Like overpowering. I was pretty bummed because it would have been fun to watch and listen with a cocktail.

5757745,2014-01-23,9,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I'm going to start with 4 stars based on my night in the Rose.Rabbit.Lie study. I did not eat, nor did I see the show. I had read the vague descriptions of this place before I headed to Vegas in January but it was almost too mysterious to sway me from my usual cocktail haunts. If it were not for two trusted sources, Max Solano of Delmonico and JR Starkus from Southern Spirits I probably would have passed. I am glad I decided to go.

I am going clear up something that I was confused about before I went. You CAN go to this club without buying a ticket for the show.

I had already made a couple of stops the night I ended up in The Study and was feeling pretty good. I was told to ask for June and indeed she was working and when I say working I mean WORKING. This young lady was mixing three and four different craft cocktails at the same time without missing a beat. Her focus was intense and she is obviously into her craft.

I sat and watched her make a few cocktails as I perused the menu, deciding what to order. The cocktail menu is pretty diverse with some very unique options. I chose to let June pick my drink. I picked gin as my spirit to which she queried ""boozy or light?"". I chose boozy. I got what I asked for. I chose poorly. I needed something light. I drank the booze heavy cocktail while chatting with the hipsters on either side of me and we took turns picking records off the book shelf to play on the turntable.

After finishing the first cocktail, which was hard to discern much flavor from, I asked June for something along the same flavor profile but with less booze. I chose wisely. This was a great cocktail. Nothing too fancy but well balanced and a safe pick for June as we didn't know each other that well. 

For my third cocktail I left it up to June. I asked her to make me something she was proud of that was hers. She came back with what  she called ""Heavens to Budapest"". While I can tell you that all the ingredients in the cocktail came from Hungary, due to my state at the time of consumption, the only ingredient I can be sure of is the paprika dusting on top. I remember this distinctly because it made the cocktail. I would take a sip without inhaling and it was just a mediocre drink at best, but by allowing the aromatic paprika do it's job it changed the profile of the drink completely.

Heavens to Budapest is not just a cocktail, it's an experience. It makes you stop and think and really appreciate the art of the cocktail.

RRL provides a dining experience unlike any other! Excellent decor, Grammy-grade entertainment and delicious food. How can you go wrong with that? 

TIP: If you're not hungry, RRL is still an ideal place to grab a drink before you hit the town. If you're looking to impress your girl, take her here. 

LOCATION: Finding RRL isn't entirely easy, and I think they did it on purpose - probably to add some mystery or secrecy. Also, when you finally arrive, you'll quickly understand why they have it nestled in some random wing of The Cosmo. If you're having trouble locating it, just ask any hotel staff member and they'll point you in the right direction. 

ENTERTAINMENT: The live singers are, without a doubt, some of the best singers AND performers I've ever witnessed live. Putting their own twist on major hits throughout the last several decades, the band never disappointed. Never. 

FOOD: 

Herb Brioche Rolls ~ 4 stars
Potato Gratin ~ 4 stars
Glazed Brussels Sprouts ~ 4 stars
Steak Frites ~ 4 stars
Short Rib Stroganoff ~ 5 stars ~ A MUST
Duck Confit Pasta ~ 5 stars ~ A MUST

EVERYTHING we had was delicious. Seasoned perfectly. Cooked perfectly. However, where RRL hits it right on the nail is in the pasta department. The stroganoff and duck confit pasta were out of this world. My only regret was not doubling up on those orders. The short rib in the stroganoff was succulent, deep flavored and dangerously addicting. The duck confit was seasoned a bit aggressively but necessary because when paired with the handmade pasta, it was nothing short of spectacular. 

Rose. Rabit. Lie. is awesome. Don't just expect a dining experience. It's an experience that will tingle ALL your senses. Have fun.",CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A,9,5,4,qdcUFJjT8MWGe33Z1HtC8Q

Food: All the food we tasted was good except for the tasteless beef stroganoff. Just stay away from that. The teeny tiny caviar tacos are too cute to pass up. The empanadas were sooo freaking good that we ordered a second round. They come with an amazing chimicurri sauce that I wanted to bottle up and sneak out in my purse. Duck confit pasta was a bowl of yummy creaminess. Hard to go wrong with scallops which were seared perfectly but the accompanied roasted veggies were kinda lame.  Side of corn was decent but too charred and tasted burnt.The smores desert was drool on the table good! Moscow mules were legit. 

Service: Just alright. Our waiter just seemed really rushed and we had to twist his arm for recommendations. The rest of the wait staff was very polite. 

Atmosphere: I wanted to dine here specifically for the entertainment. Food's very good and super creative but not the bestest you'll taste in town. All the entertainment was happening in one room for most of the night and we dined in the next one and had partial view of the band. I suppose try getting a table in the right room so you don't have to stretch your neck like an ostrich the entire time. A tap dancer did tap his way all across the restaurant and gave every one a good show.

The vibe/atmosphere was posh while avoiding arrogance, and depending on the night, piano bar music and/or live musicians belting out well-performed and choice tunes.  Amazing food, extensive drink list, and believe me when I say that the entire experience was first-rate. Our dinner choices/tastings consisted of the Wagyu Steak Tartare, Glazed Brussels Sprouts, Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, and the Campfire S'mores, to name a few.

I came here when I was on my bachelor party and this was probably my favorite place during my stay. I didn't know where we were going but this is located pretty deep in the Cosmopolitan - it's a decent walk all the way to the restaurant itself. I recommend making a reservation in advance as I can see this place being a full house every night. 

I forget everything we ordered (we ordered a lot) but I remember:
Caviar Taco (I didn't try but my friend did - the smallest taco, with a crapload of caviar)
Fingerling Potato Poutine (probably my favorite)
Short Rib Stroganoff
Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon
Lamb Chop (don't remember name...)
Pasta (don't remember name...)
Friend ordered something (don't even remember what he ordered)

As you can see my memory was a bit hazy. However, I remember when I walked in, there was a live band playing, relatively loudly (or maybe I just thought they were heh), but were very good. There were a couple of performers, be it singers, tap dancers, dancers, and some even came out and interacted with some of the dining guests. I can't opine too much on the food, except that it was rather tasty and don't remember not really disliking anything. Pricing wise it's reasonable for the entire package you're getting.

I've always heard the phrase, ""oh a dinner and a show!"" This is actually a dinner and a show. Really top notch food, great ambiance, good entertainment and overall a good time. If you're in Vegas, make sure you stop by here. It's a different experience that you may not get outside of this city (maybe in New York but I haven't been to one, yet).",rEzmGVbanakQ3IW9tJBWsA,4,2,5,smWLwjKmTJB3iDpwnIwWOQ
5876861,2014-03-16,1,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Rose.Rabbit.Lie was a delightfully awesome show. Created by the same producers as Absinthe they calmed down the crazily offensive humour and ripping on the audience that was the main course of Absinthe and made it what it should be all about themselves. They still involve the audience a little but its much much calmer.

The room is also much more comfortable, its inside and you don't spend half the night staring up into the spotlights. The acts/performances were great. They mixed in some funny jokes and misdirection to pull your attention away from the stage between sets. I thought it was well done.

The start of the show was out in the bar area and it was a crazy confusing and well done performance from a Janelle Mona dopleganger. The lady could sing and I missed about 8 minutes of the fiasco going on around me as I tried  to determine if she was an impersonator or the actual celebrity.

This place takes the speak-easy theme up a million notches - if you can find it. Which you think would be easy since it's in a major Las Vegas hotel (the Cosmo), but it's actually kind of a trek to get to it. At one point, while walking through the hotel to find it, we stopped, took our shoes off, and sat for awhile because our feet hurt. 
With shoes back on, we walked up to the main hostess stand of the restaurant. We were directed through a nondescript side door that you enter...the study???... the lounge??? I'm not sure what it's called but it was decorated with antiques, low lighting, book cases line the wall, and a few small tables for guests. I felt like an explorer who found the new world! The drinks were certainly dated back to new world exploration with recipes dating back to the 1800's; this is way better then your average Moscow Mule!
Drinks in hand, we decided to explore and headed through the dining room, to another back bar/dining room, and then then the DJ/dance floor space. My friend was swooning over all the male bartenders wearing suspenders, pinstripes, and bow ties- it was like an old fashion saloon. They really keep with the theme throughout.

Prices are a little high for what you get and it was nothing out of the ordinary. My fiance and I ate there on a Thursday night and all the tables were filled so I had quite the expectations. 

We ordered the caviar flat bread and that was meh. The raw egg we were supposed to 'spread' was just too heavy. It felt as if the egg was hogging the show when the caviar should be the star. The brioche and butter was nothing special. The inside was cold and the outside was warm so that was meh. 

If there was one saving grace, it probably would've been the beef stroganoff as it was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Don't expect your typical beef stroganoff as I was expecting it to be a pasta dish. It is but not really. We also ordered the lobster cocktail expecting it to be a little more fresh but even that was meh.

All the staff on site were helpful and nice. Our water was never below half and our server was very, very passionate about the foods on the menu. He would make our expectations go out the roof and then we did try it, once again - 'meh.'  

Skip out on the dessert. You're on the Strip! Go spend that $50 on something better and tastier. We ordered the chocolate terrarium and gave the meh face once again.

We had reservations.  From the looks of things, we would not have had a problem getting in without.  Loved the Vegas unique feel of the juggler gal sitting on a desk near the front. (restaurants don't have that in Raleigh)  Were seated at a table for two that was not far from where the entertainment appeared.  Service was efficient and at a relaxed pace, which married with the quality. 

Note:  you can go super expensive here, or you can have a high-quality, unique experience for a not-break-the-bank price. (by Vegas standards).  We each started with a nice drink.  I did the El Diablo which was quite good.  Husband had a bourbon or whisky drink which he liked.  We each had a salad...I did the snow pea one with pancetta, pecorino and sherry vinaigrette.  Very light and refreshing.  Husband had the ""Warm Bloomsdale Spinach Salad  Grilled Shiitakes, Goat Cheese, Marcona Almonds, Soy Dressing"".  He liked it very much.  

We also started with the incredible Gougeres.  YUM!  Rolls/ savory cream puffs with oozing cheese...sigh!

I then had to try the Duck Confit Pasta with Swiss Chard, Parmesan Cream and White Wine.  I loved it!  Rich, yet light at the same time...perfectly executed...mmmmmm!  Husband went with one of our Server's recommendations, which was the Short Rib Stroganoff.  So rich and meaty, yet light as well.  Wonderful!

Getting full, we opted for some nice French Press coffee, and needing something lighter than the infamous Chocolate Terrarium (which we did get to see, as a table near us got it...very cool!)...we went with the Butterscotch Pudding.  This might well be the most unique dessert we've ever had!  Certainly never had pudding like this.  Small balls of fluffy pudding, with a bit of a crunchy topping, vanilla caramel,  and fabulous tiny squares of candied pumpkin.  WOW!

Meanwhile, we had about a half hour of live entertainment that enhanced our meal.  There was terrific band that played 70's type R&B.   Think Al Green.  Top that off with a terrific tap dancer who danced the rhythm to a couple tunes and it was very enjoyable.  Do note that they added an ""entertainment tax"" to our bill of around $11.

while in the bar area, some of the show performers spill out and perform mini side shows which are free of charge. so sit back, relax and enjoy some awesome cocktails. shout out to April and Priscilla for taking care of us the entire night! also try some of the food! its small plates style so for a snack, we shared the short rib stroganoff and it was delicious! i would def come back for a full meal here next time. and while sitting at the bar, you may just be lucky enough to be plucked from your seat for more adventures ;)  definitely try to walk around and explore this venue. you never know who you may talk to or where you may end up like possibly as part of the paid show! haha. make sure to say hi to Piff the magic dragon and visit him in The Study for some breakfast ;) also in the study, a completely different cocktail list compared to other rooms in the venue so definitely order a drink too. a night here won't be super cheap but wouldnt you rather pay $16ish for a good, specialty cocktail than pay the same if not more at a packed nightclub for a boring vodka/cranberry?!

we were lucky enough to view the midnight show as well and its nothing short of amazing! a bit of comedy, a bit of a concert, a bit of burlesque - there's an act for everyone. and then after the midnight show, the performance space opens up to a club area with a DJ. 

me and justin b. stayed here the entire night and didnt get bored at all! we were there for a good 5+ hours and there was something different that captured our interest. the staff and the cast of characters were all so friendly, welcoming and entertaining! the various different rooms to explore offered something new and wonderful and you just never know what you'll find around each corner. i just cannot tell you how much i loved this place! the best part is that when i go back next time, i know that it'll be a completely different/new experience than i just had and that is exciting!",HO35wso-psqx0GF--QSwGA,6,4,5,TBQMiaNeTSFYhd07zpBs7A

I came here after work for dinner with coworkers another night LOL, who were also curiously allured by the studio room set near the entrance. 

We had an aesthetically pleasing, well presented culinary experience. 
We tried the Caviar Tacos, Shrimp cocktail was SO good I got it twice.. yeah the lime avocado mousse got me. Also had the Short Rib Stroganoff, alSO good, I would possibly go back for just this the meat was so flavorful and tender. We also tried this desert that comes in a glass rabbit with smoke clouds as you lift to eat!

It's like a mature Alice and Wonderland tea party, the dishes are fun  and interesting. There might be a tap dancer on the table next to you, or a singer gazing into your eyes as they hold your hand. Very swanky, elegant, romantically dim lit perfect for a date to impress and set the mood to swoon ;) Particularly if you request one of the love seat type seating booth for two as the show goes on. Lovely for dinner and a show, or to wander into after dinner for the live entertainment, music and performances 'til midnight.",NcUMNz6tAahD6mDmuKwYIA,3,1,4,fjJEfZ7xbjVXXZSHz_Kd7g
5973501,2015-10-05,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I had come previously a couple years ago when Vegas Nocturne was still showing and it was fun but I am now in love with everything about this restaurant: the food, the entertainment, the drinks, the entire opulence and swankiness of it all. 

My husband and I opted to order multiple items to share and everything was pure decadence. You have to be a pretty adventurous eater to truly appreciate the intricate menu. We ordered the following and loved every dish...
Caviar flatbread 
Black truffle salad
Seared fois gras 
Black bucatini (with uni butter)
Bone marrow 
Slow roasted octopus

Our friendly waitress helped guide us in what to select and the kitchen did an excellent job with the timing and the order that the dishes were presented. We concluded our meal with the dark chocolate sundae which was the perfect collaboration of flavors: milk chocolate mousse, orange sherbet, and salted caramel. Simple flavors but put together, a whole new level of deliciousness. 

The drinks were fantastic as well. I ordered several Moscow Mules garnished with ginger chews. The attention to detail is astounding. From the decor to the beautiful silverware and menu. The entertainment was so much fun. The live band who we were seated right next to were pure talent along with the singers, the tap dancer, and the amazing breakdancing kid. Everything about the restaurant contributed to a spectacular evening- a feast for the eyes, ears, and of course our tastebuds.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,1,0,5,fEswbyQH36ByXuW0nLBc_w
5974790,2018-06-13,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"We recently frequented RRL for a bachelorette dinner and had an incredible time. We had one small bump when we arrived as our reservation was messed up, despite confirming it a few hours beforehand. Even though we had a table for 7 confirmed, it still took 30 minutes to seat us. Once we got our table, the night went smoothly. The food was outstanding, the entertainment was incredible and our table even made friends with the house band that night. The service was just OK. We waited a long time for simple things like water - which in Vegas, you gotta have ALL the water. It seemed like everyone was in a rush because it was also EDC weekend. I will absolutely come back here in the future. It's such a fun, unique experience and it's inside the Cosmo, which is a great resort anyway.",6YYpJ59jfFCUHkGOpu2NTA,0,2,4,lz8EvIfDGfKLhTZqsuBjCg
5977699,2014-10-15,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Honestly, the best experience I've had in Vegas. Decor, food, entertainment are all top notch. I went with a large group back in January 2014 and Hali made sure we were treated like royalty. We started with dinner, and had some one of the best meals I've ever had. We were then escorted into the show room. The performances were wildly entertaining; my entire group had a blast. At the end of the show, as they were announcing the bottle service, the spotlight was suddenly shone upon me and I was presented with a complimentary bottle of champagne. They definitely know how to make a guest feel special and appreciated.",dv7wYZa9jUGhV4uZn1Lc2g,0,1,5,tJSGdOtDZ94J2RDqfjJIiA
5983861,2017-06-11,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"My wife and daughter, (+boyfriend) went to Rose Rabbit Lie for my 60 b-day.  I had been here the year before for business, but this time it was for the experience.

I had the lobster thermador and it was superb!  The sauce was creamy and the lobster was perfectly cooked.  My wife had three veggies plates (They have a separate vegetarian menu).  She loved the Brussel Sprouts, and the Gnocchi.  My daughter had the Duck Confit and the aroma was wafting over the table.  The best drink was the Shrub and Tug; with fresh Rosemary and a single large ice cube in the center of the drink.

The Entertainment came on at 7pm.  3 lounge singers, 2 dancers that would visit the table while singing.  The Tap Dancers jump up on the piano so everyone can see them.  Great views.
They also invited couples up on the dance floor for ""slow dancing and smooching"".  It was great fun.

Prices were good; we felt like we got great value.  The food was perfectly cooked and it was a daring and exciting menu.  I will go again.",lbFXkCwNzJFCfCnOH-5-jA,1,0,5,yIxnfRGB12fl3JDlcZBefg
5986731,2014-06-26,2,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Brutal show. Definitely overpriced. It's as if Spiegelworld took all the acts that weren't clever enough or cool enough for Absinthe and stuffed it into The Cosmopolitan and slapped a big price tag on it. 

My wife and I come to Vegas every year and see a bunch of shows. We've seen raunchy, sexy, daring and cool. Tonight we saw a show that tried not hard at all to be like that and we were grossly disappointed. 

We walked out after 40 minutes.",ookiUBcJIZQlQEAT2xe1GA,5,1,1,qa6G-3YI8ai801gXkaYWMg

A great band , singers with amazing voices and dancers with fantastic skills !! Other than great entertainment , the food is absolutely wonderful !!

Other than that the potato Gratin , Caviar Tacos,empanadas were also very tasty .

5987734,2016-11-01,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"Had a really nice blowout dinner here on a recent trip to Vegas.  Party of 8 was no problem, as we were seated at a nice table with just enough of a view towards the live entertainment, but not close enough to not hear the person sitting next to you.  

Cocktails were a surprising strong suit.  Potent and well mixed.

We sprang for a variety of small plates to share, and then went all out for a few of us with the table side beef wellington. 

Let's hit the specifics bullet point style:

Brioche rolls - served their purpose.  Tasty, salted, and served with a butter of the appropriate texture.

Oysters Rockefeller - least favorite course of the night.  Flavor was mostly there (could have used some more salt), but the oysters were fried, then put back into the shells with the sauce.  They were on the small side to begin with, and the method of preparation made it even more so.

Empanadas - get these.  Delicious melted beef inside a perfectly fried ball of dough.  Served with a broken chimmichurri that landed more bang then its appearance might suggest.  Ended up ordering more.

Endive salad - a very pleasant surprise.  Interesting and delicious blend of flavors and textures, and quite large for its meager price tag.  Possibly the best value on the entire menu.

Beef Stroganoff - huge flavor in a small package.  As others have alluded to, interesting presentation, but the flavor of the beef was sublime.


Now for the entrée.  The wellington was brought to the table and carved/plated by our wonderful waitress.  Prime beef sliced thick, foie gras, truffles and creamed spinach working in harmony with the texture of the pastry.  Rich, delicious, and completely worth the price tag.

All in all, the service, cocktails, live entertainment, atmosphere and food all summed up to one of the best dinners I've ever had in Vegas.  If you're looking for a true ""Vegas"" dinner experience, this place is hard to beat.",SzANwTg5VIfUQW2t5ru6SA,5,2,4,fpb-7FT8R_qBLNLiMSxobQ
5994704,2016-12-22,0,1DP5vHxJzCDbgawv0WC3yA,"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got a chance tonight. Our server recommended 2-3 dishes per person since the portion was more like tapas style. I did my homework so I quickly decided what to order. We shared 5 appetizers and 1 dessert between two of us and both got stuffed. 
*Caviar Tacos - I'm not a caviar person but this one was really good except the mini size.
*Herb Brioche Rolls - For $5 you got 3 tasty rolls. A must for me.
*Wagyu Steak Tartare - This version was as good as you'd expect, just order it.
*Duck Confit Pasta - A good pasta dish, delicious.
*Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras - Very good, my husband usually doesn't like foie gras but he did enjoy this one. The only thing I confused here was the grilled pineapple on the side. 
*Glazed Brussels Sprouts - The only veggie dish tonight, sweet, crispy, some the best prepared vegetables I've had.
*Chocolate Terrarium - Meh! A big disappointment for both presentation and taste. I saw many beautiful pictures of this chocolate terrarium posted by other yelpers, but when I got my dessert I was absolutely disappointed. I just saw two sages sticking in the chocolate ""soil"", no flowers or petals at all, just two boring sages. The dessert itself was not tasty enough as well, not worth the $35 price tag. I'd rather go to Sweet Raku and get two delicate desserts plus two yummy sorbets for the same price.

Tips:
- They charge $1 pp for tap water.
- Their live performance began at 19:00 including music and singing. 

Service was friendly.",qxFeoBgxgkKh6IBmaRHU2w,1,0,4,x_wtTUR1ggVeLI60vAyOJA
