4 star on staff-friendly but lacking something
 Can't quiet put my finger on it

3 star on the location. The restaurant needs a face lift 

Aguachiles  Verde's de camaron y pulpo (shrimp/octopus) -are very spicy be prepared to dunk your tongue in a big glass of Horchata . I supposed you can ask for them less spicy but then how are you living on the edge? 

Shrimp Ceviche - are very fresh. Good flavor

Oysters- meaty. were fresh and very clean But needed some chilling. Make sure to ask for them extra cold. Ask them to  serve it over ice cubes

Pacifico Mucheladas are a MUST. One of the very few places that I can say that they know what they are doing. Perrrrrfection


Horchata- is good. Not too sweet.",_sBn-hfP3DsrOGwXmnwSpw,2,1,5,bVoKX1OdDsmlO1My_TfRVQ

I had read some revues and they made it look promising. As it turned out, we were in for a treat.
First, if you are expecting fancy, this is not it. the atmosphere is simple and understated. It is a large clean room with several tables, and a karaoke lounge to one side. Thankfully there was none of that when we went, but instead, they were playing great Mexican music. The service was very good, and prompt, and our waitress was very friendly. They started with tostada shells which we broke up and used as chips. Along with this came two dipping plates. the first was a plate of Swordfish Ceviche, that was absolutely delicious. The second plate was Habenero Pico De Gallo. And I was warned ahead of time that it was HOT. Being raised in the southwest, I have loved spicy food my whole life. Usually when a waitress tells me something is hot, it is nowhere near hot enough. This time I only had two bites and was very satisfied. If you don't like very hot spicy food DO NOT eat this. I however found it delicious. For dinner I had the Camarones A La Diabla. It had a wonderful kick, and went very well with a cold Negro Modelo. My wife (a little more of a tenderfoot) Had the Camarones Al Ajo (Garlic Shrimp). both dishes left us very satisfied, and the portions were large enough that we finished them for lunch the next day. All in all, I would highly recommend this for a fun night out.",SZhz_puEKQ6jotEYJiZCmQ,0,0,5,N0fY1_kqtC2osMkA6aMshA

FINALLY I have found a great, no frills delicious Mexican Seafood place in LV!!~
SO HAPPPPY!!!

After scouring Yelp reviews, we decided to go with some friends to try Mariscos out. So glad we did!!! IT is a bit of a dive, in the best possible way. And the food was fantastic!

We started with fresh guacamole for the table, so good! Great flavor, definitely fresh! I had the Shrimp and Octopus cocktail. Tons of flavor, super fresh and decent size shrimp, not those tiny annoying little shrimp. (right? no one likes those little shrimps!)

Everyone else at the table loved their food and said they would definitely go back! The comments were about great flavor, and they loved the rice too!! 

The service was awesome!  The ONLY downfall was the music, that started 1/2 way into our meal was SO LOUD. I know, I feel like such a gringo! I know this is part of the culture, but to see a little kid at another table pressing his hands over his ears makes me think I am not the ONLY one who found this a bit excessive in volume. But that is my ONLY tiny complaint. Not bad right??
