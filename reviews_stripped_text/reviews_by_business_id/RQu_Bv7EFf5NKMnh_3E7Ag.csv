The staff.....?  well...... it appeared they were either all in sync with their ""time"" of the month and clearly NOT too happy about it, or, they were simply unhappy about the corncob that somehow lodged itself into their a@#*....either way, did not make for very friendly treatment..... that being said, we ordered a few appetizers which clearly we should have left in the kitchen..... ordered the fondue..... great little pot of cheese but it was too bad they didn't have time to run down to Smith's and buy more things to actually dip into the cheese..... obviously they ran out of stuff and decided to throw a bunch of the garnish from the bar onto the plate..... guess they figured, ""hey, you're dipping it in cheese anyway.....""..... all together, there were about 5 grapes, 3 slices of apple, 2 or 3 florrets of cauliflower and broccoli and 4 cubes of cornbread.....  kind of bargain for $20 wouldn't you say.....  we also ordered satay and received 2 small pieces of chicken and 2 pieces of beef...... and, as a final slap in the face..... it wasn't at all appetizing..... at least nothing to write home about.....  the best part of the entire evening was the open bar for ladies from 9 - 10.....    they had a DJ who played 30 second snippets of every song.... just when you were getting in to one, it stopped and another came on..... got a bit discumbobulating......  
Again, it gets three stars for the ceiling treatment, the lighting over the bar and the extremely cool tile mosaic chairs at the front door......",Fn8QDIY00XS3upLAAL6LiQ,5,4,3,MJjP1TznOPs0TxRRK6l52A
86255,2012-03-12,0,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"Its EXTREMELY apparent the managers are writing  comments on here due to the fact that some comments are to the extreme stating ""happy hour"" specials, prices, and ingredients to the menu.   I went to Sedona last week and the food was down right disgusting.  I ordered halibut and what I received was a butter soaked piece of fish that I am 100% positive was not halibut.  It was served with gnocchi.  The fish that was served was extremely mushy and smelled and tasted ""fishy"".  It did not taste fresh AT ALL, was oily, and the gnocchi, vegetables, and the sauce was equally uneatable.  I had a few bites and place the plate away from me to be taken away.    My girlfriend ordered sea bass that was served with lentils.  This dish was equally uneatable and she also placed the plate away from her after a few bites.  The fish was served on top of lentils with a pita bread on the side.   The bread was described on the menu as being ""grilled"" but what she received was a 80% burt pita that flaked away when bit into.  It was the first date so I decided to not raise a fuss and potentially make her feel awkward with complaining.   The only thing that was good were the drinks and the bartender's service.   I will NEVER visit this place again.  So to the managers or whoever is posting these 4 and 5 star reviews... Instead of writing reviews on the computer as a last ditch effort to bring people in,  fix the problems this restaurant has and word of mouth will spread.",WmdZrJmfvdGXvp6gbS-0OA,1,0,1,9U2k9SeUh2n3shI0MRewFA

I asked for Magic Hat which I saw they had on draft, but they informed me they just ran out of it. Understandable. Then ordered a Blue Moon in the bottle instead. She came over five minutes later with the beer and said she had forgotten. Then she asked if I would like a glass. After I replied yes, I was given a collins glass because they were out of cold pints. At this point I've had a menu in front of me for 10 minutes and by the time I was asked what I would like to order I asked for my check and left.

We were greeted by a very sweet hostess that lead us outside and wasn't irritated by the fact we were indecisive on whether to sit outside by the fire or inside. We decided on inside. Shortly after being seated we were greeted by our server Lenny. I let him know we would like a couple appetizers an entree and a bottle of wine. Lenny made a suggestion on nice bottle of Pinot Noir and we went ahead and ordered crab cakes, sliders and filet and lobster. The cakes were great.....lots of crab meat and not too much filler like most places, sliders were also a hit. The filet was cooked perfectly as well as the lobster. Sometimes lobster is over cooked but this wasn't the case. It all went down quickly with the wine which was reasonably priced. 

Overall we had a great experience once again. The food was great, service was friendly and professional without the attitude I seem to always get when going out. I would definitely recommend Sedona to anyone seeking a great dining experience.",fumSzpTPJk_PC3Zviz6deg,0,0,5,K7KKEnvVa2uGOWy7italKg

Our runners were also very attentive work our drinks and offering us silverware, as well as appetizer plates. However, our server Andrew did not once ask us to refill our drinks. He did not know the specials, and continually ignored us while paying attention to others. From my experience working years in restaurants I have looked for reasons as to why we had such terrible service.. There was one large party that left before we sat, and he was not cleaning up after that. One other table was sat in the restaurant. As we were eating/
waiting during the hour and half, only two other tables were sat and sadly greeted more promptly. I have tried to find optimism and excuses to why our service was terrible.. Is it just our server or is the actual whole restaurant as a team working inefficiently?? I will say the food was great,
Thanks to the Chef and runners. However, the service was so terrible I cannot see the food being worth the wait and the way we were treated.

Last night myself and a friend got there early while waiting for the rest of our party to show up. The bartender acknowledged us after about 5 minutes..and the bar had 4 people sitting at it.. We ordered drinks and asked to see a menu. Drinks came promptly, but she forgot our menus. No problem, she waited on another customer, then asked her again when she passed us for the menu..was told it would take a minute (as we could see the menus sitting there in front of her)..Being a Bartender myself in Las Vegas, I understand how you could get jaded vey fast. so I kinda understood her disdain for customers wanting something..God forbid they interrupt my chit-chat with a waitress! Our party had arrived, and decided to close my check at the bar and start a new one at the table. I (reluctantly) let the Bartender know that I too am in this industry and hate when people transfer checks ( as sometimes we don't get tipped)..After a generous tip (which was not deserved) we went to our table. She was all smiles after that... At first, our waitress was very sociable, and friendly. She took our orders promptly, & accurately. We had finished a bottle of wine, and it took 15 minutes after we had finished eating to even see someone to clear our table. Finally our waitress who was non-existent throuhout our meal passed by. We asked for another bottle of wine, and was told ""ok"". Well, 20 minutes pass by, and we see her pass by again (shes almost a ghost as she rushes past us) We ask her again if we could order another bottle. Her response was ""Yeah, I got it..it takes a minute""..More like 35 minutes. 

I love the food and ambiance, but the place lacks so severely in customer service, that I really don't want to go there anymore. My opinion is the scantily clad staff would rather have a different job swinging on a pole than dealing with people who want to eat.",ynlKCHdhrCbaBqJjq82ZRg,0,0,2,rSfUhz9-ZFIa33_TsT-9Yg

Service was pretty good except the server cheated us out of some change at the end (a common occurrence we are noticing in the Las Vegas area).  The food tasted good and the setting is cozy, yet kinda cool.  Like an upscale sports bar with better food and not TVs.
We wanted to avoid the NYE strip traffic so we went to Sedona with a couple friends this past NYE and it pretty much sucked.  We had reservations and despite arriving on time, had to wait about 25 min. to get to seated. In the meantime we sat at a bar table and it took a while for us to get our drinks.  The bar server told us the beers 2 of us wanted were not available, then the check came out with the unavailable beers listed on it..  I received the wrong drink altogether.  Then we were seated so we asked to transfer the bill as we hadn't ordered food yet.  Our server said it wouldn't be a problem but the bar server i guess wanted her own tip or something cuz she came back saying she ""needed to close out"" our bill separately.  Yet once we paid she just left the book there with her tip in it.  (Oh yeah, this was after it took her like another 20 min to bring back the change in the first place.)
Meanwhile we were presented with additional ""pre fixe"" menus, then a few minutes later told that they were out of them.  In addition the server told us a few other items on the reg menu they were out of.  Seems very unprepared and unprofessional for an established restaurant serving people on NYE.
The rest of the service was fine and all the food tasted very good but not sure if we can get past the above issues.. Feel free to check it out for yourself.  If you have low expectations hopefully you won't be disappointed.",z30l6lrUl5htn6Br4Cmd4g,0,0,2,svnLUztiak3vkQElQqIdHg

Last night we decided our night out should be there to enjoy great food, atmosphere and cocktails.  We drove up and saw the patio area had an event taking it up (Bat Mitzvah) so we went in and sat at the bar.  We had ordered our food and loaded $20 each into the machine while we waited for our drinks. The music outside was pretty loud,  the occasional glow stick decorated kid opening the door and walking in was annoying but tolerable. It got really bad when large groups of kids were running in and out to the restroom.  What got me was that they were able to crash into the bar/lounge area and sit around while they should have been outside.  Needless to say, it ruined the experience my husband and I have always loved and looked forward to.  We asked to speak to the manager to tell them we did not want to stay and eat. The bartender came back and asked if we wanted our food to go (uh, no!) and that our drinks were taken care of (we threw $40 in the machines, our drinks were bought by us).

I didn't count on spending $150 for me my girl & my son. I couldn't believe it when the waiter came running out side to tell me I left a small tip.

Two years ago I came here with my boyfriend, his cousin and his cousin's girlfriend whom we were staying with.  Two years ago we fell in love with Sedona and our infatuation with their food is still going on head strong.  Ever since that first visit, we've been dreaming about coming back here, usually with salivating mouths.  And now after two years, we are finally reunited.

We came on a Sunday night, and we ordered the calamari, ahi tuna lettuce wraps, and mussels for appetizers.  I have never seen calamari cut so generously.  The calamari is breaded to perfection, and it is not one bit chewy.  My boyfriend has always been wary of calamari because of its texture, but Sedona's calamari has transformed him into a believer!  The mussels and ahi tuna lettuce wraps are delicious as well.

I ordered the ribeye steak with shrimp and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon with scallops.  The ribeye steak was incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Along with the steak, there were 5 huge shrimps which were very succulent.  My boyfriend's filet mignon was cooked very well, and the scallops were orgasmic and cooked to perfection.  I've never seen scallops so big before!

For dessert, we ordered the white chocolate and blueberry (?) bread pudding and the creme brulee.  Both were deliciously amazing!  Honestly, ordering creme brulee at any other restaurant feels like a waste because Sedona just makes it perfectly.

I can't wait to come back to Vegas so I can eat here again.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  No restaurant on the strip will ever compare to this.",cbWSqHDjXQ0MWNyODhRm_w,1,1,5,zdy2S8X691_IlHNobQafSg

Amazing, and different menu choices that are sure to excite the palette. I see some other reviews that mirror what happened to us. We sat on the patio for a little less noise, and the evening was calm. It took nearly 20 minutes just to get a drink. The waitress said she would be right back. We had to go inside to find her about 30 minutes later. We ordered another drink, but it never came. A bit later, the winds kicked up and we had to move inside. The hostess sat us at a table among others. Noisy, but OK. We waited for another hour and still had no one approach us. We are now at the restaurant for nearly 1 1/2 hours and our guest has still not even gotten a glass of water...let alone a drink or something to eat. 

We again went to the hostess to ask what was going on. Why is everyone else being served, but not us?

There were no apologies from the management, and they didn't even offer a drink or dessert in the way of apology. I find that to be not very gracious. No problem, though. We paid the bill and were on our way in less than 3 hours. 

In summary, if you want to sit on the beautiful patio, bring your own drinks and a picnic lunch as service is pretty much non-existent. If you sit inside, the food, drinks and ambiance are very good.

My favorite thing on the menu is the filet mignon meatballs ($8 on happy hour) and the Roasted chicken entree (comes with broccoli and Mac n cheese). The steaks and short rib are also good and very flavorful. 

They also offer several good specials including happy hour, $25 steak and lobster and half off wines on Tuesday.

I stopped in for dinner last night, and will definitely not be coming back.

The outside of Sedona looks very cool, almost like the Flintstones hired an innovative designer to make a South Western feel.  The interior is well put together, with soft lighting, a little music, and many tones of merlot.  When the weather permits, they have a beautiful outdoor patio with a fire pit, it looked awesome.

I would have given this place 1 star, but one HORRIBLE night of service doesn't mean it will happen to you.

MY BAD EXPERIENCE: 

We were seated by the hostess and told our waiter would be John (I think).  About 10 minutes went by before our waiter even stopped by our table.  He asked if we wanted lemon with our waters, we said no, but he brought it anyways.  Not a big deal, but not good service.  We ordered our whole meal at this time.  

Our order:  
A glass of echelon Chardonnay, 
half dozen chef selected oysters to start, 
bowl of Roast Butternut Squash soup
tuna melt.  

The Problems:
Wine came before water
Oysters served with trio of useless sauces (bland cocktail, soy, shallot mignonette.
Waiter didn't check back on us at all, didn't offer another glass of wine, and didn't keep us informed why our food wasn't ready.
50 minutes went by without a sandwich and soup, and when I asked he gave me a garbage excuse: ""Its in the window, ready in a second.""
We kept waiting, our food never came.
No manager spoke to us, the waiter made no efforts to rectify the night, and the place wasn't even crowded.

Not a chance I come back, and you should AVOID AVOID AVOID.  The waiter (John I think) was nice enough, but a horrible waiter.

They have a great wine selection and I've never been disappointed with any of my picks. I don't usually go red, but had a really great Malbec earlier in the day at Total Wine and thought I'd try my luck at Sedona. I'd get it again-it didn't give me the usual red wine headache and was a nice, light red-easy drinking!

Food-wise I've had the Caesar salad which was just ok- I really love Caesar salad and this one just didn't do anything for me. Last visit brought me to the carpaccio which was great-served with arugula and parmesan (I think) and sprinkled with truffle oil. The meat was nicely cut and all of the components made for a great late night snack. The rest of my party didn't fare so well. One of my friends got the calamari and it tasted like it came from the frozen foods section of the market-chewy, boring breading and was kind of lukewarm. Another friend got the creme brulee and the caramelized top was like a brick to break through. She almost sent it back, but once she cut through the sheet rock top, she said it wasn't too bad. Again, nothing to write home about. Also had were the mussels and steak and lobster ($19 special) and no one was really overly pleased with their food. 

The setting itself is the restaurant's saving grace-the bar area is very conducive to large parties in which everyone can mix and mingle and not feel like they're confined to one table. The service in this area is spotty,  but my last visit the waitress was great-very attentive and accommodating. I had a really horrible bartender the first time I went who didn't seem to want to do anything and made a terrible first impression for the place. He was your typical too-good-for-this Strip nightclub bartender except he wasn't on the Strip...he was at a neighborhood bar that can't afford that kind of barn animal-like behavior.

Every time I get an email I honestly cringe...even though I used to LOVE the food and still love the decor and layout of this place.

After hundreds of dollars spent and the fact we still have credit on our frequent customer Sedona card...I now have mixed feelings. I used to take out of town guests and fam to this place ALL the time for years. It was the perfect Happy Hour menu and perfect drinks.

The last two times we have went...not so much. Hubby and I came for HH the about a month and a half ago and dinner with a friend last month. Both experiences were sub par. 

The Happy Hour items were not the same quality as the past few years and the service was horrible. When we were seated it took 35 minutes before we had someone take our drink order. I actually had to go ask the hostess to find someone to help us. The bar area was a little full and the dining area empty. It set a horrible tone. somehow the server made up for the horrible beginning but even after giving her our rewards card... $0 credit had been applied for that dining experience. 

The very last time we went for dinner and ordered regular entrees, an app, salads and wine. The whole experience was weird because the server acted annoyed...me, hubby and our friend kept looking at each other with question mark faces...then we finally spoke to each other about it. LOL. We don't bother servers and we don't like servers to other us. Maybe he just had another annoying type table? Unknown. We never figured it out so we just ignored his attitude. 
The food again was sub par and I guess we were all too hungry to send it back. My mushroom risotto (I have had it MANY times before here) which is usually PACKED with mushroom had like 3-4 total mushrooms. I thought I was imagining things lol. If you know the HUGE portion size of it 3-4 mushrooms...it just looked like oatmeal. Maybe they are trying to cut costs.
It was a packed busy night. Maybe he was just sick? I did find it strange about how long it took to get the check from him. Unknown if he applied credit from dinner to our loyalty card. I honestly have not checked.

I had driven past it quite a few times on the way to the gym and always wondered what it looked like inside. Most of the places with labels including ""24hr gaming"" seem to all fit the smokey neighborhood bar type... Sedona was quite a surprise. 

After we found the turn in, we got a much closer look at the building. Very modern looking and they even have a trendy patio area! While it was too cold to enjoy our dinner outside, after seeing the patio we deemed Sedona worth a return once the weather warms back up. 

Once we got inside, I was pretty blown away. Totally NOT what I expected. It does have the components of a neighborhood bar...but also that of a cozy restaurant with most of the elements needed for a quality date night...which is exactly what we had. Dim lighting and red tons give the place a super sexy feel...but there's also a casual feel with the bar and sports on the few tvs that they have.

We ordered the whiskey and wine drink (where I'm from we call it a Whiskey Rosso)...very tasty! I'm excited to have found a spot that serves this. We also ordered the sliders to start. The sliders were cooked pretty darn close to perfect. Order them as is... I'm not a huge fan of onions but the carmelized onions gave the sliders a nice touch.

For the main corse, my boyfriend ordered the surf n turf and I ordered the salmon dish. The surf n turf was MUCH more turf than surf... you literally get one scallon and one shrimp... so a little disappointment there. The steak was VERY delicious though so they made up for it a little. I would really just order a steak dish on its own in the future though. Their reduction that was served with the steak was pretty incredible, it complimented the steak well. My salmon dish was alright. I'm not entirely sure that I would order it again in the future, but it filled me up at the time. The cream like sauce that was included kind of threw me off the most. I didn't recall reading it in the menu discription so I was kind of taken back when I initially saw it. I still can't decide if it complimented the salmon or made the dish kind of weird. 

I'm likely going to return, so I will update my review with new items that I try...and get the specifics on that salmon dish! ;) This place is definitely worth the stop though, for the record.",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,0,0,4,yif8h6PGfI3pfTTKDMGhww

We came here based on the suggestion of a local friend. As so as we walked in the door and saw sound and lighting crews running over the entire restaurant. We also noticed there was only 4 customers in the entire place. Guess that should have been the first warning sign. We stood at the hostess for 5-10min before we just started walking around asking if we could seat ourselves. We finally found someone who told us we could sit anywhere but the patio (which is a bummer since it was a really nice day) and she would send over a server. 
We sat ourselves and after about another 10-15min our server came up and handed us 1 page sheet of paper. He let us know due to the event the kitchen had a somewhat limited menu. That was an understatement, there was a total of 6 items on the menu, a full 3 appetizers and 3 entrees to choose from.
We decided to order some drinks while deciding what to do. It took about another 10-15min for the water and coke to arrive at the table. At that point we decided to call it quits and go somewhere else. It took another 10min for the check to arrive, and another 10-15min for them to charge our cards. All in a empty restaurant. 
Personally I would like to give this place another try, but one suggestion would be if they have a event buyout to just close the entire restaurant for the day and focus on preparing for their event, instead of providing a sub-standard experience.",Pt7qwibaqSEGZvxmDjox9Q,3,0,1,yCjvXVs5ZaXFS10UjPIi-Q

The biggest reason why I gave this place two stars is because everything I loved on the menu is now GONE. what.

The main reason I used to love this place was for their Surf & Turf for $24.99. It was all day any day. The Surf & Turf consisted of a New York Strip Steak and a Lobster Tail. It was a great deal and as of a few months ago they took that off the menu. (I discovered this the last time I was there, sometime in the late summer.) So I ended up ordering just a steak and decided to try the Foie Gras Fries ($17.99) and loved it. 

So, this past weekend I went for a going away party and was excited to get the Foie Gras Fries again as something to snack on. BUT they no longer have it. **SUPER SAD FACE**

I decided to try the Proscuitto Salad and have some calamari instead. 

In short, food is still ok but most of my favorites on the menu are gone. And, I do want to mention that it takes forever for food to come out.",q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw,3,2,2,MHjWCUX6VuW7pnV3NYP9Gg

What really pissed me off was when at the end of the meal the server brings over a Groupon and said to me"" Your coupon expired but the manger said I could give you $15.00 off anyhow. I said ya thats great seeing that even if the coupon was expired you would still be authorized for the face value of the Groupon, which by the way was $15.00. Then I told her that wasn't the Groupon I gave her, ours still had a valid date. She said oh and left the table. I got the impression that this  wasn't the first time the server used an expired coupon and tried to convince the guest it was theirs. This whole thing had scam written all over it.

They have a pretty good selection of wines by the glass. I got a glass of Tobin James Notorious Cabernet, which was pretty good.  $10 a glass, for a bottle that retails for $20, is alittle steep but that's the way wine service seems to be everywhere.  Huge markups.  

My friend had a rock candy martini, which she claims was not super sweet, but really strong.  I figured it would not go well with red wine so I didn't try it.  The food looked really good and smelled good.  Nice presentation but I didn't try it since I wasn't hungry.  I did get a pretty decent size bottle of Pellegrino for $3.  Usually bars in this town charge a lot more.

I think the thing that impressed me most is that the staff, from the servers to the bartenders to the hostess, are all really nice and helpful.  I also like the design and the atmosphere.  Lots of places to sit and talk.

The only thing I would complain about is a server. Blonde hair woman (curly hair I believe) I have had her twice since I have been here. I noticed that she treats certain guests different. For example I came here with my mother and step father who like to spend a lot. She was so nice to us. Smiled and very attentive. I came here with a couple of friends. We are all 20, 21 year olds.  Now before I say anything. I am a server myself. I know how it feels when a bunch of young people come in. Your first thought, is that they are going to have you run your ass off and  you are not going to be tipped well.  I am almost sure this was the case. She had  2 other tables next to us and would talk to them different.  She came off very rude. Didn't introduce herself. would check her other tables and walk past ours.  Her attitude was just very off-putting. I just wish we would have been treated the same (like when I come in with my family)

Our salmon  entree was wonderful, we shared it.

Lastly we shared a Chocolate Bread Pudding.  It was not a normal bread pudding but rather more like a bread cake with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. it was dry.

Our salads were crisp, fresh and delicious. My folks had the Caesar to which the kitchen happily added anchovies (no thanks for me), and they thoroughly enjoyed. I had the French Onion soup, though it wasn't crispy like I specified, I still enjoyed it because it was delicious.

I had the spinach salad, and it has to be the best I've ever had. I may not be able to order anything else when I go there, (which I certainly will more often). Seriously.com

My mom and friend both had the New York steak & lobster. The steak (according to them) was cooked to perfection, as was the lobster. They were surprised at the quality cause of the great value of the price. My mom mentioned that's her new ""go to spot"" for steak & lobster. They better stock up!

My dad had the lamb chops, which he said were among the best he's ever had. I had one, and I'd have to agree. At first we were disappointed that they didn't have mint jelly, but in retrospect, it probably was fortuitous for us since the chops shined on their own. No additional flavor necessary.

We enjoyed our cake with some awesome coffee and tea. They even warm the mugs, which is crucial to the temperature of the water as my tea (which was top of the line) seeped. That's attention to detail!

The manager Adam was so kind and cordial to come over and introduce himself to my folks and friend, and give his gracious birthday wished to my dad. This man knows hospitality and clearly runs a well oiled machine of a restaurant. He works like a machine. I don't know what they're paying him, but it's most likely not enough!

I can't remember a better experience we've had together than we've had tonight. Thank you kindly Sedona! We'll be seeing you again soon!

Sincerely,

The decor was dark reds, many tastefully done glass accents throughout with dark wood finishes, softly accented with dim lighting with a real candle on each table, perfectly cozy for a dinner for 2 or drinksdd with friends. There is only 1 tv at the bar area which is good sometimes & prompts people to enjoy their time with one another, my wife loved that!

We had the 40oz steak & 2 sides for two, was enough for us to share & brought some home for the dog! (Bruiser Barkington, ""the dog at home"", thanks the kitchen for wrapping up the bone for him.. Lol).  We had whipped potatoes & wild mushrooms as the sides, both great & good sized portions.  Was moderately priced at $69 for the whole lot... YES I did say 40oz steak for 2, don't worry it comes sliced & cooked to order, bone over 1' long, did feel like John Candy in The Great Outdoors for a sec with ""the old 69er""... Don't worry they don't make you eat the fat! (hardly was any, nicely butchered). 
  
Our server Chris did a great job. We couldn't decide on a sauce for the steak so he brought us all three!  As a local restaurant owner here in Vegas, I'd like my customers to be treated with the same respect kudos, Chris...

We will revisit again in the future when we don't want to get stuck on the strip with all the tourists! Good times...

Ps - smoking area outside with gas fire pit & water feature is really neat also. Even if you don't smoke step out back & check it out after a few drinks, well done guys.",lkNKfz9obz93SH5RufVBxw,0,0,5,_qUDa_lk2HCO4OR4KOZTwg

We were told they could try to accommodate us but they are fully booked. He was very rude. They finally agreed to seat us in a lounge area outside. It wasn't a table but it was fine. We sat there for over 20 minutes without being even acknowledged. We finally left. I will never be back. From the moment we walked in we were treated like they didn't care about our business.

Looked over the menu and saw so many great options. Mussels, Ahi Tuna, Salads, Sandwiches and great lunch specials. 

I ordered the Ahi Tuna Lettuce wraps (small plate) and a cup of the mushroom soup 
The lettuce wraps were flavorful, however I surprised at the portion size, even though it was a small plate, it was 2 butter lettuce leafs topped with a tablespoon of tuna, a few onions and sauce. 2 tablespoons on each leaf would have made a world of difference. 

The mushroom soup was extremely flavorful. First time I have ever had mushroom soup prepared this way. Loaded with shitake mushrooms, and with a cream froth on top. Very rich... delicious, but it did take a while to get through the creamy richness.

Means the food will be on point!

Ordered the Our Wings for an appetizer. Those wings are delicious.  Marinated, sauced, and have a great flavor.  They paired well with the craft beer I ordered.  The waiter was very helpful in explaining the different beers they had on tap, and also breaking down all the meals on the menu.

Ordered a burger and sweet potato fries.  Really fresh fries, great crunch and flavor.  The burger came on a pretzel bun...made it even tastier.  I'm a big guy...and when I have to get a carton to take my food home? Gotta love it.  I was extremely pleased by the temp of my burger and the flavor.  Great beef flavor without going overboard with the seasoning. There was also a slaw on top of it that gave it that crunch that I'm always searching for. Pure deliciousness.

Fried Calimari was very nice, offered a few good sauces to go with it, some of them better than others, but overall very tasty.

ENTREE:
The Lobster was cooked perfectly....and for a $38 price tag, it was well worth it (we had a $25 off certificate via restaurant.com).  The tails were medium in size, but they made up for it in taste.  Very satisfying.

3024288,2010-07-07,0,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"Considering the weather in Vegas, its astounding to me how few places here have quality patios.  I mean when i lived in Chicago there were more spots and you could enjoy them maybe 4 months of the year.  Even though it gets hot here in the summer, in the evenings the weather is magnificent and ripe for al fresco dinner and drinks.  That being said, I'm happy to report Sedona gets this concept.  They built the place with a wonderful, secluded patio that has a fire pit a, plants, the whole shebang.  

Alright, alright, I know what you're thinking...you cant just write a review based on a patio.  You're right so I'll give you my overall impression, but the patio is so great it steals the show...much like Robert Downey jr. in Tropic Thunder.  First of all, the place is open from lunch till 4am so you can pretty much hit it up anytime save for the early hours.  The menu is a very sophisticated mix of meats, fishes and sandwiches.  I suppose you could classify it as a Gastro-pub.  I mean they do offer surf and turf which is a refreshing change from most late night eateries here in the valley where Nachos, Chicken Tenders and a Club sandwich remain your only options at that hour.  

I recently visited for dinner and sat on the aforementioned patio.  I could have stayed there all night enjoying a glass of wine but my stomach had other ideas and demanded I order to which I happily obliged.  My friend I split their Ahi lettuce wraps and a flatbread pizza.  The Ahi was fantastic, full of flavor and perfect for a summer night.  The pizza was good, not amazing but again Im eating at 10pm at off the Vegas beltway, I cant expect James Beard cooking out here.  There was a decent wine menu with a number of options available by the glass and the beer options didnt look to shabby either.  

Prices were a little high, but if you're looking for something different later in the evening, Sedona is great option.  I noticed also they had a good happy hour and some interesting and relatively cheap lunch options so I may explore that on a future visit.  Inside, Sedona is very dark and with the standard bar in the middle with gaming machines and the like.  Im sure its fine if the weather is inclement outside, but inside should only be a last resort.  Service was decent, and probably could have been a little crisper but we were enjoying ourselves that I didnt really notice it too much.  

So yeah, 4 stars....probably the place is legitimately only 3.5 stars but I mean having a top notch patio has got to be worth something, right?",9qjLfaAqMxgfqdtTlPwRUQ,0,0,4,S_LXLulLcGNRyBvAl0at2Q

A phenomenal place to either hang out after work or bring your friends for a nice quiet dinner. The service is superb, the ambiance chic, open and friendly, and the prices for a nice meal cannot be beat. Their three course for twenty-four dollar menu is just the thing if you want to bring friends or family. If you want to splurge, you can do that as well with their higher end meals and very nice wine selection. The outdoor enclosed area with fire pit is just the thing if you just want to stop by for happy hour or for a relaxing drink in the evening.

I do have to say that we went here for the first time a few years ago and it was very overpriced, the service was terrible, and it just seemed that no one really wanted you there. This has all changed and I have to say that it is without a doubt the nicest place to enjoy either a drink or some great food on the southwest side.

If you've never been I suggest trying it at least once, and if you've been before, then give it one more chance. I doubt you'll be disappointed.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,1,0,4,d09kYX8_32dqU6guslxUoQ

The atmosphere is real trendy - nice, high cushion seats.  It's a spot you can go casual or go on a date.  It's also a great place to take friends who want to get away from the strip.

For the food, I can only comment from the happy hour appeteizers.  The food quality was much better than Kona but there were only 6 items available.  Too bad they can't expand this a little. 

The day we went they offered:

BBQ Ribs with an Asian Hoisin Sauce
Fried Calamari
Ahi Tuna Lettuce Wraps
Sliders
Steamed Mussels 
Thai Spicy Chicken Wings

We ordered every app, fries (regular and sweet potatoe - both were really good)  

As for drinks, they have $3 bottles and i believe $4 wells.  

Dinner prices aren't cheap but based on the quality of the appeteizers I'm sure it's 3.5+ star worthy.  

I will definitely be back for happy hour.  Kona gets busy and I think based on their franchise reputation, they can afford to slouch on their food quality since it's the ""hip"" place",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,1,2,3,ziPxcOgF1DrM3wEEY2OEhg

3248256,2010-10-05,0,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"My wife and I would have never thought to visit this place were it not for an accidentally purchased restaurant.com coupon. I had thought Sedona was a Mexican restaurant, but was surprised to discover it was one of what I generally refer to as ""One of those 24 hour gaming establishments that sells food"".

After eating there my opinions of these places, at least my policy of tarring them all with the same brush, has changed forever.

Note that this isn't a review of the nightlife, the bar, the drinks. I don't drink so this is purely a review of Sedona as a restaurant.

We went for our meal in between happy hours so at around 10:30PM it wasn't very busy. We've often cruised around our part of town at this time of night lamenting the lack of dining options after 9PM, so we were really excited to discover Sedona offers a full menu until 5AM.

The interior of the place is surprisingly large, modern and attractive. I really liked the wheeled, padded armchairs you get to sit in at your tables and the rather more mellow music than the stuff that seems to want to blast your eardrums out at most eateries these days. So, comfortable seats, attractive restaurant, not smoky at all. So far I was impressed. Now what about the food?

The menu is reasonably extensive and I was excited by the presence of satay sticks among the appetizers. Satay (both on sticks and off) is very popular in Australia and an be hard to find in the US, so I was delighted to find it. When it arrived I was pleased to discover a mix of 6 or 8 sticks, half of which were chicken, half were beef. It's not exactly authentic satay and tends more toward the Thai style than Malay or Indonesian which I prefer - sort of an Americanized Thai version, but it was still extremely tasty. The sticks came with three dipping sauces. Thai Peanut (Satay), Soy (which was just soy sauce - I didn't bother with this), and a sweet, tangy sauce of some description which I enjoyed. The plate was garnished with some chopped cucumber which was so freshly prepared my wife could smell it from across the table.

For my main dish I probably was a bit weak in ordering a Sedona burger. I wish I had been more adventurous now based on the quality of my appetizer, but I was trying to get as good a value as I could out of our $25 coupon by not going overboard with the expensive dishes. The burger was fine, it was what it was. A good quality burger, but generic. I really liked the crusty, floury bun it came on.  The thing that actually has me glad I ordered a burger was that I might otherwise have been denied the chance to try the FRIES it came with. Hands down the best fries I have tried since coming to the USA and the closest in taste to Australian ""chips"". Usually 80% of my fries from a meal remain on the plate, but these were absolutely delicious and I couldn't stop eating them. I discovered they were particularly excellent dipped into the remains of the cheese fondue my wife ordered for appetizer (you'll read about that when she gets around to writing her own review).

Overall we loved our experience here, are excited about a late night option close to our home and look forward to sampling more adventurous options from the menu. The service was decent, the atmosphere was pleasant and who knows - as it cools down maybe we will try the fantastic looking patio area outside.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,1,1,5,Bhgv5cMcULDqFA2Zd_ymag
3304182,2012-07-26,1,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"Sedona has alot of potential if realized but some changes need to be made before it gets there...

I checked out Sedona yesterday with my Dad for lunch. Being a vegetarian, the first thing he noticed was that they took the vegan burger patty off the menu and replaced it with a caprise paninni sandwich. Unfortantely, adding in large pieces of cheese and a balsamic vinegar glaze to the sandwich isn't really a substitute for a vegetarian burger. I as usual got a the standard 'Cali Club' which I feel like is the only thing you can probably order anywhere and not go wrong. My sandwich was good but not amazing. It seems like they used the thickness of the texas toast slices to make up for not putting in much turkey or bacon into the sandwich. At about $14 I expected a little more.

I think one of the issues that really brought down my review rating here was the service. Coming in at around 1pm I noticed that they place was virtually empty. There are maybe two other parties in the main dining area near the bar. However, there a ton of employees (easily out numbering the diners) that were all running around doing something other than serving us. We had to wave down our server to get a ride of ranch and refills on drinks. I think I have stated this in my other reviews, and I'll do it again: I hate having to flag down servers for refills and the check. If we have to go hunt them down, why even have servers? 

One of the redeeming aspects of Sedona is definitely the place itself. Sedona Lounge is beautiful. The outer architecture and interior design is definitely a step-above the other bar-food restaurants the place is usually compared to. The interior looks like a high-end steak house and the patio is probably one of the nicest in town.

Now I have heard some great things about Sedona from friends which makes me want to give the place a second chance. Maybe I went on a off-day or something, it was disappointing after hearing praise from some of my fellow yelpers.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,1,1,2,sFmeyZMnWpzpIOksYqmY7g

A bartender found us standing at the door, and he told us to take any seats we wanted. So we just got inside and took a table waiting for any server.

I really love the vibe of this place, the seating, decor, etc., but that's where it ends.  I'll call our waitress Val, which is a shortening of her real name which I cannot spell or pronounce.  We arrived at 11:30 and it was in no way crowded or did it ever become crowded so there is no excuse for the service received.  

We asked about Happy Hour and were only told drink specials.  Now that I look at their menu on line I see they also offer food specials, which she never mentioned at all.  They have quite a variety of House Fries so I asked what she recommended.  Val suggested Truffle fries, so I put in my order and she returned shortly to say they were out of them.  First fail.  So I just went with the Sweet Potato fries.  I heard her tell a gentlemen seated nearby they were out of blueberries too.  WTF! 

At around 1 am she drops the check at our table.  She didn't bother to ask if we wanted more drinks or food.  They still didn't close until 2 am at this point.  This is where it really takes a turn for the worse.  Val completely disappears.  Well, not completely.  She continued to appear on the floor checking on other tables but never came back to us to retrieve the bill or even make eye contact with us so we could wave her down.  Now, we would have left but she had charged us for Truffle Fries at $14 vs, Sweet Potato Fries at $7 so we wanted that corrected.  I finally got my boyfriend to just go to the bar to get our bill corrected and paid so we could leave.  If it was up to me she would have received zero for a tip but my boyfriend is more generous then I am and left her a couple dollars.

For the past few months it has been the Santa Margarita, Pino Grigio.

Last week, while they were filming a movie at the bar, I took my BFF for lunch there. I had the best Mashrum Soup ever. It was probably a little more greasy than the food I'm used with cause by the time my Risotto made it to the table I was already full.
I have to recognize that I've never seen green risotto before, very impressive , had to take a few bites, but there was no way I could finish it. I'll have to try it again with a glass of Pino :)

Complete brain fart and looking to save money on dinner my family decided to go to Sedona since I had a coupon I've been trying to get rid of. Well...even the discount didn't satisfy or make up for my disappointment. 

First. We were seated to our table in which we waited an HOUR to finally get our orders taken. An HOUR! that was an all time record for me. I was on my second glass of reisling at that point. I could understand if they were busy but it was slow and pretty well staffed. Some of the staff looked distressed and lost and certainly their beige uniform and jeans did not suite the image of their restaurant. Some bussers even had their shirt untucked and pants sagging. 

We thought to get their steak and lobster special for $19.99 and their cheese fondue. Oh lordy! The cheese didn't have that nice thick consistency I like in cheese fondue and the sourdough was very dry and seemed like it's been sitting there for more than the required time that the health department would approve. The lobster was also dry and the steak was the size of half my fist and I have a very small fist. Graveyard specials at the Southpoint had bigger steaks than that. 

Second. No one apologized for the wait and no one tended to us after our disappointment in  hopes to recover from our disappointment. 

Thirdly. This is the ultimate low for them in which I have never experienced this for as long as I've been eating out. The busser didn't take out our bread plates PRIOR to bringing out our entrées so when he came out with our food he asked me to buss the table for him since his hands were full... WTF!!!!!!!!! 

The only nice thing is that the server had comped a couple of glasses of wine and a miller lite which was nice of her. They also have happy hour. 1/2 off wines on Tuesdays for bottles and by glass. Then another happy hour from 4pm-7pm and 11pm-2am. The place  is also nice and clean with that ""fine dining"" look they attempted to portray. 

Overall the place lacks a connection with their ""high end"" establishment and their operations. This place could have potential if they just improve their back end operation and maybe fine tune their staff a bit. But it seems that even after all the reviews. They don't try to reach out and somehow look into improving these qualities.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,4,1,2,f0zLk3DOMUxHbzyx_9XM5A

Woo, all appetizers are $8! From 11pm-2 am :D

The 4 of us got (2) Crab Cakes, Cheese Fondue (normally $22), Beef Carpaccio, and Mussels.

Crab Cakes were 3 to a plate, and had a delicious tartar sauce to it. The server actually forgot our 2nd plate, and instead of just bringing it out, she said the 2nd plate was on the house! Super awesome service.

The Cheese Fondue had a tiny flame heating it but it worked well to keep it hot. We had fun poking the bread pieces and dipping them in the gooey cheese. Also liked the apple bites with the cheese. The grapes....not so much and we ended up eating those sans cheese.

The Beef Carpaccio had a little bit of salad on top of the raw beef slices. It wasn't pretty getting the slices off the plate as all of them ripped into pieces but the taste was smooth and not ""icky"" at all.

The Mussels were juicy and not too small. The sauce it was sitting atop of was a bit spicy for me though but the mussels themselves were fresh.

3709419,2014-05-23,2,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"I give this place 4 stars but it barely makes it. I went with a friend of mine at around midnight and it was the most awkward thing because it has a very romantic setting. Bringing your girlfriend here would be best. I wouldnt go here with your guy friends unless you sat at the bar or on the patio. 
Onto the service. The service was great making only one slight error by bringing us two waters but I cant complain, its a desert out here. I forgot my servers name but he did a great job. He gave us multiple suggestions and was spot on with how they prepare the food.
Finally the food. I ordered filet mignon meat balls for an appetizer. They had a great taste although the sauce that came with it was a bit weak. They're also tiny so I wouldn't share them with someone. Next I had a caesar salad. It came drenched with a light parmesan but it wasn't overbearing. It actually made the salad to be honest. I only say that because the dressing was weak and was way to light for my liking. Croutons were above average as well. Next I had the I believe it was an 8oz (don't quote me on it) filet mignon with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The steak was cooked nicely except I asked for medium rare and it was rare. No big deal I don't mind a rare steak.  The sherry wine reduction was a perfect compliment. Simple and sweet. As for the cut itself it was pretty decent, tender as you'd imagine. Potatoes were average as was the broccoli, but I finished my plate. I don't know if its because of the food or how hungry I was, either way its a rare site. My friend got the prime rib with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. They weren't true garlic potatoes but the cut was decent and the flavor was spectacular. The creamy spinach was the best I've had in awhile. For dessert the waiter suggested the fried ice cream claiming it was the best in vegas. Thats a bold statement to make my friend. 
I had no choice but to get it haha. Although it was eloquent and once again nicely plated the crust they fry it in was disappointing. The caramel and shavings of white chocolate really made the dish stand out as did the strawberries they serve it with. The ice cream was decent. Best in vegas? No but he did his job and sold me on it. The royal chocolate cake and I hesitate to say cake because I cant remember the exact name of it was very very good it came in layers of dark chocolate and I believe it was on a pie crust don't quote me on it because I didn't order it but trust me its good. I had a cup of decaf coffee with dessert which left me pretty satisfied. All in all its a decent restaurant and I think I ended up paying somewhere around $60 for myself. Not bad but if they made some simple changes this place would be perfect.
The plating and menu choices are what give it a 4 stars that and the service.

We arrived shortly after Happy Hour started and were pleased that the specials were available whether you sat at the bar or in the dining area as we have found other restaurants only offer Happy Hour prices if you sit directly at the bar (yes, you learn after the first unexpected bill to always ask!). We sat in the dining area which was very comfortable & relaxing and it never got overly noisy as some places can be during Happy Hour. Our server was very helpful and attentive giving very accurate descriptions of the plates were interested in trying. 

Since appetizers were half price during Happy Hour I opted for the Crab Cakes which had nice chunks of lump blue crab and a tasty chipotle remoulade sauce.  I was very pleased as there was very little breading & mayo but still had a nice crunch to them without being greasy. I'm assuming they were pan seared then baked. I also ordered the Pacific Oysters which I also enjoyed with the exception of their cocktail sauce as it tasted a bit sweet like ketchup with some horseradish thrown in. 

My husband ordered the Filet Mignon Meatballs which were very tasty. He gave me a bite and they were excellent. I'm very particular about meatballs but I would certainly order these for myself. The seasoning along with the tomato sauce was just delicious. He also ordered the Angus Sliders which he said were also very tasty. 

My dinner selection was the ""Catalan"" Seafood Stew that had shrimp, scallops, clams, mussels and whitefish over steamed white rice in a roasted red pepper & tomato sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it especially dipping the crusty sour dough bread in the sauce. YUMMM. 

My husband ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon butterflied and cooked to order which was tender while still being cooked well done as requested. 

I am very impressed with Sedona--the relaxing atmosphere, service as well as the delicious items we've tried so far. Even though it's a bit of a drive for us it's certainly staying on our short list of restaurants to visit again.",0_J-edyZgAkDPHjpZKmiMg,1,0,4,8u15_0PKmb4GF2dypMAJnw

The Service:
Hostess:
When we walked in, no one was at the hostess stand. After waiting around for a few minutes she finally comes by and didn't even greet us with a smile.  She looked more annoyed to be at work. Watching her throughout the night she seem to give everyone the same response.  It must have been a bad day.

Waitress:
After being seated, the waitress didn't come over for a good 5 minutes.  She said she would be right back and then another 10- 15 minutes lapsed before she returned.  The waitress took our order, our appetizer come out, then she came back to our table to ask what we order for the main entree because she couldn't read her own writing.  We waited another 15- 20 minutes before our main entrees was served.  She did ask if we wanted another drink. My date answered yes, only for her to forget 30 seconds later (the main dish that she forgot to write down was also my date's order).  Due to the waitress inattentiveness and the lack of attention span, my date questioned the waitress's sobriety. I will admit that the waitress was very nice, but it must have been a really, really off day for her as well. 

Food:
I ordered the 14 oz Ribeye.  The flavors were great, however the quality of meat was so-so.  It had a tendon going right through the center of the meat which made the meat tough. If it wasn't from that I would say it was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time.  If you like a steak with a real punch of favor and heat this is the one for you.  

My date had the striped bass.  I've been here a few times with her, and we went back to Sedona because that is where she requested to go.  Not once has she asked for any salt or pepper until this time.  She has had this same meal there in the past and loved it. 

This $100 experience was not what we expected due to previous experiences in this restaurant.  However, I will chalk it up to an off day for whole staff and it wont deter me from going back.",VFm1YHmyfszHfbISiJAWXA,0,1,4,zf4tNInLQR7PFMCaMFDkIg

I was anxious to see what it looked like.  The Better Half was here recently and said it was nice.  Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm and has $3 Beer, $5 on select glasses of Wine, and $8 Appetizers....normal Appetizers are anywhere from $11-$16, so $8 is a good deal.

Since there were going to be around 10-12 of us, with some coming and going throughout the evening, we grabbed a table at the bar near the entrance.  The renovation was a success.  I like the new interior much better....it has a nicer feel to it.  The old design felt very stuffy and segregated the room into many sections.  They expanded the bar and made it larger.

One thing that hasn't changed though is that this place is not your typical bar in Las Vegas....it's targeting the higher end demographic.  What does that mean?  When I asked the server if they had any IPA's, she said ""No, and we don't have any Beer on tap"".....I said ""What?!  Seriously?!""....she said ""We're not THAT kind of bar"".....ha ha!  I forgot how pretentious this place was....no big deal, I should have remembered.  So consider yourself warned.....

That ended up becoming the joke of the night.  I told the rest of our group about the exchange with the server so we told everyone who arrived to ask the server ""Where's the Beer Pong table?"" or ""Do you have a Golden Tee here?""....ha ha!  The server thought it was funny.

Back to the experience....we ordered several appetizers.....Oysters, Sliders, Chicken Satay, and Calamari.  Since I don't eat Seafood, I only tried the Sliders and Chicken Satay.  The Sliders were Angus Beef with Grilled Onions & Cheese....very tasty.  The bun was moist & chewy, went well with the Beef.  The Chicken Satay had a nice tangy flavor to it....very delicious.  The rest of the group who tried the Seafood said it was good.

It was Happy Hour and our server, Alyssa, told us that all the apps were $8.  Since we were having dinner, we passed on that.  I have driven by often and seen their sign of steak and lobster for $19 available 24/7.  I asked if with the Groupon I could still get the special.  The answer was yes.  My wife ordered the Mushroom risotto.  We didn't order sides because we were both going to get dessert.

Alyssa brought the food in a short time and she came back to see if my steak was rare enough.   It wasn't, but not by much and not enough to make a fuss over.  She understood as she likes her beef cooked blue also.  My steak was served on a thick slice of white potato and some fried onions.  My wife's mushroom risotto had several stalks of asparagus on top.  Both dishes were excellent!

On to dessert.  Andrea chose the Chocolate royale and I got the lemon pudding cake.  Both were very good.  

I'd most likely give Sedona a 3 star rating but Alyssa was such a good server, I've upped the rating to 4 stars.  The place is a bit pricey but I can't complain about the cost of my special.  The two desserts were more expensive than my steak and lobster.

This is a place to go to for their special or for Happy Hour.  I'll go back and I'll sit out on the patio.  I liked the vibe inside last night.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,4,4,rNrWSSbuZCWMWiXu-7xmFA

The brunch menu sounds much better than it is. I ordered the pan perdue (aka French toast).  It sounded so scrumptious toppers with espresso creme anglaise and fresh whipped cream. Well I guess everything melted by he time I got it because I got boring plain French toast. 

They give you a choice of 2-3 types of sausage or bacon and there is bottomless bloody Mary's, mimosas and screwdrivers for $12. This is a bargain compared to other bottomless brunches.

1. The atmosphere. The inside is decorated very nicely, and the patio outside is awesome. The entire thing is surrounded by a high wall, so you don't have to look outside at 215, and the inside is filled with comfy lounge areas, tables, and nice plants.
2. The happy hour. It runs every day from 4-7 (I think). $3 beers, $4 well drinks, $6 house wine, $8 appetizers.
3. The food. They have some really good salads. Tuna lettuce cups, sliders, mussels, sweet potato fries are decent.
4. The service. Slow and prone to mistakes.

Overall, it's ok if I happen to be in the area around happy hour, but with a location so far from my house, I wouldn't make a special trip.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,2,0,3,-58bVe8HRWygs4hN6aU5qQ

If you don't agree that this is the most relaxing, cool patio in Las Vegas, someone needs to punch you right in the mouth! 

Seriously, the lighting is perfect.  Sexy without being too dark.  The heat lamps are just right.  And if you get too cold there's an awesome firepit.  Best of all the patio furniture is very comfortable.  If it gets too cold, then you move inside where the atmosphere is also very cool.  This is one of the few places that I feel like I'm no longer in Las Vegas.  

To top it off, their 4-7 happy hour is fantastic.  $8 appetizers, $5 wine, $4 wells and $3 domestics.  The food is really good.  With the exception of the calamari (it's floppy not crispy), I've loved everything I've ever eaten here.  Gotta try the Ahi Tuna Lettuce Wraps.  And the oysters are very fresh!  If you are looking for a great romantic date spot, the tables by the firepit are key. This area is kind of closed off and private.  I walked in to a sexy date in progress and decided to sit in the other area of the patio because pimping ain't easy and I respect that!",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,7,4,5,FOcuxl1vtnWzYMugBYWUEg
4076695,2012-06-25,1,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"This place has potential...but I don't think it's living up to it. I've been here a few times (I used to live near it) for dinner and the food is fairly decent, but possibly overpriced. The service is sub-par for the prices and they appear to be prone to mistakes (they've made several EVERY time I've been). The bartenders are ""snooty"", for lack of a better word, and really don't treat customers like customers but instead like pests. The managers always try to ""fix"" things, but it's frustrating to have to go through so many steps every time you dine there. 

They do have a great wine selection and I've never been disappointed with any of my picks. If you're going to drink more than one glass, consider going for the bottle because it's more cost-effective there. 

Food: They oysters were AMAZING! Though the regular order only had 6 of them, again a bit pricey for the amount of food, but...*sigh* It is what it is.  My friend and I ordered 2 orders because we both wanted them. lol. The filet mignon was delish, but the sides...could use some help. I vote for the brussel sprouts (shocking, I know), but I would warn you to STAY AWAY FROM the mac and cheese. It's bland and poorly cooked. They do have 24.00 steak and lobster, but the steak isn't the best cut.  If you order a steak, there's ""complimentary"" surf available. Not bad, but they present it as a deal, but considering the prices, it's really not that big of a deal. 

Oh, and keep in mind, late night Saturday is ""FMA"" which is basically an adult, club-like scene that happens after about 10. They have a dj that plays hip-hop, rap, r&b. They jack the prices up and tack an 18% GRATUITY on ALL ORDERS regardless to party size. Last time my friend and I ended up there coincidentally, it was just the two of us and we HAD to pay it according to the restaurant's ""rules.""...It was actually unfortunate for the staff because she and I both tend to be generous tippers. I was super annoyed by this so feel this is definitely something that may be indicative to bias towards the crowd. 

Overall, I'm not a fan. If it's convenient I'd go there. But there definitely won't be any special trips made to there.",knySv4Xsnx5ifUQxk8aRqQ,3,1,2,slXmhLinvn_hUfiXcLk7Ng

It's apparent they are not prepared. The kitchen for our meal has taken over an hour. At this point the management should be stepping in and making sure that bread or fruit is given to everyone who is waiting over an HOUR for their food ,due to their ""kitchen being extremely backed up"" which should have been avoided . As a server my self . I know in my restaurant when on a occasion our kitchen gets backed up and customers are hungry and waiting i will throw in a  free dessert or I give out a free appetizer card for their next visit and will ask my manager to stop by those tables that are waiting and have the manager  check in with the tables and be very apologetic  to assure the guest that we know it is not there fault they are waiting and hungry.  The management has not once been to the tables to apologize or to make sure everything was fine BUT  the managers did have time to sit and socialize with there friends that came into eat. ..  The one thing that really really PISSED me off was as my mom and I were still waiting for our food we asked our server Sandy ( who was great btw and very apologetic even though nothing was really her fault) if we could have some bread or something because we were so starving and she apologetically told us that they did not have bread and that all of her other tables were asking for bread as well  while they waited.. not even 5 minutes later  one of the managers sits yet again with a family of four to socialize and gets up and brings them a FULL basket of bread. At this point I was beyond livid .. I guess to get proper service I need to be buddy buddy with the  manager..  listen! If you are running a restaurant you should treat everyone with the same respect and not ignore certain guests ..  I was beyond shocked this morning about the whole situation i was in.. When i got my food I inhaled it because i was so hungry and it was good but i was still upset that i was there as a guest and was treated like it didn't matter that i was putting money into their pockets.

We were disappointed some of the items we were looking forward to weren't there but chose the Salmon and Petite filet along with our sides being a Caesar salad and BBQ ribs.
Sadly, they were out of salmon so my boyfriend went off of the 3 course meal and ordered the lamb shank instead - but we still got our BBQ ribs for the appetizer as it came out before we could tell the waitress he went off the menu.
The petite filet was as good (if not better) than some places on the strip I have had, and my boyfriend (who doesn't eat much lamb) was a huge fan of the meat-falling-off-the-bone tender lamb shank.  Since I stayed on the 3 course meal I got a Creme Brulee for dessert which was big enough for two.  
I wish my petite filet (only 6oz) would have had more on the plate than just a smattering of mashed potatoes under the filet that was maybe 3oz - some carrots would have been nice, or anything - my plate just looked so bare with a tiny (albeit delicious)  steak and nothing else.

After trying out the Sunday 1/2 price steak night which is still 25.00 a steak, I ordered the rib eye, it was probably the lowest quality piece of steak I have ever seen.  It was so full of fat and gristle, that I had the waiter come back.  At this point you think he would offer to just take it back and replace it.  Nope, first he said, that is the way a rib eye steak is.  Really?? where would that be?

It's only down-fall is how very far away it is from me. I really enjoyed Sedona Lounge, minus the long drive. But how can I fault a place for its location? I went here for a friend's birthday party and I had never been here before, although I had heard good things about it. I've also heard it is a place where ""singles"" in Vegas tend to go to hang out. I could see that. The place does have a vibe of trendy and young. The inside is nice and the bar is inviting. The cushy seats bar seats, as well the seats at the tables around the bar are very nice.

I had two glasses of their French chardonnay. Normally, being that it was a bit pricey I would have only had one, but I decided to spring for another because it was good. Bad part about Sedona: service was kind of slow and the waitress appeared to be oblivious to the needs of 80% of our party. Yes, I realize working parties and it being a weekend night might have you skip a few people, but seriously, when you've walked by me twice and my drink is empty - you should ask me if I want another drink. So, my suggestion: get your drink order in with the waitress fast if you want it.

I did end up having their tuna lettuce wraps and they were very good. Very fresh and with a bit of a spicy taste - but not too much! They were very nicely presented as well and the price was not bad, but only because they were good.

Overall I really enjoyed Sedona. But it is just so very far away from me. If I lived in the neighborhood I would probably frequent it much more.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,4,tDqpInHp10buLrecJekYTQ

4484738,2014-05-04,0,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"It didn't start out well: we came armed with an old but unused restaurant.com certificate, and the hostess said they weren't taking them anymore. Restaurant.com usually notifies us when places bow out, and there were no signs posted at Sedona, but a quick meeting with the manager got us a waiver, so we were led to a table. But it was freezing, blowing AC right onto my neck. We asked to sit outside, but we're told there was a private party commandeering the whole patio. Not true, but more about that later. 

Once we were moved to the back part of the restaurant, things began to look up.  My food usually tastes better in beautiful surroundings, and Sedona gets aces for that.  Loved the super-comfy white leather (or equivalent) swivel chairs on wheels.  Our waitress was great, coming back multiple times until we could decide what to order from what, to us, was a fairly limited menu.  We were starving, and munched on some decent bread with a delightfully crisp crust and house-made honey butter while we debated.

I started with a Blueberry Lemon Drop, very refreshing and very healthy ;) with the addition of the 6 fresh blueberries.  Herb had a craft draft, and our server brought him a taste, since he wasn't all that familiar with IPAs.

They have a $19 steak and lobster tail special, and we decided to get that and the salmon and share both of them.  Herb had the steak (filet mignon, which rested on a slice of potato) and I took his lobster and gave him most of my salmon.  The salmon was a very small portion, but cooked properly - I ordered it medium.  It was served with sauteed spinach and what was supposed to be garlic mashed, but it was pureed, not mashed, and tasted totally devoid of garlic.  The spinach would have been great, but seemed like it had been soaking in a salt bath.  The waitress had the kitchen cook up a new batch with just a touch of salt, and brought us a large portion.  The lobster tail:  is there such a thing as TOO tender?  It kind of had the consistency of being pre-chewed.  I sure can't complain that it was tough, but I thought it a bit strange.  The taste was good, though, even if the texture was weird.

I've upped my rating from three to four stars just because of the very great service from our waitress, whose name on the receipt I won't even attempt to pronounce!

We skipped dessert, since our favorite froyo place is right next door.  But as we were leaving, two women accosted us right outside the front door and invited us to come back for the comedy contest that was being held in that patio that was off-limits for our dinner.  We walked back after our yogurt and joined the group on the patio as a bunch of raunchy comedy wanna-be's did their schtick and faced off against each other.

I was drawn in by the Steak and Lobster for $19 and the 3 courses for $24.  Honestly, I found the Lobster deal hard to believe so I called ahead to find out about any restrictions and surprisingly this deal is available ALL DAY EVERYDAY.  For a place that is open 11am to 4am that is a wide window for such a great deal.  The only thing is with these special prices you can't use coupons or any restaurant.com gift certificates.

I really like the decor of this place - but some people might find it too dark and too RED.  But I thought it was very elegant and trendy.  The food was AMAZING.  I want to give this place 5 stars, but the long wait and slow service was not 5 star quality.  It was probably because it was a busy time, but it did seem like the restaurant was understaffed.  Most of my group had the steak and lobster deal - it includes a 7 oz. lobster tail and 8 oz. sirloin steak.  You can upgrade the meat for a price, but we didn't.  The steak and lobster were cooked perfectly - everything including the spinach was very flavorful.  We will definitely be back to enjoy that special but we will try to go at a less busy time.

I tried the $24 3 course special which had a lot of options.  I had a small shrimp cocktail to start and the shrimp were HUGE and awesome.  The tuna steak was pretty good and came with some tasty tomatoes served on top.  Dessert was also pretty darn good.

Like I said, we will be back.  The food is absolutely spectacular for the price. I am crossing my fingers that the next time I go to Sedona the service will improve and I will be able to post a 5 star review.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,3,0,4,_22bga-RqWByAXlywtBsgw

If you want to enjoy fantastic contemporary American cuisine without dealing with the scary prices on the strip, this is the place for you! Their appetizer selection is marvelous... from oysters to delectable wings, lettuce wraps and mussels.. full portions for half the price during happy hour! Can't beat that deal :)

Let's not forget the all day everyday steak and lobster deal! Also, all steaks ""surf for free"" meaning you can add scallops or shrimp to compliment any steak for free! I usually order the filet medium rare with some scallops, and this dish never disappoints. 

Let's not forget about the service. It's top-notch. The wait staff is experienced, attentive, friendly, and informative. I've already been here many times and there was never a mishap with order-taking or not refilling drinks and water. Our dining experience has always been smooth and enjoyable.

$126 for dinner for four with 2 rounds of drinks (each) is almost unheard of.

This place has a great relaxed, unpretentious, cozy atmosphere.  
Our friend had a raspberry mojito which she really enjoyed. You can order the tomato soup in a cup or bowl vs with the grilled cheese on the side if you want a lighter starter.  I had the Thai Beef Salad with 8 HUGE slivers of beef which was perfectly cooked ""medium"" (this was huge enough for 2).  They offer Reuben sliders on pretzel bread and gyro sandwiches, both served with excellent fries which I kept reaching over for.  I was too full for dessert, but I will be back for the chocolate fondue.  Service was good.  We ended up here because Cafe Deia was closed on a Saturday night, WTF ?

I ordered eggs Benedict Oscar style - described as ""jumbo"" crab cakes on English muffins topped with 2 poached eggs and Bearnaise sauce with sides of grilled asparagus and thick bacon. The only thing ""jumbo"" was the price tag because the crab cakes were not much thicker than my little finger. 

My wife chose pain perdu - walnut -raisin French toast with espresso anglaise and whipped cream served with a pair of breakfast sausages. Another pretty ordinary entree. Our server never reappeared at our table after taking our orders and we noticed every other table received complimentary snifters of champagne. Needless to say, her gratuity was comparable to the level of service provided.

There is also an outdoor patio surrounded by large trees and enclosure, so you don't have to stare at the freeway. 

I had been to Sedona Lounge 3-4 times, mostly for drinks and a couple times for dinner. They were all fine experiences, but nothing brought me back in the last two years.

Now it seems they have more incentives - Daily Happy Hour (4pm-7pm and 11pm-2am): All appetizers are $8, bottled beers are $3, and well drinks are $4; Wine Tuesdays feature 1/2 off all glasses and bottles (there was also a painting class yesterday); free cake and cocktails (up to a $20 value) on your birthday; $20 off your bill on Saturdays with your Sedona Rewards card; and Sunday Brunch (10am-3pm).

To celebrate my friend's birthday, he and his girlfriend chose Sedona Lounge for their H/H and Tuesday wine specials. We all took advantage of the specials with wine (bottles and glasses), beers, appetizers, and their $19 Steak and Lobster special (4 oz filet mignon and 4 oz lobster tail; offered ""all day, every day""). My friend also received a nice layered chocolate mousse cake for his birthday.

My selection of dishes for the evening:
Cured Wings ($11): confit and cured chicken wings tossed in ranch dressing and sriracha, served with feta cheese, red onions, and cucumbers. 
""NY"" Carpaccio ($11): Striploin, wild baby arugula, freshly-shaved Parmesan, crostini, and truffle sherry vinaigrette.
Filet Mignon Meatballs ($10): Filet mignon meatballs served in tomato sauce with crispy potatoes.
Calamari ($13): Calamari steaks lightly fried and served with a tomato caper sauce.

The wings were definitely the best appetizer choice! The sriracha, ranch, and feta cheese are a delicious combination. Really awesome flavor. The meatballs were also really good and we loved the sauce that accompanied it. The carpaccio was just okay (truffle flavor was a tad overwhelming) and the calamari was a shrug. 

Although the food was a hit or miss, the specials are reason enough to return! Also, everyone was really nice and accommodating, which made for a pleasant evening.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,5,5,4,fyhdKgHk9gut6DxRtlLlBg
4744406,2010-04-30,2,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"A while ago, we're talking months here, myself and two other friends came here to check out their happy hour.  We barely missed it I think, because only one of us got a beer.  We told the bartender that we wanted to sit outside, and they told us that would send a server to us out there.  So we went outside and sat...and sat...and then got tired of sitting.  So we went to Buffalo Wild Wings instead.  So I visited once and was forgotten by the wait staff; just one bad experience, right?  

So I came back here with a friend last night.  The two of us ordered the Ahi Tuna Chips and the White Truffle Flatbread.  The ahi is delicious!  The flatbread was good, but nothing extraordinary.  My rating is heavily weighted by the (lack of) service that I received last night.  

I was really dissatisfied with the service, so to prevent me from ranting I'll simply make a list of things that I was not pleased with:

-I ordered two waters for my friend and I.  Three times.  The first time I asked for water I also ordered our food, so I thought that the waiter put in our order and forgot the water; no big deal.  The second time I asked for water was when the waiter brought us wine and a ""cocktail"" (more on that later).  The third time was when our food was brought to us, I asked about the water again and the waiter said that it should be coming right up...yeah.  So the water comes out and is served in a wine glass with ice and two little cocktail straws.  Yet every other table had a regular glass with ice water.

-My friend ordered a glass of wine and I ordered a Rob Roy.  Waiter brought out the drinks and he set down what looked like a glass of coke in front of me.  A Rob Roy has scotch, sweet/dry vermouth and maybe bitters; no coke whatsoever.  But they were nice enough to not charge me for the ""Rob Roy.""  So thoughtful of them!

-The intervals that the waiter checked on us was random at best.  It was about 15 minutes before the waiter first came to our table, which gave us enough time to pick our drinks and food.  After we finished eating it was a good 20 minutes before we were checked on again.  We asked to see a dessert menu; another 5 minutes before the waiter came back and we told him we would pass on dessert.  Another 10 minutes before we got the check.  

So yeah, those three points turned into mini-rants.  Oops.  If the food is good, it'll take a lot for me to become unhappy with an establishment.  But the service last night seriously ruined the dinner experience for me.  Would I come back here?  Most likely not.  But did I enjoy those ahi tuna chips?  Oh heck yes.  Two stars for food.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,2,0,2,EPpNVGiQwovUOoTKi9jQkQ

4766492,2012-10-06,4,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"To Sedona's Credit,  the GM contacted me via e-mail to rectify the situation.  I promptly responded, but have not heard from her since.  I assured her I would try this establishment another time and update the review based on that visit.

I sincerely hope the email was not just to get a ratings boost.  Time will tell...




This really pains me, but I can't give Sedona more than 1 star!  I see a lot of other decent reviews, but that simply wasn't my experience here.  

After driving by no less than 100 times, I finally decided to take advantage of the $19.99 Steak and Lobster special.  This is my weakness and I had previously never met a Lobster I didn't like!  

Upon entering, I was struck by a feeling of attempted class.  I say attempted because the walls are really quite bare, but the decor that they do have is not cheap.  The lighting is reduced and the furnishings are on the more upscale side, but something just doesn't feel right.  I walk up to the bar, primarily because it is wide open, take a seat and prepare to ask for a menu and begin the ""what Vodka do you have"" game.  I am immediately greeted by a bartender in a classy (from the front) black dress and told ""If you aren't gambling, you can't sit there"".  Now, call me crazy, but I am more accustomed to ""Hi, how are you today?"" or... God forbid from a place ATTEMPTING class ""Good evening, Sir.  What can I get you?"".  My expectations were obviously high... after all, this IS the place with the discount steak and lobster.  Being no stranger to a video poker machine, the only civil response I could muster was a curt smile as I inserted money into the machine and ordered my drink.  As the bartender turns away, I notice that the once ""classy"" dress is has an open back and she has a freaking mural tattooed on her back.  Nothing against tattoo's, but this is a FAIL!

After about 20 minutes and setting off half a dozen flares to get the bartenders attention, I ordered my food.  In the interests of time and YOUR boredom, I will skip to the point and say that most of the 25-30 minutes that I was waiting for my food, most all of the staff (I think even the cook - he certainly wasn't a 'chef') were gathered around the service area discussing their weekends.  Another FAIL on the class front.

Food is here-  A firm believer that there is no other way to eat a steak than medium-rare, my cow is cooked to baseball mitt levels.  The seasoning was non-existent and the presentation was sloppy (sorry, didn't think to take pictures at the time as I was busy downing TUMS). The lobster was rubbery, obviously over-cooked.  By far the most edible item on my plate were the veggies, as I had to send the potatoe back for another microwave session.

I will not be back here, which is really disappointing because I keep getting text messages and email offers from the apparently mandatory players club card I signed up for (skipped that part, but it was entertaining).   Sorry Sedona!",dM2Pvd9v-hewm3oZpLczNw,5,2,2,NWbNK8u9hGS7ZIzdg_E63A

I like when places are empty. The ambiance was beautiful (as always). The hostess was right where was she was supposed to be, was very kind and seated me right away. She gave me the option to sit outside even though no one else was out there. I thought for sure I'd be told the area was closed. Anyway, because of being over 100 degrees out, I decided to sit inside. Within 3 minutes my server came and took my drink/food order. The drink came within 5 minutes and food within 15 minutes. I ordered the wings, they weren't as tender as I thought they'd be, they definitely didn't fall off the bones, also the meat itself was on the bland side...but the sauce that it was swimming in had more than enough flavor to make up for the meat. Overall I was happy with the drink and the food. I left full and was glad my experience was nothing like the many other reviews I've read.",5iizOuKy4xK5eXjIS4R5OQ,1,0,4,Hd7oF2MlVH__627ipqxPIA

Our server Leilani was a good server.  She suggested the Brussels sprouts (which we liked) but when we asked to order the chocolate pudding, she said they only served a raspberry bread pudding and there's no chocolate in it.  We asked for the dessert menu, lo and behold, White Chocolate Bread Pudding.

Food we ordered for 2 people, all small plates:
-Ahi Lettuce Wrap
     2pc. fresh tuna.  Salty with more heat to the spices than you'd expect

-Curry Black mussels
     shells were clean (no seaweed) and mussels were fresh.  Curry was delicate until you get to the bottom and realize all the spices were down there 

-Oysters on half shell ($6)
     2pc.  fresh live oysters.  the bed of cucumber/onion salad was so-so. pricey for 2pc of komomoto sized oysters.

-Mediterranean salad
     ordered without the ham.  we took one bite and left it there.  this was a total miss dish.

-Mac n Cheese
    added salt n pepper to make it just ok.  another dish that we barely touched

-Brussels sprouts 
    the highlight of the night.  great sprouts and not bitter!

-White Chocolate Raspberry Bread Pudding
    ordered it because of all the Yelp review.  definitely can be skipped, save you $ and calories.  we were not impressed by all the Yelpers who said this was ""to die for,"" this is not good bread pudding let alone great

We got there at 11:30 and everything was great. There was another huge bday party going on outside of our room for a group called ""The Movement"" so it was packed. 
On the plus side there was a live DJ spinning hip hop and a little dance floor set up... 
We went to the bar to get drinks and stood there for 15 minutes with not so much as a hello from the 5 bartenders who were clearly very overwhelmed so we returned to the room and just ordered from the cocktail server.. Service was a hit or miss sometimes drinks would take over 15 minutes to get and sometimes 5 minutes. Crown & Diet was $6.50, not bad at all! Many people ordered the $24 steak & lobster and it seemed they all really enjoyed it! 
Also I liked the fact that they didn't charge a cake cutting fee for the cup cakes we brought in and they also allowed us to have a male stripper come in LOL

We definitely overdid it when we ordered:

* Seasonal Raw Oysters ""Cocktail Sauce & Shallot Mignotte"" ($15) - Half a dozen large oysters and a cucumber salad started off our meal.  

* Lump Crab Cakes ""Asian Slaw, Spicy Remoulade Sauce"" ($14) - Two crab cakes came in this order and they were tasty with a nice fill of crab inside, not just filler.

* Stuffed Portobella ""Zucchini, Eggplant, Roasted Pepper, Mozzarella, Basil Oil, Balsamic Reduction"" ($10) - A lot of wonderful things in this vegetarian dish and oh-so yum!

* Pork Potstickers ""Scallions, Water Chestnuts, Ginger, Lemongrass, Sweet & Sour Sauce"" ($12) - An order of deep-fried potstickers sitting on a bed of too much sauce.  Perhaps if they left the sauce on the side it would be a bit better.  Also, I'm more familiar with potstickers that are pan-fried more so than deep-fried.

* Orange Satays ""Chicken and Beef Skewers, Cucumber Salad, Three Dipping Sauces"" ($13) - Four skewers each of chicken and beef, and it was the worst thing we order this evening.  Both meats were dry and hard to pull off the stick.  I wouldn't order this again.

* Ahi Tuna Chips ""Blackened Rare Tuna, Crispy Wontons, Asian Slaw, Citrus Soy, Wasabi Oil"" ($14) - Four seared tuna slices sitting on a wonton with slaw and sauce all over it.  Maybe a little too generous with the sauce.

* Beef Carpaccio ""Tenderloin of Beef, Crimini Mushroom, Arugula Salad, White Truffle Vinaigrette, Shaved Parmesan Cheese"" ($15) - Beautifully presented, it lacked enough vinaigrette, which ultimately meant it lacked some kick.  A few twists of cracked pepper would also help this dish.  

* Beef Sliders ""Three Certified Angus Beef Sliders, Cheddar Cheese, Mini Kaiser Rolls, Grilled Onions, Russian Dressing"" ($11) - Tasty little handfuls with a dill pickle on each. 

* White Truffle Flatbread ""Mozzarella, Parmesan, Proscuitto, Truffle Oil, Micro Arugula"" ($15) - The fabulous smell of truffle oil is the first thing you'll notice, and then you'll enjoy the melted cheese and ham.

For our party of three, we definitely ordered way too much.  We couldn't eat it fast enough since there wasn't enough room on the table for all our dishes.  I think we ended up woofing most of it down just to make room, which meant we couldn't enjoy it as much as we would have liked.  Maybe if they spaced it out better?

Our waiter was friendly, although I did have to look for him a few times for refills, boxes, etc.

When we pulled up outside, I was expecting another chain-gang type restaurant. Oh, was I wrong. Great contemporary decor gave the place a unique feel.  There weren't many people at 1:00pm, but that didn't detract.  Food was fairly good and priced ok.  Pick salmon, steak, chicken, fish tacos, or a few other main dishes, add either a french onion or mushroom soup or salad and pay $15. A little pricey, but when you combine the upscale ambiance, the prices make more sense.  I had the salmon - nice crispy sear on it but marred by an over salty soy miso sauce. Salad was well sized, but too much dressing and too salty too. Most of my colleagues had ruebens and they absolutely loved them. 

Restaurants over salt to get you to drink more, but that's a rookie strategy. Make your food good on its own, pour your drinks well, and people will come and spend money.  I'll probably come back, but the extra salt will make me think twice.",gOsrJWlbtVlb19ZmitNxeQ,0,0,3,RjqoZp-3k7dTevOnOu6jaQ

The atmosphere was classy, inviting and service was great. Food was delicious and I cant wait to go back. The recipes were unique and so tasteful. We had appetizers wings and ribs - elegantly displayed on the dishes and the flavors of the glaze on the wings were so delicious and garnished with cucumber salad under the wings to enhance the flavor mmmmm so good. The meat fell off the bone and onto my fork and the marinade so full of sweet and sour and hints of spice. I had the Cesar salad with grilled chicken and they give generous proportions and the dressing was homemade and perfect mixture of all ingredients making it unique. My boyfriend had the Angus burger with fries and again, generous proportions and you cant go wrong with Angus! Fries were fresh cut and fried in great tasting oil. 
The bar was upscale and the decor was modern and fun. I enjoyed our date night and highly suggest Sedona for any date night, girls night out for a good martini or great meeting place for after work round of drinks.

I wouldn't know about the poor service since by the time I got there, I didn't have to wait for someone to take my order.

One got a salad for dinner and everyone else got steak and lobster. I got a bottle of Riesling with my dinner...I could drink at least 3 glasses so, for the same price, I might as well get the whole bottle and share.

I actually have no complaints about the service. I was having a fun time with the manager and our server, Mike. But I was with good company and alcohol so, that helped. But if you were in a hurry or a bit uptight then, I can see how the service would suck.

Steak and Lobster:
Where would you good find surf n turf in Vegas that's under $20? C'mon! This was a definite steal. The portion was just right and you get a bowl of fries. 4/5

We signed for a specific amount to be taken off each card, however, upon checking our bank accounts a week later, she had over charged my card by $10 and my friend's card by $25 dollars. The GM, Adam, was a little hard to get ahold of the first as I had to call 3 times to finally get someone to speak to me. He said he would copy me on e-mails to their corporate office requesting they look into the situation b/c there was nothing he could do for me. Two days later I never receive a single e-mail or phone call. I called myself to follow-up and the hostess was rude and dismissive. The GM was not available so now I had to re-explain the situation to a new manager, Jason. Jason tried to blow me off b/c Adam wasn't in that day, however, upon pushing him to do something he said he would call their corporate office. A few hours later, I have a voicemail saying they aren't going to do anything for me and that I need to call my bank and dispute the charge and make the bank do the work. 

Never once through out this process has anyone showed concern or made an effort to correct the situation or try to salvage a relationship with me as a customer. I am astonished at how rude, dismissive and unapologetic they were regarding the situation. They basically had the attitude of ""you figure it out.""

Not too hard of a place to find, though it can seem a little hidden even though its right off the Flamingo. 

My girlfriend and I along with another couple came here for the happy hour menu after arriving late into town. There were a number of dishes but since all the appetizers were $8 a dish, we couldn't hold back. We ordered the crab cakes, beef carpaccio, cheese fondue, and steamed mussels. 

The crab cakes came in 3's and were rich and flavorful. Each one was slightly crispy on the outside and served with tartar that had just a hint of spiciness. 

The cheese fondue was excellent, with a small bowl of melted cheese sitting atop a candle, flanked by a bowl of fresh bread, grapes, and apple slices. It doesn't seem like the cheese will be melted enough at first, but it turned out being perfect as you get to roll whatever item you choose into the cheese as it strings away slightly from the small pot. The sourdough went the best with the fondue, though I also liked the apple bites. 

The carpaccio was served on a round platter with a bit of salad in the center. It got a little difficult to eat as we couldn't find where the top piece was in the dimly lit room, but it was still a great treat. 

The steamed mussels tasted fresh but was a bit on the spicy side so some of those in our group didn't have much of it. I think I ended up taking at least a third of the plate. 

We ended up getting a second plate of the crab cakes on the house as the server forgot to put the order in for the second plate. 

Overall, not quite as I had remembered the place. I still loved the atmosphere still and will definitely be going back.",kM8wsJM1b58GuxOfaBI1eg,1,1,4,JEpP--RmCNZK-jgMoDUbEA

I've been here a few times and I've never had a bad experience.  We went there last Sunday to try out their new brunch menu. We'd purchased a Groupon for $15 worth $30 on their Sunday Brunch. The weather was beautiful so we asked to sit on the patio.

The staff was nice and asked us if we'd like to sit in or out of the sun. They have options for normal tables or soft seating. We ended up with a table that was about half in and half out of the sun which was perfect. 

We had shot glasses on the table, and just as I was inquiring about them the host came over and offered us free a shot of some sort of homemade alcohol he brews. It was really strong and rather tasty! It was a fun unexpected addition to our experience.

The brunch menu is amazing, we both found several things we wanted to try so I know we'll be back soon! I ended up ordering the Pain Perdu (artisan walnut raisin french toast, espresso creme anglaise, whipped cream and breakfast sausage) - $14. It was delicious! However it only had a drizzle of the anglaise so it was somewhat dry. I'd order it again for sure, but next time I'll order a side of syrup to go with it. My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict Oscar (jumbo lump crab cakes, english muffin, poached eggs, grilled asparagus, and bearnaise sauce, served with herb breakfast potatoes and bacon or sausage) - $15. I tried several bites of his and it was amazing! I'm not a huge eggs benedict fan, but this is something even I would order.

I had a cup of coffee he had water. We checked in on Yelp and Facebook and a friend saw us there and decided to drive over and join. He arrived just as we finished eating, but the staff had no problem adding him to the table, letting him order and allowing us to just hang out and visit while he ate. It felt good to not feel rushed and it was so nice to sit outside!

All in all, after the Groupon our order came to only $2.50 - we tipped appropriately and went home to buy another Groupon before it expired.

**As a side note, this is a restaurant who uses Restaurant.com as well. You can purchase a $25 gift certificate good towards a $50 purchase, for only $10 - this is great for dinner for 2!**",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,6,3,5,XPn71PDDSjpgDJn-1e5N4A

We would go back and try a few appetizers off the happy hour menu $8 but it was fairly expensive considering the quality.

It's slightly off-Strip and located in Summerlin, but a quick drive on the 215 will get you there in no time.  It's slightly dim on the inside, but it feels much nicer and more upscale than the menu prices would indicate.  Supposedly Andre Agassi eats here from time to time.

Mrs. C continued her string of unbelievable ordering.  She got the cheapest dish, but it was also the best.  How does she do it??  The 3-course menu for about $30 consisted of:
- chicken consomme, brought out in a fancy teapot and then poured into a small bowl of mushrooms tableside
-seared scallops with a bacon and mushroom cream sauce
-creme brulee
There are other 3-course menu choices, but that's how she rolls in Vegas.

I got the NY Strip, and college classmate's mom, (who now lives in Vegas and whose suggestion it was to try Sedona Lounge) got the fillet mignon.  Here's the scoop, tho - on Sunday evenings, the steak menu is 50% off!  We got a great deal on a dinner that night!

5752761,2014-08-25,1,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"We finally got around to giving this place a try, after having driven by it countless times.  I was a bit hesitant based on the reviews, which consistently noted the good food but bad service.  I can see how such an experience can be had here, but our experience was wholly different.  We had a great time.  

First of all, walking in you notice the extravagant décor right away.  I love the modern reddish black interior with contrasting white tables, which brings out the bling without feeling cheesy.  There's a big bar in the middle, high-chair communal seating behind that, and table seating at the perimeter.  It's a very interesting arrangement that I thought offered great organization, with striking visual to boot.  I love their interior, it's 5 star worthy.

When we came in there was no one at the maitre'd podium.  We waited about 1 minute, at which point a server hurried over and gave us a pleasant greeting.  He seated us near the front, and our server came by soon afterwards to greet us and take our drink order.  The service remained very pleasant and accommodating throughout the evening, which was a departure from what I generally read on Yelp.  The one thing I noticed, however, was the length of time between the server coming around which was a bit long.  We ordered and waited about 20 minutes for our food, and the server never came by in between.  While we were eating she came by once to ask if everything was okay (which it was).  Now, they did every requisite thing servers are supposed to do - take our drink order right away, bring the drinks and take our order, bring the food, ask how the food is, take the plates away (did that a couple times), ask if we want dessert, and bring our check.  So to me the service was just fine.  However, the in between was somewhat lengthy and they did not make any extra visits to the table.  Moreover, they were nowhere to be found so IF we needed something in between, it would have been some work to get their attention.  This, on a busy evening, may become an issue, especially if you are needing things in between their visits.  So service, while very pleasant, probably gets around 3.5 stars.

We ordered the filet & lobster for $19, which comes with a 4 oz. filet and a 5 oz. lobster.  Since these do not come with sides, we also order the creamed corn ($10).  So 2 orders of filet & lobster with a side really comes out to $50.  Filet comes with a slice of potato and glaze sauce on top, and is very good except a bit overcooked from what I ordered.  It's a thin piece of meat but is tender.  The lobster looks to be the typical grilled, with pesto glaze and melted butter.  As good as any other grilled lobster, which is to say I liked it very much.  The creamed corn is outstanding, although I think $10 for a side of this size (ample but not giant) is too much.  They were in happy hour for the first 20 minutes of us getting there and there were some tempting appetizers for $8, but we did not partake.  We did dessert however, and the caramelized rum banana dish was delicious.  In the end, the meal came out to $75 with a beer and a glass of wine, ending up at $90 after tips.  What we got was definitely worth the price overall, and I'd give it a solid 4 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  There is a large bar in the middle with machines, and it looks to be perfectly set up for eating alone.  They only have a couple of large TVs though, and one of them had their advertising running.

We were quickly met at the door and seated at a cozy table for two. We felt right at home in the posh low back chairs and low lighting, maybe a bit to low as it was hard to read the menu. For our first visit we opted to try something lighter as it was late so we shared the chicken spinach salad, the sliders and a side of sweet potato fries. The salad was excellent with the chicken lightly seasoned and a balsamic dressing.  I throughly enjoyed the sliders,  they were well seasoned and very juicy and devoured them quickly along with the fries.

It's always been so cute inside and their patio is beautiful.  This time the service and food were both wonderful. My husband and I both got the $19 steak and tail. The steak was on the smaller side but I was totally fine with that, and the tail was a good portion for a tail. We also spilt the Caesar salad, which we r snobs when it comes to Caesar salads and theirs was really good. Their dressing tasted homemade( I asked for extra on the side). They also serve u fresh warm bread to start. I gave it 4 stars bc their menu is a little too pricey.",UkDieiJYty243dz-CT6nYA,0,0,4,DC_oB1yQTuwLwvS2uE7JLw

It has a nice feel to this place, Always very clean and the workers are very well organized when it comes to ordering.

Very easy to get into if your going west bound, if your going east a bit trickier,
We have been here a few times over the years. They have very good steaks!

They had a Lobster and steak special that is very good! The steak is cooked perfectly and the lobster as sweet leaving you wanting more!
You know when you eat something good you say you wish you had more?
We have always liked eating here.
Its a nice spot for a romantic dinner or a nice place to celebrate a special occasion 
Service is always very good too!

We would for sure go back, We like when they have specials, the regular prices are a bit expensive but very good place.

If your near here it is worth checking out!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,1,2,4,S_SGu3NfxVMxfPeuL53cVA

Other than getting 2 complimentary drinks on Thursday nights (only of you're loyal member) and half off steak & turf on Sundays, I would not be a frequent here.

It's got a classy vibe, and also a nice place for girls night out. Their outdoor patio has a burner fireplace. 

I'm not sure about the food, but the bartender was very attentive, and the drinks were OK priced. I'm thinking average of $6-$7 for a cocktail. I will definitely return again.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,0,0,4,oc9Nd_ZsvwhGxp1nWStdEw
5854205,2015-11-11,4,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,I was excited to try out Sunday Brunch here after visiting the bar a few times but sadly it was just okay.  Service was very slow but she was apologetic and warm.  The menu sounded better than the food actually was.  You can get unlimited mimosas with brunch for only $12.  I would have given it 2 stars if I was basing my review solely on brunch but I have been to the bar and eaten other things and they have been pretty good.  Just okay.,1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,10,5,3,F8ccf8DN33LqZNefs2Fiaw
5918801,2011-06-23,0,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"Dropped by yet another restaurant because of Groupon.  And in spite of reading some mixed Yelp reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a nice restaurant that also offers almost 24/7 gaming (they are at 4 am now).  The place looks really upscaled, and the interior was roomy with high ceiling, and modern decor.  The outside patio area also looks great to dine in, when the temperature is not so overwhelming.  Overall, the ambiance just works.

The dinner menu was pretty straight forward (appetizers, soup & salads, entrees, sides and desserts, plus the drink menu), but a good portion of the menu seems to have Asian-inspired components.  

I tried the Seared Diver Sea Scallops, served with Jicama Slaw (definitely has Vietnamese or Thai influences), Sambal Chili Butter, and Toasted Macadamia Nuts.  This entree was delicious, but the portions size is definitely petite.

The ""12-ours"" Wing"" (12-hour cured, confit wings, Thai chili sauce) was decent.  But I think on the dinner menu it had description from the BBQ Ribs, which made me think that it was a special 12-hours slow braised version of the ribs, instead of chicken wings.

The Creole Crab Cakes was fairly good. Nice flavor, decent crispy crust from searing in the sauteed pan.

The next day I was back for lunch, and to redeemed my final Groupon.  I honestly schedule a lot of my meals around expiring Groupons and LivingSocial certificates.

After checking out the lunch menu, which features a lot of sandwiches, we still ended up ordering some of the items from their dinner menu. The Bone-In Ribeye was excellent, especially with the free ($15 value) Surf & Turf upgrade.  We also have an order of the Chinese Duck Salad, which was definitely a entree portion salad.  Overall it was fairly good, but I would have like to see the confit duck leg be more tender.

Service was excellent from both the two different servers that waited on our table during the two visits.  A+ for attentiveness.

Price is not bad, esepcially if you take advantage of the promotions that are being offered:

Happy Hour pricing on $3 Beers, $4 Premium Shot Well Cocktails, $5 Select Glasses of WIne, $6 choice of six appetizers (daily from 4-7pm & 11pm-2am) 

Free Surf & Turf upgrade for steakorders(excluding lobster tail and foie gras) 

Steak Sundays -1/2price Steaks ALL DAY & Night! (But not valid when combined with other offers like Groupon, LivingSocial or Restaurant dot com)

If you are frequent visitor to Sedona Lounge, make sure you sign up for their loyalty program.  The signup process is simple and can be done online.  Plus that entitles you to free drinks during their Thursday Happy Hour.

Overall, I have enjoyed my visits to Sedona Lounge, and will be back again in the near future. 

Food:  4/5  

Price:  4/5 Not bad, unless you order a lot of sides and break the piggy bank.

5929349,2014-07-13,0,RQu_Bv7EFf5NKMnh_3E7Ag,"Honestly the food was incredible!  I had the lobster and steak with a side of mac and cheese.  Also the app of the meatballs.  The steak and lobster although small portion was absolutely delicious.  But what killed this rating was the service.  Our waiter was a bit short and then became rude.  Near the end of the evening we could not even find him half the time.  And at one point he was blatantly ignoring us and flirting with the bartender even going so far as to take her picture while we were attempting to flag him down.  He forgot that my friend has asked for another glass of wine and did not bring it until the end of the meal thus causing the cost to be more as it was past the happy hour, even though she ordered it within the happy hour time.  I would go for the food but the service was terrible and may cause me to not go back.",7L3pTisBgV5vW4F_ZkuqlA,1,0,2,dT8AegInrYz8-kMgFrXrbg

Not big - but wouldn't you rather have a perfectly seasoned and cooked meal than a big meal that is blah? We are going back soon.

FYI, it is fancier on the inside than I expected - you might want to dress up a little.",w-5aIgCj3bgx73kHVtr0_w,0,0,5,woY4Go5azzVwNUNml_Di-A
