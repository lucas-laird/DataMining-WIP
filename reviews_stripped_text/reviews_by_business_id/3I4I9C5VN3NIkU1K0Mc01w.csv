My wife was loading up on the salsas when I reminded her we were only getting chips and guac.  This is why she is my wife.  The green sauce, the extra cilantro, and onions were all perfect compliments to the guac.  When I started eating it i was so glad she had loaded up. 

I fell in love with the green hot sauce, it's spicy and very fresh tasting.  

We had a variety of street tacos, the chicken flauta combo, and   chips and guac. All severed piping hot and very tasty.
