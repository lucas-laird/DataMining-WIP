The French Toast is absolutely amazing.  But, this should not discount the pancakes.  They are, without question, the best buttermilk pancakes that I have ever tasted.  On this, there can be no debate.  They absolutely melt in your mouth.  With them both on the table, it is completely impossible to stop eating.  I am glad that I don't live here as I would almost certainly have diabetes within a year if I knew that I could get pancakes this good any time I wanted.

chicken quesadilla 9/10
the only reason I'm giving it a 9 is because I thought it could have used a little more cheese, but other than that it was extremely good, and the chicken was well cooked and seasoned 

biscuits 10/10
extremely buttery and flavorful, quite honestly some of the best biscuits I've ever had

service 10/10
our waitress, Claudia was very polite and prompt, she made sure that we were taken care of in a timely manner and that all of our food was cooked to order. she really helped us feel welcome in the restaurant.

291194,2011-09-05,0,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"This review is for the Blueberry Hill Restaurant located next to the library on Flamingo. A group of seven of us had just got done bowling at Sam's Town and were looking to get our ""after drinking grub"" on. It was around 1am when we sat and began our wait....and I mean WAIT!!! We starting timing the waitress on our phones to see how long it was going to take her to get our order...10 minutes and a solid minute before we were going to leave. After that we waited another 10 minutes to actually get the drinks we ordered, well some of us that is. Me and two other friends ordered coffee and after waiting twenty minutes to see her start to walk over with it we all realized there was not enough in the pot for all of us. So my friend waited another 10 minutes before he actually got his coffee. My friend and I that did get coffee originally were already done with our coffee when he finally got some....uuggghhh!! Our friends that ordered soda both complained that something didn't taste right and switched too water. AND that was just the drinks:( 

Now the food is the only part of this review that i gave stars to. Not for it's promptness or fantastical value because it had neither but for the fact that it was hot and filled up my alcohol laden belly as wished. It was good....when we finally got it:( 

To set things into perspective...when we got there another large group of six sat down at the same time as us. When we were sitting there wondering if we would ever get our food or coffee for the lone one of  us that still hadn't gotten any they were gone and fed!!!! What a crappy experience at a normally very good place...disappointed that i brought my friends there for their first time and our waitress sucked!!! Must have had something to do with the 18% tip she tacked on our bill:{",9MalNeTSjQeyMkabfU6tRg,0,0,2,0pZbkh-uQzEbIDjf3_THFw

With an excellent staff that gets you in a great mood and food that leaves your tastes buds more than satisfied,  you can't go wrong with Blueberry Hill! This is my second time here and still haven't been disappointed, if anything my visit this time was better than the last. Today we tried the ""Chicken and Waffles"" and ""Chocolate OREO Pancakes""! Both of which were nothing short of delicious. Each has their own unique taste that keeps you wanting ""one more bite"" as long as you find yourself able to stomach the great portions that they give you, it shouldn't be a problem at all. If you like chocolate and you like pancakes for breakfast the chocolate OREO pancakes are definitely the way to go! The OREO cookies and bits are cooked right into the pancake and topped off with a sauce that is what I beleive to be OREO cream itself! (if I am wrong please don't tell me) and last but not least the chicken and waffles! This dish blended the sweetness of a dessert and hardiness of a breakfast meal. It caught me off guard with flavors that you would think to be very conflicting ones, turning it Into an epic combination of fulfillment and delight!

I have been there with 10 people and for such a small kind of place, they have always found space for us to sit together. I made friends with one of the older waitresses. She is adorable. 

I have never waited a ridiculous amount of time for my food. One I came in at 9:15am, had my food at 9:20, give or take a minute. It was so fast. 

It is inexpensive and open 24 hours! As a college student it is perfect for those late night cravings of some good french toast or anything really. When my family comes into town there is no doubt that when asked where do they want to eat this weekend, ""Blueberry Hill, duh!"" At least once they have to eat there when they are in town. Its awesome. 

They have deals all the time too.  I had French Toast, Eggs, and Bacon for 5.99, but it was the before 11am special. I think thats pretty cheap and it is way way way better then Denny's even though I can't hate on Denny's too much. :) 

On another visit, it was a busy Saturday, but the folks I was with, we had sat there and was walking for 3 hours and not once did they ask us to move or hurry up and leave when we finished eating 2 hours before. It was nice to just be able to sit there and converse with your friends and not being pushed away because they needed the tables for others. 

They are pretty quick at getting tables cleaned and ready to go for the next guests as soon as the previous ones have left. I have never waited more than 20min, even when the parking lot was full and cars had to start parking on the street.

1057530,2013-01-14,1,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"This place is a local chain that is fairly dependable and reasonably priced. The Flamingo location, like all the others, gets busy from 9-12 on the weekends. But even during those busy times there is never an uncomfortable wait. 

They have a crew of experienced waitresses, but lately they have been training new waitresses during those busy times.  This of course leads to some missteps, but it's never a huge inconvenience.  And the waitresses are always nice.   

There was a menu shift a few years ago and Blueberry Hill revamped their menus at every location. They started offering more selections. It seemed to be an effort at competing with some of the national chains. Suddenly there were big laminated books filled with pictures of Chocolate Oreo Pancakes and Chilaquiles. I stay away from the Mexican food on the breakfast menu. It's OK at best.

Overall the quality of some of their dishes seemed to suffer a bit as a result of the changes. Hubby says the chicken fingers and ham steak have declined in the last few years.  The omelets and combos are still solid. I stick with my standby, the Waitress Special (eggs, waffle, and bacon or sausage).  Their waffle is a tasty surprise.  I've never been unhappy with it.   

On Sundays there is often a kid out front selling the local paper. Even if you don't buy a paper from him, he holds the door for you. I haven't seen him for a while; I hope he's still around.

POSITIVE CHANGE: They carry Twinings Tea now.  That might not impress tea lovers, but it's a huge step up from the Lipton they've been carrying for years. 

IN RETROSPECT: This hasn't been a positive review in the traditional sense. But it is a positive review. They are open 24 hours. I know what I'm going to get at Blueberry Hill. The wait is never long. The waffles are good.  And the people are pleasant.  In spite of the changes, I still like it here.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,4,1,3,KEXptyRFMly5iWUKwsIY8A

So after a few drinks we needed something open late. We couldn't agree on a place open late that sounded good to everyone, and Blueberry Hill was close by.

Blueberry Hill is open 24 hours. It all goes downhill from there.

I ordered the chilequilas, which I had never had before. I guess they're like breakfast nachos. The food was absolutely mediocre at best. Now I know it's 1am, and fine dining isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but it at least should make me go ""Yum!"" instead of ""Oh..."" And around us, between the four, nothing was a stand out at all. Nothing said to us, ""Damn, that's what we SHOULD have ordered."" (Although H. San's pancake stack looked mildly appealing.)

Service was awful. Again, I know it's 1am, and if you're a little understaffed, I understand. Grave is not an easy shift. But it doesn't take that long to refill a soda or coffee. How do I know this? Because after she had asked if we wanted refills, she proceeded to forget AND REFILL EVERY OTHER TABLE before a busser offered us refills.

Round two: My mom ordered turkey dinner w homemade cranberry sauce and yummy stuffing. It came w tasty chicken noodle soup! Since I'm a breakfast lover I had the spinach and cheddar omelette, again accompanied with flour tortillas and homemade salsa. I loved every bite.

How disgusting can a restaurant be?!?!  We dined at this particular Blueberry Hill restaurant last weekend because we were all in the mood for breakfast food, and we were in the area.  It was late in the evening, so we were told that we could sit anywhere we wanted.  We selected one of the round/horseshoe shaped booths in the corner.  Our meal was great.  We had absolutely no complaints as far as the food or service was concerned.  However, we were totally grossed out and ready to puke when a roach came to pay us a visit in our booth.  The roach was moving really slowly, almost ready to die, which was great because that made it possible for our waitress to see it when we called her over.  The look on her face was one of pure disgust.  She apologized and walked over to the counter to tell another waitress.  At this point, we were all standing and ready to run out of there to take steaming hot baths!!!  No one came back over to the booth where we were standing at, so we walked to the front counter.  The main waitress told us that there was no bill due to the inconvenience.  No duh!!!  Ya think?!?!  I truly believe that when you see one roach, that means there is an infestation.  Especially when you have bold roaches that come out to dine with you.  I came onto Yelp to peruse the other reviews of this location to see if anyone else had any other unfortunate experiences with roaches.  I did a quick search of the reviews by typing ""roach"" into the review search engine, and sure enough three other reviews popped up with the same issue of roaches in their booth/table.  Shame on Blueberry Hill for allowing such filth.  There are no exceptions, and I will never, ever, ever step foot in this place again.",XwvP1gzkVZhnQy8khFaf3g,1,0,1,fbUlmGMu9vZEBQvTAQo1EQ

Seeing the menu online, then the exterior of the restaurant and knowing it was a 24 HR joint sort of lowered our expectations going into it. 24 hour restaurants are usually below average, but we felt this place was a great find.

We arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday and there was a short line up in front of us. We were seated fairly quickly and the staff was pleasant.

I ordered some sort of ground Angus beef steak topped with bacon and cheese, served with eggs (I got scrambled), hashed potatoes and a side of toast. My boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers Omelacake served with hashed potatoes. Both plates were HUGE. Everything was tasty and we've both never really seen breakfast items like these anywhere else, so it was a treat to try something new and different. They have a pretty big menu and a few of the items are unique from other similar breakfast places.

I'm not sure how their dinner is, but the breakfast was delicious. My honey and I both agreed that the coffee was yummy as well! That's always a very important detail ;)

What a welcome break from the strip for us after a few days of casino restaurants! The pancakes were what I remembered. Fluffy, with that very slight crispness on the outside, just perfect. We all enjoyed them!

For some reason, I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelet, and this was the only bad part of the meal. Overall it promised to be an acceptable, not great, dish -- but a few bites in I realized that some of the mushroom pieces were spoiled. I had to spit it out into a napkin -- gross.

1741516,2011-02-01,2,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"Walking past this location on pretty much any given morning, it's apparent that this is a Las Vegas favorite. The packed parking lot and surrounding curb, a taxi dropping off a fare, cop cars, and the out-of-state plated cars remind me why this modest-looking joint is my choice breakfast locale.

The great: The food. It's that simple. My favorite single item is their french toast. 4 wedges and I'm in heaven (and full). I also enjoy their meatloaf and after a night of drinking, the (huge!) breakfast burrito is quite satisfying. The prices are reasonable too, and you generally get a lot of food for the money. 

The not-so-great: I hate to say it, but the service is not as consistent as I'd like. Late night the servers are always super-attentive, but during the day is another story. It seems like it has little to do with how busy they are, as I've gone on a weekday mid-afternoon and the place is maybe 1/4 full and the service was worse than a visit on a bustling Sunday morning. 

Still, there's a reason why people from all walks of life come in, it's quite the breakfast joint.",Zp4wpooKMnSThDJ8qLuZGA,1,1,4,eyFABhNpXIfGng0yH3__xg

We walked in on a busy Saturday morning around 10:00. The wait time was a short 5-10 minutes. 

I was hoping to see pumpkin on the menu, since it was October, but no dice. I was just about to settle for blueberry, but that idea was abandoned when I spotted the cinnamon roll pancakes. Cinnamon roll batter baked inside the pancakes with a thick drizzle of icing. The pancakes were even better than I had expected. I'm not a huge cinnamon fan to begin with, but the pancakes were amazing. The cinnamon sugar was caramelized on one side, giving the fluffy cakes a perfect crusty texture. The cinnamon topping, along with the icing drizzle and whipped cream, left no need for syrup. 

My boyfriend allowed me to snag a potato from his skillet dish. Deep fried, crispy little nuggets were the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yolk from his over easy eggs.

I was a little overwhelmed when I first saw the menu but probably only because I haven't been to a diner in forever. They have a good variety of dishes and they come in big portions so I recommend ordering a bunch and sharing if you're eating as a group.

Honey coconut chicken waffle: 3/5. It wasn't bad but there was nothing memorable about it. I wish the chicken was a little crispier! The waffle was pretty good with the honey butter but I've definitely had better chicken and waffles elsewhere. 

Farmer's smoked sausage omelette: 3/5. The sausage was tasty but omelette itself was meh. I felt like I could make this myself at home and it would taste better (maybe...)

Blueberry's meat lover's skillet: 5/5. This was probably my favorite dish. The sausage, bacon, and ham were seasoned very well with the potatoes and veggies (onion, green peppers, and tomato) and the eggs on top came out perfectly. EGGPORN. It also comes with a sauce on the side (I think salsa?) that added some more flavor too. 

Biscuits and gravy: 2/5. The gravy itself was good but the biscuits weren't as crispy or buttery as I expected. Just seemed like regular bread and was actually too soft for me. They give you a lot though...

Chocolate Oreo pancakes: 5/5. We ate this last, kinda like as a dessert. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and actually wasn't too sweet! The vanilla icing drizzled on top added a ton of sweetness but I really enjoyed it. Good amount of Oreo pieces sprinkled on top as well. It comes with 4 big pancakes so I recommend sharing.

I would give this place 3.5/5 but since the prices are reasonable and the portions are big, I think 4 stars is fair. There was a line when we went on Saturday around noon so expect a wait!",Rhlbsy95KOu26BvL4U8Ftw,0,0,4,910_m6c2YJwNvBg5h-Sdrg

2157392,2016-07-13,0,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"Blueberry Hill is an awesome breakfast/lunch/dinner joint all around. It is the place you bring family for Sunday brunch, it is the place where you come post a night of crazy partying on the strip, and it is the place you bring all your friends who have heard you raving about this ""Vegas Gem"" for years. This was the case for me during my road trip to see ""Britney: A Piece of Me"" a few weeks back. As our last meal in Vegas, I can proudly say everyone in my party was pleased with the recommendation I pushed on them since the beginning of our mini vacation.

           We came in on a Saturday and there was no wait. What??? No wait on one of the busiest brunch days of the week: extra brownie points!  We were seated quickly and our waiter almost immediately came out with iced waters for the entire table. He proceeded to take our drink orders, which he too brought out with the speed of light. Since we are all a group of avid foodies, we had previously studied the menu through Yelp and pretty much knew what we were getting. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Pancakes (my staple choice at this here restaurant), while the rest of my group went for more savory options. The Chocolate Pancakes stand out due to what they deliver; a chocolate indulgence at its finest. There is not one bite lacking chocolaty galore when it comes to these bad boys. As for the rest of my friends' orders, one of my besties (who managed to convince the rest of the five to give this restaurant a go) ordered the Potato Benedict, which she deemed as ""one of the best Benedicts"" she has consumed to date. I tried a bit of the biscuits and gravy off of my friend's dish and ""oh la la"", so so scrumptious. At the end of the meal, everyone was a happy camper and ready to hit the road with full bellies. Food Coma defined!

       We all tipped our waiter decently because the man was excellent. This is a trend of Blueberry's all around: excellence in service, food, and ambiance (such a relaxing, homey vibe). Five stars all the way! Sadly, I have yet to try the cakes, pies, or cheesecakes. Next time! There will always be a next between me and Blueberry Hill.",sG_QJc8xThP3qXFg7sG2Ww,0,0,5,ruj3chQv2ObYOH7w7x4sjQ

The gravy is easy to make and very basic but tasted OK, as it should, though, nothing special. I ordered over medium eggs and they were over hard. I'm very particular about this having been a breakfast cook for many years. The chicken fried steak I could almost guarantee was frozen and not fresh but not because of the flavor. It tasted good but just a guess from other hints. Didn't matter about that but was just disappointed that all of the homemade things were not standing out like they seemed so proud of. If it weren't for the nicely cooked frozen fried steak, my rating would be lower. So, if they didn't try bragging that it's all homemade, I probably would've never known and possibly given higher.

Generally this is a breakfast spot for us. They have fancy pancake concoctions that keep my other half intrigued, while I go for the savory breakfast items, ranging from steak and eggs to breakfast skillets to huevos rancheros etc. 

Coincidentally, years ago this is the first place we tried that exotic concoction known as chicken and waffles. Fried chicken served over a Belgian waffle was unexpectedly delicious. These days everyone has taken it to new levels, bacon sriracha cheese waffles etc...but sometimes the original is more satisfying.

Quite reminiscent of NY diner food, open 24/7: I've been a fan since my office was walking distance years ago. Great place to go for breakfast all day, or when you have a group who can't agree on a specific cuisine, or breakfast, lunch, or dinner, for that matter, etc. 

Cheesy, well-worn and outdated decor is alright when you are being served fluffy pancakes, crisp waffles, good burgers, AOk soups and tasty sammies by cheerful wait staff. Exactly what it is supposed to be: comfort food whenever you want it. My folks frequent the Decatur location, and I've found them consistently good, too. The strawberry malted (extra thick, with blender cup on side) always makes me happy = do it! 

* if you order sammies that come with mayo: 'on the side' is a good call here, they slather it on (blech ;) *

** they can deliver true, soft scrambled eggs = why can't everyone?!?! **

*** 24/7 just about anything you could order in a diner on E Coast *** 

**** portions trend gargantuan; bake fresh daily muffins & desserts ****

2589271,2017-08-17,5,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"I've lived in Vegas for nearly four years now and have always wondered if Blueberry Hill was well, legit! I drive past it all the time and it never dawned on me that this place might in fact be good! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner is offered here and this place is definitely a mom-and-pop style diner that locals as well as tourists enjoy. It's a good option for tourists who are looking to dine off of the Strip. Plus, it's open 24 hours!

I convinced my family to come here one night for a late dinner and after our experience, I'm still not sure if I'm a fan or not. The menu is very expansive and well designed. The tabs make it easy to flip through the different categories. 

I ordered the Blueberry Hill-Style Monte Cristo Sandwich- Turkey and ham smothered with Swiss cheese, grilled on French toast bread that apparently isn't deep-fried or breaded. First of all, the serving sizes at Blueberry Hill are huge! My sandwich looked overwhelming and was packed with meat. I mean PACKED! There was so much turkey and ham that it was hard to take a bite! I definitely was not able to finish my meal, especially with the thick French toast. It was good, but I don't think I would order this again because after a few bites, the taste became old.

My dad ordered the Downhome Dixie Meatloaf which also seemed to be a bit overwhelming. It looked extremely rich, but he enjoyed it. My mom however, was not satisfied with her steak and eggs because it was cooked too long. It was on the dry side, but our waitress was very apologetic and compensated for her meal.

The customer service was friendly, but I feel like they were understaffed at the time. There were only two waitresses on shift during our visit and although it was 9 o'clock at night, I felt as if they should've been more prepared as more guests started to flow into the diner.

If you just want pancakes, order any of the pancake specials or any omelette with a side of pancakes!  I absolutely love this location because of the ambiance. 

The service is top-shelf!! I have never had any bad experience with any waiter, and believe me, they know the menu in and out. They are very friendly and make feel welcomed. Nothing bad to say about the service, theyre just pretty damn good at it.

This is my third visit to this location and every time the food has been good and the service decent.  This was no exception.  The service was friendly, but not awesome, but they have this TREMENDOUS menu.  Seriously, it's huge and the food is delicious.  This time I stepped away from my usual fried egg and toast breakfast and ordered the Full House.  This came with 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links and two crepes. 

The crepes are filled with a cheese mixture and a hot fruit compote.  I'm not a big fan of fruit in my food, especially mushy sweetened fruit, but I was hoping maybe they had orange or peach.  No, strawberry, blueberry or apple.  While I normally would never order something with strawberries in it (I like 'em fresh, but not fake flavored stuff), I went with the strawberry, which really made our waitress happy, by the way.  I'm glad I did because these crepes were DEEEELISH!  Seriously good.  My scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and perfectly salted.  The bacon was crispy and the sausage flavorful.  I LOVED my meal.  My friend ordered the same thing only with blueberry and she loved it, too.  The husband ordered the turkey club sandwich and the bread came out perfectly lightly toasted and he enjoyed his food.

My friend picked up the check, but I think it was about $30 for the three meals and one iced tea. Not coffee shop CHEAP, but affordable and with the great food, a total value.

Pretty much you can get almost anything you can imagine to eat here.  It exceeded my expectations for a coffee shop which is why I am a fan and will be back!

The pancakes were fluffy with he perfect taste and I don't even like pancakes!! 

My waiter was pretty terrible unfortunately . He continuously forgot my mom's order (he asked her 3x's) we waited 15 minutes for coffee when it's the first thing we ordered, and we didn't get our juice until our meal was almost over when we ordered it with the meal. It wasn't too busy. We came on a Saturday around 12 but the waiter was just not very attentive to our party.

It's Jan. 2, 2009 and I'm picking up my friend for breakfast before taking her to the airport for her flight back to SF.  Then I gotta head to work for an assuredly boring day.  But who cares about all that because there's nothing like a four egg omelet with ham and bacon (Texas Omelet) to get your day started.  Let's not forget the mound of hash browns and side of toast with jelly to complete the oh so satisfying meal.  Oh, and the portions were made for people who enjoy eating!  

Although I'm not much of a pancake fan, I really, really enjoy breakfast food.  My friend did order the fresh blueberry pancakes after a couple of minutes of tortured decision making between blueberries or strawberries.  At first I thought it odd that her meal consisted of just the pancakes and nothing more.  Then I saw the pancakes and it all made sense.  4 large fluffy blueberry gooey pancakes was more than enough.  There was no way she was taking that home with her so she gave me 2 and all I gotta say is Mmmmmm Mmmm!

Hmmmm... dang.  I just made myself hungry and Blueberry Hill sounds really good right now.",tEOocFvY0-i0I0gHyqNk_g,0,0,4,oV6eV0WeMd8QOC9eHXx1jg

Multiple locations throughout Las Vegas. Most of the time it's seat yourself. Busy times you wait to be seated. The menus are on the tables. Best described as a regular Denny's/IHOP/diner. No decor, no wow factor, just tables and booths. The menus is huge! No seriously like 10 pages and everything is available 24/7. 

The food is good. The cakes are homemade and have yummy buttercream frosting. The cakes are heavy and moist so you know there is nothing healthy, fat free, lite, or sugar free. My favorite is the strawberry cake. 

The sandwiches are ok. The fries ok. The onion rings are beer battered. I had ordered the meatloaf sandwich that comes with cheese, country sausage gravy, onions on a roll. It's huge but I didn't like it that much. The meatloaf had ketchup on it and the mashing of ketchup and white gravy doesn't mix well to me. 

Breakfast is where this place shines!!!! And like I said its 24/7. I love their breakfasts, the giant pancakes, the waffles, the country fried steak. I'm a happy camper with breakfast and cake here!!! I love crepes!!! And this time I had the crepe dealer with strawberry compote. Comes two crepes, eggs, choice of meat. And I added a side of hash browns. The fresh fruit crepe is really good too!!! I wish they had a savory crepe. 

I've been here a bunch of times. If you go on Sunday make sure you get there early or afternoon the church crowd gives a huge wait to be seated.",KMddoqBFJ2h9AYbaetprFg,1,1,4,_teXVeP3fN6aoqmIS-NJ-w

Take the biscuits and gravy, for instance.  The ""biscuits"" are gigantic, rectangular cakes of some sort of cooked and possibly also pan-fried not-quite-biscuit dough.  The sausage gravy was decent, but a lot of milk and flour and thin on the sausage.  This is pretty nominal example of such a dish compared to what one can cook at home in ten minutes, and the potatoes, pancakes, omelets, and other dishes we had were similarly okay-but-not-that-great.",7JAdkaWbXuXA4YULqxKaMg,1,0,3,8Se8uExCbc7HsAv9fhGJsA

When you walk in, it truly does remind you of walking into a Denny's, Norm's, or any other chain diner type establishment, though Blueberry Hill is a family owned operation. Our waitress was sweet, but firm, being from NY (as she was proud to tell us), she didn't put up with much, but got the job done and it was refreshing to be honest with you. She was there to do her job, and she was compensated (tip) with the service she provided. We sat on the counter as we were hungry and counter locations are normally a quick seat and serve, and you're on your way at most places. 
I ordered the Texas Omelette which is an omelette topped with Texas chili, American cheese, and onions. It was accompanied with a stack of fluffy (3) pancakes and I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy on the side. The omelette was pretty good, but I enjoyed the pancakes and biscuits the most out of my meal on this visit. The biscuits and gravy had a nice sausage and pepper flavor without it being overly salty like most places. There was so much food I ended leaving half for my finacee to eat back at our hotel.

The waiter was fast and attentive even on a busy brunch. Coming from Phoenix and whenever we are back in Vegas we definitely will be stopping @Blueberry hill. 
Not a lot of owners will take the time of day or extra money to put in on the presentation of the meals, impressed by the garnishment they put on plates you don't see that anymore at restaurants.
I was so full but I was so tempted to try one of the yummy looking pies.

One of the worst experiences I've had dinning in Vegas... this is the reason you dont leave the strip to get food

After my sisters Bachelorette party and her fiances Bachelor party we all decided to grab lunch before heading back to LA. 
we were 7 girls, 10 guys. The guys had gotten there first and they had set them up on 4 tables next to each other. When we got there the man at the door very rudely told us that we are not allowed to go in until they figure things out. So we wait... 5 min later no one came to get us so we went in and joined the boys... 

Waitress was soooo slow. It took her over 15 min to ask us for drinks... then another 20 to bring it... 

We ordered our food, some people at the table got food, some didn't.., 
We had to remind her 5 times to bring BBQ sauce... Reminded her 4 times that one of the girls didn't have a fork... 

Then we find HAIR in the food!!! GROOOOSSSS... we had to send it back, did we get an apology? NOPE... she gave us attitude took it back, and then brought another plate after 10 min.

Food was not that great either, I got a caesar salad, for some reason on the menu it said with tomatoes and onions... I asked for no onions.. it came with onions, I didnt complain just picked them out.. and no cheese or croutons on it.. =/ Not satisfied... 
Rest of the food that everyone else got was just ok! nothing special... 

Asked for refills on the water, didn't get them until after the check was given! 

The waitress was rude, slow, and didn't bring us anything we asked for... top it off no silverware, one was dirty, and there was hair in the food... will I be back? Take a wild guess!! NOPE",dpdZv_onv01trYSylxQi-A,5,4,1,5-RAQYpipsZVdqfkVRavGQ

Every time I come here, I get fast service, delicious food, and I can get out the door spending less than $15 after tip. Try doing that on the Strip anymore. You can't.

It's busier on the weekends than on the weekdays, and depending upon the time of night the patrons can be entertaining in their state of inebriation.

I customized the hell out of my order, which was met with open ears and a ready pen. The food was yummy, the coffee was strong and the service was delightful. 

Ordered - Chocolate Chip pancakes, next time will order just one. Also had the coconut honey chicken tender things, without the waffle, and enjoyed that. Had a side of bacon (I'm beginning to feel insecure about the amount of food I ate) and some toast...(cuz yeah I needed the carbs, not really). 

I bet the prices are good here, I don't know really because I don't understand money all that well. I just charge things to my card and then Obama pays my card off. So yeah, you'll have to decide for yourself on that one.

3677251,2014-02-06,3,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"REVIEW #1,000 - Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant deserves this spot!

After an early morning phone message from our hotel trying to sell us spa services, we were out of bed and ready to get out of that casino once we were done at their gym. We stopped at Chase to get some cash, and only then realized it was getting late and we hadn't eaten yet. Blueberry was visible from the bank's location so we excitedly headed there. As we walked in, the hungry husband and myself were happy to see it wasn't packed, but wasn't empty either.

I ordered two eggs, hashbrowns and sourdough, with a side of the hot house salsa and a roasted jalapeno. (I had seen one in the menu pictures and had to have it.) It didn't take long for the hot food to arrive and our waitress told me they'd roasted 2 jalapenos for me! Yumm. These were no ordinary jalapenos. I don't know how they found huge, gigantic jalapenos, but they were awesome. Really hot, too!  

Everything on the plate was yummy. My hashbrowns were cooked crispy and the sourdough was decent (it's hard to judge sourdough outside of the Bay Area because we really have the best stuff there!) The salsa was so good too! I could only eat one of the oversized jalapenos but our nice waitress brought me some Saran Wrap so that I could take the other one with me. 

Service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. I wish I knew her name, but the receipt only says ""Server #8"" 1/29/14 12:59 p.m.  People like her are the reason we enjoy going out to eat so often.  ($20.71 total for our breakfast.)",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,9,7,5,rBWmjufTlpDuhjs86bE6mw

The fire department folks eat here (good sign). 
Two busy windows for hot food slamming out of the kitchen (another good sign). 
A not too long line of people waiting for a table (a great sign as far as I am concerned). 
Soooo... 
I grabbed a seat at the counter right away. A few dirty dishes still present, but no prob. My server cleared them away at the same time as asking my beverage order. All good. 
I ordered bacon and eggs with some pancakes on the side. 
Eggs scrambled just right (NOT whipped all yellow) and bacon. Bacon was a bit thin, but all and all good. 
The pancakes you ask? GET THE PANCAKES! Fluffy battery buttery syrupy goodness! 
Service was nice and smiley with promptness thrown in.

I posted a picture of the potatoes that were left over - waaaayyyy too many. I really would have liked more meat and veggies. I also ordered a side of country gravy, which the menu said you could order a side for free, but I was charged an extra $2 so that was disappointing. The biscuit I got on the side was huge and delicious. I would honestly go back just for biscuits and gravy.

Came here for a hearty breakfast Sunday morning prior to leaving Vegas and glad I did. The menu was quite overwhelming sooo much to choose from. One thing I loved about their menu is everything is included in their meals they dont try to nickel and dime you for extras. All meals are complete for eg. you came for pancakes well you get pancakes, eggs, bacon and potatoes for under $12

My wife ordered the 1-2-3 biscuit meal after all she loves biscuits and gravy these were the best shes had. Meal came with 2 huge biscuits smothered in gravy along with bacon and eggs. Sh ordered a side of potatoes. The gravy was served thick with bits of sausages inside. The Biscuits were buttery, salty and Flaky; perfection. She also enjoyed the breakfast potatoes we asked for crispy potatoes blueberry did not dissapoint they were served hot, crispy outside soft inside. 

I opted for the burger-steak with potato pancakes and eggs. Portion was HUUUUUGE! and deeeeeelicious. Loved the flavors all infused together. Biscuits on the bottom potato pancakes in the middle and burgersteak on top I asked for my gravy on the side. Get this one you will not finish it and you will not be dissapointed. The burgersteak was cooked perfectly goood steaky flavor. Potatoe pancakes were soft and crispy, again biscuits soft, salty and flaky with thick gravy; eggs were eggs honestly could have this meal without eggs sooo much food.",twx2ZgFUbat87vGQ_tFbPA,1,0,5,LsR0r3NCz0Gznife_Cvj0w

Our waitress was FANTASTIC.  She was perfectly attentive, and very warm & friendly, especially since she had to work on Christmas night!  WELL DONE!  

The food was delicious, and the bill fit our budget nicely.  A HUGE PLUS is that this location is open 24 hours--surprisingly for a town like Las Vegas, not all Blueberry Hill locations are open all night!  For a quick, delicious bite off-Strip and away from the hustle and bustle of tourists, come here.  You'll find mostly locals who aren't impressed with noisy drunkards and gluttons looking for the cheapest buffet.  There's lots of free parking, too.  

To maybe even come close to a 5-star rating:
1. The facilities could use a remodel.  Nothing too crazy and huge, but just enough to distinguish this place from Denny's or IHOP.  
2. Serve Coca-Cola products.  I prefer Coke over Pepsi, and I know that's a personal preference, but having both options really rocks for everyone who drinks soda!  
3. Some of the products are on the cheap side.  (The shredded cheddar cheese is OBVIOUSLY processed cheese, and tastes like powdery American cheese.)  I know that the ingredients need to be cheaper to keep costs down, but hey, that's one thing that separates 4-star and 5-star establishments in my book.",AZUF5EVwh-W08nrFTbKM4A,5,4,4,i5_BEzNivNmUpLq2U3l0iw

4038997,2017-01-03,0,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"When you go to Las Vegas as a tourist, you go to the strip or maybe Fremont, or, if you're exceptionally bizarre, one of the hundred floating smaller casinos orbiting in the cash-burdened gravity of the big hotels.   And when you read five star reviews, you expect L'Atelier or Carnevino or any of the other big name establishment restaurants monikered by a big-time chef.  You'd be right to, and this isn't an attack on those places, places that offer some of the best eating in the country.  Instead, this is in praise of the café, of the appreciably local, of what separates Flamingo, Tropicana and Fremont from what is otherwise an ordinary American town.  

Blueberry Hill is that place, an excellent café with experienced wait staff, quality food, and without the adornments you find in more classically targeted tourist locations.  The plates are the same speckled white-ish gray you seem to find in these places but no where else.  

We went with the biscuits and gravy, coffee and the waffle with blueberries.  Everything was fantastic.  It all came out hot and we all left stuffed.  Blueberry Hill is quickly becoming an every trip stop, despite - or maybe because of - it's off-strip location and its complete lack of Vegas-style bells and whistles.",MQ-tlhFREIhSSVF9-1urUw,0,0,5,ffbgUPTn4Gbj7Ea5X07v7w

4063026,2017-01-30,7,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"Definitely one of my favorite diners to eat at! I would come here about once a week when I lived in Vegas, so I was able to try many of their items on their very large menu. Although they have several of these restaurants in town, I would regularly go to the one on Flamingo and Maryland Parkway. This location is open 24/7.

I've come here first thing in the morning and late in the afternoon. During the weekend and during the work week and they never seemed to be too busy. Yes of course Sundays they are pretty packed for breakfast, but I've never had to wait to be seated. I staff here are very quick to clean tables and to seat people, so to keep the flow running smoothly and to make sure no one has to wait too long. 

Every time I've been here, I always feel welcome and like a valued customer. The waitress/waiter are always very friendly and helpful with any questions that you may have. They make suggestions based off of what you like or looking for. They are very familiar with the menu and can help with anything you ask. Orders are taken quickly and food is brought out in a very timely manner. Even on busy days, I don't think I've waited more then 5-10 minutes for my food. 

First thing I should mention about their food is that the portions are HUGE!! I wish they offered half orders as I was never able to finish anything that I ordered. Most of their items come with sides, so that even makes for more food. Not complaining as I'd rather have more and take home what I didn't eat, then to leave till hungry.

One of my favorite things to order here was their skillets. I've had the Meat lover's, Denver and Sausage skillets. All of the are so delicious!! Made with their potatoes, peppers, onions and the different meat based off of the one you pick and eggs. I always did the over easy eggs. All of their skillets come with tortillas. You can ask for corn or flour. I preferred the corn. 

Another favorite of mine was their Turkey BLT with a side of curly fries. Sandwich was perfectly made, with just the right amount of everything. I would eat maybe half of this sandwich as it's ginormous. The fries are perfectly made and are just right crispy.

Some of the many other things I've tried here is their French toast, Meatloaf sandwich (not a fave of mine as I'm not big on meat), Chicken noodle soup, baked ham and cheese sandwich, Egg Benedict (another great item), several of their omelettes, pancakes (delicious), wraps and their Chicken cutlet and spinach fettuccine Alfredo. Most of the items I've tried here are well cooked and tasty. I can't really remember anything negative about any of the food as far as how it was prepared. I may not have liked something because of personal preference. 

The staff make sure to keep the place looking clean. When someone leaves, they clean up right after them, even sweep under tables. This is something I like to see, as I've been to many places that even though the tables may be cleaned off, the floor under it is full of food and napkins. Bathrooms are always cleaned and stocked with the necessary items. 

Will come back when I'm back in town!!

Thanks you to the staff for making my experience here always a pleasant one.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,11,10,4,kpDJ9Tke-6OFJJezXVoFoQ

I usually get it with a biscuit which are large and fluffy and a side of country gravy that is thick and flavorful ( especially if you come for lunch or dinner , for me the thicker the better ) , their pancakes are also a good choice as they are huge and make a good compliment when slathered in butter or the occasional sourdough toast also slathered in butter , lol . I usually ask for a side of their homemade salsa to give it all a little kick . The service here has always been good except one time late next night .

Quality.  I went in around 5:30 in the evening and the restaurant was basically empty.  That should have been my first clue.  I ordered a meatball sandwich with fries and a dinner salad.  The salad came out first and was nothing special.  I had Italian dressing and it was far to oily.  Hardly any vinegar to speak of.  It left a weird coating in my mouth that was rather unpleasent.  But I ate it because I don't like wasting food.  My meatball sandwich and fries came out looking impressive but was a bit underwhelming when I ate it.  Sure, there were a lot pf big meatballs on a nice sized roll.  And there was just the right amount of sauce.  Meat sauce to be precise.  No shortage of meat here.  The issue I had with this sandwich is that it wasn't hot.  Just luke warm.  The cheese had already coagulated.  How long was this thing under the heat lamp?  At least the fries were good.  Though after eating the oily salad and the luke warm sandwich I was too full to eat all of my fries.  I guess that is a mark in the win column.

My friend said that Blueberry Hill was a great family owned restaurant, and since I'm all for supporting local businesses, I was game.

We grabbed the last 2 seats at the counter because we didn't feel like waiting for a booth. This turned out to be a good call... less than 5 minutes later, the line spilled out into the parking lot which seemed like a sign that this place was the bees-knees.  

EH. 

The menu is expansive and resembles the 25 page menu at The Cheesecake Factory where you're presented with so many options that you're incapable of making a decision. 

Pricing was very reasonable by Vegas standards.

I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak omelet ($11-$12) which turned out to be filled with sinewy beef portions. It wasn't horrible, it just took too much effort. The portions, however, are gargantuan and worthy of splitting with a friend. 

They serve a decent cup of coffee, along with all the flavored creamers you could ask for. 

Essentially, Blueberry Hill is a glorified IHOP. I don't necessarily mean that in a negative way because I love IHOP pancakes and will likely serve them at my wedding reception someday. However, I can assure you that you won't be laying on your death bed wishing you patronized Blueberry Hill at some point in your life.

Unfortunately, we got seated within earshot of a woman with the most annoying laugh I've ever heard on this planet in 29 years. It sounded like a hyena in the throes of lust with a frightened chimp. We looked lost in the gargantuan menu, so she made a few suggestions based on what we wanted. I went with 2 blueberry pancakes, 2 scrambled eggs and 3 strips of bacon. I really wanted the banana pancakes, but they couldn't be ordered in a combo. Crapola. 

The food came up fast & hot - but the quality greatly varied. My blueberry pancakes were divine. The cakes were pillowy and moist, drenched with a blue viscous syrup and liberally peppered with fresh blueberries. No syrup required here - these cakes need to be eaten au natural. My eggs were.... eh, gross. I wish they weren't, but they were. I don't think they'd been properly cooked, so they were a little on the ""runny snot"" side in terms of consistency, and they tasted funky. The bacon was neither super crispy nor soft & chewy; it was just kinda there. There for me to eat. So I ate it. Luckily, the pancakes were so large that I was able to start on them, take a break to eat everything else, then go back to finish them off and to get the taste of the eggs out of my mouth. 

If I were to come back here again, I think I'd only order something pancake related. Being a protein hound, this isn't my ideal breakfast, but their pancakes are really friggin' good. I'll probably return one more time to get the banana cakes, but that'll likely be the end of my relationship with Blueberry Hill. The rest of their food is decidedly mediocre, but the pancakes are mouth watering and the service was exquisite.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,2,2,3,9VZ93Qon5zATa3ShrY3QRw

When our server handed us the syrup, the bottle was already sticky and dripping all over the table. One of our spoons were dirty. The service did not compensate. Our server, a lady who wore her platinum blonde hair in a pony tail, came off a little harsh. I asked her if it was possible to get both the omelette and the hash browns in one order and she just told me to read the menu instead of pointing out a suggestion. The dishes I was looking at included pancakes, which I said I didn't want. She replies on this sassy voice, ""You won't get pancakes."" Ok, cool. I didn't want them anyway. Instead of encouraging us to buy more, she warned each one of us that we wouldn't be able to finish the food. Guess what? At the end, though the food wasn't good, the plates were licked clean.

The ""homemade"" blueberry muffin tasted as if it was a mixture of Krusteaz and cement. I ate two bites of that brick twelve hours ago and I've had the displeasure of constant ""reminders"" of its taste every few minutes since then.

I ordered The Alamo which was three small breakfast burritos that managed to rank below McDonald's similarly plasticine product in taste and texture. The beans that came with it were a brownish-gray paste that I have to admit I didn't have the courage to consume.

My friend ordered eggs and hash browns and was pleased. But then, she's not writing this review. This was, by far, the worst meal I have ever had in Vegas; and I've eaten the $3.99 steak and eggs special on Fremont Street.

A friend and I came in around 1:30pm for breakfast for lunch. Half of the restaurant was being used and that half was pretty busy. Busy is a good sign, I guess. 
It was quite a bit of a wait for our food. I noticed other parties who came in after we did receive their food first. When the food finally came, I was disappointed in the size and quality of the breakfast skillet. It was not very hot, and the potatoes were greasy. They skimped on sausage and peppers, and the scrambled eggs on top looked as if they had been shrunk dry. I've received much better skillets from Denny's, and theirs aren't great either.

Four pieces of chicken covering each of the quarters of waffles.  Strawberry compote (from crepes) went fabulously well with this ridiculous combination. I kept thinking these disparate mealtime pieces had no business being together.   I was so wrong.

The four cheese (cottage, cream, sour&?) crepes (two) filled the plate. Just the right amount of sweet to savory balance.  It came with choice of fruit compote. I chose strawberry on the side.  I like to taste the main part before dousing it with something all to sweet.  Good thing.  'Cause my Partner-in-Dine used it on her chicken and waffles.

She also ordered cheese fries (not on menu and not a problem).  We expected cheddar cheese but got American which, was just as good.

My crepes came with three eggs and my choice of crispy bacon.  Done right.  Everything from greeting upon entry to accommodating both of our particular preferences with a smile and speed.  No sense our server was hiding an eye roll.  She made us happy and made us believe she was happy to serve us.

We will be back.

And the next day we were.  To a different location this time.  My First PID had the Veal Parmigiana.  The veal was nearly 3/4 inch thick and the batter was thin and crispy.  Too often it is the reverse.  PID2 had to try the Chicken and Waffles.  He is picky about this kind of thing, too.  He finished them off.  I had eggs & bacon cooked exactly as I ordered (I am finicky about this, as many other things) and pancakes so light, fluffy, sweet, and HUGE.  I couldn't finish it all.  Unusual for me not to leave a clean plate.  But, I was so full there was just no way.

Of everything we needed like Ketchup, hot sauce, salt n pepper, Cream and many kinds of sweeteners.

4709153,2018-01-17,0,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"This was my third visit to this restaurant and it's been worse with each visit! The only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 star is because the food tasted okay.

It was a little busy, but this was not a good visit! I'll just be brief rather than mentioning all of the annoyances of this visit.

I told her that my mother couldn't eat a whole waffle (she's 88) so I wanted to order a half of waffle.  I knew they sold 1/2 waffles as it was shown on the kids menu for $1.00, our waitress (server #10) said she couldn't sell us that and I said that's fine, but you must have 1/2 waffle she can get since she won't eat a whole one. I told her I wanted it with the fruit composite, an order of bacon and 1 egg. I had a crepe.

Our waitress brings us our two cups of coffee while waiting for the food, the coffee tasted like it had been sitting there for over an hour! I took one sip and moved it to the edge of the table, could not drink such a bad cup.

I told the waitress the coffee tasted really bad and ordered a glass of merlot instead. She took away the full cup of coffee and brought me the glass of merlot.

This may all sound petty, but a GOOD waitress would've worked a combo for elderly to make her meal affordable, and would've gladly removed my coffee from the bill since I didn't drink it due to it tasting bad.

When the bill came, I mistakenly gave her my card without reviewing it.  I received the copy of the bill which just showed the cost:  $43.58 before tip. She didn't even include a breakdown with my copy. I certainly don't think this was worth $43.58:
1/2 waffle with fruit composite
1 crepe with 3 fruit combo
1 side of bacon
1 egg
1 cup of coffee (as she should not have charged for 2)
1 glass of merlot
My last visit here thanks to server #10

Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked yummy.

A guy next to me had the Chilaquiles Verde and my goodness Im gonna have to switch up how I eat breakfast.

Spoke with Phil (host) and he was so delightful.  Our server Violeta was very attentative to our needs.

First trip was on a Saturday later in the day.  Great, great service and amazing food.  The sourdough toast was so good, we asked our waitress if it was made on site.  She let us know it was purchased from Great Buns Bakery down the street, which we have bought from twice since our visit.  

We were so impressed with the service and the food, that we looked at this as our new go to family spot.  We had multiple breakfast items and chicken strips. 

2nd visit today, sucked!  We were immediately greeted and sat down.  The waitress overwhelmed by a family with 6 screaming kids at 2 combined tables came over and greeted us quickly; great right?  It went downhill from there.  We even questioned ourselves what did we do wrong that she seemed ""bothered and annoyed"" by us.  We were overly friendly and ordered simple items. I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with extra Alfredo sauce.  My daughter ordered the chicken strips with honey mustard.  When the waitress brought the food which was quit quickly there was no honey mustard and no extra Alfredo sauce, and I didn't notice until she had walked away.  As she was setting the plates down, I commented to her that on our last visit my daughter stated ""the chicken strips were the best she had ever had.""  While telling the waitress this she didn't even look at me, she was looking behind me out the window.  Really, really, hate that.  We waited at our tables for her to come back around for the sauces.  It was 8 minutes before she came back, and that was with flagging her down.  It took another 4 minutes to get the honey mustard and another 3 minutes after that for the Alfredo sauce.  

She brought us our check and then asked us which desserts we wanted that we had previously added to our meals . We ordered 2 blueberry muffins which were so delicious we decided to get 2 more to go.  The waitress came back over and I said to her "" Would it be too much of a problem to get 2 more muffins to go?""  She picked up the check, paused, and then said ""It shouldn't be.""  Really, it shouldn't be?  How about yes, yes, or yes.  

This waitress sucked and completely ruined our opinion of this place.  I wish I knew the name of the other waitress so I could call before coming to make sure she was working. 

I do have to say the Alfredo sauce had absolutely ZERO flavor and ZERO taste.  The best part of the Alfredo sauce she ""CHARGED ME FOR IT.""  If she had put it extra on the meal as I had ordered, I probably wouldn't have been charged for it.  This cost her a chunk of her tip!!!!",SJuSiO27FTKi5qKrNDa8Lg,0,0,3,Mu7iKmlkUihsEChLfcreww

In having gotten the blueberry pancakes for myself I was quite pleased with my meal (plus potatoes, eggs and sausages on the side), however others at my table got the cornbeef hash (ehh, ok), a Tex-Mex style omelet (ok), and other variations.

This was our third trip to Vegas and the more I go, the less I want to eat at a casino. The casino buffets are convenient but I always feel I just paid 25.99$ to eat at Old Country Buffet! 

Ate breakfast two mornings in a row. This place is open 24/7 and you can get any item at any time. First morning I had the Chicken Waffles, West Coast style, it's a big home made waffle with home made chicken fingers put on top of it with yummy salted butter scooped into it and you just pour the syrup over ever thing. Sweet and salty, very good! I was with friends and there was an order of steak and eggs with pancakes at our table. Their pancakes are amazing. Big, light, and fluffy  with big scoops of the salted butter... UMMMMM food coma! Oh yes and not to be forgotten coffee was excellent and service was amazing. Waitress was happy to serve us, and was always refilling coffee and water glasses. 

Second morning.... I wasn't in the mood for breakfast, we were getting ready to leave Las Vegas via car to Los Angeles and I didn't want anything too sweet. So I had the bacon cheese burger and fries.... excellent! Friends had the chorizo omelet and the other one had the french toast. I had thought their best plate was pancakes... I was wrong, the french toast was even better. Everything was perfect, right amount of being cooked, not soggy, not squished, not hard, cinnamon and powered sugar and then the salted butter on top.... it was the best french toast I've ever eaten.  

We will be back to Vegas at the end of our road trip and we plan on going back. The waitresses and the manager (or owner?) spent time talking to us and made us feel welcomed.  This is absolutely a don't miss when you are in Vegas.",-0vutwuE36iYMqM2wHaStQ,0,0,4,2SqilzkEAgLadM7Qu7rVog

Food, food, food is what you get here. Anything you order here comes in large portions! I made the mistake of ordering several things when I first came here as I didn't know they give you a lot. Love the fresh fruit waffles and pancakes, Classic Egg Benedict, Bacon and cheese omelet, Meat Lover's skillet, and so many more of the items. Can't go wrong with the food here and they have something for everyone. They are always willing to customize an order for you also if you don't like something that a dish comes with. Yum Yum Yum!

The wait staff here are nice, but usually super busy so you can be waiting around awhile for them to bring your drinks, food or just come around to check up on you. Some are more friendly and make sure their customers are happy and some are just there doing their job and nothing more. 

The building looks older, but not run down. The inside is older looking, but maybe they're trying to keep that ""diner"" look going, They have two sides which they usually keep only one side open if they don't have many customers. They don't have a problem with keeping the place full though, especially on the weekend. Tables are clean almost immediately when people leave so other people can be seated. Floors are kept clean and mopped when they need it. Bathrooms have always been cleaned no matter the time of day I've come.

4973808,2010-12-24,5,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"With seven Blueberry Hill Family Restaurants in town, we were bound to try at least one of them by now.

With four famished marathon runners, we needed a place to grub down and luckily someone suggested Blueberry Hill (a favorite for him).  He chose this location as his regular joint.

I was a little concerned with how long the wait might be on a Sunday around noon, but the wait was only ten minutes or so.  Thank goodness!

After getting seated, huge menus were given to us.  Woah!  This restaurant is open 24 hours and the menu reflects that.  There's a whole lot of menu to go through, especially the breakfast items alone!  Definitely take your time making your decision!

* Golden Stuffed French Toast "" Four thick wedges of French toast stuffed with cream cheese and lavished with your choice of fresh strawberry or blueberry or apple compote, or pineapple spiced rum and coconut compote."" ($7.79) - The French Toast was recommended by the regular and I went for the blueberry topping (obviously), although the pineapple spiced rum and coconut one did tempt me just a bit.  I loved the sweetness from the fruit topping and whipped cream, but then I would get this tangy sour taste from the cream cheese as well.  I wasn't sure if I was enjoying that part or not.  But I still ate it all up nonetheless! 

* Chicken Fried Steak Southern- Style ""U.S.D.A. Certified Choice breaded steak served over our new recipe biscuits and smothered in homemade country gravy.  Served with two extra large eggs and hashbrowns."" ($10.79) - The Husband is always getting these super fatty dishes and couldn't resist here either.  Although the menu says it served over biscuits, I couldn't really remember if it was and from the picture, I don't see any.  He did get a choice of bread with it and went for the sourdough toast option.  I do want to talk about that sourdough bread - they give out these thick slices of bread and they are yum!  

Service - pretty standard service for a busy diner during the weekend brunch rush.  She forgot the tea bag when our friend ordered the tea, but did come around with pots of coffee for refills.

They have seasonal specials to look out for - I think they had pumpkin pancakes on the menu when we went. Keep your eye out for the blackboard when you first walk in.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,7,4,86bqz6kzcW3fAUnoSmWkcg

She then returns with an excuse that she didn't want us to think that she forgot us, but that she was waiting for a fresh pot. A bit of communication would've worked.

It is not the nicest looking place. Fortunately, the Blueberry Hill is a good restaurant. I had their chicken special, which was sliced chicken breast on a bed of noodles, with some mixed vegetables. It was pretty average, but good quantity. I wondered if the place was popular with people who got liquored up. 

Then I tried their carrot cake. While I love carrot cake, this carrot cake was superb. It was frosted so well; not with a big thick layer of frosting but nicely frosted so it wouldn't kill the taste of the cake itself. The cake was well textured and moist. I wanted to have some ice cream with it, but I think I would have been carried out of the place.

Our waitress was attentive and provided us the food on time; meaning hot.

The server was very friendly and kept our glasses filled with our drinks.  I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon.  The biscuits were two of the biggest biscuits that I have seen (at home or at a restaurant), yet they were light, fluffy and very tasty.  In the end, I couldn't both of them, they were so big.  As a personal preference, I do wish the gravy was a little thicker, but that didn't detract from the taste at all.  The bacon was cooked just right, a little crispy but still juicy and not over cooked at all. 

Everyone at the table agreed that their meals were very good, no complaints about the food. The seats could have been a little more comfortable and the bathrooms needed more attention, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying a very good meal at Blueberry Hill.

Las Vegans are the true fans and there are reasons for that.  

 It never closes, it's affordable, pretty good quality, and their food is made in house.
Their menu is like a book offering Italian, Mexican, Greek and American cuisine.

I grew up surrounded by diners.  It made me feel like I was back east. Especially how they have their dinner specials plated in the front for displayed. greens wilted and gravy with a film from sitting there all day.
but i think it's deserves every bit of 4 stars. It's not EXTREMELY scrumptious but it's also not disappointing. It's a diner.

There is no need to settle on eggs if the craving for a burger is present. This allows for less bickering with your friends and more time to nurse that impending hangover.

Tonight, my friend and I shared an Alaskan Waffle with Apple Compote. The crispy yet fluffy waffle was layered with a thick serving of vanilla ice cream, heaps of warm apple pie filling, and a mound of whip cream. The hot waffle started to melt the ice cream, creating a wonderful sauce. 

This monster is definitely something to share. At a little over $9, it can easily feed two while leaving you feel comatose. 

Being so close to the university, this is definitely an old haunt that reminds me of many a drunken nights. The wait staff here know how to deal with this crowd of younger party goers.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,0,4,AfNRXcyiV34NJFoFLxTjlg

We sat down and after looking at the menu I was impressed with the selection and how tasty everything looked. The food came and it was mostly decent. There were a few problems such as finding spinach in one friends omelet (after she told them she was allergic), and some rotten & unwashed grapes in the fruit side. We managed to get through most of the meal and were fairly content. That is until each of the four of us began heading to the restroom with our stomachs churning before we could even leave. The food went right through each of us in a bad way taking away any previous good thoughts I had of the place. The only thing we each had were eggs so I'm guessing that might be the culprit. But after seeing the carelessness of the food we were served I think its safe to say they aren't following strict habits of cleanliness in this restaurant.

I was pleasantly surprised how clean it was in there versus what I was picturing because of the side of town it is at. We were immediately greeted by a genuinely friendly waitress (wish I got her name) then seated. All the menus and specials are already on the table for you to dive into.

They have a large menu...I mean, it's pretty extensive. If you know what you want, stick to it...once you start flipping through those pages persuasion kicks in resulting in indecisiveness. Well, that's what happen to me. Out of everything on that dang novel I opted for a chicken Caesar wrap. Surprise-Surprise! I was just torn because by this time it's nearly 130 in the morning and I didn't want to eat anything seriously that early/late. The wrap itself twas pretty decent. I had no idea they put onions in theirs. Felt a little bummed to bite into my wrap with the taste of onions (love onions just not in my Caesar anything).

The husband ordered their honey coconut chicken and waffles. He saw the words honey and coconut--done. He enjoyed it as the boneless chicken was moist. 

The mother ordered...I wasn't paying attention. Lol. But I did see some kielbasa like sausages on her plate, toast, eggs, and hash browns. The hash browns were probably a little.on the crappy side. But I say that because I like my hash brown to have a crispy top. Geez, I must've paid alot more attention to it that I originally thought.

Overall, I was impressed at the service, facility, and the food. I guess I had pretty low expectations. The service was definitely exceptional. Our waitress wasn't acting sluggish or giving you that geez I just wanna sleep body language. She clearly had her cup of coffee and genuinely felt happy to be at work.

There was a short wait for a table, but not too bad for a Sunday morning.  Our waitress was nice, but had a beer gut and looked like she hadn't showered recently.  The restaurant had a desert motif, which I thought was kind of strange.  I mean, sure, we're in the desert but the last thing I equate with the desert is blueberries.  Blueberries grow in cool moist places.  Not in places where your flesh will boil right off your body if you stand in the sun too long.  Anyway.  The bathroom was a little run down but still use-able.

Mixed reviews on the food.  My hash browns tasted sort of undercooked.  But the pancakes were phenomenally good.  I was mad that I didn't order them, and the boy probably was too since I kept stealing bites of his.

Overall, it's a nice place, but probably more like 3.5 stars, than 4 stars in my opinion. 

I would definitely come here again although I'm not sure my husband will be joining me. :/",gTQEvdmFvjpMR0KUmXQzzQ,1,0,4,RTp5x3kAqoTeKzURIvI3Sg

I clarified I didn't want Buffalo wings. Guess what I got? Not to mention it was 20 mins later. Our meals came 10 minutes after that. The food left a lot to be desired.

Very very extensive menu which explains the line out the door when I got there....I walked to the front and said I was happy to eat at the bar...seated immediately !!  I could see most of the dinner which was carpeted with booths or 4 person tables and looked decent.

Couple of beers and a salad with the HUGE turkey dinner with stuffing, gravy, mashed, cranberries, buns and I needed the long walk back to the flamingo to not feel so stuffed.

Their portion sizes are always very generous, no matter what you get. This most recent time, we went around lunchtime, so instead of getting the amazing chocolate chip, banana, or apple pancakes like I normally get, I ordered the roast beef special. I loved it! The roast beef was sliced thin, but not sandwich meat thin, and the gravy wasn't too salty. 

The rest of my family ordered breakfast and typically it would be a little questionable whether or not the portion size would be enough for my brother, since he's a big guy. But even he said he was full after not finishing it all. 

For me, whenever I go, it's always one of the aforementioned pancake choices or either of the meatloaf selections. And they never fail, it's always great. 

The only reason I gave them a 4 and not a 5 is because the tables are really squished in there and when I walk around, I always feel like I'm going to run into another table.

A local favorite.  There are several locations in town, but they all have a very Mom & Pop greasy spoon feel to them as if they were all independently owned and operated.  

For our first visit to this location, we tried out the 
- Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs with buttermilk pancakes and Blueberry Compote
- Chicken Fried Chicken & Eggs with Buttermilk pancakes.

I've gotta tell ya, they have some of the best chicken fried ____  that I've ever tried.  They use actual Steaks for the fried steak and not ground beef.  Both the steakand the chicken were tender and juicy,while the breading was light and crisp, not grease-soaked.

The Pancakes were good and the blueberry compote was not overly sweet like I've had at other diners.

Unfortunately, on this visit, the service wasn't all that friendly, they get a temporary ding for that pending a second visit.

So, about Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant...our visit here was a very good one.  We came for breakfast and a great breakfast we had!  Generous portions of good food with good service makes for good reviews and a lot of them out there on Yelp.  I would be inclined to agree and will be back in the future.",WeMMnl_xfAgB9Lc7aS5qWg,0,0,5,2cev6bMOL2_l3FURkUKwlA

For 4 adults the tab was $40 which is really good given all the food we ordered. Decent place, but the booth seats were made of hard plastic and were really hard. I have alot of cushing in my rear and my butt was unhappy with the seats. Overall decent food, decent service & good prices.",YyfIAWAdJhdwO0_xyiVkUQ,0,0,3,oXXN6BWDMGm7uLFJ4qb2tg

      Upon arrival, I was greeted by the Lucky Charms and Care Bear love child on the sign of the Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant sign (go there, you'll see), and was given the heebeegeebees and even more so when walking into a wall of humidity and being taken back to the 80's. Mini-blinds and purple seating; undoubtedly an old-timey diner. Nobody told me about that. Then being face to face with waxed plates of the days specials was a bit stomach turning as it was something I've never seen before. I wanted to turn back and probably just head to the IHOP parallel to the chapel but I remembered to keep an open mind. 
      Being seated immediately, I was pretty overwhelmed by the menu, in a GOOD way! So many tasty choices. It was 10AM, time for breakfast, maybe some French toast, perhaps a pastrami sandwich? The poor waitress had to come back twice for me to make a decision until I gave into my sweet tooth and got the Oreo Pancakes. No regrets. For a solid price, I got a generous amount of this so called Oreo pancake and boy, was it muy delicioso! Knowing I couldn't stay for lunch, I just had to get the pastrami sandwich to go!
       All in all, the food was fantastic and is a must have while at the strip, don't let the atmosphere intimidate you. Service was fast and friendly! Four stars!",WZXqDI0ykZKoch3bpe3nqA,0,0,4,pFbYHJ-OOqgvUZRpqI6weg

As usual when in Vegas I tend to travel off the Strip and dine with the Locals. This habit has never failed me yet for a meal, and after B H I'm still on a roll. I tried the  biscuits and gravy with the eggs over medium and bacon. Now while my breakfast was simple but good I saw some amazing looking things coming out of that kitchen. Pancakes and Waffles with various toppings, Omelettes that couldn't be believed by sight alone. It all had me doubting my own order. But rest assured mine was delicious. Huge home made biscuits (I couldn't finish one) creamy Sausage gravy and perfectly cooked eggs I was content. Service was very good and the prices are fair. Portions are rather large so feel free to split away. This place will be in my Vegas breakfast rotation.",XLD6kubIF2PxJf5s7cAzCw,0,0,4,JAZiL89tdHXJRLasaEMFDg

We had to leave early to drop someone off at the airport and decided to find somewhere close to our hotel to eat breakfast that would not cost $100. There was not a wait on Sunday morning at 8am. A nice young man selling the paper greeted and opened the door for us. We were greeted with good morning and sat right down. The waitress was fantastic. Worked harder than anyone in Vegas to make us happy. And the food! My word did they give us enough. It was great! Good diner style breakfast. The three year old was even impressed. Now that's impressive! Loved the kids coloring mat; it showed us the owners love Jesus also. What a great place! 5 Stars.,ZvvjC7biYiBo6QimXXy69A,0,0,5,b7EF2G0fsax4rsFq04kC1A

Got an omelette with spinach when we didn't sent it back then it stilled had spinach on it. I ordered pigs in a blanket and the sausage inside was extremely small when in the menu they mention it being large and savory.

5959337,2011-10-25,2,-WLrZPzjKfrftLWaCi1QZQ,"When I head to Blueberry Hill, I usually head to the one on Decatur that's closer to me, but this is a relatively good alternative. 

We came here after a long evening and not everyone was in the best mood since we were hungry and tired. The waitress was overwhelmed. Way too many tables for just two waitresses and one busboy from what I could see. She was friendly and tried be as attentive as she could given the circumstances. 

My omelet was ok, nothing spectacular but a solid meal. There was lots of meat and it was gigantic for the price. It did the trick. They have an enormous menu with everything your heart could desire to eat. I usually stick with the breakfasts, but they have a huge amounts of lunch and dinner options as well. When I'm looking for some very late night breakfast I usually head to Blueberry Hill. I also really enjoy breakfast as dessert. Nothing satisfies my sweet tooth like some french toast, crepes or pancakes, yum.

Everyone else in my party seemed a little perturbed by the service, but I really have to give them credit for doing the best they could while in the weeds and still keep an upbeat and positive attitude. 

Not the greatest restaurant, but hopefully the manager will put more staff during peak hours to take care of guests.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,2,3,QsnpigaP-MUkW6W5NauGLg

I have been many times, and never disapointed. Great hot and fresh food, and plenty of it. Service has been great for me, and they get you seated fairly quickly when there is a wait. The best part is that everytime I went, I was full, and it didn't cost me $12-$24 like the buffet does. So if you are in the mood for a great breakfast after a night in Vegas GO Here it is worth it. In my opinion it is the best breakfast in Vegas. I have not had lunch or dinner here so can't comment on them.",-dHiOppuk7pLYEqreeGE5A,0,0,5,DSGtKsWT6QGu3_wFWR-hAA
