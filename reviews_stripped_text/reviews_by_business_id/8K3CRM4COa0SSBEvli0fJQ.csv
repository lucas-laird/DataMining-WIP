The hostess was fantastic as soon as we walked in. She was friendly and alerted us to a nice booth that was just opening up, instead of just sticking us at any table.

Our waiter was very familiar with all the dishes and recommended his favorites, as well as commented on the wines we were considering.

Noticed that they have a 1/2 portion menu for a limited time that includes some of their huge portion items (like the Spanakopita).

This evening we opted for the small Indian section of the menu (I know, Indian at a Mediterranean restaurant??)  The Chicken Tandoori was very tender and the Mango Chutney dipping sauce superb.  The portion was perfect also. The Chicken Curry dish was excellent, although I would have preferred more chicken. That was my only knock on the meal, although for the price I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.

The atmosphere is quite nice. And for the hookah smokers out there, the lounge is a great stop.

SHAME! Maybe he should stop hosting parties for his friends and pay more attention to the customers whom are actually paying. 
Servers also don't like to come out to the patio area either. 
Been coming to Paymons for at least five years but this is bad.  He has become complacent.

In response to Jeff, I never called Paymon cheap, but the QUALITY of the coals. They are terrible. Even the employees complain. The couple times we have visited, it resulted in coals burning out within five minutes or less. THAT, is the problem I have along with the SERVICE, that can be slow. Do not try and insult me.

I was initially going to give this place no more than 2 stars, however the one thing I loved about this place is the decor. It's unlike any I've seen in the US, and I have been to plenty of Persian and middle eastern restaurants as well as hookah cafes. The ambiance and decor in the hookah lounge is absolutely stunning, however the hookah and the food are not. 

We ordered the koobideh jabab and gyro sandwich and both came out dry and way too spicy. The spices used in the koobideh tasted like Indian spices and any Persian that has had real koobideh knows it should not taste like that at all. The meat wasn't cooked all that great and the rice wasn't cooked properly either. 

I was very disappointed with the food, however the service was great- the young lady that helped us was very sweet and again the decor was beautiful.

187383,2010-08-04,0,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"After visiting various hookah bars since the ripe old age of 18 I can definitely say that Paymon's is by far the best I've been to.

The decor is awesome, Mediterranean themed with a very relaxed atmosphere. The comfy bench seating and throw pillows always make me feel at home. The only think I don't like is the tables and chairs made for little people. I am 5'10"" and the boyfriend is 6'5"" so when we go with a group of friends it is always a bit cramped. However, when it's just me and him we spread out comfortably. 

The hookahs are always smooth and tasty, at $15 each it doesn't get any better. I have tried hookahs at bars and clubs in town and they were no where near Paymon's standards and are usually double the price! 

The food is pretty good as well, I am not much into Mediterranean food except maybe hummus. The pesto hummus at Paymon's is delicious! You cannot go wrong with their ""Athens Fries"", the spices that they use to season the fries are out of this world! The drinks are so/so every specialty drink I have had has been overpowering or not the right flavor combinations so I stick to beer or pellegrino most of the time.

The service is hit or miss, sometimes it is excellent and other times we are waiting 45 min for a hookah or 30 min for drink refills. I guess it depends on who serves you. 

Paymon's happy hour is one of the best in town with $7.50 hookahs and half off drinks and appetizers. Tuesdays are locals nights where happy hour goes from 5pm-1am, just make sure you get there early since the place fills up fast!",H-QtPvPgVNUcuPKq8yAyCQ,1,1,4,FdptgbhB9ZjhIDOfUZQihw

335613,2007-06-15,0,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"I am not a smoker, but an occasional hookah is always fun with friends. The Hookah Lounge attached to Paymon's is THE hookah lounge in town. It is right next to UNLV which proved convenient for my study buddies and I when we needed a break from our rigorous study nights (ha ha). The dcor is fitting of a Mediterranean theme, and I especially enjoy the collection of small shoes hung about the room. There is so much to look, one could lose track of time inside. The windows are blacked out, and warm colors fill the room to add to the time distortion. There are about eight tables and two big booths for your hookah party. The best part is that they serve food from the restaurant side. A small bar is located toward the back, and one of their rinks was featured on $40 a Day with Rachael Ray. I can't remember the name, but it is tropical and sweet, and if you asked, I'm sure they would know which one you were talking about. It pairs nicely with a fruity hookah too. The Hookah Lounge is small and cozy and always a good time.

Paymon's could best be described as a middle-Eastern-fusion place, no that doesn't quite describe it. First of all the interior is breathtakingly beautiful; and the ambience is matched by the food. They have Greek, Italian, Indian, and Persian dishes (in alphabetical order), and sandwiches, all very reasonably priced. We started with a combination of dips and pita bread: hummus and yogurt-cucumber (actually tzatziki but who can pronounce that?). Next was the lentil soup with melted feta cheese. One of us had Tandoori chicken and the other had chicken curry, both out of this world.

Now an aside. There were two Las Vegas Metro Police officers seated adjacent to us, and that day was the day they buried one of two officers who, a week earlier, had both been shot in the head and killed while dining in a restaurant. Now the Las Vegas cops are awesome for what they do every day, but I can't imagine how it must feel to sit down for a restaurant meal, after that incident, not knowing if there's some other nutcase who's going to walk through the door and open fire on you. Of course, the fact that cops eat at Paymon's is a recommendation in itself.

I can't wait to get back to Paymon's and check out the rest of the menu, or maybe I'll order the Tandoori chicken the next dozen times. You really owe it to yourself to try this place, it's every bit as good as those fancy Las Vegas Strip hotel restaurants that bear the names of famous chefs who never visit.

The interior of Paymon's is well decorated and cozy, but it's not at all a snooty atmosphere and casual wear is perfectly fine (that said, I will say that I felt underdressed whilst wearing my hiking clothes and desperately needing a shower post-hike).

The prices are a little on the higher side, although apparently there is an all-you-can-eat pasta special for only $9 (it seems like a good deal to me, but I'm not a big pasta fan so I didn't order it).  A simple vegetarian pita sandwich with no sides runs on the order of ~$8-9. I had the Eggplant pita, and it was overall very good.  The ingredients (grilled eggplant and roasted red peppers) tasted very fresh and the pesto sauce had good flavor.  It wasn't the most overwhelming sandwich I've ever had, but I would be inclined to order it again.

The thing that stood out the most in my experience was the flaming saganaki (greek cheese).  That was FANTASTIC!  I am a fairly picky cheese eater, and was extremely happy when I tried this.  The texture was excellent with a crispy outside and gooey inside, and the cheese itself had a very elegant flavor.

When I moved to Vegas, Paymon's was the first restaurant I ate at.  It was absolutely delicious and has a wide variety of menu offerings.  I love the freshly wrapped grape leaves.  The chilled leaves have just the right amount of citrus and are firm.  

The lentil soup is savory and well balanced.  The soup itself can be very filling as a light meal.

The Athens fries.  Where do I start?  These fries are always served hot and thick.  They aren't too starchy and are coated with Paymon's proprietary spice blend.  They are served with a delicious sauce.

The spanikopita portion is huge.  The phyllo is flaky and the filling is rich and creamy.

The salmon tandoori comes complete with a huge mound of rice.  The salmon is plump and tender, cut into large cubes.  The tangy seasoning is great and well balanced.

Personally, I opt for the combination platter.  It is a little taste of everything, from falafel, fries, babaganoush, tabouli, bourrani an hummus.  It is served with fresh pita.

cold and limp, greasey. Gyro meat was old tasting, not fresh. Salmon was as thin as a flat piece of chicken breast, over cooked and dry. Don't waste your time

590749,2011-12-01,3,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"I used to go to the Paymons by UNLV fairly frequently when i lived on that side of town. My boyfriend and i were in the market for a new happy hour to check out, so i found this place on my mobile app. Regretting it greatly now.
First regret, the specialty cocktails. Margaritas were ridiculously too sweet, and i read through the ingredients. They use a mix i have used before, so i'm not sure how those got screwed up... and I'm a bartender. 
Next, we ordered the hummus as a starter, and it arrived surprisingly fast. Downside however was it was depressingly bland and oozy, not thick or flavorful at all. We figured oh well, the entrees should make up for it.
I ordered the gyro pita, accompanied by athens fries, my boyfriend got the pesto pizza. I couldn't pick up the thing, cuz it would probably fall apart, so i proceeded to make little mini pitas by tearing pieces of it and putting the meat, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce inside, very messy. I now realize that we were never given settings or napkins. Since my boyfriend had to go looking for our server a couple times, i said to hell with it and got some paper hand towels from the bathroom. My server saw me come back with said towels, and said nothing to us or checked in still.
Back to the food. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something was way off with the gyro meat, a little too 'chewy' i suppose, and barely warm.. the fries weren't really anything to write home about. My boyfriend said his pizza was basic and bland also.
The only time server finally checks on us, he rudely interrupted my boyfriend and i having a moment. We asked for a box and the check. In all honestly the only reason for the box was to give the food to the dogs.
The check arrived, and we were thrown for a loop. I have no problem paying for a quality fare, but we were under the impression that most of our items were on happy hour pricing. Nope. 2 drinks, hummus, pizza and my gyro came out to 50 bucks, wtf. I then got on here and learned that happy hour pricing was only on Tuesday nights. Another thing i came across in these reviews was that Weds nights are customer appreciation night and they take 25% off the final check.  Again, didn't happen.
We were over it at this point and just wanted to vacate. Again, my boyfriend had to go looking for our server,  who he said gave him an irritated look when we needed change. I always leave 20% as i am in the industry, and can understand that not all issues are the service staffs fault. In this case I'll admit I lowballed.
To make it even better, as we were getting some stuff at the gas station on the way home, i rapidly became unbearably nauseas and ran outside to throw up. Definitely won't be caught here again, i don't even think i feel safe giving the hounds the food anymore... that's bad.",bpY4-QvV6GBlA_HqfGFJ1w,4,4,1,EWqPU3hx_WeDcoDaoqgT6A

 After reading the reviews we ordered a side of Athens fries and hummus.  The fries are amazing especially with the dipping sauce. The hummus was fine however the pita bread was not so good.  The bread tasted as if it was reheated prepackaged bread not freshly made.   

For the main dishes we ordered the steak kabobs- medium and the gyros platter. Both were very tasty the steak was good quality meat and of big portion size.   They both came with rice and vegetables however I found the white rice to be bland tasting.

Maybe I got slighted because I went during the late night hours. The hummus and Athens fries are always good. They have loose leaf tea which is a plus, but the dinner entrees that myself and the rest of my party ordered were equivalent to overpriced Mediterranean fast food.

Ordered a chicken pita. It was alright, nothing extraordinary. Chicken was a bit dry and there was a lot of it, which explains why the pita was served in a paper wrap with printed instructions on how to eat it, so as to avoid a food explosion. It could have benefited from a bit more veggies and tsatziki, as there were only a few lettuce leaves and a sparse amount of tomato and sauce.

The others in our party ordered a brushcette salad with chicken that was also dry with very bitter and overdressed romaine. There were also quite a few lettuce stems in the salad which is quite bizarre. A broiled steak kabob was also ordered. Again nothing extraordinary for the price. Rice was very salty, the green beans with tomato sauce were reminiscent of something you'd find in a geriatric cafeteria.

Service was also painfully slow and one waitress was arguing with what appeared to be her boyfriend. Despite that, our waiter was polite and took the salad off of our check.",Owq90C9CVGWN-lNcCfTo-w,1,0,2,A56-14ysftK5MEAB29EdUA

I have never tried the Hookah lounge, so my review is based only on the restaurant side. First off, I have to mention the décor. I love the way it's decorated, and I think that it adds to the ambiance of the establishment. 

The menu is quite extensive with your typical Mediterranean offerings with some Italian and Indian thrown in. I usually get one of the kabob platters. The meat is high quality and the portions are very large, I usually end up taking about half home. They not only give you normal rice typically seen at a Greek or Persian restaurant, but another dark colored spice rice, which is my favorite!

1058074,2012-05-30,1,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"Paymons is definitely my favorite spot off The Strip.  Bf n I were looking for the best hookah bars in Vegas, and we came across Paymons.  We have tried Rhumbar and Azuza also, but they just dont compare!

We arrived at around 11:30pm, and the restaurant was very empty.  The lounge was nearly full, bumpin 80s music with a live DJ.  The seats were very comfortable, bf was very happy.  The service was great too, very nice girls and friendly to all their patrons.

We just came from a concert, so we were starving.  Bf ordered the Tandoori Chicken and loved it.  I ordered the gyro plate which also came with their signature Athens Fries... HOLY MOLY forget the fries, the GYRO was awesome!  In Hawaii, all Greek and Mediterranean food is pretty standard and nothing mind-blowing.  Paymons serves a JUMBO gyro and they do not skimp on ANY ingredients.  Loved it, but I couldnt finish it.  

We read about the Thief flavor shisha, and we ordered a bowl of that.  There was margarita mixed with several other flavors.  It was tasty! We also ordered a bowl of the Cherry Bomb shisha, which I thought tasted a lot better, more flavorful.  

There was a lot of funky music playing, and the music videos for the songs were also on the TVs on the walls.  This lounge is spacious and has a great vibe, dont be shy to get up and dance! 

Only thing I would have changed is to not sit near the A/C vent so I can do my smoke tricks...lol

I definitely want to come back again, but with a bigger group, its a great late-nite spot to get away from The Strip and just have fun.",drtt4maDA2A1vrnV_MIeEg,2,2,5,25pyMzldLRINKelMs0onBQ

I was lucky enough to be invited to my first UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) at Paymons.  Lots of good eats, great conversation, service and atmosphere.  The perfect mix of Greek, Indian, some Italian and I loved that there were a ton of Vegetarian options!

Appetizers:
I had the infamous Athens Fries, which lived up to their reputation.  The spice really added to the fries and the sauce was delish.   I kept trying to figure out what was in the sauce as if I were at a wine tasting.. lol..  never did figure it out, but well worth it!  
The hummus with pesto sauce was bomb.  Adding the pesto sauce probably took away from the healthy factor, but, when in Rome...

Entrees:
I ordered the Chicken Curry (mild) and my other half had the Chicken Tandoori.  The flavors were perfect and not overly spicy.  We were both part of the clean plate club.

Unfortunately, I didn't leave room for dessert.  I highly regretted this when I got home.  Next time, I must indulge.  Mama's Baklava is calling my name.  

As far as drinks, they had a great wine list, a killer margarita and their unsweetened tea was so good, it was almost as if it were sweetened.  As a southerner, I'm not a fan of iced unsweetened tea, but they make it work!  There were also a variety of warm tea to choose from.. Lots of green tea, Mango, Earl Grey, Spiced Chai, etc..etc..  A perfect way to end a meal!

The service was perfect!  We were a large party (around 20 peeps) and I don't think there was a single hiccup.  I was also impressed with how the server was able to effortlessly split about fifteen different tabs.  If only I could remember his name!  Shame on me.

I didn't check out the Hookah Lounge; Shisha tends to give me a headache.  Maybe next time.

The moussaka was really heavy. The Eggplant seemed a little undercooked for me. But that's more of a preference. 

The ground beef kabobs have what I think is all spice  and  tasted off to me.   Not typical Persian food. The meat was undercooked and I was afraid of getting sick if I ate it.  ""Luckily"" I  found a very fine thing long hair in my food and lost my appetite after that.

I knew of Paymon's for many years, but dodged it, assuming the interior would be a worn-out den of teenage hookah iniquity. But actually the venue is actually quite nicely appointed.

I had the Moussaka. My dining companion, she chose the Panini Chicken, and we shared a Calamari appetizer. Service was attentive. Portions were a fair shake, quality is well-above-average. 

However, prices were just a wee bit higher than I would deem fair, given what was delivered. I suppose that's where I fished up the one-star ding.

I've been coming to Paymons for years, you've always been my fave! I take everyone to Paymons! But lately your bread is so awful. What's the point of delicious hummus and kabobs and salads and pitas if they are paired with stale cold hard bread! Your competitors bring out hummus and make pitas with fluffy bread full of piping hot air right out of the oven. Lately you've been pairing your amazing food with something I think you pulled right out of a Sysco bag labeled ""pita from San Bernadino production facility 74ax92."" It's ruining everything. Not to mention my chicken pita (my fave) the other day was served on a piece of shoe leather.

1657765,2016-07-13,0,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"***3rd updated review: All please note the business manager deleted his reply. (As he should have, as he was extremely rude to my feedback. i will go and post screen shots of his original reply when i get some time. 
---------------------------------------------------
***2nd updated review: Here's an update to my review below. I tried to comment back to Jeff E. from this business but Yelp wouldn't let me for some reason. So this explains why the staff was rude, as you all can see below the Business Manger is rude himself in his reply. Not once, did I get an apology for his staff being rude or making us feel uncomfortable. Note, I am a first time customer and a potential client, obviously he doesn't care. In his review he didn't post about how we where addressed by the bus lady. Our own waiter didn't even enforce the dress code or anything. 

And our bad on the ""garlic fries"" when he asked the server about them we where told the following, ""We stopped serving those"" which indicates or conveys you once had them to a new customer like myself. So if you don't serve garlic fries or ""never have"", then please Jeff, educate your staff to let people know that, so they can respond correctly to customers. 

If you enforce a dress code regardless of race, or gender then all of your employees should enforce it, not just the bus lady, but your hostess who sat us AND the waiter who served us who said nothing to us. Please understand it felt like we where being picked on because after us sitting there for 2 hours smoking hookah and spending money on drinks no one said anything. I understand the dress code is posted but it was late and dark so we did not see it. Your host, and waiter said nothing to us. It would have been better to be addressed earlier, then 2 hours in, from a bus lady clearing our plates after we are done and about to leave. Please note, unlike the other customer, who was asked to remove his baseball cap ""3 times"" as soon as where we asked we cooperated and removed the hat. The point I am trying to make is we where addressed rudely about the baseball cap. Threated even, ""if we do not remove it we have to leave,"" but the guy across from us is allowed to be asked 3 times and us only once? That is not right.

And I think that that's great you have a way to buy shirts if someone has no sleeves, but if its NOT about race or gender, then why are the females allowed to wear sleeveless tops and sleeveless dresses in there? I myself had a tube top on that night, and no one made me ""pay for sleeves or a shirt."" If you are going to have a dress code, then all should abide by it then. Not just males. Women should too if that is what the dress code is. But again, it seems this place only caters to the ""regulars"" based the response below that I got. :-/  so I guess it doesn't matter. 


---Old review: My friends wanted to come in for the ""garlic fries"" only to find out they no longer serve them. We sat there for about 2 hours smoking hookah. Then some bus lady out of no where tells my boyfriend ""you need to take off your hat or get out."" First off, we have been sitting here for 2 hours and now it's an issue? Second of all I understand a dress code but the way she approached us and ask was rude. Simple. I then looked around and saw other people with baseball caps on as well. So we asked if my boyfriend needs to remove his baseball cap then so should the others. The bus lady / clean up lady claims she asked the other guy to remove it 3 times. I find it funny that she can supposedly ask someone to remove a hat 3 times and it's ok. But of course she asked my boyfriend once or her would be ""kicked out"" after 2 hours of sitting somewhere come on. So anyways my guy took off his hat. As we're waiting for our check there was a guy next to us and he had a regular black tee shirt on. They told him He has to have a ""proper shirt on or get out"" they then had him come over to the bar and ""pay a shirt fee"" wtf??!! This place is wayyyyy to worried about baseball hats and plain tees on certain people. If you know what I mean... If you guys are going to have a ""dress code"" it should be the same for everyone. No matter race or gender. Example: they let people in wearing sweats and work out clothes but worry about hats and plain tees? Come on now.",KZL3i6mKCOKSgHLz7IEENQ,2,0,1,jMt9V8lqPX3fK6g1muAImw

Portions are big and hearty and the fun part about that is you have more opportunities to try new things! I must say, as someone who has been a fan of Greek food for quite some time, it is difficult to find a falafel that is done right. You won't be disappointed with the little nuggets you get here. Crispy, crunchy, and smooth garbanzo texture. No burnt rubbery falafel in this joint! (which is refreshing to say the least). I wasn't particularly impressed with the roasted red pepper pita sandwich, a bit bland but edible nonetheless. One recommendation I do have is the veggie kabob, which features Mediterranean-style veggies grilled to perfection, especially the red pepper, yum! 

Came here for the first time the other day and will definitely be back to experience it night-style, hookah and all. If you like Greek food, this place is worth checking out!

Chicken Curry: No curry flavor, tastes like someone dashed seasoning in a pot of heavy cream.
Calamari: GREAT
Baba ghanouj: Just okay..lacked smoked flavor
Chicken Tikka: Decent, didn't really taste the seasoning/marinade.
Salmon with grilled vegetables: Salmon cooked well, vegetables always overcooked and limp.
Chocolate Cake: They claim this is from Cheesecake Factory, but I don't know about that...it was stale and flavorless when I had it
Pistachio Gelato: Came out half melted and tasted like artificial pistachio extract. 
Hookah: These take a while to come out, and depending on who makes it, you may or may not find a problem with it. One time it was perfect, the other time it was harsh, had too much water, and burned within 20 minutes.

There are several kabob plates, the KOOBIDEH PLATE  ($13) is solid with sides of saffron rice, house salad, and roasted tomato. By far my favorite dish here though, is the EGGPLANT PITA WRAP ($9) with roasted veggies, feta, and pesto sauce. Add on a side of ATHENS FRIES ($3) with their unique dipping sauce, and ask them to bring some tzatziki too. It's a flavor and texture explosion, in the best of ways.

All in all, everyone I basically know has one and we always smoke it together whether just to chill or when we have a pahteeeee. 

I started coming to Paymon's years ago. The hookahs were always real good and didn't taste burnt. The guys would come around to make sure the hookah was still hitting well and constantly replaced the coals. The happy hour all day Tuesday was the best with half off hookahs and lots of drinks to choose from.

Nowadays, I hardly ever go here, because the hookahs are always burnt and die really fast. The service is lacking now - I literally have to wave my hands in the air and do a little dance to get someone's attention. The drink refills dont come fast anymore so I'm always contemplating if I should just order two drinks instead of one.

One person can easily have lunch their for under $15 and leave being extremely stuffed. However, I would not recommend this place if you were looking for legit mediterranean (Italian/Greek) cuisine, since items at this restaurant are fairly Americanized. Likewise, it is probably because many of the dishes are already so westernized that majority of the customers would enjoy their flavours (some people don't like actual greek flavours). Overall, if you're looking for something legitimately Mediterranean, this might not be the restaurant for you, but if you want something INSPIRED by Mediterranean cooking, I think this would be an excellent place to try out.

A few weeks back my family and I stopped in for dinner just past 9 pm.  Our drink orders were taken (tap water for me, an ice tea, and a child's soda) and menus were presented.  When the waitress brought back the drinks I asked if we could have a full house menu, as there was only bar food.  She said that the kitchen had just closed and this was all they had.  I don't a lot of fried food, and neither does my child.  He wanted hummus and pita, so I asked if she could go into the kitchen and see if there was any hummus or baba ganoush left, figuring I could always have it on a pita as a vegetarian sandwich.  It was literally 10 after 9, and the items I was asking for were no cook.  Plus, other diners were still being served from the kitchen.  She came back and said that the chef wouldn't be able to accommodate me, and that she didn't know why.  She apologized and said that she works every Thursday night and I could come back any other time after hours and get it.  Well...If I could have it on any other Thursday night after 9 pm, why couldn't I have it on that night?  Especially when other diners were still being served food from the full menu?  

We decided not to stay, and apologized to her.  She gave us a bill for the ice tea and soft drink which came to over $6!  We paid and left.

Eventually, as we we're eating our lovely dinner, she vomited all over her table. Ran to the bathroom, also in our view, and continued to vomit there. Maybe it was the hookah or the drinking or the combination of both, but she ruined our dinner and we never went back. It's literally been 3 years.

They make a light, but flavorful house dressing, just the right amount of cheese, and plenty of veggies.  It's definitely enough to fill you for a whole meal, or to share with a friend while you also order a round of their great appetizers (like hummus, grape leaves, etc).

I met my friend at the hookah bar, where we were quickly set up with the Disco Lemonade hookah and ordered drinks.  The drinks (apple martini for my friend, lychee martini for myself), were actually quite good, as was the hookah, which was mild and flavorful.  That's where the good stuff ends, though.

Service from that point was a slow and lacking. We ordered 3 dishes: the wings, calamari, and the Athens fries, which took quite awhile to come out, were lukewarm at best, and tasted old- as if they had been sitting out for awhile.  The hookah attendant seemed annoyed that we weren't smoking our hookah fast enough and *gasp* socializing and talking to each other.  When we finished our meal, we asked our waitress for boxes for the leftovers, which she never brought.  No one ever came back to ask if we were done, needed anything else- or even to bring our check.  After waiting for at least 20 minutes, we finally tracked down our waitress at the bar to ask for the boxes and the bill.  The boxes were given to us with annoyance, and after seeing us struggle with them, a bag wasn't offered- luckily, the hostess at the front offered one to us.

I am not sure if I'll give it another chance.  I did like the location, the look of the lounge, but the food and service...as the stars say- ""meh.""",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,2,2,2,EBWiVHnXwwoMa0LJmhPVCw

there are plenty of other places in town that wouldn't even allow burnt food to leave their kitchen, let alone be served to you.

one would assume that poor reviews would be used by the business owner as constructive criticism and as a way to improve in areas they may not have been aware that there was a problem.  i have no agenda here other than to review my exact experience at an establishment.  i stick to the fact that my falafel were burnt to a crisp.  i care very little how many awards were won and what other people think of this establishment.  my review is based strictly on my personal experience and when i dined here, my falafel were burnt to a crisp.  take this review however you'd like, but as the business owner, trying to convince me that your falafel is amazing when mine clearly were not, does not work.  i'm glad you have a loyal following and i'm sure it's deserved.  however, it still doesn't change the fact that my falafel were burnt to a crisp.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,8,2,1,zwN5Zw4uclQXyy9XZxbvNQ

However, I am on a veggie cleanse and after eating all the veggie dishes last night with a friend....it is as good as it gets! 

Paymon's is definitely a very good restaurant with a wide range of variety of dishes that a meat carnivore and veggie delight eater can both enjoy! 

As veggie delight eaters, we ordered the following:

STUFFED GRAPE LEAVES
Served cold as Paymon's Greek version of Dolmas consists of young, tender, grape leaves, stuffed with rice and flavorful herbs. Served with delicious Tzatziki sauce.

ATHENS FRIES
As it says on the menu, these fries are highly addictive and indeed they are! Addiction derives from their house seasoned fries accompanied by a delicious creamy dipping. Nevertheless, I like to dip mine with their special bottled hot sauce.

HUMMUS
One of my favorite delectable dip! Puree of chickpeas, Tahini, fresh garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon juice. 

BABA GANOSH
The name speaks for it self, it sounds like a hot Greek man riding on a white horse down the white sands of Greece....but it is a scrumptious mixture of seasoned, baked eggplant, blended with Tahini, fresh garlic, Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.

TABULI SALAD
What a fresh Mediterranean classic of a salad! Tabuli salad is combined with chopped parsley, bulgur wheat, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and fresh mint leaves. Tossed with their house seasonings, extra virgin Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  I know I know...it has gluten in it, but it's already hard to be gluten free so I ate it anyway! This salad is delicious!!

EGGPLANT PARMESAN
This Fresh Eggplant coated with Italian bread crumbs, layered with roasted whole garlic, Marinara sauce and topped with Mozzarella cheese was sooooo gooood!!!  It even came with Barilla penne pasta Marinara which made the dish so huge and plenty of left overs.

I heart Paymon's!!",Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q,2,3,5,f-npEhV-7N7800O3ri2HEg

They have a pretty awesome Happy Hour of 50% off almost everything from cocktails, bears, food and hookahs which run from 5pm-7pm everyday.

The ambiance and décor of this place was remarkable. High ceilings, beautiful carpeting on the floors and walls. I for sure felt like I walked into the castle where Aladdin dreamed of living. 
The hookah side was not too smoky and you could eat your food, enjoy your drink, and sit comfortably without being bothered by the other parties. I of course tried the hookah, we had watermelon margarita and it was good considering I don't smoke.
But the real treasure of this place. The food and drinks. Oh man. Ok so first I ordered their version of a cosmo with a sugared rim. Not bad, especially if you get it during happy hour. We had hummus, pesto pizza with red peppers, chicken masala, lamb kabobs, and salmon. 
I would order every single thing again. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the spices were not overwhelming. Same thing with the salmon. I loved that they had Greek and Italian options as well as curry, and other more authentic style Indian Cuisine. Then at the end, I tried the Bloody Mary. NO REGRETS even after being stuffed. The mix was house-made and it was spiced perfectly. My mouth literally waters for one as I type. 
I cant wait to go back, I probably wont hookah, but I will enjoy plenty of decently priced food and drinks. I hear they get crazy on the weekends, DJ and all.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,1,4,5,hQ04UKlYg1BCi9xUboCY9A

The hostess was unfriendly but, lucky for her, I was distracted by the restaurant's decor. Big. fan. For my 1st time, I was pleased to be there during the sweet-spot of the evening where I got to see what it was like with all the natural light from the skylights then the dim lighting once the sun set. The chairs were a pleasant surprise- they have a little give when you lean back in them. Über comfy. Unlike the hostess, our waitress was very friendly. We ordered their fries & mozzarella sticks for appetizers- not a single complaint! Later, with our entrées, we had some sides of tzatziki that I enjoyed dipping the fries in more than the standard sauce. I ordered the beef kabobs, at the recommendation of our waitress- it came with a small side salad & basmati rice. All very tasty! My g.f. got the gyro salad with a side of tzatziki, in addition to the dressing- I had a nibble of the salad & would definitely order it. Because I fell in love with the baklava, on a previous Yelpventure at Petra, I HAD to try Paymons'! Obviously, now I think I'm an expert &, in my expert opinion, the baklava at Paymon's is good but Petra's could take it out to the monkey bars & beat it up.

I ordered online (just 1 frickin' sandwich, btw) before I even got driving, because I had limited time & I wanted my order to be ready.

Well, no worries there. Hostess had literally not even put it in yet (at least 25min!!!). Ok. Long deep breath, it'll be ready in 15. Nope. It took an HOUR for a sandwich. 

Meanwhile, this bih is taking orders. Is she a hostess or a waitress, cuz I work in f&b and those are distinct jobs. Groups of nicely-dressed people were standing there waiting for tables while she was taking table orders. And she didn't even put them in, I saw that sh*t. She went to go seat people, yanno, like the job description entails. So head's up, the next sandwich turnaround time was likely an hour, too. I'm actually laughing at this point, because this was happening on a Tuesday. Can you imagine a whole table on a Saturday night? I'm a cocktail waitress, so the cringe factor was REAL.

I like that there is a bit of flexibility in their dishes. I can have pasta, or curry or gyros. So there isn't a big fuss if a group of us want to eat there and all have different tastes. My usual for quite awhile was the broiled steak kabob. The meat is always very tasty (but not always the most tender) and the basmati rice fluffy and nicely spiced. The vegetables are always overcooked. Not that I'm a bit fan of them anyway but I might be more enticed to eat them if this was not the case.

My current favorite is the chicken curry. I get it about medium spicy but then I cover it in their racy red sauce. I could pour that on just about everything it's so good. The hummus is my  mom's favorite dish. I like it too but it is so filling that I usually can't finish my entree if we get it as an appetizer. The gyros are nice, the meat is not dry and they are really smashing with a side of Athens fries.

Wednesday night 25% OFF 
- Arrived 10 min before 5pm they say they would send a server at 5. 
- 25 min go by and no one comes to check on our table. Another guests sitting near were also getting impatient 
- One more table gets seated, I finally go ask the host to either send a server or move us to a table where the server would come and actually take the order.
- Finally a server shows up and apologized she wasn't aware we were waiting... Hmm strange? 4 tables totally unattended for 20-25 min.
-Last table gets seated gets their order placed and sure enough they get drinks and food before us. 
- Another guests get upset and leave. 5min later the server comes with the drinks and at this point I tell her what was going on.. I said we've been waiting for so long and the last table gets served first obviously someone will get pissed.
- Another server comes not sure if it was the supervisor apologized offered to comped our appetizers... Blah blah 
- 45 min to get our food when the bill comes, I can't help to notice the appetizer wasn't comped. No reason to bring this up. I'm actually just impatiently waiting to pay and leave. 
This people don't really know how to treat and keep your long time clients happy. I've been coming to Paymons for at least 8 years and is disappointing how the service has gotten this way.

It was weird. I don't understand why she tried three horrible locations first. Our server Marissa was awesome! Super friendly and attentive. We had the lamb kabob, Kibbeh platter, calamari and hummus. The calamari is superb! The kibbeh was okay. It's the pie style and not the balls you usually see in town but it didn't have that authentic taste and was a bit greasy.

From what I see in the pictures, the Hookah lounge is gorgeous, but I didn't get to see it since we were just here for lunch. The waitress sat us in a booth a quickly brought out our water and told us what she recommended. 

We ordered:
Fried Calamari ($9.50) - Topped with grated parmesan cheese and served with spicy marinara sauce.

Pastitsio ($12.95) - layered casserole made with lean ground beef, Barilla pasta, tomato, parmesan cheese, and several herbs and spices. Topped with bechamel sauce, oven baked and served on a roasted tomato coulis. Served with Mediterranean vegetables.

Gyro ($8.75) - Slices of beef and lamb, served with fresh romaine lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and Greek tzatziki sauce.
+Athens fries for $2.95 extra

To be honest, I found this all to be a little overpriced. Our bill came out to be over $40 with tip because we also ordered iced tea and a soda. However, the food was very good. The meat in the Gyro was very tender and the fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I don't know what kind of dipping sauce they gave us with the Athens fries, but it was addicting. The Pastitsio was very flavorful although a little too heavy for my liking, so I probably wouldn't order it again. The calamari was heavenly; Lightly breaded, tender, and oozing with flavor Parmesan/herb goodness. The marinara sauce was an added bonus. I normally prefer my Calamari with marinara as opposed to aioli. 

If it weren't for the regular menu being a tad overpriced, I would give this place an easy 4 stars. I just don't think I can justify the Gyro and fries being about $12 and the Calamari being $9.50. I'll have to come back again during happy hour when Calamari is only $4.75, so I can add on another star ;)

While looking for a happy hour on a recent visit to Vegas we stumbled on Paymons. I absolutely adore this place. From the minute we stepped into the hookah lounge we were welcomed and felt at home. If you want to spend a couple of hours chillin' in an exotic atmosphere eating Mediterranean food--we're talking here fried calamari and baba gnoush served with a huge side of soft pita bread--while sipping any specialty drinks. . . ours were a variation of the margarita, at happy hour half price--this is your place.  And, hey maybe add a hookah to the mix.

The lounge is dark, sultry and cozy. The décor is ""Persian Sultan den"" with walls and ceiling a deep warm maroon.  A selection of large paintings of women in suggestive poses from past centuries sit in ornately carved frames vying for space with heavily-patterned cloth tapestries which gives the room a tent-like atmosphere. There are plenty of pillows to lounge upon. My wife said, ""we need to create a hookah den in our house."" I said, ""sure, I'm in."" At first I was curious why the music wasn't traditional Middle Eastern, but I soon warmed up to the House music, which surprisingly suited the space.

The server/bartenders had no attitude whatsoever and made me want to spend a long time here. The hookah master gently asked us if we would like to try a hookah. He said he would mix a special novice blend for us. We wondered if his watermelon/grape recommendation would be too fruity, but the concoction had a smooth taste and aroma and I felt myself relaxing with every puff.

The flavor we had was good however the hookah they brought us barely worked! We had to ask for assistance at least 3-4 times and the burner was messed up. Bummer.. Took a while to flag down the waitress although she was sweet something was still lacking... On to the drips they have they lyche martini that's great and another drink that's similar to a Long Island! Both good! The recommended gyro came out the first time on some stale bread that I had sent back because there was no explanation as to why when I picked up my sandwich to bite the whole thing crumbled.. Literally at this point I was beyond over the experience.. I can see the poets rial and if I'm being treated I may return...,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,0,0,3,xNc7zX3fe6l5MORyk845xQ

The decor in the lounge is absolutely stunning and immediately puts you in a loungey, relaxy mood as you take a seat. This place is what I feel a true hookah lounge embodies. All the other ones I've been to around here and Cali have nothing on this lounge. With that said, the one on Maryland Pkwy is the same, just smaller and more narrow in size.

During my many visits here for about the past 10 years, I've had the pleasure of trying a few dishes whilst drinking and smoking in the lounge. Some of my faves here are: moussaka, lamb kabobs, beef kabobs, calamari, Athens fries, hummus, to name a few. I can't remember not liking anything I've tried here.

If you get here during happy hour, the specialty drinks and appetizers are half off. And they do not skimp here. You can order a full size calamari app for under $5 and they are some of the best I've ever had.

The service is always super friendly but they do get overwhelmed when it gets busier at night. This is a fact I've come to live with when visiting Paymon's but the relaxed feel when I'm here makes it a non-issue for me.

Every time I come here, it's always great times and great memories. This is a must-do when I have friends in from out of town. I'm so glad we have such a beautiful place like this in Las Vegas that is off the Strip.",S2tfbnjoCzMX0U0B_cTXVw,11,7,5,m2Cgdy4XddFKISesuoW4BA

It never hit well, and even after having them change the coals, the bowl, and the base itself, the outcome was still crap (barely any smoke and minimal flavor). I hate to sound so harsh but honestly I've been here four times thinking each time that next time would be better, but I'm done trying. They need to make it so the coals aren't covered...I know there's a liability, but it really destroys the quality of the smoke and flavor when you have the cover on the coals...they're the only place I know of in Vegas that does that.

They had a DJ playing live music videos and there was a cool little dance floor. I believe this started at 10pm on Saturday. They have open seating but a reservation might be needed for a bigger party. 

I wouldn't say the food is phenomenal, but the portions were nice and it paired well with the hookah which was reasonably priced.

First and foremost I may say Paymon's has an excellent happy hour. The service is usually terrible in the lounge area but we deal with it because it's a pretty awesome atmosphere. Being huge fans of Hookah and living in Summerlin, this location is usually our go to spot when we don't want to drive all the way down to The Olive Hookah Lounge. Food wise, the hummus and the stuffed grape leaves are awesome! The fries are so good that I have to talk myself out of getting them most of the time haha. Hookah wise we love the peach flavor.

Now for last night...  We came in with a few friends and I was wearing a Chargers baseball cap. The waitress (after taking our drink orders) told me I was not allowed to wear a hat. Now the very last time we came in I was wearing  the exact same hat. Very confused I asked her what the issue was. She said there were no hats allowed in the restaurant / lounge. Now I find this pretty insane. We are long time paying customers of Paymon's and I was being asked to leave over wearing a sports team baseball cap? I'm still pretty taken back by this, even now.

I have been going to Paymons since the 1980's on Maryland PKWY and then on Sahara. We go there VERY often.
Last 2 time were a total bust. We ate here tonight. The Greek salad, the lettuce leaf edges were turning brown. 
The Hummus was not fresh, it too was brown on the edges like Tuna salad when left uncovered turns.
Worst of all. We ordered a Chicken Kabob dinner. The chicken came out raw in the center and had to be sent back. The kabob seemed to have been cooked on a grill. It did not have any char. Second time we ordered a Chicken Kabob here in the last two weeks and the chicken was like a hard rubber. It was gross and we left it.
Amazing how long this restaurant was great and all of a sudden its getting really bad.
I do not know if Paymon is  still is the owner. He and his father were some of the best owners of any establishment in town. Very generous to their patrons when at their market they had on Maryland pkwy, and the food was always fresh and prepared perfect. If they still own it, they need to get more hands on, because their manager and cooks are doing them a great disservice. I have to start looking for another Mediterranean restaurant.

HOOKAH LOUNGE & SERVICE
My cousin and her friend invited me here for a round of hookah the other night. We weren't sure if we were supposed to enter the lounge or wait at the front of the restaurant to be directed, but we had to wait quite a bit for someone to show up and help us -- by the way, there was hardly anyone dining in the restaurant at 8:00PM. When the hostess finally appeared, she directed us to the lounge where we waited AGAIN. Finally, we were told we could sit at a corner booth and that our hookah waitress (?) would arrive shortly.

We were given a tray containing an array of tobacco flavors to choose from, as well as a menu. The choices on the menu are pricier because some are specialty tobaccos infused with alcohol. For $15 you can mix different flavored tobaccos from the given tray and puff on hookah for more than an hour.  My cousin and I chose to mix margarita, peach, and strawberry which is an awesome, fruity blend. 

You can also eat and drink in the hookah lounge. My cousin's friend ordered a couple bottles of Fat Tire beers for himself, while my cousin and I ordered a flavorful Moroccan tea. The plastic containers of honey that our waitress gave us were unnecessary because the tea was already naturally sweetened. 

Our waitresses were nice, but they didn't stop by our table as much to see how we were doing, so we often had to play the waiting game.

OVERALL
Really, I'd rate this a 3.5 than a 4.0, because the service could be better. I'm not sure if $15 is a reasonable price for a round of hookah, but I can say the experience was fun and a unique way to hang out with friends and unwind from a stressful day.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,5,3,4,rG6GNs3lLUJvT_trnUGINw

We entered the lounge area where all the smoking takes place.  We're not smokers, but were pleasantly surprised with the subtle aroma of the few smokers in the vicinity.  I'd characterize it as a cross between pipe tobacco and light, fruity incense.

Anyways, we enjoyed a number of the half-off appetizers and cocktails.  The appetizers were great.  We had the stuffed grape leaves (filled with a well-seasoned ground beef), the pesto pita pizza with mushrooms, the falafel and the chicken fingers dipped in a phenomenal buffalo sauce.  Each one was better than expected.  The drinks were also very good and we walked out with the perfect buzz.  I'd recommend the Lychee martini for a strong, yet tasty after-work drink.  

The atmosphere was very serene and unique for the Vegas scene.  It was hard to imagine that we were in the heart of Summerlin while sitting on a wraparound couch and surrounded with dimmed, colored lighting and interesting, yet well-themed artwork.

Their menu is ridiculously large with cuisines including Italian, Mediterranean, Persian, Greek, and Indian.

Partly because he likes the rhyme, partly because he knows it annoys me, and partly because he hates falafel.  I was super excited when he suggested Paymon's for lunch.  He tends to avoid Mediterranean restaurants, because he always says, ""Isn't that whole area a little iffy?""  Paymon's serves what I think of as non-threatening food from a foreign country.  Nothing is very strange, falafel is perhaps one of their stranger things on the menu.  Everything is amazingly overpriced.

Greg had the pastitsio, which is basically bland Greek lasagna, something that I could never get excited about.  (Apparently, this is no longer on the menu).  I had the falafel which had really large patties.  I prefer my patties smaller and crispier.  The fries were just superb though.  I could go to Paymon's for just the fries with their strange mustard like fry sauce.

The thing that pissed me off though is when we ordered a pot of tea.  They have a great selection of tea to order from, but when we asked if we could split a pot of overpriced tea, we were informed that it wasn't allowed.  Really?  Everyone has to get their own POT of tea...not a glass, a pot.  You can't split a pot of tea.  What a joke of a restaurant showing that they really just care about ways to make money!

Paymon's, by the way, is the restaurant that gets called in about on KNPR constantly.  Whenever they have a food critic on, people call in and rave about Paymon's.  It got the point that people at KNPR usually mention that they will not be taking calls about Paymon's and that Paymon's is just all right of a restaurant.

Started with a Magic Carpet, my stepmom got a vanilla type of martini. Martini was kind of gross, but mine was delish (redbull, vodka, and chambord. Simple enough.) We had the combination as an appetizer, comes with falaffel, tabouli, baba ganoush, hummus, and bouranni and stuffed grape leaves which I always avoid at all costs. My homemade tabouli is much tastier, but the rest was very very good. This was all new to my Dad and he was impressed. Dad got chicken fesenjan, which he swore was amazing, as a vegetarian I refused to taste it, so all I can say is my Dad is a total meat and potatoes guy, and he was about to lick that damn plate. Hubby had meatball sandwich, not really sure why they serve Italian here! I got the eggplant panini and was not impressed, a bit bland, just a plain mushy sandwich. But the FRIES... omg YUM they really are great!! We finished up with some tirimasu, heavy on the rum, just the way we like it, and some sort of dessert martini which they added dark chocolate to at my request. All of the food was good, not super amazing, and I should have avoided the Italian and enjoyed Meditteranean. I would go back, great atmosphere!

A little ways off the strip, this gem can be found in an unassuming strip mall. The restaurant itself is quite large and it looks like from the doors that they have expanded into adjacent storefronts a few times. I can see why :)

When we arrived for a late lunch, we were quickly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was great--checked in with us regularly and helped us figure out how much to order without over ordering. 

We decided to split a plate because he advised us it was large--it was! The chicken kabob skewer has 10 ounces of meat on it! We also split a side of dips--the babaghanouj and the yogurt dip. The baba was probably the best I've ever had! It comes with a side of white or whole wheat pita. When we ran out, we were offered more pita or sliced veggies (super healthy--love it!)

The chicken kabob plate was perfect for two fit friends to split. With 10 ounces of grilled chicken, we each got ample protein. It also came with a greek salad, roasted red peppers and a great rice dish. We finished most, but not all of the plate--that's how large it was.

Since we were visiting and didn't have a car, we asked our waiter to call a cab and he quickly obliged. When one didn't show up, he checked in, found out the cab company was in the middle of a shift change, and took the initiative to call a second cab company so that we wouldn't have a much more prolonged wait. 

If I lived locally, this would definitely be a place I'd come regularly. Tasty food, good portions and great service--winner in my book!",BwpJ_b_cUX4XB71J4wm3qA,4,0,4,GchF7RYFwzsj6Epwkq2PiA

Food: 
Athens fries didn't really work for me.  It was good, but seasoning was bit too much for my taste.  
Beef kabob was overcooked.
Fesenjan was tasty but on the sweeter side.

3970980,2014-06-30,5,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"We stopped here for something different.  I had looked at the menu online and decided on the kebab trio--a dinner with koobideh, chicken, and lamb kebabs.  Served with the meal are vermicelli pilaf, basmati rice, a house salad, and grilled tomato and red pepper.

I started my meal with a cup of their summer soup available for a limited time.  It's a cucumber yogurt cold soup with walnut pieces and golden raisins for a touch of sweetness.  The soup was topped with some croutons and garnished with a sprig of mint.  It was excellent!  Very different and very refreshing.

For the main course, the kebab trio was perfect for the two of us.  My wife does not like lamb.  By sharing the trio, I was able to have some lamb while she stuck with chicken and koobideh.  Of the three, the koobideh was the star of the dish.  The lamb was cooked too much--I had requested rare and it was more on the medium side.  It was also a bit tough.  The chicken was OK but there wasn't much spice to it.  The koobideh, on the other hand, was done medium rare as I asked and it was flavorful and very enjoyable.

For dessert, my wife got the rice pudding (it was very good), and I got an order of baklava--also very good.

Service was not the best.  We waited at the podium for about 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  My iced tea wasn't refilled in a timely manner and even though there were only a few other diners in the room, our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time only checking back with us once near the end of our dinner.  I also thought it was a bit tacky to take the dessert order, enter it into a nearby terminal, and then put the bill on the table before clearing the dishes and well before dessert was brought.  Bad form.

If I decide to come back, it will be for takeout, but with other choices in the area for Mediterranean food, I probably will go elsewhere.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,5,3,GGNzdmbdDHW22FdvwBWHug

3994024,2013-05-15,0,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"I went to the Hookah lounge last night (Tuesday, May 14) with a friend. Tuesdays they have all-day happy hour in the lounge (which means half-price hookah, drinks, and some appetizers)! It gets a bit crowded which may not be for everyone, but I think it makes for a more fun vibe. They tend to start playing electronic music later in the night on Tuesdays as well (I have heard they also do this on weekends).

I give them four stars mainly for overall atmosphere in the lounge and selection of the hookahs. They have a huge assortment of hookah flavors - at least 25 that you can mix and match, and you can also choose liquids other than water for the bottom of the hookah. My only complaints are that the hookahs take phenomenally long to come out (I can never understand why this part takes so long - the drinks and even the food arrives before the hookah!) and they won't refill coals - you just have to order a new hookah flavor. But, the music is good and the seating is comfortable, so the wait doesn't bother me enough to stop going.

The food is good, but not exceptional. It's decent middle eastern food for Las Vegas, but like I said, if it weren't for the great vibe in the hookah lounge, I wouldn't go for the food alone. The hummus, baba ganoush, and meat dolmas are my favorite appetizers, and the lamb skewers are a great entree. I wouldn't recommend going to this place for dinner, but I would hands-down recommend going to have a fun night smoking hookah and grabbing some drinks with friends.",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,0,0,4,tCXv7zbH5YFyTFWgHgt9JQ

The food is excellent along with the atmosphere. We had a pre-New Years Eve party here in 2007 and all of our friends loved the place as well. The last time we were here was in the summer of 2009.

The curry is to die for and they will make the food super spicy if you ask. The outdoor area is great in the summer and inside the restaurant area is nice, though can be a little tight, so not a place you want to talk about anything too personal, though a great place to eat. The Hookah area is great, and while my wife isn't a smoker, she loved their jasmine and vanilla flavored tobacco.

Downside, you can't smoke a regular cigarette inside, though who would need too since you have a flavored hookah in front of you?",3okrWrDZxfMrF3_thV3Kmg,1,0,5,Z5ZQWY74W0KCZOsQS1wfAg

We head there for lunch after work and are seated in the dining area, not the hookah area. 

I will say, having fresh Athen's fries is a must with their special sauce. They are definitely special.

I had hot green tea with honey and it was delicious :] served in a pot.

Aside from Athen's fries we had calamari for an appetizer which was the fried variety-just how I like! And a big serving for the price of about $10.

I had the Greek Pie.. I forgot the name but the menu read that it had a baked béchamel sauce on top.

Overall it was forgettable. It was served with a side of veggies. Pretty much tasted like a soup.

Someone got the meat kabob gyro which was said to be very good.

And for dessert we shared an unimpressive baklava.

Had take out a couple of weeks later from here and had the chicken Marsala and also had a bite of chicken parmasen.

Helped keep my rating to a 3.

Paymon's has two locations: one by UNLV and the other in the Northwest part of town (the Sahara location definitely has less criminal activity and is therefore my favorite one). Surprisingly, it's actually pretty classy inside and I didn't expect it to be as nice as it is. Upon walking in, I was pleased to see that both locations are beautifully decorated in a Moroccan style with gorgeous pillows and dimly lit lanterns that make me feel like I'm in Aladdin. Come here to hang out with friends, unwind after work, have a few drinks and just relax.  Even the food is pretty tasty. Mostly locals frequent Paymon's, so it's safe to say that the chances of a tour bus packed full of foreigners unloading there are slim.

4183391,2018-03-29,0,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"I have been coming to Paymons on the east side of town for over 10 years now.  Since my parents moved to Summerlin four years ago, we have been happily coming to Paymons on Sahara without issues.  Cannot say that was the case last night.  They were busier than usual, and boy did they have a bad night.  Let me explain.

We were only a party of four and therefore the order should not have been that difficult.  We ordered an appetizer and then the following meals:
1) Kebab Trio
2) Greek Salad
3) Chicken Parm
4) Lamb Kebab

I just did this from memory, so should not be that difficult for person writing it down.  Don't know what happened in the kitchen, but here is how the food came out.

1) Chicken Parm and Lamb Kebab came out to the table and the food runner said they are getting the salad.

Lamb Kebab was cold and tough...salad limp....and had to be sent back.

Chicken parm was good.

Next runner brought the Greek salad in a bag to go.  Ooops....had to be brought back to the kitchen and put in a bowl.

My food....the Kebab trio...a no show.  Waitress was very apologetic and said she would check.  They never put the order in....so I changed the order to a Gyro Platter to make it quick.  Unfortunately after all the mistakes above, they didn't think to put a rush on the Gyro Platter as it showed up after everyone was done.  

THE BIGGEST ISSUE I HAVE WITH EVERYTHING, IS THE MANAGER WAS A NO SHOW.  HOW CAN YOU RUN A RESTAURANT, WITHOUT GOOD MANAGEMENT?  I DON'T THINK Paymon Raouf WOULD ACCEPT THIS STYLE MANAGEMENT FROM HIS STAFF?  MAYBE HE SOLD?

They didn't charge me for my Gyro platter, we didn't eat the lamb Kebab, so they took that off the bill.  But the biggest issue is the lack of respect for the customer.  We are a long time client and might give their new competition down the road a try.  

Just a disappointment.

They have great specials and offers on their mailing list. We have never had to wait, and even when they are a full house...they are able to seat us! 

I am not fond of the hookah lounge and that is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because sometimes the only table left is right by the hookah door and the smell makes me sick. I think for business it is a great idea to have a day/night option.

The server who took my order was lovely, and provided me with one of their late night menus which is more limited and doesn't provide any pasta options. Just fine with me, I came in for a salad anyway.

The wait for the food was short, and it was packaged nicely when I got home. I ordered the Greek salad which came with romaine, red onion, pepperoncini, feta, tomatoes and olives. The olives were quality with the pits still in them, and the pepperoncini were served whole in the salad. The tomatoes you could tell had been refrigerated for a while as they had no taste except to be slightly sour with a mealy texture. The feta was dry and grated which was very strange to me. I prefer a creamier, softer feta, the kind that comes packed in water. I usually associate dry feta with poor quality. The vinaigrette was thin, thank goodness as I hate syrupy dressings, but I still added some red wine vinegar to my salad at home because it lacked the acidity I was looking for.
I also got a side of rice, and it came with white basmati rice topped with some saffron basmati rice. It was decent, but tasted heavily of butter. I can only imagine how much they probably used when steaming/reheating it.

The ambiance here was very pretty and I can see this easily being a nice late night lounge for locals who live nearby.

The food is decent. I can't imagine its too authentic. The seasoned fries are great, though. 

The apps are a nice accompaniment to the smokes. A bowl is ~$15 and a refill is like ~$8 I think. They have a variety of flavors. I remember when the whole no smoking where food is served thing was around. Paymon's complied for a sec, but then reverted back. 

Sometimes we get picky about how hot the coal is or how the shisha is burning, but the smoke boy comes around and makes it all better. 

The drinks are okay-priced. If you ask for a water, they'll give you a tiny Fiji for like $5. I think the food prices are reasonable, though. Get the app combo platter (classy, huh?) for $11 to feed a non-ravenous group of three. Baklava and rice pudding are vera nice. 

On the weekends, the lounge fills up. I've seen the restaurant side get busy, but not packed. The lounge is open late, but not late enough. 1a every night. 

The lounge is lowkey and chill. Its perfect for the nights you want to get out of the house, but not deal with the crowds or yelling over loud music. Sometimes they play Middle Eastern jams. Sometimes its like club electronica.

2) I've been here a few times where the owners friend was in per employees so the TV's had to be left on his bet channels and not switched to the VGK games
3) Bar area opens later so if want to watch any sports game they have to start after 5pm",hOf1XFyRoFiEXHCAZ1bwKw,0,0,3,fiMifl82WKhsNak0La7Zyw

4448167,2010-09-04,1,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"Hello from Japan!

For those following my reviews, I am Yelping from Sendai city in beautiful Miyagi prefecture (two hours north of Tokyo).  I am working here as an ALT, so I'm going to be here for a while.  I'm going to get my last reviews in because I miss Yelp, and wish I could yelp some of the great places I've been to here in Japan.

(Sorry for that tangent... on to the review!)

I came to Paymon's about a month ago when I was supervising a group of international students to Sin City.  Echoing my previous reviews, I find that the best restaurants and treasures in Vegas definitely come from the locals, and it wasn't long before buddy Francis C. took me here for a late lunch.

Paymon's specializes in Mediterranean café style foods- a cuisine I've never really touched before, so my choices here were definitely on the safe side.  Conveniently located a few blocks away from the Strip, Paymon's offers a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice meal, as well as a hookah bar right next door (however, you must be 21 or older to enter).  When we went, we sat in between the restaurant and the bar in this extremely nice patio area, where natural sunlight was where it was at.

Service that day was decent.  We placed a few orders of fries, and I ordered the chicken marsala for my hefty meal.  Our food took a bit for it to come out, which confused us because a couple of other parties received theirs before ours (and we felt it was a pretty small meal).  When I finally received my chicken marsala, I was ready to sink my mouth into that piece of chicken.   In terms of the taste, the flavors didn't do much for me.  It wasn't bad at all, but nothing about my meal struck me.  The piece of fried chicken breast was okay, and my sauce over the noodles were simply average.  However, they do give a good sized portion for you hungry gamblers out there.

Even though my meal wasn't completely mind-blowing, I did enjoy the French fries and the on-and-off lighting inside the patio.  Next time I come, I will definitely venture off and try the more Mediterranean options that Paymon's is known for.

Parking is plentiful outside in a private lot with other businesses.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,3,1,3,Cu51y4va51iybBDw6d6iNg

I'm always on the look out for some good dolma especially  if they are served hot. I think the cold ones are too oily. I liked the fact they had both of them at this location. I started off with the hot dolmas for ($7.95). A dolma is a grape leaf filled with seasoned beef and rice baked in tomato sauce. This is the closest one I can find to the ones I ate during my childhood. 

I had the Fesenjan for my entree ($12.95). It's a boneless chicken breast that is slow cooked with crushed walnuts and pomegranate sauce. It's served with basamati rice. I typically don't like eating a lot of chicken because I'm afraid it would be bland but this was bursting with flavor! It has a tangy sweet flavor to it. 

I also sampled their combination platter ($13.95) which comes with Hummus, Tabuli, stuffed grape leaves, falfel, yogurt cucumber dip, baba ganosh and Athens fries. Everything tasted fresh and delicious! You could tell the food is made to order.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,2,4,quNL1eHzKkkPSqdQn-PLNw

We came in about 6 on Friday evening. The place was not busy, and the hostess greeted us right away. Fine. But she takes us to a table literally steps from the front door, directly in line with the kitchen door. Can you say freeway? Could have asked for another table, but I didn't...so my bad, but I don't think I should have had to...

Server came and took orders promptly, ok so far. Hummus appetizer comes out quickly, always delicious. Then the entrees came out, gyros salad for me, falamus pita for my wife. also delicious. Maybe not exactly authentic Mediterranean food, but yummy nonetheless. Shared a few Athens fries...these are the bomb.

So what's the problem? Indifferent service.  Our server did not once stop and ask how we were doing. After he took our order, he literally disappeared. A different server brought the food out, and of course our server didn't bother to check if we got everything we needed. He must have passed our table 10 times without so much as a nod of the head. I even had to flag him down for a water refill! 

We finished eating and just sat there. No offer of dessert, nothing.  I flagged him down for the check, since by that time I was getting annoyed and just wanted to split. 

We like Paymon's and will probably go back, but if the service is as poor  next time, we'll move on.",Nrxse9AoBKKLGHrf7I2fKQ,5,1,2,JvRMAazz-plrkegNMpGD-A

My only complaint is they keep the door open between the restaurant and the hookah lounge. I don't feel like coming to eat and inhaling second hand smoke. I'm not sure what the purpose of leaving it open is. It's not fair to restaurant diners who don't want to smell that stuff and want to enjoy their food. I hope they will consider closing it going forward.
*EDIT:  Someone from the establishment replied to my review and claim that it's not smoke, that is actually not true. It is smoke but it's filtered through water and smoke still comes out. As far as the airflow going the opposite direction, we've eaten there many times and we love the food but we can definitely smell the hookah in the dining room. It's horrible. There's NO reason that the door shouldn't be closed between the bar and the dining room.
From a hookah fact sheet:
""Hookah smoking is not safer than cigarette smoking. Also known as a narghile, shisha or goza, a hookah is a water pipe with a smoke chamber, a bowl, a pipe and a hose. Specially made tobacco is heated, and the smoke passes through water and is then drawn through a rubber hose to a mouthpiece.""",OI7eN_aR8LjgkTYT4Yyteg,0,0,3,ATyQhmkxLel6Hup8x3eXzg

We didn't make a scene, because we were already asked to leave a PT's two days prior for throwing jalapeño poppers at a man in a wheelchair and telling him to dance. Whatever. Thanks Obama.

My favorites:
Combination Platter ($13.95)
Moussaka ($13.95)
Broiled Kabob Trio ($20.95)

All of their flame-broiled meats are packed with flavor and so very yummy with their basmati rice and house salad. I love the trio platter since it comes with three types of meat that are cooked with different seasonings (I hate to decide and I just love the variety). I feel the same way about the Combination Platter. It comes with EIGHT different items! It's the best dish to order if you want to try multiple specialties or just sharing with the table. My favorites on the platter are the Athens Fries, Falafel, and Baba Ganoush.

Love fresh salads and flavorful food.
My favorite items from their menu:
Gyros platter - plenty of gyros meat with saffron rice and side greek salad.
Curry chicken with basmati rice - freshly grilled chicken in a light, but very flavorful curry sauce. This meal takes a little bit more time to be prepared, so if you don't have to much time to wait, you might get impatient.
When I like to eat very light, I just order one of the Panini sandwiches. Tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese, grilled. Very yummy!

Besides the full bar, they serve bottled water in the perfect size of 500ml, S.Pellegrino. 

Service is always very attentive.

The place itself is decorated very nicely. It has loads of paintings on the wall, beautiful curtains, and is lit with extravagant chandeliers. The hookah itself is fair. The first night we came, we tried the skittles flavor which wasn't bad, it just didn't hit very hard where a lot of smoke would come out. The second night we tried the thief flavor, which was my personal favorite of the two; which again, didn't hit too hard, but did taste very good. At some point in the night, I felt we needed new coals for our hookah, and the waitress told me they don't change coals, you have to buy a new refill for coals which to me is a little ridiculous (and that's an understatement). The music they play is a combination of reguaetton, cumbia, and top 40's. I actually enjoyed the music a lot. Also, on Friday nights they have a dance floor availible. I didn't go about trying the food, but if I do come back, I might just do that.

Overall; to me, this place is more bark than bite, it has a very well decorated lounge, and has fair hookah. The customer service isn't terrible, but I can see them doing more fir the customer.",_4OSxkXNB62_e4cmy8SELA,2,0,4,psRrW7eP5-Ngq2alPzogug

We waited at the entrance for a good 5 minutes but no sign of a waitress or hostess. Awkward. Once we were seated, I was pretty pumped to give this place a go. The decor is great and it was obvious that people were having a great time in the hookah lounge. 

The food was probably the worst I've had in the area, and I don't say that lightly. We ordered the appetizer sampler, which was lackluster. I'd rather buy hummus from the store. The fries were pretty gross - couldn't place the spices they used, but definitely not my taste. The falafel was alright but I've had better. 

My friend ordered the kabob sampler. The lamb was OK, nothing to get excited about. I didn't care for the chicken much either. Something about it didn't sit right with me. 

The deal breaker was the ground beef kabobs. My only description of them wouldn't be appropriate, so let's just call them straight up nasty. They were warm and cooked on the outside but the insides were cold and total mush. I have never sent back food in my life, but I can only imagine the sickness that would result if I didn't. When they came back, they were practically burnt on the outside (as kabobs should be I guess?) and the insides were slightly more solid. I've had kabobs at plenty of other places in town and in my travels, but I never have experienced this. SUCH a disappointment... It was really gross. The rice was ok but tasted really greasy, and the stewed tomato thing on the side tasted slightly of soap. The waitress offered to send it back a 2nd time but at that point I was over it and the thought of eating more turned my guts. I didn't ask for it to be removed from the bill, but they did it anyway, which was nice.

I'd go back to try out their hookah lounge and have drinks, but I'll be avoiding the food. I hope it was just a fluke but not willing to dump money down the drain again.",b1M1M84HFN8_obj_5RBWeA,1,0,2,wmkKhLgM3wG04RyUI1KF3w

4869551,2010-06-19,0,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"Paymon's (on Sahara) has gone from being a ""treat"" to more of a stand-by neighborhood restaurant, as my wife and 2 kids (10 & 7) enjoy ethnic and different places to eat.  And, what used to look like a pretty daunting restaurant (I mean, with the Hookah Lounge tag on the name and the rather imposing storefront), has become like a coffee shop or diner for us...and that's mostly a good thing.

I like the huge menu, and the ability to pick from Italian, Persian, Greek, and Indian (albeit only 3 choices) selections.  On Wednesdays, it's 25% off your entire tab, a great value!  Not being subscribers of local papers and always tossing out the ad-paks that come in the mail, I haven't seen all the 'coupons' mentioned by others.  So what about the food?

Decent job of the Chicken Curry - and the spice-to-taste option is great.  My 10-yr old enjoys it mild; I love it spiced to the max!  She wishes they put potatoes in the curry, but with the wonderful rice-bed that the curry sits on, I think she can live without the potatoes.  Maybe some veggies (besides the cursory onions) would make it a little more interesting, but hey, this isn't the Red Velvet Vegan Cafe (just down the street a bit).

Paymon's Greek platters are also good - Gyros platter, Baked Kibbe platter, etc.  I wish the Kibbe wasn't quite as ""moist"", and retained more of the beef texture, but it's still quite good.  I think the Athens Fries is a bit overrated - a little too salty for my taste.  I also enjoy the Fesenjan (Chicken breast cuts in a slightly tart/sweet yummy pomengranate sauce), but it wasn't to my wife's liking.  Your experience will very much vary depending on how you take to the specific spices used in each dish, so ask the server to elaborate.

The service is good, almost family-like, unless they are packed.  Then, a certain level of panic seems to set in, and it becomes hard to flag down your server.  Funny - I still like restaurants where the person who took your order is the same person who brings your food.  Sometime about 10 years ago, I think most ""big box restaurants"" adopted a serving method where someone more junior and less experienced than the person who took your order always brings out the food...and you lose the chance to question the food at the moment it arrives.  That is definitely a pet peeve of mine...especially when your original server who heard your specific requests doesn't come around until at least 5-10 minutes after another person has dropped the plates of food in front of you!  Annoying!  BUT...this doesn't happen at Paymon's!

Portions are large enough that I don't recall having room for dessert yet at Paymon's.  All in all, Paymon's is a handy restaurant to have close by.  They stay open to 11 pm every night, so no rushing down by 8 pm to try and make it.  Since our family has no interest in the Hookah Lounge, we don't even see the area to the left of the entrance.  The atmosphere inside is a slightly cheesy cross between Istanbul and the Taj Mahal, but it's not overbearing, and kind of grows on you.  Those who tend to always be cold should bring a sweater...unless you're going to be eating the extra-spiced version of the Chicken Curry!",xuSHcXE_3IXoRyg5LObSpA,0,0,3,1D1wLp4WjVXRjoOhcvWcFQ

5017916,2017-03-01,1,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"Came here for the hookah lounge for a friend's birthday on a Wednesday night. We made it in time for happy hour which ends at 7. 

Not going to lie the happy hour prices are pretty great. Everything is under 5 dollars for food and many drinks and cocktails are half off. Moscow mules are 4 bucks at happy hour!!  Also hookah is half off too so it's 8 dollars for a flavor. 

We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu. My favorite was the calamari. It was good quality crispy calamari with generous proportions. The wings were great as well too. It's only one flavor but I thought they were delicious. Chicken fingers and fries were good too. Pretty standard. I really enjoyed the babaganoush. I thought it had more flavor than the hummus. The pizzas weren't that great. Tasted like frozen pizzas at the grocery store. Dolmas were good but they come covered in tomato sauce I believe. The one item we ordered off happy hour was the Greek salad that was tasty as well too. 

The reason why I gave it 3 stars was for the service. I understand the place can get pretty busy but we were always trying to track them down to order stuff or get refills on waters.

The meat in the gyro I got was kind of chewy and not very fresh, and they piled all the lettuce and veggies at the bottom half of the pocket pita and the meat on the top.  Obviously that detracted from my gyro eating experience.  This pretty much sums up my feelings about that:

I just can't bring myself to give them 3 stars to even it out. 

We came here because it was highly recommended to us by a friend - which I will never trust again. 

The food was...not good. It was a notch below mediocre...

We started off with the combo appetizer platter - the only thing that was good was the dill sauce. Everything else was okay and somewhat bland or over-fried. 

For dinner, we had -

Chicken Curry - Man, I don't know what they use in this curry other than some kind of bland curry and nutmeg. It wasn't even very spicy as I requested. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish my dish...even though I was hungry. 
Also, they use precooked basmati rice...??? I don't understand any restaurant that uses precooked rice. I'm half Asian. I know when rice isn't fresh. I eat that shit every day. 

Lamb, beef and chicken kabobs - same thing. That rice...oh, that rice. And the kabobs were alright. I give them 3 stars. But, they were not that pleasing to the taste buds. 

I don't know. The server was good, but very oddly quiet...like we had to listen in very closely to hear what he was saying. He was prompt though. 

I do not recommend this place. It's outdated and maybe it was good at one time. If so, they've taken a turn for the worst. There are many other places in town that beat out this place, hands down.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,6,2,2,BqNC1_o-qGJ-TB5KhFhhGA

3. Kataifi, my favorite desert is gone!!!

I still enjoyed my Fatoush salad and Baklava desert, and teas were certainly good, but food is still far from what it is at the Maryland location.

We ordered two waters and a lemon drop hookah - not a complex order by any means but the hookah lasted for 33 minutes 7:03pm I looked at my phone as the waitress never came back around to check our hookah, waters, if we wanted anything else not to even see if things were okay. So let the waiting game begin ... 10 mins turned to 20 ... Which turned into 30 while waiting and having the waitress walk pass numerous times, but her attention was to the gentlemen (whom I believe was the manager off duty - I've seen this man here almost every time we are there and I'm sure that's not by pure coincidence) and his friend to our left, but never rendered service to us until 7:38pm to while I told her I wanted her to fix the hookah but I'll just have the check as the service was horrible. I made sure I paid with my credit card so I would be able to dispute the charge as service was never rendered. I will be avoiding this place and going to the other hookah lounge our friends go to more often, this place was good but now the service look like lost puppy dogs running around without a clue.

The local hookah master took good care of us refilling our hashish right when we needed it. We went from mint to the mad hatter and I have to say, The Mad Hatter takes the cake. 

Tonight was the happy hour in the hookah lounge and it makes it very very affordable, the decor was done well, the light is kept low and the music is turned up as the night goes on.

They had a D.J. and a room specifically for hookah which unfortunately was packed so we ended up with a table in the dining area.  Because it was dark and late it ended up being OK (and you can still hear the music). It took about 35 minutes for the Hookah to come to the table, so we had some drinks to wait. 

When the Hookah did arrive, it didn't work.  It took another 10 minutes to flag down a server to have her fix it, and then another 10 minutes for a new one to come.  Overall it took about an hour to get our Hookah.  I assumed this was an OFF night and they were understaffed but after reading other reviews it looks as if service is a common issue here. The flavors they offered were similar to other Hookah lounges, we had the ""Skittles"" flavor.  

I think the waitress felt bad for the lack of service and a table opened up in the big room (where the DJ is) and asked us if we wanted to move.

We were greeted warmly as we entered and were sat within 4 minutes. We already knew what we wanted to try so when our server came to get our drinks we also ordered our meal. We tried the Kabob Trio which was basically white basmati rice, brown basmati rice, chicken kabobs (their chicken was flavorful and really juicy!) , beef kabobs (they were SOOOOO GOOOD! Like melted in my mouth good!), and lamb kabobs (THE BEST lamb I've ever had. Not gamy, filled with flavor, cooked perfectly medium ), yogurt mix which complimented the lamb kabobs the best in my opinion, Greek salad, along with roasted onions and tomato. 

The food was so delicious and the service was good enough that I would definitely come back. I would give a 5 star, but the service wasn't as amazing as the food. I'd recommend this to friends and families. The interior was pretty, had a nice relaxing ambience. And the hookah lounge at the other room looked pretty as well! It's a must try for next time.

The icing on the cake for this place was that we got our food at a discounted rate and we didn't even know it was happening. The Kabob Trio is usually 20 dollars plus tax, but I guess they have a sale going on on Wednesdays. So instead of paying 20, we paid 16 dollars for the massive Kabob Trio :)

We weren't offered refills until we we were completely finished with the meal. And no one wanted to give us our check. The service drops this place down to 2 stars.",k5w9EN9OOr0iM_xpu57a-Q,1,0,2,iHENDNmLn9BhT8oN0UUhxg

When you claim to feature: Greek, Italian, Persian, Middle Eastern, Indian, and vegetarian dishes...you have the potential to be master of none.  Success!  This, unfortunately, is what they've become.  I've been a few times to try different items (kebabs, pasta, other)...and final and last straw was when I sent back my plate 3 times.   I'm done with Paymon's.

I've never tried their Hookah, but I've walked thru the separate room from the dining side, and it's absolutely gorgeous.  Great lighting, beautiful artwork, and well-ventilated.  For locals, it could be a great night out with the buds, or a date -- but , make sure you get this, it's not 'Vegas'.  It's nice lounge, but you can pick-it-up and place-it-down in Anytown, USA.  Parking is easy, no hassle in the private lot, no valet necessary.

In the end, Hookah wins, but the food is middle-of-the-road.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,10,7,2,Oia2przGU9sjhkOiz4ac0A

5952126,2016-09-10,1,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"My cousin recommended me to this location, I'm not a local so I wasn't sure what to expect. The place was pretty big. There is a dinning area that is separated from the hookah lounge which was cool. They also serve food in the lounge and drinks. I really like the decor they have in the lounge it was Egyptian themed. We ordered the skittles flavor which is pretty light from what I usually smoke but it was nice. They have a dance floor and a dj tonight when I went. It was a mixture of pop and Cumbia. It's a very chill homey environment. The employees came by to check on us every so often and refilled our glass of water. It was pleasant. I do wish it was a bit more hyped for a Friday night, but it was relaxing. We didn't get to try the food so I have no opinion in that area. Update* so I came back day 2 of my trip to Vegas and they don't allow coal changes and you only get one coal. That's quite unheard of. I was like 0.o not sure how I even feel about that. In order to get a new coal we would have to order a refill. . . .",9Dd1fLx93JRGypYC_3i9Zw,1,1,4,hjeDKEd23BXPPqrIpP617g
5954501,2016-08-17,1,8K3CRM4COa0SSBEvli0fJQ,"I was a first timer and I had mixed feelings. I came in around 10pm for a late dinner and the restaurant side was empty. There was one table. I literally waited 20 minutes at the front waiting to be seated. I saw a few waiters walk by but was not acknowledged. Eventually a male waiter came by to seat us.

They have a late night menu. The only difference with this menu is that they do not have the pasta offerings as they do during the day. I ordered the combination appetizer to taste most of their appetizers. That was worth it! It came with a very big portion. I also ordered the pita gyro and the chicken kabobs. Both very delicious meals. I also ordered the greek rice pudding to go. That was so yummy, it's a must! 

The waitress was nice and everything, but they should really work on having someone at the door to sit people, cause standing there for 20 minutes was a complete waste of time.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,1,2,3,Lxq0lLfgk0qVk2qUCxWA8g

But I'm just a little confused on the rules. 
Guys can't wear tank tops or hats. But the waitresses can wear tank tops with their bra straps hanging out? Then the waitress asked my boyfriend to remove his hat..fine okay. But the girl sitting across from had a beanie on. Not sure what sense that makes.",5bI67_CVxFy8PPL7E3BLqw,4,0,3,YKVRXL4uNEmVNesLh81Qfw
