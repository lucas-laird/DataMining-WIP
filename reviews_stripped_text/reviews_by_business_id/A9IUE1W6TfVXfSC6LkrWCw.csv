Got home and saw no eggs!!! checked my receipt and got charged for them too. Also i got garlic rice which was an extra .50cents ea. most of upgrades u hav to pay for extra and i didnt even know until i saw the receipt. Its pretty pricey for a food truck sized order very small. Sisig was very sour and tocino was just ok meats wer shredded. Didnt even fill me up. Id rather go get a 2 item combo at fiesta fililina across the street for $6. Probably wouldnt come back here anymore.,D3z14UGNY62U9C5hw50p_Q,1,1,1,3L_uBRmSCIwKGtASnDWATg

I have tried several things on the menu: the meat choices of beefsteak,  chicken adobo, and pork tocino in tacos, burritos, and in a bowl. It's all amazing. So good. My kids are usually finicky eaters and they hace raved about the adobo and lumpia. Today we got the white chocolate champorado and they all loved it. The taste is so genuine and fantastic. If you've never had it, try it. If you had, then you already know how awesome it is. We are definitely gonna keep coming back.

Being that I'm a pescatarian, I opted for their vegetarian (soy based bbq pork flavored) burrito and their infamous White Chocolate Champorado. Both of my choices were off the hook! I even went back to the truck and asked one of the owners if they gave me the wrong order because they were able to make this soy based burrito taste like meat! 

I was excited when I heard that White Rabbit was opening a restaurant in Vegas and I no longer have to chase them down in LA or wait til the next Foodie Fest. 

I can honestly say that since they've opened, my family and I have eaten there at least once a week. We also like the fact that the restaurant is very clean and prices are very reasonable.

328548,2015-03-03,0,A9IUE1W6TfVXfSC6LkrWCw,"Tried this place back in November, shortly after their grand opening. We were greeted and seated immediately by the friendly staff. There were 4 of us in the party so we each ordered a different fusion combo--different Filipino style meat on a separate Mexican style presentation. The food came out fast, but we could tell it was not as fresh as it could've been. It had probably been sitting in the warmer for a bit. I had no huge complaints though, as I was starving and it was past 8:00pm (they close at 9:00). I think the management sensed that our dining experience was less than what they wanted, especially since they had only recently opened (we had a lot of leftover food and politely refused when they offered us to-go containers), so he offered all of us a complimentary desert.

All in all, the food was decent. The Filipino fusion thing is big in California (Senor Sigsig, anyone?) and it's nice to have that option here in Vegas. I have a feeling it would taste better if it was fresher. I' know it can be really good from the experiences I've had with their food truck. The brick and mortar restaurant is located in an old fast food chain building--like a burger king of winchell's doughnuts in Chinatown. What made me give this place 4 Stars despite the lackluster food experience was the service. The staff was fantastic: friendly and humble. I will definitely give it another try when I get a hankering.",OKdLRP7nWMXHVHqPrkJUyA,1,0,4,R_IwUSgdeJnpg7AjfdFm7g

Prices for their food and combos aren't too bad. I've seen worse. I like this place it's pretty clean and the food is really good if you are into the Filipino fusion kind of thing.

Don't be fooled by their rice bowl - it doesn't come with egg as pictured on the menu. You order it as a side.,9OZlRmYwUlDgHm6RHjfu6g,0,0,1,Xhl7DT0FQ4pu4wEtCOPZvA

I've had the sisig fries and burrito, which are my favorite. I also tried the 3 taco combo with different meat on each: sisig, adobo, and tocino. Very good with just right amount of spiciness.

They just started offering boba, and I've had the mango slush with boba. Very good.

1409466,2014-12-05,6,A9IUE1W6TfVXfSC6LkrWCw,"I remember the first time i had White Rabbit, was when they had their truck at the foodie fest across from the Luxor. My friend and I had saw a bunch of recommendations of Yelp! Talk and had gone with what was recommended (Sisig Burrito) and had loved it ! Price was decent and the quality and size was great !

They are currently (12/04/14) soft opened. One of the workers has mentioned that today is their 3rd day they've been opened. CURRENTLY (as of around 3pm), we were told they were ONLY accepting cash but are trying to get their network back up as soon as possible for credit card usage ! 

Their GRAND opening is set for December 13th. Current hours is 12-9 i believe but after they officially open, it will be 11-11, if not later. 

Pork Sisig - deep fried pork belly, chopped pan fried medley of onions & jalapenos - (actually i just noticed the jalepeno part - not spicy at all) 

Pork Tocino - sweetened cured pork, braised, wok fried to intensify its flavors

Burrito - any meat encased in a flour tortilla along with garlic fried rice, swiss cheese, and a fried egg

So in this visit, i got the usual pork sisig burrito combo so i opt'ed for a pork tocino taco + drink. $8.95. As noted above, burrito consists of garlic fried rice, which is freshly prepared, very flavorful and fragrant. THOUGH i do recall the truck being more buttery ! pork sisig was nice and flavorful but with some tough bits here and there (its fried.. what you expect lol)... i wonder if i can request to have more jalepenos to be added in it? i found myself adding tapatio into it to add some spice but it didnt seem like the right kind of flavor for it T_T 

pork tocino taco ... very small taco, maybe 3 bites (for me). the meat flavor reminded me between a chinese bbq pork in a bun + the dried shredded pork you put in congee. not a particular favorite but wanted to try anyway ! 

The combos, you have a choice of the entree + a side + drink. the sides consist of either 1 taco, rice (white or garlic +$0.50), fries (omg they give you a ton of fries but they put a mix of salt + sugar on top... awkward imo), fried egg (2 eggs), pork lumpia (qty 6 but currently not available until grand opening), and coleslaw (vinaigrette based) 

Its a nice change from the usual chipotle or what not. Good location ! cant wait for Fluff Ice to come join them ! :D",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,14,11,4,m89VnmdfK5OLkE5-mOn_tA

I decided to order the sisig combo with eggs and free refill on drinks. I also ordered their white chocolate champorado because I thought it was a cool twist to the original chocolate version. I was ecstatic when I saw pictures on Yelp! I grew up eating chocolate champorado! Minus the salty small fish as a staple with champorados. Here it goes:

1. I came at the last hour, so for sure food was not at its best. Therefore, I will need to come back for a second round. Pow wow!
2. Sisig as the main entree was really dry. However, it had a nice crunch, heat, a good balance of acidity, and saltiness to it. But dang! There was something missing but I had a brain freeze! 
3. The better sisig version to me is right across the street at Cafe Moda. Hey, you can also do karaoke if you feel up to it! ;)
4. The eggs were served just the way I like it. The edges of their eggs were cooked crisped and yolks slightly runny.
5. The white champorado rice was served al dente. Rice is suppose to be soft, not undercooked. It would have been better if they used a good quality Belgian white chocolate and garnished it with a good quality dark chocolate to have the best of both chocolate worlds!
6. I'm not a cheffy, but I can say I do lots of Filipino cooking at home AND I've been taught from the best instructor any filipino  would want...Granny! LOL. She makes the BEST tapa, leche flan, etc. in my book :)
7. I would only give White Rabbit 3 stars for my first visit. I will come back again and hopefully have a better Filipino fusion experience so I may update my review.",pm7K54T6OmsDHREtiVBWGQ,2,1,3,C9OECAqs5HDS0QEKUuCgcQ

I tried their  3 taco combo and picked chicken adobo, Sisig, and Tocino.  Their Sisig  is still just okay, the Chicken Adobo however was very tasty and juicy, but the Tocino became my favorite quick.  The crispy red, colorful bits of Tocino were well seasoned and definitely thought the pickled cabbage that topped this yummy taco made for a perfect taco.   I also tried to hang with the Spicy Banana Ketchup and although very tasty this was just too spicy for me. 

They have quite a few options for your side choice but most were not available until further notice or for their official grand opening date.  I chose their garlic fried rice which was very good and garlicky but needed  a pinch of a salt.

Lastly we tried their Champorado which before today have never tried so I can't compare authenticity but who cares, this was delicious to me.  It's almost like a Spanish version of Arroz Con Leche (rice pudding).  This Champorado was warm sweet goodness which consisted of white chocolate and crunchy strawberry bits and was perfect for the cold weather.

Not bad for a fast food Filipino eatery, the pricing is okay and as for now I am a fan and will definitely come back and try some of their other food options, besides the food the service was pleasant too.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,6,6,4,6hriaSykUlJExmCOcVrIYg

Not sure if i will be back here especially if you have a real filipino food just a few steps down",iQ9EzFnXEY55Z0_JUpOfzg,1,0,2,DSXOZP07iSVL5dA6RINoUw
2081030,2015-01-02,1,A9IUE1W6TfVXfSC6LkrWCw,"White Rabbit was just okay. I tried the sisig burrito and made it a combo which comes with a drink and a side. Side orders consist of fries, coleslaw, lumpia, taco, etc. I chose lumpia. First things first, the lumpia pieces were TINY! They were a little bit bigger than a freaking tater tot. They weren't anything spectacular either. I bet they were frozen. Also, the drinks are only one size and they are 12oz. I didn't dine in, but I would sure hope they offer free refills if you choose to eat there.

The burrito was ok, but it was missing flavor. I wish I would have grabbed some banana ketchup on my way out because the burrito needed it badly. The sisig was crispy, but that's about all I can say about it. I didn't taste any onion or jalapeño as it says accompanies the sisig during cooking. I probably wont be back.

I've only had White Rabbit candy. Anything from this White Rabbit or the food truck prior to this? Nope, but I've heard a lot of great things about them. They do have a good fan base a lot of people like them. They may have been featured in some tv show or newspaper/magazine. Honestly I don't even know, just heard their a foodtruck and that people like them. I liked their customer service.

A group from work went here after having heard they opened. I told the staff that we've never had them and wanted something they were known for or was fans raved about. The sisig was suggested without hesitation. So I was hoping it was gonna be amazing. No one in the group liked it.  It was pretty bad that I had to eat sisig somewhere else to satisfy my craving. It was pretty dry and didn't taste right at some parts, mushy at others. It remembered me of a overcooked mixture of canned corned beef and some other items. What I got, the rice bowl combo with drink was about $8-9 food truck size and price, wasn't filling. 

I probably wouldn't go back. But at least they have other items other than sisig and have a fan base.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,9,5,2,4C_UtY2XDWyjXGvqL1ioQQ

SISIG BURRITO-it was a big burrito filled with crispy sisig, rice and a fried egg. I ate every bite w some banana ketchup and siracha. The first half of the burrito was dilicious! The pork was shredded into small pieces and you can bite into small crunchy pieces of the pork. I would Definitely share the burrito next time! It was too much to finish and by the time I got down to the last bite I felt sick from eating all that pork. 

SISIG QUESADILLA- filled with a lot of cheese and crispy pork pieces. I didn't like this one as much. The cheese melted and it made the quesadilla soggy and the grease from the cheese was dripping everywhere and it made the quesadilla very soggy! 

WHITE CHOCOLATE- DELICIOUS!!! I'm not into very sweet things. But I had a good 4-5 bites and it was very tasty and I loved how it stayed hot while I finished my burrito!

I bought a Thai tea boba, there wasn't anything wrong with the taste, however, it took them more than 20 minutes to make the boba. If fact, the two girls who ordered about 10 minutes after me got their boba first, which doesn't make any sense, since it's not like I ordered a food combo along with the boba. It's quite annoying to see that two bobas, which was ordered 10 minutes AFTER mine, came first and I had to wait another 5 minutes for them to make mine. No apologies either. Completely bad customer service, and I work retail.

Same with the food when I actually did order the combo. I ordered a rice bowl with tocino and fried eggs, and still got my food AFTER the four people whom ordered after me. I don't get why it takes that long to get my orders. The tocino was dry and the rice wasn't cooked all the way. It was perfect on the outside, but once you get on the inside, it's wet.

I can cook this stuff at home without paying $10 for a combo. The portions are not worth it either. There is nothing special about this place. Never going here again. If you want authentic, good Filipino food, I'm sure you can find it somewhere else. A bit appalled they were rated ""Best of Las Vegas 2015.""

It seemed like they were either friends of owners and workers there, or familiar customers, so that's why they were given a lot of attention.  Someone did come up to us as we were finishing up, but he seemed so distracted, that I don't think he was even listening to whatever we were conversing about.

I first tried the White Rabbit Food truck a few years ago at Foodie Fest at Silverton Casino, and back then, I thought it was okay....Fast forward a few years, and White Rabbit takes over the former Fresh Cup Spot on Jones and Spring Mountain and seeing IG photos from fellow Yelpers Andrew C. and Doriee D., the food looked good enough to convince me to give White Rabbit another try.

Presently in their soft opening stages, the ordering system is quick and easy...a ""Filipino Chipotle"" if you will....Select your Entree($6.95) of either Tacos(3), Burrito, *Quesadilla, Rice Bowl, or Carne Fries....another extra they have is Filipino style sweet Spaghetti with sausages ,which I don't care for...Then you choose from the following meat choices-

BEEFSTEAK:citrus marinated steak cooked in its own juices
CHICKEN ADOBO: braised chicken in shoyu, white vinegar, garlic, bay leaf, and peppercorns
PORK TOCINO: sweetened braised pork that is wok fried
PORK SISIG: deep fried pork belly that is chopped and pan fried with onions and jalapenos...Sisig is usually fattier and moist, because its usually made using the pig's head (ears, snout, cheek, ALL that goodness!) 
*PORK LONGANISA: chopped sweet and spicy sausage
VEGETARIAN:soy based pork(whatever that means!?!?)

Here's a tip if ordering tacos:They come overstuffed, but with TWO tortillas...divide the filling on two tortillas and you got two tacos which will make it easier to eat!...;)

Unfortunately there aren't any other additional topping options(no corn, no guac, no sour cream, etc.) other than a vinaigrette based coleslaw which are on some of their tacos. That's where the Spicy Banana Ketchup makes up for it. Try some on your order!

The best thing to do is get a combo for a couple bucks more($8.95) which includes a drink and a side. Sides($2.50 a la carte) to choose from are a taco of your choice, rice(white or garlic), fries(regular or sweet potato), a fried egg, coleslaw, or *Lumpia

*ITEMS NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE OFFICIAL GRAND OPENING, DECEMBER 13th...

I went with the Sisig Burrito Combo and chose a Beefsteak Taco as my side, and Raspberry Iced Tea for my drink since the carbonation on the soft drink machine was down at the time. My burrito came packed with sisig, garlic rice, Swiss cheese, and a fried egg. White Rabbit's sisig was a lot leaner and drier with crispy bits of good flavor(they use pork belly as opposed to the entire pig's head). what made me enjoy my burrito even more was of course, the complimentary spicy banana ketchup-SO ONO! My side order steak taco wasn't bad.

We also shared their White Chocolate Champorado which is basically Filipino style rice pudding which came garnished with what I'm assuming is dehydrated strawberries?(tasted kinda like crunch berries) good flavor and just the right sweetness, but the rice was a hair underdone. Their Creme Brulee Toast is another dessert option that won't be available until the grand opening. So far, a

The food we ordered was the beefsteak carne fries, pork sisig and pork tocino. 

The beefsteak fries was French fries with Swiss cheese topped with the beefsteak meat. The meat was super salty and the fries were drenched in salt. Every bite was basically a mouthful of salt. 

The pork sisig taco was just pork in a small taco tortilla. That's it. No toppings, no sauce, just meat and tortilla. It was also salty. The meat was not quite crispy it was more hard like sand when you chewed it. 

The last thing we ate was the pork tocino. It had a little bit of cole slaw on top. Not much flavor in slaw. The meat was salty but there was a hint of sweetness in the marinade.

The definition of ""cafe"" is a place that serves light meals. They do serve light meals here, but at a full meal price. You dig?

The food was good when they first started, but the price raised I think and thats what got me to stop going there all together. I dont think the food has changed at all, but the price sure has. I mean the carne fries are good with the eggs, but they seemed to raise the price on some of the foods. 3 tacos are the same price as the heavy and filling fries.

The service is on par with no complaints.

Environment is also on par due to it just being a cafe. The place is also more quiet when they initially started off. Nice place to go to if youre a loner like me and youre willing to spend some cash.

They stopped doing the 15% disciunts there all together,  but they just stopped doing it. If they were still doing the 15% ""VIP"" discounts I wouldnt mind the price that much.

Pros: good food, decent service, and they offer eggs which imprives most dishes.

Cons: over priced for what they serve

Advice: add eggs to your order

My all time favorite thing to order here is the Sisig fries and add egg ""omg it is to die for"" and don't forget to satisfy your sweet taste buds with there white chocolate champorado.

The service here is great. Staff is very friendly & professional. Management is amazing. They are very positive, supportive and over are great people.

There is not a lot of seating inside, but we went during their grand opening about 3 weeks ago and they did have a dj and outdoor seating with tents. Since its near chinatown, its a small building. But still nice wood tables and chairs. And limited parking- high traffic area, by 168 Market and across from Cafe Moda. 

They were very busy, long line, moves somewhat fast. It's fusion Filipino/mexican type food, with tacos, burritos, and bowls with foods like chicken adobo.. and did i mention the sisig burritos are so yummy!!!..yummy....yum! Cole slaw is good, but a little vinegary. Food is fresh, fresh, and gooooood!!!!

 Its somewhat ""fast food "" done food truck style, but still have good service. The person on register is always friendly, and they call your name when foods ready. They forgot our drinks and sides, but were still friendly and brought them over right away. While waiting in line, one of the promoters came around and handed out t-shirts. Very nice touch! 

Price is ok, its like 8 bucks for a 3 taco combo, with choice of 3 meats, 1 side, and a drink. Its a bit o'greasy, so not an everyday lunch meal...but if they park a ""truck"" outside my campus i'd def. change that last statement :)",rcJbUedWPuw5CgYDgQyF6A,1,0,4,BqdnWsQ4sjKf3H6hgbq-og

Maybe because it was their soft opening, it was kinda all over the place but:

The place is small but nice, easy to ready menu and lots of options(Soft opening so not all were available)

The Sisig which I normally am a big fan of was hard. Not crispy like I've had before but HARD. not pleasant to eat but did have alot of flavor.

Adobo was good but missing a little flavor to be honest. Had it in tacos form and on my bowl.

We were charged extra for some reason. The garlic rice was .50  extra and that was fine but that didn't explain the extra $3 charge  and on our receipt as the order was cut off where it showed the items. Didn't want to wait in line to go back and argue since we had already waited 10 min.

The kitchen staff and front were completely all over the place and no one was really focused on the customer. Waited in line for 10 min before even ordering. They were yelling at each other back and forth and the guy kept yelling at the cashier though she seemed as if she just started but instead of yelling, he could have explained it to her in a calm way...

Received food and we were missing some tacos. They did quickly give them to us but it seemed everyone who went here had to go back since they were missing an item so CHECK YOUR ORDER!!

I will try again as maybe they were having issues with it barely being open but so far unimpressed :/... Was super excited after having great food and service at their food truck.",j97PtHlFcx7jhmV_1eQdtw,2,1,2,1-rM7u7um1nA9QHbDycrPQ

The tacos were good. A lil sour for my taste when it came to some of the meats. The flavor of the chicken adobo and beefsteak was a tad overwhelming, if thats possible. But the coleslaw was a good touch though even with the hint of vinegar . My fave meat has got to be the pork tocino. It has enough sweetness to it, and a bit of the crunch. Even jalapeños were added in there, and damn! Lol. I did try the tocino with the fries, and 2 eggs on the side. I recommend doing that! So good!! The egg on them fries are pretty legit! Also, the white champorado was super super sweet. Couldn't take more than two bites. The sisig burrito was pretty good as well. Its apparently the fave dish, and it wasn't too bad. A bit sour, but I'm guessing it's the cheese.


**edit: They raised their prices and the hype has died. The combo is like $11 now. It's not worth the price anymore. I just had their tocino fries again, and it was burnt to crisp and hard to chew. They do serve boba now, but it's def not the best I've had. That's too bad. oh, and they don't take the discount cards anymore. Shitty.

Every time they came to the foodie fest I always missed out so I knew I finally had to get over there and see what they were all about. Filipino fusion dishes served up here and the menu is simple. 

Choose your protein and choose your carb. You can have any meat served in a burrito, tacos, rice bowl, or fries. Quesadillas are coming soon as posted on the menu. 

They're famous for the sisig so I chose that in a burrito and sampled the other 3 meats in tacos. Tocino (sweet pork), beefsteak ( marinated in soy and lemon cooked with onion), chicken adobo ( cooked in soy and vinegar) they also have a vegetarian option of some sort if you're not into meat. 

Sisig Burrito - I really feel like this is the star of the meats offered here as it was my favorite I tried. I'm not typically a fan of sisig because other places serve it with big chunks of fat and is not crispy like the dish here. The sisig here deep fried and crispy and a little spicy from the jalepeno. This was perfect in the burrito served with garlic rice, fried egg and Swiss cheese. The garlic rice could have been more flavorful IMO but this was my favorite. 

Tacos - we tried Tocino, beefsteak, and chicken adobo. These were messy. The little corn tortillas were stuffed with meat, that isn't a bad thing but the wet slaw was falling out all over the place. The beefsteak was my favorite of the three but I would recommend the bistek in a rice bowl to soak up the yummy juices. Rice bowl comes with eggs and garlic rice. The adobo didn't quite taste like adobo IMO. The Tocino was ok. If you come here to White Rabbit it's pretty obvious that the star of the menu is the sisig.

The cole slaw was very eh. It basically was just sliced cabbage drenched in vinegar. Wasn't creamy at all, and I could only tolerate about 2 bites because the vinegar just overpowered everything. The sisig burrito was okay. The sisig seemed very dry and tasted more like old lechon. Didn't seem freshly made at all. White chocolate champorado however was the Saving grace of the meal.

Being that my wife has Guam, Filipino and mexican heritage It was going to be interesting comparing some things to her family recipes. They converted an old Taco Bell into a cozy spot for some great asian fusion. We will not discuss the parking lot which is not within their control. As we entered we were greeted by staff and started to check out the menu. I ordered the Pork Sisig with Garlic rice the wife had the chicken adobo with same rice side. We also ordered the asada fries. The Pork sisig was pretty tasty. Fried pork set with garlic rice. The garlic rice has the right balance to offset some of the spice in the sisig. I recommend you get this with whatever dish you order beats plain white rice any day. The chicken adobo was rightly balanced with the vinegar note it needs. Have to say it was close to comparison to what the spousal uni'ts family makes. Adobo should give you that tingle in your mouth that starts the drooling when you get that first whiff this had that and therefore gets a plus to us. The asada fries were cheesy and piled high with a marinated beef. The beef had a teriyaki tang to it reminded me of something I had as a kid growing up. It is always good when food can take you back to a different time in your life, shows they are doing something right. So, we had to do the dessert round while here as well. White Chocolate Chomporado. This super sweet rice not pudding dish. I want to describe the flavor but you have to taste it to understand just how good this is.

I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other dishes. The team and staff here are great. Has a family atmosphere. You can tell they take pride in their heritage and asian style. I recommend you all try it. You will not be sorry.

One thing to remember about Filipino food is that they love: salt, sugar, pork, anything fried. Which is definitely why their titos and titas have diabetes/ heart disease / kidney disease.

Choose your meat: beefsteak, chicken adobo, pork tocino, pork sisig, longanisa or vegetarian. VEGETARIAN??? At a Filipino place? Is it made of pork somehow? Aysusmaryosep, real BEIGE TABOLS? No, it's tofu.

Choose where to put the meat: tacos, burrito, quesadilla, rice bowl or carne fries.

Choose your sides if you wish: 1 taco, rice, fries, fried egg, Lumpia and coleslaw.

They have combos that come with an entree, side and a drink. You can also get Filipino spaghetti (which is sweet), desserts (white chocolate champorado, Creme brulee toast...they don't have ube or Milo macarons at this location...at least natchet).

Beefsteak - bistek in Filipino. Beef slices marinated in citrus, soy sauce and onions then cooked.
Chicken adobo - it's only like the national dish in the Philippines, hello? Chicken cooked in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and bay leaf.
Tocino - sweet cured pork similar to ham but sweeter because...well, it's Filipino!
Longanisa - Filipino sausage usually eaten for breakfast.
Pork Sisig - this is all you need. The end. Nah, I'll go ahead and explain why this is special. It's finely chopped fried pork: skin, fat and meat. With a bit of ginger and jalapeños.
Champorado: chocolate porridge usually enjoyed on a rainy day and paired with salty fried fish. Their version is made with white chocolate and topped with a strawberry.

Pork Sisig Burrito: the best item on the menu. Crispy Sisig, garlic rice and fried egg in a burrito. 5/5

If you feel lots of guilt eating all the fatty food, maybe, the best option is vegetarian tacos paired with sweet potato fries. Be prepared to smell like oil when you leave this place. They only have maybe 10 tables so, you either take your food to-go or wait for a table. It's located in the same lot as Wendy's Noodle Cafe and across the street from another Filipino place that serves good Sisig, Cafe Moda but if you're like me and you're not a big fan of headaches and karaoke then, come to White Rabbit.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,13,10,4,5yPGgnhhsiyOy9TedTgoRg

The items I had were:

Beefsteak w/ Rice - It was good...I fuck with it just nothing memorable....

Pork Sisig w/ Rice - ehhhhh not really our favorite....

Chicken Adobo Tacos - Probably the best food item we had...fuckin' good...

Lumpia - ehhh had better

White Chocolate Champorado - Never had this dessert or any dessert with ""sticky rice"" as I don't usually fuck with Asian food like that but it was similar to tapioca pudding but with rice...was different as I never view rice as a dessert but it was cool

Creme Brule Toast - Similar to french toast made with texas toast and caramel sauce....

I wish I can give this 3.5 stars because it is better than average...some items that I wanted to try that were previously in the LA menu (like the spam burger) were not present here....has potential to be good if they can fix the flavor to pop as currently it is very subtle...(maybe i'm too spoiled when it comes to food)....",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,1,0,3,8mO-MjnZ0fENqSLQaukRuA

My personal favorite is pork tocino fries with a side of lumpia! Try their white chocolate champorado as well. It is so delicious.",didQq47ggh7iAxd5_wkuQQ,5,0,5,ADmd4d-bkRtXwOl9Yx0Drg

When I think of filipino, I think of home and my dad's homemade cooking. I'm super excited to say that White Rabbit has done that and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's looking for some good fusion food.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,1,0,5,Acav8WNy6tk4GGG_Wm840g
5918824,2014-12-23,8,A9IUE1W6TfVXfSC6LkrWCw,"Okay. Glad there are other reviews posted for White Rabbit Fusion Cafe already. I been holding off on posting a review for it since it, well it did not exactly wow the F out of me. And 3 stars is the best they can get out of me with their soft opening effort.

But first let me just explain what White Rabbit Fusion Cafe is to those not familiar with this food truck from California turned brick and mortar LV restaurant.  It is Filipino comfort/street food proteins (Chicken Adobo, Pork Sisig, Pork Longanisa, etcetera.) packaged in traditional Mexican food delivery vessels (i.e., your tacos, burritos, quesadilla).

The portion is just underwhelming for me, but I can pack a lot of food away, so I am biased.  But they have Tofu on the menu for vegetarians.  The concept of someone  ordering something vegetarian at a Filipino Fusion place is just so foreign to me.  But it is available.

Pricing seems high to me for what you get.  The fact that it is in or near one of the busier plazas in the ""Chinatown District"" makes their pricing strategy suspect.  If it was something served from a food truck at FoodieFest,I can see the reasoning behind the carnival-like pricing, but not such a great incentive from a brick and mortar operation.  I know, it does not make sense, but I stand by my opinion.

The cashier, even though this was her first job ever, was nice.  The order was prepared quickly and correctly, which is expected but still nice.  My Pork Sisig Burrito had a good ratio of pork sisig to rice ratio, but was on the dried side.  Portion seems to be designed for a growing 5 year old or someone on a weight loss plan.

Still just a 3 star-ish experience overall for me. But I will chalk it up to their Pork Sisig not being as good as I had expect it to be, and give them another chance trying something else from their menu on a future visit.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,12,8,3,2H3V0SyQ8FoNigwjAWeZIA

I decided to get the adobo burrito which turned out to be sweeter than expected but the garlic white rice was a great balance. The service was good and the food was served swiftly. I opted for dessert and the white chocolate  champorado was excellent, it came with strawberry topping so good. I will be recommending this to all of my friends and family as well as their friends and family. Give them a try!",EEroldbqNNjuSf2pZw5kYg,0,0,5,fQpN7Edtex4p2SKxTFOMrg
