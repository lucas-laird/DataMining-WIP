If you are American, this place isn't for you. The 2 ladies that work there don't speak English. We ordered the Beef Pho. She didn't mention to us that it had all the authentic fixes of tendon and tripe. Even after trying to pick them out, I kept getting bites of tendon and fatty meats that all tasted like tripe. My gf and I would have appreciate it if she could mention of we want all of that. 

The spring rolls were worst I've ever had in a Vietnamese restaurant. They used some really thick soft soggy noodles that pretty much ruined it. All we could eat was their croissant sandwich which was also just ok. 

I don't see how anyone could give this place more than 2 stars. None of the food there stands out. The prices aren't great. There are so many more choices of better Vietnamese and other Asian foods on Spring Mountain.",8nlC7IIHJYSddnc75o5xmw,2,0,1,91cDV4udY6ZXBNziYXl5VA

I heard the owner is the chef who went to Le Cordon Blue in Paris and also a  part time chef at M Resort.

360862,2016-01-14,1,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"The price is reasonable. 
The food was not good. The bread was too soft and lack substance. I prefer french bread or baguette as what a Vietnamese sandwhich should be (Dakao or Lee sandwich).
The coffee is not Tradional Ice Coffee (Saigon 8 and other Vietnamese restaurant have better iced coffee). It is just another expresso. I can go to Starbuck for this. I am not impressed.
The dining room is pleasant.
The almond croissant is ok, better than Dakao.
I tried the bun bo hue the next day and was not impressed. In my opinoin. Please never eat BUN BO HUE at a sandwich shop. They always substitute the fully flavored cha hue with the gio cha used in their sandwich. BBH never tastes good in a small sandwhich shop since the broth needs large volume of meat and bone to render its traditional deep and rich fkavor.. The substitute meat is cheap and has no flavor compared to the Tradional cha Hue served throughout Orange County in CA and a handful of traditional Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. 
This is just another  sandwich shop with a little fusion of french cuisine. I would not come here for Vietnamese food but for some quick expresso and croissant.",lFlJGqYcirNXWo1WZ2xqpQ,0,0,2,0-aD-oaNWIZrtO_CbEaEeA

1030488,2016-01-16,2,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"This restaurant has been a popular topic lately so I thought I'd visit this place a few times and put in a few words. First off, parking is annoying because it's in a small little building and when their neighbor restaurant SK gets full, there is no where to park for this cafe, hence it can be a little difficult to get to sometimes. The interior of this place is just this small cute cafe, nothing much to it. I would of like to see a little more effort to decorate the place. It lacks a welcoming atmosphere in my opinion, this could be fixed with tvs or music. My last note about the interior design is that the table a bit uncomfortable for a cafe, would of like to see a section with maybe sofas and board games.

If you're wondering if I recommend this restaurant, let me first start by saying that they are still in a soft opening. There are very few item currently on their menu and they are still open to suggestions to adding more items. So if you want to have the full experience of this place, I'd wait till their menu is fully developed before coming.

On to the food!!! 

MACAROONS: They currently have a few flavors on their macaroons. They will be adding more, but Durian seems to be the popular flavor right now. My personal favorite happens to be their Yuzu Lemon. Do I think it's the best macaroon? No, but I do like to buy their macaroons because it's cheaper than other places (only $1.50 a piece). 

PASTRIES: Their other pastries seem to be the talk of the town right now. I highly recommend the Almond Croissant. I personally don't like it because I'm not a fan of almond, but everyone else around me seems to be addicted to it. My family and friends like to buy a bunch of them and eat it for breakfast every morning. They sell for $3.00 each. Now if you're wondering about their regular croissant, I have to admit that it's not the best, I actually find it's texture to be a bit hard. I prefer soft and crispy croissants. Their orange sesame balls are pretty good, this place may have the best ones in Vegas. Lastly, their highly recommended Pate Chaud was not a hit for me. If you don't know what it is, it's a Vietnamese French flakey pastry with meat inside. I like that it's made fresh, and the meat inside is tasty, but the texture of outside is not satisfying.

BANH MI (SANDWICHES): I highly recommend the Cha Pate Sandwich (pork roll with pate)!!!!!! I really like the meat and pate that they use for it and it is overall very tasty. Their Shu Mai Sandwich (meatball) is good, but it's not satisying because they barely give any meat inside. And their Dac Biet Sandwich (combination meats) was disappointing considering the other two were great. The meat they use for this sandwich tasted weird to me. 

SOUPS: The owner of this place highly recommended their Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef Noodle Soup) and said if we found a place in Vegas that makes it better, our bowls would be free....well sorry to say, it wasn't as great as he made it to be. The bowl was only half full when they brought it out and it had absolutely no presentation whatsoever. They tried to keep the price down on this dish, but then took away the full portion. I rather they charge an extra dollar or two and bring out a full bowl of Bun Bo Hue. Taste wise....meh...it was okay. Now their Hu Tieu dish was again good tasting, but it didn't stand out. The broth was probably the best part of this dish but overall, it also lacked presentation.

COFFEE: .......all I can say is that it's coffee. Not great, but not terrible. It's just coffee. I honestly was expecting better coffee since it is a cafe.

Overall, what did I think of this place? If you want my honest opinion, this place can do great this if they just focus on being a cafe. They should improve their coffee, have more pastry variety, keep doing their sandwiches, and add some small dishes/appetizers/finger foods at a low price. I think that they can keep their three soup dishes on their menu, change up the presentation, make sure the bowl is full of food, and not add anymore soup dishes. They can add a few more entrée dishes, but only a few. I rather they have less on their menu and execute them well then have a full menu and lack quality. Glad this place exists, a few changes need to be made and they will do well.

***Update: okay, I don't usually complain about service, but there is only one efficient waiter at this restaurant.....the waiters kept bringing food out to the wrong tables and they always seemed confused as to what is going on. I recommend that they number their tables to start. And I recommend that they have better communication with one another in the kitchen.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,7,5,4,PZWScLeERWQQIA22QObwdQ

Total cost less then $13. Not bad. Service was eeeeh. Some if not most Asian restaurants except for the Japanese are not to keen about proper customers service and/or proper greeting....that's all I have to say about that. Anyhow the Health District graded the restaurant A. Which is why we ate there. I'm always weary about the restaurants in Chinatown. Cleanliness is a must. But I do have to add that there was a strange aroma in the air when we first entered, like bleach or some cleaning agent. I can't put my finger on it?!

BO BUN HUE: Spicy beef noodle soup was both spicy and noodley, broth didn't quite have the depth as elsewhere but the noodles themselves were noticeably fresh and beef was tender. Takeout order came with ample fresh veggies.
SPECIAL DAC BIET BAHN MI: Classic sando, done just right. With the other baked goods on the menu, I had hoped the bread would be extra special here but it's fairly standard, but also fresh.
PATE CHAUD: Okay, hold up. The pastry was beautiful, filling was generous and flavorful, and price was right at under $2.
VIETNAMESE COFFEE: Made to your preferred strength and sweetness, consider asking for light ice. Goes great with anything in the pastry case.

For the most part, you can't go wrong... which is good, because if you're anything like me, you'll be immediately entranced by the pastries on display and mess up your own order.

2081010,2016-01-20,5,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"This particular space has been occupied by at least 4 different businesses in the past 2 years and was vacant for some time. It seems like overnight I saw signage for So Good Cafe-bakery fusion pop up and I was definitely intrigued. I quickly learned the food is Vietnamese, but they also have pastries. 

I walked in to get some coffee and food for some coworkers and I on a Saturday morning. Although they were open for about an hour, they hardly had anything ready. The display cases were mostly bare. Things were still being baked and while I appreciate everything is fresh, I would have liked to have had a selection to choose from. I was greeted by the owner himself. A very nice man who works as a pastry chef at the M resort. He told me he was tired of working for others and decided to take matters into his own hands and open up his own shop. He recommended the almond croissants that just came out of the oven. He said they are better than drugs. Well who could resist that?? I got 2 of those and also 2 Vietnamese iced coffees. Other menu items include pho, and bahn mi sandwiches, among other Vietnamese favorites. 

The croissants were soooo good. They were still hot and I loved everything about it. The croissant was buttery and flaky with lots of thinly sliced almonds garnishing the top. And the inside was filled with a warm almond paste. The coffee was good, very strong. I originally asked to get a mocha but for some reason they didn't have it even though it was on the menu. I found it odd that the cup was only full 3/4 of the way. Not sure if this is standard or what. I was disappointed I didn't get to try any macarons, but this just means I have to come back and I will.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,12,7,4,7TwjB0Akccupe4CTFXfRrg

We came in and ordered a few things to try. I tried the Bun Bo Hue, Banh Mi sandwich, the Pate Chaud and their almond croissant. 

The Bun Bo Hue was kind of like dumpster diving - there wasn't much in the bowl. The flavors were kind of bland too which was unexpected. I wouldn't order it again. 

The banh mi sandwich was also really Jenny Craig on the filling - namely the amount of meat inside. The bread was okay. Given the competition in the area - they need to step up their game. Totally pass on this.

The almond croissant was kind of disappointing. It sagged in the middle which meant the dough could not sustain the filling inside. The pastry was not airy or flaky enough to make the muster.

The pate chaud was pretty good - maybe the star of the meal. The pastry was flaky and served hot. The filling inside was pretty delicious and flavorful.

Service was friendly if not a bit overwhelmed easily with multiple tables.

We ordered pho with rare beef, spring rolls, and a Vietnamese sandwich (get two for the price of one!) Bahn Mi Cha Pate and a Thai tea. 
I really enjoy a good Thai tea but not a fan of boba or pre-made Thai teas..this Thai tea was probably a mix. The sandwiches, spring roll and pho were good but would have appreciated having the spring rolls cut in halves; the peanut dip for the rolls was without peanuts.

2390404,2016-02-15,0,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"Cafe is about 5 weeks old.  I came at around 8:30 in the morning.  The open sign wasn't on, but I tried the door and they were open.   I had to try to get the employees' attention when I walked in as everyone was in the kitchen.   Once I got their attention, I ordered a banh mi dac biet, a Viet coffee, and since the almond croissants were just coming out of the oven, I couldn't say no!   The owner was every nice.  I was chuckling while reading the other Yelp reviews as I kind of got the same dialogue from the owner as others.  Yes, he's an executive pastry chef from the M hotel, he's studied in France and goes back there frequently for conferences, wanted to start his own business, hoping to expand to So Cal, and the almond croissants are better than drugs.   I like his enthusiasm!   

Onto the food review, with the sandwich, the bread is the star.  Really flaky on the outside with the hint is butter (or it could be margarine, I can't tell the difference) which makes it really rich.  There is very little of the inside of the bread which is perfect to get the crunch chew effect.  The filling is minimal and the pate has a super intense taste, which is lovely.  I will probably order double meat next time as I like it meaty.   I had to split it up and have half for later as it was a bit richer than I'm used to.  He asked me how I liked my ice coffee and I like it not too sweet.  I'm not sure if this is because it was first thing in the morning, but I like being asked.   Other Yelpers are correct, the coffee doesn't come full.  The almond croissants were not as flaky as I expected and just a tad on the sweet side, but the almond paste and sliced almond are plentiful. It's a newer store so the credit card machine was giving them problems, but I'm sure they will work it out as they chug along.   Signage is a little hidden.   I would go back and try the noodles next time.  Overall 4.5 stars, but worth a round up to 5 stars.

I ordered 15 mins ago and repeated what I ordered to her and said.. do you have my order placed? She acted like it was and said oh yes they're working on it. Another 10 mins go by and it's hard not to see me sitting at the counter staring at 6+ staff members going in and out of the kitchen with food and to go orders. I must be invincible?! Asian girl with icy blonde hair isn't exactly that hidden.

After another 10 mins... yeah I know they're really testing my patience. Then, the same server, who gave me the menu again 10 mins ago came back to me and asked.. what did you order again? I told her and mins again are going by. 

I get up from the counter seating and wait, yet again.. this time by the cashier. I see the girl that took my order 35 mins ago and ask her what happened to my order? She apologized and said the kitchen was busy?! I told her how long is it going to be??? And she said another 10 mins... uhm I have no time for that and told her to cancel my order and I'll just pay for this vietnamese ice coffee. She goes.. you don't want your macaroons either? Hmmm waiting almost 45 mins and you asking if I still want my macaroons lol?!?!! No cancel everything. 

She goes I'll remember you and everything will be on the house next time. It would be proper to fix things right then and there, because after that experience... why would I even want to come back for a next time?! I said no thanks, paid for my coffee, and left.

Hungry and not having anytime to eat now, but this strong brewed bitter vietnamese iced coffee I've been sippin' on for over 40 mins. Feelin' real ill leaving this place and I didn't even get to taste anything! Just this coffee that's turning up my system. Wonderful.

For a new business, there are still many things that needs to be addressed and worked out. Good luck in fixing those, especially waiting for sandwiches that should take no longer than 10 mins. Full staff, watching other guests come in AFTER me, getting and finishing their meal.. Even leaving before me is no excuse of the ""kitchen was busy"" for me to wait that long and then want me to wait another 10 mins?! I have places to go and people to see. I don't have time to wait another 10 mins, which could possibly turn out to be another 40+ mins!?!! Forget that. I didn't order a damn well done steak smh.

Upon entering the aroma of fresh baked goods was nice.
We thought the bread was excellent, great balance of aroma, crunchiness, and textures, good amount of meat in the sandwich, which is a plus for me. 
Did not care for the Vietnamese ice coffee, it has a burnt coffee bean smell + after taste was a little bitter for me. 
The croissant looked good but too full for anything else.",rLfg_CmTr8YvfHClN-uJ8w,0,0,4,19l4H5q5vxLFus88HhUOow
2698456,2016-01-14,1,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"I fancy all things ""hot and new"" on Yelp and I was not disappointed at all with this new Vietnamese establishment.  This place has been open for less than a month and they are still adding items to their currently limited menu. I ordered the Pork Special bahn mi sandwich, a bowl of Beef Pho, and 6 macaroons. 

The bahn mi sub-style sandwich came first cut into 3 pieces.  The bread was definitely baked fresh.  A nice and crispy outer layer reveals a soft, warm, chewy center underneath as you take each bite.  The standard veggies were there and seemed to be in good ratio to the pork.  I'd say it's one of the better bahn mi's on this side of town. 

The Pho came second in a large sized bowl.  There were plenty of noodles and meat to satisfy a hungry patron.  The meat consisted of pho beef balls, sliced rare steak, and sliced well-done steak.  While there were plenty of meat in the dish, an option for other additions like tripe or tendon was not currently present.   This could change as the menu progresses and I certainly hope so.  The broth was clean and I finished it to the last drop.  

The macaroons were great!  They would be double the price on the Strip but the quality here was top-notch.  They seem to have different flavors each day so be sure to ask.  6 for $8 was not bad at all and the flavors we decided to try were nutella, yuzu, coconut, and mango passion.  Yuzu was by far my favorite.  It is a tart flavor similar to a lemon or mandarin orange.  The rest were just as good and a perfect way to finish the meal. 

I will definitely be back to try their bo bun hue and spicy beef soup as well as their other sandwiches.    There's a lot of potential for this place which plans to bring on coffees and teas, more varieties of sandwiches and soups, and hopefully even more delicious desserts!

2710044,2016-01-05,0,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"Service was on point and was welcomed very warmly by the staff. I visited on two different days and tried two different sandwiches. The pork belly sandwich and meatball sandwich. It's your traditional Vietnamese sandwich (sub style) with fresh bread that honestly beats a lot of local restaurants. Personally, it's hard for me to enjoy a Vietnamese sandwich because of the bread either being too hard or the vegetables do not taste good at all. So Good Cafe's bread is crispy but not hard, also soft after the initial crispy bite.

The location is somewhat convenient with decent parking spots compared to other Spring Mountain plazas - that are almost always busy and a pain to get in and out of. Indoors, you will find a spacious set up of sit down tables you can leisurely enjoy your meal, but also can walk up to the counter to order to go.

The menu is a bit lacking since the establishment just recently opened, as are the decore. However, I feel that this (family run) restaurant has the potential to grow into a local hot spot for all ages. I'm excited to try out their cafe style drinks and their noodles when I have the time instead of ordering to go prior to work as I'm excited to see what ""So Good Cafe"" has to offer its consumers in the future.

So it's a restaurant that serve Vietnamese food but they also try to make it into a cafe where ppl can chill and hang out on their computer. They have some different types of noodles like pho, bun bo hue and hun tien(I believe),, but they have have pastries like pate chaud and almond crossiant and macaroon. Now, I never got to try their macaroon cuz they ran out, so I can't comment on that, but if your restaurant got freaking macaroon on the wall as decorations, you'd think they would have it, since it's like their specialty?? Lol

The pate chaud was ok, it was just some meat on a crusty pasty and I didn't really care for it. I also tried the almond croissant, and the owner said that it is like drug and I thought it was ok too lol. Also tried their pho and it was decent but their bun tien is really good, it got little eggs and different meat in it, really tasty.

The service wasn't that good when we went there, we had to keep trying to get someone to get more water or whatever, and half of the condiments on the table are empty like the pepper or hot sauce etc and we had to get up and get our own napkins and spoons and chopsticks from another table. And it wasn't busy when we went, there was maybe 3 other tables at that time, the dude that works there could've refilled everything so the patrons doesn't have to get up and get everything.",e-0zEgp_EK9oBbyQpyI71w,0,0,3,aLHsEiYo-UagraEjFCPJlA

The pho, on the other hand, wasn't amazing. It tasted a bit too strongly of star anise. My boyfriend said it was alright, as the size was huge and meat was good.

The pate chaud was mediocre. There was a choice of pork and chicken, and we picked the chicken.  There was hardly any filling in it, but the bread was flaky. 

The almond crossaint was excellent. Very light and flaky bread with slightly sweet almond fillings. Very highly recommended. 

Both of the noodle soups were okay. Not the best we have had, but the broth was kind of bland and not flavorful enough.

The hu tieu w/ broth and bun bo hue were both very delicious. Everything was fresh and the soups weren't too oily as compared to some other places. I also enjoyed the banh mi special. I like how the bread is crisp yet not too hard so it doesn't stab the roof of my mouth when I take a bite.

And the pastries! The almond croissant is my fave!! If I could only eat one form of carbs for the rest of my life, this would be it. The macaroons are amazing here as well. The flavors really come out and it's not overpowered with sweetness.

Come and check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",Mj5HtrDFyvv1Mt09Igmu5Q,1,1,5,NTRBJ2QHmMYaOCBhCP7rdA
5214726,2016-03-04,0,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"I'm always worried when I go into a new restaurant and see a menu oversaturated with items.  Choice is good, but when it can sometimes be overwheming and affect the quality of each dish. So Good offers no such menu, but instead welcomes you with a clear and concise menu, adding to the quality of each item. I highly recommend one of their meat pastries, which name escapes me at the moment, as well as their special sandwhich. The service was nothing short of excellent in which me and my girlfriend were treated as old friends even though this was our first (of several) visits. As I am writing this, I am eagerly awaiting to try their almond croissant, which I hear is one of the very few places in Las Vegas that serve this.",w5HcCmSGPaYOEclBs9wyog,0,0,5,svgK0qMlN6CXkj-tbx2BOA

Our server couldn't even bothered talking to us. When we asked for a check she just ignored us and went to play with her phone behind the counter......!",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,6,3,2,yJ1bCxOiGgtg2_JWNvYV6g
5319706,2016-01-20,9,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,"I keep going back and forth as to whether or not I should give this place 3 stars or 4 stars. As soon as I got in, I got a super warm welcome. Like an uncle I have not seen in a long time and he was very excited to see me. He was very attentive and eager to make sure I eat all the yummy treats!

Their menu has very few items...I was actually expecting them to just be a bakery but they have pho, sandwiches, bun bo hue, etc.

Pho:
It was hot and had a good ratio of noodles to meat. The most inexpensive bowl of pho in town! Not the best but good 3/5

Almond Croissant:
Buttery and flaky without being dry as the desert. It's a simple croissant. 3.5/5

Macarons:
We tried all the flavors they have: Nutella, Mango Passion Fruit, Durian, Yuzu, and Coconut. Ok, I didn't eat the coconut macaron only because I don't like coconut anything. They're cold and taken out of the fridge when you order them. I recommend letting them get to room temp before eating. Otherwise, they have a I-just-came-out-of-the-refrigerator taste and the texture is off. At room temp, the filling is nice and softer, and the macaron shell is crunchier. Funny enough, their Nutella macaron isn't my favorite. But I enjoyed the durian the most. 3.5/5

Pate Chaud:
We tried the pork and the chicken. Flaky pie with generous amounts of tasty filling. The pork has more flavor and more memorable than the chicken. 4/5

Towards the end of the meal, they asked us about what we thought about the food. They were really concerned about feedback. This is rare in Chinatown!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,11,13,4,iN8Gbk5c27End6VxDxeZVQ
5324305,2016-03-10,0,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,The french bread here is absolutely to die for. If this were a radio show I'd get one and just press down so people could hear the lovely crunch of the outside crust give into the smooth cloud-like inside of the bread itself. The Bahn Mis were delcious as was the Almond bread. You just can't go wrong with the pastries.,6YtlTxrAu3rkf4LAwnabJw,1,0,5,Gnj0xahng3VxKmXU4ECE1g
5335012,2016-07-23,0,L6RxkP8dneVGelDLUhjCug,I moved here in February and have been searching the Vegas area for the best pho and bahn mi in. I think I found one here at So Good Cafe. The bahn mi sandwich was crispy and fresh. Just enough spread of the sauce. Pho broth was amazing. I could've eaten the  pho just the way it was made if I didn't feel like adding more spices and herbs to it. Definitely coming back here.,jg353tVqZPrjFeoqq1t1gw,0,0,5,O7AgXQ45NacKW37LjXVAxg

Opened about 3 weeks ago, for now they have a limited menu, to me it's not a problem, I prefer QUALITY over quantity! The server told me that they baked their macaroons in house, right now come in a few flavors: Chocolate,coconut, DURIAN, mango passion fruit. Also they bakes a bunch of other French Vietnamese pastry like croissants & pâté chaux. Also have Bánh Mì, buy 2 get 1 free! They encouraged feed backs since they're new, so do tell them if you want them to improve something, but so far, I thing they do a pretty good job! I have a suggestion though, I know they try to attract a variety of customers, they should offer blood cake for the spicy beef noodle to the Asian patrons as an option.",ylNoap5vLFZCPIjwBIdnYA,3,5,5,o31-uRPLh8GoNTPUHLE-Pg

While sipping on our coffee, the owner promptly brought out an almond croissant cut into 4 pieces for us to try.  We were delighted and grabbed our piece of the almond croissant.  We were in awe of this little almond croissant, so light and flaky and crunchy with hints of sweetness and almonds.  

Our orders of pate chaud arrived - pork and chicken.  - Very light and flaky and tastes so good with the right amount of ingredients to blend the meat together.  

We decided to order another almond croissant 'cos it was ""So Good!"". 

We also ordered 6 macarons - 3 durian (of course, we love durian!), 1 nutella, 1 mango passionfruit and 1 coconut.  All very delicious!  I love the durian!

The owner asked us where we were from and we said ""Canada"" but ""originally from Singapore"".  He proceeded to tell us his love for Singapore as he worked there before and how he has friends still there.  Of course, all Singaporeans or people who love Singapore will always talk about the food back home.  We started to reminisce about the foods of Singapore like Chili Crab and Kueh Lapis.  Maybe he should have named his restaurant ""Shiok!"" as the translation is ""So Good!""

Very reasonably priced.  Will definitely come back when I'm back in Vegas.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,3,1,5,r4AnIRD-T0yA8vW2_t0IBw
