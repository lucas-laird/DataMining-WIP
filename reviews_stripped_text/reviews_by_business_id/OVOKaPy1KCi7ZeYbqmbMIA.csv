After about 2 minutes of waiting finally one of them pointed a finger at the cash register rudely commenting, ""Pay over there."" I told them that I was unhappy with their service and went and bought food at Chipotle and on the way out of the food court the cashier directed his attention to me and sarcastically called out, ""See you next time sir."" with a snarky tone in his voice.",Q2u3VOFRtctaJP5ifP-6KQ,1,0,1,c6sO4NPO8S6Nti2F2mrjWg

The pricing is very affordable, especially for being on the strip. Great value here!",_VYRVjNzmRsLt8FndO23IQ,0,0,4,FRqTRvdM7jcrCmIE5m6_SQ

2228968,2016-12-13,0,OVOKaPy1KCi7ZeYbqmbMIA,Good place if your trying to eat on the strip for cheap. Pizza is good for the price. Did not look very good on display. If you decide to come here just order a slice don't order the bread with cheese in the middle too much bread.,zlIvywemTixVZa9uu80hKg,0,0,4,AOEv-vlaA83by1sfXZHqUA

3822610,2015-10-05,0,OVOKaPy1KCi7ZeYbqmbMIA,"Pizza by the slice in the same food court as Chipotle and Panda Express. I showed up at around 11pm looking for a slice. They didn't have any pepperoni available, which seemed strange. When I asked, the worker didn't bother to offer or tell me when a pepperoni would be available again, so I ordered a pepperoni & jalapeño slice. 
I also got some cheesy knots (I think that's what they called them). The pizza looks cold and nasty behind the glass, but they actually stick your slice in an oven once you order it. 
The total for the pizza and knots together was about $10.00, which is surprisingly affordable for The Strip. That's a plus. Pizza is just so-so. The jalapeños seemed excessive, and even after being warmed up, they're pretty much raw. 
Don't come here expecting great pizza, come here if you're drunk and want something cheap and greasy.",3r9TShxIxajLojvydaIhhg,1,0,3,y5KYmhU9KLcXzIsDSB8mEg

 I waited a little long and this pizza did not taste good cold. Usually great quality pizzas taste good cold, but it tasted pretty decent warm.",OXTECc-hei5D-ONm39rwNA,0,0,4,Q87ZfbiynS4RH-PRP5BgRg

They have a good amount of seating, so it's kind of cool to pick whatever you want to eat and sit indoors.  The slice of pizza I got was a great deal and add on $1 fountain drink.  It was fresh, hot and a big slice.  Staff was friendly and polite, nice guys working ;)",dgMOxFJ_DeoReN7oSKte-w,6,4,4,cQP7KwGS_tu6OMEDStDpdA
