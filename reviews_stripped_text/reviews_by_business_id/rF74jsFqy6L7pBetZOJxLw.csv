Worst customer service ever, been here 4 times and every time they drop our cheese or meat into the trash and pick it up and put it back on our sandwich. Can't ever get ahold of the manager. She doesn't ever call back. Tried calling 4 times today and they keep hanging up. I've called corporate office on another store and they don't do anything. I used to love subway but I guess I will take our money else where. Can't get good customer service anymore. Employees are rude! And food is hella nasty!",D6_ve5vR8sTYoJqOmzNH0g,0,0,1,deCeXkvvZmHdFI03Vlu7OQ

The stentch of piss and excrement hits you at 20 feet.  Think it might be from other dissatified customers after my visit yesterday.   At 7 PM they had no bread but Italian, they said it would be ready in 20, closed my windows and went to get gas, do my taxes, and clean my car.  15 minutes later they said another 10 minutes, waited in the parking lot for 10 minutes and another car pulled in front of me.  Theymust get called when they have bread I thought...good.   Got a new phone, programmed it after 30 minutes and the car was still at the window,  it had no license plates and when I honked it tried to back into me, I did't move.  In matter of fact I called the police.  When they finally got there order and I went inside to ask them to report the car without a license plate as is required by law the person there (Kobe) said ok but later said he did not do it.   Anyway they ordered over 20 subs and instead of pulling up so I could get the 1 sub I ordered over an hour ago they would not move.   Actually glad did I not get food from this place, these inept Troglodytes are probably coming in your sandwich, they are mentally challenged and they are not winning that fight.   Horrible place, smell, area, ownership and service.     Can not say anything about the food as I never received any or even an apology.  Would not go back there for free subs for life, its disgusting.",a8HjxUbqKH-hEsTg3uFkZA,0,0,1,0yL8xmVjyL8sPxKAyGd5bg

They say they have a drive thru yet I've attempted on several occasions to utilize it, I've either had to honk, drive up to the window and wave to get someone's attention or just leave.  I stand all day at work and prefer to use the drive thru it's very frustrating. I found another one on the corner of Nellis and Lake Mead that actually has a drive thru that works.",8-piwy8F7mtBHoUY6El3zg,0,0,1,c-LgTHSP7mUeu77SS9NrmQ
