We thought no tacos for us today. I look out the window later and see Quality Towing with a big blue food truck behind it!!! Took them a bit to set up, the bumper was a little wonky but that didn't detract from the awesome tacos and friendly staff. They could have easily called it a day but instead they had the truck towed to our event!  Thank you, what an amazing dedication to customer service!",DsQXTFHNQ51IFVOWExAyfQ,2,2,5,ew7OskUWnrGneEosoKUDww

The young girl just gave me a glare as I approached the truck. I said hi with a smile as I always do when encountering people who may be assisting me. She didn't say hello, she just looked at me, turned her head and asked her mom if they were closed.",m5u_N6u7dPwJigoRtjc1Xg,1,0,1,c_ecjXMBXFHUPteOuyucuw

The park sometimes changes, I've been to it at Knickerbocker Park as well Huckleberry Park, but keep in mind they also provide catering and pop up at different spots around town. I haven't had the best luck finding where they will be at on Facebook or their website like the nice girls working told me about, but I do know it's a decent option if I do see them around town. The food is prepared fresh and they proudly advertise being organic and serving Tex-Mex. The chicken is organic, beef is grass fed, produce is organic, Spanish rice is organic, the sour cream is seasoned and salsas are made fresh. 

2 Tacos ($5) - The menu is pretty much the same, but since everything is made fresh they don't always have the exact same menu items each time. When I visited they had pulled beef instead of ground beef which they usually offer. I decided to give the pulled beef and chicken tacos a try. I didn't think the tacos looked too appealing however I was surprised by how tasty they actually were. I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas and prefer flour, but these corn tortillas complimented the tacos and tasted fresh. The pulled beef was okay while the chicken really stood out in flavor. With the 2 tacos came some chips and salsa and both are good, but the freshly made chips are addicting. I found the prices to be fair and look forward to trying some of their burritos next.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,41,44,4,8Lnjv8jnHPSQ6eoyP4AfZQ

It was a generous size with chicken and ground beef for the protein, and then it also came with guac, salsa, beans, sour cream and cheese on top.  I don't know if all the sauces drenched all of their toppings so it was tough to appreciate the other toppings.  The ordering process was quick, and the team was quick about preparing my food.  Soon after I was able to pick it up from the window.  The team was very nice and was able to answer my questions about the menu.",HmrLyqR8skk7ReB2vwJ4HQ,2,2,3,Bnm1XdlyLdw7v5noR2jetQ
3835037,2017-12-16,0,2s1JuKtL1jPzM9Tmg13CLA,This food truck provided food for my apartment complex today. The staff were very friendly and despite the power being out still carried themselves in a positive manner. The food was good! It was also nice to know that their food was made with organic ingredients.,2VcA2VqkFLlyn4QW7PjlnA,0,0,5,6UnO5itVQzdf0zomzVXRvg
4043510,2014-02-28,0,2s1JuKtL1jPzM9Tmg13CLA,My favorite food truck in Nevada! The staff is very friendly and the food doesn't get any better! Saw them at the Springs Preserve and love it when ever they are there! Definitely a must if you are thinking about trying out a Las Vegas food truck.,tKU08REPP5rgElGdC3tgYg,1,1,5,rU_0dqCUBxGmS1M-rqZRfA
