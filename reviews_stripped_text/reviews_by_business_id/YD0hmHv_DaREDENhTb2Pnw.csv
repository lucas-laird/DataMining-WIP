I was looking for a good Vegetarian sandwich being my spot I usually go to was closed permanently. I yelped and this place popped up I read some good reviews decided why not. I got the Veggie Sandwich, . Everything complimented each other I added pesto with a extra charge but it was worth it. The spot serves gourmet style sandwiches but reasonable prices. 5 stars. Check them out if your tired of the mundane sandwich shops.",BrvTjoS_uw7s2hstTT1HVw,0,0,5,Z9VrSW8-7CaAogrDPum0Jg

Ordered the veggie sandwich and it def hit the spot!! I was full after that! Delivery was super fast too! I'll def be ordering again!,i90Su5Js9Ti5dQ-uZF02iw,0,0,5,5I8KRZ00QpwtIVOVjpVY6A

3087569,2018-06-29,0,YD0hmHv_DaREDENhTb2Pnw,"I've been to La Cantine twice now in one week. Any time a new restaurant opens in this part of town I'm pretty excited and La Cantine didn't disappoint. 

For my first visit I got the Le Montagne which is prosciutto, raclette, pickles and mustard on a baguette. Sort of like a French/Swiss/Cuban sandwich? The baguette was awesome and I appreciate how easy it was to handle and eat (compared to the Americana.. which we will get to). The pickles were sliced up sweet pickles which is different and heartier than chips. The raclette cheese is a mild, soft cheese similar to Brie but usually served warm. As my sandwich sat the cheese got firmer but I actually liked it better because it gave me something more to bite into. I know I'm weird. They definitely pile on the prosciutto and I actually could have used a bit less of it. Again, I'm weird. 

For my second visit I tried the Americana because I've been wanting to try Dutch Crunch bread forever. This is a wayy bigger and messier sandwich filled with flavors. I thought it was chunky mayo falling out of the sandwich then I remembered it has cream cheese in it. Flame sauce was similar to a chipotle and it was good, but by the end of the meal I was just trying to keep my fingers clean. Dutch Crunch is so good and so unusual. It was nice to get a crunchy bite every so often in the middle of the sauce fest. I got the potato salad side which had a nice golden appearance so you know there's lots of mustard (yay). 

I'd be all down to eat at La Cantine every week but it does get a little spendy quickly, especially when you want to tip. I'm sure I'll be back to try the Buddha Bowls, gelato and macarons though. When you want to splurge on a quality sandwich, La Cantine is the place to do it!",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,yqaoczPbP8gsSCfBvYDFXw
3092592,2018-06-30,0,YD0hmHv_DaREDENhTb2Pnw,"My favorite sandwich spot in Vegas. Now this place has changed its name and taken this sandwich off menu. So now it's a secret menu. Item. Winston copper with psycho sauce! 9/10.
Le gargantu 9/10. Just a different flavor profile. But a solid great sandwich with alot of meat. This ain't your subway. You will eat half and probably be full but wont wanna stop.",9Tpj9NIj38zp9BiG_kDL6g,0,0,5,3904cm_CdMLUS_qp6ZbMEA

3338106,2018-06-22,0,YD0hmHv_DaREDENhTb2Pnw,"La Cantine formerly The Sandwich Spot became even better.
My review will closely echo Jessi R.'s but that just proves it is true.
This was our family's favorite sandwich restaurant and we were sad to see it go, HOWEVER it has proved to be improvements in every way! The food is so fresh and full of flavor, from the savory meats and the tangy sauces to the sweet desserts. 
The customer service is beyond excellent!!! They always welcome customers with a warm greating. Alissa new our order after just one visit and since my daughter and I have to eat gluten free this is very comforting. I highly recommend this restaurant,  whether you used to go to the old spot or have never been...come try it now!",Oe-yYstEbBs1-lLxtq_BVA,1,1,5,Kbl08U8b_go7gxO-OHKUiA

3447036,2018-05-18,0,YD0hmHv_DaREDENhTb2Pnw,"I was super bummed to see my favorite sandwich leaving, but once I tried the new menu, I was amazed. The high end sandwich concept with the same inexpensive cost is brilliant! Who doesn't love cleaner, fresher food, fast easy and convenient! 

The gelato! Must try the gelato, with the heat rolling in fast, I was thrilled to see there was a one stop shop for both my love of sandwiches and gelato! 

Super family friendly. The remodel seems almost complete, and through it all they have managed to still create the ""taste bud popping"" food made to perfection, and an enjoyable environment. 

Love the ownership change, and so excited to see this place grow!",bZp0T4lF30MIrk11NPw4wQ,0,0,5,ytX49bbw3NADRkLm8l6_Lw

I not only would have went 30 minutes , but probably an hour to have their amazing sandwich. Everything was soooo tasty.  We had their roast beef, pastrami and salami with some spreads that the worker said we would like. He was right. One of the best , if not the best sandwiches I ever eaten.  Amazing!!",_lSg8EYGlGHX4kVsMV0YzA,0,0,5,gDoWvRk4_zzGr-do8Hlfvg
4049217,2018-05-19,1,YD0hmHv_DaREDENhTb2Pnw,"When 2 of your friends tell you there is a new cool sandwich place who opened 3 days ago in the corner of 95 and Cheyenne, I had to go on my Saturday lunch.
I was glad to get a warm welcome as soon as I came in from the girl behind the counters. 
I ordered from the Chef selection board ""Le Veggie""  ($10)The girl told me they were out of grill eggplant and they replaced it with zucchini.  From the Other Yummi Stuff board I ordered a build your own Veggies bowl ($8). 
The Sandwich came as a panini who made me very happy. Absolutly delicious and my surprise came from the little spice on the tapenade spread. By the taste of the entire combination, you understand very fast there is a famous culinary chef behind the project. 
They bowl was good and I was happy it came with only 3 veggies who force me to not eat to much. The curry vinaigrette was exceptional and such a nice touch to add extra vinaigrette on the side.
On the desserts bord I see all this Gelato flavors, but since I am Vegan and I don't see any sorbet, maybe not for me... I decide to ask just in case... and YES they have sorbet !!!! Coconut is my winner ($3).To be honest, maybe the best sorbet I ever had and this is definitely a 5 stars winning for the place.
I just fall in love with this place and I will be back very soon. Thank you ""La Cantine"" !",8e2KqFt1W67MA3ah09IYbw,4,1,5,2W2cVFvmfZqKbvX1v2wONw

4869712,2018-06-28,0,YD0hmHv_DaREDENhTb2Pnw,"A tasty little French sandwich shop. They have a new menu, but the Americana stayed on the menu. They mentioned that they can make any sandwich that was on The Sandwich Spot menu. The service was awesome, I appreciated the suggestions and ultimately went with the Americana ($9.50). Other popular options are Cordon Bleu, French Dip, Le BBQ.  The Dutch crunch bread was superb, definitely high quality and delicious. The spicy ranch was fantastic as well. Overall a very fresh and tasty creation. The prices are reasonable considering the quality and service. Will definitely be back to try everything else!",6prcMjo5Qg6ZkD1Z3ZHDUQ,0,0,5,BG5ZHQqu6VoVV4BnZIFLDg
