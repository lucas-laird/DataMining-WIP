My boyfriend ordered the combination plate of chicken and short ribs. They were honestly okay. The chicken was a lot of breading and barely any chicken. 

I ordered the Portuguese sausage with egg and rice. It was not Portuguese sausage.. Or maybe it was a very cheap version of it. It was in the shape of spam and had just the taste changed a little. It only came with a few pieces. This was not worth $7 at all.

The thing that stands out is the interior design, local radio music station on, and just the OVERALL relaxing chill atmosphere. The fact since brand new new not taking over previous establishment. The minute walk in telling everything is new, super clean, and good vibes. 

The food feel every L&L visited been consistent with some of the best local food in Vegas. One that if went to L&L back in Hawaii never know Vegas or Hawaii. I ordered the loco moco and couple spam musubi. The local moco was amazing. Rice, Hamburger, Fried Egg, and the brown gravy (the brown gravy the key in my mind hit or miss loco moco). Everything was on point! Hamburger cooked perfect, over easy egg with egg yolk porn, and the brown gravy not dark brown gravy little lighter side but so much flavor. The portion size nice and generous local style.

The interior design the thing stands out is the vibrant colors they have on the walls. Very tropical and bright colors. They have all these coconut trees or look like palm trees artwork random spots along the walls. The tables and chairs super nice. None of these things found at other locations. The other locations for the most part all the same interior look not that unexpected since it is franchise. I just like the fact this one stands out and put it this way this is one that would enjoy eating my food there then take out.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,9,7,4,HCscnWE3o8Tox2q4YjS6ig

Chicken Katsu was soggy - exterior was not crispy as it should be and the chicken quality was poor.  Kalua pig was dry and pretty tasteless. Quality of the meat was better tho.

Yup, 4 stars!! So far L and L hasn't disappoint me. C'mon,  you can't go wrong with chicken katsu curry or by itself. Well, we just got back from Oregon and decided to stop over since it was already dinner time. My husband and I shared a chicken katsu curry and his kids got a chicken katsu and a loco moco plate. Heard no complaints about the food unless itbtasted really good cause they were hungry and for some strange reason the macaroni salad was just enough mayo and not too much.

Up till now, I felt this location made the best Spam Fried Rice of all the other locations until last Thursday.

I ordered 2 Spam Fried Rice last Thursday for myself & wife.
 When I started to eat, I thought they just gave me plain fried rice until I noticed that there were a few pieces of spam in mine. Had to move rice around to even find a piece of spam.

I thought maybe more spam ended up in my wife's order but upon checking her rice found the same with hers.

Could not have been more than 1/2 to one slice, if even that, chopped up in each container. Had to really move rice around to even find a piece of spam.

I wouldn't have been too upset if they told me they ran out of spam but would makeup for it the next time I ordered but they never said anything.

I ordered ""to go"" but still tipped them as I usually do, even if I order to go.

I'm sure the female cashier didn't know but the deceitful cook surely knew what he was doing. 

1 Start for this L&L in general.
""0"" Star for the Spam Fried Rice
-5 Star for the deceitful cook!

If I order from this location again, I will check my order before paying & leaving.

Was happy with my recent visits where the spam fried rice was really good, so raise to 4 stars.
