I tried the deep fried California rolls and they were delicious! Who knew sushi deep fried would taste amazing. I also tried the miso soup which is always a favorite of mine anywhere I go like this. It was different for me in that tofu was added and some green leaves I didn't know. But it was still good. I was glad to try something different! 

Great atmosphere and seems like the workers love what they do. The chief was quick and efficient even though he was backed up and stressed he didn't show it.

The appetizer portion were too small to share with my wife and I, who was also having the Special.  It took a long time for our orders to be filled and the place was empty.

The gravy was honestly better than the meatloaf though. My boyfriend said it was so-so compared to some he's had.   

Keeping with the firsts, I also tried spam for the first time, after diligently avoiding it for 20-some years. I ordered a Spam Musubi and I've gotta say, it was pretty simple and delicious.  

We also shared a couple sushi rolls, which didn't disappoint. They have some very creative options.  

The sashimi with cream sauce was way too sauce heavy, but the sashimi itself was good. I'd order it plain next time. 

We had a tough time figuring out who our actual waitress was, as someone different seemed to come to our table every time, but the service was very good.  I could have done without the hostess who kept coming back, and who lingered a bit too long, with her back to me, flirting a bit too much with my bf, but she was pleasant enough I guess, haha.

I worked with Brittany Ignacio for about a week and she helped to create a menu that really worked for us! Everyone raved about the freshness of the nigiri sushi and the poke! I thought the Kal-bi was so tasty and tender! I didn't care for the mochiko chicken and should have stuck with their popular garlic chicken but everyone else thought it was good!

I am a sucker for chicken katsu.  And, the sauce can make it or break it.  It is amazing here.  The katsu is a deliciously fried indulgence.  The chicken is tender and crispy.  Loved it!  On another occasion, I ordered a combo platter with a Hawaiian style beef entree (no longer seems to be on the menu) and it was also great.  But, my heart still belongs to chicken katsu.

My husband has ordered saimin and kahlua pork, both of which I've taken bites of, and both were delicious.

The seaweed salad is some of the best I've ever had.  I've actually ordered it and split a roll and have been totally full.

We stopped in at Island Sushi and Hawaiian Grill for happy hour and enjoyed some wonderful, creative food and great service (that was very attentive but not cloying).

For happy hour, drinks are two for the price of one, and they allowed us to order one set of drinks at a time (vs other places that make each person order two drinks at a time).  We started with a round of lychee martini's, which were delicious, smooth and garnished with whole lychees.

The happy hour sushi offerings were half rolls for half price.  We got four half rolls (spicy tuna roll, Island roll, tuna & mango passion roll, and a tiger roll).  We really loved the tuna & mango passion roll, which was extremely original and very tasty.

But what really set the meal apart were the ""eggplant fries"" with a house-made spicy red miso sauce.  These were perfectly done... not greasy at all, perfectly salted, creamy on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and the sauce was unique, spicy and delicious.

The gravy in the Loco Moco was weird, the MAC salad was just odd, and the saimin lacked any real flavor.  The only highlight to the meal was the Portuguese Sausage.  It was decent but how can you really mess up frying some sausage? 

Service was friendly at least! Also, be on the lookout for a 15% off your whole bill when you check-in through Yelp!",_Kgnz4G68k0L9K8F51yvtg,0,0,3,nBhs5SVqPxq9ygBwA49Bfw

It was a little confusing, because they don't appear to have table service, however, if you sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chef will take your order and act like your waiter.  If not at the sushi bar, you have to go to the register and order.  It is a take out place that looks like a sit down restaurant.  Don't let that deter you, though, the food was great.

I decided to go with the garlic chicken bento box. It was not filling for me alone, but then again I eat more than a man. The rice that was served was cold and very mushy, the whole meal itself was barely warm, the noodles were mighty tasty and the chicken itself had a good flavor but it was a bit hard, it's as if it had been over cooked.

On to the sushi rolls. I decided to go with the fried California roll and shrimp tempura. They were not bad, but they were not great either. The were over drizzled with sauce.

Lastly desert, no one could ever screw up desert right? Wrong. I decided to go with the strawberry mochi to play it safe since it was my first time coming here and I regret it. How could anyone screw up mochi? It tasted old. The texture is pretty hard to describe but the rice cake was not soft and chewy. I was so disappointed. 

Overall, the food didn't taste bad, if I was in the area I'd probably give them another chance but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. On the plus they do offer 50% off sushi rolls if you're dining in.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,2,0,3,FIWEueBsyNp5RvjpRpEr2A

Bobby was had it dead on this time as we were craving something sweet after coming from Aloha Specialties at The Cal. It's down towards the end of the street at the Plaza Hotel. Yah, the same hotel shown on Back to the Future II. 
Anyways, the restaurant was near empty on a weekday afternoon but we were eager to try the malasadas. We ordered the vanilla custard, haupia, and chocolate served warm. Malasada is a Portuguese donut covered in sugar and at times served with a filling. 
I wish i could take some home to go but would get a bit messy in my luggage. Loved the chocolate the best. I could pass on the haupia since it the consistency wasn't as creamy as I'd like.

Even though the food wasn't as good as Aloha Specialties, the variety was much better and local desert options were outstanding.  Did I mention the $34 all-u-can-eat sushi menu?!  Oh yeah!  The best deal on sushi in town bar none.

When I heard they had stopped the all u can eat option I hadn't returned.  So this evening I hear their rolls are half off for dine in only.  So we have it a go.

The joint is self service.  Order at counter, make your water, get utensils, condiments, and wait for delivery.  So we ordered, got our things and waited.  

Kids had the saimin and udon at $6 a pop.  Both are bagged and frozen with packet dashi I'm thinking.  Not at all impressive.

We had the 007, Salmon lover, and two others.  Portions were small at full price, but about right if you're paying half price.  The rice was sweet sometimes, too vinegary at other times and fell apart easily.  Flavor was forgettable and nondescript.  

While the staff is still friendly and Baba-B was providing the entertainment I can honestly say that we won't be coming back until they get their house back together.  

A while ago I thought they'd be the victim of poor marketing.  But now, if others feel the way I do, it'll take much more to get this place back in the lead.

The menu is very diverse come too getting your local grinds on. Too many comfort foods mention but cliff notes. The breakfast food portuguese sausage eggs and rice, malasada and coffee, too lunch every plate lunch can imagine, pupus plenty choose from, and dinner entrees keep local theme meatloaf do it local moco style. The sushi part of the menu is quite diverse lot of different speciality rolls too nigri style. One thing that stood on the sushi menu is the Poke express. U can have poke done in lot of different styles. Not many non local style sushi restaurants even have poke or do it any justice. So having the option too pick is pretty cool. Three of us. We order couple of speciality rolls too share and each order something. I had the chicken and eggplant. I enjoyed!!! I felt everything was done right chicken, eggplant not dried out but nice sear and moist, and came with rice and mac salad (not big fan of the mac salad). Portion size. Wow! Sure getting money worth comes too the food. Three of us ordered three speciality rolls, and shared calamari. No way finish my plate once looked at the amount. Friends ordered the pork chop (honest not fan of neither was my friend, not bad just pork chop thin cuts rather then nice thick cuts, and just ok) and other friend order chicken katsu curry.

We sat at the sushi bar ordered garlic edamame, which was steamed and tasted great. We decided to order a bunch of sashimi because I don't like to eat heavy lunches. We ordered about 18 pieces between us - super white tuna, yellowtail and tuna with spicy white sauce. All of the sashimi was VERY FRESH and prepared perfectly. The pieces were generously cut too, which I appreciate since I think the prices were a little more than what I'm used to.

If it was based just on customer service it would be a 5 star definitely. 

The AYCE menu was OK but mostly disappointing especially when it came to the sushi and desserts. It seemed like everything we usually order at AYCE sushi restaurants weren't even on the menu or had to be pay extra.  No sashimi, poke, uni, smelt eggs, shrimp tempura, or sushi rolls that stood out.  The sushi rolls were smaller and didn't standout visually and taste wise. For desserts, small mochi ice cream which looked like the one you get straight from the box sold at the market and cut into quarters.

The goods were mostly off the non-sushi section of the AYCE menu.  The green mussels, fried oysters, various chicken items, etc. 

If you do come here I don't recommend the AYCE if you want the best of what they have to offer.  I mean you still can do the AYCE and get satisfied. But me, I'll just order from the regular menu since it seemed like a better menu.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,0,0,3,5w_avP_OfG8hRVIubOLQ5Q

It was all heavenly! I am not usually a big big eater but I housed almost every piece. The Philly roll tempura was almost like a light and chewy beer batter, the eel sauce was thinner and not as sweet as I expected it to be- these little variations upped the ante on an old favorite. The Ninth Island was an interesting take on maki, omitting rice and seaweed all together. The yellowtail is always my gauge of a new-to-me sushi joint, and they passed with an A++.

2906752,2013-01-27,0,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,"This was my first visit here. Having heard about it, I had wanted to try the place out for some time now. Here's the scenario:

We arrived at the parking garage and stopped at the parking attendant booth, where we had to pay the $5.00 parking fee (refundable in full if validated in the hotel). Went inside the hotel and found Island Sushi & Hawaiian Grill. I noted their sign at the entrance of the restaurant informed potential customers that an 18% gratuity would automatically be added to the bill for a party of 6 or more. I thought that ""six"" was quite a small party for an 18% gratuity, but oh well. Luckily for us, we were a party of two.

I ordered the Hawaiian Breakfast which came with a scoop of sticky rice (this was very good), Hawaiian sweet bread (just OK), kalua pig (dry, hard, and needed salt), 2 eggs (I ordered ""easy over""), and lomi tomato (never heard of lomi tomato, so I asked our waiter about the salmon in the lomi tomato. He confirmed that it's only tomato...no salmon). Hubby ordered fried saimin (which was very tasty).

In a reasonable amount of time, our orders arrived (pictures posted) and I quickly noticed that my over-easy eggs were much too well done...overly fried. The kalua pig needed salt but it was edible. Some parts of the kalua pig were tender, but mostly the pig was hard and tough. You need to have strong jaws to finish all the pork on your plate! The lomi tomato was good, considering there was no salmon in this dish. Sticky rice very good. I tried my best to eat the rubbery eggs but I had to ask for another set of over-easy eggs. When the 2nd set of eggs came, it was barely different from the first set. The 2nd set of eggs were again equally burned on the bottom, but at least now the yolks were soft and liquidy. I guess their chef only knows how to cremate eggs instead of gently frying them under low heat. Amazing.

Oh and by the way, I didn't know it but if you Check In with Yelp while you're at the restaurant, they will give you a 15% discount. No one told me about this discount. I was pleasantly surprised when I did a Check-In on Yelp while waiting for our food to arrive.

After our meal we did go over to the Cashier and got our $5.00 parking fee refunded.

OK so I've been here, done that.

P.S. - Our bill amounted to $17.36 which included the 15% discount from Yelp. I gave them a $20.00 bill and another food server came back with my change of $17.00. Quite astonishing, when I expected to receive $2.00 and some change. I called her over to our table and explained the erroneous change I received. She went back to the cashier, this time returning with the correct change, and she thanked me.",jIH2fzQfXY7RW3C3W1Z1iQ,0,1,2,HVM4Rf_fYG5_jCiTjtcZ4w

Located inside Plaza Hotel and Casino, they made the restaurant nicer looking.  I remember 4 years ago, it was a buffet restaurant.  But after the ""making it over"" and adding new carpets, new furniture and a lot of new things.  Having the Island Sushi and Hawaiian Grill, makes Plaza a place to check out.  

Focusing on the restaurant itself.  It was located in a nice area, right in front of the casino floor and close to the check in desk.  The place seems to be the right size for this kind of restaurant.  It also had a sushi bar and a bar with slot games on them.  It was clean and the color scheme seem decent.  The staff seems very nice. Service on the other hand, seems a bit slow. I could understand if it was busy, but with 4 other couples, I see no reason to wait 5 minutes for a refill.  

I was really hungry, so I had the Teriyaki chicken plate and 2 orders of California Rolls.  I'm not the one that goes into details about sushi or how it taste compared to others.  I'm just one of those people who just like to eat sushi regardless.  Sure enough, I did like the California rolls and ate them all.  The teriyaki plate, with rice, macaroni salad was also decent.   But I'll be honest, I was expecting more of a teriyaki taste, but didn't really taste much teriyaki.  But it was cooked very well at least.  

My recommendation, if you are in the area, this is a decent place for sushi.  Teriyaki chicken is cooked very well and presentation was good.  Probably want to request Teriyaki sauce on the side or so.",VsL7I-dRjo4eToDC7Un_3Q,0,0,3,tVDK60gX4N8L3_WzFo28Aw

Chicken Katsu for everyone in the party
Chicken Salad for me (had a small stomach today)

Katsu - perfectly crispy crunchy goodiness! Doesn't get any better. Can't speak on the mac salad since I didn't sample that. But I am assured it was tasty per hubby.

Chicken Salad - sweet and crispy morsels with every bite. My only wish for this dish would be to dice up the cilantro and really throw it in there! The couple of sprigs I had were a delightful and fresh taste in the mouth, I think it would compliment the chicken more to have it more mixed in. But very tasty with everything else!

Since I lived for a year on Oahu the Hawaiian part caught my interest, but would it be good? I've been to places that claimed to be Hawaiian before and have been disappointed. Not the case with this place. Hawaiians work here. Always a good sign if you're going to eat authentic food from any region to have folks from that region working there. On my first visit I tried a Poke' bowl with avocado. It was very good. I think the Poke' I had in Hawaii was better, but this wasn't bad and certainly the best I've had outside the islands. On my second visit I had the Kalua Pig and cabbage. This is a true test as most say they make Kalua Pig and fail. The Pig here was good and tasted the most like the Hawaiian version I've had since I left Hawaii. Went back for a third visit and had the Poke' bowl again, good again. Same for the fourth visit. Another test is the POG juice, Pass-O-Guava that is, and in Hawaii they have two brands, Hawaiian Sun and Aloha Maid. The first is the good stuff and the second not so much, but cheaper, so when I asked which brand and they said Hawaiian Sun I knew they cared about quality and authenticity at this establishment. Would I go back? Heck, I went back three more times after the first visit and it wasn't just because I was staying at the Plaza. I had my car with me. I could have gone anywhere. Yet I went here. What does that tell you?

PS: They have all you can eat sushi for $29.99 at lunch and $34.99 at dinner. Plus they have the Moco Loco challenge if you dare to try. Better be hungry though as only two have made the goal on that one.",YsxfNw7adBpWKXEl0p80xA,0,0,4,D0I4JEU6BUj26X5Fsur9-A
3367957,2011-12-30,2,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,"I love the extensive menu and friendly service!  Reminds me of being in Hawaii.

After going to Aloha Specialties at the Cal for 10+ years, I was ready to give Island Sushi and Hawaiian Grill in the Plaza a try.  My relatives from Hawaii and my parents said that it is like Aloha Specialties but slightly more expensive.  Island Sushi is open later and they have happy hours from 3-5pm and again late night.  It is a sushi bar and restaurant.  They also have fresh malasadas and a poke deli!

Here is what I had:

Avocado Ahi Bowl $8.95:  I chose to order the Avocado Ahi bowl which was basically their poke with avocado chunks and sliced cucumbers on a bed of rice.  I had buffet yesterday and chose this instead of a meat dish I would normally order.  It is definitely enough to fill you up, but I prefer Aloha Specialties poke more.  The ahi here needs to be marinated more or served with more of the sauce.

Some of the other dishes we tried:

Saimin:  My dad had the saimin and thought that their noodles were very good.  Nice and al dente... not mushy at all.

Teriyaki Beef:  My mom had this and the meat was sooo tasty!  I saw about three other people around us with the same order.  One of the best teri beefs I have ever had.

Garlic Chicken:  My brother's mouth was stinging from the subtle spiciness in the chicken's crust.  It seemed like white pepper or something like that.  A delicious dish with a tiny kick.  A lot of chicken!

MALASADAS:  If you come you definitely should try their custard filled malasadas!  They are made fresh throughout the day but you don't necessarily get them hot out of the oil.  They are filled when you order them though.  We tried the Haupia and the regular custard.

This place is slightly more expensive than Aloha Specialties but it is a sit-down restaurant so you are paying for the great service too.  It is only maybe a dollar or two more per entree.  Most of our dishes were about $8-$9, still a very cheap meal!  Plus they have a bunch of rolls if you are in the sushi mood.

Island Sushi, thank you! I also have one small request--can we remove all the signs by the entrance? Walk through the front door and look around and ask yourself--do we have too much crap hung up? Yes, we do. Just take it down. Let's make it nice, okay? Nobody read signs anyway.

I  was here one other time, but came before the place was officially open for business, since they were still working out the details with the menu and they actually had forgotten about my sushi order.  Granted, there were about 8 of us and it was a soft opening, so I figured that I'd wait til I wrote a review for this place--especially since I keep hearing about the other location and their AYCE sushi option.

First of all, for the Sake Sessions event, they had a DJ spinning some tunes and two models in kimonos serving sake, as well as the somm. doling out ladles of sake (my boyfriend just had to have a photo op with the ladies AND the somm).  It seemed like It was an interesting dining experience, to say the least.  I actually saw an 80-something year old man walk up to the models and take pictures with them, all while sporting a huge grin on his face.  Ya, I'm pretty sure he can leave a happy man now.  Lol.  Anyways, back to the food and booze.

The menu specials (ranging from $1.25-$8.25) that they had for the event were pretty plentiful and I couldn't help myself from trying out a few of them:
 
Yakitori Beef - tender, delicious, and possibly the best thing on the menu
Furikake Ahi - yummy 
Shoyu Ahi - my fave of the ahi offerings, mostly since I don't really like a lot of different overpowering flavors

The food was definitely worth the wait, although we had to ask the server twice about the status of our second order.  I'm thinking it may have been because by the time we ordered, it was also getting a bit busier at around 8:30pm.  

Aside from the semi-crowded area, loud music (after all, there was a DJ there and it seemed like I came during the dinner rush), and weaving around groups of people downing sake bombs, it was a great time.  I really wish, though, that they would put a bathroom in the restaurant area, instead of having us walk outside and into the casino to use the bathroom, but maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part.

We had one real local Kauai braddah as our waiter, it started off like ""Hi how are you all doing tonight?"" and once he figured out we were from Hawaii - ""Eh! Wot you like drink sista? We got da mean poke!"" heheheh.  I think he gave us a discount but who the heck knows, they might give it to everyone but try asking for the kama'aina special price :P

 Kilauea roll -  spicy tuna, fried unagi, and spicy miso sauce.  $15

Philadelphia roll - salmon, avocado, cream cheese $8

Bonus: the wasabi was FRESH. Good job! (I've only had fresh wasabi at Osaka, and they charged extra.)

The service wasn't quite as fast as I'd like, but not uncomfortably slow. (Given that it's a Hawaiian style place, I think that a relaxed pace is to be expected.) The friendliness of our server more than made up for it.

Our first experience was very good. Five of us went for breakfast, but two of us wanted items from the lunch menu. The cooks kindly granted the requests. The teriyaki chicken was excellent! The cooked-on-the-fire flavor combined with the teriyaki sauce to make a perfect chicken dish. The garlic chicken was very good, as well. At that time, one of the waiters boasted about the oxtail soup on the menu. We said that we would be back to try it.

Unfortunately, a strand of hair was found amongst the beni shoga. When brought to the waiter's attention, he showed the proper amount of shock and dismay, and he quickly replaced the order.

Six of us went for dinner the next day, and three people ordered the all-you-can-eat sushi. What a deal! Our waitress returned to our table, frequently, to take the sushi orders. The sushi was a bit slow in being made and delivered to our table. The sushi was good. The nigiri portions were perfect: not too much rice to fill you up. 

I ordered the oxtail soup and eggplant fries with spicy sauce. The eggplant and sauce were awesome! The eggplant was perfectly cooked; the batter was tempura-crunchy and the eggplant was not mushy. When eaten with rice, it became a meal. The oxtail, unfortunately, didn't live up to the waiter's boasting. The oxtail was flavorless, dry and undercooked. I had a difficult time prying the meat off the bone. When I asked the waitress if the oxtail was always this tough, she said that she didn't know, since she had never eaten it. I was asked if I would like another order of oxtail soup, and if I could wait a few minutes for it to be cooked more. Come on! We all know that oxtail takes hours to cook until the meat falls of the bone. The oxtail soup was taken back, and it was taken off the bill. It was too bad because the soup was good. There were no peanuts, but there was won bok  and the soup wasn't salty. Later, it occurred to me that the oxtail had been microwaved. It would explain why the meat was dry and flavorless. It would also explain the comment about ""waiting a few minutes,"" while it is cooked some more.

One person ordered the teishoku. It came with miso soup, edamame, salad, and dessert. When dessert was offered to that person, another in our party realized that she hadn't been offered dessert with the teishoku the day before. We brought it to the waitress' attention, but she ignored it and continued to talk.

We scrutinized the bill, when it was delivered to the table. We were charged for a Corona, which no one had ordered, and we noticed that we were charged 18% gratuity. We talked about the fact that there were no signs posted, nor was it listed on the menus that an 18% gratuity would be added to the bill. Neither were we told, when were seated, or when the waitress presented the bill. The Corona was removed for the bill, and we decided to let the tip matter go.

Our next, and final, visit included six of us, again. Again, we noticed the 18% gratuity charge. We spoke to the manager, and she offered to show us the disclosure about charging 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. We pointed out that it wasn't posted in the front, it wasn't listed on the menu or nor was it on the bill. She stood there and acknowledged what we were saying. We paid the gratuity, but we asked that the policy be disclosed in one form or another.

Overall, the staff was pleasant, the portions were generous, and most of the food was very good. Hopefully, the missteps can be worked out, as the food is good enough to keep people going back.",VGHwpEAuhfvH3_-21m2vUA,0,0,2,UuwaX8WAlkEy1YOG74dupA

I have been coming here since the restaurant opened and used to love it. I always would get the same thing, the ahi tuna and avocado bowl. It was the best dish ever, comprised of five simple ingredients but executed perfectly. Its brilliance lay in its simplicity!  Well first of all, they have eliminated all of the asters, now you have to order with the cashier. Second, all of the utensils and dishes are now made of plastic. Third, the food portions are a bit smaller and I found the quality of the fish was just ok. 

All of this I could deal with if the prices were lowered, I understand that the space is huge and they probably weren't making a profit, but to scrimp on all of their costs and then not modify the food prices...

My husband and his friends always hit this place up when they're in town, and I was excited to be able to try it myself.  One of husband's best friends is a Hawaiian native, and he loves it here - the Hawaiian seal of approval told me this place would be a winner.  They've got a great selection of inventive sushi rolls, and their ahi poke bowl is yuuuuuuuum. Their prices are pretty fair, given the portion size and the fact that it's in a Vegas hotel.  The service was a little spotty, but overall pretty good.  They actually play island music, which makes me forget where I really am.  

Both my specialty rolls were fresh tasting and full of flavor.  I kept stealing bites of my husband's ahi poke.  I'd love to be able to try their happy hour, or maybe wear sweat pants and belly up to the All You Can Eat stuff the next time I'm in town.

4856705,2012-09-14,4,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,"Island Sushi and Hawaiian Grill in the Plaza had become a surefire bet for me over the last few months, especially when I found myself downtown, hungry because I waited too long to get something to eat, and turning into a veritable raging monster, wandering around moody and lightheaded, and just as aimless and indecisive as to what my next meal should be.

I would pop in here for lunch, sit at the sushi bar, and could pick from almost any of their specialty rolls to achieve serenity and balance. And even more so if those picks included the Candy Cane (spicy soft shell crab with tuna hamachi) or the Lava Lover (spicy tuna, Cajun tuna and chili paste, served with a spicy garlic ponzu sauce).

And if I happened to amble in a bit later, I could satisfy the raging hunger monster inside me with some Spam Musubi: a grilled portion of spam wrapped in sushi rice and nori, and seasoned with Furikake (a Japanese condiment made with dried and ground fish and sesame); I never imagined I would ever love love love something made with Spam, but Island Sushi had made me a convert.

And then tragedy struck.

Sometime between my last two visits, the restaurant had decided to give diners the options of eating a la carte, or paying a fixed price for lunch and $dinner, and ordering off their all-you-can-eat menu.

On the upside, the menu lets you sample not only their many sushi rolls, but smaller side dishes like their garlic chicken, chicken katsu, and garlic soy edamame that are served tapas style. I was pleased to discover these items on this new menu and really appreciated the crispiness of the katsu chicken. It was the best thing I had that day.

On the downside the sushi that came off of this menu was unappetizing and the chicken katsu was the best thing I had that day.

While the Island Special (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, eel sauce and a spicy aioli) was just fine, and the Crunch Roll was okay but not as good as I remembered it, the seafood ""filling"" in Pauhana roll we sampled had the mouth feel of glutinous mashed potatoes and was quickly ejected into our napkins as it could not be swallowed. There was also a spam-based roll we sampled (that I was originally looking forward to given my newfound respect for that mysterious spiced ham) but this disgusting, inedible curio barely made it past our lips; I wish I could remember this specific roll's name, but I have skillfully managed to block it from my memory and only years of unmitigated regression therapy can now set it free.

What happened? Did I just visit on an off day or did the all-you-can eat menu change the way these previously delicious dishes were prepared? Is quality being compromised so the restaurant can afford to offer an all you can-eat menu? 

Or am I only imagining that the quality has gone down in some way and I am blind to a potential bargain that's being offered? Has the new all-you-can-eat menu jaded me in some way? I would have gladly paid $35 to $40 per person for an a la carte lunch here in the past, but the value for the money this time, even with an all-you-can-eat structure, was just not there. 

All questions and doubt aside, our experience with the sushi on the all-you-can eat menu was a disappointing one. So much so that I do not think I'll be returning. Instead of turning me on to something novel and amazing with their new menu, and taking a convert on new journey of sushi enlightenment, they have ruined the memory of some of my old favorites, so I'm getting off this island.

The new menu also added to my displeasure. It's filled with rules and restrictions, such as when certain items can be ordered, and if you don't eat all the sushi you order or eat every grain of rice that comes with it, there will be hell to pay and you that you will be fined a surcharge. While I get the need for this, as some people do go overboard and order too much, and this puts a toll on the sushi chefs, it also cheapens the dining experience a bit and makes things feel somewhat contemptible right from the get go. When I'm hungry and moody I do not want to sit through a stern, five-minute lecture of rules that feels like the opening scene from Gremlins.

Meanwhile, every other table was promoting an avaricious eating contest that also seemed to be a new, disconcerting addition since my last visit here. The Loco Moco Challenge! Stuff a three-pound beef patty, six scoops of rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, 12 ounces of gravy and a malassada in your gullet in 45 minutes and it's free! Or pay $39.95 and wear some shame along with a free neon pink t-shirt that tells everyone you're ""a loser"" for failing to do so. Do they have to eat every grain of rice, too? Classy.

I now have no favorite place to go to when I am downtown and hungry, and I am clearly not a fan of the many changes that have occurred here since my last visit, which make me angry. And you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry and angry.",DB8eZawJlQxbWc2I7aJ_vQ,2,0,2,fgUSGv0TsdG2cGW2Iu9nrw

Not to mention a lot of the wait staff is from Hawaii so in addition to having local food you also get local people and attitudes. When we went to Aloha Specialties Restaurant they weren't extremely friendly. Like I know they're always busy but really. So we had a local boy who was extremely friendly and went out of his way to make us feel at home.

When I got in I got so excited because of all the local food. They had malasadas, cocoa puffs, chicken katsu, garlic chicken, everything I eat at home and I didn't even know what to choose from. 

I had a garlic chicken bowl and sushi. Oh my god, garlic chicken, how I missed thee. It's not mitsuba or Mistuken but it's still good. It wasn't dripping with sauce which is both good and bad. I ordered the bowl because I had the thought, oh well the bowl will be smaller. No not really. In addition I had maguro and ebi nigiri (which was delicious) and a California roll (delicious, but a little bit of a vinegar taste in the crab meat). So with everything I ordered I was actually very excited for my dessert which was the malasada sundae. It was so yummy, the warm malasada pieces which could have be crispier but it was delicious with the vanilla ice cream. There was also a strawberry sauce that I don't really think added to the dish but it didn't take away from it either. I think I'm just a chocolate person.

We visited on a Saturday night, and they had live entertainment - a Hawaiian singer (Babalicious) who was actually quite good and helped create a festive environment, but the food was average.

If you are a Vegas local, rolls are 50% off! Score! Most of the rolls average $14-5 at full price, so the 50% off makes them what you would expect to pay for spicy tuna variations. They do offer AYCE dinner for $34.99 (lunch $29.99), but depending on your hunger, the 50% deal might be the better route. And, note, for our party of 6, they included an automatic 18% gratuity on the full price of the rolls. 

In addition to the rolls, we snacked on some eggplant fries, and I thought those were tasty! However, the rolls I thought were average and relied heavily on sauces. 

I would say service was average because we had some empty water glasses. Also, the furnishings are pretty basic; it felt a bit cafeteria-esque. I wouldn't suggest first dating here.

Only downside is parking is sketchy and in bad area and casino is smokey but it's worth it!!!  Gonna try the oxtail next time!

They have an extensive menu for both sushi lovers & sushi rookies. Locals, did you know you get half off sushi rolls?! Sweet! We got a bottle of wine for our table for under $8. Talk about cheap. I highly reccomend the Salmon Lovers roll, the Island Special, & the Makaha Roll. This was a great experience. Great service. Great soul food. Fun Hawaiian music.",hBRBoalwEnKB30Frky4xXg,1,1,5,NhlJx0LoKw86b2nMmkYitw
5474114,2013-01-26,0,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,The food was excellent.... There were 5 of us that ate there. We all got a combo A. Each tried something different and it was very good. I thought it was priced well. Plus we had a coupon which made it even better so we ate for 61.00. Can't wait to go try breakfast. Only thing that I didn't think was great is that I asked our waitress twice for lemon to go in my water and she said oh yes sure. NEVER brought it so I gave up asking. It wasn't busy at the time so that kind of bugged me. Other than that I would go back again.,ka_Oc0U2LgsPO3E4UTFnxQ,0,0,4,VtP1MB6_dfp2aW20EAUUlQ

5570981,2014-09-03,0,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,"Are you kidding me?  Please don't waste your time with this junk establishment.  Just ate here Saturday night, before Superbowl Sunday.  The place was dead, there were more waitresses than customers.  The cheesy ""Asian makeover wanna be Hawaii"" decor should was my first clue and we should've listened but I was intrigued by the menu and selections, so we went for it.  

First off, the side tables for two are barely big enough for a normal size human let alone two, but that's where they sat us in a 90% empty place.  Second, we got a very stern lecture from the 20-something waitress about ""the rules"" and how to eat before you could order more. No sharing.  We thought she was joking, as the menu had an all you can eat sushi and side selection, with a lot of traditional ""Hawaiin style"" choices.  We found out she wasn't.

I'm half Hawaiin and I've been going to Aloha Specialties in the Cal for years, so I tried a thorough selection off the all you can eat menu.  Poke (you are only allowed one order the size of a sunimono bowl), shrimp tempura (2 pieces), The hamachi collar, green baked mussels (only 2), the chinese chicken salad (in a soup size cup), salmon skin cut roll (the worst dish by far), the albacore and maguro sushi, a steak dish from the all you can eat whose name I can't remember, and potstickers.

Poke: small serving, only allowed one, poke marinade weak and not all the fish had been fully flavored.  It was side by side with helping of seaweed salad that didn't help the flavor.  By Hawaiin poke standards, way below average.

Shrimp tempura: small pieces. Each piece counts as one order.  Eh.

Hamachi tuna collar: best flavor, served hot, lots of meat on a piece of fish you usually throw away.  Best dish so far.

Albacore and Maguro sushi: All fish pieces were extremely small, the sushi rice was way over treated in vinegar and overly sweet.  The Albacore fared better than the maguro as it was fresher I think.  The maguro had a bad color and odor, very fishy and oceany, which usually means it's been left out too long or is old.  I didn't eat the second piece for fear of getting sick.  Yeck.

The chinese chicken salad was in a soup cup because it was soup.  The cup was filled half way with dressing, drowning the greens out completely.

Baked mussels: only two, the sauce was mildly flavorful, but average dish and I think you could only order this once.  BTW - there are symbols next to everything you can only order once? WTF on an all you can eat menu?

Pot stickers were fried to a rock hardness and only 3 small pieces the size of garden snails.  Tasted like they came out of the freezer into the fryer.

Salmon Skin roll: again very small pieces barely the size of a quarter.  This was the worst dish, first piece tasted like cardboard and the rice had the same vinegary taste.  I couldn't do it.  Left that one alone. 

GF had the garlic chicken dinner.  Pieces were large, cut white meat sauteed or fried in their garlic mix.  Not very traditional and the flavoring was average, no real zing or bite to it, which is a let down for garlic chicken.  And yes, we were watched by the hostesses throughout dinner to make sure I wasn't sharing anything with my GF, A manager type even hovered over us while on his cell phone which made for the most uncomfortable moment while there.  The back breaker is when we were done, I got lectured by the 20-something hostess for leaving the 1 piece of nasty maguro and the cardboard salmon skin.  She told us they would normally charge us but ""we'll just say you didn't like it"" which is what I told her, because it was true.  She told us not to do it next time.  Next time?  Never again.  I don't know how this place rated more than 2 stars from anyone.  

Oh yeah, all you can eat charge wasn't on the menu, but when we got the bill we were sticker shocked by the $35 price for the inferior food.  Their online menu currently says $26.95.  It's Vegas, go anywhere else but here.",ICiAoH19l0kCoOiUyUEBRw,0,0,1,1zsADquZYppd4AqYQqiBpw

The service here is awesome.  Staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Place is nice and clean.  Island Sushi is a restaurant and Sushi Bar.  

We had a bunch of different sushi rolls (sorry i forgot the names) which were all good... We also tried the saimin, spicy ahi bowl, kalua pig and cabbage, and garlic chicken.  Everything was great.  Oh and how could I forget the spam musubi!  We also got musubi's for our road trip to CA. :)

Definitely makes you feel like you are back home...

I wouldn't order the Mac salad or pulehu steak though. The service was 5 stars and we got an awesome discount. The best deal in the state is their all you can eat dinner for $35.

 P.S. The only advice I'd give to the owner is to speak to the hotel about the strong deorderizer smell upon entering the casino. It's unappetizing and makes me nautious. That's what stops me from going to eat there as often. It's driving business away, and  I'm forced to do take out and eat it in my hotel room.",woAQrIYXALiotKay013WlA,2,2,5,ecA52ta0uwiq4t3D5ow-Dg

5928884,2014-03-26,0,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,"Wow, what happened to this place? I guess I really haven't been here for a long time, until a few weeks ago. We were in the area and craving Hawaiian food. Figured Aloha Specialties at The Cal would be too crowded on a Saturday afternoon, so we decided to come here. How things have changed!

We walked in and were not greeted by the staff like before. Instead, there was a sign that said ""Counter service only. Please place your order with the cashier."" We asked the cashier, ""What happened to all the waiters?"" She said that they ""changed the concept"" of this Island Sushi a little over a year ago, hence the addition of the word Express. They have counter service only, but full service at the sushi bar. No waiters, no bartenders, which was kind of sad. We ordered our favorite - fried noodles, got a number, sat down at a table and our food was brought out to us 10 minutes later. Utensils, napkins, condiments and water were all self-serve. Although the food was still delicious, I believe the portions were a bit smaller. 

Again, pretty sad. I miss the old atmosphere and how it used to remind me of home. If I was ever in the area, I suppose I would stop by for take out. But I wouldn't make a great effort to come here.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,3,2,3,91lpkGPfxBE-1e-SirV6KQ

5986582,2012-01-14,0,K_URSTcq_chiWPcMpuo3Qw,"we hit this place a few times a month for lunch. Service is quick, staff very friendly, and there's a display counter for fresh fish a la Poke Express in NLV.  You can order it out which is pretty cool, or have it served with your lunch.

I typically order Won Ton Min, which is pretty good, with a side of tako poke or kim chee cucumbers.  Spam musubi had just a little too much rice; i like a closer Spam to rice ratio, and it comes served wrapped in plastic. I am guessing that it's not fresh pressed, but previously made, but it still tastes good.  

My friends typically get Bento boxes, and hold the furikake.  They seem to like their mochiko chicken and other stuff.  

The one bad thing about going here, and it's not really the restaurant's fault, but there's a weird chemical smell throughout the casino.  Almost like every ventilation return has some fabric softeners stuffed in there or something.

weird funky smell: 2.5",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,3,0,4,h2Juog6n8CzP0Bz2ioIXww
