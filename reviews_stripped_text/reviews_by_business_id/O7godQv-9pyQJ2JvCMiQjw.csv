Good customer service. I've Been in the neighborhood  and seen a lot of different types of restaurants go in and out of this shop, seems to be kinda cursed for new businesses but really hoping they do well cuz their food is good and the prices are great.  My husband loves the sushi and hes a pretty hardcore sushi critic since he's Hawaiian lol. I don't eat fish or meat so wish their was more veggie options but they have a nice selection and are pretty flexible with customizing orders to accommodate ..but im missing their veggie gyozas!!! They were amazing hoping they bring it back to the menu :)",MGAVmCz_lpE-zX3frnMFEA,0,0,4,IoS1AYmYKb6_sitAreJyfQ

My wife and I walked in on a weeknight hoping not to spend a lot of money.  And boy were we surprised when we tasted the quality of the food!  We both ordered the bento boxes.  The teriyaki sauce was pretty good- Not very oily, which I've had at other budget japanese restaurants.  Salmon didnt taste frozen.  Chicken was pretty moist.  You can substitute any roll for the california roll for $1 or 2 extra.  The amount of sushi to rice ratio is pretty decent for the price.  A couple pieces of dim sum with optional fried rice comes with it as well. 
We definitely enjoyed this neighborhood place and will be eating here frequently",kb69MiK0snFxzIlxbaONSw,3,0,5,KrwwE6CthCAYoeGGQCJzOQ
738187,2017-01-14,0,O7godQv-9pyQJ2JvCMiQjw,Great delivery service. So fresh and hits the spot every time. My husband and I tend to order a little late in the evening after the kids go to bed and we decided sushi and a movie is on the books. The sashimi chef special is to die for. The rolls are small and well priced and a quick 30 bucks for an amazing late dinner.  We haven't gotten a bad dish yet from them.  worth every penny,HEm6kIVG5QgxVVOH7Lit6g,0,0,5,z4BxgKIvu5F7GPHrGCJI3A

1049983,2016-06-06,4,O7godQv-9pyQJ2JvCMiQjw,"The restaurant just opened in a shopping center that has been quiet dead the last few years. I hope this business will bring more customers to the shopping center so these small businesses can survive.

The restaurant is fairly clean and decorated. Many owners have taken over this building, but Tokyo Peking is the first to really deck out the place. The staff is friendly and very attentative to their customers.

This place offers a wide variety of lunch specials at a cheap price. However, to my taste buds, nothing here was really delicious. I order the Eel Lunch Special, Sushi and Sashimi Lunch Special, and Crab Ragoons. The Crab Ragoon was pretty decent, but it's not that hard to make so nothing too impressive. The Lunch Specials came with miso soup or salad and a roll. The rolls were really dry and stale. The miso soup and salad were very bland. 

This place is still new so I'm hopefully that they will adapt to their customers' liking and potentially help this shopping center grow for these small businesses.

P.S. I'm just happy cause this place has Shirley Temples and it's right around the corner of my house",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,5,2,3,oSM_OQWZ7w0NpnX9MN5iIA

1459613,2016-06-02,6,O7godQv-9pyQJ2JvCMiQjw,"Tokyo Peking is a new Japanese restaurant that has opened up in the southeastern region of Las Vegas. It takes the place of a pizza place, and before that, a mom and pop buffet. So far, it was good.

This place is located in an obscure strip mall off of Pyle ave. It's located in a quiet area. After walking inside, I can tell that they put a lot of work into this spot. The sushi bar is front and center, with some smaller tables around it. Around the back of the restaurant, there are a few hibachi tables. It's very hip and modern.

While going through the menu, I can tell that this place is going for the Osaka Japanese Bistro style. You can order combinations of sushi, and everything is by piece, no AYCE. The hibachi tables in the back provides the teppanyaki for those that like that stuff. 

I ordered something to go because it was getting late. I got the Japanese Combination fried rice. I thought it was cooked well, and the meat and seafood was fresh. It was good.

I might come back here to check out some more stuff. They have some interesting lunch specials. Pyle road isn't too busy so they might need some social media presence to help them. Wish them the best.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,16,14,4,eeMQQZOTLMYUSDZTrjjJgg
1564426,2016-08-27,0,O7godQv-9pyQJ2JvCMiQjw,"Been wanting to try this new  place out for a while. Unfortunately,  my expectations were too high.

We ordered takoyaki and Tokyo rolls as our appetizers. The takoyaki were obviously prepackaged; more batter and little octopus. The Tokyo rolls were nothing more than egg rolls which consisted more wrapper than filling. 

Lighting in the restaurant was poor, the colored lights over the table made it difficult to see your food. 

I ordered the bento box with steak. I had my steak medium rare. At least I think it was medium rare. (Refer to said lighting issues.)  The wife ordered hibachi chicken and ""soba"" noodles.  The chicken was more like General Tso than hibachi. We were expecting buckwheat soba noodles: what we got was yaki-soba aka ramen noodles.  We pointed out to the waiter that real soba is made of buckwheat. He insisted that yaki-soba is the same.

As a side note, I had major stomach issues after eating here.  

Long story short, it is not a very good restaurant, go eat somewhere else.",IQ-Mt-LI6SsVzgqSl4IwNQ,3,0,1,ZU3BLjXjxazHoXO3BE41Sg

Ordered the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box to go with fried rice ($1 upgrade) the rice was fair but the salmon, crunchy shrimp tempura and dumplings, delicious!!! Lots of food, packaged well to go home with me. The staff is nice and asked if I'd like a drink while waiting. The restaurant looks nice with a great use of space, sushi bar on one side and hibachi on the other. I'll definitely be going back!",mE9X7mcvkDNopCl5jgraxA,0,0,4,suKyA0NRZwok_0gGXI9hwA

Food is 10/10, 11/10 with rice. Service and staff are 20/10 certified. They're friendly, and on their feet all the time. I've ordered multiple things on the menu and they've all been good, and to-go service is fast too. It would be a shame if they go out of business like so many other businesses in this plaza. They're surrounded by plenty of homes, so it shouldn't be too hard for people to just walk in from around the corner. #supportsmallbusiness",lXobY8rb70j9KN7CgkFJKQ,2,3,5,oEMclJWeFwkIJ0jUXDwusA

We were greeted warmly by a server and seated right when we walked in. There was a 4-top already sitting inside. We ordered ice water, were given menus and our orders were taken soon after. My Mom had the grilled salmon hibachi lunch special and I had the chicken teriyaki bento box. The chicken was delicious, the miso soup flavorful and the yellow dressing on the salad was tasty. The california roll that came with the bento box was really good - Im looking forward to trying other sushi rolls. My Mom said her entree was delicious as well. Several people came in to pick up to go items while we were there. The staff was very attentive and the music was just the right volume.

4439849,2016-06-02,3,O7godQv-9pyQJ2JvCMiQjw,"My friends and I, a pretty medium sized group went on opening day because of a 15% off promotion. It wasn't packed as it was early morning and some of the people arrived about 30 minutes late.
The lighting is  0 out of 5.
The lights are off except some hanging UV lights that are hanging in the middle of the table. The windows are closed with blinds that let no light in and it's hard to enjoy your food when you can't see anything but purple. My friend had to shine her phone flashlight on the food to figure out what she was eating even though it was 11 am.

The service is 2 out of 5.
The service is new which is understandable as I came on grand opening so I let a few things slide. The service was welcoming and nice however they are a bit clumsy. For the people that came late (they actually both came a few minutes after we ordered) their food came in 30 minutes after they ordered which by that time the ones that ordered first were already finished so it was kind of disappointing.

The drinks are a 0 out of 5. 
I ordered water and it had an underlying taste of soap and when I ordered coke to wash the taste out it was even worse. Maybe it was just me because my friends didn't taste anything weird when they drank my soda but another person from another table also tasted it and made a big deal out of it. I didn't as I had already ordered water and knew that it wasn't going to help. Maybe it's because the cups are new but I wouldn't drink anything from this place again.

The appetizers, I give a 3 out of 5. 
I ordered some takoyaki, which wasn't that bad, it had a soft center and really crispy outside, but but sauce wasn't squeezed on top like it normally is with mayo. There was in fact no mayo at all but some weird carrot garnish that looked like it didn't belong on the plate.
The crab rangoons I would give a 10 out of 10. It's a triangle shape with the regular sweet dipping sauce and come out piping hot, I would totally come back for this.

Food is a 2 out of 5
I ordered the negimaki bento and it came with soup (tasted like distilled soy sauce), a salad (with too much dressing and tasted like regular store brought salad), some vegetables wrapped in meat to make it like a type of sushi almost on a bed of sauce and onions (which wasn't bad), some siumai (store brought frozen and in some sort of liquid?), some California rolls (huge chucks of avocado), 2 shrimp tempura (which was really good for some reason, crunchy and came with a sweet dipping sauce) and some rice. There's a fried rice option but it cost extra.
I tired my friend's crunchy roll and that along with the out of control roll are really good. My advice is to stick to the rolls.

Overall I would come back for some rangoons and even some rolls but I wouldn't try the bentos again.",GdqPyjhdy4cr03ZJ76m-pA,0,0,2,kyAc_c0Q-KNJNnordhDM8w
4826464,2016-09-08,0,O7godQv-9pyQJ2JvCMiQjw,"I probably will not return to this restaurant. My family went out for hibachi and what a disappointment. Our reservation was at 4pm, and while some of us were earlier no one even offered water until I got up and asked for some. While I am usually not impressed with hibachi this was more for my parents, and the hibachi chef being dead silent through all of the cooking provided no entertainment. My wife and I ordered our filet rare, and yet there was no pink in the middle, not even close to what we asked for. While the prices are cheap so is the food, the service, and the decor.
