The service is excellent and the restaurant could not be cleaner or more pristine- the entire kitchen is on display (major bonus!).  Favs include their vegetable egg rolls (love that sweet, clear chili sauce), tom yum soup, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, pad thai, and the currys.  Their hot sauce is great, so are the lunch specials.  The food does not compare to L.O.S. or Komol in terms of the flavor or complexity, but everything I've had has always been fresh and delicious.  I definitely recommend this spot- it is way above average for a local Thai place and is not filthy, dingy, poor quality, or lacking flavor- like so many other local places...!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,7,1,4,a0SUOGOGA38TVe-xiTUDWw

She looked at us as if we were stupid for asking for lettuce, so I didn't want to spend another minute in that horrible place I asked to cancel the rest of the order and give us the check and they refused and said they already made it! We took it to go the papaya salad was horrible it tasted like fish! The curry was way too sweet! The spring rolls were a waste of time! People save your money or just go to subway right next door!

The food is usually a hit or miss. Most of the dishes are over priced for it's quality.  I've ordered out many times and the noodle dishes, pad Thai and pad see ew are either cooked well or soggy. They do add a fair amount of meat which is nice. 

The soups are usually pretty good, but they add these strange hard dried out pork bits that makes the dish less appetizing. 

I didn't realize this until recently, but I've been getting overcharged for the pad see ew/ pad Thai dishes in adding chicken when it already is supposed to come with chicken, pork, beef and shrimp. 

The thing that really got me this time around is they charged $2.00 for cilantro without letting me know that there was an extra charge for it. I can understand if i added a meat to the dish for $2., but $2. for cilantro??? That's more than it would cost them for 2 bunches of cilantro at the grocery store. Very disappointed with their dishonesty and lack of customer service. 

Unfortunate to say, this is definitely the last time I go to this place.

774583,2013-12-06,0,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"I have been to this restaurant a 4-5 times over the last few months because I just moved near this area.  

Service:  
It is average.  The servers are friendly and are helpful.

Food:
I have tried following items at the restaurant:
-Thai Omelet
-Homestyle Duck (Level 5)
-Spicy Basil Ground Chicken (Level 3)
-Spicy Basil Eggplant and Pork (Level 1)
-Kabocha Squash Curry with Tofu (Level 5)

The first time I tried this place, I had their thai omelet.  They forgot to put tomato in the omelet-- the only reason why I ordered the dish.  For the tomatoes.  However, I got fresh cherry tomatoes on the side so I was happy.

Overall, the food is too sweet.  I cannot handle hot food very well so I first started with Spicy Basil  Eggplant with Pork spicy level 1.  It was just plain sweet so the next time I ordered spicy basil chicken with level 3.  It tasted the same.  Sweet. After that, I craved for some good duck dish so I got their homestyle duck level 5.  The duck was good and had some kick to it.  However, it was still too sweet.  

Last night I got kabocha curry with tofu level 5.  I did not want to raise my spice level because I was afraid that I might not be able to eat it.  I now regret getting it with level 5 because it was just as mild as level 3 and was sweet.

I am probably going to return to the restaurant because its close. But I won't recommend it to anyone who really want authentic thai food.  Their food is too sweet.",ByU-4bg5ENiLgtEmkilicA,4,1,2,4Q0dxzCyqwNiBFXr2Rb9ew

Felt that the dishes were about $1 overpriced, but it's worth paying a little extra for good food. Unfortunately I was quoted about a 90 min delivery time. Would've been much quicker to just go pick it up, but that's the price to pay for laziness.

Had red curry with chicken- good, but nothing spectacular
Mongolian beef- again good, but small portion
Mango with sticky rice- impossible to screw up

Order with tip included came out to almost $40. Perhaps it would've been a better idea to sit down at the restaurant instead of ordering delivery for a first time experience, but overall I wasn't blown away. However if I'm feeling like Thai and absolutely too lazy to drive for it, I might consider Benjarong again.

810390,2015-04-01,1,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"OK I was in the area and I was in need of some good spicy food. I was so glad to read about this high rating Thai place as ""authentic"" by a Thai, and it is just within walking distance!
OH my, the reviews blew my mind away, I was feeling it must be my lucky day to find out another authentic Thai place!!

First impression was good, gentle service girls, answered my questions in soft voices, and their eyes are attentively looking around for customer's sign of needing service, through the big mirror across the side wall.
When I ordered food, I emphasized that I didn't like anything sweet, so they recommended panaang curry, which is something I usually order, it is the most spicy curry in most Thai places in this city.
Well well, the curry was overly too sweet!! I can not believe it.  
 They offered to bring it back to the kitchen and re-make it, but I would not try that (haha, basic common sense to eat at a restaurant that you don't own).  Anyone who has worked in a kitchen would say,""Save it and box it to go!!LOL!!""  So that was what I did.  I brought it back home, add my own spices to dilute the sweetness, and finished the meal.  
I can not think of any reason to go back again, unless I will be in that area and starving.  After all, Thai is my favorite, and I will stick with spicy basil and beef salad, the things that they have more control than pre-made sauces.

I really want to say, that level of sweetness in Panaang curry has no chance to be authentic Thai, I have had so many Thai food in Asia, by top chefs who own successful restaurants in Bangkok.  Maybe chefs/cooks in Vegas are from other areas of Thailand?? I traveled most part of Thailand from south to north, and have never had anything half as sweet in a curry or any entry dishes. 

My favorite place is Komol on Sahara and Commercial, a family owned and operated Thai restaurant.  They are, compare with other places in the valley, the closest to real Thai, and they use the least sugar amount.  When I ask them to cook my meal in Asian way, the way they will eat it, I would not taste sugar in my meal.  

But they say, they have to add sugar otherwise customers will complain.",K9N5jNFuJHLv3MvhRHKR6A,2,0,2,uXMInDeE0AXErsgccWIIXg

The pad thai had one piece of broccoli, maybe 2 tiny pieces of carrot, and like 4 half slices of zucchini and a random piece of stewed tomato. In addition to there being virtually no vegetables in my vegetable pad thai, there was also chicken(?) that was so dried and rock hard that it took me a full minute to even identify what it was. There was no traditional pad thai flavor present. The side of cucumber salad they gave me was put in a cup about the size of a container that you would put ketchup in for your fries at a restaurant. The cucumbers were old and sour smelling. I took about 4 bites of my meal and couldn't even stomach any more because the smell made me so nauseous. If you're looking for yummy thai food, you'd be better off going through the dumpster of literally any other thai restaurant than ordering a ""fresh"" meal here.

I had always gone to Pin Kao but since we moved we thought we try it out. My first couple experiences were good. I told ot friends and family about it. We even had it delivered to our house and ordered their carry out food. I was completely disgusted to find a medium length black hair in the bottom of our Red Curry Chicken- i fed this to my whole family! It wasnt till the second serving that my husband wanted- i found the gross hair. I called to let them know and the reaction i got was that the person on the phone didnt understand and said maybe it was mine! At the time I was a red head and my husband has short hair so nope it wasnt ours....They offered a credit for the red curry. 
A few months go by and we thought, lets give it another try. This time ill pick it up at the restaurant. The food looked good but i realized when we got home, that the white rice that comes with the entree wasnt there and there was only brown rice that i ordered for a woping $2.50 a container. I opened the rice and it smelled like a most sour foul smell ...not normal for brown rice. I took a small bite and spit it out. The rice in a bag was definitely burnt and rancid. I now had no rice to serve to my family with our entree. I went on the the chicken satay appetizer. As i opened the box of food and foil i grabbed 2 skewers and not again...i found  ANOTHER BLACK HAIR!!! I was utterly disgusted my husband was fuming mad. Also that same trip to Benjarong i made sure to tip the server an xtra 10 for a tip.
Well over $20 percent for take out. I really regretted buying this food from them again.The kicker was when i called the lady who handed me my food she said ""you must have lost the white rice...i gave it to you, the brown rice is supposed to smell sour and the hair in the food...she denied it again. Im sorry but  im not going to waste $40-60 bucks on food thats rancid, has human hair cooked in it and service that is less than normal and health code appropriate. 
I will NEVER order from Benjarong ever again!!
I dont know whats the matter with who ever runs the place, why the cant keep their hair out of the food they serve others and why the heck they cant admit they mess up people food and dont exhibit clean methods of preparing food but until someone takes responsibility...i think they should be cited and given a fine to clean up their act!",R3vrfdlWRKq2ZE3C7dCoZQ,0,0,2,XyGXv5awnxszInJDIcfNww

On 3/24 I ordered a to go soup and rice. When I got home, I realized the soup was just water with some chili on it. Not cooked together at all and missing its normal ingredients.  I called and first employee kept putting me on hold - then spoke with another waitress (named Penny). She what she could do for me, I asked for a refund - she said only the owner could do that, she was just a waitress. I asked to contact the owner or a manager - she said there was no one, they were out of town. I replied asking again for a manager and politely asked her if she knew Southern Nevada Health District requires a manager or PERSON IN CHARGE to always be on property - to which she said ""I know, but he is out of town"". Then she hung up the phone and didn't answer my return calls.

Being upset by how I was treated, I looked up their inspections on the Southern Nevada Health District website and see they have several B ratings with 20 demerits/violations. Watching how the employee was cleaning the floor and touching the mop with her hands - AND no person in charge as required by law - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ANYMORE.",US5TnFHzeZLWHgwzArQJrw,3,1,1,dsDk0AXiDmqF5qYXLsAVPA

I was kind of expecting a ""to-go"" kind of restaurant, but this is more of a sit-down place, but you can order to go- so I did.  

Location - good! Near my house. Located in southwest, near Rhodes ranch. 

Service - ok. No one greeted me when I first came in but at least I got a thank you when I left.

Food- since I was only ordering for myself, I only got one dish - their Pad Thai  w/ shrimp. I ordered 2 on the spiciness level (I like spicy, but I heard Thai spiciness can be insane!) Overall, it was good & tasty. 

I would come back to this place, but maybe for lunch next time since price is more reasonable and you can get a combo order.",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,0,0,3,sdbfqlGXmyXk-2KT5dQSGw

A friend likes this place a lot and even though I don't really like the food personally, it's a passable option when you're being dragged to eat out without a say because you weren't driving...but I digress. 

So on this recent visit I decided to stay away from their lunch special and go rogue. While my dining companion was instagraaaaaming her food with glee, I made a snap decision on some Spicy Thai beef noodle soup. The waitress asked how spicy I wanted it. I was a little surprised by the question, I had to think about it but honestly it's probably because I'm just used to Pho joints where you customize your noodles at the table. 
When the bowl came, it was easily twice the size in volume of noodle than a pho spot and HELLLOOOO flavor explosion! In this soul-satisfying dish, there were delicate rice noodles bathed in a rich beef flavored gingery spiced broth which was not thick or heavy at all. I could also taste a hint of something like anise or allspice. Omg this stuff was goood! I couldn't eat it all there was so much noodle and I found myself feeling kinda sad that I had to leave it 3/4 full. I know some like to take it to go but that's one thing I can't bring myself to do for noodle soup at least. 

Happy I found a new favorite, highly recommend going off the regular menu path and finding other gem items on offer!",0k_JN9feAn6hop6GzhaGOg,0,0,3,_txDmj5TLfIb6ydkc6UmaQ

1939606,2009-12-18,0,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"This place used to be a Sushi bar. The old place was very limited in space, the bar area took up a lot of the place with only few seating arrangements and not a place for a a small group of people to go.

The redesigned Thai place did an excellent job of optimizing the limited space. There's even large tables in the back that can fit a group of five or more. Also did an outstanding job of decorating as well. Very authentic feel to the place.

Chicken Pad Thai
A nice sized portion, very worth the price. Had a nice spicy taste to it but they didnt include a wedge of lemon or lime to accommodate. A few things i didnt really like such as the noodles being over cooked and too soft, the chicken had a boiled taste and didnt integrate with the rest of the dish, obviously choice of meats were precooked and thrown into the dish to warm up. The tofu had the same case as the chicken.

Chicken Red Curry
Again a very nice sized portion for the price. The curry had a very nice coconut milk taste with a nicely spiced curry  flavor backing it up. The chicken was the same as the Pad Thai, thrown in and wasnt given enough time to integrate with the rest of the dish giving it a bland taste. The bamboo shoots could have been slices of bamboo instead of slivers, would have improved the taste and texture. 

Overall a huge improvement from the Japanese place they replaced. I'll be coming back to try out the menu some more.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,5,0,4,UYD926kbX_uVMmevLvXU2Q

The food speak for itself. Solid solid Thai food.

The soup not sure if changes from day to day. It reminding me of congee with the rice and other goodies in it. It the perfect hearty soup start meal on Vegas winter day. The salad was nice the house dressing was solid. The fried egg roll and wonton is exactly that nothing special. The chicken satay get two skewers not huge more appetizers portion but perfect amount consider all the food you get. I ordered the sweet basil (ground chicken for protein). I went 3 since first time and had no idea the heat scale they do. The three was pretty mello just fyi. You get choice of rice steamed rice, or fried rice. Not sure if charge for brown rice but they do have it as an option. Everything I had was delicious.

It's a very small, cozy restaurant with a hole-in-the-wall, third-world-country feel. The wait staff all wears vests brandishing the restaurant logo. 

My first visit to the restaurant, I was having a very late lunch in the middle of the afternoon. I was the only customer present. This is great if you prefer some solitude. The service was friendly. I ordered the beef salad lunch special and was happy.  This is the only Thai restaurant to which I have been thus far that has beef salad as a lunch special option.

There are two types of lunch specials: The ""regular"" lunch special and the ""combo"" lunch special. The combo lunch special comes with a chicken sate skewer, peanut sauce, and fried rice as compared with the regular lunch special. 

My second visit was two months later during more ""regular"" lunch hours. There were two other parties in the restaurant. The wait staff looked like they hated their lives. I ordered a pad thai lunch special with beef. Their noodles seemed a bit soggy and the beef was tough.

Fortunately for Thai cuisine lovers and unfortunately for Benjarong, the neighborhood is peppered with Thai restaurants that are not nearly as hit-and-miss. I would in general pass on this one and drive a mile to a better option.",gP6TJw0JaG_35lJuk-cP_Q,0,0,2,8FHox0RwZooOiZVGu831jw

And if the food isn't good, they won't fix your order. For example, if you complain the food is too salty/ Spicy/etc, this is what they will tell you, ""it's how the food is suppose to taste."" 
Just today I ordered a noodle soup, chicken combo, and curry for delivery. I asked the waitress what the spice levels were and she told me 1-10. I asked for 8, making it clear I wanted it very spicy. I specifically said ""I want it Very spicy, please"". When the food was delivered, it wasn't spicy AT ALL. Like, ZERO spice. Not to mention, other things were disappointing about the order; the rice was over cooked, the papaya salad was bland, and the green beans were mushy. So, I called to make a complaint but only about the food not being spicy AT ALL. The waitress says, ""that is spicy."" (As if she tasted it)  And then she hung up on me. I proceeded to call her back (I wanted to know why she hung up on maybe it was an accident) but she hung up on me again. I called her back to ask for her name and she hung up on me a third time. Just wow. I guess hanging up on a customer is easier than simply apologizing for an incorrect order. At this point, I lost all my appetite and my husband and I felt so disrespected we decided to drive over to the restaurant and personally return the food. When we got there, I asked the waitress for her name again, but she would not give it to me. Instead, she told us that we wouldn't be getting a refund and if we wanted it spicy, we should've asked for a level 15 (on a 1-10 scale? ) And then, she told us to talk to the owner if we have a problem. She just had us wait for the owner to arrive, without giving us any specific time as to when he/she will be arriving. I was with my husband and two toddlers. We all just waited uncomfortably inside the restaurant for more than half an hour before the waitress decided to come hand us the refund. We weren't able to speak to the owner. We didn't receive any apologies. I don't know what happened to the owner or if the owner was even suppose to show up or if she just wanted to make us wait for no reason but it took her over 40 minutes to give us a refund.

2621871,2011-08-01,0,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"I finally got around to visiting this one.  A few people have asked me now if I've been here, and it is just so far from my house!  It was totally worth the trip though.  I was impressed.  Benjarong is a gourmet Thai restaurant that is taking American Thai food to the next level.  I ordered the Salmon steak green curry ($15.99) and the Crab papaya salad ($8.99).

The crab papaya salad was pretty good.  It was slightly sweet with no vinegar, but the flavor went well with the crab legs.  The crab legs themselves had to be cracked.  They weren't the best crab legs I have ever had, and there were only three of them, but this was a really nice addition to the dish.  The one downside is that I wouldn't say this was an authentically flavored papaya salad, and Thais might be disappointed in this classic dish.   The portion was huge though, and I couldn't even finish half of it.  

Next up was the salmon green curry.  This had a beautiful presentation, with a light green curry sauce with green peas, spread in a thin layer over the dish.  The portion of salmon was healthy, and the quality was too.  The curry sauce was a bit sweet, but I could tell it was a homemade curry sauce, and was well made.  It reminded me of the style of curry served at Pan Asian, but lighter.  I liked the fact that there wasn't a soup of this curry.  That would have been too sweet.  The curry was used like a light sauce rather than a traditional fully loaded soupy or chunky curry.  It went really well with the salmon in such a refined way.  The salmon, while deliciously prepared, did have a few bones. In Thailand, the bones are eaten, but this could bother some Western patrons.  Take it from me though, the dish was worth the few little bones.  

I was impressed by this Thai restaurant.  It fits in well with the area, and goes for an affordable, but upscale atmosphere and food style.  There are a few dishes on the menu that I don't believe I have tried.  Some of the dishes are definitely a bit Americanized, but they are done well.  I have a feeling that digging deeper into the menu would result in finding some good, authentic dishes.

We love it because it's so close to the house, which makes for convenient, last minute dinner plans. We don't like it because they're a bit more on the pricey side (for Thai food). They always seem to mess something up on or order. Most recently they forgot to give us our streamed rice to go along with our curry. They're a bit ""cheap"" with their rice too! They provide a small container of steamed rice for twice the amount of curry. If you ask for more rice they want to charge you $3! That's including when we order multiple curry entrees! We always end making our own rice at home because the proportions never mount up.

On a positive note, the wait staff are very pleasant, although it is very difficult to communicate with them. The veggie green curry is outstanding and so is the Thai dumplings, according to my fiancée. I always get the Thai noodle soup and have them make it vegan for me. I always ask for no MSG, it tastes swell without that crap. We also tried green curry with scallops, scallops were over cooked and miniature! save your $2 and stay away from that.

The soup was a bit sub-par, but then again, I am measuring it against the tom yum from Komol. I ordered everything at a level 7 spicy which the waitress said would be pretty spicy, but it was not spicy at all. That's fine, I just added a shitload of spicies from their little jars of fiery goodness. Now on to the dessert. WOW. The banana rolls were just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.

Anyways....

Benjarong is a nice small and quiet neighborhood restaurant.  The staff there were all really friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed. The menu offered several choices. We ended up choosing Crab Rangoons (I know, I should have went more THAI), green pork curry with extra eggplant, and chicken pad thai.

The crab rangoons were alright. I guess I should expect that since it is a thai restaurant.  Too much cream cheese, not enough crab.. And the cream cheese was still a bit firm. 

The food came out pretty damn fast.. LIke lightning fast. I was like DAMN that's fast. Really, that's what I said in my head as I saw the food arriving.

The green curry was my favorite part. It had a nice kick but I wish the eggplant was cut bigger. It was thinly sliced so it was hard to really taste the flavor of the eggplant (which is my favorite part of green curry). But nonetheless, the sauce was delicious with white rice which comes with your order.

The pad thai was sweet. If you need a little kick, make sure to ask for the spice tray as there is none on the table. I liked the sweetness of it. A little bit different that most other pad thai that I had. The sauce was thicker than what I am use to but it was good.

I ordered satay chicken sticks and a sort of ground pork and vegetable rice dish, both of which were beyond sensational. The chicken was deliciously marinaded and seasoned and I loved their satay sauce and the rice dish stood on its own as a main meal - I'd gladly order it to eat for lunch or dinner anytime at all.

I also got a pork noodle soup which I was less crazy about, but this was probably because I tried to keep it for later (the following day) and by this time the noodles had begun to disintegrate into the soup, making things a bit gooey and nondescript.

The staff here were also really welcoming and friendly. They asked me ""Where in England I was from"" to which I replied my standard ""The Australian part"" (everyone in the USA seems to think I'm from England for some reason) and we had a bit of a laugh about this and we swapped anecdotes about friends and family who had been to Australia and about Thai food in Australia.

It was our first time to Benjarong. The place is pretty tiny with probably less than 10 tables and it's not fancy by any means but the service was good and the food was too. 

We ordered edamame to start with some of their yummy Thai tea and I of course had to try their chicken pad Thai. The hubby got the Beef and Broccoli. The chicken pad Thai had great flavor. Did have to grab my lemon from my water though to squeeze onto it. I usually like to add lime to my pad Thai to break up the sweetness. Usually lime comes as a garnish. The noodles were a little overcooked so they kind of mushed together but I did like how it was packed with perfectly cooked chicken and fresh bean sprouts. I also tried my husband's Beef and Broccoli and thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of it. Fresh and flavorful.

I think they might hear an American voice and think we have a different spice tolerance.  We don't.  A 10 means a Thai 10, not what they might perceive as an American 10.  We cook very spicy foods and eat hot peppers with most of our meals.  While they do provide us with spicy pepper sauce on the side, that is not what I consider food that is a 10 on the spicy scale.  Food that is spicy is cooked with spice.  If I wanted my food to be spicy after the fact, I would add my own hot sauce.

I asked to speak with a manager and the servers just played dumb like they didn't understand what I was saying. It was my first time eating here and definitely my last. If you want good authentic real Thai food check out lotus of Siam, Archi's Thai Bistro, and/or Thai BBQ.",-AXCpsIGp5Wq1e6wVX4YlA,0,0,1,7qogfLHYrVPOft3A_pQoKw

The wait staff was very nice and talked to my 5 year old which he enjoyed.  The tom kha koong soup was delicious!!! I loved the flavors! However, I wish they would remove the ingredients you don't eat (those that are just cooked with for flavor) before they serve it. I liked the pineapple curry sauce for the most part, but next time will ask it to be less spicey. The tofu was soso. My husband ordered the veggie pad thai. That was delicious as well! Will be back! It's in a convenient location and I love Tom Kha soup so that's my new spot for it!!

The food is solid.   I'm a huge fan of their papaya salad, and have had a variety of their other dishes, including curries and the BBQ chicken. I like the variety of the menu, and the fact that you can request a spice level which exceeds normal western palettes (and they aren't afraid to give you the spice level you order).   I did try a cupcake for dessert on this last visit (not sure why I would order a cupcake in a Thai restaurant), and would strongly suggest never to order them.

The reason I'm not returning is the service.   I agree with other reviewers that the servers hated their lives.  Yes,  the water glasses were filled and the dishes brought out promptly.

     We ordered Benjarong's Signature Pad Thai and Pork Curry with white rice. Pad Thai comes in a very big portion and it has pretty much everything in it: shrimp, pork, chicken and beef. The sauce is good but it could be more juicy. We ordered level 5 in spiciness and it is not spicy at all, same situation with the curry. I wasn't too impressed with the curry, it is a bit too watery for me and the portion is kind of small compared to the Pad Thai, more potatoes than pork for sure. I will say with the same price, Pad Thai is surely the one to go to. My boyfriend, who lives around the corner and often comes here for the curry and rice to go, thinks they give out bigger portion when it is in the box.

I told her that I would pay for one meal only as we had already eaten the salad and soup that came with the lunch special; she tried to tell me that I didn't just get to decide what I would pay for.

5363187,2012-07-28,0,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"I love Thai food.  I have been all over the west side Vegas to find the best spot, and Benjarong is my favorite.  I've tried Jasmine Thai, Panna Thai, Pin Kaow, Archi's, Basil N Lime, and the only Thai place in Vegas that could compete was Komol Restaurant (which is, funnily enough, not on the west side of town).  I live in the Centennial area and make the drive to the southwest whenever I get the Thai food shakes.

When I go in a group, we normally order family style and each grab a bit from all the plates rather than ordering individually.  This way, nobody has to fight over food.  My favorite dishes are the Chicken Pad Thai (spicy level 3) and Pineapple Curry with Chicken (spicy level 4).  The Pad Thai has excellent flavor.  It isn't overly subtle, but it isn't overpoweringly sweet or sour either.  Pad Thai is traditionally not supposed to be spicy, so for an authentic taste, try not to burn out your taste buds!  The pineapple curry is fantastic-- they actually serve it in a hollowed out pineapple!  There are chunks of chicken, pieces of diced pineapple, red and green peppers, peas, and onions.... Unless you're like me and ask for it without :).  While the Pineapple Curry is my favorite, the Green, Red, Panang, and Yellow curries aren't bad ways to go, either.  I just love the brightness of the pineapple, and how it soaks up the curry and creates a flavor explosion in my mouth.  Pad See Ew (noodles with beef and Chinese broccoli) is also quite nice.

In the evenings, the Thai Iced Tea is buy one, get one free.  It's a tasty drink, but use caution so you don't get full on that and have to miss out on the food.  Their mango sticky rice is pretty good, but I'd say that's the ONE thing that Archi's has on Benjarong is better mango sticky rice.  

Service is quick and if you have leftovers (which is often the case), they'll box it for you.  I think that's great because being such a klutz, I'd spill my precious curry all over and be paralyzed by my wracking sobs due to the loss.",b8VLOP2Juoqen4ySh0-JOw,4,2,5,SCB2XhQ-uxsqANFB_EhGTQ

Benjarong is a great place and where they achieve higher than other places is in the level of presentation. I ordered the pineapple curry and it was served in a whole hollowed out pineapple. I ordered a 10 on the heat scale which I felt had about a 1 or 2 level of heat. They told me after they asked how everything was that the cooks have me and I quote ""white boy 10"" and next time to ask for Thai 10. I can complain and say I asks for hot so why give that but then I understand that you have to appease to Americans like myself and give a version of 10 so we can handle and still find it edible.

Everyone is always friendly and I love their pad se ew (spelling?) and brown rice fried rice (it makes me be fat while thinking I'm healthy). The inside is to the point with about 10 tables and everything I've had has been either amazing or pretty good. The only tiny tiny tiny complaint is there panang curry tends to be on the runny side, which could be good depending on how you like it. It's just that every time I tell them to thicken it up it just seems very thin but that is a very very minor preference that takes nothing away from the overall quality.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,5,0,4,eF0LR_626zxWyQju50dIgw

We got the lunch special, which for $9.99 had a huge amount of food.  I had the Sweet Spice Basil chicken, which was wonderful.  You got jasmine rice, chicken satay, a small eggroll, a wonton, and some cucumber type salad.  So much food I had to get a doggie bag.  My friend had the pad thai, which she loved.

5709645,2013-11-23,1,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"Ordered Take Out at  9pm

I'm Thai. All the Authentic stuff we eat at home (imagine Thai women all pounding away at the green papayas while roasting peppers that makes you cough like a hipster getting peppered sprayed when you walk into the house. Everytime you eat something you sweat like a pig and you suck in air like a jet's engine through your teeth for some relief.) but it's hard to make Pad Thai without a wok at home. That is why I order out for Pad Thai. 

My pad Thai was mushy. The noodles were mushy like when you boil craft mac and cheese noodles then get distracted by Facebook then come back 20 minutes later and the noddles becomes mushy. I'm exaggerating a bit but they were mushy. No peanuts, and no heat. It was kind of  bland. 

The pineapple fried rice was almost on the way to becoming the best damn fried rice I have ever tasted. Tomatoes, pineapple, and they threw in raisins. The rice's texture and taste was lovely, but it was quite bland.",4wMh3OTCZrzV2OcJ_ey6tQ,0,0,2,y2RJ7rgq3oMZTLvIG5lu6A

I've had the roasted duck before. It was decent but not spectacular. I made the mistake of ordering duck fried rice here and I would give that dish 2 stars. There were literally huge chunks of duck thrown in with the rice. One would think I would be happy but not this gal. There were 6-7 pieces, most were fatty with bone attached. I would expect this kind of preperation for a typical sliced duck and steamed rice meal. For a fried rice dish however, meats are always boneless and cut into smaller pieces. At Pin Kaow they actually shred/dice the meat smaller so it's distributed evenly in the fried rice dish. It's so much better by leaps and bounds.

I've also had the BBQ chicken at Benjarong which was also decent. Everything else I've had there has escaped me. That sums it up to not so memorable meals but not bad enough to boycott :-)",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,1,0,3,mHG8WLpPAMI-4XAJzSUfoQ

DON'T WANT TO OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKES, will rather hang-up on you when you call than apologize and in person they will blatantly LIE to your face. I had made an order over the phone they made a mistake and gave my husband the wrong order, i called to correct it but they kept on hanging up on me when the mistake was theirs. When my husband showed up at the place for them to fix their mistake they said they were going to give us a 30% off for the next time by saving our number. The next time when we called  to make an order as soon as i mentioned the 30% discount they hung up on me, and every time i called they didn't pick up, so they saved our number so they will ignore our calls. When my husband went there they LIED every way they could 1st they said i had never placed an order, then they said i refused the discount, then finally i ate the wrong order they sent me the first time before returning it, all LIES. Just DISHONEST POEPLE when you make a mistake on someone's order you fix it , and when you offer a discount you honor it or simply don't offer it in the first place. You don't save someone's number just to avoid their calls, and definitely don't LIE because you are trying not to get in trouble.

5864016,2011-01-28,6,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"Wow, I've had bad Thai before but this place out did them all.

I ordered Chicken Larb (5*) and Chicken Masuman Curry (7*) for take out.

First the Curry;

The taste, ugh.  I don't know what was wrong but it was horrible.  Seemed like there was to much fish sauce or something.  It was to tangy and not the least bit sweet.  And then there was the Potatoes.  Very large pieces and not one of them was cooked all the way through.  I had asked for this to be very spicy (7*)  It was very mild.  I could barely feel any heat.

Second the Larb;

The flavor was OK.  Not to bad, but not the worst I've had.  The texture though....Very, very gritty.  Like there was dried spices thrown in at the end.  It just ruined it for it.  I also asked this to be some what spicy (5*) and they came pretty close to that.  The thing was, it was WAY more spicy than the Curry.

Needless to say I don't think I'll be going back here again.  It's a shame, they are just down the street.",wfx2G50lMeSK_kqcQqP0lw,1,0,1,QbxQmo5AORtBWrrvVbuLVQ

The flavors are well balanced and even the fried food is not oily! My go to's are the large wonton soup which I can ration for days.

5934543,2010-04-30,0,_8yxceldCT7oe0wJC-yDPA,"I think Thai food is quickly becoming my favorite ethnic cuisine, as every time I see a Thai restaurant I always look forward to dining there. I've driven past Benjarong dozens of times, and only finally decided to try it out after a recommendation from a friend of mine who had a positive experience there. 

At the time of this review, I have dined there twice, once for take-out and once for lunch. First off, I'd like to say that the service is on par with many other Thai joints, friendly and attentive. I think it'll be hard to find bad service at any given Thai restaurant because I've noticed that Thai people are very friendly in general. 

The food however, was slightly disappointing. Not that it was bad, it just didn't live up to my expectations. Food was average and the service was actually above average. I came here during lunch time and opted for a lunch special. I had the Spicy & Sweet Basil Beef. The portions were decent and the food was presented quite pleasantly. 

In the end I was satisfied with my dining experience, but nothing more. But I must admit if I lived within a mile of this place this would be a local go-to Thai spot.
