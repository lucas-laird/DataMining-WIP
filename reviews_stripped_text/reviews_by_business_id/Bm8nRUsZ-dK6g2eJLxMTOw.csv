The nigiri sushi was very heavy on the rice and light on the fish.We stayed away from the rolls and stuck with the nigiri sushi. The owner/chef, noticing us going for the more ""costly"" alternative, decided to load the sushi with an overwhelming amount of rice. It was an obviously underhanded way to get us to order less and get us full faster. Do not be fooled by the posted photograph. We've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and this by far is the worst. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",msmtb5SYvQoDztUN-4oSTQ,3,1,1,MUGB_zWiFWJOaER4HNXP2w

What a great experience, I have not enjoyed an AYCE sushi experience like this in years. I was the first customer at Sushi in Summerland and a weekly visitor for 7 years, till the original owner sold the location and left for Henderson. After he left, the location took a fast and steady decline. I have spent the last 5 years in sushi limbo, trying one place after another. Then I found Naka Sushi! Not only is the original owner of Sushi in Summerland in the kitchen, the namesake Naka is behind the counter serving up the best quality and variety of AYCE I have had in years. The restaurant is well staffed and Naka is crazy fast with a happy go lucky attitude that is a breath of fresh air.
You have to appreciate a Chef that is willing to say no when ordering an item because he does not feel it is up to par. When was the last time that happened in an AYCE Sushi Restaurant? My biggest thrill was enjoying some of their kitchen specialties I enjoyed years ago, but have been unable to find equal; Spicy Baby Octopus, Dynamite, Green Mussels, HOT Shrimp Heads, Etc.
With the talent running this Restaurant, I would expect to spend the next 7 years back in AYCE Sushi Heaven!
FYI. I joined Yelp just to post this review, so you know this comes from the heart!",dWVdlZ3Pmz4HUGF5pXLmPg,5,2,4,_u9RfylMT_leFlj7HOCumA

As I was searching on Yelp for All you can eat sushi, this place popped up and since I never tried this spot out I said ""Why Not."" My bf and I hasn't had sushi in a while and since we were craving for it for months it seemed like a perfect time to go.

Naka Sushi was not a disappointment. It sure served us justice! The staff was on point with drinks and ordering sides. The sushi chef was very friendly as well. I looked at the menu and noticed that AYCE was $21.95 for dinner and $19.95 for lunch. Now that is not bad at all! 

The sushi was delicious and they had a lot of rolls to choose from. My favorite was the SSS roll...it was amazing! We also ordered some yellow tail, octopus, surf clam, and Cajun albacore. All delicious and not overloaded with rice. They also had $1 hot sake, I'm not a sake fan but that is not a bad price at all!",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,2,4,9Ddr00ic3GTTHywMMrMdYw

We've visited for lunch on 2 occasions and tried various choices including veggie tempura, tonkatsu, chicken katsu, sashimi, and California and spicy tuna rolls. While the katsu items are decent and generously sized, they are a bit on the oily and soggy side. The tempura batter is too thick and more like a beer batter than actual tempura. The sashimi and rolls were disappointing. The freshness and quality of the fish was mediocre. The lunch combos also come with a decent miso soup and salad.

Service was a bit slow and our server seemed a bit confused and disengaged. Both times, it was not that busy, but it took awhile to get drink refills and our check.

The food rates about 2-2.5 stars, but we'll round up to 3 stars because of the inexpensive value. Will we return? Probably not. We'd rather spend a bit more for better quality.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,3,2,3,3HoPNPY-f7MGX2saYheGzg

First of all, we noticed the place had a fishy smell as we entered. The waitress noticed us right away and welcomed us with a smile in cheerful tone of voice so that was a good impression. The interior was like a very old looking restaurant - Back to the 80's. The background music was also totally random which ranged from old Japanese music, to Jazz, to the Beatles sound tracks. Not good or bad at this point, just little classic feeling.

We had counter seats and the chef Naka served us. Even though there were only 3 groups including us at that time, he kept forgetting our orders. The fish in show case looked dry and some white fish had a slight browning to the color, which shows that they are not fresh at all. 

I saw some small blocks of tuna that were sitting out of plate in the show case, and when we ordered Poke Salad, he used THE blocks that were not on plates and served it with way too much sauce. The salad bowl was almost half full with sauce. We didn't want to finish the salad because of where the tuna came from and the overly strong sauce taste.

They have a huge choice on Rolls instead of Nigiri and most of Nigiri is limited to 1 order per person. Fresh oyster looked fresh but there was a fishy smell that savored in my mouth. Grilled Shrimp comes in a skewer with 3 TINY shrimps with LOTS of sweet sauce on top. An order of Sweet Shrimp and the Scallop come with 2 pieces of Sushi, but the Shrimp/Scallop a single piece was cut into 2 pieces to fulfill the orders.  On top of that, there was only 3 choices on dessert which were coconut mochi, cookies&cream mochi, or rainbow sorbet. They were also on the 1-order-per-person list. Very stingy.

Side dishes were lined up with diverse of Tempura and fried food etc. Our shrimp tempura was crispy and Agedashi-Tofu was good! They had Salmon-kama which the size was reasonable though the fishy smell was still there.

The waitress/waiter was a good impression at our check-in, but they weren't as attentive as we thought. Our counter was immediately full of empty plates and none of them cleaned them up until they stop looking around and stand at ""their position"" to look over other tables.

As I mentioned. the freshness of fish and how they take care of them were questionable. We were hesitant to keep ordering more food. We finished our meal with a small cookies&cream mochi ice cream cut in half and left the place behind....

The service was quite excellent.  Our server made a couple suggestions that allowed us to get the items we wanted for the most efficient price.  The restaurant offers all you can eat options, dinner specials and individual options.

We had the japanese lasagna roll, baked green mussels, california roll, scallop roll with yum sauce, and a salmon/jalapeno/avacado roll.  The ingredients were fresh and well made.  The rolls were tight, but the hot sushi didn't keep its integrity.  I don't think it is fair to expect hot sushi rolls to stay super tight.  The appetizer miso soup and salad were good as well.  The pricing was quite fair for all dishes.

I would recommend people go here for great sushi and the great service.  I'm not sure where all the negative reviews come from.  I get that there are people who know more about sushi than me.

First of all they are the only place we have been to for ayce that would charge more than a dollar or two for a two year old for sushi. Most are free since they don't really eat more than a few things. They were going to charge 9.95 but after only eating a couple things and the roll taking an hour to make they didn't charge. The rolls do not taste good. We first ordered nigiri. The tuna and salmon were cut very irregularly and uneven. The rice was loosely rolled and did not hold together. This was the highlight of the meal. We next tried some of their rolls. Once again the rolls were loosely rolled and all of the rice fell off before being picked up. The rolls were overly sauced. I was unable to distinguish a mango sauce from the eel sauce (except the color of the sauce). All of the rolls we tried seemed to be overly sweet or super spicy. Their yum yum sauce seemed to be nothing more than mayonnaise. Also we had to send a couple pieces back because the fish had discoloration and we didn't want to eat it.

They always have the freshest fish and the staff is very helpful and will serve you ""surprises"" for you to try. Just to put this in perspective, once Naka and Aki moved from Sushi Factory, it was hard for me to eat at any other sushi place because the quality and service just couldn't match Naka and Aki's

The best things my family usually orders are:
(1) Saba (Mackerel) (I'm known as Mr. Saba there cause most people don't order it but I order a TON of it)

Naka is located in a ""feels like it's old or run down"" shopping center. When entering there's a light fishy smell, but you quickly get used to it. Your eyes take a moment to adjust because they keep the seating area dark.

To give some background, I am no rookie to the AYCE sushi game. I can hold it down, and have impressed many a person with my skills. I let the game down today. I can't be blamed though, and you'll understand.

My boyfriend and I sat ourselves in a booth and studied their menu. We came during lunch which had a good and steady crowd. After 10 min passed, we realized that they take longer than what we're used to make a roll. When we finally got our first rolls, it was to our dismay to see the amount of rice used. Don't get me wrong, I love rice, just not in the proportion that it was to the rest of the food in every roll. That tiny detail was what made us tap out after 3-4 rolls each.

The ""Muscle Blaster"" was a favorite of ours because we love gyoza. This roll had 5 pieces of a gyoza  in each. ""The Brian"" roll was so different. The banana was a refreshing taste for your palette. Once the banana is gone it gets kind of bland except for the little kick at the end from the jalapeno. Today the fish wasn't the freshest. The staff was attentive though. The choice in music was interesting. It was a mix different types. They do have a separate menu for regular dining, but I didn't take a look. For those of us familiar with the China town area here in Vegas, this place reminds me of Ichiza, but with more sushi options.

Naka Sushi was highly recommended, so I thought we'd give it a shot. Although it's not the best sushi I've ever had (or even the best AYCE sushi I've ever had), this was moderately priced and offered a wide selection of sushi, rolls, and side dishes.

We arrived around 5, and there were plenty of open tables. This was a plus, because service was fast and our servers were super attentive. My husband and I split everything: from poke salad and edamame, to eel sushi and a variety of rolls. The caterpillar and rainbow rolls were my favorite, and although the TED and Muscle Buster rolls were good, they were HUGE -- it was a struggle to eat a piece in one bite.

I know the food was fresh, because I saw the chefs making it, but some of the fish seemed a little ""off."" It also seemed like some of the cold rolls were a little too warm, and some of the warm food was a little cool, but maybe that's just me. I liked most of our choices, and for $22 each, you can't really complain.

It seemed like most of the other customers were regulars, because the staff greeted many of them by name, so it's obvious this place is doing something right.

I had tried around 5 places or so from 2008-2009, and all were fairly good, but I hadn't found a ""spot"". I shop at Smith's, Big Lots, and Savers often, so when I saw Naka Sushi with the grand opening sign with All You Can Eat.... I figured why not?

Beforehand, I tried Yummy Grill and Sushi once, and it wasn't bad, but again... I wasn't blown away either.

So I can say now, after more than a year of eating here; I come atleast once, sometimes twice a month. I've felt more than welcome each and every time. They know me by name. I've brought numerous friends in (even some that have had my favorite place mentioned above, Oki Doki)..... and we all agree. We absolutely love it.

I see numerous sushi places everywhere, and believe me. I want to try them all. But it's hard to want to when I feel so at home in Naka.

Maria Roll, Santa Maria Roll, Spicy Baby Octopus, Salmon Skin Handroll, Teriyaki Chicken and Cheese Roll, Octopus nigiri, Surf Clam nigiri...... those are my ""must haves"", and then I usually pick out 2-5 other new things to try every time I go. I've probably had about 85% of the menu and there's maybe less than a handful of things I wouldn't have again and that's mostly due to my personal tastes, not because it was terrible.

I'll get around to trying some other sushi places eventually. But my permanent Go-To spot is definitely Naka.

For the price: you get quality service, always familiar faces, a very large amount of choices for ""all you can eat"", diverse musical selection along with the perfect home-feeling ambiance, there's always sports on if you're into that, food that rarely (if ever) disappoints...... it's all good.",90ZI2l_9kvK3_snex6E5rw,4,1,5,posatMU0Ld2oMNWaG3hENQ

My wife and I came for lunch and was seated pretty quickly.   We ordered our usual quantity of nigiri and appetizers for the first round.  

Appetizers were ok.  The dynamite was below average.  Nigiri sushi had way too much rice and the slices of fish were not top quality and were inconsistent.   We noticed that when we picked up the nigiri sushi to eat, the rice fell apart, making it difficult to dip into the soy sauce.

We had ordered 8 orders of salmon nigiri on the first round but 8 orders of red snapper came out instead, which my wife tried and commented that it looked and tasted like talapia.  The waitress commented that she had thought we wanted snapper, not salmon.   Do they sound alike?

Anyway, after the initial order, we ordered maybe a few more appetizers and a couple more nigiri.  Not much better.  The karaage chicken tasted microwaved and was not crisp.  We lost all appetite and opted to just finish what we had and leave.  Usually when I leave a ayce sushi bar for lunch, I don't even want to think of dinner.  Today I left hungry.

The server happens to be Naka's wife and she was very attentive and she offered many new dishes to try. 

There were different appetizers to try out (as usual with AYCE) we tried their steak wrapped over asparagus rolls and yuuum the steak was really good. 

We were able to order 1/2 rolls so we got to try more. We tried the Toyota roll which is a baked roll and it was delish! It's similar to a japanese lasagna. I wasn't able take pictures of sushi because by the time it hit the table it's gone. 


This place is cozy and the AYCE is 21.95 definitely a good place to check out in the Summerlin area. 

I asked about the peanut butter mochi and its not on the menu nor do they have it in stock :( 

The whole BOGO discrepancy was that they asked someone from the LVRJ to post a deal on BOGO asahi beer but the journalist posted BOGO on asahi beef -- (is what we were explained) I believe it, I honestly don't think a restaurant would try to scam people that bad in desperation to come in, especially if they're food is good quality.",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,5,1,4,oiewDEjHnqtp4jiWM2R5rQ

The fish they have is definitely fresh, which was great, and a big bonus was the variety they had to offer (ex. special rolls). Price is also good, and is the cheapest that I've found thus far. The presentation of the site and food is alright. The service they had was not totally commendable.
I have to say that my boyfriend and his brother are not the easiest to get along with, but if you can put up with them, you're great, and my boyfriend likes to thank you with a really big tip. I, on the other hand, am nice to you so long as you're good to me, which still ends up getting you a decent tip. With all that said...
The waitress/server we initially had was alright to begin with, but her service started lagging because of the amount my companions kept bugging her about food information. I realize this isn't fine dining, but you could at least have the basic knowledge about the dishes you serve and inform us all. We had also modified a few orders, and the kitchen hadn't followed, so we sent it back, expecting to get it all corrected. Didn't happen - became ghost orders. The most irritating factor about this particular server was that she started ignoring us. We tried flagging her down to simply order more, and she constantly breezed by our table. 
The savior of the night was a young man who was supposed to be her helping hand. He created small chat with us, entertaining my boyfriend's 6 year old nephew, and tended to us when she ignored us. We gave him a 25% tip, and we gave her the coin change from the bill. I actually gave him the tip personally, and left her looking after us dumbfounded. 
Tip is based off the service you give, and is not required, and that is exactly what we practiced.",WdD8hWn-NjSyDYoHqin_tQ,1,1,3,XFs3T8bTtJkWfDXn71ZFJw

Favorites:  
* They have SASHIMI!  One order per person, and it's tuna, yellowtail, and salmon, but it was fantastic!
*Mango Ice Cream
*TED roll - it was so big it was difficult to eat, but the flavors were incredible
*They do half rolls, even at the tables!  So much nicer to try a big variety of food
*Can't beat the price, $21.95 for AYCE dinner?  Awesome.

A little meh:
*They used a LOT of wasabi on the nigiri to hold the fish to the rice.  It was actually a bit overwhelming (and scary at first, since it made the yellowtail look like it had a green spot on it)

NO WAY. I love sushi and firm believer AYCE the only way too go with sushi. It got me worried thinking since its so cheap maybe something not quite right. I was really happy with all the sushi I ordered and the other ones I tried that friends ordered (we all did AYCE).. They have average size menu with lots of the normal things find at any other AYCE spots. I felt the fish was good not the best that I had in Vegas. Freshness.

I placed a reservation for a party of 6 as a tentative headcount for 7:30 on a Friday evening. When a seventh person arrived, our server didn't even offer to pull over another chair and he had to squish himself at the edge of the booth. The meal was very uncomfortable because our server did not smile, AT ALL. He just hovered over us looking angry...not sure if it was a bad day or if he was upset that he got stuck with a big party doing AYCE. Sorry to tell you that if it was the latter, that is part of your job working at a sushi restaurant who offers AYCE and you should not take it out on your customers. There was another waitress who stepped in and took a few of our orders and she was nice, so it's not the whole staff. 

Anyway. We each paid $22.95 for AYCE dinner, with an additional gratuity for the large size of our group. The fish quality here was questionable. No pride was apparent in the sushi quality or craftsmanship, which was odd because the nigiri in the Yelp photos looked fresh. Ahi and hamachi looked old and sad. The unagi was good, but that's about all. We ordered some rolls and they were forgettable. Dessert is limited to one item per person, and the green tea mochi ice cream was hard and flavorless. 

I wanted to like Naka, as it has been on my bookmarked list of places to try for quite some time now. However, with the sub-par sushi quality  and spotty service, I won't be returning here; I would rather pay a little more for AYCE at Sushi Goyemon.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,4,2,2,lJR5F5ka7xO3nxCpneA6Jg

I didn't find anything unique on the menu... it's a pretty standard run of the Las Vegas ""funny roll names"" you find everywhere, with a few chef's specials.

The all-you-can-eat and lunch specials are reasonably priced. It's supposed to be $21.95 for AYCE dinner, but somehow the check graduated to $27+.

Since my last review, I would say the wait staff has been getting worse. They are inattentive and seem grouchy about taking the AYCE orders... in fact, our table had to kind of flag them down aggressively.",gP6TJw0JaG_35lJuk-cP_Q,3,2,2,V1cC9hjRgG6uvWuFC6Turg

But you know what, for $20 bucks, not sure I can really complain here.  But I recommend the tiger roll, simple and delectable, my goodness!  They do a good one here

Favorites are (as I mentioned earlier) the tiger roll and the paradise roll.  Those are a must and their house salad is one of the best I've ever had.  Homemade ginger dressing, can't go wrong with that.

2662731,2014-04-30,1,Bm8nRUsZ-dK6g2eJLxMTOw,"When the sushi monster hits, all you can eat sushi seems to be the only thought in our minds. Lucky for us, we live close to a huge selection of AYCE sushi restaurants. In order to narrow it down, I phoned around checking AYCE prices and Naka was the only one that had a great affordable dinner price - $21.95. The other places were asking about $24 and up. 

This place is a legit Japanese owned and run establishment (The chefs, all of the waitresses, and a lot of locals at the bar were Japanese). This place is a local gem and I'm so glad we came here. Great price for AYCE sushi, a nice big selection, the fish was super fresh and tasty, the fish to rice ratio wasn't too bad, and the service was great! 

Let's talk about what we ordered:

Sashimi plate (1 per person) - the sashimi was fresh and sweet. We got salmon, yellow tail, and tuna. 5/5

Salmon - my first love, they are sweet and buttery 5/5

White tuna - not bad, just not my favorite 4/5

Albacore - great firm texture and sweetness 5/5

Halibut - very fresh and sweet and melts in your mouth 5/5

Yellow tail - super sweet, buttery and fresh 5/5

Unagi - not bad, just not my favorite 4/5

Ama ebi - (1 per person) we loved that they offer sweet shrimp in the all you can eat meal, yet, it was ok, the sweet shrimp was small and a little different than what we're used to - maybe it wasn't as fresh? We loved the fried heads though. It was fried to perfection! 3/5

Uni - (1 per person) my boyfriend loved it, he said it was very sweet, very fresh, and very good uni. 5/5

Tamago - I loved it! It was homemade and tasted like it was made with love. 5/5

Miso soup x 3 - the miso soup here is so good. They came out at the perfect hot temperature. Nice bits of tofu and seaweed. Great miso flavor but not too salty. This is how a miso soup should taste! 5/5

2 different rolls (Mark and Kara) - the rolls weren't bad, simple and filling. I probably would just stick to nigiri next time. 3/5

Baked mussels (2) - very simple and not impressive, I would skip it next time. 2/5

Fried tempura jalape√±os - they were hot and crispy - not spicy at all - but we enjoyed them. 5/5

Beef wrapped asparagus - these were in a teriyaki sauce, the beef was super tender and flavorful. I loved these! I could eat 5 more plates. 5/5

Strawberry Mochi - (1 sliced in half) typical boxed mochi ice cream, but it was yummy and a great palate cleanser! 5/5

Green tea ice cream - nice green tea flavor and we both loved how it wasn't too sweet. 5/5

This is a perfect option for the budget conscious AYCE connoisseur, but I have become obsessed with Sakana lately so you might catch me over there AYCE'ing it up.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,4,2,4,T1ob23qA6DimQNVM4riAog

First off, when we arrived no one was there to greet us. We just stood there like idiots. I had to ask the chef if we're suppose to sit ourselves. And I guess.. Yes you are suppose to sit yourselves if no one acknowledges you ¬Ø\_(?)_/¬Ø 

Not a busy day. Our waters came out 10 minutes from sitting down, which is a pretty long time for just waters. And than a waiter came by and asked if anyone has taken our orders, uhhh no you haven't taken our orders! 

Let me tell you, this is by far the worse presentation of sushi I have ever seen. The sushi you buy at the grocery store has a better presentation. The fish is falling off the sushi, the sushi is falling apart, the seaweed is not properly sticking. What a mess! It was just a visual disaster. As seen on my pictures.

The rice looked like it had been sitting out too long. You can tell by the picture I posted, it was pretty hard. 

I do not even know what sushi roll came out because when they were brought out they didn't even tell us which roll was which. So that is why in my pictures I do not have the name of the roll. 

Even the edamame tasted old. Looked like they just sprinkled salt on top of the frozen ones you buy at albertsons.

The only thing i have experienced that is a bit of a let-down is that the two lady waitresses that were hired within the last 6 months are a hit or miss when it comes to service.

This place was packed on a Saturday night. .... And they ""lost"" our reservation.
We only had to wait about 20 minutes and were able to get seated so that wasn't so bad.  But still.... 

After experiencing our dinner here... it's no surprise they didn't record our reservation.  Organization is NOT their strong suit.

Three different people took our drink order.... and it took 2 of them to bring them all out.
Three different people kept asking to take our food order... where we'd place an order with one and the next one would step up to ask what we'd like to order... and then after a bit we would have to flag one of them down to remind them about our order.

The sushi was ok.  I wasn't impressed.  I like Naked Sushi and Sushi Wa better.

The one Good thing was that they don't over sauce their rolls... so that is a plus in my book.  

But they do serve A LOT of rice with their sushi and rolls so that the fish which is normal size portions looks small.

Since this is on the other side of town from me, I'll stick to the sushi places on my side of town that I know and like better.",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,0,0,2,iREOkzWUDB3HvV1BnJAa1w

I'm a fan of their teriyaki dishes. If I feel like I need to order something on the healthier side, I would get the teriyaki chicken with brown rice. Today, I ordered the bento for more taste options. Their chicken katsu potion was a little small but since i had a lot of other dishes on my plate, I understood. Super crunchy though! Shrimp tempura was cooked to perfection. The Alaskan Roll wasn't all that impressive but I didn't expect it to be being that it was in the ""regular roll"" section and not one of their ""special rolls"".

As for the service, the waitresses were moving as quickly as they could but the sushi chef did yell at them multiple times to move faster. Not sure what was up with that but I thought it was kinda rude of him. Overall always satisfied with their food and service. Will always be back.

We came across Naka Sushi in the heart of Summerlin! We were very impressed with the friendly service and the amazing quality and a variety of nigiri and sushi rolls. It was a huge bonus that the owner and chef is Japanese. To me that was important because of the friendly nature of the Japanese culture and the expertise factor in sushi preparation and quality of fish selection.The food here reminds us of so many good times throughout Japan.

The music and ambiance here can range from romantic to casual.  The music makes me laugh and smile.

My favorite go to rolls lately have been the SSS Roll, LA Boxing, Brian Roll, and Christmas Roll.

Other items on the AYCE menu include: Miso Soup, Poke Salad and Tempura Vanilla Ice Cream!

I never wince at the check when it comes because I feel that I've gotten mounds of value without sacrificing quality.

I'll make this absolutely clear...Naka Sushi is NOT bad. 

The service is fantastic, the people who work there are very friendly and the rolls actually come at a pretty quick rate when you order them. 

Their downfall is simply how un-rememberable and bland the sushi and food is. It's not bad food by any means...it's just there. 

With All You Can Eat for $21, you can certainly fill up your stomach, but it won't have much of a unique flavor to it.

As a local, my cousin has talked about this magical place where you can eat your fill for $22.95 a person for quite some time now. And it might nauseate you to know that four people finished all the food we ordered, but we did it because who wants to pay additional for leftovers? Not me!

We deduced that they must use cumin in their frying batter, which gives the chicken karaage and the fried oysters really interesting flavor. And that soft shell crab is pretty ridiculous. The albacore, yellowtail, and salmon sushi were each fresh and delicious. The rolls were a little on the heavy side, especially those featuring their signature yum yum sauce, but all were exactly as described. Though we were limited to just one a person, the fresh oysters were fantastic. My favorite thing may have been the spicy baby octopus. And let us not forget that they have tempura ice cream and tempura banana on the menu for dessert, which I let other people order so I could steal bites. I opted for their daily special mint chocolate chip mochi ice cream, which was heavenly.

Naka Sushi is located on Lake Mead and Rampart in a Smiths shopping center. We walked in and were immediately seated.

We ordered a few specialty rolls and sashimi. Out of about 20 items we ordered we only liked 2. The Brian Roll and Mark Roll were both fantastic. But they didnt make up for the rest. Hafl of the sashimi we were afraid to eat because of the strong ""fishy"" smell and taste.

The food is simple, the presentation is zero. It's not bad sushi and it's not great either. Yes, the server was not smiling, but I don't care if he does or not.
If you want to see a smiling clown, go to the circus. He was prompt in seating us, we waited just a few minutes, took our drink order and then on with the sushi in the All you can eat mode.
The first order of various rolls were good and as I said before it's just little round plastic like plates and no presentation points, not too overly sauced and was ok. We didn't get the small soy sauce dishes, but just put the sauce in the larger plate that had the wasabi and ginger on it. The sign on the wall said ""Fresh Wasabi"" $1, but the wasabi that came with the sushi was fresh as can be and had the punch to the nose zip! We started out with one server and then another one started to serve us, which was kind of odd, but it worked. The two guys are busy and if they hired just a single table busser they could take care of business much better. It's not a good thing when suddenly a plate drops down like a stone from heaven and you don't know what the item is, they are too busy to tell you. We actually had one roll fall on our table that we didn't know it was for someone else until we ate it. I'm like, ""We didn't order this"", but it was good so thanks to whoever didn't get it. LOL! I also order a few nigiri sushi (the small bites) and it took a while for it to arrive, I could see it was ready up at the sushi bar, but it sat for a few minutes. Then when it came the rice was noticeably warm which meant they didn't make enough during prep time because it should be cool to compliment the fish. 
The restaurant is tiny inside, but somehow they manage to seat everyone the best they can. Random signs on the walls with specials such as $1 sake and different beers. I had a Sapporo light and it was good, I guess they don't offer the giant godzilla size bottle like most places, but that is ok by me. I am in Summerlin and have a long drive back to Henderson so, no buzz is a good thing. My second drink was Asahi Zero which is a low carb and no alcohol ""beer"", it was cold and good with enough bubbles to satisfy like a coke, but with no sugar overload. The also offer a Mango soda in a bottle and it was good too.
The restaurant is located in or near Summerlin, but I will have to admit there was some skectchy looking people in that parking lot, but that is no fault of the restaurant. Probably just a product of their environment with a thrift store on one side and big lots on the other? Just saying.
Decent sushi option if you are in the Summerlin area, Rampart and Lake Mead. Lunch is $19.95 and dinner is a few bux more.

The restaurant can be considered a hole in the wall spot. Its location is one of the last places I'd ever guess a sushi restaurant existed. Its desolate strip mall location it shares with a Big Lots and Chase threw me off. Naka's a small restaurant that seems to fill up fast, especially during the weekends. I was surprised we were able to find a seat at 7pm on a Friday.

Though we ordered plenty of food, most of what we ordered was forgettable, unfortunately. 

Poke: The only thing that stood out was how watery this was.

Dynamite: 90% imitation crab. The scallops were tough and dry.

Brian's Roll: A unique sweet and savory combination. The basis was a California roll -- if memory serves me right -- wrapped in soy paper with slices of banana tucked inside. To me, I need to have an acquired taste for this.

Spicy Christmas Roll: I can't exactly recall its official title, but it's listed beneath the fried rolls section. This one was probably my favorite roll that I ordered. It's one of the heavier fried rolls on the menu, so I wouldn't advise ordering it towards the end of your meal like I did. 

Mike's Roll: Another roll I'd suggest ordering if you want to try a deep fried roll, and it's much lighter than the Chiristmas roll. Plus, it wasn't bathing in sauces. It's a decent one to start your meal off. 

If you're a visual person and are accustomed to neatly prepared rolls, you might be disappointed with the presentation of the sushi. Some of the rolls we received had a sloppy appearance that didn't entice my appetite. 

Service was fine, but we didn't have one server. Instead, we had four different servers attending to our table. At times, it did cause some confusion. 

Naka's AYCE was unimpressive. I guess for $21 we got what we paid for. I would've gladly spent several more bucks on higher quality food.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,8,2,3,uHo3jImKHj4xCziZ1qG36g

The presentation wasn't all there, but the extremely fresh fish and veggies make up for all of that. The owner was making our rolls and you can tell he loves what he does and puts his heart into it.

The only key points to keep in mind is that the location isn't the prettiest. It's next to a Saver's and is pretty small so dinner time is busy.

Why? And how did this place get 4stars. Truth is I rely on Yelp a lot. And that's the reason why we ended up here. But there wasn't anything special about this place. (That's right yelpers, I'm disappointed with ya'll!!!)

First, it is located on the big lots/terrible herbst complex at lake mead. We went on a Sunday night, 8pm. And it's dead over there. It is kinda sketchy and I'd be scared to go there by myself. Don't get me wrong, I love mom and pop, hole in the wall type places, but this didn't hit the spot.

Second, the food.
No, no, and no. I mean I'd eat anything. But if you're a fatty/self proclaimed foodie, and you're expecting really awesome sushi, this is not the place to go. 
The nigiri, fish and rice ratio was bad. Too much chubby weird shaped rice with super thinly sliced fish. Then I got excited that they have sashimi as part of their ayce. But the fish wasn't fresh, was brown on the edge, and one had a piece of bone on the super thinly sliced salmon. The rolls were blah, and looked really sloppy. Good thing they have half rolls, so you won't have to eat a full roll of disappointment.

I turned on my Yelp app and found a place that just recently opened with no reviews yet.  A new spot wants to impress so it has to be good right?  That's why we're here to find out while getting our fish diet on!  I came here but I was only really looking to order nothing but 20-25 orders of nigiri.

You really can't beat their $21 all you can eat dinner price, most places it ranges from $24-$26.  Lunch was $18 and that's what I had.  I sat at the bar because I wanted my sushi fix fast!  My first order was 3 tuna, 2 salmon, 1 white tuna, 1 fresh eel, (NO TORO), (Out of Uni).

The sushi chef was actually ""Naka""mura, the owner!  How awesome was that??  His wife was working the front desk area.  Naka was sociable and enjoys what he does.

He gave me the tuna and salmon order first and waited until I was almost done to prepare the rest, I downed those quickly.  If I order a bunch, it's because I can eat it in one setting.  

I hate waiting or watching my sushi orders wait on the counter.  And I'll sometimes secretly wish that it's someone elses order that is sitting just waiting there.

While I was eating though, he was persistent on me trying some of their special rolls.  I wasn't interested but I did find out that they do half rolls.  Looking over the menu, none of the rolls really jumped out at me.  For the sake of an honest review I ordered 3 rolls, the first being a mountain roll, second is the naka roll, and finally a scallop roll.  They were all okay but nothing outstanding.  I need to find some sweeter rolls, deep fried rolls, or chefs recommended roll.  

All nigiri comes with a dab of wasabi underneath.  Chef Naka was surprised that I didn't use soy sauce for any of my sushi roll or nigiri, and he was extra surprised that I applied extra wasabi on all my orders.  

They have a facebook page where they'll ask if they can take your picture to promote their shop, I participated.  :D   Definitely give this sushi spot a try, it's not the best, it's not bad, it's good and convenient if you need your sushi fix in the area.

4054968,2012-11-27,0,Bm8nRUsZ-dK6g2eJLxMTOw,"First all, I swear that I've eaten at this Sushi Restaurant at least 3 times before.  Those visits were not so good and I wasn't impressed  However, I have changed my opinion just off my last couple of visits.  

My visits here have always been lunch and it's usually their AYCE.  AYCE Lunch is $18.95 and Dinner is $21.95. Price is about average for Las Vegas.  What I like about Naka is that you can get half rolls, which means more sampling for me.  

My Ratings:
-Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  Pretty good.  I admit that it taste better with white rice. But I feel better about myself if I get the brown rice.

-Calamari:  Literally 4-5 pieces.  Taste good, but don't expect a dish full of fried squid. 

-Mr O Roll:  This is basically a lobster roll and very tasty.  The roll isn't tight like other places and I use to be a snob about this.  But it all goes down the same and its the taste that counts.  Besides, a loose roll to me is basically a mini hand roll. 

-Arizona Roll:  When it comes to sushi, I am bit boring. Regardless where I eat sushi, I usually get a Spicy Tuna, something with tempura shrimp inside, and an Philly Roll.  The AZ Roll is basically all three in one.  Good combination and the best of both worlds. 

-Tuna Nigiri:  They requested that I try it. Pretty good.

-Yellow-tail Nigiri:  My 2nd favorite.  Small, but fresh.  Besides it's all you can eat so order more. 

-Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream:  I have yet to find someone that makes a really good deep fried ice cream or tempura ice cream.  Best I've had was in a Chinese Restaurant in Rome Italy.  Not flying out there for tempura ice cream so this will have to do.  Still good, but wish the ice cream was softer

Service is great from the bar.  Like most sushi restaurants, you are not neglected if you are sitting at the bar.  I did notice that guest in the normal dining area had to wait a little longer for their waiter to get them their food while I got mine with the quickness. 

My only issue, which is not a big deal since I only go here for lunch, is the size of this restaurant. It's small and I can't imagine what a busy night must feel like.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,4,0,4,YU7CT5nQ3A5DktG3Viwkrg

This is one of my favorite sushi bars in Summerlin. Located on Rampart and West Lake Mead, Naka Sushi is in the small corner of the strip mall next to a Dance studio, OmG Boba and Savers.

The sushi here is always great, the service is also pretty prompt. The chefs are always friendly and personable. I recommend the Brian Roll, the Miso is good and the Nacho Roll are all bomb. Usually the custom hand rolls are also pretty Legit, one being the Nitro

Great AYCE lunch and dinner specials are great value. Remember they are open on split shifts and not right through the day.

They have high chairs and are very good with the little ones. The last time I was in there had to be at least 4 other tables with kids and were all catered to with either high chairs or custom rolls from them to eat.

Naka Sushi isn't bad, their AYCE is $21 which is as good as it gets in Vegas, but they also have restrictions on how many times you can order a certain thing, not unheard of, but if I'm paying $21 and want two orders of oysters, I should be able to have it.  They are seemingly accomodating with any ""special requests"" and their fish is fresh, which is worth a million.  

My husband ordered the bento box dinners and it was a pretty generous portion -- the food is pretty good, although the yakisoba did not go over well with my kids.  Also disappointing is there is no AYCE for kids.  Fuji-San used to have a kids rate of $9.99 which was a lot more reasonable for the one roll and one mochi ice cream they typically eat! :)

4. Customer service was good with some singing and grunting from the chef.

2. Not a huge selection of nigiri.

4258973,2015-01-03,0,Bm8nRUsZ-dK6g2eJLxMTOw,"Context: visited Vegas with family and coming from California's ""AYCE Sushi"", this beats it by a landslide. In Cali, the AYCE Sushi quality of fish is not good and cold, everything comes in slabs and there's really no selection. Every menu is the same as every other place. So here was so refreshing to have good quality fish, and a HUGE selection of items. And of course, only $21! Um, what?! 

Sushi: They have a huge selection of rolls and categorize the menu whether you want baked items, fried rolls, spicy rolls, raw fish rolls. There's so much to choose from! My dad, who can only eat baked and cooked food, had a huge selection from the cooked rolls. 

- Baked Salmon Roll: Soft and delicious! They fill it with baked salmon inside! Very flavorful.
- Salmon roll: Raw salmon inside and very fresh fish. They have a choice of putting different stuff inside your roll like asparagus or cucumbers, etc.
- Rainbow roll: This roll was super good! It was our first roll that came out and you could tell immediately the fish here is fresh and not stale and hard. It's a mix of all types of raw fish like albacore, salmon, tuna, etc.
- Cajun albacore sushi: Pretty good, a nice seared style and more spicy flavor
- Ikura (Salmon Egg): You have to already like Ikura to like it anywhere really. I'm not a huge fan, it's really salty but it's not really their fault, just felt like ordering it to try again.
- Salmon sushi: I love Salmon so this was super tasty and fresh
- Surf clam sushi: Not my favorite, but then again you've had to already like surf clam 
- Salmon skin salad: Yummy and delicious! A nice small portion so it's a small taste of it
- Miso Soup

They have a list of items, and you can choose only 1 item per person since they're specialty items! I absolutely loved this idea because at AYCE in Cali they don't even have this option! They have items like Uni Sushi, 6 pieces of sashimi, sweet shrimp, etc. Such a great deal.

- Soft shell tempura: Great item! Comes with a ponzu like sauce, so good!
- Fresh oysters: These were pretty good! Not the best compared to expensive freshwater ones but I'm happy since it's on the menu.
- Kama fish (Grilled Yellowtail): This was DELICIOUS. I'm surprised they even had this on the menu because at sushi restaurants it's about $12-$15 by itself! A must order

Dessert: They have a wide selection of dessert including Green tempura ice cream, banana tempura with ice cream, and a list of normal ice cream selection. I got the GT ice cream and it was tasty and amazing! 

Drinks: We tried this new mango soda and it was so good! (Additional charge) Very refreshing

Environment: I really liked this environment, it's a small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend a huge party. They have a bar and normal seating which I like. 

Service: Their service is a little bit slow because they had 2 huge parties, but we were sitting in front of the sushi chef so that was helpful because they took our order there. But everyone's really friendly and nice! 

So yes, I loved this place because of their wide selection, their choice of dessert, and overall was great.",J01BFkZZJR6CVJtBkq03vw,3,1,4,y991URqUghS9TLNynzewXQ

This is due to the size of the restaurant. it is quite small and cramped but does tie a nice cozy environment. I have known Naka san since he worked at various places in town. I am writing not as a acquaintance but as a real review of the food. For the prices that are charged. The food is decent and comes out fairly fast! Naka san knows his clients and can prepare things while they waiting for their main dishes or their larger sushi orders. The Japanese food on the menu is good. Now having said this, I have some issues with the customer service: At times there is no one to greet the customers and people are standing in line to wait for some acknowledgment. If you are NOT a regular there you would not know to seat yourself. Water and tea take a slightly longer time to get to your table. Getting the attention of your server may also take some time and depending on who that is he/she sometimes forgets things such as a tea refill, water, or even an order. This is not on a regular basis but consistent enough to take note. I eat at Naka's at least 3 to 4 times a month and each time there is one issue from the above either at our table or at another diners. To be fair I do not think the servers are given adequate direction in busing and hosting. This is something that will have to be addressed in order to retain and bring in more clients. The food again is nothing unusual or outstanding...it is good.....it ranks better than some sushi places in town but if you want super quality and service go to Osaka in Henderson or Katsuya in SLV. If you just want a family style meal that is good. This is the place to eat. I eat here out of loyalty to Naka san and his family.

I noticed soon after entering thay the restaurant was fairly empty (3-5 tanles being used) during peak dinner hours on a Thursday night. My roommate and I ventured here to check out their AYCE sushi, which was the least expensive around. During and after dinning, it was apparent why their price was slightly lower. The food quality did not match competitions in the area and their selection was also quite limited when compared to others. I can normally set large amounts of food at higher quality sushi restaurants, however, I only ate 2-3 rolls (which were merely rice, fish, and avocado, no better options) along with a few orders of nigiri. After that, my stomach became upset and quite bloated. I also noted immediately that the rice was VERY warm compared to other sushi bars. Whole the rice is normally cool or room temperature, the heat of the rice was very off-putting and altered the taste of the already lowER quality fish. I won't be returning here and will gladly pay $3-5 more for an AYCE option down the road for a better variety, higher quality, and improved overall experience.",4beJnHnO6LH-bOBDEL6mEA,0,0,2,1-H0Rl6BZpgHGLKyML6btw

We got there around 6:15 on a Friday night and it was pretty empty but by the time we left, it was a full house. The restaurant is not that big. They have around 10 tables or so. 

For the appetizer, we tried karage, salmon skin salad, fresh oysters( today's special), and vegetable croquettes( today's special). Only vegetable croquettes was notable. However, I don't really taste the veggie besides potato.

I'm a nigiri lover so I usually start my sushi orders there. We tried the following nigiris: salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, spicy tuna, scallop, sweet shrimp, sea urchin, wasabi tobiko, tamago negi toro and eel. Scallop nigiri was on their special of the day and it was pretty fresh. Salmon was decent and buttery. Uni was not bad for ayce. Tamago was looking a little dark but it tasted decent. Negi toro was pretty good. Spicy tuna and red snapper was fishy and mushy. Not a fan of wasabi tobiko either. It was bit fishy as well and it wasn't covered up by the wasabi. The only roll we tried was eel and avocado roll since we were too full. It was not bad. We all had tempura green tea ice cream for dessert . It was yummy.

Appetizers - 
Softshell crab - standard, but good. Nice crisp batter. 
Spicy baby octopus - this was meh, just some boiled chewy octi with some teriyaki sauce. 
Tuna tataki - this was pretty good! Seared tuna, ponzu and some onions. 
Sashimi side (2 pc of each fish) - Salmon was pretty fresh, the yellowtail was good, albacore was OK but still acceptable. 
Jalapeno popper - theirs was really good. I like the thin sliced bite size pieces over whole ones. 

Nigiri - 
Cajun Albacore - was really on point! Ordered several rounds. 
Super White - pretty  decent range of freshness, 
Yellowtail - pretty good as well 
Habanero masago - this was awesome and spicy 
Uni - very fresh, sweet and creamy 
Masago - good stuff with some quail egg. 

I think the rice to fish ratio here is pretty good actually. They do put wasabi in their cuts, so if you are sensitive to it, then you might want to let them know. The sumeshi rice had good seasoning as well and right on consistency.

We also had a mike roll which I liked the crunch texture on, and a albacore roll which was also pretty good. The salmon skin handroll is one of my favorite things and there's was one of the best I've had. 

Service here was great. It was a slower late weeknight, but the sushi chef was very nice and attentive. Things just came in succession so we got in a lot of dishes in a short amount of time. The server kept out drinks filled and plates cleared.

I had just signed my check and was talking to my party when the waiter walks up and asked us to leave so he could seat other parties waiting at the door. When you go out to dinner you expect reasonable food and a relaxing evening. The staff was staring at us and circling us like vultures waiting for us to finish so they could hurry us out. It was the most tense and awkward night out in my life. There is a good sushi place right across the street with plenty of seating. Go there!

When comparing the local sushi restaurants on the west side of town and their AYCE quality/prices, Naka is by far the best. It's $21 for AYCE dinner, which most other places charge at least $25+, and the quality is amazing!! It's some of the best sushi I've ever had and the atmosphere is so nice. It's kind of like every server is your server, so whenever anyone sees that your table is empty or your glass needs refilling they will come over. It's pretty efficient despite sounding confusing. And it's ALWAYS packed! In my opinion, if you have to wait for a table at a sushi restaurant where there are tons of local regulars and a packed bar, you know that this place is worth giving a shot. There are a lot of items on the menu that I haven't tried, I generally stick to the individual sushi and a few rolls.

Some forces were trying to stop me (a nose that won't stop bleeding) but this place is highly rated so I wanted to give it a try. But I was rather disappointed. The rice seemed like it's been sitting there for a while. Although the fish was fresh, it was a bit thinly sliced.

We did AYCE for $19/person and we tried tuna and salmon nigiri, Naka Roll, Tracy II, LA Boxing, salmon skin handroll, agedashi tofu, calamari tempura, chicken tempura and shrimp tempura. For dessert, we got banana tempura and plum wine ice cream.

LA Boxing Roll:
Tuna, shrimp, avocado with salmon and lemon on top and ponzu sauce on the side. 

Naka Roll:
Soft-shell crab, crunch topped with smelt egg.

Tracy II Roll:
Salmon, jalape√±o, avocado with salmon and lemon on top. You might want to remove some of the jalape√±os in this roll. 

Salmon Skin Handroll:
The salmon skin was not crispy like it should be.

Calamari Tempura, Chicken Tempura, Shrimp Tempura:
Nothing to write home about.

I'm not sure I'll come back here. So, they have sashimi, soft-shell crab, uni, poke salad as part of their dinner AYCE for $22/person - I'll probably just go somewhere else for that especially if the experience I've had with the rice wasn't all that great.

It all started going south a few months ago when my scallop sushi order was drenched in lemon, not usually the case.  Much to my demise, the lemon was masking a really bad tasting piece of scallop, which in turn led to me being sick.  So, we stopped going for a few weeks, then started to go again, cautiously, progressing to almost weekly like we had before, noticing a slight decline in quality of fish.

Shortly after our return to patronage, we noticed that we were kind of being treated like we were less than favorable customers.  The main chef behind the sushi bar for which the place is named, Naka, wasn't interested in engaging in conversation like he had in the past, and was a bit stand-off-ish.  I will preface this last part by saying we would always call to make reservations to sit at the bar, and upon arriving, would be seated at a spot on the bar that was always labeled reserved and would have our names on a piece of paper with the reserved sign.  So we make our reservation, arrive to be shown to the bar where my name and phone number are on the piece of paper in the middle of the bar, great,,,, until Naka starts talking to the waitress who was seating us, in Japanese, to which she responds with hesitation and a look of confusion, then turns to us and says we can't sit here, but we could sit at the end of the bar next to the kitchen, and a dirty dish cart, and the bathrooms, to which I already know what it's like to sit in that cramped stinking area.  I say to her that my name is on that reservation here in the middle, which she relays to Naka in Japanese, and through her reluctant translation, she tells us that Naka wants that spot for someone else, which embarrassed the waitress to have to tell us that.  I refused the other seats that Naka wanted us to sit at, he never looked me in the eye to offer any explanation himself, which speaks volumes of him and the quality of his fish.  So, we told the waitress just to forget we came in, and we left.  10 minutes after we left, Nakas wife calls my phone as I'm driving, which I assume could only be to apologize for him, leaving a voicemail to call her back, but I'm not interested.  The food quality has slipped, his service has declined, and then we were treated like unwanted guests.  Just as well, I'll take my money elsewhere, as we've since found better AYCE, and will not be returning here.

The nigiri had way too much rice and the fish was way too small.  The service was good, but when you come for the food, it really doesn't make up for it.  My wife had the dinner and it looked more appetizing than my sushi!  I really liked the unagi which could have used a little more sauce on it but it was good.  The sashimi plate was also good but the beef tataki seemed like slivers of meat.  Wouldn't recommend the sushi but the dinner selections are numerous...",24-3ri7FV2rB22C9AhTwNA,0,0,3,kAtsrSTAFKxcELe-yDrPVw

We had ordered take out from here a couple of months ago and it was delicious so we returned for an AYCE sit-down dinner.  Our servers were so nice and accommodating; at one point, about halfway through the meal, they both noticed a large order of sashimi that had hardly been touched and asked if it was okay.  When I mentioned it was fine, just a little too much raw fish for the group, they offered to take it back to the kitchen and cook it all tempura-style for us.  They came back a few minutes later with the tempura fish piping hot and absolutely delicious.  It was gone in minutes!  The servers explained everything to us and brought us our food very quickly.  When they found out it was my daughter's birthday, they brought her a pretty fan at the end of the meal.  Upon entering and exiting the majority of the staff greets you and/or bids you farewell.  All the food we ate there was delicious, fresh, etc.  Can't think of much more to say...just go there and see for yourself how great it is!",gIcpEY34kKVvbHlQJcooQA,1,1,5,3jwGkyuoaCj-QnkmeaNXeA

Our recent visit, however, did not really leave a good impression. Rice portion to nigiri seemed to have increased as the cuts got thinner, sushi took longer to serve, and we had to constantly remind our waitress about the orders that were missing. Not only that, but our ice cream and mochi took more than 20 min, with two follow ups. When we finally got our ice cream, however, I got a crunchy surprise to my mango ice cream. Crunch? In ice cream? When I checked, oh I got a glittery surprise, chipped nail polish. Wow.",KdYcXLHmSBc5JJff1vF5wQ,5,1,1,-_Hgi6IwTf7VF1qcGyrzcg

I've never done the AYCE because I am generally full on a couple of rolls, and these do not disappoint!  Plus I have a couple of times shown up and ordered to-go on the spot, and I've waited only like 15 min for a delicious meal to take home and get some work done with.  I really enjoy their dinner specials!  Edamame, soup, salad, and two rolls for between $10-15 (depending on the rolls)?! Yes, please!!  The sushi is so fresh and delicious, and the mochi is also yummy.  And when you eat rolls incorrectly, they don't laugh at you, but instead kindly come correct you :D Soon after discovering Naka, we ate it three times in one week.

It's a small location in the corner of a strip mall but totally worth you checking out. Turns out it is run by the same guy who used to run Sushi Factory on S. Eastern which I used to go to regularly. 

The rolls are solid and the sashimi as well. I really wish this place wasn't so far from my house but alas, when I am in the area, I will definitely make it a point to stop by.",AwotTxzd_M5ZevluUUVkwQ,3,0,5,YWtq-UZnal__7MBvdsR2vA

I like this place because it's near my house and the staff are nice. I feel like it's a knock off version of Sushi Mon, but better at some aspects. Like the pricing is cheaper, and it's conveniently right there by Durango and Lakemead.

My favorite rolls are the Dragon Roll and the TED Roll. I recommend this place because of pricing and the sushi tastes pretty good. Water doesn't taste like sink water. They have green tea ice cream and mochi. The place is pretty good. The only thing that bugs me would be the size of the place. It's okay though since it's a newer business. It's worth my money and I'll definitely be coming back here.",hjnE7cS0fPLaXABVs9lMgg,1,1,5,HrDMFpao-VQVm0FPn88RVA

This is a new AYCE sushi joint that has popped up in Summerlin, and I am definitely a fan.  I usually avoid AYCE and order my favorite nigiri and sashimi items instead, but since my in-laws were visiting (and they looooove AYCE), I joined in on the gluttonous feast.  And at $21.95, how could I say no.  I started with the ""1 order per person"" section: uni, raw oysters, sweet shrimp, and the sashimi trio.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  So far, so good!  I also added 2 orders of agedashi tofu and a spicy tuna hand roll.  Topped it off with green tea ice cream and I was quite the happy camper. 

The rest of my family definitely took advantage of the AYCE, and ordered rolls, dynamite, salads, tempura, and sushi galore.  And they enjoyed every single bite.  Everything was delicious and the service was fabulous and very welcoming.  The owner, Mr. Nakamura, was even the one behind the sushi bar masterfully creating these tasty masterpieces.  And we learned that the chef in the kitchen serving up the warm dishes is also Japanese.   

I'm so glad that I took a chance on this new restaurant because now I know where to go when I need to satisfy that sushi craving.  And with Lent in full swing, you can bet that we will be regulars!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,3,2,4,oVaCnH5NVL59JsZSd3N3Ow
