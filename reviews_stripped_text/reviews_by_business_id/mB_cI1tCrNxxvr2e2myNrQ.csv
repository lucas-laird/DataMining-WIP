When the purse was ""miraculously"" found by the security guard 20 minutes later in the men's bathroom trash can (of course the one place I couldn't look), the entire Taco Bell staff looked at us like we were diseased when we walked in, while the manager stared at us from the corner texting on his phone.

FOOD: The food is exactly the same as you would buy it at any other Taco Bell. Only difference is the food is served in a tray instead of a bag. If you are as crazy about Taco Bell as me, then you now have a little fancier Taco Bell to hang out at.

DRINK: Have no fear, you can now enjoy your tacos with a nice beer. The beer here is really cool to watch them fill up. The beer cup is place on the dispenser and the beer will actually fill from the bottom up. A nice souvenir magnet is placed at the bottom of the cup to serve the beer. Even ""cooler,"" you can now get an array of Taco Bell Freezes with alcohol. Yes, Baja Blast with Bacardi is a thing! If you don't want alcohol, the freezes can be made virgin or you can get a drink from their unique sodas on tap fountain.

ATMOSPHERE: The counter where you order is where the magic happens. The freezes are in the Taco Bell sign behind the counter each representing a different letter. There is a sode blubbler above the counter that is mesmerizing to look at. They have Taco Bell merch in the place for you to show your Taco Bell spirit. There is seating outside on the patio or upstairs. They have large TVs so yes, you can eat Taco Bell, drink beer, and watch the game;)

Overall, it's not as special as everyone makes it. It's a little inconvenient to make your way here just for Taco Bell. It's a cool concept and definitely worth a try, but in the end, it's just eating Taco Bell food that you can get anywhere else.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,10,13,4,-bJG0qYTzceR7H0tgBtLrA

Taco Bell is already like the go-to spot for drunk munchies (besides any Mexican spot with Carne Asada Fries) so of course it's bomb! It's cool how they have alcoholic frozen drinks like Margaritas and Piña Coladas plus beer on tap! The food menu is pretty much the same but maybe a bit more expensive. Weddings are on the menu as well for $600 if I remember correctly (hey it's Vegas right?!). There's also a bunch of TVs playing sports and a DJ mixing it up on the second floor. 

Food was good and pretty much tastes the same as TBs elsewhere. The drinks were delicious but weak; couldn't taste the alcohol which could either be a good or dangerous thing.

When you walk in, you might be a little impressed by the cool decor and the cool alcoholic freeze drinks they have, but once you order food you'll see how they really screwed up their process. Walking in, it's not clear how many lines there are. Although you may be quick to order food, a huge crowd forms waiting for their order. They have a screen that shows names of people who have ordered but the food is in the process of being made and then another list of people whose food is ready. It says it's ready but it's really not. The service looks chaotic. They have a clear glass so you can see them working and constructing your order but they do it out of order and they can't get their orders straight. They mess up orders and then are rude about it when you point out something is missing or that an order was made incorrectly. They write your name on the paper bag but when you go to accept it, they don't trust you and won't give it to you unless you have your receipt. We went late at night on Saturday after going out, and I understand everyone has the munchies and is a little unkind because of all the drinking but even at 3am, I'd like the level of service I expect during any other time of the day. 

It's just disappointing to see a brand new place have such terrible processes in place, it just doesn't make sense and is unorganized.

Turns out that this location was the first and is still one of the very few to actually serve alcoholic slushies, which is something that I didn't find out until many miles, conceding non-alcoholic slushies, and months later. So, yeah, just added it to the list of places to try on my next Vegas trip. 

My visit to this Taco Bell Cantina (TBC) was in August of last year (2017), and I wasn't expecting much. A tourist trap, at best. I assumed the slushies would be watered down, and that the food would be average, if not sub-par. I assumed heckin' w r o n g.

We pulled up to the club after a long day of eating and a long night of drinking, the club being TBC. Although we spent literally every moment of the day where we weren't walking, eating, we were still hungry for some Taco Bell. Not too much Taco Bell, tho.

The first thing we (and probably everyone else, too) noticed was the wall of slushies behind the registers. Basically they have all of their regular slush options with various kinds of alcohol (rum, vodka, tequila, etc.) I don't care if you're 5, 95, or Mormon, your eyes shoot straight to this wall when you come in.

I got the Baja blast with whatever alcohol it came with, and my friend got the cherry one with whatever alcohol it came with (sorry, can't remember). They were good, totally not watered down, though overpriced for Taco Bell...though not overpriced for blended alcoholic beverages on the Las Vegas Strip. 

We also settled on eating the naked chicken chips and the potato-rito. We had never had the chips before, but we had heard a lot about them and seen many advertisements. Honestly, they were overhyped. Not bad, just not anything to get excited about. The burrito was just average.

One of the cool things about this location, aside from it being on the friggen Vegas Strip, is that it has a patio-ish room where you can sit in open air and watch/interact with the Strip tourists. No, it's not advertised that way, but you create your own destiny.

Although the service wasn't anything special in terms of friendliness, I give this place four stars and remember the experience as a good one not just because I was drunk (and they provided me with more alcohol), but because the place was extremely clean and they were serving a high quantity of customers fairly quickly.

Really?

It's Taco Bell.
Yes, it sometimes hits the spot, but to add hip hop music and alcoholic slushies to make it 'Vegas-ified' does not warrant it more stars.  And why am I paying so much for a freaking taco?  Just because I'm in Vegas?  Screw that, if I'm overpaying it's for something unique and amazing, not something I can get at my local drive-thru.

We went here around 2am on a Sunday morning, because...obviously.
Long lines, it moved slow, the music was loud, people were drunk...actually come to think of it, it's a lot like most Taco Bells normally are.  ;)

The staff was nice, the food came out at a good pace.
They pulled all of the hot sauce trays so we couldn't get any which was a bummer.
There is a big window where you can look in and see everyone in the kitchen making the orders which is cool.

Lots of alcohol slush drinks, pina colada, baja blast, cherry, etc.  That seems cool, though I didn't get any.

We sat outside in the covered patio, plenty of music still booming.

You walk in, greeted by a wall of Freeze.  Plenty of different flavors, alcohol mixed in if you would like as well.  You can buy Taco Bell merchandise, shirts, swimsuits, and other items for the true Taco Bell fan.  Music is pumping fairly loudly the entire time due to the DJ upstairs.  While that makes it a little hard to hear, it's unique and fun.

The menu is the same as it is everywhere, as far as I could tell.  Prices are too.  I went with a $5 BIG BOX.  That included a normal taco, Cheesy Gordita Crunch, Burrito Supreme, nachos, and a drink.  I had them sub the drink for a Baja Blast Freeze.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure what that did to the overall price, but it wasn't much.

Then you get to wait for your food, listening to the music and browsing the merchandise.  You can also look through the window to the kitchen and watch people make your food five feet and a glass panel away from you.  This was actually pretty interesting and fun to see.  You can see your name on the order screen and watch it make its way up the the line until they start making it.  

The food was Taco Bell.  We ate upstairs and enjoyed the people watching from on high.  It was also around 1 AM.  These guys are open 24 hours a day, which is perfect for a late night meal after being out late.

It's pretty cool that you can get alcohol with your Baja Freeze, but what's not cool is paying $27 for it. 

The order line situation in this establishment is highly inefficient. There really is no natural flow of traffic-- just cashiers yelling on the top of their lungs ""NEXT NEXT I CAN HELP YOU HERE"" while flailing their limbs around. 

From the videos I've seen online, they made it seem like this place was MASSIVE, but really a local Taco Bell in your neighborhood would probably be 3 times as big as this special one.

Although Taco bell is not of my one regular fast food picks, on NYE I decided to check out the ""upscale version"".

This taco bell has a standard menu plus tapas-style sharing plates of nachos, quesadillas, and chicken fingers.The cantina's ""Freeze Wall"" of customizable slushies includes flavors margarita, piña colada, berry blast and provide the option to add liquor: tequila, rum, vodka.

Atmosphere: Space is tight. Given on NYE they hosted an event on the upper level, seating was not available & it was standing room only. We managed to grab a standing spot right in front of the window that looks into the kitchen. It may have been because of NYE, but the music was very loud. Club loud..which is great, when you're at a club. However, the loud music made it extremely difficult to order and respond to the cashier.

Order: Decided to try the baja blast freeze with vodka...intending to just try it in their standard cup. As a local, i don't need the gimicky souvenir twist cups. Unfortunately, with the loud music and lack of clarification by the cashier, we ended up with their souvenir twist cups (and their additional cost).

Service: I spotted an employee carrying a tablet, but noticed that she skipped over me to ask another person ( 2 people behind me) if they wanted to place their order thru the tablet. I feel that the error with my drinks would not have been made if I had tablet ordered & saw it on the screen as opposed to attempting to lip read the cashier.

Delivery: Your name will appear on the TV screen when your order is ready. When I saw my name under the ""Ready"" side, I maneuvered up to the crowded counter, only to be told that my order was not ready. Standing back a bit, they called my name a few moments later & handed me a bag of food. Opened the bag...to find that it was NOT what I had ordered. We ordered 3 $5 Cravings boxes..My sister returned the bag with someone else's order and we were given our 3 boxes.

Really though it's just your typical Taco Bell food, nothing fancy. Don't remember if they bumped the prices up cause it's on the Strip. They have beer and frozen drinks (alcoholic or non). Soft drinks on tap. And you can buy Taco Bell merchandise. 

After you order your name shows up on a list on the wall. Pay attention cause someone might jack your food, yes it happened.

I received my food around 4:00am and my friend should have received her food shortly after. That did not happen. Politely, around 4:10a, we asked the status of her order. I said, ""Ma'am we place our orders relatively around the same time, my friends food should have been out by now."" Rudely, the cashier said well everybody is waiting so just wait. I explained how close we ordered and she went to say, well food comes in different lines and different lines get the orders at different times. I was trying to explain that even so, over 6 ppl got their food after we ordered, but she wasn't trying to listen. Both the shift lead and the cashier just brushed the situation off. Mind you, it had already been over 20mins. The place was chaos. So we waited and it became around 4:25, the lady finally looks our receipt and makes this face and then told us that someone ""got her food accidentally"".

I honestly never thought I'd give a review for a Taco Bell since you pretty much know what you're getting when you go to Taco Bell. Taco Bell is pretty straight forward but like I said with all the hype I had to try this place out. 

So the selling point of this place for me isn't even how futuristic and cool it looks. It's actually the price which for a college student like me is a great thing, I ate a nice meal, drink, and got a freeze for 10 bucks. 

The food was also surprisingly delicious and well made. It did not taste like fast food at all and was really good for such a decent price. The only time this restaurant does get expensive is with the ""twisted"" freezes which is basically just a shot of alcohol into whatever flavor of freeze you want. The prices for the Twisted Freezes are very touristy and truth be told for what you get it's not worth it to me. The alcohol choices for your ""twisted"" freeze is kind of limited. It's basically vodka, rum, or tequila and it's really generic stuff like Bacardi.  

They do have a ton of freeze flavors which I really like including some old classics like Baja Blast along with the new ones and the freezes are pretty cheap around 4 bucks (without alcohol). The biggest letdown to the Cantina though is actually the size, now it's not enough to warrant a star deduction but the place is small. It doesn't have downstairs indoor seating at all, the downstairs seating is actually on a patio outside which is heated and cooled though. The upstairs seating is really nice with plush chairs and booths along with massive flat screen tvs but the seating upstairs is limited. If the place is packed good luck getting a seat especially if you have a group with you. 

All in all I really love the Taco Bell Cantina and will definitely be back especially if i'm on the strip. It's a nice and cheap place for locals and tourists to eat without breaking the bank and it's got a great atmosphere. The bubbling freeze tanks make me feel i'm in a cantina in a galaxy far far away which I really like and the plush seating upstairs is sick.

Initially came here to drink and eat Taco Bell in the middle of the night like everyone else who comes to Vegas. 

I had higher expectations for my experience here, but was sadly disappointed. Someone ordered a bunch of food ahead of me, made some upgrades and then decided to remove items--this caused the one open register to freeze. Unfortunately, it took the staff a while to just open another till. It would have been convenient earlier to open more registers for the amount of staff they had and to notify the long line that there were issues with that one register. By the time I ordered I just wanted food. So, I can't say much about their speciality drinks! Maybe next time.

Also, I didn't like that I was able to see how they prepared food. Kitchen staff didn't put the wrap paper down on the countertops before making the food.

--LOCATION-- On the strip, near/ at Planet Hollywood. You can access the Taco Bell from the sidewalk. No need to go through the hotel. 

--FOOD-- Same food as any other Taco Bell, although it seemed like a whole new world to me since I haven't stepped into one in ages. 

Alcoholic slushees: Bomb. I got the Baja Blast with vodka. Other friends got the Baja Blast with tequila. You can taste the tequila more. The vodka one is way subtler, if not even noticeable. It's a little dangerous because it tastes like candy. 

Fiery Doritos Locos Tacos: Pretty good. Dusty from the Dorito-ness powder.

Crunchwrap: Pretty darn good. Good amount of sauce and filling. 

--EXPERIENCE-- Taco Bell did a good job. It's a brilliant idea since most people are going to be drunk AF and will get even drunker. Even if the food may have been the same as anywhere else, it pretty much is the perfect drunk experience. People with the munchies are going to go ham here. 

--AESTHETICS-- It's nice a new. It is 2 stories and outside seating. The stairs leading upstairs is rather narrow. Outside seating is better and less claustrophobic. However, I went in the winter, so we went upstairs. If you're too drunk, the stairs may be a problem ): 

Also, there's hella merchandise just sitting in front of the cash registers. This was disruptive and annoying. Line formation was a struggle. Overall too small and narrow for a popular spot.",xC9Tycwaf0D45g2n0wBcSw,0,1,4,LXiegN7CyYSrLAZITGmJkQ

Atmosphere: Poppin'!
This is the most lively, colorful, engaging, and almost attractive Taco Bell you will ever go to. There was litter on the ground when I entered, but that's a quality shared with all of the places on the Las Vegas Strip. There are two levels to this Taco Bell, so you can eat inside, or looking down from above next to a giant television.

Service: Quick!
There is a ticket system that calls you up when your order is ready. They were very fast with my order.

Food: It's definitely Taco Bell.
So what do I mean when I say, ""It's definitely Taco Bell""? Typical ""Mexican""-inspired fast food with an American twist. Nothing special. But the chicken chalupas that were on the menu at the time were definitely something special! Also, they serve alcohol here.

Summary: A great experience for a fast food joint

First of all, it's located in a little strip mall area by Planet Hollywood. It's right off the strip. We came here after we were at Marquee. It was freezing and made that made dash across the street!

This taco bell looks like a club.  There was actually a bouncer outside. It's got a really cool vibe and ambiance on the inside. It's two levels, but smaller than I had expected.  You order on the first floor and there's some seating on the second level.  It wasn't packed when we got there and didn't have to wait for that long. 

The alcohol they serve is is slushy form and is not good. It was way too sweet and I love sweet. I was expecting this to be way better.

It's one of the first places that we visited on The Strip the first time that we came to Las Vegas, and it's a blast every single time!  It's open late, and is always full of people, and has music blasting at all hours!  

The interior feels almost like a club, with colorful, bubbly water tanks above the different slush and alcohol dispensers, a dim ambience, loud club music, and an amazing upstairs loft area!  The main seating downstairs is the patio outside, which has a fun vibe and is good for people watching, but my favorite spot to sit is in one of the comfortable booths in the loft upstairs!

I love coming here and just sharing a huge plate of crunchy taco supreme's and getting one of the big slush drinks with vodka in it!

Not much in the way of seating and..it might hold half to a third as many people as a regular TB. Price-wise we knew it would be higher but it was nearly $30.00 for two trim adults and a small child. Since we paid that much for the food, I didn't think it would be a problem to ask for some water cups. Nope. Your option is buy the pricey bottled water (of course it is). One of the biggest turnoff was the loud clubby music...it wasn't very busy on a Thursday night but you still had to almost yell to hear the other person speak. Of course the place is on the strip so getting their requires you to park at a casino and walk it...not really a fault of the restaurant. The food is in baskets but they make them less convenient to eat out of (in some cases) than the regular taco bell paper dishes so the novelty of the dollar store dinnerware wears off in about 5 seconds. They do have a ""gift shop"" but it's really just a couple of tshirts and a hat or two. 

We do enjoy Taco Bell but this place functions more as brand building ad space than as a place to eat. If you like Taco Bell but wish it were much more expensive, much louder and with poorer seating options, I guess this would be the best place.

This place was a lifesaver in Vegas as it allowed us to save so much on food when we were running over budget at the end of our trip. Heineken was under $6. A cravings deal was $5.99. We could get a complete and delicious meal, er, maybe not complete, but completely delicious, for about $15-$20 per person, including a beer. 

They were blasting hip hop on the top floor where we sat on one visit. They also had some tvs showing various sporting competitions. On our next visit, we sat on the little outdoor patio. The seating here was a little cramped, but it made for great people watching of folks walking the Strip.

You can also get married here for very little $. The wedding in package includes a bunch of tacos and a hot sauce garter belt! 

Staff was friendly on all our visits and I was very pleased when a chick agreed to serve me a beer even though I didn't have my license- had left it in a different bag at the hotel. I am so obviously over 21- I even showed her my grey hairs- so this was much appreciated! 

They take cards. It was happy. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip!

Price wise looks a little more expensive, I got the $5 meal box (the menu says limited time) so the price might only be for the grand opening, but it's on the strip so that's normal. Soda is on tap, same as normal fountain drinks but pours slower. Be careful topping off as they have a little burst when you first pull the the tap.

There is a Taco Bell (Cantina!) though, and growing up in Northern California, I have an affinity to Taco Bell vs. Del Taco.

Generally speaking, 24 hour Taco Bell.  Prices similar to off strip, and they serve Frozen Alcoholic beverages.  DJ Spins music upstairs, and the place is packed. Those workers are mad efficient too, they just be cranking out orders non-stop!

They have naked chicken chips ($5)! And fun apps like cheesy jalapeño dippers and little quesadilla bites. Probably not worth it but you can't get them anywhere else. The $ menu here is more expensive than other places, about $1.20-$1.40. 

Also the cravings deal here comes with chips and cheese and not the gross cinnamon twists! Plus they grilled my burritos without me even asking.

Sodas are served through taps which is cool and there's a huge array of different slushies, all of which you can order with alcohol. The food menu is the same, nothing fancier or unique. You can watch your food being prepared which may interest some. 

For a late night cheap snack on the strip, I would choose the Cantina as my spot, but nothing more than that.",T9WkOx1h6EvgFEg8kM2aMw,2,2,4,aRM_s70WQv13py4ZtNgeuw

First and foremost they have frozen Baja Blast featuring your favorite liquors: tequila or vodka. Your choice my friend, choose wisely. A cup of frozen Baja Blast will set you back $10, but worth every (insert which President is on that bill because honestly, at the moment, I can't remember).

The atmosphere here is much better than any other T. Bell you'll go to. It's got music playing, like fun club music, not boring muzak-type music. It's got two floors and features outdoor seating. It's got this lounge vibe, but really you're lounging with your gordita.

You can buy merchandise here! I mean, they have these taco hats and boxer shorts. Things you totally do not need, but when in Vegas and when the alcohol takes over your system, you just might buy it.

The pricing is still on brand. Being in Vegas, things can get rather expensive, but hey, Taco Bell is here for you.

In the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, Taco Bell Cantina is the soul of the new Taco. Opened in the same time frame of the Taco Bell logo refresh on November 14, 2016; this has the honor of being the first flagship Taco Bell in addition to being the first Taco Bell with a gift shop. This is Taco Bell's CMO Maria Thalberg's take on the first flagship Taco Bell,

""This flagship restaurant is our ultimate expression of the Taco Bell brand, and lifestyle.""

The way I see it, the first flagship Taco Bell is likewise the ultimate expression of the Las Vegas brand, and lifestyle. First off, it serves booze. Second off it is open 24/7. Third, it is large and modern. If I am not mistaken this is one of the few if not the only two-floor Taco Bell. In Las Vegas style, it incorporates a VIP lounge and DJ booth. And in millennium fashion, it incorpatrs the aspects of a modern restaurant. Fronting the restaurant, which by the way is formerly a pizza place, is a patio. The patio is equipped with misters for cooling off in the brutal summer weather, coverings, and LED lighting. In addition to outside patio seating the second-floor mezzanine has sufficient seating overlooking a 16 screen television system. Below the mezzanine and in back of the patio is the modern lobby that includes the gift shop, open kitchen, and order counter with digital menu boards.

Taco Bell has a reputation as hangover food. However at the flagship Taco Bell, customers can drink alcohol prior to the hangover. This Taco Bell is all about drinking and eating. In reality it is a Taco Bell Cantina. In addition to being the first flagship and 7,000th Taco Bell, it is the fourth Taco Bell Cantina. Right where you order below the digital menu boards is the alcohol. The alcohol of choice are beer on tap and twisted freezes. The twisted freezes allow for some creativity. Customers can add vodka, tequila, or rum to any of the eight flavor bases. The customer can order the drink in two different sized souvenir cups. 

It was on Christmas Day, 2017 when I stopped here for lunch. This was my first visit to a Taco Bell since June, 2013. With so many Christmas decorated hotels & attractions to see and work the next morning, I wanted something fast and inexpensive. In my opinion any meal less than $10 on the Strip is inexpensive. For approximately $8, I ordered the Nacho Bell Grande meal that included a Taco and 32 ounce drink. Paying little heed to the alcohol drinks in front of me, I headed to the caffeinated drinks in back of me. They were Pepsi beverages. After the meal the 32 ounce refill came to good use on my continued travels along the Strip. Back to the food. In my opinion it was filling and pretty good.

Generally speaking I was satisfied with the friendly customer service, atmosphere, selection and food. My one complaint is that the letter fonts on the menu boards are far too tiny. You shouldn't need 2020 vision to order fast food. In contrast to the conclusion of my last Taco Bell review, I will end this one by saying that, ""I will no longer run to the border before I return to a Taco Bell."" The first flagship Taco Bell restaurant has changed my opinion of Taco Bell for the better. There is an 80 percent return factor.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,12,3,du6UVIJMo7aMAhPdXA5Hyw

Being from Arizona where it's illegal to not serve tap water for free, I was confused by this and tried to clarify why there wasn't any water.

4718765,2016-12-03,1,mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ,"24/7 Taco Bell with alcohol? Is this real life??? When in Vegas, you just have to come here because where else in the country can you get Taco Bell and alcohol at the same time ! I was super keen on coming here after seeing so many videos of it on Facebook and honestly I thought it was worth it.

Obviously the food is literally exactly the same that you would get in a normal taco bell and there's nothing special about it. But why change the food? That's exactly the food I go to taco bell for. If you change the food, it's no longer taco bell. 

Inside there are these really cool lights and bubbly lit tubes going down on the menu over the cash registers. It's full of cool lights and there's a bunch of seating both inside and outside. It's basically a flashier version of Taco Bell that you would expect to see in Vegas. If you're a true taco bell fan, you can even buy souvenirs inside. The biggest con is the amount of people here and the line felt incredibly slow moving. 

As far as the alcohol, you can pick from beer, wine, or the freezes which is basically the taco bell slushies with alcohol mixed in them. I would totally recommend the freezes since beer and wine you can get anywhere else. The baja blast freeze with bacardi was worth every ounce of sugar. 

All in all, it's taco bell with alcohol so don't expect anything more then that. Not really sure why there are so many negative reviews of people having higher expectations. But to me, that combination alone totally makes it worth a visit and it's something you just have to experience when in Vegas even if it's just for the snapchat. The fact that it's open 24/7 makes it the prime spot to go to after a long night of clubbing and I highly recommend.",GX9iSyZ9JdJBW6Owxqbb0w,1,0,4,wWD6Er8julPxIop9vnBHDA

I came here mid-morning and the place was busy, but not too busy. They have inside seating but it's upstairs and they also have outside seating on the covered porch. I always enjoy eating outdoors, so this was a very nice treat. 

The guy at the register was very friendly and took my order quickly. I decided on the naked egg taco bundle that came with two tacos made of egg (the shell part) potatoes, bacon, cheese both shredded and nacho cheese sauce.  This was my first time trying this and it was surprisingly better then I expected. I would definitely order it again. This cost $3.49.

As I waited for my food to come out, I looked over the menu and saw that most of the items weren't much more than off the strip. This is a great thing for those that don't want to spend a lot of money on something quick. 

This Taco Bell offers alcoholic drinks as well as clothing items. Not sure I'd ever buy any clothing items with taco bell on it, but if you're into stuff like that, they offer it here. 

When you place an order, your order is displayed on a digital screen. This is a nice feature so you can see when your order is ready without having to listen to your number.

This is definitely one of the two visits this year for me. The best part about this Taco Bell is that it's located in Las Vegas and is a Cantina which means thy sell alcohol :) and they have a live DJ with club lights.

Walking in the location definitely had a great live atmosphere. It had bright eye catching colors and lively welcoming music.

As I waited in line I got to talking to a couple of men about how awesome this place was to only find out they were the owners/investors (explained why they were in suites and ties) They gave me a bigger picture of the plans for the next couple of days and invited me to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor was still being worked on, but it will also offer seating and people will be able to order food and drinks as well.

At least that's what it looked like on the video that was going around on facebook. Maybe I just over hyped it to myself. But it's not bad for what it is.

It's located on the side of Planet Hollywood, across from the Cosmo. Really easy to find. There is the typically menu here, plus some 'shareable' plates. at various valued prices. Got the bacon  potatoes and the jalapeno dippers. Really yummy and they were decent sized too! 

So I thought there would be a DJ or something, I thought I saw that in the video, but maybe it was just for the grand opening? But it's just loud speakers playing top 40; at least when my party was there. The alcohol situation is limited to beer and/or a shot in their freezes. $5 for the add shot though. Comes in a souvenir container. The one my friend got wasn't mixed up all the way so you got all the vodka first than the freeze after. 

VERY limited seating. The upstairs holds a one stall bathroom (!!!!) and about 6/7 tables and some bar stools. There's also seating in their outside patios, but if the heaters aren't on, than yall freezing! 

I don't like that you don't get a tray to carry your food when they call your name. Also they don't check numbers/receipt, just on the good faith that its your name they called because there happened to be TWO other Vivian's there at the same time I was. My order was called first and they were arguing with Vivian #2l who said that wasn't what she ordered. I had to fight the crowds to get up there and tell them I am also Vivian! Also I ordered 3 different things cause I was splitting with my boyfriend, and they were like ""you ordered ALL these?!"" And I'm like yes I did. Manager, ""are you sure?"" Yes here's my receipt ""So you ordered all this??"" YES CHECK MY RECEIPT!  I don't think he believed me though =T So without a tray, I had to do a very delicate balancing act through all the people to get back to my table. 

So if you were looking for some sorta cheap food on the strip, especially late at night, it's worth it. But it's definitely not as cool as it seemed on the facebook marketing video.",iFiE43elVlV3Z3uk5_eIXg,1,0,4,5-qs-5DrjeI09xArn4cLAw

I gotta admit. I LOVE the TB. It's definitely my guilty pleasure. So when a friend told me about the Taco Bell on the Strip, I made it a point to stop by. The location is pretty central and easy to get to.

They offer the normal menu, but they also have an added small plate menu, which can only be found at these Cantinas. Of the small plates, we tried the 7 Layer Dip and the Spicy Ranch Smothered Potatoes. If you ever tried the potato loaded griller, it's the same potatoes. They tasted just like loaded potatoes and were delicious. The seven layer dip was similar to that of the kind you'd make at home, but they were chinsy with the chips. Of course we obliged in the $10 vodka Baja Blast freezes, which was what made the check so expensive.

Was it amazing? I don't know. The food tasted good and it was a fun experience. I wanted to buy a taco shirt, but my husband wouldn't let me. He's like ""are you really going to wear a Taco Bell shirt"" UM YEAH.",3wDRFdjpeq36Es97Zj2iVw,4,1,4,V6a_DsgmxkWpGpY_G6qqsQ

Also, this Taco Bell is open 24 hrs and has a DJ on the upper deck playing a variety of different hits and genres. This was a really unique Taco Bell and hey who doesn't like alcohol with their Mountain Dew Baja Blast and some good music too?!

No name tags on either ""upper management"" team that she spoke to. Finally one of them told her what the real issue was and that no one really complains about it. 
He avoided giving a refund and didn't offer a slushy for guest satisfaction. 
I hate to say this comment because I've heard it many times but as management in the food and ever age business you give the guest what they want or the alternative to make their experience a little better. This guy finally caved and gave my friend $1 from his own wallet.

5430224,2017-05-14,8,mB_cI1tCrNxxvr2e2myNrQ,"Yo if you love Taco Bell as much as I do, then this is A MUST for every Vegas trip!

First of all, the cantina is way more hyped on the commercials than it actually is. The cantina is really just a small shop with limited patio seating. However, it makes up for it with the retail and *alcoholic* beverage options.

RETAIL
If you so choose, you can purchase taco trunks, taco bikinis, Taco Bell beach towels, sweaters, hats, and more. The pricing is pretty steep, about $30+ depending on what you get. The shot glasses themselves are $10 each but come in a cute variety of colors. I didn't end up buying anything this time but who knows, maybe I just might later on. 

FOOD
You'll get your typical Taco Bell menu here. From what I remember, their dollar menu doesn't exist here but I could be wrong. 

DRINKS
This is where the fun begins. To start, their soda fountains are made to look like beer taps. How adorable! Next, they have a much wider range of alcoholic freezes to choose from. Their ever so popular Mountain Dew Baja blast comes as a non-alcoholic and alcoholic option: if you choose the adult version you can get it in a regular size ($10), a yard size ($15--worth it considering size), with your choice of 1800 tequila, Captain Morgan rum, and Skyy Vodka. Any additional shots will cost you $2.

Overall, I enjoyed coming here and do plan on coming back. I didn't get to see if they had a refill option for the yard cups and I know that very few places that sell similar drinks will likely refill it, but you can always try out for yourself.",HQnfONrTQKBdHPV7iebtxQ,12,10,4,G9O6bnzCZWJ8SXQc4glsqQ

After walking through the outside seating, the automatic door opens and 2016 hip hop music was blasting. There were some fixtures of merchandise and a security guard was closely standing by supervising the area. 

I'm not going to lie when I say it looked a lot smaller than what it seemed to be however the taco bell ordering counter looks super cool with the lights and the different lighted liquid tubes. Boyfriend treated us to a pina colada with tequila along with a beefy fritos burrito for me and a taco for himself. Food was done not too long after because it's fast food.

Not 100% sure what to expect, while killing alot of time before a show, I found my way over there and decided to check it out. It's over by the Paris Casino, I took some photos of the Eiffel tower next to that big blue balloon while walking here. 
     Once you're in the area, it's not hard to find. Listen to the ridiculously loud thumping club music. There are a couple of 'fancy' restaurants over here. There's a Bubba Gumps nearby, and Gordon Ramsey also has a place nearby. There are also some fast food places here, there's a Mcdonalds, a Subway, a Krispy Kreme...and this place.
    It's actually a pretty small space. Pretty much your standard Taco Bell sized place. But it surely throws a big aura. Loud thumping club music blares from their patio area. There's a great big swirling machine with flashing lights behind the cash registers and employees. 
     The menu is pretty standard, except you can get alcohol here. The big swirling lighted machines behind the registers are dispensing alcoholic slushies. Much like the kind you get at other places on the strip. After looking up and the menu board, I settled upon a quesadilla and a beer. Girl behind the counter was nice and friendly as she took my order. 
     She popped an empty cup on the counter and beer swirled up into it. From the Bottom. The cups are bottom fed. That's nutty. I think that wowed me more than the whole place. But ya. Alcohol. Taco Bell. Music. That's pretty much it. But it's really neat. You should go check it out if you're looking for the weird and wacky in Las Vegas.
     There's an upper floor, but it was cordoned off on my visit because people were getting married up there. Ya. People get married at a Taco Bell. In Las Vegas. Man. With each discovery like this I kinda like this city more and more.",43WiflwfTbmjizIfxvQ_jw,0,1,4,6f5L7SCqQ4AIkHMTK-JT1A

You're still gonna get your staple cheesy gordita crunch and chalupas and all that jazz. But one thing that sets this Taco Bell apart from others (besides the name) are the drinks. 

Yeah, you don't need a PHD in Taco-ology to figure out what I'm talking about here. You want a frozen drink? Sure. You want it with a little extra kick? Well now you're talkin'! 

The females of my family heard about this not-so-ordinary T-Bell before our Vegas trip and after flying in late to Sin City, we made this our first stop for food. But again, it was more for the drinks. 

I mean a frozen Baja Blast is good on its own, but when you add rum to the thing? Woah. And you could get it with said liquor or choose vodka, whiskey, or even tequila. Nice. Very nice. Beyond that it's basically nothing special (service was friendly though) outside of a pretty well-themed, contemporary-style Taco Bell complete with taco hats for purchase, of course....

It's nice on the outside-has outdoor seating for the warmer temps or for those who just want to be outside. When you walk in, you are immediately immersed in THE loudest music you will ever hear. Being in a club was quieter than that music. I had to yell at the cashier so they could hear my order. There were some merchandise racks that you could buy Taco Bell shirts, etc. A cool option at this place is alcoholic freezes, which are moderately expensive but not bad for Vegas price. The food itself is relatively cheap-I got two quesadillas and a medium drink for $11...and it was super good. There's an upstairs area with different seating arrangements and a live DJ. Overall it was definitely worth going to, but the only complaint is that the music was too loud!",65taQ9qUPmO6uEBnAzt1oQ,0,0,4,fWcrPjeOV9Y_EogMKfXL2A

Items ordered: 2 Doritos locos tacos, and a jack and coke slurpee! 

This Taco Bell is hip and just so cool! It's has an outdoor patio with great views! The atmosphere is different than any other Taco Bell. Since it's considered a Catina they have alcoholic beverages available. They even carry some fun Taco Bell clothing items! 

Overall, fun experience. The slurpee with alcohol was $20! Worth it in vegas!",fxcyt4lx9XDgTPoAwW7roQ,5,6,4,hjmj8GDqWcwol03B5aLrVw

They are just a few cents more than what I normally pay which is great when your spending elsewhere. And did I mention the ALCOHOL! We got a pina colada with rum! This was actually the best pinacolada I have ever had too! There are other flavors of slushies and alcohols you can choose from as well! Wanting to get hitched? Well theres and upstairs to this Cantina where the mood is set and after you tie the knot you can stuff your face with tacos. I mean sounds like a dream wedding right?!,CRNC0W8VbA2NGKtJrAzNrw,1,1,5,TkPbZMJ5iLU0Is6MtXxB2Q

Some tourists occasionally wandered into the place to get food and got theirs before me - even though I ordered a standard burrito. Burrito was (when I eventually got it) regular old Taco Bell - tortilla somewhat dry and old. Don't bother.

My cashier got my order wrong, which wasn't a big problem because I love Taco Bell and it was a slight error. What really put me off was the staff hanging out on the side with their manager (that's how it appeared) messing around. Just standing there I could tell that they've probably never worked in a high volume kitchen situation. Example, the girl doing the drink orders didn't get her ticket for my drink because the cashier had no idea she was supposed to print it and hand it off to her. 

I know you guys are new, but you are also on the strip. I will be back because I have faith ya'll will get it together.",rJMIama58eWH9kpkBZPkBA,2,1,3,9aIOkmYkJGZhvltiSxs3Dg

Food looks the same too, no special treatment here.  I do enjoy their frozen slush drinks though,  I got my hands on a free lemon slush which was a great treat but wish I could have tried the baja blast.  Unfortunately since there's hardly any space it gets crowded fast (with merchandise taking up the full middle of the storefront).

I walked across the strip and found Taco Bell Cantina around Planet Hollywood, located right next to McDonald's, ironically. However, despite the hype it is just Taco Bell at the end of the day - with the addition of alcoholic beverages. 

You can expect it to be extremely crowded, although I can assume this will somewhat die down when the initial excitement wears off. There is seating upstairs and downstairs and after you wait in one of the lines that stretch across downstairs, orders are called out from the counter. For how busy it is, the orders don't take too long - but they did run out of every hot sauce except mild. The staff are all friendly and helpful, especially for dealing with all of the drunk people and such a consistent amount of orders. Nothing bad about it other than how busy it is - it just isn't as touristy as you would expect it to be. Convenient if you have some Taco Bell munchies and want an alcoholic slushy!",N2h_tu44NenrJSSiWJ6Yhw,1,0,3,5TV4kDOxT2Pt1Y-CUd9Y7A

Taco Bell, although not good for you, is actually delicious to my little belly. I grew up on Taco Bell. I remember walking to the nearest one near school and getting tacos and burritos galore. Ever since I heard this one was opening at the planet hollywood and WITH alcohol I really wanted to check it out! Finally, cinco de mayo gave me an opportunity to try out what I've been missing. Because it was a special occasion, there was a DJ blasting music, GOOD music, making you wanna dance, and it lured us in. The girls were walking around selling tequila shots! It felt like a mini club! But with hella cheap food. The price is the same on the menu as it would be off the strip and that's what I love so much. They have all the different slushee drink flavors that you can choose from and have it with or without alcohol. We ordered two shots, a margarita slushee, a taco supreme, and a taco burrito. They have patio, inside, and upstairs seating. We went upstairs only to find the DJ and more condiments. It was an awesome experience, the place was clean, the people were full of energy, and it was just a lot of fun. Our food was ready, we took our shots, devoured our food, and I didn't want it to end. I never thought I would ever give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but for that night and experience, they deserved them all. Thank you for giving my boyfriend and I an amazing experience that we will always remember!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,6,4,5,f0G5BUVg1hpz3lKfHoDakw
