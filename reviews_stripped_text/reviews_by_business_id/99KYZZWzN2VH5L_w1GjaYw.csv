1053621,2011-10-17,0,99KYZZWzN2VH5L_w1GjaYw,I really love Chilis because it is a great place to get food and dine with friends.  I love going with a group and ordering the great tasting Awesome Blossom and flavorful margaritas.  They have a menu that pleases everyone and it is just a fun place.  The service is always great in a good atmosphere for a fun dining experience.,GS6HKuXL-jvojnIsIhzx1Q,0,0,4,jZQulUdlCA5heDgimRD4eQ

It didn't last, obviously, but I'll always look back on that moment fondly. You know, before he dumped me on my birthday and asked for his jacket back.",gjhzKWsqCIrpEd9pevbKZw,0,0,3,LXcRIpZ_niv5wAqToqDB-A

The servers also have a lot of ""flair"" on them, so that also deserves a tweak and a nod. I don't dare talk shit or complain about my order, and I always check for ""special sauce"" on my entrees. All kidding aside, I have a soft spot for this Chili's because of the proximity to my old workplace and also how their adding a new low calorie menu became sort of a side joke with my group -- we'd all order a low-cal plate, but start things off with a Sampler, thereby negating the Positive Healing aspect. Several rounds of Mojitos and Bloody Marys would also follow, another reason why I enjoy Chili's is because I like to drink with my food, regardless of what time of day it is. Thankfully, the Vegas location doesn't beat around the lush. (Load groans and squishy fruit FX)",A2HbQtcuK2tkegX7BXcEtg,4,4,4,LTyjivjKAOsMhsJAStUHRw
