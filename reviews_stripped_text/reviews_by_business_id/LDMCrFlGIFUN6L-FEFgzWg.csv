649154,2014-11-25,0,LDMCrFlGIFUN6L-FEFgzWg,Food is good prices are good and service was good. I think the family meals prices were very reasonable. For only 25 bucks you get 12 priece leg and thighs 2 large sides churros and enchiladas. I would have to say the churros were the best part of this meal lol but over all it was a good experience.,6ouNbGA50B7WUUhZuOy0Cw,0,0,3,FdsAx-XpgfWzLHUDJWZTzw

1418895,2014-11-26,0,LDMCrFlGIFUN6L-FEFgzWg,"I've been eating chicken at el poll loco since 1986 and the Flavor has decayed over time. It's a shame, because it used to be so good. Same is happening to the rice and beens. I also had a mango avocado salad, it was plain. It had only a few minuscule pieces of mango, half an avocado, broken tortilla chips strip and no dressing.",yeyeg8Vm4Lxvf4tZqoiKIA,0,0,2,VSpTKm_Z7N9_-6jbbkozmA
2190666,2017-09-24,0,LDMCrFlGIFUN6L-FEFgzWg,"My gripe with this location is the service.  I'm trying to eat healthier so I go there get a breast, take it home and eat it with a salad.  I went there last week, the drive thru was crowded so I walked in.  Ordered a single breast, the kid at the register told me the register wasn't letting him select a single breast.  I told him I come there and order it all the time, he tells me in an irritated tone ""I'm sorry sir, it's not letting me enter that on my register"".   Again I told him I place that order all the time so it can be done.  Instead of asking for help I had to tell him to get a manager.  It takes her about 5 seconds to punch in the proper keystrokes for a single breast.    They need to train their staff a bit better.",u4BHxiH2fBlH6bRJxDl8Xw,0,0,2,vmqyLqXLT76hHdI7tp3qFQ
2918579,2015-06-18,1,LDMCrFlGIFUN6L-FEFgzWg,"Given this location is close to my work I find it convenient. I generally go through the drive through. It can get busy during lunch hours but for the most part they move cars fairly quickly. Customer service has always been good to me and my order is always correct and complete. My typical order is a chicken bowl with rice, pinto beans and chicken. This place is perfect for those looking to cut down on greasy fast food meals. While it's still not the healthiest, the charbroiled chicken is simply flavorful and a healthier choice.",YxqLJwDgcL4OoDB1hN-Ikg,2,2,3,qlnMpBo8_GWhlJE6zR51qA

4907477,2015-06-16,0,LDMCrFlGIFUN6L-FEFgzWg,"A great mix between an authentic Mexican taco restaurant and a high quality barbecue spot. We got in around 4 and the smell of delicious chicken greeted us. The lady serving us and taking our order was pleasant, bilingual, and able to help us pick something to try for our first time here. The salad was crisp cool and fresh with plenty of pollo. The burrito exploded with flavor and was enjoyable all the way through.
If you aren't in a chicken mood I see that they also offer carne asada. But I haven't yet tried it. It does get a bit more busy by 5:30 on the weekday so try to get there a little early.",Pg-sMoiilKCVPs41vf5V_Q,0,0,4,ilj0ZswUKjNMjw2kz7cgTg

Kids running around no one tells them anything. Rice hard tastes a day old, pico de gallo no flavor also tastes old, chicken tooooo dry, flies flying everywhere. Location dirty and very loud. I DO NOT RECOMMEND This location at ALL....",vRJxRdfQ1JJnFtgDhICKcA,0,0,1,4-UYDaFcO-VQ3C1Kr6y38A
