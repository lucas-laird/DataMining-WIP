They have a pretty good Happy Hour (although the times aren't necessarily posted) and the food is actually quite good for bar food.  The staff is what sets the Pint apart from other sports bars in the Summerlin area.  They genuinely seem to love working at the Pint.  They are continuously welcoming, helpful, and eager to assist in any way they can (ALL staff; servers, bartenders, etc).

I am a HUGE player and I was playing at the bar for about 7 hours . I go all over Vegas and play. Michelle the bartender is nice and accommodating, however the guy swing shift bartender is the absolutely rudest person I have ever encountered (apparently his mother is the owner of the Establishment) so I'm guessing he acts how he wants to act to his discretion. Came in had a awful attitude my sister told him I had gambled over $1300 and heard there was free play he immediately mumbled she did not play that much !! He then said I'm tired I don't have time for this I need to go get a Starbucks. I've been a bartender in this town for years, it's simple you just check to see how much the player spent or won. That's how they comp food cigarettes etc. regardless if you have a players card or not. It's really unfortunate when your family owns a place and the child or family member works there they automatically think they can treat customers however and that's very very sad. I sure hope his mother reads this review and sees the seriousness of this.",d6K5l6kwFlcITrIeyRaufw,2,0,1,sgYjmqAVlfRqIz_6FE-hxg

The bartenders walked pasted me about 2 times and did not acknowledge me.. Finally one bartender asked if i have been helped.. I said no and he said I'm sorry I walked passed you twice and didn't ask you.. I said its ok.. I had my beer(2) and a shot of Jameson and I was gambling...

1467308,2017-09-02,1,RDO51EhaqSt1Psdwcwx3Bg,"First off, I want to say that it pains me to give this place 1 star. They have SO much potential. Unfortunately, based on my experiences here, I can't do that. I personally don't recommend this bar due to the poor customer service. 

Folks, I gave it more than enough tries before writing this review. I've been here about 6 times and only had somewhat decent service once. 

My most recent visit was last weekend. The place was pretty empty. My boyfriend and I sat down at the bar and waited.... waited.... and waited! Talk about feeling unwelcome. Unless they were blind, there was NO way they didn't see us. There  were 2 female bartenders, behind the bar, who seemed more interested in discussing their friend Michelle's party, that was happening later, than attending to customers. After about 15 min I asked for a drink menu. The bartender gave us the menu and then seemed to have forgotten about us. She was counting receipts and checking the dishwasher looking everywhere but at us. Finally the other bartender made eye contact with me so I said ""We are patiently waiting for one of you to take our order.""  She responded with ""Oh, I figured she took your order."" (Side Rant: Any normal person with even an ounce of customer service would and should have enough attention to detail to notice that 2 customers were sitting at the bar for an awful long time with no food or drink in front of them. How do you not at least check with the other bartender and ask if she took the order?!? If you don't have even a fraction of that kind of attention to detail, then you shouldn't have a customer service job!) she quickly poured our drinks and when our drinks got low, neither bartender acknowledged it. Neither bartender was making drinks. One was just standing around  and the other  had very tweekish behavior. There was no excuse for the lack of customer service we received. Had they been a tad more friendly, we would have drank more and probably ordered food, even though it's just mediocre. Instead, we had one drink and left. 

I most likely won't go here again. If I do, it's against my will. It's insulting to go to an establishment and be treated like you're intruding. 

Another reviewer stated that they saw a bartender get off their shift and start gambling. We saw the same thing happen when we were there. No wonder why she didn't want to take our order. Her shift was ending and was eager to hit those machines. 

I dunno what's going on with this place but I predict that if they don't change their attitude toward customers, they'll be outta business in no time. It's really a shame because they have so much potential. 

If you dont mind being treated rudely then by all means go here. They actually have decent craft beer selection.",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,4,0,1,OYpZd7R_FPf2uRj7WtKq7Q

   I have worked in food/drink service for 8yrs and customer service for 20+.

While it's hard to cast aside my longing for the previous occupants, let us press on with pros and cons:
Pros
Good food for bar fare; not amazing, but good
Great menu variety
Local beers on tap scores a big win for me here, they have Bad Beat
It does look clean/streamlined 
Vendors pop in, setup shop, give free samples and discounted stuff (we got a free taster)
Cons
So it is streamlined, but damn, so much open space makes me agoraphobic; fill it in a little
Smokey-as-hell...I know, I know. ""It's a bar!"" Pff.
Kinda pricey
I don't see an advertised happy hour; HH is one of the things that MAKES me come back

I've been here twice, just because it's close, as in stumbling distance, should I get too sloppy. 
It is still a sports bar, and on that note, if PT's was closer, or in the same distance, I'd probably alternate; they're about equal, except PT's has ""THE GILROY"" pizza and a reliable HH.",q5afJ8gTV5TPEOkzyeJ_WQ,6,3,3,pwLd2cS2VxsAJwJfFx0SLA

It's a cool touch, and the service is pretty laid-back and cool, too. HH runs daily from 3-6PM, with $3 drink specials and $4 food specials, plus half-price flatbreads. Food is decent, beer selection is large.

PRETZEL BITES ($4, HH): Decent portion, served with a whole-grain mustard and canned cheese for dipping. Not bad, good for a snack.
BEEF FLAUTAS ($4, HH): four or five rolled tacos, seemed to be baked instead of fried, with a soft exterior rather than the hard, crunchy version. Filling was decent, and the order was served with a drizzle of sour cream and a scoop of pico de gallo. 
FLATBREADS (half off during HH): These range from $10-13 regularly, and are a steal during HH. Large portion is 8 pieces, flatbread is nicely crisp and topped with a thin layer of meats, cheeses, and sauce. I prefer the buffalo chicken version (includes celery and lots of bleu cheese) to the barbecue chicken (didn't care for the sauce).
CHILI CUP: This was not on HH but caught my eye on the menu, made using ground chuck, black, and pinto beans, recipe seemed similar to how I make this dish at home. The cup was cheap (under $4), but the flavors just didn't do it for me, didn't finish this and wouldn't get it again.

DRINKS: HH drink prices are awesome, $3 for the featured beer, all house wines, and all well drinks. The house cab is actually really good, and the featured beer is made locally by Bad Beat- the Pint Pilsner, and it's delicious!

This is a great spot to catch a game, as they have the NFL and MLB package, as well as regional sports channels, and several TVs. Interior also includes a pool table, built-in gaming, and a few arcade games (Galaga?). Will be back in the fall when NFL season kicks up again.

We stopped in for breakfast/brunch and enjoyed a classic (2eggs/sausage/hash browns) and their zucchini sticks-both great! Not the twisted food I'm referring to but I reviewed the menu and was very enticed by the hot dog wrapped in bacon and fried pickles etc.
Only small issue was that a very large party came in and pretty much swallowed the waitresses time.
A couple times I got up to get jelly, and then extra ranch-really not that much of a problem-and because I did Nick the manager felt the need (without being asked) to discount cuz of the inconvenience.
We will be back and encourage you to stop in here for Sunday brunch instead of waiting forever to get into the Cracked Egg.

2716990,2017-12-26,0,RDO51EhaqSt1Psdwcwx3Bg,"When you enter, you feel like you're briefly waking through the cold storage and beer keg refrigeration room:  definitely sets a cool vibe.  Inside is a high-ceiling, very open room, low and high tables, and booths around the outer walls, and an island bar in the middle.  TVs ring the establishment.  What makes it cool is how simple it all is.

First visit was for lunch during the week.  The place was quiet, service was friendly and frequent, and the food was definitely on the better side of pub food.  I had the Southwest Burger and my wife had the 5 Bs Burger.  The iced tea tasted very fresh!

Close parking can be tight.  This isn't unique to The Pint though.  It's just that side/end of the shopping center where The Pint is located.  The nearest parking is a narrow area squeezed between the building and Hualapai Way.  Not to worry though, you can always park just around the corner in the front of the shopping center.  It's not far at all.

During our second visit, the food was just as good but the service lacked a little.  The place wasn't busy at all but it seemed to take our server longer than necessary to make it back to our table for refills and to check up on us.  We finally had to go to the bar to ask for our check because our server disappeared.  Even so, it wasn't a bad experience but the Pint (for now) lands a solid 3-stars due to above average, then below average service.  Give it a shot and see what you think--it's definitely convenient if you live near Charleston and Hualapai.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,1,3,kvO3OjpyStEELJfn-TZ6fQ

I really enjoyed their Mushroom Swiss burger - it was a moist burger with great flavor from the Mushroom and cheese. My friends also opted to grab 3 different flatbreads. The flatbreads were kind of mediocre to good, but were also half off during happy hour. We agreed that the flatbreads were probably only worth it during happy hour. The veggie was pretty good, but largely due to the contrast in saltiness and sweet with balsamic vinegar.

OMG I never thought I would get kicked out of my seat! Who does that?  I only give this place 3 stars because the previous bartender really deserves 5 stars but the fact that I was told to move out of my seat and I was asked if I wanted a to go box should have been a sign that I was getting kicked out. IVE NEVER BEEN TOLD TO MOVE!!! I'm appalled!!!  It's so sad how everything can change in one visit. I will NOT be coming back!! I decided to leave the premises. 

If you ever come to this place and don't want to be moved. Don't settle your bill. Better yet, find a different sports bar!

Previous review:
This place is great during lunch hour and dinner time. The games are awesome and I look forward to seeing more games at this bar. The staff is friendly and the crowd is pretty cool. It's my second time here and all I see are people who treat each other like family. At only 4.5 miles from home. This is better than a local bar.

Was coldly greeted by a blonde bartender, ordered my drinks and food and then had to flag her down for refills when she was stopping to check in on people to my left and right. 350 dollars later I ask if I owe anything. I receive a bill for my food and proceed to ask what the slot comp policy was. 300 gets you free food, when I asked her to check my coin in she tells me its hard to keep track of coin in when I dont have a card, as my card is sitting in the machine, and besides that you can check the bill history for the last 24 hours on jet gaming machines.

5902370,2015-05-24,14,RDO51EhaqSt1Psdwcwx3Bg,"Unlike many people, we miss the old Outside Inn, so we zipped down Hualapai to try out its replacement.

The big space seems a little bigger now, but maybe because it's a bit more industrial-looking.  It's strictly seat-yourself, with a small smoking section of tables set further from the bar than than the non-smoking ones.  Makes no sense at all, since the non-smoking ones are closer to the smoking-okay bar.  But for you fumiphobes out there, they do have a powerful ventilation system, and we didn't smell anything other than food and beer.

When in a pub, I usually order cider instead of wine.  Why?  1. More drink for the dollar.  2.  It's usually on tap.  3.  Since I'm so little, I can get a buzz from anything.  Call me un-American, but I just don't like beer.  At first I was disappointed that the only cider they had was Strongbow, since I thought it was one that was too dry for my taste.  But after our server, Jen, brought me some to sample, I realized that I was thinking of some other brand.  This was just the kind I like.  Hubby had a pilsner, which he enjoyed.

I threw diet to the winds (so what else is new?) and ordered a California Reuben, which is made with cole slaw, rather than sauerkraut.  Herb went even more whole hog, and got the pastrami burger.  We both agree that this is the best pastrami we've had since we moved to Vegas - tender, lean, and delicious.  Not as smoky as New York pastrami, but that'll never happen here.  Still, The Pint's pastrami is #1 West of the Rockies in our book, and we know from pastrami.  

The burger was freshly made, and on a roll that looked incredibly shiny and wonderful, though I forgot to taste it; I was too busy inhaling my own sammich.  He loved it, and it didn't turn into a soggy mess.  He also ordered a side salad ($3 upcharge), and it was a big bowl of greens, with some carrots, and cucumber and tomato dice as garnish.  His burger came with a choice of slaw, fries, or sweet potato fries (no upcharge!), and he was able to get a mix of the regular and s.p. fries.  The regular ones were just ordinary, but the sweet potato fries were outstanding, and I don't usually like them!

What I like about The Pint is that, although the menu isn't all that large (e.g., there are only 5 dinner entrees offered), almost all of the food is freshly made.  And that includes the burgers, buns and, I think, the s.p. fries, too, which is why they tasted like real sweet potatoes.

Our waitress, Jen, was excellent and professional, though she pissed me off a bit when she carded a group of eight, but not us.  (That is a joke, but if I have to explain...).

We'll be back, but it'll be hard to try anything else, because I know we'll be jonesin' for that pastrami!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,23,18,4,39VsGI-RFbuYRIND7D4_Pg

The only critique I would make is that I would like to see crazier beers here (sour beer and more Belgian stuff.)
