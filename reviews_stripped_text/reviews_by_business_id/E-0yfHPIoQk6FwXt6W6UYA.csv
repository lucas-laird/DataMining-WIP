The sandwiches (burgers, grilled chicken, etc.) are pitiful. Like something you'd get at a high school cafeteria. And there are only four salad options, all semi-premade so your only choice is dressing and type of meat. Really disappointing.",aM3T4jeHY_fswn6xQ41rtw,1,0,1,v-cChx9ZaWCNmpsAWCvPVA

The tiny chicken breast was obviously frozen and didn't appear to be seasoned. It came on a bun with lettuce, tomato and onion. There was no mayonnaise available to help add flavor. 
I came during CES and it was so crowded and didn't realize what line I was getting in. I chose poorly and by the time I got to the front and could see the menu for my line it only had chicken tender, sad chicken sandwich, or a burger. Another line seemed to only have sandwiches and another had only salads. At least I didn't end up in the salad line 
2 stars only because they had decent French fries",jn7S36BOdyyyzMR-AbNPzg,0,0,2,oDH5t_M9I_89QrW0RSz0Fg

IMO, as far as convention centers go, the food options at the Las Vegas Convention Center have always been limited, especially when compared to other large convention and trade show facilities.  Lucky's, while not a name brand offering, seems to be OK.  You can get burgers, chicken breast or other hot sandwiches with fries as well as salads and cold foods, a large variety of soft drinks and even Starbucks coffee (no barista, but they have large dispensers of regular and decaf).

In general there isn't normally an issue finding seating here except for maybe at peak lunch time during extremely large conventions, and Lucky's is very efficiently run with one large area to get your food, several cashier lines beyond that with parallel countertops on both sides of the cashier so they can see your purchases and ring you up, credit card payments are lighting fast, and then you'll find a few stations to get condiments, napkins and the like. Even the area where you order the hot sandwiches is well run and set up to handle large numbers of convention attendees quickly, with one person taking your order and placing the pre-cooked burger or chicken breast on a bun, the next person in their assembly line adding things like fries, and a third offering toppings such as lettuce and tomato before handing you your order.  In all to order and receive a burger or hot sandwich and fries with toppings takes less than a minute once you actually get to the food prep area (there's sometimes a small line for the hot food stations which is managed with ropes and stanchions).

The quality of the food is fine for convention center grub, and the prices aren't horrible with a burger, fries and regular soda pricing out at just under $14.  I returned and got a regular cup of Starbucks later in the day and it was $2.70, which is reasonable.",-VOylYXNq7sG6As966yTxA,5,3,4,HRPziicRjYv66T3dKQW8yw

They put on lettuce and tomato as I requested including jalape√±os. They had hamburgers and fries. Nice while we were there for gaming EVO. Great for where and what it is.",3jJYcv7ly8sQ8uqEeL46xg,0,0,4,Kh1Ff_e9FOHb8TmbGBhorA
