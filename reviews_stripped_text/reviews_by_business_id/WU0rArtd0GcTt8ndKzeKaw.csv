72820,2016-06-22,1,WU0rArtd0GcTt8ndKzeKaw,"My daughter and husband started doing BJJ about 2 years ago, here in Las Vegas at another gym. My husband got injured after training for a few months, while our daughter continued. She found a passion in competing in tournaments, however, the team that she was with did not focus on tournaments, leaving my daughter stagnant with her BJJ technique and not progressing in competition. We started to see a group of coaches in bow ties at tournaments.. Not only did their professional attire stand out, but their passion for the sport and the kids on the mat. My family and I watched this team of coaches support their students, win or lose. Each competitor from the team always had a coach by their side, something that we were unfamiliar with. A few days later, we walked in to Cobrinha BJJ Academy Las Vegas, and we were immediately greeted by Professor Hector. He welcomed us with open arms, and our daughter felt comfortable trying a class with his students. The team graciously accepted my daughter and made her feel that she was a part of their family. We quickly made the decision to change gyms and train with Professor Hector. His business partner Helen, helped make our gym transition smooth and painless. It has been three months now, and we have seen a drastic improvement in our daughter. She has evolved both physically and mentally since being at this academy. My husband has even decided to go back to training, after seeing the family environment that the academy provides. Everyone is there to help you, not hurt you, and there are no ego's in the adult classes or the kids classes. We definitely made the right choice when we changed gyms. We encourage everyone to come see the difference in their kids that we have seen in ours. Thank you to Professor Hector, Helen, Coaches, and the rest of the Cobrinha Team, who continue to challenge, inspire, and support us.",_UVCZmU6q8AvHklG0BH2sw,0,0,5,VlKpb9-uloM4iMozlVwsiw

When we planned our trip to California for the IBJJF Pan Tournament, we decided to go by way of Las Vegas. (No judging... please). My son had a great desire to receive training from an Alliance academy. He was more than excited when he found that Hector Vasquez had a BJJ academy in Las Vegas. He visited the gym and loved it so much that we change our travel plans to allow him more time to train with Hector. Training for my son with Hector and his students was an awesome experience. He can't wait to go back to Las Vegas (very soon) to do it again. The students were welcoming and demonstrated the hospitality that was obviously handed down by example of their Professor - Hector. 

My experience as a parent was outstanding. Helen Shelby (Director of Marketing) was so friendly and welcoming to both me and my son. I felt immediately at home with Helen, Hector, and the students. I couldn't wait to get back to the gym just to spend a little more time with these exceptional people. I genuinely miss them already and I've only been home to Wisconsin for a couple of days. 

We will be returning to Las Vegas just as soon as we possibly can for some excellent BJJ training and to visit our new and treasured friends, Hector, Helen, and the students. Thank you Hector, Helen, and all the students who made our travels complete with training, friendship, and a bond with the Las Vegas Alliance brotherhood/sisterhood that we love so much.

Please take your kids, teenagers, parents, grand-parents or anyone else who is looking for some great physical activity, self-defense training, and first-rate Brazillian Jiu Jitsu to Hector and Helen at Cobrinha Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy Las Vegas or call them at (702) 527-5122 for more information and the best training and genuine hospitality.",g4nvAO6jfFl7PJYd6sGdbw,0,0,5,QkCxIPyNA-7RZegCAlw5Cw

801182,2017-02-27,0,WU0rArtd0GcTt8ndKzeKaw,"When we came to Cobrinha my son had been practicing bjj for 4 months. We were very unhappy with his previous gym so with a recommendation from a friend we reluctantly tried Cobrinha BJJ. However, the moment we stepped into the gym we were warmly greeted by Professor Hector and his staff. He explained to us his philosophies and gave us a brief background of his bjj education and accomplishments. Following our meeting my son participated in a trial class and it soon became apparent that his first 4 months of training was a joke. In the first day at Cobrinha,  he learned techniques and verbiage that he had never learned previously. Professor, the other coaches and the kids were very patient and willing to help him throughout the session. I couldn't believe the amount of unity and willingness to help that everyone has. After leaving we knew that this was the place that we need our son to train. It has been 7 months now and my son has participated in 3 tournaments and has won all 3 (including Pan Kids 2017). His growth and accomplishments are all because Cobrinha BJJ has given him the tools he needs to be an amazing fighter and person. Because at Cobrinha, Professor's philosophies of bjj are not only applicable on the mat but off as well. 

We are a true family at Cobrinha BJJ. So if you want your child to grow as a fighter and really grasp the concept of bjj come to Cobrinha. You will NOT regret it, we don't! Cobrinha BJJ!!!",gnFs4lX3sR5TXcm607KYBw,0,0,5,ZuLJDD1nUNXeGPssYgWETg

It's unquestionably among the best I've seen. In the first few weeks I saw improvements in my sons' and I, and we have been building on that regularly. My sons have competed in tournaments and have grown through those experiences, thanks to Cobrinha. 

Not only is it a great school to improve your BJJ it's an academy with great families who are welcoming and kind. All of the the coaches/instructors are top notch and caring. For example, Coach Robert for the 7 am class is experienced and passionate. Coach Ryan in the kids class is always encouraging my sons and giving guidance on improvements.   I am regularly impressed by Professor Hector (owner). He challenges the students to become the best version of ourselves both mentally and physically; he takes opportunities to challenge students to become better people in their everyday lives.

I admire his warrior mentality while teaching all students the value of teamwork. No matter how long a student has been in the field, the humbleness and openness to all possibilities for a new student is welcomed with open arms.  The energy and blessings of each spirit that is part of Cobrinha BJJ Las Vegas is remarkable.  My sons are so happy they finally get to utilize their strengths and energy while learning discipline, commitment, respect, and responsibility.

The training and instruction is top notch here. Professor Hector is a very knowledgeable black belt under Cobrinha. He focuses on all his student on and off the mat, as well as helping visitors learn the techniques. He encourages students to ask questions on the technique of the day or just any technique the student has in mind.

Another cool thing about this gym is that a lot of famous jiu jitsu practitioners come here to visit. Just to name a few Cobrinha (obviously), Miyao, Denilson Pimenta, Bruno Malfacine.

2527520,2017-06-17,0,WU0rArtd0GcTt8ndKzeKaw,"I cannot say enough great things about this place and Professor Hector. I've been around for over a year now and finally got around to writing a long-overdue review. It's worth a read for anyone who wants to learn more about this Academy. 

Below I thoroughly highlight areas worth discussing about the Academy. 

KIDS PROGRAM
Professor Hector is amazing with the kids, and it shows with the continuous growth in enrollment. Parents rely on him to ensure their child(ren) learn not only the sport, but discipline and hard work. His kids class put in serious work. It's crazy to see how he seamlessly manages 40+/- kids on the mat. He knows just how to handle the kids, regardless of their personalities and ages. Just watch a class, and you will see how much the kids respect Professor and the assistant coaches. 

BJJ ALL LEVELS
This is the class with mostly adults and some kids/teens. What's interesting is seeing the growth in parents who are now taking part in their children's lifestyle. Couples, too, are joining together. It doesn't matter what belt color or fitness level you're at, Professor will make it work for you. 

COMMUNITY
It's a family environment, which means anyone is welcome. Even if you don't practice BJJ and have a family member or partner that does it, you'd still be drawn in. 

PROFESSOR HECTOR
For someone who sees about 50-100+ people daily, he knows every single member's name, and to me that says a lot about how sincere and passionate he is. He's not just there to do a job. He gets to know you and your weaknesses and strengths and helps you to develop an efficient way of training. During technique drills, he goes around the class and really pays attention to details and will ensure you have the proper form. As a white belt, I think that's important and he helps explain the mechanics/use of the move. 

Of significance to me is how accommodating he is -- when I was pregnant, he provided a safe training environment that enabled me to train up until I gave birth. Because I continued to train, I was able to stay flexible and thus had an easy birth. I came back, over a month later, and he continues to encourage and challenge me to get back to a more consistent/hard training. 

In addition to teaching, Professor also makes it a point to impart some words of wisdom or inspiration at the end of class sometimes. It serves to motivate us lest we become complacent. That's the kind of mentor/coach you want; not someone who easily dismisses the class after teaching. He cares--a lot. 

Many people look to a leader who's obviously good at what they teach. So whether it's scholastics or sports, we all want to learn from champions, professionals, and highly decorated athletes.  There's a difference between being the best at something and being able to teach it. So, one thing to keep is mind is -- ""But how well can they teach?"" Professor Hector exemplifies both the expertise in the sport and in teaching it. So whether you're serious about BJJ or simply want to learn and be part of the community, this is the place to be.",TaooeQ4R-m38OpAwUglerA,2,1,5,YbctxeHn4nlS8FZRTF8qyg
2593790,2017-10-20,0,WU0rArtd0GcTt8ndKzeKaw,"We brought our daughter to Cobrinha from another BJJ academy here in Vegas because we kept hearing the whispers that the kids program was second to none...and were BLOWN AWAY. We signed up the same day.  Hector Vasquez personally teaches the classes and is on the mat with the kids the entire class (along with a minimum of 5 other instructors). The instruction and training is unmatched. Safety is always a top priority and every child is very closely monitored. 
It is very fitting that his slogan is ""evolve your game"" because that's exactly what happens when you train here!! Our daughter has not only grown leaps and bounds technically, but her self confidence has skyrocketed! 
I think what makes all the difference is Professor Vasquez's passion for what he does. He cares so deeply about every one of his students.

Professor Hector and his partner Helen, along with their entire staff, were so welcoming to my family and I.  My daughter tried out for their 3 to 5 year old 30 minute class which she enjoyed very much.  Upon leaving at the end of the night, my daughter proclaimed to me that she could not wait to come back!   We came back two days later and she enjoyed it.   Hector works very well with children and their tournament results prove it!  I'd recommend to enroll your kids here in a heart beat.  The strength and confidence your child acquires and the technical skills to defend themselves could all be attained here.  The sense of belonging in a very safe and family-oriented atmosphere makes this place better than any other gym in the valley!

I also took the opportunity for a free trial class.  I was provided with a gi to try on and, as a total newbie to the jiu jitsu world, I worked one on one with one of the students prior to the 7pm class to learn some basics. The drills were excellent and the next hour of rolling was very humbling.  I was paired with someone much larger than me who I told not to hold back and I realized how much I still needed (and wanted) to learn.  Rolling is a full body workout, but it is also sharpening yourself mentally.  

Despite how far this gym is to where I live, I chose this place for a few reasons: 1) The staff is very motivated and passionate about their work.  They love what they do. 2) Their kids jiu jitsu program is excellent. 3) Professor Hector is a five time world champion.  To be the best you first learn from the best.  His modern jiu jitsu keeps you ahead of the curve. 4) Their customer service is top notch!   Very important.   In a city so saturated with jiu jitsu gyms, the ones who show they actually care about their customer is the gym I want to be a part of. 

Their facility is very clean with lockers and showers, two viewing rooms where families can hang out, refrigerators to keep your food in while you train, and they seem to continue to upgrade the facility with additional sofas I noticed up front today.   Soon, they'll have to knock down the walls and get a second mat!

I've referred quite a few people already (and their kids) and I hope to bring them by soon.  I will continue to give them my highest recommendation and my family is looking forward to learning the Conbrinha way!",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,6,4,5,_IZZuNSkH_ynJtZb4hRWeA

My son needs to be more aggressive while my daughter needs to pay attention to detail/technique.

I said I would like to just watch for now. The class starts off with Hector teaching the whole class a move/technique, and the class pairs up and drills the move. This is the warmup. No carrying your partner on your back across the room and back, forward rolling across the room, backward rolling across the room, shrimping across the room, etc., so that by the time you start to teach, everyone is already tired. While the students are drilling, Hector is walking around, observing each student, and making corrections/adjustments as needed. After the drilling/warmup, there is sparring. Throughout the class, the higher belts are mixing it up and working with lower belts and helping them. After the class was done, Hector talked to me some more, and told me that he makes it a point to be the one teaching every single class. Even if there are higher belts present, he will still be the one teaching. And by teaching, he is actually teaching, not messing around on his phone and letting people do whatever and potentially hurt themselves or the people they are rolling with. This sold me. I brought my girlfriend the next morning, and we both signed up after participating in the class. I am so glad we found this school. It really is a family atmosphere where every one wants to help each other get better. You can really tell that Hector is dedicated and passionate about teaching. Whether you are just starting out, or you are looking to maybe change schools, come check out Cobrinha and decide for yourself. I thought when you're just starting out, it doesn't matter much which school you go to, because they are all the same in teaching the basics. That is completely incorrect. I feel like I have learned and progressed infinitely more in the 3 months that I have been at Cobrinha, than I did in the 8 months that I trained at the other school. AND I enjoy coming to class so much more here! They are about to start adding an additional early morning class to accommodate more people's schedules. So come check out the school. I'm glad I did!",i8T0-TaOFr7OYLrSEDLLZg,1,1,5,dz8_zOJanJpUsUuFqL39WA
5818743,2015-10-16,0,WU0rArtd0GcTt8ndKzeKaw,Hector and I have only met at tournaments when his kids team would compete against mine. His students were always the hardest to compete with because of their awesome technique due to Hectors coaching.  Las Vegas has a new sherriff in town with this Academy.  If you have a kid that wants to be great THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE.  This is coming from a different school owner with no affiliation with this academy. That alone says a lot and speaks volumes this is the place to be.,KiRKxp5OH8moixNmJCD7PA,0,0,5,qUD461bilDfi8JYzWVv-xQ
5906948,2016-10-19,0,WU0rArtd0GcTt8ndKzeKaw,"We started hunting for a BJJ place for our daughter sometime around June 2016. The goal was to find a place that would help her build confidence, further develop respect for self and others, and to keep her active. All the technique and skill she picked up would've just been extra. We've seriously got all that and a whole lot more. 

It all starts with Professor Hector and Helen. They were very welcoming on her first class, no pressure. Just to see if it something she'd be interested. She has gone from a reluctant, shy girl to loving everything about Jiu Jitsu and being more confident in herself. Everything about this place is second to none, from the way the coaches handle the kids' classes to the how Hector pushes you to get the best out of yourself. They keep it real and I've seen many kids get better in the 4  months we've been here.  We started out with an average class of 15 kids in July and now I sometimes see 45 kids on back-to-back days. 

Most of parents I've spoken to have been in the BJJ game for a long time, have transferred here, and they all say ""This is the place to be."" It shows with the attendance and low turnover. Many kids come, not many leave.

Our daughter has been in soccer for a year more than BJJ, but if given only one choice, we definitely would stay with Hector and Cobrinha for as long as we're allowed to. 

Highly recommend. World class teachers. World class family.",PI9anKK4ZTNhj23kjZ5bbw,0,0,5,qAR_7_faqPAe7n3CzxBUow
