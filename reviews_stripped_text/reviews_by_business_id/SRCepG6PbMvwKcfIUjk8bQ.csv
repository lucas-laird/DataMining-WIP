93070,2015-02-18,0,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"The food is great but while they kind of go out of their way to serve you, but it's not really serving its hindering service by adding too many steps that dont need to be there. For instance, looking at the menu over the counter they ask if you'll be dining in, then, they make you sit down and wait for a menu and then wait so they can finish what they are doing in order to wait on you, once for drinks, again for food and again to ask if you want chips between all of that. With drinks why do you have to sit and wait when counter service gets them immediately? I probably waited 10-15 minutes longer for my food than if I ordered at counter. If they would have let me order at the counter, I could have conveniently sat down with my drink and they could bring out my food.  I dont care about ordering at a counter, I just want to eat and get on with my day.  The food is excellent but was there nearly an hour. Cilantro would do better to serve hungry customers more immediately and take the pomp and circumstance (and awkwardness) out of their ""dining experience"".",OP9OJlAFn6r7t9rIZQ2mqg,0,0,3,kSHcczS43J82ApPHi8Mk8Q

The value was not all that great either although it did come with avocado which can be expensive at times, it seems as though the box was just thrown together with the sandwich and some chips the presentation was not great at all.

644030,2014-01-14,2,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"I wasn't going to write this review as it has been a good seven months since I have gone here and maybe ... just maybe they have improved. But when I searched Yelp for mexican recommendations and saw this came up as highest rated I almost fell out of my chair. So of course I have to put in my two cents. Luckily, I have an excellent memory when it comes to things I care about i.e. food. 

First off, we went there right after they have opened so I will say maybe they were still working out the kinks, at least I hope they were.  On the positive side the dining room was clean, and it had some ambience (more than the typical taco shop would). Also, the owner attempted to rectify the situation, explained below, unfortunately it could not be. 

So I got the carne asada fries. Typical gringo mexican dish - maybe that was my mistake and I should have ordered something more authentic. The fries were not cooked at the right temperature, they came out greasy and undercooked. Not to mention for the price, I believe around the $7 range, the portion was rather skimpy. Took it to the counter and explained the issue, the person who I believe was either the owner or manager, cooked the fries again. Same exact issue. Which tells me that it was not a mistake but that they were unaware what temperature oil should be to properly cook fries in. Ultimately, they refunded our money and we went elsewhere. 

The service is the only reason that I am giving it two stars - to be honest I can't remember what my husband got, my guess is carne asada tacos and I tried some as I was starving due to having to wait for the re-fire of the carne asada french fries, but the tacos were not memorable.  I truly hope for their sake they improved, and from the sound of the other reviews, maybe they did. I suppose to give it a true review I should go back and try the food again but with the amount of taco shops in Vegas there are so many other place to try!",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,nOObUs91-Y74Hz_0OT_oBg

1167472,2014-10-18,0,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"In Vegas for the weekend and I was craving some Mexican food. Since I wasn't staying on The Strip, I used Yelp to look and found a pretty decent place. I ordered their Cilantro Fries, their version of carne asada fries, and it was so good. When I usually order an item like this back home, the fries are shoestrings and there are so many of them, that eventually you leave the uncoated fries behind. 
That wasn't the case with this one. They used thick steak fries. I had to use a for AND knife in order to eat it. Also the portion was so generous, that I only ate half of it and doggie bagged the rest. The perfect morning hangover meal. I do wish there was more meat on the fries because it was so nice and tender. 
Also their salsa is so good, especially their green one. Most of the green salsa is very watery and hot, but with not enough flavor. But this one had a thick consistency and tasted really good with the added spices, such as pepper. 
The staff was also very attentive, coming by every so often to ask us how our food is. From now on when I'm in Vegas, I will go out of my way to try out the rest of their menu. :)",0Sf7eblE0RLIk2CsoZzQ5A,1,0,5,Cys9Pfd-IrdtGZy6a7zUYQ

Have to admit that the people that gave this place 4 or more stars were right... This place is pretty good. 
Going in, we were greeted right away from the server/cashier/bus person. Friendly guy that made us feel welcome and didn't rush us to order. Even though we ordered our food to go, he checked up on us to see if we needed anything else while we waited. Towards the end, the chef came out and talked to us with him, promoting their Happy Hour from 5-6PM on Fridays... Mariachi band and all! Still didn't feel pressured, so it's impressive the way they're able to connect to their patrons that way. 
Honestly, if I didn't have plans tonight, I would totally hit that place back up! 
Back to the food... 
It was awesome! I had the Cilantro Steak Fries and my sister had the Carne Asada Burrito, and we had to share 'cause it was a huge portion on both.

The staff were super friendly, but the menu in place differs from what their website and Yelp show: new menu has more items but is more expensive too.

The asada fries I was originally considering are now up to $11- nevermind.
Ordered their tacos azules: one fish, one shrimp; and a basic carnitas taco. Salsa bar is pretty basic with a hot, a mild, and a spicy option, and limes.

 Opened my takeout order to find three azules-style tacos- the carnitas was topped with cabbage and a cream sauce instead of cilantro and onions. 
Carnitas was dry and crispy, fish and shrimp were mediocre: fish was baked and flavorless instead of baja style; bay shrimp were tiny and bland.
 
Not thrilled that I spent $10 for three tiny street tacos,  ate 1.5 before tossing the rest. Poor value- I suspect the management raised prices to accommodate for their lack of traffic. 
Maybe cut your staff instead: friendly or not, it doesn't take four people to run this place. I was the only customer, and somehow managed to they overcharge me and mess up my order.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,11,4,2,ZCJq8HansYjH4wP_JuH6MQ

Ive eaten so much mexican food in my life that i feel im part mexican. We got chicken street tacos. They were ok. Nothing special really. We also ordered mexican corn, which wasn't bad. I also ordered a carne asada burrito. It wasn't good at all. There was rice in the burrito which was new to me. I didn't like the taste. The burrito barely had meat in it. A carne asada burrito is supposed to be full of meat. There was more meat in the chicken taco then the carne asada burrito.

1906111,2013-05-29,0,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"Came into this place yesterday after the Pollo Mobile across the street ran out of Lengua and Huaraches! It was like 2p.m. so I decided to try a new place instead, Cilantro Tacos. This place hasn't been open long and to be honest, I never went in because of the name. I'm not a HUGE fan of cilantro so it was never really on my radar. Needless to say, cilantro is just a topping that you can ask to not have when you place your order so it's definitely not a big deal. Here's what I ordered for my wife and me and how it all stacked up. By the way, I have lived in California for about 6 years and have had Mexican food from many different places...so my descriptions are accurate :)

1 Taco de pollo/chicken - Wife ordered this, so I just had a bite. Chunky pieces of chicken. Up to par with a standard Mexican place.

1 Taco de al pastor/sauced pork - Wife ordered this, so again, I just had a bite. I'm not a fan of al pastor in general but from the bite I had, it was pretty good. Just the right amount of flavor to keep you coming back for more.

1 Taco de carne asada/marinated steak - This is where it's at. Thick juicy cuts of carne asada packed with flavor. Depending on the sauce you get from the salsa bar, this can end up being a fantastic snack/meal(if you plan on having more than one).

1 Taco de carnitas/pork - The carnitas I had at this place was probably some of the best carnitas I have ever had from any Mexican spot. Normally, when you order carnitas from any other place, you get small chunks of hardened pork that just doesn't do it for me. Cilantro Tacos carnitas is formulated of giant, soft, succulent pieces of pork with enough flavor to have me thinking about my next order for the subsequent time that I go. I don't know what I'll be getting the next time I go here, but one thing is for sure; At least one item that I end up getting will contain CARNITAS! lol :)

1 Order of Cilantro Fries - Now, for the Main Course, we had the Cilantro Fries(for those that don't like Cilantro, don't let the name throw you off, this dish has practically nothing to do with cilantro). This dish starts off with a nice layer of french fries. On top of that, you have about half a gallon of cheese. On top of that you have thick cuts of carne asada. This is served with 2 small sides of guacamole and 1 small side of sour cream. If you play your cards right, you dump the 2 sides of guacamole diagnolly on opposite sides of the dish and dump the sour cream right in the middle. After going to town on these fries, I realized that my wife and I were fighting over who got the next bite. Next time I'll just get my own order. These were different from your standard carne asada fries in the sense that this was a little more gourmet. It didn't have as much asada as a standard place would have, but the quality made up for that. It also wasn't as salty as normal carne asada fries would be. I will definitely be having this dish again. 

All in all, I have to give this place 5 stars for the following reasons;
1.) Pricing is decent for the quality of food.
2.) Meats(the ones that I like anyway - Carne Asada/Carnitas) were top notch and as I said before, ""If you're thinking of your next meal from the same place while you're eating, it's probably fantastic!"")
3.) Decor was great! I'm not a fan of Mexican music, but they had that playing in the background. Plus the place was super clean inside.
4.) 5 Stars - I plan on trying some other things on the menu and will drop the rating if I either don't like it or they start to slack. I don't see that happening any time soon though.

1 Gripe: My wife wanted me to mention that she wishes this place had Huaraches because she'd be here all the time if they did, lol. 

All in all, if you're looking for a fantastic Mexican place to simply grub or grab a snack, Cilantro Tacos is the place :D

Highlights were the habanero salsa, the green salsa, al pastor tacos, and the street corn (elote).  The corn was very flavorful and huge...and they actually brought two ears of corn for one of my friends because they said that they didn't have enough large ears. I will be back for more elote and that salsa.

2200009,2014-06-26,2,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"Hey this place is not bad! I didn't have high hopes of it being authentic bc of its location (outskirts of Summerlin), but to my surprise all the customers were Latino, always a good sign when eating at a Mexican place.

Their prices have gone up a little since that past few months. The tacos are now $2.25 to $2.75 instead of $2-$2.25. Also no more lengua. :(  And the Cilantro steak fries are now $9.95 vs $8.95.

We got the carne asada torta for $5.95 (vs $5.50 before) and the al pastor burrito for $6.50 (vs $5.95). The portions are on the smaller side, but this is a good thing with Mexican food being as heavy as it is. The asada is very tender. The bread was fresh and soft. I would have liked a bit more mayo though.

The al pastor was also very tender, but a bit too much rice in it. The salsa bar they have is great. The hot one was too hot for me. They also give you chips and salsa while you wait for your food, and that salsa is different than the ones at the salsa bar, which is really good!

They used thick cheddar slices for my fries, so it's perfectly covered. Delivery takes awhile, about a little over an hour with me being only about 3.5 miles away.

Waited a long time to get our food. No A/C. No Chips or Salsa was ever brought or offered. 
When it takes a long time, you start to look around hoping that your food order is the next one to comin out. I saw what I thought was our food given to a table of patrons that came in and got seated after us. After the waiter left, the people at that table flagged him back over. About a minute or so later, he went back to retrieve food from other people and brought it to our table. So, it WAS our food!! :/
Went to salsa bar and it was empty as in not plugged in/being used. Ate a dry torta that had less meat($7) then my son's street taco($2). ALL BREAD. 
NEVER got my water or my El Pastor taco that I ordered so I can not comment on that.

The wooden tables with the check patter table cloths is a quaint little touch.  The menu is a bit hard to ready being on the large side and directly above ones head.  Thankfully there is a hand held menu that is more easy to view.  I spent a couple of minutes deciding on tacos.  I never was fully able to decide on a protein for the tacos though so I went with one each, al pastor, carne asada and pollo.  They were the exact kind of taco I love.  Simply meat, cilantro and onion wrapped in two corn tortillas.  The al pastor had the addition of pineapple as is customary but the basics were the same.  I also ordered elote to compliment my meal.  A full ear of fresh and crisp corn on the cob topped with mayo, cotija cheese, chile and lime.  I never expected to like corn on the cob with mayo but man was it delicious.

A fair sized Burrito absolutely jampacked with so much rice that I couldn't even taste the meat. The only reason I even gave two stars was because they did include some chips to go with my burrito and some salsa which was nice of them but after charging me two dollars for a drink that was regular sized and maybe had half a drinks worth of liquid in it due to the excessive amount of ice I just can't see this as the type of value that I want to go back and spend money on for lunch.,2cwu3mjtBWWU94OnrOWOfA,0,0,2,qKEA1O_7SSj-vYqIY0l4oQ

4894112,2014-12-16,0,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"We love Cilantro Tacos!

Everything is home made (well, in a restaurant, yes), but you can tell your dinner is the product of hundreds of years of tradition. This is food of countless abuelitas, making the best of what they have and making it incredible.

First, their chipotle salsa is amazing. I have lost track of how many times we've stopped in just to get a couple containers. I seriously need someone to decode its secrets for me. My wife typically does not eat spicy food, but she loves, loves, loves this stuff.

They offer some stuff that is hard to find elsewhere. Alhambres is a mixture of grilled fresh chiles, cheese, avocado, and the meat of your choice. I couldn't stand not knowing what the word meant, but it sounded incredibly familiar for some reason, so a quick Googling revealed that it means ""wire"".

...as in the wire you'd use to cook a shish kabob.

One of their rotating specials is also a named after metal and shows the sense of pride in tradition. In this case, it's a giant piece of steel. A farm implement, precisely, the ""disco"": discada.

This is another mixture of ""a little of this, a little of that"" that probably developed as a way to utilize leftovers. Bite sized bits of beef, ham, sausage (hot dogs? were they hot dogs? If they were, then GOOD! I don't care.), chorizo, pork, chiles, etc., all cooked individually in a mixture of broth and beer, then mixed up.

Traditionally, it's cooked in a plow disc (the ""disco"")  that has lost its usefulness, welded shut, and often with a lip added. Often, the greatest things come purely from necessity and using all of your available resources. 

I can understand why they don't offer this every day. It's so very good, but it must take quite awhile to prep.

Cilantro Tacos also offers a Taqueria platter which would be great for a family or group. It's a pound or two of meat and all the setup needed for a group to make tacos. Fantastic option for family style dining.

The staff is always very friendly and the food is always very good.


I hesitate to NOT give them five stars, but it's those damned ""authentic"" chairs that keep it from being ""as good as it gets"" for me. They're wooden, straight backed, and just not entirely comfortable for a long time. They look like they're built to survive many, many drunken brawls in a dusty border cantina from the 1800s. 

If only I could give 4.5 stars, I certainly wood!

I will definitely come in again and again for that ceviche. No kidding. Look out for me, Cilantro Tacos, I'm about to eat all your shrimppppp!!!!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,5,4,3,p8Q-vT0Wfz5Gk9IUt0tsSQ

I ordered the - Taquiza Cilantro. Yes, it's huge. It's 1lbs of meat. I got 1lbs of carnitas and I didn't even eat half. I'll bring the rest home. 

Everything was freaking delicious. The tortillas, rice, toppings the grilled peppers...yum.

I don't have much else to say since I didn't go to the location, but that was an excellent deal for $24.95. 

I will order or go in MANY more times.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,11,8,5,h_nSlyI2phW2vBx5W-FYMw
5139381,2013-10-20,1,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"Sorry guys, am I eating the SAME food as the rest of ya?

I tried one of each taco.  Nothing really noteworthy IMO.

The Al Pastor was a chunky version, but it was also a little tough/chewy.  Not a ton of flavor compared to the better ones in Vegas.

The Asada was on the dry end...also a little CHEWY.  There were tougher bites in there...tendon/fat cuts.

The Carnitas and Pollo are the better bets here.  They were better than the others, but just ""good"" overall.

Also, all the tortilla were DRY and a little hard on the edges.  These tasted like the store bought ones and didn't feel fresh...To the point that they were distracting from the meat/salsa/etc.

Same could be said about the chips they dropped in front of me after I already had my tacos.  The salsa is great here, but the chips are also probably store bought and a little stale.

I hate to sound like a taco snob, but there are many other places with BETTER tacos for the same money or less.  To me, this place tasted like a cheaper/less quality Michoacan, and I don't really enjoy their food either.

However, their Horchata was GREAT!  One of the better versions out there! Lots of cinnamon and flavor inside.  There are some winners in the salsa bar as well, although I personally didn't find any ""spicy"" ones.

Can't say I will be back, but hope you enjoy the pics :",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,1,2,aH1UITx3PoivMJqN_MnF7Q

5161062,2014-01-08,0,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"I gave it a chance but it was not the type of Mexican food that I would typically crave or go to regularly. We had a total of five people in our party and 3 out of 5 felt the same way I did. 

The spot itself was clean and welcoming.  The employees are super nice. They bring chips and salsa which were very crisp and tasty. Good job in the chips! 

The part I wasn't pleased about was with my dish. When I think of fish tacos, I think of breaded, fried fish. If you ask for grilled fish tacos, you get grilled fish tacos. In my case, I got grilled fish (expecting more of a Baja style, breaded taco) tacos that were too fishy for me.  The fish was super bland. Two other people in my party felt the same way about their fish tacos. 

Second item I wasn't thrilled about was the rice. The rice taste in general, was good. I just cannot stand when they add frozen mixed veggies or Veg-all in the rice. Not everyone enjoys peas and green beans in their Mexican rice. They should consider removing the veggies and leaving it nice and simple. 

The corn pico de gallo, I thought was a disappointment. I saw the pictures on yelp and couldn't wait to have some with tortilla chips. When I ordered it, it was also very bland. 

Finally, the beans! I love beans and personally, I thought they weren't smashed enough and they too were bland as well. 

I'm not sure how long Cilantro Tacos has been in business's but I believe that if they tweak a few things around, I may rate them higher on another occasion when I'm in town.  We'll see.",oidojaIbfy67N63xP96baw,0,0,3,CPDk1400TsVHAv8ZzklMOg
5204435,2013-12-08,2,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"Visit was 12/06 for lunch.  Upon walking in the place smelled like a backed up sewer. We almost walked out but were hungry so we just ordered.  We ordered a carne asada burrito, tacos and the cilantro fries with carne asada.  Tried to order fish tacos but they were out of fish?!?!  So we ordered the shrimp tacos and a chicken tamale. They serve complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa is tasty. The carne asada burrito and tacos were good, the fries were soggy and overly greasy.  The shrimp tacos were nothing spectacular and the chicken tamale was flavorful and very, very spicy.  Last and the deal breaker on going back to this place. There is a salsa bar and we found a hair in our salsa. We told the gentleman who took our order and delivered the food about it and he was very non caring.  He didn't even ask which salsa. I had to give him the container that we served the salsa in to get it off the table.",AmwIIooGA9lbcXafML5xzQ,0,0,2,JMtRaAVESlydWZmSyxnM-Q
5234755,2015-02-20,0,SRCepG6PbMvwKcfIUjk8bQ,"Being a San Diego native and growing up on a steady diet of Mexican fare, the burrito bar has been set pretty high for me. Add to that the fact that I'm vegetarian, and therefore, by definition picky and hard to please, and you've got yourself a serious burrito snob. Moving to Vegas was akin to moving to hell (and not just because of the similar temperatures) - the absolute void of decent taquerias was truly disheartening. I've since found a few reliable places, and recently decided to try Cilantro Tacos after discovering, to my delight, that my prayers had been answered, and a Mexican restaurant that DELIVERS had moved in nearby. I tried to order my usual: a beans, cheese, rice, & french fry burrito, in So Cal style, but they felt it would be to tricky to work some of those fries into the mix, so I settled for just a bean, cheese, & rice burrito. I was pleased to find that their food had good flavor, their salsas were tasty, and the tortillas and chips were pretty decent quality. Nothing to write home about, but still a solid, pleasant Mexican meal that certainly satisfied the burrito craving. Had they just added those french fries, they would have replaced the Roberto's down the street as my best friend forever! That minor disappointment won't keep me from coming back, however... nothing beats Mexican food being delivered to your door when you're a few drinks in & don't want to leave the house. Just stick to the menu, and leave the special orders for somewhere that will try just a little bit harder to please.",VVp0HQkDQwcRc8esb9_VIg,0,0,4,-wf_TOEG0YEynleSUlzjxA

Once 6+ months ago - ate in, had the lunch special of two tacos and drink ($7.95), and carried out a al pastor platter ($10.95) just the other day. I noticed that maybe they do not have the lunch special anymore (?) - It was not offered on the menu. My first visit was good - I had a steak and al pastor taco, came with rice and beans and the drink was an pineapple aqua fresca which was surprisingly the highlight of the entire meal. The tacos were good and the value was great. This last visit-carryout was not a good experience-food wise. Service was great both times. The quality of the al pastor was below par in my opinion. Not sure I will return. I only ate half of the al pastor platter - threw out the rest - there was something gritty in there, I kept picking things out of my teeth. In my book (of a non waster), that says a lot. It was not good.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,0,0,2,vX85bwjCqXIIapqSKkra1Q

It's pretty inexpensive at the moment.. so that was a huge plus although we kept adding on food.
