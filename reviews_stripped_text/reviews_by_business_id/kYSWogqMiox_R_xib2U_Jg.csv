527580,2011-09-09,0,kYSWogqMiox_R_xib2U_Jg,This is now called La Fogata.  They still make your all american breakfast right which is great because that's what we came in for. The bacon was very meaty which I like and pancakes where tasty. My husband ordered a Mexican breakfast and thought it was exquisite. Thx! Gave it a four star because I can't do 3 1/2,j5svaUwC_XZ5snEsaIKTKA,0,1,4,qWVDaKEax9u8cO2qf4LCPg

There are few diners/cafes in my area that can put sear marks on their steaks as well as this place. The char marks can elevate an otherwise ordinary piece of meat to the next level. Under char and it's only window dressing without the complex enhancement of the flavor. Over char and it's just a burnt piece of meat. Do it just right and it becomes heaven on the end of a fork. Proper charring is fairly common in mid to high end steakhouses, but somewhat rare in my experience at a diner. My steak was of very good quality and perfectly trimmed of fat. Those little bits of fat when charred crispy is what really takes the steak over the top. Low end chain steakhouses can't buy the well marbled cuts or it would price them out of their category. No amount of perfect charring or saucing can save a substandard cut of meat. It's like putting an expensive saddle on a dead horse, you're still going nowhere fast. The magic only happens when the fat within the cut renders down and hits the hot griddle. Country Cafe selects cuts that are normally outside of their category to our great advantage. Hats off to them. I always order my steaks on the rare side and most diners don't have the burners turned up hot enough to give it the proper grill marks without overcooking the steak. Just as a cook/chef can have a random ""off"" day, he or she might have an occasional ""good"" day. I went back the next day to test if my meal the day before was skill or luck. I am happy to report, the man responsible for my meal is a Grillmaster. The reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars, rather than the 4.5 that I can't post, is because of the location. It's a bit out of the way for the average tourist, but is still so well worth the effort.",j65GWa1xFRWcQxQXllVglQ,2,1,4,p4xzAblV_7sYnKudFCo0Vw

I was excited to try this place after good reviews on Yelp and eating at the same location when it was Manuels, the Mexican place. However, when we arrived, we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. It then took an additional 10 mins for our waitress (the oldest lady there) to even acknowledge us and get drink orders. After placing our order, we finally received our food after a 20 minute wait. To add insult to injury, our order was all wrong (ie No gravy included on the chicken dish, tomatoes when none were requested,etc). The final slap in the face was paying $50 for a family of 4 to eat there. Your better off going to Dennys or IHOP.",fBalMm0kNjrf907OOeu1lw,0,0,1,Y2_FxHzpbthkPC1vEhpy1w

1572955,2010-02-06,1,kYSWogqMiox_R_xib2U_Jg,"I have been in Vegas for about 4 months and have been in search of a local restaurant like what in California. This place is near my home and I had read some good reviews but, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.

I had the open-faced turkey and mashed potatoes. The turkey was mostly dark meat - which I do not like - and it was dry. The mashed potatoes had hardened a bit, like they were left under a warming lamp. The vegetables were dry and tasteless. I ended up leaving most of the meal uneaten. It was a shame because I so love turkey and mashed potatoes.

My husband had some kind of scramble - eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc. He said it was not very good and he also left most of it uneaten.

Overall, it was just a bad experience and one I will not be repeating.",wt6CYydQUWRR4UQfzdcnuQ,0,0,2,wjG8RgEvldIw3cPPF88A8Q
2044772,2008-01-06,0,kYSWogqMiox_R_xib2U_Jg,"Good southern-style country cooking, just like the name implies.  People are friendly, though waitress was a little slow.  Okay - a lot slow.  But at least she was friendly.  Be forewarned, they stop serving breakfast early, like around 10.  The neighborhood is a little sketchy too - park so you can keep an eye on your car.  Oh, and the owner dude was trying to show me a picture of a whale shark and was telling us it was a giant catfish.  Doesn't anybody read anymore?  I mean, who can't tell a whale shark from a catfish?  People are getting increasingly stupider.  But at least these dudes can cook.",N8j2-22fGnRFDXGo16pNwQ,3,1,4,t2Aq7JTN0I0ZRpuVRoAd3g

id like to of had a beer with my lunch but they only had rootbeer.
and the place did smell a little odd, kind of like a bathroom maybe it was the cleaning products?? it would be a lot nicer if they served beer and had the place smelling like the food theyre cooking.
although this nellis location is closer, i liked the older location better.",m0aeKCg9AAvwvnKUf1Evcw,1,1,3,up44yHqcJmyk5Q9qGZVJ1Q

We ordered breakfast-I had the 12oz NY steak breakfast special,the wife had potato & onion pancakes with applesauce and the boy had biscuits & sausage gravy.

Like having a home cooked meal.Only better-No cooking or dishes!!

The food was better than expected-the potato pancakes were ""to die for"" and the biscuits & gravy was fresh. The steak was charbroiled to perfection(medium rare). The coffee was strong & fresh.

SOLID 4 stars!:)",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,14,9,4,CjiBCATKYd7PKimAuOZI2Q
