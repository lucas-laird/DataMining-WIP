I am not a big fan of beef, but I would not mind going back when I am back in Vegas for work.  By the way, the service was excellent as well.

This place is so unique.  You won't find a place quite like it anywhere else; I can't emphasize enough that I'm impressed with the originality of Bachi Burger, it shines from concept to execution.  The service was also superb; the food came out in a timely manner and the servers filled my drink just after taking a couple sips.  Why give this place 4 stars?

I ordered the Pork Belly steamed buns and a side of the salt and pepper fries. I love their fries it was perfectly seasoned and had a kick to it because of the jalapenos. The pork belly steamed buns was okay the cilantro kind of over powered the flavor. My daughter ordered the kids Bachi burger which came with regular fries, carrots, and apple slices.

The waitstaff was on top of their game and even as the place filled up the waiters managed to make sure our glasses were full and we had what we needed. As with other trips we ordered the oxtail fries which are one of my favorite things on the planet. This time they were a bit underwhelming but still good. We also ordered the duck steamed buns which were cold when they arrived but still good, particularly the dipping sauce. We split a Kiki burger which was very good but not nearly as good as blue and green.

90415,2012-10-20,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"First time with the Summerlin location, but not with Bachi Burger. I brought my famished friends from L.A. here after they made the drive to visit me. Naturally, I had to give them a tour from the local's POV, starting off with getting them fed properly.

I can't speak on behalf of my friends, but the fact that they were finished every bite speaks for itself. Or... they could've just been hungry, but they seemed quite satisfied so I'll leave it at that.

Had the kalbi burger and I gotta say that it hit my burger craving right on the head. Though it only made a small dent in my Korean food craving, the burger itself was cooked medium and was moist and tender as it should be. The kimchi wasn't too overpowering and blended well with the gochujang mayo.

Between the five of us, we split an order of truffle parmesan fries and sweet potato fries. Personally, I like the sweet potato fries more, but I'm working on discerning the truffle flavor. The aiolis are matched well with their respective fries.

98392,2012-10-28,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"PROS: The service was great and the place was very clean and inviting.  Ordered the oxtail chili fries and kimchi burger.  The portion of the oxtail fries was great, they give you a lot, so you'll definitely be full afterwards.  The kimchi burger also had great sauce and the buns they used tasted great.

CONS: First off, I was turned off by the fact that the oxtail chili fries had barely any oxtail meat in it (but had lots of fries).  For around $13, you'd expect a little more.  If they're trying to save money, they'd might as well use a cheaper cut of meat and give the customer more bang for their buck.  Second, the burger didn't come with fries.  Again, for around $10, you'd expect a little more.  I know this place is supposed to be ""gourmet,"" but I can easily buy a burger of equal quality at Cheesecake Factory and get fries and complementary bread.  Last, the burger was a little on the burnt side.  I don't know if this was the chef's intention or not, but the surface was charred, not carmelized.  The meat was cooked perfectly, but the outside just tasted a bit off.  Maybe I just came at the wrong time. 

All in all, I was a bit disappointed in this place. I've been looking forward to coming here for ages.  But I'm not giving up yet, and hopefully the next time I come around it'll be better.",hYbciJ5P3rhkfDBnFAigWg,0,0,3,viQ1kyD2MGjhIGcuKJfrKQ

We got our drinks, were seated, and had our appetizer in 30 minutes from arrival (includes the wait time at the bar). The oxtail chili cheese fries were amazing!! Bachi burger's Asian flair on a classic burger is a huge hit! I highly recommend the black and blue burger.

116115,2012-04-27,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I've only been to Bachi Burger once before on the south side of town. Really loved it then... This time it was still fairly good, I guess this branch just opened up, so it's very new and clean. 

I usually get the Kalbi Burger, although for some reason, this one didn't taste as great as the one I had in the south. I had a bite of my mom's Black and Green Burger, which is her favorite, and it also tasted good. I like their variety of fries. So far I've only tasted their Sweet Potato Fries and Salt and Pepper Fries; both very delicious, especially the dipping sauce that comes with.

My only complaint is that this branch was freezing when me and my mom went in. We kept debating whether or not we should just take the food to go, since it was almost unbearable waiting for our food to come out. It was a windy day, so I wasn't expecting the AC to be on that high. 

Anyways, service was great. We had two servers; both were very friendly. 

My only other advice is come here on an empty stomach, because I had eaten a little while before coming in, so I got full pretty fast. 

I definitely plan to come here again. It's much better than driving all the way to the south for Bachi Burger, especially if you're from North LV, like myself. Just bring a light coat, perhaps? ;)",4e6MMvMT_VFEtYXmRRelUA,2,1,4,OPaDCcU5vb3VxCwNZIArXA

The host rushed back to the table and threw the silverware down in hurry to greet the next guests... Next another server brings us waters and throws the straws on the table and takes off .. no interaction at all.. we wait 5 minutes fir another server to take our drink order (mind you there is only 5 other tables seated, and about 5 servers, so why a wait. Idk) he brings back our sodas and takes off... Wtf!! We look over the menu and wait another 5 minutes and yet another server comes to take our food order. We order 2 burgers an order of fries and calamari... The calamari comes out quickly so I feel ok so far... About 7 minutes go by and we finish the calamari and look forward to our burgers, but no server comes to our table. (Keep in mind there are only at this point 5 other tables. The two tables next to us order there burgers when we got the calamari and theres came out 10 minutes before ours) so we wait, and wait. Our server keeps walking past us,not ever glancing over to see that we are ready. Finally after about 20 minutes after we finished the appetizer our burgers (my boyfriend's first, then 2 minutes later mine) comes out. Fries were hot, burgers looked like they were forgotten about and left under heat lamps, and were not that impressive. I never received a soda refill, and we had to flag down a server for the check.

They also had $5 shakes that looked great but we were too full after eating burgers, sharing the chili cheese fries and also Parmesan truffle fries.  We remarked how many crispy shoes strings there were in one $5 order of fries.  The three of us shared it and didn't finish (your mileage may vary).

I know most people don't order this one, but it's a sleeper favorite :)  It's ground chicken/turkey prepared tsukune style with strong flavors of soy sauce and ginger, with an herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and beer battered onion rings.  So incredibly flavorful and delicious!  My husband ordered the Miyagi-san grass fed wagyu burger and declared that he liked mine better!  I liked his too though...the beef was perfectly cooked and the combination of drippy fried egg, caramelized bacon, chili mayo, and onion rings was pretty amazing.  I wasn't a big fan of the Ronin burger.  The regular salt and pepper fries were thin and crispy, just the way I like it, although they could have used a bit more salt.

A couple tables were already eating and one table was having their order taken. We waited at least five minutes before a waiter decided to take our drink orders.  We ordered appetizer fries with the drink order.  We saw our fries sitting on the hot line for awhile before they were brought to us.  And our burgers arrived right after.  So much for an appetizer.  Sadly the service was worse this time and it really doesn't matter how you order your burger temp ...med , med well and well done are all cooked med rare.  The service is slow and inattentive.  If I am paying 15$ for a burger I expect better than 2$ burger service.  I am always shocked when waiters and waitresses expect big tips when you have to practically beg for an order to be taken, drink refills are ignored and the waiter doesn't bother to see how the food is before the bill is left!

First off, Garlic. Parmesan. Truffle FRIES. Best one I've had yet. The truffle oil/sauce they sprinkle over the fries are just so delicious.. and the tomato dipping sauce? Damn.

I pretty much breathed the truffle fries in, cause it was so good lol I ordered the Black & Greens burger with wagyu beef (grass fed beef) and it was definitely a noticeably good quality beef. And the way they marinated brought out so much (asian) flavor on top of the caramelized onions and mushrooms.. I could barely finish it cause how filling it was (I also blame the fries). My gf got the Miso burger I think and it tasted more like a Korean burger lol very sweet and spicy, super flavorful. (I preferred my burger more lol)

We came to this location cause it's less packed, yes it's farther but it was worth the 0 minute wait. and very spacious seating and parking outside too!",AGSwtErbSLn5EAycJKVM6g,0,0,4,7yBmBRfMYDCtgn4rllCO3g

This place does fusion right by taking it seriously and putting tons of detail into everything on their menu. The ingredients are fresh and diverse. All the items on the menu have a unique taste which makes you want to try everything on the menu at least once. 

If you are not a burger person that is fine, they have great non-beef options like the crusty-crab burger and the salmon burger. Both are great and possibly healthier alternatives to the normal beef burger. Also the Pork Belly Buns are freaking amazing and really make you doubt getting a burger when you could have those. All the burgers I have tried are great especially the special ones that are not included on the menu. 

If you go and it is your first time you have to order the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. They could just serve those and I would keep going back for more.

263559,2013-12-08,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"On Nov. 29, 2013, Fri, we were extremely excited to dine at Bachi Burger since it would be our first time.  And to say that we were satisfied with our meal is to say the least.  We were not disappointed with the food, the burgers were really good and the steamed buns with pork belly was awesome.  However, the appetizers were ok...nothing exciting.  I would actually give the food a 4.5 stars.

Now on to the service...this is the reason for the 1 star.  I am TRUELY upset with the service of the Summerlin location.  The wait time to be seated was decent.  After we were seated and finally ordered our food, we waited 45 mins to just be served our appetizers.  The restaurant wasn't even crowded, there was still a station that was closed and they were not seating anyone there.  We were so hungry by the time we got our food, we excitedly ate it and enjoyed it very much.  So we didn't even notice that we did not get our calamari.  Being satisfied and full, we paid our $159.99 bill, along with the automatic 18% gratuity of $26.64, totalling $186.63 and left. When we got home, I had looked at the receipt and realized that we never received our $12 calamari appetizer.  With that, I called Bachi Burger right away to let them know what had happened and the hostess that answered the call said that they were TOO BUSY to have me talk to the restaurant manager and that she would have him call me back later on that night when they slowed down.  So of course I waited and did not receive a call back.  I then called on Saturday when they opened and was able to speak to the restaurant manager, PHYROM.  I told him what had happened and explained that I had called the night before and let him know that we not receive our calamari appetizer.  He then started to interrogate me as to why I did not bring it up when we were there.  I explained that we were excited about being there, extremely hungry due to our 45 min wait, and then being satisfied at the end.  In not so many words, he basically accused me of lying about it.  REALLY?!!!! I would seriously call that night and then the next day to lie about not getting our appetizer.  If the appetizer was say $5 I could care less about calling back but this was the most expensive item on our bill.  All PHYROM kept saying was ""you have to understand my point, why did you not tell us at the time of your meal that you did not receive your appetizer?""  I basically told him that all I want is to get the $12 refund and that's it.  I guess PHYROM got tired of my complaining so he said that he would research it and give me a call back on Monday, Dec. 2nd.  

So today is Dec 7th and I still haven't gotten a call back from PHYROM.  So I guess his answer to me is ""you're one family and your satisfaction doesn't matter us"".  So my answer back is a BIG MIDDLE FINGER TO YOU AND YOUR RESTAURANT CAUSE I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!!!!

Kiki Burger - it was okay.  Nothing really too good about it but nothing bad either.  I tried it for the mushroom, I was in a mushroom mood.  I did like the kimchi from the Kalbi Burger (it was served on the side in a little dish).  I didn't get to try that burger.

We finally tried it and were not particularly impressed. Don't get me wrong, the burger was quite good and tasty but not $16 tasty. This place is what I call a ""hipster foo-foo"" restaurant...they cater to those who want their kind of atmosphere. That's fine but we look for good taste and quality food. My wife had a $9 appetizer which consisted of two meatballs so our total bill for a hamburger, fries, and two meatballs (no drinks), was $34. 

My wife's meatballs were tasty but without all the kale and other unknown, inedible stuff they used for garnish artistically placed on the plate, they would have looked quite plain. I asked if they made their own fries and the waiter said they do but that was not true. I was given a frozen product which was pretty good for what it was but I do not like it when a restaurant brags about it's homemade food then give me French fries they bought frozen in a bag. 

It was also VERY loud...there were people yelling and whooping it up the entire time we were there so we couldn't speak to each other. 

In short, we found Bachi Burger to be quite overrated. If  atmosphere is more important than the food and you are a ""hipster dude"", this may be the place for you.

I guess you can say that finding new places to eat is our common interest. Bachi Burger is a burger restaurant with an Asian fusion taste. They offer all the milk shakes burgers (of course) sandwiches and also salads all with an Asian spin to it. Once I found out about this place I had to find out a little more. 
I went onto their website and I must say that it was horrible. I don't know if their web designer decided to stop working on it or maybe they don't know about this issue. The web page does nothing but play music. You are unable to enter anything on their web page. I wasn't able to look at their menu, but we still decided to try it out.  Once we got to the restaurant (Sahara location) there hostess was a young lady who seemed to enjoy her job. She sat us down right away; a man gave us a glass of water but didn't say much, which made it a little weird. Finally after waiting, which wasn't very long by the way, our waiter came to get our drink order. She was very friendly but never introduced herself, which to me I like to know who I'm speaking too. Everything was great food was amazing and the meat was cooked just who we order it, a lot of places don't cook the burger just right. Our waiter came around and checked on us, and always kept our drinks full. When we got our check, we were never told that the lemonade that my boyfriend orders was not free refills, or else when she came around to refill we would have thought twice about or intake on the beverages.  We got charged for 2 lemonades at $4.50 each almost $10 for lemonade that's a little crazy if you ask me. Over all everything was great. 
I would recommend this place to all my friends and family, they have a great staff that is friendly and honestly one of the best burgers I have had. Just make sure that you see if your drinks are free refills or not, most other places let you know if there is a charge for another drink.",k_SpZqcMp2MVzt14Yzk8vQ,0,0,4,5IDEUUhB6J9i3B49YNECUw

Not the ambience, not the service -- which, to be fair, were both perfectly fine in my book though I've read some criticisms. The dining area is small and crowded so there may be a wait during peak hours. And this isn't your run-of-the-mill burger joint so the prices are higher. That being said, whoever came up with these delicious burgers infused with Asian ingredients certainly knows what they're doing. 

This was my first time so I went big. Really big. Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13) is a tower of burger perfection, much as the other options I saw pass our table appeared to be. The toppings on this one are chili mayo, fried egg, furikake (a Japanese condiment that includes sesame seeds), caramelized bacon, and onion rings that are lightly breaded and crisp.

I was staying at Mandalay Bay and from there it was about a 10 min taxi ride which was about 10 miles but there was very little traffic and its way off the strip in a tiny strip mall.  We saw this place on Food Networks- Diners Driveins and Dives and had to try- btw all the TVs in the joint were tuned to Food Network- wonder why?  :)

The wait was well worth it. When we were sat down we ordered a drink, I just got an iced green tea which was perfect and refreshing. Bummed they had very little selction of sweeteners but whatever.  They had a TON of drink items to choose from such as thai tea, passionfruit, boba etc.  Love the Asian drinks!
We started with appetizers of:

Pork Belly Steamed Buns- yummy but only came with 3 small buns and a hoisin based dip sauce, the pork belly melted in your mouth, but for our party of 4- not a lot to go around
Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries- delicious. your basic skinny fry with a pop. had jalapenos so they were spicy as well as a mayonaise dip sauce. I woudl have preferred the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries- saw other ppl order they looked good!
Chili Fried Chicken- My favorite- well seasoned crispy and a mayonaise based spicy dipping sauce- perfect accompaniment

I also got the Spicy Miso Burger.  I love miso but I barely tasted it in this burger. This burger was the reason I deducted a star. (If I could give 3.5 stars I would have but I rounded up) It was well-cooked and beautiful looking but nothing special. The egg was cooked over hard and I barely tasted garlic or the Shisito peppers (which I am nuts for).   My friend got a Banh Mi burger that was waaaay more flavorful.

Overall a very positive experience. I am from LA where trendy burger places are rampant- so it takes a lot to impress me- this was good and the asian fusion was a nice twist from the regular ole- 5 guys, The Counter and Umami.",hFFlX1u4X4E4WInq-fznuw,0,0,4,tOf_LNPvg_dd0vIl4-PJ5Q

507358,2013-07-03,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"We were a party of 10 on Tuesday night originally going to the Windmill location, but with a broken AC, went to the one on Sahara instead.  There was no wait, and the restaurant was about 1/3 full.  The service was great - waters were never empty and plates were cleared accordingly.  Our server made sure everyone's burger was cooked at the right temp (asked us to cut it open to see).  Also, with such a large party, I was impressed that the food runners knew exactly which burger was whose (I think it's so tacky to bring food to the table and ""auction"" it off). 

On to the food.  We shared the oxtail fries, sweet potato fries, and truffle parm fries.  A member of our party commented that the oxtail fries tasted ""like fries with canned chili on top"".  I thought they were over salted and were nothing special.  The sweet potato fries were good (but Boiling Crab still has the best in town) - thick cut, seasoned perfectly.  The yuzu aioli, however, didn't quite compliment the savory-sweetness of the fries.  The truffle parm fries were a huge letdown.  I love truffle and was expecting to taste a little truffle flavor in each bite.  I got zero truffle flavor.  The mushroom cream drizzled on top was reminiscent of stove top mushroom gravy made in the microwave.  The tomato aioli, while good on its own, added nothing to the fries.  If the fries were truffle and cheesey enough, I don't think it would need any kind of sauce to accompany it. 

I got the Kalbi burger and my bf got the Kiki burger.  The meat was of great quality and cooked perfectly.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttered.  I really wish I loved the burgers (everyone else in the party did), but I really did not think they were anything special.  The Kalbi burger tasted like a burger slathered with kalbi sauce with some kim chee on top.  The Kiki burger tasted like a lot of bland.  All the ingredients sounded like it should have come together to make a great flavor combo, but it just didn't work.  I didn't even know there was caramelized onion, bacon, and guyere chesse on it until I looked back on the menu!  I thought it was just meat, lettuce, and some mushrooms. 

The price isn't considered cheap either.  $5 for frozen fries drizzled with stove top mushroom gravy does not a happy girl make. 

All in all, kudos for trying to come up with a fusion burger place, but at the end of the day, the flavors (or lack thereof) just didn't work.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,0,0,2,ardO-SEAqJZlWGE-GcbLmA

I told her the drink tasted horrible like matcha mix and tap water and I did not want to drink it, because it did not taste good. She was extremely rude and I asked to talk to a manager. As a former food server, I know that removing an item from the bill is no biggie. I saw the manager coming over to our table and  I thought the problem would be rectified. The manager was rude and confrontational, instead of fixing the problem he actually made things worse; but eventually decided to take the $4.00 item off of our bill. The excitement my husband, son and I initially felt walking into the place subsided after all of this hoopla over a drink. We felt unwanted, negative vibes the entire time we were there.

I find it hard to understand why the management of this restaurant would promote this type of info to be given to its customers, or how, on a Friday night, they would not have enough staff to handle any expected or unexpected increase in volume.

Another customer asked the hostess if they were saving tables for a large party or something & she said ""no, we're just backed up"". 20 more mins went by & more tables became available- still they were not cleared & no one was seated. The hostess was rolling silverware & doing other side work instead of trying her best to get people seated. After 45 mins of waiting, we counted 12 empty tables & only one other party had been seated. 

Having worked in restaurants in the past, it is unacceptable to me to have a hostess doing side work when there are seating issues. It should not take more than 10 mins to get empty tables cleared & people seated, especially a party of 2 like us. If you are short staffed, the hostess can help bus tables to get your wait times down. 

I can't review the food or waitstaff service because we decided to leave after waiting for nearly an hour & still not being seated. I'm loathe to give this place another shot after this experience.",chmCqCIB7K1EtcRrYuom4g,2,0,1,1zX_pg5c6JtbaK1ePdW4Eg

I got Kiki's burger and I have to say I eat a lot of burgers and this is a top 3 burger of all time for me. It was cooked perfectly (mushrooms galore and beautiful carmelized onions) and assembled so well that nothing fell off the burger or out of the bun. I also had the oxtail fries, which melted in my mouth. Oxtail needs to be cooked for a very long time or in a pressure cooker and Bachi does it right. I love how the fuse together food genres like Hawaiian and American, Jamaican and Asian. I cannot wait to try another burger. They will not disappoint. Overall, service is fast with a Nice wait staff. Prices are a little above average but these burgers are gourmet. I only have one issue with the restaurant.

This recent visit was kind of strange. I believe our waitress was trying to be sneaky by casually getting my kids to order extra toppings on the burger. My kids didn't realize that each addtl topping cost $1.50-2.00. She asked my son if he wanted ""everything"" on the burger. He said yes. But I immediately stopped that transaction and politely said that he will only add the cheese. I can only imagine that my bill would've been $20/burger. I don't know if she was annoyed that we only ordered water; thus lowering our bill and her potential tip. I don't know. Only speculating.

This was my second time at this location, though my family had never been. We thoroughly enjoyed both our food and service, as well as the ambience of the location.

Shortly after we entered, we were greeted by the seating host, who kindly showed us to our table. We were seated near the kitchen, which was a real treat because we got to see where the magic happened as we waited for our food. They have a wide array of beverages, both alcoholic and not, to cater to people with all kinds of tastes. I ordered the Thai iced tea, which was simply heavenly.

We skipped out on appetizers, which--after seeing how delicious they looked--rang through as a clear mistake. The burgers offered at this restaurant are unlike any I've ever seen in my years of burger-devouring: fresh, unique, and packed full of extraordinary flavor combinations. I ordered the Black & Green burger, which was cooked and prepared to perfection; it included spinach, bacon, blue cheese, and some of the best sautéed mushrooms I've ever tasted. The bun itself perfectly complemented the burger, in both taste and texture.

A majority of the burgers on the menu unfortunately don't include fries, though their selection of fries is godly. My particular favorites are the Truffle Parmesan fries and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries. Each is served in a massive cone with some highly delectable condiments, including their homemade pineapple ketchup.

922532,2014-07-29,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I'm from LA. We went last week on Friday ( 3 of us, after we picked our friend who's local) around 2:00 pm. We were seated immediately, put in our order, got the food quickly, good burger( had better and worse ones). I paid and we left. As walking to my car, I realised I don't have my sunglasses. I immediately walked back (within 40 seconds) and told the host I'm back for my glasses and pointed out were we were sitting (2 tables behind his podium). It was all cleaned ( I'm thinking, WOW, fast service). So he goes to the back towards the kitchen( 4-5 tables away) and talks to couple of people and returns with no glasses. So I doubted myself, I went back to the car and searched with no luck. Went back to the restaurant and asked the host to look again. He went back again, asked and returned empty. He then pulled a square plastic container and pulled a woman's glasses but not mine. He said ""sorry sir, I don't have it and no one in the back has seen ANY glasses. So I gave him my cell and asked him to call if anyone turns it in,and btw, it's PRADA ... $450. But I was so confused now that even asked my friend to we go back to his house and look there. We did, but, NO glasses. We left to gas station. As pumping, I pulled out the receipt and called the number. A lady picked up the phone and after explaining, she asked me the server's name... Haha, I looked at my receipt... ""PHYRON"" I said proudly and with high hopes. ""SORRY, NO ONE has seen any glasses"" she said. By now, frustrated and deeply disappointed,  I got little angry as it was not making sense, so I spoke slightly louder. She immediately said..""Oh wait a second, your glasses are here"".... I was ""WOW"" I'll be there in few. 
I went back. Asked the host and he directed me to the back ( this back area is not enclosed, it's visible and open to everyone). A lady/waitress??  working on the monitor pulled my glasses from "" a square plastic container"" and gave me my glasses. I asked to see the manager and me. PEREZ??, I think, young tall guy approached who so happened  to be in the back right next to her. 
I explained to him the situation and asked him why my glasses we not found shortly after my table was cleaned, since sun glasses do not end up with the utensils , and why did I have to come back twice , call , then come back the third time. Even thought from my seat to the host and to the back is oh 40 feet. He said he doesn't know and it was a miscommunication issue at the LOST AND FOUND DEPARTMENTS. REALLY??? ..... Read that again. Man, were was I , at a department  store?? Wow, I felt lost in their lost and found department. He forgot my table was 30-40 feet from his DEPARTMENT , not 30-40 floors. 
I told him that was not cool....He said HE WAS SORRY THAT I FELT THAT WAY.... With a careless posture, standing tall, hands behind his back , and looking up then down with no eye contact to me....Amazing!!!!!! He didn't even apologise for their mistake!!!! What an unprofessional manager. And btw, I mentioned my bill with 20% tip. He asked me to come back and he would give us better service . Better service???? Shouldn't the service be at best to begin with???? I didn't know what else to tell him and left. 

Everyone, I'm not a difficult customer and I tip well.  I think who ever cleaned the table was VERY AWARE of the glass and didn't bring it out till perhaps found out that I was not giving up. 
I just think managers like him who work in good restaurants MUST be more courteous to their patrons and always remember, there is YELP and other social media reviews. If they care. We are going back this weekend to Vegas again. Wish he was pleasant and professional, i  would've recommended my friends( this time 16 of us) to go back and eat there again. Well, to be even FAIR, I hope the management reads my review and replies. 
4 star for food,the chef, and the front host.  
 1 star for the manager, waiter, and the bus-boy if there was one. 
For now, I'm glad they didn't get the chance to steal and keep my glasses.",xxDUv5pUzH88Cesp8eq_uw,2,0,2,yoCPndE0lwF4qpidtgC2nw

This is an account of my most recent visit.  Four of us arrived around 1:00 after hiking at Red Rock and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.  Our waiter asked us if we had ever been there before.  He then explained the concept, how their burgers are cooked and some of the ingredients.  Over the course of the meal he checked in with us often but not too often.

We ordered the brussels sprouts and oxtail chili cheese fries as appetizers and each got a burger, one Ronin, two Kiki and a Lonely Bird.  Everything was delightful with one exception.  One of my friends had ordered her burger well done, and when it came it was very pink in the center.  We convinced her to send it back (she's always hesitant).  A new, perfectly cooked burger was produced in minutes, and she pronounced it delicious.  About ten minutes later, the waiter set a Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow shake on the table in front of her and said ""from the chef"".  We each in turn tried it and orgasmed right at the table.

When we were seated we were given water right away and asked if we wanted anything else to drink and that's when everything went bad.

Now, I understand when a place is busy and you might have to wait a few minutes or even remind your waiter you're ready, but when you have a bunch of people in the back who give the appearance of not doing anything but chatting and just walking around is not acceptable. 
Once we finally ordered our food from our server who apologized for the wait, we thought that everything would be OK from there. Again we were wrong. We decided to try the oxtail fries, spicy miso burger, and the miyagi. The oxtail fries were alright and landed up being the only appetizing part of our meal. The miyagi burger was just OK. It was pretty greasy and I could barely taste any of the bacon. The spicy miso burger was not good at all. It was not remotely spicy and after eating less than half the burger, it started to taste really soggy. We opened the burger up and the meat was just falling apart and looked like mush. It was more rare than medium. At this point, it was about an hour that we had been there. We didn't want to send the burger back for fear of having to wait longer when we just wanted to leave. 
Finally the check came and again we waited another ten minutes before my girlfriend had to hail the waitress to ring us out. She apologized again but at this point, apologies didn't mean anything. 
We might've just come here on an ""off"" night but even off nights have some redeeming quality. I will not be coming back to this place ever and was very disappointed.",iZ9dGTZV2Vu1bnajLWFymw,11,2,2,VNIwfUc8wcmNxbOo4jW5DQ

     Just felt like it was a little over priced for what they gave me. I ordered the ""Ronin"" Burger and a side of Parmesan fries. Everything is Ala Carte here so you pay for it separate. I've always felt that was a crappy thing to do for an up-charge. 
      
     My burger tasted good, but for 10 bucks you think you would of had more beef in it. I was still hungry when I left. None of the flavors really made me any kind of impression on me. Instead of ketchup they gave me what looked like tomato paste for the dipping sauce of the fries. It wasn't good.
    
     I'm a huge burger fan and I felt like this place just takes gourmet burgers a little too far. Is a burger even really Gourmet in the first place?

So if your bill is kind of high like this I wouldn't really care if the food was good (which I had last year  and it was great), and service is also great.  Service was HORRIBLE.  I understand people get busy and they need to help other tables, but this lady was rude and non helpful through our whole experience.   First off this place doesn't have anyone working the hostess stand.  This lady came out of know where and yelled at my mom and was very rude to her about how long we had to wait and that was that.  I was pissed and wanted to go somewhere else, but my mom insist we stayed.  Unfortunately we got this chick that yelled at my mom for a server!!!!

She took over 15 minutes to order our food.  People sat down after us and ordered and got their food before we even ordered.  It took forever to get our food, our drinks including a soda (from the time we ordered our drinks, she said the shakes will take a while but the fountain coke also took 10 minutes too).  Overall the food was good, but I was so pissed I ended up hating it and couldn't enjoy it at all.  I'm so mad that we went there when I already got a bad taste from the wait time and that lady barking at us.  I suggest if you want to go here, go to fuku burger.  If your going to spend $75 on 2 burgers, 1 kids burger and a salad, at least at fuku you will get better service.  Or you might not get that disgruntle employee from bachi.

On April 7, 2015, I took my girlfriend and visited the Summerlin, Nevada location and was not very impressed with anything.  It is safe to say I was very disappointed.  

Let me first state that when I selected the lunch special (a three course meal), I was told that we were prohibited from sharing the meal.  We never eat much anyway and usually share one lunch every where we go and have never been told at any other place we could not do this.  I was instructed to add another Entry or pick another selection.  As if this was bad enough but I was hungry so I complied not wanting to embarrass my girlfriend by leaving.  Second, the assistant waiter did not know hot tea was not an option and delayed getting me a drink and eventually brought me a cold tea.  The meals came out and were burnt on one side.  I mean the crab cake appetizer and the burger.  I did not send them back since my lunch hour was almost over by this point.  We got the desert to go and it was some form of parfait that they just dumped into a to go box without any other container.  How sanitary was that.  I filled out the satisfaction survey at the restaurant and got attitude from the main waiter since I not only gave the wait staff low scores but the presentation of the food as well.  They rushed me out as quickly as possibly because they were upset.

The dark bamboo decor  is very reminiscent of many sushi spots in the valley, but that's where things get remixed (reee-mixmixmixmixmix)  I just remixed the remix in case your mind was blown.  

A diverse selection of beers and sakes go very well with the Asian influences on this well-executed burger joint.  They have offerings from Rogue, Dogfish Head, Sapporo, and a few other Japanese breweries I wasn't familiar with.  

A very nice waitress informed me of her favorites, and I chose to take her (and many other yelper's) advice.  My order:

Fried Chicken Appetizer - Similar to orange chicken at many Americanized Chinese restaurants, these little morsels were lightly breaded and flavored with ginger, garlic, and shoyu.  I thought these were good but I wouldn't rush to order them again.

Kiki Buger - Shitake, Enoki, and Enigii mushrooms with caramelized onions, a delicious bacon marmalade, and an aged gruyere.  A very delicious burger for sure, I got mine medium and it was cooked exactly to my request.  

**Bachi uses a soy/ponzu base with all it's burgers, so expect a ""Japanese"" flavor more than what you would get at any other Hamburger place. I thought it was very tasty, and welcomed it as a refreshing change from the typical flavors of the beef elsewhere. 


Fries w/ sea salt - Average and forgettable.  However, the fries were served with a pineapple ketchup that was delicious.  I've heard of flavored ketchups, but this was my first experience, and I'm convinced.  If you see pineapple or banana ketchup on a menu, don't listen to your friends, they're jealous, and not as cool as you are, just get it and you'll be happy.

Since it takes a plane ride to eat here, we made sure to order and share so we could try as many different things as possible.
The burgers come on a light and fluffy bun...almost like a sweet bread and are piled high.  I was worried that these would be one of those impossible to bite burgers but once you push the top bun down, it's totally manageable.  Spicy Miso, Miyagi-san's Grass fed Wagyu, Banh-Mi, Kalbi, and Kiki's burger were all sampled.  I loved them all except the Kiki.  I don't know what it was but something just didn't agree with my taste buds.  The burgers mentioned above were so different in flavor that it's impossible to individually review them all.  Just know that they're all good and you'll just need to try them all to find your favorite.  We also tried the oxtail chili cheese fries...delicious!  The shakes are really good too.  I tried the salted caramel marshmallow.  So, SO good.

For some reason our server wasn't on top of her game.  Tables that sat after us had food before we did.  Our burgers came out first and our server said she'd bring our fries out right away, but then she started clearing the plates from her other table first.

Service: 5/5.

On both occasions that I've come here, I was assisted by Bobby, a young fellow who is well educated of the food and drinks provided as well as helpful in recommendations of other burgers. He seemed dedicated to keeping your drinks filled up and letting all of the newcomers know what they're eating (it's fusion, you might find it to be a little weird). Only catch is that he did take awhile on the check, but he was the only person working the tables and you can't really blame him.

Atmosphere: 5/5

On both occasions, the place was not loud like most places seemed to be, no screaming kids, no loud conversations, no tinking and crashes of the silverware, just  unique music and a mellow atmosphere feeling. The place is clean and organized and original art is hung up on the walls throughout the restaurant. It is never overcrowded and there is never a wait on a table. 

Food: 7/5

The food is PERFECT. The bun, soft like a warm donut, the unique flavors within the buns, things like fried egg, onion, peppers and sauces. You will be caught off guard by the flavors of your food. I had the Spicy Miso burger on both occasions and was impressed both times, not to mention it looked appetizing. The garlic fries, skinny,  with jalapeno slices in it, and a hint of lime, with a side of a sauce that you don't know what it is but you can't get enough of it. It's all there. It's perfect. I can't necessarily say much, you just have to try for yourself. Just a heads up, the way they cook it is a bit weird so if you typically eat a medium cooked burger, get a medium well.",lkcyRPkigSNZRfEaqdHAdw,1,0,5,q6ye-gymcWVbT2APo2hmtw

The oxtail fries were different. Never thought of using oxtails for the meat in chili, but why not? However, all in all, I will likely not return because the service was very, very slow. I couldn't understand why we had to wait 20 minutes (or longer) to be served the beer we ordered. The food started coming before we got our beer.

That goofy, blond guy made all the food seem so good, like best shit you will ever put in your mouth good. So I had high expectations.

We got two orders of Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to share among the 7 of us & also an order of the Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns as appetizers. We then ordered our burgers and I am glad that I got to taste not just one burger, but three.

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries ($11.50) - I have an obsession with fries that is pretty unhealthy. But I would not mind clogging my arteries with these fries all day, every day. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about them. The oxtail meat was tender as can be and the chili had a little kick to it which I loved. My cousins and I devoured both orders in seconds. THEY WERE THAT GOOD. Shut up and take my money good.

Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns ($12.50) - It comes with only 3 steamed buns, so my cousins & I just cut them in half. I kinda shoved my half in my mouth so fast that I didn't savor it to the point where I remembered it. I pretty much inhaled it. I remember that it was good though & that I forgot to dip it in the sauce.

ANYWAYS. Onto the good part...

Miyagi Burger ($13) - Ooooh, this burger was good. I only got it because when am I ever going to eat a waygu burger again? Probably never! The patty was medium rare and tender and oh so juicy. The fried egg dripping onto my plate & all over my burger adding an element of flavor and richness to it was the best thing ever. The onion rings were crispy and good. Is your mouth watering yet? Because mine is.

Kiki's Burger ($10) - My cousin ordered this & blessed me with a bite of it. It came with a garlic chili aioli that when spread on the burger before you bit into it tied everything together. The meat was cooked perfectly & was absolutely delicious.

Mr. Ho's Burger ($9.50) - This burger got passed my way so I took a bite. I don't know what the fuck was in it. But it was soooo good. I remember the burger being juicy and sweet.

Overall, the food met my expectations & the service was great. I will be back soon, Vegas, for those Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. I wants them in my belly. Ugh so good.",8NsXMrc27hNne4HQwFguoQ,0,0,5,HgqI3WvIjMg3vqtLMJ51sg

Bachi Burger is not your ordinary burger joint, it is definitely kicked up - not just a notch - but a whole hell-of-a-lot! They have all kinds of combinations to choose from. The burgers at Bachi are influenced by familiar and not so familiar, Asian and Hawaiian flavors. Burger like: ""Mr. Hos Burger"" (Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sautéed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, on a Taro Bun), ""Shogun Burger"" (Wagyu Beef, UNAGI!!! Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach) I mean c'mon!!

AND - I had a rare ""Spicy Miso Burger"" (Angus Beef, Onions, Shishito Pepper, Mayo, Lettuce, Roasted Garlic, Swiss Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette) - and to say it was delicious is an understatement! To accompany my burger I order the Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries - equally as awesome as the burger! The only problem is that its way too much for one person to eat!

I could really write on forever but I will spare you. The choices here are endless. creative burgers, Boba drinks, milkshakes, sodas (made in house), milk teas, coffees, micro-brews, and even SAKE.

Burger, Fries and a ""coke"" for $20

*Bachi Burger -   It's a fine line between caramelized and charred. My burger came charred. I ordered med-well and was advise it would be pink in the middle. I said,""perfect""....well, that wasn't the case when it showed up.
The Bun and Veggies were up to par. I ordered an egg with it and it was cooked perfectly. It was the patty that ruined the meal- the flakes of charred matter killed the burger. I couldn't even taste the red onion

*Just Fries -  Over priced ($3.50) for plain skinny fries. 

*Root Beer -  Soda machine needs calibration. $2.50 for a flat soda. I asked for another and they cranked up the carbonation mix and it tasted too carbonated.

The only reason why the place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the atmosphere and its employees.The manager was very apologetic and asked what she could do to make it up.

Sorry Bachi, I can get a decent burger, fries and ""coke"" for $10 at fuddruckers or fatburger. And for a little over $5 I can get an In-n-out burger.

Service: We were seated right away because we had called in a couple of minutes before (reservations only for parties of 8 or more.) Our server, Asian girl w/ sock bun hair, was just alright. I've definitely had better service elsewhere. I felt as if she was annoyed the whole time because it was mine and my family's first time and we were indecisive. Throughout our whole meal though, she did check up on us and asked us how we were doing, but I didn't like that it felt as if it was such a hassle to ask her for sauces, which they do charge for, by the way. One of the reasons why I dropped this place down to two stars was because of the action of our server: not to us, but to her fellow employee. During our meal, the restaurant did get a little busy & our server was becoming extremely frustrated. She was frustrated at her coworker & walked away & out loud said, ""Fuck you, then."" I thought I was the only one who heard it, until my mom asked me if what she heard was right & my brothers admitted to hearing it as well. She was also making comments about her worker being a ""dumbass."" That was such a turn off. Saying those things is already a bad thing, but to say those things in front of your customers is horrible and totally unprofessional. 

Food: 
What we ordered: 
Truffle Fries: Not too good. Only the top of (some) fries had truffle sauce on them, therefore, only some of the fries had flavor.

Salt & Pepper Fries: A little spicy! Comes with jalapeño slices, served with pineapple ketchup: Best thing on the menu, lol.

Oxtail Fries: Disgusting! I was really excited to try this item since majority of the Yelpers raved about this, but it was horrible. 

Pork Buns: My brother didn't like it. The pork was hard and mostly fat.

Miyagi San burger- Both of my brothers enjoyed this item. They substituted the patty w/ Wagyu beef. However, my stepdad, a burger connoisseur, didn't like it at all.

Kimchi Burger- I'm not too sure what this one was called, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it.

I didn't like the choices of burgers they had offered, so I ordered a plain Wagyu beef burger w/ lettuce, onion rings & grilled mushrooms. Our server charged me for extra spicy garlic aioli on the side, which makes me question, shouldn't the sauce be included IN the burger? I'm not going to lie, I had high hopes for this item, for I had heard many good things about grass-fed Wagyu beef, but it was just okay. I do have to admit that it's a better quality burger, but it's not worth the trip and time. I had asked for a side of mayo & a side of mushroom sauce ($1) which was pretty flavorful, since my burger was a bit bland. 

Tip: Be careful and check your receipt before you pay. Our server doubled up on the sauces. When I confronted a nicely dressed man, possibly the manager, he walked up to our server, asked how many we had ordered & told her that she overcharged us, she rolled her eyes and said ""whatever, just change it."" We were seated in the long table, right next to the kitchen. That's how I heard her. 

I definitely won't be back.",P60f6MmzDUvB1RflKf-VYQ,4,1,2,W7AoYV17YixJ_6qN6A6Hvg

The waitress, Crystal, on the other hand was terribly aloof and snobbish and clearly did not want to be there. She was slow and we had to constantly get up to flag her or someone down.

I uploaded a photo of some of the decor.  They have cool Asian themed backlit panels on the wall with large screen TVs.  Black tables with a line of black booths dividing the dining room in two.  The black painted ventilation shafts against the ceiling lined with halogen track lighting and hidden speakers give it a slightly industrial feel.  The rest of it feels like pre-club trendy.  I dug it but others in the party thought the alt rock was out of place and the spotlight effect due to the angle of the lighting was distracting.  

The waiters and servers were all very nice and knew their product.  We ordered the Kiki, Ronin, Banh Mi and Lonely Bird sandwiches... and the oxtail chili cheese fries.  The $11.50 price tag on this immense appetizer should have given away the size of it.  Rich piquant chili, sweet beans with a creamy cheese sauce and jalapenos on a mound of tasty fries perfectly cooked and crisp crowned by a sizzling sunny side up fried egg (see uploaded photo).  Loved these!  But then I had no room for anything else!  

My party each loved their burgers!  Two managed to finish theirs but the rest of us barely managed half.  I had mixed feelings about my sandwich.  The bread was awesome.  Reminded me of Hawaiian King sweet bread with a beautiful egg white finish.  I don't care for mayonnaise and the sauce they served on the side had a great flavor but I couldn't get past the texture due to aforementioned mayonnaise Fear.  The marinade on the turkey-chicken patty was wayyyyy too sweet for me.  I ended up boxing most of it for my sweet-loving family.  I'm a savory gal all the way!

1309303,2013-11-05,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"After hearing and reading so many good reviews of this place, I had to give it a try. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. 

I'll start with the good:
-They have a good variety of burgers and they are big enough to split if you are planning on having sides as well. (note: you have to order the sides separately) 
-I split the meatless burger which was pretty good. I could have done without the huge piece of fried tofu that was layered on top.
-The onion rings are SO good. Definitely order a side. They are sliced thin and have a nice crisp.

Here's the bad:
-The truffle fries were soggy...would not recommend 
-The kids menu is limited to 2 things: a $9 kids burger and an $8 ""grilled cheese"" which was basically a hamburger bun with melted cheese. My kid took one bite and put it down. The kid's burger was burned on the outside and pink on the inside but my other kid liked it anyway. 
-They don't have any pickles! They do offer a funky mix of pickled vegetables but it just didn't taste quite right.
-It's a bit on the pricey side for a not so classy joint.

The ugly:
The service was pretty bad. The waitstaff was very awkward and so was the manager. Not personable AT ALL. Absolutely no personalities. I paid attention and not one person on the staff that interacted with our table smiled...not once. I was with a group of 4 other women and 2 very well behaved kids. They looked depressed and annoyed half the time. When I told the manager that they should make it more clear that the kid's grilled cheese is not traditional and is on a thick bun he just looked at me with a straight face and said ""okay"". He wasn't necessarily rude...just so bland. The hostess that sat us needed to brush her hair...she looked like she just rolled out of bed. She wouldn't even make eye contact.

I could go on and on but the bottom line is that your food can be amazing but, if the service stinks, you won't want to go back for seconds.

(This may have been an off day for this place. The other reviews seem to be very good. Whatever the case, it wasn't an experience I'd want to pay for again. There are plenty of other burger joints in the sea!)",QQsDdoON1lur3iaWP_GcFg,0,0,2,z1Jtv3e0DtzO7SkvqwY1Dw

We decided to try something new rather than the same old restaurants on the Las Vegas strip the first night we got in. We've been always been going to the same places every time we come so we decided to change it up. Since I've heard such good things about Bachi, we decided to make the trek out the strip to some random plaza I would say 5-10 off the strip.

Upon walking in, Bachi is a fusion between Asian and modern cuisine. I decided to try their oxtail chili cheese fries and shogun burger and the bf ordered the black and green burger. The oxtail chili cheese fries were the highlight of the night!!! The oxtail was tender and flavorful and the mixture of chili was a little sweet and egg to top it off was the perfect amount of salty you needed!

We had three burgers

Oxtail chili fries 
Spicy miso
Miyagi San grass fed Waygu 
Kiki 

Of the 4, by far, oxtail fries was amazingly good. I love oxtail and this was a great take on it! 

As for the burgers, I really enjoyed the Kiki the best. The mushrooms and the sauce had a lot of flavor. 

The one they sell the most was the miyagi, which was good, the crunch from the onion rings were good, and the flavor of the yolk mixed well. 

Spicy miso for me was just another burger. The shredded lettuce overpowered the whole burger, and wasn't the most pleasant over power flavor. 

The burgers were really big. Between three people this was more than enough food, I think 5 people could have split all this food and had a good bite of each and still be just full. 

I think for flavor, I still like Unami burger for the juiciness of the meat, but I think you get more value and more uniqueness for what you pay.",DvnIL1YNpci5l8OVgk0bMQ,0,1,4,GvuFopy5OH0n8YCFk1CUhg

Yes this is one of those cursed locations where restaurants open and close, raising sun Turned to sunset, route 66 was too slow and others that I can't even remember faded into oblivion.
 Is time for something new, learn from the past, classic Hamburgers didn't work, Japanese didn't work, put them together and you get... Bachi burger......... Is that translates to karma burger? If it does, then that's what's coming to me, a nice and delicious juicy burger, cuz I deserve it.
 We ordered the fried calamari for appetizer, nothing different from other places, except the dipping sauces and the price, I'll skip them next time. We also had the Bahn Mi burger and the Ronin burger with The truffle Parmesan fries. Both burgers were excellent and the fries delicious. We also had the sangria special by our waitress recommendation, which it wasn't that good, a nice cold beer would've done the job.
 Yes! Bachi Burger is good, yes Bachi service is good, yes Bachi place is nice. Is Bachi here to stay? Only time will tell, and if you don't try this place  karma is gonna get you!

Got there early, enough to beat the crowd, like 5:30pm.  The atmosphere was retro, with a mixed crowd--and I was surprised at an extensive menu to suit everyone, from children to the old--Appetizers galore, and desserts too.  For those meat lovers, Angus beef and Wagyu (similar to that Kobe steak) and the Lonely Bird (turkey chix mix) and fish too.  Love the design of this place.

The Angus burger, the duck sandwich, calamari, and sangria. Only thing that I was actually impressed with was the Sangria. It rocked! It is a little pricey, a craft was $26, but was really good. So that was the highlight. Calamari was over cooked so it was like having gunny bears. The Angus burger was basted with a sweet sauce that wast my style at all. Almost like a white people BBQ sauce, you could taste the brown sugar. Now the mini duck sandwiches have potential. However, again it was so white it just wasn't right. Some spice would be nice!

I have been several times and usually have good service, however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian, prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion, there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait, so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian, both saw us and continued working, one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is ""How are you planning to pay?"" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money, we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded, ""i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments."" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu) . After we go that worked out, she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders, requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order, unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier, i placed my order over the phone as a to go order, that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there, i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective.

1512881,2014-12-20,1,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"7:00am Friday, December 20th. I woke up hungrier than usual. I had frosted wheat for breakfast, not exactly what I had in mind. I fueled up on coffee and was feeling jolly enough to even pick up my co-workers orders. I knew we had food coming in for lunch at work so I wasn't too concerned with that. My main concern was dinner. What to eat for dinner?

 

Bachi Burger.

 

For those of you who are unaware of what this is don't worry; I'm about to drop some knowledge on you like you've never heard before. Actually, it's pretty simple. It Asian fusion brought to the all American favorites. It's as if a cheeseburger has relations with a geisha and they had a child. It's an amazing combo that I need more of in my life.

 

I text my buddy Dave and it was on. Dave and I have a love for food that can only be examined on a neurological level. When I text him, he was already preparing the same text o be sent to me. It's like we have ESPN or something, a 5th sense if you will (that's a Mean Girls reference, I'm well aware ESP is considered the ""6th sense""). We made plans to meet at 8 and as I backed into my spot I discovered I had even parked directly next to him without even knowing. It's a food friendship made in heaven.

 

Anyways, we made our way in and did everything in our power to make it non-look like a Grinder meet up (that's the gay Tinder). In his words, it was a ""gentlemen's gathering over fine foods."" Right off the bat he knew what he was getting as he had spent time on Yelp prior to the meet up. It took me a little more time.

 

When the waiter arrived, we ordered like two kids recently kicked out of fat camp. I ordered the Ronin Burger with a side of Parmesan Truffle Fries. He ordered the Banh Mi Burger with a pickle plate on the side.

 

Now, the Ronin burger was the tits. In fact, it probably will be one of those burger I look back and tell my grand kids about. Dave's First bite of the Banh Mi was also love at first bite. After the first bite he concluded it was the best he's ad n his time in Las Vegas. The Ronin was made with Angus Beef (miso glazed), Asian slaw, caramelized onion, miso goma dressing, Katsu BBQ sauce, a fried egg and a Yuzo Citrus Aioli. Fuck me right? And Fuck me it did, right in the mouth. It was amazeballs right down to the bun it was served on. The best part, it stayed in tact the whole time. This is one of the most over looked concepts of a good cheeseburger. If it falls apart, it could be the best burger in the world but it would get points taken off because it was over topped. The Banh Mi was something only a mad genius could dream up. It also had the Miso glazed Angus but came with Pork-Shrimp Lemon grass Pate, curry aioli, pickled veggies and nuoc nam sauce. It was similar to the scene in Step Brother where Rob Riggle can't stop saying ""POW! Right in the Kisser!""

 

The truffle fries were on point. I had the pleasure of having these once before and the second time was no let down at all. Shoestring fried with white truffle oil, porcini cream, Parmesan reggiano and a side of sundried tomato aioli. The pickle plate was also right up my alley. Pickled, beets, cauliflower, garlic, daikon and shallots. The beets took the cake. Dave's a bit of a connoisseur of the pickled arts so I took his word for it and gave my thanks.

 

All in all, it was an awesome meal as per usual. Definitely a good place too eat at a slightly above blue collar pricing. In the words on Nike, if someone asks you to go, ""Just Do It.""

Burgers were great -- my girlfriend said it's the best she's ever had (although it's also the first time she'd ever tried wagyu beef).  I got the banh-mi burger, which has beef, pork and shrimp in it.  It was good; not amazing.  Couldn't taste the shrimp and that Asian pork flavor got old about halfway through, but no complaints about it otherwise.  The only downside was that service was slow.  We went there right when they opened and were the only ones there at first.  Our server was on-point until she got ONE more table, and then we never saw her (her tip reflected that fact).

When we first got there, there were only 3 tables that had been filled. So the place was still mostly empty. We walked up to the host/hostess station which was empty. When someone finally came over, he said that we needed to wait 5 minutes for the service to kitchen to catch up? This was well after the lunch hour and the kitchen did not look busy at all. So I asked if we could at least look at the menu and get an order ready, to which he replied no because we would still have to wait anyway. This made no sense at all since the kitchen was clearly NOT busy. When we were finally seated, the waitress took over 20 minutes to come greet us and when we got our order in, it took over 40 minutes for us to get our meal. Keep in mind that the restaurant is still very much empty at this point. When we got the bill at the end (which also took forever), we had been overcharged and then had to wait another half hour for the waitress to adjust it. So a meal that should have taken maybe just over an hour ended up taking over 2.5 hours due to their incompetence and general neglect. 

I'll probably try out their other location, but honestly the only thing saving this review for them is the fact that the food was actually good. It was just horribly tainted by their incomparably bad service.",Ada_E4hCt3N8FsMgWo353w,4,0,2,bYIDZliEInHj4KGodtSOdw

We had the sauteed edamame, very good, but the fire from the chilis was starting to get overwhelming when the food arrived - great timing.

I had the special, a Loch Duarte Salmon sandwich and Just Fries.  First, the fries.. sheer perfection, and the pineapple ketchup was surprisingly delicious and perfect for such a hot day.  The salmon sandwich was nicely balanced, with the bacon being beautifully caramelized and giving a nice smoky crunch that kept the salmon from being overpowering.  I was expecting good, I got great instead.  

I was stuffed when I left, and I had half a sandwich and over half the fries left.. made me want to cry to leave it behind, but couldn't squeeze in another bite and didn't want to deal with leftovers.

Hubby ordered the Ronin Burger and the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries.  First his fries.. he couldn't leave them alone.  As for the burger, he had ordered it medium and it arrived well done, but that didn't stop him from eating every single bite and practically moaning with ecstasy with each bite.

I think we'd arrived at the time of their usual dinner rush because there were six other couples waiting to be seated along with us. But, it didn't take too long before we were brought to our table and attended to. The server we had was very attentive, and was always there to get things to our table and reassured us throughout the night that our order would be out.

At first glance when looking at the menu, the boyfriend and I were honestly pretty suspicious about burgers in the $7-10 range, considering we're very stingy people who aim for what we feel is a fair price. All he could say was, ""This better be worth it."" And that it was. That it was.

I've always heard that Bachi is great for the Asian fusion. That's why I've wanted to come here for a while. I love burgers, but something different for a change has been on my mind for a while. And they really did it right.

Boyfriend got the Peanut Butter Milkshake to start, and it was heavenly. Do try it if you're craving for something sweet, especially if you're willing to spend the extra $5. It's worth it. He also got the Banh Mi Burger, which he says had lemongrass, pickled veggies, shrimp, pate, pork, etc. There was also a sauce that came with it that he enjoyed.

We both shared Truffle Fries and I LOVED it. I was curious enough to try the Ronin Burger, which has onions, japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, katsu bbq, among other things I missed, plus some interesting sauce on the side. Personally, I liked it the way it was without it.

Overall reaction? Dinner was a-ma-zing. I'm giving it five stars for outstanding quality, plus the fact that the burgers were great and were at a pretty good size for $9.50 (Banh-Mi) and $10 (Ronin). I'm very much able to overlook the fact that the kitchen was backed up when we were there and that we spent about 20-30 minutes of our time waiting. Those are things I can hardly blame anyway. Plus, the burgers really lived it up for me, and I'm itching to come back soon. $30 total for both of us for was not bad at all.

Next time, I'd love to try the Kiki and the Kalbi. :) And, I'm not a spicy food person but plenty of my friends have raved over the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, so I'll suck it up one of these days and give it a shot. Apparently, it's to die for, and I'm curious enough to try it.

-Sangria (just ok...no pieces of fruit in it, none)
-Banh mi burger
-Miyagi-san wagyu burger (requested carmelized onions to replace the carmelized bacon)
-Sweet potato fries (the dipping sauce is heaven, a little dill in there maybe?)

What I really enjoyed here was the variety of types of burgers whether you enjoy beef, fish, turkey, or chicken.  I've only had ""The Lonely Bird"" and ""Bachi Fish"" but everyone I've eaten who's joined me here has enjoyed what they've ordered.  The key to making this place different is their delicious buns and variety of sauces both really add to the flavor experience.  I do recommend going with a few people and ordering sweet potato or garlic fries with a variety of sauces.",LjDSVQGLLiOO7NCfvmV_MQ,4,2,5,lSiV70SWYLv01otkF8o3sw

We sat there for awhile to de ide where to go...Mac house, kona grill, CPK, then it hit me! Its time to give bachi burger a try! We get there around 10pm and Its. Wasn't that busy being they close at 11pm. We were seated immediately and the hostess and servers were great! Very friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant was clean and I liked the decor, pretty cool spot to hit up if you want a burger! So we ordered, we started with the butter truffle edamame and while it was good, it was oily and had lots of butter taste which was a nice change from the usual steamed veriety, but it didn't really have any truffle flavor. While we still enjoyed it, it would have made it a hit to have a stronger truffle flavor present. I orderedsalt and opera garlic fries with a side of pineapple ketchup (side of pineapple ketchup is $.50 extra) the fried were cooked well and were not greasy, the fresh jalapenos were a nice touch and added some kick, both the aioli and ketchup were perfect and the balance of those two being spicy and savory to sweet and salt was awesome and I will def get that combo of chili garlic aioli and pineapple ketchup again. I looked over the menu and while the burger to get with what I've gathered is the miyagi san, the ronin really appealed to me. So for this time I got the ronin. We didn't get the wagyu patties and stuck with the Angus and it was cooked to perfection! Med cooked with pink center was done to my liking! The flavors that stood out to me on this burger was the caramelized onions, Katsu sauce, and the miso gonna dressing. The bun was soft, chewy, and just a perfect way to round out this burger. The fried egg was a nice tough and everything worked in harmony. Nothing to over powering or lacking, the burger itself was seasoned well, juicy, and a very easy eating burger.  My overall first impression got better and better as I continued to eat the burger, the best burger in Vegas?? I don't know yet. I will have to try the miyagi San next time around but from what I've had this time, it is very close. I don't mind spending some decent money on a good burger and this was no expection.

Had dinner with my two friends & my 10 month old daughter last night. We were seated promptly & waters were given right away. I thought ""how nice, they brought my daughter a plastic cup with straw for water!"".  My third friend came a few minutes later. I didn't notice until our server mentioned it, but there were only 2 menus. I had told her there were 3 adults & the baby. Ok, no biggie. My guy friend had never been there before. He asked our server what kind of cheese is gruyere? She states ""white cheese"". Awkward silence. I explained to him it's more of a pungent cheese with a sharp flavor. So, the fries came out before the burgers which was great because we were starving. The burgers came out quickly as well. The food is usually really yummy & it was last night too!
So, the aforementioned plastic cup for my daughter was a big hit with her. All she wanted to do was drink from this cup. Well, my daughter dropped the cup and water went everywhere on the floor. Thankfully, there wasn't anyone next to us on either side. The server came by to check on us & I asked her if she had any rags for me to clean up the water. She came by with a few napkins & then saw the mess. She tried to to sop the water up with the few napkins, then realized a mop would be better. Well the mop never came. Mind you when the water dropped, another server was walking by & saw the whole thing. He ignored us. Our server came by twice to tell us ""we will clean when you leave, you probably don't wanna exit over here since it's wet"". Ok thanks for pointing that out. So, the plates were not even cleared for dinner when out came our check. I gotta tell you, my last review I raved about the dessert I had! I may have even dreamed about it for a week! I wasn't planning on having any last night but to not even be asked was a major insult. Sorry, my daughter spilled the water. Sh*t happens. My friend asked while we were leaving, ""how come our server asked that other table if they wanted dessert?"". That was the last blow. I ended up tipping 22% since we had the water mess. I should have written a note ""if it wasn't for my daughter spilling the water, you wouldn't even have received 15%."" Looking back, I shouldn't have left the 22%. Will I be back? Probably.

Our maitre d' Alina is most pleasant and entertaining to our needs. She is well educated on the full menu and provided insights on what to order. 

On the table:

Plantation iced tea!!!! Home brewed tea infused with mint mixed with pineapple juice. It was the right amount of sweet and mint flavor tea! Thanks for handmaking our drinks Alina...best service ever!

Spicy miso on wagyu patty. 

First time biting into a wagyu patty and I must say there is a marked difference. 

Food for thought: the meaning of wagyu translates to japanese cow. The patty originates from any of four Japanese breeds of beef cattle. The cattle undergo a process called marbeling in where they are fed a high energy diet which contains corn and barley thereby producing a marble pattern carcus yielding intramuscular fat that provides a good amount of fat to lean ratio. 

The result...the meat tasted juicy and lean. Every bite had a filling sensation and a creamy texture. The spicy miso sauce is spicy indeed. The sweet bread balanced the spice and the egg gave the burger that wet texture to mix in with the balance of sweet and spicy flavor. The size was a good bread:patty ratio both more than a mouth full. I would have licked my plate clean but my mouth was on fire. The burger holds true to its given name: ""Spicy"". 

Pair this entree with oxtail fries which is a blend of beans, jalapenos, oxtail meat, bacon, and a cocktail of spices. 

The overall meal gave me a belly boner! Hats off to the chef! It would be a crime to not join the culinary experience that only Bachi burgers can deliver.",NF6-RIYueQv81aB3vJ7WMw,2,2,5,1ZRa5JRRPrzWcgUABBZYZw

1689668,2012-05-08,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Hooray!  Bachi Burger, the famous fusion burger joint in town has expanded and landed in the west side of town.  Hearty burgers and delicious sides were calling my name!

Walking in, looks like they've done a swell job of decorating.  It looks modern, clean, hip and still features photography from artists posted on their walls.  Service was snappy, responsive and done with a genuine smile.

On to the food!
1.  Calamari - Bachi Burger has taken this appetizer to a new level.  The bits of squid are fried delicately and they stay crunchy.  Tossed in are bits of mint, grilled cherry tomatoes and slices of grilled lemon, turning the dish into something light and flavor blasted.  The sauces paired were the traditional tartare sauce and a green chili sauce.  What I found was the best flavor combo?  Double dipping the tarter and the chili sauce!
2. Ronin Burger - My Angus Beef was juicy and tender.  The caramelized onions and miso goma dressing enhanced the beef flavor.  The Japanese Cole Slaw added the perfect refreshing crunch and the runny yolk from the fried egg always add a extra bonus factor - GOOEY!.  If the sauces inside weren't enough, I also chose to dunk the burger in the citrus aioli for an extra flavor blast.
3.  Miyagi Burger - Is this a new one?  I'm not sure that I've seen it at the other location, but this tasty as well.  Where the Ronin provided a ""refreshing"" burger (if burgers could be refreshing), the Miyagi provided a ""extra savory"" experience.  It too had a juicy meat patty and a fried egg, but what makes this one stand out is the sea aroma from the furikake.  Mmmm mmmm seaweed bonus.
4.  Truffle Parmesan fries - Of course we need some spuds to go with our burgers!  This is a seriously addicting side dish.  Shoestring fries drizzled with their special concoction of truffle oil and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Conclusion:  These past few years have grown in the fusion food world, and Bachi brings it to the next level with the excellent quality of food and service.  They have this new location dialed in!",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,3,3,5,hmhLf-DVd36nRR_3TRgK-A

1693210,2012-09-08,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I soooo wanted to love this place.  I still haven't found a place I'd like to regular in Summerlin;(

We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Thursday, there was a lively crowd...maybe about 20 people.  It only took a moment to be acknowledged and then seated by the hostess.  For some odd reason, the hostess seated us  at the least desirable table (nearest to the restrooms) although there were plenty of open tables.  The restrooms were not separated by a door or curtain from the dining hall.  So my husband (the polite gentlemen he is) sat in the seat that looked into the restroom hallway. Anyway, we did ask to move, which our waitress happily obliged.  

We ordered our drinks.  Plenty of beers and signature Saki cocktails, but only a few wines by the glass, but in their defense that had atleast one of each of the most popular varietals (e.g one chard, one pinot grigio, one cab, one merlot, one zin, and one pinot noir).  The waitress took our order as soon as we came back with our drinks, because we were ready.  While I didn't see it on the menu, but saw it on their website, I asked her if they had the Shogun burger (which was my main draw to this restaurant), she said they don't serve it at the Summerlin location.  Bummer.  I had to pick an alternative...more on that later.

Between ordering our drinks and our meal, we had a chance to look around and observe the atmosphere. The scene is young, hip, kind of alternative, yet still had a bit of that ""Chinese restaurant"" look due to the chairs.  Not tacky by any means, but did take it down a notch.  I appreciated that the restaurant attempts to support its local roots by hanging art by local artist that can be purchased and also being mindful of the environment by sending their compostable waste to Cowboy Trail Farms for reuse.   I did think it was a little too much to be showing Food Network on one TV and The Cooking Channel on the other TV...I suppose it could be a good plug for them if DDD comes on, but then again the dinners already know about this place;)

Our order came in a timely manner. We shared an order of the salt and pepper garlic fries, my husband got the Miso burger and I got a bunless Kiki burger.   We expected the fries to be thicker cut, but they were shoe strings garnished with salt, pepper, jalapenos and cilantro with a side of garlic aioli. They were tasty, especially with the sauce.  The first thing we noticed that the burgers were appetizingly big, which justified the price, even making it seem like a value.   We took our first bites, we both thought they were overly sweet.  While I understand the presence of all flavors, we thought there was an imbalance towards sweetness coming from the burgers being overly dressed with sauce.  In addition the burger meat was not seasoned but maybe that was intentional as to not compete with the sauces and condiments that are on top of it. Either way...both burgers were too saucy to eat neatly..my Kiki had too much onion marmalade and his Miso burger had  too much apple vinaigrette.  Besides the bun of the Miso burger was too flimsy to hold up to the saucy mess.  As we continued to eat, we really felt the need for salt to counteract the overly sweet toppings and to season the beef.  Adding salt did enhance the meat, but didn't really blunt the sweetness.  Sad since, the beautiful meat that has been so consciously sourced and carefully selected should be highlight, and possibly a light sprinkle of salt would have enhanced its greatness. 

As we continued to finish our burgers, we became more and more bummed it was not what we thought it would be and definitely didn't live up to the hype.  Still I like Bachi Burger's expression of its passions and consciousness of the environment and its local community, I just hope it can improve on its uniqueness!",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,0,0,3,NqqqfGY85MfN1fFYsl6nFA

1721964,2013-10-11,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Bachi Burger is hands down has the best tasting burgers I've ever eaten at a restaurant. What is it that I love about Bachi Burger? The fact that I can have Wagyu patty burgers with any of their superb combination of toppings. So why am I giving it 4 stars? Its simply because the food is very pricy for what you get. Don't get me wrong, the portions are reasonably sized; however, the amount you pay for what you're getting and the amount you're getting is a bit unbalanced. You pay roughly $14 for a single burger with no sides included and you pay roughly $5 for fries with a truffle sauce. So your meal of burger + fries already comes out to be $19 not including tip+tax or drinks/dessert.

But enough of the bad, this restaurant lives up to its reputation in terms of food + service. I've always been professionally served by my waiters and waitresses. They are kind and always attentive the few times I've been here. The food has always been consistently good too. I usually ask for medium-rare to medium depending on my mood and my burgers have always come out perfectly every time. I also love the blends of flavor that they created in their menu. I usually have a hard time deciding what my palate wants when I read their menu. The ambiance is also nice here. The atmosphere is not too loud, although I was seated by one noisy table once.

Service: 
Gary served us and he was very attentive. He was the only one at the front of the house and greeted us as soon as we walked it. He gave us the freedom to choose our seats but that's because we were the first ones in restaurant. :) Once we got our food he came to check on us but wasn't overbearing. 

Presentation: 
The presentation was above par of most burger restaurants. The plates were clean, the garnishes were bright, and the food looked very appetizing and came out in a timely manner. 

Food: 
We ordered the pork belly steamed buns, bone marrow, the Bachi fish sandwich, wings, fries and a Thai tea. 

Pork Belly buns - came with 3, the pork belly was tender and cut thick, comparable to thickness of your index finger. The hard boiled egg added a nice to it. 

Bone marrow - came with 7 pieces of bread (a little less would've been okay). The marrow was slightly sweet because of the jam and not too oily. 

Bachi fish sandwich - served with raw tomato and raw unions giving the sandwich a fresh taste. The tartar sauce was light. None of the ingredients overpowered the fish and it was a nicely balanced fish sandwich. 

Crispy tebasaki wings - fairly large and crispy. It was garnished with pickled radish, which went perfect with the wings. The flavor tasted like a sweet soy. 

Salt and pepper garlic  fries - the fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly. Unfortunately, it lacked the garlic flavor. The garlic chili aioli sauce paired great with the fries. This had a perfect amount of heat and acidity. 

Thai tea - Their tea is average and less sweet than most. If you are a Thai tea lover, you know the sweetness level I'm talking about!

The only downside is that most of the burgers are on the sweet side, which I don't prefer. But, they did have a savory burger, which hit the spot! It's called the Black & Green Burger. I always like my burger prepared this way (smoky sharp cheese such as blue and gouda with some spring mix greens and vinaigrette).

Their appetizers are also very indulgent. My personal favorite is the truffle parmesan french fries. It tastes the same as the truffle parmesan fries at Eat Chow in Newport Beach, but I think it has a stronger flavor than Eat Chow. We also got their famous Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. This is good if you like meat on the sweet side combined with your traditional chili cheese fries.

I have been reading so many reviews about Bachi Burger.  I got that holiday weekend craving for a burger, so I figured it was a SIGN.  Based on all the reviews, I decided to try the Kiki Burger.  I am salivating just thinking about that meal.  It was such a nice combination of flavors.  

The Kiki Burger is described on the menu as: 
Angus Beef  Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & 
Eryngii Mushrooms  Caramelized Bacon
Sweet Onion Marmalade  Aged Gruyere Cheese
Garlic Chili Aioli  =$10

I decided not to get anything else, just to focus on the burger along with the Plantation Iced Tea.  I am from the South so I know a thing or two about iced tea.  The tea was so nice and refreshing, with pineapple, mint and simple syrup to sweeten.  

I loved the very cool modern decor and the even cooler chill lounge music, if you call it that.  The whole restaurant had a very trendy, modern but casual vibe.  This is certainly a place I want to bring my friends.  Oh-yeah right, they've probably all already been here.  Still, I very much look forward to coming back soon and try the other creations.  

I loved the food, the atmosphere and the experience.  My only suggestion would be to think about cutting back the simple syrup in the tea maybe 1/3?

I've eaten at the Bachi Burger in Henderson. also crowded and very busy. but in Henderson, the serving staff was friendly and welcoming. The waitress we had in Summerlin was almost hostile from the moment we sat down. The restaurant was very noisy, so it was hard to hear what was being said by the folks at the other end of the table. Our Kiki burger was very good. we also ordered the duck sliders to share. They came on a bao. While the bao was good, the duck was not. The fries were ordered to be made crispy. They were not. None the less, the sweet potato fries were outstanding as were the truffle fries.
So the 4 star rating was for the high quality burger and the excellent fries. I couldn't give a 5 star rating due to the rude server and the noise (a pity since it it next door to my favorite movie theater).

FOOD:
Crusty Crab (3 stars): They should just offer this as a crab cake. Did not taste that great. Did not remind me of a burger at all and the ingredients just didn't mesh well together. Would have been better just as a crab cake alone. I wouldn't really recommend this. Pretty disappointed when I took my first bite )=

Salted Caramel Milkshake (4 stars): Strong yummy caramel flavor! Best thing I tried here. But it's so small!! I finished it so fast. And the marshmallow topping takes up some of the glass filling so you really don't get a whole glass worth. 

Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries (3 stars): The sauce it was with was okay. Maybe the truffle would have been better. Not very spicy at all.

SERVICE (3 stars):
Got our food and never saw the server again until we were done. He also told me the chili fries were good if you like spicy food. Um, was not even spicy at all, haha, maybe I just take spice better than he does.

Everyone raves about the Oxtail cheese fries- but the ones I ordered were essentially mush. The cheese was extremely greasy- something I would usually be all for- but they lacked any clear flavor and the fries disintegrated if you tried to pick them up.

The addition of cheese to fries is a sacred act in my religion and must be treated with respect.

Order drinks and wait 15 minutes for them to arrive, with only two other tables occupied? Nice start. Ordered water without ice? What did we get? Water with ice. Ordered food and drinks at the same time, but it took 45 minutes to get our burgers. Ordered the burger medium-well, which should have a tinge of light pink. It didn't. Good thing I didn't order them well-done as I'm guessing it would amount to a self-defense weapon with otherworldly hardness!!! Add bacon for $2.50, which is one piece of bacon cut in half. Yes, we speak Russian, among other languages, but why in the world would one of the other two tables rubberneck themselves into what they apparently considered a stare to the death. That was extremely unpleasant.

This time i went with the Mr Ho Burger and let me tell you, the mixture of that burger was amazing. Cooked medium well but still flavorful and juicy! The bun when you see it might look a little odd if your not used to that kind of thing but that taro bun blends so well with the flavors of the beef and pork burger mixture. To add there is diced Lup Cheong Sausage in there as well! This is by far my new fav burger. If your from Hawaii you would feel right at home and i felt right at home haha. The deserts are another thing to add to this place. SO GOOD! You just have to go down and try it for yourself!

After a long morning of sight-seeing and driving, we decided to stop for a late lunch before continuing on to nearby Red Rock Canyon.  I had Bachi Burger bookmarked for a visit on my recent trip, but decided to visit this location on a whim after we realized (thanks to the trusty Yelp app) that it was midway to our destination.

ALOHA:  Ever since Bachi Burger was featured on DDD on the Food Network with Guy Fieri, and discovering its owners/chef are originally from the 50th state, I was beyond ecstatic to finally have a chance to eat here.

LOCATION/AMBIANCE:  Ample parking available as its located in a shopping center/strip mall.  The restaurant is spacious and inviting with plentiful seating.

MEAT:  The melding of Asian flavors and ingredients is paramount as diners peruse the menu.  Asian fare combined with traditional American burger toppings are fused to create an outstanding burger.

*Kalbi Burger:  I love Korean food.  I really like kim chee.  And so, having house made kim chee as a component of this burger sold me immediately.  Other ingredients included kalbi marinade, green onions, and ko chu jang mayo.  I can't begin to describe just how much I enjoyed this burger.  It was perfectly cooked and the toppings fresh.  Easily one of the best burgers I've had.

*Shogun Burger:  My dining companion's choice.  Wagyu beef and unagi combined with pan seared foie gras , poached Asian pear, miso butter, and Yamamoto peach.  I can't speak for my friend's fondness for his choice, except to say that he ate nearly everything on his plate. 

We shared with the regular fries and onion rings as sides.  As lover of french fries, I of course loved the fries.  I also liked the batter of the onion rings, as it wasn't coated too heavily and therefore you could actually taste the onion as opposed to just a mouthful of hollow batter.  Both were excellent choices.

SERVICE:  Exceptionally good.  The restaurant wasn't crowded when we arrived and we were seated immediately.  The server was a friendly young man who gave us ample time to look over the menu.  He answered the few questions we had about the menu, took our orders, and returned with soda and waters shortly after.  He checked on us periodically throughout themeal and readily provided soda and water refills.  Good service overall.

BOTTOM LINE:  Phenomenal burgers.  Good service.  I'll be back hopefully on a future trip.",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,12,8,4,IlEcu-J6VhgRlxinuIyHUg

*Anything with a fried egg = I'm game.  The fries had a great flavor by themselves but the entire dish was yummy.  The oxtail chili & cheese was exactly what you expect (the oxtail is shredded) and the garlic aioli is a perfect compliment.  Would order again!  This is DEFINITELY enough to share (there was 4 of us!)

Something else unique that I really appreciated was the spin on ""salt and pepper"" at the table. For the pepper they had a very find ground red chili pepper that has a lot more luck than the basic black pepper. For salt they had some smokey black bit more course salt. As if that weren't enough, they also have a chili water to drizzle on whatever you please. It has a nice flavor and kick.

For starters, we ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and pork belly steamed buns which came highly recommended by our server -

Oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) - this top selling item was awesome and delicious. The chili really makes this dish standout so flavorful, sweet and spicy. Using oxtail instead of traditional ground beef adds richness and appropriate texture to the chili, complimenting the light crisp fries. I love the way the egg yolk oozes over the chili when you break into it. It felt like I was eating luxurious French boudin fries. Very savory and exquisite.

Pork belly steamed buns ($10) - Thick cuts of pork belly nestled inside 3 soft pillowy buns and amped up with a boiled egg for the ultimate deliciousness was scrumptious.  The perfect foundation for any great Asian bun. You get a nice balance of sweet and tanginess from Chinese black vinaigrette and hoisin which works well with pork and vegetables.

I've eaten a lot of good burgers and I'm amazed to say that these have got to be the best I have eaten anywhere, including some in LA. The buns on both of these dishes were huge, and presentation was great. We ended up ordering the Bachi and Miyagi-San Wagyu burger which were both well crafted and on point -

Miyagi-San Wagyu Burger ($15) - infused with Furikake seasoning and priced a few dollars more, this kobe beef quality patty was freaking delicious. It was cooked perfectly medium with a nice crust and pink in the middle. Of course, you can't go wrong with a fried egg which to be the norm nowadays. It offers a buttery, rich flavor that makes the basis for any tasty burgers.

Bachi burger ($13) - It came with standard lettuce, tomato, and red onion. For $4.50 more it was upgraded with apple wood smoked bacon, shredded onions and cheddar cheese ($1.50 each extra for each item). The burger was juicy, tender and so good! Everything held together nicely without getting to messy. Each bite was heavenly.

To wash it down, we ordered the salted/caramel shake ($6) with toasted marshmallows. It was smaller portion than we're used to seeing (maybe 12 oz glass), but very delicious. They have wonderful selection of craft beers and premium sake, which added to our yummy the dining experience. The 22 oz Sapporo Draft ($6) paired well with the beer and chili fries.

Banh Mi burger is fantastic, and what I get time and time again. I've been here about 5 times and the food is always consistent.

I have eaten here before and it was the same situation; food tastes great but service is average.

This time, it was no exception; the icing on the cake was when my Lonely Bird entree arrived, j asked the waiter whether or not hey had some sort of mayo or aioli mayo. He said they have garlic aioli but he will have to charge me extra; I was like ""you cannot be serious, right?"" His reply was (read this as you can imagine the tone) ""oh yes, I am very serious. We make it in house and it is extra"". 

I asked ""how much?"" His reply was ""it is 50 cents""!!!!!!!!!!! 50 cents when I was buying over $60 lunch!! (I had two other people with me)!!! FIFTY CENTS! He had the gull to charge me fifty cents for a tiny bit of aioli...

It was kind of embarrassing that another family of 4 complained (before I had the chance to) asking where the server was as they had been waiting for 15 minutes as well to get approached. 
Once we finally got a server to come to our table we made sure to order all at once so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. 
The actual burgers were good. But again we didn't get approached the entire time we ate, or get a refill of our waters, and when the server finally came back I asked for the check and she then asked if we wanted a refill of water...but at that point it was too late and we just wanted to leave.

You gotta appreciate that they started here in Las Vegas. Usually we import culinary talent and restaurants, but here's a good example of us exporting it.

The prices are a little high, but I think it was worth it. The music playing reminded me of my visit to the W hotel lounge in NY, but the lighting was like track lighting disaster. They should soften it up in there and put some plants around or something. I wanted to eat an amazing burger, thumble through Las Vegas Weekly drink a couple, make it one beer due to the cost and start my weekend early. I did love the Kiki Burger..perfect medium rare as I requested and yummy sweet caramelized onion jam with a mix of mushrooms and cheese. My $4.00 fries I could have done without. I wanted to take them out of the silly cone display. I ordered the salt and pepper fries which were decorated lightly with fried jalapeños, fresh cilantro, and grated ginger. They were shoestring thin and were luke warm upon delivery before my burger so were kind of cold after a few in. I like thicker fries though.The burger and the BUN was off the hook. If I hadn't spent $5 on a pint I would have spent another $5 on a special milkshake like the one with bacon in it. But, they ran out.

Unfortunately I feel that I had a bad first impression of this place. First, it probably took maybe 10 to 15 mins for us to even make an order. It was not busy at all so I expect for the server to serve us. This is our first time there so we wanted to ask the server some questions. She looked as though she was annoyed of the question. Plus, I asked for her to speak louder because I could not understand her soft spoken words. She repeated the same way she was speaking before. Basically she didn't care. Then as we ordered, she's basically suggesting we order this because it's higher quality. I'm like what? Did u throw an opinion on how we should order? I'm like no. I want to try this other thing. 

I believe we finally got our food after a half an hour. I'm Like oh gosh. How tough is it to make burgers??? Food was bland. I kept adding the sauces that were on the table to add some flavor. Throw in a whole bunch of chili powder so it could be spicy. I ordered the spicy miso burger. Didn't taste spicy at all. The burger tasted high quality and that's fine. 

But I don't think it's like amazing.

I also ordered the Miyagi-San wagyu burger which was $15 and includes the wagyu patty. It comes stacked pretty high at first because of the onion crisps which are really good. There is caramelized bacon which is good, along with chili mayo. The bun is also really good, it's soft, but not chewy.

It all about speciality burgers (still have basic burgers for the kids; two nieces got they enjoyed their burger). They have lot too choose from too. I had the Ronin burger, brother had the Miyagi burger, and sister-in-law not remember. Both my burger and brother burger had the fried egg. FRIED EGG and burger are peas in pod or heaven on earth. It done right on from the burger being perfectly cook medium (nice juicy), fried egg another perfection (the yolk ruining just right. fingers get messy), and my burger RONIN combine fried egg too japanese cole slaw, too kalbi sauce.The bun fresh, right size too the patty not over or under, and toasted just right. It reasonable price for high end type of burger. We got sides of sweet fries and skinny fries came with pineapple ketchup (the ketchup only thing not like about the meal; felt like it was way too sweet more like dipping fries in jelly then ketchup). The fries and burgers good eats.

We started with the oxtail chile cheese fries. Talk about prefect appetizers for four or five people. It great! The chili was so good could have order just chili with rice be happy in life. You add the cheese plus fried egg some jalapenos. Layers upon layers of tasty stuff. Get too the bottom still something on top of the fries!!

came here with my boyfriend before we headed out clubbing. we both ordered the spicy miso burger and a side of truffle parmesan fries to share. very tasty, juicy, and definitely very flavorful. i love the fact that you can ask for it rare, medium rare, and etc. only problem my boyfriend and i had with the burger is the fact that we actually didn't get filled from it. maybe we just have super blackholes instead of actual tummies, but it kinda put us off a bit.

fries were interesting. we didn't really like the truffle sauce on top. but i guess that's just our taste in food. (should've gotten the garlic fries! darnit!) it came with a side of spicy sriracha-mayo sauce, i believe. the sauce was delicious!

overall, i think i'd have to come back again to give it a decent review.

It seems a lot spacious and less crammed versus the original location plus there's options of things I could do before or after going here. There's bars, a theater, and restaurants just walking distance. Yea and it's located next to the movie theater.

The must have are the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries. It's not amazing but just something they are known for, just get and get it out of your system. It's a pile of your usual French fries, kind of wished they were thicker maybe use tater tots or steak fries, topped with a oxtail chili cheese mixture, cilantro, jalapeño, and a fried egg. Order it with your burger and divide it among a group of friends.

I almost alway get the same burger, the Spicy Miso Burger. Don't let the name fool you it isn't even spicy. It's an angus beef patty with shishito pepper, swiss cheese, onion, mayo, lettuce, some sauces, and a fried egg in a bun. Not bad, tasty but the only way I'm satisfied with it is adding lots of sriracha or other other hot sauces on it.

I like what they're doing with their menu, creative and would impress many. The service here has almost always been good except when you want to divide checks, I think the max was up to 4 split checks no matter how large the party but they'll let you charge as many cards if you want on one check so it usually works out.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,6,3,4,XcsUeyXA5KVR9Ddb2M4VXw

There were 8 tables occupied & 3 servers. I had a beer & we both drank water. The water was filled once & the napkins we asked for when the food came never arrived. That was the extent of our servers attention. Beer & water were dropped off as she took our food order, she dropped off the burgers. That was it.

Ridiculous and lazy! 

Will not be returning any time soon, seeing as there are plenty of other burger places and service generally sucks at this location, anyway. Service at this location is slow and every time I order, my meal arrives with some error requiring me to send it back (last time it was cooked incorrectly and took several tries to get to right cook- the cook this time was past well done and had no furikake for some reason, but mayo was more important issue).

After snacking on the fries, I had high expectations for my burger. The burger wasn't bad, it just wasn't special. You can definitely tell that quality ingredients go into the burger, but the flavor was kind blah. Nothing sets it apart for any other quality burger. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?

Unfortunately, I don't eat beef (sometimes I do, but have not ate a hamburger in over 10 years).  They did have a a ground chicken / turkey called the lost bird and I have to say it was huge and good.  The bun they used is not your typical burger bun, but what u get when ordering a baked pork bun, if you ever had it.  I loved the bun they used.  Good twist to make it an Asian fusion burger.

So, I was seated promptly and was advised that tonite was cash only as their computers were down. No worries. I ordered a glass of Malbec which they were out of, so I asked for a $9 glass of Cabernet. When the waiter brought it to me I couldn't believe how small the pour was. The glass was a short wine glass to begin with, and I would say that he poured barely 5 oz of wine it. Decided to order the $8 angus burger with cheddar added for $1.50. Since no sides came with this $9.50 burger, I ordered regular fries which came with pineapple ketchup for $3.50. I asked for extra ketchup and the waiter replied ""regular ketchup?"" so I replied ""sure"".  The burger came and was cooked to my liking and I have to say that it was delicious! Not ""$9.50 delicious"" but still very good! The fries came after my burger and was a decent sized order. Waiter brought one small side of pineapple ketchup and one regular. I loved the pineapple ketchup and asked for extra but was told that it was .50 for extra. I said no thanks as the $3.50 was already enough for plain fries. Also, I had to send the first side of regular ketchup back as it tasted old or was a very cheap brand. The waiter brought back ketchup from a different container and said they use Heinz. It was fine. 
The service was very good and the burger was very, very tasty. However, my bill came to $23 which is crazy for a burger and fries and a 4oz glass of wine. Sorry, but I won't be back.",E3RxPpeEiZZGDF4DaYPGmg,0,0,2,79MS_HacujY3waQDa_tZFA

I don't usually go for the specialty burgers because they all usually have great ingredients that I love but one too many that throws me off.  So I just ordered my own with whatever I wanted on it.

2575767,2012-09-23,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I wish I would have been feeling better than I was; even given my state of ick, I found Bachi Burger to be quite tasty. We got there around 4:30 on a Saturday evening & there were only a few other tables occupied (by the time we were leaving the movie theater at 7:30, it looked like there were people waiting outside). We were immediately given waters yet never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. We could've asked on our own but the water seemed sufficient. The menu is fairly concentrated but the selection is not lacking. Our waiter was the perfect level of attentive, smiled alot & handled my inquiries (i.e. neurosis) like a champ. The menu clearly states ""no substitutions"" (i.e. don't start changing $#!% or it'll take away the integrity of the dish) so I wanted to be respectful of that. We ordered the chili fried chicken (appetizer), truffle parmesan fries w/sundried tomato aioli &, while we could have just split a Kiki burger, at this point, we wanted them cooked differently. I would go back for the chili fried chicken alone. For an appetizer, there's a generous serving. Quality meat cooked perfectly (very filling!). Somehow, I've never had truffle anything so the fries were a treat. I'm not a meat person- I eat meat but I don't want it to taste like meat- so I order everything ""not quite a hockey puck but well done"". What Bachi managed to do is cook it just to the point of thorough where it was still pillow soft inside. There was an intense char on the outside that was deliciously crispy (not hocky puck'y). Since I didn't have much of an appetite & since the chicken & fries filled me up, I didn't eat much of my burger. But what I did eat left the impression of being unique & worth going back for. I'll admit, I was a bit nervous to try Bachi, after reading reviews of both locations & questioning their customer service. Due to the concentrated menu, there's an opportunity to obtain alot of regulars who go back for the same, special item(s) that can't be found elsewhere. But if they can't get the customer service issues under control, something with amazing, long-term potential could be tarnished over something so easy to fix. I just hope my positive experience wasn't luck & that it'll be equally pleasant the next time I go.",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,1,1,3,rBMvyC6YpfumUaXmbYvNQA

For a few years I heard that the burgers here were great and it's true. I have been on a personal search for the best burger in LV and Bachi Burger is a bonafide contender.

This is simply a great burger! I chose the Kikis burger and it was smooth as a Ferrari Modena gliding up the PCH... headed for the Strawberry Festival of course. 805 stand up!  I don't know if any other burger has Bachi  Burger's flavor.  It's definitely not a big burger by any means. I could knock down three of them and be looking for number four!  However, size is not a factor here because quality wins you over. First off, the bun is of a superior quality,  baked fresh and brought in daily from an outside bakery.  It shows. The bun is shiny and moist which helps to make the whole burger pop. I usually need something to wash a burger down, but with the Kikis I could've dry dropped it- I mean I could've... but I didn't. I recommend ordering the burger medium well because it comes out perfect. Just enough pink so flavor is not lost with a well done burger. They give you a tasty Aioli sauce on the side but you won't even need it. The burger speaks for itself. The burger is presented very well also. Ordered the garlic fries and was not disappointed. Excellent! They come sprinkled with a good portion of jalapeños on top and are very tasty and they are enough to share.

Service was good. The rap on Bachi Burger has been the long wait times to get your food, however I didn't find that to be the case in our experience and this is serving four adults and two small kids. The kid's grilled cheese looked awesome by the way, garnished with an apple slice with a few carrots. Parking is not an issue here either- you could park a tractor trailer in this lot if you needed to. I hope you don't need to. For this quality of burger the price was not bad. The Kiki's comes in at about 12 bucks. For desert, go next door to Rocket Fizz and go hog wild reliving your childhood with some retro candies and sodas. So the bottom line is that my search for the best burger in Vegas has yielded a top ranked contender here...who else can step in the ring with Bachi Burger?",TmEMHG_nB7kQE6FYq6kltQ,2,2,5,RgjB5oENVIF7DHvjYUCapw

We got here on a Friday night with a 25 minute wait which wasn't a big deal because we just walked over to Patty's closet to kill time. My in-laws said we have to try the salty caramel toasted marshmallow milkshake and we did. I'd say this was the best item of the night! It was a bit overly sweet, but still so addicting. 

We then ordered the oxtail chilli cheese fries as our appetizer to share. Upon first bite, I told my husband it was cold. I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh. There wasn't much oxtail that I could taste and the warmth issue was very off putting. Lastly, we settled for the Miyagi San burger and Ronin burger. I LOVE fusion food, but I was not impressed by the flavors of the Ronin. Something was just missing to make it amazing. I did appreciate the crunch of the coleslaw and the caramelized onions, but all the other flavors cancelled out the taste of the fried egg. My husband's Miyagi burger was much better, but we asked for it medium and it was WELL done. There was no pink or anything, but the taste of the fried egg was amazing and the onion strips were crispy and fried to perfection. Overall, I would say that Holsteins has better burgers for this price range, and to not believe the DDD and Yelp hype. Come try it for yourself, but I don't think I'll be back.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,0,0,2,z8uMV6IMnFUwVBuo0vBdcA

Overall I loved the concept of the banh mi burger (plus I'm Vietnamese), but in regards to execution and flavor, it failed for me. The burger wasn't moist like the Kiki's burger. I soon realized that it's not moist or juicy because it's a ground pork and beef mixture for the patty. The ground pork definitely caused the patty to dry out. The patty also was extremely bland, it could of definitely used more time marinating. Lastly, the nuoc cham (fish sauce) dipping sauce for the burger was watery and didn't do the burger any justice. 

Also, we ordered a side of grilled shishito peppers. The sweet soy seasoning was delicious and enhanced the shishito peppers natural sweetness. We enjoyed the entire bowl until the very end. Out of nowhere, the very last 2 peppers were aggressively spicy! It took us by such shock since we didn't know that shishito peppers could be that spicy. We popped the entire huge pepper in our mouth and we were both soon very irritated and uncomfortable by the spice level of the pepper. Mind you, we are spice eaters and avid fans of spicy food. But this was like a very bad prank. We were not expecting something to burn so bad, it was so intense! Plus we chomped the entire pepper not knowing any better. It ruined my taste buds and my throat was swollen for a good 30 minutes. Yep, it was an episode of punk'd. Be careful you non spice eaters!

However I will chime in anyway with my own opinion.  This is definitely must try burger spot in Las Vegas.  Since its spotlight by Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives Bachi Burger has gained a national following.  I cannot wait to go back myself.  

I had the MIYAGI-SAN on this visit and I surely was not disappointed.  From the sweet fresh baked bun to the perfectly cooked medium patty this burger was delicious.  I did not even ask for ketchup and mustard because that would just make it another burger.  I could go on and on about how good it was but I just recommend go and try one asap.  

We also had the Organic Edamame with Garlic and Truffle oil and one again I needed no sauce to did the beans were just fantastic the way the chef prepared them.  The Truffle fries were also very tasty and the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli was a fine substitute for ketchup any day.   

The No MEAT Burger was very flavorful.  The red bean mixed with other ingredients gave the patty a sweetness that was very tasty.  Finished with a slice of tofu over the top accompanied with mixed greens, red onion and tomato this burger looked like a masterpiece.  Overall we were very satisfied with our meal and we are eager to come back and explore the menu.

The service was friendly and attentive.  I did find it funny that when I called and inquired what they had for vegetarians, the response was "" We have a chicken burger and a fish burger""??  Then when we visited the restaurant we asked to see the menu prior to seating and asked the same question, a different person responded with ""we have a fish burger and a chicken burger""??  I was laughing on the inside and maybe a little on the outside thinking that vegetarians eat chicken and fish.  Oh well nothing that a good informative book and a little more training could not fix.

We ordered the ronin and Kiki burger with truffle fries. After placing our order, we saw a plate of oxtail fries go by and decided we had to get them. We flagged down our waiter and asked him if we could get the oxtail fries instead of the truffle fries. He responded with that he already placed the order and it's probably too late to change our order. This was less than 5min of placing our order. So, he walked away and updated us 10min later that our food would be coming any minute now. So, we asked him if he was able to amend our order and he replied with, after taking our initial order, he put it in right away and you can't make any changes. If he were to have made changes he would have to pay out of pocket for the $5 fries we originally wanted. Excuse me? When have you ever gone to a restaurant where they can't accommodate you and the waitstaff would have to pay out of pocket because a customer changed their mind? When is it ever acceptable to respond that way to a paying customer? Isn't this a customer service industry? 

I understand if we waited and food was already served, not being able to change your order, but this was seriously within minutes of placing our order we wanted to change. And we are talking about fries here! 

We filled out the form they give you with the bill if you'd like the manager to call you and I even called the next day and left my name and number for the manager. No call back and it's already been 5 days. 

I am so disappointed at this place. The food was good and reasonably priced. You can really taste the freshness of the food. After experiencing the lack of customer service, I would never want to eat at this establishment ever again.",L0NDMbrjV4R6volMakgPrQ,4,0,3,xc7nQrrvJVOAYSv-6KXr9g
2716944,2015-12-16,3,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I've been twice and the second visit reinforced the flavorful experience of the first.  In fact, it was probably better the second time.  After hearing a decent amount of buzz about Bachi Burger, the time came to give it a try.  Very tasty and definitely satisfying.

The first visit I enjoyed a Spicy Miso Burger with a side of the Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries (with Maui onion sea salt and garlic chili aioli).  On the second visit I tried the Ronin Burger and had Just Fries (with sea salt & pineapple ketchup) on the side.  Both burgers were delicious and I can't recommend one over the other, although I think the flavor of the Japanese Cole Slaw on the Ronin makes it my favorite of the two I tried.  My wife had the Myiagi-San's Burger and Just Fries both times.  I loved the garlic fries, but also love the pineapple ketchup that comes with the ""Just Fries"".  I'll face a difficult fry choice next time!
 
A burger and a side of fries is a very satisfying portion, so unless you have a huge appetite your tummy will be happy with these basics.  If you're at lunch with someone and want the same kind of fries, you may want to consider splitting an order to leave a little room to try something else on the same visit.  Needless to say, there's a lot left for me to explore on the menu:  an assortment of appetizers, Bao sandwiches and salads , and I intend to do it soon.

This location is in the Village Square shopping center located at the intersection of W. Sahara Ave and Ft. Apache Rd.  Because it's nestled between the Regal Cinemas and Rocket Fiz Las Vegas, there's tons of parking.  Hungry?  Swing in and give this regional chain (with locations in California and here in Nevada) a try.

I ask the waitress if the fries are coming, she replies no you didn't order any. I eat my burger, which was delicious. However I get my check to find I in fact did order fries and they never were brought out. I showed the waitress and she apologized. She offered to get a refund for the fries or to get them to go.. I replied no due to already being 40 minutes or so into my lunch here. It came to $20 for my burger and water. And the fries that she forgot about. Overall the food was great. Service was horrible.

I gotta say I have been a fan of Bachi Burger since day one, but I really like the Sahara location the best.    The actual restaurant is larger and the menu is larger too.  We got our fried calamari (which is not on the menu at windmill) and a manga burger.  They were both wonderful.  I really loved the plantation tea too, which they also don't have at windmill that I know of.  Its sweet ice tea but I think it has pineapple juice and mint in it too.  We had the pork belly buns too, and they were as good as ever.

I was in Vegas for a night and had my friend pick me up just so I could eat bachi burger, we went to the West side location, this location is a lot larger than the Henderson location I have been to.  The servers are super friendly and talkative.  We were seated immediately as there weren't that many people there on a Wednesday night.

I ordered the coconut taro milk tea $4, and my friend had one of their IPAs on tap. 
The coconut taro milk tea wasn't very good, it wasn't creamy or taro tasting at all, I think I will just stick to their burgers from now on. 

We ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries $11.5 to start, this dish was huge!! They gave a massive amount of fries, chili, and cheese.  I think this dish could easily have been split between 6 people instead of 3.  I ordered the Miyagi burger medium rare.  The burgers took about 15 min to come out, which was totally fine because the burgers here are always cooked perfectly!! 

My burger was delicious, the perfect combination of savory and sweet ( not too sweet mind you), the beef was soo juicy, and the bun was soft and fluffy.  Sadly I couldn't finish my burger because it was just too big.  I have had 3 -4 burgers here and have never been disappointed.

I cannot wait to go back to Las Vegas just to have your savory burgers in my mouth.  I would love to try your Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, Banh Mi Burger, Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and The Crusty Crab.  So basically the entire menu....

I wasn't able to experience the feel of the restaurant since I was sitting in the hotel room aching with tremendous pain, but luckily my best friend (Erica) and her boyfriend (Son) brought back the Pork Belly Steamed Buns as well as the Kalbi Burger.  That initial bite into the Kalbi Burger helped temporarily alleviate the sharp feeling in my leg.  And let me tell you, nothing could really get my mind off of it, so that means a lot.  What I loved about this burger was that it came with a side of Korean-styled, spicy red-pepper cucumbers also known as oh ee ji (Korean) or liang ban huang gua (Chinese) which is my absolute favorite Korean side dish of all time.  Their menu has Bachi Pickles but I'm unaware if they are referring to the cucumbers as described above. On the inside, the Kalbi Burger is light pink with juices oozing after each bite.  It has a thin crispy, brown layer from the sweet kalbi marinade and has kimchi, ko chu jang mayo, and green onions for added flavor.  Wasn't able to get a snapshot of the burger since it disappeared before I could get my camera.  Yeah, it was that good.  Love Korean food?  You'll love the Kalbi Burger.

Bachi Burgers' Pork Belly Steamed Buns were equally delicious!  These Vietnamese-inspired pork buns consisted of pork belly, hoisin, scallions, cilantro, Chinese black vinaigrette, and a boiled egg (which was excluded in our order).  I just remember the pork fat melting while the soft puffiness of the buns filled my mouth with the saltiness of the hoisin and the distinct taste of cilantro.  Bachi Burger is known for their creative Asian fusion burgers, but this wasn't necessarily the first time I've had something like the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  Can't remember where else I've had this dish, but its still a must-have especially if you would like order it as an appetizer and share with other people since they are bite-sized and comes in an order of three.

Thank you to both Son and Erica for introducing me to Bachi Burger, my new favorite, creative burger joint of all time.

Very Exotic and fresh, made to order, salt and pepper fries are insane, order one per person, kinda small.  Burgers are NOT small, just right, and so very perfect.   I recommend anything on the menu, I have had a few items and the are amazing.  Matcha Green Tea Banana Shake and all Shakes are off the richter, Myagi-San burger, amazing!  All the burgers are crazy good, pick one you wont go wrong.  Beef is fresh and juicy, fried to perfection.    Its a great burger for $12 with fries, $15 with drink for one, but its the best deal in town.    Bravo!  Try it, you will wont be sorry, if you like BEEF and FLAVOR!

I went there with my family for dinner (around 6:30 PM) & we had to wait for about 30 minutes. The small waiting area was packed, but the restaurant area still had some empty tables. Another couple commented about the empty tables, but the greeter said something to the effect that they didn't want to overload the kitchen and have a backlog of orders...not a good 1st impression.

However, once we were seated I found our waiter to be friendly & attentive. We ordered the following burgers: Mr. Ho's Burger, Miyagi-San's Wagyu Grass-fed Burger, Kiki's Burger & Black & Green Burger. My daughter ordered the Bachi Fish sandwich. We also ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries & the Bachi Pickles for appetizers.The fries were good, but not ""out of this world"" good...The Bachi pickles were a variety of sliced Japanese pickles, such as takuan, radish, etc. something you definitely have to have an acquired taste for... We all enjoyed our burgers, it was a different experience (positive) with the Asian fusion taste. My daughter said the Bachi Fish Sandwich was good too.

Everything was definitely pricier, but if you're looking for a different twist/experience  on eating a hamburger, I recommend giving Bachi Burger a try.

At a medium rare, the burger was oozing with flavor. Extremely happy with the burger especially after climbing a mountain.

There are a lot of beverages here including beer, hard cider, wine, sake, cocktails, milk teas, and tea. For some reason I went for a sangria AND matcha green tea. The sangria was tasty and pretty stiff. The tea though was a bit watered down, but you do get unlimited refills of this. After that scrumptious burger, I did opt for the Portuguese donuts with coffee gelato for dessert. The donuts themselves weren't anything special and a bit dry and I wasn't a fan of the 'gelato' since I didn't think the it paired very well. Still that mixture of hot and cold is hard to pass up.

They have cheaper/smaller apps on happy hour menu, oxtail chili fries! Complete with an egg on top.

Like I said, our waitress is always great. My drink is never empty, and we rarely had the same girl. Odd part, as I also mentioned, is getting seated. There are tons of empty tables, but we'd wait 15 minutes to get seated. Every time. A few times, we'd wait so long the hostess would forget and seat someone who rolled in after us first, and we'd have to remind her we weren't waiting for pickup or just chilling there for the hell of it.

Maybe I'm one to expect more at a seated burger joint, but it didn't meet my expectations. The service was slow, the burger was okay but nothing I'd come back for again. The plus--two years ago I commented on the original location that the patty was the consistency of baby food and that is no longer the case. I was shocked to find that the wagyu patty is glazed in a sauce.  Why?  If I pay that much for a burger, I want to taste the meat.  The miyagi burger had tempura onions piled a few inches high under the bun, a fired egg, bacon, the glaze and their other sauce.

So good, I went twice in one week.  I tried the Kiki's burger with the salt and pepper fries.  The burger was amazing and packed with flavor.  The fries had the perfect amount of crispy and zing.  The second time I tried the oxtail chili fries and green and blue burger. I actually liked the Kiki's better.  I was sceptic about the oxtail fries.. But again so tasty.  Not skimpy on the chili at all and the fried egg added so much flavor on top of flavor.  The strawberry lemonade was sweet with a touch of lemon.  The plantation tea was so refreshing.

I got the Spicy Miso Burger, tasted amazing. It was moist and they used the miso flavor very well. 

The reason for the three stars is because my group of friends received terrible service. I don't recall our server's name, he never introduced himself. But this guy just did not seem like he wanted to be there. He couldn't recall any of the milkshake flavors (turns out they don't have a regular chocolate milkshake, and the server had to come back and tell us that, guess he didn't know that in the first place). He literally replied with ""chocolate peanuts butter, strawberry and something...I don't know."" Well geez, don't you work there? 
He also forgot to add on the extra party that my friend ordered, and my friend decided to go without since it would've taken another 5-10 minutes to make. When it came to the check, I told him specifically what amounts is like split, he still got it wrong.
My group resorted to asking other servers around us if they had a regular milk tea (apparently they only have flavored...makes you wonder if it's all powder back there), and another server to grab ours so that we could ask for the check. All the other servers there seemed lovely and helpful, even the new guy, but ours was downright unpleasant.

However, I did see that they had some veggies on their on line menu that sounded really good, so I was pretty excited. It was pretty empty on a Tuesday night around 8pm. 

Our server was a little dry, but he was on point with filling drinks and patient with my complicated order. I ordered the meatless burger, no bun, bed of lettuce and no sauces (Made vegan). My boyfriend and two friends ordered their burgers and the oxtail fries. I opted for edamame (it was so good). The food came out pretty promptly and with no problems (I didn't have to send one thing back)! They loved the oxtail fries and their burgers! I really enjoyed my food as well. I would totally recommend my burger to any and all of my meat eating friends... The texture wasn't meaty (being vegan, I hate anything that mimics meat), but it was definitely a versatile dish that anyone could of enjoyed! 

Oh and they carry my favorite red zin! Seven deadly sins and at a fair price per glass considering it's price everywhere else. Our friends enjoyed the beer menu as well. We will all definitely be returning!",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,3,3,4,rykVad092DInN1HCKCJJ2A

Here's the thing, overall the food was good but the service was terrible. Our server (I think her name is Erica) was just rotten. From minute one she was miserable and started to make us feel bad for wanting to eat at this restaurant. Why????  She was training someone and I think he felt bad because he kept coming over separately to make sure we were ok. 

So for the food, we started with the garlic edamame which you can skip. They are sautéed instead of steamed and not that great and the garlic aftermath just ain't worth it for that one. My parents got the duck bao and said it wasn't great but they loved their Kiki burger. I got the lonely bird which was awesome as usual. The truffle fries were delicious as were their sweet potato fries, but I liked them better with a side of honey (just my personal preference). 

So if we decide to have Bachi burger again, I'll probably hope that we go back to the Henderson location instead for the better experience. And Erica, if you are reading this, I'm sorry for calling you out, but I hope you find a job that makes you happy, but Bachi burger just ain't it!

I got the Ronin burger which came with caramlized onions, cole slaw, fried egg, a yuzu sauce, and the BUN.  If you're familiar with the buns they use for the chinese bbq (Cha Siu Bao), this is the bun.   Sweet, soft, and heavenly.  Now only if I were 10 years younger and they had these buns Fudrucker's size, I'd be going to town!

All the ingredients are in perfect harmony.   In addition I had the parmesean truffle fries and the famous oxtail chili cheese fries.  The chili was no the sweet side - I would prefer some more heat but still very delish.  Be sure to flip the egg to get that runny yolk all up in your fries with the garlic aioli.

My girlfriend and I each ordered a different burger so we could sample each others. Sorry I can't remember what they were called but we didn't care for either one. The best compliment I could pay them is to say they were at least edible.

First things first, the table they sat us at was broken. One of the feet were missing or broken basically making the table a seesaw. Luckily they had some Vegas Weekly magazines up front I was able to slide under the leg to get it even, though my wife gave me a hard time about that! :P

Ok, on to the food (well appetizers first). Since we had a decent sized party we tried a couple different things. The stir fried edamame were great and cooked just right. And since everyone raves about the pork belly, that was definitely a must try. Those things are spectacular, the pork is super tender and the steamed buns are amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce, it's a little too sweet for me but still great flavor. We also got a couple different types of fries that I didn't care for much. The salt and pepper fries along with the truffle fries were just ok. Definitely not staple items off their menu. I will say though that the dipping sauces they give with them are awesome. Another thing I want to mention, even though aren't really an appetizer are the milkshakes...you can't leave without trying one. We tried the mocha nut fudge and salted caramel, just altogether awesome milkshakes!

As far as the ""main"" items go, there were a few things I did and didn't like. I've never tried wagyu beef so I substituted it into my Kiki burger and it is delicious! Not everyone at my table agreed with me but there's definitely a flavor difference and it's unbelievably juicy. They also use some great toppings and everything just tasted really fresh. I also can't say enough about their buns, super soft and really tasty. One of the main gripes I had about this place was their burger cooking temperatures. I love some pink in my burger but my wife doesn't and I'm used to seeing ""medium"" with some pink in it...not at Bachi. Their medium is extremely pink and in my opinion, was a lot closer to a medium rare. If you aren't a fan of pink in your burger, make sure you order your burger medium well at least. 

Even though pretty much everything was good, they are a little pricey.  For 7 adults and 1 kid, our bill was $210 and some change, before tip. They have decent service but it slowed down quite a bit by time we sat down at 8 and the food took a while to come out. I have a feeling that now knowing a bit more about Bachi, I could probably easily bump this up to 4 stars next time I eat there since I'll definitely be coming back.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,0,0,3,4UrTSyJjnpFatSK7JTjD0A

Short version: if you like hamburgers, you must try this place.

Long version: LOT of flavors happening in this food.  The fries are excellent in their own right, and topping them with oxtail chili, cheese and jalapenos turns a side item into an appetizer (or a meal).  The bahn-mi burger was both delicate and hearty, with perfect layers of sweet, savory, spicy and sharp notes in each bite.  My wife had the miagi burger and I got a bite of it, but it was much more subtly delicious and did not stand up to the flavor-forward burger I was already consuming.  She loved it, and the onion rings in her burger were extremely good.

The place is nice with a modern feel, clean and well-ordered.  We experienced no problems with service, our server was spot-on before and during the meal, though after finishing we waited a little longer than we wanted receiving the check.

We will definitely return and bring friends to try it, and I look forward to tasting some of the other really-interesting-looking stuff on the menu.

P.S. You can get a 'regular' burger and fries if you're not adventurous; I will one day because the quality of ingredients and skill of prep promise to make it one of the best burgers in Vegas.",Q2q3swXJRaNhS4CGTy_kzg,1,0,4,ACjXwwjiI0isg9ENB9CCJw
3217870,2012-12-04,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Just like everyone else, my family and I came here because it was featured on Food Network.  I'm a huge fan of that channel and I wouldn't pass up trying something that Guy Fieri got to eat!  Of course because of this we had high expectations.  What do you expect?

First thing's first, this place was really crowded. There were limited seating in the waiting area and the wait was about 45 minutes.  Now I'm not going to tear this place a new one just because the wait was long and I can feel people practically breathing over my shoulder.

Food was really pricey however, they were delicious. We ordered the ribs as an appetizer and they were fall off the bone.  They used great sauce and plating was really nice.  Only downside is that the ribs were so tiny and for $9 it only came with 4. it was kind of ridiculous.  We each ordered a different burger and we all felt they were surprisingly good.  They were just so many flavors embedded into each burger, almost too many flavors, but it wasted great.  

I also ordered the Almond Boba Milk Tea.  Worst decision I've made.  The boba was just disgusting.  It was so tasteless and I was tempted to ask them to strain it out, but that would be rude.  Every initial sip tasted good cause the milk tea wasnt bad, but after drinking the tea you're left with several balls of boba in your mouth that you're just chewing and chewing... and chewing... and chewing....

So far, food was definitely a 4 star or 4 and a half star range.  However....

The service was awful.  Just so terrible.  Service is what brings customers back.  Just because you're on Food Network and you get a continuous busy flow of customers does not mean you can completely disregard customer service.  After we were seated we were completely forgotten.  We were seated closest to the hostess and the front doors as well.  Our waitress was rude.  Her name was Claire.  She was extremely pushy when suggesting appetizers and she just sounded like she wasnt havin it.  

If it wasnt for the tasty food, which sadly took an hour to get, I'd give this place a solid 2. Actually I'd give it a 1, but the hostess was nice.  She had to personally get our check for us because we were waiting for it for maybe 30 minutes after clearly finished eating, and then it took another 20 minutes for them to take the check away.  Near the end we were all simultaneously bashing the restaurant's service and it made us forget how good the food was entirely.

If its your first time, sure, try the food just to say you've tried this place.  We probably wont come again though, it isnt worth it.",WFU7uZJmoDwE1lFTsm7lFQ,4,1,3,SbGB_A7kPS4UzkoUORCYwA

The atmosphere is nice right by the movie theatre so a good place to take a date before or after a movie. Easy parking. The place is never usually too busy.

Apparently they put an item on the menu that they don't have a clear process for delivering. As well the server did not ask if we wanted fries with our burgers.

No one greeted us when we walked in and we waited 5 minutes before being seated. My Dad asked one of the servers for extra spicy mayo and he went on and on how they had to charge us extra. No big deal just bring it. I felt like it was a chore for them to bring us extra napkins and refills on the coffee. I will not go back to this location.

Oxtail chili fries, pork belly buns, duck buns, sweet potato fries, salt & pepper garlic fries, and all the burgers are great.  Good selection of craft beers and my kids love their milk shakes.  

So why only 1 star??  Management (or ownership) here is terrible.  

There is never a host at the front, so you have to wait for one of the servers to free up some time to seat you.  

They don't have bussers, so usually we bus our own tables by putting our empties on an empty table next to us.  

They don't have an expeditor in front of the kitchen, so sometimes your appetizer will come after your entree.  

The servers are very nice.  They try hard.  They work hard.  

Finally today after several mishaps, I asked our server why the quality of service is so poor.  

He explained that the owners expect the servers to seat customers, bus their own tables, make milkshakes, etc.

I assume it is the reason the restaurant was 1/2 empty during 7pm dinner on a Friday evening.

Oh yea... and then we ordered two burgers to go.  Each cost $15.   They wrapped it in paper and but them in a bag.  lol.  Not a box.  Not a container.   They put it in paper like fast food drive thru.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,1,0,1,df6tVgqAXdcydoKIuNZtKg

Every 3 months I try to give this location another chance, and it never gets better, sometimes even worse.

I can tell the staff is polite but they are often inefficient in taking your orders, fulfilling requests and come across as being inexperienced. Even though it's been a whole year since they've opened.

Once you order with the waiter, expect to wait more than half an hour for a burger. Don't ask me why it takes that long to cook up a burger.

And god forbid if you need to change something on your bill. Because they will have to ask someone else to do it, and who knows what happens after that... but I found myself annoyed and tapping my feet next to the register after 15 mins of waiting and trying to catch someone, anyone's attention.

Me.. I'm kind of over the fact that the burgers are kind of expensive for what they are, and they don't even include fries. Not a huge deal, except for the fact that if you order the fries separately, you'll find they really aren't that good. Nice and crispy, but they lack in seasoning. I tried the truffle fries, and the sauce was good, but the fries were still flavorless. 
The last time we were here, I ordered my drink and waited 20 minutes for the server to get it. He had completely forgotten about it, and the restaurant was empty. And no, he didn't magically remember, I had to flag him down to inform him of the obvious. No refills either.

After 25 minutes for them to put sliverware on a table we ordered the ""pickles"" appetiser,  not a good choice. Not sure what is was supposed to be. But it wasn't good.  The friesthat  came out cold  - on both of our orders. And then when my caesars salad came out with chicken - I ordered it with a crab cake - I wanted to rage, but, instead I just asked for them very politely, to make me a new one? Instead of picking the chicken out - She goes, ""Oh, I can take the chicken out.""  I said NO I have a reaction to chicken. Please make me a new one she said Okay, I will take the chicken out.. I was like, HUh? No please do not do that..... WEll, I inspected the salad when it came back and was hopeful I had a new one. But, half way down the bowl I ate and Uh-oh, what did I see but chicken chunks.... I almost blew chunks rite then and there!! After asking for the Mgr -20 minutes for the manager to come over. 25 more minutes after I told her what happend. I was having a panic attack. My stomach was doing flips. I didn't know how much I ate or what ""juice"" of chicken I had. When I asked for the Manager again - seriously, yes, again... (what was she doing, hiding from me?) she came out with the chef. At this point I was gagging and had to leave. I didn't want to listen to the excuses of why  - - just get me out of here. Oh, yeah, and thanks so much for the phone call to see if I was okay??? You people have no clue how to cook, run an eating establishment or give any and I mean ANY type of service. This fly by night opperation should be shut down.

ARE YOU JUST OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL ELECTIVE COOKING CLASS 1O1 ? No, I am sure they would've taught you guys to re-make it espcially when I had to ask - And still, you didn't.

Service: Very attentive and not shy about suggesting their favorite burgers, which was helpful for me as a newbie. Water never got less than half full (and was refilled & looked after by everyone walking by, not just my primary server).

Food, the meat of my review (har, ha... Nevermind): I got the Kiki Burger, taking the recommendation of one of the wait staff, because mushrooms kick ass. Holy double-hockeysticks, this is one delicious burger. I ordered medium-rare (the cognoscenti's level of doneness...) and it is fantastic. The bun's toasted like Texas Toast, the spring greens are crisp, the burger is juicy. I've long-since forgotten the type of sauce that it comes with (which I quickly taste-tested with a tempura-fried onion ring) but it's all over my buns and has a nice complimentary sweet-spice to it.

3365548,2013-02-05,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Short, sweet and to the point. That'll be my review (at least, I'll try). Not the actual experience.

Let's get the inevitable bad part out of the way now. Service:

Overall, not very good at all. I won't blame the wait staff, but will wholeheartedly blame the management. Obviously properly scheduling staff is not a required skill when applying for a managerial position there and that lack of restaurant 101 expertise results in a devastating cascading effect on quality of service.
Too few waiters = lots of empty tables = long wait before getting seated = very long time before server acknowledge you = past the point of dehydration before any water on table = alcohol withdrawals symptoms creep up before getting chance to order any drinks = you have whole menu memorized by heart before server finally take your order = hunger pain substitute for the tremors caused by the earlier lack of alcoholic content in our bloodstream = you sob with joy when your much anticipated meal is being displayed before your teary eyes.

There was very little happiness and smiles, just busy waiter bees trying to catch up, no team effort. It all comes back to bad training and no business culture.

Food:
I have to be fair and can't really complain about my own stupidity defying common sense of food pairing. So, I'll refrain from any negativity until I try again in the future.
See, what I did, was a giant ""fusion-nouvelle-burger cuisine"" faux pas. I dared to customize my options with elements that probably did not compliment each other and  it took away the taste of the meat. Next time, I will order without customization and render a proper food review.

3 last important notes:

1) Do not order the Kobe option if you plan to have various condiments, sauce, etc. Kobe beef burgers are meant for burger purists and cooked rare to medium rare and not meant to be overwhelmed by options. You'd waste your hard earned money as chances are that condiments and toppings would overpower the beef's taste.

2) Fries are good and options are tempting, but in most cases the toppings are also too sparse to make a huge difference. Maybe ask for extra to make a difference.

3) Website: Don't bother, It doesn't work very well and is the least informative. You can't see the menu because Mr. Webmaster decided to be creative with flash, yet failed to deliver basic needs for information.

3367955,2013-09-24,4,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I have a love hate relationship with Bachi Burger.  

Food: I've been here a couple of times and there is still not a burger that I would call my favorite or go-to burger.  All of the burgers are over $10 and they are cooked with a lot of unique Asian ingredients.  I recently had the Banh Mi inspired burger and it came with a fish sauce to dip in.  It was pretty good.  I had one in the past that was served on a purple taro bun.  Very interesting.  Sometimes I feel that there is so much going on in the burger that I kinda get lost in all the tastes trying to decipher the flavors.   I do love their oxtail chili cheese fries though.  Skinny fries slathered with soft oxtail meat and chili.  There is a crapload of scallions and a sunny side egg on top.  Delicious!

I usually come when we have visitors from LA and need to take them somewhere that will satisfy everyone, LA loves their asian fusion burgers and tacos lol.  (FYI They are building a Bachi Burger on Sawtelle in LA!)  It is kinda pricy to just come here to pick up a burger but it is a crowd pleaser.  

My main gripe is there is often a long wait and a lot of tables available.  This kinda angers me and other people have experienced this problem too!  Fill your restaurant and don't tease me with empty tables that you don't plan on using.",Gr-MqCunME2K_KmsAwjpTA,5,3,4,5E7LbIr-ftxCK5RBAe96vQ

The place is really big but does not seem to have enough people to staff it.  There's always a wait when there are tables available in plain sight.  Aside from that, this place rocks.

We ordered a happy hour serving of the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  It's so unique that it has fried egg on top.  It was really delicious. My husband and I devoured the whole thing in minutes.  My mom ordered sweet potato fries, which was good.  The happy hour menu also had the option for sliders.  My mom got it, she does not like sweet things and this burger was sweet so we switched food.  I got the Black & Green Burger with American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, Sautéed Mushrooms, Spinach, Bacon, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, and Roasted Garlic.  The burger was good but seems to be a little on the bland side.  My husband ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger with Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings.  This one was a clear winner!  The flavor combination was just amazing.  It was not too salty, not too greasy, it was just perfect!  I'm coming back here to get a Miyagi-san for myself and have more of the Oxtail Chili Fries.

We went to their location on Sahara Ave, which is a 20-25 minute drive from the Strip, and kind of in the middle of nowhere. Their other location is closer to the Strip, but much busier. This location didn't have a wait at all (we went on a Tuesday around 11:30am), so we were seated right away and placed our order quickly. We tried:

-Pork Belly Steamed Buns (Duroc Pork Belly, Cilantro, Scallion, Radish, Boiled Egg, Chinese Black Vinegar, Hoisin, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw#86Acu6zecLZU6FiYGJcb_A): Yum- really good pork belly buns. The buns were nice and fluffy, and held up to the pork belly well. I loved how all the ingredients worked together in this dish- highly recommended!
-Shogun Burger (Wagyu Beef, Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach, $26, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas-2?select=lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw#lxq7Rgfk1DvnFYx8IArVlw): There are a LOT of ingredients in this burger, and most of them work really well together. However, you really had to smush the burger down to get the whole burger in one bite. I think there would be less clash in the flavors if you took out the unagi and peach, but I just took my pieces out and ate those separately. Although I enjoyed trying this burger (and the richness of the foie gras), I wouldn't order this again since it was too flavorful for me. 

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch at Bachi Burger, and it was a nice change from always dining at a place on the Strip. They have a very extensive burger menu as well as Asian influenced snack type dishes, so I would love to come back and try other items/burgers.

Bachi Burger was able to inspire me to write one.

The theme of the day: ""Bachi Burger?  More like Bachitty Service Burger.""

Here are some of the highlights:

We had a group of 12 people.  Plenty of room to sit. It took about 20 minutes to get seated.

It took 15 minutes for anyone to stop by our table.  That's when the busboy spilled water.  Which is no big deal, but he didn't wipe it after he spilled it.

10 minutes later we finally place orders.  I tell the waiter about the spill, the busboy comes back, wipes the water on the ground.  I tell him about the table, uses the same towel he wiped the floor with.

Gave 4 of us plates for the 4 orders of fries we got.  We had to flag another busser down, but we never got more plates.

Asked for napkins, never came.

Water is completely empty for half the table, they see it, we have to ask again for a refill.

Honestly, it's frustrating to write all of this.  It shouldn't take 2 hours to have a burger with your family.  It's a shame too because I thought the burger was pretty good.  I've just never seen such horrific service, and a failure to understand that bad service was being offered when it was clear as day.  There were too many workers there to not understand.

On my last visit to Bachi Burger, I ordered the Miyagi Burger cooked medium rare. The juicy burger patty was topped with lightly battered and fried onion rings, chili mayo sauce,  and a fried egg -- this was actually what ""made"" the burger. Adding a fried egg to burgers is probably one of the best culinary ideas ever. Also ordered was a side of sweet potato fries with a container of aioli for dipping. I do like the seasoned fries I've ordered in the past, but nothing beats the simplicity of these sweet potato fries.

We ventured off The Strip... I'm telling you this is way off The Strip.  If you have heard of the LV residential area, Summerlin, it's in that neighborhood.  The trip there didn't start off well... 1)  We went the wrong direction on Sahara.  2) We were crunched on time... my boyfriend and I were leaving Vegas that night.  3) We were all hungry and wanting the burger!  We finally made it there.  It's shares the parking lot with many other businesses like a movie theater.

When we entered there were many empty tables... it was a Monday.  We looked over the menu, since there was four of us we were thinking to get four different burgers to try a little of everything.  Sorry I put a crack in that plan because they wanted one with blue cheese... I don't like blue cheese.  So we just ordered what we wanted... the guys ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, my friend choose the Black & Green Wagyu Burger, and I choose the Kiki's Burger (According to the server, this is one of the most popular burgers).  My burger was okay, I wish I had ordered one with the Wagyu just because the quality and taste of the beef is soooo much better than the Angus.  I think the next time I go, it will be the Miyagi-san burger for me.  We also ordered the ox-tail chili cheese fries.  I think they were okay, personally I don't like cilantro and beans, which they have to the chili.  I think the flavor of the chili was good with the cheese and surprisingly the fried egg on top.  Personally, I wouldn't order it again, unless someone else wanted it.

Overall, service was good.  Nothing to complain about.  A point of advice is... if you like your burgers well done... do not order the Wagyu, it will just throw off the texture of the beef.

I have to take 1 star off for service and a ridiculous story. My roommate used to work at the Blue Diamond location and knows the menu fairly well. He ordered a burger medium rare and it clearly came out on the verge of well done. When he said something the head chef had the nerve to come out and say that's how that particular burger looks when it is medium rare.

Seriously, where I come from, there isn't any kind of burger joint like this.  From the Wagyu burger to the kalbi burger, even the kale chicken salad, Bachi Burger does is right with flair!

Both times I've been here, I have been blown away.  The oxtail fries are to die for, creamy in sauce, deliciousness in the oxtail meat, seasoned perfectly with the right amount of seasoning. Fries cooked very well to taste, crispy and flavorful.  Top it all of with scallion garnish. It's definitely an order to share, unless you're feeling extra gluttonous.

The kalbi burger with the kalbi sauce, fried egg, kimchi is amazing as well. Cooked medium rare, the juices were bursting with beef flavor, balanced out by the fried egg. A medley of kimchi, and kalbi sauce, complimented each other perfectly.  Also helped tremendously are the buns.  Soft and flaky, border lining on buttery, rounded out the burger, elevating it above the rest. 

On my second visit, I had the pleasure of eating the Shogun burger, with its Wagyu beef (a $30 burger no less) patty.  Creamy, thick and tender.  Arguably the best burger I've had in my life up to this point.  The tenderness is balanced out by the crispy onion rings in the middle, and did I mention the bacon?  Somehow, even the bacon tasted like it absorbed the Wagyu flavors, and a creamy fried egg makes this burger to die for! 

The spot is very inviting, and warm.  Very spacious in the ebb and flow, staff friendly and efficient.  They handled our party of 14 like a pro in my second visit.  Everyone received their food within 5 minutes of each other once food came out after 15 minutes of ordering.  It's ways off the strip, but if you have a car, definitely make your way out to the neighbourhood of Summerlin where Bachi Burger is located.  If taking a cab, it's about $30 each way from the strip and back and a 30 minutes ride.

There's also a movie theatre next door if you want to take it easy in your visit to Vegas.

Side note, the burgers are cooked on a flat top Hibachi grill, hence the Bachi in the Bachi Burger.

The wife went with the kiki burger -- always a good choice. New to the menu (at least since the last time I went to Bachi Burger) is their lobster roll ($15). It's two mini buns stuffed with lobster mixed with fennel and a curry spiced aioli with lettuce. It may not be a traditional lobster roll flavor, but the curry creates a unique and tasty asian-inspired version of this classic. The freshly fried taro chips that accompany the dish were delicious as well.

Service was good, especially considering that the place just opened earlier this week. Although it was odd that my wife's burger came out several minutes before my food or our son's food did. But, I'm sure minor issues like that will improve over time.

A lot of the reason it took so long to try is because I am not fan of burgers. While hanging out with one of our best-est buddies Joshua G and his wifey we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.

Upon entering there were plenty of tables open but maybe not enough servers or something. The hostess told us as well the customers coming in after us that there would be a small wait so the severs could catch up. After being seated our drink orders were taken right away. I have to say the service here is great. Our server was fantastic. 

I knew I wasn't going to order a burger so I took a look at what sides and salads they had to offer. I decided to go junk food style and order some ""Crispy Onion Rings"" priced at $3.50 and ""Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries"" priced at $4.50. The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were good but I sure didn't taste any garlic. Paying extra money to have the garlic fries I do expect it to actually taste like garlic fries. My man ordered a ""Bachi Burger"" and added cheddar cheese and bacon. He did enjoy the burger but not for the price. I feel personally that for the price of the burger it should have came with fries instead of paying separate for them. I don't want to go to a burger place that looks like they just threw a few random *fancy* things on the walls just so they can charge me a la carte for everything. I have no problem paying a la carte for a establishment that enforces a dress code and doesn't have kids running around the tables. 

Bachi Burger doesn't taste terrible but is not worth another trip for me. It doesn't have any *wow* factor for the price.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,19,16,3,GgA0pmDKnOmQpz5wNn1Nhg

My wife tried the grilled pork belly buns and they were also delicious, cooked perfectly and full of flavor. 

I tried the 7 oz. Angus burger which was perfectly grilled and coated with a tasty soy based sauce.

3554714,2012-06-06,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I'm a huge fan of Asian cuisine and I love me a good burger as well, so when someone suggested the new Bachi Burger location for dinner a couple of weeks ago, I didn't complain.  We had a party of four and showed up for a later dinner (9:00ish) on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was quiet but I instantly liked the ambiance and modern feel... The hostesses that greeted us were not the most welcoming, or perhaps they were confused since we asked if we could sit at a table that was vacant but hadn't been cleaned yet instead of sit elsewhere.  Once the seating situation was settled, the staff was friendly-ish, but the service itself was on the (very) slow side.

We were all pretty hungry, so we ordered some apps for the table to start with: Bachi Pickles, Edamame, and Truffle Parm Fries.  The pickled plate isn't ideal for sharing, but the others made  up for it and our party demolished both.  For my entree, I went for the Bachi Fish sandwich and added shishito pepper.  I happen to love shishito pepper, but when I've had it at Asian / International inspired places before, it's cooked. The shishito pepper on my sandwich was not - oh well.  Lesson learned: I like shishito pepper best when it's cooked!  The fish itself was cooked to perfection and of course the fluffy bun it was served on complimented it well.  It was fluffy and sweet.

The others at the table had a Mr Miyagi burger, a Spicy Miso burger, and a Lonely Bird.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their respective orders.  Most of us had iced matcha green tea to drink...

From what I hear, this location is fairly new, so they likely just have to work through some kinks with the service.  I'd definitely be open to returning in the future once that happens.  If you're craving a simple burger, or even something a bit more creative, you can't go wrong with the food at Bachi Burger.",dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg,6,7,3,C9-C9pwHnsb5gGxE1-la9Q

The Asian style burgers have a lot of flavor, plus there's a great bun-to-everything-else ratio, and our favorites are the Ronin Burger (onion strings, fried egg, generally awesome), the Kiki burger (mushrooms, bacon sweet onion marmalade), and those chili oxtail fries which are heaven in a bowl.

My second time here for a late dinner. We ordered the Bone Marrow Jam: it was decadent, and since it's a jam, it's a little sweet. The bread was nice and crispy, and the foie gras butter just adds that extra umph to the bite. 

Black and Green Burger was cooked perfectly. Medium rare was just the way we like it. The meat also has some sort of sweet flavor to it and the blue cheese complements it. 

I really liked the Banh Mi burger.  The mix of shrimp, beef and pork patty made it a unique and flavorful bite.

Their burgers are large and their sides are reasonably priced.

The service are on par.

Oh! we found a new love, a very flavourful sake called Wakatake ""Demon Slayer,"" fruity with a nice aroma and hints of peach and tangerine. We purchased a 720ml bottle to take home. $42 seemed high but hey you get what you pay for.

Neither of us eat burgers as part of our regular diet but I had been having a hankering for a burger for couple of week and I jumped at the opportunity.

Boy, did I hit the jackpot!  We both ordered their Kiki Burger. This variation includes carmelized bacon (you read right), sweet onion marmelade, sauteed Shitakee, Enohi, and Eryngil mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, and an interesting mix of chopped baby greens including frisee and maybe arugula and baby spinach. They include a garlic chili aoili on the side that adds a nice little heat kick. For the bun, they toast a Taiwanese sweet bread. The hamburger is a flavorful Angus beef. I ordered mine cooked medium.

This is the first burger in memory that I didn't want to slather with ketchup to boost the moistness and the flavor. The Kiki Burger didn't need it and held up until the last bite. The textures enhance the experience. You bite the sweet bun and hit the crispness from the toasting until you encounter chewy bits of the carmelized bacon then the beef patty.

The other burgers offered didn't look as appetizing and the descriptions veered into Asian-influenced wierdness. A burger with kimchee? Maybe another time...

The burger by itself was $10, an incredible value given the inflated prices we'd been paying for food along the Las Vegas Strip. Fries are extra but one burger is more than enough unless you are a glutton or on a weight-gain diet.

I learned from doing a web search that Bachi Burgers is a little Las Vegas phenomenon with about ten locations. The manager told us they are opening their first location outside of Vegas in Los Angeles. Remember the name. If you are in

The burger was beyond good.  I've never had a burger this good and 5 Guys Burgers and Fries used to be my number one burger.",CaajeceFCAYdWW9GoNVZmw,0,1,5,l2KWQuVbMHpD05rveD9nyQ

3715364,2012-05-19,1,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Husband: ""Let's go to this new place.  They have Asian hamburgers.""
Me: ""What the hell is an Asian hamburger?""

Thus began my discovery of the Bachi Burger.  Located in the Village Square on Sahara and Ft. Apache that is trying its darnedest to recover from a slew of closed businesses, I think Bachi Burger is going to be one of the flagship places in that renaissance.

SERVICE:
Very attentive.  Also, the host guy who sat us is hot, so that's always a plus.  We had about 4 people who work there come up to us and ask if everything was to our liking.  I really admire that when restaurants have multiple people checking on tables, so you don't have to search out your server if you need anything.

DRINKS:
They have some really cool, interesting sodas (that I think are made in house, but not 100% sure on that).  They also have many shakes, and sake inspired drinks.  I did try a glass of the sake-sangria, which I thought was pretty weak.  I wouldn't get that again, but would definitely get one of the before mentioned sodas or shakes on my next visit.

FOOD:
Ok, listen.  You need to get the oxtail chili cheese fries.  It's like a piece of art when it comes out, and there is a freaking egg on top like a cherry on a sundae.  Spicy, meaty, tangy, cheesy, and huge (it could feed 4 people easily).  Burgers were top notch.  I got the Mr. Ho's Burger, which came on a taro bun!  What?!?!  I don't know what Taro is, but I went for it.  It had a slight purple tint to it, but was super tasty.  The burger also has a nice heaping helping of mushrooms on it and the Hoisin sauce was on point.  My husband got the Ronin burger and asked for it medium rare, and by God, they made it medium rare perfectly.  Nice and bloody, not overcooked.

VENUE:
We went on a Friday night at 7:00 and there was ample seating, which surprised me.  I thought it would be packed.  Maybe people don't realize it's open quite yet?  Fine by me!  That means less of a wait for me to get another delicious Asian hamburger.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,4,3,5,Rm5E6G2AsyODlJ_2xaewVg

Kiki's Burger -- http://bit.ly/2lhHfbU
Angus Beef, Sautéed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli
It really is hard to resist!  The combination of the mushrooms with the bacon just add a serious amount of umami flavor to the burger.  

I also ordered their Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries -- http://bit.ly/2lg9CY4
No complaints with these fries.  Nice and crispy, garlic not too overpowering and the jalapenos added some heat.

My brother ordered the same meal, and we did not enjoy it at all - every ingredient is loaded with salt, and he isn't salt sensitive!  We ordered a small side of cole slaw, which was not only salt-laden but had an offensive flavor.  We asked the server to take the slaw back and remove it from our bill, but when the tab came it was still on there, and she said it could not be taken off.  She got the manager, who said to us, ""we don't remove charges from bills here.  When I go out to eat and order something I don't like, I don't order it there again.""  (yeah, right!  Imagine if we had sent our turkey burgers back and had to pay for them plus replacement meals!!)  He then decided to remove the charge - a whole whopping $1.50!!  They've lost our business forever!

Great choice! 

We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, but it was worth it. 

I ordered the Miyagi-sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. It was piled high, mostly with the beef patty and onion strings. It was hard to put in my mouth, but once I managed to smash it in, it was like biting into my dream food. Juicy, plump meat with fresh, perfectly cooked bacon and onion strings. Ahhh, so good.

We also ordered a sangria, which I didn't care for, but finished anyway. It was a tad too bitter for my taste. 

We also tried their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, which came in a large portion, and were also very good, but had slightly unusual toppings. I've definitely never had chili cheese fries with fried egg before. But it was good!

It was a very slim Oriental young man and he had a major attitude like he was either stressed out or upset. They were not even that busy. So we ordered the lonely bird and he told us that they're out of that. This is a Friday night and they're out of their turkey / chicken burger that from what I understand is a popular meal.

We went in late afternoon and were seated immediately--there were only two other tables occupied.  Our server was Allen and he was very good about answering questions.  He first found out we were first timers, so he was eager to help.

I ordered the Black and green burger, a burger made from American wagyu with mushrooms, spinach, bacon, bleu cheese and garlic.  I thought my wife would get a plain burger with cheese but she surprised me by wanting the Kiki burger.  We also got an order of salt and pepper garlic fries.

The burgers were fantastic!  We each enjoyed what we had ordered.  The burgers were very juicy and I love the soft buns they make fresh daily.  The fires were good but I didn't taste any garlic.  They were salted nicely and they had a couple of thin jalapeño slices which was nice.

It came time for dessert and we had decided we'd have the tasting of three flavors of ice cream sandwiches.  It turned out that they had sold the last ones the night before.  I asked if the molten chocolate cake actually took 20 minutes and Allen confirmed this.  We had no place to go so we decided to order the cake and just wait.  After about 20 minutes, one of the chef's came to the table with our dessert and apologized for the way it looked, assured us it would taste a lot better than it looked, and told us it would be no charge.  Something had gone awry and the cake just didn't hold its form and it looked a bit flattened.  He was correct--it was delicious.  I still want to go back and try the triple flavors ice cream sandwiches and I need to try their salted caramel, toasted marshmallow shake.

When we left, Andrea said to me that we should go there once a week.  I said no.  Maybe once a month or so but there are so many good places to try.  I really liked Bachi!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,5,4,1s_v6czDAn9pEiajUc_vfA
3972253,2017-11-28,1,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Loved the burger! Definitely pretty pricey, but delicious. I got the Miyagi-san burger with wagyu beef. The beef patty was soooooo goooooood. Slightly sweet, definitely tasted the beef and the slight char flavor from the cooking process. The burgers took a while to come out, but I quickly forgot how long I've waited after eating the burger. I always love the fried egg in burgers. Makes a creamy consistency and texture to the burger itself. I didn't know how to eat it because of the onion rings in it. But that also gave it amazing flavor. It was my mistake, but I didn't know it didn't have any vegetables in it, which would balance out some of the strong salty/sweet/char broil flavor that was in the burger.

I wish I had gotten the oxtail fries because we got the salt/pepper garlic fries and they were perfectly fried. Soooo goood. It had garlic chili aioli that complemented well with the fries, but it didn't have enough garlic flavor (in either the fries or the sauce). Though, take the quality of the french fry and mix it with the oxtail and I think I would've enjoyed it soo much.

My friend got the Lonely Bird sandwich and it came with a herb pesto which I loved so much and took that for myself to put in my burger to give it some herb flavor. I wonder if I could get the herb pesto in my burger instead of the chili mayo that my Miyagi-san burger came with. Maybe that would have a better rounded out flavor.

The Kiki burger was delectable and simply drowns your palate in rich burger juices with a touch of their unique sauce.

First, I wonder how different it tastes from their Angus blend as I didn't find the beef overly tender.  That said, the flavor was awesome.  I flattened it as I like them thin versus towering monstrosities, so much delicious spice broth oozed onto my plate.  

The caramelized bacon were in strips, Unfortunately, I thought it was some sort of relish.  $15...mmm...kinda pricy; I recommended the build-your-own Angus for a much better value play.

The item I had is not on the menu, but I saw a delicious-looking photo on their website, so I asked about it when I called. The Shogun Burger - kobe beef burger with seared foie gras, BBQ eel, and a special sauce. The bun was perfectly toasted and fluffy, the burger was medium rare, juicy, and delcious, and the toppings were awesome. It was a little heavy on the sauce (I'm not sure exactly what it was) so I would definitely ask for less next time, or even on the side. Also, it was a very very rich sandwich, so make sure you're in the mood for that before ordering.

SERVICE
Friendly and prompt. Service was on point.

FOOD
Everything was ordered by my self-proclaimed food critic friend. Here's what we got:

Shogun Burger: Consist of wagyu beef, unagi, foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter and yamamomo peach. $26 for a burger might scare some away but I personally liked this a lot. Asked the beef to be cooked medium rare and it was perfect as it could be, so tender and juicy. My main gripe about this burger was the unagi being too fishy. I would have enjoyed this more without unagi.

Truffle Parmesan Fries: Wow, flavor on fleek. Black truffle porcini cream drizzed on the fries had me asking, ""Can fries be this tasty?"" Apparently, it is possible.  Must get this if you are coming to Bachi Burger. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: As seen on TV. It can get spicy because of chili and jalapeno. I personally enjoyed Truffle Parmesan Fries more.

Salted Caramel Shake: Screw Starbucks and their caramel frap. Salted caramel shake with marshmallow here was next level. Perfectly sweetened with caramel and icy texture was super refreshing for me. 

CONCLUSION
Unique and tasty burgers/fries and good service. Can be on the pricier side because of high quality ingredients but worth it in my opinion.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,9,8,4,dB3OtEujAZyFlnjdPhq0Bw

Our last visit was such a mess that it would leave a sour taste in anyone's mouth.  I was disappointing because we had a first timer along and I had been raving...needless to say, she wasn't impressed.  

Both times I've been they have switched servers on us mid-meal.  This seems to cause a little too much confusion.  Our edamame took 30 minutes.  That is just a wee excessive for edamame.  We ordered tea, never got it, but were still charged for it.  My hubby didn't get peppers on his burger so they said they would get him some - everyone finished eating and his burger was cold and still no peppers.  They never even ordered them.  Just one thing after another,  It was frustrating.  

The food was still great.  I tried the chili chicken app, it was lightly breaded and flavorful.  I also tried the toasted marshmallow and salted caramel milkshake - very tasty!

The entrance is double doors even with the wall and with a tiny sign, so no indication at all of up-scale dining.

The other Azn factor is the hi ""bachi"" which the burgers are cooked upon.  No offense to my yf Lisa S. from Vegas, but this place failed in many ways.  It also received high ratings from other Yelpers, but I was very disappointed.

My friend and I ordered the Black & Green   ($13) and Miyagi ($14) versions.  The B&G has wagyu beef, blue cheese and bacon.  The Miyagi has furikake, fried egg, onion rings and bacon.  We also ordered parmesan truffle fries ($5) and onion rings ($3.50).

First of all, another table received their food before us even though we were seated and ordered before them.  To add insult to injury, I was starving and they ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50 w/ fried egg on top).  This plate looked awesome!  Despite the foregoing, the fries and rings were good when we finally got them.

Both burgers were ho hum - Nothing Special.  The B&G did not have much blue cheese and it was missing bacon on one side.   The Miyagi was just missing - it came out 15 min after my burger (and at the same time as another customer who was seated well after us).  When I asked the Mgr where the Miyagi was, all he said was there was a problem in the kitchen.  The real problem was that my friend's burger was served to another table because I saw Miyagis being served to other tables where the patrons came after us.

The Mgr did try to show us some luv by giving us complimentary Portuguese donuts.  We were eagerly expecting pao doce (sweet bread) or malasadas.  Unfortunately, what we received was fried dough that was the consistency of a cake donut on the inside, w/ the taste of cinnamon from a stale churro on the outside.  One word description:  NASTY!

My boyfriend and I came here last night, Friday April 12th. Bachi burger used to be one of our favorite restaurants, until last night, and we would come here at least once a month. We became dedicated customers since the first Bachi that opened on Windmill. We were so stoked one opened near us. 
I was being quite observant last night because the change was that noticeable. The usual atmosphere of Bachi Burger is now different and uncomfortable. 
I almost wanted to leave because it was freezing inside. My boyfriend and I sat down and the vibe of the place was completely off. The lights were extremely bright. The feel of intimacy was no longer there, which makes it a horrible place for a date night. The music was no longer smooth, jazzy electronic music, which gave it that Asian fusion vibe. Wasn't that the whole concept of Bachi? You could barely hear Frank Sinatra playing in the background as the blenders and customers conversations were actually louder than the music. It also seemed like they were short on waiters/waitresses, no greeting hostess,  and everyone in the kitchen looked confused. Our food arrived quickly, but it wasn't AS great as usual.

Lunch specials start at $19 and go up from there and I didn't feel like taking out a loan for a burger lunch

I ordered a la cart the regular 7oz Bachi Burger that only comes with lettuce, onion and tomato (no cheese) for lunch because it was only $8 (hear anything special so far for $8?) plus I had truffle fries for $4.50. Ok so now you all know I am cheap, on to the food -

The burger was cooked very well but simply nothing at all was on it except those three items. It was comparable to any other burger I have purchased. Now, they had burgers with all sorts of exotic ingredients available but those were too pricey for me ($12-$16 range).  The fries were good but you could get some just as good at Smashburger in my humble opinion. 

I don't mind paying good money for value. Maybe I'm not ""chichi"" enough for this place?  I definitely think value is overestimated here with the prices and have trouble because I could have eaten a steak at Outback down the street for less and been more satisfied.

I didn't pay attention to the time and with no time left, I convinced my husband that we should absolutely try this place. Of course I didn't pull my head out of my a** until after we ordered a ton of food, and I realized that it was very unrealistic to even think that we would be finished within 20min. 
(SMH... i know that's exactly what i was thinking--I'm such an as*^ole!) 

 And that's when it happened, that's when I turned into ""THAT""  person. --The person that just ordered their meal, and two seconds later wonders how much longer it will be. 
-The person who now has the patience of a 5 year old, and is forced due to their own stupidity and poor time management to tell the server to rush all the food
-The person who asks for to-go boxes and the check as soon as the food hits the table.
-The person who is frantically trying to hand over a credit card while inhaling food out of to-go boxes ( note to self: if you are in a hurry, then pay with cash!!!! )

I am so sorry for being ""THAT"" person. 
 :( I couldn't even enjoy the food, because I was inhaling it so fast... 

Either way, that is exactly why I love this place! They completely rose to the challenge! Not only did they serve us with a smile an absolute kindness, the food was incredible! They got me out on time, were very attentive, and even let me take ""happy hour"" food home
 (which I don't think they were supposed to, since their as**ole manager thought his staff and customers would appreciate him loosing his temper over it on the floor when he witnessed me receiving a to-go box.
 FYI- pointing at a table that is occupied, when you look like you are about to pop a vein, and simultaneously insist on raising your voice while disciplining an employee in the dining room that is full of customers, is not only poor management, but its inappropriate and it also may affect business. Just sayin... )

My boyfriend and I shared the Shogun Burger and the Oxtail Chili Fries. The Shogun Burger was one of the more expensive burgers ($26), consisting of Wagyu Beef and Unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo peach. The other burgers ranged about $10. We ordered it medium, but got it medium well. It wasn't really a big deal, but I know many people talking of having miscooked burgers. Other than that, it was amazing! Very flavorful, juicy, and well worth the money.

The oxtail chili fries are to die for. It comes with a fried egg on top of it, beans, peppers, etc. It was featured in an old episode of Guy Fieri's Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dive's, and it is well worth the hype.

Bachi Burger has been on my radar since I saw it DDD on the Food Network.  We were finally in the neighborhood and hungry at the same time, so we popped in for lunch.  When we walked in, the place was almost empty, but the hostess (who thought very highly of herself, if I do say so) said we needed to wait to be seated for a while.  We weren't in a hurry, so we waited, but thought it was weird.  We were finally seated 5 minutes later at a table that had been empty and clean the entire time.  We then waited at least 5 minutes for our server to come by to get our drink order.  When she came back with our drinks we were ready to order since we had been there quite some time by this point.  

We ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the Miyagi-san burger with the sea salt and pepper garlic fries.  The burgers were quite yummy and we liked the different flavors going on, but they weren't extremely special.  We did really like them though.  The fries were good as well, but not anything spectacular.   I didn't taste any garlic, onion sea salt, or really anything exciting.  They tasted like fries from a regular fast food joint, not gourmet fancy fries. 

The prices seem to be really high here as well.  I get that they are uber-modern, doing the hip fusion menu thing, and you have been on the Food Network, but I expected a little more umph for the price.  Our burgers were $10 and $13.5 dollars and we had to pay another $4 for fries.  The burgers were delish and probably worth the price, but I think the mediocre fries could have been thrown in, instead of a side item to add on. 

As for our service, all I can say is ugh!  I don't know what it is with my hubby and I, but we always seem to get the worst server in the place for our server.   We are so super easy and never high maintenance, especially since I used to work in the restaurant industry for years. Our server just seemed overwhelmed, even though I only saw her waiting on our table and 1 other.  She rarely checked on us.  I think we saw her 3 times the whole meal.  We got better service from surrounding servers, bussers, and the food runners.

So the food warrants a return visit because we did enjoy it.  I just hope we get a better server and tastier fancy fries.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,5,4,3,AA4EMIiHHqikU8rqIlejPQ

I had the Kiki burger.  Wow was this burger put together good.  The meat was tasty and flavorful. The caramelized bacon,  mushrooms and cheese make this one great burger. Even though this is like no burger you have ever made at home.  We'll unless your dad is a Japanese chef. So not traditional but a really great burger. 

Now on to the service. The hostess was having people wait even though the restaurant was half empty. I mean really.  Just because the is the norm when you are busy doesn't mean you have to do the same when you are not.  Please get your nose out of the air. As well wasn't to thrilled with the waiting staff either.  For crying out loud you serve burgers. Quit trying to be stuck up, or should I say quit being stuck up.

The carelessly prepared food fits at this suburban movie theater location, but not in a food-centric district like Little Osaka in West LA.

The pork belly steamed buns were nicely constructed with a savoy cabbage and carrot slaw, slice of hard-boiled egg, and hoisin sauce, but the meat was sloppily inconsistent. Of the three buns served, one had pork that was all meat and no fat, another had all fat and no meat, and another had the right balance (much like the three bears). A 33% success rate might work in baseball's batting box, but not when dining.

I liked the fries in the chili cheese fries, but that was about it. There was too much of the heavily spiced oxtail chili in ratio with the fries and the scant amount of cheese. The chili also showed signs of age. The meat had broken down to almost a paste, the mixture lost its ability to emulsify which caused the excessive amount of oil to separate out, and there was a sour taste like it hadn't been cooled properly from the night before. The fried egg on top didn't fit the dish.

I came here with the family and a game plan. We ordered a total of 8 burgers and split 6 among 5 people (the ""No Meat Here.. was for the vegetarian and we got 2 spicy miso). BEST IDEA ever, since we rarely come to vegas and wanted to try a little of everything. Everything we got medium except the wagyu - medium rare.

*Shogun Burger - Wagyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach.
 The is probably the most expensive burger on the menu but so worth it. Slightly sweet from the pear and peach but savory with the melt in your mouth Wagyu beef. AND unagi (eel)!!! they do not skimp!

*The ""Banh-Mi"" Burger - Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce. 
Who needs Lee Sandwiches when you got this burger. Absolutely perfect! You don't even need the pickled veggies on the side because it's perfectly balanced without it.

*Spicy Miso Burger - Angus Beef, Onions, Shishito Pepper, Mayo, Lettuce, Roasted Garlic, Swiss Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette.
Perfectly fried egg! When you cut into it, the yolk just oozes. Not spicy like Sriracha  spicy but as in a little kick for your taste buds. 

*Mr. Hos Burger - Angus Beef, Pork, Garlic, Ginger, Sautéed Mushrooms, Lup Cheong Sausage, Mizuna Lettuce, Taro Bun. 
That Taro Bun though! So good i'd buy the bun if they sold it separately. Flavors are light, sweet and salty and savory.

*Miyagi-sans Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, Crispy Onion Rings.
Onions Rings on a Burger?! I'm sold! 

*Kalbi Burger - Angus Beef, Kalbi Marinade, Green Onions, House Made Kim Chee, Ko Chu Jang Mayo. 
You definitely need to eat this with the picked cucumbers on the side. This burger was light in flavor so it relied heavily on the kim chee and pickled veggies to give you that punch.",HksMj2RBkQmaDTLaYML3BQ,3,1,5,WUbgWw-iVd5Ph0nUSWAdmw

We were off to a bad start when we waited to be seated (the restaurant was almost empty) longer than we should have. Someone finally noticed us and started seating us: ""this way please, er nope, sit here, ah no, I mean there, nope nope, there sit there""--please make up your mind and stop giving us a grand tour of the floor--we can do that after lunch. Finally, after all the confusion, the guy settled on a location and sat us down. A few more minutes of wait and our server showed up and took our order. We really didn't mind the waiting at this point so we just waited like normal people do.

After our orders came in, we noticed there weren't any napkins or utensils--basically our table was bereft of a proper table setup. Yes we know you eat burgers with your hands but we wanted to cut ours in half to cross-share, plus it's messy, plus other self-respecting restaurants do this. So we then asked a passing server/busboy if we could please get some napkins (while wiping the food off our face and hands with our hands) and at the very least a knife, he said ""surething"" and never came back. WTF. Our IDGAF server finally checks on us and we re-requested for the same napkins and knife we asked for earlier (she was appalled that we needed napkins and utensils, by the way).

So, let's get to the food review bit: the burgers are great, I forgot what we had at this point due to the irritations, but I remember it was Angus, medium well, and very juicy. Mine had the taro bun and both were suggested initially by our server which was a good thing. We also had the onion rings, which I must say is how onion rings should be done. The breading is thin and doesn't slide off when you bite into it, the flavor is savory and it's very light and crispy. The food was good enough that I almost forgot how irritated I was becoming until we had to wait again for our bill.

After our check finally came, there was another long wait for it to come back for us to sign off--our server did give us lip service that something was wrong with their system. Mmmkay. Then my wife noticed our bill was off by $6+ so she had to walk to the counter and ask our server why the price discrepancy from the check to what was charged. The bill was rectified but instead of refunding us the amount, the server says they have to charge us again and wait 48-hours for the other charge to be refunded to our bank.

At this point my wife just wanted to GTFO and leave. Yes we left gratuity because we're civil and nice people despite being treated wrongly. Will we ever come back here? Never. Will we recommend this to any of our friends or visiting relatives? Never.

4219629,2017-06-17,1,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"GLUTEN FREE REVIEW.

First I want to address the atmosphere. At first we were like ... ehhh. I don't know. It isn't NOT nice ... it's just very simple and very small. It also was pretty dead .... at 8pm on a Friday night. So we kinda wondered if it was gong to be as good as all the reviews claimed. 
I'm so glad that we didn't let any of that stop us from dining here!

First .... food taste/quality:

No complaints here 10/10! They don't have a gluten free burger bun. So I just had the meat and toppings. But that is fine ... room for more fries!! And we tried 3 of the fries, ha.
The burger was cooked perfect and very yummy  (I had kiki but subbed waygu. that sweet onion sauce on it is SO good) and all the fries were PERFECT (we had the regular ones that have jaleps, the sweet potato fries and also the oxtail chili cheese fries as an appetizer.) You must get the oxtail fries. So different and so good. Also the sweet potato were MUCH better than the others (that had jaleps) but they were good too! Perfectly crispy! 

Gluten Free Options/Knowledge:
They have to make your burger without some sort of sauce they normally put on all the burgers. But with so many toppings (and all the other sauces being GF) ... I certainly don't think I missed out on anything! They also let me know that they DO NOT have a dedicated fryer for the fries. They are cooked in same oil as onion rings. I decided to take the risk since I usually don't get sick from that. I may kick myself tomorrow .. but the fries were WORTH IT, ha. 

If I do end up getting sick ... I will have no way of knowing if the meal itself indeed had gluten or if it's from cross contamination. So that is why I chose to write my review now instead of later. If I get sick it will likely be my own fault for taking the risk with cross contamination! They did seem knowledgable ....so while it seems odd that some things are GF (all condiments, the chili on the oxtail fries, etc) .. because they did seem to know about gluten .. I trusted them!

I can see why this place has been voted one of the best burgers in Vegas. Burger was great .. but it was the fries that made the meal!",2Be-gBMkIeGTXNjcoxKMuw,1,1,5,KibKjqDs_QWZidTvM6nY5g
4226007,2018-04-22,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Bachi Burger is a hidden gem.  If you are in for an adventure and are not looking to eat an everyday burger this place is a must try.  

To start the place was a little hard to find at night.  Their signage is not lit and the place is tucked in the corner of a strip mall, off the main road (Sahara).  As you enter the entrance is very dark, but you are quickly greeted with a warm welcome from multiple members of their team.  The place is clean and has an urban feel to it.  Also great service from beginning to end.

The food.  For starters we had the Oxtail Chili cheese fries.  This is a winner!  Beware: it's a large quantity so you probably should try to order a half order(not sure if they offer). If you are there to have some beers this would be the one to order.

The burgers we tried:
The Miyaji San .... its a 5Star!  We shared and both enjoyed.

The Kalbi burger was underwhelming .... was more like a Teri glazed burger.  Could be it just wasn't for us.  

We'll be back.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and when we travel to Vegas next year, we'll bring our friends and try some of their other offerings.",S6uQnN8xeyHk0WShr5MPXA,1,0,5,BKsI8EFJus8DiiAfVu7dxw

4234051,2015-10-13,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"My beef burger of choice is The Miyagi San, because it caters to my personal palette. Like Wylie Dufresne when he meets a perfect egg and Anthony Bourdain when he eats that perfect egg. The moment is in the egg on top, people. On that note, you can add a fried egg onto any burger because they're so cool they totally let you add and even substitute. 

You can also create your own burger which is fun with so much quality ingredients. My man like this option. 

Also favorites: The Ronin and The Kiki. 

But my number one favorite is ""The Lonely Bird"". Or ""The Bird"" as I order it, a turkey and chicken burger and I add on bacon because their bacon is maple. Not lonely anymore.

4234374,2014-04-10,17,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Hands down, my favorite burger in Vegas! I don't even go for the fusion burgers (which are incredible) but rather a purists' version. Wagyu beef with cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato, and ketchup. Simple but sweet and a classic all the way! Why mess with perfection?

The burgers are always cooked on point here. I fluctuate between med rare and rare, and the fact that each time I switch it up and can tell the difference is a testament to the deft hands working the grill back there. The beef itself is pure, juicy, fatty indulgence. Add quality cheddar? A masterpiece. The buns here really set it over the top- a Taiwanese style sweetbread that's crunchy against the patty and veggies but supple on top, so that it melds itself around the rest of the burger.

If that's not enough to bring you in, the Bachi pickles should be. With a great variety of about 6, each made in house, it's such a great way to start- and end!- the meal, especially with its digestive properties. Crunchy sweet garlic, bracing daikon, vibrant radishes.. The rotation changes on any given day.

Out of all the fries, the salt and pepper are my favorite garnished with fresh leaves of cilantro, thinly sliced jalapeños and fried ginger. I love it with the Yuzu aioli.

Endless matcha iced green teas, a great beer selection, creative desserts- there isn't a reason for you not to drop by.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,31,25,5,dSumu9Rpem9SdlZItpXggQ

The first time, I had a plane to catch. By the time I was seated, and they finally came over to take our order, I had to leave.

The second time, I gave them a chance. Long wait, and by the time one of the ""hip"" waitresses came over, the ice in my soft drink had melted. 

The burgers were decent, but honestly, there is a Japanese Burger truck that goes to various locations. It's a lot better, a lot more fun, and better priced.

When we were presented with the check our bill for 2 burgers/ fries was 56.00!!!  I noticed they didn't take the crab off and when questioned was told that the chef tasted it and thought it was fine and that was their policy not to credit any food item just because you didn't like it.  I told the manager she should have told me before she reordered another item for me and if I have to pay for it I wanted to take it home, of course it was thrown out.  She then proceeded to lecture me about their food policy.  It seems to me when you are charging extra for an additional tablespoon of sauce and burgers and fries are 50.00 for 2 people you should get what you want without being lectured from the manager!!!

And I am so glad she got this so that I can walk away in peace, knowing where to come back when I want to stuff my face with the amazingness of burger heaven. 

I personally am a huge fan of a burger tasting closer to a classic burger, but to the next level due to something special. If that's you, then the kiki burger will satisfy your needs. The kalbi burger, on the other hand, would be enjoyable for one that really likes fusion flavors.

I came with one friend and waited 10-15 minutes for a table in a somewhat empty restaurant all because they were understaffed. Luckily the burger surpassed my expectations and that one star will be docked until the next time. 

I ordered the salt and pepper fries, the spicy miso burger, and I tried a bit of my friends' Kiki's burger. It was hard settling on a burger choice because every combo looked so damn interesting. After reading Yelp recommendations for the spicy miso burger I finally decided on it and boy was that a GREAT choice. 

First bite in and I tasted a crunch and then a parade of asian flavors dancing around in my mouth. From the potent ginger and soy sauce aroma in the restaurant I assumed that the burger would have the same pungent asian flavors. I asked for my burger to be medium well and it came out perfectly cooked, same with my friends' burger (which rarely ever happens, pun intended). I wish there was a way to explain how great the flavor pairings were but it is something you need to experience first hand. 

The size of the burger was perfect, not too filling and worth all 10 of my money. I love having some type of carby side dish and even though oxtail fries were a highly recommended menu item I sprung for the salt and pepper fries. You would assume from the title that they would be just that, but their was a kick of jalapeno, some cilantro, garlic, but the true taste changer was the maui onion sea salt, it was perfect with the aioli served with the fries.

4386539,2012-04-27,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Best burger in Las Vegas??? Getting there, if only the meat gets better. A burger should be juicy and hot. It should taste meaty, manly almost. Bachi has all the right ingredients for a fantastic burger joint. Great decor. Perfect bread. Exotics like Foe Gras. Right size burgers. Fries cooked and seasoned to perfection. I just wish the meat is better. I mean, Wagyu patties should taste significantly better than regular ground patties. But it doesn't, it's indiscernible because their side ingredients are cooked so well. 

My advice (I'm not a professional chef by any means) they need to:
1. Add more fat to the meat
2. Do not over cook or squeeze the juices out
3. Don't let it rest for too long and cool down.

Boyfriend ordered the $12 calamari appetizer which was all fresh and tossed in red peppers, mint and tomatoes. You get the rings and full tentacles. Served with a side of green oil which we couldn't figure out the taste. He loved it but me I cant stand seafood lol so of course when I took a bite to try I was sick the rest of my meal.

Everything is served a la carte so we ordered Parmesan truffle fries for $4.
Boyfriend ordered the Mr. Miyagi burger cooked medium. Presentation was cool but the amount of onion rings was a bit much. He really enjoyed it otherwise.

Honestly wasn't that impressed with my own burger. I ordered the Standard Bachi burger this only comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and a subtle BBQ drenched meat patty. All other toppings including cheese are an additional $1.50 each. I added cheddar cheese and applewood smoked bacon. Bacon portion was a little chinsy 1.5 pieces, really?? Why not give the full 2 pieces? Ok so I ordered medium well and it was pink/almost red all the way through. I didn't want to send it back but it definitely was not what I like. The sauce that covers the patty was such a subtle taste but was pretty good. 

The buns are amazing, some sort of Asian sweet roll that is baked daily and delivered fresh daily. 

Really wasn't happy with the soda choices, first off Pepsi eew. But to make things worse they only have Pepsi, diet Pepsi, Sierra mist and root beer. 

Total bill came to about $50 and we just weren't that satisfied for the price. Cool concept and I'm sure we will be back because the variety of items they offer. Definitely want to try the pork belly sliders !",y1hBRVR8kVx6htQsAa1mYA,1,1,3,qeazCowTYndJKXEDSL6_tg

I had the same burger I had last time, (Spicy Miso), but this time the patty was dry and there wasn't much flavor from the apple vinagrette.  My wife had the Bachi fish and her sandwich was much better than mine.

The worst part is that I think I got food poisoning because a couple of hours later I needed to find a bathroom BAD.  I was in Bally's and was hoping to make it back to our room at the Delano but I wasn't going to make it.  Luckily I found a bathroom in Bally's and was able to get some relief.

4414626,2012-09-07,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"My love for Bachi Burger is for reals. The OG restaurant was so banging that they opened a second location on West Sahara. Now before you think it's going to be a quick commute from the strip, it's really not that close. It's nearly nine miles from the Palazzo hotel. That's a $30 one way cab ride. Unless you don't mind a $60 to and from taxi fare, then I would suggest you come here when you have your own ride. It's situated in the Village Square shopping area right next to the Regal movie theater. It is however closer to the strip then their other location which was closer to Henderson. So if I had to choose between the two, I'd probably come here. Plus this location has a lot more working space especially for our party of 10 on this particular night.

There's no doubt about it that when I think of Bachi Burger, I fantasize about their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries $11.50. It's practically a must order and it's a great appetizer to share right out of the gates. Did I mention that is topped with a fried egg? That's how we Asians do it!

Although the Kalbi Burger $9.5 (angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo) is my original go to, I have found a new love. The Ronin Burger $10: angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli. I'd like to forewarn you that it may be a little on the sweet side but like the Kalbi Burger, it is dripping with greatness. Personally, both of these burgers are neck and neck and if I had to choose between the two, I'd rather rely on a flip of a coin to determine my fate. 

I had their Kiki's Burger $10 on the most previous trip and although it is stacked with lots of awesome ingredients (angus beef, sautéed shiitake, enoki & eryngii mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, ages gruyere cheese, and garlic chili aioli), it just didn't measure up to the other burgers I have mentioned. It's not bad but I probably won't order it again. The Banh-Mi Burger is probably my least favorite. I'd rather hit up Banh Mi Che Cali and get a real Vietnamese sandwich. It's a nice attempt but I'll pass.

There are a few other burgers on their menu that deserve a glance like Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. For you non beef types, they have a Crusty Crab burger, an Alaskan Cod burger, a ground chicken and turkey burger, and even a No Meat Here burger. 

Bachi Burger is by far one of my favorite burger joints and this is coming from a guy who has cut back on consuming one of America's favorite bites. The food always seems fresh and full of rich ingredients. The acute tastes leave nothing but awesomeness on your taste buds. The great thing about the post meal is that you walk out satisfied and not overly stuffed or in a complete lethargic state of mind.

Sunday evening-- Arrived around 6:45PM. No reservations needed.. although the place started to get busier by 7:00PM and seems like Han (who was great) was serving upwards of 7 tables simultaneously.

Everything at Bachi Burger, this Asian fusion burger restaurant, has so much taste. We made the fortunate mistake of ordering too much food-- thus having lunch for the next day.

1. Crispin Blackberry Apple Cider- Delicious tasting juice alcohol.

2. Oxtail chili cheese fries- Fries are crispy and good. It's a huge plate-- heavy enough to be a meal in itself or shareable between 4 people. It tastes just like chili cheese fries with shredded beef rather than ground beef. I think I would've rather gotten the bone marrow because I wanted that unusual meaty taste.

3. Pork Belly Bao Buns- I wanted only 1 but ended up with 3 (due to my lack of ordering clarity). They were delicious. The bun is soft and the cole slaw cuts nicely into the overall taste.

4.Risotto Loco Moco- I ordered this expecting the typical patty (Bachi style) drenched in gravy and a light risotto. When I say their food has so much flavor-- this is what I'm talking about in particular. Their patty is deliciously charred with the sweet, signature Bachi Burger taste. The onions are plenty and a good supplement (although there were too many onions for my taste). The egg and the scallions were a good top off. I also liked the risotto--- but not with this dish. Since the patty and everything on top is super tasty.. the risotto (and its cheesiness) was too much and out of place. I would have preferred plain white rice with the meal. The risotto is great-- but perhaps pair it with another protein or one not marinated so heavily.

Had the opportunity to enter their Disneyland giveaway by posting a photo of my food on facebook. I'm definitely a fan and enjoy coming here every so often.",M4uGs-0Fskn48t9icYk_Tw,2,3,4,UJrtgllc6v_bmb59P9hdAA

The Miyagi-San Burger is my usual choice because of the blend of flavors from the carmelized bacon on top of a Waygu beef patty to the stacked onion rings and fried egg.  Oxtail Fries make for a delicious start to the meal and the Bone Marrow Jam adds a subtle savoriness to the flavor explosion.  The Pork Belly Steamed Buns are another delicious choice either as a side or as a meal.  If given the option, be sure to upgrade to the Waygu Beef on your burger, you will be glad you did!

I have been waiting to go to Bachi for awhile. Just waiting for that perfect moment to spend $10+ on a burger. Yes, it is a tad expensive, but honestly it is worth it when you decide to jump in. 

Overall the experience was spot-on and the food was pretty much perfect. I had the Miyagi-San Burger, grass-fed Wagyu beef, Chili Mayo, Fried Egg, Furikake, Caramelized Bacon, and Crispy Onion Rings, and I added cheddar cheese for an additional charge. This burger came out perfectly, the bun glistened, the egg oozed, the onion rings were crispy, and the cheese was melted perfectly. The beef is high quality, the grilling to medium-well done very nicely. The flavors all work together to make it truly one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.

My friend and I also shared the Grilled Shishito Peppers, which are sweet and tasty, with a bit of char. And the sweet potato fries - long-cut, skinny, deliciously sweet and salty as the same time - not one soggy one in the bunch! I highly recommend these fries if you like sweet potatoes!

Also of note - they have a good happy hour, with food and drinks. I had a white wine for only 3 bucks, and it was a decent one at that.

What I didn't know was how big and unpreposessing the place was going to be, with its abundance of unadorned tables and lack of any decor save for some modernistic Asian-influenced ""art"" on the walls.  Kinda like ""Decor by Bed, Bath and Beyond"" on sale (and don't forget those 20% off coupons).  You can eat the ambience, and my appetite wasn't getting all that stimulated.

Luckily, the burgers were excellent (we both had Ronins, medium).  They had a Pear Cider special for $4, so we had a couple of those, and shared an order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries.  We liked the aioli that came along with that, but the dressing for the burger worked as a dipping sauce, too.  

When the burgers were delivered, I didn't see how I was going to bite into that gargantuan creation, but figured out quickly that if I press down and hold the chrome-dome top of the bun, I could compress it enough so that I didn't have to eat with with knife and fork.  That would have been way too difficult, since no forks were provided, just one serrated knife to share, presumably to cut the burger in half.  

While we enjoyed our burgers and fries and the service was excellent, Bachi is somehow missing that je ne sais quois that would compel us to return on a regular basis.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,5,3,c43n1_GMksAtWYSUrZHKVA

For appetizer,we had the fried calamari for $10. It came with this creamy tar tar sauce type and some lime sauce. It was ok. It wasn't crispy. It was more like they tried to fry it but not long enough because it was kind of soggy. 

For entrees, I chose to do the ""famous"" oxtail chili cheese fries for $11. First sight- presentation is beautiful. The fried egg was perfectly cooked to where you break it and the yolk just oozes. The taste-SALTY. The fries were crispy but that meat sauce was so salty and spicy because of the jalapeños. Was not impressed at all. 

My Bf got the Miyagi San burger with the Wagyu patty. First of all, you don't get a side with it so don't forget to order fries if you want a side. The burger patty itself was good but for $15 he wasn't even full.

The meal was delightful and fulfilling. The steamed edamame was a nice beginning; the portions were generous, hot, and lightly salted. The parmesean truffle fries were heavenly. The fries were served in a shiny funnel container and tasted hot, crispy, and cheesy. I enjoyed the tomato aioli sauce that was paired with it, too. However, I wish the fries were thicker. As you work your way to the bottom of the funnel, they begin to shrivel into little pieces that start to resemble crumbled potato chips. I ordered the no-meat burger and requested avocado. The presentation was simple and cute. The burger itself was tall and I had trouble biting into it. The flavor of the mushroom patty was a notch better than store bought veggie patties. What really elevated the burger was the toppings and airy bun. The sweet tofu, mixed greens and salty patty created a pleasing experience for my taste buds.

4559495,2017-07-16,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Sigh. So this definitely wasn't the best dinner experience I've had. Jacob and I decided to have dinner with friends from school. We are all hospitality majors and a few of us had heard of this place and wanted to check it out (specifically me). 

We arrived a few minutes after Jake, and Sam with his wife and son RJ. It was a little stuffy, but we assumed that was because of the multitude of people in the restaurant. It was extremely easy to find parking close to the restaurant. 

Our server quickly introduced herself, and was super friendly, but might have miscounted, as we didn't have the right number of menus for all of us. I had been dying to try the Bahn Mi burger for days, so that's what I ordered, only to find out that they were or of that specific ""patty"" so they weren't able to make the burger. She did state that it is a very popular burger, so I asked for recommendation... which were not what I was expecting. Like her recommending the burger they have with fish... she also stated they were out of red sangria, but managed to get me one last glass. So I will thank her for that. 

I decided to order the same burger as my boyfriend and Sam, which contains a multitude of mushrooms, arugula, gruyere cheese and caramelized onions. 

At this point. Let me summarize what happened. We ordered a plate of pickled items, and calamari. Sadly, Jacob and I weren't too impressed with the pickled items. But 1 year old RJ was, so they didn't go to waste. The calamari was a table favorite. 

We were never offered refills of water or any of our other beverages, and had to wave down the bus girl who Jacob and Sam said reeked of weed and apparently likes to reallllly focus on filling only one glass per table visit. We also had empty appetizer plates for almost 20 minutes after finishing. 

All of our food came at the same time. Except baby Rj's who's food came a few minutes after ours. I really wish they would have brought his food at first, because I hate when a kid gets his food after the adults. 

The caramelized onions in the burger were superb and they cook the burgers perfectly, but the sweet buns and onions overpowered EVERYTHING else in the burger, and the Parmesan porcini truffle fries only tastes of Parmesan, lacking in salt and truffle. 

I would have told our server all of this if she had checked up on us after taking our order, but we only saw her at the end of the meal when we asked for our check. The checks were also split incorrectly, but because of how hot it was inside and because we were all really thirsty, we decided to pay for it and leave. 

This was not what I was expecting from this establishment. The food itself was 3 stars, but the service brought it down to 2. Sorry Bachi Burgers.",a_5PHpKHFQYtVgEr4QTUMA,0,0,2,KTWrxcbaL3ZUXFY1SYsrzA

We came here and waited a ridiculously long time considering the restaurant wasn't even at  full capacity.   They were definitely short staffed and adding in the 115 degree heat outside, our party was not in the best of moods.

Anyhow, when we were seated, we ordered the oxtail fries, the kiki burger, the ronin burger, and a strawberry guava smoothie.

The quality of the food was exceptional just like the other location.  The bread of the burger is buttery and soft.  The meat is tender and juicy...the best I've had in my opinion, and the oxtail fries were delicious.  For the price ~$11, it was a fair deal.

Its definitely a must go if you've never had a gourmet burger.  It will for sure be one of the best hamburgers you've ever had.

The only reason I gave a 4 star was because the service was disappointingly slow and the waiters were a bit sweaty while they ran around.  I didn't want to see that right before I ate my food.

The burgers are delicious. The shoe string fries are delicious. The lychee green tea (i think?) is refreshing. But the oxtail chili cheese fries are where its AT! They give you a a very generous amount and it can easily feed 3-4 people or just a really hungry (and selfish) ME. (but I guess I'll share)

Funny, because after I ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, I saw them on an episode of Triple D. I got to watch how they make the cheese fries and was surprised that they add semi sweet (or was it dark) chocolate chips! So deliciously weird and you'd never know but I bet it makes one hell of a difference!

Asian take on an American classic is definitely not anything new, but doing it well is definitely the tricky part. Bachi Burger is definitely putting its mark on it and in a good way. The Miyagi-san burger uses a beautifully cooked wagyu patty with caramelized bacon, chili-mayo, onion rings, and a bit of furikake (dried seaweed) for salt. 

The oxtail fries was a good starting point with well cooked fries that were crisp on the exterior and steamy soft in the center. It was more chili style topping, but the the chili flavors were a tad overwhelming and didn't showcase the flavors of the oxtail, rather muted it.

Pork belly bao was well prepared with soft, but still firm pork topped with scallions, and a nice hoisin bbq sauce that gave the right balance of caramelized sugar and salt. The sliced boiled egg was decent and gave it nice color, but didn't really do anything to add for me.

Service was stellar and our server clearly knew the menu well and was ready to offer not only explanation, but reasoning behind suggestions. Food arrived in a good orchestration that kept our mouths busy and our tummy ready to digest. Ambiance is casual and nice, while its location seems to offer a plethora of parking and convenience to the neighborhood theatre next door.

4655122,2016-03-16,10,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"You live this life once; so why not treat yourself to a nice meal once in awhile. After hiking in Red Rock Canyon that is what my brother did. Except, that it wasn't intended for here. We headed to the Gordon Biersch in Boca Fashion Village only to find that it was gone. Bummer! In Sambalatte my brother and I went on Yelp where our fingers did the walking and the Yelpers did the talking. The Yelpers were talking positive things about Bachi Burger down Rampart Boulevard in the Village Square Shopping Center at the northwest corner of Sahara. Now it was time to do the eating. 

    I am no stranger to Bachi Burger. Oftentimes I drove by the Windmill at Bermuda location. I had read glowing articles about the famed burger in the local publications. Articles that included Las Vegas Weekly's reviewer Brock Radke placing Bachi Burger at number 19 in the most important restaurants of Las Vegas list. 

  I have been unfamiliar with the meaning of ""bachi."" For your information, ""bachi"" means karma and a Japanese type of grill. 

  Bachi Burger blends in with the neighboring businesses of the renovated Village Square Shopping Center. It is hidden from both Rampart and Sahara Avenue. The movie theatre is the landmark. 

  On Sunday, February 14, 2016; at 6:30, we had the restaurant practically to ourselves. Immediately upon walking inside, we immediately landed a table. There were zero patrons between ourselves and the distant open kitchen. The picture below shows the restaurant scene. But anything can change in a Las Vegas minute. Near 7 pm; the tables surrounding us were filling up. 

  Bachi Burger reminds me more of an Asian restaurant than a burger place. I remember the drapes by the hallway leading to the restrooms. I also remember the comfortable seats and relaxing dining environment. 

   After examining the choices of burgers in the menu, I had my mind set on the Spicy Miso Burger plus a separate order of Just Fries, and Coke. At this point of the review, I need to bring up that a burger, fries, and beverage will come out to at least $20. 

   The Spicy Miso Burger was a colossal sandwich. I felt like I was in the dentist opening my mouth wide. Below is a picture of this beast of a burger. And this is a first-rate burger. The Bachi Burger website states that their burgers are made fresh from a combination of wet aged chuck, short rib and brisket certified beef. It was over and above the meat that delivered my taste buds to an elevated state of nirvana. Surrounding the Angus beef were onions, shishito pepper, mayonnaise, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, apple vinaigrette, and a fried egg. This brought back a recent memory on the Las Vegas Strip enjoying a unique Fukuburger. A consequence of my food exploring is an appreciation of an egg on a burger. Let me also state that in contrast to the name, there was an infinitesimal amount of spiciness in the Spicy Miso Burger. Colossal sandwiches are not meant to be enjoyed alone. The Just Fries complimented the burger. The fries were hot and fresh. They featured sea salt. The fries were part for the course of this dining adventure. This is the first time that I recall dipping fries in pineapple ketchup. 

   Throughout the dining adventure, our waiter Hugo provided commendable service. Past the conclusion of the meal, he never pressured my brother and I to leave when we were hanging out shooting the breeze. Additionally he was friendly. 

   You will live this life once. Why not experience Bachi Burger once. Local publications and several Yelpers rave about Bachi Burger. This review is confirmation that Bachi Burger lives up to the hype:

I had a Sapporo draft. Bonus was a free glass if I checked in!  Sure!  Was told it was a fresh keg, but it could have been colder and the pour was a bit light, a finger short of the rim including head.

What prompted me to visit this location was based on the last three unsuccessful experiences I had at the other location -- hour-long waits and unhelpful individuals. I almost gave up on Bachi Burger, even though that would have hurt me more than it hurt them. One evening, my friend and I remembered their Summerlin location and fortunately, it was approximately the same distance from our homes, so we decided to give them chance.

Our experience was wonderful from start to finish. There was no other parties waiting and we were approached immediately. After checking in with us, we were told that it would be 5-10 minutes (though a little odd since, again, there was no one waiting and half the restaurant was empty tables). We were just happy that it wasn't 45-60 minutes! However, before we could even get comfortable with a Seven magazine, we were escorted to our table with a sincere apology (for the wait) from the hostess. We told her, ""Don't be ridiculous, we hardly waited!"" Our server was friendly and attentive; we were so delighted.

I went with my usual Spicy Miso Burger and Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries. All very, very delicious. For dessert, I opted for a boba milk tea drink. I couldn't decide between Almond and Taro Coconut, so our server recommended a blend of the two, exclaiming that it was her favorite drink! Of course, I had to and it was delicious.

Service was good but expect a wait...the system they are applying to seat ppl will is weird cuz there would be empty seating but it would not get filled when another table leaves. I guess it's to keep the order load to a certain level. The steam bun sliders are very good, but I prefer the pork ones. The oxtail fries I thought was okay....chili seems to over power the oxtail so it wouldn't have matter if oxtail was in there or not.

*Taro milk tea with boba - It was decent, but didn't have enough boba. 

*Vietnamese Coffee -  Delicious, but may be too sweet for some. 

*Truffle Parmesan fries - Yum! Not a fan of their sun dried tomato aioli dipping sauce, but perfect without it.

*Kiki's burger- Slightly sweet due to the sweet onion marmalade, ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly, delicious garlic chili aioli sauce served on the side.

*Bachi Fish- Not what I expected, but very good! Very messy, so ask for extra napkins. 

*Mandarin Orange Tangerine soda - So good! You must try this if you're a citrus fan.

 Pistachio- This is one of my favorite ice cream flavors, so it's no surprise I liked it.

My +1 ordered the wagyu burger with avocado, Swiss cheese, and a fried egg added to it. We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries between ourselves and that was by far my favorite dish.

The buns were soft and sweet, the meat well cooked, and the added vegetation was fresh and balanced out my burger. I was only disappointed by how long it took my fries to come out. I like to switch bites between burger and fries but by the time my fries came out, my boyfriend was already finished with his burger and  I was half-way done with my mine and already full.

The buns are buttery and a little sweet; I would buy their bread separately if I could. We also had the garlic fries which were okay. It tasted more like parsley than garlic, but my husband loved the garlic aioli sauce it came with. He had the pork bao buns which were cooked to perfect.

Short - creative Asian fusion burgers that taste great but leave your wallet a bit lighter than you would expect.

We started with pork belly steamed buns  (bao). They were very tasty, but the pork belly was a bit tough and didn't have a crisp sear on it. The addition of soft boiled egg slice was a nice touch and the flavors were good.

For our mains we ordered the Kiki burger with waygu and the Bahn-mi burger plus a side of sweet potato fries.

Both burgers were excellent but the Bahn-mi burger was the star. It's a beef, pork and shrimp patty that comes on a bun stuffed with Vietnamese herbs and a side of fish sauce for dipping, really unique and super tasty.

The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. It's nice to see they are cut fresh in house,  but they need to be a bit thinner or dusted in starch to get crispy. I wouldn't recommend them. 

We followed up with Portuguese donuts and Coconut panna cotta for dessert.

The donuts were good, although nothing special.

The coconut panna cotta desert special was not good, it just tasted bland. There was a blueberry coulis on the plate that was delicious, but it was such a small amount that it was gone after the first bite.

The prices here seem high relative to what they are serving. The $16 burger turns into $21 when you add fries for example. Watch what you order as the prices will add up fast.

Overall this is a fun and original upscale burger place that you should definitely try at least once, but the prices may be prohibitive for most locals to make this a regular spot.

If you wanna come for a premium burger that tastes even more awesome on an egg bun, do come and check out Bachi and try it out.  For me, it's been the Miyagi Wagyu burger for the win each time...but the last time we were there, one of the servers told us that the burger that all the staff has and swears by is the miso wagyu burger...he said to definitely try it the next time we come out there.

And as an added bonus, they joined up with the ramen joint a few months ago and now serve both on their menus.  I come here for the burgers, but you know me and my love relationship with ramen; so of course I tried it out too...just the tonkatsu though.  The broth wasn't as tasty as I had expected, but the chasu was prob one of the best I've had...nice and fatty and super tender.  If you can split it amongst your group, I'd definitely go for it.

The fries: sweet potato, truffle, oxtail, and regular, are all awesome, and DEFINITELY can feed more than one person, as we learned to our doom the first time we came in and each ordered fries.  The oxtail is quite heavy so you might wanna split the burger...but then again, this is vegas, INDULGE!!!!

This place can get absolutely packed, which is a sign of the good food, the popularity of the burger, and just the fact that Bachi rules!  So I would come at non-peak times, which is hard to determine for Vegas, Thursday night at around 10 the wait was 40 minutes, Saturday around 9:30 the wait was 5...so it really does follow along with the vegas theme of just gettin lucky.

I got recommended to try Bachi Burger out after a nice dinner at Raku from the table who was sitting next to me... boy oh boy was that a good decision. I can't even eat a burger without thinking of Bachi Burger. 

The thing that separates BB from other burger places (and there are a lot of them) is their bun. The sweet (asian-y?) bun melts in your mouth and soaks in the deliciousness of the meat and sauces. Not only does it taste great, it's addictive. 

We also tried their famous chilli fries - the one that Guy tried - and I found them pretty OK. They use thin cut fries, which I personally like better than the chunky fries, but then again that's just preference. 

My favorite burger was the Kiki since the sauce they put in it was killer, in a good way of course. I'd say skip the milkshake - not too good. Just try everything out, it's great!

Either my husband or I usually gets a severe Bachi craving at least once a month, and then only Bachi will do. Between us we've tried every burger on the menu, with the exception of the crazy-spendy Shogun, which I think will call for a special occasion, and we've settled into almost ritualistic favorites.

The Ritual:
- If I'm at Windmill, I will start with the Yuzu-Cherry soda, Summerlin, beer.
- Then salt and pepper fries with those glorious little jalapenos, so perfectly crispy and salty and share-able.
- Then I order the Kiki Burger, which is pretty much my favorite burger of all time. Juicy, sweet, and just the right level of sloppy. Mushroom heaven. 
- My husband orders the Spicy Miso burger, and eats it in approximately six seconds and moans softly to himself in joy.

The prices are a bit on the high side for a ""burger joint"", but Bach isn't really that, so don't go with that expectation. It's more of a unique local ""nice, but lower key"" bistro or something. It is one of the Go-to places both my husband and I drag our foodie friends and family when they fly in to visit, and it always gets rave reviews. 

I personally think I like the Summerlin location a bit better (except they need the cherry-yuzu soda. seriously.) I've feel as though I've just had my burgers a little bit better put together and more well cooked there. 

I've never had anything I didn't like there, other particular favorites were the Ronin and the turkey burger I can't remember the name of, but we just like that order so very much it's hard to deviate.

Once we were seated and our orders were taken(Kiko(or whatever the one with mushrooms was called) burger with the garlicky pepper fries(again, I forget the real name) for me, kids bachi for the little one, Caesar salad with burger patty for the wife, oxtail chili cheese fries for dad, and whatever mom got), the wait began. After a while(and several others who were seated after us getting their food as we sat hungrily) the server informs us that there was some mix up with the chef, and that he was bringing a free appetizer to apologize. I like the way they handled it, and we especially liked the chili fried chicken they gave us, so I'm not going to tear this place apart in this review. Once the food did come, it looked good and the portions were not bad. The food itself was OK. None of us were wowed(I was actually happy he missed that I'd ordered fries after tasting my mom's, which were the same I ordered), but it wasn't nasty. I guess it was slightly disappointing given the hype(DD&D) and wait(which we somewhat enjoyed in the old school candy and soda store a couple doors over. I do recommend going in here), as it isn't somewhere I will likely return to. The wife didn't particularly care for here either, and dad thought it was just OK. For all the L.A. peeps reading this, I consider it of the same genre(and price range) as Fukuburger(feel free to read my review of that joint), but I think Fukuburger taste a lot better.

Our server was great. She was friendly and very helpful. I ordered the Salty Caramel Marshmallow Fluff milkshake. It was very good-anything salty caramel is good in my book! For an appetizer we ordered the edamame seasoned with something that was on the spicy side-I forget exactly what it was. The flavoring they used was so good! I then ordered the Spicy Miso Burger. It was a good burger but I was a little disappointed because I didn't think it was spicy at all. I think next time I would try a different burger.

The oxtail chili cheese fries and truffle fries were super savory, although they were a bit salty. The sweet potato fries come with a citrus, horseradish sauce that I cannot reccomend.

The BF and I went to a place with the name burger in it, and didn't get burgers. Hah. 

We shared two items that I believe are new to the menu: 

Fish and Chips - these were pretty good. I don't know what kind of fish was used but it seemed denser of a fish than what is in usual and they batter it with a shiso leaf. The tartar sauce had nice zest to it. The chips are their usual fries which is a bit skinny and not the thick kind of British chips. 

Lobster roll - the lobster salad had some curry flavor to it and was really a great twist! They serve it on a bahn mi like baguette which was decent, but like some other reviewer said previously, they were hoping for the same soft buns used with the burger and I agree that would be aces. I'm just used to lobster rolls don't go in crunchy rolls but soft buttery ones. These come with ""root chips"" which remind me of those Terra chips. 

Salt and Pepper Fries for the table - these were nice. it had jalapenos in it and the seasoning I can't quite place that added more spice to the fries and the chili aioli was nice. I liked these and ended up polishing off the rest instead of my chips. 

Angela got a Lonely Bird which she reported was good, though the onion strings were a tad salty.  

Also a plus is the matcha iced tea! I love tea but sometimes I get tired of the standard ice tea offered at most places. Other than the green, there were a few other tea flavors that I don't think is refillable. I'm a beer person and it is definitely nice to see some respectable craft beer choices. 

Service was pretty decent and filled my drink a few times, but just fairly standard.

About a year ago while watching Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, they visited Bachi Burger.  Now i live in Canada, and i was close to debating a road trip, just to have some of those chili fries.  While planning a recent trip to Vegas, i remembered Bachi, and immediately put that on the itinerary.  They have two locations, we went to the newer one, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  I didn't have to look at the menu, i had it planned months ago what i was going to order, the oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and a fried egg a top.    It came to the table and it was everything that i wanted.  The fries, even with all of the toppings remained surprising crisp, and the gravy was more of a ragu, and it was rich and delicious.  The problem with restaurants being on TV is that they will showcase a few dishes.  Now coming from another country you want to try as many dishes as possible, especially the burgers.  At Bachi they have sliders, so it would be nice if they could make the fries in a smaller size, so that you can try a burger as well.  My sister ordered the kiki, which they made on DDD's, and she gave me one bite, and it was my biggest food regret from that trip of not ordering a burger because i was so full from the fries.

Ambiance: 4 - Organized, Clean. Not too many people during the nighttime. 

Service: 3 - Our server was funny and really kind, but they were too slow with everything after we were done eating, such as the check and getting boxes. Took way too much time than it should have!! 

Food: 3 - Some tips! 

(1) If you're not getting a grass-fed burger, you really should. You can taste the difference, and to me, the regular is just...yuck! I realized I should have payed $16 for the grass-fed beef. 
(2) The fries are good, and the quickest thing on the menu! I suggest the truffle fries and the regular fries with the pineapple ketchup..I'm gonna start doing that to my ketchup whenever I have fries at home! 
(3) My burger favorite is Miyagi san's Grass-Fed Wagyu burger. One word: Delish.

There's no doubt in my mind that it was the best meal I've eaten in 2013. It might be the best three-course meal I've eaten for under $20 in my life. Are you freaking kidding me?

The oxtail chili fries were subtle and smoky, well spiced, had a gorgeous texture. I could have eaten the whole plate. The trio of ice cream sandwiches was a most singular dessert: high quality chocolate, not-terribly-sweet ice cream, and shortbread cookies (paired to the ice creams) witha  decadent nuttiness to them. I was already ludicrously full from the burger, but the ice cream sandwiches kept me coming back, nibble by nibble, to wonder: ""Wait, what's THAT flavor? How do THESE textures work together?""

That sums up the whole meal, actually: the food was conceived with a level of attentiveness I associate with only the most elite of restaurants. The components of the dishes were all not just high quality, but arranged thoughtfully and playfully with the greatest possible attention to the balance of textures, smells, temperatures, spiciness/sweetness/umaminess/piquancy. The whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Kiki's Burger (angus beef -- caramelized on the outside, perfect juicy medium inside; onion marmalade; dressed greens; three kinds of mushrooms; caramelized bacon; aged gruyere; probably other awesome stuff that I'm forgetting) was the only burger I've ever eaten with motherfucking STAR POWER and that's all I'm going to say about it.

This chain is going to be bigger than Umami Burger. You're not going to be able to get a table at the LA location. In ten years there'll be frozen Bachi Burgers in the aisle of your latest supermarket. This chain is going to blow the heck UP. And I for one am going to eat here as often as I can (strawberry guava cheesecake next time? please!) before everyone finds out about it.",IiRu6K5yJ37gX5IOq2xGYA,0,0,5,i_1lr5DBtELlA8Kh5Frz2Q

5094835,2015-12-21,20,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Gordon Ramsayesque review - Looks like someone took a crap on my plate.  It taste like it too.

Putting it gently, three years later, gone are the crowds and for good reason, the food has become shockingly bad.

To start, the once good oxtail chili cheese fries has become a disgusting mess.  Stringy, over braised, oxtail meat stewed in excessive quantities of cheap (taste like dirt) chili powder then slopped atop soggy fries.  An overcooked, rubbery egg with almost no yolk, processed cheese, wilted cilantro, and shriveled, rubbery Jalapeño peppers round out the dish.   No.

To the patties used for the burgers, yes, adding a little sauce in the raw mix adds flavor.  Adding too much makes the meat wet with an odd texture and causes the burger to break apart when eating.  The toppings lack freshness and now passé sauces are so heavily slathered on, the flavors are completely overpowering and off balance.  

Epic fail for the Kalbi burger (patty fell apart, kalbi marinade and ko chu jang mayo dripping everywhere).  The Spicy Miso burger not far behind, it too oozing some sweet miso concoction, mushy meat falling out with almost no toppings except a hardened piece of cheese in the center of a apple vinaigrette soaked bun.  No and no.

Service is off the Strip friendly and fast but with only three other tables at peak lunch hour, it better be.

Maybe just trying too hard to up the ante in Asian fusion flavors.  Not recommended.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,23,19,2,CGsXyZWDcM5QwvcXpni8KQ

5110043,2013-02-13,6,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I'm so glad I don't have to make that drive down to windmill for a delicious Bachi Burger, meat so tender that it melts right in your mouth.  

This spot here on Sahara and Ft Apache is a bit bigger with a less waiting period. Actually, I don't ever recall having to wait at all at this location.

Tonight I met up and made great new friends from the yelp community. Terri, Chad and Mel. Terri looks like she's pimpin' Asian males around her haha. But on to the good stuff. Tonight's choice of burger was the spicy miso burger but this time with a change to the beef. Instead of the angus beef it usually comes with, I took our server's recommendation to try it with the wagyu beef and wow was she right. This beef is so much more tender and juicy, especially when done medium rare. It literally did melt in my mouth, had me drooling like Homer Simpson. It also came with all the goodies I like from the spicy miso burger (Onions, Shishito Pepper Mayo, Lettuce , Roasted Garlic, Cheese, Fried Egg, Apple Vinaigrette). All the burgers I order from here are ones with fried eggs in them. I just love the taste of yolk melting over the beef.
 
It's a must that you also try their oxtail or garlic fries. Simply irresistible taste. Unfortunately I didn't get any tonight because I was still planning on going for a run and didn't want to get too full.

5127029,2013-04-01,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Bachi Burger is pretty damn good. It is hyped up beyond belief, and some of that hype is definitely warranted. I'll get out the few negative things right off the bat. This place doesn't do reservations. There is always a wait because they don't seat you regardless of the vast amount of empty tables in the restaurant. My hunch is that because they take a while to prepare your food, they don't want to seat everyone at once so that it seems like you're waiting forever for your food. So this way you wait forever in the little waiting area up front before waiting a good while for the food once you order. The food is cooked pretty inconsistently. It's a crap shoot whether or not your burger gets under or overcooked. Also, the food is a little on the pricey side, $14 is one of the cheaper options on the menu for what amounts to a cheeseburger with no sides. I really don't mind it, but I can definitely see some people taking issue with that. 

Now onto the good stuff. The burgers are really damn good here. The buns they put these on are ridiculously good too! I would love to eat everything on those sweet, soft, buns if it were possible. You can tell the ingredients are all quality and you do get a good sized burger. You can easily leave here stuffed. They have tons of unique signature burgers, along with many ways to customize them. They even have options for non beef lovers. I have opted for the Miyagi Son each time. It's a Wagyu burger that has fried egg, crispy onion rings, and a chili mayo and caramelized bacon that I usually opt out of. But if you like those, then definitely leave em on. I also tried a friend's sandwich. It was basically like their BBQ ribs thinly sliced on a bun. But the meat was delicious. We tried their Chili Fried Chicken appetizer, it was also really good. It's basically chili boneless wings. Nothing too spicy, but they had a good flavor nonetheless. Also, the truffle parmesan fries are pretty on point. But do you want to know my favorite thing about Bachi Burger, like the thing that fills my dreams most nights and always put a smile on my face when I think about it???  Well I'll tell you anyway... It's that insaaaane Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. That was the most amazing milkshake I have had in my entire milk shake drinking life. Whatever black magic is used to make that thing so incredible, it is well worth the ridiculous amount of calories it most definitely has. Try it and then thank me later. And nothing says thank you quite like a Salted Caramel Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake. ;P",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,2,1,4,y_r9zj9zyO0DyZgrPcT_8A

Only differences I noticed were that this location has much more space and was less crowded when I showed up.  Service was quick, food was cooked perfectly, and everything was great!

Banh-Mi Burger ($9.50): Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass, Pork Pate, Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli, Pickled Vegetables and Nuoc Mam Sauce. This was a great burger! Lots of diversity, consistency, and taste...each bite was perfect.  Highly recommended :)

Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.50): Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream and Sun Dried Tomato Aioli. I've had these a long time ago and wasn't too impressed...gave them another go, and felt the same way. Not too much truffle taste here! Go with the Oxtail fries or the Salt & Pepper Garlic fries if you are solo!

The Ronin is just the very best burger I can ever remember eating. Potentially there was a more insanely amazing burger somewhere in my infancy and I can't recall it. But that really seems unlikely, especially because we were eating dinner with my parents and I think they would have reminded me. But I digest..;)
Our hostess, our waiter and the manager helping to check on tables were all absolutely friendly and gracious. The hostess even set up a high chair at our table for my son before escorting us over to it, ix-naying the unnecessary chair and making sure the sharp knives were well out of reach. When we first got to Bachi Burger it was a young professionals at happy hour type of crowd and I was worried were wrecking the vibe (as my baby was nomming puffs of cereal and gumming teething toys like a villain). But later in the evening two other families with young children came in and I got the impression that Bachi Burger does a good job catering to a wide variety of crowds. It was already pretty busy at 7pm on a Monday so I would definitely recommend making a reservation.
On a future visit (who wants to come back with me tomorrow? And the next day?:)) I would order the salt and pepper fries to accompany the Ronin. The salt and pepper fries had just enough going on with their seasoning, the crunchy slivers of jalapeño and hot chili dipping sauce to complement but not compete with the burger main event. The Parmesan truffle fries I got were just a little too heavy to go with such an already complex burger, but they were definitely deserving of another visit in their own right. I also really enjoyed the Kiki burger and the iced matcha green tea (oddly much better-tasting with the meal than on it's own).

We shared sweet potato fries and my brother also got the mocha shake which he said was delicious. 

Service: 3/5 - It wasn't bad just slow. There was one waitress (it was memorial day late lunch time) with a support guy, who I think was new, and served as drink/food runner. There was a manager-like guy and another woman-maybe owner (?) but, they were not really helping out when clearly the waitress was busy (maybe 7+ tables). I asked for lemons for my water and had to wait and ask several times. Finally, about 20 mins in, our waitress brought lime slices saying they didn't have lemon which I really found odd.

Generally eschewing ground meats it was for myself something beyond Angus, Kobe and Wagyu that brought me to the Summerlin location of local darling Bachi Burger on Sunday, though I will say from the start that the ""Kiki's Burger"" ordered by my mother was potentially the best dish in an afternoon where only a single dish failed to impress despite the best efforts of our server to misinterpret the phrase ""please course things out and do not bring everything at once.""  A surprisingly large space featuring slick woods and polished surfaces throughout it was just after 3:00pm when we arrived for late lunch/early dinner and selecting widely from the menu inclusive of a $15 foie gras appetizer it was with the hunger derived from nearly 8 hours of unpacking that we waited, only to have every single plate arrive simultaneously thirty minutes later resulting in both an overloaded table and tough choices about what would taste best at room temperature or below.  Focusing on the food it should be noted that much of what was ordered actually came to the table exceptionally well prepared and beginning with the foie gras I was immediately impressed by the quality and presentation, a single vein the only flaw in an otherwise Robuchon-quality prep featuring a caramelized medallion alongside a semi-sweet salad plus creamy, rich croquette and moving next to crispy, complex chicken alongside the equally crisp but decidedly spicy fries it was with good fortune that the milk shake, albeit small, was present to quell the heat.  Overlooking the spongy, dense bao and tepid duck entirely lacking for crisp skin and instead assisting my mother with the lightly charred burger topped with woodsy mushrooms and aromatic marmalade it was perhaps with recollections of the zeppole at Settebello the day prior that I ordered the doughnuts and although not quite as impressive, the eggy brioche stood strong beneath a dense lacquer of sugar rounding out a fairly impressive afternoon largely warranting the $75 tab, if not a significant tip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,3,fySAo-kgkCI6c9s5P-_Jdw

They tried sticking us into a corner, which my mother said ""No way!"" We ordered our waters and drinks. We had to tell Gabby (our server - hoping that's her name) 3 times about the water. It didn't arrive for a good 8-10 minutes. She apologizes, saying that there were a lot of people and she was trying to keep up with everyone. ....Really? 3 tables was that overwhelming? She kept acting like she was extremely overwhelmed and flustered. We finally order our food. My mom got the Banh-Mi burger and I got Spicy Miso, as well as the truffle parmasean fries. That was another 20 minutes on top of the already 8-10 minutes of sitting there without anything. Not even the fries came out early. Two tables came after us and received their food faster than us. It was ridiculous. It wasn't even that busy in there! We finally got out at 7:20 p.m. Honestly, this was the worst service I've ever experience here. I will not be back any time soon, and she's lucky she even got a tip. The worst part was she was fully aware we were unhappy with the service and never asked ""What can I do to make this right?""

The place is nice and clean and had a bunch of TV's playing the local sports teams. The service was pretty good and the food quality was definitely top notch! 

We ordered chili cheese fries but it came with a sunny side up egg on top of it. Anything with a sunny side up egg is instantly that much better, this definitely helped! I don't remember which burger I ordered but I had it medium rare and it came out pretty near perfect. 

Overall the quality was great and the service was tremendous. Really have no complaints about this place. The price was more than reasonable.

1) Taro Coconut Milk Tea with Boba 5/5- very unique and delicious! You get a good balance of the Taro and Coconut. It's not too sweet and just right!

2) Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries 2.5/5- It was heavy, I was expecting more savory and salty but this dish is on the sweeter side (probably because of the Asian fusion). With it being sweet and heavy, it made it very difficult for me to enjoy this dish. Half way finishing this plate, the rest of the fries were soaked in this sauce and I could not bare to eat anymore of it.

3) Pork Belly Steamed buns 4/5- It was my favorite thing here! The pork belly was juicy and flavorful, the sauce it came with is just right for it.

4) The Bachi Burger 4/5- Pretty delicious especially if you like kim chi. I was scared that there might be too much going on but I was wrong. Everything complemented each other well. I kind of wish my burger was a little more juicier. I ordered a medium but felt like it was on the borderline of a medium well.

Overall, this place is okay. Almost all items have some sweetness to it and it's probably because of the Asian infused flavors. I think some of plates were too complicated and involved too many ingredients/toppings. Sometimes simplicity is good.",rFQcuWACx2X2id-paUA7EA,1,0,3,B2VfGJYlQkIx-RLKEpb79A

Let's just say the service had to be coaxed the entire meal. And my glass was empty for a good 10 minutes. In short service sucks.

Food was ok. For starters we had the Kurobuta & Arabiki sausage with grain mustard, which was good, but nothing to brag about, it reminded me of a skinny kielbasa flavored beef smokies garnished with shreds of scallion, which does nothing to enhance the flavor . Also had the Truffle Parmesan fries with sundried tomato aioli. The fries needed salt, and the drizzling of porcini cream was unecesary, it only made the fries get soggy faster in places. They should've stopped with truffle oil and salt. The aioli was forgettable. 

Now comes the burger, Miyagi-San burger was pretty good, although for me, flavor wise, it was incomplete. Sure, it has all the umami-ness needed to tickle the palate, Wagy beef, fried onion rings, fried egg over medium. Unfortunately it needed acid to cut the richness of the burger. So my tip is to order the Bachi pickles while you order your burger, so they come the same time. The pickles is by far the most epic plate of the evening. It was seasoned perfectly, the veggies have a nice crunch to them specially the pickled garlic.

I had a bite of my husbands burger which was had an Angus beef burger and we both agree it didn't seem any different from my more expensive beef. Disappointing. My husband got the Spicy Miso burger also cooked to their recommendation, his burger and egg were cooked better than mine. It was an interesting burger, good taste. My husband wished it was spicier, he thinks the egg made it bland. We shared some Truffle Parmesan fries, they were okay. Again nothing special. The fries were nice and crispy and not greasy, but not a lot of taste. I liked the Porcini cream on top but there wasn't enough, I didn't care for the Sun dried Tomato AiolI dip.

I got the Meatless burger, with truffle fries and my boyfriend got the Turkey burger and sweet potato fries. We also got a bowl of garlic edamame with truffle oil to start- which wasn't very garlicy, or truffley, so it wasn't worth the extra dollar in my mind.

The Meatless burger was not the best I've ever had- but it sure as hell was the most invent! You get two types of veggie burgers: patties made of a mixture of veggies, or a 'patty' of a vegetable (mushroom, eggplant).This burger had a base patty of rice and beans and other veggies, but also had a thin slice of tofu and eggplant, both breaded and seasoned, which gave it a very different dynamic. The flavor was good, but mostly just sweet and sour tangs- I didn't taste much in the veggies or the tofu.

My boyfriend liked his Turkey burger, but wasn't impressed with his sweet potato fries. My truffle fries on the other hand were really good, and the sun dried tomato sauce they come with is ADDICTING!

The menu also seem to be more extensive with seasonal specials as well.  I've waited over an hour on the weekends at the Windmill site....which puts a downer on the eating experience.  Most of the burgers are $10-13 and I think a lot tastier than some pricier burgers you can get on the strip.  My all time favorite is the Miyagi-san burger with the wagyu beef, fried egg, onion rings, and furikake.  The flavor balance is perfect and the soft fluffy char siu bun completes the package.  I branched out this last visit and tried Mr. Ho's burger and I was pleasantly surprised by the taro bun which I like even more than the original bun they have.  However, I wasn't a big fan of the pork/beef combo and wish they had more lap cheong (Chinese sausage).

Then fell more in love with the pork belly and it was game over with the shogun burger. Dammnnnnn... So good. All of it... I had been wanting to eat here for a few years now but never could align the stars whenever I was in town. My friends that had tried it, raved about it and I've been kicking myself ever since. I finally went here a few weeks ago and am so glad I did. I saw the light. All the flavors I tasted were delicious.

We first had the oxtail chili cheese fries that was topped with an egg and drizzled with garlic aioli. It was delicious. I love oxtail. I love chili cheese fries and this was a perfect marriage of both things. The fries were perfectly fried and the tender oxtail covered in cheese, cilantro & jalapeno slices were great together. The latter two i'm not big on but I ate around them and would probably eat them if it was the only way to sample this great appetizer. I definitely recommend it. It was great. I really enjoyed it.

The other thing I had before my burger was the pork belly steamed bun. It was very VERY good. 4 come in one order. Perfectly cooked and tender pork belly (a little crisp on the outside) in a small steamed bun sammich with some slices of hard boiled egg, radish, cilantro (again!), scallions and hoisin sauce. It was perfect. It was so good that I ate the cilantro and i was good. And i HATE cilantro.. I always tell my friends I don't eat weeds. Hahah... But seriously, I dont like the after taste but soldiered through it cause I figured that the chef meant it to be eaten that way and the least I can do is follow suit. That and it looked so good & I was hungry and couldnt wait so I just dug in. Order it... trust me.

On to the burger... I ordered the shogun burger because I was on a mission to have foie gras as I miss having it at Los Angeles restaurants such as Animal & Mozza. The shogun burger has a patty that's wagyu beef. It's topped with unagi, yes unagi... pan seared foie gras (YUM), asian pears & peaches and a delicious butter on the bread. It  was all good. All the unique ingredients worked well and it was quite tasty. The wagyu patty was nice & tender. The unagi was soft & tasty. The foie gras was heavenly and I wish there was more. MORE. The asian pear & peach slices helped break up the richness of all the other ingredients. It was really a nice compliment to the burger. I really liked the burger big time. Glad it had foie gras. So glad I ordered it.

I had some of the sausage platter. There were 2 types of sausages (kurobuta & arabiki) on this plate. They were tasty. Good flavor. Nice smokey & sweet taste to them. The dipping sauce was honey mustard. But it didnt even really need one. The sausages were that flavorful. 

The drink I ordered was the plantation style sweet tea. It was good. A different kind of sweet tea. Hard to describe. Also tasty... 

Service was very good. We had a nice Filipino girl help our party of 7 that quickly became 9. She was friendly, was a good sport and got all our orders right. She also split the bill 3 ways which was nice. Thank you Bachi... Looking forward to eating there again soon. In fact, I'm flying out to Vegas in 36 hours.

It was my date's first time ever at Bachi and mine at this new location in Village Square.  We walked right in on Thursday night and were seated immediately.  Service was very attentive; our waitress checked on us often and certainly knew her beer, recommending a good one for me, who seldom drinks the stuff.  We started with steamed edamame, moving on to the Black and Green burger for myself and the Ronin burger for him with regular fries that we shared. The food came out quickly and we enjoyed every juicy bite. Bachi joins Firefly at Village Square in being two great food choices for those of us on the Westside.

Quality of food: DELICIOUS! I usually get the Kiki Burger (I haven't tried any others), and it never disappoints. There's loads of flavor and the meat is just so tender and juicy!

I still prefer the Truffle Fries over it. My man and our daughter get the sweet potato fries - And they love it! I've tried it and I actually really like it as well. 

Service: Variable, and this is the reason why I docked a star from them. Because the food is made to order, it takes awhile. But HEY! Not complaining because when you taste that burger.. Oh goodness, you'll be in Heaven! Servers are actually really friendly here, and they're accommodating. They check up on you every so often.

Chili fried chicken - a bit disappointing, as the chicken was a bit soggy and not crispy. Good flavor, though.

Ronin burger - this was the burger I ordered for myself, and I liked it a lot. The smooth and silky caramelized onions was a nice contrast to the bright and crisp cole slaw and miso goma dressing. The runny fried egg just put it over the top. 

I personally still prefer the richness and extra ""beefy"" and robust flavor from Miyagi san's Wagyu burger. Plus, I just love those damn onions rings.

Spicy miso burger - overall, great flavors from roasted garlic and the shishito pepper mayo, but the burger was not spicy at all. I say if you're going to put the word ""spicy"" in the burger, at least put some kick into it!

OK, why only 3 stars this time? Well, it would be 3.5 because the burger was pretty good, although the flavor of the bacon seemed lost inside. But what really bothers me is paying $6 for a milkshake, and getting it served in a small 10 oz or maybe 12 oz glass, with a lot of whipped cream on top. Really? Take notes restaurant owners and managers. A good milkshake that you are making me pay a small fortune for should always be served in a 16 oz glass, with the remaining shake served in the silver cup it was made in. This is not an option. Milkshake lovers like myself will thank you, and if you don't serve it this way, I will never visit your establishment again no matter how good the food is.

5788766,2017-03-20,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Bachi used to be a favorite for me. However I was there Friday night and the experience was sub-par to say the least. First, the server was very slow and inattentive. We got our drinks (sodas and iced tea), but we had to ask for waters 3 times. The host finally came over and brought them. The server seemed annoyed, but that's OK. In fairness, the appetizers were GREAT! Calamari and Ox Tail Chili Fries - awesome. There were 5 of us at the table and we all loved them - even got another order of calamari. Dinner comes - my girlfriend gets hers, then almost 10 minutes go by before the rest of get our food - our server, the hostess and another server brought the orders (along with apologizing for the delay) finally. Back it up a bit, 2 items we ordered were 86'd (out of the item), OK - ordered something else, no big deal. So, I ordered my burger VERY well - done, do't judge, that's how I like them. My friend ordered his well done. When the server brought our burgers  asked which was which, she said (and I quote), ""Uhhh, the more well-done one should be the smaller one."" Um, OK. So it wasn't. It was medium at best, my friend who ordered well, ad the more well-done burger. And they were cold. I didn't send mine back, because I didn't want to wait. They were also obviously thinner than they used to be. The only thing the server did quickly was bring our checks. So quick in fact, one of was still eating! I'm not talking about 1 bite left, I mean half of his meal. She dropped off the checks and was back in less than 90 seconds for the payments. I know because I timed it out of curiosity. Unfortunately for her, her tip was commensurate with her level of service. Couldn't blame her for the under-cooked burger or the 86'd items, but I can blame her for the lousy service and bum's rush at the end. I will add that Bachi Burger is normally very busy and you need to wait for a table, this time it was barely 1/4 full. I see why now. Very sad to see this place in this condition. A final note - the bathroom - the urinal was out of order and judging by the dust on the Hefty bag covering it, it had been for some time. And the curtain separating the dining room from the bathroom hall was very obviously filthy.",y_BXTp8fu6wkud-eY3We8A,2,0,1,HeA1kudfsE_gbMXEM81dQA

I thought it was great back then, it was even better the second time (much more oxtail meat this time around).

Crusty Crab - Yes, please, more.

I've had one burger here the last time - truffle burger?  I don't remember.  Either we added an egg or it came with it - either way, it was amazing.

I came here with my cousin, who is very much a fast food type of burger guy and he was seriously blown away.  Before I could even finish Instagramming my crab cake burger, he was 3/4 the way done with his burger.  Seriously - I can't imagine you could possibly go wrong with any burger on the menu.  It is seriously divine.

Service - top notch.  I came here on Thanksgiving weekend and it appeared to be really busy or just understaffed.  The food was seriously worth the wait and the staff was very very friendly and helpful.  They were not as attentive as I would have liked (which was completely understandable given their circumstance as previously mentioned), but if you are observant, you can see that they were absolutely trying their best and hardest to accommodate the demand.  Five stars for the pulling through and their efforts.  They kept their cool and didn't let it get to them.

The service was really good. The server was attentive and very knowledgeable. We ordered a Mr. Myagi Burger and some garlic pepper fries to be split between my wide and myself as I was not sure if we'd truly like the place. When the food came out the presentation of it was definitely top notch. You could tell that they use high quality beef just by looking at it. When I cut into the burger immediately the juices started flowing out letting me know that this was going to be a very tasteful burger. The beef on this burger was to die for it is definitely some of the highest quality beef that I have seen used on burgers. My wife is not a big beef eater and even she loved it which says allot. The fries were ok they definitely lacked a taste of garlic.

The reason for my 4 stars is because the meat was that good. I'm not a fan but I can't down high quality. However the price to me seemed a bit high, but I guess you do pay for what you get, but if that is truly the case then I truly didn't get my monies worth on the fries but the burger was stupendous.

I asked for the Manager and a guy with dirty finger nails and t-shirt said he was the supervisor.

The kalbi burger was  good - juicy and the patty was cooked to how I requested. Although there was kimchi in the burger, I felt there could have been more of a kick in flavor to it. 

I wasn't a fan of the oxtail chili cheese fries with fried egg. It was good but too much going on flavor wise. 

If I were to come back again, I would come back for the ramen. I strongly recommend ordering the ramen. The shoku ramen was on point - broth was spicy and had amazing flavor, meat was tender and the boiled egg was perfectly boiled!

Another stop on my DDD tour and those of you, or that one of you, that reads my reviews know that I do not just dole out the four stars reviews. 
We were greeted nicely and ordered some adult beverages and some sausages.  Three stars could go for the sausages alone they were fabulous. Seriously, my partner loves when I give her ""sausage"" and she seemed equally pleased about the Kurobuta  and Arabiki sausages we received.  I must admit, I was a little jealous. (Just a little jealous, the sausages aren't that big.  Wink Wink)
Only two main hiccups.  When we asked what was the difference between the red sangria and the white sangria, we were told that one was red and one was white!? Really!?  Uhmmm....Ok.  Seeing our bewilderment the waitress went into small detail about the differences, but I am still not convinced that she actually knew.  I am sure that she will do better next time. It was good, but I still want to know what the big difference is, especially if they are both made with sake.  I'm quite sure that there is no red sake. 
The second hiccup was that  my dining partner loathes, simply loathes mushrooms.  She thinks that they taste like dirt.  And according to her palette she order the black and green burger without mushrooms.  And of course it came covered with mushrooms. I don't really get upset about the addition of the mushrooms, mistakes happen, but it throws off the entire pace of the meal when something like that happens.  Luckily the item was taken quickly back to the kitchen and the annoying fungi were removed.
A manager came out and did his best to make up the mistake.  The conversation was a little awkward between him and my dining partner but in the end we felt that he was making a solid attempt make up for the earlier error and that's what counts.
Oh let me talk about my burger.  I had the ""Shogun.""  It was as epic as it sounds.  Wagyu beef, unagi and foie gras.  Foie gras!  You had me at Foie!
It was delicious, the only thing is that it comes with a sweet sort of chutney that works, but I am not a big fan of sweet with my savory.  When I come back again I will see if I can order it with the non-carne items of the side.
We also had the ox-tail fries.  I have red other reviews and would agree that for an entree that they  might need more meat, but as a side they were spectacular and a wonderful addition to our burgers.

On my first trip, the Spicy Miso burger was mind blowing!. Being a hybrid Yoshi I though that putting Aka Miso on a burger was ingenious! It had me hooked at first bite. The burger had a nice zing to it however at the same time you could taste the quality of the meat. It was so good that I came back a few days later for one. Unfortunately the encore came up a little short. It lacked the same zest and boom that made me fall in love with the first one. The first one was popping with the spicy miso flavor however the second was lacking all of the above and was just a burger...

On my third visit I got the Kalbi burger, I was hoping that it would be something crazy like ground kalbi but it once again was on the mild side and just kalbi sauce. Very timid, but decent nonetheless. 

I would go out to say that the only thing that was consistent was the fries. The garlic fries were nom each time. I really didn't care for the truffle fries as they were a bit messy and more confusion vs fusion (but that's just my opinion). 

I will address the reviews with issues about service. Each time we dined here, service was fine. I never had to ask for water refills and was consistently checked up on so I will put my neck out and disagree with the service issues.

We ordered a kids menu grilled cheese and fries, oxtail fries, fried calamari, bahn mi burger, kalbi burger and bachi fish burger. Since it was our first time, we all shared our food since we wanted to try a little bit of everything.

 I actually loved everything except the oxtail fries. They were good, but I wasn't impressed. 

The fried calamari was good. However, you get such a small plate for $12. Definitely not the best calamari I have had in town, so for the price I would pass on this.

The bahn mi burger was Amazing. I could really taste all the flavors expected out of a bahn mi and the burger itself was juicy and cooked perfectly. Nuoc cham for a dipping sauce too? Oh yeah, you can't go wrong.

The kalbi burger was Delicious as well, just a little bit salty. I was a huge fan of the cucumber kimchi served on the side. I wanted more of that. I couldn't get enough.

The fish burger did not let us down either. It was very moist and delectable. 

The winner for me was my son loving his kid friendly meal. It is important that a kid meal is actually kid friendly and I wasn't too sure at first but his grilled cheese was perfect. Cheese melted in between a hamburger bun with a side of fries. My only complaint - too expensive.

5918675,2012-05-10,8,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I have been suggesting that Bachi Burger open a second location in the SW since my first visit to the original location.  So when I found reviews on the new, and much closer, second location on W. Sahara, I was happy just like a lot of other Yelpers living in the vicinity.  So when fellow foodies suggested we meetup and give this Bachi Burger a try, it was a no brainer for me.

Perhaps in keeping with the theme of being bigger and better, the Summerlin location sports a larger dining room, as well as, a more extensive menu. The menu now spans four pages, instead of the original two sided menu, and looks great in their silver color menu cover.  Milkshakes, sake sangria, fried calamari, and Grilled Loche Duarte Salmon Burger are just some of the new items that are new additions to the Bachi lineup.

The hostess and our waitress were impressively knowledgeable about the menu, and did not hesitate to demonstrate their Jason Bourne-like photographic memory recall talent.  On a side note, how come ""Insert country"" Got Talent never showcase individuals that can recall the value of Pi?  Maybe that was part of the reason she knew who ordered what and checked on our table regularly.

Okay, moving on to the good stuff. This is a burger joint, with a lot of beefy burgers and other alternatives.  I however have always thought that their seafood burger lineup were better than their Angus or Wagyu fusion burgers.  Therefore, I opted to try their Grilled Loch Duarte Salmon burger, which I was told was only available at the Summerlin location.  I was not disappointed with my decision to order this burger. It was made with grilled smoked salmon from Scotland, with crunchy bacon, plus tomato, red onions and arugula to keep it healthy, and lemon herb mayo and ponzu vinaigrette for flavor, moistness (sounds inappropriate) and that ""if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face"" and ability to moisturize your sticky fingers leaving them smelling like fish for the remainder of your delicious meal.  Sticky and odorous fingers aside, it is highly recommended by yours truly.

My dining companions ordered the Mr. Ho's Burger (comes stock with meaty Chinese Sausages just for the ladies), Spicy Miso Burger (personallyI think it sounds moreinteresting calling it Mi So Spicy! Burger) and the Ronin Burger, and all seem satisfied with their menu selection.  So the consensus is that the food we ordered were yummy.  But I am in the camp that felt for a $10-$20+ burger price tag, you should be able to walk out satisfied, not wonder over to Archi's or Jollibee or drive over to Anime Ramen for dinner part 2.

Parking:  4/5  Better odds of landing a decent parking space here than hooking up with one of the Anime Ramen girls (already factored in enticing them with Panda Pocky).

5935901,2014-04-02,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Always amazing...as all Bachi Burgers are! We ordered:

Shishito peppers: It came with a sweet sauce and it was smokey in flavor with a bit of FIYAH! as you get closer towards the stem (those sneaky seeds...) absolutely amazing...especially in between bites of burger!

Kurobuta sausages: Tasted very similar to hot dogs, yet at the same time, not quite. Very salty and sodium-filled, if you like extra savory apps. The mustard that came with it def cut down on the overwhelming saltiness and made it much more delightful though.

Kiki burger: I love shrooms (no not those kind!) and this really made my day. Delicious, juicy patty, oozing with deliciousness, topped with equally appetizing medley of mushrooms (all types!). I killed my burger within minutes! Yummiest burger ever!!

I had a great experience here, just as I did at the other location, and I can't wait to be back! Definitely a MUST-GO when you are in Vegas :)",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,4,3,4,6Nc4pCmIeBrskgO7qggSQA

I thought u must be a genius to make this combo work.  It tasted like a bag of take-out that all got tossed together when their containers opened accidently in the bag.  Yes, I knew the job was dangerous when I took it, but it should be taste tested prior being placed on the menu.",gVSsQgXH1qKqqhrDQQ7tLQ,2,0,3,e1IE8cONMEDptaRNzFwTFg

Got the spicy miso burger and subbed the wagyu beef - it was delicious! Staff is friendly and helpful. I also like that they use real ramekins for all the sauces and they have a lot so that they don't waste all that plastic:),wqAGSxMie6Q0OD4Qll9Nug,0,1,5,ajPsJJ_nwVKswpUeLGSPPA

the oxtail fries were a little disappointing...
but the burger was tasty, the bun nice and fluffy but crunchy on the ends w/a nice toast on it.  the ronin burger was a little too sweet, but the miso burger hit the spot.
not worth the drive AT ALL.  stay on the strip and get a burger just as good w/o a $50 cab ride.",7gPss5opTw1jl-3VceDBbA,0,0,3,zZHYJw9TaRJyKIG9X-g-XQ
5963262,2017-01-28,2,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"Its been a while since the last time I was here and I have already forgotten how expensive it was. My bill came $98 plus tip for 4 people with no drinks,  and the food was just ok. 

Around 2pm today (Friday) I walked in looking around to see if my party have already seated, I did not find them so I went to use the bathroom, I came out from the bathroom, went back to the front and ask one of the server if I could get a table for 4. The place is very small and had about 3 tables being occupied.  I'd say 4 young male and female employees, most of them are  gathering in the back and no one had greeted me until I asked. 

Our waiter can use some advice on how to become a better waiter. You don't say "" oh ya, he has one, he can hand it to you"" when someone ask for a menu. You just don't!

and... I was the only girl in my group, my order was taken last and handed me the bill at the end... what a treat!

You'll want to drink it all in one gulp, but pump those breaks, because there are no refills. Lame sauce. I can't complain about their burgers, they are presented well and are very tasty. They are stacked high so biting into them will be a bit of challenge but when you're starving the challenge is easily accepted. Like I said depending on your server, you'll either get great service or you'll get mediocre. Nothing bad enough to not make me want to return.

5971029,2014-12-08,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"I went to Bachi Burger on  Friday evening. It wasn't very busy and we were seated immediately. Service was pretty good, no complaints there. The food tasted good, but the prices are a bit steep. I order a burger that was $12. It was very good, but it was also (almost) the cheapest. There were $18 burgers all over the menu. That's a bit steep for me and it didn't even include a side of fries or anything. The burgers were a decent size, but no one in my party of 4 had any leftovers, including my 9 year old sister. So obviously they weren't huge entrees for the price. And speaking of kids, the kids menu consisted of 2 items: an $8 grilled cheese and a $10 burger. My little sister ended up just ordering an adult $11 burger and added avocado (+$1.50). There were plenty of burger options that sounded amazing, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay $18 for a casual restaurant burger. So overall, the food was very good, but I don't see myself going very often because I personally don't like spending $15-20 for a burger. But if you don't mind the pricing, I have no complaints about the flavor of the food.",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,0,0,3,c_lAx0h9l4nChajoCjc_ew
5973546,2013-03-14,0,ZibmYdOPKLlqDM9oR6xzOA,"If you want a huge party in your mouth - Bachi Burger is the place to be.  There is absolutely nothing bland about their burgers. Simple it is not. 

I am embarrassed to admit it but I actually first tried Bachi the day after seeing an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  And I am even more embarrassed to admit that my husband and I ordered everything that Guy ordered and even we found it to be ""burger bomb.com"". 

We started with the pork belly sliders and loved it.  The steamed bun was nice and fluffy.  The pork belly was more pork fat than meat, but that is what makes it so delicious (and dangerous).  

The oxtail chili cheese fries are also good and I am glad we tried it our first time.  I wish there was a half order because it is a huge portion. It is meant to feed a family. Regardless, we prefer the truffle parmesan fries and it is a much more reasonable sized serving.  I am not a fan of the sun dried tomato aioli that accompanies it, but at least the fries are flavorful enough that they do not even need the dipping sauce.  

The Banh-Mi burger is the very first one we tried and it was filled with tons of flavor.  I love the hint of lemongrass and ginger.  The curry aioli puts this burger over the top.  We have also tried the Kiki's burger, Miyagi San's grass fed Waygu burger, and the Ronin burger over our multiple visits and they have all been quite delicious.  My favorite, however, is still the Banh-Mi.  My only complaint is that whenever we ask for ""medium"", it always comes out well done.  

My kids also enjoy the kids menu of a grilled cheese or bachi burger, with fries and fruits and veggies.  Everything is delicious.  The menu is creative.  There are also tons of boba milk teas and milkshakes if you still have room in your belly.  

I love the decor- it is so modern and sleek.  The service has always been fantastic.  I have never had to wait for a table for lunch, but on fridays and weekend dinners- definitely expect to wait.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,1,2,4,1YywYH2ftCefbDVoEj7v_Q

Aside from a really long wait before even meeting our waiter, bringing us the wrong burger and informing us we'll have to pay for it still (even if it was a couple bucks more doesn't matter to me) But it still wasn't what we ordered, already fed up with the service at this point I agreed in hopes of just enjoying my meal with my father who was a first timer here. This wasn't really the impression I wanted him to get.
