My co worker and I ended up getting the combo plate...it had pork chops, beef lula, regular beef and chicken.  On top of a large bed of rice.  Oh man, just $12 for this hearty carnivorous meal.  Comes with a grilled tomato and jalapeno for garnish.  I was only able to eat half.  Service was fairly quick.  We got ours to go, but atmosphere is fun and colorful.  If my feet didn't hurt, I wouldn't have minded eating there.  That day, I just wanted to get home in a hurry.",EtQsx3YaPrxh4sg-qQh8DA,1,0,4,Q-zwO-SlOVyZx8rM9yUglw

Plate come with a choice of fries, salad or rice. Alot of food for the price. The jalapenos are fiery! Be warned!",p-xQUBvVKIssxJgkZeBX_Q,1,0,4,0A3DNi3Zhwc6UC0AH2libg

For reasons I won't go into..I'm vegetarian for the month of January.  I am pretty much hating it so far and I'm only 5 days in but I figured I would try this place out since they offer a few things the W.Flam location doesn't.  These things include gyros, beef shawarma and FALAFEL.  

I got the falafel plate since the only alternative was a ""falafel burger"".  I would've ordered a falafel sandwich w/ pita had that been a choice.  

The atmosphere is pretty much set up for people on the go.  I imagine people on conventions might get a quick bite here.  Drunk bastards/bitches would be fine here since they're open til 3am daily and all their furniture is plastic.  

So I was a bit excited when they brought out my plate.  4 huge falafel balls along with the usual things Shish Kabob House offers like the roasted pepper and tomato.  But they don't include salad at this location and the rice isn't as good here.  

My excitement completely died as I had my first bite .  Dry, bland..almost like eating an overdone oatmeal raisin cookie and it kinda crumbled like it too.  They also served a side of super thick kinda tzatziki sauce which didn't go too well with it.  I would have much rather had tahini or hummus but I am not shelling out $4.95 for a side order of it.  Really unsatisfying.  

I have no question that their kabob menu is just as excellent as the original location but they shouldn't be serving falafel here.  The W. Flamingo location is better to go to..ambiance (even though they use folding tables), side salad with your entree and music from their country as opposed to Fuse TV playing at the strip location.

I might be back here...but it'll only be for LAMB CHOPS!!!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,8,4,2,PSTcIU8xUJkZw5Rhp-0OYw
