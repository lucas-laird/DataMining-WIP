486930,2017-07-23,0,ytYtMuk0URV6tk9m0zhDoA,I made an online order. It said it was completed and ready to pick up. When I got there 5-10 minutes later they had sold some of my order and I had to wait for them to make more. The purpose of placing the order online was so I wouldn't have to wait. This location sucks!,U4c1iD8nCPcc4BNCBz-vTA,1,0,1,SZbc4tP2DMaDdW2IGroufA

I walked in and was immediately greeted. Three cashier was very pleasant and made eye contact with me. I think they're trying to conserve energy cuz it appears they air wasn't blowing to full capacity. With it being hot, the ovens going, & bodies, they need to ramp up the air a bit. 

Well I ordered the 3 meat treat and I had to wait about 10 minutes for them to make it. Well it was good as expected as I sometimes actually enjoy this place when I'm in that ""I DON'T CARE"" mood. It did what it was supposed to do which was fill my belly and some leftover for lunch tomorrow.

So I gave an extra star for the great customer service the young lady had given me.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,4,Fc39hKuHEoGn-XrN_nFrQQ
1562064,2016-08-15,1,ytYtMuk0URV6tk9m0zhDoA,I come here all the time. But today was just not a good experience. Inside was full of flies. Even the cashiers had to be waiving the flies off. I ordered some wings and pizza. The size of the wings is getting ridiculous. It's pretty much just the bone. The size of the wing is like baby carrot plus they where one step away from being burnt.,BD6wfWTT--CGMzfOJPv1cg,2,0,1,lFjUZM7G1otOKHXt3U9g3g

The past 2 times we have ordered pizza, crazy bread and crazy sauce with cinnamon bread for desert. 
Little Caesar HAS NOT giving us the crazy sauce with our bagged order.
I have called and instead of them trying to fix their error by telling me next time I will get crazy bread or something.. They say ""oh sorry do you want to come back and get the crazy sauce""
Heck No that isn't good customer service at all. I am not going to leave home to go back because your employees can't get the order into the portal correct.",Y3OYlQa6wkdVvSc9sBynnw,0,0,3,zm3DGq6SqDidFzo4bzl-VA
2906767,2017-02-08,0,ytYtMuk0URV6tk9m0zhDoA,"This is a good place to go for very affordable and fast pizza. Their $5.00 pizzas are always ready to go, so you don't have to wait long unless there's a line. The cashier was friendly and helpful, and there's ample parking outside. We had to feed a small crowd, so Little Caesars' pricing is easy on the wallet. I have been here several times already and have never been disappointed with the taste. My only wish is that they would expand their choices for their $5.00 menu.",jIH2fzQfXY7RW3C3W1Z1iQ,0,0,3,Kftbj8aDyt-ohzuGC6ub4w
4551105,2013-09-03,0,ytYtMuk0URV6tk9m0zhDoA,Pretty standard little Caesars. Not lower quality than the other ones. The floor inside isn't the clearnest little Caesars floor I've been on top of. The cheese pizza is a cheap way to go in terms of feeding people.,BS3qOK1iRLcWtoV9KnwyXg,0,0,3,21I_8YVElBOa_5HZkxZ-Zg
4845877,2017-09-18,0,ytYtMuk0URV6tk9m0zhDoA,"The 3 stars is for the quality of the pizza. We ordered 6 of the extra most bestest online 2 hours prior to our desired pick up time of 5:45.  We also paid online, so need to hassle at pick up time. 

Arrived at the location at 5:40 stood in a line of over 15 people and advised of my order. I was told my order was ""NOT"" ready and it would be about 4 minutes. Mind you at this time after waiting in that line, it is passed the pick up request time. I waited 8 minutes, then asked again about my order. I was told another 4 minutes.  I finally walked out the door with my pizza's at 5:56.  16 minutes after arrival, 11 minutes passed the order time, that you had a 2 hour online notice of.  

There was plenty of staff on hand and it was a busy ""fight night"" Saturday.  My thoughts on this are the staff on site are not trained on how to execute the orders in a timely and organized fashion.  

As you all know all L.C. locations are small and are not comfortable for people to stand in a line of 15 deep.  This is a corporate problem, not a local problem.  We all know L.C. company is aware of this, and they will never fix the issue; have to save $$$ some how.  

I prefer the extra most bestest over the basic $5.00 pizza.  The pizza was good, hot and fresh, so you all know I will be back.  

My complaint is this; make a disclaimer on your ordering process that says "" your order is for a desired pick up time only, there is not a chance it is going to be ready when you walk in the door unless you arrive 20 minutes late.  

Most of the people in the location were complaining and many left without ordering.  One lady began to yell, ""why should she wait in line for pick up, when she ordered online and it should be ready when she walks in the door.""  They got her pizzas to her right away!  I could have yelled and fussed to, but what for.",SJuSiO27FTKi5qKrNDa8Lg,0,0,3,RR5wQdxVNmdfwrwng8kZ7Q
5143248,2017-12-19,0,ytYtMuk0URV6tk9m0zhDoA,I had bought some crazy bread . Not knowing they were burnt. They were really hard I couldn't bite them. I was more embarrassed to return them. Then they were to sell them like that. I strongly think they should pay attention to what they are cooking. I will not be buying crazy bread no more,MGP-FrGPRFl3_3c5-WDD1w,2,0,1,TSvmvibh50yto5DLOFr4Sw

On a Saturday afternoon what kind of business operates like this. The girl at the register is overworked and no one is helping her.
