The last four times there has been something wrong with my order. They always seem to forget the extra marinara sauce I order, yet charge me for it. The pizza has been cold. And this last time the breadsticks were so hard, I had to throw them away. Mind you, I keep going back because I do love the chicken wings, but I think I have finally had enough.",WhfOpOuyxsxR7VueK7_glg,0,0,1,vdupGZwhV32gwC_66qBEtg

So I just got off the phone with this location about my online order and them not being able to fill my order because they were all ""Out"" of the personal pan pizza dough/crust. In actuality it was because this was a promotion of 50% off regular priced pizza ordered online which brought my regular order of 3 pizzas to $9.34 after tax and delivery. Now since they were ""Out"" of this dough/crust they could change the dough/crust in the system and it would only change to $25.64 before delivery and taxes. So instead of making things right and offering to give me my order at the discounted price with the other crust I was told all they could do was change the crust in the computer, but I would have to pay the difference. 
My question is how in the heck does a pizza location go out of its most popular dough knowing they have this promotion? Answer: They don't. They just try to bully you into paying more for a ""different"" crust. How do I know..I just called them again to place an order over the phone for the same thing and it wasn't a problem because they could charge me regular price since it wasn't an online special promotion. Funny how the dough/crust is now available.",210Ly7VhYJiLQJs5TMLL9A,4,1,1,6B2CCx11r-om5RRjSdW3EA

I ordered a large pizza, a pasta, breadsticks and a root beer. What I got, over an hour and a half later, was the wrong pizza, bone cold pasta, breadsticks without sauce, and a Pepsi , which is just motor oil with sugar, ( the driver said they were out of my soda, but they could have atleast called and asked what I wanted instead of root beer), dropped off by an incredibly rude driver. The fact that they tried to charge me for this I take as an insult. I will never be using this Pizza Hut again, Pizza Hut in general is questionable. For those of you who care about food, I would recommend AGAINST this establishment. For somebody who normally smiles at others mistakes, this was unbelievable. At least the manager had the common sense to give me back my money. Besides that small bit of decency, I would have given this place a zero or negative one, if that were even possible.

It's definitely quick service and the driver was nice, but that's about it.  The phone App is horrible.  I had to try several times to get my order in the cart correctly because it would take me to a web page and then clear my order.  That was my first warning sign, but I chose to ignore it.

This Pizza Hut makes their pizzas the way I remember Pizza Hut making their pizzas when I was a kid... perfect amount of cheese and pepperonis cooked to an ALMOST crispness so that when you bite into the pizza there's that slight crunch before you get to the soft dough. 

And they arrive that way after being delivered!

Most of the other Pizza Huts I've been to over the years have hardly mastered that in store...forget delivery! And all of our delivery persons have been so stellar! I can always hear the one driver ""It's Pizza Time!"" whenever we have a pizza night. 

We've never had any major order discrepancies and the one time that we did, they had really great customer service about the problem and were quick to take care of us. 

What it all boils down to is this: the pies are always fresh and delicious and the people are consistently awesome.

I placed my order online for a thin crust with pepperoni,  Italian sausage, and mushrooms on a garlic parmesan base with salted pretzel flavor crust. The website said that my order would be ready in 15 minutes. 

I arrived at the store 15 minutes later. When I walked in the guy at the register was counting cash but no other customers were around. He kept doing whatever it was for a minute or two, finished,  closed the register,  and walked to the back of the restaurant without greeting me. He seemed young but that's no excuse when a simple hello,  smile,  or I'll be right with you could make a customer feel welcome. Instead I felt like I was bothering him. When he came back to the counter he just stood there looking at me. I took this as a subliminal offer to help me. I explained that I had placed an online order and was there to pick it up. I gave him my name. He immediately went into a speech about the website and that it should have told me that there would be a 30 minute wait. I told him my pizza was confirmed ready for this time. He went back to his speech about needing 30 more minutes. I pointed to the screen on the wall behind him. It displayed my name with the word ready next to it. Upon seeing this, one of the cooks who had came from the back asked for me name again and grabbed it from the pizzas that were ready and waiting to be picked up. The cook opened the box so that I could verify that my order was correct. He even made a joke to try to salvage the interaction. This is the type of employee that should be dealing with customers. The current cashier needs to be retrained or replaced. 

The pizza was okay.  It was very greasy but I was able to blot it before eating. The only reason I come to Pizza Hut(about once a year) is the pretzel crust. It's delicious and the salt adds to the overall pizza flavor. 

Pizza from a corporate store isn't the best. The service at this location makes it even worse.",csEL3VrnnX-T2rWX16v3nA,0,0,2,YrNSB79S62wSrroIbYYuBQ

I was picking my husband up from work (in a gated residential community) Thursday night 6/13 when a silver jeep commando (with the Pizza Hut hat on its roof displaying the telephone number of (702) 253-9011) sped by me.  As we were driving out of the gates, the same silver jeep commando was riding our butt and then started beeping his horn at us WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE GATE TO OPEN!  I then called the 253-9011 number, was given the run around by the telephone answerer, I asked for a supervisor who advised their store does not deliver to 7885 W. Flamingo, he offered the telephone number of the store that would deliver to that address.  I dialed the number and got a recording that said they were closed.  I then called several other pizza hut stores asking if they delivered to 7885 W Flamingo, they all pointed me to the store I originally called.

Arrived at the store to pick up my order after 20 min where on the order status is written my order was ready 4 minutes prior my arrival (awesome right) yeah you would think so,
Cashier- sir I do apologize for the inconvenience and for the wait time if you would like I can give you a free soda with your order.  Your order is not ready yet, it should be ready in about 15 to 20 min, well I guess I'll wait right. Total wait time amount 65 minutes. Cashier goes back and get my order ready without even washing her hands , are you serious!!
Then accidentally she drops something on the floor and without hesitation she grabs it and grabs my pizza with it. This is just ridiculous, 
When I asked her if she washed her hands and regarding dirty dish she denied it.
Places like this need to be shut down and not serve to public, I had other experiences with other location pizza hot but nothing like this.  Also cleanliness is disgusting, food all over the floor, see pics",N-pQ3ncaxB47VbmuFcrZ8w,1,1,1,y2tPFmN_c3WAAPVqNARX8g
4090499,2017-02-03,0,VIxWlFefTnFQPkAvDNURjg,"Probably the worst pizza experience of my life. I ordered two pizzas online. I usually have no problem ordering online but this was just ridiculous. My ready to pick up time was suppose to be 7:12pm. I ended up getting to Pizza Hut to pick it up around 7:20 and it wasn't ready. So I waited and when they showed me, one of my pizzas had the wrong toppings. The first girl who helped was very nice about it but still I was pretty annoyed that i waited longer than I should have. Girl#1 tells girl#2 that they made the wrong pizza and girl#2 says well what does she want us to do? And girl#1 says she wants us to make her the correct pizza (girl#1 is way nicer by the way). So they keep going back and forth and girl#2 is just not understanding that I just want another pizza to replace the one they messed up. I'm very annoyed at this point because i shouldn't have had to wait this long in the first place, so I go up to girl#2 and tell her I just want what I ordered and then she tells me I'm going to have to pay for another pizza. I'm very irritated and confused at this point. I ask her why I have to pay for another pizza if they are the ones who did not get my order correctly in the first place. We go back and forth for a few minutes and I just tell her what I wanted on my new pizza and she says that they're just going to make me another one. At this point I'm over it. I just want my pizzas and to go home. And after I walk away girl#2 asks girl#1 which pizza I wanted!!!! So I am livid at this point and I walk back up to the counter and tell the girl what kind of pizza I wanted. I had to show her on my phone what I had ordered even though she was holding the receipt in her hand and I had to remind her of the wings I ordered also. When I finally ended up getting both pizzas, the first one was already cold. There was a lot of people complaining about how their orders were not ready on time also.

5522417,2014-12-08,0,VIxWlFefTnFQPkAvDNURjg,"Ordered multiple times from this Pizza Hut location, and were consistently unimpressed. The service was decent and the delivery guys were friendly enough, but they never got the pizza to us either fast or hot (which, in effect, may well have been one in the same had they been on the ball).
The pizzas we received with each order had obviously either sat in the restaurant for longer than they should prior to dispatch, or had been in whatever Pizza Hut calls their keep-warm sleeves they transport the pies in. The service times were also notably slower than other delivery joints in the area--I'm not going to compare Pizza Hut to Jimmy John's or somewhere that prides itself on super-speedy service of things that don't require baking, but Domino's was far superior in both timeframe and quality of delivered goods, for instance--and overall, I was far less impressed with this Pizza Hut than I was with... well, everyone else.
When we moved into their service area, we first noticed that the service was slower than it had been on the other side of town from a different location. Having called in orders to both, I realize that they had longer hold times as well, which could account for longer delivery times, but if all the pizzas are getting baked and ready but not getting delivered while the cheese is still hot and stringy on a consistent basis, you either need to wait another couple of minutes before throwing the next batch of pizzas through the oven, or hire more drivers. If you're doing the amount of business that requires a five-minute hold time on the telephone, you can afford another driver for rush situations, right?
Overall, we stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut and started ordering from Domino's. Quality was better, speed of service was better. Which means that they're doing the job of pizza delivery better, end of story.",umpKz5SA6UPEs0_bsuFKfA,1,0,2,fSEZNZLVNHeqF9F79uDH1w
