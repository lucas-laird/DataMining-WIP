696155,2007-12-18,0,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,I have been to another one of these in northern california and I have to say I was disappointed in my steak. It was charred on the outside and I couldn't cut it with my fork like I normally can. Not a good place to check out in Vegas. I would try another steakhouse.,EFSWzA3-jfyfLwiW2fB7xA,0,0,2,xLIOAJpUmRoP9fFV-D51-Q

The upscale chain in the middle of a strip mall...the wait time for a confirmed reservation. The Warm Spinach Salad in which was cold with very little dressing(usually served warm hence the name of the salad) then to top it all off my petite fillet with shrimp ordered medium served bloody with fishy shrimp blech....not so much. The sides of steamed Broccoli (hard) and the sweet potatoes (tooooooo sweet). This was the worst dinner that I have ever had in Vegas and at a Ruth's Chris...the only good thing was our server...and the calamari i had elsewhere after eating at this location. Lastly, when i went on line to leave a comment, i never received anything back, so keep driving past this Ruth's Chris.",rfiR8jocBAsLji15MzWD3g,1,0,1,lZCF54pLtJS7l8Sdzh5yhQ
808401,2008-04-16,0,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,"This was a very nice Ruth's Chris, it's kind of in a dumpy strip mall, but worth the cab ride.   As usual, the wine list was excellent but seemed overpriced more than usual.  (I guess it's Vegas.)  The steak is excellent, as usual.  They seemed to cook the steaks extra hot with extra butter, they cautioned us to cover up with the napkins if we didn't want to get burned.  but the steak was wonderful!  The sides were very good, but seemed a little lighter than normal.  The decor is standard steakhouse, tasteful, dark, woody, with bright paintings.  

The service was superb, as always, the manager came out to see how everyone was doing.  As always, an exquisite dining experience (especially if you are into steaks and butter...)",WTnwAd9QPcIuOLsp0DpSCw,1,0,5,DmYBFLGoa9Y8ETCiD71HWQ
991465,2009-05-18,0,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,"Probably one of my favorite steak houses. I just like the way they cook their steaks. Especially when you hear it coming to your table sizzling with butter. Yummy! I came here once at 11 PM and I ordered a steak medium rare and it was in front of me in less than fifteen minutes. Wow, such quick service. I also had the au gratin potatoes and it was creamy and cheesy. I also like their shoestring potatoes,tasty and very crispy. They had several ways of cooking spuds and they all looked inviting, too bad I could not order thenm all at once. I have never had bad steak here. Its an old reliable for me.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,0,0,4,lBitDBJRHBE0yi2XFP73XQ

To be honest I'm a huge steak fan, and when I heard that Ruth's Chris was the best of the best I had to try it. First things first the service was great. Our waitress was on the ball with everything. Then the food. I ordered a New York strip medium rare. The meat was unbelievably tender and full of flavor. I was even able to cut it with a butter knife! No lie this place knows how to tenderize. Then on to the sides, first I tried the garlic mashed potatoes and the texture of the potatoes were excellent!
Had a Great birthday with my family and girlfriend but the only thing was the downside was the bill =/ Around $900 for 12 people",WirOTrcRoS_FrbiCsP5-iw,0,0,5,-RiuD10ZnuW0JTiSwBpNPg

1764298,2009-08-14,0,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,"My mouth waters just thinking of this place! The BF and I went to Vegas last weekend, and opted for a dinner at Ruth's Chris. We'd been to this location about a year ago, and after the horrific service we received at their Paradise Rd location this past February, we opted to come back here. 

It is located in an unassuming strip mall a good distance from the strip, but if that keeps my wait time down to nothing for a table, hey I don't mind the $11 cab ride out there. The service here is just wonderful! Our waitress was friendly and helped us pick out a bottle of wine. And our food came out just at the right pace. Both of our steaks were cooked just as requested and were mighty tasty!

Sadly though, it appears as though this location is closing down =( They had a sign in their lobby directing patrons to frequent the Paradise Rd location in the future. And I guess that means the end of Ruth's Chris dinners in Vegas for me, since I refuse to return to the other location. http://www.yelp.com/biz/ruths-chris-steak-house-las-vegas-2#hrid:YfjHw0PU2ZRJiE4yItk5EQ",ADIMCaJqpUy97l8LMOtHYA,2,0,5,UgcCtyNt_JlvPY3QK5WVOg

2 orders of crab salad (Awesome!) Just PURE fresh crabmeat, lemon, and a sort of ""Louie"" dipping sauce. MMMMmmmmm
1 order fried calamari
1 wedge salad
1 field greens with vinaigrette (YUM)
1 chopped salad
3 iced teas
steak
filet mignon
lobster (very good, tender not rubbery or over-cooked)

2420022,2010-10-14,3,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,"When i was in Vegas, me and my friends wanted to eat good so we tried the Ruth's Chris here on Flamingo down the street from RIO.  To start off, my roommate Eugene wore a wife beater shirt and they would NOT let us in!! I was like ""wth??""....Even i was wearing a beater as well but because i'm a girl, it's acceptable and for him it's not?? Whatever...anyhow, Eugene ended up wearing one of my girly fuschia cardigans in!! LOL!! it was SOOOOOOOO funny!! they let us in and us 4 ate there.  The girly cardigan was stretched beyond belief but it was fine with me because i was going to throw it away anyhow.  The host sat us down with a dirty look.  What a snotty girl.  Don't they want to make more money??  Anyways, i ordered their filet mignon and it was not even done right, i asked for it rare medium and they thought i was retarded until i explained it to them.  At first the waiter kind of snappy with me and said ""we only do it medium rare, that's what you're talking about, correct?""....i said to him ""i want it more rare than medium and that's why i said rare medium and not medium rare"".  I think he got offended or something.  I'm no chef by any means but i told them that i would like it about 125-130 degrees farenheit if that makes it easier for the chef.  I said it in the most genuinely and sincere way but i still don't think he appreciated me telling him. LOL, whatevers...i was having a good time watching my friend act gay with my hot pink cardigan on. hahahaha, The steak turned out whatevers.  Service was rude, food was overpriced and not even made close to my liking.  The one in Orange County is SOOO much better, they actually care about their customers and the chefs take pride in their cooking skills.  We left them a good $25 tip for our $100 bill, but i also left a lil note letting them know that they should lighten up a bit ;)  Oh, and if you're the owner/manager at this specific Ruth's Chris and you're reading my review, tell your host that works there on sunday nights that i think she needs to take a break and relax already!!! ::))",kbshS9mp2Q-QbGebUBxBlw,1,0,2,V0P4LTvAT3I-2qY1ltr2QA

3377360,2008-09-02,0,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,"I usually love Ruths Chris, but this particular location was pretty ghetto.  It's in the center of a strip mall next to a Subway.  It's not what I expected.  The food was consistently good as always like all the other Ruths Chris locations I've been to.",yKdBqGzq7qibvI3PkR_8SQ,2,0,3,JWDq4GjCpx3fVWxpQtwFAw
5441106,2009-07-29,1,ZMHejhR3yoFzR-RSJmxwgw,"When I eat at a Ruth's Chris, I've come to expect excellent food and even better service.  My experience at this location, however, did not meet my expectations.

It's located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient, but the fa√ßade was not very impressive.  Our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone, instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.

The waitress was friendly, but gave the ""welcome to Ruth's Chris"" spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.

I ordered the Crabatini which was excellent.  A friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table, though, and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.  It also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bits into.  

Shortly before our steaks arrived, an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable server's assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we don't get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.  My ribeye steak and the rest of our party's filets arrived.  After taking my first bite, I thought, where is all of the sizzling butter I was warned about and craved?  The steak was good, but just not as great as all of the other times I've been.  My side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as I remember though.

After finishing about  1/2 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma, I realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.  It is Vegas in the summer time; it is alright to crank the air conditioning up!  There was no dessert for me; I just wanted to flee the scene.  

I am sure I'm being overly critical but Ruth's Chris is supposed to be a top notch steak house with superb service.  Other times I've visited rated 4.5 to 5 stars; maybe this location just needs some new management.   

I will return, but just not to this location.",sEwuaUOyJE0RMYeKyXvqHw,3,1,2,1Xv-XHQNPfk_n278Cjt0qQ
