In a word, Woo-Che Asian Grill Buffet is just awful. There are several buffet stations to chose from. The first area is a selection of chilled raw or marinated beef, chicken, and shrimp. You choose what you want and then bring them back to your table which has a built-in grill. Sounds good so far, right? The other stations include a rice station, chilled veggies, sushi and Japanese selections, kimche, and other assorted Korean favorites.

Where do I start?

The buffet sections that are supposed to be chilled are only slightly cooler then room temperature and the foods that are supposed to be hot are tepid at best. Honestly, I am shocked that the health department hasn't shut them down. 

Now to the food. Okay, I know I just said that food wasn't kept at proper temperatures...and we should have looked at the buffet before being seated, but the people that I was with decided they wanted to give it a try. I admit to being a sheep...and without protest, I stayed.

The unknown meats were somewhat disgusting. OMG, they were so chewy and gristly I had to choke them down or pull bits out of my mouth. The marinated chicken had a weird coloration. Of course, like an idiot, I ate some. 

The bottom line is that the meats were actually quite bad. The rice was cold, the pieces of stuff they called ""sushi"" were at room temperature, and the Korean specialties that they offered were not to my liking. That may be due to the fact that I'm unfamiliar with Korean food. Nobody went back for seconds...and this is an all-you-can-eat joint! That says a lot.

To boot, it's fairly spendy for lunch at $12.99. Not outrageous, but high considering the food quality. 

When we drove out of the parking lot we took odds (hey, we're in Vegas!) on whether or not we would get food poisoning. I figured there was a 30% chance I would get sick, but fortunately I was fine and nobody else in my party felt the least bit ill. A miracle. 

This definitely ranks up there with one of the worst meal experiences I've ever had. Even if they fixed the hot/cold situation, I wouldn't go back. The unfortunate part is that it really turned me off from ever trying Korean food again.",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,2,0,1,i_Qk3FR_AohERI5rNnJByw

All I can say is, if you are just interested in eating meats, and planning to skip side orders like kimchi, sushi and other nonsense Chinese items they offer here, then this is the place to go for a really good price. The flavors are good, and steamed rice is just fine as a partner. All their kimchi items and everything else seem to bring them down. They should just take them out altogether, if you ask me. 

Other than that, go for just the Korean BBQ. That's it. It's really worth it just for that.",NkE-ORKVsdVAtwOGuBsbsw,1,1,3,tPENELgtZj-o0kA3IZoLwA

Theres a sign that says basically if you waste to much food it'll be 10 more. Makes me more aware of only taking lil portion of things I haven't tried. All in all great value awesome spot to pig out on Korean BBQ.",RJIVvmsWquCDPl85NahsBA,0,0,5,DmA-EBVetPAFsvwuLbUILg
