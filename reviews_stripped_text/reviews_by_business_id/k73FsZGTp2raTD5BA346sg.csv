Everytime I go there they mess up my order, the service is soo slow, and they never have things in stock. One time I went here and they were out of coffee lids so the employee just gave me the coffee without it, and I was in the drive through. Also the coffee had a layer of grounds on the top of it. I ask them for a low carb ask them twice to make sure it's a low carb, and I get it with the bun. This last time I went I asked for a natural burger low carb without cheese, the girl repeated the order twice and I got a Jalapeno burger. What the f!?? Unfortunately this is the closest one to my house and my son like carls jr but I'am not going back!! They need to fire the whole staff and get new management.",svsdqcubDEdFGarW-Wi8zw,0,0,1,emxZ0gPHLAPszQzVajn-yg

I had to correct her but it didn't bother her any. After that I pulled up to the window and paid for my food. After she hands me my food she quickly turns around and walks away. I tried my hardest to catch her before she got to far but she just ignored me. I knocked on the window several times.... honked several times and just waited. I easily waited about 4 minutes before I Googled the phone number and called inside... I told her that I was still in the drive thru and I have been waiting here trying to get her attention. She laughed at me and I hung up. Finally she came back to the window and didn't apologize or anything. I received the items I needed and left. I will never return to this Carl's Jr again!

One you could not understand the person trying to take your order and then in the middle of giving our order 4 times He disappears off the speaker! My husband kept saying hello are you there. Then the guy comes back like nothing happened!!
I was not a fan of the Biscuts and gravy. the Biscuts tasted like they were over done and just sitting there. YUCK... My husband ordered the Western Bacon with extra BBQ. I would hate to see it if we did not order extra BBQ. Looks like they squirted a nickel size of BBQ and that was it.

3480587,2014-12-08,6,k73FsZGTp2raTD5BA346sg,"Originally I used to like this location because it was convenient for lunch purposes.  Today I've had the worst experience out of all the restaurants I've eaten at.  A few weeks ago I was eating at this location and I took a photo of an employee texting on her phone and posted it to Yelp which you possibly can still view.  Harmless photo....

Well today after I ate my lunch I was getting  ready to leave and I was approached by an employee that works here.  As he approached me he had a phone in his hand and he had my yelp profile pulled up and asked if that was me. I stated yes but I thought it was a little weird that he'd have my profile on his phone.  This employee states that his management wanted me to take a photo down that I posted a few weeks ago and that it was against the law for me to post a picture of an employee without their consent to yelp.  This same employee then stated that the mother of the employee I snapped a photo of worked there and that the employee was UNDER AGE.  I then asked him if she was under age what is she doing working there?  He really didn't have a reply for that.  I asked this employee to show me where it's against  the law to take photos and post them to yelp.  

He then got a little irate.  It just amazed me that instead of serving the customers he's going through his phone and pulling up yelp reviews and confronting customers with them.  One minute he is stating that management wants me to take the photo off and then the next minute he's telling me I'm breaking the law and that Carl's Jr has lawyers and they could sue me.  At this point I was tired of listening to his nonsense and asked him to get out of my face.  Then this employee had the nerve to tell me to get out of HIS store.  All this over a photo!  At this point this employee starts yelling for his manager across the store with other customers in the store.  

This same employee has horrible customer service.  Several weeks before this incident today I ordered a simple low carb burger and went to sit down.  I watched 3 other customers come in and order and receive their food before me.  So I went to ask for a refund.  At first he say he couldn't do a refund and that I would have to come back for a refund because a manager was there. I demanded a refund because I waited around 15 minutes and watched other get their food.  So then  he's telling me I have to sign a receipt saying I got a refund. I declined to sign the receipt.  I didn't sign anything when I paid for the food.  I was a little upset because my food was sitting under the warmer the whole time and he just either refused to bring it out or was just overlooked it.  Ever since then he  has had a chip on his shoulder.  

One thing I do not like about situations like this is that when you say your going to make a complaint to corporate or their district manager....he responds with his first and last name like he's bullet proof or untouchable. This employee thinks it's okay to confront customers in the store and demand them to alter their reviews or photos.....then states it's managers request and then wrongly quotes the law.  I  think managers are smart enough to realize not to mention anything positive or negative involving reviews especially since it's a fast food chain.   I feel this is a case of an employee just thinking he can say or do whatever he wants involving customers.",_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,9,5,1,1QlPoPU14HMPt10pZx_mDg

All I want is a strawberry malt after work around 7-8 p.m. Apparently when a young lady named Crystal works they never have ice cream or milk. I've been there 8 times in two months and I've only had the malt made twice and it was from a young man named Charles. I've even spoken to management as Charles was making my second malt and she told me that the young lady that works nights gets a lot of complaints. She told me that she's heard from guest that she's rude and unprofessional. This came straight from managements mouth. I gave this one star for Charles helping me and giving me great customer service.

Showed on screen 2 drinks charged and I asked but no answer. Its okey I thought being over charged for 99 cents only, besides I was in rush. Passed to pay, the staff ( I assumed her name is Tiara) with no hello, no thank you and no smile but sour disgust face passed the order even without eye contact since she was busy chatting about her schedule with other staff. My child sip the drink and found out wasn't ice tea but fruit punch. Went around to drive through again, without apology the same staff just grab the drink from my hand. And asked another staff to passed my right drink. The same attitude I got from the this blue hair staff, she passed the drink and slam the window in front of me. I got no straw and had to kept calling hello and beg for it. Found out was ice tea plain and no sugar offered. How ""amazed"" with kind of attitude of Carl Jr two staff who don't know how to say hi, thank you, apology even a smile, I can say your staff are rude. So curious how did you get and recruit them?
