1030313,2017-11-06,0,S-xZzaHeMyMcqf66GAC4wA,"ahh the good ole boardwalk. Back when I began coming to Vegas in my early 20's this was the place I usually stayed besides the Imperial Palace. There definitely was nothing special about the boardwalk besides the cheap rooms at a great location. Ya facade was cheesy, ya the food was barely edible, ya they gave me a room once that was already occupied, but the entertainment was worth the money. The Prince cover band was solid and you could always find an open slot or table to get on. I was definitely sad that they imploded this place to make room for city center but the memories of my early vegas years will always include the boardwalk.",WPDgiaAxSmCvb3MZTPHrkw,1,2,5,GOgZNmdNrW15SBXmzAfSLA
1390476,2007-02-11,3,S-xZzaHeMyMcqf66GAC4wA,"Oh, so everyone else gave the Boardwalk one star...Not me, baby!  Yes, I realize it's been torn down/blown up/otherwise undone by human hands...

Why do I love thee so?  Well, this was the site of my wedding.  My marriage.  My betrothal, if you will...  

Okay, so we were broke kids in love, looking to elope in Vegas after a (LONG ASS) drive there from SF.  In July.  With no air conditioning.  If our love can survive that, it can survive anything, right?  So far, yes.  

Also, the Boardwalk had a fabulous and small casino, unbelievable Prince revival every night and pretty damn good odds.  Also, a very sincere but cheesy ministeress who performed our wedding (much to our delight, althoug it was difficult, nee impossible, to supress our giggles)....

Great place, now gone.  You know they'll build something better in its place.  We'll be there for our 10 year, 25 year and 50 year reunion.  Oh yeah...",aAx84XXAWKrK9SyfGps_nw,5,6,5,b1y8I__mjSMg0bsI9FXDSg

First of all, I was by myself, and for all you females out there, listen to me when I say, use the internal door locks, regardless of where you are staying. Anywhoo, after a long, debaucherous night, I go back to my room and pass out. Which was surprising because it seemed every Frat house in America had booked there and judging by the noise had plans on reliving Animal House there that night. So a moment of silence finally comes and I'm awaken by a key at my door, I don't know who was on the other side of that door, or why they were there, but they had OPENED my door. That's when I ran to the door, locked the internal lock, called front desk, packed and got the hell out of there. Good riddance.",h9unlpk_s18jhml22Jt6aQ,19,14,1,S9x11tH3WP732pE9Vow5BQ

2380447,2005-06-23,2,S-xZzaHeMyMcqf66GAC4wA,"I was delighted to stumble upon a Prince lounge act at the Boardwalk Casino. Who doesn't love a little Prince in Vegas? On Saturday night, you can find a few fake Princes lounging around - my friends and I saw the purple jumpsuit prince (yay!) and a strangely large Prince in a tiger striped blazer (boo!). And remember they take their lounge acts seriously in Vegas. My friend was so delighted to see him, that she busted out her digicam and started snapping pictures. Much to our dismay, we got booted out of the lounge. All my friend could yell as we were escorted out was ""What's the problem? It's not like he's the REAL prince.""",VQ-RXIZCH-7eRG8jSMmr9w,1,2,3,kTat2pzPGrl93hHhA0WDLw
2911644,2013-11-17,11,S-xZzaHeMyMcqf66GAC4wA,"Man, how I miss this place! When I first moved to Las Vegas over 10 years ago, this was my first casino job(hard count, than soft count)...so many great memories!

Even before I moved here, as a tourist I loved dropping in here and playing because I would actually win a little bit each time. Mind you, not enough to retire, but enough to make it fun...

They had a cool little Race and Sports Book, (which has some interesting history behind it!) the Del Mar Deli downstairs.....and , if you were feeling truly fearless, they had the Surf Buffet up the escalators! Anybody else remember those commercials with Butterbean?? lol

Plus, Trent Carlini used to bring his great Elvis impersonation show to the Boardwalk....that is, until ""Prince"" and the ""Purple Reign"" came in! lol

Yes, its was small. Yes it wasn't the cleanest place on the strip. But this place exuded personality and charm at every step. How I wish I could step back in there one more time! So many fond and happy memories!

I really don't care what anybody says...this is MY Yelp!, MY rules, MY page...so I'm giving it...


5 stars!

3522329,2016-05-15,2,S-xZzaHeMyMcqf66GAC4wA,"I would give a 2 rating at best, in the summer of 2001 I moved to Las Vegas from Southern California and the then Holiday Inn Boardwalk Casino was my first job as a security guard however it was a hired contractor job as additional security through Worldwide Security Associates to patrol the outside exterior of the hotel and casino, I would say my experience there I guess it was pretty much bitter sweet, 95 percent of the people that worked there wasn't the nicest people in the world, I liked and respected Melvin Parker who was the Graveyard Supervisor, Bill Diter was a complete idiot, Nick Baschek who was head of Security was alright and pretty cool, Purple Reign was very entertaining Trent Carlini was pretty talented as the dream King as a tribute to Elvis Presley, the coolest Security Officer there that was pretty cool and pretty likable and respected by everyone was Billy Clay, Mike Metcalfe was an as*hole and bully, and good percent of the workers there durning my time there in 2001 & 2002 had no personality and were bullies every other song throughout the casino was reminiscing from The Little River Band and the Culture Club I'll tumble 4 ya, I was saying that my time at the Boardwalk Casino and again my time was pretty much bitter sweet, when the place imploded on May 9, 2006, I was happy to see a bad memory being taken to the ground however I felt bad for the few friends I had there to lose their job due to the implosion of the place however I noticed in my review I do have mixed emotions of the place. That place had 40 Years of history there on the strip of Las Vegas, I regret that I should have made it a better experience for being and the people around me and then again I don't know however it wasn't the best time of my life working there.",VZeRq0UroKCOpycB76dMFw,1,1,2,-H8y-bNvIfiTuri_1cwpew
4340337,2018-02-25,0,S-xZzaHeMyMcqf66GAC4wA,"Low table limits, cheap hotel and an inedible 24 hour buffet - whats not to love? Budget friendly and center strip - something that no longer exists these days... those were the good old days.

This Coney Island themed hotel/casino wasn't as disappointing as learning of how the wooden roller coaster up front was just for show - a total fake merely to jazz up the facade along with the scary looking larger than life clown front and center. The low black jack table limits were really something to write home to Sacramento about. They also handed out large 1/2 liter water bottles to patrons in the casino. They really cared about my hydration - I liked that.

The hotel was cheap and had a vintage comfortable feel to it. It was an old Holiday Inn of moderate size purchased by MGM. Rooms and pool were clean enough for a 20 something year old and the gold flecks in the bathroom sink counter tops memorable and looked like they were from the 70s --  although they couldn't have been as the tower was built in 1996. 

A 24 hour buffet I only worked up the courage to go to once as we knew it was our last chance before the implosion. It was New Years Eve 2005 at about 10pm. We left fairly quickly to get to the festivities of the evening and it took maybe another 30 minutes for me to feel violently ill from the food. Eating here - a big gamble.

It closed just a week or so later in '06 to make way for sterile City Center. I suppose for much of the mid 2000s my home might have been by the bay but did all sorts of living here.",wuT2zH7Atq-98BirpB-8Aw,3,3,4,NOluMSYf-lPxxPipxhBvNQ

What I liked was looking at the fake fair on the front of the hotel with the fake roller coaster in the front and I thought it was real and wondered why I never saw it being used and the ferris wheel was fake too! 

All in all it was a nice looking sub par hotel on the Las Vegas strip that lived up to it's glory with the land put to better use with the construction of City Center with the Mandarin Tower located right where the Boardwalk Hotel use to be.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,10,11,2,I6oRgPCFCIeTvFqsQ5GX_Q

They had a deli here that was great served fried shrimp chicken and fries for like 6 7 dollars it was insane. When i first started coming to vegas when i was 21 i would always stay here. I loved it.
