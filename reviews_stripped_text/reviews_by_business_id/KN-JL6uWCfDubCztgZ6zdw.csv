142211,2016-04-19,0,KN-JL6uWCfDubCztgZ6zdw,"My co-worker and I were looking for a new luncheon place.  What a find!  The eatery is small, but quaint.  It is definitely a casual place. You order food at the counter, and staff delivers it to your table.  The tables are painted doors with an acrylic poured top, and you sit on medium height stools.

The menu is small, but has sufficient selections to fit most eaters.  We both ordered the catfish po-boys.  A combo comes with a side and drink.  Once again, we both ordered onion straws.  The po-boy comes wrapped in a foil wrapper, with a paper dish of straws and ranch.

The catfish was nicely cooked --flaky with a light cornmeal dusting.  No grease detected!  The mayo is a tad spicy, and there is lettuce and tomato to top off the sandwich.  It comes on a light, flaky, fresh bagette type roll.  It is rather large, but so tasty you decide to throw caution and calories to the wind and eat it all!  The onion straws are like getting them at any other place, although they added extra allure to the sandwich!  I encourage you to stick then under the bread.

The staff was great.  The greeter/order taker was pleasant, and checked on us at to satisfaction and drink refills.  On the way out, the owner thanked us for checking out his restaurant.  

I have no complaints, and I recommend this place.  Next week, I can't wait to try the ""dirty"" po-boy, which is shaved roast beef cooked on site.

Check this place out if you are up for a super casual eatery in downtown LV!",jU_e9Psd4mOIasHfMnieGQ,0,0,5,wT4p2zlf298CKewfkcth3Q

We sampled the Cajun Turkey and a Fried Shrimp Po-Boy with Cajun Fried and Onion Rings. 

Beer, Hard Cider, Frozen Daiquiris were on the menu, but we stuck to soft drinks. 

Service was good. It's counter service, but they deliver to the table when the order is up. 

The sandwiches were really tasty--taken ""up a notch"" with the jalapeño mayo. The turkey was cut in a generous slab and was juicy. The shrimp was good, not overly generous but not stingy either. 

The fries were shoestring, hot, and perfectly seasoned. The onion rings probably came out of the fryer first, so the temperature just missed, but the flavor was good (I couldn't stop picking at them).

The restaurant is new, clean, and unique. We really enjoyed it. The total check for three sandwiches, three drinks, one fry/one ring was just under $50+ tip, which we thought was fair. 

They just miss a fifth star for the rings, shrimp portion, and the fact that we were the only people there (which could really go either way...) Give them a try!",lBYFC_jp2xcB1NDsFvlENA,0,0,4,25QEj0VNvWSTLAxmc3QjHw

First sandwich I order was the zydeco special.  To be honest the whole sandwich was dry.  The turkey meat was dry, brisket had no flavor the mayo and mustard helped a little but did not make up for the sandwich.

Second sandwich was the turkey cajun.. overall the sandwich did not taste good at all. Very very dry

Third sandwich was zydeco special but I ask them to add fried shrimp.  Cost an additional 6.00 wow.  The shrimp did not have any flavor at all.

Lastly the gumbo.  I have to say this is the first time ever I had gumbo that was very dissapointing. I only took 3 spoonful and had to throw away the rest.  The broth was bland... yes I said broth it did not have any gumbo type consistency.  The sausage and chicken had no flavor.  Overall the gumbo was HORRIBLE.

I might give this place a second chance but it will take a lot of convincing in order for me to go back.",1nRrG_lljNgYbGGp7ebdYQ,2,0,1,v6vtFxA0KSZvZtq8BWCkBQ

I'm from Mobile, Alabama, so I'm familiar with authentic Gulf Coast seafood cooking. This is true Gulf Coast seafood cooking.
I picked the fried shrimp po boy. It was greatly dressed with just the right amount of messiness. 
The bread was the perfect type of bread that you want for a po boy. It was the perfect blend of hard and soft.
The shrimp were fried perfectly. However, I'd prefer a little lighter hand on the spice. It definitely opened my nostrils.
Also, had I known that the onion rings were actually onion strings, then I would have picked French fries or potato chips. The menu reads ""onion rings."" 
This should be changed to make it clear to the customer.

I asked for a recommendation on which Po-Boy to get, and I was not disappointed with the flavors in the least. Plus I think I got my money's worth ($28 with a tip) for getting the meals my boyfriend and I ordered, especially as combos. 
Let's see... I ordered the Debris Po-Boy with Cajun Fries and an Angry Orchard, and the boyfriend ordered a Ham Po-Boy with Cajun Onion Rings and a regular soda. 
I have to admit that I liked the Cajun Onion Rings better 'cause they were sliced super thin and weren't overly battered.

The catfish basket came with Cajun fries and was $9.75 plus tax. It was seasoned very well to had plenty of taste. 

The restaurant is very clean, the staff is very friendly. It's new and it's got that cool, trendy, hipster feel.

Zydeco Po-Boy is a fairly new spot added to the food frenzy that is Downtown Las Vegas. This place has the look and vibe of eating on the bayou, well I'm just assuming this because all I really know about the ""bayou"" I learned from, ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"". 

The menu is filled with all sorts of Southern dishes; two types of gumbo (sausage and vegan) seven types of po-boys, and of course red beans and rice. Right as I walked in, the smell was intoxicating, I'm pretty sure a fresh batch of fried something had just come out and hooked me. I went with Fried Shrimp Po-boy with a side of Cajun Fries.

The sandwich was a little on the small size, but along with the fries it was the perfect lunch. The fried shrimp were plump and crispy, but I could have used a few more on the sandwich. The bread was ridiculous, super soft with a slight crunch that and seemed to almost melt in your mouth. I did some research and found out that this bread comes straight from a New Orleans based bakery that's been in business for over a 100-years and I can see why. The sandwich was loaded with flavor and is definitely worth trying on first trip here. 

The Cajun fries were good and had a slight spice, but I still covered them in hot sauce. Next time Dirty Cajun Fries are in my future. Zydeco offers great service and a welcoming place to hang and eat some of the Bayou's best!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,17,14,4,cTnlpBg-aQv7qiaUf-vzzA

The food was really great, especially the po boys. We got beef and the meat was seasoned really well and the portions were plenty. I spent a few years in the gulf area and have been to Louisiana and this food tasted really authentic. The drink was tasty and strong. It wasn't too syrupy and definitely a nice touch to have those on tap. There is also a wall full of different types of hot sauces for you to try. 

Towards the end of the meal, my husband decided to pop in next door for a haircut and I finished my meal and drink alone. The owner struck up a conversation. He was incredibly nice and approachable. We chatted about where we were from and our favorite local restaurants. He told me about his past experience as a chef in other restaurants and about how he was actually from Louisiana. He even made a few recommendations of other local places to try.

The food here is delicious and affordable, the location is central and the owner is really kind and community oriented. Definitely think about supporting this local small business. We need more places like this to stick around!

Zydeco was good but room for improvement 
Agree with reviews of the place and chefs charm, also that pricing and portions are substandard for Vegas however that seems to be another DTP restaurant thing? I had turkey sandwich and found it pretty bland except for the mustard which wasn't Cajun as expected rather typical spicy brown. My bread was good.
What blew me away in flavor was the vegan gumbo I sampled and the full order of beans with sausage and rice. Hope they decide to expand on their beans to include vegan too.

We each ordered a po-boy planning to split and share so we could taste more than one kind.  I chose the cajun sausage and my friend chose the fried shrimp.  The woman taking our order wanted to know if we wanted that as a combo which gets you onion rings, fries, or potato salad and a drink.  We chose the combo for the extra value rather than ordering the items separately.

We took our drinks to the room adjoining the ordering area and waited for the po-boys.  It wasn't long before a server brought the sandwiches to us.

I liked both but my favorite was the cajun sausage.  It had some heat to it.  The shrimp was OK but they were small fried shrimp with a bit of cajun like flavoring on them.  The fries and onion rings are OK.  The standout here is the bread.  It's Leidenheimer's bread and it makes the sandwich.  Without it, the sandwiches would be less than OK.

Zydeco is an OK place if you're in DTLV but it's not a place I'd go out of my way to get a sandwich.  There are other better choices albeit they won't be po=boys.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,12,9,3,Pa_jp4ygFmcx20IOVP-6MA

4530002,2015-09-10,3,KN-JL6uWCfDubCztgZ6zdw,"Experience:  Came with a group of friends to try this place out. I've been holding off to go with my friends, but being a Louisiana gal, I was itching to try this spot since it first opened. It was 6pm on a Thursday. 

Facility: This place is pretty small. It has about 12 seats in the front room where you order, and maybe 12 more in the second room. It has some cool Louisiana decor, including the colleges' banners and even some of the interstate signs. They even have a Tabasco plant right on the counter. Brought me right back home. And I LOVE they put purse hooks under every seat! 

Service:  When you enter, you order from the counter, and then they bring it out. Since I was a bit early, I was asking a lot of questions, and Brandon the chef/owner came out and talked to me. He was super friendly and you can tell he takes pride in what he does. He had me taste a few things and talked to me about his journey to this particular restaurant. What a nice guy!!!

Food: There was so much I wanted to try, I was thankful one of my friends decided to order with me and split stuff so we could taste more. 
My standout favorites was the: 
Catfish Poboy - 5/5 - which was crispy and moist inside, which a nice flavor on the batter. 
Onion Straws - 5/5 - they were thin, slightly sweet and salty, and fried to perfection. 
The other things we tried...
The Chef had me try some of the Vegetarian gumbo (4.5/5) and I was surprised how much flavor it had. Not sure that it tasted like a traditional gumbo, but it was a damn good soup. 
Regular Gumbo - 3.5/5 - it was good, lots of meat and veggies, but I'm used to a gumbo with a darker roux. 
He is from an area Southwest in Louisiana, so he admitted the flavors are a little different from some of the New Orleans flavors. 
Sausage Poboy- 2.5/5 - unfortunately the sausage was overcooked and very dry. The flavor was good.  The chef makes this andouille from scratch. 
Dirty Fries - 3/5 - so these were covered in cheese and sausage. They were good, but the sausage was overdone again. 
Potato salad - 2/5 - I did not care for this much. Not saying it's not good, but I'm a southern, eggs, mayo, relish, etc kinda potato salad girl. This has a heavy brown mustard flavor. Just not my thing. 

Overall: I will come back to get a catfish Poboy and some Onion straws!  They were Yum!  Definitely the best catfish I've had in Vegas so far.  Plus I like being around Louisiana folks!  LOL!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,7,5,4,EYOyPHPz5elcZQ_c9pTX9g

It's just super cool to see all the detail that was put into every inch of the restaurant, including the food!

I ordered the shrimp po-boy, and fiance ordered the Zydeco special. We also got a small order of dirty cajun fries.  My po-boy had an abundance of golden fried lightly breaded shrimp with just a hint of spice. The bread had a nice crispiness to the outside and tasted so fresh.  It was like heaven in my mouth with every bite. The Zydeco special was almost as delicious. The combination of ham, turkey and brisket with the delicious jalapeno mayo was amazing.  The fries are skinny cut (similar to Mickie D's) and come smothered in cajun sausage, carmelized onion and cheese. I mean, need I see more?! You would also expect that maybe they would get soggy under all of that, but they were stayed fresh, hot and crisp. The size small is also not so small. We couldn't finish it because we were so stuffed.

I could eat here every day if I was closer to downtown (I'd also probably have to work out a whole lot more).

Nicely done, Zydeco people!",nQGDJ-dNftwTxhfvHLifqQ,1,1,5,4B_scxOJvK77qQlh0OBGRg

These sandwiches are all bread sprinkled with a small amount of meat. And I mean VERY little meat. 

I had the $12.50 shrimp po-boy with a few sad and lonely shrimp. Where are their shrimp friends!!! :(  Seriously though - not coming back here.

You can go across the street to the restaurant called E.A.T. and their shrimp Po-boy is HUGE!",OR2BeDONtz6FzscBwLVQsw,5,2,1,iRojYDwf5MVoWCo1lxTFJA

The inside of the restaurant is clean and inviting, and the prices are reasonable ($10 lunch special - drink+side+sandwich). More review to come after a second visit :-)",bIw2bHKYXokpA0jsqtKetA,1,1,5,lKNt73PFgM3ZqCFOsFdCXw

The sandwiches did have good flavor, we had the shrimp and the brisket, but the sliver of tomatoes they put on the sandwich and the tiny bit of lettuce was to light for my taste. The gumbo was good but not my favorite. Onions ""rings"" weren't rings at all but onions strings. Service was good and prompt. Cashier was nice and friendly. Place he really cute decor.",Y5Hl2fhl4OKvIckphulpEg,0,0,4,qIZQVnvDh8gw3gGWDD5KOA

Well done, Zydeco",nEbY9XOX5wZ3jRB_4BEyRQ,0,0,5,IRoXNgh6ir6JL8d-BuobEA
