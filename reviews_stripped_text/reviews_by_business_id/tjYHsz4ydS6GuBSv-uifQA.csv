We only ordered sashimi and one dish from the kitchen, hamachi no kama (yellowtail collar) which was amazing. My friend devoured the sashimi, saying it melted in her mouth (good sign) The fish WAS fresh, but something didn't sit right with me... I think it was the cuts --the hamachi was way too thick and HUGE!! I'm used to smaller pieces (from my experience, the sushi chefs cut them in reasonable pieces without disturbing the fish) The chef serviced our order of mirugai (giant clam). Priced it way under the M/P and piled a clam MOUNTAIN on the plate. Extremely kind, but it was too much for me.

I gave it four stars because everyone around me seemed to be enjoying their food (mostly Japanese) and it was constantly packed (the bar) As we were leaving, they all screamed ""mata ashita!"" --see you tomorrow!, which left me with a  really good feeling =D",Xmfi1Ewy0c1vbu4oslOgbA,5,5,4,BbjyMNrLEdsuQ5xU44Vxjg

I let them know that my party is all there and we are here for our 8:30 reservation.  They tell me to wait a few minutes while they prepare our table.  15 minutes passes and I go up to them again and say ""So whats the status of my table"" and with a very puzzled look in their faces they say to me ""Well you you're party was not here on time so we gave your table away.""  I was furious! They obviously forgot about us and mistakenly gave our table to someone else.  Finally after arguing with them they said that would be able to seat us in an our.  At this point I was beyond furious.  We were forced to go elsewhere for dinner and wait in line.  As a result we also missed our show for which we had already bought tickets.  What a disaster.

We walked up around 8:00 pm & had no problem getting a table. They have a sushi bar, teppan tables, and regular tables. We opted for the regular table since I was gonna go out & enjoy those money-sucking machines.

We sat down & ordered our drinks. We took quite some time looking over the menu since some people wanted sushi & others wanted entrees. We were never rushed, which was very nice. Some of my family ordered the sushi & even though I've said ""I'm so over sushi"" I could not help but try a piece or two. OMG, it was SO fresh & SO tasty. I guess ""I'm so over CHEAP sushi"".

I ordered chicken teriyaki & it was very good. It had a very grilled taste to it & was topped with a salty, semi-sweet teriyaki sauce. I really liked it. Ryan had the beef teriyaki, which was by far the most delicious entree on our table & I definitely stole a bite...or half of it.

- Atmosphere: First off, your in Vegas. So all places look legit.

1709314,2009-09-07,0,tjYHsz4ydS6GuBSv-uifQA,"Located inside Caesars Palace, Hyakumi has teppan tables (large, flat cooking surfaces so the chefs can prepare your food right in front of you; basically Benihana).  We opted for the teppan table.  They have regular tables as well that feature hot dishes and sushi.  Unlike Benihana, Hyakumi has a wide variety of teppan tables (for groups both small and large).  The decor is touristy Japanese--like something you would see at Disney World.

It is a little on the pricey side (though in Las Vegas, there are a lot of places much more expensive), but they do have specials where you do get a lot of food for your money.  The special I got came with soup (meh), fried rice (not bad but kind of bland), and stir fried vegetables (the worst part of the meal; all you could really taste was the bean sprouts).

The main entree was filet mignon and lobster.  The quality of the meat and the lobster was actually quite good.  The problem was that it was just kind of on the bland side.  The chef also didn't get a good color on the meat.  It was kind of gray--boiled instead of seared.  Maybe the teppan surface was not hot enough.  For dessert, the flavor of the coffee ice cream was too strong.

Hyakumi has choices other than teppan--maybe those are better.  But for teppan, it is a little below average for the price you pay.  You may be better off with Benihana (while they use significantly lower quality ingredients, it does taste better).",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,0,0,2,Ez2w5EoquckNPo_A9Z-0Lg

Their sukiyaki was lame.  The base sauce was too salty again and their beef was either chunks of flank steak or a tough tenderloin.  Cheap beef cuts when sukiyaki is traditionally thinly sliced beef (preferably sirloin) is strike three.

The price-tag is a bit disheartening if you decide to order the Toro (Tuna Belly) but other than that, it is pretty manageable if you like sashimi and you do not need a lot to fill your hungry belly. 

I am quite a hefty eater but found that the pieces were quite filling. 

For the sashimi, we had the toro, yellowtail, tuna, salmon, sea urchin, orange fish eggs (I never learned the proper term), octopus, and albacore. I loved the toro even though it was $50 for 3 pieces, the octopus, and yellow tail. I never really had sea urchin and had no idea what it was when I put it in my mouth so the sliminess really took me by surprise. 

I think our party overdid the fish though because I don't think I will be eating sushi anytime soon.

They only have the basic rolls here.  What they do make is very, very good.  I wish they had their own special creations.  I wasn't disappointed with the basic stuff though.

It is a little on the pricey side.  But I've paid almost as much at good sushi places in So Cal.  Considering where this place is at, you're paying for some very fresh and very good sushi.

How dare we have the Audacity to show up at his high-caliber dining establishment without making a reservation ahead of time?? Excuse me good sir, but your restaurant is currently quite empty, and as fancy as you may think this place is, there is a HUGE 70s-music-blaring BOAT parked just 30 feet away that thinks otherwise. (Yes, Cleopatra's Barge *actually* detracts from the ""elegance"" that Hyakumi seems to strive for).

The retardedly overpriced menu (nigiri starts at $7) suggests that you're about to embark on some amazing gastronomic adventure, but in reality everything we ordered ranked from mediocre to crap:

-Side salad: The most uninspired collection of leaves you've seen, drizzled in blander-than-store-bought vinaigrette. This is a Japanese restaurant! They're not supposed to serve crappy vinaigrette! Where's the miso dressing? Or any of the other yummy dressings you find at Any Other Japanase Restaurant??
-Salmon nigiri: One of the most basic nigiri you can order anywhere, and theirs was CHEWY!! For folks just tuning in, I repeat: the salmon was fucking CHEWY!! When the fuck was the last time any of you had CHEWY raw salmon?? Grrroosssss!!
-Sushi rolls: Every single one was mostly rice with a little bit of fish in the middle, kind of reminiscent of that ""dollar sushi"" joint back in college. You know, the one whose rolls gave you that ""well, I'm getting stiffed on the quality but you get what you pay for"" type of feeling? Yeah, Hyakumi's rolls are like that. Except instead of a dollar they're more than $10.
-Udon soup: So bad my friend couldn't even finish his. 
-Beef sukiyaki: Decent, probably the best thing on our table.

Super fed-up and ready to leave, it was time to flag down our waitress for the check. Uhhh but wait, where is she? 15 minutes go by. Fine, maybe she has the runs and is in the middle of violently evacuating the contents of her bowels and is in desperate need of a bidet and maybe some Purell. Whatever, I'll flag down that other waitress. But as I catch her eye, she turns and RUNS AWAY!! Hooooleeeeeey fuckk!!

The restaurant is very ""Karate Kid"" looking to me, as if you're in a movie set version of a Japanese restaurant.

My dad is a Seven Stars member of the Harrah's group, so he get's comped at this restaurant or any restaurant in Ceasars, Paris, etc..  That said, we've never had to pay for a meal here.  But even so, I don't think that this place is worth it.  We've ordered the Toro here many times ($50 for 3 pieces of sashimi) and its very inconsistent.  There are times where the Toro comes out with the fat well marbleized where other times there isn't any fat at all.  What gives?  If they're charging $50 for 3 pieces of Toro you would think that it would be consistent.

We also ordered the Kobe beef which was $198.  If I was paying I'd be upset.  Like Toro, when I order Kobe beef I expect the fat to be consistent around the whole piece of steak.  Here we had chunks of fat next to lean pieces of meat.  Isn't that just regular steak?

Everything here in general is pretty overpriced for what you get.  If you're getting comp'd then maybe you should try it out, but if you have to pay money out of your own pocket you might want to look elsewhere.

There are a few good items at this restaurant that I'd like to point out:

Seafood udon - for $20, its a pretty good amount of food.
Sea Urchin - delicious
Yellowtail and Tuna sashimi - very fresh and consistent",3ptlK2IzUVoZYnYiIfs_9w,4,0,2,ioe3Png99jeMbnF4MJD8JA
3557268,2011-07-08,0,tjYHsz4ydS6GuBSv-uifQA,"I actually had to see how the laundry turned out before writing this review... more on that later.

We had eaten here years previously, when it was awesome and known as the ""Ah-So Steakhouse"" and also a few times under the Hyakumi name.  Honestly, the quality has continuously deteriorated over the years, but it has always been 'pretty good' and they have a niche.  They are the only teppanyaki type place (I know of) that has private tables where you can have a nice dinner, prepared teppan style, and not have to sit with a bunch of sake swilling yokels from Tennessee.

Anyhow, we decided to give it another shot on this trip to Vegas, and that was an unfortunate decision.  

First the food-- It was again ""decent"".  But it was strange.  Our starters of Miso Soup and the crab salad with cucumbers were excellent and the same as we have had before.  The chef then arrived and in a matter of 5 minutes cooked EVERYTHING else.  The ""appetizer"" shrimp were cooked at the same time as our lobster entree.  The three shrimp each were not cut into little pieces like usual, but instead just lopped onto our plates.  My dad tried his and said LOUDLY (since its my Dad) ""these are really rubbery"" to which the chef smiled.  We each ate our three shrimp but they were rubbery and not very good.  The chef again asked ""how are the shrimp?""  My Dad said ""rubbery"" and he must have thought that was a compliment because he just smiled.

The lobster, steak and a mix of mushrooms, zucchini and onions very quickly followed and poof, he was gone.

When we arrived we were seated at the teppan private table, but I had barely sat down when the hostess asked if we would mind moving to one of the 'group' tables.  We refused since we prefer the privacy, had asked for it and been seated there.  We theorized that because of this, they bumped the other reservation ahead an hour and rushed us out.

It seemed like whole courses were skipped, we saw others getting sprouts and we never did.  Our dessert were these strange balls on the end of toothpicks instead of the standard ice cream.

AND, I save the worst for last.  The chefs always must entertain, and that is fine.  Even if its a Dad and a son and we've been there done that 100 times, I guess the old onion volcano thing never gets old.  Except this time, he did the volcano (which involves pouring some kind of oil inside stacked onion slices and lighting it) and his onion stack was unstable.  It collapsed and a bunch of hot grease came flying right at me.  Some hit my bare arm and stung, but no major burns.  Most of it just made grease drops on my nice polo shirt.  The chef seemed nonplussed and asked if I was OK.  I made a couple of comments about the grease stains on my shirt.  No response.  So at the end of the meal we mentioned it to the hostess who brought out the manager.  This gal could have done a lot of things, but did none of them.  She didn't offer anything except to bring in a security guard so we could file a report with risk management.  I don't even know what that means!!  They were worried about being sued maybe?  In any case, a classy place at least discounts the $59 each we paid to cover the dry cleaning for the shirt... it had many many visible grease droplets on it.  Her response was UNBELIEVABLE... and clinches that after many visits to this place, we will never return.",LyT-i6VcO0dIGmL_qGhkmQ,2,0,1,fV2MewUM081MmZtAOC2xEw

The rolls were admittedly oversized and tasty but they hurt... especially when I can get each roll for less than half the price at any neighborhood sushi bar in SF. Shame on Hyakumi!",_owMBYfzT9dO7FXGXXzXqA,7,5,3,d3N0TLPawqDZ2K7TCidUIw

The service was bad, I ended up waiting for a good 20 minutes for my seaweed salad (which doesn't take that long to make). The seaweed salad ended up being soggy :( 
 I asked for water from my server because I love eating tons of wasabi with my sushi but she didn't bring it to me, and I had to flag down some other waitress 20 minutes later. The alcohol was costly for not being in a bar, but again this is probably just because of the location. 
The food itself was not great. The quality of sushi I had at this place is decent, yet for that price I expected more. My guess is that this place is in Las Vegas on the Strip and in Caesar's Palace so they justify their increased cost because of it. The rice to stuffing ratio in the sushi was too high. The cuts were also uneven and I got the impression that because it was close to closing time the chef was too tired to pay attention to detail. The beef teriyaki was chewy and dry, but the sauce was very tasty so that makes up for it.

Being a fan of teppan cooking there was no choice as to what part of the restaurant I would dine in.  Upon arrival I asked how long the wait would be without reservations as the last time I ate there they were pretty much mandatory.  I was informed they would seat me right away as there was nobody else coming soon to seat me with.  I must not wear the proper cologne or something as the last 4 times in a row I ended up at a teppan table by myself and part of the experience is the meeting of strangers.  They sat me at a table for 2 which is something I had never seen before in a teppan restaurant.  It would be really cool for an impressive date.  This was a Monday night of a 3 day weekend and it was really dead in there.  My chef, one of 3 I could see on duty, said that most week nights they do a lot of standing around waiting for a table to cook for.

I chose one of their Prix fixe dinners.  First was a bowl of miso soup (chicken soup optional), followed by a cucumber salad with crab meat.  The main course included shrimp, beef tenderloin, a chicken breast and vegetables.  Dessert was ice cream inside of some sort of rice cake, different texture and not too sweet.  The only item I didn't think was prepared to my liking was the fried rice which I thought a bit dry, almost crunchy.  The cost of this meal was $49 plus $6 to upgrade the white rice to fried rice which turned out to be a poor option choice.  I had a glass of Asahi  draft for $10.  For Vegas this was reasonably priced.

The service was excellent up to a point.  That point was when a party of 40 or so showed up and the restaurant went from being a little overstaffed to way understaffed.  As I was eating I noticed a flurry on the other side of the room as water glasses were being filled from water bottles and shortly thereafter the large party started arriving.  Normally I am sure they would not seat that many tables all at the same time with only 3 chefs so I hope they were all in a chatty mood as the last few tables were going to be a while before they saw a chef.  In that rush I sort of got forgotten, it took a while for my plate to be picked up and for the bill to come and another while before the bill got picked up and another wait for my change.  Waiting is sort of a funny thing, it gets blown out of proportion when you are by yourself, which I was. All of the waits I mentioned probably only added 10-15 minutes total to my dining experience and if I was with someone would have been almost unnoticeable..",Z128ihQea7BLPh2T9q9sKA,0,0,4,lSlfhUVUG2azLmq2Jt-JDg

--natto roll. you bet they have it. cut roll had no juicy strings. (that means he stirred it exactly the correct number of times)

My usual but quick scan of the display showed that Tuna was the fish to order today. I was not disappointed.

Normally given the choice, I'll choose the seat in front of the senior chef. Today, the gods were with me and my instinct to choose his junior chef was well rewarded.


I say _INSIST on Eugene_ because from what experienced the next day from the senior chef, I wouldn't even be writing this review. He's just lost his passion. ...

# rice falls apart with every nigiri as i pick it up. i mean even before it even makes it to my soy sauce -- and i'm no noob (newbie)
---
Note: you cannot hand back a dish of nigiri to the senior chef in front of him and his junior chefs. If you do, you must immediately leave the restaurant. Instead you just have to stumble through every piece, hoping that they're noticing that every piece is crumbling. You got it, I stumbled through every last $7 piece. (hana oh hana, i can't wait to get home) And you got it again, no one took notice, and no one apologized, nothing.
What an humiliating spectacle!

# all-you-can-eat-two-bites-per-piece is appreciated at $12-14 for two pieces, but I want the masterful technique from yesterday.
it ends up being sashimi with a pick-up-pile of rice now busted and all over my plate (see above)
# rolls thrown together, not even packed. no care. what a disappointment.

The rules are as follows.

$28 ... it's all-you-can-eat. You get one hour. If you order from the top-tier ... add $10. You can order two rolls and 1 appetizer and 2 pieces of sushi at a time. No teams (no sharing). 

Um, at first - the fat girl inside couldn't contemplate applying these rules... because all you/I could hear was ""all-you-can-eat."" But once in, everything was fresh. The miso soup was packed with flavor and the gyoza was really good. I think the waiter was mad, because we were constantly breaking the rules... but whatever.

*I would suggest making a reservation on the weekend if you plan on dining here.

Food: 
We both ordered the steak and lobster dinner combo for $69. 
It came with Miso or Chicken Soup which were both decent but nothing special. 
We didn't eat the cucumber salad because it was soggy and salty.
The shrimp was good but needed extra lemon and butter flavoring.
The steak was marinated and cooked perfectly. Great cut of meat with minimal fat and juicy flavor.
The lobster was decent but again needed extra butter and lemon.
The rice was good but they charge an extra $6 for fried rice.
Not sure how the ice cream was since our waitress never offered it to us.

Drink: 
I had a martini with midori and cucumbers in it (forgot the name). It was perfectly mixed and delicious!

Overall the food and drink receives 3.5 stars with the steak being the highlight of the meal.

Service: 
The hostess was pleasant and greeted us promptly with a smile.
Our chef was okay but he didn't do many of the show tricks. We saw alot of the other tables around us getting elaborate fire and volcano shows but our chef must of been new or having a bad day?
Our waitress started off good with a pleasant greeting, but then it went down hill fast. We had to request water refills twice from another waitresses. After the chef finished cooking our food we never saw our waitress again. I'm going to guess she went on break because after completing our meals and waiting 20 minutes I finally flagged our helpful water waitress down and she had our bill. I've worked in fine dining and whenever you leave for break you take 2 minutes and tell your tables and explain that ______ will now be assisting you. She didn't do this or offer us our desert that came with our dinner combo. 
After our waitress returned to the floor she never returned to thank us and ignored our existence entirely.

5400561,2011-10-22,0,tjYHsz4ydS6GuBSv-uifQA,"We spent a few days in Las Vegas with a group of friends and decided to go here to celebrate the birthdays of three people in our party, one of them being my boyfriend.

First, the prices. 

Half of us regretted going here upon looking at the menu to discover that it was about $60 per person, on average, just for the entree. The website we had looked at earlier showed $32 per person. $32 was for the ""a la carte"" which consisted of miso, steamed rice, and chicken, with a few veggies. The other options were for the appetizer, soup, salad, two meat choices, rice and veggies. Ordering fried rice here will cost extra. (unlike most other hibachi restaurants.) Sushi prices were average, and beers were VASTLY overpriced. (welcome to Las Vegas, hope you're prepared to pay three times as much for everything!) A small Sapporo was $8, and out here in Chicago a large is usually $7, to give you an idea of the price gouging. 

Second, the service. 
Service was okay, it wasn't terrible. I certainly wasn't blown away, nor was I angry enough to write a letter. Our server hardly spoke English and couldn't answer any questions we asked him. Since we had a large party of 9, they placed us at two tables that were pushed together. Resulting, we had two chefs. One of the chefs was in training, and i actually sat between the two tables (on a nice crack in the table) where i was able to see both chefs work. Neither did tricks, nor told jokes or talked much, they just cooked all the food at once, very quickly and departed when they were done. Part of the experience of going to a hibachi grill is to see a little flair and there was none to be had at Hyakumi. Oh, there was an onion volcano...but that's about as standard as airbags in a vehicle. 

Third, the food. 
Although most of our friends (who suggested the place) were enthralled at the supposed ""quality"" of the ingredients used, I and a few others were less than pleased. I ordered the ""organic chicken"" which could have very well been tofu, it was so dry and flavorless. It was cooked with no seasoning other than salt, butter and sesame seeds. The miso was good, so was the salad my boyfriend got with his entree. The salad was a very slim portion of sliced cucumber with a vinegrette and a few bits of crab meat. We also ordered sushi, spicy tuna, which i have to say was the most redeeming part of the meal. The outstanding sushi is the ONLY reason this place doesn't get a 1 out of 5. According to those that ordered steak, it was extremely tender and delicious. I didn't want to ""fork"" over $61 dollars to experience this for myself, so I only have their word to go on. The rice portion was extremely small. Normally, they fill the bowl and then level it off. This was a half-filled small bowl of rice. Also, the veggies were mostly onions with a few bits of mushrooms and zucchini, and the portion was also very small. Normally, at a Hibachi restaurant i can barely finish my food, but here i had absolutely no problem eating every morsel on my plate. Those that ordered the two-meat entree (the $61 dollar meal) received three pieces of  unseasoned shrimp as an appetizer and a green tea mochi dessert. I had a bite of my boyfriend's mochi, which tasted a little odd and doughy. 

I have had so much tastier teppanyaki at places that have offered larger portions at cheaper prices. If given a blind taste test, I certainly wouldn't rank this above any other hibachi restaurant. I also wouldn't recommend eating at a place like this in Las Vegas. These types of restaurants can be found anywhere, and on the strip all you're going to get is price gouged, so at least choose a restaurant that you couldn't go to unless you're IN Las Vegas.",lyXhYab9FikpcLwPVL4XWQ,1,0,2,eZUB3tpeKeAHzFdg8jd4jw

The restaurant abuts a busy corridor right next to the casino at Caesars, and the sushi bar is almost hanging over the edge. As a result, the atmosphere is hardly quiet and serene. Somehow or other, that doesn't me - it's just a different kind of experience.

Where Hyakumi shines is in its quality of sushi, and its quality of sushi chefs.  The sushi is fresh and flavorful, and the chefs are easy to talk to.

Perhaps because of its location, the customers seem to be a little more colorful than at other places. For example, there was the glassy eyed gentleman who had been gambling all day. He was very friendly, albeit a bit spacey. He let me know how much he loved sushi - although I'm not sure how he could tell. Instead of a regular sized saucer for soy, he had a little bowl, into which he mixed enough wasabi to choke a horse.

Hyakumi is very good, but is in a tough position. If I want top quality, I go to my favorite, Okada.  If I want a trendy place with quality sushi, I head to Sushi Roku, which is also located at Caesars (in the Forum Shops).",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,0,4,B67L3zHNPa_7_JF2UAo4Qw

did you all not try the toro? at $20 dollars a piece, it is like butter.

BUTTER. did you not hear me?? BUTT-ERRRRR.

an acquaintance of mine by the name of kobiyashi [one ballin' ass muhfucka'] said that this was his favorite spot to get sushi outside of japan.  can you imagine that?  and the way this guy ordered food, you could tell he knew what the fuck he was talking about.

i'm not joking when i tell you that he ordered something of a 7-course meal.  it was ridiculous.  i think it was the first time in my life i could say i ate like a king.  kobiyashi ordered a sushi dish [it was pretty okay], a $100 bottle of sake [smoothest sake i've ever had and it was cold, too], fish jaw [who knew that part of the fish could be so good?], a round of kirin, some sort of delicious tofu, mushroom concoction, and the toro.  

dear god, the toro.

somewhere in all of that, for some unknown reason, there was chicken teriyaki.  why? i don't know, but it was okay, i guess.

kobiyashi footed the entire bill to what i can imagine came out to be in the $400-$500 range.  ridiculous.

the service was quick and consistent [although they refused to talk to me], but that may have been because kobiyashi knew the sushi chef, who was pretty awesome in his own right.
