Located near Rancho and the 95, I was excited to try this place!  I ordered the full slab of ribs and the fried chicken dinner.  With it, I ordered the greens, yams, hush puppies, and macaroni & cheese.  Big Mama must've not been there, because she probably wouldn't have approved of the quality of the food put out that day.  The greens, yams, and macaroni & cheese were decent, the hush puppies were too salty, and the fried chicken was pretty tasty.  But the place is called ""Big Mama's Rib Shack"", not Big Mama's Chicken House.  The ribs were such a disappointment!  Not only were they teeth-ripping tough, they were obviously at least a day old and reheated (not very well).  My ribs were, at most, a warm 85 degrees...I'm sure the health department wouldn't approve.  

The fried chicken was actually very good, but does that warrant an extra star?  Hmmm...it's supposed to be a rib place, so I think not.",E7sk9jsImePqLT4roNgotg,5,2,1,eFeBn6py_HTIM5vRSdhRpg

Perhaps it was the spot a year prior but it's absolutely not anymore. I'm not sure what could happen so drastically in a year but this place needs to either close or make some major changes immediately before Big Mama starts turning in her grave. 

When we arrived there were absolutely no cars in the parking lot and no patrons inside. I reasoned that maybe business was slow at 3:00pm considering it's about 10 minutes off the strip and in the least glamorous part of town.

The windows are covered with neon writing advertising the specials, creatively mispelled in fact. There were several references to the restaurant being Creole. If this place is Creole, then I'm a talking monkey. This place is nothing but a one stop shop for mediocre food and a low budget strip club across the way, classic hood entertainment. 

The menu is a expansive with classic sides including fried okra, mac & cheese, collard green etc. and a variety of meats including pork, chicken, ox tails, links and sandwiches. 

We ordered fried chicken & mac n' cheese; BBQ sampler (white meat chicken, link, rib & fried okra). We ordered at the front counter, reminiscent of McDonald's and seated ourselves in the dining room after we found the only clean tables in the restaurant which strangely enough were the only two tables with tablecloths. There was one booth in fact that appeared to be used for sorting mail and the prepaid legal that was advertised on the menu. There was an entire dirty roadside, outdated, tacky theme that made me wonder what their letter would be if Nevada graded. Far from the down home momma's kitchen feeling that I anticipated. 

The mac & cheese was sophisticated Velveeta, the BBQ was baked chicken well seasoned with liquid smoke and smothered with tasty sauce..the okra and the fried chicken were actually on point and I had no complaints. My #1 criticism, don't advertise baked chicken as BBQ EVER..I was insulted! 

Last but not least, the restroom tsk tsk.., a dungeon with minimal light....perhaps that was intentional.",_DOErKav2MLE76zXyrBmWQ,2,0,2,XVtRfoxt4-BT2S5xt1UwZg
2795248,2007-10-03,1,InDH4ZQ_byiQ5PyaqgHI8Q,Big Mama was tested by three true life southerners and one Chinese chick who loves soul food and unfortunately it was a failure. The fried chicken was drowning in oil and too salty. The day old cornbread weighed in like a brick. The ribs were nothing to shout home to and the collard greens needed a to be wrapped with a big slab of salted pork for any flavor. Come on folks! I'm the Chinese chick that can make better collards with her smoked turkey leg! And $16 dollars for Chitterlings?! They better be swimming in truffle oil for that price!,PO2da8MNz8gJ1443AaVgQA,2,0,1,cCGxIR8di9SeDaqvTAQdJA
4406670,2008-11-02,1,InDH4ZQ_byiQ5PyaqgHI8Q,"this has been reviewed by many as the best southern food stop in las vegas. i have been here dozens of times & even had them cater events for the company i work. mama's cookin is the best. the place may not look 5 stars, may not be in the best neighborhood for white yuppies to frequent, may not even look approachable from the outside but once you take that first bite. wham-zap-pow!!

i usually go for the chopped bbq pork sandwich ""the killer"" with cole slaw on it. or i do the hot links platter which is 2 or 3 links diced in a sauce with red beans & white rice.

the ribs are best in the summer when they have the outdoor smokers going and are catering alot of events,etc. the cornbread is insane-truly one of a kind. i stop by every now & then grab a ""killer"",red beans & rice and a drink for less than $10!!

if you are looking for home cooking done right-big mama's is the place.

Its a family run place so service is pretty casual and it is never very busy",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,2,2,4,cD6pc4zbVjDijiqxSLeLMw

My assumption is that Big Mama is no long involved in the food prep process, and someone with less caring and love is now in charge.  Everything from the ribs to the sides to the sweet potato pie were disappointing to say the least.  I wish I had gotten to try the food when Big Mama was still doing the cooking.  I'm sure it was good then.",-gi3QTLxpER5LqqPXYEsMw,0,0,1,3hbXOAGAMIWA2L3rQ8d4uw
