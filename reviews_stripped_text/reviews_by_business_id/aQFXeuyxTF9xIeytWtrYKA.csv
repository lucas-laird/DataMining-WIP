However the Root Beer was the star and it was very good./ The place was cold as they were running the fans at night when they didn't need them.. I do remember a different time when A&W was much better.",o94O3WM5YALHda4Mxo91Bw,0,0,3,yFkYg3HdsG_Unz6MSpODhQ

Yes, there is a wait, everything is cooked to order!

2454710,2012-08-25,0,aQFXeuyxTF9xIeytWtrYKA,"Extremely long wait times in the drive through, with cement blockers so you can't drive away, smart for them, frustrating for the 10-15 minute wait in line behind people. Then you get your food, Warm at best, poor quality, and for me usually wrong with mayo on it that I asked not to be. 
Inside of the restaurant you are called out by number, when they first opened it was a number an a rhyme, 109 your order looks Devine, things like that. That has ceased, and you have mediocre food waiting for you at the counter, that also takes a while to get to you. 
They're attached to a long johns silvers which to me, gets the same rating, dry, bad food.",E2TO40ByT-ejdPPNxvNnFQ,3,0,1,3ZZnsUh5rt5OkJHlYr9UiA
3066951,2014-07-24,0,aQFXeuyxTF9xIeytWtrYKA,"Horrible, horrible. I ordered take out and got home. We began to eat our food and realized the burgers were nit cooked correctly, so I opened the entire burger and the other side was chewy and hard...Like when you reheat a day old OR more burger in the microwave. There were not many cars in the drive thru either and we waited over 20 minutes. I called to complain and even called the local office to tell them the horrible service and food this location had. I also advised him he should retrain the employees. I will NEVER again eat there and advise you to go to Jack in the Box instead.",Nid4TY_aKEUpvH42ymLFZA,1,0,1,2gRks_zd217s-oDcMFurDA
3094639,2015-07-20,0,aQFXeuyxTF9xIeytWtrYKA,"I would never order from the Long John Silver menu again. First and last time I did I couldn't tell the difference between the chicken and fish in my combo. Both just tasted like greasy batter. That said, I'm usually pretty  pleased with the A&W menu. Today my boyfriend and I each ordered a bacon burger. I posted pics of the sad things we received. I tried to call to address it and the phone rang until someone answered and immediately hung up. Not just poor delivery on the food but poor service as well. Doubt we'll be spending another dime there.",-Brk-g26480ZalFUH3BTpw,0,0,2,VIlc81l8RSPaOblyXET8fg

4142766,2013-04-18,1,aQFXeuyxTF9xIeytWtrYKA,"This is an ok place, but nothing special. You always have to wait a long time both inside and in the drive thru, no matter what you order. The food is ok, but nothing special. This is a shared operation with Long John Silver's, so there is an expanded menu, which adds a little excitement. The highlight of this place is the Root beer Floats and the only reason I visit from time to time.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,2,2,3,R3qmjf8PYwKM_ek2gFnseA
4396460,2015-02-28,0,aQFXeuyxTF9xIeytWtrYKA,"This place is shares a drive through and building with Long John Silvers. I ordered a burger, it came on a bun that was falling apart, one very small onion that didn't even cover 1/4th of the burger and overcooked bacon. The actual burger itself tasted alright. It saddens me when bacon gets treated that way.",WQGiKbfq2NFbc8jXCOnUng,0,0,2,v8PI3zXV-fLbUGCTA6jEbA
5018319,2015-05-03,0,aQFXeuyxTF9xIeytWtrYKA,"Every time I have been in here in the last year (4 or 5 times) the service has been awful. Just awful. Their employees really hate working here and really don't mind you knowing it. This marks the 4th time in a row we have been THE ONLY people in here and the 4th time in a row our meals have taken over 20 minutes. So to recap, awful service, bleh ""fast"" food that takes forever, not cheap. 

The restaurant condition is always rough as well. Sticky gross tables, condiment containers disgusting sticky and sauce bar with disgusting and moldy sauce. Manager who talks about innapropriate things within earshot of customers.

Skip it and go anywhere else, this will be our last try",IKLQx0GzJ2ITSz8rcVAc_w,0,0,1,cp-WaVCehpAZ8tVHkWkEfA

The employees were slow and looked like they were working a prison detail. While,I was eating, a handicapped female came in with her family and they waited so long at the register that another customer had to walk up to the counter and yell back for the cashier. I then needed a lid and a bag for the remainder of my meal so I waited 10 minutes at the counter as I watched the cashier finally walk up to the front, she was carrying ice cream containers to the freezer, put them in, and then walked right back to the back of the store after she looked right at me and didn't even care to ask me what I wanted. Forget it !!!! I left and will never be back. Jerks !!!",mrjrt6Smi_IRrOL7F-6hMw,2,0,1,AKIoaT8tKM_NvqLKdf2BPw

I would just like to point out no one was in line for the drive thru, yet I still had to wait five minutes to place my order. This place was dead and five minutes honestly? This lady made us wait for five minutes just for a order of cheese curds. Also the drive through speaker had old bird poop dripping down the sides! DISGUSTING! They stated that they sold all the cheese curds! We were appalled and it was the worst service! We are never going back! I DO NOT recommend A&W! -Stephanie",OMen5AqjS0EFtUmpqKAOaA,4,2,1,gniPPIUW1KYyEyjU23L50w
