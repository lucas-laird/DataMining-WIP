In my case I tend to compare all Thai restaurants with Keo's in Hawaii which is the first Thai food I had ever tried. Since moving to Las Vegas I've been searching for that same flavor. I've finally found it in this restaurant. Although no as elegant decor-wise, the service was really outstanding.
Personable and friendly staff helped to make a delicious meal even better. There is no pork on this menu either.
On the 1-5 scale, for me a 2 was just the right amount of heat. The flavors blended perfectly together and the price was more than reasonable. This is my new favorite Thai restaurant. I hope you try it and enjoy it as much as we did.",2160BZupNpVOhAk_8MTtbQ,1,0,4,YEe20i_SbFkplpNWMp9c-g

Ambience:  dirty, old and crusty, and ghetto.  And no antiquate AC! Are you kiddin me? This is Vegas, in the summer!   
Service:  horrible, slow, rude.  They are slow but they won't admit it. That's the problem here, we are in a hurry to catch a flight, but we had more than an hour so we figured that's plenty. Wrong. They took our order, and said no problem. Waited 30 minutes before we got water. And kept assuring us that it will be fine, food's coming. 50 minutes in... Hmm...

Basil Fried Rice - 5/5
Orange Chicken - 5/5
Mongolian Beef - 3/5

Yes 2 people ordered all that food. The Basil fried rice is a must here! Mongolian Beef was a little overcooked and dry but I still gave this place 5 stars because the owner and chef Sakina is super sweet. My only word of advice is to check water levels.

I never been too whatever the place was before but walking in could tell that definitely something different. It pretty decent size compare too the front entrance thinking too myself this place is tiny. The waiter she was fabulous greeted me warm welcome and since lunch not very packed she like pick anywhere too sit. The menu is fairly simple with most staple Thai dishes find at most other Thai restaurants. I wanted too try couple things so started with the gyoza but this one was all vegetables no pork in the filling. Interesting. The filling definitely not as hearty and maybe use too gyoza traditional sense only way with pork felt like filled with air. The dipping sauce was nice. The way they steamed then seared the gyoza was on point. Just not that much fan of the filling but think great option if vegan. My entree went with the Spicy Basil Fried Rice. Sakina spicy rating they go only from 1-5. So being first time not sure played it safe went with 2. I wish went higher because 2 felt like bland and thinking Spicy Basil Friend Rice no kick factor. I know next time go higher and for all spicy fans not sure where 5 is compare too other Thai restaurants go 1-10. I enjoyed the mixture of vegetables in the fried rice, the sauce that fried rice cooked in (my own fault should have went 3 or 4) solid, and fried rice could eat everyday. I plan on coming back trying more dishes. Overall honest nothing that can rave about or compare too my favorites Archi or Pan Asian. I only had two dishes.

2621934,2013-12-12,6,cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ,"This new Thai restaurant replaced the Mega Ramen restaurant that was there before, and I do believe this is an improvement!  The inside is much more open and finely decorated.  The service was experienced, nice, and attentive.  The server obviously cared what I thought about the food, which is always a good sign.  I ordered the fried calamari and the Pad Ga Pow (might be spelled differently on the menu) with beef.  Interestingly enough they do not serve pork here!  

The calamari was quite nice.  It came with about half tempura squid and half tempura veggies.  If you can forgive the veggies and don't mind eating a little healthier, I would recommend this dish.  The batter was very, very light perhaps one of the lightest I have had, but had enough flavor to keep it interesting.  They use the typical Thai style sweet and sour sauce, clear and pinkish red in color, not too sweet, and with light tasting chili flakes.  

The Ga Pow was very unique and surprising.  I haven't had this dish prepared in this style before.  The waitress informed me that it is more of a Southern style Thai restaurant.  The meat was very lean and finely minced.  At first I thought it was hamburger by the look, but I was definitely mistaken when I tasted it.  It was very light and almost fluffy.  No feeling of extra grease or fat.  The veggies (onions, bell peppers, etc) were well prepared and fresh tasting.  On top of jasmine rice, it was a very light version of the dish.  One thing to note here is that this place is quite a bit hotter than most Thai restaurants.  The waitress warned me that my 3/5 was VERY hot.  The spice level did not disappoint, and I quite enjoyed the heat level balanced with the lighter flavors.  The dish was not sweet at all, which deviates from the typical version of this dish you find in Vegas.  Very light on the palate and the stomach.  The one criticism I might have is that it also wasn't very complex (no or very little basil, mint, etc), but as simple as the flavors were they worked very well.  

I am very curious about the style of this Thai cooking.  I most certainly will be back to try some of the other dishes like the curries and noodle dishes.  Their motto is no sweetness, and I like that in a Thai restaurant.  Sakina is a fantastic and unique addition to the Thai food scene in Las Vegas, and in my opinion a must try for Thai food lovers!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,18,8,4,WK41Bzor8F7F12BO44HEkg

We went on a Tuesday night having yelped it and thought the portions would be small but for a family of 4 adults it was more than enough. I would literally cross the California/Nevada border just to go get some of this damn great flavorful food!

Great presentation, clean, nothing bad to say! Can't say roundhouse good things. Affordable! $8.95 per a la cart menu. $49 for family of 4",Hcsj6oq21yppQ6IqBlV8-Q,0,0,5,Yn5hiHOPh7tsYudmIoQKKA

3795036,2014-11-05,0,cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ,"Besides the plus this place is Halal and has no pork products ts on the menu..the food is EXCELLENT. Best Pad Thai I've ever had. I even ordered it with ground beef which is rare for me. They don't just use ground beef, they use high quality steak and ground it up IN- House with the halal beef. Even the noodles they use for the pad thai were a bit thinner than the traditional rice noodles. Flavors were decedent and perfectly measured. I ordered a 3 out of 5 for spice. Little too high for me so if you like it hot they can accommate. We came here because of the halal factor but I will be spreading the word to friends that don't even care about that. this place kills Archies and Pin Kaow. If you happen to  like Indonesia or Bali food, they have that thin crispy bread here Rotoni (I think was the name) that you rarely find. I dipped it in my fiance's curry and it was over the TOP! They are local and made a few service mistakes but kindly fixed em and thanked us genuinely for coming. Well done!  We always hit the grove when we are in LA and go to our fav spot called Banana Leaf...guess what..got our fix here. This is thai on steriods!",3EKyCSrhaJ10_qX8OREpBQ,0,0,5,Y-_PrFvvLQ6MsGVMo26EdQ

For appetizers, the chicken satay was my favorite along with the Tom yum soup. Overall, everything was perfect and the service was really fast too.

4085966,2015-02-26,2,cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ,"Stopped by for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Place wasn't too busy. Server was very prompt. Took our orders for pad Thai. The spice scale was only from 1 to 5 which I thought was strange. 

The waiter got us water but it had no ice in it and wasn't particularly cold. Thought it was a bit weird, would want my tap water a little colder than room temperature. 

I got my beef pad Thai and I only did 2 out of 5 spices but I was disappointed as I had no spice whatsoever. And there wasn't much spice to put into the food either as the spice containers on the table were pretty empty. 

Server didn't come back much after we got our food. The food was pretty bland. The peanuts overpowered much of the meal. Beef was okay, the noodles was pretty mushy and lacked flavor. If you wanted to carbo load, it would be great but lacked flavor. I felt bloated after eating the meal, needed to take a nap. 

The place has gotten great reviews before so there must be better dishes. I'd probably say to avoid the pad Thai and maybe bring your own ice cubes.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,2,2,3,r1mZh_mGeIdfmYUMzruYSg

4261833,2015-02-23,1,cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ,"Stopped in here for lunch one day as we were feeling the itch for Thai food and searched for the closest place. 

Service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Thai iced tea and it was standard. Our waters came with no ice in them which was a little strange. 

Shrimp pad thai was very mediocre. Maybe I caught them on and off day but the noodles were super mushy and the plate came with the hugest mound of bean sprouts. My plate was split 1/2 pad thai noodles, 1/4 bean sprouts, and 1/4 crushed peanuts. The garnish proportion was way off and there were no limes! 

I also asked for a 3 out of 5 spiciness because I always tell myself that I can add some heat rather than having my tongue burn off and just suffer through it because there was no way to take away the heat. But the container for hot stuffs were basically empty. It also worried me that they sit out for too long without anyone checking them for their levels and/or cleanliness. 

Again, maybe it was an off day, and we only had pad thai, but it was a disappointing dish--mushy, bland, and overpowered by sprouts and crushed peanuts. I hope that other dishes are much better.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,1,1,3,XAJ9nh5zujNgoBUSzlYxFA

4878640,2014-02-24,2,cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ,"Hell yes!  We loved our dinners and look forward to eating here often in the future.  Glad the decor isn't bleach boring strip mall, and although it's lacking much style, it's comfortable enough to sit with friends and chat the night away.  Friendly service.  Large portions, great for sharing and mixing.

Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Seafood Combo -- Our favorite!  We stayed safe with Spice Level 1 after overhearing another table complain they ordered too hot.  Glad we scaled back; the 1 was perfect.  A little tingle but no pain, and tons of flavor with the herbs and crunchy veg.  Good seafood mix, giant muscles and grilled shrimp, so-so squid.

Yakisoba, Meat Combo -- Pleasantly sweet noodles with lots of veg and meat.  Skip the plain (but moist) thin strips of beef and chicken, just go all shrimp, baby.  I wish there was more cabbage.  (Good line for my tombstone, gotta remember that one.)

Crispy Catfish Salad -- Bizarre at first, since the fish is minced super fine, then fried to an indiscernible crisp ... so we just saw a blanket of brown crunchies and were confused where the ""fish"" went.  But after the lovely server explained it's a different style, we mixed it in with a green apple salad and our faces basically exploded with tart, sweet, spicy crunch.  In fact, we kept spooning the mixture over everything else we ate, because it had a crunch that could not be stopped.  I wouldn't be satisfied with just this plate for dinner, but it's an excellent sharing dish for punching up everything else.

Crab Rangoon -- Unlike any I've had, rolled long and thin in spring roll wrappers.

I'm diggin how this place comes at my usual orders with a different angle.  I also appreciate the Chinese options on the menu, since our group doesn't all love Thai, so everyone leaves happy and stuffed.

Also in love with their roti, since I haven't found roti this good since Flat Top Grille in Chicago.  Shame it's $2.50 each, but I will order saucy things just to have something to dip in these slices of heaven.

If you're a texture-based eater like me, this place is a playground.  :-)

 Not only did they offer Thai, but they also offered Chinese and Japanese. I will say, the Japanese options are very limited. The wait time of the restaurant was awesome! Once we decided what to order, the food was at the table in 5 minutes max. It tasted like authentic Asian cuisine, and was incredibly flavorful and delicious!

5063949,2015-05-18,8,cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ,"Not too shabby.

Had this spot bookmarked for a while now and decided to put it on ""checked"" list.

Locates on the busy Sahara Ave, just off of Arville, next to 7-11.  This place has prime location. Or so you would think. We were the only table for about an hour or so. Interior is quite roomy. Plenty seating, and enough room for large parties of maybe 30-40 guests. Thai decor and food pictures displayed on wall. Sakina is only 2 years old. The previous restaurant, in its spot, was also a thai restaurant. Previous owner failed I guess. Janet, the owner, server, waitress, and host, is a very kind and inviting person. She made our experience a very warm one. So far her clientele is based off of a peer to peer experience, no advertising. So more local regulars as is Kinnaree Thai, and Komol Restaurant. 

What ordered:
Pork larb
Chicken green curry
Papaya salad
Chicken pa kapow

Their heat scale is based on a 1-5 hotness here, 5 being their hottest. Everything was brought out at the same time as requested. Janet kept our waters filled and constantly checked on us, adding conversations here and there. 
The food.... Pork larb was amazing. Considered a salad dish, my wife and i always eat this as a main dish. It has a great mix of tangy and sweet with a hint of spicy. The papaya salad was too sweet for our liking. But then again, we always get it Lao style where they use crab paste and a bit more fish sauce. Considering we were in a thai restaurant, we'd try it authentic. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just a little sweeter than what we're used too. The green curry was also flavorful. I'm used to a thicker sauce than the one served. It was a bit runny, but the flavor was good. White meat was used in this dish. I did not get to try the noodle dish my wife got, but she gave it a 7 on a 1-10 scale. 

Overall this is a good go to spot for thai food. If you are in the vicinity of 5 miles, look forward to delivery in the future. Janet will be organizing with some people in order to get it on track. Worth the stop if your in the area.",R6eX08IXP4Vsw2Tbee3aGA,12,11,4,e57Wh-22DgL7VYZyyQTmpA
