BUT... empty, open air bar, chilly weather, no one to sing with... NO customers at all.... loose 1 point.  Karoke KJ (DJ?-he uses a computer..) wore an awful fake 70's rock star wig.  No late 60's age man should wear such a thing.  loose another point.  Bar staff seemed not very interested in what they were supposed to be there for.  A bit messy setup. Loose another point.  I did not eat there so I won't add nor subtract for the food.

Location is excellent for the major casino/hotels on the strip.  An easy walk from at least 7 casinos. Ross and Walgreens nearby for the little necessities.  Location gains back one point.  

I think if someone overhauled the place, they could bring in a lot more customers and even enjoy themselves in the process.  (like outside heaters for the cold nights and a clean or even painted floor for atmosphere  or even give it a bit more upscale look - might bring in more steady clientele.)",-0LyWroyeSaO9aU38p2YwA,1,1,3,AdH7gLMqEKGnN-6qKqVTqQ

The food quality was about comparable to Denny's. 
The coffee was a little weak but fresh.
Portions were generous.
Service was friendly. 
I'd go again.",ivXADOyWAwWdseTJHzaYbQ,1,0,3,lUHzapMHwqElVkjJj2yPfQ

A few of my friends went wandering around the strip to find breakfast and came across Zingers which advertised that breakfast was served all day. So figuring that was a sign that it couldn't be half bad, we went in. BIG MISTAKE. Upon ordering, the server clearly was confused about our basic orders from the menu. When the food came, we've never been more disappointed. My friend ordered a chicken sandwich that was rubbery, another friend had undercooked sausage, they served me meat even though, when ordering, I clearly stated that I'm vegetarian and did not want any meat in mine, and my friends omelet had unmelted cheese that wad HARD as a rock. The eggs were rubbery, the food flavorless, and the hash browns were awful. I've never been so disappointed in my dining experience. In the end, the bill was at least twice as high as it should've been for the quality and we left feeling robbed and unsatisfied. It really was the worst start to the day possible, so save yourself the trouble and avoid this place like the plague as far as the food is concerned.",jEWGXW8VNrmcxbNc4QaFEA,1,0,1,kIJ6OrWUAdXvES2lUlK7VQ

I ordered probably one of the worst mexican omelletes I have ever had in a long time.  No life to it what so ever.  There was nothing mexican about it besides a little bit of salsa. 

They do however have karaoke later on during the day which looked like fun.  They seem to be open all day and night since we actually left our hotel around 5:30am and saw people there still drinking.  For this, I will add an extra star to my review.

This bar is right on the strip outdoors.  If you've been to Vegas or even been to this bar, you probably didn't even think it had a name.  It does.  I have seen snake charmers dancing with 10 foot snakes on their necks.  I've also been here in a gale force wind, and they were still open.

A tip moves you up to the front of the line.  Just a couple of bucks works wonders.  They have beers for under $6 usually.  Cheap for a bar on the strip.  Usually no one cares if you bring a drink in.",li4lhgB9SnXagzu5sDliDg,2,0,4,C6Iyc3j-YZ1PIDiYxeKOkQ

I wouldn't feed this stuff to my enemies. The food is absolutely terrible. Rolled in a bit hungover (hey it's Vegas) and ordered a burger with fries and a grilled cheese sandwich. Well, fries were soggy as well as the burger bun, the stuff they called hamburger meat looked and taste mysterious, and still cant figure out if that was really cheese in the sandwich.

They serve breakfast, as well as giant plastic souvenier guitars and lava lamps for all your carry-along booze needs. $12 for the first one, $6 for refills no matter how many times you stop by.

They do karaoke at night, which wasn't exactly hopping when we were there. But to be fair, it was a frio night when we went with no space-heaters on. The die-hards were out there though, belting out 80s classics. I give them an A for effort, F for sobriety.

2668676,2013-03-23,2,MZjw8RBI7dBC6G7jkQFEmA,"Zingers, what can I say about you.  I go here for one reason.  Karaoke.  I've never eaten here, but the food reviews are all pretty weak, so I'm kind of scared.  I have bought drinks here and of course the best deal is the refillable drinks.  PRICEY at first, but the refills make it worth your while and you can refill them as often as possible, so bring it back on your next trip, too.  Negative is a $6 bottle of Sierra Nevada and $10 minimum drink order to use a credit card.  Bleh.

Zingers is an outdoor venue, it's got a bar and some tables, but no heaters, so if it's a cold night, WEAR A COAT!  The best part is they always have karaoke.  The current KJ is a creepy guy in a long blonde rocker wig.  He also charges you $5 to sing, but once you pay, it's unlimited singing.

I was there Wednesday night, I sang a few songs really badly and one okay.  I was joined by the old guy, the cowboy, and the diva.... so, not their busiest night, but we were drunk, I brought my own frozen drink in and no one complained and heck I had fun and I got to practice my bad singing in front of people I'll never see again!

You know I always have fun when I go there, but it's kind of a ratty place in general. I totally waffled on two or three stars, but I like going here and it's steps away from my usual home away from home in Vegas, so I'm giving them the 3 for entertainment value alone.",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,3,1,3,_VtLOte3Glnlf0CKmW_Pew

Sign #1, 7pm and the restaurant is entirely empty.  Should have left then. Obviously we weren't looking for a 5 star dining experience, just burgers and fries before the group got ""hangry.""  The waitress seated us, and took our orders, which was fine--but snapped hostilely when asked a question about salad dressing.  She brought the food as it was ready, so half of the group was finished eating before the others even got their (similar cooking-time) meals. The service was generally poor.  The food was mediocre at best, especially considering we could have had the same quality food and a better service experience at a McDonald's.  Finally, when the bill came we were told that Zinger's did not accept credit or debit cards.  They clearly post the credit cards that they accept on the door.  When we brought this up, the waitress snapped and told us that we were being given a discount, our $98.00 bill didn't appear to have any discount whatsoever when compared with menu pricing and tax.  In order to just get the experience over with as soon as possible, we threw together the cash we had, covered the bill and left.

3074532,2014-07-27,1,MZjw8RBI7dBC6G7jkQFEmA,"It cracks me up that people are reviewing this place for food. I thought it was fairly obvious from the outside that it was primarily a bar, but I guess everyone's different. 

Anyway, WE WENT THERE TO DRINK. We were walking down the strip at 1:00 AM because that's the only time it wasn't 110 degrees outside, and we saw this woman with this gigantic, high-heeled leg-shaped fishnet-covered container filled with alcohol. We tracked it down to Zingers. 

The waitress who helped us was amazing -- there was a long line at the bar but she came out of the building, saw us, and came over to see if we had questions. We told her we wanted the leg, and she handed us a menu so we could pick our poison. She was patient and didn't take off while waiting for us to decide, and even knocked a few bucks off the price! We essentially paid $25 for a giant, high-heeled leg-shaped fishnet-covered container filled with Melon Ball. It was strong, a great mix, and for that amount (at least 32-48 oz) worth the money! We shared it and we couldn't finish it (we know our limits in that kind of heat and switched back to water about 2/3 through), so it was pretty decent quality. And, we can bring the container back any time for $15 refills!

To be fair, we didn't have food so I can imagine it probably was about as terrible as the other reviews say. But our personal experience with the service and alcohol was great, and we will be returning during our next visit!",gBtBRe0QM0ZU8H_xOY4o_Q,2,2,5,HiWuJXNxb1OHqjrfiRYhBw

Then when I told the waitress about the error and I asked to ensure I wouldn't be charged and she said I would be and left. Soon after another waitress came and I informed her and my response received was ""ya you did"". 

10mins later the same waitress showed up with an additional completely different salad and when I asked what why I was given it she shrugged.

It was about as good as any Denny's I've ever been to. The service was also decent, but at least they were attentive. Maybe I just had a very different experience from other people. I had other breakfasts for similar prices in Vegas but the service for all of them was lacking in some way. At least our waters stayed full here.

4164468,2013-10-07,0,MZjw8RBI7dBC6G7jkQFEmA,"This review is strictly for the karaoke and drinks.  I'm a karaoke fiend.  I've sang karaoke all over America.  Some cities embrace it while others ignore it, and relegate it to middle-aged off-key drunks who sound worse than two cats getting busy.  I went here three times.  The weather is nicer in September.  There is no way in hell I'd come here in July or August.  The drinks are cheaper than most Strip casinos at $4/Miller Lite so that's a good point.  The bad point is that it costs $5 to sign up for karaoke (and I tip $1 a song).  I'm not sure if anyone else tips, but that $1/song doesn't get you anywhere up the list faster.  If you arrive and there are 20 people there, guaranteed, half have not sung and want to, so get ready to sit for 10 songs.  I would say half are actually very good singers which is pretty good for a karaoke place and there were only about 1 in 5 that made my beer curl.  There weren't hardly any single women by themselves, which is like a theme in Vegas.  In fact, I would bet, there are more single women by themselves at bars who are working (prostitutes) as opposed to just single women out to have a good time.  There aren't even those pair of women.  Vegas, the women walk around in herds.  But then again, a lot of guys do too.  

The crowd is mixed.  It's not a club scene folks.  We're talking a few young folk, a lot of middle-aged folk, a few old folk.  The bartenders were very prompt (unlike Fat Bar) and they were ten times friendlier than at Fat Bar down the way.  I gave Fat Bar one star FYI.  Since it's an outdoor bar, it's safe so a lot of women come here which does not occur with karaoke in dive bars.
