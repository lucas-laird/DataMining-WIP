The waffles were good but the chicken had ZERO seasoning, very greasy and the Breast was over cooked and the oil tastes as if it had been sitting in an old coffee can the past week! The only reason I gave it two stars is because the waiter was very nice and removed the item from out ticket.
Would definitely never return and would never recommend to anyone!

Second time with both my daughters and the third time just last night with a birthday party group.  They are so nice and the food is amazing.

The chicken was too crispy for me. The waffles are very flat and not toasted enough. One of my friends thought of it as KFC fried chicken with Lego My Ego waffles.

The GUEST SERVICING here was amazing though. They were friendly, catered to me periodically, and the kool-aid is DELICIOUS. If there's anything I'd come back here for is for the kool-aid, definitely.",UKHs5O6rJOTLKFH1cozFSA,0,0,3,gUv5u7XhuJxflmVgtYfM8w

I loved the fried chicken, crisp, but not overly done so, and not greasy, but the chicken itself was juicy and good. (I ordered the Betty's Boob!) We also got a side of collared greens and green bean/potatoes and shared those. Collared greens were not mush like some places make them, but nice and fresh and a little bit of a zip/zest to them. As were the green beans. My son got himself some fried okra and it was tasty. 

Unlike the other heathens posting, I LOVED the cinnamon in the waffles. Made them delish! Granted, I am partial to cinnamon in most things, but I thought it made the waffles very tasty. 

We drank some sweet tea, atho, down the road, I plan on getting some koolaid on tap. haha.

A bunch of girls standing around the register looking like they were deep in convo and couldn't be bothered. I approached and said ide like to order take out. One girl handed me a menu and very dryly told me to have a seat. I sat at a nearby bench and made my choice, went back to the register and started to place my order. After i was done talking, another girl told me that they dont do take out, so i will have to sit down at a table, order my food, box it, and then leave. So i asked if i could sit anywhere, they said yes. I walked over to the bar and as im turning around, the girls are all snickering as if im the one with the problem. I ordered my food with the bartender telling him ide like white meat only (chicken and waffles with grits) with a fruit punch koolaide. The bartender tells me that there are no substitutions but points out another meal similar to what I'm asking for. Its more expensive but i agree and continue (i know i should've left at that point but i was hungry and hungover). No coffee or water offered to me btw, after all i AM dining in right?? Wrong! The food comes out pretty quickly (questionable but no real complaint there) and the bartender and i start boxing it together. No gloves or sanitizer, just boxing my food up. It wasn't until i was in the car when i realized that the koolaide was extremely watery and when i got home i see gave me a thigh instead of breast like I had asked and paid extra for. I absolutely hate dark meat. I didn't bother calling to complain because something told me that my concerns wouldn't have been met anyway. Instead I've decided to leave a very honest yet opinionated review. Avoid this place if you can. Even if the service is great and you get what you ordered, the food itself is mediocre, the drink was bland, and it was super overpriced.

315615,2017-05-12,2,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"Easily one of the worst meals we've had here in Vegas. I should give zero stars but considering one of the front end employees acknowledged our complaints I'm giving one.

We came in on a Thursday evening and there's only one other table including ours. We ordered fried chicken and waffles and it came out a little too quickly which I thought was odd. But right off the bat we noticed the chicken was too brown - basically burnt. Not only was it burnt but it was beyond dry. I had one thigh that was somewhat edible. The mac and cheese was so chewy and dry it tasted like it was sitting under a heating lamp. 

When our check came and noticed how much we would paying for an inedible meal, we talked to our server about it. She apologized and said ""most days the chicken is golden but for some reason today I noticed the darker color."" What?? The fact that she even noticed and and still served it to us is crazy. She spoke to someone about our complaint and offered a 10% discount. 

As we were leaving the front end employee asked how everything was and by both mine and my wife's ""okay"" she kindly wanted to address the issue. She said she would talk to the kitchen and has mentioned to them before that when it is slow food should be made cooked-to-order (duh.) She wanted us to give them a second chance but honestly we probably wouldn't considering the price of the food. She also told us they were having a re-grand opening tomorrow and all I could think was that they're not off to a very good 2nd start. I told her if the kitchen staff wouldn't eat dry and burnt chicken themselves, it shouldn't be on the plate. Period.

Everyone that we came in contact with was very nice and accommodating. The waiters were very upbeat and efficient. The service was very speedy and accurate.

Now, to the food. I am really a fan of the waffles. They were prepared just right, vey moist and flavorful. I could go every week just for the waffles.

Mom has been DYING for fried green tomatoes! We raced down there, excited and a little worried (who knows how popular they could be; line out the door?). We walked in and were seated right away. Lolo's is a large place (they took over the old Tony Romas) with plenty of seating. We were given a temporary menu as the place has only been open for 5 days and they don't have all the items they need for their complete menu, yet (the hostess told us). We peruse the menu, searching for the tomatoes....there they are.....wait.... $7???? OK well, how many come in the order? Server double checks and tells us there are 4 in an order. 4??? These must be some amazing tomatoes! So, we order them as well as the spicy corn fritters as appetizers. Spicy corn fritters were Amazing!!! I loved them. The tomatoes on the other hand were so so. Definitely not worth the price. Kind of disappointing since we chose this place because of the tomatoes! Mom ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. No where near enough gravy to go with the biscuits, the potatoes were seasoned well but they were underdone and on the firm side. Mom asked for her eggs to be fried well done as she is not a fan of a runny yolk. One of the egg yolks wasn't completely cooked so she cut it away and put it on a separate plate so it wouldn't run into her gravy. I ordered the waffle and chicken breast (Betty Boob, I believe they called it). My meal was good, nothing spectacular. The warm syrup was pretty good. 

Overall, service was great. Our server was attentive and quick. Just wish for a better bang for my buck! Mom and i went Dutch. Corn fritters and Betty Boob (i drank water) cost me $16.22 with tax. At the bottom of my receipt, the recommended tip is $3.00 (18.5%). Paid the check and took our time leaving.

My dining companions ordered the 3 ap platter with Spicy Corn Fritters, catfish biegnets, and fried green tomatoes. The corn fritters were killer - I will definitely order them if I go again. They were a little spicier than I expected, but it was a nice surprise. The fried green tomatoes were good, but I had never had that dish before and I know it is something people have a lot of opinions about. I didn't have the catfish, but it looked crispy and my friends said they liked it.

We ordered booze as well, and I felt the mixed drinks were a pretty reasonable value. I got the Georgia On My Mind, which was excellent, and I tried my friend's Orange Creamsicle, which was also excellent. The gentlemen in our party got beer, which was stated as the house special but rang up as Busch Light on our bill: not sure if our waiter was giving us the hook-up on price, or if they are actually passing off Busch Light as a house special.

I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken platter with Mac n Cheese, buttered corn and cornbread. The mac n cheese was great, best I've ever had in a chain restaurant. It's baked, so it tastes homemade instead of the weirdly liquid cheese you get at some other places. The buttered corn definitely came from the bottom of the pot, but it tasted fine in spite of looking kinda weird. The chicken fried chicken was crispy outside and juicy inside. The dish comes ""smothered in sausage gravy,"" but I asked for the gravy on the side because I thought it might make the chicken soggy. The gravy was delicious and chunky when I dipped my chicken in it, so I can't wait to go back and get the Biscuits and Gravy. 

My friends split the KKs special (which was a good idea because the ap platter was huge!) They were very pleased with the fried chicken, waffle and scrambled eggs, but the grits had huge mountains of butter on them, and they didn't particularly care for the grits under the butter.

I'll tell you what I appreciate the most about LoLo's chicken (drum roll please) it's simple, they have bone in chicken.  I know it's not a big deal but it's a personal preference probably because I was 1st introduced to ""Chicken and Waffles"" at Roscoe' s in LA, so when I get a filleted chicken  breast that's been battered and fried, I tend to pout.  I also like that there are various combinations wof the same meal on the menu, no need to ask if they can add a this or substitute a that, it saves time when ordering which is a very important thing when you're hungry.  I was so hungry I forgot to check in that's why in my check in photo the waffle is half way gone, don't judge me. Oh, and I gave it five stars because the service was great the lady who sat me was a dear, Nathan my server stoped by twice to check up on me and so did some other guy plus the bathroom  was clean.

Well this time I had to knock off 2 stars but you guys did make one back up. I had friends from out of town in and we decided to take a trip to the famous gizzard place I had been raving on. 8 of us come in and was greeted by this pleasant young lady. Was told it would be a min while another young lady set the tables up, no problem it was quick. However just that quick she told us the table was there and that was it. Lol. No walking no showing no pointing. It went down hill from there. We sat there for a good 15 mins before a young lady asked us who was our waitress and if we was taken care of. Another 5 minutes for her to come back take drink orders and told well we're really busy so can you place your orders now. I felt like she was telling us put it in now since you all have been sitting for 25 mins or wait another hour. Anyways I waited so long for drinks that I couldn't take it any longer and asked for the manager. He was cool about the situation and did what he could I'm guessing. They asked us a million times afterwards was we ok but we still waited a while for our food to come out and it wasn't all together. Nevertheless, the lady who ditched us at the front apologized and we got free dessert and drinks! I will be back but maybe with a smaller crew so it won't be discouraging to the workers.

Then my mother said excuse me again...the watreess stopped looked directly at us. Looked back at the papers in her hand and proceeded to walk away. Then the table behind said wow!

1208878,2016-04-26,4,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"Tried to check this place out a few weeks ago on a Sunday night around 6:00pm, but had to back out due to the line being out the door with a minimum hour wait. Post church rush possibly? Became a little skeptical when I started reading bad reviews about it, especially one from a coworker who USED to be a big fan of this place. Hmph.

Took a gamble this Saturday at 8:00pm... no line, no wait, requested a booth & was seated immediately. Bar was completely empty and they were surprisingly slow -- yet it took quite a while for them to take our order, I'm not sure if it's because they have an extensive menu but I had to flag someone down 15 minutes into sitting just so we could just order our drinks.

Their menu, as stated, was surprisingly extensive. They have an all-day breakfast section with omelettes, pancakes, french toast, eggs and more. They have a ""lo-lo's hood classics"" & ""the eats"" section that features a plethora of soul food-esque combination plates, with a long section of additional sides & add-ons. But we came here for the famous chicken & waffles, so that's what we opted for. 

FOR HER: 
- The ""TRE-TRE'S"" which came with two drumsticks & one waffle. The chicken batter was decent, so were the waffles -- which seemed to have a cinnamon kick. I also ordered a side of the BISCUITS & GRAVY ($4 for one, 6$ for two). They were much larger than I imagined and the sausage gravy was pretty tasty!
FOR HIM: 
- The ""BABY RAY"" with 3 piece chicken w/ gravy & onions and 2 waffles. He got the gravy & onions on the side to avoid it making the chicken soggy, which he was very thankful for as he did not like the gravy at all. I found the onions to be a nice touch, but also wouldn't have been happy with it smothered in it.

Overall, I have to say, being a fan of Roscoe's, my standards were set based off of them... which I honestly would have to say wasn't exactly up to par. Would we come back? Eh, yeah maybe in a few months if we ever have a chicken & waffle craving... but would we wait an hour for seating or risk coming when it's actually busy? Yeah, pass.",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,4,4,3,y3SsckBdwijqUOr_K37L-A

When the food arrived, we were exiting our booth however, the server encouraged us to stay. 

Based upon the serving time, one of the plates were cold and had to be returned. I spoke to the server and voiced my complaint and she said the kitchen was short handed. 

Usually when food is returned, the manager visits the table, apologize and offer some kind of commiserate. In this instance, the manager never visited which was shocking. I inquired and discovered he was assisting in the kitchen. 

Sorry to say, I will not be recommending this restaurant because of the service. However, if the manager had visited, I would have recommended the restaurant based upon GP. 

The server (Starr) was great however, she could not compensate for a slow, understaffed and unorganized kitchen. 

If you visit, be prepared to sit ten minutes before ordering and an additional thirty minutes to receive your food!

Friendly staff.  I ordered the shrimp and grits,  with hot links on the side, extra extra burnt.. delish!!! Of course i ordered more than i could eat.. oh, i forgot to mention, the GREEN APPLE KOOLAID!!! So good yall.. but like i stated before, i ordered more than i could eat at the time.  

I went to the wash room, leaving my portfolio sitting on the table.. when i came back, my food was gone, but there was a fresh glass of koolaid left on the table,  with my check next to it... so I waited for Sparkey, my server to come back with my food in a to go container.. he never did,  so i stood up and he came by to tell me that he takes care of the check.. i asked him, where is my food... he said , ""oh, i threw it in the trash"".. took the check book out of my hand and proceeded to go to the computer to finalise the bill... i asked, so you throw my food away, and expect me to pay this full bill? He said ""yes, i thought you had left"".. im like...""but my stuff was still on the table, and you left me a fresh glass if koolaid"", hes now showingly pissed.. i said ""you throw my food in the trash, without closing out with me, and your pissed about it?"" He says you can talk to my manager..... the manager comes, and tells me that they will make me another meal... no sir.. its cold in here,  and i don't have time to wait for you guys to cook it, i have somewhere to be... he told me that i must pay the bill.... i did.  I asked how long has sparky been serving.. thats when i was told that after the incident with my food.. he snapped at the hostesses about folding napkins. 

Ive never had my food thrown out and had to pay for it... never.. there was a full bowl of shrimp and grits left, i had only eaten four bites.. the bowl is hughe! But what gets me is that my belongings were still at the table, and he had given me a fresh glass of koolaid.. but, he says he thought id left without paying my bill...

Any one else would have lost their minds about this... ive never had this happen to me.. there was a woman in the restroom with her disabled mother trying to get the mom together.. but i was not away from the table long enough to throw my food away.. and if my things were still there... why would he, without asking me?",S6m8vYFLJRVjBozIez3byA,1,0,3,Eb7RzHFxOb3UeGdpSFJrdw

Weirdest service of my life from beginning to the end. As we entered, there was an ample amount of staff but yet we were ignored. We stared at the hostess and another worker just chilling at the counter for a good 7 minutes and tried to say hi before they acknowledged us. She then rolled her eyes & asked if there was 4 of us, peered over the counter to see open tables, and yelled there's a booth over there...but then she didn't seat us....we just stood there awkwardly and she yelled another worker over and said sit them at that booth and the worker said ""I ain't a hostess"" and she yelled back ""you are today!"" Then we were handed menus as we were walking & then seated at the wrong booth. We sat around another 15 mins before someone asked us for our drink order and when we tried to order our server knew nothing about the menu...the menu has literally like 20 items....we tried to call over 7 wait staff just to get some sauces for our chicken as well as the missing order and no one acknowledged us. As we paid our check for the slowest service in our lives we didn't even care to get our extra change back because we knew it would take forever. Then he put the money down on our table and started counting it? Wtf

Chicken was dry af but the sides were delicious. They are known for their chicken so I was confused. Definitely try there corn fritters, fried green beans, and candy sweets.

My husband and I went in earlier this week 2/9/16 and sat by the bar and took about 5 minutes to read through a menu that made our mouths water. We placed our order with a waitress that was fairly pleasant and brought us our water. My husband and I got into a heated discussion that distracted us from the fact that 20 minutes rolled by and no food. When I checked the time and realized its been 20 minutes since we ordered we started really observing food coming in and out of the kitchen but nothing to our table. We also counted and realized there were 4 different groups of people that came in after us and they got their food. Finally the waitress comes by and says that they were frying my catfish and wanted to make sure it was done right. Come on now! Catfish don't take that long!!! After waiting for 40 minutes total we decided to get up and leave. As we walked towards the door a lady(employee) ran up to us saying no no don't leave yet! She grabbed my husband's shoulder and my arm (highly inappropriate) to stop us from walking out. She said something like please don't leave I'm sorry I will get your check.  I'm assuming she meant she'd comp the meal for being incompetent. I calmly said we were done and my husband and I walked out.
 A. Who was she? 
B. Where did she come from? 
C. If she knew there was an issue with our meals why didn't she come to our table to address it before?

Then the server came, gave us a minute so we can finally decide and after that it took us 45 minutes to get our food. 
I lost my patience and my appetite because,
That was after she had only checked up on us ONCE within that time frame and only offered one refill for my roommate. I would not have been that mad but the restaurant wasn't even that busy. 
Not only did I have to ask another server if our food was backed up, but the manager came and didn't even give me a chance to respond. 
It's like the servers and the manager came by to say what they had to say without even checking up on us and then leaving as to not give us a chance to ask for anything. 

Not only that but multiple tables that came after us  had gotten their food and drinks/refills before we did. 

When I called for one of the servers she kept telling me no before I even asked a question or said anything. 

The food was great but it definitely didn't make up for the lack of service,  and the rude employees. 
I raised my hand several times just to get the attention of anybody working and nobody came. I'm usually patient at restaurants because I am a part of the restaurant business myself but this type of service was unacceptable. 
Finally when we were done eating our server was fast to our attention when dealing with the check as it seemed she wanted to get rid of us as soon as she could. I didn't feel welcomed at all. 

I was excited and ready to eat my food but my first experience here was totally ruined, and my roommate and I will not find ourselves coming back.

I think what made us most irritable was that in addition to the slow service, there was a huge lack of communication in letting us know whatever was hindering our food from coming out. We did speak with the manager, who was super nice...so that and the food flavor/quality is why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 1. 

We came in after what appeared to be a lunch rush, but the place was not extraordinarily packed when we sat down. My party of 4 was eventually greeted and our drink orders were taken. It took a little long to get our drinks, but nothing crazy... nothing like what we were about to experience. 

After putting in our order we watched as multiple tables came in and sat down and got their food around us, yet we were still food-less. These were parties of various sizes as well and who appeared to have ordered the same types of things we ordered. Matter of fact, one of the orders within my party was a med cooked burger! We continued to watch as everyone got their food and had made eye contact with our server a couple times, hoping to get her to come tell us why our food was taking so long. She never did. We actually ended up speaking with a manager about the issue and it wasn't until then that we actually got our food. When our food was being brought to our table though, we noticed that the burger was missing. What in the world?! Also, my chicken was COLD! After waiting over 45minutes for food and it was cold? Nope. 

The manager had offered up a discount but, we explained, that was not what we were after. We would have been somewhat okay (I'm still upset at my 45minute COLD chicken) had the server communicated properly and treated us how those around us were being treated. It is still unclear to me why our server did not take care of us the same way that the other tables were being taken care of... and here's the kicker... she sent over another server to drop the check!

I love waffles and I love fried chicken, however, I have never been a fan of them together. Unfortunately this wouldn't be the time I tell you I have converted either.  

The fried chicken was amazing and I would definitely come back for the chicken, but the waffles??? The waffles were so underwhelming I could not get past two bites.   They were floppy soft and to cinnamon flavored.  Just awful! We also ordered a corn bread muffin which was inedible, dry and hard. 

I loved that they serve a variety of beverages including grape, green apple, and watermelon Kool-Aid. The flavors will vary though.  The server was really nice, but she brought us all the wrong drinks.

The staff seemed overwhelmed and come to find out the wait to be seated also had to do with letting the kitchen catch up.   Oh well, overall it was ok, and like I mentioned the fried chicken is worth coming back for.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,10,7,3,SfG5oIXcH61Huxelc4SKCw

My husband had two fried catfish fillets with Cole slaw and fried okra.  I had chicken fried chicken, which was a huge boneless chicken fillet, smothered in white, sausage gravy, sautéed zucchini and yellow squash and the best macaroni and cheese that I ever had and a large, sweet and tasty, corn bread muffin!  The price for all of those items were just $15.00!  You can't beat that price!  I had to take half of my dinner home to eat later.

There is also some yummy looking desert options, but I'm always too full to try them!

The reason that I only gave them 4 stars is because the tables and chairs are not very comfortable and a tad low for me.  I also agree with other reviews that the service could be better.

I have been here twice on different occassions.  During peak hours and the weekends, this place can get quite busy.  The best part about this Vegas location is that there is lots of parking even though it is a drive from both DTLV and the Strip.  My first time around I came to spend time with my cousins at the bar.  I ordered the Georgia On My Mind, which was suprisingly good.  As far as my second time around, I had to give Lo Lo's another try before leaving.  I ordered the Lo Lo's (# 3 on the menu) which was 3 pcs of chicken and 2 waffles.  The chicken was nice and juicy and not too bready.  The waffles had a hint of cinnamon yet were thick and delicious.  As far as I know, Roscoe's wins the battle of the waffle, but Lo Lo's wins on variety because there is EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY.  Also unlike Roscoe's, Lo Lo's serves alcoholic drinks and serves most of their drinks in Mason jars.  The service was great and exceeded my expectations.  For those who LOVE Roscoe's you will have mixed feelings about Lo Lo's.

The bill came and for 3 drinks ($3.50 a piece for soda!!), two orders of burnt pancakes and a dry over cooked omelet it was over $50!  At that point I had to ask for the manager and he took $20 off our bill.  Yeah, that didn't cut it for a horrible dining experience.",FuP5G1xTinlrKyh_oW24YQ,3,1,1,e0BtmRIbJoZSjSzLwPkk8w

Food: Food was delicious! Chicken & Waffles, biscuits & gravy, pancakes w/ caramel, bananas & pecans, & french toast. The chicken looked alittle over cooked but was still good. The was also abundant! We could've share two of the plates and still be full!

Been wanting to try it, but place is pretty busy on weekends. So, we checked it out for an early lunch on Friday and got right in.  There were waves of patrons in and out of the lower dining area, but the bar area with the pub tables seem to have availability so we'll keep that in mind, too.  Nice open feel to the building, wood-look floors, red leather booths, and vintage touches with bold art pieces. 

Our server Chevy was friendly and happy to answer our many questions.  We decided to be initiated with the standards--chicken and waffles, with sides of dirty rice and gravy with onions, washed down with unsweetened southern tea and half&half tea.  BF and I both loved the hot chicken, well seasoned and crunchy fried exterior, tender juicy meat.   Super large chicken pieces, too.  (Note to smaller appetites, go with the Lil Amadi or risk lugging around a doggy bag after lunch.)  We both had never tried chicken and waffles before and didn't quite understand the fuss, but we do now!  Buttered, soft waffles with maple syrup make the perfect base for a piece of crispy chicken. A fork full of a delish, unexpected combination.   Oh, why did we wait so long to discover this? Now we have to make up for lost time.

The dirty rice is made with gizzards, so if you're used to Popeye's dirty rice, you'll be put off.  It's a bit on the dry side, so be warned.  The gravy is the red gravy and was topped with a few slices of nearly raw onions, not my favorite.

Just glad they did the chicken and waffles well!  Planning to try other selections next time as the menu was fairly extensive.  I know it's a chain restaurant,  but it celt.loke a local diner.  Glad it's in Vegas.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,8,1,4,_DkRfsMaSGRb-JFZCjtywg

Great price for two eggs, three strips of bacon, grits and a home made biscuit or toast.  I added an order of home fries that were a lot like potatoes O'brian and were really good.

Water served with a lemon slice in a mason glass.  Good coffee too.

Service was fast and professional.  

The only downside for me was the ample use of butter and that might be a plus for you.  The grits had a huge scoop of butter. The toast was absolutely drenched in butter.

No seasoning at all. I love fried chicken, it is one of my favorite meals to eat, but if you don't have good breading then it is just pointless to me. If there was any seasoning, I could not taste it at all, but besides that my fries were okay, nothing to remember. At least my drink came in a big mason jar and was their home made lemonade which was very good on this hot summer day. My mom loved her French toast platter, and my daughter got a waffle breakfast sand which, which she seemed to like, and my server was very good. Technically it was a decent outing, but if your signature dish is a classic like fried chicken, you better have some amazing chicken, especially since there are so many choices here in vegas.

Meanwhile we're actually noticing tables ALL around us, who were seated between 10-30 minutes after us, receiving their food. I chased Bre down again!! More excuses. It was obvious at this point she appeared to be refusing service without actually saying it. We asked for the manager....Nate came. We explained what was going on and he stepped up and got the food to us. The food actually seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen because it was definitely not freshly plated and they brought it out in a hurry once I pointed out that every surrounding table was seated long after we were and had already received their meals......including many other tables being served by BRE! Why were WE being ignored by this lady? Even when we asked her for napkins...she took a long time, threw one on the table and attempted to walk off but he caught her so she dropped three more on the table. Even the to-go boxes!! She disappeared and never brought them. Nate had to get us boxes. This was beyond ridiculous! We arrived at 1:40pm and left at 4:04pm with half our food in to-go boxes. We were so incredibly frustrated and infuriated. We were a group of cousins who had not seen each other in 8 years.....thanks for ruining our lunch/reunion Bre. If the owner reads this....Nate is a good man and did his best to save our experience. He should NOT have to do that girls job! We're not sure we'll ever return.

We went to another establishment to eat as we are being seated I mentioned the reason we were there was because we were turned away, apparently of the owner of Lolo's was sitting there and heard me after we finished our meal he approached us introduce himself was very apologetic. Ask for another chance invited us back for a meal on him which I was extremely pleased with... Standby for tomorrow evening for a full and honest review and revision of how many stars they will get. So nice to see business men care about their business and customers.

They give us menus for our kids to keep them entertained with crayons! The staff is great at checking on you during meal. And they also help answer questions mainly because I was never really familiar with a lot of stuff on the menu. Their portions are soo big. The lemonade and sweet tea are delicious. I've actually mix them myself and I've made my own Arnold Palmer but you can always ask for your own when ordering. I love their menu because we have so many options with chicken and waffle. You can get a breast, drumstick or thighs. My favorite is a chicken breast with a waffle and I also love their gravy and biscuits. The perfect time to come here if as soon as they open mainly because later in the day it gets packed. Especially on a Sunday. This last time we went we had a hard time getting the server's attention.

I had the breast and thigh and they were GREAT!  Juicy and just fell off the bone.   The waffle was equally as delicious.  I usually don't scarf meals down, but I crushed this one.

There was no wait to be seated. Our server was really sweet and came up to us right away to take our drink orders. We both got the sweet tea and damn it was good. It was so refreshing and cold, it really hit the spot on a hot summer day. I love that the drinks come in mason jars. Besides the sweet tea they have soft drinks and a few different flavors of kool-aid on tap! 

My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and I chose the Baby Ray which is 3 pieces of smothered chicken and 2 waffles. I asked for the gravy on the side though because I wanted to taste the chicken and wasn't even sure if I would like the gravy. My friend and I had a chance to catch up and after maybe ten minutes or so, our food came out. My food was delicious. I didn't think the chicken was greasy at all and it was very tasty. The skin was crispy, and salty with just the right amount of seasoning. The waffles were good too, large in size and a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter. I enjoyed eating the chicken with the waffles and syrup, but I also liked dipping the chicken into the gravy, it was pretty good. My friend enjoyed her meal but said the grits needed salt. 

For dessert we got the banana pudding to share and it looked great, but I didn't care for it. It had a weird aftertaste and I wouldn't order it again. For both of our meals, drinks and dessert it was almost $50 which is a bit pricey for lunch, but because the food and service were good I would come back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,6,5,4,fXXw9NbHiozJME4ENt-9TQ

The waffles still had a light crispiness to it when they brought it out ( I'm used to the waffles being soft even before I put syrup at the other places out here).

I just remember gizzards being hard pieces of fried something I would have to chew on a bit to be able to swallow. I know, I still ordered them because I was curious. Wasn't expecting much but was totally blown away.

F had the Tre Tre (2 chicken drumsticks and a waffle). Although I didn't try the chicken (next time), I did sample the waffle naked. (Major food phobia for me; syrup isn't allowed to touch savory foods.) The waffle had a nice cinnamon-y taste, softer than a traditional waffle. Good.

I had Uncle Brotha's Shrimp & Grits. My grits were creamy, full of flavor with nice sized shrimp, bacon, onions, mushrooms, and cheese. I am so glad I didn't change my mind about trying them. I mean, I had that on my mind when I first saw their menu online, but when I had the menu in my hand...well, there was soo much to choose from.  My meal came with one of the fluffiest biscuits I have ever had. (Can't wait to try their biscuits and gravy.) I could've used some honey for a touch of sweet for it or maybe even some honey butter, but that's just me. The biscuit and butter it came with was perfectly fine by itself.

I chose lemonade by itself (I'm a lemonade purist) though was very tempted by the grape Cool-aid/lemonade mix. It was very pretty. I know, but visual is a part of my foodie make up.

We went at 530p on a weekday and there was no wait to speak of. Service was wonderful. Our server was Jasmine, who was quick and funny. 

Both F and I commented on the fact we loved that our food was cooked at order. I don't understand people who go to a restaurant and expect their food in five minutes. I like that my food wasn't sitting under a warmer hoping that someone would order that particular dish.

Asked the hostess twice after half an hour had passed how much longer and they said another five minutes, twice they said this and then they told us another 3 minutes. I asked if we could sit in empty area or even outside and they said they only had one server handling it so they couldn't??45 minutes later we were seated in the main dining area. Ordered immediately and drinks took another 12 minutes to come out and no straws either.  I had to get up and get those myself. Took another 30 minutes to get our food.

My wing was partially done, full of grease, and golden brown. My breast and leg were dark, salty, and tasted like it was cooked in old grease. The server returned with the bill. This is by far the worst food that I have tasted since I've been in Vegas. I can admit that my sides of dirty rice and collard greens weren't bad. But the greasy old salty chicken turned my stomach.and made me nauseous. So the whole meal was not a winner. I don't think I will be returning to this place with the awful service.

Yelper Suzy H planning on checking it out asked if wanted to tag along. Always down for trying the newest food spots in Vegas plus eating with someone else always makes the meal more enjoyable. Yelp style not just one dish but multiple dishes share family style. We ordered few things for lunch. 

We started with some Spicy Corn Fritters. I was pleasantly surprise. I thinking just be more normal jalapeño popper deep fry no big deal. They had so much more depth with the corn batter and just right amount of heat from the diced jalapeños. Fried nice golden brown. Moist. Not sure the sauce came with but honestly spicy corn fritters addicting by itself. I tried the sauce nothing memorable the once had one really addicting not stop. 

The Three piece chicken and waffles. Really average at best. The thing that never worked for me was the the breading dipped the chicken in. The chicken on the inside was cooked perfectly through nice and moist. The portion size of the chicken is awesome. Just fried chicken is only AS goos as the breading. It just never did anything for me compare to other fried chicken spots around Vegas. I felt like heavy breading or not light breading. Bite into it not  as crispy. The waffles talk about dense. Waffles were so dense nothing fluffy about them. Me that turn off. They cooked nice golden brown on the outside. 

The side of cornbread was ok. The size was huge. No way getting cheated on side of cornbread that for sure. 

The pineapple upside down pancake. By far was the best part of lunch. The combination is something unique. I loved it. The pancakes was nice fluffy just the way like my pancakes or waffles. The flavor was insane. It really tasted with dessert just in pancake form. There was ample amount of pineapples on top and in the batter. Not over the top that all you taste. Best way describe it really kick ass pineapple upside down cake just in another form. No need for syrup. The pancake has that much flavor. Oreo and Red Velvet that soooo on radar next visit. 

The service was without doubt FIVE star. We came on soft opening or should say second day open to the public. The full menu still not gone into effect. Our server forget her name was awesome. We even asked moved different table cause ordered  lot of food for two. Never makes for good pictures with natural light all up in your pics. LOL.

Came out quicker than I'd expected( based on other's experiences). Two pieces of chicken hot enough to have just been cooked, the beans and rice side dish was hot but disappointing. In a small dish sat a mound of white rice topped with a tablespoon of beans, no sauce no substance. The mac 'n cheese was lukewarm, at best, not freshly prepared and lacking any distinguishing flavours. I had to put ground centuries ago black pepper on it. The watermelon koolaide in a large mason jar was refreshing, would have preferred cherry but they don't have that either( no liquor license). Ambience?

A $13 stack of pineapple upside down pancakes was advertised as having fresh pineapple on top, but was served plain with several chunks of canned pineapple griddled into the batter. I enjoyed the sweet flavor of this indulgent dessert-for-breakfast, but truth in menu matters.

The child's size serving of mac and cheese was a large bowl for $5 that no one wanted to finish due to its tangy flavor and gooey texture. A few small grey pieces and specks gave away the secret ingredient: cream of mushroom soup... from a can. This is a staple of my mom's signature casserole, Chicken DiVan, but I don't like it in my macaroni.

I sampled the waffle and grits served with my husband's fried chicken, but the grits were unseasoned and covered in butter (or margarine, more likely) and the waffle tasted like cinnamon. It wasn't a bad breakfast and our friendly waitress (Leigh is the name on my receipt) did a great job, but these recipes just aren't for me. I feel like soul food should not be about shortcuts.

My husband got tenders and a waffle, I ordered a waffle sandwich with eggs and cheese, and cheese grits. A couple sat down beside of us, they were almost finished eating by the time someone went to check on our food. The corn fritters came out with our meal...40 minutes after we ordered. They were extremely greasy...I know they were deep fried but the oil temp must have been too low because they were saturated. My sandwich came out incorrect, on Texas toast and i said I had ordered a waffle sandwich and was argued with about what I ordered...broke my personal rule and sent it back (does that look like spit to you?) moments later the sandwich contents had been scraped on top of a soggy, lukewarm waffle and returned to me. The grits were inedible. I grew up south of the Mason Dixon line, and if you also grew up in the south, don't bother ordering these. Paula Dean herself would have said too much butter...and no amount of butter or cheese could have salvaged these, a step above wallpaper paste. 

My husband fared only slightly better; he never got any syrup or condiments, and had to ask for a fork as his silverware was just a knife. He thought the chicken was okay - he compares all Las Vegas chicken to The Chicken Shack, and it was subpar by that standard. He was also disappointed in his waffle.

Even though we were sitting at the bar, no one checked on us or offered us refills, or asked about our meal. It seemed extremely chaotic and unorganized, and I'm not sure how safe it is to have an electrical cord draped over the bar sink.

Their food, however, is not up to par with other chicken and waffles places. I tried this place twice. Once right after they opened, and once last night. I thought that they had opening jitters so I gave them another shot. 

Chicken--- Both times, the smaller pieces (legs and wings) were heavily overcooked. I'm not a chicken cooking expert, but you cant cook a huge breast with tons of meat and a tiny wing with little meat for the same amount of time and expect the same results. One of the pieces last night tasted like it was cooked in old frying grease. 

Waffle- Both times the waffle was OK taste wise. But both times it was cold, not hot at all. 

Sides- Had the cole slaw on my visit last night. Very tasty.

Drinks- On the 1st visit, they did not have their liquor license. Last night, I had the Lo-Lo's Punch (Kool-Aid, Vodka, Pineapple Juice). It was very good.

On my 1st visit they were VERY busy and people were waiting for food. When I went last night, not so busy. The chicken wasn't HOT. They need to find a balance to their demand to keep food hot and fresh.

I ordered banana pudding to go and let's just say it tasted like gross fake banana pudding from a store bought can wasn't impressed at all. Surely didn't look like the online menu I seen.

Everyone on the staff anticipated our needs and it gets no better than that!! The hostess was sweet and offered a high chair for my son and gave a coloring sheet with crayons. She also asked what seating was best given that I had a child with me (on the way out she came from behind the podium to open the door). Our server was GREAT her name was Chevy and she was awesome from the minute we sat down. She offered an extra plate, extra butter, a kids cup and a drink to go. She even apologized for the wait of the food which did take a while even though it didn't seem like they were too busy. 

The only notable minor issue was that a leg that came with my chicken and waffles was under cooked and quickly another server noticed as she walked by. She grabbed a manager who was kind, complementary, and apologetic and immediately brought a new one. Easy peasy! 

I had at least 7 different people ask if I needed anything, tell me my son was cute or offer some sort of assistance. I was even watching tv and someone thought it was a cry for help lol That sort of service is why I tipped 50%.

As far as the food, it was good. The leg was meaty and not overly breaded, the breast was juicy (go ahead and smirk) and the thigh was cooked nicely as well. The waffles were thin yet flavorful and quite delish! A few bites kinda tasted like fried pork skins though which was odd but not worthy of a complaint.

We got greeted and seated very nicely and fast. There wasn't really many people, but im going to assume because it was 2pm. After lunch and right before dinner.

We sat at 2:55pm. Took us about 10 minutes to decide. I ask the waitress what ""grits"" was and she said it was oatmeal. I then googled it.... not oatmeal. Anyways we ordered and waited...for a long time. The waitress made eye contact with us, asked if we needed more water. Not kool-aid, just water. We decided to leave at 350... because we just had waited too long. We didnt know it then but the waitress came and told us they were making our chicken extra chrispy, when im reality she had forgotten to put our order in.

We politely left... the staff and management went above and beyond to bring us back into the restaurant and make a positive experience. We ate for free, food is ok.

First we were greeted by a girl with 4 big ""love bites on her neck. Yuck!!! She seemed a little confused to find us a seat. She told us that she was told not to sit us in a booth because there was no service available in those areas. So we asked to sit in the bar area. She was very hesitant, and was reluctant, but she eventually sat us.

My observation was that their were 4 customers that were very unhappy with the customer service and their waitress, which left in the middle of her service. As for us, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to arrive and take our order. 

Although our waitress was nice, she seemed very overwhelmed. I was confused. There were 4 staff rolling utensils at a snails pace. Chatting on their phones, obviously having words and attitudes with each other. The bartender didn't move from his station. It was apparent that he did not have that many drink orders. I guess he has that ""I am busy, but not really busy routine down."" It was also obvious he loved to flirt with the females. There was around 10 staff members hanging out in the bar area, but only 8 customers, and 1 waitress serving 3 tables.

Got a chance to check out the kitchen. Bingo now I know were are the waitresses are hanging out. It was like they were having a party. So I decided to go on the other side an count the customers. 15 customers in the other sitting area. There was more staff than customers No excuse for the bad customer service.In my opinion, it was obvious that the manager has no control over his employees. He was more a part of the problem than anything. When I can watch more employees walking out of the restaurants with containers of food and drink there are definitely issues. 

We watched how the manager handled the unhappy guest. He did a ""fly by apology"" He seemed more afraid of the customer. He discussed the error, gave a huge discount, and quickly walked away and dived back into the employee drama. Laughing, giggling, and avoiding serious issues with his staff. We finally received our food. Looked delicious but we had no utensils. The waitress that brought our food notice we had no utensils, she walked over to the group of utensil rollers. She picked up a set, then was quickly scolded by one of the staff for taking a set he rolled. So I watched her clean off our utensils and roll it in a napkin. Let me remind you, we are 2 tables away from this action. 

Our original waitress came back and apologize for all the drama. I just wanted my sweet tea refilled. I was so over the high school drama. I will go to LA to Roscoe's if I want really drama. By the way, the food tasted great!!!!",lK-nDdaTfvhuhUowIyOpmw,0,0,3,SdgxsVKPnyeduExprydpSg

I ordered the Chicken fried steak, when it came it had this weird, brown gravy with red and green peppers - almost a Mexican flavor, NOT what I expected...I was expecting the white sausage gravy that every chicken fried steak I have ever had was served with...it was not good.  

It took forever to get our order and longer to get our check.  The service was ok, not great and the food didn't come out hot - maybe the server I don't know...unfortunately we will not be back.

Things did not start well from the moment we walked in. It was about 3:30 PM and the place was clearly not very busy. We stood by the cashier's station with the sign to wait to be seated. And we stood there, and we stood there. Finally a young woman showed up and said she wasn't clocked in yet, but she would seat us and she did. She discovered that the cleared table wasn't wiped off. She got a cloth and wiped the table clean. She repeated that she wasn't on the clock yet, but someone would take care of us. That was the last service we got.

The room we were in had two other booths and one table occupied and one waiter who appeared to be responsible for the one table only, for he doted over that table, but never offered any service to anyone else. Another party was leaving as we entered.

As we were viewing the menu, a second young lady came to take our drink order. We each ordered tea and like magic, the waitress disappeared never to be seen again.

We settled on what we wanted using menus that apparently had never been wiped off and were sticky and waited for the teas and waitress to arrive. In the interim, another party of 4 was seated at a table. They were waited on by another waitress and received their drinks in short order.

And we waited, and we waited. The music was so loud that it was difficult to talk across the table and various employees would wander about with no apparent purpose, some even coming to the room entrance only to turn around and disappear and some wandered through the room as if lost. And we waited while employees appeared to play musical chairs through the room. It appeared to me that the employee's acted as if they were in a social club rather than a place of employment . . . you know, where you work for your employer.

Finally, we left in disgust. The woman cleaning the glass on the front door wished us a good day as we left. Her efforts would have been more profitable if she had she been waiting on customers.

We would have complained to management, but it was clear there wasn't any.

It seems clear that Lo-Lo's doesn't understand who is their competition. We walked across the parking lot to Sweet Tomatoes to eat a very pleasant lunch where the music wasn't blasting, everything was clean and the two of us ate for the price Lo-Lo's wanted for either one of us.

2741687,2016-03-15,14,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"A chicken and waffle place? Based out of Arizona? I know what you're thinking. ""Dont knock it til you try it"" right? 

So I come in on a thursday night about 7:15. Place was not all that busy but enough for the the staff to stay busy. We got a table right away which should be expected for the restaurant was only half full.

As I go over the menu I see that a lot of the food names are in relation to ""Da Hood"". Things like Baby Ray, Betty's Boob, and Tre-Tre's. That's for the chicken choices. I find it funny because when you're in ""Da Hood"", good food usually does not cost an arm and a leg. And it tastes good. What im saying is the food here does not taste good at all. Compared to Roscoe's Lo Lo's chicken does not have as much flavor.

So what I got was the Sheeda's Special ($11) and Fried Okra ($4) and Home Fries ($4). The Sheeda's Special was a chicken breast and wing along with a waffle. The chicken was bland and extra greasy, like they were in a hurry to serve it and didnt really give it enough time for the grease to drain properly. The waffle was plain bad. It was soggy and you can taste some cinnamon mixed into it. Putting a lot of syrup on it almost made it taste ok. Since thats all you get for the Sheeda's Special, I opted to get a the side of fried okra and home fries. The okra was soggy and literally had grease dripping from it. I guess it was the same person who pulled it out of the fryer and didnt give it enough time to drain? The fried okra at Dickey's barbeque was way better. The home fries were tasteless. The only thing I could taste was the onions and green peppers that were cooked with it. The potatoes were dry.

Service was almost non existent. I think I only interacted with my server twice. Once for taking the my order and then the second time bringing out my food. I take that back. Actually 3 times but the 3rd time didnt really count. The iced tea that she gave me literally looked like mud. I took a sip and I swear I could taste tea grounds. So I had her change it out for a diet soda.

Some things I wanna mention. One of the servers there look like they could be a Jonas brother. Only this guy was cut. You guys should take a pic with him and say he was helping out at Lo Lo's that day. After I ordered I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and they were out of paper towels so I mentioned it to one of the servers. After we got done eating about an hour later, I went to wash my hands again and STILL no paper towels. Fail.

Overall, this place is way overpriced, overhyped, and the service is terrible. I am definitely not coming back. On a side note if you want really good chicken and fried catfish, go check out Sunny's Chicken and Fish over towards North Las Vegas off of Lamb and Washington. You can get a 2 piece breast and wing with waffle for $3.99! For the price of a Sheeda's Special you can almost get 3 orders at Sunny's! His chicken and fried catfish taste way better and it is what I use to compare other chicken/waffle/catfish places! Plus the location is actually in a ""hood"" part of town so Lo Lo's got nuthin on this place! Sunny's is probably the best kept secret in regards to great chicken and catfish. If you go, tell him Roger sent you! Matter of fact, I had to go there the very next day just to get over the bad experience at Lo Lo's! I dont usually mention other restaurants in my reviews but in this case I feel bad that you guys are missing out if you havnt been to Sunny's! Plus your wallet will thank you!

2742730,2016-06-27,0,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"Overall, I was underwhelmed. I ordered the LoLo's 3 piece chicken and waffles. If ""chicken and waffles"" is in the name of the restaurant, then it better be the best darn chicken and waffles ever! Sadly, it was the not. The 3 piece was an assortment - drumstick, thigh, and wing. All the pieces where cooked inconsistently. Mostly my impression was dry - the chicken was definitely overcooked. The waffle also did not knock my socks off. Just plain, nothing special, a little soggy. 
I also sampled the cornbread - again not impressed. Dry and lacking flavor. 
Husband ordered the catfish - doesn't seem fresh. For a lack of better description, it had an overly fishy taste and odor. Hard to get over. Won't be ordering that again. 

Also, I hate commenting about service because it just varies with every visit and depends on which waitstaff you get - but this place needs some help. We got seated in the bar area (which we did not choose, the hostess put us there) and there was only one waitress working the entire bar and covering the tables. Who made that call? She was seriously over-extended and unfortunately that meant no service for us. Never got an offer for drink refills (I had to flag down the manager to get this accomplished). And after the food was hastily dropped off, no one came by to check on us once. I pointed out again to the manager how no one was helping us and she did nothing (I also overheard the table next to us making the same complaint to the manager). Nothing was done to correct the situation- the manager just simply made the excuse of servers calling in or showing up late. It's your job to manage the staff and fill in if needed. So bottom line - won't be coming back.",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,1,2,2,2vlI8zR2Ig8HdK6Nn5Zrrg

The hostess was acting as a hostess/busser.  Then it took 20 minutes for someone to come to the table and ask us what we would like.  Since we had some time we decided to order an appetizer and order our food at the same time.   Appetizer came out fine however, our food was another story.  It took over an hour for the dinner to arrive.   While waiting I took my 2 granddaughters to the restroom and when I came back my daughter said they came and packed the leftover appetizer and were ready to give her the check.   She is like wait a minute we haven't received our food. And the waitress seemed confused.  Mind you we ordered Mac and cheese. Grilled cheese fried fish pancakes and biscuits and gravy. Simple meal.  Then an another lady came out and brought our food and we asked if they forgot our order and she did not apologize or seem to care.       I paid for the full meal.  Would I recommend this restaurant to family friends and coworkers.    No, I would not!!!   25 years of the restaurant and hospitality business.

2778573,2016-12-05,3,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"You might not be able to find cheaper chicken and waffles in town. Their menu has a whole page devoted to different variations of the dish, based on the amount and type of chicken and number of waffles. I went with the Lil Amadi at the super low price of $7, consisting of one thigh, one drumstick, and one waffle. The chicken was better than expected with a crunchy, crisp exterior and well seasoned, tender meat underneath. The cinnamon in the waffle was noticeable right away. I could smell it as the plate was being set down in front of me. Thin, with edges slightly crispy, but the overall texture was one of a soft, pliable, chewy waffle. A warm dispenser of maple syrup was provided too. Not a bad meal at all, but far from the top notch versions found elsewhere around town.

One order of cornbread is fairly massive. It's a large muffin topped with a scoop of butter. The bottom and outside edges were firm, while the inside was moist and quite chewy with bits of corn worked in.

The service at the bar was great -- friendly and attentive. The selection of beer, on the other hand, was pretty sad. Beers on tap included Bud, Bud light, a cider and something that was like Busch light. It would have been nice if they could get some local brews for their taps instead. 

This place may not offer the best southern food around, but the price and portion sizes are strong reasons to pay this place a visit.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,9,3,eOkmAC-EGWR5EICaJ6I7fg

My girlfriend and I walked in very excited to try the food out, but as we walked in the party of 4 in front of us was waiting for 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was not busy at the moment and I couldn't understand why they were waiting so long. 

When they were finally seated, the host didn't acknowledge we were standing in the lobby area waiting to be seated as well. She walked away from her post and never came back for another 10 minutes.

I'm usually very patient, but after listening to many complaints of the people waiting I asked the waitress at the bar if we could sit at one of the empty booths. To my demise, she said we had to wait to be seated. There were only 5 tables in the bar area being waited on. I didn't understand why we couldn't sit there. So we waited another 5 minutes and the host finally came back. 

When she cane back we said it was for a party of 2. As she was about to seat us she forgot she had to bring the uber eats driver his delivery and went to the kitchen to get it. 

At this point I was frustrated and we walked out just like the other groups in front of us who did not have as much patience as we did. We didn't even get to try the food. 

This was very disappointing and I do hope one day we can try this place out. If this service keeps up I don't think this restaurant will survive.",_nQrgTdS7asc1045VBcCfw,7,1,1,z0syKp0_djAb8SoJU8E1nw

I was told before they didn't have an alcohol license but thank god when we went they finally had it. Ordered a Melon Mojito, hey it's 5:00 somewhere right? It was pretty good. 

Got our orders right away. I ordered a ""Baby C"" which had your choice of two thighs or two drum sticks with either grits or fries. I decided on the grits added some cheese on top which I really didn't like. The chicken was good tho, really juicy. The beau got waffles so I had some of his and it really did taste like the Infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. 

We also got one of their popular items, Spicy Corn Fritters and everyone who walks through that door needs to try this! It's one of the best things I have ever eaten. The dipping sauce that comes with it just compliments it so much.

I might have tried a few more drinks, but the prices seemed a little high (3.50) this is Vegas. The sweet tea is in a large mason jar, not to sweet. The chicken skin was very crispy, no big flavor rush, but juicy. The waffles have a cake like taste and texture, I'm taking mine home and putting them in the toaster oven. The eggs and grits were well cooked. Everything was on the table for you to make them your own. I tried the shrimp and grits with mushrooms and crispy bacon. I really enjoyed it, but it needed flavor, a little seasoning would have gone a long way or maybe a tasty sauce. The greens were not bitter. I'll have to try more sides I only tasted a little of the greens. Nice large biscuits and corn bread. The banana pudding looked amazing so we took two home. If you are going to do this order it at the table and pack it yourself, the one they pack is much smaller than the gorgeous one they put on the table and it should be half the price. They forgot to put the pudding in mine, so I had vanilla wafers, which are not my thing, with bananas and whipped cream. My Son had pudding in his and said it was really good. He said amazing, but I think it was because I couldn't taste it.

Went here for lunch yesterday. I had Lolo's Punch which is vodka mixed with Kool-aide!! Yes Kool-Aide! Delish!
For lunch I had Sheedas special which came with 2 pieces of chicken (breast &wing) and a waffle.
The waffle was Bomb! Tasted like cinnamon. 
Chicken was hot, fresh and juicy. It was very flavorful, but i do think it needed just a tad bit more salt or seasoning.  I also had a side of yams.  The yams were maybe the best I've tasted. So good!!!
My hubby had the shrimp and grits which he liked, but said they were spicy and the menu did not specify that it was a spicy dish. It was all good though because he likes spicy food. 
All and all I thought the food was really good. I would definitely eat there again. Just took off a 1/2 star because i think the chicken needed more seasoning.  Other than that, really good experience.",NW5x0W7LyBddv3A4OR_MvA,2,1,4,_nO7uUcEE6serYqROqh0Xw

But the waffles and butter are still a bit better at roscoes, they're fluffier. The service was good, took us like 5 to 7 minutes just to get seated, even thought it was really slow. Tons of open tables, the lady in the front was busy with another customers order or something. Took us about 20 or so minutes to get our food. Our server was the bartender, she was sweet. 

The OJ and sweet tea are absolutely delicious. This place has amazing prices and the food is quite good. This place is super similar to roscoes, so if that's what your craving in the vegas area, come.

I also tried their peach cobbler and was really disappointed... Best part of it normally is the crust but their peach cobbler is more like peaches and a spongy bread.. it was really generic.. Frozen cobbler from the store tasted 


Update: 

Came to have breakfast today and don't think well ever come back here again. Everything was just terrible. The host, young Mexican girl had no idea what she was doing. Had people waiting extra long even though there were multiple tables already cleaned and ready to go. The service was worse. Since we waited so long for a table we looked at the menu and already knew what we wanted. So exactly when we sat down we ordered our food. We got our drinks and waited 30 + minutes for our food. Our server stopped by after 30 minutes and finally said she'll check on our food. 

You can tell the whole staff was pretty disorganized and it didn't seem like any of them were properly trained in hospitality and a fast paced restaurant probably being this place is only busy really on the weekends. The runners that were running food were constantly taking food to the wrong tables, didn't know where items were going. It seemed like there were only 2 or 3 servers working and the service was bad. We were never checked on to see how we're doing, if we needed anything... one server that was a different section asked if we were doing ok but that's about it. 

We were honestly about to get up and just leave. We noticed a couple tables next to us were getting frustrated as well. Two tables near us waited 30+ minutes as well for their food as well. And then a table that got sat 15 minutes after us got their food before us.. which was crazy cause we ordered simple stuff, chicken and waffle and catfish basket (which wasn't good btw) and fries (the seasoning was good on them.) We asked for sauces twice, she forgot the first time. And she forgot to bring our hot sauce altogether so we just stole one from another table. 

They should really invest some time into training their staff. Not only will their staff make more money for the restaurant but for themselves as well for learning better service. Our server only visited our table 3 times, greet, 1 check up 30 minutes later and the check. She got a $3 tip. If she checked up on us more often and put some effort into trying to get our food out in a timely manner. It would've been a different story.",VDsnV9Xc-akVbJC0hVtAQw,1,0,1,bh44EvEOJVCnlpm9Zz8urA

In the past I've always been sat in a decent time frame and served within reasonable time as well...HOWEVER the last two times have been ridiculous ... today for example ,
Walking in today I was so excited and ready to eat , there was about 2 people on the wait list in front of me yet was sat 30 min later ....After bruh seated I ordered a mimosa and a berry boob , while my brother ordered Kool-Aid and a DD With two sides of corn bread... the waitress did not check up on us at all, an hour went by and I actually got up and asked a different waitress for some help as we had been siting in the resurgent for over an HOUR and not even our drinks had even served to us.
A few minutes later the food came out and we were brought water . We never got the corn bread or the mimosa so once AGAIN I had to go hunt down a different waitress for help.

This whole situation doesn't even describe the food the only good thing about Lolo's is there chicken I thought it was a very very good I don't understand why their grades aren't smooth they are kind of like a just a hockey puck they were just hard on their eggs were over scrambled the potatoes were fried but they were like dry and then the fish had more batter on it than fish itself.

We'll start with the Pros:
- Fried Green Tomatoes were very good.
- Sweet Tea was delicious.
- Restaurant interior was very nice.
- Fried Chicken was tender.
- Good portion size.

Now the Cons:
- Too much breading on the Fried Chicken
- Never offered any drink refills.
- Our waiter, who was a ""supervisor"", had to ask us 3 times what our order was.
- Several other waiters were arguing in the back corner of the restaurant (about 10 feet from our table)
- I've never been to a restaurant, until now, where waiters were sitting around eating food while their customers were waiting for the check (they actually seemed over-staffed).
- The Collard Greens looked like they came out of can.
- The Cole Slaw had no flavor.
- The fries tasted like store-bought fries (for an additional $2), which our waiter said would be amazing.
- When asked what type of fries they had, our waiter's response was ""french fries"" (and he wasn't joking).

The Health Inspection Rating of a B should have been my first warning that this was not going to be the experience I had hoped for.

I don't think the couple across from us was having a good experience either, as the gentlemen was questioning the freshness of the dessert he was given in a to-go container, asking several times if it was made fresh today, and all the server could say was that it was put in that container today.",1L57cV8hRVZwh36RLk1IvA,2,0,1,EW-il_ca5U7k6RikwwlmAQ

After waiting to be seated our food took at least an hour and then was missing things.  They did not have everything on the menu and kept having to substitute because for example mash potatoes weren't done or there was no more French fries.  Then there was no banana pudding or red velvet cake left either and it was 3pm.  The chicken was very good and cooked just right as well as mainly of the other dishes.  Most of the problems are easily fixed and maybe after the place is own a little longer they will make sure they keep the sides on deck and always have the desserts.

First off they don't have their liquor license yet. I'm okay with that. My husband ordered the KK and I ordered a burger (well done). When we got our food the first thing I notice was my fries were cold. My husband's waffles and chicken were cold too. We didn't want to complain so we just started to eat. Well I always cut my burger when I ask for well done and it wasn't well done. I also asked for no tomatoes but it was on there. I asked if she could have them redo my burger...20 minutes later no burger..my husband was done with his food and I was just over it. They need more servers. They have A LOT of bus people but need more servers. The manager was called out three times before we left. We spoke with the manager and he stated he would take off the burger and bring our ticket. 15  minutes later no ticket. Our waitress comes and tells us that he just said everything was on the house because of the burger. That would have been good to know like 10 minutes ago.

I heard about the long waits, so I decided to come mid-day to possibly get seated faster. Nope. Took an hour to sit TWO people and a toddler. I knew that I was going to wait no matter what when I arrived and they were frantically writing everyone's name on a notepad like they we're a journalist  jotting down fresh ideas. 

After an hour of waiting even though they said it would be 30 minutes we finally get seated. Me and my sister asked the waiter a few simple questions but he didn't know the differences in the combo meals. I felt like I was answering my own questions. (All good, It just opened I understood) but when asked what plates are more filling, he was clueless - that was a question I couldn't answer myself -- but ultimately we made sense of it and ordered. 

30 minutes go by and we begin to see people looking just as clueless as to where their order is as we were. The people who started verbally complaining began to get their orders.  I would have jumped on that train if I could've found my waiter. 40 minutes went by before he whizzed past our table and said ""foods coming"" without stopping.  We finally catch him 10 minutes later and ask him ""what's up, man?"" He goes back to the kitchen. Another lady comes and tells us ""It's coming"". Finally after an HOUR the food comes... Freezing COLD. The waffle was soggy and COLD. Fries COLD. Okra COLD. The fish and chicken were the only two somewhat warm items. The chicken appeared to be friend a bit long  but was still good. (Heads up, the chicken is the only positive thing in this review) The catfish was flat out was rubbish. I've had better fish at Golden Corrals buffet. Mind you we are with a toddler who hadn't gotten their food yet. Her plate came out 5 minutes after ours. So I ate cold food with a crying a baby for the first part of the meal. Thanks Lolo's. 

Another waiter passed by and asked ""how was everything?""
 -everything was cold
 Sir, why didn't you send it back? 
 - I don't think I could have lasted another hour waiting. 
He gave me a look like, ""touché""

I don't know if I will ever return here, that's something for me and my love for fried chicken to figure out but If I do they will definitely have to wait like they made me wait. So maybe next year. Hopefully they have it together by then.",kcPu4K_ZfI3tr-jrCd5ymA,12,2,1,myP517Gbgq_u2PnAlvYOpQ

The good- ice tea and corn fritters

The bad- catfish had no flavor except for the horrible taste of belly meat that is a sign of cheap fish. That can often be made up for with some good seasoning. This had no seasoning. I grew up in Mississippi. We know our catfish. Boyfriends chicken tenders were dry and flavorless just like the fish. 

Our server was excellent. I'm sorry he has to work in a place with such horrible food. He did take our entrees off when he saw we barely touched them. We made sure to tip him well, not his fault the food is crap.

That being said it was obviously crowded, and I knew there was going to be a wait because friends had gone the night before so I went in with patience.  There was five of us total.  We arrived around 1 o'clock and were lucky enough to find seating at the bar.  They don't have their liquor license yet so between us ice tea and diet soda was ordered. We did have the option to eat at the bar but we preferred waiting for a table.  After about an hour we checked to see where our name was on the list and apparently it had been called and we missed it.  Considering how crowded it was and the noise level the hostess needs to make a better effort of calling out names or getting some sort of mic system.  We had just missed it so they sat us next.  This was about 2 o'clock.  Our waitress told us that due to the crowds the wait time from ordering our food to receiving it  would be about 30-35 minutes.  We all ordered immediately since we had an hour at the bar to watch plates come out and peruse the menu.  An hour passed and our food came out.  My table mates were getting a little ancy at this point.  

I ordered the KK's.  Three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs and grits.  The chicken is fried to perfection but also perfectly juicy.  I ordered it with breast, thigh, and wing, but it came with two wings, so not sure if I got lucky or if that's the way it comes out.  Can't go wrong with scrambled eggs with cheese and onions.  The grits were a little watery but not a deal breaker.  The waffles had a cinnamon flavor to them that I also enjoyed.  Someone else at the table commented that they would have preferred more crisp waffles but I think that's a personal preference.  Previous to that I had sampled the fried green tomatoes ordered for the table with a honey mustard type of dip.  Those I would order a again for sure.  The portions are very generous so next time I might change my chicken selection or get a to-go box as I did this time.  

Service was attentive and we learned a little bit about the history of LoLo's.  Because of the wait one of my table mates did ask to speak to a manager and a more than fair discount was given so props to management for being so apologetic about the wait even though it was to be expected.  I will definitely be returning after a few weeks when the crowds die down but most likely not on a Sunday because that appears to be a just out of church crowd which probably even once it dies down those larger parties will continue to flock there on Sundays.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,27,21,4,v_LEFgpks-EItr52yjsbJA

Waffles need work...oh, lose the cinnamon too...French Toast? yes, in the waffles?  No...I like waffles with a crisp outside. Not a fan of Lo-Lo's version. Tasted like a cinnamon pancake in the form of a waffle. YUCK!

Sis in law ordered a side of mac and cheese to try, and it wasn't all that...Cornbread was huge, but dry...avoid

Employees appears to not be fully trained. Almost seems like they're unsure of themselves or overwhelmed... even when not busy. One young black male, maybe early to mid 20s. Worked the front counter and you could tell he was confident & knowledgable. He was pleasant & actually explained what a particular dish was. 
The one time I dined in, the waitress kept forgetting small things ie biscuit, to refill our water, etc. When she handed us our check, she actually stood at our table to wait for us to sign the check. I was there w/a old friend that was here from out of town so we were chatting away. We looked up and I reminded the waitress again that we needed togo containers. It was extremely awards & a lil embarrassing that two 43yo women were treated as if we were going to dine & dash.

The restaurant was very well put together, clean, and very cute. I liked the family pictures on the wall, it added a nice touch of soul and provided a more southern feeling.  I'm from Oklahoma so coming to Las Vegas and seeing things like that was very homey for me. Anyways it was the Saturday before Halloween and the place was not crowded AT ALL. We got sat immediately in a comfortable booth. Now I won't lie it took a little bit for us to get addressed by a server but our server (Jael possible?) was so nice and attentive we forgot all about that.
 

We were recommended by a friend, and she said the chicken and waffles and koolaid were the best. So that's exactly what we ordered. My friend ordered the watermelon koolaid and I ordered the fruit punch and a Tre- Tre with a side of mac and cheese for us to share. They came out in huge mason jars! So delicious. Not exactly like mama makes it but close enough. Whats funny is is that the server said most people cant get through on jar because its so sweet. (she has never met my sweet tooth obviously because I had two). Our food arrived shortly after that (minus the mac and cheese which we actually forgot about when we tasted our food). Man! That waffle was so crispy on the outside but soft and light in the inside. The syrup they gave us just soaked into the waffle perfect. That with the crispyness and saltiness of the drumstick just made my entire night so worth it. I was so engulfed in my chicken and waffles I actually forgot about the mac and cheese until our server brought over two complimentary because we had to wait so long! WOW. After both of our plates were demolished we just sat back and sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction. We kept looking st the menu to see what we were going to order the next time we come.

Did I mention the eggs come with cheese and onions . Prices are very reasonable .... We had a wonderful waitress who was very friendly and interacting with my kids. We. Were a party of 9 and were seated right away. The kool aid was great .. This place deserved the 5 stars.. Will definitely come back again when visiting  Las Vegas . Atmosphere is great . They have Tv and also play good music . This place is 10x better then roscoes chicken and waffles,xjgv4LRX-Oi7xHeVeZul0Q,0,0,5,C05-XlEpD9vn88bhkrbuXw
3669488,2016-12-04,0,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"I had a horrible experience at Lo-Lo's on Rainbow in Las Vegas today, December 4th between 10:30 am and 11:50 am. The food is normally ok and I've never had any issues here prior to this date but this time it was bad.. After placing an order for 3, we waited for our food for an hour. The restaurant did not appear to be busy. At this point, we spoke with a manager. I was told that his name is Doug, however he was not wearing a name tag of any sort. After hearing our complaint, Doug said ""I'm getting it out now"" and he walked away. I waited 7 minutes and I was extremely irritated and had lost my appetite so we told our server that we will pay for our drinks but we were leaving. She told us not to worry about the drinks and that she would cancel the order. On the way out, I asked to speak to the manager again. He walked up with an attitude and I told him that we decided to leave, we waited too long, others that had arrived after us were served before us and that this experience was bad. He replied ""I told you it was in the window and coming out and y'all decided to leave so...."". Our server had checked on us after the first time we had spoken with the manager, so if that was true, how long was our food going to be just sitting in the window? Why wasn't it brought to our table?! I told the manager we still continued to wait and that was unacceptable. He replied ""Well if your server put the ticket in late, she put it in late."" I responded ""What do you mean? You are the manager!"" He then asked ""Well what you want me to do?!"" I couldn't take his unprofessional attitude anymore so I walked off and he did too. Our server, who witnessed all of this, along with a hostess did apologize as we walked out. This manager is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with! The situation was poorly handled and he has a bad attitude. He clearly does not belong in the customer service field. I wasted almost an hour and a half of my morning here and left pissed off! That visit was most likely my last.",2emOo0WH3GRlHwdk_kmvMQ,1,0,1,90WjXtZm-ssJl99_iibZGA

My boyfriend and I met up with our friends here (a total of 7 of us) and honestly, the only thing that's making me want to not come back is the wait. I mean, I get it it's pretty new so all the hype is there and all, but when other bigger parties are coming in after you and getting seated before you, that's ridiculous. 
We got there at 7pm and finished at 11pm. My friends and I had waited an hour or two to actually get a table, then we were able to order our drinks and food right away, and we waited another hour or so just to get our food. And while we were waiting for our food, other people who had been there a shorter time than us were complaining that they hadn't received their food. The workers there are okay and this experience wouldn't have been worth it if it weren't for our server, Joanne? She made sure we were okay and had told us that things were crazy in the back (which it was pretty insane considering our table had been moved inside and close to the kitchen).

I just feel like this place could have so much potential if everyone knew what was going on. Some of the hostesses were getting frustrated at how busy it got and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who could tell. It seemed like some of the servers didn't know what was going on in the back and the kitchen staff just seemed all over the place.

Husband had ""CHYNA'S HONEY HOTS"" which is 6 wings splashed with Chyna's honey & hot sauce combo, served with ranch. 

Rosa was our server and did such a lovely job. She was on top of everything we requested and the manager Jeff came over and thanked us for our service after we asked for military discount. That was very nice.

My husband ordered a beer took longer then usual to receive no worries. I ordered a salad asked to substitute the cherry tomatoes out for just a slice or two tomatoes (like what they use for their burgers) was told no substitutes can be made on salads. No worries just skip the tomatoes then I don't want them. Our food arrived and our server came back to let us know ""you're going to hate me but we don't have ranch"" okay no problem do you have honey mustard? ""No."" I get it is soul food but it's still a restaurant offering salad and chicken..... There needs to be more then balsamic dressing available. Not that dressing is the end of the world but I decided not to have dinner with my family because I didn't have any. My salad did however have those cherry tomatoes I asked specifically not to have. The chicken was extremely salty and I was given a box to bring mine home. I don't plan on going back which is a shame because we truly enjoy dinning at new places.

3768399,2018-01-03,0,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"I'm giving this a 3 star only because of the 1 not so great experience I had today. 

Im a multiple time returning customer, I used to live around the corner for about a year or so and I would visit Lo-Lo's all the time. I've never had a problem with this place until I came in today with my father in law. I was embarrassed because I pumped Lo-Lo's up by telling him, that in my opinion Lo-Lo's was better than Roscoes. 

It all began as soon as we got there, I should've noticed the red flag and turned away today. But I didn't, even after overhearing a gentle grieve over the fact that he called the day before to confirm the restaurant had his credit (in which they said they did). Not to find out that when he returned the following day it was no where to be found. 

When we were finally seated, it took about 17 minutes for the only waitress (Dre or Drai) to address us by saying she would be right with us. The poor thing wasn't able to get back to us until roughly 30 minutes after we were seated to take our order. I asked her if she had any help and she said she was the only one working today. 

So 20-30 minutes after we placed our order our waitress (Dre or Drai) came out to inform us that our grits wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes. I don't about anyone else but I was raised on grits and they take max 10 Mins to make. So after waiting for our food for 40-50 Mins it finally came out. The waffles were subpar at best this time, but everything else was solid. 

To say the least our waitress was great minus the fact that she didn't have any help for majority of the morning. The manager could've been and should've been way more proactive in helping his employees out. I dont know exactly what he duties are but I'm assuming, ownership wants the guest to have the best experience possible so that they don't leave wanting to write a review like this. 

I would normally suggest Lo-Lo's to all of my friends and family that visit Las Vegas but I'm not sure that I want to send anyone else that way because i don't want to sign off on a place if they're going to continue service of such.",QuUZXXrNDj9Pn0lBU9EQkA,1,0,3,wgY4TOFxbLM8LExDmjpalQ

For one the sweet tea was a mason jar of sugar, then they gave me the wrong order, it took about 20 to get my food right, there was a hair on my yams, and the rice was not cooked through. Not only that but our waitress Jazmin was hitting on my man. My boyfriend was like, what is this girl doing??!?! Point is I was starving and ended up not eating cause I was grossed out and dissapointed. The manager said, ""give it sometime it'll get better.""

My husband  ordered  the lolos special which was the waffles and chicken. My niece had the shrimp and grits and my sister in law had the salmon  croquette  salad. The food took probably 40 minutes to come out and again a diffrent waitress brought it out. The place was not  busy  at the time so were surprised  that our drinks and food took a long time. The food was just ok. My pancakes had banana slices but no caramel.  The grits had a weird  after taste but the shrimp  was good. The salmon salad was just ok and the chicken and waffles  was also just ok. No one check to see if we needed a refill. The tables close to us was also looking  for any waitresses for refills. When we finally  saw a waitress  we ask if we could  get our  bill and her response  was "" sorry I'm  not your waitress"" so we flagged our waitress. I wont be coming  back to this establishment.

Service 2 of 5

A little on the slower side, not very attentive. Had to spend a few minutes trying to get the servers attention a few times. Food comes out slow but gives you more time to grasp hold of the decor.

Drinks 1 of 5

Ordered a Bloody Bacon Mary, extremely over seasoned but lacked one thing... Oh yeah alcohol.

Food 2 of 5 
Chicken and Waffles was just ok. Waffles were extremely soggy and the chicken was a little over cooked for my taste with an overpowering amount of sodium. I had to ditch most of the breading and go straight for the chicken. Would have been nice to have a choice of how your eggs are cooked, instead the scramble it then throw some raw onions in it with some cheese. Definitely a pass on those. The grits were so so, drowned in a lot of butter and love. 

Catfish appetizer wasn't that exciting either..

Overall you need a hole in the wall place for good soul food. This feels like a Roscoe and Applebee's had a bastard step child that tries to be a little to fancy. Really nothing drawing me back to this place.",vr6yQzmtC1MNM57tjJ-J0Q,5,3,2,BIjMKcY4jeBIHYA7UB845Q

My waitress went above a beyond to change out my waffles after she split syrup all over it making her way to the table and the new waffles came fast.

The first time I came in (which was not too long after they first opened up), I was excited to try chicken and waffles.  I had never had it before and was anxious to see what the fuss was about.  I ordered not only the chicken and waffles, but got gravy on mine - it seemed like the deluxe way to go.  The problem is, I didn't care for it at all. 

The next time, I tried the chicken and waffles without the gravy, wondering if I ruined it the first time and just wasn't a gravy fan.  Again, I didn't really care for the meal.  I didn't like the chicken and I didn't like the waffles either..I like my waffles with a slight crisp to them and these were more like pancakes with waffle shapes.

I also have mixed reviews on the staff as well, but I must say the first time, the staff wasn't all that friendly and the second time, the staff was super friendly.  I will attribute the first time to a bad day and we'll call it good there.

Overall, I guess things are ""OK"" here as the ratings suggest, but I guess I'm just one of those folks that doesn't like chicken and waffles.  Thus for me, it's a mediocre experience and nothing I would get excited about returning for.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,0,3,esZqcZLMk3Ipfb2fommJjg

It took almost 20 mins to get a drink at the bar........that was empty!!! When we eventually were seated at the table, we didn't even need to take a look at the menu since we had so much time to review it and decide what we wanted while we waited for our table.

We waited 20-30 minutes for a waiter to take our drink orders and another 30 minutes to take our food orders, and still another 30 minutes to get our food. We ordered meals and most food was brought out a la carte and charged that way. To be fair, the waitress was really new and inexperienced. She didn't seem very familiar with the menu and a bit disorganized. I don't completely blame her. There was a lot of wait staff walking around but didn't seem to be aware of customers waiting. Didn't seem like a good team effort to help each other out.

8:18 the host took our drink order and food order. The girl who we would learn at the end was our server, pointed to us and told him to take our order. I don't think she likes us. She doesn't make eye contact. We did just come from watching a baseball game so maybe it's because we are dirty or smell? Can't tell.

8:27 we get our drinks. 

8:33 we are told by the host that they are out of the Malaysia burger. So we order a chicken tender basket. Still no sign or word from our server.

8:43 the manager, Nate, refilled my drink and my sons. He also told us that they are out of the Malaysia burger.  We were tempted to mess with him and act completely shocked but decided that we didn't want to confuse them all more since this was becoming a train wreck. We told him that we changed it to the tender basket. We informed him we haven't met our server yet. He goes back the kitchen and starts yelling a woman's name. 

8:45 the other server (who's name we learn is Kiki) brings out two boys get their tender baskets. Food looks amazing. For real.
As the boys are eating and Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" comes on. While this type of music is what helped with the boys coming into the world, not the best song choices for a 3, 10, 11 year old. 

8:52 Kiki comes over and asks what my wife and youngest ordered. Wife contemplates whether she should risk telling them what she ordered, tell them to forget it, or start messing with them. At this point we want to get out of there. Since we will never come back, she decides to try it since we are there.  We tell her to forget the order for the youngest. He was oblivious and wouldn't have liked the mac and cheese. He's picky. 

9:00 Kiki brings my wife her food. Looks like they put a frozen breakfast meal on a plate. The waffle looks like a crepe and the eggs look like a tube of yellow sponge. She wasn't happy with it and it didn't look that good. Our server still hasn't been to the table. She has been to the 3 other tables in our area to get their drinks and food and bring bills but not us. I'm beginning to get a complex and think it's because I stink, I'm ugly, or I some how offended her in another life and she remembers. Regardless, she sucks. 

9:10 my wife is done, we are all done. Since our server is now deliberately doing everything possible to ignore us and isn't hiding the fact we have somehow offended her to the point that she is refusing any and all interaction, my wife goes and gets containers from the counter where the registers are since we apparently have the plague and can't get help. 

9:13 kiki walks by so I ask the name of our server.  She tells me it's Mimi. We inform Kiki that we haven't met Mimi at all. Kiki acts appalled but she has to know that Mimi sucks and doesn't want to admit it. Kiki tries to mitigate Mimi's total suckage by saying it's because she is new.  I'm not buying it. I thought Kiki was cool but now I think that Mimi has roped her into her little devious mindgame that Mimi is in the end stage of executing but I'm on to her. Kiki goes to tell Mimi the jig is up and we want our bill. 

9:15 Mimi makes her grand appearance. When my wife informs Mimi that everyone else did her job and we didn't see her at all. Mimi confidently replies that its ""because I didn't get a chance to come over.""  She says it with gusto and without the slightest hint of apology or acknowledgement of her awfulness. She never apologizes and appears oblivious to the fact that she didn't do her job and openly admitted it like it was no big deal. She hands us our bill with a smile like her boo boo don't stink and asks if everything is right. That takes some gumption man. You are our server and the fact you don't know our order and have to ask us to verify its veracity is the pinnacle of trash. And the kicker of it all is that they still had that dang Malaysia burger on it as well as the mac and cheese we order for our youngest but canceled. They also had the tender basket we ordered as a replacement for the Malaysia burger. My wife pointed it out and she went to fix it. We learned that Mimi is actually named Mishiawna. I've been deceived again. This place lures you in and disappoints you like a blind date that has a good personality. So Mimi brings the ""corrected bill"" and while the mac and cheese was taken off, the stupid Malaysia burger was still on the bill. So we point it out again and she goes and fixes it, again. So we get the bill for a third time and its finally right. Mimi tries to hang around like we are old friends, i'm sure to see the giant tip she is expecting, and I look at her like she just kicked my dog and flicked a booger at me. She then scurries away to the hole she was hiding in all night. I promptly sign the receipt and we leave, never to return.",YoijcOhj_nrO0BE1_AFFuw,0,0,1,OPyF6BRxb2iMOmvl_7nq6A

4236931,2016-08-23,2,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"My charge nurse recommended this place since I live about 10 minutes away from it and that her family just loves Chicken and Waffles. So I tried going on a Wednesday after my night shift and to my dismay found out they open at 9. I got there at 8:30 and wasn't planning on staying for another 30 minutes since I'm already sleepy. So I gave it another go on Friday.

The place was roomy. It has a bar on the middle which was pretty spacious. Multiple screen TVs where you can get your sports on if you happen to fancy eating waffles and drinking beer at the same time while watching the Olympics. I was seated on a booth (to my surprise) and the place wasn't as busy when I went (which was good). 

I forgot the servers name but he was really nice. He looked like he had a busy morning because even with only two customers he was huffing and puffing. The menu had plenty to offer. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or a combination of the two or three if you wish. I went ahead and ordered Lolo's Chicken and Waffles since well that's what I came for. I saw from reviews that they also liked the Banana Pudding so I ordered that one too.

On to the food. The Waffles were soft, a hint of Cinnamon is there but not overpowering. The butter they served with it was perfect and just made me smile seeing that gold turn to liquid (yeah I'm a fat ***). To my surprise it was the chef that served the food to me! I mean I'm sorry if I put everybody on an inconvenience by going there for lunch. Either that or he was just happy to serve the food he made. But he looked really nervous for some reason. I don't bite. Well not unless your food that is *wink*. So he told me he'd be back with syrup and yes he did. The syrup was warm and went perfectly with the waffles. It was good but I was never really into waffles or had not had too many growing up so there wasn't really anything for me to compare it too. But the taste was just right. There wasn't any after taste or anything that you would usually get if the batter came from a box. And no I'm not saying it came from a box. I'm just saying the ones that come from a box have aftertaste is all. I know very well they make theirs from scratch. Which is a good thing.

The chicken!!! Okay so I'm a big fan of fried chicken. And growing up having been a patron of another restaurant I have a lot to say about Lolo's fried chicken. First of all they are big! As in it looks like they gave me the whole chicken with the three piece I got. All that was missing was the head. The portion is good for someone who's about ready to eat a horse but I believe I ordered too much for my appetite this time around. The skin was crispy but needs a little salting on some parts of the chicken. The taste didn't overpower the waffles and actually went great with them. The meat was tender and became very addicting as I dug through and through. It didn't compare to previous ones that I've had but it paired nicely with the soft waffles they made. But like I said it was just way too much for my appetite this time around and actually had to take some to go (and my fat *** always finishes a plate). That's just how much their servings are.

The banana pudding then comes around and the presentation was really nice. It was served on a Mason Jar with whipped cream on top with tiny butter cookies. It wasn't too sweet and kind of reminds me of bread pudding and was wondering whether the banana is mixed in the pudding or was it just the banana slices that were giving the taste. In my opinion it needed more banana slices. I just had way too much food to start off with so I wasn't able to finish the dessert.

Overall I would say I need a second trip to this place or maybe even a third. But it probably would not be on the top of my list if I have a hankering for Chicken and Waffles. The place has a nice ambience to it and almost feels like a fancy diner where you get to sip wine with your dinner and waffles or drink beer with your breakfast and of course waffles. Waffles, waffles, waffles haha.",34AkcX5nFt12oE5-Sfx-Nw,1,0,3,GwPoDsDQirceTyR68okMPQ

Upon entering you are greeted by the amazing group of hosts, they ask if you've been to Lo-Lo's before and are super welcoming. The decor here is amazing, brick and cool gray flooring. The middle you have a bar with huge tvs, and there is outside seating available. 

Tonight is the soft opening,  so the menu isn't as huge, but they will start serving full menu 1/29 Friday. Only the best items were chosen :) we opted for the #7 toy toy, 2 wings and a waffle. I got the chicken dinner,  three pieces with 2 sides and and corn bread... figured I'd eat off Santiago's waffle! Lol. 

The chicken: The chicken is amazing! Its soooooo succulent and fresh! The breading is insane, perfect, not overly greasy and perfect! Did I mention, perfect? The chicken portions are large! I ordered the dinner and was able to take half of it home. The sides I got were the mac and cheese, and red beans and rice. Mac and cheese was yummy, and to begin with I'm not a red beans and rice fan, but they were good. The corn bread is seriously the best I've tasted! It has actual corn in it and the crust is insane! DELICIOUS!

THE WAFFLES! THE BIG WINNER HERE! They are OUTSTANDING! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! Like pillows of heaven in your mouth!

The servers here are definitely ready to work and make sure you're fully taken care of, our server was super great and actually spoke to us and cracked a joke! Rory and Semaj are seriously great!!

Me and my family haven't been there in year prior to our recent visit yesterday. We got there at 10am Saturday had to wait over 30 mins to be seated due only two waitress working. While we were waiting their it a  was influx of people walking in on a Saturday morning. Everyone  was asking why is their only two waitress working right now on a weekend?  Also the host kept asking everyone were they over 21 so that people can be placed at  bar . We finally got seated outside and or waitress took 20 mins before she even got to us and keep in mind their was only three of seating outside. Finally order our food and the waitress didn't even check up on us we had to grab our own napkins and salt and pepper ( as well as hot sauce) she had no personality barely even talked to us. I had to get her attention to send my chicken back because it had hair on it still. Once she picked up our plates she didn't even say anything if we needed a to go box or was the food good. NOTHING! So I just sat there and waited on my phone until she asked me did I need a to go box after the second time she can back to get our checks. The food was ok waffles were soggy very disappointed. We eat out around the world so we are very knowledgeable about great customer service. Debra who wasn't even our waitress came around and asked if we were ok and told us to come back and ask for her.

I had 3 fried chicken wings with 2 waffles. The chicken was fried to an excellent crisp however it could have used more flavor. The cinnamon infused waffles were perfect! 

We had great service from our server Sparky. He had a lot of energy and a fun personality. His drink pitch enticed me to order a watermelon Kool Aid! I hadn't had Kool Aid in years. It was awesome and tasted like watermelon Jolly Rancher!

If it's souther style to give extremely bad service this place has nailed it. I sat in the bar area on a very slow Monday afternoon. After being seated by the hostess I sate there for 5 to 8 mins before even being greater by the wait staff. When the waitress finally came over there was no warm greeting or smiling face. I was obviously a burden in her very slow day. I waited another 5 mins to get my diet coke and the food came out shortly after. That was the only thing that did happen fast. 

The food came out a little too quickly. Like maybe it had been precooked and was sitting and waiting under a heat lamp.  It tasted like it had been too. The fries were stale and a few were very hard, like they were a day old. The batter on the chicken strips had little to know flavor. I had to drench them in hot sauce  and ranch dressing to get them down. The white brest meat inside was nice and juicy but all that flavorless dry batter was too much. 

The whole time I was there, about 40 mins the waitress only came over that one time, to take my order. I was so tired of waiting for the check that I got up and went to the hostess stand and had them get it for me. Needless to say i left a 0 tip and never in life have I left a 0 tip. 

It's you're choice, of course, but I would never recommend this place to anyone unless they want overpriced flavorless food and extremely bad service.",s51lP2trxzOoGT-WuzKtbg,2,0,3,RhvxulC2F6WwGdGyWDjx0g

4395426,2016-05-21,5,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"A couple of people at work raved about how Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles made it's way to Vegas and I had to give it a try.

I came on Friday around 3 and luckily that's when their Happy Hour starts!  (HH 3-6PM). Appetizers are $5 (except for the catfish beignets) and draft beer is $1 off.  We started off with some catfish beignets and fried gizzards.  And I opted for their namesake Lo-Lo's, which comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles.  

Catfish beignets: Large pieces of flakey catfish, with a nice crisp breading.  It comes with a dipping sauce that tastes like thousand islands dressing, but the best way to eat it is to douse it in hot sauce!  

Fried gizzards: Definitely an acquired taste if you aren't used to it.  It's a little chewy.  I didn't care too much for it because I was all over the catfish.  

Lo-Lo's: The 3 pieces of chicken were huge!  1 large chicken breast was enough to fill me up.   The breading was a little too salty for my taste, so I ripped off the skin and went straight to the meat.  The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly (after getting past all the breading).  The waffles were a bit soggy (before adding any syrup).  I wish they toasted it a little longer to crisp it up.  All in all, soggy waffles wouldn't deter me from enjoying my meal.  Flavor was great!  I loved how the chicken paired well with the hint of cinnamon in the syrup and butteriness from the waffles.  

All in all, the food was just okay for me.  Service was a little slow despite the restaurant being empty.  My favorite part of the meal was enjoying old school R&B playing in the background.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,13,6,3,ZNQ358dx8XlI2oE5JUQAFQ
4401320,2016-02-01,3,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"Warning: DO NOT make the same mistake I did! A huge mistake we did was coming to this place on a Sunday afternoon so close to the opening of this place. It also seemed like, from the way all the patrons were dressed, that most might have been coming from Sunday mass/church, so lots of families and large parties were waiting.

We had an estimated wait of 45 minutes for our party of 5 when we arrived around 11:45AM but actually ended up waiting about an hour to be seated. After that, it took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Overall, service was very slow. It was understandable given how PACKED this place was. People were surrounding the restaurant waiting for the table, and you had to be present to hear your name being called over the mic. 

If you can avoid it, I would certainly advise against dining here on a Sunday afternoon.

After we were seated, Leigh, our server, greeted us and gave us our menus. 

Service 3.5/5 
I really have to hand it to her... that place seemed chaotic but she was doing a fine job in refilling my friend's coffee and giving us updates when our food was being prepared. I can't really accurately rate the service due to high volume activity, but I did feel like Leigh was trying her best.

Food 4/5
We ordered drinks first. They had kool-aid on tap (offered in grape, blue, and fruit punch). I chose the fruit punch but it was waaaayyyy too sweet so I had to really water it down to drink it comfortably. My friend ordered a lemonade and had to water hers down too, so be aware of over sugared drinks (to be expected in a soul food restaurant, I suppose?) Two of my friends ordered an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened iced tea and I really enjoyed it -- probably would be my choice of drink for the next visit.

I ordered the Baby Ray which came with 3 chicken pieces and 2 waffles. The chicken was drenched in gravy with some semi-carmelized onions as a topping. The gravy had what I believe was a hint of bell pepper to taste (I really hate the taste of bell peppers but this was tolerable). I ended up only being able to finish the thigh and wing part of the chicken. 

I only finished the thigh and wing part because the breast was not only way too much food for me, but it was also too dry.

Waffles were perfectly made and also quite large. I was able to finish 1 1/2 out of the 2 waffles. All this food was actually way too much and definitely put me in a food coma. Do note that I came here on an empty stomach and waited 1.5 hours to actually eat.

Ambience 5/5
Southern style everything! Mason jar cups, mason jar chandeliers... super super cute! I didn't have too much time to examine the restaurant but it was very upbeat and busy. Despite the amount of people in the restaurant and the noise level, I was able to hold conversations with my table which is great. I've been to restaurants that were just as packed but I wouldn't be able to hear the person next to me.

I also saw that they had an outside area, covered of course, which I would love to try when it gets a little warmer out.

The service was great. Everyone was super friendly and the music in the background was enjoyable as well.

I have to warn people though, they will not seat you unless everyone at your party is present.  There were six of us that met there and one of the ladies was parking her car., we informed the hostess that she was parking and she will just join us at our seat but she said that they will not seat us unless we were all together.

I saw how angry some yelpers were because of the wait on the weekend, so we went during the weekday, and we were seated right away both visits. 

I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles. This is their specialty and for good reason. They know what they are doing with fried chicken. The waffles have way to much cinnamon for my taste, but a quality dish never the less. I saw the biscuits and gravy they were serving, that looked amazing,  and thought that the chicken fried steak dinner would have the same type of white gravy. So we made plans to come for dinner just a couple of days later.

The chicken fried steak was not my favorite........ I got the whipped potatoes and red beans and rice as my sides. The chicken fried steak was a quality product in and of itself. It was tender and the breading was good, but I really didn't care for the gravy at all. It was a brown gravy and not very savory and flavorful at all. I really didn't care for the sides either. The potatoes were very strange, not at all like mashed potatoes that I was hoping for. 
My husband had the DVZ's Hot Ghetto Mess for dinner. It is 6 wings with Chicago Style Sauce served over white bread, and a he added a side of mac and cheese.
I did taste my husband's mac and cheese, and it was good. It has a little kick to it with the added black pepper they use. 
My husband liked the wings, and was glad he ordered the sauce on the side. 

I really recommend the chicken and waffles, and probably sticking with the breakfast items. Those were our favorites and it is more their specialty.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,2,1,3,AYSyeRMdfsiVLtFjMy17zg

5/27/18 First time back in forever and there's a line that took some time to move through. I was confused as to why, but the young lady in front is taking the names and seating the people as well. She finally gets to us and I tell her we're a party of 9. She then tells me they'll set up the table and it'll be 25-30 mins. A large party maybe 10-12 comes as I'm waiting and they go through the same process,  however they're sat immediately. I'm annoyed, but I ignored it because my full party hadn't arrived yet. They arrive and a host pops out and is asking if everyone has been helped... She noticed I was still sitting there and rushed away to get our table ready. We get seated at 11:45.  The server came over to take our drink order at 12:05. She forgot our straws and brought them in to go cups because they were out of the mason jars they use... she came back to take our food order at 12:20. My nephew wants pancakes but their machine was down soooooo no pancakes,  however his dad noticed that other tables got pancakes.  We're waiting and I notice the large party they seated before me is still waiting. They're starting to get agitated. The table directly to the left of us was still waiting and they were there for a WHILE, but their food is on the way to the table. It gets there and the young lady examines the plate then places it on the edge of the table, so they grab the first server they saw and tell them the order is wrong. she apologizes and tells her she'll go get her server and when she gets there she grabs their food, goes into the kitchen, then walks it out to another table across the restaurant. It's 1:30. I ask how much longer it'll be and I'm told it'll be out shortly. At 1:40 she passes me again. My brother tells her the kids are getting antsy and very hungry. She then tells us it'll be a while because there are a lot of orders before ours and it'll be another 30 minutes. That's when we decided to leave at 1:45.

Just never go there and you'll be fine; if you want chicken and waffles go else where to maybe Grits Cafe! Skip over M&Ms as I have a horror story about them as well.",OHpqk8UjYbAvPXmj0SNJUQ,4,0,1,2IpfJyFStSPhHz17jiY74Q

They said they do not take reservations and that we can just show up. Once we arrived, we were told by the hostess, that since our party was over 8 people, we had a limited menu of 16 items. That just wasn't acceptable, so we got to speak to the manager. He explained any table over 8 people would stress the kitchen. This was a Monday at 9:45am. There was no stress going on. We asked him if he was OK losing a table of 10, over a simple technicality of 2 extra people, and he said that's the rule. He kept emphasising it was the rule. As we all turned to walk out, he said he would make an exception this one time, since it was still early and not busy. He acted like he was doing us a favor, making a complete ass of himself in front of our group.

To the food: I had the Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles. The meal that is also the name of the place. It comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken came right out of the fryer. It was incredibly juicy but had no flavor. It barley had any seasoning in the breading. The waffles were average size and had a hint of cinnamon mixed in. They were better than the chicken, but they were soggy. They were more like textured pancakes than waffles.

They have a variety of coolaid flavors to choose from. 3 of our party got the watermelon flavor. No one could finish it because it was way too sweet.

At the time of this review, they have only been open for about 4 weeks. You can really tell that not every employee knows what's going on yet. There was a table of new hires right next to us going through orientation. I will give it a month or 2 for them to work out the kinks and try one more time.

Too bad that any event like this would never make the news because it's a white person being discriminated against so I will just listed here and I'm sure that this listing will also get deleted somehow.

I came And after I had placed an order to go over the telephone and I was told at the front counter that it would just be a moment. 
No one even acknowledged my existence after that except for pointing and laughing from the back near the kitchen. 
I stood in one spot for half of an hour and when I did ask somebody how much longer it would be even though I had called the order in an hour ago she told me to wait one second and she would be right back with an answer and then I saw her serving tables.
I was practically except for three others the only Caucasian male in this restaurant. I counted when I started realizing what was going on.
I ended up telling them to never mind on my order and then I left due to embarrassment when I saw one African-American male literally point at me and said ""this cracker has been waiting where is his food.""
It's too bad no new station whatever pick this up but just be aware I experienced exactly what I said I have no reason to lie it was very very uncomfortable.

DONT EAT HERE!

*ANDREW S- you cross the line sir. Let me explain to you why. You may not get this or understand it but I will make sure that you do by the end of this. You just slandered my name. Defamation of character is the legal term/slanderous. Everything you have said that I said as far as me being violent and making threats and also that I am a racist is now in print by your hand. This makes you liable for slander/defamation of character. Not only are you liable but yelp is as well. Here's the best news. I am an attorney and this is my specialty defamation lawsuit. Andrew I hope you have some money because every Day that it remains in print labeling me as a racist for the public to see and also saying I should be banned from a store because I am a danger to others Is a horrible slander. This is an attorney this is what I do. Unfortunately you cannot change any of the text that I wrote to you not once did i say anywhere or eluded to Me being a racist. I'm not going to explain myself here but if you knew my personal life you would know that is not the case. Andrew you can report me all day long to yelp but I have a feeling that yelp will remove your post before they do mine. I found you on Facebook now I know you are so I will proceed with the lawsuit it does not cost me a dime and it will be good exercise for me in court I could use the practice usually everyone else at my firm does the work for me this time I'm taking it personally. In this day and age You need to be careful about what you say about people because it will in the end in fact come back to bite you. I don't want you to remove your post I want you to leave it up there where you say your slander and or defamation that I am a racist every day that goes by means more and more damages in the end. Damages just so you know is what is the most expensive part of a lawsuit. I have lost sleep over this I have not eaten since I read your post and I may have to seek therapy because of what you said about me. The longer you leave the post up the more money I will receive in the end this is a slamdunk deformation/slander lawsuit if you don't believe me call in attorney and ask but just make sure you give them the ACTUAL FACTS Before proceeding. Your childish behavior and actions including blocking me as well as your damaging words have impacted my life in many ways to this point. Next step is a subpoena it will be a certified letter sent to your door explaining exactly what I am suing you for.",H760oTWDujphOIeegBwmJw,3,0,1,QK8plUYIJmjpUN9qWjq5Nw

Waited until I was just about done to check if food was to my liking. 3. Didn't ask if needed change (payed 20 for 13) left it as it was anyway.

The last time we went, we left our babies teether toys in the middle of our table. My MIL came in physically about 30 mins after we left and was told that the toys were never found. One of the toys was a rattle with sentimental value as it was a rattle used by my husband when he was a baby. My husband, who has experience in the service industry calls and speaks to a manager who says she spoke to the busboy and the busboy claims there were no toys. Now my husband gets angry because we know we left them there and demands that the manager go through the trash. Of course the manager was not thrilled. She did find our toys in the trash. So the bus boy was not only a lazy ass who didn't go above and beyond by saving our toys but actually lied about it.

This was probably the worst brunch decision we've made in a long time. The front counter was impossible to get to when we walked in (people standing everywhere) the wait time was supposedly 20-30 minutes. Finally, after 45 minutes, a spot opened at the bar, so we sat there instead. 10 minutes later, we still hadn't been acknowledged or the counter in front of us cleaned. We decided to try and be seated at a table instead, and it still took over 10 minutes for a server to come to us (after she got drinks for 2 tables that had been seated after us). There was no, ""Hi, how are you?"" Just a ""do y'all know what you want?"" 
We ordered the spicy corn fritters and when they arrived, they were ice cold on the inside. When we told the waitress, she just took the basket and walked away. Then my gf had ordered the salmon croquettes and, while they smelled fishy, there was hardly any actual salmon inside, but it had plenty of inedible ingredients.

We were then created by the friendliest and most helpful waitress. She worked really hard. We placed our orders for the food and waited about 30 min for our food to be served.  Meanwhile we had a few drinks off the menu entitled (dranks) it was kool aide with a kick. The drinks were surprisingly delicious. The food was plentiful I had the fried chicken wings, greens, yams, and macaroni and cheese. I really enjoyed the meal.  The greens were seasoned to perfection. I am not a fan of sweet cornbread but it was served warm with butter for those who like cornbread that taste like cake.  One of the other highlights of the meal was the smothered chicken and waffles. Someone else at our table ordered it and said it was delicious.

One employee stated that parties of 8 or more will not be seated together and if we did we could only order certain things off the menu. To my surprise I asked why? She stated because anything that was not number 1-16 would back the kitchen up. My first thoughts was were not eating here, but it was my nephew's birthday so we waited it out.  After a 45 minute wait and many empty tables we were seated.  It took 10 minutes after we were seating for our waitress to even acknowledge us. Once we did order she told us they didn't have any alcohol which was clearly advertised on the menu. When our food came out she forgot two of our orders. Then two of the orders were completely wrong.

Tonight's the second night they've been open and the service was great. They're incredibly busy, but wait time was very reasonable for service. If you're going in the near future, get there as early as possible. The menu is limited and there are no To Go orders until the kitchen gets up to speed. That's a good idea since they're so busy. 

They claim to have Chicken and Waffles in the Top 5 in the country and I don't doubt it one bit. The KK's platter is three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs, and grits for $15. That's a lot of food. The chicken was perfectly cooked and among the best we've ever had. The waffles were the same level of goodness. There's something about their waffles and syrup that's just ""it""...some sort of perfect combo. 

The Shrimp and Mac and Cheese was top notch, as well. The mac part is super cheesy and perfectly creamy. The shrimp? Yup, just as good. 

My Shrimp and Grits were good, but completely overshadowed by the chicken. The grits are unseasoned which is great for breakfast (fix 'em up yourself!), but for a savory dish, should support the main item better than these did. It's still good, but I'd go for KK' s over this. 

Overall, it was a great meal and the service was very good. You can tell they're just getting their ""sea legs"", but we had fantastic service even for an established restaurant.",yExLpVbCfVqVixYwzMaeZw,7,3,5,EIr5myn-yJmK8fFG8kCNeQ

I was able to score a table during lunch after my second attempt this past weekend and I'm extremely impressed with the ambiance. Lo-Lo's dining room is very trendy loved the decor.

The food is extremely debatable and after reading tons of reviews I'm confident with my overall three star rating. 

WHAT I ORDERED:

KK's Fried Chicken & Waffles
*Chicken was phenomenal! The seasoning was perfect and the portion size exceeded my expectations MUST TRY ITEM. The waffles were over powered by cinnamon but decent.

*Catfish Add-On was pretty disappointing considering how well seasoned the chicken was.

*Okra was decent but pretty warm by the time my food arrived.

*The Red Beans?? Yikes!!! By far the worst item ordered. The beans taste like BBQ sauce and chili powder. Definitely needs some improvement.

*Peach Cobbler! I can't believe they served this with massive dough chunks. Terrible!!!!

*Round of applause for my BANANA PUDDING! I looked forward to this dessert and it did not disappoint! If your a fan this is a must order dessert!

I don't think I'd return but it was definitely worth the experience and I sincerely hope the restaurant considers improving some of their menu items. 

Thank you Ms. Nykeia for being patient with me and my mother and providing exceptional service during such a busy time.",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,3,1,3,2j95hXpmlJZaX0MDyIw3cg

We were sat and gave our order to our server Chevy, she was very nice and friendly. Waiting about 20 minutes, still no drinks. Our server comes and says it'll be another 15-20 mins for food, we say it's fine but can we at least have our drinks lol we watched a couple of tables get their food at about 10-15 mins after their order, so we think our server forgot. A food runner comes to our table and brings food we didn't order, it was for the next table. At this point we just think it's really funny no one seems to know what they're doing. Of course they've been opened for only a week so we just laugh it off. About 10 minutes go by and our server comes again saying everything's coming should be just a few more minutes. Finally maybe after 50 minutes we get our food. We ordered 3 plates of chicken and waffles, cornbread, mac and cheese, pineapple upside down pancakes, and the corn fritters. We got everything together except the corn fritters. We asked the server and she said they should be coming, she forgot again lol those were supposed to be starters but it came last, when we were almost done. The chicken is delicious! Throw some hot sauce and honey on it and you're good to go! Oh yeah the server only wanted to give us one side of honey? We asked if we have to pay for another side and she didn't seem to know so we just settled for the one side she gave us lol anyway, the waffle I didn't like so much, as other reviews say, it's quite soggy. It really is more like a pancake. It's weird how soggy it was. Mac and cheese was ok. The corn bread was a bit hard but the inside was ok. The pineapple upside down pancake wasn't worth the $13. The corn fritters were great! Crunchy and creamy and sweet and spicy all in one bite! I would come back to have some chicken and those corn fritters!

The bartender, that couldn't serve drinks by the way because they didn't have their liquor license yet, did nothing but disappear and flirt with these 2 girls the entire time.

After we sat down, we were ignored for about 10 minutes. The bar was sticky with syrup residue and previous customer's dishes. The menus were falling apart and there was over an hour wait time. He then took our order. The food arrived in a decent amount of time and wasn't too bad. A little on the pricey side for certain things, but not terrible. The waiter that brought us the food had to go and get silverware and our drinks because the bartender who took our order never brought us those items. There was no syrup for the waffles and after asking the bartender for syrup twice, we finally walked over to another area of the bar and asked the girls if they were done with the syrup and could we have it. A few minutes later, the bartender came back and brought the girls, who were completely done eating, 2 bottles of syrup. He still, did not engage us. 

When the girls left, he left the bar and ran outside of the restaurant and talked to the girls for a few more minutes outside before coming back in the restaurant. 

We weren't the only ones who received this crappy of service. I watched patron after patron trying to get the attention of their server and being ignored.

If the staff was focused more on their customers instead of flirting or just standing around, they would have more happy customers. Plus, I watched a few servers improperly disposed of food which is a health code violation.

I am not a huge fried chicken fan but decided to try the chicken wings and waffle. I absolutely loved them, the chicken wings were delicious, seasoned well and cooked perfectly, the waffle was good also (and yes, they are as good as Roscoes). My husband, the wing aficionado, loved the wings. I also had a side of cheese grits, they were loaded with cheese, but good. Topped it off with homemade lemonade and sweet tea made just how we like it. For dessert we shared peach cobbler, we didn't care for the peach cobbler, the ""crust"" was more like bread with an odd taste, and a corner of it was cold.

Service was good, our waitress was on point with all our requests. With that said, we will be back!

Well I have been back a few times and I have been disappointed each time. The grits.... Are bland and sticky and just not good anymore, I stopped ordering them. The waffles have not been the same either the last time I had them they tasted like a cup of cinnamon was mixed in the batter.

Each time, each waiter/waitress has been attentive, kind and sometimes friendly. I have yet to have the same waiter/waitress though I have seen them all each visit. I have been ONE time when it was busy and I learned then, never again. Not because service was bad, but because I was hungry and their seating procedures seemed to be unorganized at the time. 

Food! I enjoyed my food at Lo-Lo's. My favorite are the fried green tomatoes. This last visit, I went against my norm and ordered Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits. I'll make this short. I won't order it again. The grits weren't seasoned and the tails were still on the shrimp. I requested them to be taken off but the kitchen decided against my request. WHY OH WHY keep the tails on is a MYSTERY to me. Yet so many restaurants do it. Dumb kitchen policy!! DUMB!

When my food came, I had to wait until it cooled a little so I could remove the tails. UGH! So bothersome to go through all that work and then have under-seasoned food. I was upset! I sprinkled black pepper on the plate, cut the shrimp and then remixed everything. I'm guessing the grits aren't seasoned because the shrimp is heavily seasoned and the cheese brings a level of salt on its own. Once I created a new dish in front of my own eyes, I ate every bite. That bowl was almost dish-washing clean when I was done. It wasn't that the new version of my meal was delicious. It was that I was almost in starvation mode. After creating a new mix, the dish itself was decent. 

I will return to Lo-Lo's as it's been added to my ""must-eat-here"" list in Vegas. I just won't order Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits again.",ktk50OEumyWIspIGfVfcTQ,0,1,3,V2VZeDnyVVQZ3c00zqkzyw

The menu was expansive with many amusing entree names so it took a while to decide what we wanted but when we finally did we waited only for the server to come back and say they were out of several of the items and then came back and said they were out of an additional item.  It was most annoying and a server should already know what's out before they take your order. What's most irritating is that even though we shared it was our first time there and that we have been looking forward to coming they were so unapologetic about being out of items.  The manager never came over and they didn't offer any compensation. Since they kept coming back to food came out separately instead of at the same time. Just really trifling over all.

There were about 5 of us at the door waiting to be greeted. Phone in the hostess desk was ringing and someone ran to answer that. The worker gave some info to the phone caller then left to do other work. Finally we were greeted and given a 10 minute wait time. Time was accurate. Our drink order was taken immediately, however took a while to return.. I had their signature beer and it was very flat, with very little flavor. I ordered a 2 piece with red beans and rice, side of Mac-n-Cheese. Josie had Breast and a waffle. I have been to the one in phoenix, and do not recall it being as open and loud as this place was. Now, for the chicken. Mine was 2 bites of meat and layers of breading. was hoping for some crisp skin but it was practically burnt. the meat of the chicken once I got to it was very dry. 2 thighs with too much breading and 2 bites of dry meat. I don't recall the waffles being as thin as they were when I had eaten at a different LO-Lo's. Josie's chicken breast was like eating saw dust. I was really hoping to have an awesome review about juicy chicken and flavorful food. The Mac-n-Cheese was just okay. Very cheesy but as for flavor it was sadly lacking. (once again a victim of my own Mac that is quite good) Red beans had flavor however the rice was very undone. 

It was very busy here and seemed quite popular. I will admit I am a Vegas boy and not from the south. I would hope, however I would know good chicken when I had it. It was very loud with children about the place being quite noisy. (Parents) ugh!!!.

5192679,2016-05-17,1,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"One of the worst eating establishments I've been to in awhile. Saw the sign on the way to Applebee's, read the yelp reviews and decided why not. Upon arrival we were seated quickly but being greeted for drinks took 15 mins and having our order taken took another 15 on top of that. After the initial 30 mins another lady stopped by our table to explain that there was only 2 waiters working which was why the delay. As if the 30 mins wasn't enough, the even longer wait for the food was even worse. 

Upon getting our food the chicken was old, stale, over cooked, and plain dry. The waffles were dry and seemed as if they we had been sitting under a heating lamp somewhere. The macaroni and cheese was.... Different to say the least. The only good thing was the drinks. Well, most of them anyway. The lemonade was a no go from the start. The sweet tea was good the first glass but the second glass tasted like they switched the batch with over brewed, unsweetened tea. The kool-aid was probably the best thing there but definitely reminiscent of the kool-aid that you made back in the hood... Super sweet. They brought out some complimentary corn bread for the long wait that was pretty much on par with the rest of the meal. Overall, not a good dining experience. 

When we asked to speak with the manager we had an additional 20 min wait before my husband went looking for her himself. He was then advised by the manager of how he was the 3rd person to complain about the food in the past hour. The manager went to look at the food and advised she could understand our disappointed because it looked as if we were served all old food and decided to comp us the whole meal. She apologized for the inconvenience and hoped that the experience would not dim our view of the restaurant and that we would come back and give them another chance at a later time.",QCGi-M-5vceWRUWwZcGrKA,4,0,2,fOlrmYpfsailKpsSIfulGg

I order 2 thighs and waffle with a side of collard greens and a sweet tea. The greens were tender with just the right amount of kick. The chicken had been fried in dirty grease and was really greasy. I ordered my waffle with no butter but it came with it anyway. I scraped it off into a napkin and the waiter took it with him. No offer to get me a new waffle without the butter in the middle, but okay. The waffle was okay. It was flat and soggy. The only flavor it had was cinnamon and was not crispy at all. Not even on the edges. The tea was actually really good. It wasn't overly sweet. 

My son ordered the country fried steak meal with Mac n cheese, collard greens and a sweet tea. The gravy was not the typical country and wasn't very good. The country fried steak was tough, greasy and bland. The corn bread muffin looked good but we didn't try it because it had a HUGE dollop of butter on top that made it mushy and unappealing.

My husband and I ordered the fried okra, 3 wings & 2 waffles, 3 fingers & a waffle, and a side of fries. The fried okra tasted like my great aunt from Arkansas was in the kitchen cooking. The wings were well seasoned, and the fingers were dinosaur sized. 1.5 fingers is the equivalent of eating five fingers - no joke. The portion size of the fries were generous too. Cinnamony is the word that comes to mind to describe the waffles. They are not the star of the show, but make a decent co-star. 

Full disclosure, Kool Aid was never served in my parent's home, so I'm not a Kool Aid aficionado, but my husband is. He claimed that their grape Kool Aid had the perfect sugar to water ratio. So, feel free to get a Jar of Drank.

I only gave this place one star so I can leave this review. 
When my boyfriend and I walked in, (my boyfriend is white and I am Filipino) I was like ok, ambiance seemed cool, the music is my taste and who doesn't like chicken and waffles? Boy, were we wrong to choose this place. If you are not of darker shade then what I am, don't expect the same welcome as everyone else. 

We asked for a booth and the girl seating us TOLD us where to sit. Didn't SHOW us to our seats. Should have known that it was going to be bad. Once seated our server didn't greet us right away. We looked through the menu and drank menu and after 10 mins she finally came. 
Mind you, this is our very first time here. 

We ordered our drinks, my boyfriend ordered a Fat Tire beer and I ordered an OJ with an extra glass of ice. After a few mins, the bartender came up and told us they didn't have Fat Tire, so instead he ordered a Coors Lite. Then after another 5-6 mins, the bartender told us they didn't have coors lite. If you can't even stock coors lite at your establishment and you have a drink menu that is supposedly stocked as a full bar, then you should take away the whole thing. Come on, it's a Sunday and people will be drinking if you say you have a full bar!!! Anyways he just decided to get water. For water, you would still have to wait. 

Now it has been a good 15-20 mins and we didn't get our food ordered because they couldn't find any beers at their bar. Finally! Virginia our server, comes back with water and OJ and gets our food order. My boyfriend ordered Ivan's chorizo scramble with potatoes. Just like in the picture on their menu and I ordered the #9 two piece chicken with one waffle.  After another 15-20 mins, someone other than Virginia, brought our food over. Virginia did not come over to Check on us to make sure our food that came over was good. Unfortunately, my boyfriends order was wrong. He ordered the Ivan's chorizo scramble and asked for over easy eggs instead with potatoes. Eggs were over hard, there were no potatoes, the chorizo looked like dog food and they charge you an extra $1 for potatoes and there weren't any. 

After leaving the plate at the end of the table, finally someone noticed after a good 10 mins that my boyfriend wasn't eating. Told them this is not what he ordered and we wanted to speak to a manager. I ate my food in 10 mins so we could get outta there and still no manager. 

Still no manager, still no server, still bad service. We were waiting for the check for so long that if we decided to just walk out they probably wouldn't even notice.  The place was not packed at all, there were many employees around doing tasks and no customer servicing. 

Finally got our check, and they took out my boyfriend's order. So we started to feel a little better about the place, but when they gave me the credit card receipt to sign, they charged me more than what the original receipt was. What, they charged me extra for a ""white boy tax"".?!?? I was so upset, by this time we were both livid. So livid about our experience that I wasn't going to wait another hour for them to fix it. I attached a picture of both receipts and you tell me how this is right. It's not, it's criminal. This place is a joke.

Stopped at hostess desk and explained why we were leaving and the hostess had us tell a manager. In all honesty, I don't think the manager really cared.

Service: Their service was unprofessional, to say the least. Never in my life have I ever received such crappy, unwelcoming service at a restaurant. The hostesses were what started it off all wrong. Just plain rude and immature. The wait for a table was well over 30 minutes, which was whatever, I kind of expected it with them being a new ""hot spot"". But the wait for our food was also WELL over 30 minutes as well. But what made it even more annoying is that the waiter would come to our table every 15 minutes and say ""It'll be just one more minute for the chicken to finish guys."" And he was such an awkward server too. Whenever he'd check on our table he wouldn't say the normal ""You guys doing okay?"" Or ""Can I get you anything else?"", instead he'd stand right next to our seats and just hover over our table without saying a single word. Awkward. 


Food: I ordered the Betty's Boob, which was described on the menu as 1 succulent chicken breast and 1 delicious waffle. All very true... minus the ""succulent"" and ""delicious"" part. I found it funny how the server kept claiming the wait was for the chicken yet our chickens came out either burnt or dry. And there was no way in hell we were about to send anything back and wait another 30 minutes for new chicken. I ended up just eating half of my chicken till I decided I was over it, then ended up giving the other half to my cousin cuz his chicken came out burnt and nasty. As far as the waffles, everyone's right, they're not horrible but they're super soggy. The waffle was the only thing I finished on my plate. 

I don't know if we came on a bad day or on a day they decided to schedule all the crappy workers together, but my experience was NOTHING like what I read on some of the other reviews lol. 

Hopefully this place will get its act together in the next couple of months. It'd be nice to be able to get some good chicken and waffles without having to drive all the way to Cali for some.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,14,3,1,0ljIern7BTa2f6JsBl8A8w

Spicy Corn Fritters:
Hot bite-size pieces of mildly spicy sweet corn that have been breaded and fried. Crunchy, sweet with a spicy love tap. They come with a dipping sauce that tastes like a combination of mustard and ranch. 4/5

They have chicken combinations galore. Chicken and waffles. Chicken, waffles and grits. Chicken with gravy. Chicken wings.

The KK's:
3 pieces of Southern-style fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits and eggs. You get a lot of food for $15. I was only able to eat half and took the rest to-go. And I'm not one who taps out easily but I didn't wear my extra stretchy pants. The chicken was not dry and the skin was crispy. The waffles have a hint of cinnamon and are the softer kind - it's all about texture and flavor contrast. You don't want everything to be crispy and savory! The scrambled eggs have onions and cheese - pretty tasty. The grits weren't clumpy but had good texture and lots of butter 4/5

I was really hoping they had fried pickles, the green beans were good but not very flavorful. The grits were smothered in butter and tasted lovely. Chicken was seasoned deliciously and cooked perfectly. Eggs were good but it's hard to mess those up. Had a peach cobbler for dessert... it was more like peaches, ice cream, and cake??? Not really a traditional peach cobbler with crust and gooey goodness. Still tasted okay but definitely not what I expected.

By now, I'm feeling as if we are being punished for asking someone to do their job, and had been nothing but cordial and understanding.    The food was outstanding!

Prices are great...$7 for two huge thighs and a waffle - definitely can share this plate! Grits were very good and such a great variety of pancakes! My daughter had Oreo pancakes - extra huge portion with two pieces of bacon!!! The menu has a variety of other items - not just waffles and chicken. The ribeye steak and eggs and potatoes was phenomenal! Ribeye extremely well seasoned, tender and juicy.

5376131,2016-09-20,6,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"I was so hopeful for a good fried chicken joint. One of my favorite foods is fried chicken and this is not what I had in mind. 
We don't live nearby so it took a while for us to give it a try, I was hoping kinks would be ironed out and they had perfected everything, especially their namesake chicken.
I had a doctors appointment up the road so I suggested getting some Lo-Lo's to take home afterward. It took quite a few minutes for someone to actually take our order but everyone was friendly and the place is really nice. It didn't take too long to get our food, we only got fried chicken and waffles. It sure smelled good!
So the chicken has a nice crunchy coating on the outside but that was where the pluses turned to minuses. The chicken meat was dry and had no flavor, the outside coating had no seasoning it was just plain ole coating, blah! So dull! It was edible but not enjoyable. The waffle saved things, yes it was soggy but that was to be expected. It was yummy slathered in butter and syrup, it had a great cinnamon flavor to it, I would go back for just the waffles.
I highly doubt I'd go back, but if I did, I wouldn't get the fried chicken.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,11,8,3,jwpsB-oi6yHZTC0dlALjLA

We went on a Tuesday early afternoon when we knew it wasn't going to be busy. (We know how Lolo's can get regardless of location) we were seated fairly fast. But seemed like the hostess was confused even though they weren't busy. She just assumed we wanted to sit inside, so without asking us she proceeded to lead us to a table and we quickly interrupted her to tell her we rather sit outside. Which for some reason seemed to delay her progress and halted her thought process. She then tried to re-group or whatever but it took her too long to determine where we could sit outside even though only two parties were out there already. So anyways we got seated and then we were greeted shortly afterwards for our drink orders. We got the drinks in less than 5 minutes. We ordered our food and the food came out in only about 15 minutes. 
They have their alcoholic drinks on the menu but don't have the license yet. That was a bummer. We should have been told that once we were seated; just as an FYI so we could have been prepared to order from the ""available"" drinks. 
The food here is GREAT! Made from scratch home cooking that is always consistent!! (I frequent Lolo's in Phoenix and Scottsdale when ever I'm in AZ and the Vegas Lolo's seems to be just as good) I ordered my usual: ""Nay Nay's"" (Two waffles, two eggs with a cup of grits then I add hot links on the side). I LOVE their waffles! The flavor is like no other and it's their staple recipe! DON'T ever change them! She got the chicken and waffles. The piece of chicken came out very over cooked. It should have never left the kitchen or even be served. But they are new so they still may be learning...idk. But no biggie because we never have a problem telling them to take it back. She then chose to get catfish which was delicious! Fried to perfection.

Overall there were some great things and then some things that weren't so great. They obviously need to tighten up their service when it comes to the hostess being unprepared, notifying us about what's not available from the menu and not serving over cooked food. I blame the waitress because she should be our advocate and let the kitchen know she wasn't going to serve food that is not up to the regular standards. But they all are new so that is something that can obviously be fixed easily and takes a little time. The food is great! Portions are great. And in a great atmosphere. And that trumps the small service issues they had so I am giving a solid 4 stars until I come back.",bl_ShhYxra-J1q_Bds3i2A,0,0,4,-BqaliM40-A-tWN6zLgifA

Excuse me as a business you make a trip to the grocery store and buy some chicken strips to make.

Also asked for butter several times and guess what no butter until the waffle was too cold to melt the damn butter.

The chicken was crispy,  and juicy.  The batter was a little thick, but over all good.  My husband got the same thing,  but covered and gravy, and said it didn't taste like gravy. It was a little spicy wich he liked,  but not what he was expecting.  My daughter got the Rib eye steak and eggs, the stake was burned at the edges and it was mostly fat, and veins,  the menu stated that it came with French fries,  but it came out with burnt squared spicy potatoes? Her meal was the worst.  She had some of my food instead.

My husband and I are early risers and so on the weekends we are always up and ready to go, today was no exception, our plan, to get a table at Lo-Lo's before the crowd shows up.

Quite surprised that at 830 on Saturday morning the place is nearly empty. We are seated right away, we notice lots of empty tables and lots of staff doing various things, and it seemed they where all to busy to notice we had sat down. 

Finally, an assistant server notice me making faces at him to get attention so someone could take our order. He got us drinks. 

After several more minutes a server noticed we where in her section and took our order, two number ones. Thats eggs, any way, grits, two waffles and three pieces of chicken, white or dark meat, I got mixed. 

Another long wait for the food, in the mean time the place got really busy. Tables of five to eight showing up all at the same time. 

Food finally arrived! The chicken was really crispy and golden brown, the crust stuck to the meat so I could get skin and juicey meat in one bite. The eggs, scrambled with cheese and onions, the grits with a big spoon of butter melting on top, and of course two golden brown waffles also with a spoon of butter melting and running all over. The syrup, warmed was delicious. 

Overall, food was great, there seemed to be a lot of staff but unorganized and lacking leadership, perhaps a sign of newness?

We decided to wait because I was told the food was really good. After twenty minutes I asked the hostess why it was taking so long when other parties had come in after us and were already seated. She told me that they were waiting on a large booth to sit us in. I asked her why they couldn't just push two tables together and she said that the management doesn't like for them to do that because it confuses the wait staff. After another ten minutes we were taken to a small booth that was too small for all of us. I told her that we needed something else so she pushed two tables together for us and brought out our drinks. We waited another 25 minutes before I asked for a manager. The manager, Bobby Jean came to our table and I explained to her the situation about the table and how it had been an hour and ten minutes since we walked in the door and not one person had come to the table to see if we were ready - no one even acknowledged that we were there. She apologized and said she would get someone to wait on us right away. 

Our waiter, Roy was very nice and apologetic. He took our order and made sure that we had refills when we needed them. The manager came up to check on us and to let us know that our order would be out shortly.  Once the order came out I have to say that everything was really good. I had the chicken fried steak and I have to admit I was a bit surprised that it was topped with a brown gravy rather than the more traditional white sausage gravy I'm used to having.  The first bite seemed a little spicy, but after that I was happy with the taste. I also had buttered corn and whipped potatoes. The one spoonful of buttered corn that I had was great - my three-year niece ended up taking the corn and eating it by the handfuls. The whipped potatoes tasted like they had sour cream and were just a little bit too salty for me, but I don't usually put extra salt on my food. 

Once we got passed the fact that we had to wait so long to be seated and then had to wait even longer to be served, I would say the food was good. I don't know that I will be going back anytime soon just because of the wait and the fact that no one acknowledged us as we sat there.

As kind a woman as she seemed to be, she also seemed exhausted like she didn't want to be there anymore. She takes our drinks down, another good few minutes go by and we finally get them. Mine was just an ice water and my boyfriend had gotten tea of some kind. She asks if we're ready to order and we say yes, I had gotten the pecan salad (I believe) and he had ordered a medium rare burger. We wait, and wait, and wait some more, finally about 40 minutes go by and out comes out food.

Except our waitress was gone. She had left in the middle of our dining in and gone home. Maybe it's just me, but who does that? Don't they at least finish off a table they have beforehand? Or at least stop by to tell us someone else will be serving us?

The chicken in my salad was dry and old, as though it had been left out for days before being used, I found a HAIR in my food, and there was no flavor whatsoever. My boyfriends burger came out rare, nearly raw and inedible. The guy who took over never came by to refill our drinks- or at least waited until the glasses were completely empty and ice was at a quarter mark on the cups. And to top it all off, he gave us the WRONG bill for another table that was at least 100+$! Pay attention to the table your serving so they don't have a damn heart attack over this stuff!

At first when I saw other plates coming out, I thought the chicken looked like it was going to be fried too hard for my liking but to my surprise the looks were deceiving. The chicken was seasoned well and tasted like something I would eat at home. 
The service was a little too slow for me; however the servers were nice and professional about it. 
Overall I would definitely return here again. This place is giving Roscoe's a run for their money so if they ever come to LA, I'll support it.",lqLWjv3R2U2wp9Qa5t6nNA,1,0,4,5OMC23NlO5wy2EJKKDdioQ

My plate was $17, chicken, waffles, eggs and grits. $2 extra for white me.  I was previously advised not to go because the food was gross. Well, the chicken is not gross, but definitely not good AT ALL. I guess they seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. I will not be returning.

Definitely needs improvement.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come, so we definitely needed some refills on drinks during that wait. The waitress barely checked on us for refills or to see if we needed anything.  However, when we were almost done eating... she kept coming back every couple of minutes to grab each single plate as it was clear ... All of a sudden all the attention we need from our server, but I knew it was only because we were finishing up and they just needed a table.   

Food.  
Just come for the chicken !!! 
The only thing my family and I really enjoyed was the chicken.  Super crispy and just the right amount of batter.   The waffles were ok, (I don't think anything can compare to Roscoe's chicken and waffles let's be honest).  Mac and cheese was ok and the cornbread was a little too dry for me.   Also, DO NOT get the red velvet pancakes, they were super dry and not worth it. 

TIP:  Be prepared to wait.  Since they just opened it is super busy.  Especially on the weekends, over 45 minute wait.  

This location is not on my side of town, but I would come back definitely for the chicken and I would come probably on a weekday for now.  Perhaps after some time, the service would improve too!",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,6,2,3,9nZ3yfMaGipElmzAC7ow0Q

The hostess station is completely clueless!! They told us an hour wait. We were willing to wait but oddly I could see multiple tables in the bar area and patio that had available seating. That was not offered. When I asked about them seats I was told I'd have to wait because their were many people ahead of us... 15 minutes later seats still open smh waitress walks up and says wanna sit with me.. so she just sat us :) cool
But from there we waited well over an hour before we got our food. I watched multiple parties so frustrated over the wait they just left.. 
When our food did arrive it was tasty but I think we will wait a few months before returning.. That place needs some serious help. I'd probably rerate in a few months.  So this review is more or less a warning at this point. The waitresses are under stress the kitchens way behind and the hostess station has no idea about what's avail on their floor..

The waitress brought a new waffle but it looks and taste exactly the same. I show her what is batter . The waitress says,  if you want a waffle golden brown you need to order it well done otherwise it's going to come out soft. (I have no reason to lie on this lady) I said my friend did not order a well done waffle and why didn't the waitress asked me if I wanted a undercooked, slightly cooked, or well-done waffle? The waitress says your friend probably got someone else's waffle. She then brings me a well done  golden brown delicious waffle .  I order grits,eggs, and fried chicken too . The Grits were extremely watery and the chicken was  seriously overcooked. Most of the food was still on the table when she brought the bill. Waitress said I didn't charge you for the other two waffles. I told her I would not have paid for raw food. I gave two stars because my mojito and my friends Kool-Aid vodka cocktail were absolutely delicious. I did order a 2nd cocktail but it never made it to the table. I thought the prices were acceptable. There's ample parking, it's easy to find, and they have one hell of a bartender. I don't know his name but he was the only Caucasian man behind the counter.

With lots of excuses like her server the one with the attitude acting like anything I asked or said without putting him out with his rolling eyes and walking away that he must have been upset because he didn't really want to be there and he was working later than he was supposed to my response was then cut them from the floor it's bad for your business for a customer not to feel welcome in an establishment that you have  been sitting in
 for approximately a half hour is unacceptable in my book... in the meantime after her making tons of excuses and what not she offered to bring some fried green tomatoes to the table and switched servers still felt quite uncomfortable in there this was approximately 6 o'clock on a Sunday night and I guess supposedly they close at 6 o'clock according to the manager said one of the hostesses just sent a customer away saying that we close in 10 minutes we also heard another server at a table behind us tell customers they couldn't order anything to go which I thought again with strange since food was still coming out the impression is very lazy service in there and you are constantly having to flag people down to try to get their attention when they come to the table they come off as if there you're doing you a favor or that you're just simply putting them out! The food took a long time to come out when it was brought to the table one of the chicken breast we noticed looked like it was very old and dry and it was totally different from the other pieces and sure enough after cutting into it was exactly what we thought dry and like it had been sitting there all day under a heat lamp asked if they would remake that piece of chicken again got attitude and was told it would take 5 to 8 minutes.... well it literally took them
 a half an hour! Lastly at 6 o'clock you can hear the entire kitchen staff so loud you could hear per Batum their conversations as they act like they're having a party one talking louder than the next while we were sitting very far from the kitchen Side of the restaurant actually and yet that's all you could hear the employees acting as if they didn't have any cares in the world it  very disrespectful and very unpleasant to listen to.... followed up by blaring loud music again so that the employees can have a great time still four or five tables in the restaurant and they're blasting people out it was so uncomfortable I had asked for them to turn the music down as it was giving me a headache!!! My recommendation is avoid this place like the plague the food is nothing to write home about and the service is ridiculous these people act like they're beneath serving anybody shame on them and coming from being a former food server  I certainly wasn't working for the minimum wage I was getting paid for they need customer service skills taught  to them badly and management The general manager actually seem to be intimidated by the workers and out of control of the entire restaurant all she did was make excuses one after the other!!! Go to m&m soul  food you will not be disappointed they originated in East LA they are as nice as pie when you come in and can't do enough to give you good service and great food with a smile on their face",xMrhd5OHNPmpW4HiH25yTw,0,0,1,Giod1mCp80YPb9uJ2DlDbQ

The restaurant itself wasn't busy. When we were acknowledged we were rudely lead to our booth without an apology.  The waiter took our drink order and left us for 15 minutes to bring us our drinks and take our order.  When we received our food my daughters Mac and cheese was cold and the waffles were dry and tasteless.  Needless to say I won't be coming back.,i064fRM1rCH24FDDnJlIUA,2,0,1,SQM0BdXEzVmd4daFQHOZsA
5740799,2018-03-23,0,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,"On our way to Laughlin, and since we were going through Vegas I had to stop here.  One of my favorite places to eat.  The weather was beautiful, so we sat outside this time. Seats are comfy and tables roomy, fyi.

I ordered the Tre-Tre (waffle plus two fried chicken legs) and my husband ordered the Lil Amadi (waffle plus two fried chicken thighs). I also got a side of fried okra.  First off--the friend okra. It was pretty darn good, second only to my mom's. I prefer my friend okra sliced slightly thinner and a little more cornmeal to the batter. But it was still really, really good & I'd order it again.  The waffles were just as delicious as I remember...some magical batter with cinnamon and other spices combined with butter and syrup makes them SO good.  And the fried chicken is perfect...crisp and juicy, not too thick of batter.  

This time I tried their Lo-Lo's brand hot sauce and was surprised to find I really liked it.  I usually don't like the restaurant brand hot sauce because they're usually too smoky for my tastes.  This one was spicy and tangy, no smoke flavor. I'd actually consider buying it to take home if we weren't headed in the opposite direction! 

The water still comes in a Mason jar, which works great for me since I drink a lot. Waitress was fine. Nice smile and friendly.  Gave us the right amount of time between drinks and ordering to look over the menu.

Visited 2-23-17 on a not so busy Thursday night. Arrived at 5:15 to have dinner. Ordered an appetizer and drinks. Koolaid was perfect, drinks perfect. The problem you ask? Getting our food was horrendous!!! After placing our 3 entree orders we didn't see it for 45 mins. Told the waitress it was cold( butter wasn't even melting on the waffle!) and to have it sent back. Only got 2 entrees and didn't see the third one. Appetizer still hasn't come out before our dinner showed up cold. The waitress we had was amazing and said she would take care of it. Grabbed our meals with the manager standing right behind her not even apologizing or showing concern. Just glanced our way and bolted the other direction! Told the waitress we still haven't gotten our app yet. 5 mins later appetizer comes out piping hot and yummy. 15 mins roll by and we get our 2 entrees, still COLDER THAN YOUR EXS HEART for the second time. Mind you we still haven't even seen the third entree. The place wasn't busy as much as they usually are and still super cold food. My first visit here was amazing but it was jam packed, crowded but they still got our drinks, appetizer and entrees for a table of 8 in about 20-30 mins. We asked to speak with the manager and to our surprise gave us a ""what the hell do you want me to do about it"" kind of attitude. The waitress, that was yelling at her staff to get theirselves together, had more ""managing"" experience/attitude than that person who had a red manager shirt. WAITRESS WAS VERY UNDER-APPRECIATED!

The names of the dishes are adorable and so we ordered 2 breasts and waffles, 2 chicken wings with waffles and 1 thigh and 1 leg with waffles. Also, 1 order of rice n gravy and 1 order of French fries n gravy. The website menu does not have $'s and I understand because of the cost of chicken especially breasts and wings so that really didn't bother me but when we picked up our food, the Hostess was very nice. I asked that I am picking up a delivery and this was our first time trying LoLo's. She said, ""You will Love LoLo's if you Love chicken and Southern food. Very nice, our hostess, gave us all the condiments that we needed for the dishes . And, she said I know you will be back but sometime dine in, ok? I said, ok. Well, when we got home and put everything on the table, it looked liked we were at the restaurant. The fried chicken was just as crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside as was the wings which were very nice size and the leg n thigh also were very good! The rice n gravy was good especially the gravy! Love that gravy! The French fries were steak fries and a order of gravy and was delicious also!

I like to add a little bit of hot sauce which gives it all a good kick in combination with the sweetness of the  maple syrup.

The chicken was crispy which I enjoyed, but a little on the salty side, in my opinion. The waffle was almost IDENTICAL to Roscoe's. It might have had cinnamon in it or something different, but overall it gave me the same satisfaction of a Roscoe's waffle. Yum! Mac & cheese was just okay.

Hopefully the owners or managers help streamline that for them. After a while we were seated.  I wish they already had their liquor license because I probably would have ordered a drink while my hubby sat in the car with our kids because it was so packed. They said they were supposed to get their liquor license the following week.  Anyhow, it's great to have another option on the Northwest side of town. 

Update: A couple of weeks later, less busy but still no liquor license.  Chicken was better the first time too.",UmFyatUCIZ5d0Iaqdf1S-Q,1,0,3,1IWKYbVjJ8hBsxFzLe9pAQ

Everyone was make no sure we were happy and needed nothing. And the fried chicken?  Right on point. How was this around the corner for years and I never tried it I'll never know. Now I'll be here monthly .",QcWXB5peBp3oIX0q7JmFgA,0,0,5,yEX7z5QgVaQ6HFlSJJmaug

Chicken was piping hot' waffles had to wait maybe... My husband got his shrimp and grits 30 minutes after everyone else was plated.  Side orders of grits and eggs never arrived until halfway through our meals.  We asked the waitress so my times over 30 minutes for our side orders she began giving us an attitude.  The service was horrible.  I've gone to one in Arizona and had no issues.  It's really unfortunate, it has so much potential.  Maybe taking make time in training your staff would help, and an manager onsite.",GAAP_WIN926RVt5t23C04A,0,0,1,NoLIIIqOQGQztdKRFiu7rQ

5982252,2017-12-11,0,z5J9U_HU4iVLwaCH6rdC2w,I love meee some chicken & waffles! This restaurant is always clean and ambiance is nice. It takes awhile to get your food & I'd like to think it's because it cooked fresh. I've been here several times. It truly depends who your waiter is on your experience but generally it's a good one. They have really good kool-aid flavors! Love the Max & cheese!,eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,0,0,4,Xn4BOU_tjRLPmGspYm--Ng

We walk in and place is basically empty. Our hostess takes a few mimutes, no big deal, we sit doen with menus in hand. My mom is way impressed with the food selection as everything looks wonderful on the menu...takes us about 3 to5 min to pick our selection. We put the menus down and begin discussing day events.....5 min go by, then 10, then 15, then 18....at the 18th minute i have watched the full first quater of the golden st vs memphis game......my mom was like really this olace is empty...i immediately  see the problem, one server to handle the entire restaurant....its 530pm.....we get up and go to sweet tomatoes.....we were both very disappointed.....please dont let this place go out of business because you are trying to save on labor cost. You need to adequately staff your resraurant for predicted business flow....as in most of the complaints on here its all service related. You need to understand your profit margin/labor cost should have no equilibrium value....the employees didnt care neither did the manager on staff when we complained....please give me a call 7025749339, this is my business. Helping restaurants who have no idea what they are doing.....ill help train your staff so the service is top notch..and you wont run into inadequate bodies on the floor and still save labor cost dollars......as your business platform is beginning to go downhill and fail as people are walking away and your losing customers .....only been open less than a year....its a shame when you have less competent mangers running such a great product business.....",fm_bd1miLMexVRXt6GIPUQ,0,0,1,bbPoPr5GFKJ6Cp_-yYNNXw

Peoples order got fucked up....thank you GM. After demanding the GM to come out 4 times, he had a shitty attitude, smart ass comments and blamed all the issues that he caused on the waitress which isn't true.....he fucked it up. 

The chicken was salty, some of the food was cold and the mood was shot. family and i came here to eat and enjoy our time in Vegas and the whole mood if our eating experience was totally FUCKED.....THANK YOU GM. Jazz was our waitress and she was great until the GM sent her home. I won't be coming back and I'm going to let my listeners know....Shout out to Jazz.",po1TctIFBRosA9LeUvJOmA,4,1,1,AjkHYxVsDdWOcomrWnjAlQ

When she finally came to the table to get our drink orders and left without saying another word... By then, we were all ready to order since she took forever acknowledging our existence.  Fast forward another 15 minutes, she came back to get our food order. By now I have asked for water with lemon twice. When she finally arrived with our food, my friends spinach was cold, she doesn't have ranch like she asked for multiple times, and I still didn't have a single slice of lemon. I asked her for some lemons when she finally showed up with ranch sauce. She told me they were out of lemons. I thought ""ok well that's not a big deal."" Until.... SHE SHOWED UP WITH AT LEAST 4 MORE DRINKS FROM THE BACK THAT HAD LEMONS IN IT! Why even lie? 1.5 hours to get food, eat for 5 minutes, get aggravated, and leave.  Food isn't worth it.

After waiting a long time to be seated even with plenty of tables obviously available we again waited for a long time before we were served our drinks. When the drink order came it wrong and my coffee mug was splattered with egg yolk. After another long wait our server finally took our food orders and I asked for a fresh cup of coffee.  When the food finally came out or server brought out a new cup of coffee but it was ful of coffee grounds floating in the mug and smeared up the sides. The food was adequate but we were completely ignored by our server after we got our food. Bottom line even if the food is ok, it is served on dirty dishes and the service is lousy. This will be the only time I ever eat here.",cycdIsITLxJzQtejU0DWCg,0,0,1,vl12gwzSCaN5-ozjmJqugw
