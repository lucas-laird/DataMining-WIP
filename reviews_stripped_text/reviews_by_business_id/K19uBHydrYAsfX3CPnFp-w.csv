Put aside the expected problems like high price and little actual tuna per serving. The bowls me and wife got were absolutely horrific.  It was so terribly salty it was barely edible.  It was as salty as canned anchovies. Both me and my wife tossed half the meal after the manager refused to taste what the staff had put in our oversized cardboard containers and stated that this is how it is supposed to taste. He offered to make another batch with the same pre-mixed sauce which he said would have tasted the same as what he had already served me and then gave me this look like if you don't like it, don't come here. 

This is exactly what I am going to do! OMG even though we were willing to put up with a small serving and a high price, this was absolutely terrible. This left a seriously nasty taste in our mouths for a few hours after until a number of beers could wash this stuff down and quenched the salt induced thirst that followed this ""meal"".

You can build your own pok√© bowl with toppings or opt for a roll. The bowls start with white or brown rice and a protein such as tuna, salmon or spam. Toppings include seaweed salad, grilled asparagus (both $0.50 extra), edamame, red onion, and cabbage. The rolls can be built the same way except it is hand rolled in seaweed paper. 

I tried the spam roll with teriyaki sauce and it was delicious. The roll maintained its shape and was easy to eat. The spam was nothing special; I would have preferred for it to be cooked to a crisp for added texture. The bowl was average. I was glad to see that there were set bowl options for those who are new to the concept and cannot decide on how to build their bowl. Some of the toppings did not taste fresh to me and they skimp on the toppings (2 small scoops). The rice in the bowl was not even hot.

You would be better off going to really any other Sushi Burrito/Bowl place in Vegas if you are a local. Before you come after me saying ""it's on the Strip, of course it will be expensive!"" I have to defend myself by stating that plenty of expensive strip food is also excellent. I'm not mad Poukei is expensive, I am mad it is not good enough for what I am paying. If you are stuck at the Planet Hollywood like I was all day and you need a fix, Poukei can give that to you, but a fix is the most you are going to get. Their logo is cute too so it can make for a good picture or two. 

I had a custom sushi burrito with tuna, crab, onion, green onion, cucumber, yum yum sauce, and eel sauce. It was on the smaller side but I wasn't starving so I didn't mind. My friend ordered a bowl and was highly disappointed. Last complaint: they were out of water bottles to buy but wouldn't give us a water cup to get free water out of the soda machine. So my friend wanted water and they told him he would have to buy a fountain drink cup to get it.

It consisted of a base of rice, chopped tuna, (lots of) red onion and soy sauce which is first mixed and then placed on top of the rice. We felt the shoyu was plain and too salty and can be enhanced with other ingredients, the bowl had way too much red onion in proportion to the rest of the ingredients, and overall it looked like just fish, red onion and rice -- pretty plain. Looking at the menu again, it may have been better to ""build your own"" so you can get other toppings for basically the same price and have more variety in your bowl.

1. Freshness. The fish is so bland it has no natural flavors. It just felt like the fish was out there sitting for a long time and I couldn't even taste the natural fresh flavor. When I was chewing on the ahi and the skin kept peeling off, super gross! The salmon tasted off and looked odd. Maybe imitation salmon? 
2. Serving size. The amount of the serving for each scoop is ridiculously small. If you're gonna order a bowl you're gonna need two scoops or more! 
3. Flavoring and pricing. They didn't have that much choices for sauces so I stuck with spicy ponzu. Again it tasted bland so I just ended up adding soy sauce after for some more flavoring. The pricing on the other hand, its too expensive for the outcome. The total for the bowl was $14.95 for two scoops. On top of that you have to pay extra for seaweed salad for toppings and they barely had choices for toppings. So basically $15.45 for poke bowl that I didn't even finish because it tasted so AWFUL!! 

For any tourists out there visiting vegas, you are better off going to soho sushi burrito on Sahara or to see roll on s. Rainbow. Might be a little bit of a drive but it will be so worth it!!!

The food was great it's a nice little stop to sit or go to if you're on the strip with friends and are on the move. The food was simple, yet packed with flavor and the personality made you want to come back for more. This restaurant was located in the Planet Hollywood Casino, it has the most amazing shopping mall located right on the strip with many sites to see.

The first menu item I got from Poukei was the Spam Poke Bowl with sticky rice with my choice of 3 veggies. The spam was nicely cut into strips and salted perfectly which went amazing with the soy sauce. The sticky rice was firm and the veggies I chose,  broccoli, corn, and carrots were nice and fresh. There was an option of chicken or shrimp but I was very satisfied with the spam entree.

For my second order I got to try something I was looking to try for quite some time. It presented the polymerization of two concepts it was a sushirrito an idea so great I would give it a Nobel peace prize. The Puukei crunch was my choice of their sushirritos it was a signature of theirs and it did not disappoint. This item had crab,panko shrimp, romaine, red onion, cucumber, yum yum sauce, and finally eel sauce, something a seafood lover would die for. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful nothing tasted canned or fake.

Usually, poke places come with 2 protein MINIMUM and you're letting me choose between one or two proteins? Sure, lets just offer the least amount as possible and charge $$$ because in Vegas that's justifiable right?!

Another thing is that most poke places offer unlimited toppings, excluding the more expensive ones such as crab meat or avocado. This place offers FOUR toppings only and the toppings are so bizarre that I couldn't even choose 4. Some toppings they offered were corn, broccoli, spinach, etc, like am I at Souplantation or a poke place?!

Its also got a very strong following in the San Francisco Bay Area. But Las Vegas? Since my lovely lady and I were staying the weekend at Planet Hollywood Hotel, I was looking for a place that was unique and most importantly, close to the live concert we'd be seeing. We ended up having front row VIP seats to Jennifer Lopez who was performing at the AXIS @ Planet Hollywood. And what made this a unanimous choice, ""Poukei"" was literally 50 feet away from the main entrance at AXIS.

The main seating area is located in the ""Miracle Mile Shops"" which is adjacent to various stores and eateries. When my lady and I arrived (which was on the evening of Saturday 9/30/17), there was actually nobody dining or even ordering for that matter. What I particularly enjoyed about this place is that it serves a variety of sushi burritos as well as build-your-own sushi burritos from the ground up. They also carry a nice variety of Poke bowls. And for the non-sushi/Poke eaters, they also offer a very generous Teriyaki menu.

I ended up ordering the build-your-own sushi burrito. The way it works is that you pick a base, protein, sauce, vegetables, and toppings. I ended up choosing Nori (seaweed) as my base, cooked shrimp as my protein, Wasabi mayo & Yum-Yum as my sauces, scallions & carrots as my vegetables, and Masago (fish eggs) & cream cheese as premium extras. I also chose Thai iced tea as my drink of choice. Total price for everything, around $12 which is a very fair price for a sushi burrito & drink on the Las Vegas Strip. My lady ended up ordering a teriyaki rice bowl. 

Basically the way it works at Poukei is that they make everything in front of you; much like ordering food at Chipotle and Subway. I liked that idea since nothing was kept hidden. I was actually very impressed with my sushi burrito; the crunch of the cooked shrimp with the sticky rice and Masago definitely hit the spot. And it was very filling as the amount of food was equivalent to about 1 1/2 sushi rolls. 

Overall, this is one of the only few places that actually serves sushi burritos & Poke bowls on the entire Las Vegas strip. Additionally, they also offer a nice variety of Japanese sodas, Boba drinks, and teas. The service was just so-so as the lady behind the register just seemed dull and quiet in conversing with me. However, for the freshness of the food itself paired up with excellent prices, I will have to give ""Poukei"" an above average four-star rating.",yFb-Hqr8k6uIfwCQ3BO4dQ,6,5,4,DulHquOFZdSXMBGbJyW21Q

Their jalape√±o sauce did have a kick to it and was deliciously spicy. I would come here again.,bPQGrLglUFlM387_1cQvcw,0,0,4,Y8cps4hVuOm9BBW0IuKC-g

If you're going to sell something folks...Get IT RIGHT!!  Including its NAME!! The most important part!  The NAME!!

Such a Mockery of what true Poke really is!",8yxcIkdg3pNFC017FMbLEw,0,0,1,Wjxah5yR5RSJTte1r2t1DQ

I created my own sushi rice bowl with spicy salmon and spicy ahi. My toppings were cucumber, red onions, seaweed salad and edemame. I topped off my bowl with ""yum yum"" sauce which was described to me by one of the girls behind the counter as an Asian thousand island. I also drizzled spicy mayo, sesame seeds and furikake on top. It was all $15 and it was delish!

We'll definitely be back!",DJP074yoTYTLE0MT_T2bSw,2,1,5,GFTFDCvPyDSg4GBwB_arOA

I got the Cali roll, with crab meat, and it was very good!  The sweet tea was freshly brew and delicious, not too sweet. So happy with my take-out dinner. Tables are available by the shop. The set-up is attractive.",8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,0,0,5,ZLLAYBLo9hoE-eUDCqZtQA
5815408,2016-11-24,0,K19uBHydrYAsfX3CPnFp-w,"tasty&salmon was fresh, but sadly, salmon was out I had to get spicy salmon. 
They were out of seaweed and masago :( and another sad thing, crab meat wasnt a topping... it was one of the protein. Well, so i had to pay 3-4bucks more for that second protein choice. 
The poki places around my town always let us choose 3-5 different proteins that we want but here we only get to choose one for reg price :( 
I always get spicy mayo! And i could choose another sauce and I wanted some heat so I chose some jalapeno sauce and it was delish! 
My mom liked it, too
The service was great! I was just little sad w some missing toppings/food.",FI7W_-IdvK5zl4hHHy4hOw,0,0,3,HC8jI95UMzX_XPLXU0XCYw

It's located in casino I forgot the name. When you check in, you get free soft drink. It's like a subway set up type of place. The flavors weren't there but it was enough to satisfy my growling stomach for the time being. The price is a little high for just some rice and shrimp tempura rolled up in a burrito style. It cost $12.95 but ya Vegas after all.",WRgjbLZKODhEZ1--g1VwHA,0,0,3,CYbVR23C_ImkOrg7PEFTpw
