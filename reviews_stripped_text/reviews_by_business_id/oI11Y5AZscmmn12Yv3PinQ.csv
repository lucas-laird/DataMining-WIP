A day ago I went again just to give it a 2nd chance, I mean what are the odds right? Apparently they weren't in my favor. I ordered the same thing. I should have known when I took the first bite something was wrong because the meatballs were basically cold. I heated it up in the microwave and choked it down. It was mostly cheese not much sauce. I ended up throwing out the other half. I woke up at 2am with food poisoning AGAIN! I tried calling them but no one answered. Never again. I don't even think I can look at a Subway sign without feeling like I want to throw up. I'm sure they aren't all like this but 2 times in one year at this same location, that's ridiculous.

How do you run out of bread and not bake more? I hate to sit down and eat a sandwich I don't like. It just doesn't satisfy me the way I know it can.

Now granted, why am I bitching here and not there while she screws it up in front of me? I was so sick and just wanted a quick dinner at home before bed. Why was that so hard?!. I couldn't even enjoy it and ended up throwing half of it away.

The two ladies were not talking to each other or helping on another. Older lady was rude and didn't even talk to anybody coming in the door or ask if younger lady needed help.  Younger lady was doing her best but was getting frustrated with a line of customers and kids playing with the mother not controlling her kids. adding another employee or getting rid of the older lady would be suggested.,SzXBq6GNevw8FBTF0yyriw,0,0,2,4pu6sGikvf3_bWszy6_Nug

I'm reviewing Subway because I'm bored. If you really need to read a review to decide whether or not to go to a place that makes generic sandwiches, you need to re-evaluate your life.

My personal favorite is the $5 foot long menu. Eat half now and you have lunch for later. My usual is the cold cut combo loaded with all the vegetables and honey mustard. But that's the beauty of Subway, you can customize it any way your tummy desires.

The staff always says welcome and thank you as you walk in and out of the door. Most of the folks that work here are teenagers which makes it a little difficult when in a hurry. Lately I noticed their customer service has improved greatly. I hope the manager continues to make sure these kids are polite and speedy.

The veggies are mostly fresh but the bread-I like my bread soft and this is where they fail-epically! The middle and usually the bottom of the bread is okay (inconsistent) but the top and edges get hard and crusted over. I hate this and will not eat it. I was totally  exasperated after they failed to refund me or offer to make me a new sandwich when I brought the hard crusty turkey sandwich back- a non eaten sandwich.  And I had the receipt. That is poor business practice and customer service.  I'd try a different sandwich shop if I were you or at least a different location.
