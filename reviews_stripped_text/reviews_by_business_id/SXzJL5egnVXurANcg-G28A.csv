In the past, I've ordered crazy bread, and they were never brown. The customer asked for fresh ones.. The worker put the burnt ones back in the case, and stomped off making unnecessary banging noises and went to make new ones. She didnt tell me she'd be right with me, she just walked away. By this time she had major attitude. 2 other guys walked thru the waiting area speaking loudly about Eminem, totally ignoring the customer service part of their job. I timed my wait time which was 12 minutes, before I walked out. I was never acknowledged at all. In the time I waited, I noticed how dirty and disgusting the employees looked, not to mention their work space, gross.

253809,2015-06-06,0,SXzJL5egnVXurANcg-G28A,"I placed an order the night before around 8pm on Monday 6/1 for the next morning (6/2). I call around 10:30am that morning (6/2) to be sure they received my order and that it will be ready on time at 10:50am for pickup and she said yes.
When I got there at 10:47am she says they're not ready, in fact, they didn't even start my order!! My order was an order of 4 pizzas for a luncheon event I was hosting for future clients. So I asked how long it would take and she said 10 minutes and I said fine. I end up waiting about 15-20 minutes. I arrive to the event I'm hosting 5 minutes late because of it and still need to set up the tables and other food I had besides the pizza.
We ended up close to running out of pizza so I figured I would call Little Caesars and give them another chance. I order 2 more, one cheese and once pepperoni and I ask how long she said it's going to be ready in 20 minutes and I said ""no worries."" 15 minutes pass and I call before I head over to pickup so I am certain I will not wait again and this time it's a guy and he says it's going to take 5 more minutes and I go ""that's fine because I'll be there in 10 minutes."" I get there in 10 minutes like I said and they say it's not ready, AGAIN!!!! She says it'll take like 2 or 5 minutes (can't remember if 2 or 5). I end up waiting there for 10 MINUTES AT LEAST!!! AND when I finally get my 2 pizzas I find out when I got back to the event that they gave me 2 CHEESE instead of one cheese and one pepperoni!!! That's when I didn't bother talking to them and asked for the manager and she said he wasn't there so I gave her my number and told her to have him call me since she didn't know when he would be there. What kind of business is he running?!?
Then Cody, the GM calls me (6/2) and leaves me a voicemail apologizing for the incident and that he'd like to discuss about what happened in person. I call him back about 3 hrs. later and I leave him a voicemail since he didn't pick up. Haven't heard back from him.
I host at least 2 events a month, so they lost future business.
I give it a one star because she (the employee) was very sorry and I could tell that she just doesn't have a great manager and owner to be helping her succeed in the business. No support or a team at this Little Caesars.

A lot of people complain about it, but I like that there's usually a slight wait for a pizza.. It guarantees freshness. I've never come away from this location without a hot pizza, which means when I get it home, it's still very desirable.  Other locations have stacks of them ready, but in my experience, those are always just warm enough to call hot and by the time I get it to the table it's barely warm and the cheese is rubbery. So I'm okay with this exceptionally busy little caeser's and make a point to come here.

Today I went in to pick up a Hot and Ready pepperoni and there was a delay because of the traffic.  The kid at the counter was very courteous and kept apologizing to everyone waiting. He even offered complimentary dipping sauces, which he didn't have to do.

Of course, the pizza arrived hot and the presentation and taste was better than expected.

However, they need to fix the way they help out customers.  Every time I go in here or my boyfriend goes in, they are always either doing stuff in the back or at the front staring at the computer where they take orders.  I have to literally go up to their face to make sure they see me in order for them to finally notice that I am there waiting for my order to be taken.  The employees seem like they hate being there.  I can just see it in their faces and how they respond to you that they just do not care at all.

One instant, I came in late night after coming back from class and the place was packed with people waiting.  You didn't even know where the line was or even if there was a line.  People were just waiting in the super small waiting area.  Again, I had to go up to the counter to make sure she saw me and she took my order.  She told me it would take 15 minutes so I believed her.  I stood next to another lady and I asked her how long she was waiting and she said 45 MINUTES! That is just not acceptable.  I was like wow, if she is still waiting for her order I am definitely going to be here for awhile (started regretting even getting pizza here in the first place).  So the lady next to me got her order and left, she was pretty mad at the employees since it really took a long time.  

After that, I was still waiting, 30 minutes have gone by.  The girl who was working took out a new batch of pepperonis and put it in the oven.  She just started calling out numbers that were way after mine.  Long story short,  I had to go up to her and ask her if my 1 pepperoni pizza was ready and she just say oh yeah here it is (didn't even say thank you or sorry for the long wait). Like I ordered 1 pizza! and they were giving it out to the people who ordered after I ordered.  I don't know what system they have going on here, but it just needs to change.

I approached the register to place a order of two large cheese and two large pepperoni pizzas. The cashier told me it would take approximately 10-15mins. I understood well and explained to them I would just be across the street at Vons and would return before then. I was gone no longer than 10 mins at the most. I returned to find a even longer line, and the two cashiers arguing. It was complete and utter chaos. This is what I observed while waiting for my order...

* A man walked in and stole someone else's pizza.
* The two cashiers leaving the front of the store to go behind the counter and talk to other associates. 
* The cashier accidentally dropping pizza after pizza while giving them to each customer. 
* An associate who did not work that day came in to greet everyone. She walked behind the back counter and continued to talk to and distract all of the associates.
* The manager was working with the associates behind the counter. He was very quiet and gave no direction or authority. I only figured he was the manager due to his uniform. (He should have been in front dealing with the upset customers rather than hiding in the back.) 
* I was told an approximate 10-15 min wait. I ultimately waited 45 mins. I had to continue to repeat the cashier what my order was. Did I mention it was my birthday? 

My overall experience was absolutely horrendous. I would never recommend going back to this site until the management is replaced. The associates were polite to me and reassured to me that my order was on its way.

Think management needs to give better training with employees and be more prepared staff wise for these rushes.,oZ9NBQVAIXhTAUlUIPRBsQ,0,0,2,6pTG4q8mQSu8xRvNlIJNiw

The store was full of people waiting, which I HOPED meant I would get fresh pizza, but no such luck. Kids barely finished one piece each and I am hoping they won't be barfing later it was so disgusting. What the crap is happening over there guys??? COME ON! I think it will be a long time before I get pizza there again :-(",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,3,0,1,f3iYAn4XVUiePdfvYjZltw

I have been here twice and they are so cheap on the ingredients. THEY SKIMP on the cheese and toppings compared to other locations.

If you have to go to Little Caesars..avoid this location and drive a little further!!

Whoever owns this particular franchise location is a cheap piece of s***",4_dS7cKMq7H4yU9f1DRxaQ,1,0,1,9TPw_D_9UJtmJp_NwjdMUg

I came here not too long after open, so i was fully prepared to have to wait for one or both to be ready, that was ok. The kid at the counter was nice but took way to long to even acknowledge me. When he did, i asked if any Hot-n-ready pizzas were prepared, he said only pepperoni. I asked how long would it be for a cheese. One of the cooks in the back (caucasian male with glasses) shouts at me from the back, with an attitude exclaiming that they had a 30 pizza order and i'll have to wait 20-25 minutes. I would've waited if that guy wasn't a jerk. I'd rather drive 15 minutes to the next location than deal with that. I don't expect top notch service considering its just a little caesars, but treating a polite customer like that almost immediately is crap.",C8iveMttlZB879rNcbgumg,2,0,1,mh95AyhABdbn-z9vKwPFOQ

I came into our closest Little Caesars again, I didn't call ahead because I started driving there before they had even opened. When I arrived there were already four people waiting for pizza.  I was not greeted, & I was the only person waiting to order. When the girl finally came out she acted all flustered and still said nothing to me. She ran around like a chicken with her head cut off and finally gave one pizza to one of the waiting customers. Then screwed around again for several minutes doing seemingly nothing and finally asked me how she could help me.  I asked for two cheese and two pepperoni, and she said I would have to wait 20 minutes.  there was a stack of pizzas hot and ready, so I asked what was available. she told me the only thing ready was chicken wings. all the pizzas that were sitting there were for phone in orders.  I had already been there 10 minutes at this point. so I left and went to a different Little Caesars.",mkogD43Yq1Au0n2B_79-fg,0,0,1,WQqnlyuhhbsvAJBNM7N3qw

They'll have ten people standing in there and you'll see their employees walking around having conversations with their co-workers.. Like really? In addition, their overall customer service is horrible. They get 1-star for good pizza and crazy bread.",-kRQLEDxrEBVNXImyAt_ug,1,0,1,OV_XEiRAx8ei39g-vMlB1Q

She said that they don't have any of them, how in the hell they don't have the ingredients to make that kind pizza! She was very ungrateful and rude!

I have 2 little ones and I refuse to sit and wait for 20 minutes because they can't keep up with the demand during their peak hours.  LIES ALL LIES!!  I called last night and was told the same thing, if I could make it in 5 minutes there's pizza.  Well I insisted on them taking my order because I was on my way home from picking up my kids, 15 minutes away.  Low and behold I get there around 8:45 and there's a bitching line and people waiting for pizza.  Call ahead, call ahead and don't let the manager tell you they're available hot and ready because they're lying.  Hot and ready my ass.
