Everything was cooked nice and tasted really good.  We dined at the bar and got to see the chefs cook/prep in front of us.  

We had:
- a fois gras parfait
- celery mousse with wasabi, beef stew gelee (jelly), and fois gras
- sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil
- langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut milk
- white onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg ""mirror"", and green asparagus
- lightly smoked salmon with fingerling in a buttery shellfish sauce with curry and baby leeks
- fois gras stuffed quail

The tastiest entrees for the menu were surprisingly the desserts.  There was a mango mousse atop an almond cake with toasted coconut ice cream.   There are chunks of mango in the sauce around it as well.  The almond cake actually sits on top of the toasted coconut ice cream.  In between these two, there was some sort of jam.  There was also a warm chocolate cake with creme de menthe sorbet and chocolate mint crunch which was also good.

If you're in vegas and are looking for some good fine dining food, definitely hit up L'Atelier De Robuchon.",-rNDXmeB2aqzK71qoM5QYQ,0,0,5,EEPRvA1jlnkTDnTm_qsyXg

The dishes was spot-on delicious and service was impeccable. But I have to agree with the last yelper's review that you can get this type of food in SF. Perhaps if we ordered more dishes, I would be more enthusiastic with this review.

I'm not sold on this counter-style eating. It's suppose to be more modern and interactive.  If I'm going to spend a good amount of money, I don't want to talk my neighbors or accidentally bump into his elbows. I felt sorry for the waiters, they had to reach over the counters to give us the food. Not very ergonomic.",K5pAN2dD-THL-wRBZmL5HQ,1,1,4,ziRTXywLFY7Vd38PPwkocQ
19420,2010-09-11,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I did what I could to keep it short for my review of Joel Robuchon, the exalted chef's fine-dining boite at the MGM Grand. I will make no such attempts in conveying my feelings about Chef Robuchon's small-plates restaurant, L'Atelier.

Robuchon (the restaurant) could be well personified by Grace Kelly, regal, elegant, breathtaking perfection... L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon might then be personified by Catherine Deneuve... coquettish, modern, a little more casual but no less enthralling. If Grace Kelly belongs on a pedestal to be quite rightly worshipped, then Ms. Deneuve seems a better fit between the sheets on an extended stay at the Hotel Georges V.

It would be far simpler a task for me to juggle two Buicks than it would to choose between Kelly and Deneuve. A similar quandary, it follows, to what I face when attempting to choose between Joel Robuchon and L'Atelier. Sometimes, though, these choices must be made and to be quite frank, courting a real Princess for more than a day might grow tiresome in the balance. Reluctantly then, I admit that if forced to, I cast my long-term lot with the fair Ms. Deneuve. In the same light, I would have to confess a slight preference for L'Atelier, a spot at which I would quickly agree to eat every single night. Here's a few reasons why...

Le Cocotte- Parsley puree at the bottom of a martini glass, topped with mushroom cream, and a raw egg (stay with me) and then more mushroom cream and a couple of sauteed mushrooms on top. Then they put the whole thing in a steamer until the egg whites *just* set. Creamy, yolky, mushroom-ey.. the richness of it all cut perfectly by the bracing green-ness of the parsley puree.

Le Langoustine- the sweetest langoustine you've ever tasted, wrapped with a basil leaf in a thin sheet of brik dough and quickly deep fried. Plated with a micro greens salad and basil pesto. Seriously, I could eat 50 of these.

Le Thon Rouge- Thin slices of tuna arranged on a plate with tomato-infused oil and sea salt. You can really taste the tomato in the oil and I don't know how they do that. Perfectly salted and the texture of the tuna is as magical as a first kiss. 

Le Saumon- A healthy portion of house-smoked salmon, plated with a potato waffle (with really deep wells, more surface area, more CRUNCH) and dill cream. The creamy crunchy potato, the smoky salty salmon, and the cool and herbaceous cream all conspire to create what might just be a perfect plate. 10 out of 10.

Le Caille- Quail stuffed with foie gras and coated in a citrus glaze. I am careful, as a gentleman, to confine my profanity to special cases. That said... holy fucking shit this is good. Served with a small pot of truffled potato puree prepared to the following ratio - 1 part potato to 1 part butter. It is not uncommon for a fight to break out over the last spoonful.

Le Foie Gras- Raviolis of foie gras in a chicken broth with Thai basil and herb cream. The ravioli are quite salty at first, but then it becomes apparent that they are a perfect foil for the rich chicken broth in which they float. The basil and cream add top notes and bottom notes and once again you are transported by a mere food item to some magical place where the London Philharmonic plays neighborhood concerts and hundred dollar bills rain from the sky.

Ris de Veau- Here's where we get to what might be the defining characteristic of a restaurant of this caliber. I wouldn't dare order sweetbreads at just about any other establishment. No thanks. But at L'Atelier? Mais bien sur! Seared on the outside, creamy on the inside, stuck through with a sprig of holly and plated with a lettuce leaf stuffed with onions and butter. One of the best things I've ever eaten and I almost let my prejudice prevent me from ordering it. Shameful.

Le Chartreuse- A souffle made with green chartreuse liqueur and topped with pistachio ice cream. Words cannot express how good this is. Eggy, Sweet, and a little flowery. Suffice it to say that it tastes like heaven in a ramekin.

Chocolate Sensation- Let's see if I can remember this right... melting Aragani chocolate on the bottom, then a disc of chocolate on top of that, then white chocolate ice cream on top of that, and then oreo cookie crumbs on top of the whole thing. Rob a bank if you have to. Kidnap a rich kid. Sue McDonalds for scorching your naughty bits. It will all be worth the effort to secure a bowl of this.

Look, I know I go a little overboard sometimes. I am well aware of my bias. But if you are looking to sample cuisine that is executed at the highest possible level... trust me, if you've got a steady job you can well afford the tariff of a visit here. My precious L'Atelier... that haunts me in my sleep and in my troubled mind weaves daydream tapestries of earthly abandon. Soon, my dear. Soon I will return to your loving arms and we will write epics to make Chaucer blush, and Shakespeare jealous. I am already counting the days.",yDbtyjFQKhqLhCFjfqQ08A,3,1,5,raeocZOyzVAP_HCkx2vCOw
23022,2011-09-14,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Amazing. Don't go to a show, but go to L'Atelier instead. This is truly an experience. You have to simply try it, because you can not even come close to imagining food tasting like this. The layers of flavors and textures in each course IS unimaginable. 

 We had 10 courses that took about three hours to finish. It appears that the chef really wants you to savor every course, and when you do, you really enjoy the complexity of some of the flavors put into a simple, but not so simple, piece of scallop or beef cheek. 

This restaurant is casual compared to Robuchon's other restaurant next door. I'm glad we picked this one and that we chose bar seating. The three of us enjoyed watching the chefs meticulously prepare some of the food as we waited in between courses. 

Our time here was simply wonderful. I have not had better food before eating here, and I am yet to have food that is comparable. Great place for a foodie while in Vegas.",4YpQuqbWOwLbHJpdFpCqDQ,0,0,5,94mzf67wzodoTofOpDmwmw

52948,2015-06-22,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Chef Joël Robuchon is better known as the chef of the century because he has the most Michelin stars than any other chef in the world! He currently holds a total of 25 stars combined at all of his restaurants, which is truly incredible. We decided to leave Chef Robuchon's 3-Michelin Starred restaurant for our next trip(?) and opted for the L'Atelier. The degustation menu at Joël Robuchon is roughly $500/person(!!) while the L'Atelier has their degustation menu under $200/person. The price tag is still quite expensive for one person, but we really wanted to try Chef Robuchon...so we saved up for a few months and treated ourselves to it!

The menu at L'Atelier is filled with so many good things...from their classic degustation menu, prix fixe, à la carte, and their saison (seasonal) menu! What's great at L'Atelier is that you can customize your prix fixe from a selection of dishes that the restaurant offers! After knowing that there was a separate seasonal tasting menu at L'Atelier, we decided to try the seasonal discovery menu instead of the degustation. For 9 plates, it is priced at $168/person. This works out to on average of $18.70/dish!

We were seated at the bar, and so we were able to have a great view of their open kitchen. All the chefs were working very hard, and because it was an open kitchen, they were all very quiet. None of the yelling/screaming going on here! This probably made it much more difficult for the chefs, because it would've been much harder to communicate with each other through the quiet working conditions.

Upon ordering, we were brought house bread which had a combination of 3 different rolls. We didn't eat too much because we knew we had a great journey of food ahead of us, :D but my favourite was the classic baguette and buttery croissant.

We didn't order any wine to go with our tasting menu because to be honest, the total bill would've been too expensive, so I ordered one of their cocktails instead. Concentrated on the fruit yuzu and blueberries, it was very refreshing! Fruity to the taste, it was well made and it also lasted me throughout the whole dinner.

Overall, our experience at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon was one of the best dining experiences we've had so far during our culinary travels together. We both agree that it was worth the price for the gastronomy and culinary professionalism that we saw and experienced. Every dish we enjoyed had a WOW factor, and everything was cooked, plated, and served perfectly. The service we received was also top notch, as all of the servers were polite and attentive, and so we left the restaurant happy. Next time we are in Vegas, we would definitely revisit the restaurant for their regular à la carte menu or customize a prix fixe because everything on their menu looked incredible.",u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,8,6,5,KvvmU4rfuxzINdLYtfVHjg

You do pay a pretty penny though - my bill was over $200 without wine/drinks.

We were there with a group of 8 so we got to try many different offerings.

To start the baguettes were to die for!  They make it fresh in house. 

From the small tasting menu we ordered: 
Scallop carpaccio with sea urchin
Fresh marinated anchovies with sliced eggplant confit
Traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras
Tuna belly confit on a young vegetable gelée
Foie gras ravioli in a warm chicken broth with herbs
Macaroni in a Comté gratin, green asparagus and smoked veal bacon
Maine lobster fricassée with mushrooms and creamy aromatic sauce
Caramelized kampa chi with soy and endive salad
Calf sweetbread with fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce

From the regular menu:
Steak tartar with old-fashioned French fries
Wagyu beef rib eye
Sea bass roasted on the skin, green curry and warm leeks salad

Dessert:
Green chartreuse soufflé, pistachio ice cream
Fresh raspberry surprise inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream
Panna cotta topped with corn ice cream, fresh citrus salad

All I can say is that each dish that came out was better than the one before.  Joel Robuchon is a genius.  

If you happen to come across some money and are not sure what you would like to do with it, do yourself a favor and make reservations at L'Atelier! You will not regret it!

Every dish was spectacular - the fish appetizer and the foie gras especially. The food, the service, the atmosphere - everything about the whole dining experience was perfect.

Expensive, but worth every penny. I went to several other Vegas restaurants in a similar price range, and this is by far the best. It was actually less expensive than I expected - about $150 a person.

81544,2015-02-01,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Food is good (not amazing), service is inconsistent and at one point deceptive.  

The food is a less fancy version of the main restaurant next door, so if you like ""new"" French cuisine, you'll enjoy this place.  I like traditional French cuisine with big, rich, and deep flavors, so I was not amazed by the food.  

On the food end there isn't much to complain about except that the foie gras course was lost in the soup.  That course needs to be reworked.

The service at this place needs retraining. When you pay a certain amount for a meal, you expect a minimum level of service which was not met in the following ways.

1. The foie gras course was described as ravioli to me and then as tortellini to the couple next to me.

2. My turbot course was visually smaller than the portion recieved by the couple next to me.  The server assured me that it was the same portion because everything gets weighed out, but even if this were the case, why would you serve a visually inconsistent dish to to someone sitting next to a couple eating 2 visually standard portions?  Since I sat at the bar area I observed several turbot courses being plated and mine was the only ine that was nonstandard.  The couple to my left got 2 standard portions and I ordered before them!

3. The couple to my right was served salmon with a different preparation instead of turbot without being informed that they ran out of turbot.  Apparently my nonstandard piece was the last one.  The chef did provide them with an extra dish of dover sole as compensation though.  

4. They made me wait about 10 minutes after I finished my last course (dessert) before asking if I received the dessert yet, then the server asked if wanted coffee or the check.  They even set a spoon in front of me to make me believe that something was coming.  The waiter then played it off like he made me wait because he didn't want to make a mistake since he almost served the wrong dish before.  If you screwed up and forgot about me just own up to it!

Bottom line 3.5/5 for food 2/5 for service.",S5W_Lfh4FQzF12CAOHRkQg,3,1,3,fKtc60-s33WKvRtCx3dJEA

We've done the 16-course menu before at Joel Robuchon next door, but the 9-course meal at L'Atelier was also a delight for the price.

It seemed like each course (up to dessert) was an improvement on the prior course.  While the oysters and langoustines were SO good, the onion tart was to die for, and the salmon the best smoked salmon ever.  Quail and foie gras was a delight, the ribeye the best steak my husband I've had, and the mashed potatoes?  Oh, I wish I had some right now!

The service was also amazing.  We asked our servers a lot of questions about their jobs, the kitchen, etc. and they went out of their way to answer (and seemed to love doing so).  We also mentioned how much we adored the bacon bread from next door, and the waiter was kind enough to go over there (it's a different kitchen) and bring us some bacon bread and cheese bread!  So thoughtful!

The only comment we might make is about the desserts - it'd be really nice to have a less fruity, more rich/chocolate dessert at a Joel Robuchon restaurant sometime.  This may be because with the many course meals we get that the dessert has to be lighter and fruitier, but that's something we look forward to trying sometime in the future - I'm sure it would be immaculate.",md2KdbQKvjDXgeswkOSKTg,2,1,5,fVP2tnTGzCGJd80tAglhlA
195294,2013-09-23,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I was extraordinarily disappointed with my experience at L'Atelier this past weekend.

The highlight was the bread. The lowlight was everything else. Perhaps it was just an off night, but my impression was that this is a restaurant that people think is good because it's expensive and has a well-known chef's name attached to it, and therefore tend to come away with their prior expectations confirmed, but is not actually good and gets by merely on its reputation.

I went with a group of nine and we all got the prix fixe tasting menu. Overall the food was attractively presented but significantly lacking in deliciousness given what's expected from a restaurant of this alleged caliber, and most frustratingly, took a preposterous three hours to serve. Each course is a mere two bites or so, and we were waiting 20 minutes or longer between each one, with no explanation. Water glasses routinely went unfilled for long stretches of time. The staff was reasonably friendly, but the awful pace of the meal really ruined the experience. 

The foie gras parfait amuse bouche was frankly pretty gross. Foie gras is much too rich and earthy a way to start a meal anyway - an amuse bouche should be something light and crisp (the gold standard being the salmon cone at the French Laundry). The menu also way overdid the foie gras, including it in three of the nine courses. This seems like pandering to diners who equate foie gras with high status without evaluating the actual execution (in another course, it was lukewarm; several in our group passed on it and requested something else instead - the replacement course the kitchen provided consisted of woven slices of ham). I suppose considering this is Las Vegas, perhaps that is not surprising, but I expected much better from a restaurant of this esteem.

Besides the bread, the scallop with sushi rice and the steak were both quite tasty, but everything else served was middling. L'Atelier was nowhere near on par with the actual haute cuisine restaurants it is pretending to, nor worth the exorbitant price (we were charged a ""large group"" fee of $125 that was not specified on the menu, in addition to the mandatory 20% service charge - including a modest amount of wine, the bill came to more than $300 per person). 

I know I'm swimming against the tide here but I urge you to examine whether you are paying for hype or for an actually valuable experience before making a reservation at this restaurant.",wkrdSG4CIKE5AWXjSNjrOw,4,0,1,CNYX2wI3ABJtd14I72f6Xw

First time I got seated right in the middle, everyone talked to us nicely, great stuff. 
When I went with my wife I got seating at the far end of the kitchen and no one came and talked to us except for our waiter who didn't bother to do any small talk. The manager who poured wine didn't open his mouth, where as he was chit chatting with others. Our side view of the kitchen was not that great. Basically the experience sucked. There were spots in the middle but maybe they didn't want to give us that spot. Do we need to tip the two blondes to get good seats or what?
Any way I don't know if anyone else had this experience. I felt like I could have gone to French Laundry instead of coming here for the second time.",zTCiwmfXb13gqqID4j5iVw,1,0,5,DYuGoHusWT8W2KgqXFhciA

Unfortunately, it did not live up to any of the hype for us. 

Service: This was mostly fine. Our main waiter was very kind and acknowledged we were celebrating a special occasion upon arriving. There was a gentleman, perhaps the general manger or sommelier, that really put a damper on the meal as he scowled at us and other customers and hovered around behind the bar for our whole time there. He was very nice and inviting to a couple next to us which made us feel like we were less valued diners. 

Food: Uninspired and underwhelming. We did not do the tasting menu, maybe if we did we would feel differently...but to be honest nothing looked that special or need-to-try on the tasting menus for us.
We tried a few dishes including the seared foie gras, sweetbreads, langoustines, and steak tartare. The langoustines at $60 were the biggest disappointment of the evening--three langoustines fried in wonton wrappers with a few dots of pesto. 

Overall, pretty disappointing. We were so excited to try it out, but the meh food and weird sommelier made us feel like we should have eaten somewhere else.",mpR8ooGpsyuyrxPYw02R3w,2,0,3,q8BFr6bYnn6dBlxFzbDjUw

Here's one problem...the restaurant next door, Joel Robuchon, is arguably one of the best restaurants in the world.  Just check out the Zagat ratings and other ""credible"" rating sites and Joel Robuchon next door is one of the highest rated restaurants...anywhere.  So how can you equally give 5 stars to its next door neighbor?  The second problem is similar in that people are giving 5 stars to restaurants that are...pretty crappy in comparison.  Come on folks...you can't give out five stars just because it was yummy or because you thought the service was really good...like I've mentioned before, if you want to talk to someone who cares, call your employee assistance program (EAP).  This isn't Asia where they cater to your every whim.  This is America, the land of the free, where service is bad, and it's all about me.

Now to the food...I'm tempted to give it three stars but there are some basic elements that make it good.  It's more than average, three stars being average, four above average, and five being exceptional.

Why four and not five?  Well...we ordered a lot of food and had a very wide sampling of the different items, and they weren't all exceptional.  But it's a Joel Robuchon restaurant you say...so what?  Armani makes clothes that are manufactured in China..ugh...Just because it has the name, doesn't make it great.  The biscuits are very good, but not all the bread was like next door.  Items on the menu range between ok to good, and maybe one or two items very good.  The presentation was very good, but just because it looks good, doesn't mean it is.  The mashed potatoes are definitely very good.  

I don't rate on pricing because if it's really good, people will go and pay what it costs.  But if you were looking at how much it costs to eat here versus next door, the pricing is very comparable.  

Coming up soon, a review on the restaurant next door...Joel Robuchon...the best meal I have had anywhere in the world....",IeExHU0GRxiAYp7HAx4fPw,0,0,4,kZu5dMxJ6JkBRUbrIclLQQ

Decadent.  Amazing.  Indulgent.  Memorable.  Delectable.  These adjectives were among the many that swirled around in my head as I enjoyed each course of L'Atelier's Seasonal Discovery Menu.

One of the highlights of our recent R&R jaunt to Vegas was definitely this wonderful meal.  We went all out and got the wine pairings as well, and I must say, it was worth the arm & leg we paid.  The open kitchen, color theme, and lighting were great and helped elevate our anticipation.  The sommelier, our main, and subsequent various servers (a different one for each course) were all quite professional and charming.

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE - Avocado and cilantro flavored grapefruit gelee.  Tiny in size - but big in flavor.  Complex and delicious, loved the avo, cilantro, grapefruit combo.

LE CRABE ROYAL - King crab on a turnip disc with a sweet and sour sauce.  Interesting play on 'ravioli'.  Another beautiful & delicious dish, plating was divine.

LA SAINT-JACQUES - Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil.  Peerless quality - so delicious, scallops are one of my favorite foods, and this was one of the best I've had.

LA CEBETTE - White onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus.  LOVED this - couldn't stop ooh'ing and ahh'ing as I ate this one.  Can you say tears of joy??  Wish I had the metabolism and time to sit around and eat these tarts all day. Hub made a quite spectacular version at home the following weekend (including butter poached scallops on top).  

LE FOIE GRAS - Duck foie gras with confit kumquats.  So good...and SO rich.  Never been a fan of kumquats - but excuuse me because this dish would not have been the same without them.

LA SOLE - Dover sole filet, baby leek with ginger.  A very generous portion of perfectly cooked sole.  Made me want hot steam rice!

L'AGNEAU - Lamb shoulder confit and steam garbanzo beans - this was my main dish choice.  The lamb was cooked down and the tender pieces were molded into a small cake-like portion, surrounded by the most vibrant green garbanzo beans, served in a tiny tagine, a beautiful dish.

LA CAILLE - Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes - this was the hub's main dish choice.  The quail was perfectly cooked and was delicious together with the potatoes.

LA PECHE - Summer peaches on basil sable, coconut milk emulsion.  Super fancy presentation, lovely hard sugar candy disc perched atop the dish with a glittery patterned sheen - ALMOST too pretty to eat.

LA FRAISE - White chocolate ice cream on an almond panna cotta, fresh strawberries and mint.  Perfect combination of flavors and textures.  Light and satisfying dessert.

THE WINE - We had champagne, whites, reds, and ice wine - all from France, and all to die for.

LE CAFE - Coffee or Espresso with one dark chocolate candy.  Perfect ending to dinner.

If you truly love food, this is what it's all about ~ delicious, fresh, beautiful flavors - prepared with passion, and enjoyed with a loved one!  Cheers!",rMsh3ceMqt7J74GJlaSdFA,4,3,5,djet9JFaELVnXMAsP5Zdfg

267968,2009-06-08,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I'd give L'Atelier 4.5 stars. It is truly one of the top 10 restaurants in Vegas, and one of the most unique fine dining experiences because of the casual setup of sitting at the counter, watching the head chef call out orders in French and the other chefs working away. The decor is very appealing - black and red throughout, with a dark sexiness to it but also touches of color. I love how they use food as an integral part of the design. Service is terrific. When I saw that the $75 prix fixe menu entrees had changed from what was online from cod to salmon, I asked our server if they could still do the cod, since I'd had salmon the night before. He checked with the chef and said no problem, even asking if I had a preference of preparation. The 5-course $75 prix fixe was terrific - foie gras parfait amuse bouche to start, then veggies with mozzarella, langostine fritter, cod or pork belly entrees (my dad and I shared both), cheese plate, and ice cream and sorbet sampler or tart sampler for dessert (again, we shared both, but if you can only pick one, go for the tarts!). Each course was fantastic! While still a bit pricey, the $75 deal is great considering normally your only options are to order a la carte at $20-30 per dish or to order the $148 per person tasting menu. I'd rank L'Atelier behind my other two fine dining experiences in Vegas, Picasso and Mix, but it's still one of the best meals I've ever had.

282806,2014-01-19,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Simply a terrible night at L'Atalier. Our party of 5 was seated at 8:45pm.

From the start of our meal, the timing of service was a combination of long waits, no explanation of the course and sub par food.

Our friends who ordered ala carte waited 45 minutes between first and second courses.

 The food on our first visit 6 months ago was just over the moon. This time beginning with a truffle pasta for the table to share we were underwhelmed. The pasta was heavy and creamy with only a hint of truffles. Not even in the same zipcode as the first visit.

285669,2012-07-18,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Last Friday, I had the pleasure of my second dining experience at L'Atelier. It was an exceptional dinner.  There will be a third dining experience and a fourth and a ....

Unlike many of those who have reviewed L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, I took no pictures of my food. I don't even remember all of the names of the dishes. What I do remember is this: it ... everything ... was simply outstanding.

Two of us were seated at the sushi-style counter that highlighted the kitchen and preparation area. This seating allowed us to watch the impeccable attention to detail that everyone touching the food took in its preparation and presentation. Fascinating.

On to the meal .... We both ordered prix fixe dinners; I chose from the five-course tasting menu (at $105) and she ordered from the four-course (at $78). The four-course comes with an appetizer, a soup, a choice of fish or meat, and a dessert.  The five-course allows one to experience both a fish and meat dish.

Beginning the evening were complementary offerings of L'Amuse-Bouche, a foie gras parfait with port wine and Parmesan foam. We both thought it was delicious. One of the beauties of L'Atelier is that I get to experience food that I wouldn't necessarily order. It forces me out of my comfort zone and expands my culinary experiences. For this, my taste buds thank me. 

As my appetizer, I chose the beef cheeks. The meat appeared to be pulled beef, topped with fine shavings of egg and what I believe to have been delicate radish sprigs and sprouts. My girlfriend ordered L'Hamachi - the yellowtail tuna tartar with tomato coulis.  She loves tuna, and this did not disappoint. 

These were followed by what my friend claims was the best soup she's ever had: L'Epanard. It was a hot spinach velouté on a delicate, creamy nutmeg royale. It was unique in my experience and clearly a winner. 

My next serving was a cod dish that consisted of thin medallions of cod placed on a bed of mashed potatoes, with capers.  The cod was light and flakey. The capers tended to overwhelm the delicate flavor of the cod in my opinion, yet the flavors did come together nicely to make a very satisfying dish. 

This was followed by my meat entree - La Haupe.  This was a French-style small piece of hanger steak with fried shallots.  Exceptional!  My friend had the cod, and her reaction to the capers (she's not a fan of capers) was similar to mine.

With our entrees, we were served the piece de la resistance; small servings of Joel Robuchon mashed potatoes.  These mashed potatoes are the most delicious potatoes to have ever passed my (or my girlfriend's) lips. With nearly as much butter as potato, these mashed potatoes are simply perfect.  Perfect.  I would refer to them more as a potato purée. They are flawless, having certainly been passed through a fine sieve to remove any hint of a lump. The taste is incomparable. 

Our meal concluded with two desserts, La Fraise and Le Chocolat.  Both, huge hits.

The presentation of all courses were beautiful.  Works of art.  The servers from across the counter were polite, friendly, appropriately attentive and helpful.  Each course was colorfully described in detail as it was presented.

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Yet I'll make an exception when it comes to sharing this fine dining experience at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.",NOJ8y2ranDvdKsnaE3356A,2,0,5,5c-5IzeEvpY9n9C6hv9gJw

A friend and i were planning to meet for dinner and her Chef Friend offered to make the reservation at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.  I had been here once before and had an amazing experience - that was in 2013.  Chef told my friend not to worry about the big price tag because we would be offered a $59 menu.  We tried for that, but NO our indifferent waiter (if that's his title) informed us that all we could order was one of two menus, (and a possible third vegetarian menu) so we got the $195 (each) Discovery menu of: an Amuse Bouche, Le Chou Fleur, Le Potiron, Les Huitres, Les Lentilles Rouges, Le Black Cod, La Volaille or Le Contre-Filet, La Pomme, and Le Chocolat.  We selected the second wine pairing level at $255 (each) which was  a fantastic choice -- the wines and the wine-presenter were/was superlative!  The foods were nothing special.  The panacotta dish had no flavor and the mixed textures didn't work at all.  The squash canneloni was cooked to perfection and was basically ok, if you like pasta made with squash. The oysters with butter cream sauce and green asparagus did not work at all, the oyster-flavor overpowered the sauce and the asparagus overpowered both in in terms of taste and texture.  The cod was fishy, Julia Childs would commend this as she always suggested waiting until the rigor mortis sets in -- most Americans do not favor this however.  The chicken was horrible -- dry and tasteless.  The steak was ok.  (she got one, i got the other and we split). The dessert was nothing special at all.
So that leaves the Amuse Bouche -- out of this world outstanding:   Parfait de foie gras au Porto sous une emulsion de parmesan.  Perfect flavor and texture (MORE PLEASE!)  The non-vintage Champagne (Philippe Gonet Brut) was particularly good with the Amuse Bouche. The soup:  veloute Esau au petit sale, chicharron moutarde et sauge aka lentil  soup was fantastic.  But who goes to THIS restaurant for soup?  And of course the piece de resistance was the mashed potatoes.  Again, who pays $1300 for two for mashed potatoes, lentil soup and foie gras parfait -- all about two bites each?  Disappointing to say the least!  Definitely NOT up to the standards of 2013 where they had lines of sous chefs with tweezers placing amazing textures and flavors on amazing food.  
The other wine proffered were Albert Bichot Domaine Long-Depaquit Chablis 2014, Alain Chavy Poligny Montrachet 2013, Alter Ego de Chateau Palmer 2011, Weinlaubenhof Kracher Beernenauslese 2015 and  Taylor Fladgate 30 year Tawny Port.  They were all outstanding.  Not big portions, but very very good.
Bottom line, SKIP this place.  I suspect that it is still living on a reputation earned years ago and if the crowds keep coming, they are happy to DROP the STANDARDS and if nobody says anything here or elsewhere people will keep coming.  So STOP going and maybe they will return to the standards that befit a $1300 dinner bill for two!",s-tYluswb2xphRwdctOTvA,8,0,1,kZdVTGm6eEKVNx2r1S3Dtg

not sure about the concept of bar seating, although it was cool to watch the kitchen and see them hand chop and make the steak tartare from steak to plate.  less formal than what I expected and for the price, but the focus here is on the food rather than service.

service was ok.  over the course of he evening we watched as our neighbor's butter slowly migrated in front of us.  despite having a reservation, we had to wait approx 20 minutes to be seated, probably because they do take walk-ins.

The honey and I celebrated Thanksgiving at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, and we had a wonderful experience.  We were seated at the bar, with a front-row view of all the action in the impeccable, zen-like kitchen.  There, we were able to watch the chefs carving up paper-thin slices of Iberico ham, meticulously plate delicate pieces of uni, and observe the head chef move deliberately through the kitchen like a shark scoping out prey (and making sure that the dishes were up to snuff).

The honey and I both ordered the seasonal menu and each had a glass of the house's choice of bottled champagne.  The champagne was the best I've had yet, and definitely set us back a pretty penny.  But it was worth it for the holiday experience.

Our faves included:
- foie gras parfait
- poached baby oysters
- white onion tart
- foie gras-stuffed quail with mashed potatoes
- and the two awesome desserts (apple cake and orange/chocolate concoction)

Even for ""not as fancy,"" this is a pretty fancy place with some really thoughtful and creative food.  

My only suggestion would be to close off the dining space from the rest of the casino--the stench of stale cigarette smoke was a little distracting to the whole tasting experience during the first few courses of the meal.

With the Michelin star come high expectations (and expensive price tag).  Not sure that the experimentation came through; we tried 5 small plates (la langoustine, la ventrenche, les champignons, l'oeuf de poule, la caille):  all were very good or excellent. We each had a glass of very good red wine (pinot noir and malbec) as well as liquid dessert (in the form of Tokaji). As difficult as it was to get a reservation, the place was half full.

L'Atelier's menu prices hit you over the head like a gas station billboard.  $45 for flank steak? $40 for risotto? $70+ for many other items? That is sticker shock!  I even peeked next door to see the Robuchon restaurant tasting menu - $250p.p. I know this is Vegas but WOW.

Money aside, this place has incredible food. I almost wish I'd gone for the tasting menu but we did the ala carte/tapas option. EVERYTHING was amazing. Though I complained about the flank steak, it's wagu and about as tender and flavorful as a rib eye or fillet. The crab salad is actually exceptional value as the crab is piled on. All in all L'Atelier is a culinary delight that will impress any foodie.

Service wise - it's great. Actually ""unparalleled"" would be a better way to say it. Especially for bar service. Couple that with the casual but elegant setting and you've got a winner here.

423803,2009-08-09,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Good, nice, but not worth the hype!

I've experienced some of the top restaurants of the world (Rockpool, Aria, Tetsuya's Sydney, Some in London, Rome and Croatia and hopefully El Bulli Spain soon) and unfortunately this one does not live up to the hype. This review is about the $75 tasting menu on the 9th of August 09. 

At $75 a pop, you would expect a fair menu served by attentive staff, who are not too over friendly and would be attentive enough to the point that your wine is always topped up. Well 5 stars for the wait staff. Excellent service.

Now on to the front of house/ maître d'. It was a Saturday night, busy as hell in the MGM and we walked right up expecting to be refused (but in these current economic times, Vegas is desperate for your money) and asked for a table for 2. It was 9:30 and we were told to come back at 10:15 and a table would be ready.
After popping down to Nobhill Tavern for a quick slurp on a cocktail, we moseyed on back to the restaurant at 10:15, and were told that patrons were difficult to move, and it would be another 10 minutes.  10 minutes passed and we were then told it would be another 15 minutes. My patience was beginning to wear, and although it was so late we could not go anywhere else, no kind gesture was offered by management as a way to say sorry ( a glass of house bubbly would have done the trick and softened us up) for the delays. 
At about 10:45 ( 30 minutes delay which is not heaps bad) we were sat at a table.

Now for the food.... Mediocre.
The vegetables in oil and balsamic reduction with aged mozzarella Di Bufala is a concoction I could easily make in the kitchen. 
Next course, the langoustine was no bigger than a small prawn cooked tempura style (I've had better at the local Sushi restaurant) The pork belly main was a definite WOW however! 
But the rest was... Meh...OK. Certainly not worth the $75 dollars, and certainly not worth the orgasms that most of the reviewers here have raved about. 
My opinion is that these guys probably mostly eat at 'Olive Garden' or 'Red Lobster' and that's gourmet to them, so this is amazing. NEWS FLASH. It's not. It's certainly good, amongst all the sh*t in Vegas (and believe you me, there is a lot of it in Sin city), but not entirely worth the $75 price tag.

Oh and by the side, the minimum price I saw for a bottle of red was about $50, and that was for an Australian wine I knew to retail for about $7.... Nice mark up Joel. I know restaurants to mark up wines, but this much is crazy. We opted for a $75 Oregon Pinot, which was fantastic, but still a little hefty in price. 

All in all a $230 (ex tip) price tag for a meal that left me feeling not much love. In fact I felt robbed. Thanks Joel, but I shouldn't have expected less in Vegas the city that wants all your cash.

431708,2007-12-17,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I was looking forward to this restaurant.  I at L'Atelier in Paris and it was stellar though with a casual atmosphere.  We were quite hip with the small plate idea and certainly didn't expect L'Atelier to be a tapas joint.

This L'Atelier lost a bit in the translation.  The food was good, but aside from the amuse bouche, nothing achieved the wow-factor.  The amuse bouche, which was served in a small clear jigger consisted of a foie gras flan, a very thin layer of a port reduction and Parmesan foam.  It was utterly delicious.

The cocktails were good, and a martini was $15 after the $2 up charge for a martini.  (Why a restaurant of this caliber cannot set a price for a drink is beyond me.)  The food prices at L'Atelier were higher than in Paris.  The small plates range from $20-45 an the entrees are $48-75 (e.g., an apparent 4 oz serving of halibut was $58 atop some vegetables).  We decided to repeat wonderful small plate experience from Paris and went with just small plates.  The server recommended 3-4 per person.

Things did not get dramatically better at this point, unfortunately.  The millefeuille salad was nice an consisted of two slices of wonderful mozzarella, two slices of zucchini, and two slices of eggplant in a basil oil.  For $20 it was good.  The foie gras, at $36 was about 2 oz of foie gras served with wonderful grilled bread.  The foie gras was nice, but did not compare to the Paris L'Atelier in quality or size.

Next we had a crevette and vegetable salad which comprised small poached bay shrimp (9 to be precise) served in a molded ensemble of finely minced vegetables, such as bell pepper, etc.  It was $28, tasty and refreshing, but at $3/bay shrimp I began to wonder.  We ordered the lamb chops, for $30.  I do not know where Jol finds his pygmy lambs, but it must be a precious source.  These lamb chops were attractive and had a piece of meat attached the diameter of a quarter and the thickness of four quarters.  There were precisely three of them. At this point it really dawned on me that they have no shame.  (Though the lamb came with a small pot of the signature mashed potatoes, which matched the Parisian version and taste of amazing butter.)  We also got the calamari and chorizo.  For $38, we got 1/2 cup of calamari and 2 tsp of diced chorizo.  It was very good, but c'mon.  Squid is about $3/lb.  

We wound up with a chartreuse souffle with pistachio ice cream.  It was truly special and a bargain at $12.  The souffle was a normal single serving size and was flawless.

The wine service here is absurd.  All wines by the glass were $15-20 and the pours were obscenely scant.  The bottle markup was approximately 4-4.5 times retail.  Again obscene.

For two people, with these very light servings, four glasses of wine, and two cocktails the total was $300 not including tip.  

I think this concept needs adjustment.  I was glad that we did not order the oysters.  For $28 one receives precisely three oysters, whose shells are the size of a 50-cent piece.  I don't care what sort of mignonette they make, no oyster from Seattle is worth $9.33 apiece in a restaurant.",S_AYUKYQ5qTQLWB_3i4B3g,2,1,3,qPsvQrgg0UDmgPKZDd9ppg

After 1.5 hours of terrible service I asked to speak with the manager, he indicated he would help with moving the dinner along, but it didn't seem to help much in all honesty. 
As far as food quality - small courses that were not memorable at all. Compared to Europa in Montreal where I had recently dined, this place isn't in the same league (and Europa is a lot less money for full course menu). In fact I'd have to designate food quality as very poor in this restaurant. The food was tasteless, and small courses were plated as if one were at Denny's.

Ordered tasting menu with wine pairing.  Their first pairing was Veuve Cliquot yellow label.  Really?  A bottle I can buy at a grocery store?  The hotel must have had a few cases they needed to unload.  

Anyway in a few cases there were some very good ingredients like the scallop, which was unfortunately overcooked and served simply in butter with not much else to accompany, no contrasting or complimenting flavors.  For a single scallop on a plate I'm not sure why it was overcooked but it's a shame because it was otherwise good quality.  One course was a devilled egg with crab.  The crab was a nice touch but at the end of the day it's just a devilled egg.  This is too simple and basic of a dish for this price point.  

I'm getting sick of getting foie gras dishes where you can barely taste the foie.  My impression is most diners don't appreciate the taste of foie so restaurants can get away with serving them as a ""parfait"" where the flavors are muted and diluted with excess cream, foam, whatever.  When I want foie I want a terrine or a seared portion.  The foie here was just that, some espuma, some foie custard that was barely discernable as foie, completely forgettable.  

It wasn't a terrible meal but there were some glaring mistakes and shortcomings for a Michelin rated restaurant that costs $700 for two.  

You'd be much better off spending that money at Raku, Kabuto, Yui, etc etc.  Basically anywhere off the strip.  This meal sealed the deal for me; no more high end dinners on the strip.

I was charged $10 for foie gras for supplement, which I'm totally fine paying for. But the supplement's portion was TINY. The foie in the amuse bouche was far more satisfying. I was very disappointed. 

I took my sister there for a treat, she was a good sport about it. I have been to the restaurant several time and always enjoyed my experience. But this time would be the last.

We went to Sage at Aria the next night, ordering 4 course tasting and sis got the 4 course a la cart. The bill came out about the same as here. The food at Sage was amazing and innovative. The decor modern and beautiful. The service was far more attentive and warm. Take your money there instead.",P5b_KkYgtyUi4AmBH7keLw,3,1,1,ESjsbhFL2_lmnAqjcXNO-w

They came with the quail stuffed with foie gras, which were great in their own right. My wife said it best about the potatoes though when she blurted out after one bite, ""I could bathe in these.""

This place is very expensive, reservations can be tough to get, and the portions are small, but Chef Robuchon makes some fantastic food. I debated 4 stars or 5, but the fact that I've been dreaming of mashed potatoes ever since I ate there 5 days ago pushed it over the top.",X2-WAO8c7_RrPsOYr193Jw,1,0,5,xuqqE1dc_1CzBIeGZVqv5A
515769,2011-03-22,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"DON'T EAT HERE!!!!! BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!

My wife and I were recently in Las Vegas and were excited to eat here given the rave reviews, but this dinner was by far the worst we had on our trip (We also ate at Boterro and Firefly).  If you are into dining at places solely for a unique (though not better) setup, and to feel special, bragging to your financially strained friends who can't afford to eat here, then by all means.

My wife and I both ordered the $155 tasters menu and nothing really stands out as being special, at least I can't even recall anything in particular that was memorable.  I laughed when I turned to my wife upon tasting our last dessert (some cured grapefruit with hazelnut ice-cream sundae) and she said exactly what I was thinking ""GROSS.""  One  of the dishes consisted of a seared scallop (one piece), but it was overdone, and really was nothing special on the palette.  A couple of dishes incorporated fois gras, but you would never even notice them in the dishes...actually in the stuffed quail you could notice it, but only because it came gushing out when you cut into it, not because of the flavor.

For those who want to eat, and feel like they have been fed, this is definitely not for you, and if you've had tasters menus before, you should already know.  Tasting menus are rarely designed to be large portioned, and gluttonous,  but they should present you with a unique combination of flavors; something with wow factor....NOPE, NOT HERE.  

The staff were alright, but slightly on the snooty side.  There is very limited actual table seating, and the majority of patrons must sit at a counter where you see chef's prepare meals for patrons of L'Atelier and the main Joel Robuchon restaurant located next door.  Good concept, however I was located right in the middle of the counter on the long side, where the distance between table seating and the counter seating is very narrow, so every 2-3 minutes I was being bumped by servers or guests.  This was very annoying given that the meal DRAGS ON for 2.5 to 3 hrs, and most of all because it is quite expensive.

I can safely say I will never eat here again, nor will I try the other restaurant.  When you spend that kind of money on a tasters menu, you should feel as though you have experienced something special.  I had high hopes, but I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",lI4bRCL4sIfs1CJrNDYWqQ,0,0,2,WJJyEDcN3IqpwiJXLOo74Q
525775,2010-01-16,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Joel Robuchon has 2 restaurants right next to each other and L'atelier is the more affordable of the two. They have a big counter surrounding the kitchen for diners with a few tables situated against a far wall. We were offered seats at the counter as soon as we showed up. 

We shared a delicious bottle of Bordeaux for dinner. We both chose the winter tasting menu, which can be viewed at the website. One food trend I don't really get is foams. Foams can be great but ever since I heard them referred to as resembling spit in your food, I have been more picky about seeing it on everything. The first course Les Moules was a rich soup containing mussels and croutons and topped off with, you guessed it, foam. I thought that the soup was tasty but the foam was unnecessary and I didn't like the texture of it with the soup. My husband disagreed with me and really liked the overall effect. The second course of langoustine was a big hit with both of us although I liked it slightly less than he did. For our main courses I had salmon and he had ribeye. Both dishes are served with pureed potatoes on the side. I thought that the salmon was cooked perfectly but the sauce didn't go with the fish at all and I had a hard time eating it. My husband's ribeye was perfect and delicious. The pureed potatoes were like eating pure butter that had the texture of potatoes. The cheese course was great. We each received a small portion of 3 different cheeses with bread and a small portion of greens.  For dessert we tried both the tarts and the sorbets and ice creams. Of the 5 frozen treats I enjoyed 2 of them, but many of them were half melted and I can't stand eating melted ice cream or sorbet. The passionfruit sorbet was out of this world! My husband absolutely hated his tarts and he said he was going to eat at French restaurants until he got a decent tart! 

During the meal we were surprised to see Joel himself appear from the kitchen and introduce himself to the party next to us.  We believe they ordered a very expensive bottle of wine as Joel soon asked the party to be served a complimentary bottle of champagne. The wait staff was very good, but I didn't like that they had to lean over the counter to serve us our food. Some of the shorter servers looked like their feet weren't touching the ground because they had to lean over so far! Also, our server got into a little dispute with the person who was a junior server right in front of us. We really enjoyed the drama but it was inappropriate in such an intimate setting. 

I don't like to eat in pretentious fancy restaurants. I just want to enjoy myself and eat delicious food. I felt like our waiter was a bit stuffy and cold. This restaurant was just over the edge of my comfort level. I felt that the food was complicated for the sake of being complicated and maybe in the process they'll fool people into thinking it tastes good. 

Overall, we were disappointed with this restaurant. Joel Robuchon is chef of the century but we weren't feeling it in the quality of the food we were served.  I have not eaten at a Michelin star restaurant before but I sure have had much much better food.",6BCJz3CMTmWqrI6JfFvsyw,1,1,2,TG95BSekMn64z720-qt2vA

My husband and I recently went there with a group of 5. We all decided to get the $155 seasonal discovery menu. Tip: They do pour half-pour wine pairings - you still get a good amount of wine and you are less stuffed and have room for more drinking later! The sommelier was one of the nicest, most knowledgeable sommeliers I'd ever met - he seemed to love his job and answered all of our questions effortlessly. In fact, the entire staff impressed us - there wasn't a single person who brought a fork or cleared a plate that didn't know exactly what we were eating and how it was prepared. 

Among my favorite courses: hands down, the langoustine carpaccio with lemon vinaigrette was the most inventive, flavorful and purely delicious thing on the menu. We also really enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad with basil oil and fleur de sel and three different types of edible blossoms, and turbot that melted in your mouth, and the quail egg/asparagus. They brought us plenty of bread to mop up all the delicious sauces, and after two fantastic desserts (one white chocolate/raspberry concoction with freeze dried raspberries and sorbet, the other a sponge-type cake with apricots, ice cream and thyme foam) they also brought us espresso and plates of miniature slices of tarts/pies because we were celebrating anniversaries. 

The execution was effortless and the timing was perfect. We had an amazing time and it was one of the best meals of our life! Kudos to the chef and the entire staff. If you only have one night for a long fancy meal in Vegas - I'd choose this one.",aAdlLi7FObOT0iizUrlr2Q,0,0,5,avWUuJMC5IKQsAaYF2P_wA

589444,2015-01-09,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I decided to take my wife to this place to celebrate for her birthday. Since I haven't been to many fine dining establishments before, I only have Providence to compare to. I'll get to that later.

I'm sure most of you know Joel Robuchon is a household name in the fine dining French cuisine world. And he's got more of that Michelin star thingy than any other chefs in the world. So that must make him the Michael Jordan of chefs. If you want all of that name dropping and more, you'll be going next door. We wanted to try this place because it was supposed to be a more casual setting without all the snobbiness.

So, what can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. Well, I loved the fact that we literally sat at the best seat in the house, smack in the middle of the counter. The decor is very modern, very Asian inspired. If you could get a counter seat, definitely do it over a table. You really get to see the staff at work, and it's worth the price of admission in itself.

We opted for the tasting menu, figuring it's the best of what they represent. The food itself was presented exquisitely, each dish looking like a work of art. They were not big in portions but it's not intended to fill you up, but more about indulging your palette. I liked every dish I had, especially anything with foie gras, except for the oysters. I'm just not an oyster fan and having tried what I believe is as good as they can taste, I still don't like it. Having said that, I was surprised at how light and refreshing everything tasted. My impression of French cuisine is very heavy and saucy, which to my surprise none of the dishes were. They also had two terrific desserts that were both amazing. On a funny side note, I saw a wagyu beef and foie gras burger that sounded pretty good for only $33 on their a la carte menu. When I saw them served to others, it was a mini slider about the size of two bites.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience worth at least once in your life. I still liked Providence slightly better just because I felt they had more seafood and were more experimental with the food. However, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is not too shabby themselves and it's definitely a close second. The only negative of the night was they had the National Finals Rodeo going that weekend and they had a big ol' party right outside the restaurant. So every time they opened up that sliding door, it killed the mood.",jujmUXnDFxs-bPLXv-_LmA,1,2,5,KZlHLqINiWNB6d0dh7WCEA
607635,2011-09-05,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"After reading the high volume of 5 star experiences here I was really looking forward to my dinner here. I rarely eat dinners this expensive. And because I was trying a restaurant that is owned by the ""Chef of the Century"" I had no doubt it was going to be good. Well, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Me and my friend ordered the seasonal tasting menu ($155 before tax and tip). Honestly, the meal was, for the most part, forgettable. The bread that they served us was not warm and was a bit too hard for my taste. The butter that came along with it only tasted good towards the end of the meal after it had become soft enough to spread. In other words, it was hard and cold when it was first served to us. 

As far as the food itself, I expected small portions. But very few dishes had flavor. The only two dishes that were good were the white fish and the lamb shoulder. 

My recommendation (and something I wish I did while I was here) is to order items off the regular menu before you get stuck with a big bill and food you may or may not care for. 

Other than that, the service and the experience of the place were great. If I ever come back here again I'm going to have to try the burger and foie gras sliders because everyone else around us was raving about them.",w9Jq6KE8ZAC9LnFOk8YOQA,3,0,2,779pkp8iD7la4guV8LJTtQ

The beef main - overshadowed by the beef fillet at Andres I had the night before. And dessert was simply strawberry, whipped cream, and biscuit. Meh. 

They sat us next to two loud, uncouth women who disturbed everyone on the bar, the waiters noticed that the other customers on the bar were not happy, yet did not do anything to apologise, move us or move them.

Having had the multiple meals at Joel Robuchon next door, I've seen what a good chef can do with food (lettuce soup with onion foam anyone?).  Can't really say that about L'Atelier - pretty sure the 1 Michelin star (old rating) was from service.

Came in to dine with some friends Jan 6, as their wives wanted something tasty, swanky, and not ""too"" expensive.  Having never dined at L'Atelier, I figured we'd try this place out.

We all tried the different menu combos, selecting our appetizers and courses.  Pretty much tried everything on the menu between the 6 of us.  Also had Williams Selyem 09 pinot.  That bottle of wine and the lobster bisque are the only two things I can really remember about the dinner now (I do also remember my main entree for other reasons, but we'll get to that in a bit).  Lobster bisque was amazing - can taste the complexity of the different ingredients in every bite, and not overly salty like every other place I've had it at - pretty sure I licked the bowl clean. :P  

Rest of the food was not very memerable.  Think we had an assortment of fish and duck and steaks, but none of them stands out in my mind as of this writing.  I do recall my braised ribs being ultra tender and had a good flavor, but the only reason I remember this is due to a horrific experience at Alex (now closed, @wynn) with what were essentially braised salt nuggets.  Every time I have braised ribs, I can't help but compare it with that...wrong reason, I suppose.

I will say this though, the bakers/chefs definitely know their breads and butters.  They are simply amazing.  The service is also impeccable and both servers and bussers  are really attentive to customer needs - but it's also a small(er) restaurant, so I kind of expect this, especially a JR place.  

Final bill with tips tallied something in the low 4 digit range for 6 - reasonable, if the food was any decent.  

Perhaps the food is better when ordering from the full tasting menu, but for that same price, I'm going next door for better quality everything...",2dyLiu5hinn729KJIE8-7A,0,0,3,G7pzuxKomYf3EN8U9m0hnA

It was really heartwarming when the staff and chef brought out a birthday cake for her and harmonized ""Happy Birthday"".
The wine:
We thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu with wine pairings.  Our server Eric was attentive and generous with the pour.  The sommelier was knowledgable and engaged us in education on his reasoning behind choices/pairings. His selections included wines from France, Napa and a crisp German Riesling. Eric gave us a copy of our menu and wine pairings because he anticipated the wine binge we would have when we got home.
Now, for the food..epic! All our senses were heightened. Each course was markedly better than the prior, if possible. Our favorites were the scallop carpaccio, the sweetest langoustine you will want to savor, le piquillo (stuffed piquillo pepper with smoked eggplant), and the quail stuffed with foie gras with the signature mashed potatoes.  I could have eaten a plate of the mashed potatoes alone. The only course that marred our perfect meal was our fish course.  We weren't fans of the turbot. It lacked seasoning and wasn't particularly memorable. Sitting at the counter allowed us to make new foodie friends who told us about their dining spots in Napa, San Francisco, and NYC. At the influence of one our dinning neighbors we ordered the jambon to add to our dining menu. The spices of the jambon were complimented by the tomato toast.

One of our server was a bit too busy most of the time to even refill our water or ask us anything about our food, and we had another server who was much friendlier and a bit more attentive.  Overall, the service was average, not in a place where it's more than $100 a person to eat, even if you are eating from the a la carte menu.  I did expect better, much better.  After all, this is from the same mind who created Joel Robuchon right next door that I absolutely loved from the standpoint of service.  

As for the food, the amuse was delicious.  Good contrast in sweet from the foam and salty from the foie gras, and the texture is spot on as well.  My next course was the la jambon, which is basically really expensive thin slices of ham.  I guess it was worth a try.  It was delicious.  Would I get it again?  Probably not.  My favorite dish of the night would have to be the red snapper.  It was so light and yet had so much flavor.  It made me happy inside.  Next came the foie gras quail, which was really forgetful.  It felt under seasoned.  Though beautifully presented, it was a real let down.  My boyfriend had the tasting menu, option A.  He asked for the egg with black truffles, which was good, not amazing.  Then came the lobster bisque, which I thought was excellent.  It had so much flavor.  Next came the beef cheeks, which was heavy but it balanced out with the small portion size.  Had lots of flavors though, so I think it was an overall successful dish.

Then came our desserts.  I love desserts, so we got three desserts for the two of us.  I had the raspberry dessert and the souffle.  My boyfriend ordered the panna cotta.  The raspberry dessert was more entertainment than anything.  It came in a white chocolate sphere, and the raspberry syrup they poured over it melts the sphere and inside is ice cream.  I wish the amusement lasted beyond that, but the dessert was on my so so list.  The raspberry syrup and raspberry gelee and raspberries somehow managed to just overwhelm everything else.  It felt like I just ate raspberries with sugar.  None of the ice cream or the white chocolate stood out and the textures didn't work with me either.  I wish it didn't feel like raspberry gelato to me, but it did.  The souffle was a bit better.  I liked the souffle itself because it was so light and the texture so different from other souffles as it was eating a more solid version of foam.  The ice cream I didn't think went well with it.  My boyfriends dessert was more interesting.  It had subtle flavors, and was good, but not wonderful.

So overall the night was good, but not amazing, not great, not what I would've expected from Joel Robuchon.  I would've rather just gone next door to his main restaurant.",f8E2w_ZcxrabHcrWlsN58Q,0,0,4,eGZI71kLh1uTaa0ybHjNhw

Atmosphere was contemporary with a focus on the kitchen area where you can watch all the makings of the food.  The bar-type setting was original and functional.  Be sure to make reservations, especially on a weekend.  

I had the summer prix fixe menu for $79 and a glass of champagne (which I forgot the name).

Amuse Bouche - Foie gras w/ port reduction and form Parmesan served in a shot glass. 10/10: I've never had an amuse bouche that wasn't delectable, but I wanted thirds and fourths servings of this particular one.

Les Legumes - Layers of tomato, eggplant, zucchini with Buffalo Mozzarella and dabs of Basil puree on the side.  7/10: This was my least favorite dish, yet it was still enjoyable.  

La Langoustine - Crispy Langoustine Fritter with Basil Pesto.   9/10: The textures involved were smooth and stiff while well balanced.

4th dish - Can't remember the dish, but it had beef (I want to say some type of hanger steak) and mashed potatoes.  9/10: The mashed potatoes were buttery, rich, and creamy.  It's actually the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The beef was well seasoned and very juicy.

Les Fromages - Blue cheese, Creamy sheep cheese and Camembert.  9/10:  I wish I could savor the cheeses fully, but I was already borderline full by the time I reached this dish.  I love cheese and L'Atelier was very close to representing a variety makes of cheese with only three types.

Sorbet Selection - 8/10:  By this time, I was was pass full, but I did try to savor each sorbet.  I believe there were at least 6 different types.  I remember one making my face wrinkle due to the level of tartness.  The company I came with had the traditional tarts, which were tasteful and also had a very acidulous tart.

I would definately come back here when visiting Vegas.",UbApLtBPj23-HL2VHVpc5g,1,1,4,S5sYBOLDyI9smMvXjrumFQ

Beautiful decor. Nice Ambience. so-so food, doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. 

We ordered the $59 three course meals. I had the asparagus soup, prosciutto, and a chocolate cake. how much do you think the asparagus soup and a chocolate cake cost? for me, less than $13. So I basically pay about $45 for a 5-6 mini slices of beef(prosciutto). It's a ripoff. And the food wasn't that exceptional.

Basically you pay more for dining in a fancy restaurant. They give you world class service and bland food and charge you an arm and a leg for it. It's overrated. 

I think people go here because they want to be pampered and treated like royalty eventhough the food is subpar. good for them. But for me, if the food doesn't cut it, nothing else matters.",vtTbuELkykJ0I91kZ54feg,8,2,3,flvM-LlbdV3XIy02309sKw

We returned and took advantage of the $49/person L'Unique Menu served from 5:30-6:45PM. We were brought two baskets of gorgeous bread and fine quality butter that we couldn't stop eating. Then got even more refills. The L'Unique has 3 courses with 2 choices in each course, so each couple ordered both. First course: Creamy cauliflower soup--very rich with bits of buttery croutons OR charcuterie platter--generous selection of cured meats and pates which made us eat even more bread. Second course: Veal cheeks--braised with a syrah sauce Or cod fillet--cooked perfectly with a lovely, light butter sauce. Third course: Peanut butter mousse--specks of gold flakes surrounded the mousse OR mascarpone mandarin orange cake--topped with a white chocolate sliver; this was refined. We ordered a very nice bottle of red French wine for $40. What a great value for such a high end restaurant compared to other places in Vegas. One thing to note is that all three courses are brought at once on a large platter, but in separate dishes. My only complaint is that the entrees were not hot. (thus the 4* rating). Maybe we let them sit too long while savoring the first course.

876315,2011-08-10,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Sigh. We were very much looking forward to this meal. Ever since the fine dining scene exploded in Vegas, we've been wanting to try this restaurant. The concept is great. We really enjoyed sitting at the ""bar"" and watching the kitchen work. I can't remember many more times when I preferred rubbing elbows with the neighbors to the comfort of a table. That said, we expected much more for the price and acclaim. 

We both ordered the fixed price seasonal discovery menu. I won't list off all ten courses because you can be assured that everything will be good. However, the only items that really stood out were:

Langoustine carpaccio - I've never had any form of lobster raw, and this was outstanding. It was seasoned perfectly.

Foie-gras stuffed quail - absolutely delicious. But, foie-gras, like bacon, makes everything delicious so it's almost cheating. I would expect foie-gras stuffed haggis to be delicious, and I *hate* haggis. 

Dessert - we had a strawberry sorbet (with pieces of strawberry!) with white chocolate ""crunch"" and an apricot cake. I can't remember the exact details, and the online menus don't list the items.

So, out of the ten courses, four stood out. Out of those four, two were dessert. Everything else was pretty good, but I've had just as good for a lot less. This on its own is not enough to warrant a three-star review in my book. 

Service overall was very good. The servers are behind the bar and are able to serve you easily with minimal intrusion. Our courses were timed perfectly, and we only had to wait a few minutes upon finishing one before starting another. However, there were some lapses in attention to detail that ultimately left us a little disappointed:

Food presentation - the chefs used tweezers to place each dish component perfectly. The servers delivered the dishes with bare hands, leaving smudges and fingerprints clearly visible on the plates.

Cell phone usage - an expediter was texting in clear view of the patrons while waiting for a dish to finish.

Rushed cleanup - busers were a little too hurried to clean up ""tables."" It was pretty distracting and stole attention away from the kitchen.

Smoke - the entire restaurant smelled like casino smoke when we first sat down. I'm surprised they let that happen given that much of what you taste is what you smell.

Closed door - the door to the restaurant is a large, heavy sliding glass door. It was open when we arrived. It was closed when we got up to leave. It was closed while we waited to see if we should just open it ourselves. It was closed until we opened it.

I know these aren't big things. However, for $200 / person, I expect to be impressed by the food, decor, service, and attention to detail.",JRkVLt7xIlL11kDc3xPLww,1,1,3,QZWqS3cyj9Xoi3e5htzb6A
887250,2013-05-28,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I was trying to figure out the number of stars to give L'Atelier and finally settled on 2 stars because the definition ""Meh. I've experienced better"" is exactly how I felt about L'Atelier.

Every aspect of the dining experience was underwhelming, starting from the menu that was presented to me with bread crumbs all over the pages (which made sense actually, because the bread was so hard that it was hard to cut with a knife without crumbs flying everywhere). The wine menu was far too expansive, and the problem was further compounded by not being able to flip the pages properly because the holes weren't punched into the menu pages at the correct distance from the edges of the paper.

Having feasted at Bacchanal in the afternoon, my boyfriend and I weren't very hungry, so we ordered a selection from the menu of small tasting portions: foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes, caramelized kampachi with soy and endive salad, poached baby Kusshi oysters with French salted butter, tuna belly confit on a young vegetable gelée, lobster bisque, and a sea urchin dish with pea gazpacho. 

The dishes were definitely hit-or-miss, sometimes within the same dish:
- The foie gras stuffed quail was very rich. I didn't have much of it, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it.
- The kampachi was saturated with soy on the outside, making it too salty. The inside, which was rare, was much better.
- The baby Kusshi oysters were some of the best cooked oysters I have had and definitely the best plate we had. Try it with a sprinkle of the spices on the side.
- The tuna belly (which was cooked, sadly enough) tasted like what I can only imagine catfood would taste like. It was extremely salty and had a strange chewy texture I didn't like. I took one bite and handed the rest to my boyfriend. 
- The lobster bisque was good, although the morel mushrooms didn't do anything for me. I would have preferred just the bisque, without the added chunks of lobster and mushrooms.
- The sea urchin dish was good, but would have been better if it were less chilled.

The service overall was fine, but slightly sloppy. For instance, they didn't list the correct year for the type of wine we ordered from the menu. The waiter was dressed in a somewhat sloppy manner, with half of his black shirt tucked in. The overall experience left a lot to be desired - it was the least impressive experience I've had at a 1 Michelin-starred restaurant or equivalent (L'Atelier was awarded 1 star in the 2009 Michelin Guide for Las Vegas).

That being said, the diners around us seemed to enjoy the meal immensely. I'm sure there are those that would enjoy L'Atelier during a Vegas vacation (say, those from small towns or cities who don't usually have access to some of the best restaurants in the country).

896342,2007-04-25,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This review is from our visit in April on Friday night at L'Atelier de Robuchon NOT THE MANSION. We had a dismal experience despite one or two dishes, like the foie gras,  of high merit.

We have been to L'Atelier in Paris twice and went opening week at the MGM last year. We were huge fans of this restaurant and loved the concept. We steered everyone here when we talked about Vegas food. We were a party of twelve.  It was a disaster. It took exactly 75 minutes from the time we ordered until the time we got our first course. The amuse bouche took 50 minutes and it was argula gazpacho in a shot glass. It tasted like a wheat grass shot. The first two wines we ordered, the waiter returned 10 minutes later to say they were sorry that they were out of stock. We did not find a bottle they had in their cellar until 45 minutes after sitting. Then 20 minutes after taking our order they informed 4 of us who ordered it that they were out of sea bass. We had to get up twice to ask the general manager, Emanuel, to help speed the process. 

The waiter could not handle our group by himself and could not keep up with pouring the wine, etc. I asked him to let me pour the wine myself so he could get get the food moving and he refused. We witnessed the manager and the main sous chef in an argument over how slow it was going. It felt like opening night. the food was totally mediocre, no one was hungry after waiting so long. 2 1/2 hours we were finishing up. Another customer came over and asked us if we were noticing how slow the service has been tonight and how they wanted to walk out after only getting 4 of the 10 courses on the $175 prix fixe. 

We received no apologies, no comps, nothing for our wait. And then the shock which should not have been so shocking considering we knew how expensive it was going to be, $2700 for the the bill (FYI, you can't find a wine under $100 on the list) for 12 and they added $475 as a fixed 20% gratuity, we overheard our waiter use the ""F"" word over the fact that we did not want to all order the prix fixe menu.

We started with an amuse bouche, a shot glass filled with a cucumber gelée topped with Crème fraîche and mint. It was fresh and crisp, a definite palate cleanser. Next was Les Legumes, buffalo mozzarella layered between zucchini and eggplant. The dish was very tasty; several flavors were unleashed with each bite. La Langoustine followed, a buttery langoustine and basil leaf coated with a perfectly light tempura served with a small salad, and basil pesto sauce decorated the plate.

Entrees followed, La Boeuf, Wagyu beef rib eye. The meat was prepared beautifully, it was tender and delectable. We longed for more. And Le Saumon, Scottish salmon with tomato and capers and fried strips of potato. The salmon was fantastic. We both were given our own cast iron dish filled with pommes purée. The smooth rich mashed potatoes hit the spot.

The next course was Les Fromages or a selection of cheeses and bread. There were three: a Roquefort blue cheese with great veining, a pungent cow's milk cheese, and the third was our favorite, but the name escapes me. I am unable to recall what breads were served to complement the cheeses, as well.

Lastly, we had Les Tartes and Glaces Et Sorbet for dessert. I started with the selection of tarts, six if I remember correctly. I thought all were delicious. Next, we dug into the sorbets, five, I think. The chocolate and raspberry were favorites. We concluded our meal with espresso.

Dinner took about two hours start to finish. We did get a bit antsy by the end of the meal. However, we enjoyed the experience. It was different than were used to and the attention to detail is amazing: flavors and presentation. Service was great for the most part.

The smoked eel was somewhat unctuous and certainly nothing special. After having been taken off the menu for some time, the cebette (white onion tart) has made a return, albeit without the familiar asparagus tips, smoked bacon and quail egg ""mirror."" The new version is adorned with thinly sliced root vegetables that give the dish a decidedly bitter flavor that immediately gave rise to a case of indigestion. A major failure here. The hanger steak was ordered medium rare but arrived medium. It was fair, but sinewy and, of course, overcooked. Perhaps my fault for not sending it back for a medium rare replacement. The shishito pepper accompanying it was more than a touch bitter. In better, past versions, the pepper has had a slightly sweet pungency that perfectly complemented a (perfectly cooked) steak. No such luck this time. The bitter brown seeds inside the pepper indicated that it was past ripe. My server brought me the braised beef cheeks next. Odd since I didn't order them. He said he ordered them for me. As I said, odd. The meat was a grayish and overcooked lump; the red wine reduction an acidic and cloying flavor mask. I ate two bites of this thoroughly unpleasing dish, an uninventive lead weight. The famous Robuchon whipped potatoes that came with the beef cheeks were, as always, rich and delicious, but man--and chef--cannot live by whipped potatoes alone. And certainly not at LDJR's prices. I noticed again that the French chef came out to chat up some diners who were speaking French amongst themselves. I have seen this happen before and can't help wonder why he can't deign to say hello or ask about the dining experiences of any of the non-French-speaking diners at the counter. Overall, a very disappointing meal. So much so that I am taking LDJR out of the rotation after six visits. Chef Robuchon needs to give some attention to his Las Vegas workshop, where many offerings have grown stale in both concept and execution.

When you first arrive, you immediately notice the beautiful black decor and the kitchen in the center of the restaurant surrounded by a bar.  The best seats are at the bar by the way.  You get to watch every dish being prepared and it just feels very casual and relaxed as opposed to sitting at a stuffy table in a quiet dinning room.  All of the service from start to finish was superb.  Our server was fluent in 3 languages and was sharp as a tack.  He didn't miss a beat and helped us find 2 great bottles of wine.  For our meal, we chose the seasonal discovery tasting menu that evening.  You can order al a carte here, but I highly recommend doing to the tasting menu. 

Here is a snippet of the courses that were served:
-Vegetable fondant topped with a delicate avocado cream
-Sea Scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil
-King crag a la plancha, vegetables with lemongrass oil
-Sole filet, baby leeks, crispy onion rings and ginger
-Blackberry compote with spice cake, rhubarb sorbet

The execution of each dish was flawless and the presentation was beautiful.  I think I actually cried a bit while I was eating the Sole filet.  The sea scallop was the single best piece of seafood I have ever put into my mouth.  I just closed my eyes and enjoyed every single bite like it was my last.  

We finished the meal with coffees, ports, and espressos and were happy full.  Not bad full, like some tasting menus leave you after 9 courses.

In all seriousness, I'm not a baller in any language, but it's nice to splurge every so often just to give yourself and your significant other a treat and also reward yourself for working hard to get where you are today. Las Vegas is a great place to fulfill your urges and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is the ultimate sin. 

We actually tried to get into the bigger and more formal Joel Robuchon restaurant next door but found out that they were closed for a few months. I guess that's how the Europeans roll, season long vacations. 

We were a little early but got seated anyway. I'm a little glad we arrived early because we were seated near the front at the counter with a perfect view of the kitchen. We saw the EC running the pass with a very firm hand. Nothing slipped by him at all and he was on everybody's ass for perfection. Cool to see. 

'When in Rome', or Paris in this case, was the attitude of the night. We went all the way and ordered the full tasting course along with wine pairings. There's so many reviews of the same items so I will do raves about my faves. 

Le Crabe Royal - King crab on a turnip disc with sweet/sour sauce. On paper, it doesn't sound that great, but you definitely have to eat it to love it. Wow. The crab is just perfect and the sauce is subtle enough to add that little flair that is needed. Second best crab ever. (Hokkaido's the bomb) 

La Saint-Jacques - Sea scallops cooked in it's own shell topped with chive oil. Perfectly cooked in it's own juices. The texture was amazing and the little aromatic oil give it a nice finishing touch. 

La Cebette - White onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus. Absolutely the shining moment of the night. What a perfect combination of textures and flavors. The flaky tart was absolutely amazing and combine that with the crisp asparagus and savory bacon, you have an inspiring dish. So inspiring in fact that I went home and tried to recreate the dish myself. Not bad an attempt. 

The Sommelier was a great guy and he paired everything up as well as you can pair it up. He was pretty damn generous with his pours but maybe because we were the only ones there for a while. Great great wine. He wrote down the wine list after our meal so that we can note what we indulged in later. 

I would call the dress code 'Resort formal' (Such a thing???) We dressed up and we felt overdressed compared to the people coming in later dressed in bermuda shorts and aloha shirts. Most diners though were dressed nicely. No ties but just very nice. Then you have one of the casino whales walking in with his entourage of 20 groupies following close behind trying to get a table. Whale was dressed in a white under t-shirt and golf shorts with his belly hanging out all over the place. He had an untrimmed Santa beard and goatee and just walked in like he was wearing a tux. Yet, the EC and manager kissed his ass regardless of his appearance. What a life. 

A great experience with great food, great wine, and great company. I would love to do it again. Hopefully the other restaurant is open next time next door.",n3JHodOofpXO3wtSYdbOsg,6,5,5,uvr9dPFlFrLsfFU92x6n4Q

You know it's going to be different the minute you walk in and see the modern piano black, chrome, and red decor.  Sit at the bar and watch all the action.  Part of a new trend (at least, for me) where the chefs double as servers.  They didn't offer the $75 tasting menu when we went.  Instead, we had to get the much more expensive 10 course Discovery Menu.  It was worth it.  Be prepared to sit for awhile, like at least 3 hours.  Not a good place for a pre-show dinner.  This is an event all its own.
     Each course creative and well thought out.  Functional art.  Not only good to look at, but real delicious food.  The complex flavors and textures  always leave you wanting more.  Of course, I didn't love all the dishes.  But, that's the best part of a tasting menu for me.  I get to try out as much of the restaurant's menu including some things I wouldn't order if I was limited to a few courses.  The Discovery menu is quite adventurous and includes: foie gras in three different courses, oysters, dover sole, lobster, and smoked salmon.  We also ordered skirt steak off the a la carte menu, which was my favorite.  The simple things are done so well.  For example, the best part of the foie gras ravioli in warm chicken broth with herbs was not the ravioli, but the perfectly balanced chicken broth.  It was, hands down, the best broth I have ever had.  I wish I had gallons of this stuff.  
     I could never justify getting the Discovery menu again but I will definitely go back for some a la carte items if I'm ever near the MGM Grand.  This is a definite must for adventurous appetites who appreciate food that is artfully and painstakingly prepared for taste and presentation.

That was fine except the kitchen messed up our order some how so we had a 20 minute wait before the onion tart - it was now nearly 9.45 and we had eaten an amuse bouche & 2 tiny crab and scallop dishes (don't get me wrong - we eat a lot of tasting menus, small is good BUT a 20 minute wait for course 3 is not, especially when a wine flight is involved!).  We were pretty starving by the time we received the tart (actually one of my favorite courses) so when our slightly overcooked sole arrived we did not, as we should have done, sent it back.  Mine was slightly overcooked but my husbands was v overcooked.  Our mistake - it was a no brainer to send it back but we didn't want more delay - its now well after 10pm.  

We were not that impressed by the wines either - and the flight is expensive (cant remember how much but over $100 each).

I was looking forward to the panaccotta as I am a bit of a fan and have eaten hundreds but I felt it was lost under the ice cream and also a little runny - in fact the whole dish was - I suspected it had been left for a little while before serving.

All in all we felt this was one of our more disappointing fine dining experiences.  We had had a big discussion with friends about expensive dining and how when you have a great experience you cant believe you don't do it more often but a slight ""miss"" makes you feel you are insane to spend this much on a meal.  Unfortunately this was one of the latter experiences and totally unexpected given our great experience at Christmas..",8koXc0yIdzCnvb3T0Gxmdw,0,0,3,ykCHrB44O3h0F17B-42NGw

My date and I quickly calculated our fantasy L'Atelier meal, which would've easily cost $$$ alone for our fritter basket. I shudder to think what it would be with oysters tacked on.

I originally had a reservation at Joel Robuchon, but thanks to an unforeseen six-hour flight delay, we couldn't make our reservation. I.was.devasted. While I was sulking in the corner, the boy made a reso at L'Atelier the next night.  I loved that L'Atelier offered a fine dining meal without the stuffy pretension. The boy and I sat up at the counter with front row views of their open kitchen. Since we had a late lunch buffet, we chose from the small tasting menu:

Le Kampachi
Delicate, beautifully garnished with a nice touch of flavors without compromising the freshness of the fish

Les Huitres
These poached oysters were my favs of the night. Much like the kampachi, the dish was light yet well-dressed with lemon-butter. I would've just been content with a dozen of these

La Langoustine
Um, can I have a basket of these? You can't go wrong with something fried and lobster-esque. 

We also ordered a fish (john dory, possibly) and La Caille (foie stuffed quail). Both were superbly prepared, but didn't have the wow factor like the first three dishes. 

For dessert, we picked La Framboise, a chocolate sphere which revealed the ""the surprise inside"" when our server poured warm raspberry sauce over our plate. A beautiful way to end our meal.

What started out a way to salvage a Joel Robuchon reso, turned out to be one of the best nights of the trip. While I've yet to dine at JR, but I'd return to L'Atelier in a heartbeat!",1LdXqpTv0bcKQVkQB6Lttg,4,3,5,hqUN-NClPaIHcx__o3MKWg

While we'll probably have to check out the Mansion next time to see if he is truly superior in comparison to some of our favorite chefs like Thomas Keller or Julian Serrano, we walked out pretty impressed with L'Atelier.  The 11 course Discovery Menu took almost 4 hours to eat, so make sure you have a lot of time, but getting the opportunity to chat with the chefs in the open kitchen/counter top space was a lot of fun and made the time fly by (make sure you request a seat at the counter with your reservation).

The food compares in sophistication and presentation with Picasso, but in a more casual atmosphere (no jacket required).  If you go with the tasting menu, you're getting a lot of courses, so they tended to be more bite-size and probably a little more delicate.  Surprisingly, there is quite an extensive menu selection if you choose to go a la carte (I counted over 40 items you could mix and match, excluding cheeses and desserts!)

The most memorable dish for me was the scallop, served on its own shell, in a broth, that was probably THE most naturally sweet scallop I have ever tasted (even better than topnotch sushi restaurants, like Matsuhisa). There was also a superb cod in vegetable broth.  The chefs here really know how to concentrate A LOT of fresh flavor into seemingly simple-looking broths and marry them with subtle seasoning.  As expected with nouvelle french cuisine, there was a little pretentiousness with all the foams and micro-chives used (to our bemusement)- maybe a little excessive, but they never clashed with the flavor of the food.  

I probably would have expected a little more from the wait staff for the prices that you're paying, but the overall experience was memorable because we got to chat with the chefs, who were superfriendly.  We definitely enjoyed ourselves and had a wonderful night.  I highly recommend L'Atelier, especially if you've gotten a little bored of the same old rotation of dishes at Picasso or Michael Mina (which are still excellent in their own right, but need to change up their menus more often).",FY77x6pWr-Uy8phv_72SPQ,1,2,5,Bz_BWw7tD3R2bxT3EdCxWA

Great dinning experience. We planned to celebrate our one year anniversary in Vegas and this place was one of the ones recommended by our friends. Loved the bar experience and being able go watch the chef meticuouly prepare and plate our dinner.  I think I say this everytime we visit a ""chief's table"" restaurant,  but I am always humbled to watch the professionals as they prepare my meal.  

As I was pregnant at the time the chefs were very accomadating and made sure to exchange certain dishes from the seasonal tasting menu to fit my need.  Everything was outstanding, especially the scallops (which they had to 86 due to popular demand) and the foie gras stuffed quail.  

Seeing the executive chef that night was awesome.  He was constantly thinking ahead and micromanaging everything. This may sound like a negative thing,  but when your boss is Joel Roubouchon you cannot serve anything but pure perfection.  Very respectable.  He even signed and dated our menu.

Our menu was as follows:
-l'amuse bouche: foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam

-le homard: lobster carpaccio with delicate aromatics and shellfish extract

-la saint-jacques: sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil

-la langousine: langoustine a la plancha with green curry and cilantro

-l'oeuf de poule: chicken egg miroir on a tofu and spinach mille-feuille (we added truffle)

-la sole: sole in a shellfish-butter sauce with potatoes

-foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled mashed potatoes

-la mangue: mango mousse atop an almond cake, toasted coconut ice cream (love this ice cream!!)

-le chocolat: warm chocolate cake, creme de menthe sorbet and chocolate mint crunch (hubby had this and said it was delish!  I just got to stare at it hehe!)

-le cafe: decaf...

Only downside is that from time to time they need to open the door to allow more guests in. This causes smoke from the cassino to come in.  Not really the way I imagined enjoying my meal.

Well worth a trip!",-qnZYtMnvPt4XWYH5oXDUw,2,1,5,DeE1lYrtp_-yeBJkSSOL8g

Anyhow, although the ambiance is nice - classy yet not pretentious, I didn't think the food was to die for. 

We started off with a cheese plate - which I'm not much of a cheese person to begin with. I'm not sure if this was the thing that offset the night but if you aren't so much exposed to ""exotic"" cheeses much, I'd pass on this. I found 4/5 cheese to be extremely pungent. 

We then had an oyster sampling which was delish. Can't complain much about this.

For my main course I had the stuffed foie gras free range quail with truffle mashed potatoes. It was good. Would I get it again? Sure.

I don't know though. There's something about paying $30 for something the size of index finger that is just so unappealing still. Yes I would rather pay for quality rather than quantity.

1264512,2007-09-23,4,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"A hard review to write as quality of food is relative to some extent but I believe that restaurants that charge this sort of price and aspire to the highest standards must be judged against those aspirations and expectations. Hence, although I did enjoy my meal very much, I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars. Mind you, I am judging it against the highest standards as I also dined at Bouley in New York, The Kitchen in Sacramento and Michael Mina and the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco on my recent vacation.

L'Atelier is next door to the Mansion, Joel Robuchon's 'main' restaurant where the prices cause even more watering of the eyes. The concept of the restaurant chain (there are Ateliers all around the world) is to dine at the bar to 'promote a more interactive experience'. There are tables available but you are definitely encouraged to dine at the bar. One advantage of this is to watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. The odd thing is that I found the waiters not to be very keen to chat, hence nullifying the interactive experience. I was later able to engage the maitre d' in some conversation but mainly about soccer as I live in England. A lot of the time, the staff were gathered, chatting to themselves.

The decor was dark with lots of wood. Once seated, I was offered either still or sparkling water, no ice water as an option. $8 per bottle as I later discovered. I was driving and didn't drink. My request for freshly squeezed orange juice was met with a polite 'we don't do that'. This was the only top class restaurant I dined at this trip which didn't manage to rustle me up some juice. You have oranges, you have a juicer, you have arms, how hard can it be?

I opted for the $135 tasting menu. Was a bit disappointed to see that the foie gras on the internet menu had been replaced by egg though that did actually turn out to be one of the better dishes.

I suppose the main disappointment overall for me was the lack of innovation or have I been spoilt by dining at the Fat Duck in Bray (in the UK)? The other top class restaurants I dined at on this trip all produced moments during my meals that made me gasp in surprise. L'Atelier produced very well cooked food which was tasty but no 'wow' moments.

The best dishes were la caille (quail), some perfectly cooked tender pieces of meat in a lovely sweet-ish sauce (sorry I can't give you more details about it but the server didn't volunteer more clues as to its ingredients when I mentioned that I really liked the sauce) served with the famous truffle potatoes and the aforementioned eggs en cocotte. Though I had enough to eat, the portions were literally a taste in some cases - maximum of 3 mouthfuls! No amuse bouches to welcome you. Some of the dishes like the langoustine carpaccio could have done with another flavour like citrus to offset the sesame.

So, although I enjoyed the meal, l'Atelier didn't compare well for me with other places I dined in the same price bracket. Also they need to inject more interaction and life into the place if their concept is based around interaction.",OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA,6,3,4,4ILnURJbMRuI69E5PP5hhA

Even if only by name. Standing next to the opulent and all white Joel Robuchon, L'Atelier beckons you to the dark side.

Inside, the black and red decor continues, right down to an open black kitchen. Black tiles, black surfaces. Austere. Stark. A few tables for groups of four or more but most of the dining occurs at the bar around the open kitchen. Half the spectacle is watching your dishes work themselves through the different stations.

Of course you can order off the a la carte menu or go with their three or five course tasting menus. But you're at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. That would be like stopping at foreplay. Go on, order the nine course tasting.

LES CRUSTACES : Shellfish cream, piquillo pepper coulis and fennel foam

The amuse bouche comes out in a small porcelain eggcup atop a piece of rough hewn, heavy volcanic rock. A lobster and langoustine cream sits at the bottom, layered on top with a piquillo pepper coulis and topped with the fennel foam. The essence of the shellfish is both distinct and powerful. The texture, on the other hand, is of a smooth custard.

LA LANGOUSTINE : Langoustine carpaccio with roasted poppy seed dressing

The natural sweetness of the langoustine is tempered with a slightly tart, almost Asian, dressing. The roasted poppy seeds add a bitter crunch.

LES HUITRES : Poached baby Kusshi oysters with French ""Echiré"" butter

Imagine butter melted over slightly poached oysters. Except infinitely better because these are Kusshis and the butter is Echiré. Go on, be an ingredient snob. A perfect illustration of how quality ingredients can elevate a dish. This one was sensational.

LE HOMARD : Maine lobster in a tomato sauce and green asparagus

The lobster was very well prepared and I like the presentation of leaving the tail meat partially in the shell. It makes for a beautiful plate. But the star here is the rich and dense sauce a l'américaine, beautifully bringing out the flavor of the lobster. Really, this is lobster layered on lobster. You can't ask for more than that.

LE FOIE GRAS : Foie gras ravioli in a warm chicken broth with herbs

I think I'm giving up chicken noodle soup as a comfort food in favor of this dish. Except I don't think L'Atelier delivers when I'm sick. It's a shame. These foie gras raviolis were delicate and delicious.

LE SAINT-PIERRE : John Dory filet with baby calamari and artichoke

Growing up in Australia, I ate a lot of John Dory as a kid. So much so that it became a very ordinary fish for me. This John Dory was anything but ordinary. Firm and well seasoned, it was just a very good piece of fish. The baby calamari was perhaps the only slip up in the whole meal, being rather rubbery.

LA CAILLE : Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes

How could I not love this dish? Three of my favorite ingredients on the one plate. Press down on the slightly crispy skin of the quail and melted foie gras oozes out of it. Cut through the quail and coat liberally with foie gras ooze. Alternate with bites of the thick, creamy truffled mash flecked with black truffle. Earthy. Gamey. Offally. Superb.

LA PECHE : Peach confit infused with Moscato d'Asti, apricot milkshake

A stunning and surprising dessert. A peach sorbet sitting in an apricot ""milkshake"". A coin of sugar topping the dish. Dip into the apricot foam and you'll find bits of crunchy frosted cornflakes. All presented in a stemless martini glass balanced in a glass bowl.

L'ACAI : Acai granite light caramel cream

A final fun dessert to end the meal, this one comes topped with a ball of pink cotton candy and a small raspberry. Like a sweet and airy breast. Start by letting the cotton candy dissolve in your mouth. Then dig down into the tart and refreshing acai granita. Juxtapose with the rich caramel cream.

LE CAFE

An herbal mint tea to calm my stomach and a cute chocolate truffle partially printed with the restaurant's name. 

And the knowledge that I just experienced the meal of the year from the chef of the century.

Well, his excellent Executive Chef Steve Benjamin anyway.

I only have one complaint so I'll get it out of the way first. the tables are reserved for 4 or more people so a couple has to sit at the dining bar. it's  not an alcohol bar, more like a sushi bar. the seats are really comfortable though and the service is top notch so it's really not much of an inconvenience, but be aware of it. you get a good view of the open kitchen though so that's interesting

okay on to the food. they have a tasting menu, but we ordered from the regular menu. we ordered four small plates and one entree for 2 people and split a dessert which was perfect for the two of us. there isn't one thing I wouldn't order again, but the standouts were the truffle burgers (two slider-sized) and the duck confit (entree). there were three different foie gras options which was really nice. the mango mousse dessert was outstanding. light and not too sweet. a perfect end to the meal. they have an really nice cocktail menu too. I'd skip the wine (ridiculously overpriced) and have a second cocktail.

1303627,2012-11-28,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Not bad, but definitely needs improvement for a one Michelin star establishment. I know negative reviews are never popular. However I will make a effort to best explain why.

This review is based on the 9-course prix-fixe menu (the regular menu items which my wife ordered looked better.) The first two dishes started off well enough. The ingredients of the first one were not to my personal taste, but very well executed. This must be acknowledged. The second, the scallop was quite good. Unfortunately, a too big flake of red pepper interrupted the delicacy of the scallop. After the first two dishes (both with a little bit too much red pepper flake), all I could taste in my mouth was red pepper flake. The tip of my tongue was burning (and I'm someone who can easily handle spicy.) And I thought this was french cuisine, not authentic burn-off-your face thai.

The smoked salmon in the light curry sauce was over-salted and the combination did not mesh well at all. It was essentially a strange juxtaposition of a piece of lox dumped into an mild asian curry, i.e. what I would call bad-asian fusion. To make the dish work, I had to cut up the small piece of salmon and soak in the sauce. Perhaps a strong sauce would have been in order to offset the saltiness of the fish. Or the fish could have been less salted.

The major disappointment was the quail. Foie Grae was excellent. However it was wrapped in rather tasteless piece of quail. The sauce on it tasted like something from a typical decent vietnamese/french restaurant located in the middle of a suburb. As THE signature dish, it was unacceptable. I have a good idea of how this should taste like, i.e. explode with flavor. But on this night, it just didn't do it. 

My friend with me, who had been to L'Atelier on many past occasions, had a small bite, and he simply was in such a shock that he forgot to demand that the chefs remake this dish and do it properly on my behalf.

BTW, the executive chef was not present on this night. The chef in charge also did not make a presence in the kitchen (the place has a visible kitchen in front) until our meal was nearly over.

If I were Mr. Robuchon, I would definitely pay this place a visit to ensure that it continues to reflect well on his good reputation. It's my understanding that he hasn't visited this establishment for quite a while and has been busy opening new L'Ateliers throughout the world. I think it shows.

In closing: again, the food wasn't bad. It just wasn't one star Michelin.",-yPI7_YVMHcfAwYS0U1mpQ,3,0,2,cSAwpvZsGdZpm6i38IG5Ww
1308613,2017-05-17,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Another Michelin star adventure on my list, and a worthy one at that! 

We were a little worried that the transition of executive chefs would hinder our experience but I am happy to say that it did not. We loved the atmosphere, akin to a hip sushi bar, yet serving elegant upscale French cuisine. We found this setting allowed for a more comfortable and casual experience as well as encouraging more interaction with our server to discuss the menu at length. 

We found the wine list to be slightly overpriced with a bottle of Quintessa that may run $310 or so at other restaurants to be $385 here, and Cade which may run $90 elsewhere to be around $120 here, but then again it's Vegas and expensive drinks are the name of the game. 

The food however was fairly priced for the amazing experience. We found the flavors to be exquisite, and the plating was phenomenal. Since we were at the bar we would watch with amazement as the cooks would spend 5 minutes plating our dishes with tweezers. Only for us to devour them in half the time, using bread to sop up any leftover sauce and returning a clean plate. 

While they would incorporate so many inventive flavors in many of the dishes, they also know when to back off and let the main ingredient shine, for example the Iberico Ham was presented very simply with only some small crostini with diced tomato as an accompaniment. It's an amazing thing to eat, better then any prosciutto and was best left alone.   

We also experienced the Veal Sweetbreads, and this dish has scared me in the past as I have never enjoyed it, until now. This time it was done right and is worth giving a shot!",LvIHbpMZmRVCrGUbn2Lh1g,1,0,5,1Bf0WYDbLQFDiGYP2QB8-Q

We arrived just prior to our reservation time, and were quickly seated at the end of the counter, providing a more intimate environment, yet letting us watch the preparations in the kitchen first-hand.

We decided to create our own ""tasting menu"", since we often share dishes and enjoy the opportunity to taste more things that way.  The price came out comparable to if each of us had ordered the $95 tasting menu, but with options more suited to our tastes.

The bread was fabulous ... we just should have eaten less of it! :-)

As for ""small plates"", we shared the anchovy filets, the ""macaroni"" (really a cheese-encrusted asparagus spear), the langoustine fritters, and the seared foie gras, followed by a main course of lobster fricasee.  Every dish was different, succulent, and explored unique tastes.  Absolutely spot on, with each item!

We closed with the cheese course.  Very nice cheeses, but to me, there was a ""same-ness"" to them.  All fairly creamy, Brie-like cheeses, albeit with subtly different flavors.  I would have loved to explore varying textures and degrees of sharpness / mildness that didn't happen with the cheese selection.

We had a glass of a wonderful pinor noir with dinner that was an excellent balance amongst all the different dishes.  A big, full red would have overpowered the food, while even a moderately robust white may have had too much presence.  The subtle flavors of the pinot were just right.

The serving was well-paced, and our server was ever-present, without once being obtrusive.  He was knowledgeable, helpful with menu selection, warm, and friendly.

Holy mashed potatoes.

We went here during our brief Las Vegas stay, and we opted for Menu A (1 amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 dessert) for $80, and this was plenty of food!  If you select Menu A or B, you have to pick appetizers and entrees from a separate menu (not the typical a la carte menu) and neither the MGM website or his personal website have this listed.

This is not a huge restaurant, and if you are a party of 2-4 people, there's a high probability you will get seated at the bar.  This seats are wonderful if you like watching the kitchen in action. 

I think there are enough reviews and photos of this restaurant to see and read about the entire menu four-times over, but I thought the service was excellent, and the food was exceptional.

We shared the calamari, crab on turnip discs, crudo, and the foie gras on risotto (which was amazing) appetizers.

The pork was exceptional, very tender and well matched with the cabbage.  The duck appears to have downsized over time, and it was well-prepared, but not stand out.

(Thanks to this meal, I really want to go to the L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon in NYC once I find a lackey to go with me. Any takers?)

Upon being seated at the open kitchen bar - imagine my food blogging buddy discovering that she had left her camera in our room! Luckily, we were enjoying our stay at the MGM, so she was able to run right up and grab it while I soaked in the sounds and scenes of deliciousness. I loved where we had been seated - we were able to watch the cooking and plating going on right in front of us.

After scanning the menus, we both settled on the Discovery Menu, a veritable magnitude of mouth-watering flavors. Perhaps what made it most appealing was the copious amounts of fois gras (aka nomnom goodness). 

So without further ado, November 2009's Discovery Menu at $148:
L'Amuse-Bouche - foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam
Le Crab Royal - king crab on a turnip disc with a sweet and sour sauce
La Saint-Jacques - sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil
Le Cebette - white onion tart with smoked bacon and grilled mushrooms
Le Foie Gras - duck foie gras with confit quince and yuzu
La Sole - dover sole filet, baby leek with ginger
La Caille - foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes
Le Pamplemousse - grapefruit infused with Prosecco, lychee sorbet (accented with pink Pop Rocks!)
L'Arabica - chocolate cake cremeux layered with espresso ice cream and roasted almonds
Le Cafe - cappuccino

Then there were others that were poor combinations - stuffed salmon, le burger, fried egg with salmon roe, sea bass. The worst were their desserts, which the french are supposed to be known for.

At the sound of his voice, his subordinates simply responded with a ""oui chef"" as they looked down and they were focused on their tasks.

In one station, there was a chef meticulously assembling salads with tweezers.  As he carefully arranged ingredients - one piece at a time, he had a focused yet calm smile on his face.  It was interesting to see.

In another station, there was a chef at the grill.  She carefully turned over steaks and was very deliberate with her actions.  The head chef often interacted with her and her focus never wavered.

In a third station, there were two chefs preparing appetizers.  Using two spoons, they carefully scuplted grounded salmon sashimi into round mounds and then they cautiously added ingredients- one by one- by hand or by tweezers.

We sat at the chefs bar and ordered a few dishes a la carte. Me and my new fiancé shared le fois gras (classic chilled fois gras), lobster bisque and l'hamachi (hamachi sashimi). 

Since we were celebrating we ordered champagne- I was super impressed by their large selection of veuve cliquot- my favourite champagne (!) It was served in matching veuve cliquot champagne flutes too which was a nice touch. 

I particularly enjoyed the amuse bouche- a fois gras parfait. It was so delicious! 

Since I'm from Europe I also really liked the warm, freshly baked French bread that was served prior to the meal.

This restaurant is great as although it is formal, they encourage sitting at the chefs bar which creates a relaxed and less 'stiff' environment.

So at about 10 PM no one was able to get us a table except l'Atelier, we decided to try it out despite the somehow off-putting price list. 

Decor was amazing : you could see the ' atelier ' which means 'workshop' right behind the bar, where we were seated. This brought an intimate and pleasing atmosphere.

There's lots of giant tweezer usage, which makes me think the chefs really take care in the precision and excellence of the food.

We really foie gras'ed our meal up. Foie gras amuse bouche was fantastic. The foie gras slider was incredible! My friend, who never eats anything green, inhaled her entire slider, veggies and all. She attributes it to the foie gras dripping off the sides, but the flavor of the foie gras was not too intense to cover up the flavors of the burger. For entrees, we had the foie gras stuff quail, which was more of a foie gras stuff quail sausage. Not the most appetizing looking dish, but very tasty. The truffled mashed potatoes were fabulous that accompanied the dish. We also got the wagyu steak, which was well seasoned and naturally buttery. Why would I order a steak at a French restaurant, you ask? We were in a meat type of mood. Unfortunately I have to say I've had much better steak at the dedicated steakhouses, both in Vegas and back home in Texas. We got the raspberry surprise as a dessert, which I thought was a little too sweet. Parts of the dish were executed wonderfully, but all together, it was a little overwhelming on the sugar.

1516826,2017-07-27,32,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"It is Joël Robuchon. Of course it gets 5 stars. 

L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon is a casual and delightful environment where you can freely speak with the Chefs and service staff behind the long counter housing the open kitchen while you watch the chefs preparing your food, timed to perfection largely employing the Sous Vide method. Based on a few reviews I read prior to visiting, I believe the average Yelper believes that the ""casual"" piece should mean that it is inexpensive - which it is not - so expect to pay accordingly for a Michelin starred restaurant. 

The interior is an interesting mash up of French Bistro and Nightclub which makes you feel comfortable in a freshly ironed polo shirt while others in your party will feel just as at home in a small black dress and a pair of Louboutins. The service is impeccable, as expected, and features a unique chance to ask any question you may have while the kitchen is at work quid pro quo. This is something you could never do at the flagship restaurant Joël Robuchon located directly next door. Take advantage of this opportunity and you will learn more in one meal than you would be watching a decade worth of Food Network. In a word, L'Atelier is ""fun"" for any inquisitive culinary adventurer.

Chef Robuchon's kitchen set the bar high from the onset with their signature L'amuse - Bouche which is an irreproachable Foie Gras Parfait with Port Wine and Parmesan Foam that somehow tastes even better than it sounds. The rich and velvety Foie Gras is tamed by a light and cool Parmesan Foam that sports hints of Port in the close. There is nothing to not adore about this single bite of cuisine. 

From there a Bread Basket will make itself to you - don't sleep on the Baguette and French Butter - it is as good as any from Bouchon, perhaps better still. 

For my main entree, I decided to put the ""mastermind"" to the test with his Spanish Octopus featuring fresh Beluga Caviar and a marinated Spring Mix as a base. The hand cut pieces of Octopus are exceptionally large but cooked flawlessly thanks to the Sous Vide method and chew more like a Steak than what you would expect from Octopus - a welcome and delicious surprise. The generous portion of Caviar imparts a salty/briny component that seems to match the savory Seafood perfectly without making the flavor profile too busy or confused. The only other detectable seasonings were a bit of Sea Salt and cracked Black Pepper and that was all that was required to make this dish exceptional. Best mated with a cold, hoppy IPA from the nearby long bar. 

Best Octopus dish on the planet? So far for this Yelper. 

I figure some will cringe at the $70.00+ tab (tip included) but I would argue that the ingredients used and the skill of the kitchen actually makes this a very reasonable value. I am excited to have L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon as my 30th Michelin Star and cannot wait to get next door as soon as possible to see what Joël Robuchon itself has in store for me.

cue song: ""weeee are never ever getting back together!""

after having once made reservations here and then cancelling due to high prices
we decided to try it at least once... 
hubby made reservations on thursday ... 

called on saturday to confirm. 

""uh, we don't have your name, sir."" O______________o bad sign. 
hubby - ""just get us in for 7:30pm "" ** apparently they were not busy ANYWAY ** 


we got there ... got seated in the bar area (there is table seating too) which wraps around the kitchen so you can see the cooking done. p.s. the chair is annoying, the back comes up to your waist only so you' can't really sit back and the seat is way too deep to lean back. you're sitting like this for 1+hr. 

we opted for the 5 + 3 course menu * i was going to do the discovery menu but .. heck if you can ""build your own pre fixe"" menu .. way not? besides, i am not a foie gras fan and foie gras was all over that discovery menu. 


red flags: 
1) the man next to us kept sending back his dishes (too raw, too salty)
2) a woman who ordered 15 courses, opted out at course 3
3) waiter did not introduce himself
4) losing our reservation
5) into the meal ... we learn ... THE HEAD CHEF and MANAGER are out ...sous chef was running the place
6) the kitchen crew were bickering amongst themselves
7) lack of energy in the kitchen.. .everyone was practically silent 
8) our plates came at very oddly timed intervals, so took super long to come
9) the quality of fish is NOT fresh. one of my fish plates came and it had this chewy texture to it. we watched them make another person's appetizer (hamachi). hubby immediately knew the fish was not fresh .. deducing my fish was probably not fresh as well. wtf??

the only memorable items were the amuse bouche (foie gras, ironically with parmesan foam), the rotisserie chicken, and the pistachio ice cream souffle. we tried the scalloped potatoes on the house .. and WOW, it's like ingesting BUTTER. the waiter even joked they put lots of butter and a small potato. ick. we could not finish. 

hubby liked the beef cheeks though, and our waiter told us that it had been marinated in a bottle of red wine and then reduced. i appreciated the flavor and texture but the sauce was just TOO intense. 


overall, i was NOT impressed. especially since it's rated.... people come here either 1) know their food or 2) just want to say they went to a fancy restaurant. it feels like all show and no substance. maybe if the exec chef + manager were there it would've been better. 

but... at least the ambiance was cool and hip and people thought we were newlyweds on our honeymoon, so we still had a good time despite the ho-hum experience. :P

Let me tell you, if you think you're making concessions in going to L'atelier, you are mistaken! The experience was magnificent and the food was in true style, a jewel in it's own right but enough of the adulation, let's get down to details. 

Setting/Mood: Located in the MGM, it took awhile to get seated (about 20 minutes after our reservation time) but smart hotel/casino owners just happen to have designed it so that their slot machines and gaming tables are conveniently nearby for you to pass the time (and also $40). Dim lighting, rounded bar surrounding the kitchen for a ""watch me cook what you're going to eat and then straight to table"" delivery. 

Food: I won't give the blow by blow but as always, unless you're a particular eater, tasting menus provide the best sampling of what the Chef would like to showcase and in theory, does best. All the 9 courses + amuse bouche were just the right blend of gastronomy, simple dishes deconstructed and/or reinvented, typical fine dining courses executed perfectly, creative combinations AND all presented exquisitely and  festively for the eyes without being too busy. If you're curious, culinary hitters at bat were 3 courses with foie gras, oysters, lobster, tart, monkfish, quail, venison, champagne-strawberry dessert and chocolate-menthe dessert. This rundown hardly does the food justice but gives you an idea of expectations I suppose. 

Tips: Bar stool seating encompasses half the restaurant so if you don't want a front and center seat to witness the kitchen, request a table away from the kitchen bar seating area. Also, it's a bit of a tight space so you may rub elbows with fellow dining patrons should you choose to sit in the bar seating area. 

FTW: I have a huge time celebrity reverence for Chef Claude Le Tohic who I got to speak to when I dined at Joel Robuchon and also got to see again at L'Atelier as he was checking in for the vacationing executive chef of L'Atelier (he probably thought I was a weirdo because I kept staring at him and wanted to say something but couldn't find the courage - the last time I spoke to him, I rambled on endlessly and unintelligibly so I kept quiet this time). Chef touched a piece of meat, found it not to standard and commanded one of the sous chef to do it over - FOOD POWER...very awesome...

1552895,2016-08-22,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"One word-- WOW!  I can't even remember the last time I had food this impeccable.  My fiancé  and I came here for a pre-theatre dinner and were blown away.  The majority of the seating here is at a counter where you can watch the chefs prepare the food.  My seat was directly in front of the chef who plates the food, and I literally couldn't tear my eyes away from him.  He took such time and care in plating the food that I knew we were in for a treat before I even tasted anything.  

We ordered off the pre-theatre menu ($58), which consisted of an amuse bouche, an appetizer, and the roast of the day.  We also ordered drinks.  I had a pear cocktail, which was amazing, and my fiancé had the strawberry cocktail, which he enjoyed as well (but we both liked mine better, since it's a little more unusual).  Before we came to the restaurant, I was telling my fiancé that the LAST thing I would want for the amuse bouche is foie gras, which I detest.  Lo and behold, foie gras it was, and I'm happy and surprised to say that I absolutely loved it!  The amuse bouche of foie gras with port wine and parmesean foam may have been my favorite bite of the whole meal.  Thanks L'Atelier for making me a foie gras lover.. for now.  

For the appetizer, I chose the gazpacho and my fiance decided on the carbonara.  Both were spectacular.  The gazpacho had burrata cheese in the middle-- an unexpected, creamy surprise with spectacular results.  The carbonara was amazingly unctuous and flavorful.  The main course was the ""roast of the day"", which, in our case, was chicken.  Roast chicken doesn't sound too exciting, but at L'Atelier, roast chicken has as much class and taste as caviar and lobster nearly anywhere else.  The chicken was topped with an onion compote and was accompanied by asparagus, a small frisee and herb salad with truffle vinaigrette, and the most decadent mashed potatoes you will ever taste.  The chicken was perfectly moist and the mashed potatoes literally had the consistency of butter.   They say that any good chef can prepare expensive ingredients well; the mark of an amazing chef is one who can turn something ordinary, like roast chicken, into something extraordinary.  L'Atelier definitely accomplished the latter.  Also, as many have said, the bread here is out of this world, and they are happy to replenish it as often as you'd like. 

The pre-theatre menu does not come with dessert, so we ordered one a la carte to share.  We opted for the chartreuse souffle with homemade pistachio ice cream.  Perfectly flavored with just the right amount of sweetness.  The souffle had a dreamy silky, pillowy texture that melted in your mouth.  Spectacular!

As expected, the service here is impeccable.  I could not have asked for a better experience.  The pre-theatre menu here is an amazing deal-- very reasonable and worth its price in spades.  Joel Robuchon definitely deserves every single one of his 33 Michelin stars-- the most of any chef in the world (one of which belongs to L'Atelier).  While he is the owner of one of the most expensive restaurants in the world (Joel Robuchon restaurant right next door), he deserves even more accolades in my book for making incredible food affordable through L'Atelier.

The poached Kusshi oysters were also wonderful...except one of my oysters was just a touch on the wrong side of prime freshness, thus one star off.  Otherwise, very good meal.

There's no question that the food was good, but I definitely wasn't falling off my bar stool without a purse hook under the bar.  Our server was very friendly and helpful, as I was completely undecided in what I wanted to get.  He told us that he would give us the 6 most favorite small plates on the menu.  I even clarified that I didn't want the most popular (I wanted to be a little more adventurous), but the 6 best.  He guaranteed me that he was on it.

The amuse bouche of foie gras with parmesan foam was delicious and I settled in for a great meal.  The first two dishes that came out were the mediterranean vegetables and the langoustine.  Both solid, but, in my opinion, unoriginal.  The second two were the foie gras sliders and the oysters.  Again, solid, but boring.  The final two were the quail and the veal cheek.  You know how it goes...

I was disappointed that the sweetbreads was not included, so I ordered it.  It was probably the best of the dishes, but not spectacular.  In fact, the highlight of my meal was the salty, delicious cheese that my neighbor didn't like and gave to me.  I know that sounds a little creepy, but that cheese was worth every bite!  I wish I knew what it was.

I'm not sure what made Joel Robuchon the chef of the century, but I pretty much did a tour of the restaurants in MGM this week and this one was by far the most disappointing.  The food was worse at Wolfgang Puck, but I paid 4x the price at this one.

Let the games begin!

It started off very well and the L'amuse-Bouche was truly a delight!  The waiter was friendly but when we asked him how he liked working at this restaurant - was it the love of food?  Passion for cooking?  He said neither.  Okay then.....not that everyone has to LOVE food to work in this industry but I guess I just expected a little more enthusiasm.  
It continued on a positive note until the scallop - yikes.  Overcooked.  Now, I understand when a restaurant makes a scallop a bit too firm but when there is a solo scallop on your plate decorated and served proudly - it better be one awesome scallop. Not so much.

The rest of the plates were good but I must say not the best I have had.  

There was one other VERY odd event going on and it was the kitchen.   Maybe it was a teaching night?  I wanted to sit at the counter so I could view the glorious magic that would be happening in the kitchen.  Was something wrong?  First, everyone looked SUPER depressed and quite a bit bored.  There were about 12 people in the kitchen and most looking over each other's shoulders to observe the placement of a pea.  I get that this is an art.  The focus of perfection in both food preparation and presentation but c'mon...what is going on? Light a little fire under these people!  It was so weird and sucked the energy right out of me.  

By the time we were ready to leave I felt a bit deflated.  After reading all of the wonderful reviews I had a really hard time understanding why this was so disappointing.",wZaKOFRxo_DYXzpKgixbdQ,0,0,2,77TjXZAxYC6UF4wTYGD6kg

We thought about Bouchon, but eventually ruled it out since the original is only an hour away. As such, we decided on L'Atelier, with the counter service being the biggest draw for me. 

Upon entering I was drawn in by the black interior accented with deep red and large vases of fruits and vegetables separating the service well and the kitchen. We were seated directly in the center of the counter so we had a direct eye line to the grill with the entire kitchen before us. The service started out a bit rigid, but we soon realized I think this was the way things were meant to be. As our server warmed, the food's delicious taste and immaculate presentation took over. Two of us shared four plates of veal ravioli, lobster in a chorizo broth, fois grois stuffed quail and beef cheeks. Each dish presented itself as bites of culinary perfection with each ingredient playing on the others' profiles. The beef cheeks were by far one of the best dishes I've ever had. We followed everything with a great cheese plate and the waiter had a beautiful collection of five small cakes sent over for my birthday.

As we sat finishing our wine for another 45 minutes we simply watched the kitchen work their magic. This is the reason I love open kitchens. It's as though the mystery of where your food originates melts away and you're able to observe the extensive time and care put into the dishes that make their way through the restaurant and onto your table. This was an awesome dining experience and a culinary lover's dream. Sit back, savor your dishes, and watch the magic happen.",vQ4IV9xP_t-lfj0eGE46hA,0,0,5,4ukIVWt61UighsTTieos8w

The chef started us off with amuse bouche. It was a shot glass of smooth, decadent foie gras topped with Parmesan foam. AMAZING. One of the best foie gras I've ever had. It was silky and melted in your mouth and then the Parmesan foam added a nice little punch of flavor. 

We ordered:

The lobster salad: Very good. Lobster on a bed of lettuce. Very nice. Prob my favorite dish of the evening. 

Rib-eye: Very flavorful. Comes with a side of decadent, creamy, heart-clogging buttery mashed potatoes. 

Artichoke with crab: not my favorite, but it was still good.

We got this other asparagus dish-it was wrapped in cheese. Forgot what else was in it. It was ok. Obviously not memorable. Haha

Most French restaurants around the world which offer menus degustation have an inordinate number of courses on their set degustation menus; the sheer number and size of courses on such menus make it difficult for patrons to finish, and, therefore, enjoy, these delicacies. For example, the neighboring Joel Robuchon offers an old-style French menu degustation which consists of a whopping 16 courses priced at over $400 per person. L'Atelier is a heaven for a discriminating foodie who wants to taste the same delicacies but in tapas-sized portions, with no requirement to order a set number of courses, and save a bit of dough for the tables. Moreover, the atmosphere at L'Atelier is nothing short of hip: patrons can choose whether to sit at the counter and marvel at the chefs preparing the meals right in front of their eyes or position themselves at a table for a more traditional experience. Robuchon's mashed potatoes are to die for (try with truffles!), any appetizer or entrée with foie gras is a must (try the free-range quail stuffed with foie gras), and steak tartar melts in your mouth. After having worked on the French side of Switzerland for three years and having enjoyed Michelin-star French and Swiss cuisine, I was lucky to find this gem of a restaurant upon moving back to the States, and I do not miss a meal there ever since, every time I am in Vegas. Points for service: service is always spectacular, but one time the manager even asked the chef to make a special dessert, just for me, when the restaurant was out of the dessert from the menu that I preferred.",2B-fkmGdClJvKy3_R2pQ7w,0,0,5,6OBPJy73GyaVMMT3axGesw

Technically speaking, there was nothing wrong with my meal.  I decided on the five course pre-fix menu so I could have the full experience.  No course was bad, but there was no course that had me slap the table or punch my dining companion with a ""holy crap this is amazing"" revelation that one would expect from a restaurant with such a world famous chef.  

Most seats are situated at a bar facing an open kitchen, allowing you to watch the chefs assemble plates with intense care. Periodically, like a character out of ""Ratatouille,"" a stern looking chef in an impeccably clean chef's coat with French colors on the collar emerges from a back room to scrutinize their work.

Coincidentally, on both visits, I had a gosh darn cold, but thank goodness the tastes buds were pleased enough to ignore my under performing nose and enjoy the dining experience thoroughly.

This time, we went with a la carte rather than the popular tasting menu.  Good strategery for the tummy.
+Freebie - Foie Gras, Port Red Wine, Cheese Reduction.  Very rich and tasty.
1.  Les Huitres - Kushi Oysters in clarified butter.  These lil' oysters could have been more fresh, but the texture and the way they were prepared was just right.
2.  La Saint Jacques - I obviously have not had well prepared scallop before because I usually avoid eating it.  Lo and behold - Perfectly prepared scallop!  So tender!  
3.  Homard Deg - Lobster in spicy broth.  Very comforting and lobster not over cooked at all.
4.  Le Bar Deg - The worst dish of the evening.  The fish was not flavorful and was tough.  Is this real sea bass texture and have we been mislead by expecting juicy, fatty fish?  However, the side of mashed potatoes was the creamiest that we've ever had.  It was like eating butter and potato flavored pudding.
5.  Le Burger - Fantastic morsel of juicy, fattiness!  One order comes with two lil' guys, but you may want to order one more order.  We refrained.  The accompaniment of -perfectly fried fries were fresh and salted with sea salt.  The mini burger was comprised a perfectly toasted bun, fresh greens, a one square inch piece of foie gras and juicy-extreme piece of mini burger patty.  
6.  Chocolat Sensent -The best chocolate dessert.  Why?  It's the texture, baby.  Texture.  Sweet, creamy vanilla icecream rolled in finely crushed oreo bits.  Thin disk of milk chocolate with delicate fruity blobs of sauce.  Underneath the disk was a creamy smooth dark chocolate mousse with orbs of tiny dark chocolate crisps imbedded.  All this together was eye-rolling good.
7.  Le Framboise - Usually, I'm not a fan of fruity desserts, so I could pass on it.  The presentation was very unique.  The round orb of white chocolate was melted by the warm raspberry sauce.  The center consisted of some sort of sorbet.

Conclusion:  C'était délicieux!  Ha ha.  Who am I kidding?  I don't speak French!  This place is bomb diggity and I'm going back.

I went to the L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Tokyo two years ago and I had a very good experience so I decided to give the Vegas location a try.  The restaurants are fairly similar.  They both feature very similar decors (sharp reds against dark blacks to give the restaurant a very modern and trendy feel).  Both restaurants also feature bar seating around the open kitchen (a great view of the talented chefs at work).

There are other similarities.  Both locations feature a lot of modern dishes--whether available as small plates or in a seasonal tasting menu.

There are differences as well.  The Tokyo location is much bigger.  The Tokyo location also takes pastry very seriously.  The bread at the Vegas location is decent, but it does not compare that well to the Tokyo location.  The Tokyo location even has a high-end patisserie on site, which features upscale French pastries as well as individual cakes/desserts.

The food was very good at both locations though I probably liked the food at the Vegas location more.  The Tokyo location seemed more representative of the country's cuisine though.  The restaurant featured a lot of Japanese ingredients--whether Japanese fish, Japanese raised beef or mushrooms.  The menu at the Vegas location felt like a menu you might see anywhere.

I went with the tasting menu at the Vegas location and almost everything was very good.  I also added their crispy langoustine as an additional item.  Here is a rundown on their tasting menu.

(Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan) This was okay though I wish the foie gras taste was stronger.

(Confit of mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a radish cannelloni) The flavors were simple and light, but I liked the varying textures and flavors as well as the presentation.

(Poached oysters with chive migonenette) These were good.  The oysters were warm and soft while the dressing was flavorful.

(Langoustines with green curry and coconut milk) These were exceptional.  The langoustines were sweet and very moist (also very soft).  The garnishes were not that strong, which allowed the flavor of the langoustines to really shine.

(White onion tart topped with smoked applewood bacon, quail egg, parmesan, and asparagus) This was kind of a take on breakfast.  I really liked the crispy (hash brown-like) onion tart as well as the rich yolk of the quail egg.  I thought the bacon could have been crispier.

(Crispy langoustine fritter, basil pesto, salad) I ordered this as an additional course.  The crispy shell of the fritter was good--light, crispy and not greasy.  The basil leaf tucked inside the shell also gave the fritter a nice fragrance.  The langoustine was also good (moist), but it did not have the sweetness or softness of the other langoustine dish.

(John Dory, baby leeks, tomato, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger, pomme puree) This was small but good.  The John Dory was moist and light (though the fish still had a good flavor).  I liked the mix of the butter sauce with the creamy, buttery pomme puree and the fresh tomato and leek salsa.

(Foie gras stuffed quail, pomme puree, herb salad with truffle vinaigrette) Though the foie gras stuffing was just okay, the quail was very good.  It was nicely caramelized and had a great sweet and crispy sear as well as juicy meat.  The sauce was rich and good.  I really liked the herb salad--great freshness and fragrant herbs, much better than micro greens (the also strong in flavor truffle vinaigrette was a great pairing).

(Caramel panna cotta, lemon cookie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries) I really liked the panna cotta--smooth and creamy with a very good caramel flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was great--smooth and dense with a great old-fashioned vanilla bean flavor.

(Berry mousse, tender chocolate cake, blackberries, banana tuile) This was a standard fruit with chocolate dessert.  The mousse was creamy and the chocolate cake (pieces) was not dry but just okay.  I really liked the light tuile, which had a noticeable banana flavor.

Prices were high though the tasting menu seemed to be a much better value than going a la carte.

Service was decent.  Not super attentive and plates lingered a little bit though the food came out relatively fast.  The staff was pleasant.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon features very contemporary and artfully designed food, but there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The restaurant focuses on classical flavor combinations (whether from France or other countries/regions), which should please many.  There are a lot of overpriced fine dining spots in Vegas.  L'Atelier is expensive as well, but at least the food is delicious and very memorable.

1742754,2011-07-05,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"As a somewhat lazy person, I typically don't write Yelp reviews.  But, after eating at L'Atelier, I felt a bit deceived by its stellar Yelp ratings that I felt the need to clear the record.

Also, a low Yelp rating typically involves bad service, but my 2-star rating isn't about the service.  L'Atelier is a trendy restaurant with great decor and courteous servers.  Granted, the wait time between each course was quite long - it took us 3 hours to finish dinner, and the dishes consisted of such tiny portions that 80% of the time was spent waiting (at one point I had to walk up to one of the hostesses out in front to ask when the entrees were coming because there were no servers in sight for half an hour after we finished the appetizers).  They admitted that the kitchen was a bit backed up that evening, so I'll give them a pass on the wait time.  I am leaving 2 stars solely based on the disappointing quality of the food.

As matter of background, our group of 5 consisted of working professionals in our late 20's.  We enjoy fine dining and we hit up Vegas 3-4 times a year, so this isn't a situation where a guy who eats regularly at Outback chooses to complain about a Michelin rated restaurant.  I've been to a bunch of restaurants with Michelin stars in LA, NY, Vegas, and Hong Kong, and every single experience had been phenomenal until L'Atelier. 

I'll just focus on the food.  I have already mentioned that the portions were tiny, but that didn't really factor into the bad rating either because we had a huge lunch that day, so I wasn't extremely unhappy about the small portions.

We chose 3 appetizers to share - la durade (cold snapper salad), seared foie gras, and suckling pig with crispy skin.  I wasn't a fan of the snapper salad.  I love Japanese food and had my share of top grade nigiri and sashimi, and the raw snapper was just ok compared to other raw seafood dishes I've had.  To be fair though, some people in my party liked the dish.  The seared foie gras was just ok too (this is starting to become a theme).  I enjoy foie gras in its paste form.  The foie gras at L'Atelier was seared so it had a slippery livery consistency, but the searing process made it lose most of its rich gamey taste.  Why cook an expensive piece of foie gras so it tastes like a $3 chicken liver?  No idea.  The third dish was just ok again.  The pig was tasty, but did not blow anyone away.  My friend commented that it tasted like any Asian stir fry dish at Panda Express, and his description was slightly harsh, but nailed it on the head.

We ordered 4 main courses, and one of us ordered an appetizer as an entree - hanger steak, 2 steak tartar, stuffed quail with foie gras (my dish), and a smoked salmon appetizer.  Let's start with the smoked salmon.  It was by far the worst dish that night.  It tasted like something from the supermarket.  The hashbrowns on the side were wet, limp, greasy and salty.  My gf told my friend not to finish it, but he ate it anyway because once again, dinner took 3 hours and we had to do something to kill time.  I didn't try the hanger steak because I felt bad taking the 4 ounces of meat from my other guy friend.  The steak tartar wasn't bad, but kind of salty (another unpleasant reoccurring theme).  Given the overall disappointing food all night, the tartar was the best dish, and the only dish I would recommend.  The fries on the side was nothing special.  Seriously, they were just fries.  If I did a blind taste between the L'Attlier fries and McDonald fries, I am not sure I could tell the difference.

My quail dish was supposed to their signature dish.  Four little pieces of quail.  I think only two were stuffed with foie gras because the other two were wing pieces.  But it was really hard to find out which ones were stuffed because they all tasted the same.  The problem was the seared foie gras again - it was cooked in a way that it lost most of its flavor.  I had to cut one open to make sure the chef didn't forget to add it.  The quail was average.  It wasn't salty, thank god.  But I've had better quail at other restaurants.

On a side note, we ordered a Riesling, and at the end of the night there was a fruit fly in one of my friend's glasses.  I was going to complain to the server, but once again, there was no one in sight for 40 minutes after dinner, so I just decided not to bother with it.  It's not the restaurant's fault that a fruit fly decided to crash the party, but fine dining establishments are supposed to be insect free.

In conclusion, every dish at L'Attlier was average and on the salty side.  My meal was free b/c one of the party picked up the tab - but, just think, it must be bad if I am leaving a scathing review for free food.  Granted, if we had gone to a random French bistro and ate the same food, we would have given it 3.5 stars.  But this is a one star Michelin place with a 4.5 Yelp rating.  It is terribly disappointing in that respect.",c7mnyTtuADE4CXgagdSa7Q,3,2,2,f5emCCJeppGMnM1RGmIkdQ
1746574,2010-02-22,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"The 1 star Michelin L'Atelier ""workshop"" de Joël Robuchon is the less pricier 'tapas' version of the original next door (3 star Michelin).  It was, nonetheless an exceptional experience.  

They offered a Winter Tasting Menu for $75/pp, (a fraction of what you'd drop next door); so we jumped on it.  For the amuse bouche, they served a foie gras parfait with a port wine and Parmesan foam.   The Parmesan was pungent and extremely flavorful.  It was  followed by a rich and creamy pumpkin squash soup....every spoonful a savory delight.  Next, a crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto (absolutely my favorite course...crispy, fresh and light!)

The Scottish Salmon (my main entree) was amazing.  A rather slender cut of salmon, perfectly cooked on all sides, garnished w/ aromatics and the thinnest strips of crispy potatoes.   My partner ordered the beef rib eye, which was cooked to a perfect pinkish medium, served w/ a side of mashed potatoes.

For desserts, we ordered the Les Tarts (traditional tarts) and Glaces et Sorbet (ice creams and sorbets), which were both great!

Every dish was a feast for the eye.  The focus seemed to be on perfecting every dish, starting from ingredients, preparation to the perfect placement of every leaf for the final garnish.    

The highlight of our meal was getting to spend 5 minutes w/ Joel Robuchon himself as he greeted each group of diners.  We was a delightful man, extremely personable and down to earth, despite being named ""chef of the century"" by Gault Millau in 1989.

Therefore, I resolved into going to L'Atelier Joel Robuchon. Definitely will try Joel Robuchon next time I come back to vegas. I made a reservation on Thursday at 5:45pm through OpenTable and it was a 1000-point reservation which is a plus. 1000-point reservations are only available at that time though. 

Their portions are very small so it is good to get the tasting menu or the pre fix meals. If i had more time, I would go with the tasting menu. However, this time I got their pre fix meal A. 

Pre Fix Meal A comes with: 1) amuse bouche, 2) 2 appetizers, 3)1 entree, 4) dessert. around $75-80

Pre Fix Meal B comes with: 1) amuse bouche, 2) 2 appetizers, 3) 2 entrees, 4) dessert. about $105

Pre Theatre Pre Fix comes with: 1)amuse bouche, 2) 1 appetizer, 3) meat of the day. $45

The amuse bouche is a small appetizer. When we went, it was a foie gras dish in a small little cup. It had milk and some various ingredients. I couldn't really tell what it was but it was delicious. For the appetizer, entree, and dessert, you get to choose from a list of items. The appetizers have cold or hot options. I got the snapper carpaccio under the cold items and some foie gras soup from the hot items. The carpaccio was amazing and the foie gras soup was pretty unique. Never had foie gras like that but the flavor was very tasty. For my entree, I ordered the cod. It is a great dish but it is very small. Thank goodness they give everyone a side of mashed potatoes for these pre fix meals or else I wouldn't have been full. In my opinion, each dish was served with too much time in between. There was a lot of waiting. I know these meals are supposed to be like this but this restaurant took a little longer than usual. Lastly, I got the caiperhinia dessert. There is a lot of alcohol taste to this. Our table also had the gelato dessert that was included in another person's pre fix menu. The gelato comes with 3 flavors if I remember correctly. The green was was really good in my opinion. It had a hint of basil flavor. We also ordered a souffle that wasn't part of the pre fix menus. The souffle also had ALOT of alcohol taste to it. It was unique though. My friend got the $45 Pre Theatre and that day, the meat of the day was a new york steak. The meat was SO delicious, it melted in your mouth. In addition to these pre fix items, we ordered the foie gras stuffed quail because I saw on their website that it was one of their most popular items. There is an appetizer portion and an entree portion. We got the entree portion to share and it was about $45. Super small portions... definitely not an entree portion.. but it was good though. 

The amount of food was just perfect. I wasn't too full or leaving hungry. I would definitely try the 16 course meal and try to get reservations at the regular joel robuchon next time though. The service here was a bit slow. I had to ask a couple times to have my water refilled and I had my plates taken when I wasn't finished eating yet.",Yhm_6eQIpvDOhVwFmNX_xg,7,4,4,uixQdZmzridj-OUDY_RNQA

Watching a kitchen work in perfect harmony is an absolute treat while you enjoy your meal. The people working in the kitchen are less chefs and more artists. The service was quick, but not so quick you felt rushed, and all of the members of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The meal started with an amazing amuse Bouche, and that set the tone for how delicious the rest of the meal would be. The chef's special, the quail, words do not do it justice, and the sliders, do yourself a favor, just get them, you will LOVE them. For dessert I suggest the mango sorbet, it's like eating a mango flavored cloud, it is absolutely delicious.

I would also like to give a special shout out to our Matride, Paul, and our waiter Blair. They were without doubt two of the nicest, and most attentive restaurants employees we have ever met. They went above and beyond to make this arguably one of our best dining experiences of our life.

The three of us got the Seasonal Tasting menu (10 courses). The Amuse-bouche -- foie gras parfait, was really good. Then from the 2nd course on, it just went downhill for me. The 2nd course was this cold dish -- celery mousse with a beef gelee. I felt like I was eating the congealed fat of a beef stew my mom would make. I was so grossed out that I had to return it and have the chef make me something different, which was better, but not amazing. Next was the sea scallops, which was so bland and tasteless, that I had to ask for salt. (And if you know me, I rarely alter food by adding more salt or sauce) It was only the beginning of my meal, and I was already disappointed. Every course after that was just mediocre. Nothing really stood out... Except maybe the dessert (which I liked), but still don't really remember it. Meh...

The only reason I'm giving L'Atelier 3 stars is because of the restaurant layout and the head chef. I liked the open kitchen so you can watch the chefs cook right in front of you (we sat at the bar area). The head chef really took a liking to my friend that was dining with us. He gave us quite a nice portion of seared foie gras (not part of our tasting menu), and that was, of course, really delicious.

Absolutely in the case of our dinner yesterday night to celebrate dad's belated birthday!  The Discovery Tasting Menu had many new dishes that were even better then the one we had 6 months ago.  Its actually funner and more relaxing to dine at a table as opposed to the bar.  Our dinner lasted a good 3 hours or so, so excellent pacing and time to savor and contemplate each awesome dish.  We did have some glitches in service near the end with our waiter disappearing for a while.  Plus there was no post-dessert shortbread cookies!  Still, the mind-blowing food and presentation warrants a solid 5 stars.  I applaud how they change the entire menu frequently so each dinner you have here is completely different, yet you will still get a 5-star experience.

My favorite dishes (though all were nearly perfect)
1. Halibut with truffle and celeriac scales.  Halibut is easy to overcook but they nailed it here.  Flaky crust, soft texture, and seasoned well.  The ""scales"" added nice color, texture, and umami!

2. Sea scallop with seaweed butter was the favorite of the rest of my party, and its indeed up there for me too.  

3. I took a few bites of the Wagyu beef and it was also perfect - melt-in-your mouth tender.

4. Whipped potato side dishes, a signature dish of Joel Robuchon.  So incredibly smooth and decadent it was like eating butter.

5. Desserts reign supreme as usual.  The meringue was balanced with an outside that was sweet and soft, with the inside tart and hard.  Putting them together and you get a harmonious marriage of a dessert and palate cleanser.  Hot chocolate over ginger ice cream will make a chocolate fan out of anyone.  Here, the dessert was balanced between sweet and bitter from the chocolate. But what stood out was how the ginger flavors gave a nice spicy kick.  That sponge cake near the bottom of the glass absorbed the ice cream well and gave some nice, granular texture to the dessert.

Conclusion:  L'Atelier is definitely in our top 5 restaurants anywhere, not just Vegas.  Love how in a matter of months they mix up the Tasting Menu.  Dinner is a bargain at $200 to $250/pp and I still believe better than many 3-Michelin places I've been to.",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,5,5,5,eBERaeg25ngAWa3j5asVnQ
1790269,2016-12-22,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This is a 3.5 star review:


I had extremely high hopes going into dinner at L'Atelier and left feeling that the experience was not what I had expected. The reservation process was simple and done online, and the restaurant itself was not hard to find within the MGM Grand. My girlfriend and I explored the menu and we decided to give the seasonal discovery menu ($195pp) a try. We were excited. 


Food: the food was mostly delicious and well presented. There were one or two items that my girlfriends and I did not overly enjoy but the dishes were all still tasty. The one dish that we both rather disliked was the carbonara, as we found it to be extremely peppery, to the point that there was no other taste. I pointed this out to our waiter and he explained that they use a strong pepper and apologized and offered to bring me something else (I did not take him on that offer). My favourite was the duck gras and chicken duo. Very well done and the flavours were spot on. The two desserts were also phenomenal, and synched very well with each other. 


Service: overall, service was good. The waiters were attentive and did a good job explaining each dish to us and answering questions we had. When my girlfriend was eating the mashed potatoes, the waiter quickly brought a spoon over for her, upon observing that she was struggling to get everything out with a fork. However, two things stood out to me: one of the waiters was placing the langoustines dish in front of me, and the langoustine fell from the bed of rice. His reaction was ""whoops"", and a quick apology. While not a huge issue, I would have hoped that for a restaurant of L'Atelier's quality and reputation that this would not occur. Secondly, when we received our spoons for dessert, my girlfriend's spoon was sticky on the side. Again, not a big deal as the problem was rectified but should not be happening in a Michelin Star dining room. 


Overall: the last issue that made the night not as enjoyable was that the restaurant is near the casino and rather open. The smell of cigarettes could be detected, lingering for periods throughout our meal, which marred the experience. Not sure how the restaurant can fix that, but as someone who dislikes the smell of smoke, certainly an issue. I expected better than what I got. Not that the experience was bad, it just did not live up to expectations, or quite frankly the price tag. Realize that you are paying for the location. 


Tip: if you make reservations here, get a seat at the bar. You get to watch the kitchen in action and it was a thrill to watch.",oE70tEM-5ORo85KMs0kwWQ,0,0,4,ageNXVclRpHVuBYad39Rkw

Also, my friend's course had to be sent back. 
Each course here was either a hit or miss. They were beautifully and artfully created. The most consistently good part about the menu was their dessert. After the many fine dining experiences I had, the food did not meet the cost I paid. 
Three of us had the larger menu while one of us had the smaller menu. The smaller menu was much more consistent and very good. I wish I could've gotten that one.

maybe i ordered the wrong thing, i'm not really sure. my pockets weren't deep enough to try everything i wanted to on the menu. the dishes all cost a pretty penny or two. it's fancy and service is great but almost too formal. i don't think our waiter laughed or smiled once, kinda like a robot.

originally, i planned to order the prix fixe menu for $39 but the choices didn't seem appetizing. instead, i ordered the La Caille (Fois gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes) and a Martini. The drink was ""meh"" and the quail was shockingly tiny. i was expecting more than its legs. they were smaller than fried chicken waaaangs. i knew french portions were much smaller than american. i even asked the waiter how big it was and he made it sound like it was a decent dinner portion. ah well, i got duped. 

i thought the quail was a little dry and the fois gras was tasteless. i was expecting exquisite food. i mean it's joel robuchon! the chef of the century according to top chef and wiki. i wanted to taste magic! *sighs*

i sampled some of my friend's plates and i really enjoyed their dishes more than mine especially the La Cebette (White onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus) and Le Porc Fermier (Braised pork belly with confit sweet onion) from the 7 course menu.

Service was very quick but not rushed.  Usually, restaurants with prix fixe menus have long gaps between courses but they were very efficient and attentive in not having us wait between courses.

Note:  Formal dress code not enforced.  I wore a tank top and jeans and they didn't care.

Would definitely go back since the menu changes seasonally!",IbSvbepyJWnBog0yAyW29Q,5,4,4,6091PtTbNCX-6P74b1LG9w

The cucumber gelee confused my group, i'd say 3/4ths refused to finish it.  Me and a couple of guys however, gave it a chance, and it grows on you, or atleast gives you a taste you've never experienced before.

I've heard good things about the bread, but was alittle disappointed.  The prosciutto was dry and very good. The quality was very good, but lets be realistic, its just sliced prosciutto, with nothing done, nothing fancy.

Now to the real meat and potatoes, the 9 dollars an ounce steak.  Was it worth it?  Hells yes, cause 1.  I didn't pay for it.  2.  It was worth every bite even if I did.

The steak was cooked to perfection, and very minimally seasoned (or so i think).  That just shows how well it was cooked.  I devoured it.  DEVOURED IT.  Ate the fat, meat, everything.  Every seasoning and oil put on the steak only enhanced its flavor, not masking one bit of the steak like alot of other places do.  The ribeye was the centerpiece and focus of the flavor.  None of the seasonings overpowered it.

The pomme puree was silky smooth.  So much so, it confused alot of us (alot of us aren't fine diners).  Had the consistancy of yogurt, and a ton of butter in it.  Very tasty.

My mouth waters just thinking about it.

Only regrets?   That I got a 12oz steak instead of 20.

We dined at the counter bar which provides a great view of the kitchen and the chefs working together to create what we called food art as each course was meticulously prepared and provided an incredible presentation. We where seated promptly at the time of our reservation and service was excellent and our waiter was excellent at explaining each course we received. We ordered the seasonal discovery prixfixe which included several courses including awesome Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes a half bottle of French Champagne rounded out each course.

1846161,2015-02-12,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"After having been to the main restaurant next door, and having found it to be superb, I was really looking forward to an evening here at the Atelier.  What a disappointment!  There is no comparison between the two, and anybody who gives the Atelier 4 or 5 stars just doesn't know any better. 

Now, I can't eat fish, and maybe that has something to do with my mediocre experience here.  For the menu is very much fish-heavy, with only a few dishes to appeal to meat eaters or vegetarians.  Maybe some of the fish dishes are really appealing to the trendoids, I don't know.  But what they served in terms of beef was lousy at best --- tough, cheap cuts of trendy raw meat that had only seen a second or two in a frying pan.  The Iberico ham was nothing more than dried-out, fatty shavings from a pork leg that is literally sitting out in the air for an entire evening, to be cut into here and there when a serving is needed.

But note others' complaints about the abominably slow and indifferent pace to the serving.  I can guarantee you that this lousy service is still very much what you will experience and is alive and well even now, in spring of 2015.  You will sit, and sit, and sit, in between courses while your waiter walks right in front of you seemingly dozens of times, totally unbothered by the empty space in front of you.  And you will enjoy sitting for what seems to be eternity before they'll take away your plates when you're finished with them.  There is no excuse for being in a supposed fine dining restaurant where you have to try to grab the waiter's attention just to have your finished plates taken away.

Most of the waiters spoke English with a thick enough accent that it was hard to understand them.  Especially above the din of this noisy place, when they would rapidly try to explain a new dish he was bringing.  They seemed like they really didn't have much time to tell you what they just brought you.  So you just give up and smile pleasantly as you start to dig into it, hoping you can identify whatever this is.  Anyone who claims they painstakingly give you some ""adventure"" into food must have been there on some really, really slow night.

Other reviewers also complain about being forced to inhale the cigarette smoke from the casino that this place opens up directly onto.  Yep, that too is still alive and well, and you will be forced to be surrounded by the faint residue of those really high class people in the casino who've chosen to kill themselves slowly with cancer sticks.  I had the foul taste of cigarette smoke in my nose and mouth for hours on end, for the rest of the night after having left the place.

Most of the food I found to be utterly mediocre.  Much of it seemed to have some 'gimmick', like an unusual flavor that initially jumped out at you and seemed appealing and interesting.   But then it became boring when it appeared that that's all there is to it.  

Even starting with the 'amuse-bouche' of foie gras with port wine and cheese -- my bouche was not amused.  It actually had a disgusting stench that my boyfriend said is probably what being overly intimate with a female camel must smell like.

If you can afford an evening at the main Robuchon restaurant next door, I heartily recommend it as an unforgettably pleasant experience in one of America's finest restaurants.  But this Atelier is absurd, it is not even among the better places to dine right here in Las Vegas..",w_JD3wT3PxSJ72ijVTJSRg,0,0,2,tTfAt8aH0OjR7OZCOfaKAw
1852915,2009-04-02,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Vegas can be a lonely place when your colleagues have abandoned you in favor of a phone call home and a cart full of room service's finest.  So what's a girl to do when she's been awake for 36 hours straight and can hardly muster up the energy to have a conversation with someone she knows, much less engage in small talk with strangers at bars just for the company?

She takes herself on a hot date to Phantom of the Opera followed by L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, that's what she does.  Because she's a classy broad.

L'Atelier is ideal for a solo diner thanks to the counter-style seating.  Not that I'm uncomfortable dining by myself in a more typical setup - I did once run away to Paris solo and I certainly ate there - but it's nice to have the natural distraction of a very busy kitchen to watch to ease the urge to pull out a notebook or some reading material just to avoid looking like a daydreaming fool.  Apart from the counter, which runs the length of the restaurant and curves around to cover about half the width, there are an assortment of small tables, most of which were full.  The decor was dark and chic, all red and black, minimalist with a subtle Asian flair. It felt less like eating in a restaurant and more like eating in a lounge, actually, which I'm assuming is the point.  It isn't the most stylish place I've ever seen, but it was sleek, and everyone looks great in that kind of low lighting so I really can't complain other than to say that I really, really wished my chair had had a back high enough to lean on.  It had been a long day and my posture was suffering for it.

I went for the Menu Découverte - at $148 it initially seemed like a splurge, but I considered the cost per course and the quality and came to the conclusion that while certainly not a bargain, you could do worse.  I wasn't disappointed.

The amuse bouche of foie gras parfait was rich and ethereal at the same time - contained in a vessel the size of a shot glass, one was definitely enough.  For the first course, they had on offer a special of a foie gras gelee with fresh truffles which I believe was from the menu next door in addition to the smoked salmon on the regular menu; it was a very generous portion including 5 thick shavings of truffle and spread on toast the delicate fatty quality of the gelee was a nice complement to the pungent truffle and crunchy bread.

I'm normally an oyster purist - a squeeze of lemon will do me, thank you very much - but the baby Kussi oysters poached in Echire butter converted me for the night if not for a lifetime.  My favorite dish of the night, however, was the foie gras ravioli in chicken broth; the tender fresh pasta bursts in the mouth, releasing the richness when you least expect it.  I could have eaten several bowlsful.

Onto the mains: I'm ashamed to say I can't recall the specifics of my lobster dish, but it featured asparagus and a creamy sauce which may or may not have contained saffron.  I thought the sauce was delicious but again, I am a lobster purist and would have been happier had the lobster been served with some more of that Echire butter, a bit of fleur de sel, and maybe a squeeze of lemon.  The cod filet in piperade was very nice but not exactly a revelation.  What was, though, was the deservedly famous quail stuffed with foie gras.  It's not very easy to get every last bit of flesh off a quail bone delicately, but I did my darnedest.  The pomme puree served alongside was like a wet dream version of mashed potatoes (okay, maybe not the best analogy) - just laden with butter yet light as air.  Best of all, the lovely staff placed two more thick shavings of truffle atop the puree, thereby earning my eternal devotion.  And I wasn't even being charming!  I was barely being conscious!

For dessert, first came ""L'Ananas"" (which, by the way, is an extremely false cognate as not only is in not banana but pineapple, it is also not plural).  If memory serves - I should have taken notes but I was too busy being fascinated by the kitchen - it was composed of a sorbet alongside a very airy cheesecake with a coulis.  Regardless, it was a really nice combination of flavors (sweet vanilla, tart pineapple) and textures (crystalline sorbet, creamy cheesecake).  The second dessert was the arabica parfait, which was smooth and just decadent enough - I particularly like the textural contrast of the crisp base and the brightness of the lemon.  Between the two, I wasn't disappointed that there was no chocolate involved (apart, of course, from the mignardise with the espresso, which was a nice European touch).

The service was faultless, as you'd hope.  It was an over the top, truly memorable meal in all respects.  Later that night, back in room, I discovered that I had a small piece of edible gold leaf stuck to one tooth, which sort of summed up the whole experience.  And left me with the conclusion that if one has to get something stuck in one's teeth, gold leaf is an excellent choice.",geeRP-gkEQmiYRp5vMJ-zQ,3,1,5,1ejntYwJO-2w38foUy4tgA

My hat is off to them as it wasn't part of the menu. In the end I had 6-7 dishes, all as delicious as the previous one was.. and also as beautiful. 

A modern twist on French Cuisine with incredible flavors and presentations. I went in not really knowing what to expect and came out on a cloud, wondering how I'd ever enjoy ""normal food"" after dining there. Indeed, some of the food here might make you want to pitch a tent outside the restaurant and make you want to live there forever.

Some of the highlights of my vegetarian tasting menu:

- The corn puree with white truffles: mind-blowingly good. I've never had such extacy and pleasure from a few bites of food. Who ever knew corn could be so god damn good?

- The aubergine with buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes with pesto. They took food that classically go very well together and made it 10x better and more flavorful than anything else you've ever eaten. So good I wanted to lick the plate after. Strong flavors and beautiful presentation.

- The chocolate/hazelnut dessert was to die for... again classical pairing of elements but taken to a whole new level in terms of taste and intensity.

I write these reviews on the excellent restaurants I visited as I sit at McCarran (my flight's delayed), and I believe this stellar week started with L'Atelier for my birthday.

First the decor.  It's a small space with possibly 4 tables and an open space kitchen lined with counter seats.  The back bar is honestly a waste of space, but the tiny yet elegant surroundings give lend to a great friendly feel (I spent some time chatting with my dining neighbors on wine & Vegas restaurants).  Sit for the counter service, and see your food being made.

Ooh la la.  Elegance in small portions that blow the taste buds away.  I've never have mashed potatoes (pommes puree) like this, nor have I had canard foie gras any better.  We went the small plates route, and along with those two mentioned, had the kusshi oysters, tuna belly with onion rings, and the beef and foie gras burgers with carmelized onions.  Each small plate seemed to flow perfectly with the other, and dessert continued in that fashion as the Le Framboise certainly provided that the surprise wasn't the only thing you'd remember about it.

1871400,2017-02-21,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Top ten meal of all time, would definitely recommend but with one caveat: it's also one of the most expensive meals I've ever had.

We ordered the tasting menu with the ""standard"" wine pairing. Did not regret the wine pairing at all, poured by either the sommelier or the waiter, both were very knowledgeable about the wine and gave a breakdown of why it went with the food as well as grape varietal, country, vineyard, etc etc.

The best part of the menu is how much truffle is incorporated into every dish, which probably explains the cost. Almost every dish had truffle slices or shavings on top, I was in heaven.

Started with an awesome amuse-bouche, it looked sweet but was oh so savory. A Parmesan foam that was awesomely cheesy/nutty covered a foie gras mousse that was the definition of umami. Accented with a port wine reduction that cut through the richness very well and I swear there was a hint of truffle goodness that I can only describe as orgasmic.

Second was a salad dish consisting of pieces of Jerusalem artichoke (a sort of root vegetable, like celery root almost but sweeter), foie gras and truffle shavings. Very crisp and refreshing but also savory thanks to the liver.

Third was a sea scallop cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, not a bit tough, with a citrus butter sauce.

Fourth was a langoustine (like a prawn) on a saffron rice galette, basically a fried rice cake but it was very nice, much more savory then the previous dish, and the saffron was a great complement to the langoustine.

Next was one of my favorite courses, a pearl pasta carbonara; bacon morsels and creamy egg yolk made this a pleasure for texture and flavor eaters both.

The first of the larger meat dishes was a halibut filet that was layered with truffle and celery root ""scales."" It was visually appealing as well as delicious, the celery root echoed the Jerusalem artichoke from earlier in the meal and continued a very pleasant theme of slightly sweet, slightly savory well balanced and well thought out flavor that truly felt like a story being told rather than just a bunch of different dishes served in succession.

For the main dish I broke with my usual and opted for the chicken over the beef, but only bc I wanted to continue down the foie gras and truffle rabbit hole I had started on. It was served as a medallion with half roasted chicken and half foie gras, the fattiness of the liver contrasted well with the leaner meat of the chicken breast, but honestly the chicken was cooked so perfectly it's not like it really needed anything to go with it.

Desert had two courses, a nice light refreshing course of a sort of cream covered sorbet followed by a sort of modern Sunday which was covered in hot chocolate at tableside.

All in all it was a perfect night, we sat at the bar and watched our food being prepared, the wait staff was super quick, attentive and everything you'd expect from a Michelin star rated restaurant. I suspect if the Michelin man still came to town they'd probably get another star added. If you have a special occasion and some (okay, a lot) of extra coin, I'd recommend this place for certain.",Fhius40l4G-Dc0Zdou9HSg,7,3,5,aGGMtQGxsmjZg0ds6LMRFQ

Certainly try the Cap of Beef Ribeye, and give the sommelier a try (the best I've encountered in Vegas).  Stay away from the Iberico ham (this was almost insulting), and tartar, which was poorly prepared and displayed.

Most of the meal was not memorable flavors were not balanced.  There was not one item where I wanted to finish, sad after spending $400.  I would definitely skip L'Atelier in the future.

1900380,2017-03-02,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This meal was supposed to be the highlight of our trip but it fell flat in many ways. I read many positive reviews before coming here but after our experience we do believe it is hyped up. This is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant. Another review incorrectly stated that this was a 3 Michelin Star Restaurant so I want to clarify this. The more expensive Joel Robuchon in Las Vegas has 3 Michelin Stars. 

For this price point I expected a fine dining experience with the atmosphere and service to match but both were not there. The server was a bit too fast at clearing our plates and made us feel a bit rushed as we lingered over the last bite of food on our plate. The surroundings were modern but nothing to admire. It is not an intimate or romantic setting. All couples are seated at the bar elbow to elbow with the person next to you which makes even getting out of your chair difficult for the average person. But let's say you did not come here for the surroundings but for the food. 

We both got the Seasonal Discovery Menu for $195 per person. We sat at the counter so we were able to watch them prepare the food but honestly it looks like nothing more than plating. Most of the food prep looks like it was already done in the back. There is one Asian guy with gelled hair (and no hat) working the grill which was the only thing that looked like cooking. We saw another guy spooning pasta from a saucepan for one of the entrees. Our desserts were prepared in the back. 

I'm not going to go through each course in detail. You can look at my picture of the menu for that but I will mention biggest issues we had with various courses. 

1. Cocktails. Tried 2 different cocktails and both were worse than average. The ""High Tea"" tasted like watered down oolong tea with no cognac. The ""Strawberry""  had rum that was astringent and did not pair well with the fruit. 
2. Jerusalem artichoke with foie gras. The texture and flavor of the artichoke did not pair well with the minimally prepared foie gras. The menu uses foie gras in 3 courses. I'm tired of seeing foie gras on every tasting menu when there is no creativity in its preparation. 
3. Langoustine on saffron rice galette. The seafood was good but the rice galette was oily and missing the aroma and flavor of saffron. 
4. Carbonara with pearl pasta. This dish would have been better with regular pasta noodles instead of overcooked pearl pasta that was not satisfying to eat. 
5. Duck foie gras and chicken entree. The foie gras and chicken was combined into a circular mold and paired with their version of mashed potatoes that basically tasted like you were eating a stick of butter. I understand that French food is rich but we could not even finish the side. 
6. Wagyu beef entree ($55 supplement) This is purely a gripe about the price. I paid $55 extra for this and all I got two pieces of beef. The serving size for this is pretty outrageous. 
7. Weird pacing of the meal. There were long lulls between the courses. We waited 20 minutes in between the last 2 dessert courses. The waiter did not check in on us or even seem to realize so much time had passed. We had to ask him where our dessert was. 

We found problems with more than half the of the tasting menu and could not justify the experience for the price. If you want to try a French inspired tasting menu in Vegas go look at my review for Picasso at Bellagio.",aU1N3Lr4ojXrKBIG1Kpp8g,4,0,3,hsEukQawtc2N18Km11_RVg

So our friend and I ordered the L'Atelier Spaghetti Carbonara and a glass of wine and my girlfriend had the Crab salad & water... pretty boring eh?

Starting off our evening w/ a complimentary ""palate cleansing"" taste of foi gras w/ a  parmesan foam to start the evening.

Excellent choice because he had ""3/4 of a bottle"" that wasn't on the menu... it was perfect & delicious.

My GF and I had met & ate there 1 year ago & they again, brought out a complimentary crazy-great dessert: Five 2-bite slices of different small cakes, with ""Happy Anniversary"" written w/ a raspberry puree.

Experiences where an entire business has such passion is truly a rare find (restaurant or other).... and so immensely enjoyable when we are fortunate enough to experience them.  L'Atelier continues to be my favorite restaurant anywhere, whether for a quick bite at the bar or a 9 course experience.  Thank you to all at L'Atelier!!!",1tN94YtzYIPfpBaNRtoiqg,2,0,5,hA_xreXxvKmRDLlGcf45dw
1917267,2010-06-05,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Our party of 4 booked a reservation here over a month in advance and when we arrived, L'Atelier made a mistake and booked us for the day after. They were fully booked for the night and did not want to accommodate us even though we could see that there were open tables in the restaurant. When we asked about one of the open tables, they lied and said it was for a big party of 6 and later gave it to a party of 3 which apparently knew someone at the restaurant. When we asked the hostess about it, she made up a bs excuse about moving the larger party to the back of the restaurant especially since there weren't any new diners that entered the restaurant. If we did not have a show to get to in the mgm, we definitely would not have dined here since they apparently were not willing to accommodate us. When we asked to speak to the manager, they said she was busy in the back. Shortly after, we were seated by the bartender in the back of the restaurant, the manager never came by and avoided us for the rest of the night. Our server/bartender suggested that we would only have enough time to order 2-3 dishes before our show (1 hour 15 min) so we did just that. 

I had:

L'amuse bouche - Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam.
kuushi oysters  
foie gras ravioli
foie gras stuffed quail

All the dishes were decent but nothing extraordinary that warranted the prices. We were hoping the food and service would make up for the bad experience we had earlier on in the evening but it also disappointed. When my wife was halfway through her foie gras, the waiter brought the toast out and said ""more toast?"", she never got toast in the first place. We were served our last dish 10 min before our show time. One of the diners in our group was only able to finish 1/4 of her dish before we had to leave.

All through the night, there was no apology, nothing to make up for mixing up our reservation. We were treated more like a nuisance than guests. I do not know how L'Atelier got any michelin star for treating their customers the way they did but it can only last so long on Joel Robuchon's name. 

Coming from the bay area, I have had my share of eating at a number of fine dining establishments (fleur de lys, gary danko's, french laundry...etc) and L'Atelier has been by far the worst experience I have had at any restaurant. They have lost customers for life and they are officially on my blacklist and I don't think they care judging from the treatment we got. I'm glad I didn't have time to plop down a few hundred dollars on the tasting menu to find out. 

Save your money and head over to the restaurants in the Venetian (Delmonico's, Aquaknox, or B & B). They all know how to treat their customers and they have better food!",9BEUTBKnZbDu20Q6DwNilQ,6,2,1,H7gMQgPdmv8dBhZD3BvUkA

I had pretty much everything worth having on the menu including the tasting menu and the addition of a few items and left it to the sommelier to pair the dinner perfectly but without going into detail on every dish, the pairings weren't stellar and the food (as I had thought in Hong Kong) was forgettable.  I'm a seafood snob and none of the seafood was good.  Mussels could be more supple, Salmon was dry, Veal cheeks fine (not incredible...just $35 for 2 little bites)... 


How do I know the food is not incredible? With a gajillion people in Vegas, the place is 40% empty on a Friday during prime hours. Hint hint?

It's awesome to see the chefs at work while waiting for your food and eating your food. Servers are charming and happy. Some of the food wasn't the best I've ever tasted, but it was still very delicious!

I'm so lazy with all the names so I'll just copy and paste everything I tried from the restaurant website. haha.

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE
l'avocat rafraichi d'une fine gelée de pamplemousse à la coriandre
Avocado and cilantro flavored grapefruit gelee 
-- This one just tasted funky. I didn't think the flavors went well with each other.

Le Foie Gras
Eel and Foie Gras Terrine with Sweet Hibiscus Flower
-- I don't know about others but I think this one was too intense for me. It's so riiiiiich you MUST eat it with the Hibiscus flower. It was the first time I've ever tried foie gras and I don't know if I can handle the second time lol.... kind of scared... It was good though, but I'm still scared.

La Langoustine
dans une papillote croustillante au basilic
Crispy Langoustine Fritter with Basil Pesto
-- I LOVE THIS ONE!!! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM LANGGGGOOOUSTIIIIIIIINEEE MY BABY!!! It was wrapped with an eggroll wrap or something and then deep fried? I don't know, but I love it! I LOVE SEAFOOD!! AND DEEPFRIED FOOD! nommie noms.

Le Saint Pierre
à là plancha, accommodé d'une fricassée de soupions
John Dory Filet à la Plancha with Baby Octopus
-- I loved the John Dory, I thought it was really good. It was so hearty and meaty and the flavors all went so well together. The octopus was super tender as if it was not cooked thoroughly, but still yums. I wish there were more veggies on this dish, very good! One thing I didn't like about this dish was the tomato. It was all tangy, sweet, sour, just weird tasting to me.

Le Veau
en paillard et sa roquette acidulée
Veal Piccata Served with Arugula Salad
--Oh yummm! So tender and delicious! The salad also made this dish very refreshing!! This was BFs dish so I wasn't able to try a lot of it.. I was also really full from my fish dish :)

Les Fromages
de France sélectionnés par nos soins
Selection of Imported Cheese
-- Awwww maaan, this one I barely touched :(. I was soooo stuffed from the previous courses and I only had a nibble of the sheep. It was.. pungent.. but surprisingly.. it was not bad at all! LOL I'm not a cheese person though, and I'm lactose intolerant so... this poor dish went to waste. I wish I could've given it to my manager who LOVES cheese!

Les Tartes
de tradition
Traditional Tarts
-- Tarts were brought home and left untouched as well. AHHH!! WASTE!!! :(!!!!!! There was Snickers, Dark Chocolate... hmm.. I forgot what else. lol.

Glaces et Sorbet
Ice Cream and Sorbet
-- Strawberry, Lychee, Raspberry, Blueberry and Yuzu. All very soothing and cleansing to eat!! Very good dessert after a HUGE dinner. This one is easier to take down than the tarts because it just melts in your mouth. GREAT fruit flavors!!

AND HOLY CRAP!!! THE POTATOES THEY GIVE YOU WITH YOUR ENTREEE!!!!!! HOLY MOLY! I swear that thing is 85% Butter, 10% Potato and 5% Edible Glue. THIS SIDE IS KILLLLLLERRRRRR and they give you a mini pot of it too, but MAAANNN IT'S A LOT AT THE SAME TIME. KILLER POTATOES MAN! KILLER!!

1953747,2008-05-10,8,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Going to L'Atelier was something I had wanted to do for quite awhile. I had never experienced a Joel Robuchon restaurant and was eager to see why he is one of the best chefs in the world. My recent trip to Vegas allowed me to finally see why.

Tagging along for this was a friend of mine who enjoys fine dining as well. We were seated at the famous bar-like seating which surrounds the open kitchen. You can get a view of how the dishes are made and see the choreography of the kitchen at work.

We both tried the $135 Discovery Menu with a couple exceptions. My friend is allergic to shellfish so the ""Le Homard"" dish (maine lobster in a gele of vegetables topped with a chilled leek soup) was out of the question. I told her one of his signature dishes was the ""Les Huitres"" (poached baby oysters in Echire butter). She said oysters were OK for her to eat and chose those. 

I had inquired to see if I could substitute the ""Le Mangue"" dessert (hazelnut cremeux, fresh mango and coffee-caramel streusel) for the ""Le Chocolat"" (chocolate sensation, cremeux Araguani, Oreo cookie crumbs). Our server said that he could do it but since it's a big dessert dish it would have to substitute both desserts from the Discovery Menu. I had no problem with that.

Everything was exceptional to say the least but the noteworthy dishes were the:

""L'Oeuf"" (fried egg with sweet onion cream and smoked salmon) - If I could have this for breakfast everyday I would. Crispy panko breading on the outside, and as you cut into it, a warm and vibrant golden yolk oozes out. The small bits of smoked salmon provides a nice saltiness that counters the richness of the egg.

""Les Huitres"" - 3 small oysters packed with tremendous flavor. Extremely fresh and plump. These jewels sat in their shell surrounded by a pool of butter. I only got to have one and was considering getting an order for myself.

""Le Caille"" (quail stuffed with foie gras and served with truffled-mashed potatoes) - I wanted to choose this as my main course, but since my friend chose it, I decided to choose the rack of lamb so we could compare dishes. I probably should have chosen this regardless. Delicious foie gras and tender quail. Excellent combination.

""Le Chocolat"" - This is for the chocoholics. Chocolate crispies, chocolate mousse, a chocolate disc, chocolate cookie crumbs. Definite chocolate overload. But so sinfully good.

I think L'Atelier is a great environment to dine and interact. We were having good conversations with our server as well as the people next to us. We persuaded the guy next to me to order the Discovery Menu as well and he was impressed with the meal as we were. Service was superb and very accommodating. 

So in your next Vegas trip, set aside about a couple hundred to enjoy a wonderful meal at L'Atelier. You'll definitely feel like you've won even though you lost a paycheck at the tables.",V0Kg9fkgfoCNvYpNJcv0Ng,11,11,5,JBH9ugNz2denu6AWM0ZmGw

Of course there were 1 or 2 dishes that I didn't enjoy as much but overall, it was great. Bf got the seasonal menu (10 courses) and I got the menu club (5 courses). Of course we let each other have a taste. 

There was this layered strawberry dessert course that I can't stop thinking about, layers of strawberries, lime sugar, granita, cream. Honestly one of the best desserts I've ever had. It wasn't on my tasting menu. 

The servers were there to make sure we had the best experience possible asking us how the food was, refilling water discretely and explaining each dish. The open kitchen was cool and I liked the huge display behind a window in the middle of the restaurant.

The menu is written in French and then translated into English (love that). I was initially overwhelmed by the menu (create according to your appetite or prix fixe), but our waiter was very nice and explained everything thoroughly to us. I decided to go with the menu A option- amuse bouche, 3 à la carte (small tasting portion) options, and then one dessert. 

Let's start with the amuse bouche- I have no idea what it was (I was still soaking everything in), but it was incredible. I do know that there was a bit of fois gras at the bottom. Seriously cannot describe how tasty this was. Next, the bread basket. Omigosh the bread basket of all bread baskets. It came with 3 different types of bread- traditional baguette, an escargot (croissant like) roll, and another soft bread. Wonderful! The hand churned lightly salted butter was heavenly. 

I chose the oysters, asparagus tart, and fois gras burgers for my à la carte options and all were phenomenal. The oysters and tart in particular were MIND-BLOWING. 

For dessert, I got the mixed tarts but was lucky enough to try a bite of everything. The mango mousse was surprisingly my favorite. Washed everything down with a French 75 (which they'll make with cognac for you if you ask!).

Service was lovely but they probably could have helped us time out the courses better as we were rushing to get to Ka next door. Overall, a fantastic experience and I would absolutely dine here again if presented with the opportunity!",k8BhfbCujMYb4BRyRMUdyQ,3,1,5,QUF1QUFfujXdzEiHM2ilqQ

I love sitting at the bar and interacting with the guys behind the scenes.  Each dish that comes out from the tasting menu is magnificent.  I mean it.  Every.  Dish.  With every plate that came out, my friend just gave me this incredulous look and exclaimed that was the best he'd eaten.  Until the next dish arrived.  

In addition to the seasonal tasting menu, we added the Iberico jamon to the experience.  Aggressive adding an 11th dish -- but SO worth it. Executive Chef Steve came out to see how we were doing during this dish and even remembered me from the year prior! 

The service is unparalleled. They're even good sports about taking photos of all the dishes. Including the wine pairings.  They take the time to describe each menu item and will answer any question you have.  You can tell that they take pride in their product.  As I understand it, they go through 3 months of training before they work here. As my friend put it, you can tell they legitimately love their food.  One of the guys, Sunday, told us that they're incentivized to not only enjoy the dishes themselves but to go to the gym.  

COST
tasting menu - $155
wine pairing - $105

Some people will throw that away at a craps table with the blink of an eye -- I prefer to get something in return. L'atelier is my treat to myself.

I want to recognize our server and I'm embarrassed that I can't recall his name.  He served us last Saturday evening at the bar seats and he has a man-bun.  He did something super cool - we ordered our tasting menu items at the start.  The lady seated next to us got a different dessert than I selected and it was GORGEOUS.  I kept ogling it and shortly before dessert, he brought me a menu and said ""I believe you still need to select your dessert.""  With all that was going on, I'm stunned he noticed and the way he let me re-select was super suave and classy.

Their mashed potatoes (duh) and duck are AMAZING. These were my two favorite items of the night. I've heard that in the mashed potatoes recipe, the ratio of potatoes to butter is 1:1 so of course it's heaven in your mouth. 

The duck was perfectly medium, juicy, tender, just the right amount of salty, and so flavorful. It was cooked so perfectly that when it came out I thought it was steak. I'm not a huge duck fan.

The waiter was nice, maybe a little more smiles would be nice but he wasn't rude and was attentive.
Sadly, I do not remember the names of what we ate but I do remember what was in it. 
Dan's appetizer was a Tuna Wasabi Tartar. This was simply delicious. I hate wasabi and can't stand it but when Dan gave me a bite of that tartar, I almost stole the plate from him. Dan's main course was a salmon and it was cooked perfectly and the sauce was well matched. Dan's dessert was a coconut mousse, it was good, but I only got a taste and I remember liking it. Overall, Dan's meal was delicious.
My appetizer was a citrus poached egg in foam. The taste was strong it was good. It was a different way to eat an egg and it was good. My main course was a beef stew with a single slice of garlic toast(I'm not too sure what was on the toast) on top. The beef was over cooked and it was like eating Sandpaper. The toast just made the dish worst, I couldn't even take another bite. Dan tried all my dishes and he too was very upset about the quality of my meal. Then the dessert was an aloe vera with pine...I can't remember, but I do remember the taste. the citrus was so strong that I couldn't eat this and gave this to Dan who took it apart in order to eat this.

I was at about the 20 week mark (half-way there baby!) of my pregnancy and I was a little scared to try a fancy meal again after a previous bad experience during the course of my pregnancy (see again - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/alan-wongs-restaurant-honolulu#hrid:Y0EXfgzgwpEzC8ebxZ7-gQ). 

The Hostess and Servers were all smiles and congratulatory towards us as they helped me waddle to my seat at the serving bar section.  As my baby-daddy and I looked at the menu our server asked us if we had any questions.  I said ""I'm pregnant, should I stay away from the Tasting Menus? "" He said ""I know and congratulations! And no, we will take care of you, just let me know what you want and like to eat."" and he gave us a huge smile. Wow no agitated sighs, no eye-rolling, no me feeling like I'm a huge inconvenience!

We expressed interest in the Seasonal Discovery Menu ($155 each - with additional supps. ranging from $25 to $75 added to the final Menu total) and before we could say anything further he explained that everything could be substituted out.  

He carefully and knowledgeably explained each and every dish on the list and very considerately recommended what he thought would work best for me.  I didn't have to tell him that I couldn't eat non-pasteurized cheeses, no raw fish, no rare meat etc. - holy crapolee HE ALREADY KNEW!  

Our Amuse Bouches came. I got the Avocado/Tomato Gelee and baby-daddy got a Fois Gras Parfais.  My Avocado/Tomato Gelee was so good, it made me cry.  I kid you not, I actually got emotional at how much I was able to enjoy food again, pregnant or not.  For the first time, in a long time, the often sad feeling of being pregnant and not being to eat sushi, rare steak and all my favourites just melted away and completely disappeared. I felt so good and so well taken care of.  

Every course after that was just got more and more amazing.  My baby-daddy and I were shaking in our seats and giggling madly like school-girls at how good the food was.  It just felt so EFFING FANTASTIC to eat spectacular food.  The kitchen was magic - they function and work like a perfect machine.  Quiet, calm, focused, with precision and with so much love.  

The service was above and beyond 5 star - after 15 minutes of observing us, and besides from being the most considerate person towards a pregnant lady, our server quietly noted my being left-handed and forever after placed my knife for me on my left side.  Simply amazing. 

I can't wait to RUN back and eat here again.  It's pricey, but it's so worth it. There is no pain when you hand over your wallet to them!",aTl0wfgYeE403i1b3uSggA,2,3,5,K12DdSMxyBpcf1S5326NFA

We had a spinach dish that was incredible, and the matching wine pairing was a great accent to the meal. Some truly unique and well-prepared items on the menu.

Servers had through explanations for the food to enhance the experience, and watching the kitchen work only adds to the experience.

Granted, it's expensive as hell, and some of the menu items aren't as unique as others, which would detract from the experience, so something to consider when you order.

We've been next door to Joel Robuchon on a prior trip, and I was looking forward to the food. However, for some reason, it was very good, but just didn't have the same outstanding quality as I remember next door having.

What really disappointed me was the service. We were here last Friday, and the service at L'Atelier was nowhere near the quality we experienced next door, and fell short of many fine dining places we've been to. The staff seemed disinterested from the beginning of the meal. There were several birthdays happening, and when the staff went to sing, it seemed like it took forever for service to recover. And then there was the distraction of the head chef by two attractive women. They came in, and he was more interested in putting on a show for them than he was in actually doing his job. What was promised to be a 2 hour tasting menu took longer than the (I believe) 16 course tasting menu we had next door on our prior trip. We've dined in many restaurants where our bill cost far more than our hotel room, and we planned our trip around where we wanted to eat, and never had a problem with the money we've put out (next door and The French Laundry both were much larger bills than this one, and we've eaten at quite a few celebrity chef and/or restaurants with Michelin stars), but this is the first time that we've been disappointed in our dining experience at a fine dining restaurant to the point that we wish we had never gone there in the first place, and had spent our money somewhere else, and 95% of that disappointment lies in the service, I believe. 

Three stars for food, 0 for service, and an extra star added on for the langoustine and mashed potatoes.",gwkoNNsaBPm5a3KUc5tOlw,0,0,2,ycFHr1RrgnxNciJrAM1uyg

For starters, flat out, the Foie Gras parfait w/ Parmesan Foam was ridiculously amazing. I rolled my own tasting menu and my brother did the standard spring tasting menu. With drinks the bill was just short of $500. Not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but a great experience nonetheless. The servers were cool, laid back and conversational. They introduced my brother (who is a chef) to the executive chef and gave us a tour of the kitchens. Definitely above and beyond the call of duty. The food was top notch and the presentation was astounding. Especially on the deserts. The decor of the place was great with a perfect view of the kitchen so you can see them prepare your edible art. Yes the prices are high but for the experience, ambiance food and service...I feel they are totally justified. I am really looking forward to trying Joel Robuchon's restaurant next door.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon does not disappoint! This was my first time going here and I had an absolutely amazing experience! (the best I have ever had!.) We sat at the bar top where we could watch the chefs and service staff in action. It was like a show and amazing dinner at once! I ordered ""menu A"" which came with a amuse bouche, 3 main courses and a dessert. I chose the Le Homard, which was a Spiced Maine Lobster over pasta, the Le Tournedos, a Malabar pepper-coated beef tenderloin and then this Asparagus dish, which I cant remember the name (and cant find it online as well lol). I have been to SEVERAL ""fine dining"" restaurants and L'Atelier takes the gold. From the service, to the food and then the experience/ambiance, nothing tops it.

Although it was the most expensive meal I have ever had, it was well worth it for a special occasion.  We both had the discovery menu ($145 each) and what followed were 10 wonderful small dishes with a sampling of their menu.  The menu was heavily weighted toward seafood (scallops, oysters, cod, langoustine) and I am no fan of seafood, but the flavors were incredible and I thoroughly enjoyed this meal.  My favorite dish was the amuse-bouche - Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam - simply divine.  If you are a foody, it is well worth getting seats at the bar that surrounds the immaculate kitchen, so you can see the goings on.  The bar seating makes the service a little awkward, with the waiter reaching over the bar with plates and to fill glasses.  Instead of ordering wine by the bottle, we asked the Assistant GM/Sommelier, Harley, to pair wines with the meal and served three smashing glasses from champagne to white to red.  Harley was friendly and informative without ever being condescending, like you often get in this kind of establishment.

Food was good not mind blowing great, we had 10 course with wine pairing, except the fish was overly seasoned others are good especially the hanger steak with mashed potatoes and tomato salad. 

The restaurant has limited table seating and bar seating are available, but our preference wasn't honored although I clearly mentioned i wanted regular table in my email.  We tried to go next door Joel Robuchon instead for a real sit down enviroment for mulitple course dinner but it was completely full.  Service was sufficient but way behind its some competitors (other MGM restaurants have been similar such as Shibuya). Seems like the restaurant is staffed with just 8-9 for around 40 seats. Water wasn't refilled on timely basis, abit annoying for long dinner like this. 

Full tasting menu with wine pairing for two was $600+.  It is steep considering bar seating, the level of service and ambience.  If you are ready to splurge on dinner, go Picasso instead.",a2E7Knfh7jEW8rupPafP3g,0,0,3,cgYKfM43tZoJmMd3j_iPKQ

The pre-theater meal was small and the 3 courses come out together like a tv dinner tray.  The best thing about the six course meal was the main course, a really fatty slice of beef.

Upon arriving at L'Atelier, we were surprised to be sat a the counter area as opposed to a table. The restaurant is very tiny and only has 6 tables, which are reserved for parties of 3 or more. Everyone else is sat at the counter that is in front of the open kitchen. I'm not a fan of counter seating when dining with a guest because you're sitting right next to other diners and conversations are not private. But we made it work. And it was kinda fun to watch the chefs do their work. L'Atelier is very focused on presentation so it was like watching artists paint every time they prepared a dish. :-) 

The menu options are plentiful, including small a la carte tasting portions, larger a la carte entrees, and several tasting menus. My friend decided to go the a la carte route and I chose one of the smaller tasting menus. Our meal started with an amuse bouche of foie gras in a port wine reduction with Parmesan cheese. Delicious! For me, this was followed by cauliflower gazpacho, pumpkin veloute, spiced Maine lobster, and then a trio of gelato and sorbet. Every one of these was very good, however I would have preferred a bit more seasoning in the cauliflower gazpacho. My friend had the langoustine, the beef with eggplant, and king crab. Yum! 

Service was of course very good and made the dining experience quite nice. I would recommend L'Atelier to adventurous foodies but not for a romantic experience.",Fhv7SfjLSK4rBz1KjqB1wQ,3,1,4,09_q-L3A8jgvQHkLTFODaA

I spent hours trying to decide between the two for my birthday dinner. I went with JR. I had such and amazing experience that decided to have a second birthday dinner 2 nights later at L'Aterlier. Best. Week. Ever.

For those wondering the same thing, here are some things to consider:

- The food is damn good at both restaurants. I find L'Atelier to be almost like upscale comfort food with the incredible sliders (must have!) and langoustine fritters. JR is more delicate and uses more refined techniques. The dessert at JR is unreal.

- The service is excellent at both restaurants. Both offer warm, friendly service. L'Atelier is definitely more casual, but they are informative and attentive. JR offers exquisite service unlike anything I've ever experienced. 

- The ambience is where these two restaurants differ the most. L'Atelier is energetic, upbeat, moderately loud, the restaurant design is modern with black and red furnishings. There are some tables around the perimeter of the space but the majority of the seats are at a counter that wraps around an open kitchen. This is where the magic happens! It's fascinating watching such talented people construct all these dishes and I love to see how they are able to create such works of art. It's almost like a dinner show, so if you're dining alone or if you're on a first date you'll have plenty to watch and talk about. At Joel Robuchon, it feels like you've entered a different world. It's very quiet and romantic, slower-paced, and just oozes luxury. Purple velvet couches, crystal chandelier, fireplace, garden room, and only a handful of tables. Slow, quiet piano music playing in the background. 

- The price & value. L'Atelier is probably half the price of JR, or maybe even less. But the price difference is not a reflection of the difference is quality and taste of the food. 

You're sure to have a wonderful meal at either restaurant. If you can go to both, I highly recommend it!",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,7,1,5,VbeJ_qSSWlL_7FUlgThfMw

We were seated at the bar which I wasn't expecting, but I think it was the best place to sit. You're very close to your neighbors, so it's not an intimate dining experience, but it's very cool to see the activity in the open kitchen. 

The complimentary amuse bouche was a foie gras parfait with a foam on top. Foie gras isn't my thing, but it was tasty. 

We received a bread basket with 3 different types of bread. I loved the small flaky bread. Would've loved a second piece, but didn't think I should ask :)

We ordered the jambon (ham bruschetta) as an appetizer. It was a plate of thinly sliced ham with fat around the edges. It came with 2 pieces of toasted bread with tomatoes on top. I don't love tomatoes, but I wanted to eat it as the chef intended and I really enjoyed the combination. I do think it could've used more bread. 

There was a miscommunication on my main course order. I thought I had ordered the Sole, but they brought the Seabass. The mistake could have been mine and I told him that, but they insisted on bringing me what I wanted. My boyfriend ordered the wagyu steak and they made him a fresh one as well to come out with my entree. My fish was amazing! It had a brown butter sauce and they deboned it in front of me. The waiter was very apologetic about the mixup and wouldn't let me take the blame for it. I may have loved the potato purée as much is the fish! They said it has equal parts potato and butter, so definitely not healthy, but well worth the calories!  

Finally... Dessert!  We ordered the white chocolate raspberry ball and the presentation was so cool!  I was very happy with the choice and they also brought us out some little dessert extras to apologize for the entrée mixup. So good!  

The service was as excellent as the food. The whole thing was absolutely a five-star experience and I would highly recommend it. We ordered a bottle of wine, appetizer, two entrées, and a dessert and it was about $200/person.",wLGfVCgOdNKzJ3TGTzlvLQ,3,1,5,bncduED91ocgd0pbBRtfNQ

I've walked past L'Atelier and it's fancier sibling more than a handful of times in my Vegas visiting years, intimidated both by it's name and potential damage to my bank account.  My recent visit to  Vegas prompted to ""go big"", and see if the restaurant lived up to it's renown.  Robuchon certainly did not disappoint.  

Most of the dining is done via bar seating with view of the prep kitchen and shelves of fresh produce.   The focus on aesthetics extends to the food, as each dish is meticulously composed, almost being too beautiful to eat.  I ordered the five course prix fixe menu, composing of:

*AMUSE Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan
*L'OEUFF DE POULE Chicken egg « sunny side up » style with bohemian vegetables
*L'EPINARD Hot spinach velouté on a delicate nutmeg royale
*LE SAINT PIERRE John Dory Filet a la plancha with baby octupus and calamari
*LA HAMPE French style hanger steak with shallot and crunchy sweet gem
*LA FRAISE Strawberry compote with lime, tequila sorbet

Each dish, including the amuse, was a work of art, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The only dish that didn't thrill me was the side of the chef's signature mashed potatoes. While whipped to smooth, buttery consistency, it was delivered at a lukewarm temperature. I'm not sure if this was the intended temperature of consumption, or whether I was just hitting a wall four courses though, but it was a bit underwhelming.  The hanger steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, accompanied by an deliciously savory sauce. The strawberry compote was a light and refreshing end to this very satisfying meal. 

The is one aspect of dining at L'Atelier that seems quite perplexing.  For the bar seating, the dishes are served by the waiters over the counter from the kitchen side.  Whether they are switching out your silverware or delivering your food, they are reaching over a space that spans their prep counter and your dining counter.  It seems to be an awkward reach, and you can see the staff struggling to reach with every service.  I think I noticed most of the diners at least making one comment on how far the reach was.  

As more high end dining options are appearing and general dining prices are increasing in Las Vegas, L'Atelier de Robuchon still appears to a splurge, but perhaps the most reasonable and satisfying splurge in the city.",8P6XF-0rNA7pmUXnhx0j9A,0,0,4,HupN61xnDVILcJB5haRhFA

Cliche, I know, but how can you not go to Vegas for your 21st when you're in Los Angeles? It's like a no brainer. You turn 21, you go to Vegas with all your besties, you drink and gamble and drink some more, you tear up the town looking gorgeous and dance till 5 am and walk home on the strip when the sun is rising and parents cover their childrens' eyes as you walk by. That's how it's done! Haha I'm kidding. Mostly. Anyways, let me get to the point of this review...

Boy took me to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon at the MGM Grand for  my romantic 21st birthday dinner on my 2nd night in Vegas. We had to wait a little bit for our seats but then we were guided to the counter by the hostess. I wasn't thrilled with sitting there at first because those tall chairs hurt my back but in the end I am glad we did. You get to see the inner workings of the open kitchen as the chefs and cooks hastily and delicately prepare the dishes one by one. The counter is beautiful with red accents and all around in the middle of the open kitchen were glass jars and whatnot with various fruits and vegetables in them. Very beautiful in my opinion. Our lovely waiter came right up to us at the counter (I think he might have been our cook too?? can't remember now) to discuss the menu and how things were done there since neither of us had ever been to this restaurant (or any Robuchon restaurant for that matter). We were advised to get an appetizer or two small tasting portions and an entree. I honestly wasn't feeling well from the week's birthday celebrations so I did not have the stomach to order a lot of food even though I wanted to. I order a scallop tasting portion and a salad tasting portion. I know you regulars are probably laughing at me right now!

To start, we had the famous JR amuse-bouche which was soooo delicious. I could not understand what our waiter said was in it and to my horror afterward I found out there was foie gras in it!! At that time, I did not eat foie gras out of ethical reasons... Whoops. Out of my inexperience, I only ended up ordering the two tasting dishes thinking they would be enough for me in my current gastronomical state. Nope I was wrong. Tiny tiny tiny. I was still a little hungry after eating literally two bites of food... which cost probably 40$. Blah. My boy was sweet enough to give me part of his steak tartar (EXCELLENT, btw) which helped curb my hunger. I had watched the chef prepare his steak tartar, mixing it in the bowl with the capers and vinegar and all those other yummy things they put in there. This was actually the dish that started my love affair with raw beef so that says a lot since I never EVER considered eating tartar before this...

All in all, L'Atelier in Vegas is a nice place to go for a fancy dinner but make sure your wallet is full and that you understand how much food you're getting. Ask the waiter is this enough and they will let you know. I happily look forward to the next time I am in Sin City so I can fully appreciate and get my money's worth from the experience at this restaurant.

Designed a bit like a sushi bar, the best tables place you at a counter facing into the kitchen, where a half dozen chef's efficiently and quietly prepare your meal as you watch. Across the counter from you, your dedicate server acts as a friendly and knowledgeable host. We had the tasting menu, ten or so small plates with a half dozen matching wines. Everything was superb, but the knockouts for me were: all the breads, the little pizza-like thing with a quail egg and bacon on it, and the partially smoked salmon. We loved the foie gras parfait amuse bouche. We've also been to the more formal Joel Robuchon next door, but it is stuffy and the food seems less interesting than at l'Atelier.",uEQ3nCdOBNOeJ0ow4Ds1vA,1,1,5,WlM93KkDWE5aPZ5jIxziow

I opted for the $150 tasting menu, but they had other prix fixe options starting at $40/head.   Their a la carte dishes seem to range from 20-50.  In the tasting, I enjoyed almost every dish that came out.   The only dish I thought was mediocre was their signature quail and foie dish which seemed dry and overcooked.  For the most part, the dishes kept getting better as the tasting menu progressed.   

Service was attentive but not over bearing.  It was definitely at the level you expect in this class of restaurant.   

The atmosphere is more casual than most fine dining restaurants in this price range which I view as a positive. 

Given how bad the economy is, I was able to easily make a reservation a couple of days before.  I was surprised to see the restaurant pretty full on the Sunday at 7:45 when we were done dining.

This has potentially been the WORST customer service I have ever received at a restaurant, and as a result both my husband and I are playing on our phones to avoid eye contact with our server. 

We had a 730 reservation, and upon trying to check in, the immature, unprofessional hostess told us we would still have to wait 20 minutes. Ok, no biggie -- hubby and I went to wander around the aging casino that is the MGM. We came back 25 minutes later, only to be told that we would still have to wait 20 minutes more. Seriously? We are paying $$$$$$$$$$$$$ (yes, that many dollar signs) for dinner and you can't even friggin seat us on time? We have been to multiple Michelin star places and we were quite frankly appalled. 

My husband threw a little fit about this, and after a little scene out unprofessional hostess told us we could wait next door at the ""very exclusive"" Joel Robuchon lounge. Oh goodie. A place to sit at an overpriced bar with no comped drinks because YOU ARE BAD AT HONORING RESERVATIONS!!!

We ordered drinks, and 5 seconds of receiving them the hostess came over to tell us our table was ready. Then she told us we had to close out at Joel Robuchon and that we could not bring our drinks over next door as it is a separate establishment. What is this, Cheesecake Factory? Actually, scrap that ... Even they let you bring drinks from the bar to the table. 

Then, we came over. The bitchy hostess also slammed every door on the way and showed her anger at her own ineptitude. 

Food was great. Not gonna lie. BUT THEN, my husband asked to speak to the manager .... And things went downhill.  Again. WAIT, isn't this a MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT?!?

Turns out they don't currently have a manager. The sommelier came over. He defended the front staff, did not acknowledge that they were unprofessional, and then said, ""well, what do you want me to do?""

Anyway this place sucks. Avoid at all costs and spend your money and time elsewhere. In the time it took me to write this epic novel of a review, we have still been waiting for our next course.

Now that I'm older I want a Care Bear that has their special cheese bread on his chest, so he can magically make this addictive cheese bread for me any time I want one.

The waiter must have thought I was crazy, since they're about the size of mini cream puffs, and I was more excited about the cheese bread than the caviar or the fresh crab.

My brother said I must have had 12 small rolls!

But, I'm sure you're not reading this because you want to hear about my cheese bread infatuation, you want to hear about the stellar tasting menu right?

Well look no further. Our course started with an avocado and crab started. Then the caviar tasting. Then moved onto a mixture of seafood, beef, and poultry dishes. And of course they had foie gras.

Everything was cooked and presented perfectly here. 

Remember the dress code is suit and tie, and they did check our shoes. I guess some people wear tennis shoes or flip flops in or something.

They have an option to add truffles here to their pasta dish.

Also, they have the option to do different tasting menus. For instance I had the 16 course menu, but my brother opted for a different smaller prix fix menu. So we didn't have to order the same thing.

The highlights were, of course that to die for cheese bread (I know, it sounds crazy, but I even took a picture of it, but it turned out blurry), and the dessert cart at the end.

The dessert cart was a chocolate masterpiece. The cart that day had an animal theme, so they had animals on it made of chocolate (as decoration, you can't choose the chocolate animals) then tons of truffles, small cakes, tarts, etc. You can choose whatever you desserts you want, then they'll place it on the plate for you.

I've been to several Joel Robuchon's around the world, and this by far is my favorite one of his restaurants since it's both extra classy, and they have my favorite bread and dessert's cart which the Asia locations did not have when I went there.",ZMocFA2lNMJeiKjguUKu7g,45,42,5,70Sj2A5Uy5Xawp_uAUhS5g

Located deep within the MGM grand, coming in here the colors are vibrant, the feel is very modern, with pure white furniture, pure marble black table tops, and fresh vegetables that just illuminate from behind the bar area, with some portions of red, it is a beautiful mixture. It is relaxed, without feeling the bustling casino right out the door.

We had the 'seasonal discovery menu' on the night, and I can tell you that each dish was presented like a piece of art. The server we had was very knowledgeable in each plate, giving an intro, and a little twist in each, with what was used, the preparation and coming back when each dish was finished to find out exactly how you enjoyed it. Pretty good care and service, but when you are paying this amount, I guess it comes with the territory. I found the pacing of each dish perfect where they gave a good intermission prior to bringing the next plate.

Sitting at a blackjack table across from the restaurant in the afternoon, I mentioned that it is in the Michelin Guide and I would love to try it.  He, being such a gentleman, happily agreed and made the reservation for 7pm.  We were told that we would be seated at the counter; at first, I hesitated but was told that it is the thing to do.

Arriving at the restaurant on-time, we were seated right away.  The woman was right; it was definitely the way to dine here.  You get to observe the chef in action.  The restaurant is modern and chic.

The service was prompt, friendly and excellent, not at all snooty.  However, the price tag was definitely on the high side.  All 'tapas' style appetizers start around $20 and go up to $45.  

We started with the grilled vegetables with buffalo mozzarella.  Absolutely delicious.  The vegetables were flavorful and the buffalo mozzarella was soft and subtle in flavor.

For main entree, he had the Scottish salmon stuffed with black olive cream.  The waiter told us the salmon would be cooked to about 60%.  Given that I don't eat salmon, I took his words for it when he said it was the best he's ever had.  I had the fresh cod fillet in morel broth. My oh my.  The cod was crispy on the outside, flaky and tender on the inside.  The fish was in a mild broth, surrounded by a few morel mushrooms and vegetables.  Absolute perfection.

For dessert, we shared the Le Chocolat which was very good but not as spectacular as some of the other stuff we had that night.  (Trevese with its white chocolate cloud is still my favorite.)

Without tip, the total came out to be $140+.  Since both of us had iced tea, it certainly was a ton of money.  However, the food and service was so excellent that I would recommend it if you have the money to spend.",VkSUizrGQKl5IIBIIXCFIQ,1,0,4,muZbvChGB-r9ZPRTCFcRdg

We thought that was so stuffy--but we were expecting that since the menu de gestacion is around $300. So we walked outside the restaurant (which is actually inside the casino) and saw that there was L'atelier next door to the ""high end"" Robuchon (2 same restaurants next to each other). We went to see their menu because we wondered what the difference was--it seemed like the same stuff on the menu..So we asked, and in a very diplomatic manner we were told that what you really pay for is the ""ambiance"" (i.e. ATTITUDE--which we got when we walked into the first one), because the food was the same but for much less! Well--in that case let's get a seat now! So we ate at L'atelier instead for a couple hundered dollars less! 
Everything that is said by the reviewers that give this restaurant 5 stars is absolutely true..This is really la crème de la crème as far as menus go--WOW. *Everything* we had was done so perfectly: perfect seasoning, perfectly cooked, perfectly presented--the FLAVORS--wow! NO WONDER it got a michelin rating! This is the type of restaurant that is *absolutely* worth the splurge. My husband also got the plate of tarts/pies for his birthday, and they were absolutely delicious. I can't remember what we had exactly, what stood out was the dessert we had; I can't remember what it was called, but it was like a pineapple custard, and I think they whipped some coconut cream until it was very light and airy (must have had heavy cream--it was SO decadent) topped with a caramel crisp... It doesn't sound extraordinary (I didn't think it did), but it blew us away..Also, we sat in the bar area WAY in the back, so the bartender (a very cordial gentleman) was helping us, and he gave great recommendations, including an apple WINE..Now we thought what you must be thinking--probably some expensive cider! To our pleasant surprise it really did taste like a delicious dessert wine, it didn't taste at all like apple juice/cider. It is a canadian wine and the apples freeze on the trees, leaving a very sweet residue that is extracted together with the bit of juice--honestly, you've never tasted anything like this! It's called ""Neige"" and we plan to buy a bottle! Anyway, this restaurant was amazing--hopefully we can come back for a special occasion!!",ZbOTyq1s0BAsV30TnNfhrw,1,1,5,Q6g7hvkkBUxXpRcD-ZqgAw
2232562,2013-06-11,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"L'Atelier is considered the more casual of choices for Michelin rated restaurants in Vegas but I was still extremely impressed with the dishes and service. Looking at some less than positive reviews though I have to remind anyone looking to go here that you are eating at the casual locale as opposed to the finer dining option next door. 

Our party of four sat at the bar top facing the kitchen and I have to recommend this to those who would think that table service would be better. We had an extremely attentive waiter who really made the dining experience what it was. The sommelier was also perfect with his choices for the spring tasting menu wine pairing and spent time chatting with us about some of the decisions. At one point he brought out an opposing bottle to the course we were eating to point out a subtle dichotomy between two wines and how he came to decide on the one they paired with the dish. Another positive of sitting at the bar top was the ability to watch the finely oiled machine of french chefs and cooks working seamlessly together to plate and execute. The french kitchen chatter added to the ambiance and was quite pleasant. 

We all decided upon the spring tasting menu with wine pairing and although close to $300 a person once the wine is factored in, I felt I was getting my money's worth with each plate.

Notable dishes:
The starting Amuse Bouche, foi gras parfet with port wine and parmesan foam, was a wonderful starter to the evening. The wine pairing also kicked off perfectly alngside it with a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. The amuse bouche set the very rich theme of this tasting menu. I think there was foi gras in three or four of the 9 dishes. The foi gras stuffed quail with mashed potatoes was the main entree dish and absolutely perfect. It's funny to rave about mashed potatoes but I have never in my life eaten mashed potatoes that tasted so perfect. Our waiter explained that it is actually one of the house specialties and prep for them starts extremely early and is taken very seriously. Serious mashed potatoes. I tried the other main dish choice which was french hanger steak, also very good. Another wonderful dish was white asparagus in a  white asparagus sauce/soup covered in prosciutto. Asparagus was cooked perfectly, the sauce was rich and buttery and the prosciutto is always a plus in my book. 

I made the mistake of not taking a picture of the menu and can't for the life of me conjure up any french to explain a few of the other dishes that wowed me so the very lay mens version is as follows. A dish with alaskan king crab on top of a gelee with pea puree poured over everything. (I know that usually it's sea urchin but this evening they switched to a crab) Taking all layers in at one bite tasted like you were eating an extremely good fresh crab salad. 
First dessert was a mango ice cream over cut passion fruit painted with gold leaf. Excellent. 
Second dessert was a mint ice cream with all kinds of different chocolate layers. Also excellent.  

There was a white fish dish that was a miss for all of us. It had a perfect crisp skin crusted with salt, but it didn't feel like it fit in beside all the extremely rich dishes. 

If you're looking for excellent food in a less stuffy atmosphere than other comparably priced restaurants in Vegas, you've found your winner.",kHQEBK-nZ-A6rYm8eZzeHQ,2,1,5,hf8U3-7PXrtpFQYmPRVG0Q

We were eying up some potatoes at the seat next to us and I asked (cause I have no shame) if we could get a sample of those potatoes and they ended up giving us a huge portion of them! The pork belly, the quail eggs, the salmon were amazing!!!! My dessert consisted of a medley of ice creams, ranging from vanilla to pineapple and was the perfect ending to the perfect meal. We walked out, tummies quite happy. Sure, it was a bit pricey, but it was sooooooo worth it.

We went with one Prix Fix and many carte items to accompany. This wound up working really well for us and I'd recommend the strategy to others. 

Essentially every ting was great - langoustine fritter, tuna belly, gelee, suckling pig (oui oui), mashed potatoes (they are known for them and BTW they are like 35% ""butter"") and more. The beef rib eye was good, but the Poached baby Kussi oysters with French butter we the highlight for me - two orders please.

The anti-eggplant only meh when it comes to veggies even loved it. Second course was a langostine -- it was a fried yummy treat.  Then the entree (salmon or pork belly). Next, really tasty cheese.

It's a peaceful dining experience given the craziness of the casino floor just outside the restaurant. I like the flexibility of the menu ranging from small plates (tapas style) to regular a la carte, to various prix fixe options. We went with a combination of a la carte and prix fixe.

The foie gras amuse bouche to start is amazing... beautiful taste as you scoop up the yummy goodness through the foam on top. Bread service is excellent and offers a nice variety of crisp Parisienne style mini breads to regular slices.

Had a variety of dishes from the pain con tomate with iberico ham, calamari, mini gyozas/raviolis, beef short ribs, steak and finished with a lovely coffee and chocolate ice cream type dessert. The pain con tomate was crispy throughout and full of flavor. Solid presentation and tastes throughout the meal with nice pacing of courses.

Been dyeing to try this place after scrolling through many of their pictures, drooling every night and of course the raving reviews. Located in the MGM Grand, its a very small restaurant. A few table seating but what makes the difference between L'Atelier and Joel is L'Atelier is more limited dining, a little casual, and you get to sit at the bar and watch the chef and sous chef prepare your dinner. Joel is more romantic and elegant. 

After deciding either or not to do the pre fix menu we decided to do our own pre fix which was more like tapas style we choose the smaller dishes so we can try a bit of everything!
The bread basket is indeed the best. I loved the mini round croissants and the perfect crisped bread, even the butter was amazing. Luckily we got refills but be careful they get you!
_Amuse bouche, which was some foie gras with foam on top was heaven! a bit of a egg custard texture. That was just the tease. I could have had 5 more shots of those.
_Le Jambon, Iberico ham with toasted bread and tomatoes. Not a big fan of ham but this wins ham of the year. The chef said this ham is around $900! a tad salty, does not even need bread, just the ham itself is more than enough.
_La Langoustine, Crispy lobster with bail pesto was a huge tease. Only comes in one so I had to treasure that one bite. 
_La Durade, Snapper marinated with lime was so fresh and went well with all the sauces. Presentation was also beautiful.
_Uni, can't remember the name but this one dish I was not a big fan of. I love uni but with the pea soup I feel it did not compliment each other. Both overpowering flavors you loose the taste of each with the strong flavors of the pea.
_La Caille, one of the most popular dish, drum rolls please.... foie gras stuffed quail with mashed potatoes, drooling at the moment. So tiny I was almost in tears. It was the best dish I've ever had. OR it can be my withdrawals of foie gras every aspect of the dish was perfect! A bite and an ooze of the foie gras burst in your mouth and the potatoes were out of this world. 
_LE burger, Beef and foie gras burgers! say what?! beef AND foie gras! 2 bite size burgers were more than enough since it was a rich dish. OMG perfect, can I get a hallelujah! 
_Le Chocolate, one of the best chocolate desserts. It had me at oreo cookie crumbs. spongy on top, layered with gelato and oreo bites on the bottom, perfect texture and taste.
_LA Framboise, was a show.. A ball of white chocolate and a guy poured raspberry sauce on top and the ball opened up slowly! taste it was good but I'm not a big fan of white chocolate. 
_Les tartes, this was complimentary from out waiter, about 5 tiny tartes to try. Some were good and some were a miss but it was free so I'll take it!

Overall I would definitely come back here again any day anytime! A great experience and damn I'm getting emotional just thinking its in Vegas come back to me L'Atelier!!!",1a60tzkZy_9iruwRZl9nyQ,4,3,5,7Rabo0bSnBaarLlCD9r_NA

2371730,2010-06-06,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Monsieur Rochuchon, Chef of the Century,

I thought you should know that your L'Atelier in Vegas is quickly becoming a 0-star restaurant. Here's some complimentary advice for you free-of-charge:

1) Use Open Table!!!!!!  
We were coming in town for the Jabbawockeez and had booked a table at L'Atelier before the show. We were distraught to find upon arrival that your staff had made a mistake and booked us for the next day. All your hostess and manager managed to tell us was ""We're fully committed"" over and over. When asked about an empty table in the front, we were told by the manager that there were many big parties that evening and the table was reserved for a party of six that wouldn't otherwise fit at the bar. To add insult to injury, three ladies walked up 45 minutes into our wait, talked to someone they knew who worked at the restaurant, and the 6-person table was promptly re-set for the three of them and they were seated.  Another five minutes passed and we were finally seated in the back by the entrance to the kitchen. If we didn't have a show to go to at the MGM and a time constraint, we would not have waited. Heck, we weren't even offered to wait in the comfort of the lounge! If you were to take reservations through Open Table, there would be no questions when a reservation is scheduled; all the unpleasantries could have been avoided!

2) Hire more seasoned, mature management staff.  
The manager walked passed us many times after we were seated. She avoided eye contact every time and not once did she come by to apologize for the mix-up or attempt to explain why the 6-person table that was not available for us but was apparently available for the three ladies who came after us. 

3) Hire more experienced wait staff. 
    - Would you believe it?  I was half way through my chilled foie gras course before a wait staff brought the toast and said ""More toast?"" I never got toast in the first place!  I wouldn't be surprised at this type of service at restaurant belonging to a chef who is a newbie in the culinary world; but not you, Monsieur Joel Robuchon!
    - The wait staff was told about our time constraint of a 9:30 pm show. Despite that, the service did not speed up to accommodate our timeframe. After waiting 50 minutes to get seated, we waited another 20 minutes before we got bread!!! Our last dishes were served within minutes before 9:30 pm. Our friend only got to take a couple bites of her last dish. Horrible time management. By contrast, Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante at the Venetian did a wonderful job managing the pace of our dinner so we were able to leave in time for our departure flight.

We were disgusted to have spent almost $400 between the four of us to be treated like second class citizens. The food didn't make up for it either. We really looked forward to dining at your L'Atelier but were thoroughly disappointed.",65uXk38DABB4uofHRP7VyQ,8,1,1,6AJI4pC3502e9BtytKxqyw

This was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had in Las Vegas. It was so fun to watch all the kitchen staff cook and plate so beautifully and intricately. 
Service was everything I expected and more. I wish I could remember the name of our waiter but I do remember he was trying to learn to speak Portuguese and was interested in learning languages. Anyway, he was polite, friendly, and made the whole dining experience more memorable because he was personable and tried to make us feel comfortable in such a fancy place for the first time. He didn't laugh at my terrible pronunciation of the dishes which was nice. 
The food was incredible... started with the perfect bread which had a crusty exterior and soft interior with their soft and creamy butter... and from the amuse bouche (Parmesan foam and foie gras, hello), to the divine desserts, I had not one complaint. My husband and I ordered 4 menu items each. I will just mention my favorites as everything was pretty freaking tasty. 
Anything with foie gras was very delicious and sinful as it should be... of my dishes the star was the Le Foie Gras- huge thick slice of foie gras with crostini and a tart wine-infused accompaniment like a jelly or marmalade... I wanted to cry eating this because it was so well-balanced and just astonishing in flavor for lack of a better word... the other star was the La Sole... if you've ever seen the movie Julie Julia you'll recognize this fish dish... Dover sole cooked in bubbling brown butter and bathed with it over the top as it cooks... so flaky and tender and buttery... the lemon squeeze cut through the heaviness of the dish and oh my god is it worth getting. 
My favorite dessert was the Le Chocolat... it had different textures and temperatures and had just the right amount of sweetness... the thin chocolate layer at the top was so delicate... the Oreo-esque cookie in the middle was crumbly and sweet... the pudding or ice cream was perfect and creamy... best chocolate dessert maybe ever.

Unlike the mansion, L'atelier is a much more casual restaurant coupled with a vibrant and interactive experience where the best seat in the house is actually at the counter!

Our server was warm friendly and helpful with the menu, which included the enticing Seasonal Discovery Tasting Menu. We all decided to go with that with wine pairings and our exhilarating journey began. We were started with an amuse bouche, which was a Parfait of foie gras with Parmesan cream coupled with a glass of Veuve Clicquot Champs.  The flavor profiles were impeccable. Creamy smooth fragrant and indulgent. A spectacular start to our meal.

The breads were warm and fluffy. My personal favorite was the buttery brioche that was flaky, light, and simply delicious. 

The first course was a beautiful Alaskan king crab on a delicate gelee and cream of spiced fresh peas. It was both refreshing and flavorful.

Next up were beautifully seared medallions of buttery diver scallops, which were served with a vibrant shimeji salad that brought out just the right amount of acidity to this wonderful dish.

La Cebette
A crisp white onion tart topped with savory smoked bacon green asparagus and crowned with a perfectly cooked quail egg. 
Easily one of my favorite dishes of the evening.

Seared duck foie gras
Served au torchon, this satisfying dish made me realize why I waited so long to enjoy foie gras in Vegas. Decadently rich, yet infinitely satisfying!

John Dory served with a crisp skin
This beautiful dish was served with a irresistible tomato saffron bouillon sauce that had a subtle earthy, fragrant flavor. 

Free range quail stuffed with foie gras. 
The quail leg was cooked to perfection and the stuffed quail was flavorful and rich.

Hanger steak
With a beautifully pink center and a melt in your mouth texture, this was easily the best cut of steak I had the pleasure to enjoy all weekend! Oh and the accompanying creamy mash potatoes? Like velvet and yes they're ridiculously good as everyone boasts! 

The mango mouse dessert was exemplary! A fantastic finish to our extraordinary meal.
It was cool, smooth creamy and fragrant. A combination quite fitting for any successful dessert 

The final dish was no ""also ran"" it was as easy on the eyes as it was on the palate. A bright and tantalizing Creme de menthe atop a decadently rich chocolate cake. It truly was a fantastic finale to our inspiring meal.

I can't speak enough about our experience here. Dining at the chef's table was a truly organic experience that involved a lot of interaction with the sommelier and staff on a personal level that made for an unforgettable experience I will cherish for years to come!

They do not have service that is even close to the first class service in Paris. Horrible horrible horrible service. You will wait forever to get your food. Here was my experience:

Went here for our 12th anniversary. Sat down, ordered food, five small plates. People around us that had sat down after us were on their second or third course and we still didn't have our first course. After 30 minutes we told our waiter and he said that it is coming. No food still. After 40 minutes we called the manager over and after informing him that we had sat there for 40 minutes and not even had our first course, we left.

2420551,2007-10-06,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"With a high recommendation from my brother, I decided to check out some fine French dining.  

As those close to me know, I went on my annual trip to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  And my good friends know that Esther does not gamble.  (Well, unless you count a max of $5 on nickel video poker).  So what else does a single girl with a disposable income do in Vegas?  Eat, Drink and Party!

First stop, as soon as we arrived in Vegas, we went straight to L'atelier at the MGM.  We order a bottle of wine, and start the Chef's Tasting Menu.  As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere is casual, almost farmer's market with the baskets of herbs set out in the kitchen and glass bowls filled with possible fresh veggies and fruits for decor.  Yet, you know that you have walked into an upper class sort of casual, as the color scheme is black and red. 

It is counter seating, so you can watch the cooks prepare your food.  Since it is a tasting menu, there were about 9 or 10 dishes.  The dishes (glassware) itself was fabulous, I mean, very decorative and large.  The tastings were also fairly good portions.  

We started out with a cucumber gelee with tarragon and cumin.  At first taste, I wasn't quite sure if this was a good thing, but with the second bite, I was hooked.  It was very cleansing and refreshing.  Secondly, came out the tuna tartar: using bluefin tuna with tomato infused olive oil.  It was awesome.  However, not the best tuna quality I've had.  I almost wish that it would have melted in my mouth. 

One of my favorite tastings was the: La Chataigne which is a light chestnut velout with caramelized foie gras and bacon. God, so foamy light yet so much flavor.   The salmon came out with this little kettle of con fit potatoes which seemed like it had to have at least 2 sticks of butter and cream with just a little potato.  Had I not been on a ""ahem"" diet, I probably would have devoured the whole serving, but....I practice temperance.....hahaha

You can choose between stuffed quail with froie gras, but you know me, I'm a red meat sort of girl, so I got the hanger steak.  It was good, but you know, I actually think that the hanger steak at Mustards in Napa is much better.  The desserts.  OH MY GOD!!!! Mandarin con fit the the sheep milk yogurt...and the PEAR SORBET.  your meal cannot end on any better note.

First off, we came right before Christmas and the decor in the kitchen was beautiful. Not sure if it's always that way, but the black contrasting with the bright colors of the fruits and veggies was a really nice touch.

The amuse bouche was a foie gras mousse. Delicious, creamy, savory. I wish that would be an item on the menu I could order.

We decided to go a la carte since the tasting menu was quite extensive and they ask the whole party gets tasting if one person does. Some notable dishes were the lobster pasta and king crab salad. Although...the salad was a bit too salty for our taste. We were watching the staff season the salad for another guest and saw how much salt was put on top of it ... which is a shame when using fresh ingredients because you hide the fresh taste. The pasta was delicious. Perfectly al dente, good textured lobster.

The mackerel dish we got was pretty good, nothing outstanding.

Foie gras was good but it was my fault for ordering it after already having the foie gras mousse ... it was a bit too much fat for me in one sitting. Also, my husband got the Australian wagyu beef and there was SO. MUCH. FAT. Trust me, we've had wagyu from Australia, wagyu from Japan, wagyu from America, wagyu from your mom ... but wow, this was the first time I've seen so much fat on it. Not sure if it's the cut they received that day or they usually ask for that, but I think 20% of the steak was inedible, pure fat. We could barely eat it and had to send it back. The manager was nice enough to offer something else but after all that fat, we couldn't eat anything else without feeling sick so he just took it off our tab.

The cocktail I got was delicious. Forgot the name...started with an ""L""? Red drink, tarte and sweet. Look out for it!

The restaurant is located inside MGM but not part of the casino. We went there yesterday with my Fiance and LOVED IT. The restaurant is pricey but well worth the money as you go for the experience. We ordered the $78 per person menu item and got 5 different things. The portions were small BUT since it takes a while for the items to come, you will get full. I'm a type of guy that loves going to restaurants where the portions are big so I was not too sure about this place but surprisingly I got full. First they brought the bread. IT WAS YUMMY with the best butter that I have ever tasted. The main course / soup / desert were ALL GREAT. If you go to this place expect to pay around $220 - $250 minimum for two people. The servers were friendly and very professional.

2458649,2014-11-29,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Had it been three years ago, I would have given L'Atelier 5 shiny stars because it was, has been, and continue to be (at least in my mind) one of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas and with most one Michelin stars in my life.

However, on a recent return visit I felt slightly differently about it ...

But I still love dining at their open kitchen bar. The atmosphere, the environment, the seeing the prep part ... those were all quite amazing. I highly recommend this spot still, but maybe go and try the big daddy Joel Robuchon instead because I imagine that place is amazing.

The first time I came, they actually made us wait for our table a bit, so we ended up in Joel Robuchon's lounge where the expertly curated table of whiskeys greeted us along with a very very knowledgable bartender / whiskey expert. It was a very enjoyable experience even though it started because we had to wait for our table. 

However, the 2nd time, they seated us at a table instead of the bar ... so maybe that's why. But I also thought the food wasn't as good.

The first time I was absolutely shocked. I've been to so many French, American, etc. restaurants they started to blend together. When the waiter comes out and tells you the list of ingredients, you almost glaze over it because you don't really know half of them anyway. However, L'Atelier was different. They used ingredients I seriously could find in my own fridge, at my grocery store and in my pantry. Completely normal and ordinary ingredients but they made them extraordinary. They prepared dish after dish of amazing from plain things I had in my own house. This to me was the mark of an incredible chef because he truly transformed the ingredients and transcended their average qualities. 

The last time I went it was less so ... hence not 5-shiny stars. I still love this place though and may come back again when I'm in Vegas next time around.",EiwxlbR8fb68lMgEXhcWKA,2,1,4,ZR_sN1n_C_wmHkPCSuzhGA

2472900,2008-11-12,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"For my 4 days in Vegas I carefully contemplated where to dine and set on L'Atelier which was my best dining experience so far this year.  The decor is perfect- modern, open kitchen, very sophisticated without any stuffiness, and spick-and-span clean- no odors or smoke coming out of the kitchen.  Service was perfect.  

I am not a mojito person but the raspberry mojito here is luscious- maybe because they add Chambord?  

The amuse-bouche is exceptional- fois gras with parmesan and port- I could eat at least 3 of these! 

One of my favorite dishes was the quail stuffed with fois gras and the mashed potatoes are delicious.  Kampachi was excellent except I don't like capers, same story with the steak tartar.  I can't remember having better oysters- the ones here are exquisite!

John Dory was great, main lobster was delicious including the broth although the macaroni was nothing special- tasted like package macaroni. Langoustine was excellent and despite it being a fritter you don't get that fried taste at all.  Pork belly is tasty although can get a bit fatty after a few bites.  The spaghetti is a carbonara- it's very good quality but the ingredients don't differ fro a standard carbonara so I would recommend trying the other dishes first.  

Framboise dessert was lovely- white chocolate fondant with raspberries and the Pina Colada is a wonderful light option that comes in a glass with ""poppers"" that explode in your mouth.  I happened to be sitting next to an MGM manager who sent over Les Tartes which was absolutely delicious- an assortment of mini pastries, most of them ethereal and a lovely home made taste.  A couple next to me was celebrating an anniversary and their petit four plate  had ""Happy Anniversary"" written with raspberry coulis- very pretty!  Ate here several times over the past few days and can't wait to return.  For all you Vegas gourmandes- I would pick L'Atelier over Picasso any day!!

Towards the end of my meal Mr Robuchon himself showed up and introduced himself.  It was very inspiring to be in his presence; I feel lucky to have had the pleasure of conversing with him and receiving a signed copy of his cookbook.  I also had a chance to visit the main restaurant which is simply/stunning/sophisticated/ classical/modern/ baroque/serene all at once.",BAAKaScq9e96wT3UJmtUzw,1,1,5,GJEtGGeFDV86nWMGT24EBg

We sat on stools at the bar with our backs to the front entrance with a grand view of the culinary drama and genius at play. Service was impeccable, and the timing of our dishes was perfectly executed. The kitchen ran like a well oiled machine. A delightfully wicked glee ran through me when I witnessed the chef sample and sneer before tossing some prepped food that failed to meet his standard into the trash, followed by a fleeting sadness for the waste. 

Started off with some bubblies since it was a special occasion. Could not resist the bread basket, especially that fluffy cheese croissant. The dining experience was a sublime rollercoaster from start to finish; one I would gladly stand in line for immediately after!

L'Amuse Bouche was a shotglass of airy cheesy foam atop a delectable morsel of foie gras parfait with port wine reduction. The parmesan emulsion lightened and enhanced the richness of the foie gras underneath, and really got my juices flowing! 

L'Hamachi was not a pasta ravioli as I had imagined from the description in the Seasonal Discovery Menu, but rather two generous slivers of raw hamachi wrapped around sea urchin in lemon vinaigrette topped with caviar. This dish married all of my favorite things into two bites and took my tongue to another dimension which did not bode well for the next two dishes.

Le Macaroni - macaroni in a comte gratin, mushroom and smoked bacon was a comforting blend of soft textures and hearty flavors, but my palate was still reeling from the yellowtail caviar uni so it tasted great but not as intense.

Le Crabe Royal - king crab curried served over a couscous of broccolini and fresh herbs - I prefer my seafood unadulterated, so the dish lacked punch. This was my least favorite dish.

Le Foie Gras de Canard - seared foie gras with sweet and sour grapes and black pepper brought my tastebuds back to the incline. The acid grapes and bite from the pepper contrasted and complimented the seared foie gras. It's a blessing FG is banned in California otherwise I would be eating this every freaking day.

Le Matsutake - this rare and expensive mushroom bouillion with gingered leeks, quail egg was presented in a humble and delicate bowl and tasted as delicate and pure as it looked.

Le Saint Pierre - a pleasantly firm John Dory over tender artichoke hearts served ""en barigoule"" tasted immaculately pristine, delicate and satisfying in the most comforting way. And just when I thought I was full my lips tasted

La Caille - caramelized free range quail stuffed with foie gras, served with the fluffiest buttery mashed potatoes EVER. The nuggets of foie gras with the roast quail was exquisite and took me over the edge so that I could not share  

La Hampe - but the BF assured me that the french style hanger steak with roasted shallot and shishito pepper was properly executed. I for one was done. DUN. until I saw dessert and honestly can say that while I cannot recall the flavors of 

Le Frasier - strawberry cream, chiffon biscuit and strawberry sorbet 

Le Dulce revived me - chocolat fondant with dulce cream and cherry sherbet was delightfully gorgeous and easy on the eyes and tongue. I am not a dessert person, but this was divine and I will gladly return for Le Dulce.",UwmtWzBdbi4AAJiuBrXrQA,5,3,5,BdQScJH-CARRdM1une3fug

As my first Michelin star experience, I had high hopes which were reached in terms of food and ambiance, but the meal was not without its mishaps in terms of service. A group of four of us selected Menu A, which included an amuse bouche, two appetizers, a main, and a dessert. The avocado vegetable medley and pumpkin veloute appetizers were both world class, as was the chocolate coffee dessert. However, the dory fish main was dry and missed the mark, and the kitchen was backed up so the pace of our meal was slow to start and our courses didn't always come out together. For the first appetizer, there was even a miscommunication and one of the servers thought that since my sister and I had chosen the exact same menus that we were sharing one meal, as he only brought out one of the appetizers. (Note: Evidently, you can share the without incurring a sharing fee, which I'd totally recommend!) It was only after we had almost finished that appetizer course that the second one came out.

Ambiance: 3.5/5

Prices: $$$$ (avg 100/person)

I believe this is the first Michelin Star restaurant in the USA that I have eaten since living in the USA from 2004. Another restaurant that i think is Michelin worthy is ""da Marco"" in Houston, TX.

This is definitely the IT crowd, the decor is very contemporary & stylish with fresh cuts carrots, cucumbers and what not submerged in water  in different sizes of the jars display around the open kitchen... My partner & I were seated at the counter by the corner just when you comes in from the entrance. Its narrow and a bit too close to your neighbor to be gossiping about other diners ;-) 

There are 3 choices - the Club (Fall Tasting) 5-course Menu $75/pax, the 8 or more course menu for $148/pax and of course the ala carte! The appetizer and entree average from $25 and above... if you have the money, go for the ala carte, otherwise, check out the well worth Club Menu like us as the first timer! Eventhough the portions are small but by the time you done with your desserts, you are just right! But dont expect the ""American"" size stuffed till your neck stuff ok...

We started with a glass of Rioja, always a great wine. Then the amazing culinary experience begin as follow:

L'amuse bouche - Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam. By far this was the best tasting and utterly amusing little teaser i ever had. They gave you a spoon to scoop the parfait slowly enjoying each layer of it...

Soup - some sort of pumpkin cream soup. Again, perfect texture with sprinkles of spices and sunflower seeds.

La langoustine - Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto. The perfectly boiled langoustine wrapped in some sort of wonton skin & deep fried. My opinion, the basil pesto sauce for dipping is redundant, its too bland, could have been better if they mix a tiny bit of mustard in it. Nevertheless, I wish i can get more... if you order ala carte, you get 4 of these yummy fritter!

Entree - We chosed the salmon over rib eye. Very decent size, nicely seasoned and grilled salmon. Unfortunately, with all the amazing taste from the previous dishes, this entree tasted too ""normal"", nothing special but still great.

Cheese - 3 very strong French cheese plate which i cannot remember what's what! Again, i'm more of a gorgonzolla, camembert, rocquefort kinda guy.

Dessert - 4 small pieces of Chef choice desserts. I was too stuffed to really enjoy the rich, chocolaty desserts.

I would have given this 4.5 Stars if the entree would have been kept the same par with the previous dishes... But still, this is a well worth visit and if i ever go back to Vegas, I will definitely check out the other restaurant and have a proper table sitting instead. Some may say, this is just another hype partly due to the ""Michelin"" thingy. I used to think the same but from my eating extravaganza around Europe, some of the Michelin place is definitely over-rated and over-priced but some are truly genius and deserve the accolades, Joel is one of them!",Dqjl-5PzMl3gHHgTTPRF4A,1,2,4,AZAlV2P6xwaIGzzVENQwcA

Each piece of crab, lettuce, tomato and avocado slice was carefully placed on the plate like a work of art.

LE PIQUILLO - Piquillo pepper with smoked eggplant and tuna belly confit - This did not stand out.  The flavor didn't meld together.  It didn't impress.  3 Stars.

LE SAINT PIERRE - John Dory seared in lemongrass virgin olive oil with tomato - The fish was cooked well.  It was a little too light for me and I would have appreciated bigger and bolder flavors.  But, as a dish to prepare you for the more savory steak that was following, it did it's job.  This was a nice dish.  4 Stars.

LA CAILLE - Caramelized free range quail stuffed with foie gras served with mashed potato - The quail was cooked perfectly.  It was moist.  However the foie gras was missing in this dish.  I could hardly taste it.  3 Stars.

LA HAMPE - French style hanger steak with roasted shallot and shishito pepper - The steak was tender and full of flavor.  It was not as hearty as the traditional American Steak.  But the flavor was on point and was a good way to end the savory portions of our meal. 4 Stars

LA FRAISE - Light lime ganache with strawberry and tomato sorbet - This dessert was beautiful to look at.  The taste was nice and was a subtle way to transition from savory to sweet.  It wasn't overly sweet so it worked well.  4 Stars.

LE CERISE - Cherry-Chocolate peanut sable on an Amarena ice cream - Awesome ending.  The flavors were great.  This dessert was bold and sweet.  It left a lasting flavor in my mouth even after we left.  This is how you do it!  5 Stars.

SEASONAL DISCOVERY MENU
$155/Person
(Wine Pairing $105)

Overall, we had a great time with the tasting menu. There were some stand-out dishes that made the meal worthwhile. However, dinner was very pricey with three glasses of wine and juice. Final bill came to $445 for 2 people. We loved approximately half of the tasting menu; thus, $445 seems steep for just half. But the half that we liked was excellent, so L'atelier still gets the A. The minus was purely because they goofed on our seating. My husband had requested table seating (not bar seating), and I was right there when he made the reservations. But they didn't have this noted, so we ended up sitting at the bar. 

    * L'AMUSE-BOUCHE - Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam

Actually very tasty - different way to experience foie gras. My husband liked it more than I did though.

    * LE FOIE GRAS - Foie gras with beef stew gelee, celery mousse and wasabi

Our waiter said this was a new dish, first time served that night. But not my favorite dish, since I wasn't fond of the gelee. 

    * LA SAINT-JACQUES - Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil

Wow, one of my favorites of the night. Will definitely order again. Scallop was perfectly seasoned - it was light, soft and tasty! Best scallop I've tasted.

    * LES HUITRES - Poached baby Kussi oysters with French Echire butter

Loved these too, wish we had a huge plate of these Oysters! Definitely will order again. Probably the best oysters I've had.

    * LA CEBETTE - White onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus

Good, but didn't stand out. Forgetful.

    * LA SOLE - Dover sole filet, baby leek with ginger

Very good, reminded me of Asian-style fish. Fish was very nicely done. Not sure I would order this again, only because it's very similar to what my Chinese father-in-law (also a chef) can do and there are so many other entrees that I can order. :) But overall, very good.

    * LA CAILLE - Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes

WOW. Our absolute favorite of the night. So so good. Would order again and again. Dinner would not have been worth $155/person had it not been for this dish. I would probably order this and one of the seafood dishes if I ordered a la carte (scallops or oysters or both!).

    * LA NOIX DE COCO - Coconut mousse on rosé Champagne granité

Pass for me. Not a coconut fan. Hubby liked it though.

    * LE CHOCOLAT - Creamy chocolate ganache and caramelized banana with Yuzu juice

Not a fan either. I was sad that I didn't like either of the desserts.

    * LE CAFE - Coffee or Espresso

Love French press! Coffee ended up being the sweet taste I liked best from the night.

Next time, we'd love to try Joel Robuchon next door. But we'd have to save up big time for that meal! The tasting menu runs about $385/person there (without wine, tax or tip)!",gQxXz8gZcI3PJRHY5XPHBg,3,2,5,-pgYSwv7maVXg3Yu9ovhJw

To call it arrogant and rude would be an understatement. The timing of dishes was ghastly... it completely removed any possibility of enjoyment.

We knew to expect counter seating, and since I sit on a balance ball chair at work it didn't bother me, but the lack of a seat back could be a drawback for many people (sis included).

We decided to go with the pre-theater menu, where you get an amuse-bouche and choice of two items from the menu. I was fine with water, but let my family talk me into a pear martini, which was nice but definitely pricey at $17.00! The amuse-bouche was some sort of foie gras mousse and was absolutely divine! I could have eaten a dozen of them!!!

My sister and I decided to choose our 4 favorites and split them. We almost chose the langoustine fritters but at the last minute decided on the tart, and were so incredibly glad we made that choice! I had no idea a simple tart could taste so sublime. We also had the hangar steak, then the John Dory and the quail. I actually preferred both the ""appetizers"" or small plate dishes, the steak and tart were divine. The fish was quite good but a bit much butter for me. I liked the quail as well, but have never had it before so hard to compare (my sister didn't care for it). The ""entrees"" or large plates came with a side of mashed potatoes for each of us (not sure if that is standard or not) and they were decadently creamy and delicious as well. 

The bread basket and butter would have made a meal in themselves, and I had sworn not to fill up with anything so plebeian as bread. But this bread was by no means plebeian! So well worth eating :-).

My brother in law went with the lobster pasta (which I didn't try) and the malabar steak (which was excellent).

We hadn't been sure we'd get filled up, but honestly were stuffed at the end of the meal.

I would absolutely love to try the tasting menu, just to get even more of a variety (our fellow diners seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their tasting menus!). I'll just have to save up money for a bit or try to win at slots before my next trip!

Bottom line, if you want to be spoiled with service and have some outstanding food, and don't mind spending money, this is the place to go!",D9Xvq8fwDNyxBCK8gjIdFA,1,0,5,oy1eFlx20l1I404NyhRveg

Surprisingly easy to book a table and sat at the bar and had an assortment of their small plates. Tried to sell us on 4 small plates each being a meal, but that would have been way too much. Ultimately shared five small plates between two of us and it was plenty - maybe even a little too much.

Very much liked the burger with food gras. Absolutely essential and probably the best thing we had that night. Also enjoyed the kampachi tartare.

Also tried the soft boiled egg and a couple other things that honestly just weren't as memorable.

2598188,2017-08-25,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Summary: An amazing experience. Fantastic food, incredible staff, a wonderful view to behold beautiful food being crafted before your very eyes with such precision and intricacy. The chef is young and incredibly talented, but friendly and conversational. Very pricey, so don't come here expecting to escape at under $200 for two people, but you will definitely be full. Also much more casual than Robuchon next door (business casual).

My wife and I went here for dinner on a Tuesday evening. We were very excited to check it out because of the unique way that the dining counter encircles the kitchen, allowing patrons to view the construction and cooking of their food by meticulous, talented chefs. Upon arrival, we were quickly seated along the counter and met our server, whom was standing across from us on the kitchen side. He helped us select a wine for us to enjoy and gave us a rundown of the menu. After that, he gave us as much time as we needed to identify our selections (since there are a LOT of options available for a la carte selection).

The way the menu works is as follows: there are two different prix fixe menu options (one vegetarian and one non) and then a long list of individual items that can be ordered in either two ($55), three ($98), or four-course ($?) dining options with an amuse bouche and dessert included (except for the two-course). Each of the ""build your own menu"" options has its own starting price, and then based on which items you choose there is a supplemental fee right next to the item that gets added on to the base price. These are the items we ordered as part of our three and four-course meals:

Le Saumon Starter - If you like lox, this is your dish. Super thinly sliced salmon with crispy potato strings and a little log of herb creme fraiche-like goodness. It's like bagels and schmear; Michelin-star style.  

Les Langoustines - Little lobster tails wrapped and fried to golden perfection. A great textural combo with tons of flavor.

L'Entrecote - A 12 oz Wagyu beef ribeye with potato puree. This was a TON of food, albeit quite tasty and tender. In retrospect, we could have done without this (or just done two three-course meals), but the potato puree was amazing. The best mashed potatoes-like food we have had. EVER.


Le Kampachi - Tender Yellowtail sashimi chunks with spicy guacamole and little crispy bits to add textural contrast. Amazing!

Le Homard - Torchio pasta (perfectly cooked to light al dente) with chunks of lobster and light broth sauce that foamed on top. Beautiful presentation.

Le Boeuf - Hanger steak cooked medium rare on top of a slightly tangy, but savory brown sauce with roasted shallots and pieces of Shishito pepper for a little extra zip. Good, but not my favorite.

Le Saumon Entree - A beautiful piece of salmon, slightly rare toward the center, with Sriracha aioli and mushrooms. Great textures and flavors. Excellent presentation. Very full after eating this much.

Le Chocolat - A journey in chocolate. Ranging from darker to sweeter, crunchy to soft and creamy, cold to warm, and all with an amazing aesthetic. A very sweet way to top off a wonderful meal.


Everything was amazing in this meal. Truly a culinary experience to revere and we will start saving up for the next time we'll be able to afford such a decadent dining delight. Cheers to you Chef!",mrPUDzaxNQDc-JXG3JmuFw,4,2,5,BUT_A0YnAMovgk-ORc69Hg

Our torchon of foie was not quite finished or perhaps not cleaned properly before preparing, though the foie stuffed quail hit home. And their Iberico ham, purely amazing, if you a cured ham lover, this is ..... Well worth the investment. Salmon and duck breast were properly prepared, famous purée of potatoes were delicious. The framboise sphere with white chocolate and raspberry yuzu sauce was a feast for the eyes. The soufflé while beautifully presented and properly prepared fell flat on flavor.

A light amuse bouche and an appetizer of crabe royal (king crab) were a great way to cleanse, yet prime, the palate for all that was yet to come. The l'anguile fume (smoked eel) was bursting with texture and flavor, even more so with some foie gras as an accoutrement. This balance between texture and flavor continued with the next dish, les pates fraiches (spiced Maine lobster over orechiette), with perfectly executed al dente pasta matching the consistency of the somehow light, yet substantive, lobster. Next, the la hampe (French style hanger steak) was of an oh-so-tender, melt-in-your mouth consistency.

Service is outstanding and patient, especially when going through the many wine options available to pair with your dishes. What I also liked was the fact that there were lots of options to choose from on the menu, at all price points, so that you can sample a variety of offerings from the Joel Robuchon playbook while still suiting your budget.

If there was only one gripe I had about the experience, it's that the hostesses leave the front sliding door open whenever a new customer enters the restaurant, and don't close it until the customer is seated. Maybe this is proper etiquette, but what it leads to is a wind-tunnel effect of nasty, cold, smoky casino air washing over customers while the door is open. Personally, I'd say that it'd be better to close the door right after opening it.

Overall, however, this was delightful in every way, and a great way to sample Joel Robuchon's cuisine, which consistently receives Michelin stars almost everywhere he opens up. A perfect venue for my 750th Yelp review!",bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,4,4,5,bANs748Q7sA9Kc7ITi-OdA

Over the two hours the timing of the nine courses was perfect, the service was outstanding, the view of the kitchen and food preparation entertaining, and (did I already say?) the generous wine parings were perfect.

We aren't foodies and may never have a meal like this again. But if you're up for spending $500-$600 on a dinner and experience you'll remember for a longtime, this is a good choice.

My wife and I ate at the mansion a few months back and had one of the best dining experiences I can remember. L'atalier had all the elements to be great, but it just fell short.

The service, the ambience and overall atmosphere were superb. The food wasn't bad. But for the price and the expectation we had (being a Joel Robuchon restaurant), it missed the mark in many ways.

We started with the poached Kushi oysters and the hamachi ravioli. The oysters were decent, but only because they were high quality oysters. There was no pizazz. The hamachi crudo was wrapped around decadent uni roe (hence the ""ravioli"") and drizzled with a flavorful vinaigrette. Definitely the best thing we tried. 

The next two dishes were quite forgettable: 

Mushroom stuffed pasta gratineéd - a dish that's not exactly sure what it is, though the mushroom ragout was seasoned perfectly.
Langoustine fried in wonton with basil pesto - As I said with the oysters, this dish was decent, but only because of the langoustine. There was no expert technique involved, just top quality product.

We, next, had the famous foie gras stuffed quail. Certainly good and fairly balanced. The sweet soy glaze really rounded out the flavors.

Our sixth offering was the spaghetti with uni butter and leeks. We added three grams of shaved truffles from Alba. This was the biggest disappointment of the evening. There were aspects of this dish that were executed beautifully (perfectly cooked pasta and leeks), but it never really came together flavor wise. It was in dire need of salt and there was almost no presence of uni detected. The truffles were barely noticeable. It was very blah.

Our server was gracious enough to notice or distaste and kindly voided this dish off of our bill.

Our final course was the confit of suckling pig with braised cabbage. Again, impeccable execution of most of the components, but the dish was severely unbalanced. The cabbage screamed for some acid to counteract the beautifully fatty and unctuous pork. There was a palpable lack of sear on the pork itself (arguably the best part of a presentation like this). I also would've loved some kind of jus to bring everything together.

One more note. It's an open kitchen. I saw a lot of coughing, sneezing, ear wiping, finger tasting, etc. Blechhh...",HQlvsUqVhtJDH0ASBzaLsA,10,4,3,VQLwH46R3Y8jA3vxtJwMfA

Our meal is as follows:
Amuse - foie gras custard with parmesan cheese and pepper
First - Pumpkin squash soup
Second - Zucchini mozzarella eggplant - ratatouille
Third - ribeye steam with mashed potatoes
Fourth - cheese course
Fifth - a tasting of small french cakes

My favorites? the Amuse and the pumpkin soup, the amuse was absolutely amazing, I still think about it. I loved the pumpkin soup because it was served table side with creme fraiche. Everything just fit perfectly. THe rest of the meal was very ho-hum, nothing blew my mind. When they served us the steak it was literally a piece of steak on a plate. Not even a stupid garnish or anything - now I know I ordered steak, but you would think they would make it look a little pretty? It was just meat, straight up. The mashed potatoes that were famous? They tasted like the kind you buy in a box and put a crap load of butter into it. I did like it, but it was TOO rich, hence I couldn't finish it. Dessert was fine - your average desserts, nothing amazing. 

So why my 3 stars? minus 1 star for the food (standard fancy food fare) and minus 1 for the service. Our food came out at random times - not served together, I'm anal about that. If you're short staffed then at least bring it out one right after the other. I actually had to wait 5 minutes for my plate to come out after all my friends had theirs. They also didn't explain the food to the entire table but to the person they were standing closest next to, so we had to ask each other what we were eating. 

I won't be eating here again, not because the food wasn't good, it was, but because there are a million other places to try in Vegas.",I0tabWk9xQrVaAin9AnbWg,1,0,3,e5DvXNKr0CsEqhzbE6s8hw

We both did the tasting menu, and out of all the courses, we maybe actually enjoyed 2 - the ""entree"" part and the desert. The bread was alright too. But the rest of it was edible at best. I'm really not sure how much else I can say about this, but underwhelmed doesn't begin to describe it.

The service however, was good, and I definitely can't complain there. Ambience was nice. We sat at the bar. It's a tight fit up there, and it could be a little awkward if you're not there on a date (etc), especially if you're tall.

All said and done, I'm not likely to return to L'Atelier. Maybe if I really wanted to impress a snobby girl. One good thing did come from it though - I'll never have to worry about spending $300 a head at Robuchon's ""real"" restaurant.",21KWy-JENq6xVEly5xki0A,2,0,2,VDQPuR5bKBXs1jyyqstInw

We were seated at the bar right in the center facing the chefs. Due to the lack of time (we had to catch a show), we asked our waiter to keep us in check with our orders so we won't be running late. He was very attentive and recommended a few options for us. The manager also came over during dinner to wish us a Happy Anniversary (3 months so I guess wasn't too much of a milestone lol but they were nice enough to give us a complimentary dessert). I would have to say I really enjoyed their cocktails. The bartender actually customized a few drinks based on our taste (thanks to the wonderful bf who knew about my love for lychee). He personally delivered a blackberry lychee martini that wasn't on the menu and it was wonderfully delicious. The bf also enjoyed his La Perle (Brut). 

Okay so food, please DO NOT order the pulled pork, we both thought it tasted like pork stew. My favorites were the foie gras (both the actual entree and the cold appetizer) and the cured ham on bruschetta. Although bf made a comment that the cured ham he had while in Spain was substantially better (who knows, he's a lot pickier than I am). The carrot cake was nicely presented but I've had better carrot cake elsewhere. The langoustine was very delicious but $30 for a tiny ""half shrimp half lobster"", I just didn't see its value.

We ordered the 5-course Club menu, plus one of the small plates for each of us, served before the main course.

Amuse-bouche, foie gras/parmesan cheese/port wine parfait:  Pretty tasty.  Creamy, with a really strong parmesan flavor.  I'm not really a fan of foie gras, though.  Served on a lava rock. 

Pumpkin/ginger soup:  Ginger apparently goes great with pumpkin.  It was perfect.  Served in a martini glass/mini-fishbowl combo, with some miniature squash.

Langoustine fritter with pesto:  Probably my favorite dish.  The langoustine was perfectly fried, really tender and slightly sweet.  I would consider getting this a la carte, where it's available as both a small plate and a main course.

Venison small plate:  This is what I ordered.  It tasted fine, but not really worth it IMHO.

Sea scallop small plate:  A single scallop, served in shell, on a bed of sea salt, on top of a lava rock.  Great presentation.  My friend ordered this, and I had a little sliver of it.  Went very well with the seaweed butter, sweet, with a nice melt-in-your-mouth sort of quality.  

My other friends ordered the foie gras and the foie gras-stuffed quail.  I didn't try either, but the latter was reportedly very good.

Beef:  Beef cheek braised for 36 hours in red wine.  This was my main course.  It was flavorful, juicy, and ridiculously tender.  I liked this one better than the other main course, which was the salmon.  The main course came with a little dish of mashed potatoes, which were really, really creamy.  We tried to convince one of my friends that it was foie gras.  But we failed.

Cheese plate:  Three really tasty cheeses.  It was supposed to come with some bread.  Unfortunately, the bread came out 15 minutes late, and only after we reminded the waiter.  The bread was really good, but unfortunately I had already eaten most of the cheese by the time we got it.  Oops.

Dessert:  I got a plate with cutesy little slices of five different tarts:  Swiss, raspberry, lemon (with gold leaf!), ""snickers,"" and chocolate.  Really liked the Swiss and chocolate ones.  The other choice was five cutesy little scoops of gelato.  I had some of the pistachio, which my friend failed to finish.  It was amazing and sublimely pistachioey.

The meal also came with a large amount of bread and butter.  Wasn't a huge fan of the bread; it was in smallish, pointy rolls with a very high crust/inside ratio.  The butter, however, was amazing.

The whole process took us four hours, from 8pm to midnight, when we decided to hit the MGM penny slots.  We broke exactly even.

The bill for the six of us, including a $150 bottle of wine, was just over $1,000.  Putting it on my credit card was probably at least partly responsible for the credit line increase that I got the following month.

Overall, the food was excellent, but it wasn't *that* special.  For the most part, the service was very helpful, except for a couple of hitches with getting drinks and bread.

I liked that the ambiance was rather casual, considering the calibre of the restaurant.",AjU1dYlzNVi_GRiWthHjhg,0,0,4,l-RrtANMSC-RxdjYOmIBpA

This was our fourth meal here (I didn't write a review for our meal last year), but this time -- at least this *night* -- there were problems in paradise.  The kitchen seemed ""off,"" not in the quality of their food, but as in a perfectly tuned, high performance engine with a bad spark plug -- the well-timed, beautiful ballet of the kitchen staff was malfunctioning.  After placing our order for (roughly) 6-7 small plates, plus a main to be shared between the two of us, we waited some 20-25 minutes for the amuse bouche to arrive -- stunning though it was -- and then another 20 minutes for our first course.

The sommelier was also harried and somewhat irritated that I a) did not need his help, b) surprised him with the quality of my wine selections, and c) was out of one of my choices, and offered to substitute a lesser wine.  So he would frequently ignore us, prompting our waiter to pour the wine for us, as well as apologize to us for the delays/lack of pace from the kitchen.

This meal was decidedly out-of-character compared to our three previous experiences here, and while the food was excellent -- note:  one pasta dish was overly dense and chewy; a single disappointment in eight dishes -- our overall evening here was, for the first time, less than stellar.",BhwaJuqrwt_Stlf4XndzzQ,0,1,4,p_VRrqTwnZUU3qc55uQy5g

While the staff once we were seated were friendly and accommodating, we had an issue upon arrival. For a 10:45PM reservation on Saturday evening, I called at 10PM the second I landed at LAS to advise we were running just a few minutes behind schedule.

Highlights of the menu and what my fiance and I ordered were:

- Scallops carpaccio and uni:  Our favorite. We would go back simply to have this dish. The scallops were delicate and sliced perfectly. The uni really made the dish.

- Foie gras burger (sliders): Delicious. Would get this again! It's usually hard to find anything impressive about sliders but lamb + foie gras maybe key! 

- Foie gras stuffed-quail: Very good. Loved each aspect of the dish, the quail drumstick and the stuffed foie gras in the quail. Anything with mashed potatoes here is guaranteed to be a success. 

- La Framboise (aka The Surprise): Absolutely lovely and delightful. I'm usually not a fan of decadent chocolately desserts so I naturally gravitate towards fruit ones.

Me and my gal pals came here for dinner and invested about $750 to get one of the best meals of our lives...well at least we thought we were going to..

2 of us had the wine pairings with our meal.
Me and my friend who had the wine pairing got a bit tipsy around the middle of our meal...I guess the wine pairing wasn't such a good idea.

This isn't my every day type of food so I don't know the names of any of the dishes really...
Taste wise it was ok....but I don't remember anything that stood out in particular.
The much anticipated foie gras with quail egg was a bit of a disappointment.
Alot of the dishes served here was either room temp or cold.
I prefer hot dinners... guess I'm just too American like that.

We sat at the bar area, which I thought was nice at first b/c you get to see some chefs preparing certain dishes. But later I found it to be disturbing.
We had a chance to witness some of the pre-made mass productions going on, which was annoying to see..after all we were dropping some hefty dough and to think they weren't freshly prepared on the spot was a bit of a disappointment.
It was mostly with the colder dishes...and there were plenty throughout our prix fixe menu.

I wish the restaurant was a bit brighter so you can actually see your food.

Our Server was great and super cute!
The Sommelier was very helpful and tried to get the best pairings for us.

As a preface,I must say that I firmly believe that no matter how famous or accomplished a business/chef is, continued success must be based on customer satisfaction.
Unfortunately for my party, star french chef Hubert Keller was also dining at the restaurant with a small group that very same night.
The food and generally warm service was completely ruined by the pace of the meal and the excruciating wait between courses.
The restaurant was not particularly busy BTW. Mr. Moss, the Sommelier and manager, noticed the wait right after our first course and apologized. To make a long story short, we waited for so long in between courses that Mr. Moss comped us a bottle of champagne at the end of the night. He was extremely kind and professional. However, sadly, our night was ruined nonetheless.
Allow me to paint a picture, it was near 11pm and the restaurant was mostly empty, we have been waiting for dessert for 20 minutes and we see a procession of chefs come from the kitchen with all manner of dishes to please Mr. Keller while we just sat there. Disappointing and insulting.
Finally, we just got the check as we simply could not wait anymore. Our dessert arrived after the check. Additionally, I mentioned that I just just gotten married and we were celebrating this occasion. Not one mention of this was made by any of the service staff.ugh.

Ordered the assorted vegetables to share as a starter and a tasting of the seared duck foie gras and scallops with sea urchin for entree. First came the amuse bouche, foie gras with parmesan foam, subtle, mellow, delicious, and prepared us for the decadent meal ahead. The vegetables were lightly dressed with a citrus vinaigrette to underscore the freshness of the veggies, avocado, artichokes, radishes. Scallops were incredibly fresh, complementing the creamy and rich sea urchin perfectly, with a little chip (garlic maybe?) for texture. Foie gras was lightly seared, strong, flavorful, partnered with tangy cherries and sweet blueberries.

The atmosphere is wonderful. Usually I hate black and red but they decorated the restaurant very tastefully.

By far one of the cleanest kitchens I have ever seen. Also it assured you that they have nothing shady to hide. Plus: got to see a short French man with an angry face (aka executive chef) with his arms cross barking out orders in French. PRICELESS

As for the food. L'Atelier is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. You get to have the wonderful Joel Robuchon food without the over the top 3 hour dinner. I had the Foie Gras Burger and the Quail Stuffed with Foie Gras. Both were to die for. The burger was perfectly cooked and the foie gras did not overpower the meat. It was perfectly prepared. As for the quail, it was just pure PERFECTION!!! The quail was cooked perfectly and the foie gras once again highlighted the meat. I would highly recommend both.

note: If your meal does not come with the mashed potatoes ORDER IT!!!!!!! The best mashed potatoes ever!!!!!!!!!! TRUST ME!!!!! They are creamy and cheesy but not too heavy. Really hard to explain, It was just flat out delicious!!! My view of the mundane side dish has completely changed. I can not longer looked at mashed potatoes the same way anymore. 

dessert: The Raspberry Surprise was awesome!!! The tanginess of the yuzu ice cream and the raspberry sauce totally complimented the creaminess and the sweetness of the white chocolate sphere. It was well prepared and executed perfectly. When it comes to fine dining it all comes down to the execution. You can be as creative all you want, but if that sh*t doesn't come out right, then that is an automatic FAIL!!!!

We did pre theater, but ended up adding on a few more plates because it was so good. There was nothing out of about 10 dishes.. Both appetizers and meals that we all didn't love. It was so good, that we went to our show, and raced back after to see if would could be accommodated before closing to get dessert.. Which they gladly did... All of the desserts we got! Spectacular! Go go.. It's worth every penny! I have no doubt I will be back on my next Vegas trip",YgTkmLKcenD8CHKDYO0QLg,0,0,5,9ZgAa5RSUNPuOqwNzjee_A

For most of us this would be your splurge night. Expect the unexpected. Everything is a masterfully created surprise. All the food truly is as good as it gets and these are dishes that you'd never be able to duplicate at home.

They start everyone off with an amuse bouche, fresh baked breads and French butter. Everything I tried was very detailed, layered with many flavors and was just perfection. One of the small dishes that was very interesting was the L'Oeuf. I received a tiny soft fried quail egg topped with a nest of micro thin crisp noodles that sat over a detailed micro vegetable salad and house smoked salmon. Even the tiny greens seemed detailed like something was done to them. 

Everyone gets the signature Joel Robuchon Pommes Puree. I heard that they are about 1/2 fingerling potato and half butter. They do taste like more than that. I imagine a touch of egg and possibly a tiny touch of dijon. 

I always enjoy the Les Tartes. They are perfect little slices of heaven.

We were seated and asked what kind of water we wanted. Someone ordered some champagne and we started our experience. Unfortunately, there was a miscue after miscue.  The bread person didn't offer bread until we almost finished our 2nd champagne glass each.  We ordered the 4 courses but we didn't care for the soup so we opted for seafood. The first course was a crab/caviar dish. Delicious. The food experience was exceptional.  The chef is a genious. Unfortunately, the timing was out of pace. We got the first, second courses, waited a little more for 3rd course but the final dinner came later and it seemed they kept forgetting something that they went back to the kitchen 3x before serving it all to us.  My friends had the duck but one of them got it served cold.  They gave us some extra desserts because we were celebrating our friends 35th birthday.

If I don't think the food was worth the price tag, the rating goes down a little. So if you are not that type of person, then add one more star to this review.

2985274,2014-01-06,4,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I was excited to check this place out in my last day in Vegas from the high recommendations of the MGM staff, but disappointed to say I have to agree with all the other recent poor reviews.  I'm surprised this place is rated 4 1/2 stars on yelp.  One of the worst experiences I've had at a Michelin star place.  Just going through the other recent reviews, I get the feeling that something has changed for the worst at this place.  

After I ate, I was a little bit disappointed and as I was paying my bill, the couple next to me leaned over and ask ""what did you think?"".  To which I replied, ""ehh, it was ok"".  And they were in total agreement that this was just totally overpriced average food.  Just not worth the money.

To sum it all up for you
1) Unknowledgeable staff
2) Average Food
3) Total pretentiousness at the door

I went to make reservations and seeing the restaurant half empty, I was told there wasn't any available until an hour later.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the other guests were going to show up and say it's ok, put me down.  I come back an hour later and the place is still half empty and then greeted with a snooty comment by the manager asking the hostess ""does he even have a reservation?"".  

I ignore the comment and sit down, order my meal.  Asked for a few recommendations from the waiter, to which he replied that he didn't know anything about any of the things on the menu.  I felt like I was in Olive Garden asking the high school waiter.  REALLY??  So I picked a few choices.  

Had the Foie Gras, Crab Salad, Lobster bisque, Seabass and Mango Dessert.  You can't mess up Foie Gras.  It was good, not great.  I've had better salads at chain restaurants.  The lobster bisque wasn't bad but a little bitter and had pieces of the claws still in there.  Seabass was a little dry and overdone, but flavoring wasn't so terrible.  Mango dessert was also just ehh.  Just not what you would expect from a Michelin Star place.  

I wouldn't pay this amount of money for such poor service and such average food.  They also lose a star for the pretentiousness.

After I leave, I talk to a few other people at MGM.  I hear that Emeril or Craftwich is supposed to be better.",dfCv9fvs82uKOQDhsUGRFQ,5,0,1,uWKe9HmnBUKHb1kqSDiUaA

I ate dinner out by myself.

Solo diner. Party of one. The Japanese call this ""ohitori-sama"" - the honored single guest.

And it was great!

* Booking was easy - 7pm weekday reservation arranged a couple of days in advance.
* Warmly welcomed by the hostess.
* Incredibly friendly, low-key service. Somewhere in between an American bar and a French bistro.
* Outstanding food, which needs no further discussion here. For this Californian, though, foie gras (illegal back home, gah) was a standout with crispy seared surface.
* Surprisingly reasonably priced, considering Las Vegas. 4-course + amuse menu was $78; before 6:30pm there's also the quick pre-theatre menu for $48.
* Got half-bottles of Champagne & Chateauneuf du Pape for $88, which turned out better than ordering by the (relatively pricey) glasses. The fellow next to me ordered a whole Sancerre bottle for $40, well done.

I mean there is the Mansion by Joel Robuchon right next door. But let's talk about L'atelier for now.

When I first walked in I really didn't know what to expect. The kitchen is right dab in the middle of the restaurant. So my friends and I sat by the bar. Service was a complete 10/10. The waiters do not skip a beat. Everyone works together and food is up to the minute. I didn't know what to order really because I was knew to this whole fine dining experience. I just went with the Menu Decouverte. It was $135 and my knees were buckling BUT I can tell you this. I don't regret spending ONE RED CENT. So here is what I ordered:

for my L'amuse Bouche I had cucumber gelee with tarragon and cumin yogurt.

Blue Fin Tuna with tomato infused olive oil, scallops cooked in the shell with seaweed infused butter, egg cocotte with mushroom cream, light chestnut veloute with carmelized foie gras and crispy bacon, slightly smoked salmon with confit potatoes, free range quail stuffed with foie gras with Robuchon's infamous Pomme Puree (his version of mashed potatoes) They simply melt in your mouth and is the equivalent of eating butter and a Hanger steak with fried shallots.

for dessert.. i went with the sheep's milk yogurt panna cota.

For the best chef in the last decade? I definitely would make it a point to put this restaurant on your TO EAT list.",6wSlWIFwNR1Y0V-hH-wIAA,5,2,5,BB5m3axyR21IOXe3u5MHNw

finding it in the MGM was quite the fiasco just because it was me and my friend and we were already running late (as usual) and after just scoring a last minute reservation, we didn't want to push it even more.  after running through the casino in dresses and heels, we finally made it to this unexpectedly small restaurant that seated a majority of its occupants at 2 different counters: a main counter that faced the kitchen and a smaller bar area.  we were seated in the bar area so i kind of feel like we missed part of the show.  regardless, the food was amazing. now for the play by play:

the amuse bouche was very surprising..it was a type of melon jello/gel type thing with apples at the bottom and some creamy foam on top.  while it looked decently questionable, it was surprising fresh and definitely amused my bouche.

next, there was a seared pate du fois gras with a type of crisped cheese as well as a cooked hibiscus flower.  the pate was decently salty, which was wonderfully complimented by the crispiness of the cheese and then complimented by the sweetness of the flower.  after eating all of it together,  it was definitely something i have never tasted before but would love to taste again.

now my ... second favorite dish: a deep fried langoustine spring roll that came with a smattering of sweet chili sauce and some sort of green sauce (i forgot what exactly was in it) and it was so amazing. i definitely wanted more.

the best part -- i got the rib eye and my friend got the john dory fish filet.  i'm not a huge fish eater but her fish tasted very fresh and full with a bell pepper chutney and, a tomato sauce, and a dollop of mashed potatoes.  can't really attest too much for the fish, but i definitely can say that this was the best rib eye i've had in my life.  it was perfectly cooked and seriously only came with its own juices as its sauce and that's seriously all it needed.  cut so tender, it practically melted in my mouth. as full as i was from the other dishes, it was not hard at all for me to make room in my stomach for this beef.  it also came with a small pot of mashed potatoes and if i had to choose one food to eat before i die, i would want some of those mashed potatoes. they were wonderfully whipped and creamed and had a small taste of cheese and garlic in them. i'm wishing i got more now.

then the cheese plate.  i'm not a huge fan of cheese plates, but i can definitely appreciate a little bit here and there. i'm not going to pretend i know what i'm talking about when it comes to cheese, but according to my many friends who love cheese plates, the stinkier the better. and this cheese was stinky. so i'm assuming it was great.

finally, we each got a different dessert - a sorbet assortment as well as a small cake assortment.  the sorbets were great - flavors ranged from vanilla, chocolate, raspberry, pistachio, and strawberry.  the cakes were great...im unsure what flavors there were exactly, but one was a great lemon, a really dense and delicious chocolate, a fruit tarte, and a cinnamon cake.  

oh my goodness it was by far one of the best meals i've had in a long long time, definitely rivaling great restaurants like gary danko.  if you're in vegas and want an amaaaaazing meal, you definitely cannot go wrong with l'atelier.  

oh and the decor is great too...pretty dark, everything is black with red roses everywhere so it's cool too. but you barely notice it because the food is so great.",8OvOiyAMrjfIx5bmWNSCyA,1,0,5,DCZ4ZpSDL1AUe3KqL54Jow

When we found that the restaurant Joël Robuchon was fully booked,  L'Atelier was offered as an alternative so we took the reservation.

Now for having one Michelin star I was expecting a grand and decadent meal married with excellent service. Unfortunately, we didn't really get much of either. 

Our waiter was completely unrefined, too young and had no charisma. Our water glasses went empty several times and it took almost 10 minutes to get a simple ginger ale. 

We opted for the Le' Unique menu. I think this menu is a great idea because it is a chance to give people amazing food that doesn't cost a car payment. We simply chose it because it boasts ""served in 15 minutes"" and well, we had places to be.

As we sat at our counter seats we discussed the decor and how over-done displaying spices and peppers in fancy glass containers are. Although the color palette of striking red and black was sorta sexy, the whole place felt small, in a bad way, and felt flat.

Our dinners included crab for my fiance and pumpkin soup for me, hanger steak fricassee and a dessert. The soup was tasty but very thin, I excepted a pumpkin soup to be a little thicker and creamier. The fricassee was kind of laughable. I mean, the flavor was fine and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was pretty much a stir fry with a smear of mashed potatoes. I never expected to get THAT at a Michelin one-star place. The desserts, both of them, were forgettable.

Overall, a pretty lousy birthday dinner. Although I don't doubt the talents of Joël Robuchon, I would say skip this place and head next door or to David Burke at the Palazzo instead.",nYIH8IHzWp3j33L3qsAz5Q,1,0,3,RsMU5A-PEVmCx-gb7TKSnA

Langosten - Lovely, perfectly cooked, so tender and flavorful, lightly fried so the little crunch was great.

Food: The food is really nice and the presentation of food is very impressive. 

Service: I have mixed feelings about service. The service was generally good, but I was very disappointed with the service provided by the last waiter.... The first waiter was very attentive and did detailed explanation on each dish we have. Both my bf and I had the 9 courses holiday season  menu and we were not be able to finish it since we have very tiny stomaches. Maybe it is really awkward to ask for to go box in such high end restaurant but I hate wasting food. The last waiter was giving a mocking smile when we asked for it. He even did a terrible job for wrap up. I was very surprised when I opened the bag after I got back hotel. The sea bass was supposed to go with the porcini mousseline, but he didn't not pack it with the sea bass. It was grateful that the restaurant gave me birthday retreats. But where is the top of meringue??!! The beautiful floral presentation of cheesecake is also gone!!! Is a customer ask for to go box not deserve a respect?!! (With before and after pictures attached) 
Also, they only provide plastic box for such high end restaurant?! It is even worse than above average restaurants! They all provide better quality to go box which is microwaveable. Such a high end restaurant like Joel Roubuchon only provide normal plastic box?!! 
I am really surprised about the quality of service they provided since they are famous Michelin star restaurants! 

Environment: the decoration is beautiful, but the air was not very good! The cigarettes smell from the casino made me very uncomfortable! My eyes even started getting itchy becoz i was allergic to the smokes! If you are non smoker, you may want to consider this before making reservations.

This restaurant is in a class by itself.  I love their red roses that display everywhere, felt so romantic already when you just entered to the restaurant.    I've been to Joel Robuchon's when we traveled HongKong last year, both are very good, and this by far is my favorite one of his restaurants since it's both extra classy.

3071839,2011-09-18,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Perhaps the best meal of my life. We did the $155 tasting menu and it didn't disappoint. We started off with a grapefruit gelee and avocado amouse bouche and then the highlights of each mini course were: 

***The langoustine carpaccio blew me away. The way the lobster was thinly prepared, seasoned and the soft chewiness of it really brought the aroma of the lobster out. 

*** Les Tomatoes: The best tomato salad I have ever had. The simplicity of the fresh types of tomatoes, along with a little basil oil and fleur de sel were a heavenly transition from the amous bouche to the rest of the more entree' like dishes.

** Le Crabe royale: King crab a la plancha, vegetables with lemongrass oil: This dish was good, but didn't blow me away as much as the other dishes. It was well seasoned though, with an asian fusion flavor. 

** L'asperge : Green asparagus kebab with quail egg ""mirror"", shimeji and Iberico ham: This is like the ham and egg combo, the mini egg sitting perfectly sunny side up on top of the asparagus. Cute little dish, with many interesting flavors. 

***Main dishes: Lamb shoulder confit with eggplant compote and mashed potatoes: The lamb was delectable, moist and perfectly seasoned
        
 and also the Foie-gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes: I've never been a big fan of quail, but this quail, however small pieces, were really tasty and the foie gras complemented the quail taste very well.

Dessert: My hubby and I asked for one big main dessert instead of the two little ones that were on the menu. Our waiter hooked us up with one huge dessert that was the best chocolate coated and covered dessert I've ever tasted as well as the Pecan cake topped with fresh apples. 

We also watched as the lady next to us at the bar ordered a red ball with gold foil on top, with ice cream inside. After putting hot sauce over the whole thing, the sauce would melt the red ball to expose the creamy ice  cream inside. It looked delicious as well. 

We ended our meal with a nice hot cup of cappucino for me and a latte for my hubby. 

Overall, I would go to another Joel Robuchon restaurant again. Coming to this restaurant, made me a big fan of his cuisine. Worth every penny of it!",Uzcfz9lPWsy39OsO4mYSAg,1,3,5,qQCShMSpQ4c1yQp1pkdUJQ

The restaurant has a bit of a hip Asian feel in terms of the setup of the restaurant, in that it almost feels a bit like dining at a sushi counter. I enjoyed the counter dining experience which afforded the opportunity to see the chefs at work and witness small dramas play out in the rare situation where food is sent back to the kitchen. Thankfully we devoured every dish set in front of us.

We went for their seasonal tasting menu, which is a great value at $195. Every dish was thoughtfully constructed and beautifully executed. The flavours of every ingredient shines through each dish. My favourite dishes included the sea bass en croute, which was like having crackling on top of perfectly cooked sea bass atop a porcini cream and a bed of ginger butter cabbage. The semisoft boiled egg with pearl pasta risotto was unctuous and rich. The wagyu from Kagoshima (additional $55) was also rich, delicious and perfectly seasoned, and served with the creamiest richest mashed potatoes that I've ever tasted. My hubby's foie gras stuffed quail was tender and amazing in its flavours. The little beehive shaped lemon sorbet nougat semifreddo was as much a delight for the eyes as it was for my palate and had the perfect amount of sweetness. Le chocolat, our final course, consisted of hot chocolate poured over soft sponge cake and gingerbread ice cream. I could not help but roll my eyes in pleasure over the rich chocolate flavours and subtle spice in this dessert. 

The staff were engaging and it was lovely chatting with visiting members of Joel Robuchon's executive team about the similarities and differences between the various Atelier restaurants. I truly understand why Joel Robuchon has been named the Chef of the Century after this fabulous dining experience. My only critique comes from the fact that smoke from the casino wafts in and taints the experience of the food aromas. I realize this is not entirely the restaurant's fault but I would think glass doors at the entrance of the restaurant might help to keep unwelcome smoke from ruining an otherwise amazing dining experience. 4.8 stars!",EyYVD9n7PlYYLTSEQ5t14w,2,0,5,h5lbaHaXvLx8uqLHcrV5LQ

Each of the dishes was refined and outstanding. The portions are a perfect size.  Desert was perfect as well with the tart tray really blowing me away. Service was very good.

Although Joel Robuchon is not there every day (since he has to be all over the world overseeing his restaurant empire), he manages to keep the standards of his restaurants consistently good and high. Afterall, they call him Chef of the Century for a reason!

This particular location is mainly counter top seating which faces the kitchen, which is symbolic for what his L'Atelier restaurants represent: interaction between the diners and servers, while viewing the kitchen magic. They do, however, have about 4 regular tables but you would be missing out if you did not sit at the counter.

The atmosphere is trendy yet not stuffy. Men can either wear a blazer or just a dress shirt and they won't feel out of place.

The seared duck foie gras was soft and moist in the inside. The steak tartare was minced until very fine and the portion was way too much for me (and I'm a steak tartare fan). Halfway through it started to feel a little too rich for me though. However, the frites that came with the steak tartare was a very nice complement. The cold sliced veal was so tender to bite, it almost tricked us into thinking there was some pureeing going on in the veal but obviously that wasn't true. The suckling pig was also very delicious.

Definitely worth a visit to this 1 Michelin Star restaurant if you're looking for a gastronomic meal with a relaxed environment.",-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,0,0,5,YSJLZ9k9e7SF8u2uTFfU6g

I think the Waffle House steak for $9.95 had the same flavor as this cut of meat.  Definitely should have done the tenderloin!

Multi-course tasting menu with vegetarian option.  Vary accommodating to dietary restrictions.  Wine pairing available.

Ambiance:  Jazz music, red/black interior, comfortable seating, quiet noise level.  It's just off the gaming floor - so not really a white linen experience - more modern with a large dining bar that overlooks the open kitchen.  Tables to the side.

Service:  Attentive.  There are many options - tasting or ala carte.  Expensive food and wine alternatives.  I will say the waiter was very hard to understand, however, the service was good.

Wine:  Great wine selection at fairly high prices - as expected.  Solid recommendations.

Food:  This is what it's all about - excellent food and very accommodating to altering the tasting menu for like/dislikes.  We left full, but not stuffed.

Parking:  In the MGM lot for $10.  After dining and paying a small fortune they should validate.

  L'Atelier was where I chose to have my birthday dinner, and what an amazing dinner it was. I opted for the special prix fixe menu for restaurant week.
  
 - Course 1: gazpacho. Now, I'm not a huge fan of gazpacho, it's really just cold soup, right? Wrong. At L'Atelier, it's light and flavorful with great presentation.
 - Course 2: langoustine fritter with basil pesto. Great presentation and even better flavors. The wrapper was fried to a light, crispy perfection, and the langoustine was prepared simply enough to not detract from its natural flavors. The pesto was a great complement to the dish.
 - Course 3: Rib-eye with mashed potatoes. The presentation on this was so simple...literally just meat and potatoes, but wow, they were spectacularly done. It was a lesson in how simple food could be incredible--no foam, or extraneous garnishes to marr the plate or the tastes. The rib-eye was seasoned perfectly and incredibly tender. The potatoes had been whipped into submission with tons of butter and milk, but still had great texture.
  - *Bonus* Raspberry birthday tart: one of my dear friends informed that waitstaff that it was my birthday, and they brought out a beautiful raspberry tart with 'happy birthday' written on the plate and a candle. After my friends all sang to me, the waiter whisked it away and cut it into pieces and served it to everyone. It was simple but very good.
 - Course 4: soufflé with pistachio gelato.  It was served tableside with the gelato. It was very light, and the presence of egg whites was noticeable in the texture, but it paired very well with the gelato.
  The price of such a dining experience? $50.09. Quite a steal if you ask me.  They have several other prix fixe menus of different prices, so even if you don't come during restaurant week, you can still have a great meal without breaking the bank. Save that for gambling.",DBFRgbWy_BkLecLB8ydeqA,9,9,5,ORvuWVS1oCS0V5VTsV50QQ
3141260,2015-02-09,5,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"In terms of taste, this was probably the best meal we had in Vegas. But it really is a splurge. I wanted to try a bunch of dishes that weren't part of their choose your own set menu option, so we went a la carte.

*Chateauneuf-de-pape, paul jaboulet aine ""joel robuchon"", rhone valley, France, 2011 ($35 glass)
I just ordered this without looking at the price. Good glass of wine, but I'm not sure if I would have ordered it knowing how much it cost beforehand. Regardless, it was a nice glass of wine.

*Amuse bouche: Foie gras parfait
Yum! I got to eat two of them since the roommate doesn't like foie. Creamy and so good!

*Bread and butter
I normally don't eat bread and butter, but I had to try their freshly baked bread. Everything was light, fluffy and delicious. Even the butter was good!

*Le hamachi: yellowtail served as a ravioli with sea urchin in lemon vinaigrette ($40)
I love hamachi, uni and caviar. Roll it into a ""ravioli"" and I'm in heaven!

*Le jambon ""iberico de bellota"" ($40): ""iberico de bellota"" ham with toasted tomato bread
I never thought tomato bread would taste so good with jambon! It complemented the richness of the jambon well.

*La langoustine: langoustine a la plancha with green curry and cilantro ($23)
This dish was good, but I wasn't really blown away by it. The langoustine was perfectly cooked. Super tender!

*Le foie gras de carnard: Seared duck foie gras in a smoked sour-carrot bouillon, lemon confit ($35)
Their foie was seared to perfection. Still soft with the wonderful foie aroma and flavor. I loved this dish! And it was all mine!

*Le ris de veau ($30): veal sweetbread with fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce
Good. I wasn't expecting a huge piece of sweetbread, but it was cooked nicely.

*Le boeuf: beef grilled, served on a soft bed of rice and spiced avocado ($22)
This was good as well. Not exactly something I would normally order (since it has so much rice), but we wanted to order something with beef. The roommate enjoyed it. (He loves rice.)

We also got a small pot of mashed potatoes. I have no idea what that came with. Maybe the sweetbreads? But they were light, creamy and delicious!

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is dark, sexy and modern. Lots of black, red and dimly lit. If you have a party of two, you'll be sitting at the counter. I don't mind counter seating. And at times, I like seeing what's going on in the kitchen, but for a nice intimate dinner, it's hard doing that with counter seating. Plus, the couple next to us talked incessantly. And loudly. They really were enjoying their wine. That took away from my experience a little.

The next time I go to Vegas, I might just say screw it and go to Joel Robuchon. I liked the food, but I didn't care for the ambiance. If I'm gonna splurge, I might as well go big, right?",lLfcbYGTeVxQN5Ig0ompJg,8,5,4,cbf4t6u2_lWTVPSOtDmnrQ
3141673,2013-01-17,4,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I've struggled for a bit with how to rate this restaurant.  Based on all the spectacular reviews on Yelp, as well as the exorbitant prices and the reputation of the great Joel Robuchon, I was quite disappointed with my dinner here on Monday, January 14.

Neither my boyfriend and I have ever been here, so we tried the Menu B, which allows you to choose one out of the five following courses (http://mgmgrand.com/pdf/atelier_pre_fix_menu.pdf) at $105.00, and the featured Seasonal Menu with the Quail (http://mgmgrand.com/pdf/atelier_decouverte_menu.pdf - the one shown is different from what is offered now) at $159.00.

The Seasonal Menu is 4 stars on taste, though my boyfriend felt the price is a little on the expensive side for what we got.  We both had the same Amuse Bouche, which was a Foie Gras with a Parmesan Foam - the foam gave the right amount of lightness to the Foie Gras, which I've always found to be very rich.  Another standout is the scallop with chive oil and a bit of garnish.  The quail was also awesome.  Pretty much every course was very good, but the desserts were quite ordinary, though definitely above average.

I with my Menu B was not so lucky.  I think the issue I have is this restaurant's obsession with putting a lot of bells and whistles  on something that should be simplier.  For example, I had the Hamachi, which came with a delicious yellowtail atop a mountain of avocado dip-like thing and some mint!  Neither the avocado nor mint enhanced the yellowtail, which was the star of the dish, but rather obscured it with their weird flavors.

The lobster bisque was also very odd and not flavorful at all.  There were thin pieces of asparagus, but what I had an issue with was the broth was not savory, but oddly salty, foamy, without depth.  Robuchoun will be spitting on my picture when I say this, but I've had Trader Joe's bisque from a box, which was more delectable.  

For the fish I had a Chilean Sea Bass, which was nicely cooked, but again, its taste was obliterated and enhanced by some weird herbs.  The star of Menu B was the hanger steak, which was perfectly done with a lovely carmelized shallot on top.  (I had it medium rare.)  The dessert of panna cotta with ""corn ice cream"" had a few pieces of carmel popcorn thrown into it, which gave the dessert, which would've otherwise been very smooth, an odd crunchy and weird texture/flavor.

The cocktails - gin martini and the Pomme Brune - were delicious, but they must've come from the bowels of the MGM as our Amuse Bouche came before the cocktails.  At least 10 minutes had elapsed.  When I made a comment to the server (supposedly the bartender himself) that we were ""starving for alcohol"", there was no reaction.  In fact, the waitstaff, all dressed in black, acted as if we were dining in an ER, where one should be quiet and reserved.  The service seemed oddly joyless as my food.  All of the staff were professional, especially our counter server.  We weren't looking for, ""Are you done with that dessert, hon?  You want more water, sweety?"" type of service, but the staff seemed a little on the cool side.  Another Yelper had commented that the kitchen staff working never spoke to each other (they do), but now I can understand what she was referring to.  

The highlights of the evening was the bread, which was delicious...and they give you unlimited bread...which we took, with wanton abandon.  I suppose the Sous Chef, a Frenchman, came around and gave us more mashed potato - which is more like melted butter with a bit of potato thrown in.  That, plus the bread and the slow-moving cocktails were what made the evening for me.  

My boyfriend (who did not pay for the meal) is more up in arms about the entire experience than I am.  (He asked for 3 baskets of bread, till I threatened to break up with him.)  We do not feel that the high prices were justified.  On the other hand, a couple next to us - a French couple - drove all the way from Scottsdale to the restaurant for the meal.  Of course, they ordered a la carte, and their food looked and smelled delicious.  Unfortunately, at the high price tag, I'll not be going back to try the restaurant anytime soon.",QfGuimcRALWB6WiRtXXJ2w,9,4,2,dzKDxfqVuxgY84WNjk39ug

There are very few actual tables in the restaurant, but it's not that big of a deal because you end up being mesmerized by the food and the fact that you watch everything being prepared.  We thought about the pre fixed menu, but ended ordering off of the regular a la carte menu, and it was amazing.  They started us off with an amuse-bouche, which was a shot glass of foie gras with a balsamic reduction and a parmesan foam on top.  I could've eaten my weight in those.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about them.  Then, we had their ""LE JAMBON"" of Prosciutto with toasted tomato bread.  Seriously--freaking awesome!   Also had a salad of iceberg lettuce in the shape of a flower covered with lobster and a lemon vinagrette, sea bass over leeks, and free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and truffled-mashed potatoes, and their chocolate sensation.

We opted for a la carte items and were very satisfied with our choices.

Started off with an amuse buche of foie gras with cheese foam in a shooter glass. Effen amazing! I never knew foie gras could taste so good. 

Foie gras ravioli in warm chicken broth with herbs was my favorite dish of the evening. Tiny pockets of delightfulness all wrapped up. OMFG. I am still dreaming of them. 

Maine lobster in spicy broth shaved lime and corn was delicious as well. I liked the kick it had, but then again I like most of my food fiery. This was my BF's fave dish.

L'Atelier style spaghetti was up next and it was quite filling. This was basically spaghetti carbonara and it was creamy, yet not overpowering. I also like the tiny pieces of ham. Very tasty indeed. 

I chose the salmon with crispy potatoes and a side of mashed potatoes for my entree. It was good, but didn't really stand out as the best salmon ever. However, the mashed potatoes were so buttery every single bite I took made me feel my heart thump harder. It's all good, the BF polished them off for me.

He had the foie gras stuffed quail and truffle mashed potatoes and boy was that heavenly! The quail had such great flavor and seriously melted in my mouth. Wow. 

We had 2 glasses each of the German Riesling. Very good as well.

The table setting was nicely presented and the silverware was also clean. The hostess and waiter were polite but also prompt in seating while bringing us our menus and bread basket for the table. Immediately the biggest distraction was the location of the restaurant inside of the casino; what I mean is that the entrance to the restaurant was in clear view of a high traffic area for the casino, the windows were not covered for privacy and the door was left open the entire time. This disturbs the ambiance of the dining experience as you have distracting noise from the casino floor, casino traffic passing by the entire time and the additional sites and sounds. The windows should have been covered completely with shades and the main door shut to provide a sense of seclusion and help set the mood for a great dining experience. Small notes are the table pepper had absolutely no pepper in it and while I did like the chairs I am not too fond of the low back support style they had. Food delivery was good and prompt. presentation was good and the time it took them to clear the table was also prompt. I was not a fan of all the food we ordered.

The restaurant layout is really cool - it's almost all bar seating, with great views of the open kitchen and all of the different prep stations.

We tried the A and B prix fixe menus, which let us select 2 appetizers, 1 (A) or 2 (B) main courses, and a dessert.  I was pretty happy with this route - we had plenty of food and were able to try a wide variety of dishes.

All of the food was outstanding.  For our appetizers we went with the La Dorade Royale (king snapper cerviche) x2, L'oeuf De Poule (soft fried egg with smoked salmon) and L'ongnon (onion soup).  The standout for me was definitely the smoked salmon, which came with a surprisingly large amount of salmon, accompanied by the perfectly cooked egg.  The mains we had were salmon, duck, and pork dishes.  My favorite was the salmon, but the others were no slouches - the duck was juicy, and the pork was tasty too.  For dessert we both went with a selection of tarts, which was a great way to end the meal.

Well, they actually charged me for an extra item, so i overpaid 31 dollars. One of the items was on a separate page, the waiter said I could use that item for one of the 3, but then he charged me extra for it. But whatever.

They were out of the wine I prefer, the Schaefer. So I tried one half the price, and it was no good. The vegetarian fare was boring, everything had a ton of butter. Even their vegetable stock was infused with butter.

Out of all the fine dining options in Vegas available, we choose L'Atelier because we were catching Ka (a Cirque show).  We wanted to be close to our show so we don't have to deal with Vegas car and pedestrian traffic (highly recommended to do so).

Our show starts at 7 pm and we booked the first available dinner reservations for our group of six at 530 pm.  The restaurant was modern, black with red accents - very sexy and seductive.  Without prompting, the waiter asked if we have a show scheduled for later in the evening (we did at 7 pm) before continuing to recommend certain features on the menu for us (no 5 or 10 course tasting menu).  

I scanned the 4 course tasting menu briefly ($78) and asked the waiter to surprise me with the chef's recommendation for each course.  There is no set wine pairing for the 4 course tasting menu so I asked for recommendations.

Food:
Complimentary dish from the chef - foie gras, parmesan cheese and brandy reduction.
First course - L'HAMACHI en tartare aux sucs de tomate pimentée (Yellowtail tuna tartar with spicy tomato coulis)
Second course - LE HOMARD, bisque onctueuse aux petits pois croquants (Losbster bisque with crunchy green peas)
Third course - Not on their menu to copy and paste (damn).  Pork belly with glazed onion and roasted garlic.
Fourth course - LES TARTES de tradition (Traditional tarts)

Wine:
First glass - I was recommended a clean vouvray with no after taste.  It was VERY smooth and is a generally a good food wine.
Second glass - Reisling to specifically pair with the pork belly and dessert.

Everything was delicious.  The combination of flavors when each bite has every component of the dish was phenomenal.  This restaurant, although pricey (as most fine dining experiences on the strip), is highly recommended for the food, excellent service and great wine pairing.

We finished our last bite of dessert literally minutes before the show and walked over to our seats in no time.

TIP:  The restroom in the restaurant is a single stall restroom and I did not notice any additional restrooms in the casino nearby the show.  Granted we were a little rushed and the show did not have an intermission for me to explore but just in case this is true. . .

This place rocks simply because it's trendy and tries to be accessible even though it is fine dining at its best.  Definitely get a counter seat so you can watch the chefs prepare the dishes.  The detail that goes into each dish is amazing.

I enjoyed the tasting menu and a few a la carte dishes as well.  The sliders w/ foie gras were excellent.  Wait, Virgina Y. only gave it 4 stars?  That's because you weren't sitting next to me girl.  :)

In the end, we decided to just drop by and beg for a table for 2. Guess what, we got a dinner reservation with only 4 hours' notice! You simply have to walk into the main Robuchon restaurant and talk to the hostess. Eating here made my entire Vegas trip, again!

This time around (it's been exactly a year since our last visit), the menu hadn't changed much, but everything is worth eating over and over. We started off with a warm foie gras mousse with port wine reduction and parmesan foam. After the numbnuts banned foie gras in California, this was a much-savored amuse-bouche! We also had great dishes like the melt-in-your-mouth sweetbreads, foie gras & beef burgers, foie gras-stuffed quail, and the langoustine. 

Our waiter was amazingly good! Attentive and super generous in packing us extra bread to take back to our room. I think the food and atmosphere are better here than at The French Laundry. And it's about one-third the price. Sorry, Mr. Keller.",SYvU41T1jLm9YO-1lZxGPA,0,1,5,yNfngxA2OmPHCJuH2RmkVw

If they have Dover sole we always order it -- the absolute best sole meuniere we have ever had. We always request seats on the counter in Joe's section, order a bottle of Champagne and settle in.

I have flown to Vegas to eat at the fine dining restaurant - certainly the sister restaurant, while not as fancy, would be great, right?  They share the kitchen for many things...

I have to say the dinner exceeded my expectations.  Exceeded.

The way I look at the gastronomic world, five stars is either ""The best _____ you can get"" or ""Unique dishes and combinations, executed wonderfully'.

This is the second version.  Veal, Duck, Asparagas, Foie Gras, Truffles, Fish of several kinds, Mushrooms, more.  All delectable, unique and perfectly done.  Eating this food, you understand why they like to capitalize the names (they don't serve duck, they serve Duck).

The portions and the pace were great, and we have a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  The food was incredible.

My final recommendation - there have several menus of varying numbers of courses.  Get more!  While we didn't try the tasting menu (the party didn't want to as a whole), we picked the most number of courses outside of it because you want to, should and must try as many different dishes when you go to a restaurant of this caliber.

Sharing tastes from your companion's plates also highly encouraged.

Overall, the experience was wonderful.  We had two seats on the side of the bar, which gave us a perfect view of the kitchen, including the Executive Chef, Steve Benjamin, banging on the bell when food is ready to be served, servers slicing beautiful pieces of Jamon Iberico from the stunning leg displayed on the side, and the different chefs preparing our food right before our eyes.  What's great too, is you can see if any delays are due to the kitchen or our server.  For us, it was our server Eric.  At one point Executive Chef Benjamin came over to serve one of our dishes and the head sommelier came to pour our wine since our server was MIA.  He was incredibly nice, but apparently a bit inept.  There was also the incident when he dropped a glass and a shard of it came my way...but, then again, he neglected to charge me the $30 surcharge for caviar, so all is forgiven =)

Food and Drinks:
We ordered a bottle of Veuve Yellow Label to go with the early dishes of the Discovery Menu ($175) and a wonderful Saint-Emilion Bordeaux to match up with the later dishes.
-Amuse Bouche: Foie Gras Parfait with port wine and parmesan foam;  Intense, amazing flavors.  So rich and well-balanced.  Perfect match with the champagne.
-Langoustine Carpaccio with toasted poppy seed dressing; the dressing was made of an exquisite olive oil, poppy seeds, a bit of pepper, and fleur de sel.  This was one of the best dishes! And, it was served to us and explained to us by Executive Chef Benjamin.  
-Poached Baby Kushi Oysters served with French Butter and the caviar supplement.  The oysters were so rich and flavorful; i've never had cooked oysters before. The slight poaching brings out the oyster flavor, as did the osetra caviar.  There was an oceanic explosion in my mouth as I sampled that with the champagne!  
-Steamed Egg in a Macaroni Ring with Black Truffles; This was my least favorite dish, although the flavors were good.  The egg yolk mixed nicely with the macaroni ring and the (very large!) black truffle shavings added nice depth.
-Teppanyaki Duck Foie Gras with quince confit and yuzu; so rich, so perfectly prepared!  Again, a perfect match with the champagne.  It was so excellent but so rich, that I couldn't finish it all.
-Dover Sole Filet prepared with Baby Leeks, crispy onions, and ginger.  The name of this dish is misleading.  I truly believe there were three full filets of Sole on the plate.  This dish easily was NOT a tasting portion and, sadly, was not finished.  It was very well prepared, with good structure and heartiness.
-Here the hubby and I each got a different dish so we could taste each one; Venison with sweet and sour cranberry and chestnuts; served with the house specialty truffle mashed potatoes.  The Venison was divine.  It was one of my favorite things all night; perfectly prepared at medium-rare. I would want a whole dish of this. And, we had the Foie Gras stuffed free-range quail, also with truffle mashed potatoes.  The combination of the quail and foie gras was awesome.  The crispy skin on the quail balanced out the richness of the foie gras.  The nutty flavor of the truffles in the mashed potatoes was excellent.
**I will say that, although I love Foie Gras, I'm surprised Chef Robuchon went the route of obsessing over the dish.
Two desserts:
-Hazelnut and Gianduja Crunch/Tart with Chocolate Ice Cream. Heaven on a plate. Rich, crispy, smooth. Thank you sir, may I have another?
-Fresh Passion fruit in a coconut meringue; a nice palate cleanser; The combo of the crispy meringue with the passion fruit was nice. Compared to the previous dessert though, this paled in flavor and creativity.


OMG. Somehow we ate most of this stuff.  Our palates were pleased, our bellies were full, our evening was lovely.  If I ran this restaurant, I would seriously petition Michelin for a bump from one star to two.  Perhaps it's the ""casual"" eating environment that stops them from granting L'Atelier two Michelin stars, but this place, to me, surpasses Picasso and is on equal footing with Alex as far as food goes.  It's not cheap, so don't go there and be cheap.  Order the good stuff, not the $39 menu, and you won't be disappointed.

I think next time we might visit Mr. Robuchon next door, although I will miss Executive Chef Benjamin banging away on the bell!!!",-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw,7,7,5,igmQkV-awEDbgpc9BoAVvw

3228702,2009-03-24,5,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"First off, I'm not one of those two star reviewers. You know the kind: ""It cost so much!"" ""I don't get the food, I like hamburgers."" ""This place is too fancy, so here's your one star."" That's not me. I am a foodie. Check my other reviews for proof. So, given this disclaimer here's my two cents on L'Atlier...

One word: 
Half-assed.

Pre-game:
Our group of nine ate here this last weekend. I made reservations in advance. They required a $75 reservation fee (non-refundable and not applied to the meal) . That's a first. And because we were a large group we were limited to tasting menus only. Fine. Ain't no thing - this place is #2 on Yelp. I'm excited! I love food!

The experience:
We were smashed into the wall. There was not enough room to get into our seats. Once the table was moved so all the ladies, in their lovely dresses, could shimmy in, they were trapped - the whole meal - full bladders and all. The service sucked. They already had their guaranteed 20% gratuity (because of our party size). So, we endured a meal full of empty glasses, missing silverware, and a wonky table.

The Food:
Average. We had two vegetarians with us (the restaurant knew about this ahead of time) and when the amuse arrived they were served foie gras mouse. You can't take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter? Two of the courses (in a row) had the same pesto sauce. Not a big deal, but the primary components were so bland all you could taste was pesto. ""Sir, for your fist and second courses this evening you will be having pesto."" Come-on! Most of the dishes were one note. In general the meal was uninspired. 

In summary:
We left disappointed. Michelin should revoke their one star. I know it's harsh, but it's truth. Do you hear me, Bibendum?",mm1vKs4reQSASYteOShvJQ,9,1,2,2YvGeA7jRUQSif6yZ8azqw
3232117,2011-05-02,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on Saturday and the decor and open kitchen floor plan is OBVIOUSLY 5 stars. It's was gorgeous, unique, modern, and a fun, new interesting experience. Our server was so friendly and warm and kept us entertained.

We had the 5 course tasting menu for $95 each, and I have to say, I was a little disappointed. BUT disclaimer: I think French food is an acquired taste and I definitely was not used to it because I thought it was extremely rich and heavy, and I felt a little sick after my meal. Embarrassing but my stomach was not too happy with me after dinner.

One of the dishes, I couldn't even finish cause I started getting a headache, but our server was so polite and asked why I didn't finish and when I had told him, he offered to make me another dish to make up for it...and now THAT IS a 5-STAR service. Except, BECAUSE of the open kitchen, I saw him tell the chef that was there, and he made the most disgusted/shocked expression and I was honestly a little intimidated. But he did create another dish for me, which was delicious and less rich.

I LOVE cheese and I wasn't too impressed with the cheese plate, but like I said, I think everything on the menu is a very acquired taste like goat cheese. Not a fan of goat cheese, never have and probably never will, but a lot of people LOVE it.

Our server and maybe the manager? that was walking around and greeting guests even joked around with us which was awesome and made our dinner fun.

So I think service and decor is definitely 5 stars, but the food wasn't my cup of tea, so I'm knocking off a star. Definitely giving you a fair warning if you eat pretty healthy and lean everyday, prepare for a buttery, rich meal. Maybe it was the choice of the 5 course menu that was rich? I would definitely try something else if I came back!",Zme22tWF1A8dUb2taAiT4Q,0,0,4,03wr4X8tJmSPTD5sjQI5hw

Also be careful when being asked if you want wine. I deferred to my date who chose champagne at his suggestion. I was planning on ordering an old fashioned. As I was on my phone however he filled my glass with wine as well.

3270982,2011-07-13,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"After seeing most of the reviews, we were thought that the portions would be teeny tiny, but boy were we wrong.  We totally over-ordered, but we loved everything and I would definitely go back (but probably order a little less next time).

For our party of 4, we ordered 2 club menus (5 course tasting menu) and 8 a la carte dishes...I was glad they let us mix it up so we can have more variety.  I thought the a la carte dishes would be tasting portions, but they were much larger than I expected (more like the size of a typical appetizer course of a 3-course menu).  The portions were very generous on the 5-course menus as well.

We started off with an amuse-bouche of some sort of avocado soup...very refreshing.  The 3-bread selection was great (I can only imagine what it must be like next door with 20+ choices!)...all were good but my favorite was the baguette.

Our a la carte dishes included LE FOIE GRAS (both the terrine and the seared), 2 orders of LE BURGER (beef & foie gras burger), 2 orders of LA CAILLE (quail stuffed with foie gras), so yeah, I think we went a bit overboard with the foie gras. :)  On top of that, we ordered LE RIS DE VEAU (veal sweetbreads) and LE COCHON de lait (suckling pig).  I don't think I've had a more decadent meal (well, maybe that time I had caviar and 5 cheeses for breakfast came close).  Needless to say, all were amazing, but the best dishes had to be the burger and the pig.  If I could do it over we probably could have ordered one less quail dish and picked only one of the foie gras courses.

The club menu included a tomato gazpacho soup, followed by the langoustine.  Then there was a choice of the john dory or the veal (we got both).  Everything was great, though overall I was more impressed by the a la carte dishes.  What was really surprising was that the cheese selection actually came with 3 decent-sized portions (~1oz each) of different cheeses.  After that, LES TARTES had 5(!) different kinds of little cakes.  Needless to say, we were totally stuffed at the end, even after stuffing the hard cheeses in our purses for later (came in handy at 2am) :)

Almost all of the wines were over $100, but we were able to find a few that were less.  The first bottle we got, an Hermitage, was pretty decent...the second, a Burgundy was a little meh (but then it was one of the cheapest on the list...didn't want to pay too much for a second bottle).  The ambiance and service was good and we enjoyed seeing all the cooking on the other side of the counter.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get the Robuchon experience but doesn't want to shell out the really big bucks for the restaurant next door (maybe someday...).",R5i-8R4vBov0wfNBGg2MwA,0,0,5,UwQwmgJwHmfDlD9HpuM1UA

This was my take on the restaurant. This was the first Michelin star related restaurant that both my husband and I have been to (we are from Indiana) I think we survived but the wait staff probably thought we were clueless trash. It made the whole thing a bit awkward. We were seated at the bar next to the most obnoxious people. They kept going on about what ""in restaurants"" they were going to and mispronouncing the names. The dated decor on top of that really killed our vibe with the ambience. 

Overall my favorites were: the butter (that came with the bread-don't judge that was the best butter I have had), coffee Chantilly, mashed potatoes, and the avocado tarte (the menu has changed since I was there so I'm unable to reference the exact title.

We came here with a friend and restaurant owner who was tasting the menu for both personal and business purposes. My friend and I were privileged to accompany him. He ordered the 5 chef recommended items, among many others. 3 bottles of wine later and a whole lot of empty dishes, I left feeling awakened from the tastes yet sleepy from the food coma. The staff was witty, engaging and hilarious. I made friends with the head chef. I also happened to be seated by a beautiful women whose birthday it was, also the wife of the GM. I walked into this restaurant unsuspecting of the memories I'll carry for the rest of my life and the new friendships I'd form. It'd be impossible to have made this experience any better than it was. I will take you on the delicious journey in the exact order it was brought to us, as intended by the chef.

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE
First a gray stone medallion was placed in front of me, followed by a shot glass size of two visible layers of red and green adorned with vegetables atop. When you take the spoon full we were directed to get to the very bottom to ensure full flavor explosion, and it was exactly that. A perfect dish to 'clean the palate' as we were informed! 

LE JAMBON
Presentation very much like a small bruschetta, yet far surpassing any overly-balsamic-vinigar-soaked-tomato-experiece. The bread was the perfect thickness, toasted and topped with the freshest tomato's seasoned to supplement but not cover their natural taste. Topped with 3 small basil leaves it's delicious! I loved that the one ingredient didn't stick out more than the other, they blended seamlessly. 

JAMBON IBERICO
First off the way they displayed the leg could be unnerving to others and appreciated by the rest. Rested vertically on a spectacular silver holder, it looked more like an art piece than kitchen gear. Here they individually (and patiently) hand slice each piece with a dangerously sharp knife. The pieces were cut at the perfect thickness and marbled with a balanced amount of fat. The pig was raised on hazelnuts and man-oh-man, I'm so grateful for that. 

LES ANCHOIS
Loved the presentation of this dish. A simple small rectangle stripped with anchovies and eggplant topped with seasoning in a diagonal fashion. Great taste as well with a medium texture consistency for those worried about fishy mush. Delicious!

LE FOIE GRAS
The perfect medalion of a foie gras. Served with bread, seasoned perfectly, chilled and eaten happily. 

LE SAUMON FUME
More hearty than the other dishes, great taste and unique combo!

L'ARTICHAUT
Artichoke heart filled with king crab and vegetables on top? YES please! A bit more bland on the flavors but very needed to transition the other vibrant dishes.

LES HUITRES
This was my first experience with Oyster shooters (and baby ones at that, gosh I'm a jerk) ... I've always been very hesitant to shoot down (what I thought) would be a slimy, gritty hunk of the ocean. On the contrary, it was amazing. I grabbed my steak knife to prepare for battle over the awkward extra one sitting there after my group grabbed their designated babe of an oyster. Not at all slimy and whole lot of delicate flavors combining together for a small, lustful fling with your taste buds. I'm not going to fool myself though, I'm positive any other oyster shooter experience will leave me with my first fears confirmed, L'atelier really prepared this attentively and perfectly.

L'ASPERGE
Holy shit. Let's talk about a dance party in your mouth where everyone's gettin' down. The Asparagus is inside of a large macaroni tube and the cheese melted over is heaven, added with the light-flavorful-savory smoke veal bacon ... my taste buds were awakened like a sinners first day in church.

LE CÉLERI
I'm still trying to gather my thoughts about this dish. There were a lot of things going on once I took a spoon full. First thing I noticed was the cool temperature, then the celery flavor came through in full force, the wasabi was settle yet a great addition, next up for the taste buds was the beef stew gelee at a pretty unique consistency. I'm happy to have tried this dish but I probably wont be ordering it next month when I visit again. I do recommend expanding your horizons and trying this, a dish that leaves you battling the everyday frequents is refreshing. 

LA SOLE
Tender, flaky sole with light oil and succulent seasonings. When you take a bit with the baby leek and ginger it's divine. 

LA HAMPE
This dish lasted about 45 seconds in front of us. The meat was so damn tender and flavorful! Peeeerfectly mmmmm. Nom nom nom.

L'ONGLET
Beef tartar... I would have never thought I'd try, ever. Surprisingly delicious and not at all nightmare causing as I feared. 

LE CHOCOLAT
Oh you perfect, perfect chocolatey oreo crumbled heaven. Paired with a desert wine I was on cloud9.

LE CAFE

3288222,2015-11-07,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Let me first start off by saying I did quite a bit of research before choosing this restaurant, as there is no shortage of phenomenal dining options to be had in Vegas. Based off reviews and expecting to have an amazing experience, I made the reservation a month ahead of time and specifically asked for a good seat  at the bar to have a great view of the chefs cooking in the open kitchen. (When I called to confirm the reservation earlier in the day of our arrival, it was also reiterated by the reservation desk that I had made the request for a central view of the kitchen.) We arrived at 8:10, about 20 minutes early and the restaurant was only about half full so the hostess said we could be seated early. She proceeded to seat us in the farthest most possible seat in the corner of the bar, the worst seat in the house. I didn't complain because  were being accommodated by being sat early.  

Next we ordered a couple of pear signature cocktails which were good. My friend ordered a second and it took over 20 minutes to arrive, Again, the restaurant was HALF full. When we were trying to decipher the rather complicated menu the waiter was patient and did explain the dishes, and mentioned a spaghetti special that they were featuring that night. He never once mentioned the price of said spaghetti special, which was a very simple cream sauce with egg and shaved truffle sauce. I opted for the special and the langoustine fritters.  My friend ordered the pork chop appetizer and the sea bass.  The sommelier came over and was not very friendly and kept pushing a special wine by the glass, which was $65 a glass. I told him I wanted to look at the other available whites and again he pushed a second $65 per glass white. I felt rushed and pressured since he kept saying it was a great pairing with the truffle dish I had ordered. I relented - The pour was extremely stingy and didn't seem anywhere near a full pour especially since the bottle was almost empty, I would have expected him to just finish off the bottle with my pour. Disappointing. 

Then things really start going downhill when our waiter after waiting an excruciating long time brings my friend the wrong entrée. She ordered the pork chops and got stuffed quail. After waiting another 20 minutes for the waiter to correct that mistake, meanwhile my fritters sat cold. I felt it was extremely rude to serve my food while my friend sat empty for 20 minutes. Then the waiter brings back the quail dish after about 10 minutes and says do you want this while you wait for the pork chops?  Why didn't he offer it up when it first came, instead taking it away to sit and get cold then bringing it back as an afterthought?  Then finally my spaghetti arrives, nothing special whatsoever. At this point I just wanted to finish the meal and leave. My friend and I almost fell out of our chairs when the bill arrived and we saw I was charged $150 for the spaghetti dish.  Really??  Can you say the utmost insulting and ridiculous charge I have ever encountered in my life.  The serving was small and was something I could have made at home. The night before we ate at Michal Mina in the Bellagio which is my staple go-to all-time favorite restaurant. Joel Robuchon should take a page out of his book. It's a truly a well-oiled machine, never skipping a beat and always consistent amazing service. Our experience at JR can only be described as a train wreck with sloppy poor service and the worst over-charging I have ever encountered. Chefs were just standing around and dishwashers were constantly putting glasses away that were right smack in front of us. I will never return to any JR restaurant as this was extremely disappointing for the caliber of dining experience you expect in Vegas.",PWqd12FlOw9IO1MAoDHaoA,1,0,1,XSa7IA1WWBgZtYfCG7SMrQ
3301466,2010-05-07,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Took my father here for his birthday and it was quite the experience.  L'atelier is famous for its open kitchen.  They give their guests the option of sitting at the bar where they can overlook the open kitchen and watch all the chefs cooking their food.  My father and I each ordered the Discovery Menu for $168.  Seems a little pricey for a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but hey...it is JR.

The Discovery Menu consisted of 10 courses (including coffee).  There was a lot of foie gras in the menu that evening and my cholesterol level felt like it was going to rocket out of the building after the meal.  But the foie gras was cooked very well and full of flavor.  I was very impressed with the Langoustine carpaccio.  It was my first time having Langoustine and I really enjoyed it with the combination of spices.  The Dover sole filet wasn't anything too special though.

We also shared an order of the le'burger, L'atelier's signature burger.  It consisted of a kobe beef patty with foie gras and WOW was that delicious.  The best burger I have ever had, I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who visits L'atelier.

The service was also very good and attentive here.  Always making sure we didn't have an empty glass of water and the waiters are were very willing to make small talk.  Seeing that it was my father's birthday, at the end of the meal they presented us with a selection of 6 different kinds of dessert cakes, all of which were delicious.

The price is what stopped me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, but my father and I still enjoyed our meal very much.",BVVviud0RtPevW6Jb-h5Lw,1,0,4,2XMQiopHH8yckZTRe0qq-w

First, thanks to Joe, his fellow servers, and Rafael the sommelier, for their excellent suggestions and friendly service.  They manage to create a comfortable environment of expectant expectation, reinforced by the ""front row seat"" to culinary master chefs creating each and every plate with artistic precision.

We started with martini's and the Iberico Ham with tomato toast.  It was unique, delicious and beautifully presented.  We followed with the ""lobster salad"" a very generous portion of perfectly cooked lobster, served on a round of iceberg lettuce, both deliciously dressed with sherry vinaigrette.

By far if I had to rate them, Monaco is the best by a long shot. I would have liked to try the JR next door to the L'Atelier here at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, but we got into L'Atelier for the amount of foie gras dishes offered.  I didn't personally try the foie dishes, but from someone who knows her foie, it was a ""so-so"" experience...which is a bit disappointing.  I personally can vouch for the items I had...here were the highlights:
- Got fixed meal for $81 (2 apps, entrée, dessert)
- Snapper Carpaccio: Excellent...light, fruity (lemon), fresh and bright.  Microgreens and flowers gave it a bit of texture contrast to the soft ceviche style fish.
- Veal Gyoza:  Good, but not as good as the snapper appetizer
- Spicy Lobster w/ Orichette Pasta:  Good, not too spicy, very rich cream sauce, big chunks of fresh lobster, pasta cooked to perfection and perfect vehicle to carry rich sauce
- Dessert: Tart sampler....well worth it!  Cinnamon (Swiss Tart), Raspberry, Apple, Snickers...and oh-soooo worth every bite!
Now for the points of improvement...
- Service: Good for a regular casino restaurant...but underpar for a JR restaurant.  I was never asked if I had any dietary restrictions/concerns when we got the prix fixe (and Monaco and London staff DID ask that).  Waiter came by less than the other restaurant staffs did to check on us (although he did stop by at least 2 times to get us water).
- Ambience:  Noisy...but not necessarily their fault....MGM had a huge rodeo event going on outside the restaurant and even though they closed the glass door, you could hear the loud concert going on during the dinner hours. I blame this on MGM not space planning well considering they knew TWO high end restaurants were right next to where they set a BIG concert stage in the open area.
- Food Quality: I thought my meals were good, but surprised that foie gras was not as generous portion as Monaco nor as good quality.  (As my companion noted, it was likely Canadian foie - not French foie).",J2W5pb0_300Gmy-W7gZz6w,1,1,3,QTWMbMA65EQr9sZYI2axSA

For desert we had La Pomme, which was fantastic

In many ways this restaurant epitomizes everything wrong with Vegas dining.  The waiter felt obliged to tell us that the steak tartare was raw.  The couple next to us spent a lot of time photographing their food and ours.  Robuchon wandered through the restaurant whereupon he was fawned upon by several diners.

The restaurant is modern-cozy, mostly red with dark low lights.  There are many small tables on the side and a large bar area with an open kitchen.  You can see the whole kitchen and the entire scope of preparation.  Sitting at the bar is an experience in it self, let alone eating there.

Unfortunately, I was alone for dinner, but then it made perfect sense to seat me at the bar.  It was the greatest experience watching the plates be finished, a meticulous process that took 5 minutes just to garnish the plates just so.  I just love watching excellence in action.

I had a small plate of smoked salmon on creme fraiche as a starter and then John Dorry with chorizo as a main dish.  It was served with a small pot of pureed potatoes that I will never forget.  They were so smooth, so creamy.  My server conspiratorially whispered to me were at least half butter and I could believe that.

Sitting by myself at the bar, I wasn't alone.  There was a journalist (from the same convention) on one side and a young female doctor on the other.  We made small conversation and were shared our amazement of the food.

I had three pots de creme for dessert that were wonderful.

As with most of those dining here, we were seated at the counter.  Some people seem a little put-off by this, but I thought it was really fun to dine this way and see everything going on in the kitchen.  It was like Top Chef came to life!

We decided to go for the Seasonal Discovery Menu (although it sounds much fancier in french - Decouverte de Saison!).  This was a 9 course menu and every course was just better and better.  My favorites were an onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus, an artichoke egg dish that I can't describe properly although I do know it had foam and the egg was cooked perfectly, and the dover sole cooked with ginger and leeks.  The last two courses were both desserts and I was pleasantly surprised by both of them, even though I was stuffed beyond belief after the 7th course.

3333230,2012-05-08,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"In early March '12, I followed up dinner at Joël Robuchon with dinner the next night at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon.  Indulgent for sure, but hey, it's Vegas.  As opposed to the formal atmosphere of the MIchelin three-star next door, L'Atelier is upscale casual with primarily counter service and a handful of high-top tables for four.  The counter concept is actually not well-executed at L'Atelier:  The divider between the perimeter of the kitchen area and the diner makes it extremely awkward for the servers to remove dishes and glasses.  On top of that, the food at L'Atelier is prepared nowhere near the counter--the ranges are at the back of the restaurant followed by a preparation counter and then yet another finishing counter.  This shouldn't be confused with Masa in New York (or other intimate chef's table type settings) where the chef prepares your food right in front of you and hands you the finished product.

Instead of going with a tasting menu, we picked various individual items:  The Oysters were served warm with herbs.  To the dish's disadvantage, the delicate taste of the oysters is overpowered by the herbs.  It also would have been nice for the oysters to have been fully disconnected from the shells before serving.  The Anchovies with eggplant and red pepper is both a visually-appealing and solid-tasting dish.  The strong taste of the anchovies is restrained by the other ingredients, making this a decent appetizer for those who might usually think anchovies are too strong.  Watch out for the much-talked about Burger--the ""burgers"" themselves are shockingly small with about the same circumference as a silver dollar (at least you get two ""burgers"" per order).  I think the small size actually prevents the diner from getting a decent feeling for the foie gras.  This pales, for instance, to the far superior burger at DB Bistro Moderne (which was also served at Daniel Boulud Brasserie in the Wynn until it closed).  The Langoustine dish was excellent even while I was initially skeptical of the tempura-like preparation.  The langoustine itself is buttery and perfect.  Finally, the Pistachio Soufflé was very good with good flavoring and the perfect size (in comparison to the much too large chocolate soufflé I had the day before at Joël Robuchon).  I recommend doubling-down (hey, it's Vegas) and pairing it with the pistachio sorbet.

My criticisms are probably a little harsh but not wholly unwarranted given the level of restaurant L'Atelier, with a Michelin star of its own, aspires to be and the price you pay for the meal.  My overall experience was still positive, but even ignoring my criticism of L'Atelier's counter service, a couple of the dishes could use some improvement.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,2,0,3,fydgDZe7fJ0hmr1GdQ8IsQ

had dinner at The French Laundry the other day...no foie gras on the menu...dinner sucked.

i basically had a dinner that consisted of foie gras prepared several ways, along with having some fresh uni...that was all.

good thing about this place is that you dont NEED to do a prix fixe menu...you simply choose what you want to eat and make your own 3-10 course meal yourself (granted, it might be cheaper to do the set menu...i learned this the hard way)

so if you live in california...and you miss your foie gras...this place is a must try restaurant...and if there is one thing on the menu i would recommend...PLEASE GET THE FOIE GRAS SLIDERS...they will change your life.",Dn2gtoQnMgf261kIXpjLvA,2,1,5,EEI_O9DXpzJVhDPHydfBHg
3347378,2012-09-19,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Absolutely Phenominal.

Those two words encapsulated my experience at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.

I work in the food industry, so I like to think I know what I'm talking about. From the Knowledgeable waiter Eddie, to the gorgeous dishes, every part of the meal was perfect.

I went with my parents to celebrate my 28th birthday, and they were very interested to try the food; they've never had french fine dining and although I would've loved to eat at Joel Robuchon's namesake restaurant, I figured to start with L'atelier first.

We reserved dinner for 3 at 6pm and were seated without a moment's wait. The decor was fantastic and very modern. Our waiter introduced himself, Eddie and handed us 3 menus, the main menu, the 9 course seasonal discovery menu, and the wine list. I suggested to my parents to go with the prix fixe menu of 79$ which included an amuse bouche, appetizer, main course, and desert. I went with the 9 course menu, being the birthday kid and all. 

This review will be only about my 9 course meal.

And so the experience begins.

L'Amuse Bouche: Foie gras pargait with port wine and parmesan foam
It arrived in a shot glass/egg dish looking bowl, and it was a great intro to the meal, very light and flavorful.

Les Tomates: Heirloom tomato salad, basil oil, and fleur de sel
Gorgeous presentation, exquisite art piece, flavor was great, top not tomato salad.

La Saint-Jacques: Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil.
ABSOLUTELY amazing, it was light, full of flavor, expertly and perfectly cooked.

Les Langoustines: Langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut milk.
by FAR my favorite dish of the night. The mini lobsters were delicious, fresh, and perfect balance of flavors, the meat slid right off the shell and I loved it.

Le Cebette: White onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg ""mirror"" and green asparagus.
My mother commented ""It looks so cute with the tiny egg"" It was aesthetically beautiful, with a beautifully and perfectly cooked quail egg resting a top the onion tart. The flavors were there, but I feel a bit guilty in saying I wasn't TOO impressed with this dish. It was still delicious nevertheless.

Le Saumon: Lightly smoked salmon with fingerling in a buttery shellfish sauce with curry and baby leeks.
My second Favorite dish. The salmon was so delicious, perfect balance of smokiness and salmon taste, delightful. the star of this dish by far though was the buttery shellfish sauce, it was so good that I even took the house made baguettes offered at the start of the meal and soaked up all the sauce.

La Caille: Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes.
This dish I had been waiting for, I wanted to see the execution of the stuffed quail and couldn't wait to try their much talked about mashed potatoes. The foie stuffed quail was very tasty and the only heavy seeming dish of the night and it fit perfectly with the other dishes, the star of course were the mashed potatoes, ohmygod is all I can say, I hate putting down homemade mashed, but It was hands down THE BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had. Airy, light, and so delicious.

ON TO DESSERT.

La Margharita: Yogurt Ice Cream wit tequila gelee, fresh blackberries and pop rocks. 
It almost seemed like a deconstructed margharita, which isn't a bad thing. It was an interesting dish, but delicious. I very much like the tequila jelly, not too strong, but flavorful and complimented the ice cream well.

La Framboise: Raspberry Medley and earl grey puffed rice krispies.
When I saw rice krispies, I definitely had to take a second look, I was a bit ""huh?"" but it worked and was delicious.

Throughout the meal Eddie, our server, was fantastic when explaining the dishes to us, asking us how our meal was, and even went more in depth with any questions I had for him. They caught me off guard when they even brought out a birthday dessert which was unexpected and appreciated. A mixture of 5 different mini cakes. A tiramisu like cake, raspberry cake, strawberry lemon tart, chocolate cake, and what taste like a pumpkin pie. 

My mom is a seafood fanatic and when I would give her bites of my langoustine and scallop she absolutely loved it. My step-dad ordered their wagyu hanger steak and he said it may be the best piece of beef he's ever had, and that man loves steak.

I've never dined at any Joel Robuchon establishments, but this set the bar high for me, and makes me understand why he's the ""chef of century"".

3372052,2009-11-24,29,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Lessons learned from first hand experience are the ones that stick with you forever.   

Lesson #1.  
Don't come to L'Atelier expecting the same life changing experience you'd get at Joel Robuchon (The Mansion) next door.  Although it's still sophisticated and elegant, the vibe here is more casual, especially with the counter seating and open kitchen.  Watching the chefs prepare your meal in hushed voices, and sometimes utter silence, is quite an experience in itself. 

Lesson #2.
Don't come here expecting your own private space.  If you're with a party of 4 or more people, then you get your own table.  Otherwise, it's counter seating.  It encourages conversation not only with your server, but your neighbor as well.  

Lesson #3.  
Don't come here expecting to be blown away by the creations of ""Chef of the Century"" when all you've is 1 hour and 15 mins. because there's a show you need to catch at Ka theater, which is literally, 10 steps from L'Atelier.  I was clock-watching the whole time.  They do have a menu called L'Unique, specifically created for those in a rush, it consists of an app, entree and dessert, served all at once.  The couple next to us raved about it, but it doesn't offer Robuchon's signature dishes which was the reason I wanted to come here. 

Lesson #4.  
So, IF all you've got is 1 hour and 15 mins., order from their small plates selection.  They've got quite an extensive menu arranged from lightest fare to heaviest.  Prices ranged from $$25 - $$45.  We decided to go with this due to the time constraint and timing of the dishes were actually well paced.  

By far, the two most memorable dishes I've had here that night had one ingredient in common: foie gras.  The amuse bouche of foie gras parfait layered with a port wine reduction and foamy parmesan on top was a heavy palate opener, but the strong flavors excited my palate on what was to come.  La Caille is a free range quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle mash potatoes. It was supreme.  The quail skin was textbook crisp, the meat juicy. The ratio of the potato to butter must be one to one because it was the creamiest, richest mashed potato I've ever had.  Period.  

 I'd say skip La Courgette, which is roasted zucchini with eggplant caviar, it looks pretty on the plate, but pretty boring on the tastebuds.  I'd also pass on the La Saint-Jacques, a sea scallop cooked in lemon oil and topped with micro chives; it wasn't seared, how they prepared this I don't know, but it came out very, very tender.  However, if you're looking for flavor, this one won't scream at you.  And, they give you one scallop!  Imagine sharing that.  

For dessert, consider the cheese plate with walnut bread.  I don't remember the names of all the cheeses, but the Rebluchon is lovely, with its soft texture and nutty taste. 

Service is executed with military precision. These folks are trained to serve you with utmost excellence and are knowledgeable about their wines and food.  

I was already thinking the next time we come back, the 9 course Discovery Menu would be the way to go.  That is, until the bf saw ""Le Bill"" and said we won't be coming back here in the near future.  

Well, my palette is ready for French food, but apparently, our bank account isn't.",Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ,31,26,3,3Dnl429ZgGO8v-S9Wbe0wA

I know there are many mixed reviews about this restaurant but I'd say you won't know unless you try for yourself. So, give it a go! Hey, they do have one Michelin star...

The décor inside is sleek and modern with a lot of black. They have an open kitchen so if you sit at the counter, you are in for a real treat. (They have regular seating too but it's more fun sitting at the counter.) You can watch as the cooks and chefs prepare your meal and meticulously plate each course. Oh, and listen to bits of French here and there. :)

They start you off with a wonderful bread basket and salted butter. Delicious! The baguettes taste just like the ones you'd purchase in France. There were some flaky, buttery rolls thrown in as well that were amazing too. Oh my goodness!

Seasonal Discovery Menu ($168) - If you are going to dine at L'Atelier, you most certainly should try the tasting menu. For what you get, the price is quite reasonable. 

L'amuse-bouche - Foie gras parfait with a port wine reduction and parmesan emulsion. This was so good! It was served in a little shot glass with foam on top. Yum!

Les Crevettes - Shrimp carpaccio, poppy seeds & Yuzu vinaigrette. This was a light and refreshing course. It was salty but the citrus from the Yuzu really balanced the flavors wonderfully. I really liked this dish.

La Courgette - Zucchini cooked on one side with curry, eggplant caviar and Ibérico ham. This was probably my least favorite dish. It was just ok. The presentation was really pretty and I loved the ham, but the overall flavor was a tad bitter.

La Saint-Jacques - Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil on an artichoke jus. Tasty! The scallop was tender and cooked to perfection.

Le Foie Gras - Foie gras ravioli served in a white soy sauce bouillon. This was my favorite dish! DELICIOUS. Little pillows filled with yummy foie gras. The flavor of the bouillon was amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed all the ingredients in it. 

Le Saumon - Fresh salmon confit, savoy cabbage, juniper berries and kale emulsion. This was good! Tender, fresh salmon tasted yummy with the crushed juniper berries.

Le Buf - Glazed beef cheeks ""Burgundy style"" wrapped in cannelloni, cumin carrots. Another tasty dish. Beef cheeks never fail me! 

Les Myrtilles - Blueberry and lemongrass Chantilly, fresh compote and yogurt sorbet. This was a tarty dessert but I loved it. Beautiful presentation! 

Les Fruits Rouges - Orange cream, chocolate sponge, pickled cherries and strawberry sorbet. Mmm, those cherries!

Le Cafe - They were gracious enough to let me get hot tea, which made me very happy. The chamomile was wonderful! :)

The service was outstanding and the staff was just fabulous. They take good care of you here and are not afraid to strike up a conversation.

Food: 4.5, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 2
Cost to worth it rating: 3 (tasting menu $159, wine pairing $105)
Return worthiness: yes

Highlights:
- Menu options: you can do whatever want from getting a bunch of appetizer portions, a la carte entree, 4-5 course of your choice from selected items, or a full 9 course tasting menu. I like that the whole party does not have to agree on the direction.
- Seared foie: one of the best versions I've had (and I order it as often as I can). Thin slice with the perfect level of crispy sear on top and melt in your mouth texture underneath that.
- Onion tart: still a favorite. Like an upscale quiche but the thin version with a crispy bottom layer. Presentation with the tiny egg in the middle, thin cheese triangles on the side, and confetti of bacon was beautiful 
- Rose: the star of the wine pairing and I appreciated the departure from a syrupy sweet wine paired with seared foie.
- Amuse: Parmesan foam and foie isn't a common combo, but it worked. Kinda looked like a latte in a shot glass which was fun
- Foie gras sliders: not my dish but looked amazing and got rave reviews from my friends. Mini beef burgers with seared foie on top paired with crinkly fries and a ginger ketchup.

Midlights:
- Wine pairing: glad they added this since my last visit but it was more like a few glasses than a true course by course pairing. Was a bit challenging saving half while waiting for the next course as well. 

Lowlights:
- Waiter: fine when he was talking to us but he was never around. The worst part was almost the hour gap between the cheese course and desserts. After a several hour meal, my table was getting restless. No acknowledgment of the issue at this caliber of a restaurant was very disappointing. 
- Tables: not as fun without a view of kitchen. I'd suggest all the seats in the place have a clear view of the kitchen
- Fish: bit overlooked and not much flavor

You get the best of everything all conveniently located in walking distance on the strip 24/7. We got tickets to the KA show which is located inside MGM. Since we are both food lovers and fans of CHEF OF THE CENTURY Joel Robuchon, he decided to treat us to this restaurant since it was located right next door to the KA Theater. FYI: we made reservations way in advance (about a month) it books up quick

We decided to do the Course A Menus in addition to extra a la carte plates off the menu. Total was a little over $400 w/ tax & tip, but totally worth it!! (Yes you get charged for water)

We were lucky to get close seating so that we could see the open kitchen. I loved watching the chefs do their thing live. Felt like I was on Master chef being one of the judges hehe. The setting is very intimate w/ dim lit lights and red/black color theme. Our waiter was very professional and had great recommendations. We got started off w/ complimentary bread basket and butter. THAT BUTTER WOW not sure if it's house made, but it is some bomb ass butter w/ their bread basket (ate 2 baskets of it!)

For course A you get Amuse-Bouche, 2 appetizers, 1 main course, and 1 dessert.

Amuse Bouche - It was Foie Gras parfait w/ port wine & parmesan foam. Goodness it was sooo rich I almost choked trying to take it all in one shot. The foie gras is very distinct as I haven't had it before in CA. Very great opener to start our meal

Les Langoustine - HOLY CRAP I wish I ordered double of this. Don't you just love french names for food? They always sound so appealing and the langoustine dish here lived up to its name. It basically was like a tempura deep fried lobster, but the outside wasn't oily at all! It was crispy and had the perfect crunch. Incredible, meaty, juicy langoustine

La Fromage - Cheese plate. If you're a fan of cheese & wine make sure u order this. It was a la carte, but all the cheeses were delish! YES even the blue cheese (We have never been a fan of blue cheese, but loved it here)

Le Caille - Free range foie gras stuffed quail w/ mashed potatoes. OMG the mashed potatoes here are to die for, sooo buttery. The stuffed quail was by far the best I've had. Presentation was gorgeous. Definitely try this dish

Lobster gnocchi - The gnocchi was a bit undercooked and they were nice enough to offer us another dish, but we were running short on time for the Ka Show so instead they comped us a dish :) Customer service at its finest! The sauce and lobster were superb, if only the gnocchi wasn't undercooked :(

Kampachi - FRESH and neatly presented. Very light tasting

Cod - Small portion, but very filling. I felt that the fish was overcooked. However, it could just have been my fault for comparing it to sea bass which is usually rich & buttery in texture anyway.

La Hampe - Hangar steak med rare. After reading some of the reviews we ordered this dish a la carte and it was SOOOOO GOOD. Cooked perfectly med rare, was tender and melted in my mouth. Couldn't have asked for a more beautiful meat dish

La Framboise - ice cream w/ fresh berries dessert. A work of art for sure that I didn't even know where to start digging in. The berries were sweet & fresh, ice cream was rich, creamy, and refreshing.

Souffle - Took a while 'cause souffle takes time to rise. Our waiter was kind enough to make sure we got it fast enough so that we could make it on time for our show! It came out rising high and this delicate dessert was delicious.

There were more plates, but I can't remember the name of each dish since we ate here a while back in October. However, every dish was an art! I can't wait to come back and try the tasting menu next door. I love that the menu is seasonal and changes, that's the art & beauty of fancy restaurants like Joel Robuchon's.",u6Rb0yrjDvYpAFOgXL8WXQ,15,13,5,Kg-Rh_-w8LvxgypIGH0srQ

Sadly, we had a mixed experience with the dishes that we tried, but the service was excellent and we loved the ambiance. We had:

-Complimentary Breads & Butter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A): Delicious- it's hard not to like French breads with butter.
-Complimentary Amuse Bouche (Soup w/Foie Gras, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#8HMsBi4oIbL33MtTPLQD0A): This was a good start to our meal, and the soup was rich and flavorful.
-Le Hamachi (Yellowtail as Ravioli, Sea Urchin, Lemon Vinaigrette, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#mxBNIojYSMqBrSXN4R4Esw): Super fresh and delicious- this was our favorite dish and we wish we ordered a few more dishes.
-Le Macaroni (Comte Cheese, Endive, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#iDTQvdL91xk-SdSAcWxt9g): We didn't get this dish- you got two giant ""noodles"" with endives and sauce, and the concept didn't quite work for us. Skip!
-Le Sliders (Beef Sliders w/Foie Gras, Served w/Fries, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#M__-DLZAq0Yc1P-tjsG0Bw): The sliders were good but definitely very greasy from the beef and the foie gras. I didn't think it was the most amazing slider with foie gras that I had, but the fries were really good. 
-Le Hampe (French Style Hanger Steak w/Roasted Shallot, Shishito Pepper, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#hraApOw1CCz4iagTEfSrPA): Good, but very boring. The steak was cooked well but it wasn't anything special. Skip!
-Le Homard (Maine Lobster Fricassee w/Creamy Aromatic Sauce, $38, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#pyOvzBlxehZG_OGe0A7Rfw): The lobster was also cooked well, but again, this was a very boring dish. I wouldn't get this again.
-Yuzu Cocktail w/Basil Leaf (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#bAWQayDCFO_uix9Ch8x3Cg): Solid cocktail.
-Passion Fruit Mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-atelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-4?select=X5zShC7kSQNkqTLcZGt34A#xZzf8q9NCLQaH8QaXqmjZw): Yum- we all enjoyed this dessert, and it was a great way to end the meal.

Overall, we only liked a couple of the dishes that we tried, and were really confused by the others. I guess we'll have to do the grand tasting at the restaurant to get the true Joël Robuchon experience. Based on this meal, we would probably come back to try their other dishes, but am not in any hurry to.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,5,2,3,RXJ2R7766VCFR8-fQgnrjQ

Ambiance was ok. Black, red, dark. Very modern Vegas, but looked like a place where True Blood vampires would dine at.

Had the 3 course $39 prixe fixe special and came out feeling hungry and unsatisfied.

Ordered a melon appetizer, halibut main entree, and an unmemorable rum dessert.

The entrees came out looking like an entire tv dinner on one plate, similiar to a bento box. Um, what happened to a real dining experience? No drum roll? Just slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am plates?

Staff was friendly though and I liked the wrap around bar.

However, the food lacked the quality and substance of Joel Robuchon.

4.5 stars. Why the missing half star?  I'll get to that later. 

Bread basket was yummy.  I had to seriously control myself from getting full off the delicious croissants. 

Seasonal tasting menu = amazing.  Be prepared for a 2+ hour dinner.  Fairly small plates but you will be FULL after finishing all 11 courses.  Highlights: foie gras parfait,  hamachi, foie gras, and quail.  Loved the order in which each dish was served.  These courses will make you foie gras-LOVER.

Uni Pasta - The pasta was cooked perfectly.  Chewy in the middle.  Uni was fresh.  Only downside was the sauce.  It was extremely salty which came as a bit if a shock, but I'm sure it was a mistake?  Everything else was seasoned perfectly is why this threw me off. Half star off for that. 

Decor is beautiful.  It's a fairly small restaurant with a glossy black/red interior with an open kitchen.  Parties of one or two will most likely be seated on the counter - which I love!

The restaurant, as its name describes, feels like an elegant food workshop. You get to see the chefs prepare the dishes right before your eyes. We chose the bar seating to get to experience this. We wore suits, but you could definitely get by in just a dress shirt and pants, probably should avoid jeans though.

The only disappointing part of the experience was at the start when we had the bread. After hearing so much about the decadent bread cart offered next door and how some of that same bread was offered here, I expected a lot. However, the bread was pretty hard and nothing special.

After that, the rest of the experience was a wonderful culinary journey. Nine courses in all, none disappointing in the slightest. Some highlights include the delicate yet perfectly seasoned sea scallops, the langoustines with a spectacular green curry sauce, a unique white onion tart, a delectable serving of lightly smoked salmon, luscious foie gras stuffed quail, and Joël Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes. The desserts were exotic and delicious, and it all finished off with one of the better cups of coffee I have had.

The meal was a bit pricy for one michelin star, costing around $220 after tip (with no alcohol), but considering the quality of the food and the price of a likely similar meal next door, it was definitely worth it.",lXAB9NMJRLm4ak0mk75Jag,2,1,5,zEP7L_lv9EGYAB5pCayzVg

Hostess was at the front area doing something, but when I was about to ask her about the menu and making a reservation, she left and went to the Joel Robuchon next door. BF didnt like that. He said she's such a pretentious,,,, (bleep bleep). I thought of giving them a chance since fellow yelpers seem to be loving them.
Reservation came out fine. Hostess seem nicer. She even said, that they're known for is the counter table and had us seated there so that we can look at the preparation and cooking experience.
We came in and ordered a la carte instead. I wanted to have the foie gras because I wanted to compare their cooking with Andre's. I ordered the Stuffed Quail foie gras. Anyway, its so small, I was surprised how small it is considering the Server said that that's the big plate. I guess, he may have been talking about the plate not the food. LOL. Should I order that one again? NO. I yearn for Andre's again.
BF had the white bass and it was ok. Still a consistent 3 star, nothing spectacular. The skin is not even crispy.
Bread and butter were great, its unlimited.

And the Lord said, ""It is good."" And it was good, and light fell upon the face of the earth.

I agree.  Every single freaking bite at this place makes you feel like you never ate before.

My wife does not get emotional about food.  But I counted 2 or 3 audible gasps from her and one ""Wow, this is the best pasta I ever had"".  Deconstructed carbonara, to be exact.  Put a whole poached egg in the bottom of a bowl of carbonara and YOU SEE IF YOU CAN STAY CALM!  No you can't, liar.

She actually got emotional over the mashed potatoes.  (The waiver insisted there is actually some potato in there, and not just BUTTER AND CREAM.)  They were indeed good enough to take your breath away.  MASHED POTATOES.

If I ever go back, I might just order the mashed potatoes, carbonara and and bottle of wine.

We were seated at the counter where we got to enjoy the ""show,"" watching the chefs prepare each and every dish.  I've always appreciated fine dining, but watching the meticulous details that went into every single dish made me appreciate it that much more!

* Course 1 - The Amuse Bouche, a Foie Gras Parfait, was a lovely way to begin our adventure.  I don't really like Foie Gras, but in the parfait form, I actually liked it.

*   Course 2 - Snapper Tartar - This was a lovely way to whet the appetite further, especially after the rich taste of the Foie Gras Parfait.  It was light and refreshing.

*  Course 3 - Poached Oysters - I've never really tried oysters, raw or poached, but I decided to try it here, since they looked so appetizing.  I ate two and gave the third one to the husband since he LOVED this dish so very much.  I thought it was a bit salty and didn't really care for it all that much.  Maybe it's an acquired taste that I have yet to acquire.

*  Course 4 - Maine Lobster in a spicy broth - This was delicious.  The lobster was perfectly cooked, and not rubbery.  My only complaint is that it was so small!

*  Course 5 - White Onion Tart with Quail Egg - This was my favorite dish of the whole evening.  The tartlette was perfectly crisp, and the fried Quail Egg (which I had never tried before) complemented it perfectly.  Delicious!  I think I could have eaten about ten of these.

*  Course 6 - Monkfish Cheek - Very good.  The texture seemed almost like lobster and if no one had told me it was Monkfish Cheek, I would have thought it was lobster.

*  Course 7 - Veal Flank Steak - Perfectly cooked and delicious.  The husband went with the Duck stuffed with Foie Gras option that he immensely enjoyed.  I liked my Veal Flank Steak served with the best tasting mashed potatoes I've ever had... and I'm not really a lover of mashed potatoes, but this was quite divine.  The husband's duck came with the mashed potatoes as well.

*  Course 8 - Caramel Panacotta - Very delicious, and not too sweet, which I liked.

*  Course 9 - Raspberries with Chocolate Cake pieces - This was more decadent than the first dessert, but combined with the raspberries and the sauce that accompanied it, it was perfect.

The tasting menu also came with coffee, espresso, a latte or cappuccino with dessert.  The Latte I had here was perfect.  SO good, and was the perfect way to end a perfect meal.

I've been to several Michilin rated restaurants (Le Cirque, Picasso, Providence, Melisse), and L'Atelier fits the category for its fine cuisine.  The main difference that I really liked was that L'Atelier was not as stuffy as the others I've tried.  Sitting at the counter gave it a more casual feeling, kind of like sitting at the sushi bar.  The whole meal took a whopping 2.5 hours, but hey - we got dinner and a show, all in one - so I'd say it was all worth it!",C2YOPY2LhxGGrrpzrR9EoQ,1,1,5,2v3JUpaetwXn74Sv-aI-Eg

The wines were also fantastic-- the sommelier really helped us out and took his time finding bottles that would match up with the wide variety of flavors going on. And then there's the atmosphere, which is really modern, sleek, and cool without feeling too trendy or pretentious. The service was of the caliber of the best restaurants I've been to-- very impressive. I can't believe this is like a ""step down"" from Robuchon's flagship next door.

3500219,2015-12-07,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This one had been on this list for me to go to ever since I'd moved to Vegas last year. I'm generally hesitant to eat on the strip as it's sometimes tough to find the balance between the great food you're likely to find, but not overpaying for it. 

L'Atalier isn't the priciest of places, nor the fanciest, but my experience here was amazing. The space is one of a kind... who would have thought that at a really nice place, you'll be sitting at a bar watching the kitchen? This really adds to the whole experience: you're not just getting a meal, you're watching a show.  

The food here: also top notch and reasonably priced. I went with a fix price menu which consisted of 2 appetizers (mango ceviche, seared scallops) an entree (duck breast) and dessert (coffee ice cream) - sorry for not translating the dishes into food-speak for all you foodies out there, but I'll just write this review for the masses. 

The waiter/bartender also brought us a foie gras with Parmesan foam small plate and a few desserts for our anniversary following the meal. As i went through course after course here... i can recall turning to my wife and saying ""I feel like I'm on vacation"". Yes, the food is just that good: some are a little unique modern flair that will be something you've likely never tried (Parmesan foam... foam??!), others are just the mark of a perfectly prepared and delivered classic dish (duck breast). Oh and potatoes Robuchon? Hands down best mashed potatoes i've ever had. The secret: 1 part potato... 2 (maybe 3?) parts butter. Sorry heart. 

Definitely add to the list for a unique dining experience in Vegas. Hard to get out for under $200 if you're having any drinks though. IMO: worth every penny.",VQHGS5qNZvuN2Y78zDA2KQ,4,1,5,8jAA6AYTeREpbwtg_NQYIA
3516040,2013-05-29,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"WOW. Totally lives up to the hype. First off, this is the more casual (and ""cheaper"") version of the Joel Robuchon franchises. They're right next door to each other and located right near the Cirque Du Soleil theater. 

Due to time, we opted for the a la carte menu (although I'd love to try their seasonal menu sometime). For the a la carte, there's one side that's ""small bites"" and another side that's regular appetizer and entree portions. 

Here were the highlights (almost everything we ordered):
1. Sea urchin with green sauce - Ok I don't know the name but it's basically a small dish that comes with a generous amount of sea urchin with a gelee and it's covered in a green sauce. There's a slight hint of mint flavor but the whole dish was pretty inventive and something different that I've never had before. For that reason alone, I'd order this dish. It's always fun to try an inventive dish
2. Le Foie Gras - The traditional seared foie is a must if you're from CA and it's simple and really makes you realize you hate that CA banned it. 
3. Le Burger - Oh my gosh the foie burger is one of their most popular dishes and I can totally see why. It's basically 2 small bites of a burger that's got a big chunk of foie in it. SO damn good. MUST order this. You won't regret it
4. La Langoustine - You get 3 pieces if you order the appetizer version (1 piece if you get the small tasting, I think). THIS is how langoustines are supposed to taste. Well done. 
5. La Caille - One of their signature dishes is the foie gras stuffed quail with mashed potatoes. The sauce for the quail is pretty amazing and the quail itself is pretty good too (although with all the flavor, it's a little hard to decipher the foie inside). However, the mashed potatoes on the side? TOTAL WIN. It was so buttery and good that I'd order that in itself. 
6. La framboise - The raspberry surprise inside the white chocolate sphere is a bit of a show but it's so delicious and savory but still maintains a lightness to it (that makes no sense. Just order it and you'll see). 

SKIP (don't get me wrong, it was still good but I probably wouldn't order it again)
1. The tuna belly confit - Looked like a fresh tasting salad and honestly, I was pretty confused as to where the tuna was. Good but probably the least memorable out of all the dishes.

L'Ateiler is worth the $500+ price tag. Did I just say that? Wow I'm getting snobby, or maybe its not ""getting"". 

The experience was awesome from beginning to end. I'm going to focus on the highlights of the food but the entire Discovery menu ($175/pp; 9 course) was amazing. 

* Langoustine Carpaccio with toasted poppy seed dressing. 
It was served flat on a dish and to be honest looked a bit odd, but after my first bite I realized this may be the best dish of the night. 

* Poached Baby Kushi Oysters served with French Butter. I'm usually not a big fan of cooked oysters, however the combination of the oyster and our champagne was perfect. 

* Venison with sweet and sour cranberry and chestnuts, served with the house specialty truffle mashed potatoes. Venison is a challenging dish to put on any menu, especially a tasting menu. In this case it was prepared to perfection! The cranberries were not too overpowering and balanced the bold flavor of the venison quite well. 

* Fresh Passion fruit in a coconut meringue. I'm not a big dessert fan, but this was a nice ending after all of those intense flavors. 

The second most impressive thing to me at this restaurant was watching the action in the kitchen. The restaurant is very small, and typically I'm not a big fan of sitting at the bar, however it is a must at L'Atelier. The best way I can describe it is a ""ballet with a bell""!

3520070,2009-10-31,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I assign 1 star not because the food was terrible (it wasn't) but rather because it was WAY below expectation. My wife & I have dined at other Michelin-star restaurants, and they far exceeded L'Atelier. We both had the tasting menu and, by the time we left, the wine, water and tip inflated the bill to close to $500. Definitely not worth it. The next night we had a far better meal (also a  tasting menu) for $200 at the nearby Shibuya. What was disappointing about L'Atelier? Three of the courses depended on foie gras. Not too imaginative. One of the courses (a small piece of King crab) was good but I honestly believe that we could easily replicate it - or improve upon it - at home (which is NOT something I'd say about any other Michelin dish I have tasted). And half-way through the meal the waiter informed us that he had forgotten to mention that one of the courses - scallops - had been replaced by oysters. When you're paying $300 for food alone, I think it's reasonable to expect to be told ahead of time what you'll be eating! The 2 dessert courses were good. Most certainly would not go back. And because of this experience, nor will we try to dine, in the future, at the partner restaurant (Joel Robuchon at the Mansion).",qvfEFjvZbXJWPOj0Bc3xSw,0,0,1,Tsk6Ms6vkUxbeJLeRW-fGQ
3520777,2017-01-14,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Even though this business casual French restaurant received one Michelin star back in 2009 and I was somewhat impressed with the initial truffle presentation ($220 for 10 grams of white truffle on spaghetti dishes only & $25 for 3 grams of black truffle on any dishes), I really feel that it wasn't worth $163 (not including tax and tip) for somewhat lackluster 5-course create-your-own menu (Menu B).

I will admit that the restaurant is somewhat difficult to locate within the MGM Grand, but just walk toward to the KÀ Theatre and it is conveniently located right next to the theatre. I booked my reservation through the OpenTable and the service was pretty much business as usual (well there was a minor hiccup on refilling my water cup), but I did notice that the staff selectively engaged in small talks only with certain customers. Decent breads, but nothing incredible.

Menu: If you don't want to think too much, then you have three create-your-own-menu options ($58 Menu Pré Théâtre: amuse-bouche, 1 appetizer, and roast of the day; $108 Menu A: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 1 main course, and 1 dessert; $138 Menu B: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and 1 dessert). Just a note, some dishes require additional $10 or $15 supplement. If you did your research and know what you want, then you can always order small / large à la carte tasting portions instead (the staff said 3~4 small tasting portions will be enough to fill you up).

*** $138 Menu B: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and 1 dessert ***

L'amuse-bouche (foie gras parfait with a port wine reduction and Parmesan foam): Tasted slightly milky with a very distinct taste of foie gras. It was like having foie gras in liquid form. Definitely a good start.

L'avocat (avocado with vegetable medley and tuna belly confit): Sliced tuna belly covered in avocado and few pieces of leaves. Considering how much I had to pay for this dish ... it wasn't very memorable.

La Daurade Et Le Saumon (snapper and salmon carpaccio with lemon vinaigrette and Espelette pepper): As someone who've had lots of good nigiri and sashimi, fish quality was good but not exactly amazing. Too much emphasis on olive oil, but I did like a hint of spicy kick from pepper.

Le Homard (Maine lobster over a light spiced creamy ""tagliatelle pasta"" - supple. $10): I got a simple description for this dish - egg noodle with creamy sauce & slightly dry chewy lobster.

Le Boeuf (beef tenderloin cooked with black Malabar pepper - supple. $15): Possibly the best beef tenderloin I've had ... ultra tender meat with smooth mashed potato. HOWEVER, pepper tasted slightly overwhelming and it somewhat ruined the overall flavors of this dish.

Les Tartes (traditional tartes): Assortment of flavors that include lemon, cinnamon, blueberry, etc - some tarts tasted too sour, but some tarts were pretty good.

***

Not sure if I would pay additional $25 supplement on TOP of already expensive $138 dinner menu. In fact, I would steer away from the create-your-own menu because items listed on the create-your-own menu aren't as appealing as items listed on the à la carte list. Overall I believe there are better way to spend close to $200 in Vegas and feel free to give this place a try if you don't mind overpaying for both food and the open kitchen experience.",rQLEfpfSjVK-3dBmIMKZDA,1,1,3,bwJUe8cpNhle1eywTKbuig
3523113,2012-10-26,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I'm admittedly a total Anthony Bourdain slut. After rewatching his Paris episode (in which he goes to L'Atelier with Robuchon protege Eric Ripert), and knowing I was headed to Vegas, I immediately doubled down on making my friend secure reservations to L'Atelier.

The decision between L'Atelier and the original Joel Robuchon is well reasoned in the episode made mention of above. To me, L'Atelier represented one of the baseline restaurants that we now take for granted. Food today has now done away with white linens and stuffy environments. Restaurants today are eat, drink, and be merry, and owe many thanks to the once-bold decisions of innovators like Robuchon. So embrace the past, or look towards the future. I picked the latter. Oh, plus L'Atelier is cheaper.

At L'Atelier, the overtly red and black decor screams bold, and the novel bar/kitchen open concept has since been copied in restaurants everywhere. Bar seating would be, in my opinion, exceptionally fun. Despite the lower key environment, service was still impeccably good, and the price point is not for light wallets.

With a group larger than 6, we were given the nine-course Menu Decouverte de Saison, with a fixed price of $159/pp (menu and pictures posted). I was greatly attracted to the variety of offerings, and though it wasn't nearly as endless as French Laundry, nine was plenty long and plenty filling. Wines and cocktails are pricey, but I thought my $11 Ketel One martini was plenty reasonable--and delicious to boot. Oh, and the bread basket is superb, as French carbohydrates ought to be.

Two starters, a Foie Gras Parfait amuse bouche and Celery Mousse gelatinous soup, started the night off well. The Celery Mousse was perhaps the only table miss, though I personally liked it better than the incredibly rich parfait. The molecular gastronomy undertones (parmesan foam, anyone?) were already creeping out in both dishes, and I started to draw comparisons to other incredible dining experiences like French Laundry, Oxheart in Houston, and Barley Swine in Austin.

The next two dishes, a dive into the sea, were nothing short of divine. ""It tastes like the ocean"" is a big Bourdainism, and it's easy to see what he means with the Saint-Jacques (sea scallop) and Langostine. Both are cooked in shell, though the scallop is served out. Both melted in my mouth, and left me wanting so much more. And, perhaps most amazingly, the simply done sauces added so much to already delicious seafood.

The Cebette (white onion tart), a transitory course to the entree, was my personal favorite. Perhaps it was the extra shaved white truffle my friend and I requested, or the quail fried egg, or the smoked bacon (yes, another total Bourdain sentence there). But sakes alive, that simple, almost pizza-esque dish, really did the trick for me.

The Salmon was incredible, lightly smoked and not drenched in salt like you're apt to find at your local Jewish deli. But it cam with the only miss of the night for me--the strange taste and oily texture in the buttery shellfish sauce.

From the land, I preferred the Boeuf capped ribeye, perfectly cooked and seeping with juice, to the Foie Gras Stuffed Quail, which felt just a little too small and tasted just a little too rich. But if you want to talk about rich, those world-famous mashed potatoes should really be called ""butter with a side of mash."" I would eat that sucker by the bucket if it didn't cost the size of a small Lego island and warp my stomach into the size of a beach ball.

By the dessert rounds, we were stuffed. I'm not a huge dessert guy, but I surprisingly found the L'Ananas (Spiced Ginger Cake) to work perfectly with coffee. The vanilla infused pineapples were something an Asian person who grew up with sponge fruit cake would love--hey, that's me! And the Margharita (Yogurt Ice Cream and Tequila Gelee) was for the Tex-Mex in me. The blackberries and pop rocks--yes, pop rocks--were a nice touch. Oh man, a blackberry Mexican Martini sounds like an awesome idea now.

Beyond the ambiance, service, and downright delicious food, I was incredibly impressed by how little misses there were. With a large party and a huge sampling of dishes, it would have been easy for more than a few unsatisfactory moments. But the table was mostly ooh's and ahh's, and that's always a fine thing when you're spending hard-won money on an extravagant dinner. Well played, L'Atelier. Well played indeed.",skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg,9,4,5,rFcRRtRTRp6I95O7hGUt2w
3523672,2010-07-26,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Yes, this place is pricey but if you have the money to spend, I recommend doing it here. 
This place deserves more of a 4.5 because there were some shortcomings... Allow me to elaborate... 
- you must make reservations... I recommend doing this as early as possible and then calling the night before to confirm the reservation 
- the place used to be a sushi restaurant (you can tell based on the bar setting). It's a bit tacky in my opinion 
- servings are small 

HOWEVER, this place is still fantastic because the food is mouth watering and so so so so fresh. 
- fois gras in quail was so tasty! The fois gras is tender and full of flavor. The mashed potatoes were also the best I have ever had 
- crab salad is so fresh and delicious. I watched as the lady pulled the crab meat out of the shells. 
- drinks are very stiff and tasty 
- the bread and butter... something is different about it here. The bread is so creamy and the bread is slightly sweet. I heard the flour is imported from France but who knows if that is true.

Food and Service.
The servers are not pretentious, they are dignified. I will assume that this is a direct result of knowing just how good the food/bev you serve is. But, I have been in places with good food/wine where the service is smug. Here, though the decor is more modern, I felt as though I'd walked in a family owned cafe in France. Every person we interacted with was sincerely pleasant. They seemed genuinely happy to be there serving the best, to you, and it translated. I have to include this because I believe it to be almost as important as the food.
Which, was unbelievably delicious. Every bite. We chose a couple from the small plates (he: le jambon, le vitello, le bar; me: les anchois) and I had an app (le saumon fume), I requested a dish from one of the tasting menus (l'asperge) and then we had dessert (la chartreuse). The ham melted on your tongue, and the texture was perfect. My anchovies looked like a silvery rainbow, glistening in a well-balanced vinagrette with just enough bite. The veal was beautiful and the lettuce a perfect complement. My salmon was light and wonderful, the dill cream with the hashbrown, delicious. The sea bass was good, but I have to say the other dishes surpassed it (the carrots in the sauce, made it a little sweet, I prefer the kick of the chorizo, Texan what can you say?). The L'Asperge was...okay...let me try to explain. I was full after the smoked salmon. They sent over the asparagus dish, it was so good, I was un-full. I wanted to eat it again. In fact, it was so good, I wanted to order it for dessert, instead of dessert. 
Did I mention how fun first-row seats to the kitchen are? (maybe not for the kitchen, but for us, c'est bon!) They run a tight ship, you can see the precision behind perfection...
It was a lovely, romantic, delicious, wonderful experience. Of course, there's only one way to prove that...make a reservation. :)",ceMhrxaFGQHOeCULMgaAiA,0,0,5,z99KxU46wf29hrkKyUutFw

I wasn't particularly hungry that night so I ordered only an entree.  Before they served our entrees, they brought us an amuse bouche.  It was good, but very fennel-y.  I'm not a big fan of fennel, but I can understand how someone who likes fennel would think that it was awesome.  For my meal, I ordered hanger steak, and it was quite moist and tender.  In retrospect, I probably ordered the wrong thing since steak is more or less steak.  The also served mashed potatoes on the side, and they were quite good - probably the most buttery potatoes I've ever had.  I also liked the cute bowl thing they served them in.  

My friends ordered a bunch of different starters, and the tasting menu.  They said that all the items were quite good.  However, a few dishes really made their eyes light up and they smiled as they ate them.  I can't think of another time that I saw that look on their face.

All in all, it was a wonderful eating experience.  The service was good, but our server was not as attentive as you would expect (though the other guy helping him was fantastic)  After we specifically told him we were in a hurry to catch a show, he disappeared with our check and credit card for over 10 minutes.

3567181,2009-08-21,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I was quite disappointed by the food here and was expecting much better from a Michelin One-star restaurant.  Especially after reading all the rave reviews and seeing how this place is near the top of the Yelp Las Vegas restaurants list, I was expecting a Gary Danko-like experience.

Alas, it was not to be.

I came here last weekend with a group of college friends, and we were MUCH THE EXCITES for the foods!  Tip: If you want the 3-course prix fixe, you must book a reservation before 6:45pm.  We all ordered the 3-course L'Unique dinner for $39.

Here's a recap of our experience; aite, here we goes:

+ The decor was BOLD BOLD BOLD.  Bright reds against a dark black background.  Very sexy colors.  The centerpiece at our table was a bunch of vibrant red roses.  HOT.  Like a lot of things in Vegas.
+ They gave us two baskets of bread, each basket containing like seven or eight giant pieces of bread.  The bread was FANTASTIC.  It made my favorite Ratatouille-Crunchy-Bread Sound!!  When you squeeze, it makes the sound!!  Crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.  Perfect with some butter.  Two of my friends and I each DEVOURED 3+ sticks of bread EACH.  It was AMAZING.
+ Our three courses came all at once, on a giant plate.  I got king crab over semolina for my appetizer; tender veal and mashed potatoes for the main entree; and some type of peach custard thing for dessert.  Rundown of the froods:

- Semolina was a bit bland, and DIFFICULT to eat!  3/5, I think.
+ Veal was a bit on the salty side, but tender and fell off the bones!  Yum!!  The mashed potatoes were a good complement and helped to lighten the saltiness of the veal.
- Um, the dessert was just WHACK.  It was like something I'd expect from like Quickly or some other cheapass Asian dessert place.  It was like custard/sago with the very strange addition of POPROCKS in there.  Uh, what?  Yeah.  Do not like.  Half star!  That dessert does not belong in a restaurant like this!  Crappy Asian dessert house, maybe.  Definitely a no-no here!  

I think the dessert alone brings down the review one star.  And then the mediocrity of the appetizer brings it down another half star.  The final half star is taken away because the entree, though good, wasn't knock-your-socks-off spectacular.  My friend got the halibut for her main entree and was also not impressed.

Overall, disappointed with L'Atelier, but hey it seems like a lot of people loved it so maybe I just might have to make another trip here and order the $75 five-course menu to get a better taste of the other items.  

It was overall sort of meh, but still good enough that I'd come back and eat.  

The bread alone is worth it.  I'm a greedy carb eater, and I CHOMPS the BREAD!!

And that was far before I joined the Yelp community. But this place left a lasting impression on me, even if it was in the over glamored Las Vegas setting, which is fun, but annoys me, because they take the bits and pieces of the best parts of the world, and water it down. - That's my take on Vegas in a nutshell (for culture)

Anyway - On to the review:  As I said, I was left with a very strong impression about this place.  Perhaps its because my first ""over the top"" foamed-gastro experience. 

Looking back, also a bit less educated and interested.  I thought that the foaming of some of my favorite flavors was neat, and interesting, but left a lot of the texture to be desired.  At the time, I also felt that the flavors seemed forced, and were some how lacking.

Looking back at the pictures of the food (I tend to keep a camera handy whenever I'm spending a good amount of cash on a meal) and re-reading some of my comments (again, I've made this a habit... Good or bad, who knows? I'm not a blogger, I just want to remind myself about my meals) I made to myself, and extracting, said flavors, I am realizing that I was just trying to act Jaded, and annoyed.  Really, the flavors were so amazing, and the portions, while small, were affordable enough that we could order 2 or 3 dishes each (actually, I think my buddy ordered 2 and I ordered 5) and not walk away with a stupid expensive bill (we're talking Vegas pricing... So, figure time and a half of what you'd expect to pay for something high end)

Also: I really enjoyed sitting at the counter.  Gave me the Sushi chef experience, which I so love, (but never get outside of Sushi) that you never see in Western Cuisine.  Having the Kitchen wait on you, is a truly a great experience.  I hope more people adopt this practice, even if it costs the guest an additional compensation fee, it really is quite spectacular.

3598859,2009-06-27,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Sorry fans, L'Atelier didn't live up to the hype. Yes, I agree it's very enjoyable sitting at the counter watching the chefs at work, it really was food as theater. But when the beautiful food reached my taste buds they were sadly disappointed.

We opted for our own selection of small plates instead of the tasting menu because there were a few options that I knew we would not like. Just a personal thing, I like neither salmon nor pork bellies.

First the bread came out. Good, but nothing special. Then an amuse bouche was served. Others have described this shotglass of foie gras, port wine reduction, and foam topping as flavorful and savory. I thought it was tasteless and murky. My wife made a sour face and put her shot glass on my plate. We weren't the only ones who didn't enjoy this as we watched each new set of diners who were seated near us do the same thing: take a taste, make a face, pass it to their partner. 

Next we had the Mediterranean vegetables layered with buffalo mozzarella. Again a pretty little stack on the plate, but rather bland. Extra credit for the basil reduction that decorated the plate. Very tasty.

King crab on a turnip disc looked great. We watched the chef assemble this with what appeared to be tweezers because the turnip discs were so paper-thin. Again the problem was with the taste, as in there was no taste to it. The crab piece was so small in this creative presentation that it added no flavor. 

What did taste good? 
The onion tart was light, flaky, and sweet.

Maine lobster in a ring of macaroni and a light cream broth. Excellent presentation with the penne pasta standing up in the broth like a stockade fence surrounding the lobster pieces. The broth had great flavor. Enjoyed dipping the bread in it. 

Foie Gras ravioli. The ravioli had a very smooth taste that filled my mouth with wonderful flavor and washed down well with the excellent chicken herb broth. 

We passed on dessert, but they brought us a sample tray of 5 treats as a way to wish us a happy anniversary. Each one was terrific, and saved the night for us, or rather for me since I picked this restaurant. 

So why do I rate L'Atelier less than 5-stars? I expected the best and didn't get it from every course. Also service was less than stellar. Why would they start to take away plates without asking if we were done? This same person took away our bread before we finished our entree without asking if we were done. May seem like a minor thing, but again not what you would expect from a Michelin-star restaurant.

Two other nit-picky things that just added to the irritation of the experience: If diners are expecting to watch the chefs at work, why do they have tacky decorations blocking the view? I mean jars of beans and rows of fruit that don't even look real. The couple next to us had a giant bowl of glass beads in front of them so they were straining to look over or around it. Even the waiter had to reach around it to serve their food. I mean, what's the point? Clear the view! Second item, we sat near the sliding door that separates the dining room from the casino. Every time they left the slider open, we suffered with a cold breeze and a blast of noise from the casino. Maybe they should enclose the hostess stand to give the casino more separation and eliminate the draft?",aqhWPniqCF8_oH86vwU-TQ,0,0,3,LB455e1MHpNviz7x2nbYDA

I highly recommend sitting at the chef's counter, where award-winning dishes are sliced, diced and sautéed to perfection, if spots are open. 

After placing our order, our server gave us two baskets of bread and butter. In the bread basket, there were four kinds of bread - baguette, boule, cheesy bread roll, and puff pastry-croissant like roll.

In addition to still and sparkling water, most of the party ordered glasses of red, rose, and white wine. However, if you don't want a non-alcoholic beverage, I'd highly recommend La Myrtille (The Blueberry), which consisted of a nice blend of pomegranate juice and ginger beer over ice and garnished with lemon peel wrapped fresh blueberries.

Among the party of five, I got to try a variety of small tasting and large portions. Everything I had was nicely presented and delicious. We started with an Amuse-Bouche, which consisted of foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam. 

(1) Les Legumes - seasonal vegetable medley (baby greens, frisee, avocado, and tomatoes) with Spanish virgin olive oil

(2) Le Maquereau - marinated mackerel with potato ""millefeuille"" and Caspian Ossetra caviar

(3) Les Langoustines - two pieces of crispy langoustine fritter over basil pesto and served with frisee tossed in a lemon vinaigrette

(4) Le Jambon - thinly sliced ""Ilberico de Bellota"" ham with toasted tomato bread (tartines)

(5) Le Burger - sesame seed slider buns with beef and foie gras patty with sauteed bell peppers served with spiced worcheshire sauce and crinkle cut french fries

(6) Le Crabe Royal - king crab in a salad of greens, avocados, tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella and garnished with crispy thin flavored wonton wrappers

(7) Le Homard Du Maine - spiced Maine lobster over spaghetti rustichella pasta

(8) Le Bar - seared Atlantic seabass crusted in celery leaves over diced beets in a citrus (kumquat)-beet reduction

(9) La Lotte - monkfish blanquette with smoked bacon and young vegetables (leeks and mushrooms) in a creamy white sauce and garnished with a seaweed cracker

(10) La Mangue - doubled glass with mango mousse served with coconut sorbet and almond cake and garnished with a flower candy.

(11) Le Cafe - coffee ""coperaco"" ice cream and chantilly with a chocolate sable

3616611,2008-09-14,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"the best analogy for this type of restaurant--
if you're guy, think of a home theater stereo system, a very good home theater in a box for about $400, i.e. Onkyo.  then imagine a very high end componenet system put together for under ten thousand.  yes, the expensive system is better with each perfect element, but definitely a diminishing return for the price.  high end dining is a similar experience, esp. after you've had great food in sf, napa, nyc, etc.
joel robuchon offers more classic french fare $145 tasting or $20-30 small bite plates.  (entrees are mostly larger portion size and double the price)
the reason for the analogy is that fine dining starts to taper at the top--the incremental improvement is smaller.  thus one starts to look for creative use of typical ingredients, innovative implementation of unusual ingredients, bonus points for unique or artistic expression of food.  it's hard not to become too picky.
robuchon is one of those chef/restaurants at the top.  but given that I can get something nearly as good for half the price in sf, and definitely something just as good for less in napa, this place is overpriced.
however, on to the dining experience...
the kitchen counter top is both good and bad -- yes the restaurant is undeniably beautiful with it's impeccable arrangement of food as decoration, but at a price of privacy.
amuse bouche -- Cucumber gele tarragon cream, cumin yogurt
Maine lobster in a gelée of vegetables topped with a chilled leek soup
Iberico de Bellota ham with toasted tomato bread
--jamon iberico: life changing (but you can get it elsewhere too)
Free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and served with truffled-mashed potatoes
--demi glaze was excellent
Braised pork belly with confit sweet onion
--crispy skin super tasty
Calf's sweetbread with a sprig of fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce

Chefs showed us how t make two of L'Atelier signature dishes (Egg Cocotte Topped with a light Mushroom Cream and Black Cod with a Yuzu Daikon Velvet Puree with Gold Leaf).

- Steam Egg topped with Foie Gras and Parmesan cheese foaming: As a big fan of foie gras, I never had it with any form of eggs before. But it was very delish. It was very creamy, elegant and finished with Parmesan cheese flavor in the end. 

- Egg Cocotte Topped with a light Mushroom Cream and bottomed of Parsley Puree: Mushroom in this dish was superb. It was very flavorful!! (my mouth has aroma of whole mushroom garden with just one bite of those sauteed mushrooms.) There are three layers in this dish. Every single bite brought me surprises.

I would say the best dish is still the quail with foie gras & Robuchon's famous mash potato (Without truffle, What a dissapointment!!).

Here I was, finally at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!
We were seated at the bar, which I really enjoyed because we got to see everyone at work preparing the food.  Our service was great.  A few standouts in our great meal:  
1) the jamon iberico de bellota - you might think 'oh, it's just ham..'  it's NOT!  Get it.. it was so delicious.. melts in your mouth.. the flavor so good.... totally worth it!
2) Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes - I haven't had foie gras served in this fashion before, and I have to say it was a great compliment to the quail.. I might be biased and say foie gras is a great compliment to just about anything but hey - it was great!  This is one of the signature dishes at L'Atelier, and for good reason.
3) I had them do a wine pairing with my meal even though I didn't get a tasting menu, and for my quail dish they somehow read my mind and brought one of my favorite wines ever - the Domaine Serene Evenstad Pinot Noir!  magical.
All the other food I had was also great, with the exception of the cheese course which was good but nothing mind-blowing.

3636491,2015-11-16,3,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I have mixed feelings about this place and was very hesitant about leaving this less than perfect review after reading so many excellent ones, but then I read the average ones and could not agree more!

Yes, the high expectations could have played a part in it but how could you not after reading about Chef Joel Robunchon, the Michelin stars, etc

We had a reservation for an early dinner so we could catch a show afterwards. The hubby and I shared Menu B which came with 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and a dessert for $80+ and also shared 2 additional small plates (total of $200+ with no alcohol).

For a party of 2, you are seated in their bar overlooking at the Chef and all staff prepare all dishes. There are also tables but they seem to be for larger parties.  I expected a more intimate and romantic experience but then again, seeing all the action in the kitchen was quite interesting.

We started with bread which was very good. I felt like I was eating baguette straight from Paris.

Then the amouse bouche came. It was liquidy with a bit of foei gras. Interesting but not my favorite. 

*Appetizers: we had a King Snapper ceviche which was a bit too tangy/sour and the Spanish tuna belly salad. The Veggies and tomatoes were fresh but the tuna belly had the texture of canned tuna and not raw and buttery as I expected. It also came with quail eggs that were delicious.

*Entrees: we had the duck with figs and the pork with cabbage. The duck was a bit tough and the berry sauce was not as sweet as I would have liked.  The pork with cabbage was good.  For the additional dishes, we had to order the foie gras and the milk fed pork chop. The foie gras was very smooth, unlike any other I have tried before.  However, it just didn't have much of the foie gras taste I have tried in other places.  The milk pork chop was ok, nothing too memorable. The meats lacked a bit of salt, in my opinion, but of course I didn't want to offend the chef by asking for some. The one dish that was very memorable was their mashed potatoes, super creamy and full of flavor.

*Desserts: This could have been the redeeming course since the French are known for pastries. I had a few slices of different flavors of pies and none of them really took my breath away. As a matter of fact, I didn't even finish them. For my bday, they also gave me a chocolate dessert that was very nicely presented and tasted good.

Overall, it's a good experience and the service was impeccable. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. However, for the hype and price, I was unfortunately underwhelmed.

The waiter was never around at all throughout the meal. We had to ask for water refills and they never did bring our drink orders. We then had to wait yet another 20 minutes for our mediocre pre made desert because the waiter was not around to serve it.

Our waiter, Joe, was the most attentive waiter I've ever had in my life.  I really felt as if my party had his undivided attention the whole night.  So patient and so outgoing.  He even took the time to suggest different wine pairings that would compliment everything I ordered, from dinner to dessert!  

I'd have to say the dessert made the evening.  Hands down.  If you're a little doubtful about this restaurant, come for the dessert - you'll be glad you did.  We shared five different ones that evening, including the finely sculpted birthday cake they brought out for my mother.  Absolutely amazing!  

Before I conclude this review, there's just a few more things I have to mention:  at the end of dinner, the staff presented my mother with a little birthday gift.

My experience at L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon truly brought a tear to my eye. It's a foodie's dream to be able to eat food by an Executive Chef that was hand picked by the world-renowned Joël Robuchon himself. Before I get into details, here is what I had:

Menu Club - A 5 course menu for $96 per person.

Course 1: LA TOMATE - Chilled tomato gazpacho with croutons

Course 2: LA LANGOUSTINE - Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto

Course 3: LE VEAU - Veal piccata served with arugula salad

Course 4: LES FROMAGES - Selection of cheeses

Course 5: LES TARTES - Traditional tarts

We also added one of their signature dishes - La Caille au Foie Gras - Free-range quail stuffed with foie gras. DIVINE.

And let me tell you something - the absolute best melt-in-you-mouth mashed potatoes I've ever had. My god. I dream of them!

But what made my experience at L'Atelier the most memorable was being able to talk to the Executive Chef. Chef Benjamin probably thought we were crazy -- absolutely going insane over how beautiful and delicious the dishes were that were being served to us. These were true foodies in his restaurant. So what did he do? Yes -- he took the three of us into the back of the house and gave us a tour of the Joël Robuchon kitchen and even introduced us to the Executve Chef. 

Did I mention he let us try the ham? Not just any ham -- THE ham. As in Iberico de Bellota. For those who don't know about this- GOOGLE IT. Quite possibly the most delicate and beautiful piece of food that has ever entered my mouth. It was just so...fabulous. It made my heart melt. To even have the opportunity to try this was a gift. And now I can check it off the bucket list.

It may not have been the best choice for our occasion but we have plenty of intimate fine dining meals, it was nice to change things up.  

I really liked the counter service concept. I've eaten at plenty of counters and watched my food being made; but never food of such a high quality. It was great to see the chefs tediously preparing each course as we were eating the one prior to it. The kitchen's timing was impeccable! After a few courses I could tell when they were preparing our next course by how far along we were on the current dish. This was all done with seemingly clockwork precision. No running around or yelling in this kitchen.

We both had the $155 Seasonal Discovery Menu.

The amuse bouche of avocado and cilantro flavored grapefruit gelee and the turbot filet and baby leeks, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger were real standouts for me' as was the la framboise dessert.

Not-so-hot was the heirloom tomato salad with basil oil and fleur de sel. It was good, but far from spectacular, it seemed like a filler. The foie gras quail was OK but neither of us could taste more than a slight hint of foie gras.

Overall a very good meal. So why four stars instead of five? The price and the portion size.

Perhaps, this is, like all things, both blessing and curse. As the increase of culinary gems also tends to increase my jeans size whilst decreasing my fundage. But I digress.... 

Nothing is more befitting a Yelper Vegas Vacation quite like a visit to a world renowned chef. Especially if that chef is Joel Robuchon. 

To be fair, it was the first night in Sin City and hence, I was forced to ration the amount of gambling money spent on dinner. However, even having purchased the most minuscule of the tasting menus from Vegas Restaurant Week, I found the meal just as fulfilling as if I had hit a blackjack... 

The Tomato Basil salad was great.  
The Short ribs were delectable. 
The desserts (I was able to sample each) were wonderful.

However, the best of the best were the foie gras ravioli in broth that I decided to double down on with my counterpart, Felicia C. 

It's well known in my culinary circles that if Foie was a human, not only would I marry him, I'd chain him in my home and keep him as my personal sex slave so as to partake in his wonders whenever my little heart desired....and I'd desire it quite frequently. 
What can I say, I heart the Foie. 

Now picture, if you will, my lover, in all his silky wonderfulness, encompassed within the best carbohydrate on the planet - pasta. And not just any pasta; light, fluffy, savory pasta.

You can view the kitchen from your seats and watch your food being made and plated, but after awhile, I think I would have preferred to have been seated at a table (with my feet reaching the floor) rather than being perched at a bar.  But hey, that's how the place was designed.

Looking at the 9-course seasonal discovery menu, I thought it was way too much food.  My boy ordered the 5-course menu club (really good from the samples I tried), and me being still considerably full from lunch, took the recommendation from our waiter to select 3 of their small tasting portions.  We were told that 3 would be plenty for one person...wrong! haha

Along the amuse bouche, I ordered the following:

LES TOMATES

Heirloom tomato salad, basil oil and fleur de sel

LES HUITRES
de Kussi pochées dans leur coquille au beurre salé
Poached baby Kussi oysters with French Echiré butter

And for dessert:

Service was warm and friendly, and very attentive and careful whenever reaching over the bar. Everything was delicious (I particularly enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad, the oysters, and the BEST mashed potatoes they serve with your meal), but the portions were extremely small.  I was not even remotely full afterwards.

Are you kidding me! Who in the world would give this a one Michelin star? The food was un-inspiring and some was darn right tasteless. In my whole life, I've never sent a dish back in a 4+ star restaurant, well, that streak has been broken. Since this was the first time we've been to any of Robuchon's restaurants, we decided to try two different tasting menus to experience as much of his cuisine as possible. I ordered the Menu B, which allows me to select 2 appetizers, 2 main courses and 1 dessert. My wife chose their Seasonal Discovery Menu consisting of 11 items. I'll review my menu and let my wife review hers.

1. Amuse-Bouche: foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and Parmesan foam. This is one of their signature dish and it was perfectly blended with a delicate foie gras taste complimented by a sweet port wine with a hint of Parmesan. This was a great start to what I thought would be a great meal.

2. Le Foie Gras: seared foie gras, served with kabocha pumpkin gnocchi and chestnut confit. For a $10 additional supplement, I received 3 small pieces of seared foie gras which tasted like it was seared sometime ago and warmed up with a quick swirl in the pan with the rest of the ingredients. 

3. L'Oignon: onion soup with turmeric spice on top of smooth comté cheese cream. This was the worst onion soup I've ever had. It was completely devoid  of onion taste. I had not choice but to send it back.

4. L'Oeuf De Poulenc: soft fried egg with smoked salmon and winter greens. The greens were crisp, the salmon was tasty, but the eggs did not taste like it was fried at all. This was a replacement for my soup and it was barely adequate.

5. La Morue: cod confit with poached eggplant in a dashi broth with wild mushrooms. The cod was over cooked, the dashi was completely tasteless. The only redeeming grace was the eggplant!

6. Le Canard: roasted duck fillet with sweet and sour pineapple with cilantro. The duck meat was perfectly done and tasty, but I wonder how roast duck can have roasted skin and be soft and non-crispy at all. Was it reheated?

7. Le Chocolat: spiced ""cremeux"" on sage crumbles with ginger ice cream. This was the best thing I had all night. I would come here and pay $15 for this  next time, but sadly to say, I'll never be back.

L'Atelier Joel Robuchon rates as the biggest disappointment from a Michelin rated restaurant. The service was really just par for a 3-star Yelp restaurant, they even forgot my cutlery for one of my course. They put the check in front of me without asking and even sneaked a peek to see how much tip I left before I even got up to leave!

Although it can be pricey, it gives a good assortment of what the menu has to offer.  It was a nine course tasting menu consisting of seven savory courses and two desserts. We also got lucky and had a third dessert tray from the Joel Robuchon side thanks to recognizing one of the servers.  Overall, the service was one of the best I've had. We sat at the bar which is really the way to go because you really experience all of the intricate details that goes into the preparation of the food. We were able to talk to Chef Steve Benjamin and he even ended up giving us a private tour of the Joel Robuchon side which was incredibly beautiful and didn't feel like you were in a casino anymore.  The personal touches that each and every part of the staff have makes you feel incredibly comfortable and makes you want to come back. 

Now on to the food. Where to start. I don't know if I can name all of the courses but I have to say that each were amazing!!! The people I were with RAVE about the mashed potatoes. It's a little rich for my taste but you'll def have to try it. I really enjoyed the foie gras custard and black bean soup. The calamari with sushi rice was super good with the cilantro sauce. The John Dory and cous cous was superb! I have nothing but good things to say about l'Atelier. I can keep going but then this would turn into a book. Definitely a must try!

However, it did not meet or surpass it's brother and neighbor, Joël Robuchon's 3-Michelin-star namesake flagship restaurant, in flavor, decadence, and wow factor.

Whenever I travel, I try to squeeze in one high-end meal. During my last visit to Vegas in October, I decided L'Atelier would be the best fit based on my budget. Reservations were made via OpenTable and we were seated immediately at the counter after checking in with the hostess.

The open kitchen is helmed by Executive Chef Steve Benjamin, providing a unique experience for those sitting at the counter and allowing diners to see the staff work their magic. L'Atelier does mean ""workshop"" after all, and it was fun watching how certain dishes were constructed and beautifully plated. The rest of the restaurant is colored in a sexy red and black theme. After perusing the menu, we each decided on Menu A, which included 4-courses: two appetizers, one main entree, and a dessert. The menu also offers two other prix fixe menus, a tasting menu, and à la carte.

Everything was tasty. There wasn't a dish that I didn't like. Most of the flavors were subtle and all the ingredients worked well together. My favorite appetizer was L'uf de Poule, followed by Le Foie Gras. The first is a crispy semi-soft fried egg with a creamy veloute of black beans and chipotle -- so many flavors and textures working together in harmony made my mouth want to sing and dance. The foie gras came with Kabocha pumpkin gnocchi and chestnut confites, which surprisingly complemented the duck liver. For our mains, both Le Canard and Le Buf were great. Craig P. preferred the roasted duck fillet more, and I really liked the tender glazed beef short ribs. Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes were also served with our mains, which were so soft and fluffy, could easily be mistaken for butter, and actually went great with the bread. The five dessert tarts were a hit or miss and my Framboise (substituted from the regular dessert menu as the prix fixe options weren't appealing to me) was very fun and pretty, however way too sweet. There were unfortunately no mignardises afterwards.

The service was fantastic. My boyfriend joked with our servers, attempting to bring the ""stuffy"" atmosphere down (we were there early, so it was pretty quiet), and the staff responded really well, joshing back with him. We could tell that the staff enjoyed interacting with us way more than the snooty couple next to us, who were quite frankly, pretentious Debbie Downers. The staff was also so great with the menu and knew the dishes and it's ingredients like the palm of their hand.

L'Atelier didn't give me the best meal I've ever had, but still a special and memorable experience nonetheless. If you have a choice between Joël Robuchon or L'Atelier, I'd definitely recommend going with the first. If you're on a budget or want something more casual, L'Atelier will fit that bill nicely and still offer a very fine tasting meal.

The gazpacho was very good, the bread was a bit to hard, the ceviche was ok/good, and the beef carpaccio was oversalted so much that I couldn't finish it (and it was an additional $15 in cost to the standard tasting menu price).  Maybe it was oversalted to ensure that we buy another bottle of evian at $10.  I was asked if I wanted sparking or still water and said still but didnt expect a bottle of evian to be opened up and charged to my bill.  Then towards the end of my meal the waiter asked if I wanted another bottle of evian and when I said no, he poured tap water into my glass already half full with evian... not that I care so much but that was not appropriate.  I almost took $10 off the tip to pay for the bottle that I was forced to purchase.

3755671,2014-02-06,6,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Yup, basically as good as it gets.  Perhaps the best meal of my life thus far, rivaling my meal at Providence in LA and better (in my opinion) than the prix fixe that I had next door for more than twice the price at Joel Robuchon.

Service was impeccable, and the food was SO GOOD.  

I forgot that foie gras is available here in Vegas, unlike back home in California, so my friend and I got practically every foie gras option we could.  

JR next door is prix fixe only and VERY fancy, but this place has a more low-key vibe overall.  You can order from the prix fixe menu, you can order a la carte, or you can mix and match the two.  Our server explained that the a la carte items provide the standout dishes that you can't find on the prix fixe menus, but that the prix fixe menus provide a good (relatively) cost-effective way of trying out some trademark dishes.  There's an open kitchen that's fascinating to watch, and the vibe is way livelier than next door.  

My friend and I opted for the Menu B for $105 (their biggest prix fixe menu that's not the entire menu de degustation (which I believe is around $165, with an optional wine pairing for an additional $105)), along with 3 small tasting items, and it ended up being plenty of food for the two of us.  Menu B provides for an amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a dessert.  

They were nice enough to provide us with two amuse bouches even though we ordered only one prix fixe.  The amuse bouche was a delicious creamy cup of foie gras topped with a parmesan foam.  

For our menu items, we ordered the hamachi, the snapper and the oysters from the small tasting menu, and for our Menu B, we ordered the uni with foie gras, foie gras risotto, beef cheek, and lobster orecchiette. 

The standout dish BY FAR was the uni with foie gras.  OH MY GOD.  Perhaps the best dish I've ever tried in my life.  All the little flavors came together beautifully.   

Otherwise, every other dish was also wonderful and delicious but the uni was definitely the standout star of the meal.  

We finished it off with a dessert called le cafe - once again, it had to be savored together with all the flavors on the dish, and it was amazing.  

Definitely a more fun vibe than stuffy JR next door with food that is just as good.  

Yes, it's pricy, but for one of Joel Robuchon's only 2 restaurants in the US, I'd say it's worth it.",yVwTKNsyh-QXbN9WVHEhww,17,10,5,uteoz3Y4-LkTa_KVpUr2tA

Sitting down at the counter with the open kitchen right in front me so I can view all the action and see my dishes get created.

Foie Gras Parfait with Port Wine Reduction and Parmesan Foam
This was a nice surprise and it was complimentary.  Since I haven't had Foie Gras in a while because of the ban in my state of CA, I really enjoyed it!  Of course this wouldn't be my only taste of Foie Gras for the night.

La Langustine --  http://bit.ly/1z21Cwp
Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto
I wanted to try this out because I saw this on TV from The Best Things I Ever Ate.  It looked so good on TV that I figured it'd be a good complimentary dish to the Le Burger.  Don't let the pic deceive you.  Even though the portion was small, this little lobster was packed with flavor. I also liked how they included some curry powder to give it a little kick as well.

Le Burger  --  http://bit.ly/1z22ocP
Beef and foie gras burgers with caramelized bell peppers
This was really the main reason why I wanted to stop by L""Atelier.  I saw these on a food blog article and thought they looked so fancy that I was so compelled to try them.  Basically these sliders were amazing!  The Foie Gras and Beef Patties just melted in mouth with every bite!  Perfectly cooked!  And another good thing was that they came with frites.  Their housemade gastrique ketchup actually raised my eyebrows because it was a very different flavor than what I expected ketchup to be.  I'd definitely order these again.

I'm not much of a dessert person, but I had my suspicion that their desserts were going to be amazing.  So I went ahead and ordered the La Frambroise.

La Frambroise --  http://bit.ly/1z22QYJ
Fresh raspberry surprise inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream
I give them high marks on presentation with this dessert.  When my server presented it to me, the sphere was perfectly shaped.  Then when they dropped the sauce onto it to break it open to reveal the yuzu ice cream, I was really impressed!  Probably one of the best desserts I had during my trip.

I came to L'Atelier to be impressed and they exceeded my expectations even though I only had just a small sampling of what they had to offer.  And surprisingly, despite the small portions, I left with a full and satisfied stomach.  Having a seat at their counter really provided me a great show and being able to watch the chefs create my entrees just built up the excitement for me.  I would definitely come back again and try their other menus and also maybe go for another round of Foie Gras sliders.

We made a reservation about 3 weeks prior to our trip to Vegas and we had a choice between the restaurant and the L'atelier. Upon reading reviews on yelp, I was confident that the l'atelier, the more casual, sexy restaurant was our best bet. 

Upon arrival we were seated at the bar (the concept was nice, you get to watch the chefs prepare everything right in front of you). The actual execution of it was far from pleasurable as it is rather uncomfortable to sit on the stools for 3 hours while you are consuming your tasting menu.

I opted for the seasonal menu whereas my hubby opted for the four course menu. The food was delicately prepared and watching the head chef (definitely French and very serious-but of course not Joel) you can tell he was a perfectionist. Although each of the dishes in the tasting was good, I would say it was missing  je ne sais quoi component to it. Having had other tasting menu's at French Laundry, Gary Danko's, Michael Minna, etc. I really didn't have that sense of satisfaction that I would have expected for a $400 meal.

I would also say the service while satisfactory, was not exceptional. Our server seemed to be just listing the ingredients and preparation of the food lacking any passion, almost as if he were reading the lines for a role he did not want. I was also slightly put off by the fact that some people were wearing jeans and just very causal wear (I think I may have seen sneakers) as it detracts from the overall ambiance.

There are a lot of positive reviews here for this restaurant but I wanted to share my honest assessment of how I felt about the food, service, overall dining experience. Perhaps if you are going to do ala carte or one of the smaller tastings you may want to come here but if you are really interested in the tasting I would say the restaurant would likely be a better bet than the l'atelier.",TLiv7pKzS1ruZ4rD1ZzhJw,0,0,3,cSkmNWAKxfy0Gd7PgfB3Qg

Complimentary bread and butter- freshly made! Yummy croissants!
Appetizers: I had the raw white fish carpaccio in sesame oil and greens which was refreshing. I also had the asparagus foam soup which was strange to me. My BF had the duck pot stickers and gnocchi. Everything was beautifully plated and looked perfect!
Entrees: I had the pork belly with seasoned cabbage; it was so good! My BF had the duck breast which was so tender; you wouldn't even believe it was from a duck! Complimentary pommes puree (mashed potatoes).

The chefs really know how to make the dishes look like art. It was definitely a great experience! The waiter was really professional and the food was exquisite!

We ended up not eating here because they reserved us a tiny high table which is probably super uncomfortable to sit in. Fastforward to 2015, I decided to come here again since I missed out last time. Since we were staying at The Mansion, we only had to call in an hour before to make a reservation there. The server we had was obnoxious. He looked like he didn't want t serve us and gave us attitude problems since we were dressed casually.  I know it's a classy place, but we were polite towards him and we didn't have a change of clothes since it was a last minute reservation. Anyway, I have been to my fair share of expensive restaurants and servers were always humble. I wasn't happy with the amount of space we were given.

Since we walked into this place still quite drunk from the Sterling Brunch, we decided to skip the wine pairings and be the gluttons we are and go for the 9-course Seasonal Discovery Menu. I'll break it down by dish this time...

We started off with the L'Amuse-Bouche. According to our server this was to ""freshen"" up our palate. Grapefruit gelee that was flavored with avocado and cilantro. It was very refreshing, but the girlfriend wasn't a fan. I enjoyed it. But the most fascinating part was watching the chefs make the darn dish. Their attention to detail is unmatched, they used tweezers to put the freakin cilantro on the dish! Amazing!

The Le Crabe Royale was king crab on a turnip disc with a sweet and sour sauce.  This dish wasn't a standout but the flavor was amazing. The plating was wonderful as well.

The La Saint-Jacques was one of the GF's favorites. I liked it but my favorites are to come. It was a sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil. The scallop was cooked to perfection, not that I was expecting anything less of course. 

The La Cebette reminded me of a little tiny bite-sized pizza (like a sophisticated thin crust bagel bite). It was a white onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus. This was delicious the asparagus went so well with the smoked bacon! 

Mystery dish. I forgot the name and I forgot what exactly was in it... but it was both of ours FAVORITE DISH. It was some sort of foamed emulsion over a perfectly cooked poached egg yoke and pesto sauce topped with paprika and straw mushrooms. There were instructions on how to eat it... that means its good.

The La Sole was simple but good. It was a dover sole filet, baby leek with ginger.  I once tried to cook sole... trust me... Joel Robuchon's version was way better.

We had choices for our ""main dish"" I got the La Caille. The Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with truffled-mashed potatoes. The truffled mashed potatoes were a gift from God. It was a delicious dish and I think this was #2 on the best list. Thinking about it though... its like swapping body parts... duck liver in a quail. HA.

The other half got the L'Agneau, which was a Lamb shoulder confit and steam garbanzo beans as her main dish. She loved this dish, I wasn't a big fan of it... I thought my La Caille was better. 

On to dessert. La Peche. Summer peaches on basil sable and coconut milk emulsion.  This plate looked like a painting, it was beautiful. It had a hard sugar candy disc sitting on top of the dish with gold powder dusted on the plate in turtle shell type pattern. The caramelized popcorn also added a nice touch to the dish as well.

I personally liked the La Fraise because for some darn reason it reminded me of my childhood, I don't know how but it did. It was white chocolate ice cream on an almond panna cotta, fresh strawberries and mint. Great flavor, fresh, and light.

To top it all off we had Le Cafe. Coffee with one dark chocolate candy stuffed with rasberry filling. This was probably the best coffee I have ever had... but that could just be me getting hypnotized by Joel Robuchon because I paid so damn much for it.

I just noticed that I broke down my whole meal, which is most likely not very helpful for many yelpers since it is a ""seasonal"" menu and will most likely change.... now. Hopefully this review was helpful though! Service, Ambiance, Food, and Experience were all WONDERFUL! No complaints or disappointments.

First off the dining experience is wonderful- open kitchen and you can interact with others around you.  We started with the crispy langostine- perfect, light and crispy.  Then the mini sliders- this was a 2 biter that I took 6 bites to savor each and every bite.

I was prepared to be disappointed..but it turns out that all my preparation was unnecessary. L'atelier de Joel Robuchon was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had. We decided against the tasting menu since my wife and i were kind of full from the free alcohol at the casino. We opted for the prix fixe menu A instead. The amuse' bouche was a glass filled with foam and foie gras at the bottom of the glass. After my first bite I realized this meal was going to be quite yummy. My favorites   were a snapper carpaccio, and some sort of veal dumpling that my wife ordered. The latter being the best thing i've ever eaten. EVER. Most everything else was delicious as well.. I was a little disappointed in the gnocchi with foie gras, i thought it was only ""pretty good"". The service was also excellent, the meal took about 2 hours, but i think that this was deliberate. Our server asked if we had time constraints, and seeing as we were on vacation.. we had no where important to be.

I ordered the 4 course and added a seared foie gras at the ridiculous price of $39. It was as good of a slice of seared foie gras as any, but wasn't worth the extra...say $15-19. My gripes end there...as it was a fantastic meal.

3846628,2017-02-12,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I have been going to l'atelier de joel robuchon since it opened at the MGM and each time get better and better. I have been to the Paris and NY locations many times but the LV restaurant is far superior. 

The service (starting from the lovely host stand) to all the wait staff is top notch and clearly trained by a master. It makers for the most pleasant experience and environment. 

The service starts with a offering of champagne or wines by the glass that are wonderful. The wine list is extensive and filled a nice assortment of French, Napa, and some new world. We started off with glasses of delamotte champagne, that was really nice and dry and then had 1s cru burgundy and Sancerre. All were exquisite and perfectly paired. 
 
Food-wise, they always start you off with when he homemade breads and real French butter that you basically want to bathe in. That's alway a highlight to Amy JR restaurant. The amuse buche follows that up and it's whipped foie gros with some red wine reduction. I don't really enjoy it and it's the one item that could be changed as they have been serving it for waaay to long. 

The menu is split up into 2 large seasonal tasting menus, ala carte menus and then smaller pre fix menus that are lower prices and easier for 1st time guest.  I highly recommend choosing from the ala carts menus as the best of the best are on that portion. 

What we ordered today were the langoustines that are wrapped in fill dough with micro basil inside. To say this is the most delicious langoustine you will ever eat, is an understatement. It's mindblowingly melt in your mouth.  

Then we always get the Iberico ham with the side of crostini that they put micro basil and tomato. Its the perfect amount of acid for all the fatty pork goodness. Holy smokes!! Once you taste real Iberico ham, you won't go back. 

We also had the smoke salmon with the potato and chèvre cheese that also has some bitter greens and horseradish. It was a beautifully deconstructed latke with salmon....I couldn't eat it fast enough!

We then followed up with hang steaks and they new mushroom dish that for any vegetarian, this would be faultless. The meatiness of the mushrooms with the butter sauce and greens were unbelievable. The hanger was good and we had it before, but not as special as the other dishes. Both of those came with the famous JR potatoes. I can barely eat them anymore but if you have never gone, you must try. It's his most famous dish (everywhere you taste something similar now, know it's a copy from here). It's basically mash potato mousse but the ratio to better and potatoes is 50/50...crazy, but oh so good. 

For dessert, we wanted something light and had the mango mousse with homemade coconut sorbet. Perfect palate cleanser. 

Like I said before, I have been a huge fan of JR four about 15yrs now have gone to many of his locations , including next door at his flag ship and this is by far my favorite. Patrick, our usual server couldn't be better and more professionally and Oscar, the waiter and busser is the best!

I can't recommend enough for special occasions, but try to go for anytime and don't feel insecure about just ordering a few dishes to share and try. It's a wonderful experience and something that you don't see often enough anymore.",UjFMeqhGaY-lCevVKux2KQ,0,0,5,LZ6yF0RWsFjh-_G9o5fatQ
3847010,2016-08-29,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"My boyfriend and I had the best night here. We had a reservation for here a couple hours after we landed in Vegas. The whole staff was very attentive and very involved with us.

You sit at a bar type seating arrangement, with a kitchen overlook so you can watch the chefs make everything in front of you, which we really enjoyed. Very exciting. Every cook has the most detail-oriented mindset and you can watch them become very entranced in the piece of work they are putting on each plate.

We ordered some special drinks and then decided on the Chef's Tasting Seasonal Menu. Best decision we made. From other reviews on this place, I quickly decided that going forward with the tasting menu was the way to go with a place like this. You get more for your money. And since you already planned on spending a lot for the night, you might as well try everything you can in a sitting since you won't be back tomorrow or next weekend. That was definitely the way to go, order the tasting menus, any of them. You can decide on A, B or C I believe. And then there was a seasonal tasting menu while we were there in July (don't know if that is always the case). With the optional tasting menus, you choose what appetizers and entrees and desserts you want to taste off of the list. With the Chef Seasonal, everything is picked out, pieces the Chef designed personally. We loved every course out of al 10 of them...yes 10. Technically 12 if I think about it. Needless to say, we had a hard time walking after leaving the restaurant 3 hours later.

That's the other thing..this is definitely a whole night event. If you're looking for a quick nice dinner before you go out for the night, this isn't the place for it. You will be here awhile. Especially if you get a tasting menu. The staff gives you time in between each course (thank God) so you can enjoy each course and not scarf down your plate and be on your way. Plan to be here for a couple hours, especially if you plan on getting everything out of this place that you can. 

Each course was perfection, I didn't expect much less considering how highly rated this was, and the fact that Joel de Rubuchon is known for their amazing skills and creativity. But the flavor on each plate was so pleasantly surprising because you don't expect a burst of spice and flavor from something like a radish salad, but they will surprise you.

Overall, fantastic. Considering both Ryan a I had yet to try French food, this was a perfect pick for our first time.",5AhF9d_s2AQtwDlEfQptIA,2,2,5,Hs79tYStKdfMvDWR1uLI9Q

*Portions are TINY. Prices are HIGH. But you're in Vegas... INDULGE*

I went with 3 other girl friends. Decor is beautiful. Black & red with tons of fresh red roses all over. Loved it. 

Service was impeccable. Just the right amount of friendliness and politeness. There wasn't much waiting, and the server was willing to help us out with anything. 

They have pre fix menus, but you can also order a la carte. They have small plates to share or regular entrees. 

From their bread basket, you must try their croissant. It's tiny, about the size of my fist (I have tiny fists). Buttered and sprinkled with sea salt. I wish they had just given me a basket of those. 

I ordered the small plate, Foie Gras Stuffed Quail with Truffle Mashed Potatoes. OMG, those mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had. The texture was amazingly smooth and creamy. Absolutely melted in your mouth, and the flavors were right on the mark. Enough to coat your tongue and linger, then disappear so that you can dig in for another bite. Quail and Foie Gras were rich and delicious too, but those mashed potatoes... heavenly. No joke. No exaggeration. 

My friend ordered the Lobster entree for $70. It wasn't enough to be filling, but I'm sure it was of the best quality. 

My other friend ordered the Carbonara, which was definitely filling. Probably the largest sized entree at the table. However... it is just pasta. I didn't taste it, but it looked fine. 

My other friend ordered the Macaroni. Don't expect mac 'n' cheese. It's asparagus wrapped in a light thin sheets of pasta and some sauce. It's tiny with only 2 pieces. However... it was probably made from the best quality ingredients. 

DESSERT was absolutely stunning. I ordered the Framboise. A white chocolate sphere (painted red) with yuzu ice cream on the inside. They bring a cup of warm raspberry sauce and pour it over your dessert, causing the sphere to shrivel and melt and reveal the yuzu ice cream. Absolutely beautiful, and even more delicious. I LOVE yuzu ice cream, and the balance of sweet, tart, and citrus was perfect. I ate every bite, and I could've licked the plate clean if I were allowed. 

My friend ordered the Ice Cream & Sorbet dessert that came with an assortment. Just 1 quenelle of each flavor, so you'll be begging for more when you're done. The flavors we got were: Pistachio (wonderful), Malt (different), Vanilla Bean (SO good, considering it's just vanilla, but you can tell they use REALLY good vanilla beans), Raspberry Sorbet (tart), and Coconut (Good). My friends loved the pistachio and malt, and I loved the coconut. In any case, no matter the flavor, the textures were perfect.

3890822,2013-12-31,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"A friend who works at Le Bernadin in NYC told me he ate one of the best meals of his life here, so naturally that was all the recommendation I needed to make a reservation for my first night in Vegas (sent alone on business for a couple days)

The night started off a bit rocky - I was a few minutes late for a 9pm reservation, and was told it would be 20-30 minutes because they were running behind, and I could come back.  I've never been told that so matter-of-factly with no apology before at ANY restaurant in ANY city when I had actually made a reservation, so naturally I was a little pissed.  Also, I had booked it there so I was hot and sweaty and thirsty, and I was tired and hungry because I had just flown in from the east coast and it was midnight my time.  Go wander around the casino for 30 minutes and hope a seat will be ready then?  No thanks.  After looking around for a minute aimlessly trying to figure out what I wanted, I realized what it was - water.  I was obviously quite annoyed and I think it came through to the hostess when I asked if I could at least have some water, so after she popped inside and came back out (there is no where to wait in the restaurant itself - the hostess stand is outside of it in the casino), and asked me if I wanted to wait at the back bar until my reservation was ready.  OF COURSE.  Thank you.  Maybe offer that in the first place to someone dining alone when their reservation is going to be at least 30 minutes late?  Hostess(es) could use a little more training.

So, i grabbed one of the three seats at the back bar area and promptly downed a glass of water.  I really enjoy chatting up strangers when I'm traveling alone, and the man working the bar (Tedman - a unique name for sure) quickly became my buddy for the evening.  He brought me some bread, and we chatted about this and that, 30 minutes later my ""reservation"" seat still wasn't ready, but I also realized that if I moved over to the main bar area overlooking the kitchen, I'd really be eating a very long meal truly alone, because the servers there would be super busy.  I said to Tedman, ""Man I wish I could just eat back here so we can keep hanging out,"" and he replied, ""Do you want to?""  OF COURSE I DO!!!  I didn't even know that was an option!!  DAMN IT!

I was super happy to continue hanging out with Tedman while he made drinks for the restaurant, and while I had intended to do one of the smaller tasting menus, everything I really wanted to try was on the Discovery Tasting menu ($185), and I just couldn't resist.  Best.  Decision.  Ever.  A few of the highlights:

-The bread basket. Oh, god, the bread basket.  Those fluffly little croissant like spirals - I will dream of them.  So, so, so good. The butter flown in from france that comes with it?  AAAAAAAAH FEED ME BUTTER.

-The foie gras parfait - you mean a foie gras pudding cup?  Um, yes please.

-The oysters - I don't eat oysters.  I don't like oysters.  I've never had an oyster I liked.  I downed these three in 10 seconds flat.  Might have been because they were swimming in French salted butter.  

-The white onion tart was one of the best composed, flavorful, and interesting dishes I've had in any restaurant, anywhere.  Didn't hurt that it was covered in black truffles ;)

-The foie gras ravioli - ooooh goooooood little nuggets of juicy foie gras heaven (are you sensing that I like foie gras?). And I had to sit on my hands not to drink the rest of the broth straight from the bowl so I didn't fill up.

I'll add I was a little disappointed in the foie gras stuffed quail.  It was a little too sweet, and I couldn't really taste the foie gras all that much.  However, the mashed potatoes that came with it - HOLY WOW.  Best mashed potatoes I've ever, ever had.  Clearly 50% butter.

At some point the manager - Ben - was standing back in that area surveying his restaurant, and we started chatting.  And...basically we didn't stop.  Every moment he had while he keenly observed his staff and well-oiled machine of a restaurant, he was back hanging out with me - talking about the food, his family, our lives, our plans.  Between Ben and Tedman it was not only an amazing meal, but an amazing experience.  They both really seemed to like watching me enjoy the food so much, they brought me a second bread basket with cheesy bread that I ""had to try"" and more of my favorite little pinwheels from next door, and in between my two dessert courses also brought me a dessert sampler from the candy cart at The Mansion.  Ben also grabbed me before I left and gave me an unsolicited tour of the kitchen both restaurants share.  It was a wonderful gift, and an awesome cap to an amazing experience, and phenomenal meal. Thank you Ben!

3897582,2017-03-07,6,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Let me start by caveating that I rarely dine at this level of fine dining establishment. Having said that, I did my homework prior to making our reservation so I knew what to expect. Translation...I knew it was expensive and I was fine with this because it was time to step out of my comfort level....ok, it's vegas...what I really mean is it was just time to double down and go all in!

We chose the pre-fix dinner menu at $58 for two courses. Realize that 90% of the items on the menu have a surcharge ranging from $5 to $35. So realistically you are probably looking at paying a minimum of $75 even with this ""good deal.""   Wine prices are pretty high so we opted for a $95 bottle of wine.....still high but it was delicious. I was surprised that the sommelier seemed surprised at our chardonnay choice mentioning that it was quite full bodied and oaky/buttery. We responded that we liked that style. Surprisingly, it was more medium bodied but really was a good choice. I looked it up online and it ranges from $35 to $45 a bottle so I would say that their pricing of 2.5 times is probably fair by Vegas dining standards. 

Everyone in our group loved their dishes. Fortunately I got to try the onion tart which was insanely delicious. Who knew an onion tart with egg and asparagus could taste like that?  My appetizer of hangar steak was melt in your mouth and quite a good size for an appetizer. The $35 upcharge for the Malabar filet was worth every penny. The pepper was not overpowering and the filet was a good size. We didn't think the John Dory fish had an upcharge but after reviewing the receipt after leaving we noticed we were charged an extra $10 for that. 

The lobster pasta was another delicious appetizer. The only dish that was slightly disappointing was my quail stuffed with foie gras. The leg bone in portion was juicy but the boneless portion stuffed with the foie gras seemed a bit dry and I couldn't taste the foie. Oh and that reminds me....the amuse bouche of foie gras tasted almost like dessert....another hit.  Finally, how do they make bread that tastes like you are eating it in Paris straight out of a boulangerie?

Service was good but they lost a star for the quail and one other slightly picky thing. The counter bar stools don't have much of a back so you have to lean forward or sit straight up. I would certainly not be able to eat in this type of chair had we done the 2-3 hour tasting menu. There aren't many tables so when making a reservation you would need to stipulate your desire for a table. 

Also, the portion sizes don't all fit their category. For example, my hangar steak appetizer was actually larger than the quail main entree. I would like to try the tasting menu one day but would definitely not sit at the counter even though you can see the ""show"" of the chefs plating the dishes. Another recommendation is to either show your M Life card or put the bill on your room if you are staying at the Mandalay Bay.

Our cities seem to compete to see who can claim ""fattest city"" like it's a prize and once they receive the title, it dawns on them that gee, maybe they have a problem and should encourage their residents to stop stuffing their faces with deep fried fat droppings.  So, it's no wonder that after our delicious meal at French-inspired, smaller portioned, L'Atelier, we Americans were left craving more food, in hopes of having to roll our newly rotund selves out the door.  

I dined at L'Atelier during Restaurant Week.  For the occasion, they offered a special 4-course tasting menu.  It began with an amuse-bouche that set the stage for a fantastic meal.  Don't ask me what it was called, 'cause I'll butcher it. What I can tell you is that it was layered with cream and lobster essence.  With each spoonful I could taste a different, delightful flavor. The chef got was off to a great start and my bouche was amused (sorry, I had to).  The first course was a gazpacho.  My tomato-hating heart fell at the sight of gazpacho on the menu.  Why, someone please tell me why, people insist on trying to make me eat pureed tomatoes?  Do you want me to be sick?  Why not just throw some mushy okra innards in there to put me over the top?  Don't you want me to be happy?  But, I decided to suck it up and try the gazpacho.  I have to admit, and remember this is coming from someone who'd rather throw tomatoes at Dane Cook than eat them, it was pretty damn good. I only took a couple of sips and then pushed it away, but if you can make me appreciate gazpacho, you've done your job.  

The second course was by far my favorite - the langoustine.  Oh crustaceans, how I love to eat thee.  I'm sorry, but I do.  I was in heaven.  A lightly, tempura-style, breaded strip of langoustine along with a basil pesto.  We were only served one each, much to my dismay. In fact, my dismay was so strong that each time I saw a server walk by with langoustine for another table, it was all I could to do keep myself from lunging at him to grab it off the tray in one quick dive.  But, I must be a lady, so I refrained.  Also, I wasn't dressed for lunging and diving, it would be even less appropriate if one of my chest balloons fell out in the midst of a food grab.  

The third course consisted of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever tasted - they practically melted in my mouth.  Accompanying the pommes was a perfectly seasoned beef rib-eye.  When I say perfectly seasoned I mean that I didn't have the urge to be uncouth and ask for steak sauce.  It wasn't necessary.  It was so good that I was almost tempted to eat the fatty portions of the beef and the thought of eating fat disgusts me, but I had to have more.  Forget being ladylike, I ate some of the fat and when I noticed that one of my friends didn't finish his potatoes, I asked if I could have them. Oh yes, I did.  

For the final course (tear), we were served a soufflé with pistachio ice cream poured down the center tableside.  The soufflé wasn't my favorite - it was done very well, very light and fluffy - but, it just didn't wow me.  I did enjoy the pistachio ice cream on the other hand; it was an inspired combination.

The presentation was picturesque.  I loved the atmosphere at L'Atelier - it was warm, cozy and swathed in dark red.  It was upscale without being stuffy.  Our server was accommodating (substituting lactose-free items for the milk-hating stomachs), and informative (explaining to the less experienced foodies like myself, what exactly a langoustine is).

Thus, while I and some of my dining companions left L'Atelier wanting more, and ruminating over the porkiness of Americans, I would definitely love to return, and perhaps wear some clothing more suited for food diving.",hoPA4iBItEUMWUH7bIqrmA,20,19,5,66tqaWt8_aWSNGzFFeswrw

3923412,2017-05-09,3,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"What an embarrassing debacle at L'Atelier... I'll try to keep this short:

1) Had 8:30pm reservation, flight delayed, called in and changed to 9:30pm
2) Got seated, waiter overhead us discussing tasting menu, immediately said it's ""too late""
3) Surprised b/c they were still taking reservations until 10pm (on OpenTable even!) and no one said anything about tasting being unavailable when we called in earlier
4) Asked waiter if he could double-check since the whole point was to do tasting menu; waiter returned, told us no and that's Chef's ""final answer""
5) Waiter then said we had ""three minutes"" to order - even off the a la carte menu - and yes, exact words, not 'soon' or even 'five minutes', but ""three minutes""
6) That gave us impression that we were not welcome, so we walked out
7) To her credit, hostess who seated us asked us what was wrong, and we told her what happened
8) Hostess went inside, came back out and said manager said we can do tasting menu
9) We were still really uncomfortable with the whole charade, so left anyway

So ultimately, I suppose we could have done the tasting menu? But looking back at what happened, my only conclusion is that they didn't really want to serve us. It took us physically leaving the restaurant just to be allowed to order the tasting menu, and on top of that, the manager knew we were unhappy and didn't even bother coming out to say anything to us.

It's a real shame as I've been to the big Robuchon in MGM a few times and L'Atelier in Covent Garden and thought they were pretty good - but I can safely say after this experience that I no longer feel welcome at any Robuchon restaurant.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,8,0,1,mqrvzORjrL9bkPhUOPGEMg

3936528,2010-12-30,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Now this place is legit! I came here last June with a friend of mine, Michelle C., while we were visiting Las Vegas for the weekend. I was so excited about dining here because I had heard of this place on Yelp actually. People just raved about the food and atmosphere here that I had to come check it out for myself. 

The food is very expensive here, but definitely cheaper than eating next door at Joel Robuchon's Mansion. When I first arrived to L'Atelier I immediately was amazed by the ambiance and decor; very sophisticated and modern. You have the option of sitting up at the bar area over looking the open kitchen or at a table. My friend and I both love to cook so we had made a reservation ahead of time for the bar area since we heard that it's more fun and interactive versus sitting at a table. 

Our waiter brought out some delicious bread to start off with. This was probably the best basked of bread I've ever had the pleasure of eating while waiting for my dinner to be prepared. It was a variety of different rolls and they were all very good, soft, and buttery. 

While our food was being prepared our waiter brought us a complimentary tomato gazpacho soup with a balsamic reduction, baby croutons, and basil. Best gazpacho I've ever had! 

For dinner I had ordered a crab salad, which was so delicious. The crab was very fresh and they served large chunks of it over a bed of butter lettuce with freshly shaved parmesan cheese and a light vinaigrette. I also ordered this asparagus, bacon, and gruyere cheese tart. The tart was similar to a puff pastry and with the bacon, asparagus, and melted gruyere cheese on top it just melted in my mouth. The combination of flavors were wonderful. 

My friend had ordered the Seasonal Discovery Menu which consisted of 9 courses. She must have been crazy when ordering this because 9 courses is just insane. She wasn't about to finish all 9 courses and was defeated by the 7th course (my favorite course actually). Because there was so much food I luckily got to try most of her dishes. Yay for me! My favorites would have to have been the Foie Gras Stuffed Free-Range Quail with Truffled Mashed Potatoes and the Sea Scallop Topped with Chive Oil. Both dishes were excellent and those truffled mashed potatoes were probably the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. 

I had absolutely no room for dessert at this point so I finished off my meal with an espresso, which was mighty tasty. Michelle C. was given two desserts on top of her 9 course meal, but couldn't even eat them because she was so full. 

To make a long story short this dining experience was one I'll always remember. Lots of good food and a good time. I will definitely go back to L'Atelier when I return to Las Vegas and maybe next time I'll take on the 9 course Seasonal Discovery Menu myself.",-0ZytDkE0eowSYqcxgvxTA,2,2,5,B991YdqcN2LkI0qqwVZd7A

The service was outstanding. The server explained to us that almost no employees have ever left in over 10 years.

The quail was literally smaller than a chicken nugget lol. I read about some mashed potatoes that were mind blowing.. UMMM? they were mashed potatoes that tasted like regular mashed potatoes !  I know he is the chef of the century but although this was one of the most expensive meals in Vegas it was not the best at all.

3955659,2012-07-06,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"If I ran good at the casinos, I wouldn't mind going for that discovery menu. But too bad, so my date and I dined here for my birthday dinner. We both ordered the $78 menu, which includes an appetizer, a soup, a fish or a meat entree, and a dessert. They do offer a $105 menu where you can have both the meat and the fish. Glad that I didn't, I was just too full with one entree.

My entire dining experience was amazing. I felt like I was sitting through an art show. Every dish was like an art piece. I really didn't want to mess up the presentation but I wanted to try how it tasted too. I ordered the beef cheeks, spinach soup, red snapper with cuttlefish and baby octopus, and ended the meal with a strawberry compote. My date ordered the asparagus, tomato gazpacho, pork belly with caramelized onions, and the traditional tarts.

I started my meal off with a 5 Alive, it's a citrus drink with two flavored vodka. It's decently strong for a mixed drink, I felt a bit whoosy when I was halfway done. It's quite thick and flavorful. It wasn't too sweet at all. I had the choice between an iBerry and this, my server recommended this over the iBerry so I went along with it. Not a bad choice.

You can easily find my meals posted in the pictures. I loved the beef cheeks, spinach soup, and my dessert. My friend described my beef cheeks as planting in first grade, you can see sprouts and beets stuck into my beef cheek that was pulled into small pieces but woven together like a patty. It's definitely cute and summery. My soup was interesting, the top layer was foam-like and then the bottom was like a gelatin/pudding. It was light and flavorful and very fun to eat! My snapper was good, but not as flavorful as I wished. I should have chosen the pork belly, it was just so tender and soft and juicy and rich. It's okay, my strawberry compote beats my date's tarts any day! 

My strawberry compote had sorbet in the center, with two pieces of sweet, crispy pepper skin coming out of it and making a circle. My bowl had a pattern created by gold powder. I seriously don't want to break this but I've got to try it. It was quite tarty and light. You have so many different texture in just one dessert. The whole experience was just amazing!

Not only that, just as I started eating my compote, our server and the rest of the staff at the restaurant surprised me with a birthday dessert. They gave me Le Chocolat, which had chocolate cream at the bottom, oreo crumbs with vanilla creme, then top it with a golden chocolate plate dotted with passionfruit filling. The writing on the side with the fruit filling was better than my own handwriting. The staffs had pretty good vocals too :) 

Best birthday dinner ever, I do want to come back soon for that discovery menu! Let's hope that I run better at the casino next time.",w3iXYLy7b89aoDxfU96i5g,3,1,5,L58qRXro-jUiWxIPAVWfpA
3968946,2012-04-16,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This was my first visit, and probably the most expensive meal I've ever had. Our friend was having a bachelor party, and he's a huge big foodie. I've only had fine dining once before at no cost, so this was a big deal. We had reservations, and came decked out in dressy attire. We were seated immediately and there was no wait at all. Very nice.

I would say this place is very small and intimate. It makes sense if you're going to be sharing a meal between good company. The place is black and red themed, and every detail from the chairs, tables, utensils, to the decor was beautiful. The environment was calm with the kitchen behind the bar.

3 people out of the 5 at the table had the famous 9 course meal, while myself and my other friend decided we would be on one ticket and order a couple things together to ""save"" a bit of money.

The bread and butter that was provided was beautiful and delicious as well. It was a mixed of small french bread and croissants.

The wait staff was great. Every time something came out, they cleaned off the dining area and set things up perfectly. Also because some of the food was intricate, they would explain to us how we should eat it.

Between the two of us, we ordered the: Fingerling, Deg Carpaccio, Le Saumon Fume, La Caille, La Menthe, La Pomme, Cappucino, and a Latte. Each individually ranged as low as 15 to 47 dollars each. Our bill came out to 199.99. 

If you're sharing to be ""economical"", order at least 5 items to get properly filled up.

The dishes were properly placed well marking well in presentation, execution, and flavor.

The desserts were very unique and delicious. Each had a different interesting plating that was unique to the dessert itself. I was recommended to get the banana and strawberry combo. It was extremely good, and came in a tiny ceramic black bench with a 3/4 sphere with the food inside.

I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but what they had gave us was pretty dang good.

This place isn't my style or audience, but for our to be married bachelor at the moment, it was for him. He thoroughly enjoyed the experience. His brother had the smart idea to ask our waiter if he could get an autographed menu from the chefs. They were more than happy to full fill the request and brought out the menu's with small personal messages and signature in a nice envelope.

Service wise, is TOP NOTCH. They are very informative, helpful, and not overbearing at all. They have a very diverse staff, and they make you feel comfortable and welcomed.

For the price you pay, you are primarily paying for the experience. Our meal took about almost 3 hours to go through all the dishes. But as long as there is good company, that 3 hours was great.",SwyHccVzUDVH_Je4XBuSYA,0,0,4,L_DJ2SfNBiqygcAD1oVHTw

SPLURGING time!  Happy Anniversary to us.  In Vegas, most couples want to gamble, party, drink....all we wanted  was some FOIE GRAS.  We decided to treat ourselves to our very first Michelin rated restaurant, owned by Chef of the Century, Joel Robuchon.  This location is more casual and affordable than The Mansion next door (Michelin 3 star). I'd say try this first, then work your way up! 
My senses were beaming in this fine establishment!

SEE: A red & black motif.  Great view of the kitchen with COUNTER seating. Watch your chef cook & construct your plates ever so delicately.  A show in itself.  Eye catching food presentation!  Chef Steve Benjamin was spotted greeting some frequents. 

FEEL:  Love is in the air. Couldnt help but feel blessed and spoiled.
Counter seats weren't the most comfy. Especially, since most ladies had dresses and heels on.  A hint of snootiness in the air too. 

HEAR: Humbling sound of pots and pans clonking & clanging in the kitchen. Chiming wine glasses/bottles and ""ting ting"" from our silverware.  Waiters giving detailed description of the menu/dishes.  A relaxing ambiance with personal conversations and laughter.  

SMELL:  Butter, garlic, grilling, citrus....a plethora of sweet, nutty and rich aroma.    

TASTE:  The Seasonal Discovery Tasting Menu  (9 dishes) w/ pairing ($165 + $105) for the hubs.  My initial plan was to try 2-3 recommended appetizers.  But, the portion size sounded so small and I was starving.  So, I opted for their MENU A option ($78). I admit, I was going for quantity, since I wasn't too excited about my options.  I ended up paying an extra $10 for two of their upgraded options.   

**HIGHLIGHTS from Seasonal Discovery Menu**
-La Saint-Jacques: scallop carpaccio on the shell w/ lemon vinaigrette: fresh, light and fragrant. Nice starter. 
-Le Foie Gras:  OMG!  This by far was their best dish.  Imagine a savory chicken broth flan/custard with duck foie gras.  A great balance of light texture w/ rich flavors.  Delicious!  Different from anything I've ever tasted.  OUR FAVE. 
-La Caille:  caramelized free range quail stuffed with foie gras. Holy cow.   It came with the creamiest mashed  potatoes EVER.  Delicious. 

**HIGHLIGHTS from  dishes I selected for Menu A**
-Amuse-Bouche:  Custard foie gras w/ parmesean  foam.  Mmm...mmm good. INSTANT GRATIFICATION.  
-La Dorade:  snapper carpaccio w/ lemon vinaigrette. Very similar to the scallop carpaccio, but had a bolder flavor. This was better!   
-Les Tartes:  With a very generic description, this option sounded boring at first.  I am SO HAPPY I chose it. Pastry Chef Salvatore Martone definitely delivered.  With 5 completely different tarts to sample, I was in heaven.  The crusts  were light and buttery.  They each had their featured ingredients ranging from pistachio, peanuts, chocolate and pineapple cream cheese. PINEAPPLE CHEESECAKE was my FAVE; by far the lightest and most fragrant cheesecake you will ever taste.    

NOT A FAN:  
-Le Veau: veal ravioli (additional $10): It was good, but nothing special. 
-Les Pates: spiced Main lobster over orecchiette pasta (additional $10): a good amount of fresh lobster chunks. Lobster was seasoned well and cooked just right; had a nice bite to it. 
**I love pasta and usually gravitate towards these dishes.  But, I need to remember that I am in a French restaurant.  Gotta Stick to my gut and order what the French are famous for.  Both pastas were too al dente for me.  Sad to say, it wasn't anything special.**

SERVICE: Very proper and courteous.  We were lucky to receive a complimentary chocolate soufflé w/ ""happy anniversary"" fired on the chocolate piece. SWEET!  Our waiter forgot hubby's last wine and felt horrible about it.  We ended up w/ 3 dessert wines.  Haha!  

We had a fantastic time and were stuffed beyond belief.  The culprit: THE assortment of BREAD!   I fell in love w/ their buttery croissant like bread and butter.  Very noteworthy part of my night 

TID BITS: 
1) Located in MGM Grand Hotel near the KA theater.  
2) Dress however you want. It's Vegas.  Most ladies were in dresses and men in collared shirts (short/long).  
3) Not kid friendly
4) Make a reservation.",loXavxKqdcIgrQeX1GSWUw,20,15,5,fQRz2EHBCSH_UsEdV5a7aA

On my last trip to Vegas, I tried profusely to make reservations on the MGM website for L'atelier, but failed!   Three Michelin Star Chef Joel Robuchon's L'atelier is beautiful and sleek, filled with black and bright red accents, and colorful fruit and vegetable shape decor.  I needed to go! Since I'm not eating at the Mansionuntil I win the lottery, I was determined to eat at L'atelier! So, we walked right up to the hostess and demanded to be seated right now or else!  And it worked!  Yah, right. I don't want to be blacklisted forever from Mr. Robuchon's world!  He holds the key to the Mansion.

We waited about an hour and half for a seat at the bar. I thought we were going to be treated like second class citizens, who sits at the counter at a French restaurant?!  It's because we're yellow! I know it!!  I know it!!! 

But, I was wrong! It's the best seat in the house! 

At most fine dinning restaurants, I always feel like a 8 year old kid wearing her mommy's dress, heels and makeup, looking ridiculous, sitting nice and straight, drinking water with her pinky up, pretending to be an adult.  The bar seating at L'atelier created a world of unpretentious fine dinning, removing the stuffiness out of fine French restaurants yet creating warmth from the close proximity of the chaotic cooks working together to provide delicious meals and fellow foodies taking in each dish with all their senses. In fact, I was able to have greatconversation with my neighbors about their food and get recommendations as they were eating. I had to stop myself from grabbing my fork and stealing a bite of their food.  

After our 15 minute conversion, don't I know you well enough for you to give me a piece of steak?  Pretty please??

I was overwhelmed with the menu and since I had been donating $$ to casinos all weekend, I went with the summer prix fixe menu for $75 instead the discovery menu for $149. 

It included:
Amuse-Bouche! - foie gras with port reduction and form Parmesan served in a shot glass. I took a spoon full and closed my eyes as the salty Parmesan, foie gras and sweet port hit my palette and partied in my mouth.  Loved it.  

Les Legumes - Layers of tomato, eggplant, zucchini with Buffalo Mozzarella and dabs of Basil puree on the side.  All the vegetables were well seasoned.  Each layer of vegetables brought a different dimension to the dish. I loved the tomato confit. It was very sweet and tasty.

La Langoustine - Crispy Langoustine Fritter with Basil Pesto.   Tissue thin fried batter wrapped around a sweet Norway lobster. Yum.  It was nice and crispy. Although, it tasted 100 x better after I figured out that the micro-salad had a purpose other than decoration.  One piece of La Langoustine + a few piece of micro salad + a dab of basil pesto = a good favor combination of fresh, sweet and crispy.

La Porc Fermier - Braised Pork belly with confit sweet onion.  Very sweet melt in your mouth pork belly. The mashed potato was really tasty.  I can taste a heart attack waiting to happen.

Les Fromages - Blue cheese, Creamy sheep cheese and Camembert.  Although, the cheeses were awesome quality, I thought that this was a filler, so I don't leave starving.  I would have rather eaten something else. 

I wanted to try the traditional tarts, but they were sold out. So sad!  So, being difficult, I petitioned to substitute the assorted sorbet for the La Framboise - fresh raspberry inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream. It was a little too tart for me, but the sweetness of the white chocolate combined with fresh berries and the distance flavors of yuzu ice cream created a very distinctive unique flavor.

I loved my meal and my experience.  It was a beautiful window into Mr. Robuchon's world and # 100 worthy and cost about that much too.",yR7wToOwcrNVYUbqFjhCww,5,5,5,BNg98ZgiXiGNt6izpVAFhg

The food runners knew every dish, described them beautifully to refresh our memory and were just really nice.  We loved the layout of the restaurant so you get the Michelin rated food with a friendlier atmosphere and the most attentive service.

We did the $155 tasting menu and it was amazing.  Foie gras parfait was unique.  I have a new appreciation for heirloom tomatoes and the salad was a work of art.  The king crab was beautiful.  Langostine was perfectly cooked and left me wanting more.  The onion tart was outrageously good.  The salmon was my least favorite as it was a bit salty.  The quail stuffed with foie gras was beyond amazing and the cap steak was excellent.  Having two desserts seem quite decadent but we are on vacation and they were both perfection.  The  generous wine pairings were a perfect accompaniment to the tasting.

I highly recommend L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!",zaNGIH6nhgcMkkZO17PLFQ,0,0,5,jW2x1drtLet7Pk7Bu-6pBg
4017572,2012-01-23,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I may be walking around with a bit more of a spring in my step now that I have dined on the cuisine of the chef of the century.

The are a few tasting menus to choose from.  We didn't partake.  Approximately 3/4 of the menu is small plates ranging in price from $25 - $35.  1/4 of the menu is entrees ranging in price from $40 - $90.  

The small plates mean small.  Each plate is 3 - 4 bites.  Our server recommended 4 per person.  

Pardon my French - (I don't know any) -  we had the seared foie gras with quince, sardines and eggplant, onion tart, kobe and foie gras sliders, foie gras stuffed quail, oysters, poached egg with truffle.  Everything was delicious.  The plates were exquisite - almost too pretty to eat.     

For entrees, we had the pepper crusted filet, hanger steak, and sea bass.  They use the term entree loosely  as it is still a very small portion.  For example, my bass was a 4 oz. sliver with 6 artichoke hearts and 1/2 whipped potatoes.  Aside from size, it was flavorful and lovely.  The whipped potatoes both look and taste like pure whipped butter.  They are unbelievably decadent.  I'm not sure there is even any potato in there!  The filet was the standout.  The meat was absolutely sublime.  Nothing less than expected from the $72 price tag.  

The one  major disappointment was the bread.  I expected excellence and got dry overbaked, mediocrity served with cold unspreadable butter.  Tisk tisk.

The service was flawless but paced.  The long lapses are to be expected in this sort of dining.  

I have yet to determine if the meal was worth the $580 price tag, but it was delicious and lovely.  A nice experience.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,4,0,4,u8fc-3OSJTgqymvGDjs5NA
4026450,2015-09-29,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"When in Vegas last year for my buddy's birthday, I had to look up some options on where to eat, and conveniently L'Atelier was in the MGM where we were staying. While it may not have officially had a Michelin star anymore due to those pretentious Europeans pulling out of Vegas entirely, I still consider it my first Michelin-starred eating experience.

The restaurant itself was a lot smaller than I expected, with just a handful of tables and then a bar wrapping around the wide open kitchen. This made it a combination of a meal and performance art, watching meals be constructed at such a high level. I'm no slouch, but most meals I eat don't involve tweezers in the preparation.

I splurged on the tasting menu for myself, with each course dutifully presented and described by the waiter as they came.

Scallop carpaccio - the thinly sliced scallops were ultra smooth, with added richness from the olive oil and just a little bit of bite from the chives.

Stuffed pepper - bigger flavour here from the pepper, while the eggplant filling had a soft texture and light flavour. The slice of tuna belly was rich and not too fishy, while the crispy wafer bits added a crunchy contrast to the rest of the dish.

Langoustine - this mini-lobster came with green curry and oil smears. Perfectly cooked, although not as rich in flavour as the Nova Scotia lobster that I have at home, but it was a great dish nonetheless and the best so the first few courses.

Foie gras tortellini soup - the broth was very mild, with most of the flavour coming from the cilantro, green onions and chili flakes (?) in the soup. The foie gras tortellini was smooth and delicious, although the foie was subdued by the bigger herby flavours of the dish.

Seared turbot - very mild fish, but perfectly cooked and flaked easily with a fork. A bit of acidity from the pickled veggies added a bit of bite.

Foie gras-stuffed quail and mashed potatoes - the quail leg was fantastic - moist and flavourful, with added depth from the sauce. The tiny stuffed breast was a little bit on the dry side, but the fattiness of the foie helped in that regard. The mashed potatoes were as fluffy and rich as you could possibly make a potato.

Dessert #1 was comprised of a strawberry and cherry tomato sorbet and lime ganache. The flavours were spot on and a stark contrast to mass produced desserts or ice creams that I'm not a huge fan of. A light, refreshing and not-too-sweet dessert.

Dessert #2 was a great mix of textures - smooth caramel and chocolate sauces, crispy wafers, a few kernels of popcorn. Again, not heavy on the sugar but a nice way to finish the meal.

Things wrapped up with a great espresso to power me through the night to come.

It certainly wasn't easy on the wallet, but it was an awesome meal and experience. The elevated level of expectations here made me be more nit-picky but Michelin star or not, it is definitely worth a visit.",zyaQNsI73cLOKttvGnj4bw,0,1,4,enBJsdw8WHbi_r8YmEUkmw

Unlike the Joel Robuchon Restaurant next door, L'Atelier has many different prix-fixe menus to choose from, ranging from $52-$159 per person.  Every plate has been beautiful and delicious.

1 star off: Service can be hit-or-miss. Some servers explain the dish well, and some do not. We had one server who handed us our desserts and just said, ""Here's your coffee dessert."" Because the dish had so many elements to it, it would be helpful to get even a little more information -- like what is this gold-colored, squiggly thingy on the...ice cream?

4041020,2016-02-18,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon provides great food - may I say nearly on par with Robuchon next door - in a much more relaxed but exciting environment.  The open kitchen was great - we were able to watch our dishes being prepared from start to finish.  The coordination within a kitchen like this is just amazing to watch.  Luckily we were sat near the end of the bar right in front of the window - up close and personal.  (I have heard of some complaints at being sat at the counter/bar but I think those are the best seats in the house!)

Watching the Chef (Steve Benjamin I presumed) bark out french-accented orders was actually fun - he had his moments - sternly (an understatement) talking to a young prep cook about his lack of skill preparing the Robuchon potatoes.  Then, when the young man (who looked like he lost a few pints of blood from his face) stood silently beside him watching the chef correct his mistake, the chef turns around and yells, ""are you just going to stand there!!!?  Go do something""  again in a heavy french accent.  I had to concentrate not to laugh out loud - having worked in a professional kitchen both on the giving and receiving end of those 'conversations' brought back fond memories.  Side note: Chef seemed to have an affinity for truffle.  He seemed to be the only one 'allowed' to slice them on the traditional truffle slicer and we must have caught him sneaking at least a dozen slices of truffle to 'taste'.  yummm  the perks of being boss.

The meal in itself was great without exception - I don't need to go into much detail of each course of the degustation menu, but the standouts were the Seared Foie Gras and the amazing steamed Scallops in a clear broth.  I would have liked to have enjoyed a larger bread selection akin to Robuchon next door, but then again it was probably better not to as I recall stuffing myself with too much bread from that amazing bread cart and almost missing out on ""Le Boeuf""...

4044808,2010-11-01,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Loved it!

Atmosphere: excellent. You sit at the bar and get to watch all the chefs at work in the open kitchen which is really cool. Plus it means basically everyone is there in couples or groups of 3, so it's quieter and really cozy. There are like 3 tables in the place where a large group could sit, but that's it, so the restaurant overall is quite small. 

Service: excellent. Our main waiter was totally on the ball on everything we asked and all the servers/bussers were very efficient and friendly clearing our old plates, bringing out the new ones, and explaining all the dishes.

Food: excellent. We did the $155 tasting menu and loved every dish. Favorites were the foie-gras parfait amuse bouche and the king crab on radish discs. The bread selection was really good, but I had to stop myself so I wouldn't fill up. My least favorite would have to be the dessert. I wish we could have had the cheese selection instead.

Value: very good. $155 tasting menu times two, plus a bottle of very good wine and tip and our bill was about $430, which is a lot less than we would have spent at the Mansion. If you're trying to do Robuchon on a tighter budget, I think you should get the $95 tasting menu, skip drinks, and hit Fat Tuesday's on your way out of the casino (see my review http://www.yelp.com/biz/fat-tuesday-las-vegas-2#hrid:yJ-HCXBNO5QYM7dZgkBscQ). If you want to go on a tighter budget than that, you should probably skip Robuchon all together!

From start to finish, the service and all our dishes were absolutely amazing.  We started our meal with the baby kushi oysters poached in french butter and the lobster gelee in a cream leak soup, which both were amazing.  order the big eye tuna in tomato infused olive oil.  it is a really wonderful dish.  then we had the roasted rack of lamb which was so tender and juicy and we also ordered the gnocchi which were so tender and well prepared.  also the braised pork belly-- wow.  that has to be one of the best dishes I have ever tasted in my entire life.  order it and you will not be sorry.  the sweetbreads, which i stayed away from because i just cant do it...  but my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed them and he said the dish was amazing.  please do yourself a favor and order the green chartreuse souffle with pistachio ice cream for dessert.  It is to die for.  I think if a restaurant can pull of a great souffle... they know what they're doing.  and no doubt, the chefs on the line here at L'Atelier, know exactly what they're doing.  Also as a treat, they surpised the birthday boy with a tray of 6 different tarts that were all absolutely delicious.  At L'Atelier, you will have a great experience and you will be thinking about the dishes you had here for weeks even months to come.

I knew I wanted to try a concept by Chef Joel Robuchon while in Vegas and was intrigued by the concept at L'Atelier located in the MGM Grand. The concept was ideal for my wife and I as the counterside ""watch the chef"" experience was great before we went out to Hakkasan. 

We arrived slightly early but were seated in the ""waiting room"" which was a nice, quaint setting to relax and get situated before being taken to our seating. Upon being ushered by the nice hostess, we were seated right before the corner deep in the restaurant. Note that there are also tables for larger parties. 

While we ended up with mocktails, rosé was the standard ""whet your appetite"" beverage for most diners I assume. Given our appetites, we desired an a la carte experience and ended up ordering the 12 oz. L'entrecote or Wagyu Beef (sliced for sharing) and the Le Saumon Fume (Smoked Salmon). Before our entrees were served, the Chef sent over a nice warm palette cleanser which was a smoked cheese small dish in addition to a filo dough crusted prawn with a really neat side sauce. 

For dessert, we wrapped up with La Framboise which is a white chocolate sphere that is drizzled over with a raspberry sauce and unlocks a delicious berry dish inside, with a side of ice cream. The presentation is art in itself and tends to garner a stare from diners due to the unique delivery. 

I would certainly recommend L'Atelier to anyone looking to experience Chef Robuchon without necessarily delving into his well-orchestrated 18 course journey. My next trip will include a visit to the adjacent namesake restaurant itself!",NtKMJdSUQf8yYy6SgC4EdA,0,3,5,VXO-U4xTycDEBBhbXWUMuw

This experience is like going to the theatre where the kitchen is the symphony, the meal and wine the story and the service staff the performers. 

We opted for the tasting menu and wine pairings. It was a splurge, but well, well worth it. I said to my husband when we decided to opt for the tasting menu, that we had to get the pairings, as it would have near impossible to choose a bottle or two that would have done the menu justice. What an amazing choice that turned out to be. 

The menu itself is a story of culinary finery, but when paired with the wines, the symphony begins. The pairings were where the magic really happened. There was one wine for every two courses. I had to wonder how they would pull that off, but I needn't have worried. The story of the meal just flows together like chapters in a book.  Its just so unusual to have a meal so perfectly orchestrated. 

I wasn't as much a fan of the seating as some, but throughout the course of the meal, it grew on me. I love watching the kitchen work, almost without conversation.

It really was like watching a ballet. 

The service was elegant, but never stuffy we never wanted for a single thing. Kawika was our primary server and we adored and his fantastic service.

I've gone to excellent restaurants all over the United States and this one stands out. A few reasons for it. The atmosphere, the prices and the serving sizes. 

I came here, knowing full well that it would be expensive. I came in dressed casual and ate at the bar. The drinks were expensive but strong. Very rarely have I had a strong drink while at MGM Grand. 

I was open minded enough to try what was recommended. I was given the Duck Liver Parfait and was surprised how good it was. My other surprises were the smoked salmon main entree and the crab cake appetizer. 

The only issue with this place to me is the serving sizes. From going to the typical Steakhouses that serve large portions and other restaurants with similar sizes, I felt like I didn't get much value for my money.

I spent around $80 for myself and I still had room for more.  The serving sizes would be perfect for a 90lb woman, but not for a tall/big American male.

I recommend this place though for atmosphere.  This is a perfect place for couples who want a romantic dinner.  Compared to the other Joel Robuchon places, this place is the least expensive.",NSS0m8Qz6-XCTK8RCI6RKA,0,0,4,MX0k9wqx11zqlCrpFUhC0A

Food: 3 Stars

I've been sitting on this review for awhile now....since my birthday back in April. We had decided to try the Seasonal Discovery Menu for $155 a person since that was what was recommended and we had time to enjoy the meal.

1. L'Amuse-Bouche (Veggie fondant topped with a delicate avocado cream)- This was a good starter choice....I am a big fan of avocados so I was excited for more.

2. Le Celeri (Celery Mousse with wasabi, beef stew gelee and shaved foie gras)- My first time ever having foie gras! BUT I was not that interested in it....I guess just not my cup of tea which is fine by me since I probably can't eat it all the time anyways since its expensive. The beef stew gelee was a bit different in texture which took some time to get used to. Not a big fan of wasabi surprisingly since I love sushi...so this was not my favorite. 

3. La Saint-Jacques (Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil): LOVE LOVE scallops and this scallop was a cooked perfectly with Asian influences.

4. Le Crabe Royal( King Crab a la plancha, vegetable with lemongrass oil): Large piece of crab with Asian influences again, this was served cold and was good.

5. L'asperge (Green asparagus and macaroni in a Comte gratun, smoked veal bacon): Asparagus wrapped in a big macaroni. Unfortunately I don't recall seeing any bacon and looking back at the photos I don't see any either. It was good, but nothing out of this world.

6. La Sole (Sole filet, baby leeks, crispy onion rings and ginger): Onion rings were awesome! Filet was cooked to perfection of course and yet another Asian influenced theme. I thought that it was supposed to be French?

7. La Caille (Foie Gras stuffed free range quail with truffle mashed potatoes): This was my main dish and I've never had quail before. I didn't like the foie gras, but I did like it more in this dish then the beef gelee. I've never had quail before, but it was easy to eat, a lil gamey in flavor, but overall good. The truffle mashed potatoes was what I was looking forward to all night! I love potatoes, but these potatoes just didn't do it for me. It was a bit watery and didn't have a good texture.

7. La Caille (French-style hanger steak with fried shallots): My fiance ordered this for his main dish the the beef was delicious. I should have gotten that!

8. L'annas (Light Pineapple cream, vanilla wager, lime and lemongrass sorbet): Definitely had acid in this dessert, but it worked well with everything else that we had just eaten. 

9. La Noisette (Hazelnut parfait, fresh grapefruit, praline crunch): This was probably my favorite out of the two desserts.

Since it was my birthday dinner they had brought out a special dessert plate with Happy Birthday written on it. This definitely was my favorite and it ended the night well. Service was very attentive and they even let me take a copy of the menu home, hence the reason why I could spell everything. Maybe fine dining is not for us as we left not completely full, but it was a good experience to have. Michelle W. did recommend not doing the tasting menu and if I ever did go back I might just do what she said. I think for the price I paid and what I ate, I wasn't too impressed.

4253074,2011-05-06,30,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Fine Dining while watching the open kitchen here was one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. We had made reservations for the L'Unique menu which was designed for people who wanted a complete meal but had limited dining time (such as before a show). For $59.00, we got to enjoy a fantastic meal of an app, entree and dessert- all served within about 15 minutes. 
Started with a bread basket that i'm sure would make Anthony N's bread basket notes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=wcB4tCCHDP-MVZgumBWRIw It was served with 3 kinds: baguettes, country rolls and croissant rolls. The croissant was my favorite. They give u generous pads of butter and will give u extra bread- so eat up! You will be hard pressed to find better bread baskets. 
For the L'unique menu, we got to choose from two different items for each part of the meal. Between the bf and i, we got to try all of them.

The best part of this experience is watching the chefs making these beautiful dishes. Every chef had their special tasks in making each dish complete to perfection. We even saw a chef using tweezers to carefully place pieces together of a salad. Although the chefs and servers move swiftly to try to complete your meal in the promised 15 minutes, you never feel rushed or see anything done hastily. Our waiter checked on us just enough times to make sure everything was great and took the time to make conversation as well and answer any questions we had. 

Dude is a notoriously slow eater, and i had surprise tickets for him to see the Jabbawockeez after dinner. While he was busy taking photos of the decor and watching the chefs- i was afraid we were never gonna get to the show in time at the rate he was going, not even having touched his bread yet. But as dinner was served- to see his reaction to finally finding a vegas hotel restaurant that he truly enjoyed (he always complains they r never great)- from him watching the chefs, to enjoying every morsel on his plate, was well worth the price and nervousness!!!

The menu was $109.00 with some supplemental charges for the dishes we selected, and we had a party of 5 and I was introducing this restaurant to new people.  Some of the dishes were very salty, and some items were incorrectly sent out, which we did not order, but we made the best of it.  Overall, there was a sense of lack of care or effort.  The main issue that we had with the restaurant were:

1)  Service was definitely lacking, we had to ask for many things, and after the courses were dropped off, we received no real attention.  It seemed that everyone was hiding in the rear of the restaurant.  We have had good service the times before, but everything was lacking this time.  Just seemed very takeoutyy.

2)  None of the courses we had were outstanding, they all seemed mundane, and almost cliché.  The last course, which  was the suckling pig, were random cubes, not necessarily artfully cut up or anything, just thrown on some napa cabbage.  It was dry and not very good.  Actually, I had better Chinese suckling pig at a Chinese bbq restaurant.  The entire menu is not very special, seems cheapened and without any heart or effort.  The restaurant seemed as if it was on autopilot and just throwing it out there and could care less what the patrons thought.

This was my first time dining at a Joel Robuchon restaurant and I was not disappointed. Service was impeccable and the food was SO GOOD.  I was extremely excited to order Foie Gras because back home in California Foie Gras is illegal.

My friend and I opted for the A La Carte menu instead of doing their Prie Fix menu because we wanted bigger portions of their signature dishes.

Our meal started with amuse bouche - a delicious creamy cup of Foie Gras topped with a parmesan foam. Great starter. Full of texture and flavor. 

For our menu items, we ordered the Jambon Iberico, the Lobster Salad, the Seared Duck Foie Gras, Wagyu beef ribeye, and the Roasted Sea bass. Every single dish was perfect! I would have a hard time choosing other items from the menu if / when I return to L'Atelier because everything we ordered was outstanding. With that said, my favorite dish, BY FAR, was the Foie Gras.  OH MY GOD.  Perhaps the best foie gras dish I ever tried in my life. I ate it so slowly because I never wanted it to end. Haha 

We finished our meal with a dessert called Le Chocolate - a true chocolate sensation! Everything about this dessert worked for me; Chocolate overload. I think there may have even been Oreo cookie crumbles in it! Haha

A La Carte for two totaled to just over $450.

No really, it's b/c if you start from the top, then you don't appreciate anything else and this place seemed more casual and comfortable.  I liked the bar seating and the trendy decor as well.

L'Atelier did not disappoint!  The service was outstanding.  Probably the best service I've received at a Michelin Star restaurant.   Everyone is focused and quiet in the open kitchen.  They are professional and will get to your every need.  The manager even got us a plate of tarts (the dessert we didn't order on the menu, so basically we got all of the desserts) for BF's bday.

I was able to get the four-course club menu while BF got the 10 course discovery menu.  I highly recommend this if you are a couple because then you basically eat everything on the menu.

Probably five stars for the majority of patrons. There is no doubt they earn their stellar reviews here, this is about perfect for anyone looking for traditional haute cuisine French.  Please keep that in mind as you read this. On a purely technical level, taking out cost and innovation, this is fabulous. If you're looking for that, you can't go wrong here.

Finding ourselves in Vegas for a distant relatives wedding over our anniversary weekend this past May, I decided to go all in for the highest rated restaurant I could find in the city, that wouldn't completely bankrupt me. Joel Robuchon, the French chef of zee century, has two world class options on the strip, including his namesake immediately next door, that is so extravagant that a meal costs north of what I take home in a month. It's black sheep sibling L'atelier is more moderate, if you can call a $500+ meal moderate. (if you can, I need a benefactor post haste.)

L'atelier is casual. I must admit I'm more enamored of the decor than the actual food. Gleaming and modern, stunning Chinese reds, deep blacks and shining chrome everywhere sounds over the top but it's oh so very cool. Service is exceptional and understated as should be expected. Sitting at the counter we got to watch the choreography of the kitchen, though the staff is so precise and quick there really wasn't much to watch. Hell's Kitchen this isn't. 

One of the parameters I rate restaurants by is cost to quality ratio. While well heeled diners might not blink at this type of bill, it's a reach for us, a splurge and I need it to make unforgettable memories to be worth the outlay. We eat out so much that perfectly prepared dishes just aren't enough to mesmerize me. I want something I haven't experienced previously.

We ordered the Seasonal Discovery menu at $159. It's a substantial meal, consisting of six savory dishes after the initial foie gras parfait and ending with two dessert plates. Not to be forgotten, some of the best bread you'll find anywhere. Every course served my wife and I looked at each other and agreed it was delicious. Yet somehow by the end

The confit of Mediterranean vegetables was light and delightful but nothing remarkable for a carnivore.

Poached baby Kusshi oysters were fabulous, delectable bites. Wish there were a few more of them, but the tiny duo were a highlight.

So were the langoustines in green curry and coconut milk that followed. If not uniquely prepared, they were the pinnacle of the menu. Among the best I've experienced.

The white onion tart with bacon and a quail egg mirror was nice if I remember correctly, but it didn't make a lasting impression. Neither did the John Dory with baby leeks in a buttery shellfish sauce. Perfectly prepared but again lost in memory by time and more interesting plates since then. 

A foie gras stuffed quail with mashed potatoes was also technically brilliant but nothing markedly different from many quail dishes over the years save the obvious technical brilliance the kitchen has. 

French style hanger steak was fantabulous. Though it was just a simple dish, the meat quality was amazing. For sure the best quality hanger steak I've had. 

Caramel panna cotta was nice but rather mundane for this level dining. I was expecting crazy good desserts but these were oddly pedestrian even as they were tasty, though the finale of fresh black berries with chocolate cake was very good. 

By the end it all added up to an expensive experience of excellence, but (and there is a but), looking back on the way out there was a sense of disappointment. Maybe we were expecting a transcendent meal, considering the stature of Robuchon, instead of just technical prowess. I've had better meals before, and many since then. When all is said and done the evening doesn't make my top ten all time dinners, maybe not even my top twenty which is odd, considering everything was flawless.

Walked in wearing flip-flops and ate at the bar at 7:00pm on a Wednesday night. With two glasses of wine, four courses, tax and tip it was almost $200 - Not worth it. Note, I'm vegetarian. 

The amuse and first course almost tasted identical, Le Potiron : butternut squash puree with chestnut and chanterelle. The chestnut was an excellent addition. The next two courses were absolutely divine: Lentil soup with a thin cracker that popped like a rice crispy followed by Le Celeri - a fantastic celery root salad and heart warming mashed potato. Finished with a cheese plate (didn't want sweets), it was basic and dull.

I have no problem dropping that much for a special meal, but I expect it to be of higher quality than at least a TGI Friday's or Chili's (which are of course much simpler and have lower cost ingredients, but on net and in all seriousness I sadly would have enjoyed more).

The fish for both of us was so overcooked (_well_ beyond well done) I was shocked. We showed ours to the waiter and he was embarrassed/agreed and offered to have the chef try again -- though we had to go to a show after so couldn't wait for them to redo them. Most of the other ~7 or so dishes on the tasting menu were either extremely bland or had mismatching ingredients that clashed instead of complemented each other--the kind of rookie chef mistakes you expect from a $20-30 entree place.  My wife and I both didn't even finish dessert, and I for one am typically a huge dessert fan. This was literally the worst value for the money (and one of my bottom 10 regardless of price) restaurant meals of all time. Joel Robuchon should be ashamed.

I am in Vegas at least twice a year for work and do lots of research to decide which restaurants to discover and enjoy on my visits :) 

Ambience: LOVE the decor in the restaurant, it is Vegas, but I have been to the location in Hong Kong as well, and this is the same design as the other location. Beautiful open kitchen, LOVE LOVE LOVE, very chic, sexy, and modern all at the same time, I don't even like the color red, but do like it in this restaurant.

Food:

There were a couple courses that I can't remember at this moment, probably because they weren't memorable, and I am writing this past due review a yr or so late

Amuse Bouche: port wine foie gras mousse business, holy hell, can i have a bowl instead of a shot glass worth??? YUM This is the yummiest amuse bouche any restaurant has ever given me!!!!!

White Onion Tart w/ bacon and asparagus: flaky, delicate, rich, the french know how to make a freakin tart! YUM

Crispy langoustine w/ pesto: again, crispy, delecate, juicy and tender langoustine inside, my first taste of this sea creature, very yummy

Foie gras burger: Rich and tasty, four people shared one, a little goes a long way, nice idea to pair foie with a burger

Overall, I would go back and be selective on my choices, there were a couple disappointments, but also a few amazing dishes....",b0LFlVbXjWmY80NyiigplA,0,0,4,6p4s-fspSuIpZI0eUTNPhQ
4417264,2007-11-21,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Damn you Yelp for not allowing half-star ratings!  L'Atelier is a 4.5 in my book - great, but just not inventive and consistent enough to nudge itself into the topmost tier of fine dining.  Allow me to set the mood - this was the centerpiece dinner for my good friend and myself amidst a typically hedonistic Vegas weekend and we were definitely not disappointed.  We both ordered the tasting menu:

The Good:
Cucumber gelee - very interesting execution and flavor combo but more shock value than substance
Foie gras - yes, unfortunately, it was not outstanding, just good
Veal - a touch too much salt but cooked well and the accompaniments were perfect in enhancing the flavor of an inherently bland cut.
Quail - very solid but again, just not that memorable
Crab and avocado salad -  a bit bland and under-dressed but otherwise quite palatable.
Strawberry milkshake - incredibly tasty, teetering on the line between good and great.

The Bad:
Halibut - steamed with butter and seasonal vegetables on top.  Precariously underseasoned and a bit overcooked.  Not really bad, just way below the quality of all other dishes.

The mind-altering
Gazpacho - an amazingly bright and concentrated distillation of tomato with just the right amount of acid, fat, and texture in the background.  Great.
Sweetbreads - perfectly prepped and sourced, and just amazingly executed throughout.
Mashed potato - Robuchon's signature dish.  More cream and butter than potato.  Enough said.
Oysters - poached (dipped for a split second is more accurate) in butter and served with sea salt and lemon.  Pristine in every sense and easily the best dish of the night.  Hell, one of the best dishes I've ever had.  Sublime.

I know a lot of people rag on the bar-style dining experience but we both enjoyed talking to the knowledgeable and friendly wait staff and seeing food get made right in front of our eyes.  The whole place was stylishly executed but low-key enough to not appear garish like many other Vegas establishments.  Unfortunately, the wine list was steeply marked up and overly Francocentric but there were myriad great choices.  Was it worth the money?  Absolutely.  Would I go back?  Yes, but probably not for the tasting menu.",94Zh-cp7bXiZgnQ27BW5LQ,4,0,5,XWLSdEzSTfIqJUUXnRE8yA

That was not the case here, I find their customer service skills to be very poor. The waiters were very UN-attentive.

But I don't want to be on a total playa' hatin' review of the MGM - L'Atelier is like the proverbial oasis in the desert of MGM's glamcrapatism. Red and black interior, soothing quietness, chefs hard at work behind the sushi-style counter that envelopes the kitchen.

This place is worth a visit - but I can't say it is in the top 20 of the 'best meals of my life.' I was able to wangle a prix fixe dinner at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon along with a show (Crazy Horse - Parisian strip tease!!) for $98 through the MGM's website. I added on some dishes not on the prix fixe menu. Along with drinks, my meal was a bit over $300 (one person). 

I started off with a superb Bellini (a bit of a shock at $29). My meal included a starter of a composed 'tower' of Meditteranean vegetables (good), followed by a 'toast' of minced tomatoes and tuna (very good) and a tiny tempura of langoustine (2 bites but good). My entree was the onglet steak with leeks - very tasty in a reduction of port, I believe. The onglet was very tender. A cheese plate followed (delicious). I had a sorbet (cannot remember the flavor) as a final dish. Service was very, very good at the counter. My waiter refilled my water glass promptly and suggested a variety of wines by the glass to complement my meal.

I was seated at the bar, and we had more than one server assisting us. It was a bit confusing because the server we spoke to first understood that I was the only vegetarian in my party. I did not want to do the vegetarian tasting menu because that meant the rest of my friends had to as well. The server said he would ask the chef if I could possibly order something from the tasting menu that was not on the regular menu, so that I can at least get a variety of dishes that were vegetarian (instead of only salads/purees). 
However, when we tried to order, we ordered with a different server and he did not let me order a dish off the tasting menu. He brought out the foie gras parfait for everyone at the table including me and disregarded that I was vegetarian. The first server noticed the mistake and then had to fix it. The first server was very sincere and excellent, while the other one was more aloof and wanted to get things done quickly.

So we walked in to my favorite color RED. The place was definitely not big at all, with some tables but mainly the huge bar/kitchen on the right side of the entrance.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon's restaurant is very sleek and modern.   The kitchen is open so you can see what they are preparing.

It was hard to make the reservations online, probably because it was on a busy weekend. But if you call the front desk at the MGM, they will probably find you a better time slot. When I showed up, only 2/3 of the space was occupied. Our waiter sat us at the counter, where you can see the entire kitchen staff working on the food. All the food decorations are fake besides the tomatoes!

Below is a list of items we ordered:

Appetizers:
LE FOIE GRAS - Traditionally Poached Chilled Duck Foie Gras
LE VITELLO - Thin Chilled Slices Of Veal Topped With Tuna Sauce & Sweet Gem Lettuce
LA DAURADE - Snapper Marinated With Lime, Tomato & Virgin Olive Oil

Main Course:
LE BUF - Wagyu Beef Rib Eye
L'ONGLET - Steak Tartar With Old-Fashioned French Fries
Pommes Purée - Mashed Potatoes

Foie gras was a bit oily for my taste, but I guess I have to get use to it. I did not enjoy the veal one bit. What I did take pleasure in was the snapper. It was very colorful and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. The rib eye was ok; it was not as tender as I would prefer. Plus I find it a bit pricey ($99) finding out the meat was domestic. The tartar had too taste of onions. My wife really loves their French fries and bread. Their famous mashed potatoes did not disappoint, very buttery, but only in small portions.

Overall the food did not wow me. Maybe next time I will try their Prix Fixe menu. During the meal my waiter seemed way too busy. Don't get me wrong, he was not rude or anything. But later the waiter found out my wife did not like the steak tartar, so he took it off of the bill (very nice of him). Bill came out a little over $300 (still tipped over 20%).

It is a lot smaller then I expected.  Overall, we had a good experience dining here. Will be returning to try their other creations in the future. 

In order to try more dishes without doing the 10 course seasonal menu at $155pp, my hubby did the 5- course Menu Club selection for $95pp and I did 2 small portion dishes with one regular entree for $104. It worked out perfectly since it allowed us to try all the dishes we wanted to try. I got the Kusshi oysters, foie gras stuffed quail, and the Maine lobster salad. Overall, the stand out dishes for me were the lobster salad & vegetable fondant with avocado cream amuse bouche, absolutely delightful- light, refreshing, and balanced flavors. My hubby enjoyed la langoustine, bread, and tarts desserts. Yes, bread. He is a fan of baguettes and they have light, crisp but slightly chewy baguettes plus mini croissants, and dinner rolls that are served at the beginning and constantly refilled.

The only thing with sitting at the bar is they don't keep your water filled as consistently. That's one of my pet peeves at restaurants. I'm happy if my water is always kept full. Unfortunately, that didn't happen here. I would expect more from a one Michelin rated restaurant.

 At this point, I'd already spent over $300 on food over the course of one day. Although it was a good experience overall, I probably wouldn't return for a while.

Server was awesome. 

Sommelier made the experience very unpleasant. Treated people differently depending on what they ordered. Hovered over us and made us uncomfortable.  Didn't give us our wine until we had completed our amuse bouche and our first course had come out. Poured a substantial test of our wine and discarded it. Came by to fill our glasses once and made us feel like second class citizens because we didn't order a $300+ bottle of wine he suggested. 

Check out some of the other comments people have left for the sommelier. I rarely leave reviews and when I do they are positive. This is the exception because one shouldn't have to deal with ridiculous pretension when coming to eat a special meal. Regardless of how much a person makes or appears to make you should treat everyone equally and politely. Check out my other check-ins and see the restaurants I frequent. Exceptionally bad taste in the mouth left by the pretentious sommelier.

Amuse Bouche of  Foie Gras with a foam in a shot glass.  Definitely a different way to eat foie but really tasty.

King Crab with cauliflower & avacado puree.  Can't go wrong with King Crab but the 2 purees really didn't add anything to the dish.  I thought this dish was average.

Sea Scallops with chives.  Sooooo gooood.  Great combo.

Onion Tart.  An excellent dish but I kind wish this course was something else.  I guess its cause I 'm such a carnivore.

Parsley Puree & wild mushrooms.  While I enjoyed the dish, I really didn't get any parsley flavor.

Dover Sole.  A disappointment.  For that amount of money you would think I would get a different fish than dover sole.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

Quail stuffed with foie gras.  Awesome!  So tender and rich.  Only complaint is that I only got 2 small pieces.

Don't remember exactly what we had for dessert but I remember that it was very good.

This restaurant is one of the best I'ver eaten at.  Its just that for $155 I want to be wowed and I think this particular menu did not live up to that.",MJ0Wphhko2-LbJ0uZ5XyQA,0,0,4,9_2VAP20QWzHj60XotPmGw

It was a great relief from Yellowtail in Bellagio (you can read my review on that terrible experience).  But  regardless, L'Atleier is a MUST TRY in Vegas. It's located in the MGM grand and is probably one of the best dining experiences I've had.  My wife LOVED it so that was a great bonus on my part ;-)

The menu includes a 16 course tasting menu, a five course menu or a three course menu. Also on the menu are single entree's if that is more to your liking.  We had the three course menu and that was plenty enough food for us.  If we had bigger appetites and a bigger wallet the 16 course menu would be amazing...if I recall it was $159 per person.

Aside from the ill experienced, young, rude hostess ,the overall experience was amazing. She didn't seem to fit at at that restaurant because everyone else was so professional and she had no clue how to provide good service.  She made us wait til exactly 9:00 PM until we could be seated, how weird is that? 

All parties of two are seated at the bar in which you face an immaculate kitchen with the hustle and bustle of the chefs.  Service was great and every employee knew everything about the food.  A bottle of wine was on the pricey side ranging from $60-infinity but well worth it for the amazing food.

So I have been to L'Atelier twice now and both times the experience was amazing!!!

There isn't a lot to say when something is already made to perfection...
If you have not been to L'Atelier it is ABSOLUTELY mandatory that you experience this restuarant at some point in your life.

The menu changes pretty often but no matter what I have ever eaten here, the food is the best that I have ever had.

The service is superb and very informative when helping you with the menu and food choices they offer. Service is definitely second to none. 

The price is somewhat pricy. Both times I have been I've spent about $80-$90 per person for a four course meal. 

Again, I repeat, if you have never been or if you are looking for a great place to eat in Vegas L'Atelier is a can't miss spot.  You will not regret it if you dine here. 

By far one of the best if not the best restuarants that I have ever visited.

It's kind of rare to go to a supposedly elite Las Vegas eatery and leave dissatisfied as long as you did your homework.  I guess maybe Halloween threw them off!  L'Atelier was supposed to be one of the flagship Joel Robuchon offerings.  We were looking forward to really exploring some innovative French cuisine.  While, it certainly was innovative, the finished products left something to be desired.  The service was good.  Friendly and attentive. The ambiance was warm and trendy.  Service and environment were not the problem.  The food was. 

We opted for the Menu B, a more extensive prix fixe offering with two appetizers and two entrees plus dessert.  My wife and I started with the poached egg over smoked salmon.  This was truly delicious and built up our hopes for the rest of the meal.  Next up, I had the escargot which had a nice taste (suspect it was Pernod) with a molten polenta cake.  It was quite good.  My wife had the veloute of spinach which was rather bland to my taste.  Next, we both got the roasted duck breast with figs.  The duck was cooked well but the flavors around it were muted and the duck itself did not carry the dish alone.  For our second entrees, my wife had the salmon which was hardly unique in preparation nor flavor.  I have the pork which was flavorful, over sauteed cabbage, but slightly over cooked.

For dessert, we both got the carrot cake which was beautifully presented, looking like a carrot stuck in the ground.  It was modest and gone before we knew it.

Overall, we were just underwhelmed.  We have had so much better when it comes to elite French dining experiences.  For sake of context, we loved Sage in Aria much better than this.",J7sOFHpKmQWlcsxf0dO2TQ,2,1,3,346I8c9ooLurcCzSj0rDJg

It is everything you expect of a Michellin star restaurant, I am sure the second star is coming soon.  We were pleasantly surprised that the sommelier was so helpful, since we first opted out on the wine pairing for the prefix menu and later had him come back and recomend a different wine for each dish. He recommended many excellent wines and even offered samples of several of them.  Unlike other high end restaurants where the staff can a little snobby, we felt very comfortable the entire meal.  As for the food, the moment I took the first bite I knew many had shed tears of joy in that restaurant before me.

This dinner was all about the little details, from freshly made bread and croissants, to fresh silverware and warm plates for each round, and the beautiful carbon steak knives. And did I mention the service was AMAZING! And our dessert was delectable, from the Chantilly cake to the most delectable blueberries we've EVER had, alongside the most delicious cherry sorbet (the sorbet of any flavor is NOT to be missed) and the chocolate temptation was just that, deliciously chocolatey and wonderful. Loved the gold touches on top. It was so much fun to be able to sit and watch the kitchen and the intricacy that each plate was created with.

The service was by far the best in any restaurant I have ever been to. The waiters were very professional and knowledgable. I was feeling a little sick that day and wanted a dish that was light. Our waiter recommended their crab salad which was perfect! I usually don't like crab because of the fishy taste but it was delicious.

The chefs and waiters worked very well together and were joking around, helping make a good atmosphere. 

The food was very good but I do wish the food was less salty. 

For dessert, I had the traditional tartes and it was delicious. It came with 6 different flavors and every single one of them was just decadent and amazing.

The rush, the excitement, the innocence of it all. It was invigorating. As we grow older, and learn more and experience more, there are less ""firsts"". Eventually, it seems, most of us become stuffy critics who seem to lose the ability to appreciate. 

 This was my first truly amazing fine dinning experience. I make no claim of even knowing what i am talking about, but, I can say that this was the best meal I have ever eaten. Surely, that may change, but I will never forget my first. 

I came with my beau. We both ordered the prie fix summer menu, with the wine pairing.  

The meal started with a poached quail egg a'mouse bouche. The creamy yolk mixed well with the other ingredients. I've had quail egg before, but this was the first time I was able to appreciate the rich flavor. 

Next,  les legumes, an assortment of Mediterranean vegetables, roasted, then cooled, piled between buffalo Mozzarella, and some sort of basil cream reduction something. It was delectable. 

The crispy wrapped langoustine, and a basil pesto was served next.  The langoustine was cooked to perfection. 

We found ourselves drunk on wine and giddy over the food, often giggling in disbelief at uniqueness of each dish. 

We ordered off of the small plates menu -  le cebette,  an onion pastry with bacon and asparagus - i believe my port had made it out by this time, as the entree was next. It paired well with the savory onion flavor.

For the main dish, I had the braised pork belly with confit sweet onion, and mashed potatoes. This was by far my favorite dish. I kept  re-creating the experience and flavor in my head on the ride back from Vegas. It was immaculate. The sweet onion complimented the park belly in the most exquisite way! 

These plates were small, ut by the time we finished our main course, we were almost full. we were served plates of imported cheese next, with three artisan breads. After that, the desert, an assortment of flavored ice cream and sorbet - the pistachio was my favorite.

First of all I have to say, we leaned that of you are a couple there both of you has to order the tasting menu. So my hubby wanted just the wagyu but had to get the tasting menu because that was what I wanted. 

We noticed the restaurant had about 15ppl when we arrived and it was around 10pm. There was 7 Waitstaff, 2hostress, and looks like one manager.

The menu was overall amazing like we expected. You can really see that the chefs there take their time in making it great. 

Here is where I was very disappointed. My Waitstaff just was not up to par. He was busy talking to everyone else rather than checking on us. It took an act of Congress to get water. There were two other couples there that ordered the tasting. Somehow all the food was done at the same time but out of 10 items we receive our food last for 9 out of 10.
Why is this important? The risotto dish was room temp. This was because he was talkative with others and finally another Waitstaff got it for us. 

As the night went on he disappeared and the other 2 Waitstaff took.him place. It was better since they would tell us about the dish and at least gave us water. We looked for the original waiter but he never came back so my hubby was unable to get any more scotch. By the time, they asked we were almost done.

Now most nice restaurant the manager checks on you to see how the service and food went. Guess what he never even stopped by or looked our way for us to even tell.him.how disappointed we were with this Valentine's day experience. 

My final check was $596 plus tip we spent $700 for the 2 of us to have such crappy service. We could have better service anywhere else for less.",5xc0njMysyhsiPwAWsduXw,4,2,2,ZewR5dAndz5jCPzm7IqfPQ
4593195,2015-11-09,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Paying a visit to Joël Robuchon's famous Atelier at the MGM Grand had been on my bucket list for...years.  Literally years.  The stars finally aligned on my recent trip to Vegas, and all of my expectations were met -- and exceeded, big-time.

I arrived in time for a 6pm reservation on a Saturday, and the place was buzzing but not crowded.  Most of the restaurant consists of a long, sleek counter facing a bright, open kitchen.  There are a few regular tables around the periphery, but those are no fun.  The real enjoyment of L'Ateler really comes from sitting at the counter, making small-talk with the ridiculously good-looking staff, and mingling with the other food-nerds who flock to the place from all over North America.

One of the nice parts of L'Atelier is that there are menus for all sizes of appetites and budgets.  If you're a baller, get the 20-course tasting (degustation) menu and call it a day.  For us mere mortals, there are smaller prix fixe menus of various sizes, as well as a la carte options.  My server pointed me toward the generically named ""Menu A"", which ended up being the perfect amount of food.  He also recommended me an awesome ""Kabinett"" Riesling, and brought out one of the most gorgeous breadbaskets I'd ever seen.  Even the butter (served on black slate with fresh sea salt on top, natch) was a stunner.

Here's the run-down of the dishes:

-- Amuse bouche:  foie gras parfait with parmesan foam.  Rich and decadent.  Loved the savory foie gras with the lightness of the foam.  Excellent starter.

-- La dorade: king snapper ceviche on cilantro avocado cream.  A very elevated ceviche.  It had all the essence of citrus but none of the acid.  The texture of the avocado cream was out of this world.

-- L'oeuf: fried egg, smoked salmon, winter salad, and crispy noodles.  The most unusual item of the night.  The egg and salmon were perfectly done, and the crispy noodles gave the dish some nice carb-y heft.  A twist on bagels and lox?

-- Le canard: roasted duck breast with poached figs.  Easily the best duck I've ever had.  It melted in your mouth like butter, as did the sweet (but not overly sweet) figs.  Like all entrees, it comes served with a ramekin of Chef Robuchon's famous mashed potatoes, which deserve all the acclaim they get.

-- Le cafe: coffee chantilly, chocolate sablé, and coffee ice cream.  An elegant, beautiful, and complex dessert.  The fun part was building the perfect bite with bits of all the components.

I left L'Atelier feeling full, and very very happy.  I'd come back in a heartbeat.  If you enjoy innovative fine dining and think dinner should be an event and not just another meal, then L'Atelier will be right up your alley... or, rather, your casino.",0C65lVj_ujVYDs7b2yYBAA,12,6,5,wuKz4m_RMygTWa90uiR_bg

We shared one of the tasting menus and they allowed us to pick a couple of other courses off the al carte menu, which was very cool of them. But, because of the seating you almost don't get that attention you normally get from a fine dining experience. I guess I want to be pamped and fussed over and here you don't get that feeling. 

My highlights: A-m-a-z-i-n-g BREAD! I love french bread, crewy and crispy with the salty butter. MMMMMMM! 

LES LANGOUSTINES- langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut milk -- sweet and lush, I only wish langoustines were bigger! LOL!

LA CEBETTE -White onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg ""mirror"" and green asparagus -- my absolute favorite dish of the evening, it was that feeling of home, breakfast on a whole another level. So good, utlimate comfort food. 

And my last favorite: LA FRAISE - Caramel panna cotta topped with fresh strawberries and yogurt foam -- I don't even really enjoy desserts however, this one hit the spot. I love sweet and savory at the same time. 

I thought I would love the Foie gras stuffed quail with mashed potatoes being a signtuare dish and all, but it was just okay. Maybe foie gras shouldnt be stuffed in something because it ends up tasting very irony. He he. (get it?) lol.

The food was fine and we had about 13 items from the menu plus drinks. The highlight was probably the duck and the calamari gnocchi from the tasting b menu.

One member of our party thought that we changed waiters since we didn't see anyone for the entire meal. 

When the bill came, I requested the the gratuity be reduced to about 15% because service was non existent. The hilarious thing is that the waiter got the sommelier to PRETEND that he was the manager.

The food at L'Atelier is definitely at the top of its game-- our amuse bouche was some kind of foamed foie gras. Absolutely mindblowingly ridiculous. Some of my favorite dishes were the onion tart, the mussel soup (which has no mussels at all!), the quail stuffed with foie gras, and the mashed potatoes. Like others have mentioned, the potatoes are really, really tasty. It has an almost fluffed texture-- very creamy and silky. Plus, if you get the truffle version, it's really that much better.

For the 6 course tasting menu, I had the option of trying an assortment of tarts or housemade ice cream. Of course the tarts, right?! Out comes 5 mini slices of tarts, which tasted as good as it looked! The other menu had a champagne infused coconut gelee, which had a strong champagne taste.

Best service, our server was amazing. Super friendly and helpful, couldn't have asked for anything better.
Everything we ordered was amazing. The steak was done perfectly (I'm not a huge meat/steak- eater but this one I could have eaten all day), the salmon was done perfectly. I love salmon but most restaurants overcook salmon, by making it thoroughly cooked, or it's raw like sashimi, but this one was cooked perfectly much like that of a medium-rare steak but for salmon. Absolutely amazing.
For dessert we ordered the chartreuse and another that I forget the name of but it was made with raspberries and white chocolate. Simply amazing.

4692737,2014-08-12,10,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Let me preface by saying that I know I will catch a lot of criticism for going against the grain here because from what I've seen on Yelp, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is universally adored. So why three stars? Two things, the service was abysmal and the menu was underwhelming for what you pay for. 

Service (Grade: F)

Our dinner at L'Atelier was a testament to the importance of good, prompt service and conversely how poor service can destroy a generally well-executed meal in terms of cooking. 

They started out well by being very attentive but this was easy enough as we were the absolute first and only party for dinner. However, service got progressively worse as they siphoned off the wait staff to attend to later arriving parties. At a restaurant with the reputation that comes along with being associated with Joel Robuchon, I found it unacceptable that we had to wait hours and hours for our mains, dessert, etc. The coup de grace was that they had to be reminded that our dinner was to celebrate a birthday even though this was expressed in the reservation and had been told to two separate waiters. 

You just can't forget about a birthday dinner party, especially when the restaurant was not particularly swamped that night, just so you can favor other parties. That kind of chosen neglect was inexplicably rude.

Food (Grade: B)

L'Atelier's prix fixe menus are renowned because they give you several options. Some come with supplemental charges of $10 or more but those are generally the options that are better. 

The amuse bouche of foie gras parfait with a port wine reduction and a Parmesan foam was hit or miss. Half of us liked it the other half didn't finish the tiny shot. 

The Les Pates (supp. charge): lobster chunks over orecchiette was probably one of the better mains. On the other hand, the supplemental charge on the Le Veau (veal ravioli) was not worth it as the dish was bland. 

The La Dorade: snapper carpaccio with lemon glaze was probably the best of the appetizers. However, the La Tomate (chilled tomato gazpacho with burratta) was too salty and felt like drinking marinara sauce straight.

If you're opting for the pre-theater prix fixe menu, the roast of the day (8/9/14) was the free range chicken and it was just okay. 

The desserts were of course beautiful to look at but were not especially noteworthy in terms of flavor. 

Overall, I was expecting something on par with a restaurant like Providence which also has comparably priced prix fixe menus. However, L'Atelier was underwhelming throughout. There are some good dishes but many were weighed down by bad service. Even without considering the service, the food itself did not meet the high expectations and I don't think that was for lack of choosing the ""right"" dishes. We asked our waiter for suggestions and with four in our party we were able to try a broad swath of dishes. Nevertheless, I wouldn't be able to in good faith give a good review because like one in our party said: ""you don't pay a lot to get ignored.""",fiAIkO371It7iR-BdOHPGQ,21,10,3,2HIXaiHVmsDw_rkmnyNkbA

We arrive here on July 27, 2012 and were promptly seated at 6:30PM. The restaurant is gorgeous.  The lighting, the decor, and the staff made the ambience elegant, yet casual and comfortable.  We were seated at the counter facing the open kitchen.  A little intimidating at first, but our waiter put us at ease right away with his humor and warm smile.

It was tough to choose what to order.  I wanted to try as many dishes as possible, so naturally, the summer tasting menu for $159 was the best option.  My boyfriend ordered a la carte.  He chose the A5 Wagyu ribeye steak and the carbonara spaghetti.  Since we informed the waiter we were going to share everything, he took the liberty to let the chef know so they can split the a la carte items into two smaller plates and incorporate them into our tasting menu.  

Everything was so delicious!  I cannot say I had a favorite dish, since I loved each dish so much.  I especially liked the foie gras stuffed quail.  The wagyu ribeye was to die for.  The white onion tart was absolutely delightful.  

We had such an amazing experience here.  Watching the chefs prepare our dinner was so entertaining.  I can now truly appreciate the amount of time and thought it takes for food plating.

I had the $155 discovery prix fix, which came out to about $200 without wine.  For $200, I actually prefer the pretentious environment.  For that kind of money, homeboy in the tux should be coming by after every course and scoop bread crumbs off the table with his bread-crumb-scraper.  But no...the environment was very informal...there was no scoopage of bread crumbs.  

BREAD
It comes out in a pretty assortment.  Careful when you bite into it...the only thing harder and colder is the butter that comes out with it.  

PORTIONS
Portions are hilariously small.  I searched for hidden cameras expecting my boy Joel to pop out from behind the counter and tell me I've been punkd....and then proceed to give me the rest of my food.  Joel was not to be found, and neither was the rest of my food - the food I paid 200 fucking dollars for.  

My friend, 5'0, 95 lbs with a tiny appetite said she was at 60% capacity at the end of the meal.  Do the math.

COURSES
Each course got progressively better and I can now say I've had easily the best lamb of my life.  It came in two medallions served with a potato puree, some greens, and roasted garlic.  The meat was not gamey at all and melted in my mouth.  

CHICKEN TERIYAKI?
I thought it would be worth mentioning that they had chicken teriyaki as one of the choices for main course on a prix fix.  That's right folks...chicken fuckin teriyaki.  For this price range, Mr. Teriyaki himself better have prepared the dish.  And it better be fed to me by two hot geishas.  Just sayin.",ZI43zlKUCjOVdEgcccs2bw,0,0,3,Zs8KhcseVFv-a6Z7Oimp3w

So, one friend saw Anthony Bourdin raving about Joel Robuchon on TV in Australia, while my Cali girl was sold after seeing a show about his decadent mashed potatoes - we decided that our big night in Vegas was worthy of the ""Chef of the Century"" - so, we ditched our other ""economical"" friends and savored a night at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (followed by dancing into the wee hours).

And, we made the right decision! My group of 4 friends, two from Australia, enjoyed the entire evening being very well taken care of here!
The friendly executive chef was attentive and informative.
The handsome servers were professional and responsive.
The artfully presented courses were compact bundles of dynamite flavors, served at the appropriate temps.
Thegenerously poured wines were perfectly paired.

We had 2 servings of the mashed potatos, the dish that lured us to this restaurant, to start with, and we were very pleased. As a vegetarian, I was not thrilled with spaghetti as one course, but my other courses really made up for that. My friends all were very satisfied with all their dishes. The group agreed that the light sorbet dessert was preferred to the rich tarts, because we were very full after 5 courses. 
By the way, not all seating is at the bar - we sat at a table for 4.

The staffs were really nice and friendly. But, as the night continue the staffs were all over the place. Generally, My boyfriend and I are very relaxed people and we are not hard to please, but considering that this restaurant is a 1 Michelin star, it's different. 

It's very typical that they give you new plates and utensils before the new course comes out, there was a couple of time that they forgot. For the very last dish, one of the waitresses ruined the presentation of the dessert as well.

The food did not impress me. Their tasting menu was quite expensive as well, and I've tasted better ones. 

Overall, I feel as though this place shouldn't have been a Michelin star. It could be that they had an 'off' night. For the price of what we were paying, I expected a much better dining experience.",h8fFwhxblUnRh2MkfYqAcg,1,0,2,f1e3dwoUrJxyEwepReiUyw

Why 6:45? They have a pre-theater menu for $39. Three courses served at once for a cheap price! (you will be pleasantly full and still make it to your Cirque du Soleil show!)

Why bar? Because unlike most bars, if you sit in the bar area, you are actually looking at the kitchen. W00t for seeing chefs carefully prepare your food. . . . sort of reminded me of Pixar's Ratatouille!

Why L'Atelier? they have really interesting and strange things, such as ham from a pig raised on acorns. . . I never knew there were only acorn eating pigs!!! The previous time I went, the dessert was sago topped with peach slices made into a rose and POP ROCKS! They are creative and use very unique ingredients. 

The food does tend to be a little smaller portioned than we overindulgent Americans are used to. However, the french baguette here really is the best I have ever had, and will have you reaching for your 5th one before the end of the meal. (I am a HUGE baguette fan: Once ate an entire one as a 3rd grader. . . yes. . . it did result in a tummy ache.  .)

All the food is prepared excellently and beautifully.  The meat is never tough and always juicy and flavorful! Though be forewarned, if you do order anything steak or duck, ask for a steak knife! The regular knife, while being beautiful is less useful for eating food than a letter opener. 

At these prices and with this ambiance you should come, relax, enjoy, be amazed and return often :)

We had just watched the Andrea Bocelli concert in the MGM and came across Joel Robuchon's restaurant, L'Atelier. We knew about Mr. Robuchon's Michelin star restaurant and were dying to try it. but because the show ended so late, L'Atelier stopped serving kitchen food but were still serving desserts. So of course we sat down. 

The breakdown:
Le Chocolat- chocolaté sensation, cremeux, araguani, oreo cookie crumbs. 
The description sounds like it would be really heavy chocolate dessert of some sort but in reality it wasn't. The main point was really the textures (the cream, araguani, oreo cookie crumbs) harmonizing and balancing to form the perfect taste.

La Framboise- fresh raspberry surprise inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream.
This one is a bit hard to explain. The dish comes out with a white chocolate sphere in a bed of drizzled raspberry sauce. The server then pours warm raspberry sauce over the sphere which melts the white chocolate sphere and reveals the surprise inside, yuzu ice cream. Delicate presentation, an art really. The taste was tangy with textures of wafer.
La Chartreuse- green chartreuse soufflé, pistachio ice cream
This one needs 15 minute prep time. A wedge of pistachio ice cream is pushed into the warm soufflé top. The texture of the soufflé was airy, light and in combination with the ice cream was perfection. 

Every plate was beautiful, even the coffee. I'm hoping to come back here and eat again sometime.",Tc-FR2ZE7kruMXs_N6E2tQ,2,2,5,Cb5HxPnEnYPNRfWtGCrEEw

The ambiance is intimate and romantic. It is a smaller restaurant, so reservations are encouraged (although the night we were there, they did have room for walk-ins). We sat at the bar and although surrounded by people, it oddly felt private. The bar offers a front row seat to the ""development of your meal"". You can watch the detail and concentration that goes into each plate. I however, was too focused on my company. I wish I would have paid attention to the chefs a bit more. 

The wine selection is superb! We started out with a bottle Darioush Signature Cabernet Sauvignon and made our way to the Caymus Special Select. I highly recommend either. 

Upon sitting they bring you out an Amuse Bouche; which was a foie gras parfait. It was outstanding!

Nutrition is my forte, not fine dining, but I'll take a stab at describing the cuisine anyway. Our first dish ordered was the Iberico de Bellota - this was toast with tomato and thinly sliced cured ham. The toast offered a nice coat for the vino and the generous portion of iberico ham was cured to perfection. Next we ordered the king crab in a salad. It comes with a generous portion of crab legs on a bed of greens with tomato and fresh mozzerella. The vegetables paired nicely and each flavor complimented one another. It was good, but not mind-blowing. Per a friend's suggestion, we ordered the Crispy Langoustine Fritter with Basil Pesto. I wish we would have ordered one of these and shared as it comes with two pieces and neither of us finished it. It was good, not great, but then again I am not a lobster fan so it's probably unfair for me to speak to this dish. I will say it was battered and definitely not healthy. We saved the best for last as our last dish was by far the best! We ordered the Malabar pepper-coated beef tenderloin. I have never had a better steak in my life. It was PHENOMENAL. This alone makes the place Michelin star worthy. It is a must-order!

Our dessert was amazing too! I unfortunately forgot the name, so this part is to be continued. 

The only thing I was not impressed with was the service. Our server was extremely knowledgeable (but in a condescending way) and very dry. However, he was aware, attentive, but not bothersome. It would've be nice if he was a little warm.

My wife also had the caramelized quail, and then she opted for the beef (hanger steak with fries), and the waygu beef and foie gras sliders. Of course the meal starts off with a fabulous bread assortment, which I tend to end up eating all the bread that we are served here with the salted butter. My torchon arrived first along with her sliders. The amount of foie gras served with a quince jam was more than ample, and easily the best thing I ate all evening. My wife loves foie gras, so naturally I shared this with her. She in turn shared her sliders with me, delicious! they were served with fries, with a ginger gastrique. My wife commented the sauce was very strong, but I loved it with the fries. Frankly, I was already starting to get full after just this course, but was excited when my lobster pasta arrived. It had large pieces of lobster, perfectly cooked pasta and the sauce was similar to a lobster bisque. My wife's beef arrived, and we sampled each other's plates. At first, I think I was going to be jealous of her steak, but as I ate more of the pasta, especially with the large chunks of lobster, I think mine was the winner by a claw. Finally, our quail offerings arrived. The quail was perfectly caramelized, and you could taste the flavor in the thigh meat. Chef added some herbs to the Pom purée, for a great touch. As I was hoping, we were each given an additional serving of the purée, thank you! A small herb salad provided some relief from the richness of the course. Since we each had a dessert selection, but we were already both stuffed, we opted for a cheese plate and the mango sorbet. Frankly, while the cheeses were great, I am more used to having this as an initial course or simply when we get one tapas plate somewhere else,  but my wife explained to me that this is culturally typical of French and other European cuisine. Finishing off with the mango sorbet was a perfect end to an amazing meal. Even though we arrived an hour and a half later than our original reservation time, they accommodated us. we were the last ones out (more than an hour after close), but we never felt rushed or that the staff was annoyed at our lateness. We have always enjoyed the ambience and Decor here. Is this an expensive meal, yes, but having been here before, we are well aware that you get what you pay for, and with this establishment, you do!

Reservation was available a week out, unlike 60 days next door. They also called the same day to reconfirm.

Was offered a seat at the bar facing the open kitchen and opted for the tasting menu.

There was some talent in the open kitchen preparing my meal, which was definitely a delight in my book! 

The tasting menu is ~10 courses at ~$165, ~1/3 the price of Joel Robuchon next door.

Most of the dishes were precise, but still light years behind Joel Robuchon.

Highlights:
- Croissant from Bread Basket
- Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam
- White onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus
- Quail
- Beef
- Foie Gras
- Scallop

Okay:
- John Dory Fish (Fish came out somewhat dry)
- Crab Dish (The jelly was odd)

Service at the end of the meal was horrendous. Placed my M Life and credit card in the portfolio for payment and my M life card was missing a few minutes later with the folio. Being discreet, I informed my waiter, Kawika, who cleverly claimed that he didn't receive my M Life card. After a good 30 seconds, he grabbed my M Life card from behind the cashier and went to the back to add ""credit"" to my M Life card. After a good 5 minutes, he returned, claiming that points were added.

To triple-check, I went to the M Life counter at the MGM and the agent informed me that there was no pending transaction from L'Atelier?!?

One of the servers dropped the quail entree on my friend. He was very apologetic, but again, it was a very strange thing to occur at such a nice establishment.

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for my birthday this past weekend and made reservations at L'Atelier for Sunday night. The restaurant offered four different options - a prix fixe tasting menu for $148; an a la carte menu of small plates (you're supposed to choose three to five for a full meal); an ""American"" a la carte menu with large entrees and appetizers; and a special winter tasting menu promotion. 

At $75 for five courses, we couldn't pass up the winter tasting menu aka recession special. The meal started with the foie gras amuse bouche that other Yelpers have raved about - and OH MY GOD it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. 

The winter tasting menu began with a tower of grilled vegetables interspersed with buffalo mozzarella, which was simple but very tasty. The second course was a langoustine fritter served with a basil pesto sauce and some greens; we didn't know what a langoustine was, so the server explained that it's like a prawn that tastes like a lobster, which was a spot-on description. The main entree was either a choice of sea bass or beef, though our server let me sub in the free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and served with truffled mashed potatoes for free. I'm so glad I did this - it was definitely the best quail I've had in my life (not that I've had that many) and was much better than my boyfriend's sea bass, which was good but not great. The fourth course was a cheese plate that came with three large slices of cheese (one cow's milk, one sheep's milk and one goat's milk). We ended our meal with the dessert course, which was a choice of either a plate of tarts or an assortment of sorbets; I got the sorbets and my boyfriend got the tarts - both were excellent. 

The service was great and it was really cool to be able to watch the chefs work in the kitchen. With a glass of wine each, our total bill including tax and tip came to about $220. Even though that's still pretty pricey for dinner, we thought it was a fantastic value for what we got.

Ambience - 5/5 stars. Fairly small restaurant with the option of sitting at the bar to watch the chefs/sous chefs and the rest of their kitchen team do their thing or sitting at the tables if you'd rather talk to your party.

Service - 5/5 stars. Had to change our party of 2 to a party of 4 and it was not a problem. Our main server was very helpful in recommending what to try and our food runner (?) or second server was also very friendly and so down to earth which is ALWAYS a plus.

Food - 5/5. Oh. My. Goodness. Worth every penny that we paid for. Since we arrived at 6:20, we were able to order 2 sets of the pre-theater fixe menu. That came with the chef's palette cleanser (foie grais), an appetizer from their list of choices, and the roast of the day which was a suckling pig. For the appetizers we ordered the white asparagus soup and the ceviche. We ordered another set dinner (Option B) which came with the chefs palette cleanser, two appetizers, and two entrées of your choice (that you can choose from a selected menu). Everything was spectacular ! So spectacular that even 2 months later, we are STILL talking about that night.

I booked everything through the convenience of their website (but I believe OpenTable also offers the option of booking a table at their restaurant) and noted that we were going to be there to celebrate an anniversary. Lo and behold, at the end of the dinner we got a complimentary dessert! Such a nice gesture and took our dining experience over the top.

It's a good idea to try to be seated at the bar top because it's a front row seat to watch the kitchen come to life. Every dish is plated right in front of your eyes! 

There are choices to choose a la carte dishes or prefixed menus to choose from. We had one discovery menu and another selection of small plates and there was plenty of food to share. The menu is heavily equipped with foie gras and black truffle; rare commodities. 

Some of my favorite dishes included: the shrimp Carpaccio, Sea Scallop, Beef cheeks, the buttery mashed potatoes, and the Caribbean sorbet! It was out of this world- not even kidding. Each of these dishes really accentuated the flavors; perfectly balancing my pallet. Definitely did not expect to enjoy each plate as much as I did. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised!

We opted for the 9 course tasting menu and everything was pretty good, but I think it's a little bit too decadent for a tasting menu.

My favorite course was the roasted langoustine which was cooked perfectly and had a beautiful buttery texture that just melts in your mouth. This was accompanied by a fantastic fennel salad.

My second favorite was the seared kampachi which was both light but complex at the same time.

I wasn't a big fan of the duck foie gras. The texture wasn't my favorite as I like my foie grilled and it was a little too big a piece of foie for a tasting menu. I know I don't have to eat all of it but I felt compelled since I was shelling out some big bucks for the meal.

Was celebrating a bday the night we came, and in addition to the desserts that were already on the tasting menu, we received an extra plate of mini treats (fruit tart, chocolate hazelnut cake) with ""happy birthday"" written on the plate w/ a candle. It was a very nice added bonus.

The tasting menu is the perfect amount of food...you don't leave hungry, but at the same time, you don't leave not being able to walk (compared to the 16 course tasting next door).

If you have the chance, this is a MUST-TRY restaurant in Vegas.

I finished with the White Chocolate Mousse with Chocolate Pearls. It reminded me alot of Mon Ami Gabi's. 

The drinks were nice, but nothing special. I got the raspberry mojito which didn't have enough flavor and kick to it. The wine decent, but I paid $12-18 per glass!

We decided to order a couple of small plates to share so we could sample more food. Since we were fans of foie gras (and you can't get that in California, not legally anyway), many of the dishes we selected contained foie. 

Amuse bouche - foie gras parfait - Definitely the bomb! I'd even pay to order and have more of this!

Hamachi - I felt that there was too much olive oil and it overpowered the rest of the ingredients as well as the freshness of the fish. 

King crab - Didn't like that the radish taste overpowered the sweetness of the king crab. The radish provided a nice crunch, but there was too much. We ended up cuting up the radish to half portion and eating it with the crab, which was much better.

Poached chilled Foie gras - Yum!! Definitely must try.

Seared foie gras - Honestly it was a little different for me since I enjoy the seared taste of the foie gras alot. However, this dish came in an asian tasting broth which dampened the taste quite a bit. It was good, but I didnt enjoy it as much.

Quail with stuffed foie gras - Beautifully cooked. Tender quail meat, goes very well with the foie. Yummy.

Spaghetti with uni, caviar and poached egg - The portion for this is rather big so I'm glad we split it between the two of us. The spaghetti is cooked al dente, but I personally would have preferred it to be cooked through since I like my noodles soft. The sauce was extremely good and delightfully rich. This dish just had everything right.

The experience dining here was really fun since we had a counter seat and we could watch the chefs working the line cook our food, observing how the kitchen works, and how the executive chef upholds his food standards.

Well, we splurged and L'Atelier is now one of my FAVORITE and MUST GO to places EVER!!

I was a bit surprised to be seated at the counter and realized that we had full view of the chef and all the action!  Saw the chef whipping up the most decadent potatoes! OMG - the work they put into it is definitely reflected in the dish!!

Hubby and I each got Menu A - which is the Amuse-Bouche, 3 menu choices and 1 dessert selection.  We figured that allowed us to taste at least 8 different little dishes!  It was AWESOME!!  First we started with the Amuse-Bouche - which was foie gras served in a little cup with this delicious foam on top.  If I could I would've licked the inside of the little cup but I didn't want to seem vulgar or rude... so tempted though....

Hubby had the octopus carpaccio and I have to say - this was done perfectly! seasoned perfectly - tender... delicate! amazing!  I had the yellowtail served as a ravioli, with sea urchin and osetra caviar! I still remember the taste, the creamy texture... indescribable - SO mind blowing! 

Hubby then went for the veggies - Seasonal vegetables medley with Spanish virgin olive oil and I have to say - it was delicious!! so fresh and refreshing! Glad one of us is a healthier eater.  I on the other hand had their seared duck foie gras that came with a poached pear with toasted pistachios on top!  Eating it together was like absolute heaven - perfectly balanced - decadent... UGH so GOOD!

Hubby then had the Le Boeuf which was the casserole braised beef cheeks with red wine sauce.  They brought it out in a little casserole dish and plated in front of us - pouring the sauce on top - that was the BEST beef cheeks EVER!! So tender, flavorful! AWESOME!!  My next choice was the beef and foie gras burger with frittes! OMG so absolutely decadent.  Two little burgers with perfectly seared pieces of foie gras with the most soft and toasted little buns ever!!  with my little side of ""frittes""...  I loved that it wasn't a lot but just the right amount!! this tasting menu thing is PERFECT!! If my tummy could do it I'd get the full tasting but I didn't think I could do it!  Our neighbor at the counter next to us - who's a regular was this wonderful articulate woman ""Angelica"" who shared a piece of one of her dishes - it was a thinly sliced piece of raw beef - OMG - SO AWESOME!!!

And then we ended our meal with dessert - hubby had the ""carrot cake""... yeah right - it was a little carrot cake that LOOKED LIKE a CARROT! it was a delicious piece of art!!  And it came with a coconut sobet!  I will definitely post a picture.  I had the Les Tartes - So I asked - what tarts do you have - response - ""oh you get a little piece of all""! The first was their recreation of a snickers bar! (way better than snickers of course), then their lemon meringue (not too tart, not too sweet and very light!), apple crisp (flaky crust with delicious apple), passion fruit tart (AWESOME) and a pear and apple tart! SO delicious - light and flavorful with light crust! Perfect little bites of perfect tarts!! 

And of course we had drinks - LOVED their blueberry pom with ginger beer - hubby had a great drink as well - unfortunately can't remember the name but I will say our new ""friend"" had quite a few different drinks - was so tempted ...

LOVE this place and will definitely come here EVERYTIME we come to Vegas!!  Definitely recommend reservations and sitting at the counter is a great experience.

Very good, as fine dining goes. And at $75, the four course tasting menu was a good value. Service was on the ball and the menu was varied. 

But what makes this experience unique in my book is sitting at the counter and watching the kitchen painstakingly prepare my meal. Those intricate and fanciful dishes take a steady hand...only to be taken down by yours truly, minutes after preparation. So if you have a small party, make a reservation for the counter seating...it's pretty darn cool :)",p8RS_rLHaNwA5vF6C98nBw,8,7,4,Jcf_W2LrvZC1fv3bfEVbgg

Didn't even announce to my server about my best friend's birthday but they managed to come out with a birthday dessert platter lit up with a candle and everything! The best part? They only charged us for ONE tasting menu rather than two and the fact that we were both fairly young comparing to other clienteles made us feel entirely welcomed.

I started off the meal with Le Hamachi, which was uni wrapped in hamachi sashimi - as both a hamachi and uni fan, this was just fantastic. That was followed with Les Legumes, which was a pleasant salad (I was expecting more legume type vegetables, but these were mostly leafy greens and tomato). I also enjoyed a deviled egg with crab, and a creamy pasta dish with uni. Perhaps the highlight of the meal was La Sole, which was a whole Dover sole fish cooked on the Japanese teppanyaki grill with a butter meuniere sauce. The sole was much larger than all other dishes and was absolutely delicious.

They were all good and interesting dishes, the portions were small though, which was to be expected. My wife got a similar menu. To drink I had their signature mojito and she had a fruit juice cocktail. Our bill ended up coming to about $150, for restaurants in this price range we just thought we've had better food.

The tasting menu is what you'd expect: starter, soup, entree, dessert, tea, (we got a bottle of pinot noir around 150, body, as good as you'd expect from the Robuchons!). The quality and taste were nothing surprising but definitely lived up to its standards, except they didn't replace the spilled soup!!!! which was actually surprising....

Keep the normal restaurant for special occasions, but if you just want the good food, wine, and service, stick to L'Atelier. I had the full tasting menu and it did not disappoint. I think it was 10 courses. All were spectacular, some inventive, some traditional. Also had the wine pairing, only to ever surpass it was the French Laundry pairing, but this was as good or close.

Favorites included:
- L'Amuse Bouche or Foie gras parfait with port wine and Parmesan foam- subtle and savory, a great way to start
- Les Langoustines, Langoustines cooked in their shells with green curry and coconut sauce. Inventive spin on a traditional french dish, perfectly cooked langoustine, sauce did not over power it. 
- Foie gras stuffed free range quail with mashed potatoes - nothing to say bu t decadent. Mmm
- La Margherita - Yogurt ice cream with tequila gelee, fresh blackberries and POP ROCKS, yes pop rocks. Never would expect this from a french chef, but this was again inventive and tasty.

Robuchon's dishes were simple yet subtly elegant and full of flavors.  I'm drooling just thinking about the foie gras stuffed quail and the juicy medium rare perfection rib eye.

I also liked the overall atmosphere and the black and red decor of the restaurant.  The space is small with only a few tables and about 15-20 stools along a wood counter overlooking the kitchen.

Our dinner: 
Langostina 
Duck foie gras 
Wagyu foie gras mini sliders 
Spiced lobster 
Tart tar de salmon with avocado 
A mini seared steak (forgot the name) 
House mini smashed potatoes. 
- must try especially if your having any kind of meats. It blends well. They are not you're typical smashed potatoes. It had a really yummy buttery grits flavor to them. Very addicting. 

Everything had its unique taste and cooked to perfection. Of course all smaller portions but it's all about the flavor. You will also not leave hungry. 

You could just go for one of their larger meals. We ordered 2 of their larger plates. The duck foie gras with grapefruit accompanied with the mini smashed potatoes. This was good as a main meal. My hubby also ordered the 6oz steak and that could had been good for a single main meal. Yes we did have food left over!

MENUS:
$78 which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, fish or meat, dessert
$105 which includes amuse bouche, appetizer, soup, fish, meat, dessert
A la carte dishes also available 

I opted for the $78 menu and ordered:
*Chicken Egg on a crispy polenta galette & black truffle ($15 supplement) - Amazingly delicious and worth paying the supplement.  The polenta was crispy, topped with a runny egg yolk and garnished with thin slices of black truffle and parmesan.  A mouthwatering dish that had me wanting more.
*Lobster bisque with asparagus - So delicious!!  The bisque was creamy with a slight lobster flavor.  Chopped up pieces of lobster and asparagus could be found as you scooped up the soup. 
*Braised beef cheeks w/carrots & red wine sauce - Delicious and extremely tender.  Mashed potatoes accompanied the dish which I thought were good, but a bit too heavy and buttery for me.
*Ice cream & sorbet - The perfect sweet and tart ending to the meal.  A small scoop of pistachio ice cream, banana ice cream, and raspberry sorbet is served on top of a few small slivers of fruit.  

WHAT TO KNOW:
*Casual dining: jeans acceptable, but presentable shoes
*Sleek modern look with tables and counter seating and an open kitchen
*Reservations can be made on Opentable, however it told us there weren't any reservations available.  We were able to get a reservation after calling L'Atelier directly
*Portion sizes are on the smaller side so order an additional dish or load up on bread
*Three different types of bread are served with a delicious butter topped with sea salt.  My favorite bread was the round flakey one. 
*Choice of still (Evian), sparkling, or tap water

On the other hand, if you put your name on something you are putting your reputation on it as well. I will also admit that when I spend this much money on a meal, I want my world rocked, so my expectations are pretty high.
The restaurant overall is nice and I do like the idea of all the seats centered around the kitchen, it is really amazing to watch how things come together and the work that goes into the process.
The biggest complaint I had was with the service, the servers seemed rushed and did not make me feel they were interested in discussing the food or helping me choose the best options. They did describe the dishes when they were served, but it felt scripted and without passion. That being said, water stayed full, I was followed up on and greeted immediately, so the service was professional and efficient.
The food overall was pretty good. As others have mentioned the bread basket is awesome to start the meal. I ordered the choose your own 4 course meal. I started with the butter poached oysters and they were fresh and buttery, enough said. I moved on to the langoustine fritters and they were simple and tasty. From there I had the onion tart, which I honestly thought was greasy and lacked flavor. I finished with the lobster pasta, which was very good with a little spice. They also serve a potato puree with all the large plates, which was half butter (literally) and  amazing.  I finished with the mango mousse and it was good, but honestly the dessert I had across the hall at the Italian place in the casino was equally as good.
So overall it was a pretty good meal, it is just for over $200 I wanted it to be a memory and it did not deliver on that level.",vrFHmCw77G_qIgOtJiD98Q,1,0,3,Kkv8WGOmsiJcuQscQgZHOw

As you now this is an upscale counter service version of his restaurant and everyone was dressed for the experience.  This is counter service so you will be sitting close and next to other patrons, so be prepared to be open and friendly as well as hearing interesting conversations. Now there are two tasting menus. One for $69  with 5 courses and the other for $155 with 8-10 courses.  ( this is without the wine pairing). We, of course were splurging but being penny wise, chose the 5 course.  As the vegetarian, I requested a veggie menu, which they do have. It is typically set up for the $155 menus but they can build you one for the $69 menu.  I started with the amusez bouche of a tomato gelee with an avocado topper.  It was like gazpacho but even better.  Then I was served the split pea soup with a spicy shaving on it and it was so good that  I wanted to lick the bowl. Next came an onion and asparagus tart.  In a word, Yum!  My main course was the truffle and Parmesan spaghetti. It was creamy and decadent. My boyfriend (the meat eater) had the beef cheek as his main and loved it!  In true French style, next came a 3 piece assortment of cheeses ( 1 French and 2 Wisconsin cheeses).  And lastly, the dessert, which was a choice of 5 gelatos or 5 types of tarts. If you are not into a lot of chocolate go with the gelato option.  We had a wonderful gourmand experience and it is worth trying this once, but note your bill will still come out close to $200-250 ( with tax and tip) even if you choose the less expensive option and do not do any alcohol and enjoy one of their two non-alcoholic cocktails instead. Save your pennies for this experience!

I've been fortunate to have been able to dine at both and can say that I've become a fan of Joel Robuchon.  The decor is contemporary and the open kitchen concept (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=LEp1nXhlTZGeu92-8oLepQ) offers a more relaxed atmosphere than the more formal dining next door.

I had a few dishes that I had in mind that I knew I wanted and after a few minutes of figuring out how hungry we were, we decided on the seasonal discovery tasting menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=poPCaItVyrlBqNPN9QaM1g).  Just shortly after our water was pourted, the bread basket was placed in front of us (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=vANaZCAp5sZ1twkUoDhDpQ).  Unlike Robuchon, L'Atelier only offers a few choices for bread.  All 3 varieties were very good but the olive oil and sea salt croissant was amazing, flakey and very very tasty.

L'amuse bouche (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=s4DFz4jjdW5Orjy0DRI89w).  Avocado and cilantro flavored grapefruit gelee.  The grapefruit aftertaste left the palate with a light and refreshing and wished I had more than just the little shot glass.

Les tomatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=8yXf9FzHhCdMuUtFWjnOSg).  The heirloom tomato salad was perfectly seasoned as the basil oil and fleur de sel perfectly matched the natural sweet taste of the tomatos.

Les huires (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=AHQwwTC1cwwoPbnkQ-CqGg).  Poached baby Kussi oysters with French echire butter.  I can honestly say that I'm not a fan of oysters but damn were these tasty.  I've tasted Kussi oysters at Bouchon and thought they were good but these little bad boys blew those out of the water.  May have been the butter...what isn't good with butter??

Le crabe royal (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=rCkQiJcs-_n9RWujERb8Sw).  My piece of crab was a little chewy, maybe just an older piece of crab but was tasty nonetheless.  The lemongrass oil left a refreshing aftertaste but wasn't overly impressed with the vegetables on top of the crab.

L'asperge (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=PjsxdV1hyr7eKE1307E0Xg).  I was excited to see Iberico ham served with this dish but was disappointed with the two tiny hair like slivers on top of the quail egg.  The asparagus was perfectly cooked and was very flavorful.  After tasting the Iberico ham, I knew I had to order a side of it.

Iberico ham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=BDdtenuj3Ebg3Av31tIZgg).  This was brought out after the sole filet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=1rLS5dKtwK0fT648QeKR7g).  At this point of the meal, I was getting extremely full and slightly buzzed as I ordered the wine pairing.  That didn't stop me from devouring the entire plate.  OMG I wish we could readily get this ham from a local butcher shop here in LA.  The ham was sliced paper thin and literally melts in your mouth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=zG_PPE50tHeJMxOG2qhHRQ).

La sole (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=VKMyGyUvRs_6-OSDiQB2aQ).  The sole filet was perfectly cooked and the buttery shellfish sauce perfectly complemented the fish.  

For the main entree, I ordered the La caille (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=oteuPqbgHifhbotTvM-RAQ).  One reason is that I'm a huge fan of quail and that fact that I hate lamb.  The piece of foie gras was slightly overcooked but the quail was awesome.  Robuchon mashed potatoes were velvety and very very rich.  A must try if you haven't had Robuchon mashed potatoes.  

La fraise (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=0Wg3dw22rV_uCGLUaBHmQA).  Mascarpone panna cotta topped with fresh strawberries and served with balsalmic ice cream.  The strawberries and balsalmic ice cream tasted amazing together.  The panna cotta at the bottom was also very good.

La mure (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=lHll2a6IDnyYUcY4JWGGSg).  Blackberry compote w/ spice cake and rhubarb sorbet.  Another awesome dessert.

Le cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=l22vhvGXgmTjYT81Azg80A).  French pressed coffee served with a piece of chocolate!!

No worries, the red decor has no resemblance to a cheap Chinese restaurant.  Only French luxury. My only disappointed is that the restaurant is located at the MGM Grand. It's justly simple become a Ghetto Hotel.

The cuisine was exceptional. Smoke salmon, foie grais, sea bass and lobster. Yes! The best lobster ever!

Joel Robuchon has several L'atelier restaurants around the world and they signify the vision of Robuchon, named the chef of the century. Serving in small plate Tapas style one has the fortune of exploring various dishes in one dinner.
 Dishes are immaculately conceived and beautiful in both presentation and flavor. It is a real experience for anyone who loves food to sit at the counter around the kitchen and watch masters prepare each plate. The environment of the restaurant is inviting and fun. Service is top notch and dishes are quick to your counter or table.
The L'Unique menu is an unbeatable offer and is served within 15 minutes. How else could one have world class food, in 15 minutes to get you in and out in time for your show? The MGM is one of the best hotels in Vegas for food and entertainment and to eat for such an affordable price and make it comfortably in time for any of the shows at MGM or even at another hotel is worth your business.
Even dishes as simple in pairing as Duck breast and turnip are cooked to such elegance and perfection that it remains one of my favorite bites ever. There is no excuse to miss the opportunity to eat at L'atelier. This restaurant is affordable, inviting, service takes as long as you want it to, and is a culinary experience.",7LdHbcbVImxsnRFjWooYkQ,2,1,5,3iXgsqRDLY_KEtTHhiF1mA

We decided on the seasonal discovery tasting menu and wine pairing and were absolutely blown away. The service, presentation, creativity, quality, and the total overall dining experience was phenomenal. A huge thing for me is being able to taste the love in the food, and here you could not only taste the love but could see the love being put into the meticulous creation of each dish. 

We loved all of the dishes, but there were two that left us licking our plates and wanting more:

Foie Gras Parfait- the parmesan emulsion and the richness of the foie gras made this exceptional! 

Quail- one of the best dishes I've ever had. Stuffed with foie gras. Amazing. 

Everything was incredible but one of the servers said it perfectly when helping me to decide between the steak and Quail; the steak is amazing, but you can order steak anywhere. The steak WAS amazing, and cooked perfectly. But, the Quail is unlike anything you've ever had. 

The desserts were simply incredible. The strawberry mousse was so fresh and light and the Le Chocolat...best chocolate cake I've ever had! So light, moist. 

Love the open concept and being able to watch the chefs and cooks prepare the meals. Each plate is meticulously created and won't be brought out until perfected. We even watched one of the cooks hold off on sending the dish out until he fixed the position of a garnish. All dishes are works of art.

The wine pairings were also incredible. The sparking rose was one of the most unexpected, delicious pairings of the night!

The servers were all friendly and especially towards the end of the night and as the restaurant cleared out, we were able to chat with them a bit more. It's hard to find a restaurant with a perfect balance of service and food, and here it was exceptional all around.

Suggest to sit at the middle of the bar, facing the kitchen.  If you're a foodie, this really adds to the experience and makes it a culinary event.  

This is one of those rare restaurants that had us constantly saying ""wow"", and ""amazing""! The appetizers and entrees are spot on in flavor, you don't even notice whether it is cooked properly, rather pure focus on flavor and texture.  You get immersed in the umami flavors & perfect presentations, very satisfying. 

After having our 2 apps and 2 entrees, we really didn't have the same expectations for the desserts...wrong...again, entertaining plays on coffee, for one dessert and lime and citrus for the other.  Crazy good.

It's $300-500 for 2, depending on which pre-fix menu you choose and wine, but man, i think we might have to make this a regular destination every time we are in Vegas just to get my fix!

I ordered the king crab and cous cous appetizer, osso buco entree and peach panna cotta dessert. While everything was tasty, portions were definitely on the small side, and nothing that blew me away. It wasn't the quality you'd expect from a Joel Robuchon restaurant.

Had our chance when plans at another place in the MGM fell through ( closed for renovation, what?? ), and we wandered up to the front desk near opening time and inquired if they had a spot - just for a couple drinks and a couple dishes.

They are not really that sort of place - reservations seem derigeur - but after momentary hesitation, they found us a seat at the bar.  Not the kitchen bar which takes up most of the restaurant, but the *actual* bar - almost unnoticed, right by the restrooms, about four seats in front of which they produce the cocktails.

The bar guy was friendly, if a little gruff at first.  The drinks were well made.  The food ( we concentrated on foie dishes ) was amazing as usual, even if we didn't quite see it being made this time.

The dinner started with an amuse bouche, a small glass of creamy soup. The exact ingredients for it were unknown due to the server's thick accent. 

We then started the actual menu with a pumpkin-ginger soup with creme fraiche. Comforting and warm, despite not being a huge ginger fan. Next was a crispy langoustine fritter with a basil pesto. Good, but it seemed like a tempura shrimp in a spring roll covering. I did finish it, but it did not scream to me fine dining other than the basil pesto streak on the plate. After that, next was the main. The option was a beef ribeye or Scottish salmon. I had the salmon, which was well made and well presented, but could be finished off quite quickly. It was served with very rich mashed potatoes. A lot of butter in that side. Fourth course was a cheese platter with three types of cheese and breads. Most of my party was not very interested, and the waiter even admitted that the cheeses were ""kind of funky"" (highlight of the night). I finished off most of the cheese, and it seemed like a fairly typical fine dining dish. Final dish was dessert. I ordered the tarts, which included five small slices. All of them were quite solid. 

Overall, everything was technically well done. The portions were not huge, but it is Michelin-style fine dining. My party was full by the time we walked out, but in a couple of hours, we were getting hungry again. For the artistry and number of dishes, the club menu was fairly satisfying.

You're invited to sit at the red and black sushi-bar-style counter with a front row seat to the open kitchen where each dish is painstakingly created to show off la cuisine de Joël Robuchon.

We chose Menu B which allows you to choose 2 appetizers, 2 main courses and 1 dessert from a list of classic French dishes.

Amuse Bouche was the foie gras mousse with a red wine reduction and Parmesan foam. This had great foie gras flavor and was warm and airy in texture.

For our first course of cold appetizers we had the King Crab and Snapper Carpaccio.  The King Crab was 3 clean bites of fresh crab and a bit of crunch from the radish.  The Snapper Carpaccio was light and simply dressed so the clean flavor of the snapper wasn't overpowered.  I would enjoy having this appetizer again.

For our second course of warm appetizers we had the Veal Ravioli and Sautéed Calamari.  I was expecting a richer, beefier flavor from the Ravioli.  The Calamari was perfectly cooked, but a bit under seasoned.

For our first main courses we had the Lobster Orecchietta and Salmon with Spring Vegetable.  The sauce for the Lobster Orecchietta tasted like lobster bisque, we used the table bread to sop it up.  The Salmon was perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned.

For our second main courses we had the Beef Cheeks and Roasted Duck both with Cheesy Mashed Potatoes.  The Beef Cheeks braised in red wine was full of flavor, tender and delicious, this was my favorite of the main courses we tried.  The Roasted Duck was also tender and juicy.

For our desserts we had the Tarts and the La Caipirinha.  There were 5 tarts in the sampler: Chocolate, Orange Cheesecake, Raspberry, Snickers, Custard Cinnamon.  All of the tarts were delicate, true to flavor and delicious.  The La Caipirinha was unusual, a lime ice on top of fruity pastry cream--sweet, citrusy, cold and refeshing.

Service was friendly and less formal, which is inline with the casual dinning concept.  

This is a great date restaurant or place to catch up with a friend as the counter-style seating is most conducive to talking to the person next to you--relax, watch the kitchen do its magic and enjoy.",Iu5isy8VNf1d81o7zDSxSQ,7,3,5,xZdXHzEeXE7jlcVqKW7pzA

Breads - outstanding variety of baked goodies kept us happily munching away.  The carbs were warm, buttery and soft.  A few were flaky and could easily stand on its own without any additional spreads or olive oil.

L'amuse bouche.  Foie gras parfait, an appropriate starter with a silky smooth texture with a light foamy top.  A hearty shot glass with a surprise of foie gras awaiting below.

Le celeri- celery mousse.  The crisps of the chip and the crunch of the carefully placed celery decor blends in with the delicately composed bi-colored base.

Le Saint Jacques- sea scallop.  A feast for the eyes with a soft, yielding texture.  I could find no fault or defect in this perfection.

Les langoustines - melt in your mouth goodness.   Mini lobsters or large prawns poached gently then painted in green, basil pesto sauce.  I'd rather eat these than lobsters.

La cebette- white onion tart.  An impressive dish, toppings of smoked bacon lardons, asparagus, spotlighting the quail egg as the focal point.  The foundation of it all, a crispy but not tough crust that holds it all together.  Masterful.

Le saumon- salmon.  How do they do it?  Another creation that looks so incredibly basic but yet amazingly scrumptious with a non-piscatorial funk.

Le caille- quail stuffed with foie gras.  I may have cracked a tooth on one of their small bones (ouch!!) from eating a bit too hastily.  Could I have another piece?

La mangue- mango mousse.  Creative, exotic gold wrap on dessert.  I didn't know whether to cash it in at the casino cashier or eat it.  

Le chocolat- warm chocolate cake with mint.  Icy mint and warm contrast of cake is never an issue.  Design and color yet another winner.

Expresso finisher.  Warm shot of java to finish off.

Even at the beginning, I was disappointed that our party of 12 was crammed into a high table of all places.  The selection of appetizer bread was quite good, though served at room temperature.  We all opted for the 7-course seasonal degustation menu at $168/person and being a Michelin 1-star restaurant, they certainly charged at 2-star levels.

Highlights included the caramelized free range quail and mint chocolate sorbet.  Everything ranged from decent to solid.  So while nothing was outright bad, none of the food showed any creativity, elegance or passion.  Additionally, the menu provided to us turned out to be incorrect and we were served heirloom tomatoes in place of New Zealand snapper...adequate substitution?  Hardly.

Regarding the service, it was satisfactory at best.  Our servers had great senses of humor, but their execution throughout the meal was choppy in terms of timing and just not very well coordinated.  They also failed to ask about food allergies, necessitating a dish replacement as some of my friends could not eat shellfish.

Hostess: Reservation was made a few weeks in advance on OpenTable with a very specific request to be seated at the best table available for a birthday celebration.  Upon our arrival,  her first question to us was ""where would you like to be seated?"". I looked at her with a blank stare.  She then proceeded to look at the computer screen and finally took notice of the request I made via OpenTable. Instead of recommending a best table, she repeated her question and wished my husband a happy birthday.... You see why I was frustrated here? 

Service:  Decent except towards the end where our server disappeared for a good half hour and we were serviced by several other individuals. Before his disappearance,  our server was very attentive and explained each course thoroughly.

Wine: Reasonably priced but not good enough of a selection. If you are picky with your wine, do not expect to be wowed.

Bread basket: Fresh, warm and toasted, not to mention very tasty.  We were pleasantly surprised. 

Food: One word ""average"".  Amuse bouche had the right idea with the intention to create different textures in one bite.  However, it was overpowered by olive oil and we were not able to taste the fresh tomatoe paste and avocado cream at all.  Scallops were very thinly sliced, briny instead of sweet and almost flavorless. Foie gras soup with black beans tasted like a black bean soup.  Quail stuffed with foie gras was supposedly the highlight of the tasting, however,  portion was tiny. 

Despite all the great reviews online, L'atelier - you have disappointed me and I will not be returning in the future.",GufEiQ97czLWU7TrBv0lOw,2,0,2,gl29f7yB9aJpdD9U-fn86g
5247768,2006-10-06,4,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Ok, so I'm here at this ultra-fabulous suite in the Venetian Hotel on a Thursday night. But instead of being out and going buck-wild hung-lo style all over town, I've decided to share my experience at L'Atelier with my fellow yelpers (woo for you!).

First off, I dig the decor.  Very dark and chic, trendy, cool I think best describes it.  However, I don't like the sushi themed tables where you are forced to sit at a bar.  Although it is comfortable, it's not very good for intimate conversations or playing footsie for that matter.

Second, the food was good, not great.  I'm sorry but if some of you think that's the best tasting menu you've ever had, then you've been to all the wrong restaurants.  The food is good, but the best dish has to be the cocotte of egg with parsley puree, mushroom foam and sauteed chantrelles.  The quail is also a hit, it's served with a soy/chicken demi sauce (or at least that's what I think it tastes like), truffled mashed potatoes, (Joel Robuchon is known for his potatoes, it's one of his signature dishes and is basically your basic pommes puree with an equal amount of french butter added to it.  It's awesome but sickeningly fatty.) and a micro green salad with truffle vinaigrette. Other good dishes include:

Poached kumamoto oysters poached in butter, lemon, chives and sea salt.

Strawberry milkshake with strawberry sherbet, fresh strawberries and pistachio crisps.

Not so good were the:

Assortment of ice creams and sherbets that the waiter failed to identify.

The grilled Santa Barbara Prawns with Romesco Sauce (just didn't feel like it was a real romesco, imho).

and

The scallop carpaccio with lemon marmalade (the marmalade was great), soy, evo, and pepper.

So you ask, 'Hung, if the food was good why only 3 stars?'.  Well if you'd just wait a minute, I'd tell you.

Service.
Service.
Service.

The bill came up to be about 300 dollars for the two of us, one cocktail and a water.  With that being said, service should have been to par with that of a true french restaurant.  The waiters should not have been snobby, unprofessional, unenthusiastic, cold or answered our questions with short remarks.

The conclusion, will I go back?  No.  But I am glad that I went here instead of my initial plans, which were to visit Joel Robuchon's Mansion next door where an average dinner for two runs about a grand.  I won't be revisiting L'Atelier because the cuisine is too Asian for me.  If I'm going to be laying out that kind of dough (which was equivalent to about 15 lap dances at Spearmint Rhino up the street), I should be eating food I know nothing about and enjoying the hell out of it.  And that includes not eating a quail entree served with a sauce my grandmother used to make back at home.

So those are my two cents on Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier, you can take it or you can leave.  AFK now, time to party!",c9qPBVq4CNRCBjvltsaHaQ,5,6,3,0B4iNzhi7kY6vGJJzAUnqQ

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE, this evening featuring crémeux de foie gras au Porto et son émulsion au parmesan.  Essentially a double shot glass served on a stone the Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam was lovely.  Best eaten with a spoon the liver itself was surprisingly mild and melded perfectly (as expected) with the sweet port.  Topped with a foam lending salinity and levity I found this to be a restrained opening flavor that not only paired well with the champagne, but also gave a glimpse of what was to come.

LE FOIE GRAS en duo mêlé de pomme ratte comme un carpaccio aux copeaux de truffe blanche, the dish was described as a carpaccio of foie gras and new potatoes topped with black and white truffle shavings.  A large portion of foie gras and potatoes I'll note that the truffles, though present, played a less prominent role than I'd have hoped.  With chipped parmesan and thin blades of greens and daikon also intertwined in the dish each bite was a new experience - sometimes with the unctuous liver coming to the forefront and at other times with the truffle perfumed potatoes taking center stage.  Though not my favorite dish of the meal, a single bite - foie, daikon, potato, truffle, parmesan - would be the perfect way to describe Robuchon's cuisine...multiple exotic yet restrained flavors coming together to form something entirely original and perfect.

The next course would be the third of four foie gras dishes for the evening.  Titled LE FOIE GRAS frais de canard cuit au torchon this version would be much more simplistic yet even better than the prior manifestation.  For $36 the traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras was delivered as a torchon accompanied by a dusting of espelette and topped with sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Sourced from the Gascony region of France the Foie was sweeter than I expected, though not artificially so.  Arriving with a plate of grilled country bread I imagine this dish took me ~20-25 minutes to eat as I savored each bite.

LA LANGOUSTINE dans une papillote croustillante au basilica, or Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto featured a single Langoustine, sweet and perfect, wrapped in a leaf of basil and flash fried in a batter so thin it was transparent.  With the slight crackle of the shell giving way to sweet and snappy shellfish the effect was tremendous alone and better with the streaks of citrus and garlic pesto on the plate.  At $22 the price point is certainly not for everyone and if I had to eat Langoustine in Vegas I'd go to Twist first, but I was glad to have experienced this.

L'OEUF cocotte et sa crème légère de champignons.  At $19 this is another relatively famous L'Atelier dish.  Featuring a farm fresh egg steamed until barely firm I watched the dish next covered in sautéed mushrooms by one chef while another whipped a foamy broth of cream, mushroom broth, and butter which was subsequently poured over the mushrooms.  Finally topped with salt, pepper, and chili powder the final presentation was visual foam with specks of pepper while beneath lied another perfect balance of ingredients.  Smooth and creamy egg, fibrous mushroom, plenty of butter - yet light as a cloud.

The next course would be a revelation - the sort of dish that on paper seems so simple yet in execution makes you realize why you even go to places like L'Atelier in the first place.  LE RIS DE VEAU clouté de laurier frais à la feuille de romaine farcie featured a single sweetbread-the largest I've ever seen at nearly the size of a tennis balll - pierced with a bay leaf and pan seared in butter, herbs, and veal jus before being paired on the plate with sautéed romaine lettuce in a faintly garlic and dill foam.  At $29 the offal itself cut easily with nothing but a fork and at 5-6 mouthfuls were the best tastes of the meal-almost caramelized on the exterior and creamy within.  A fan of elaborate dishes it is plates like this that remind me just how exquisite simplicity can be when done right.

My final bites from L'Atelier would be another classic dish and the only one seemingly served at each and every L'Atelier-LA CAILLE au foie gras, caramélisée avec une pomme purée truffée.  At $28 the portion was certainly small, but the impact of the caramelized foie gras stuffed free-range quail with Robuchon's famous truffled-mashed potatoes is undeniable-the whole plate is simply decadence defined.  Somewhat unbalanced compared to the other dishes I will note that the crispy quail was quite mild compared to the creamy liver, but obviously it's not like I mind the flavor of foie gras.  The potatoes - there really isn't anything else that can be said...having had the buttered version last year all I can say is that the truffles make them even better.

Outstanding service and a true experience to watch the kitchen I'd definitely head back for a couple courses regularly if I lived locally, and of course to see what Chef Guechida was doing pastry side.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,5,atGg_31rwAYrIE8ZymqVOg

Oh and if you have never had Joel Robuchon's mashed potatoes, please add that to your bucket list, oh my word were those exquisite!!!  Every course was plated beautifully and with finesse.

We had to wait 15 minutes because our table wasn't ready but once we sat down we were greeted immediately. We ordered the seared foie gras with black beans which was super moist and flavorful. One of my friends ordered the 4 course tasting menu which included the hamachi tartare which was delish, the tomato gazpacho. We weren't a fan of it, it tasted like V8 juice. Then had the cod flakes which was wayyyy to fishy. I had the seared tuna which was amazing. The spaghetti we ordered as a side dish was extremely good and I really enjoyed it. The mashed potatoes were very smooth and creamy. We enjoyed the desert which was the panna cotta. Only discrepancy I had was service was pretty slow and we waited for an alcoholic beverage for at least 20 minutes and the bread was cold not warm as if it's been sitting around but it was still good.

5308062,2011-05-21,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"A different spin on the L'atelier experience.  The food/service synergy  is outstanding. Where it ends up in your pantheon of foodie adventures will largely depend on your mind set as you walk through the door. Regardless it will be at or near the top. 

My first suggestion to enjoy L'atelier is to bring at least one bottle of your favorite wine. Robert Parker does when he dines here, you should too. Not that the wine list is bad, its not. But your special Burgundy or American pinot, with a low -food friendly- alcohol content of not more than 14%- will definitely add to your experience. 

Second, L'atelier has a small bar in the back corner. They make excellent cocktails that can act as a great aperitif. In fact one of their signature drinks is the Framboise Mojito which was a favorite of the rock group- The Killers- on their visits to L'atelier. 

Third, I love the Chartreuse soufflé. If you don't know the liquor Chartreuse, which goes back to the 1740's and a favorite of Russian Czars to the rock group Bon Jovi, a L'atelier server will gladly bring you out a small taste.  

Finally, there is a reason Joel Robuchon was named -Chef of the Century- (20th). Leave your baggage at the door and inhale the world of Robuchon. You won't regret it.",zvoDcHLURhJpHDIItLlJxQ,2,2,5,04dgg2rf1ORZ8oTgfuwaTw

I was supposed to take myself on a solo birthday dinner date back in August but they were completely booked.  When I remembered to make a reservation it was already weeks after my birthday and the soonest availability was end of September so I went ahead and got my spot...for my sister and I. Now, it all makes sense and I'm thankful the dining gods were with us tonight, we got to meet Joel Robuchon. I'm not a huge fan of celebrities or models and what not...I'm a fangirl of athletes and celebrity chefs! Meeting Joel Robuchon at L'Atelier was a 4/365 chance. Enough of my fangirl babbling.

We sat at the bar area to watch food being prepared - it was such a delight. Our server was Eddie and he has been working here since the day they opened. He took extremely good care of us. Best service I've had anywhere else. All requests granted. He made great recommendations and answered any questions we had about the menu. The manager chatted with us too. Extremely attentive. The sommelier let us try some wines before narrowing it down to what we really want. I got a Riesling and my sister got a Malbec...on top of the Veuve Clicquot we were already drinking.

Aside from the a la carte menu, they have 4 other menus: Menu A ($78: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 1 entree and 1 dessert), Menu B ($105: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert), Pre-Theatre served from 5-6:30pm ($45: amuse-bouche, 1 appetizer and roast of the day) and Seasonal Discovery (11-courses for under $200).

Amuse-Bouche:
Foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and parmesan emulsion. The port wine compliments the richness of the creamy foie gras and the parmesan emulsion adds lightness and saltiness. The Californians sitting next to us were jealous that we can eat foie gras in Nevada and that we have Joel Robuchon in Vegas - they should be. 5/5

Le Saumon:
Salmon carpaccio with fennel-mango salad and lemon essence. The mango they use are not the ripe ones so it's crisp and a bit tart (I love unripe/green mangoes). The salmon is fresh and works well with fennel. 5/5

Le Crabe Royal:
King crab with turnips and sweet and sour sauce. Thinly sliced turnip under and on top of the crab meat. Excellent flavors. 5/5

Les Calamars:
Sauteed calamari and vegetable medley in crustaceous vinaigrette. Lightly cooked calamari. There's olive oil with olive puree on the side of the plate. I'm allergic to olives and seafood/squid but I cleaned my plate - if I died because of this dish, it was worth it! 5/5

La Bisque de Homard:
Lobster bisque with morels and edamame. Lobster, mushrooms and edamame? Excellent! Great consistency and flavor. 5/5

Le Beuf:
Beef cheek with natural jus and vegetables. Super tender beef you can eat with just a fork. 5/5

Le Canard:
Duck with sweet and sour daikon and young leeks. I trust French chefs/restaurants to make a great duck dish...I've never been disappointed. Tender thinly sliced and well-seasoned duck that's perfectly cooked. You get 4 slices of daikon that tastes a bit smokey than sweet/sour. 5/5

Mashed Potatoes:
Very creamy potatoes...no lumps, imperfections whatsoever. Let's ignore the butter and fat content for one night...it's delicious! 5/5

Les Tartes:
Different kinds of tarts: raspberry tart, chocolate, caramel and peanut tart, orange tart, cinnamon tart and pistachio tart. Great sampling of different tarts. My faces were chocolate, caramel and peanut tart, and pistachio tart. 5/5

La Fraise:
Strawberry daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks. I'm a 80's baby so I grew up eating pop rocks and I enjoy re-living my childhood. They're mixed in with the fresh strawberries and the sorbet...you can hear the fizz. The yogurt sorbet is so yummy...and at the bottom is a strawberry daiquiri jelly. 5/5

Le Chocolat:
Chocolate ice cream, cremeux, Araguani dark chocolate and Oreo cookie crumbs. Incredible dessert. Fine-quality chocolate with a good chocolate ice cream and crunch from Oreos. 5/5

I can try real hard to find a flaw but it's just not happening. I'm just laughing at the thought of forgetting whose birthday we were celebrating: mine (August) or my sister's (October).

We chose the discovery menu with the wine pairing and it was phenomenal. The wines were also very good and perfectly suited to the food even if sometimes a little unexpected (but you should trust the restaurant at that level). The menu comes with ~10 courses or so. You get a small portion of each. The dishes were modern twists of french classic dishes and they were all perfect. The menu on the website is not the right one... as it changes and evolves.
The staff was great ! and what made the experience even more enjoyable was the fact that you are seating at a bar around the kitchen. The Chef came to check on us a few time and you can see all the cooks meticulously prepare your dishes. There are always waiters on the other side of the bar who explain to you each course... and it's easy to engage conversation. I thought the simplicity/friendliness/casual of the place paired with the awesome food was a great experience. The sommelier walks around just to talk about the wines. He was very interesting and eager to share his knowledge.
The check for 2 persons was $650 with tips... totally worth it in my opinion. Probably one of the best restaurant I have been to both for the food and the atmosphere. Excellent French restaurant without the bad sides.",M8y4zqjPbE7NdHjSQ5dOmQ,1,0,5,KruA0ZZ0ZYtENVA10-zS1A

L'Atelier is definitely a favorite among chefs and foodies in Las Vegas. To start they brought out bread and butter which wasn't warm but that's ok because the Amuse-Bouche of Foie Gras with port wine and Parmesan Foam from the chef was a outstanding. Next I had the Le Kampachi Et Le Saumon [Salmon Carpaccio with Lemon Vinaigrette and Espelette] which was very good. Next was the LeJambon [Ibérico de Bellota ham with toasted tomato bread] definitely a favorite. Next was the LaCébette [Crispy tart of white onion with quail egg, bacon, asparagus and Parmesan cheese] absolutely delicious.
For the main course I ordered the Le Saumon [Yuzu caramelized salmon, sriracha aioli and nameko mushrooms] well all I can say is I expected more. It wasn't as good as I know it could be. They can do better. The second entrée that I ordered was the LaCaille [Caramelized Quail filled with Foie Gras served with potato purée] very very good. The side dish was the mashed potatoes and I think they were possibly in the top two that I've ever had, they were absolutely delicious. Lastly for dessert I ordered the Le Chocolat [Chocolate sensation, crémeux Araguani,Oreo Cookie Crumbs] it was to say the least delectable.

From the moment I arrived I was made to feel important and comfortable by the staff.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, elegant and modern.  I wanted to eat at the counter so I could watch the action in the open kitchen, but sadly it is not wheelchair accessible.  I am pointing this out for the benefit of my fellow yelpers, but I am not factoring it into my Star allotment.  Now onto the food.

Amuse-Foie Gras Parfait Port and Parmesan Foam
Wonderful combination of richness,sweetness and saltiness.

1st Course-Langoustine Carpaccio with roasted Poppy Seed Dressing and Espelete Pepper.
Light and Clean with nice acidity from the lemon in the dressing and a nice note of heat from the pepper.

2nd Course-Poached Baby Kussi Oysters with Echire Butter.
I am not an Oyster fan and thought about asking for A substitution.  I am really glad I didn't.  The Oysters were mildly sweet and the combination of their briny juices , butter and chives was so good I drank it right from their shells when I finished the Oysters themselves.

3rd Course-Scallop with Seaweed Butter and Curried Cauliflower.
Perfectly cooked Scallop with nicely caramelized crust and sweet, tender flesh.  The Cauliflower was interestingly different.  It  was served chilled and almost mashed, but still maintained its crisp texture.The curry did not overpower things at all and added a nice heat factor to the dish.

4th Course-Pumpkin Soup with Chestnuts.
Very Rich and Creamy with a wonderful Pumpkin flavor.  The Chestnuts added a nice textural component to the Soup. I loved the fact that this soup was more savory than other pumpkin soups I've had, which are usually way to sweet for me.

5th Course-Steamed Seabass with Spicy confit peppers.
My most straight forward dish of the evening, but beautiful in its simplicity!
The fish melted in my mouth and the confit added just the right amount of seasoning. Before this course I had mentioned to one of the myriad of staff who attended to my every need during my meal, that I was hoping that one of my dishes would have Potatoes Robuchon with it.  Lo and behold, a small crock of the ""Holy Grail"" of mashed potatoes appeared as a side with the Bass.

6th Course-Foie Gras Stuffed Quail with Truffle Mashed Potatoes.
Crispy skin, tender meat and the rich Foie worked wonders together!  Served with more of those unforgettable potatoes.  This time decadently studded with black truffles.  WOW!

7th Course-Lychee Panna Cotta with Mango, Macadamia Nuts and Coconut Sorbet.
This was amazing. like a trip to Hawaii on a plate

8th Course-Green Apple Sorbet with Calvados Sabayon and Citrus Custard.
Tasted like eating a fresh apple right off the tree!  The Citrus Custard added a nice acidic note to the dish.

9th Course-Tart Tasting

Five small bites that were all good, but my favorite was the Chocolate Cinnamon.

Before my meal I mentioned to the Sommelier that I didn't think I could handle a wine with every course, since I had several other drinks earlier that day (It is Vegas after all!). He was very helpful, and selected three wonderful glasses that he spaced out through my meal.

5397833,2012-03-31,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon
2/7/2012

It's taken me a while to review this restaurant, because I was undecided about how to rate it. It has been said that this format was Chef Robuchon's vision of a diner, where guests could sit at the counter and watch their dishes being composed.

Yup. That was a $550 diner meal for two.

While it wasn't as expensive as our previous trip's visit to the flagship Joël Robuchon, this was still a pricey dinner. But we were treated to immense flavor and creativity packed into small presentations.

There was something else that I really enjoyed, but I'll get to that later.

Ok. Here's how it went down.

The GF had the $95 ""Menu Club"" menu with a side of ""Les Anchois"" - Fresh marinated anchovies with eggplant confit. She goes bonkers over anchovies, and we still have the pictures of her eating them.

She said she enjoyed her meal immensely, and I have no choice but to believe her.

I had the $155 ""Menu Decouverte de Saison"" prix fixe menu that offered a great deal of food, but here's where my subjective opinion comes in. And it's probably unfair to the hard workers of L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon for a silly reason.

The problem is that the large looming shadow of the flagship Joël Robuchon restaurant was still fresh in my mind. I was blown away last September with our nearly $1000 dinner, and I couldn't help but compare the dishes at L'Atelier to its Big Brother.

Muhammad Ali's younger brother probably understands.

To be fair, the dishes were tasty and imaginative. The GF and I had a great time, and our hosts were wonderful and informative. We had a great time with no complaints at all.

Try the ""La Cebette"" dish, which was a white onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg on top and green asparagus. You *MUST* get the shaved black truffle, but you will pay for it since it's optional.

The Veal dish accompanied with Robuchon's mashed potatoes were fantastic.

But here's the great thing about this place, and I highly suggest you consider this. Sit yourself at the counter and watch them work. If you are any type of fan of Top Chef, you will appreciate the view of the kitchen and all of the work involved in prepping, composing and plating of your dishes.

Put simply, you get to see the magic and intensity.

You also get to see a little more too. We got to see the Sous Chef lose his temper several times and rescue a few plates with contempt. He also got to send back a couple of dishes, and all of the chefs scrambled to refire their courses. We could see them sweating, yet there was no yelling or scolding. Quiet intensity... and we loved it.

When the Sous Chef gave the ""clean up"" order at the end of the night, all of the chefs breathed a sigh of relief.

I got a few videos on my iPhone and I still enjoy watching them hustle almost two months later.

The GF and I are contemplating whether to return in a few months, since we'll be visiting the MGM Grand for VH in concert. I'm leaning towards revisiting them, while the GF is neutral to the idea - understandable when you think of all of the alternate restaurants in Vegas.

This would be a five-star rating based on the experience we had but unfairly, I have to give it a four and a half star rating instead. This was not anything due to anything that the staff did, but it was a purely subjective opinion based on the fact that I didn't experience the same dinner as I did at the flagship restaurant.

If you want to have a great experience at a fantastic French restaurant, go to L'Atelier  de Joël Robuchon because you will enjoy the meal. It is also half the price of the flagship Joël Robuchon, with a different approach that works.

Flagship, Flagship, Flagship.

There were, however, little missteps in our service like me going without silverware for the first course and having to ask for it a couple of times. Also, and this bugs me, in a place like this, I shouldn't have to ask for my glass of water to be refilled; that's inexcusable for the price point.

BUT, the food IS great.  We each did the Discovery menu and every little dish and bite was sublime, from light poached shrimp atop the polenta to the surprising chicken and foie gras, we loved everything. Beautifully presented, it's like each dish was part of the story. And that hot chocolate dessert in the end was absolutely perfect!

I've been to the fancier and more expensive next door neighbor, Joel Robuchon and wasn't quite sure what to expect at L'Atelier but it was almost as nice of an experience - especially service wise. 

One thing that struck a chord w me was that even though they made a slight mistake with one of my dishes (left an item on that I am allergic to), they immediately corrected it and also took it off the check - which wasn't at all necessary since they replaced it right away.  I also appreciated that the waiter didn't blame the kitchen or anyone else.

As for the food itself, everything was extremely flavorful and cooked to perfection. My 3 dinner partners all agreed and said it was a fabulous meal. I liked that they offered a prix-fixe and an a la carte option AND most importantly that the whole table didn't have to order the same option. This can be an issue at many restaurants and I appreciated the flexibility.

5431074,2014-01-05,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"From the small plates concept to the sexy black and red decor, L'atelier is a fabulous spot to indulge in a little (or a lot) of luxurious decadence. I had the foie gras stuffed quail with a side of roasted vegetables and the framboise dessert. The quail dish consisted of a juicy roasted breast stuffed with a rich squirt of foie gras, a petite bone-in leg, and a dollop of butter parading under the guise of mashed potatoes. The dish was perfectly suited to the small plate format because of its over the top richness - a portion size any larger would have been overkill. The roasted vegetables were drenched in an unnecessary amount of herb oil and were practically inedible as a result. But the star of the table was certainly the framboise dessert, which was hands down the best dessert I've ever had. The dish featured so many different elements from the rich, creamy white chocolate, refreshingly smooth citrusy yuzu ice cream, hot tart raspberry sauce, and crispy puffs of rice, but it all came together in one hell of an elaborate plate. Even better than its over the top combination of flavors and textures was its incredibly dramatic presentation - it truly did justice to the ""explosion"" of flavors, textures, and temperatures packed into the dish. An absolute must order - it's something you truly have to experience yourself! 

The service and ambience were great as well. Despite a not so discreet location overlooking the MGM casino floor, the restaurant somehow had a nice breeze running throughout that gave it a refreshing al fresco vibe. :)

Overall, I'd highly recommend L'atelier, even beyond just as a lower price alternative to the real deal Joel Robuchon - from sharing a sampling of small plates to a full blown 9-course chef's tasting menu, L'atelier offers the perfect amount of luxury to whet any appetite.",9uIclQgMKYSt9qOZIEgBWg,1,1,4,mosJZZRMsj6KNANOTl1J8w

The kitchen is centrally located, the lighting is moody and the smell of the wonderful food inundates the senses.  The staff is very attentive, they focus on the details.

Seating is...interesting. My dc (dining companion) and I were seated at what is basically the bar. I was a little concerned at first, I was thinking they sat us here for a drink then we would get our table. Certainly not the case.

The placement was great with the kitchen being open, we saw the amazing meals being prepared. Also, it was fun to watch the interaction; seeing people work with, through and around each other. Quite the orderly chaos.

The menu itself can be somewhat shocking, price wise I mean. This place will give your card an intense workout. The prix fixe options weren't to our liking, so we went with individual items.

A few highlights:

The Spaghetti: My initial thought was ""How can a high end place like this offer spaghetti?? Well that was dashed when I tried the first bite. Served with chopped pork bellies, this was an absolute treat.

Le Foie Gras: Foie gras ravioli in a warm chicken broth with herbs. I'm not sure I put into words how amazingly succulent this dish was. I don't have much experience with foie gras and this dish had me clamoring for more.

Also, they have Chimay Blonde, on tap, for $7. That's cheaper than a CB in Atlanta. And they give you a healthy pour, which is nice. Probably the cheapest item on the menu.

This was my first dining experience at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon and I ordered the Seasonal Discovery Tasting Menu.  Of all the things that I ate, only one plate was just a-ok, the Alaskan King crab with gelee.  The gelee is just something I'm not that fond of.  Everything else however, was beyond scrumptious.   I would love to go back again to savor their La Cebette, the onion tart with smoked bacon.  The foie gras -which had to be enjoyed slowly because I knew I wasn't going to find something this good and truly mouthwatering.  Pretty much made my eyes roll in the back of my head good.  I thought for a tasting menu that their portions were quite generous.  I remember being done in one bite at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.  Here, I even managed to share a couple of bites of some plates with my husband.  

The baguettes vividly reminded us of Paris and the boulangeries we can no longer visit.  And I can not believe the process that goes into making the silky smooth - mashed potatoes.  They're not mashed, thats for sure.

My personal favorite was the lobster pasta on the small plates menu- it was creamy and delicious, the lobster was cooked just right- everything you could ask for.

While the food was again, great, we were disappointed in the service- more specifically the fact that the menu was not adequately explained to us. Maybe it's our faults for not being up to snuff when it comes to high class dining (though we didn't have any issues understanding our meal at Alinea in Chicago), or perhaps it's our lack of French speaking skills, but when we told the server it was our first time dining at the place, I would have expected him to explain to me how the menu works, especially when it comes to portions and price. By the end of the meal, we each had been served WAY too much food than what one person could possibly consume- and this is coming from people who can eat! We were so full, no one touched their dessert, which we still paid for. Another let down- when we got the bill and find out that most of what we ordered was an up-charge, though we did not feel that was explained to us when ordering one of their ""prix-fix"" menus.

From the mouthwatering meats being grilled with precision to prepping more detailed, intricate plates on the fly like their sumptuous ""Le Joue"" (beef cheek salad) offered quality entertainment between courses.

Japanese influence was prevalent in cooking methods (grilled meats on a teppenyaki surface), room design (certain counter areas looked like they were made for sushi chefs) and cuisine.  The most pronounced courses being ""Le Homard"" (uniquely breaded lobster tempura), the awesome ""L'ouef de Poule"": a semi soft boiled egg on a carbonara of pearl pasta with smoked bacon and green asparagus which easily could have been on a Japanese/Italian fusion restaurant menu, and ""La Ricotta"": herb imprinted ricotta tortellini in a dashi broth.  The sprinkles of togarashi spice, silkiness of the pasta skin, garnished with mushrooms and green was a pleasant intermezzo between the starch course and the two upcoming meaty affairs aka ""les holy sheeet"".

Le Bar (sea bass, ""en croute"" with brussel sprouts, peanuts and porcini mushrooms) was a marriage of flavors that consummated in my mouth.  The richness of the sauce was simply divine and went perfectly with each bite of fish and awesomely super thin pastry crust on top.  As expected from the ""Chef of the Century"", the presentation was second to none.  

La Caille (carmelized quail stuffed with foie gras served with potato puree) was greatness stuffed into greatness with a side of greatness.  The ultimate in succulent, this combination of fatty duck liver and juicy quail was amazing.  Throw in the Robuchon potatoes (95% butter, 5% potato) on the side, just to show off because they could, made for a wonderful ten minutes of dining bliss.

Ending the meal with not one, but two great dessert courses (one strawberry and one chocolate) made for a most excellent way to end this fantastically harmonious course dinner.  This was a totally different experience than ""Joel Robuchon"" in a wearing Versace sweats ensemble kinda way if that makes any sense.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,120,104,5,6gYeutPUZP_LhG9RhkdrPw

We decided to do the prefix menu. Extremely disappointed with amuse and our appetizers. Got better with the soup and my husbands entree of flank steak. Amazing perfect mashed potatoes. The desserts were quite good. House wine good. They found out it was my birthday and all came to sing to me with candle. Very enjoyable. Our server (who I didn't catch name, but great guy from irvine, ca) was a highlight. On top of our needs and very professional and knowledgeable.

First the service and ambience is IMPECCABLE.  Literally, I've never had a more professional, courteous, helpful, knowledgeable waiter in my entire life, and I work as a waitress.  I was nervous that the service would be snooty because my boyfriend and I are young (22 & 23), but our waiter was not snooty at all.  

Secondly, the food is amazing.  There's no point in using words to describe the food.  Just go try it!!

They are also very accommodating about special requests - the couple next to me had a surprise birthday tart come out, and the chef substituted a huge scallop for me instead of the egg/mushroom course in the tasting menu.

p.s. they are very cool about taking pictures, our waiter said we could take as many pictures as we liked and even offered to take our picture for us.  i'm too impatient to take pictures of food before eating it, but i know a lot of people like to =)",wqZiFiqD0IwZvVHq9Rg7eg,2,1,5,rYTJGERUNhfkCXUrX78BOg

had the tomato gazpacho...pretty good, not amazing. i got the sweetbread ravioli which was REALLY good, but everyone else at the table got the halibut. while the foam with the halibut was really good...the actual fish was soo chewy...i had to drink massive amounts of water to swallow it when i ate a piece of someone's fish. i was expecting the portions to be small but i was surprisingly full at the end. the dessert was good but again, not amazing. for 40 dollars, i could have gotten an amazing meal at bouchon...but what the hell...i figured i should try l'atelier. i would come back maybe to try the 75 dollar tasting menu or 150 dollar one...but if the server was as shitty and the food as underwhelming, i would never go back again...

So, my little sister turned 21 last Friday.  And she says to me, ""So, i'm going to Vegas for a conference Sunday!""   The most fitting thing to do seems to be to go visit and take her to a really nice dinner.  So I did.

A reservation booked for 8:45 yielded prompt seating.  I ordered the 5 course prix fixe and my sister had the 4 course prix fixe.  We both ordered different things to share and try.  

Winners: 

Baguette - It's sort of a prerequisite thing to have right.  Le pain et beurre 

Foie gras parfait with parmasean foam and port wine? reduction.  This guy had very good flavor, savory from the foam, sweetness from the reduction, and richness from the parfait.  

Lobster Bisque w/ Edamame:  I have not tried many lobster bisques in my life.  But this one was superb.  Imagine squeezing out a lobster into a bowl.  That's sort of how it tasted.  In a really good way.  Also now picture yourself on a wharf and smelling a bit of that salty breeze.  Take just a drop of that and add it to the bisque as well.  You know, so you can tell it's delicious, but it's fresh!  That's what you end up with, accompanied with a few small pieces of lobster tail and edamame  

Chilean Sea Bass:
Yummmmmmm  served over a delicious leek soup.  Hard to go wrong with Chilean Sea Bass. it's almost like cheating.  Pretty drops of oils to decorate the plate as well!

Steak Tartar:  Excellently crispy fries, rich flavorful tartar.  I would order this again.  I don't have too much experience with tartar but it was definitely enjoyable.

Le Boeuf:  oh yum... rich caramelized shallots topping a ribeye cap.  With a reduction & some mustard.  This was pretty heavenly.  Great flavor in every bite.  

Les Tartes:  The cinnamon tart, and the strawberry pistachio tart were my top favorites.  The apple cinmamon one was a good third.  The lemon tart was more citrusy than I prefer, and the chocolate/peanut tart was good, but did not shine as well as the other aforementioned.  

And super cool, besides the open kitchen to watch some prep, my sister got a birthday dessert and they sang Joyeux Anniversaire to her  :)",4oCPGJDC-3XXfDdcp7myKg,5,5,5,zRPNRme4buaTcRNlvDjQYQ
5603862,2015-01-26,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"If you don't know about L'Atelier, it is important to do a little research about the place and about Chef Joel Robuchon.  Please don't be that couple that stumbles in drunk and has no idea what the space embodies.  Please don't expect a large selection of beer.  This place is owned by a French Master.  They drink wine not beer.  It is mind blowing how customers put so much blame on the fact that they don't have beer.  L'Atelier deserves the respect.  My husband is passionate about food, so we have watched several documentaries about or referring to Joel Robuchon.  This man is in his own class and is godly in the food realm.  I didn't realize this myself until I noticed the customer sitting next to my husband hailing Mary and gazing at his bowl of pasta with fresh shaved black truffles as if it were his last supper.  

The best seats are at the counter which is in the face of the kitchen.  The kitchen is beautifully decorated and impressively clean.  The black uniforms the chef wear give off a sleek and modern appeal, but also hides any stains. It was fascinating to watch each chef perform their specialty with passion and precision.  They used tweezers to delicately arrange the ingredients.  The kitchen is a harmonious performance.  Service was fantastic.  Everyone embodied confidence and were welcoming and attentive.  I definitely got the feeling that my food was just as or more important to the chefs as it was to me.   Most of the staff seemed to speak French.  Listening to them made me reminisce Paris. 

We ordered the Seasonal Discovery Menu which included 9 dishes.  The dishes that were prominent for me were the sea scallop, the foie gras tortellini, the quail, and the desserts.  The scallop was the best prepared scallop I've had.  It was my favorite dish because everything was perfect.  The scallop was not over cooked and the sauces did not take away from the scallop.  Everything about the dish was balanced and prepared well.  The foie gras tortellini was visually beautiful and full of flavor.  I enjoyed that the broth was very light to compliment the richness of the delicate tortellini.  The tortellini had a light buttery, but rich foie gras flavor.  The quail was also cooked perfectly.  It was stuffed with foie gras, but was not too rich and heavy.  Both of the desserts were very good.  After so many dishes I was full and didn't think I could finish the desserts, but they were too good to be left alone.  

The dish that I thought fell short was the shrimp carpaccio and the salad with the wasabi dressig and black truffles.  The shrimp carpaccio had too much salt.  I tasted the sweetness of the shrimp, but was distracted by the salt.  Some bites tasted of just salt.  I am not sure if this is how the dish was supposed to be eaten, and if it was merely a matter of preference.  The salad taste fine, but didn't have strong distinctive flavors that left an impression compared to the other.  I am thinking that due to the given price bracket the quality of the truffles used was not of high grade.  They were fresh truffles, but just didn't have a lot of flavor.  It makes sense to include a dish with truffles because truffles are ""in style"" and impressive in the food scene. 

To top this experience off, Joel Robuchon appeared in the kitchen.  He was visiting L'Atelier for 2 weeks.  This really made my husband's day.  Thank you for having the passion you do about food.   It is honorable to dine at your restaurant.  Next time if I have the courage to gamble away some money and possible win big, I will wonder next door to your other restaurant.

The whole dining experience was very impressive.  We overlooked the entire kitchen and enjoyed watching all the actions while tasting every bites of their creation.  It was a very calm and relaxing kitchen, you could tell that every dish was artfully prepared with great attention to details.  

We tried out their 9 courses tasting menu, they were all creative and very very tasty. 

1. Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam -
Served in a little cup. A bit heavy for starter, but it did a great job satisfying my palate right at the beginning.  The port wine, cheese and foie gras all interplay really well together. 

2. Celery mousse with wasabi, beef stew gelee and slices of foie gras -
Another dish that served in a tiny cup.  Interesting combination of foie gras with wasabi, it was fantastic resulting in a spicy lingering finish to the dish. 

3. Oysters with chives in lemon butter -
Baby oysters poached in salted butter. Altogether 3 delicious small and plump fresh oysters swimming in butter, served hot. 

4. Lobster with curry ginger sauce and edamme -
Though I prefer a different type of sauce other than curry to go with lobster, the freshness and rich flavor of the lobster made this dish fantastic. 

5. Quail egg on white onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus
The slight bitterness of asparagus balanced well by the smoked flavor of the bacon, the crispy tart and the quail egg made a good textural variation to the dish.  

6. Monkfish cheek and baby leeks in buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger -
The fish was so tender and fresh and balanced well with the buttery and astringent taste of the sauce.

7. Veal with tomato confit and shallot. Salsify root gratin with sheepmilk cheese, sweetbread and black truffle.

8. Champagne gelee topped with frozen raspberry mousse and rose scented meringue.

9. Baked chocolate ganache with aerated devil's food cake with fresh mint ice cream.


And we also ordered several must try on the regular menu.  

1. Foie gras stuffed Quail with mashed potatoes -
I love foie gras, but I don't think it went well with quail, it overpowered the delicious taste of the quail. The potatoes were mashed together with truffles and was incredibly tasty - Robuchon's signature item. It was creamy, rich, savory and very fine. 

2. Lightly battered fried shrimp with basil in pesto sauce.

5634937,2014-10-03,3,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I am no longer fanatic about foie gras. Ever since my acquisition of the French house, I find foie gras consumption to be just not as nearly exotic as before, not even after California lost its license to serve such things. Maybe it's because familiarity breathes content, just like a marriage. 

L'Atellier de Joel Robuchon pays homage to Robuchon's homeland by inserting foie gras in just about everything. It started with an amuse bouche that is a palate cleanser but with foie gras on the the bottom. A bit heavy but okay, it's what's known for here. Foie Gras stuffed quail was what interested me, it was also unusual because quail is not something you get elsewhere much. On the prix fix menu, salmon was good and so was the pork belly.

It's a Michelin star restaurant. The price tag was jaw-droppingly expensive. Even then reservation was difficult to come by. We grabbed the last seating at 10:30 and the restaurant closed at 11.

Food aside, the server was interesting. He looked quite a lot like a grad student majored in biochemistry, and he had that indescribable accent that you often hear from Ibiza's nightclubs: you wonder if he's some German DJ trying to rid of his German accent to sound like an American, or an American DJ trying to speak with a continental English accent to try to blend in. He turned out to be from St. Louis Missouri.  

Like most of those fancy pants restaurants, you get your order taken on an iPad. Drinks are delicious but also extremely expensive, as in Saison and Per Se expensive. Be aware.

Price aside, the ambience was great. The thing about Robuchon is that he's famous. Extremely famous. I could not get into the only three Michelin star restaurant, by the same chef, of course. As a second cousin to its three starred Michelin restaurant, L'Atelier is more casual, and thus it felt a bit more intimate and less stuffy than its glammed up cousin next door.

Be prepared to people watch like I did. I love love watching people in these fancy pants restaurants dropping a couple of hundred dollars each. Quite an interesting social study, especially when the said restaurant is in Vegas.

Come sometime, bring your hottest, most deserving date. She/he will be suitably impressed. I had the oddest dream after eating here, I dreamed an old boyfriend brought me here, and he proposed.

   We came here before the RUSH concert show last week. Surprisingly on a Saturday night and the place wasn't even full. We got seated promptly. It's a beautiful and modern decor, right next to the 3 Michelin Star Joel Robuchon. It's been a while since I last visited here. L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon surely lived up to what I remember. 

   Steve Benjamin, executive chef of L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon did a great job this past few years here. In 2003, he was a part of the opening team of L'Atelier in Paris. When he started, he had 22 cooks and after one week decreased to 8 cooks. I got chat with chef a little bit. He told us the the first thing when he walks into his kitchen is look at the floor. He learned that from Chef Joel Robuchon. ""If the floor is spotless, it means that everyone is working correctly."" Chef Benjamin said.

   When his kitchen does prep in the morning, he samples everything from the mussels to the foie gras. ""I can be strict at times, but a great team needs a great leader. I learned that from Mr. Robuchon, too."" he said.

 We got to try just about everything on the menu this trip, with my clients, and 2 good friends Vegas local. Everything was perfect, including the wines, the Sommelier did a great job on helping us pairing the wines.

- Maine lobster salad with a sherry vinegar dressing

- ""Ibérico de Bellota"" ham with toasted tomato bread

- Soy glazed kampachi with an endive salad and light mustard dressing - delicious

- Sea bass with simmered baby vegetables, red curry and coconut milk sauce - so tasty

- Traditionally poached chilled duck foie gras - what not to love

- Cod, confit with poached eggplant in a dashi broth, wild mushrooms

- Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes - this dish was to die for

- Langoustine a la plancha with green curry and cilantro - i can eat this dish every day! 

- Veal sweetbread with fresh laurel and stuffed romaine lettuce - richness and full of flavor. 

- French style hanger steak with roasted shallot and shishito pepper

- Wagyu beef ribeye with grilled peppers 

- The infamous dish - Potato puree - it was buttery, smooth, and screamy on your tongue, simply delicious

DESSERTS:

- .Fresh raspberry surprise inside white chocolate sphere, yuzu ice cream

-  Panna cotta topped with corn ice cream, fresh citrus salad

- Chocolate sensation, ""crémeux"" Araguani, Oreo cookie crumbs

   Service was on point. We could barely moved after the dinner, slowly walked off to the MGM Garden Arena to RUSH concert. the rock & roll music was blasting, and I could barely kept my eyes open. Food coma for the richness and deliciousness of the dinner.

I saw at the bar which was fun to watch the detail the chefs put into each and every dish.  It was a hard debate over whether to order a la carte and try all the items that sounded amazingly scrumptious, or start with the 5 course pre-fixe.  I wasn't particularly hungry when I walked in, but one whiff of the dishes served next to me and I chose the 5 course pre-fixe and let the eating begin.

- The Foie gras parfait was delicious.  The parmesan foam complimented and didn't overpower the foie gras at all, and it was a sizable portion for a small amuse bouche.

- The snapper with lemon vinaigrette was a feast for the eyes as much as it was for the taste buds.  Loved the colorful sprouts and flora sprinkled on the snapper. Not uniquely different from other similar raw, thinly sliced, and marinated raw fish appetizers I've tried at other establishments, but definitely delicious.

- Pumpkin Gnocchi with chestnut and foie gras.  This has to be my favorite dish from dinner and what makes it so I must come back to L'Atelier, and come back soon before this seasonal dish is taken off the menu.  The soft gnocchi bursts with the flavorful sweetness of freshly roasted pumpkin, paired with the richness of foie gras and complimented by the nutty scent of chestnut.  This dish was so good, the guests next to me at the bar ordered one as well as soon as they saw mine arrive.  And it was so good, I think I could have eaten three dishes of this all at once and not be tired of it.  

- Suckling pig with mushroom.  I may have been overstuffed at this point given this was technically a late second dinner of the night, but besides the unique presentation of this dish, the crispy crust on the outside, and the sweet aroma of sucking pig served with wild mushrooms... Hmmm... I think the more I recall the dish the better I seem to remember it.

- Liquid cheesecake with pineapple.  I am 100% certain this dish is called something else, and definitely more eloquently described, but you probably won't get a more accurate description than my liquid cheesecake with pineapple.  Beautiful presentation, and very tasty till the last bite.  

Service was fantastic, the posh but casual atmosphere was just right for a post-work dinner, the location was convenient within MGM Grand, the price was more than reasonable, and oh, the bread is fresh, crisp, and moist.  There were so many more dishes I saw others order and wanted to try off of the a la carte menu.  The guests next to me and I exchanged notes on what we ate throughout our entire dinner, and I know there will definitely be a return visit hopefully very, very soon.",7GT19rrk5pA_5KIvbzTiag,7,3,5,gXFWa_2cuKws4losTqQnKg

The decor was striking with a modern and almost Asian twist to it. The tables are also spread out so that the meal with your dining partners feel intimate and quiet. The Dégustation (tasting) menu was incredible. Course after course came out , to my amazement, each one better than the one before it. Highlights were La Langoustine, Le Saint-Pierre and Le Porc Fermier. Le Burger was also amazing... the most delicious gourmet sliders that literally just melt in your mouth. The rest of the menu is tapas style so you can order several dishes and share them to create your own sort of tasting menu.

While the chief's tasting menu is deliciously in many ways, there were a few things lacking in my experience here.  For one, I was a little bummed that there was no option of adding wine pairing with the courses. I suppose 10 glasses of wine would be a bit much, but still..2 or 3 would have sufficed. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and one of the best part of the night was watching the sous chef chopping, cooking, slicing our courses while the chef would yell in French every now and then.  The kitchen was busy and the wait staff was attentive, but lacking in personality a little bit. We absolutely love it when waiters and waitresses joke around with us and have light conversations every time they check up, but this place was a bit bland.

Other than that I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this restaurant. It is topnotch and beautiful.  Both my boyfriend and I agreed that while the experience was worthwhile, we would rather go back to the neighboring Craftsteak that offers family style tasting menu, wine pairing and a jolly waiter.  Also, even though the food melted wonderfully in your mouth, after 2 or 3 bites, the taste of heaven is gone.

It is now time to upgrade it to that elusive 5th star.

As always, everything was beyond amazing!  We walked up around 9:30pm on a Saturday night, with no reservation and it was not a problem at all.  The hostess was very friendly and again we sat at the counter.

I really love watching the detail that everyone puts in to every plate.  Everything that comes out is truly a masterpiece!

Currently, they have a few tasting menus available.  Everyone in my party did Menu A, because, for $78 it seemed to be the best value.  You got 2 appetizers, 1 entree and 1 dessert.  There were quite a few items to choose from, which is always good.

They started us out with an amuse bouche of some sort of foie gras topped with parmesan foam.  UM HELLO! So good.  Then I had the heirloom tomato salad, which was beautiful, and of course delicious.  This was followed by tempura calamari with spicy guacamole, which was good, but not my favorite.  There was nothing spicy about the gucamole, but it was still tasty.  For my entree, I had skirt steak wrapped around hericot vert, which was served with the most amazing mashed potatoes I have possibly ever had.  Words can't describe that little pot of deliciousity!!  Holy crap.  For dessert I had ""Les Tartes,"" which was a selection of 5 or 6 mini tartes.  I am not a sweets eater, but oh dear lord were they good!

Considering this is the little, more casual sister to Joel Robuchon at the Mansion, you might go here thinking it is actually ""casual."" That is not the case.  There is really nothing casual about this place, other than the bar style seating....the food is top notch and the service is some of the best in Vegas.  Not a detail goes overlooked and the staff genuinely cares whether you have a great meal.

5677034,2016-01-14,5,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Second time back at this location! Since I came during the holiday season, they were not offering an a la carte menu. We ended up ordering set menu A as we weren't that hungry, and it was more than enough food for us. Menu A includes Amuse Bouche, two appetizers, one main course, and one dessert.

My friend and I decided to share our food to try a bigger variety of dishes. I love how Joel Robuchon always provides a great variety of bread. The amuse bouche came right after, and it consisted of a foie gras parfait that was actually super light and tasted yummy. 

For the cold appetizer, I got the kampachi tartare with spicy avocado guacamole. The fish was super fresh, and the dish overall was very soft, not that many textures involved. It was tasty, however I thought it was okay.

For the hot appetizer, I got the soft fried egg with smoked salmon and baby salad. This was another okay dish, as it just tasted like smoked salmon with a soft boiled egg and crispy textures. My friend got the escargot cooked in parsley butter, fried creamy polenta, and parmesan which was delicious- I wish I had gotten this instead as the flavors in this dish was more unique.

For my entrée, I ordered the spiced maine lobster over tagliatelle pasta ($10 supplement). Another solid dish, but frankly, I expected more. Good pasta and lobster but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The mashed potatoes really saved the day though, as these were amazing. Super creamy and flavorful. I ended up taking some home as it was just that good. My friend ordered the seared duck breast with spiced sweet and sour quince which was another good entrée. The duck was tender and I really liked the pairing of sweet and sour with the duck!

The dessert was actually the best part of the night for me. I got the traditional tarts which came with five different types of mini cakes- lemon, cinnamon, chocolate caramel, orange, and apple. I really enjoyed trying the different flavors of each one! My friend got the cinnamon carrot cake with coconut sorbet, and the presentation was beautiful. It came in an actual carrot form, and the outside was covered with chocolate that you cut open to eat the cake inside. This was my favorite dish of the night and I was impressed with the taste and presentation of the carrot cake!!

Overall, my experience this time around was a lot less impressive than my other times I've enjoyed L'Atelier. I was actually slightly disappointed at how normal everything tasted, and although I did see the cooks really plate everything beautifully, nothing was exceptional. The service/kitchen was a little inconsistent, as it took an extremely long time for our entree to come but our appetizers came out one right after the other.

Joel Robuchon's ""experimental"" L'Atelier at the MGM Grand is a sensual delight.  The decor is modern and sleek, with more than a touch of Asian flavor: blacks and deep reds, as well as a restaurant wide ""bar"" that faces the kitchen, reminiscent of your local sushi joint.

They offer two separate tasting menus, both with optional wine pairing, as well as dozens of tempting plates on an a la carte menu.  A friend of mine had a few a la carte dishes, which were magnificent, but do yourself a favor, suck it up and order the tasting menu.  

The service is impeccable.  Every dish is explained thoroughly as it is served and the Sommelier, Dan, is top notch.

I won't bore you with detailed descriptions of every dish, but I assure you, each bite will leave you aching as if you didn't believe in such decadence.  You feel like a child tasting chocolate for the first time, or a blind man suddenly given the gift of sight.  It's almost as if you were living in ignorant bliss before you sat down at L'Atelier.

1.If you think this is a high end upscale restaurant - don't come here. The atmosphere is of a mediocre sushi bar, even the bathrooms are not very clean. The staff is ok, but for what you are paying (i'll get to it) you deserve a lot more. It is noisy, small (and not in the good way) and basically every shmuck who walks in the MGM grand (should have been the first warning sign to me) can see you eat.

2.If you know and value your food - don't come here. I value good food whether it is in a hole in a wall or a 3 star michelin restaurant.The food here is major meh. Sure the langoustines here are from the atlantic and they are not bad, but 60$ for 3 of them? give me a break. I had to return their ""signature"" dish - the quail stuffed with foie gras. It was bland and very meh. Meh is how I would describe this place.
Now usually it's hard to get it wrong with the desserts. I understand why people would wow over the framboise that melts into itself, but we had 3 desserts and there is a chance the Cinnabon across the hall is a better use for your money

3. If you value your money - don't come here.
The prices are ridiculous -60 and 70$ for main dishes and 50-60 for starters , 15$ for a dessert. And what do you get ? Sure seeing the staff at work is nice but.. the atmosphere is like a noisy street sushi bar. For 130$ per person before drinks and all, i can go to daniel in nyc (3 stars, not one), sit like a king and have the entire french experience.
The food? not amazing, especially not worth the ridiculous prices you pay for it.

The service? nice, but not worth-the-price nice.

If you value food, money or atmosphere - don't come here - all the rednecks around you that take the tasting menu + wine pairing (that is 260 a pop) will just make you go WTF.",afFox8QyEIe0MqAiZZYM6g,2,1,2,ewsu6sT_DP1rmLu9gMPqsw

Starting with the steamed-foie gras-and-port amuse bouche, my tastebuds were in writhing delight.

The service is top notch. Excellent sommelier who recommended to me other places in Vegas a well. The servers were very attentive...Making sure that the pacing of my meal was just right.

Now, granted, I have quite a penchant for nice ambiance, and in my perfect world the aesthetic of this restaurant would include more natural light.  (It is completely dark.....underground next to the casino of MGM grand.)

5718727,2010-08-13,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"A much overdue review. Visited last year. I don't remember all the details of the dishes so I won't have my usual descriptions. But I must say that this is the best restaurant so far for me. Kinda funny but I had no clue who Joel Robuchon is before our visit. We just made a reservation because we had a discount deal while we stayed at the MGM. Oh boy, am I glad we did or what!

Location/Atmosphere: 
Located at the MGM, this is different from the Joel Rubuchon restaurant right next door; L'Atelier is the ""casual"" version of his restaurant; you see, we knew nothing about this so we said ""why are there two places by the same guy at the same hotel?"" Naïve/ignorant back then. Now we're enlightened. Most of the seating is at the bar where you can witness all the cooking action in the open kitchen. I loved the casual, fun but sophisticated atmosphere; you can dress as nicely as you want or as casual as with a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt; just be sensible and don't be tacky.

Food: 
Absolutely exquisite! I enjoyed every single dish we were served. Most impressionable to me were the baked oysters, stacked zucchini and eggplant slices, and foie gras ravioli. There were many more goodness but sorry I just don't remember the details. Each dish looked like an art piece and even better they tasted wonderful. The sommelier helped us pair wine with the courses. We finished with an array of sweet desserts and a variety of cheeses. We were completely stuffed!

Service:
Friendly; if you want to engage with the servers or the sommelier...you can and they're friendly; but they will leave you alone if you don't want to be bothered.

This is definitely not inexpensive for casual (not-so-formal) dining but I definitely would recommend if you want to splurge a little while you're in the sin city and don't want to go to some stuffy snooty place. I would love to go back and try other dishes and repeat some of them but until then I'll have to only savor the experience in my memory.",V6_ngZmpk4Lj_xjEeH5L4w,0,0,5,XNmm01FVFZb9a0ISylncwA

5732002,2009-07-13,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This Review reflects the $75.00 tasting Menu 

As a novice when it comes to French, I was feeling a mix of intimidation and eagerness as I approached L'Atelier for my 5:00 reservation. All patrons present  dressed pretty casual, no shorts of course, but no one in a sport coat or fancy cocktail dress. That relieved me as I'm certainly not big on dressing up, especially in Vegas. I had heard about the opportunity to try a Robuchon establishment at a bargain price and had to jump. So the adventure began. 

Seating is counter-style. You face an open immaculate kitchen, where just two feet away your meals are prepared . The care, attention to detail, and skill are on full display here. It was awesome to watch! 

As soon as we were seated we were presented with, as others have yelped ""the most amazing french baguettes ever"". They were delicious! I wanted to steal a few as every time we finished these mini treats off they were replenished. I ordered a drink and read the menu. It was a no-brainer as I opted for the $75.00 tasting menu and went with the Pork Belly, although I was tempted by the other two choices: Salmon and Rotisserie Chicken (which was being roasted and basted before my eyes).  

Now it was time to chose a wine, which was a bit of a bummer... The selection is fantastic, but the prices were HIGH. A decent half bottle of wine was north of $100.00. But, really, if you're going to come to L'Atelier it would be a shame to go cheap on the vino. I went with what my waiter recommended: a 2005 Merlot which was about $125 for a half bottle. 

The Amuse Bouche was a shot glass of foamed port wine, with foie gras topped with a delicate Parmesan foam, it was delicious and stimulating. 

Next up was a selection of grilled vegetables served chilled with a room temperature buffalo mozzarella, it was delicious. The vegetables were perfectly seasoned and when served chilled the smokiness of the grilling contrasted with the sweet refreshment of the produce. The mozzarella was pure balance, a little salty but creamy and mild in the mouth. 

Now was one of the superstars-- Buchon's famed langostine lobster, dressed in fashion-model thin pastry. It was a specimen of a langostine-- about four inches long and shaped like a small football, The shellfish inside was seasoned with a touch of herbs and lemon olive oil, melted butter, white pepper and a dash of something I'm guessing was white wine or champagne vinegar. Heaven on every small bite. The delicately sauced superstar glides smoothly around the mouth. Fork dropping for our party, with many ""oohs"" and ""wow's"" to spare.  At this point I'm starting to believe the Robuchon hype. I'm having a moment here. This is one of the most delicious plates I have ever experienced. I don't want it to end, so I take my time and when it's gone I cringe. I want more.

With such a moment before, I'm worried that the entree might not live up to the spectacular moment I had with the the lobster. My pork belly arrives, a petite piece, in a small sauce covered with a compote, it's it's a whiff of intensely sweet and smokey onion to my nose.  I was a little disappointed with the size of the entree, it looked like I could swallow it in three bites. The mashed potato side was about two tablespoons. At Robuchon the nose and eyes might tell a story,  but the tongue is a documentary. Each small bite of the pork was sensational. Like a Jimmi Hendrix solo, the flavor explodes in beautiful, yet overwhelming directions. My senses were rocked! The potato, mashed scientifically through a mill, was simple and delicate, with a touch of cream and carefully incorporated mass amounts of butter. BUT BACK TO THE PORK BELLY---  It was so rich that after finishing I reflected on how GENEROUS it truly was. It was outrageously good. Amazing, delicious and simple. I was in heaven. Out of this world!

The cheese course was mild, and a great respite from the rich entree. I have a feeling the cheese were paired with our wine selection, a perfect way to finish the bottle!

With dessert you are asked if you would like the ice cream or the tart, if you're a party of two or more mix it up the selection. I'm not going to throw down any spoilers here, but dessert is just as special as the other courses. 

Invincible! 
Highly Recommended.

Parking/Tram: Very accessible, short walk from either. 

Price: for the $75.00 menu, our party of four ended up with a $400 check, after wine, water, and coffee plus tip so HEADS up! We're not drinkers, but if you order a few cocktail and premium wines, the check will expand. 

Service: Impeccable. Friendly and professional, highly personable and friendly, and spot on with timing. Standard setting.

The tasting menu lasted about 75 minutes. I will remember it forever!",IKdub0kHXhCS_5EG84ivuw,4,0,5,sZnYs24_9ZJJsfdE_wczDA
5734586,2011-03-24,1,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"I was hoping I could get a 5 star review out of one of the restaurants on my list in Vegas, and I am delightfully able to grant that esteemed privilege to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. I'm sure he'll hang this printout next to his Michelin star(s). Seriously though, this is how I wish all tasting menus were composed. It was incredibly thoughtful and well composed, but without being stupid. Fancy, yes, absurd no. There were no lavender pillows or dry ice involved...but it wasn't needed. Superior to both Alinea and Trotters on the visits I've made, and rated ""below"" them both from a Michelin perspective.

The tasting menu, as I said, was outstanding. Some real standouts included the amuse bouche - a really nice tomato gazpacho with avocado cream and cucumber. Crisp, cold, and refreshing, like a super high end V8, honestly. A very good start to the meal. A scallop seared in ginger lemon grass oil and topped with scallions was perfectly cooked and succulent. The asparagus, slid inside large macaroni, topped with broiled cheese, and served with sweet, softened tiny onion strips and ham was outstanding - I would never equate macaroni with asparagus, but it works.

However, my favorites were the sole, and king crab, and the quail. The sole was mild, light, moist and flaky, again in a light oil, but with thin slices of fresh ginger and baby leeks, plus tiny crispy onion rings. The combination of the sharp ginger and the savory onion with that light sole was outstanding. The ginger didn't overpower, but added a little bit of a light spicy citrus flavor to the mild fish. King crab was good, though not standout, but in a tangy dressing, with curry powder and incredibly crisp bell pepper - seemingly shaved from very near and including the skin, so that it crackled when chewed, and that served as a good texture counterpoint to the crab, and provded an excellent green taste compliment to the crabmeat and dressing. 

And the quail. Oh, the quail. Probably one of the most thoughtful dishes I've ever eaten. Quail pan seared and glazed with a soy honey sauce, stuffed with rich foie gras, with truffled mashed potatoes on the side, and a terrific salad of dill, chervil, taragon, and frisee on the side, topped with truffle vinaigrette. This was my requisite, 5 star, ""oh my god"" moment. The lightly gamey quail was divine combined with almost melted, creamy foie gras, and the salty sweet glaze over all of it. That unique herb salad was the perfect counterpart to a heavily salty/savory meat and potato combo - really creative and appropriate touch. I'll take a few more of these please...

Dessert was no slouch either - delicious vanilla short bread with frozen pineapple mouse, light lime cream, superb, crisp, refreshing lemongrass sorbet, and pop rocks on top for a little sparkle. Nothing wrong with having a little fun - I would have honestly guessed crushed pineapple life savers until I let one hit my tongue - easy to correct my guess from that point. Even some shaved pineapple, marinated in ginger and black pepper, on the side, which was no slouch as far as garnishes go. A very light, crisp dessert, which was nice after the rich quail. Finally, something similar to what I've experienced at Frontera Grill - citrus with chocolate. A grapefruit gelee and grapefruit segments with a light cocoa nib sorbet, hazelnut parfait, and some foam (have to have foam). I never used to think this would be a good combo, but the chocolate/hazelnut obviously go together, and the grapefruit is a wonderful match, strange though it seems.

Service was outstanding as well - I sat at the bar and watched over a staff busily assembling each dish with tweezers - no joke. Maybe this is common, I don't know, as I usually can't see the kitchen when I'm at spots like this. My waiter, Kawika, was exceedingly helpful with recommendations (I had to choose the quail or the lamb - I chose right), discussions of the flavors in the dishes, just a very polite and attentive server.

As I said, this was a better tasting menu than I've ever enjoyed. Better than Alinea in its mix of flavors and general execution. Better than Charlie Trotter's...which I haven't even written a review for, as I can't remember it well enough. I had my ""oh my god"" moment during that quail course, so I have no problem awarding 5 stars. It won't win on value - more than Tru or Sixteen would be in Chicago, although still less than Alinea or Trotter's. But the food and the service was truly outstanding. I'm very happy I splurged.",tPufvUuxXLJOMYQ7gzsMVA,2,2,5,wppVVOrgwCKSdVgiDAIP6g
5736012,2010-01-06,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Not a bad restaurant by any means, but I don't think it compares to some of the better restaurants in San Francisco, or that it is worth the money ($260 for two, including tip and a few glasses of wine).

The two tasting menu options are $85 and $175 each, and though I think $85 would be worth it for great food, I wasn't overly impressed with anything on the tasting menu.  Plus, even though the BF has a seafood allergy, they refused to make any substitutions to the tasting menu for him, so he had to order a la carte, which I thought was tacky of them (every other nice restaurant we have been to has made exceptions for this).

From the tasting menu, the ""mussels"" turned out to be a murky soup with two measly mussels floating in there.  It was poorly seasoned and overly spicy in spots due to a far-too-generous sprinkling of Spanish red pepper - in fact, there were a few bites in there which left me visibly panting.  The langostino fritter and the beef cheek entree were good but not great.  I thought the cheese plate was decent but unnecessary and didn't add anything to the meal, and though the dessert tarts were tasty, I was so underwhelmed by the time that they came out that they couldn't save the meal for me.

The BF got 3 dishes from the a la carte menu, including the foie gras ravioli, which was so rich it was actually difficult to eat.  I tasted everything he ordered, and on balance, found the food to be passable but certainly not amazing or even particularly well-seasoned.

You can also order off an extensive a la carte menu which seemed to offer some good options, but the pricing is extremely high on these selections (for instance, the Spanish ham and tomato bruschetta is $39 for an appetizer portion), which deterred me from ordering off of it since the tasting menu seemed like a much better deal.

The ambiance is a little odd - you sit at a counter elbow-to-elbow with other diners and watch your food being cooked.  A friend described this as very ""Top Chef"" to me, but you are too far away to really see what is going on, and not far away enough to ignore it, if that makes any sense.

In sum, this is one of the lesser-priced options for nice restaurants in Vegas.  Most of the other big chef name restaurants are way more expensive, including the regular, non-Atelier version of Joel Robuchon, which is $385 per person.  However, in retrospect, I would have saved the money and gone to a more casual place for dinner, since the food didn't measure up to the cost.",8RJLKddxkjTBu2JH0BM1pQ,0,0,3,j5-wkHBojWjMJvdQXO1u1A

L'AMUSE-BOUCHE - Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam - This was a great start to the meal, the richness of the foie gras paired perfectly with the sharp parmesan flavor. Very interesting pairing.

Celery mousse with wasabi, beef stew gelée and slices of foie gras - This dish was beautifully plated, but it was the low point of the meal and I am still trying to figure it out. It was cold and you couldn't taste the foie gras at all. In my first bite I tasted nothing but salt, my second bite was nothing but wasabi, so confusing and cold.

Poached baby Kussi oysters with French « Echiré » butter - I don't eat oysters, but these were beautiful. The plate was gorgeous and they were the perfect temperature, warm and rich! Yum!

Seared lobster on a macaroni with wild mushrooms - I was looking forward to this dish and it was good. The lobster was a little chewy, but the dish was rich and the broth was delicious. 

White onion tart with smoked bacon, quail egg ""mirror"" and green asparagus - Another high point of the meal. This tart was delicate and beautiful. Everything worked well together, simply stunning! 

Monkfish cheek and baby leeks, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger - The fish was slightly chewy and difficult to cut, but the flavor was citrusy and overall fantastic.

Foie gras stuffed free-range quail with mashed potatoes - This is a signature dish and I could see why. It was so fantastic! The mashed potatoes are also a signature dish of Robuchon and I thought that was a little weird, but you haven't had mashed potatoes until you have had these! So amazing!

French-style hanger steak with mashed potatoes - The steak was good, nothing special.

Pecan cake topped with fresh apples cooked in Calvados, cinnamon-brown sugar ice cream - This is a lot like apple pie, good but I wished it was warm. 

Orange infused with caramel and milk chocolate mousse bar - I am not a huge fan of orange and chocolate, but this wasn't terrible. The orange was tart and I wished I had something with a bit more chocolate. 

We finished the meal with coffee. Overall, it was a fantastic journey, but not the best meal of my life. It was fun being at the counter and watching everything. It was definitely a pleasurable dining experience.",p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ,1,0,4,vIObozPrijeNq4-r_zmjrQ

If you're looking for candlelit romance with white tablecloths and suit jackets, go next-door to its sister restaurant ""Robuchon"" (just be prepared to pay twice as much).

That's fine though, because the bar seating gives you a complete view of the kitchen, which is immaculate and incredibly entertaining to watch.

I opted for the tasting menu, which was heavy on the seafood. The scallop seared in butter and topped with a scallion and ginger oil sauce was very good. The foie gras steak was good, though a little unimaginative in preparation. I had high expectations for the quail stuffed with foie gras, but I was completely let down -- the quail ended up being dry and tough, with that annoying tough dry ""skin"" from over-searing.

I also sampled the jambon and spaghetti, which were both excellent. The side of bread, which apparently they make on-site, was amazing. And to round it off, the service was extremely attentive. 

So why three stars? In short, I felt that the food wasn't that inspired. The seafood dishes -- the scallop and the sole filet -- are practically carbon copies of Chinese dishes; revelatory, perhaps, if you've never had it before, but for a seasoned Chinese seafood eater, par for the course. There wasn't even a French spin on the dishes! How lazy. Also, the inconsistent quality of the preparation was a little disappointing.

It definitely didn't help that Picasso at the Bellagio (where we had dined two nights before) set a pretty damned high bar for our dining experiences in Vegas!",Nuao7OLH9-D9Yws_uqxkGg,0,0,3,R_TCFYsV3gXmBFg4lfFOEw
5772882,2010-10-18,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Strangely, I was not able to check in here.  But I do remember going here my first night of Vegas... and I was quite disappointed.

Firstly, I was really excited to try out Chef Joel Robuchon's restaurant.  But I'd feel bad going there without my girlfriend... so my cousin and I went for the next best thing -- L'Atelier!

When we arrived we saw the L'unique menu for just $49.  We were pretty stoked at that point!  The L'unique was basically their pre-theater menu where food would arrive in about 15 minutes.

Service here is basically hit or miss.  I wasn't really overly dressed, fit in with the crowd dress wise.  But maybe because I was a lot younger looking, I felt they kinda shrugged us off.  One server quickly handed us a menu without explaining ANYTHING.  When we noticed the pre-theater menu we had to ask a different server about it.  That server was much better... wish we had him.

Anyway, things continued downhill from there.  The food arrived a bit slower than we anticipated (about 25 minutes?).  I didn't mind that at all as we didn't have any big plans after... just wanted to hit the tables.  But when we tasted the food... I think I almost cried.

The appetizers I had was the shrimp and my cousin got sardines on toast.  This wans't too bad.  It was good, but I did expect better from such a restaurant of this stature.

For the entree we both elected to get halibut.  This was REALLY disappointing.  My cousin, who's not picky at all, noticed that the halibut wasn't very fresh.  The fish was also overcooked and poorly seasoned.  The tomato broth that came with the halibut was the highlight, sadly.

The dessert was also... OK.  We both got creme brulee.  I noticed how this had a great texture, silky smooth... but it just wasn't rich enough.  I always anticipate a rich flavor when eating creme brulee -- that just didn't happen this time.

All in all, very disappointing.  It hurts to give this restaurant a 1 star, but I am definitely not coming back here.  For two pre-theater menus, a couple beers and a bottle of water, we paid $130 pre tip.  We both agreed that hitting up Burger Bar would've been a better first meal at Vegas.",Jndb3IoOrN-xj1QFxvKAcA,1,0,1,xzjBynp0NQDEoTvMAAHPAA

5781615,2011-03-28,3,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"OMG!  Where to start?!  Let's just say that this place is on the double + list!

The food here is SO fantastic.  It's one of those places where every first bite you take from a new course, you can only chew twice before you have to stop, let your still occupied mouth gape open enough to mutter the words, 'oh my god'.  Then your eyes roll back in your head, your neck goes weak and the grin comes.  You know that moment?  Yeah, that good.

First was the amuse.  No, wait.  First was the bread!  Even the bread was that amazing.  Teeny baguette with a crusty but still kinda soft crust and a chewy but delicate crumb smeared with rich, salty butter.  Fab.  Probably the best 'baguette' I've ever had in my life.  Period.  Not to mention the dainty little croissant-like beauty that I could have eaten 3 of had I not been afraid of its affects on my waistline.  They were somethin' else.  Really.

Back to the amuse bouche.  Also wonderful.  I wish I remembered the details as to not dumb it down, but I don't.  The bottom layer was some tomato gelee (but in no way was it rubbery) and the top was a silky avocado cream.  It was round and had depth.  It made my mouth water and then softly coated it.  The greens and sliced radishes provided a freshness and crunch.  It was an excellent start.

Then we had the langoustine fritter.  I have to admit that I was expecting something else by the use of the term 'fritter' but was, none the less, complete happy with the dish in actuality.  Instead of a batter that utilized the meat of the crustacean, it was the little body in its entirety, encompassed in a most delicate wonton-esc wrapper, then deep fried to a crispy golden brown.  The basil leaf laid atop the meat showed through the mostly transparent wrapper and the pesto beneath enhanced its purpose.  The langoustine, itself was, of course, sweet, flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The lightly lemon-y baby greens lent a lovely, bright counterpart to the dish.  

Then came our absolute favorite.  Foie gras stuffed quail with truffle mashed potatoes.  Um, yeah.  They somehow managed to de-bone the body of the quail (someone in that kitchen has amazing knife skills:) and wrap it around a piece of foie gras.  I wonder how long it took to perfect this dish.  I bet that was a fun one to test over and over.  Not to mention that next to it sat a pillow of butter ladened, velvety black truffle mashed potatoes that alone were truly luxurious.   The dish was so rich and delicious, I don't think we spoke one word to each other throughout the that course.

And as if that weren't decedent enough, we also ordered the beef and foie gras burger with caramelized bell peppers.  So adorable!  Two tiny, burgers layered with a slice of seared foie, onions and bells and a little tuft of micro greens.  I'm not sure the greens even had a chance of lending flavor amidst its companions but were pretty, none the less.  A smear of gastrique took ketchup's place, helping to cut the fat for one bite or so but wasn't missed on the rest.  (Fries: meh... not really worth talking about.)

Unfortunately, we weren't able to taste an of the jamon iberico that was being hand sliced with such care.  In quantity and calorically, we'd had our fill!

Next was a simple espresso with beautiful crema and a creamy, little milk chocolate.  The perfect finish.

L'Atelier is sexy and swanky; all red and black.  Seating is mostly at the bar that lines the open kitchen with few tables on the perimeter of the small and intimate restaurant.  And as you can imagine, the service was impeccable.  Not a flaw to be found.  New food runners and other support staff kept popping up from unknown places and our server never left our vision.  This place is so clearly dialed, it most certainly deserves its Michelin star.

I would also like to disclose that one also pays for an experience such as this one.  L'Atelier was by no means a bargain.  It was quite expensive but well worth it.  When expectations of greatness are not only met but surpassed, dropping this kind of dough is merited.

I see by all the four and five star reviews that there are many people out there who are enamored by atmosphere, rather than truly good food.  

Do not get me wrong.  I do not profess to be a New York Times food critic, but I have been on this Earth for a few years and have eaten at a great many places.

I guess I am old school.  I expect exorbitant  quality to come with exorbitant prices.  I expect value.  When it comes to paying top dollar for a meal, I expect the whole experience to blow me away.

To be fair, L'Atelier looks great.  Lots of glass.  Open. Classy.  Very good staff, as well.  But, when writing this review I had to search Las Vegas restaurants due to the fact that I could not remember the exact name of the place...not good.

Wifey and I came here for a special occasion.  We ordered the discovery menu.  Pricey, but we knew that this joint was high end going in.  We also had the wine pairing along with the various plate.  We sat at the bar, which was nice.  We could see all the chefs doing their thing.

The food was ok.  Now, if we had paid $100, even $1!50 for our food, I would say we got a decent though high priced meal.  Essentially, the cost of our meal was almost equivalent to what I paid for my first car.  Btw, I had that car for ten years.  Like I said, I do not mind paying top dollar for a meal.  As long as I get what I paid for.  The service was good, but the food was not worth the money.

Service was on point- from the waiter, sommelier, the director, down to the waiter's assistant- they always made sure we were happy as can be.  The set up of the restaurant is real cute and comfortable.  I believe the translation of L'atelier means studio in English.  It's a pretty clever name and if you've been to this restaurant you'd know why.  I'd recommend sitting at the bar because the experience is heightened times ten!

The food is non pretentious, but not exactly simple either; it's the way the food is plated that makes you think otherwise.

Sounds weird, doesn't it?   Allow me to explain.   I have heard great things about both Joel Robuchon's places in the MGM.   But I have never really gotten into the whole French Food thing.   So, before dropping a grand at the big restaurant, we wanted to try L'Atelier.

All dishes were excellent, but my favorites were the Suckling Pig and the Duck.  It was just enough food, and left me feeling satisfied, but no uncomfortable.

After going to Mix earlier in the week, I do think that Mix is a better deal and slightly better quality.  Mix also provided 3 ""gifts"" with the meal, that were very welcome surprises.  Who doesn't like a gift???  L'Atelier only had one gift at the beginning, but as I told my coworker, it might have been one of the best presents I have ever received!!  The Amuse Buche (which is the gift), was a foie gras concoction with foam.  It was delightful and a great way to start the meal.

I hope to return to L'Atelier with other coworkers later this week, but it depends how much work we will be doing.  Overall, a great meal!!",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,3,4,5,u3Nrb-pgM1rn7xoX1-lJWQ

I came here in January for a friend's birthday the entire group tried the club tasting menu. The food was superb. The amuse bouche was this shot of something with foie gras. Everything came out in artful presentations and tasted great. The langoustine was my favorite and everyone got to try all the different items on the menu since we all ordered different things. The starter was one of the yummiest with clams, don't remember what it was but everyone was asking for more bread to soak up the goodness :D
However there was a ""fine print"" when the waiter asked us what we want to drink or something we said water, he asked us sparkling or distilled, we said distilled without realizing it was going to be added into our tab. After 2 bottles we started questioning cuz who wants to pay for water when you can drink tap for free so after clarification they refilled with tap water. I think it was a little unfair because we didn't know about the water and you know how vegas is, everything is expensive.",XiDyKrnuJFlgpbC6q7oOjg,1,0,4,kOi_7p34A8oRx5r-2UIPWA

5830950,2016-12-06,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"While in Las Vegas, we chose this as our romantic dinner. We had built this place up in our heads as an amazing, mind blowing place and it was good but it didn't take it to the next level for us. It is a Michelin star restaurant and some of the things (nit picky things) made it seem like just another place and not at the Michelin star level. 

The ambiance is very nice but things like paper place mats at the table seemed less nice than expected. I did like the view into the kitchen as you could watch them prepare everything. The decor was very nice. 

The service was very good too. The waiter and bus boys were on top of everything as far as cleaning up plates and paying attention to us. They pointed out when our steak was cooking so we could watch and other little things that were nice touches. Things that weren't so nice for a restaurant like this, the waiter took our order by writing it down in a little $2 notebook you can buy at CVS. Also, he brought the wrong food at one point. We ordered the langoustine and he brought us the king crab salad. He did promptly correct his mistake and let us keep the salad but mistakes like this shouldn't happen. 

Now onto the food and drink. We got a pear cocktail which was very fresh and tasted like the juiced a pear and put it in the glass. Very good. We realized we don't like foie grais with the Amuse-bouche. It was nice to try but not our cup of tea. We followed that with fantastic iberico ham and tomato toast, citrus fish carpaccio, and fried langoustine. Fantastic! The ham was the best but they were all amazingly good. They brought out the crab salad at this point as well. Not that good but nice to taste it. It didn't sound appealing to us which is why we didn't order it but you may like it. We also got a pumpkin soup that was very tasty but ultimately he least favorite appetizer. Next came the main course. The lobster tagliatelle and the wagyu steak. The main lobster pasta was delicious! The steak was ok. So here's the thing. The steak cost $98. It wasn't a $98 steak. It was very good and had good flavor but it was fatty. If I ordered this steak at a Ruth's Chris or another place, it would have been great. But here? I expected a bit more. The temperature was slightly more rare than medium rare but still cooked very nicely. Good flavor but I would look elsewhere for a main course.  The mashed potatoes, however, were the best I've ever eaten. Creamy and smooth but rich with very good flavor.

The dessert...the dessert was fantastic! The right way to end a meal. We went chocolate. It had a chocolate ganache base, then chocolate crunch balls, then a circular white chocolate ice cream powdered in Oreo cookie crumble, then a thin halo of milk chocolate with dabs of passion fruit and raspberry on it with a gold drop at the top. This was a Michelin star dessert. It was an amazing way to end a meal. I can't recommend this enough.

Overall, it's hard for a restaurant of this caliber to surpass expectations. It was very good and I would recommend it but not quite at the level we expected.",L_oRjqASIcMJ4cLYHxUxNg,0,0,4,fkv2WPzFwF-FmWUHTZK9Kw
5833013,2010-12-17,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"This was an experience.  The restaurant.  The staff.  And of course the food.  Even before sitting down at our table, my mouth was watering.  I couldn't wait to see what kind of imagination and culinary mastery was about to be unleashed upon us.  From the amazing bread basket to the french pressed coffee, it was perfect.  

Whenever I go to restaurants by world class chefs that we don't have back home in Hawaii, I like to go for the sampling/seasonal menu.  We all opted for the seasonal discovery menu.

We had L'amuse Bouche to start off the flavor explosions.  It was foie gras with a foam on top served in a shot glass.  This was my favorite.  The foie gras was so creamy.  The foam had a lot of taste.  You'd think the foam wouldn't but this one did.  Hit me with more shots!

Next was Le Crabe Royale.  Like a deluxe chunky crab salad between two thinly sliced turnip disc.  And a very very tasty sauce.  Nice.

La Saint-Jacques was up next.  A sea scallop in a chive oil/sauce.  Very sweet and perfectly cooked.  Clean.  

La Cebette, a white onion tart with smoked bacon and asparagus.  

The next one that came out, I don't recall the name here, was like a mushroom soup on steroids.  I liked this one very much.  it had a lightly poached egg underneath and when the yolk burst, it just made it become richer in taste and feel.  

La Sole was a dover sole with leek and ginger.  I really liked this one.  The fish was prepared perfectly.  Firm but not mushy.  A little bit of a crust to give a textural contrast.  The leeks and ginger complimented the fish nicely.

The next course was a choice between a quail stuffed with fois gras or a hangar steak.  I got the steak and my wife got the quail and we switched half-way through the dish.  You can't compare the two so if you go, go with a partner so you can sample both.

The two desserts were totally different but both winners.  One was a cool refreshing mojito inspired ice/ice cream.  Tasted like a mojito and very light and tart.  Kinda refreshing after all the different flavors we had just tasted.  The second one was a hazlenut kind if cake.  Layers of chocolate and hazlenut mousse I believe.  What it was, it was rich and tasty.  Sorry, I didn't get the name of these dishes.

Like the name says, this is Chef Robuchon's workshop.  He put out some really nice and exciting dishes.  Ones that I would have never dreamed of.  Staff and service were very helpful and informative.  Big ups all around for this place.",cgQd4Xs3Y8uTGHz-gjLEGQ,0,0,4,AyjAjUgcHotMWztLWacSOw

I made our dinner reservation three weeks in advance, and asked for counter seating. I was told it would be no problem. I also called the day before our dinner to confirm our reservation and once again were told it would counter seating. When we arrived at the restaurant 15 mins prior to our reserved, we were told that we can't sit at the counter and they can only give us a table. I explained to the hostess that I had just confirmed our seating the day prior. She was very rude and just threw up her hands and told us there was nothing she can do. The restaurant was completely empty at the time. I asked to speak to a manager. A guy with a red tie came out and stood right in front of me checked the computer screen, after ignoring us for a good 2 minutes. He told us seats are never guaranteed. He also proceeded to lecture both my husband and I that if we sit at the counter, another party wouldn't be able to eat at the restaurant tonight at all. His tone was incredibly obnoxious. We never raised our voices to either the whole time, if I this restaurant weren't so highly rated, we would walked away for sure. He finally did give us counter seats, but by that time,  he had managed to ruin a good part of our dinner experience already. I kept worrying about if another group were not going to be able to dine there because like he lectured, but the restaurant was never full the entire time we were there (6pm-9pm), there were always tables and counters available. The counter seats we did get were right by the entrance, so it was rather loud and my entire view of the kitcken were blocked by the corner decorations in the kitchen. 

I would not have given the restaurant a one star rating if the dishes were outstanding. We had the discovery menu and menu B. We got to try quite a few dishes that night. They were so underwhelming, I don't understand the 5 star rating on yelp. I was particularly disappointed at their signature dish- La Caille quail with foie gras served with mashed potatoes. It wasn't even good, barely warm to the touch and pretty bland. They also managed to over cook a fish dish I had. I can't pick out a single dish that stood out to me on the entire discovery menu. 

Our server was pleasant and the presentations were nice. But given the bad service we encountered at the door and the mediocre food.  This is no way of deserving a michelin star. The few other michelin starred places we have been to in LA, SF and Japan are far superior in both service and food.

The menu was a big confusing having divided into two main brackets - vague wordings of small dishes and large dishes- and we were a bit unsure of the portion sizes. There were of course course/set menus but I personally do not like foie gras so that wasn't an option for me. All our expectation was high given the chefs brand, the occasion (Thanksgiving dinner!) and the $$$ price tag, yet I want to say that we enjoyed our meal here! 

Some of the memorable highlights from the night were the onion tart, hanger steak (our favorite!!), beef tartar, French fries(!) and potato mash. I will take off a star though because it still felt that everything on the menus was too dramatically expensive (hardly any appetizers/side dishes on the menu that are under $30) and because my main dish the $97 wagyu steak was just underwhelming. I'd recommend this place to French cuisine lovers but maybe not to those who try to avoid dairy (myself included) or can't care for foie gra, as the menu selection will be a bit limiting.",WdjY2YabRVvdQFB36fNsAQ,0,1,4,1Tokja9xgYbf3eGGldvWjQ

*** Bread ***
I don't know what that small yellow roll was, but it was so delicious. I ate 3... It's comparable to the bread I tried in Paris!

*** Palate Opener ***
So much flavor packed into this, it was presented in a small shot glass. The flavor was SO complex and you just get layers and layers of flavor in each bite.

*** 1st Course ***
I got the hamachi with sea urchin & caviar (need to add $10 to $58). It was amazing!!! I always thought sea urchin was supposed to be bitter, but this sea urchin is like butter in your mouth! It was sweet and flavorful. When you eat pair it with hamachi & caviar, it feels like you are at the pier, sun in your face, and wind in your hair. 

*** 2nd Course ***
After my 1st plate, I thought, ""Ok for oysters, how can they make oysters taste more delicious than they already are?"" I got the Kushi baby oysters served on a bed of sea salts with lemon on the side. Squeeze a little lemon in your oyster, put just a pinch of sea salt, then be prepared to be amazed. I felt like I was transformed to a mermaid who's eating the best oysters in the sea. I thought I was crazy for feeling this way and I asked a friend who has tried this before and he said he felt like he WAS the oyster after eating this. 

*** Dessert ***
We got 2 desserts. First one is white chocolate with cream and chocolate inside. The presentation was so pretty. If the poison apple were real, it would probably look like this. The 2nd dessert was pistachio ice cream with creme brulee. Very good, the ice cream was not pistachio-flavored/ artificial, it is truly pistachio. It was rich and paired well with the light-flavor of the creme brulee. 

This place is a must try if your wallet allows it! Also I would recommend the 2 course menu option since the food here is full of flavor, not sure my palate would be able to take 3 course plus dessert. Can never go back now...",u0RWshAnG7RdEnP6Cr4V6A,3,1,5,KLr_y-6pRwf9D4Q-NNcC9Q

As soon as you walk into the doors of L'Atelier you feel as if you are emerged into a colorful kaleidoscope, a seemingly whole new world. The shockingly colorful display of: shaved carrots, sliced cucumbers, bunches of on- vine tomatoes, and other produce set the frame for the ironically steely cool heartland, the kitchen. The colors of the produce are so vibrant that one can easily come to the conclusion that L'Atelier uses only the finest and freshest of ingredients.

There is no crap here.

The kitchen is somewhat somber and serious. Yet it is open and visible to almost every seat of the intimate restaurant. The numerous stations within the kitchen boastfully display; an army of methodical perfectionists that seem to express themselves not through emotions but through the bravado of flavors of each plate. The counter that serves as a moat keeps the regular people patrons at bay, and only seats about 20. The other seats in the establishment are geared for larger parties. But no worries, grab a seat at the counter and enjoy the show.

L'Atelier amused my mouth with a lovely foie gras with a port wine reduction and parmesan foam. The decadent, flavorful, and savory amuse bouche rolled off my tongue like butter.

We then moved onto a surprisingly refreshing buffalo mozzarella with vegetables. Basil, zucchini, sweet sundried tomatoes with spears of basil pesto.

Our next course was quail stuffed with foie gras and truffled mashed potatoes. (This was an additional dish not included in the $75 winter tasting menu).

Deep fried langoustine with basil. The paper wrapper was fairly thin and crispy so if I were you (instead of a fork and knife) I would opt to pick it up by the toothpick and stick it in your mouth pronto.

Hanger steak with onions. Be aware that L'Atelier cooks their meat the exactly the way you ask for it. My steak was a bit too rare for me.

Did someone say cheese? Fromage!

The sorbet and ice cream selection. Variety of tarts and cheesecakes to conclude our meal.

The highlights of my meal: foie gras parfait, mozarella and vegetables, quail and foie gras, langoustine, and tarts.

Maybe my expectations were too high. We had both psyched ourselves up about L'Atelier since our first trip to Vegas in 2009, before we were married. We've made reservations that ended up having to be canceled for one reason or another on 6 different visits to Las Vegas. Now that I'm 34 weeks pregnant with our first baby and about to pop, we decided we had to tackle the things that had been on our list for so long, and might be impossible to do for a very, very long time once our little princess is born. 

So, we chose the perfect date for our dinner on our final Las Vegas babymoon: it so happened to be the very first day we were introduced to each other.

While I enjoyed L'Atelier, it definitely did not meet my expectations. I'm sure many of these reviews came at a time when the open kitchen concept and cooking style was considered innovative and revered by the industry.

I only loved ONE of the dishes I tried from their tasting menu and liked two. (See pictures for ratings of each thing I tried.) The rest was barely even good. Let's not forget the giant fishbone I gagged on, too. I left it on the plate so they could see it, and not a single staff member commented.

Also, they consider the Amuse Bouche and Coffee as courses. (Seemed a bit cheap of them, really.) Unlike most other Michelin-starred restaurants I've been to, there were no palate cleansers or additional courses, aside from the delicious selection of cakes at the end of the meal due to it being a special occasion. 

Was it worth the amount of money we spent on the meal? Definitely not. I could list at least 20 other Michelins I would put ahead of L'Atelier. Am I glad I FINALLY tried it after years of wondering if it really was as good as all the rave reviews said it was? Yes.

The service is exceptional and I appreciate how accommodating they are.",BW6y9Y9yM79DZO7E31Ri_Q,2,1,5,hVPT_E6sn3SEr0LjAqg8PQ
5945418,2015-08-17,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,I made reservations a few weeks ahead and it was one of the best decisions I've made. It was quite pricey but so worth it. One of the best dining experience ever. Very good ventilation because we couldn't smell the food cooking even though we sat overlooking the kitchen. We couldn't even hear much noise of the cooking either. I've never had french food this good. We got the discovery seasonal 10 course tasting menu. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. We dined for about 3 hours. We were quite full when we reached our 5th course but made ourselves finish everything.  Our bill was $650 including tip. We also ordered a $95 bottle of champagne.,Kx4RtLVvwFuH2F4hWKB0ig,1,0,5,pkWJAZKHyrhV-GNMLq4KgA
5953675,2010-03-23,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Vegas so far, which isn't saying much, since I've only had buffets). We had tickets for a show at 8pm, and ended up bumping up our reservation last minute to 530pm (when the restaurant opens) without a hitch.

The atmosphere is definitely very trendy -- black lacquer countertops, red roses, clear hurricanes of colorful peppers, fruit & red roses around an open kitchen -- and despite the business casual recommendation, there were many people in jeans and tshirts as well. 

Atmosphere/ service: The countertop seating gives you the best view of the kitchen, and feels like a sushi bar. The waiters are definitely attentive, probably bc they can't escape you looking at them when your'e done eating.

FOOD
Menu: There's a tasting menu, a smaller 5 course menu, tapas (about $20/ plate, NOT recommended), and traditional appetizers + main course menu. And also a theatre menu (L'Unique) with 3 courses all on one plate for $39, served in 15 min. We ordered the club menu, plus a tapas, appetizer, and dessert a la carte-- more than enough for 2 people. We enjoyed a half bottle of sparkling rose ($50, light and fruity but not recommended-- gave us headaches afterwards). 

Overall, the portions weren't huge but it was definitely very rich-- either with butter, cream, or heavily doused in olive oil. Such is French cooking, eh? (Actually, it was more Californian style than French, with the exception of a heavy hand in cream, butter, and olive oil in every dish.)

Breaking it down: (updated from website; it's not posted there yet)
1. Amuse bouche: foie gras, port wine reduction, and parmesan foam parfait. Salty, foamy, and well balanced, savorly bite to start the evening. Best dish of the evening.
2. Mussels in a chowder: very creamy, also very savory and o
3. Langosteen dumping with arugula/ spring salad - tasted like shrimp tempura, but the lobster was very tender; the salad was a pass
4. Pounded veal - just OK
5. Trio of goat, cow's,  and cow's cheeses (in order of robust to mild) served with walnut-raisin bread (best to eat on its own, or with a mild cheese), egg-walnut bread, and country bread (best with goat cheese). Cheeses were fresh, imported from France. 
6. Five traditional tarts slices - chocolate (just OK), white chocolate with lemon sauce, pineapple filling & earl gray toasted rice crispies (the best of the 5), chocolate cinnamon ganache (deceivingly rich), raspberry (fresh and light), and Snickers (very rich, although an actual Snickers bar isn't hard to recreate :-P)
7. Anchovy, red bell pepper, and eggplant  confit - must eat all ingredients together for proper seasonings and savoriness. Without the anchovies, the entire dish is bland and oily. Ample servings to share. I had to eat it with bread to balance out the oil.
8. Seasonal vegetable salad - wayyyy too much olive oil; even after eating, we had 3 tbsp left of oil on the bottom of the plate. Seasonal vegetables = olives, endives, butter lettuce, and avocado. Definitely not to be ordered again!
9. Sorbets and ice creams - refreshing ending. 5 scoops of mandarin orange sorbet (favorite), vanilla bean, coffee (both mediocre), raspberry sorbet (light), and pistachio ice cream (second favorite) topped with sugar crisp and 2 pieces of thin chocolate.

Other information:
- Our waiter informed us all the food was shipped directly from France, including the cheese. 
- Joel Robuchon makes his own bread (complimentary, bottomless bread basket with mini baguettes, country bread rolls, and buttery plain crossaints) bc ""he couldn't find a good bakery in Vegas.""
- Still water costs $8 (Evian).
- Reservations recommended, need to confirm 72 hrs in advance to secure
- NOT for vegetarians or vegans - every dish has seafood or meat except the bread. 
- If you're allergic to shellfish, tell the restaurant in advance and they have some menu alternatives.

Overall, 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5). Quite expensive ($260 including tax/ tip for the two of us) but worth the money every so often.",7Xpb51viDdOaV_89olxp5w,0,0,3,jr-fl2ovJUi5EQzdn9Rw1Q

Finally got to try this amazing restaurant last night. Each dish was carefully assembled with tweezers using only the best ingredients, flavourful micro vegetables, spices and colorful flowers. Sitting at the counter in front of the kitchen was a great treat. It was like taking a class at University of Joel Robouchon secret food laboratory. One of the best food experiences I have ever had.

5966067,2015-02-27,14,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"OUR 530 MILE JOURNEY...
If one has not seen the movie, The Hundred-Foot Journey, this is a must see for all Foodies out there.  The famed Michelin Star and the love of food is the parallel between this movie and L'Atelier.

The photographs on Yelp are quite tantalizing; that is what drew us here.  Modern, sleek, innovative, intriguing.  Looks are one thing; substance is another.  Growing up, I learned from my mother that it pays to seek and obtain things of quality.  I appreciate her views on living even more so now and am willing to pay a pretty penny for quality, as well as rarity, lastingness and especially for those amazing life experiences.

With our recent getaway to Vegas, my husband and I carefully planned out our days with shows, attractions and restaurants.  L'Atelier was on the top of that list.  In fact, we blocked out 4 hours of our evening in anticipation of dining here.  We sat at the bar, which we found that most couples and singles were seated.  The tables behind us were occupied by four or more people.  I love sitting at the bar, where one can engage the senses by watching the food preparation and all the busyness of the kitchen.

Since my husband and I wanted to sample the many dishes available to us, we each ordered different tasting menus.  My husband ordered Menu B which included an Amuse Bouche, two appetizers, two main courses and one dessert.  I ordered their most extensive tasting, the 10-course Seasonal Discovery Menu, which included:  an Amuse Bouche, four appetizers, two main courses, two desserts and a coffee of my choosing.

At One Michelin star and $168 per head, this meant one excited lady with taste buds exploding with excitement and anticipation.  How could this be anything but a fabulous experience.  Remember, I'm all about collecting these experiences.

Unfortunately, our dining experience here left me a bit perplexed and weary of the restaurant's overall review.  One may have had an entirely different experience; however, this was mine:

*Amuse Bouche (which technically shouldn't be counted as one of the courses on the menu).  
Foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and Parmesan emulsion.  The first dish out and this dish did not have me at attention.  An Amuse Bouche should offer a glimpse of the chef's approach to his cuisine.  If this is so, then it was foretelling of the evening to come.  Overhearing one of the waitstaff tell another guest that it took him 10 tries to ""get used to"" this dish was not promising.  Well, at this dining level, one should not have to get accustomed to anything, as everything should be amazing.

*Shrimp carpaccio with Yuzu vinaigrette ($35 extra for Cavier).  Thinly sliced shrimp in a vinaigrette; this dish was good, but nothing that wowed me.

*Celeriac rémoulade with fresh wasabi mayonnaise and black truffle.  Mediocre, with just a hint of wasabi and mostly mayonnaise.  The most disappointing part of this dish was that the slices of truffle did not have even a hint of truffle taste in it.

*Sea scallop cooked in the shell with chive oil on an artichoke jus.  This dish was okay.  The scallop was slightly overcooked, but was better than the other dishes.

*Foie gras herb tortellini served in a bouillon (dashi) with white soy sauce.  This dish was a big disappointment.  The ""dashi"" was watered down and barely evident in the broth.  The Foie gras in the tortellini was filled sparingly where the center just dissolved in my mouth.

*Fresh salmon confit, atop collard green and juniper berries, kale emulsion.  Okay, this is where things started getting better.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and this dish was nicely seasoned.

*Caramelized free range quail stuffed with Foie gras served with mashed potatoes.  Aside from the desserts, this was the BEST dish of the evening.  The caramelized quail had a nice crunch to its skin and had a wonderful flavor.  The only area lacking was that it was slightly overcooked, leaving one of the quail pieces not as tender as it could have been.  

*For the two desserts:  Litchi mousse on a thin black current tuile, Caribbean sorbet and the Spiced ""cremeux"" on sage crumbles with ginger ice cream.  The desserts were delicious.  My strong Cafe Latte was served immediately after my desserts.

So, whether you're taking, ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"", or in our case, ""The Five Hundred Thirty Mile Plane Ride"", the food has to be prepared with love, the depth of the chef's soul, and it must breathe life and positive energy.  Sadly, most everything was robotically prepared and most of the dishes didn't meet the standards of a Michelin One star restaurant.  Like I mentioned earlier, I am more than willing to pay for great food and a wonderful experience; however, with much disappointment, I did not receive either at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.",ZNwmZJg4nSXaFfoH25zl2Q,23,16,3,x4HR_-RL0B996_7YRQqZUA
5966758,2011-05-15,0,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"Just go!!  This was one of my all-time favorite dining experiences.  You have to be prepared for the format - rather than sitting at a table with a waiter, you sit a the ""bar"" surrounding the kitchen.  You get up-close-and-personal with your chefs, your sommelier, and your server.  It is simply amazing to watch the chefs prepare the meals.  Unfortunately we'd purchased show tickets; otherwise I could have stayed at L'Atelier for another 2 hours mesmerized by the kitchen and the plates they output.  

The food was OUTSTANDING, and the presentation is impeccable.  We went early (6:15) to get to a show, so my husband got the $59 3-course meal, and I ordered off the menu.  Both of us were overwhelmed with how good our choices were, and I can't say enough about the panna cotta w/ strawberries and white chocolate marshmallows.  The staff is friendly, and even while maintaining a high-standard of service, they were more than willing to chat with the customers

Everything about  L'Atelier was top-notch.",HYEF614y-rLOpdzFfYBnUg,0,0,5,RQTc72_aHByasjVRO6a2hA

The ambience is nice- we sat at the bar with a full view of the chefs working hard, perfecting their craft.  And the waiter was friendly, not overly attentive. 

The amuse-bouche was a fois gras parfait with port wine and parmesan foam.  OMG... I had to restrain myself from licking the plate, it is probably the best thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. That alone is why this review is 5 stars.  It would probably be too rich and too much flavor for anything but an amuse-bouche, but it was the perfect way to begin this gastronomical adventure.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS: king crab on turnip disc
Sea scallop with chive oil
Duck fois gras with confit quince and yuzu

DELICIOUS: onion tart with smoked bacon and grilled mushroom
Dover sole filet
Fois gras stuffed free range quail with truffled mashed potatoes. 

The dessert was okay and it might just be because I was already stuffed from the 7 dishes prior... Grapefrut infused with prosecco, lychee sorbet,  chocolate cake with espresso ice cream.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,0,0,5,lxIGYnFo1FCJeInhCM7OkQ
5979497,2011-02-12,2,mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q,"The first thing I did after checking in my hotel was to make a reservation at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon. Since I called in a couple of hours before they opened, they wern't able to take reservations. However, they do accept walk-ins but just be sure to get there when they open around 5:30 pm as the reservationist said I had a good probability of getting in. 

Not only is the decor amazing, the service is so wonderful and helpful without any sense of pretentiousness whatsoever. The staff takes care of you real well especially the serving chef that takes your order and brings you your food. At the bar area, hence ""L'Atelier"" meaning the workshop, you are served by one of the chefs as behind the bar counter is the kitchen.

I opted for the Club menu ($95). A big plus with L'atelier is that they allow you to substitute courses for any other items not offered by the specific menu for a surcharge depending on the requested dish. They do offer a la carte and two other menus which are the theater Menu ($45-50 for a 3 course pre-theater meal) and the Seasonal menu ($155 for many more courses).

For what I decided to drink throughout the meal, I went with one of the Bordeaux by the glass as I wasn't in the mood to break the bank in order to opt for the wine pairing. Also, they served me 3 different kinds of bread as well which I remembered tasted great. With what I could remember, I'm pretty sure they were a baguette, a butter roll, and a rosemary focaccia.

The Club Menu:

Amuse Bouche: Foie Gras Parfait with Parmesan foam - What a great way to kick off the meal with this custard-like starter.

1st Course: Le Foie Gras (I substituted the original mussels dish for a $10 surcharge) - This is seared foie gras from france on top of a bed of lentils. As what the serving chef said, usually seared foie gras is paired with sweet fruits such as cherries, apples or peaches. However, this dish is amazing as it was paired with savory lentils. It definitely was one of the best foie gras dishes I've ever had in my life.

2nd Course: La Langoustine - A langoustine fritter. This dish was great in presentation and taste. I like how the langoustine was not tough/chewy as shellfish do have the tendency to be overcooked. The only issue I have in my opinion was that there be some more acidic flavoring to it. A great dish nonetheless.

3rd Course - Le Boeuf (I chose this dish instead of the salmon dish) - The preparation I had was that it came out as braised beef cheeks. This rich dish was amazing and it definitely tops the best French braised beef dishes I've ever had. It was also accompanied with creamy penne pasta with various mushrooms.

4th Course: Les Fromages - The three various cow and sheep cheeses they offered were alright. I remembered one of them being Bleu cheese. The bread that accompanied them was great. The main issue  I have with this dish however is that the pieces were too big as most restaurants of this caliber serve cheeses thinner as to eat together with the bread. 

5th Course: Glaces et Sorbet - This dessert is composed of three different ice creams and three different sorbets accompanied with thin squares of candy and chocolates. I could only remember four out of six of them which were the coconut and Nutella ice creams, and strawberry and mango sorbets. The ice creams tasted great. However, I found the sorbets to be too tart.

Ending Drink - I opted for a single Macallan 18 yr served neat which tasted amazing. I was originally planning on having a cognac to end my meal seeing that it was a French restaurant after all. However, the price for a single Hennessy V.S.O.P was around $20 whereas the Macallan 18 yr was more around $15. I can't find an explanation for the prices as Hennessy V.S.O.P is around $45-50 a bottle whereas a  bottle of Macallan 18 yr will run you around $120-150. With those bottle prices, I found it to be a steal for Macallan 18 yr being served at 15 a pop at a fine dining establishment.

My experience at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon was nothing less than stellar. Not only did it live up to my expectations, it made me realize why Joel Robuchon was named Chef of the Century. With his novel and revolutionary methods of cooking and wonderful service omitting the stereotypical pretentiousness associated with these sort of restaurants paved way as a model for current fine dining establishments to take. I will definitely be coming back for their much grander Seasonal menu in the near future.",lGB5gi_mkD5tGaDIsw9biQ,4,1,5,utXCkJCz_mbK7QXbjTZIrQ

Decor:
Fancy, modern. There's seating around the kitchen, so you can watch all the chefs making your dishes. It's fun to watch!

Food:
We ordered the tasting menu, which consisted of what seemed like an endless number of courses. I felt like food just kept coming out nonstop! At some point, I gave up trying to remember the dishes and how many courses we ate because it required too much brainpower. The food was DELECTABLE. Joel Robuchon definitely knows how to please the palate.

My one disappointment was the bread. It was too dry. Felt like someone just doused my mouth with powder. The cheese, however, was delicious.

Wine:
Great wine selection, however, my liver wouldn't have been able to handle another glass of liquor from the weekend, so I decided to pass.
