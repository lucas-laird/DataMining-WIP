This was one of my wife's favorite places to eat until one night about a month ago when the waitress. Came to our table about 10 mins after we sat down to ask us what we wanted to drink. It was mid after noon not busy.

Then she never came back a runner had to bring us our refills and take our order and being us our food. In fact our waitress did not come back until we were done with our check.

We saw the waitress go to the two other tables that had people so maybe three tables were two many. 

Mind you I'm the kind of guy that will tip 25-50% if my service is good 
But because of the service I got I only left 3 dollars 

Tl:Dr never ever ever under any circumstance visit this location if I wanted to be treated less then human I'd wear a tail and leash. Hard pass from me.",esDTaP1UZeyXTsoBVI2fvg,1,0,1,KiwW7usSBqdJWJ310xacsg

The table behind us had troubles with their order as well . The supervisor told us since we had such a bad experience she was only going to charge us for about 2 meals . When the waitress brung us the check she we saw that we were charged for everything! Our food was cold and had hair in it ! Once we tried to explain that we were being charged for things the supervisor said she wasn't going to charge us for she Flipped out! The waitress was a white girl with red hair , bunch of tattoos and the worst attitude! My friends and I will never come here again !",YGAiqHU50PQ13BAWxuMucw,0,0,1,BMaiT2ANNPSTH8xC0kRiug
