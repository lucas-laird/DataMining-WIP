1169901,2017-07-08,3,h-vvpbPlzrR2KrjVvqBMrA,"The only thing that prevents me from giving one star is that they do have a very good blackened chicken caesar.  However, so does PT's up the street.

Grand opening, and I have never been more ignored.  Background, I was a regional server trainer.  Even if it's a quick acknowledgement, you notice your guests.  Make eye contact and then move on while they are waiting for service?  You just told your customer to go elsewhere.

Worse, I asked Erin about the buffet they had going on.  ""VIP's only, but I can get you a burger and a chicken skewer"".  Most gambling places, VIP status is based on play.  They just opened.  But I did see two children in the buffet line.  Far less than 21.  But no further info given.  Like, what qualifies as VIP.  Sales hit....   But no.  Just, only VIP, and you are not.

I did get a burger, a skewer, and a bag of chips.  There was cheese on the burger, American.  No lettuce, tomato, or anything.  And I wasn't even given a napkin.  I had to grab some of the bar napkins from the server carisole.  

Erin was in the weeds.  And in my opinion, you were busy, but not that busy.  I saw two other men getting drinks, so two bartenders; not bar backs.  Add further insult, I asked one of them, twice, for something.  Another drink, and a refill of my diet pepsi.  Both ignored.",lj7H3zx57BC7H1fYiWy-lw,0,0,2,wiR_X9pB3xqkXoDJvIg91A
1266579,2018-02-23,0,h-vvpbPlzrR2KrjVvqBMrA,"I had my wedding reception here in the private party room, and it was absolutely perfect!! 

A little background: my now-husband and I live in California but we got married at the MGM, so we had to plan everything from a distance. I did some Yelping and found Aloha Kitchen (a restaurant with the same owner, Liza), and made an appointment to meet her, a few months in advance. Liza and Myla, the front of house manager, met us at Aloha Kitchen, gave us an amazing tasting menu of Hawaiian food, and were incredibly friendly. 

When we explained that we wanted a private, small (30 people) party, with karaoke, dancing and Hawaiian food, Liza drove us herself to Jackpot down the street, and showed us the party room. We loved it immediately - clean, spacious, doesn't smell like smoke at all, nice dance floor, stage for karaoke, private bathroom, and PERFECT for a small or medium party!! We confirmed a mixed menu of Aloha Kitchen and Jackpot food, paid the deposit, went back to California, and from there we planned the whole party via email. 

Liza and Myla provided FIVE STAR+ customer service the entire time we were planning the party, and on the day of our reception, everything was exactly as we wanted.

Food: SO many people said it was delicious, and it was plentiful!! We had leftovers. I'm from Hawaii, and the Hawaiian food was sooo good! 

Price: 100% fair and reasonable. About $2300 for food, 4 alcoholic drinks per person, the DJ, private manager and cocktail waitress, and the private room for 4 hours, including tax and service fee, for 31 people. Technically we could have had 40 people (that's typically the minimum for a party at Jackpot), but Liza worked with us to allow a slightly smaller party and even threw in sparkling wine as a gift because we paid for the 40 minimum guests.

Staff: Princess the manager, the other waitresses, and the DJ and his assistant were fabulous - they provided service like it was the Bellagio or Venetian's most important party! 

Decor: The food table was very tastefully decorated; we brought our own tablecloths and cupcake stand. 

Music setup: the DJ was great, he really listened to what we wanted. The karaoke worked beautifully, the sound was clear and perfect, and there were even lights and fog - amazing! 

I want to come back here and host a party every year!!!",U0Szz55dlVrdFneSaY5JeA,0,0,5,KXmcH7Dzr0Ha40fINUW_yQ

The main part had gaming, tables, bar and several people were eating.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that our cocktail waitress was spread thin and I had to go to the bar to get another drink.

The bar was mostly empty, but the atmosphere was rather inviting. There was a vintage Vegas theme adorning the walls . A bartender named ""Vinny"" made the visit enjoyable, he told me about the comedy show they have on Wednesday nights and also how they have Poker tournaments. Vinny had a sense of humor and he provided good service.

Sadly, i did not try the food- which will be on another visit.

They ran out of Jack Daniels when i was there!! I was shocked at that, JD is  #1 in the top 10 selling Whiskey brands. They're just lucky i love whiskey period.

Check em out....tell em i sent ya!! Actually don't because they've only seen me once and will give you a weird look.

BTW- i certainly did not win a Jackpot at Jackpot Bar, I lost my rear end that day!",fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA,0,0,3,ww5YnfbN3JfOzleSuuvtzQ

This request was at 3 p.m. and my party time was for 9 p.m.  Within minutes I had a very reasonable price for my request! The staff went above and beyond their duties to make my husband's birthday party more than memorable. Susan you are a gem and I thank you from the bottom of my heart!

I'm literally waiting for the waitress to bring the check. This is after I waited almost 45 minutes for her to acknowledge my existence and serve me a beer. If I wasn't here for trivia with a group of friends, I would have left.  She also forgot my food and I had to tell the bartender our drink order and pick it up myself. In her favor, here was one of her and she had at least 5 tables to tend to, but she took care of 2 tables and forgot about the rest of us. Oh well, at least Sonic is open on the way home, if I can ever pay.

3860251,2017-04-21,1,h-vvpbPlzrR2KrjVvqBMrA,"Awful service. We showed up at 6:30pm for trivia night which lasts from 7pm until roughly 9pm. We ordered the nachos, a water for me and a $3 beer for my husband which we picked off a $3 beer menu the server showed us. Then trivia started. My husband placed an order for a burger. We never saw the server again for about 90 minutes. His food never came, we never got refills. She came over about 90 minutes later, we mentioned the burger never came and she just said ""Oh ok"". Literally did not see her for another hour. We had to go ti the bar to get our sodas refilled. Another hour goes by, no check, no refills, no sign of her, nothing. My husband went to find her to ask for our check. She charged us the burger she never brought! We told her and she took it off. Next she charged us $6 for the beer that was from the $3 menu! At this point, I was in a bad mood and confronted her about it.
Yes, there were 5 other tables with large parties and only she was working. It's ok to be slower, it's ok to be busy. What I couldn't stand is that she never apologized, never let us know she would be back when she could, just nothing. We were there from 6:30 until 10pm and saw her TWICE. Ridiculous.

Oh, they also charge full price for soda refills. So cheap. The nachos were not good either. Not a great portion. Only the top layer of chips had toppings, everything under was dry chips. The shredded pork was dry, they skimped out on sour cream and sauce. Nothing special. And my husband never got his food. We went to Fuku Burger after to finally get him some dinner. The menu is also very limited with only a few items to choose from. The nachos gave me a horrible piercing stomach ache right after eating them.

We only came here for the trivia, since the guy who hosts it stopped doing it at Nacho Daddy. I would never recommend this place or come again. They need to staff more servers on trivia nights when you expect more customers to come in. I do feel bad for the server for being so busy but all it would take is an apology and some type of responsibility and customers would be happy to wait for you to finish up to get to us.

Definitely skip this place.",TXZRWst2LMfaKRGF4DAxDA,2,0,1,G5FKceOCgSVW4oBJmIP4Kg

The food I had while here was amazing! I tried the nachos and tater tots and they were some of the best I've ever had. To be clear: I am somewhat of a nacho snob and usually when I want some quality nachos I'll head to Nacho Daddy but the nachos at this bar are absolutely fantastic - some of the best nachos around. The tater tots were also some of the best I've had anywhere and come with various delicious toppings. I haven't had the chance to try anything else but I'm extremely excited to go through their entire menu!

The Beers:

I'm not a beer connoisseur by any means but I like my beer to be cold and crisp and this place delivers. They have a decent selection of domestic and imported beers (30+ I believe) available which includes the most popular brands you'd expect and a few more esoteric selections as well!

The Service:

Full marks here. Servers were extremely attentive checking up on our table every few minutes. Nobody's glass ran empty and the food was delivered very quickly and with a smile. You can't ask for more.

Additionally I came here for GeeksWhoDrink trivia night on a Monday. I've been to a few bars for GWD trivia and I must say this was definitely the best trivia environment around. There is a separate events room adjacent to the bar which is quite large. I was able to hear all the trivia questions, music and movie clips clearly. The lighting was very good which also helps for the visual trivia round. The trivia host Michael is an awesome fun guy. I will definitely be visiting this place again for the food, the service, the drinks and the trivia.  I can't recommend this place enough!",CYccznHIW4f7dvy9jY1wPQ,0,0,5,prXEhtHuB5cstz3Kd_VzEw

We were the first ones in the smoke free back room and the waitress came by with menus. We ordered two appetizers, the wings with teriyaki sauce and the loaded tots. The sauce was so good that I asked if it was homemade and it was. The tots were so unusual because they had meat too. I only wish that they weren't smothered with so much cheese. What I liked best was the friendly staff and smoke free option. The music was great and the sound system was good but it was an off night so a small crowd. We will go back again.

I have had a few things on the menu so far, including the Classic Philly, ""Not From Philly"" Cheesesteak (which is essentially a regular Philly but they use an interesting dressing on the meat), and a New York steak.

Aubrey is a fantastic waitress, very sweet and such a little hottie. Tony runs the place, and he's awesome -- very chill but runs a tight ship.
