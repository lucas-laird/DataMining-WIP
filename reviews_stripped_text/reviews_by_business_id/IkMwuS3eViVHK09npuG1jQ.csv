1760587,2017-03-23,2,IkMwuS3eViVHK09npuG1jQ,"How can EPL open a new location and not babysit it long enough to get it off and running?  I was impressed that the old KFC location on Sahara, which sat vacant forever, finally got an overhaul and a tenant.  EPL seemed like a good option for the property. It also seemed like a fine opportunity to grab some food.

Ordered via drive-thru on 3/17 at 1:01pm and was sorely disappointed. My ordering went like this: Hi, I would like an order of the shrimp baja avocado tacos, please.  She asks, ""how many?""  One order, please.  She asks again, ""how many?""  One order, which I tell her it shows on the board contains two tacos.  ""Oh, okay.""  Duh, now I'm confused.

Once I get my one order of two tacos, I pull over and park.  Good thing because one of the tacos is so filled with special sauce which is dripping out either side of the taco. There is  shrimp perched on one corner and avocado on the opposite corner, with small stingy strips of cabbage in between. That was a hot mess to eat gracefully.  The other taco had the avocado plunked in the middle and shrimp on both sides, same stingy cabbage. Took a bite out of one end and had a hot-sauce laced shrimp escape out the other, falling between the seat and console.  It's funny now, but it wasn't then.  And to add insult to injury, it wasn't even tasty!

I'm not trying to compare EPL with an upscale eatery, just one location vs another seems fair to me. Well, it doesn't come close to the one at Decatur/Sahara or the one on Craig Road. Come on EPL, do something and fix what's broken!",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,1,0,1,T1-rrLN-nwKcapk5HK9UEQ

The wings aren't all fatty and nasty, you can actually eat all of it. Even if it's a little dry I don't mind since you can mix it with a bunch of stuff in a tortilla and can't really tell. Well this time I ordered on line right before they closed, and when I got home and bit into the wings they were so undercooked and disgusting, still pink inside I was grossed out. I could have gotten sick from that! The breasts were a little better, but definitely not the same quality as the other location. Nasty, I will never come back to this store again as I doubt they would have footed the hospital bill if I had gotten salmonella from that still-moving chicken I got.

Dayania Ortega picked up the phone and I let her know I was not happy.
She decided to lecture me saying I didn't order correctly and should have said the fried chicken tacos. I asked her if maybe the girl at the window should have asked and she told me no because they have such a large menu.

As she was lecturing me on how to correctly  order the ""Fried chicken tacos,"" I again pulled into drive thru and identified the Fried Chicken tacos as manager Ortega had told me according to proper procedure at El Pollo Loco.

After ordering the EXACT way she told me the window girl again said sorry we are out of those......""I said no the Fried Chicken Tacos"" and she said yes sir we are out of them! Are you F*#*ing kidding me??!!

To top it off Ms. Ortega got on the mic and said we can make them for you but it will be a wait!

This restaurant is the worse I have ever been too, which really sucks as when they get the food right it is good.

I am shocked that they are able to stay in business as this seems to be the norm at the Summerlin or just outside of Summerlin location.


No use complaining to Corporate Office as Ms. Ortega said it just comes back here anyway! LMFAO!
I am still in awe.....",FUY83VGV_Zg_gfJQLPzpWw,1,0,1,uT28IgcFcMiqPnKX5A6pKA

4220499,2017-08-15,0,IkMwuS3eViVHK09npuG1jQ,Last three times through the drive through.  Got home to find dry burnt chicken.  Takes a lot of determination to dry out dark meat.  Hate to see what they do to the white meat.  Cole slaw was stale.  Gravy was like water but that's my fault for ordering mashed potato and gravy at a Mexican place.  Very poor quality.  Maybe that's what they give the drive through guests.  Might give the good stuff at the counter.  Three strikes you're out.  Won't go back.,cEyMsQXRZdaeLopxVLSXQw,0,0,1,KhqHq1gRVKOsg04yYww7gg

Service is horrible, none of the orders have not been right. Went today decided to go in to save time and ensure my order was right. Got a 3 pc combo. 2 breast and thigh - 8.89 Cashier tried to charge me extra for the breast. Charging 10.69 fir the combo. Stating I had to pay fir the breast. Showed her on the menu. 3 pc. 2 breast, thigh, 2 small sides and small drink. Cashier then tells me the manager would have to help. Well if she was a manager or leader in any way it did not show today. I would say she was over promoted. She could told me I was paying for the drink, then the extra tho d breast. Which the drink was included and I did not order a third or extra breast. She opens the register gets the difference in cash and leaves it on the counter for me to pick up after assuming and asking if it was my change. Now here's the worst part manager did not check my order. Got back to the office and opened my combo to see 2 legs and a thigh. My sides were to be mash potatoes and broccoli. I got potatoes and corn. Not only did you over charge me you didn't even get the order right. Now I paid for a 3 pc breast and thigh and got 2 legs and thigh which would costed 6.89. I ask El pollo loco to give this team training and a manager to run the business correctly otherwise you just might be closing one of your newest doors due to loss of customers. FYI as I waited for the manager to TRY to correct Tony order each and every person son that was in line before a d after I (at least 7 customers) all came back to the counter as their orders were wrong. Manager did not take control or even coach her team to ensure it didn't keep happening. GET IT TOGETHER!!",Kge74ovhiNnRYZLEUujMKw,0,0,1,yG-uQuqrQhlP0AhseRaeUw

You would thing they would clean up the place by it really dirty inside.   I order a 3 taco meal and my taco was cold. So brought in up to the front  and the manager she told its supposed to be that way. I'm not idiot taco are not cold and it hurt my tooth. She went ahead and  give me a new one after she went to my table her remarks ""I hope that's warm enough for you"" she said it in a sarcastic way.  2nd thing as we were waiting for our meal I had to asked someone to clean the tables yea she did halfway done.

If I can give this review negative 5 stars, I would! Three times our family members been sick from eating El Pollo Loco. First was my mother in law. Few months later it was me. Then just a couple of days ago was my 2 year old!!!! This is the last straw. Having a two year old throw up non stop until she got rid of all the nasty food, was the scariest thing ever. After all the El Pollo Loco was gone, we fed her some clear liquid to try and hydrate her. Nope, nothing was staying down! She kept throwing up until 4 in the morning! The worst and scariest experience ever! So I really advise everyone, especially those who have little children to stay away from El Pollo Loco. Especially this location! Disgusting!!!

The first time they opened they had great food and quality but since then all dropped rapidly. Bad workers and bad quality and you get less. I always hoped it would get better but every single time it proved me wrong. I decided that the yesterday visit was my last. Ordered a Chicken Tostada and got a horrible taste of chicken and rice that tasted like nothing and was also hard. The tostada wasn't good either. Threw half of the food away. It's just not the money worth anymore.,NbhMH4XcHylnROs4oUlfSw,0,0,1,Sy0Ofb6q_mrQeftetZZ01A
