The first thing you notice about the restaurant is the location and atmosphere, right in Desert Shores on Jacqueline Lake, with a decor that is homey and sophisticated. The menu provides variety and intrigue: ""Merlot Poached Pear ""Tartare"" with Burrata"" - that was my appetizer, both creative and delicious - like starting the meal with dessert. We were a party of 4 and two of us ordered from the Harvest Menu, which is probably the best deal in Las Vegas. But as the meal progresses and food is served, each one is presented like a painting or piece of art - so visually appealing you really stop and admire the thought that went into the presentation - and then you taste it, and it does not disappoint. Every time I have eaten here I want to come back, next time I am trying the Brunch! I have no affiliation with this restaurant, I do live in the neighborhood and I hope this new and exciting place last for years to come, my hats is off to you Chef Stephen Blandino and I wish you much success!",U_HQ2cfbxgObohQoQIbvKw,1,1,5,FfepQAbwCO8S0XbdxmOLsw

Even after we explained to the waiter we were now short on time because it took so long to get the table we reserved, we still had to beg for everything. My boyfriend wanted the steak but prefers it well done. The waiter suggested he get the Kobe beef because it was a much thinner slice, but it would be a $35 up charge, on top of the $145 prefix menu price. He said ok. The steak still came out med rare. He just ate it. I got the wine pairing which ended up being about a 1/4 of a glass of white wine because I could never get anything else. We left without getting the desert that was part of the prefix menu we paid for because we couldn't wait any longer - even though we asked about 4 different staff members if we could please have it because we needed to leave.

Everything that was brought to us was delicious and since it was all you can eat for one price we were able to take advantage of our favorites.

The first time I went, my girlfriend and I shared their five course meal with the wine pairing and added on some appetizers from their happy hour menu. Everything was delicious and we were very happy with the meal. 

We recently went back but just for happy hour this time. We were slightly disappointed the happy hour menu had changed, but the new one is just as good. Rather than happy hour specific menu items, they offer some items from their regular menu at half price. Some of the drinks are half price as well. My girlfriend had a couple martinis and I went with a beer. We had the Shiso Crusted Yellowtail, New England Clam Ravioli, and the Grilled Filet Mignon. 

Everything was really good and the service was great. Their menus are seasonal so you may want to check what they have before you go expecting to have your favorite dish again.",9p-U4dzWDBWZctPwXH1ODw,0,0,5,XzoE0Np5-LdhtH0EMdOKuw
395575,2017-02-14,0,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"Late review! :( 
I have been dying to come to Americana for a couple months now (basically since they opened) and we thought, what better time than our nine year anniversary to go?! 
We had a reservation for 4:45 and arrived to a beautiful restaurant. They really did a great job with decor here; it was nice and open, the huge windows lakeside made for a good view no matter where you sit. 
Being the first people there, I'd say we got the best table. :P 
Our server, I hate that I don't remember his name, had a great personality and really explained all we needed to know about the menu and cocktails; CRAZY knowledgable. He also gave us some of his recommendations and helped my boyfriend pick out a nice scotch (I think thats what it was), I got an Americana smash. He perfectly timed our courses and honestly never missed a beat. 
Now the food. Oh god, the food. If I died after my meal, I would have been happy. We started with the poached pear salad... my boyfriend had no idea what he was eating for a good majority of the time. Haha. Its like nothing I have EVER had and it was spectacular. The rosé gelée, prosciutto, and creamy burrata... how could you go wrong? 
For entrees, my partner got the venison (did not know it was deer, but hey!) and I chose the filet. I do not regret my choices; the sweet potato puree, the crispy brussels sprouts and the sauce (can't remember what it was) complimenting each other so well and ensuring that it literally looked like I licked my plate. There was NOTHING left. 
We skipped dessert seeing as we were full to our eyeballs in champagne and food, they still brought out banana and lavender macarons. I am not a fan of lavender, but the texture was absolutely perfect on these babies. 
The owner/chef, I believe, was there when we left. He asked how the food was.. my response? ""AMAZING!!"" And I still feel like that doesn't do it justice. I will be back, again and again. I am so happy this place opened in my neighborhood, its a keeper.",KbAshmF0iFNkk_6feVOXRQ,1,1,5,QPa06hUanm3_oHWgQWIiQA

It was really a beautiful setting and the food and service only made the whole experience better. The ""unlimited brunch"" is $42 a person and there are probably 15-20 dishes on the menu (maybe more). They are dishes to share. Our waiter started us out with a Caesar salad and a wedge and then we went to mussels, potato skins, shrimp and grits, eggs Benedict and on and on until we had crepes and parfaits for dessert. Everything was delicious and plentiful. And we could have kept going if we weren't so stuffed. There were several dishes we didn't try but could have. This brunch is a wonderful value and a great place to bring out of town guests. They will be amazed at this beautiful place on a lake",ifv3qpCPnSPReEoL547TVA,0,0,5,4o9AhpNKzYgMf6hWVCXSRA

Not to mention the setting on the lake is fantastic.  Why it's not getting the attention from the local food magazines and food critics is crazy. But I'm sure it will soon.

When we made the reservation, we indicated we were celebrating and anniversary. 8 years. I was a tad disappointed they didn't mention the occasion when we arrived, or at all. I figure if a business asks whether it's a special occasion, they do it to acknowledge it later. But, no biggie. It didn't take a single thing away from the dining experience. We didn't request a table by the window (which you MUST because the views are lovely) but the staff had a table cleared for us while we waited so I was very happy about that. The staff was truly 5 star. Very attentive and my water glass was never empty. 

We started with champagne (yum) and the golden egg app. I didn't love it. It would have been better with fresh priscutto rather than smoked. 

For dinner, I had the scallop which were cooked perfectly and the risotto was creamy and delicious. The BF had the short rib. The portion was surprisingly huge and meat was so tender yet bursting with flavor. Loved it. 

For dessert we shared the peanut butter chocolate pie. This was probably one of the most indulgent and delicious desserts I've ever had.

1081125,2017-04-16,2,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"I decided to visit this place with three other friends on a Wednesday or Thursday a few weeks ago. Let me just get straight to the point: the food, drinks, and table service were impeccable. We had water and bread immediately (it was a little busy, but the two people in black shirts seemed very calm) and our server quickly followed up with our drink order. We decided to skip appetizers and went straight for the good stuff. I ordered the smoked venison, and my friends all ordered short ribs. Our drinks were marvelous as well (can't recall the bartender's name, but I think it started with an 'N'). Anyway, no complaints on those fronts. 

However, our night turned sour when we overheard who we thought was an angry guest absolutely ripping into one of the employees there. I turned to see who was speaking so aggressively, and it was a short woman with brown/blonde hair pretty much yelling at one of the employees. We couldn't quite understand what she was saying, but she was loud enough to interrupt our conversation and we even noticed the table next to us turning to see what was going on. She later put on a fake smile and introduced herself as the General Manager, to which we all gasped. How could a General Manager speak to one of their employees that way? After she left, we managed to pull the employee (he was one of the two people wearing a black shirt) aside and ask what that was all about. He simply said she was upset because she had to help run food. We were flabbergasted and just said, ""Wow"". HE apologized for HER interruption, and asked if we needed anything else. Her behavior was offensive enough to take this review from potentially five stars to two stars.

We learned three things from our visit to Americana: the food and service are great, the ambience is great, and their gm needs to take either some interpersonal relations classes, stress management classes, or both. Because we certainly wouldn't want to work there.",U0gKAwJzUGElfKAJyQGhVA,2,0,2,LbwpRDCA3zwBPjIvr5eN_w

Yes, the atmosphere & view are great.  Yes, the food is delicious.  What puts Americana above the rest is the care & personal attention the owner & his staff show each plate & guest.

I have now had 4 meals at Americana.  Each time we walk away, not only are our palettes thoroughly satisfied, but it's as if we've made new friends who make sure you're happy to have come by.  The owner & his staff attended to every high maintenance request with a smile on their faces.  

Back to the food.  If you like wedge salads, you have to try the one with jalapeño bacon.  The wagyu beef is tender & cooked to perfection.  My wife & I split a big piece & they cooked each side separately & differently to accommodate our desires.  Macaroons for desert was the perfect sweet, yet light, compliment to the hearty meal.  Look for appetizer specials that are just superb.  I believe it was wagyu stuffed with tuna last time there.  A diners delight.  The lamb chops are a spectacle to behold as well, and finger licking good!

Cannot say enough about the atmosphere created by the staff.  Now with a great bar area to eat or drink at.  Happy hours, live music & oyster Tuesdays, there's something for everyone here.

The romantic ambiance of the restaurant was perfect for the occasion, from the lighting to the soft music playing. Once we arrived, we were seated right away.  I'm glad I made our reservation when it was still light outside cause the view of Lake Jacqueline was so breathtaking and relaxing. You forget for a moment that you're in the middle of the desert.  They even gave us a handwritten note wishing us a Happy Anniversary which I thought was a nice personal touch.

Our server, I forget his name, was amazing and provided us with great customer service. So great in fact, that he even walked the husband to the bathroom when he asked where it was. The husband was actually blown away with just that alone. 

Now for the food...we highly recommend the oysters for starters. They serve the oysters with caviar which is different than what the husband is used to, but definitely a winner. I'm not much of an oyster person , but I love how it didn't have that sea taste. For the main course, I decided to go with the scallops and I thought they were cooked to perfection. The Mac n cheese on the other hand, was too heavy in my opinion.  At the end, we were surprised with cheesecake and sorbet, courtesy of Americana which was a nice ending to our meal.

All in all, I definitely recommend Americana especially if you're celebrating a special occasion.  They make your experience memorable with the little things that they do.  I also recommend getting there when it's still light out so you can enjoy the nice view of the lake and forget that you're in the middle of the desert, even for a little bit ;)",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,8,7,5,j0GcNMMonWvSEK3S3asgDg

The truffled salad was excellent as a starter and I recommend it if you're a truffle lover. I decided on the sable fish for my main course with clams and cannellini beans, I highly recommend it. The hubby had the salmon with leeks, mushrooms and potatoes but I enjoyed my entree better than I did his.

Things you might want to know about Americana:

Amazing view and a patio on the lake.

The type of place you can dress up for date night, or go casual, and you're not going to feel awkward either way.

GREAT daily happy hour (I believe it's 4-7pm, besides Monday when they're closed) at the bar. I don't know where else has cocktails/wine, salmon, filet mignon, or octopus on their happy hour, but this place does. 

Tuesdays they do dollar oysters, rockefeller or raw, and they're delicious. Coming from the PNW I'm a bit of an oyster snob, but they get the stamp of approval here. 

The rotating weekly Harvest Menu includes 3 delicious courses and unlimited wine parings for like... $42? Amazing. 

Sunday brunch. I have yet to try it myself but I have heard nothing but incredible things from friends and coworkers.

They offer a monthly cooking class and wine tastings. I have been meaning to go to one but schedules never seem to work out. A friend has gone to several and again, heard nothing but great things.

I've tried about half the menu so far, some of my favorites are...

Octopus. SO good, the perfect small kick of spice in the sauce, and super tender. I order this at least once a week. 

Beet salad. I don't even like beets but I like this salad. The presentation is gorgeous and the creamy cheese is perfection. 

Salmon. A great option if you're wanting something lighter. It comes on a bed of delicious veggies instead of carbs. Every time I've ordered it's been cooked perfectly and super moist. Nothing worse than dry salmon. 

Scallops. Hands down one of the best scallop dishes I've had. The type of dish you eat extra slow in small bites to make it last longer. 

Filet. Obviously top quality beef. Always tender and cooked exactly how I order. 

Crispy chicken. Delicious, and you won't feel like you're missing out eating chicken by ordering this. Never dry, the only thing worse than dry chicken might be.... dry salmon?

Cheesecake. Generally cheesecake isn't my go-to dessert, but this one has a crunchy creme brulee type top on it....",BRabX88bM_YSPcdF_Qy0hg,1,0,5,7q92611aqT9gS_oBtzJQJg

The location and scenery was the only upside to our visit, because our pictures turned out great, but that was it. There weren't many options on the menu; the restaurant did not inform us of the shortened menu options for the mother's days special when we made our reservation. Then they sprung on us that we all had to buy the $75 package including appetizer, entree, and desert for each person. Thankfully they didn't make us buy the whole package after speaking with the manager, so we were able to order entrees separately. 
Birthday girl and I ordered a mojito and it was terrible, We sent them back and ordered a Long Island, and it was like there was no alcohol in it, sent that back as well and stuck to water for the night. The manager on duty made one effort to make things right with our drinks but once I was displeased with the second drink he gave up on us and we didn't see him for the rest of the night... Even though we were practically the only people there.
Being that they only had 3 entree options, you would think the food wouldn't take so long, wrong. Our 6 entrees took over 45 minutes to teach the table, only to be disappointed. The salmon tasted watered down, and the entrees came with no sides, and there wasn't an option on the menu to add any sides. The restaurant wasn't busy as well, it was our party and probably 3 other small tables.
Our server was barely present but since we had a group of 6, gratuity was included on the bill by default.
I will say the other servers did a great job of checking on us and filling our waters or helping clear the tables, but our actual server wasn't very enthusiastic about serving us for my friends 21st birthday.
Then to top it all off, they brought out a small desert to celebrate my friends birthday, which was very thoughtful, but the handwriting of the happy birthday on the plate looked like a 5 year old wrote it. It was like they did it because we expected them to not because they sincerely wanted to help us celebrate. 
We wanted to speak to the manager but didn't want to seem like we were trying to get out of our bill, so we paid our very expensive bill and left.",pxeDBAYTOEQGD-DCUvfg0g,0,0,1,t1k0ftooQLqWBrvDG9P1qQ

1503547,2017-04-04,11,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"Romantic, secluded location on Lake Jacqueline plus fantastic flavors and plating plus attentive service equals a pretty and phenomenal dining experience at Americana. The menu spans steakhouse classics and fresh seafood, with innovative seasonal appetizers. 

I highly recommend the tasting menu- $85/pp for 5 courses allows you to taste several of their best dishes; adding on the $25 wine pairing is an excellent choice too. Our server let us know that one person can order the tasting menu without the whole table being required to participate, which I appreciate. My guy opted for separate dishes.

Oyster amuse was fresh and briny, paired well with a prosecco. The pear and proscuitto salad was light with a great, sweet dressing. The Japanese Kampachi sashimi was some of the best I've had, with a great presentation (that I unfortunately didn't get a photo of!) of citrus, ponzu sauce, and super-fresh fish, similar to yellowtail or amberjack. The pair of Nantucket scallops with truffle risotto and carrot puree was fresh and understated, paired well with a chardonnay. Smoked venison tenderloin was the highlight, served in a covered dish trapping the smoke inside and paired with a robust California cab.  Good portion size, great flavor in the meat. The chocolate-peanut butter dessert bar was also a winner, reminiscent of something I might find at Yonaka, another favorite date night spot. $110 for the meal and pairing was a great value, and one I'll be coming back for seasonally as the menu changes.

My guy opted for the Golden Truffle Egg Salad, which was as tasty as it was difficult to photograph. The nutty dressing and cured ham harmonized nicely with the truffle accents and fresh produce. The parsnip soup was velvety-smooth with beet accents. The Crispy-Skinned Petaluma Chicken was a great dish, perfectly crispy and flavorful skin. I really enjoyed the potatoes this is served with, too. We added on a cappuccino and the lemon tart dessert at the suggestion of our server- the tartness of the pastry and the bold coffee went well together, good ending to our dining experience. We were additionally surprised by complementary macarons, which were a great mocha flavor. 

Service throughout was attentive without being stuffy. Though the food quality and ambiance are upscale, there's also a more laid back vibe that I enjoyed. I am looking forward to visiting again with friends for brunch, and seasonally to treat ourselves to Chef Blandino's dishes for a great date night.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,18,5,IAncWJTYuJOKyXlAU2DvFQ

1935614,2017-05-15,0,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"This place was opened in November 2016. After reading the good reviews by fellow yelpers, we decided to try this out for their Mother's Day Brunch. 

First, this is at a wonderful location overlooking a lake. The decor and setting are very pleasant. 

The food for Mother's Day brunch was excellent. Their Mother's Day Brunch menu consists of an unlimited tapas like dishes offering along with a carving station. There were three of us and we ordered many, many dishes. The only dish that I found somewhat objectionable was their artichoke soup - not hot enough and not tasty enough. Other than that, every dish that we ordered was excellent. 

Portions and plating of each dish varied from the first order to the second order.
Overheard some one mentioned that they have run out of clean dishes and thus the variation.
Still I don't understand that our first Shrimp and Grits had three huge shrimp and the second one only two shrimp. ??  

The wait staff was friendly and tried very hard to please. However, they were totally dis-organized. It made no sense that they had to run back to the kitchen to get clean dishes - instead of having a wait station where all the supplies are easily accessible. 

The carving station was not laid out appetizingly. The deserts were very good but only limited variety  - most of them were in plastic cups. 
 
Based on food, this is at least a four plus star restaurant. Based on service, a three star. 

I have enjoyed the food and wish them well. Hopefully, they can make improvements soon.

10/5/17:  Revisited this restaurant yesterday for dinner. 
The place is still beautiful, very quiet, by the lakeside. Extremely pleasant to share a nice quiet dinner with yours. 

There were three of us, we ordered grilled Octopus, Brentwood Corn Chowder and Compressed watermelon for appetizer. For entries, we ordered NY Steakwith crab legs, Scallops. For side orders, we ordered Crab fried rice and sauteed spinach. 

All the dishes are beautifully plated. Unfortunately, I cannot use the adjective ""Delicious"" to describe any of the dishes. Nothing there to wow us. Although none of the dishes is terribly done that we have to return it. But then, for this pricing, for this ambiance, it is certainly quite a disappointment. 

For the Brunch buffet that we visited in May this year, it is very worthy of a 4 star. 
For our latest dinner, a 3 star is just about it.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,1,0,3,A8o7riNXw8_lWcwHkzYjFA

Trying to get someone to come for your table for anything seems like you are burdening the staff. They need to figure things out with the waiters or they are going to loose a lot of customers.,y8FKN2hhrb1iW6BMtthiiw,0,0,3,ZftKQWfKxpRRTyZv0hKmZQ

My wife and I were driving by the Lakes and saw the banner, Voted ""Best Fine Dining Restaurant"" in Las Vegas and decided to try it and we loved it, the view, the decor, (a baby grand had just been delivered) But most of all the food and wine! We've been lucky to eat at some of the best restaurants in Vegas and the world, through all our travels but this is now our favourite!  The starter... Gold Egg Salad with truffles, amazingly good and original,  you must try it. My wife enjoyed her Scallops and Risotto, still talking about it. I was able to order off menu and had the best ever Smoked Venison! Brought out by owner,  Chef Stephen Blandino. Plated under  a glass covered top, full of SMOKE!!! The whiskey n port reduction sauce made to perfection. Wine list was top notch! 

What a dinner! Some fine dining restaurants are too much,  too fancy, too expensive, too crowded.  This was a very comfortable and enjoyable evening, hurry before the rest of Las Vegas crowds in.",VgHg1zgrvCybuZ3OymcVqA,2,1,5,rUXLWgoh4oHq6jOLDzpYBA

Americana now inhabits the corner space that Garfield's and Isabela's previously occupied. Americana is the best restaurant to try and establish itself here, and hopefully they succeed in this location that is lacking in the way of visibility from a busy street. Once inside, the space unfolds and guests are able to enjoy pleasing views of Lake Jacqueline from both the romantic dining room as well as the lakeside patio, when weather permits. 

I always appreciated this space for the ambiance, but now that Americana has taken over the food is an equal or better reason to venture out to Desert Shores for a nice meal. My love and I took the opportunity to share one entree and several appetizers in order to experience more of the menu. We enjoyed: 

Duo of Kumamoto Oysters 
Japanese Kampachi Sashmi
Octopus ala Palncha
Nantucket Scallops
Forged Mushroom Ravioli

Each one of these dishes was very good. Every dish respectively a strong 4 stars on its own. My favorites were the Forged Mushroom Ravioli and Nantucket Scallops...though I'm a sucker for scallops. The ravioli was earthy and warming--inviting me in for another bite again and again. The tomato foam was delicate and quickly fell after reaching the table, but the flavors remained and provided a wonderful topping to the mushroom and cream of the raviolis. I wouldn't argue with anyone giving Americana 5 Stars. If the rest of the menu is as strong as these five items I would feel required to change my rating...assuming that that they iron-out some of the minor service issues we encountered at the start of our meal.

We will return to explore more of the menu. If you decide to find your way in, be sure to make a reservation ahead of time and request a window seat...assuming you're into the whole dinning with a view kind of thing.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,31,27,4,ZB1MxtpVgRldMIkjAUofqw

They have all you can eat Tapas for $42. However some dishes are extra if you want meat.
$42 does not include drinks. 
Service is adequate but when made special requests on dishes they got them wrong every time.  No big deal, we just returned to Dish.

Had questions about different menu items and staff didn't know the answers, or gave the wrong answer.

When you have all you can eat tapas it requires the waiters to come to your table 7 - 8 times per meal. They are not properly staffed to provide this level of service when the restaurant gets busy.

There are no other options for brunch besides the $42 all you can eat option. I would have liked to just have one dish, but was disappointed that I couldn't do that.

First, we arrived on time, but it took 30 minutes to set us in spite of reservations. The staff looked cautiously nice, like someone was going to jump out of that haunted-looking bar with a meat cleaver. 

When we made it to our table, service was slow. The first bites we had arrived on our table were ""baked"" rigatoni (a pasta you def should not bake FFS) and it was plain nasty. So we thought, ""Okay, maybe this isn't their best."" Then they brought out some basic AF mac n cheese that looked like it had bacon bits on it and some mediocre iceberg lettuce salad with blue cheese crumbles. 

The seafood and meat were also mediocre. Meat from the carving station? Cold and tasteless. McDonald's serves better quality beef. The ""ceviche"" barely had any actual citrus in it and was old and fishy smelling for what should be marinated. The desserts were embarrassingly sloppy and basic. The brut? Tasted like grass. How the **** do you screw up sparkling wine?! How?!

While the staff seemed well-meaning, they also seemed blissfully unaware with how garbage this whole experience was. The fact that we dropped $200+ here for brunch for a place that seems like a crap country club from the Cold War era made me actually want fast food after to wash the taste of mediocrity out of my mouth.

My love and I were on time for our reservation and promptly seated upon arrival. The dinning room floor has quite a view of Lake Jacqueline that enhances the mood of the ambiance.

We shared
-Duo of Kumamoto Oysters 
  w/ finger lime gelee, Sarano, cilantro seedlings
  w/ naked cider mignonette 
-Japanese Kampachi Sashmi
- Octopuse ala Palncha
- Nantucket Scallops
-Forged Mushroom Ravioli 

Americana's Chef is from Charlie Palmer at the Four Seasons Las Vegas...allow me to say that the items he creates satisfy deliciously all the senses...visually appealing and equally tasty dishes such as the sashimi dressed freshly with avocado pearls, cara cara orange, and ponzu presented on top of chop sticks for table-side-sliding service...octopus, tender and juicy with celery root, cilantro, and poblano pepper...scallops that shined the brightest with black truffle risotto, carrot purée, and chive...ravioli with shaved button & black trumpet mushrooms. We enjoyed all the dishes and definitely would like to come back to try more dishes.

Our server Rick was pleasant and attentive. His service was well-balanced with Americana's nature as an upscale-neighborhood restaurant.

We enjoyed our time here so much that towards the end of our meal I told my love that Americana is easily the best dinning option in this immediate area...and are that includes a prominent French & Wine establishment that I have enjoyed in the past. Needless to say, Americana is certainly worth checking out.

I booked the reservation through ""Open Table"" and for once they restaurant received the notes we made through the app. 
We were welcomed immediately and once we checked in wished a happy anniversary. We had a table looking out over the water with the staff being attentive and friendly. We had some great recommendations from our waiter (Marcin) which turned out to be terrific. Our meal was fantastic and beautifully presented. 
I had the short ribs, the wife had the scallops and shrimp; along with the crab fried rice and spicy broccolini. The Chef sent out a complimentary desert (Lemon tart) which was a great finish to a wonderful meal.

After experiencing their Sunday brunch, I can honestly say this was THE BEST restaurant experience I've ever had in my five years in Vegas... In fact, it may be the best I've ever had, period. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and just the right mix of helpful but not hovering. The food was absolutely phenomenal... I found myself going back for seconds on things I normally don't even like in other settings. I didn't have a single thing that I didn't love, and we made it at least 3/4 of the way through the creative pairings on the brunch menu. I'm from the south, but I've never had such delicious chicken and waffles in my life! Even though the price seems a little expensive at first, it is WELL worth it considering the quality of the food, the presentation, the ambience, and the fact that the menu is unlimited. I am newly obsessed with the idea of brunch tapas... It's perfect for those things you know you want to try but you'd never be able to eat a whole plate of (I'm looking at you, French toast).

3284496,2018-05-20,1,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"Having lived in OC and the bay area, I was pretty let down by Vegas fine dining (CUT by Wolfgang Puck, Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Olives, etc). Most fine dining restaurants restaurants that I have been to have been decently good but not worth how much they are charging; however, this feeling changed after coming here. I want to go out on a limb and say that this is probably the best all around fine dining restaurant I've been to in the area (food, ambiance, service, price). 

The service I received, from the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, was on par with some of the nicest restaurants I've ever been to. Our glass was constantly being filled and we had multiple waiters checking in on us all the time. They were very good about paying attention to the details that most restaurants do not even consider. 

The view of the lake was amazing and it helped pass the time between the appetizer, main course, and dessert. It really helps set a nice mood in the restaurant. 

We ordered the Grilled Octopus, Nantucket scallops, and Japanese A5 wagyu. The grilled octopus was something nice to try but I can probably do without it next time. The nantucket scallops were very juicy, had a nice sear, and were seasoned perfectly. The Japanese A5 was SO DAMN GOOD! I have had wagyu at other places but I would say this is one of the better ones. 

The patrons at this restaurant are also super nice. During my meal, one of the regulars (Freddy) at the table next to us ordered a crazy looking drink that came in it's own special case with smoke in it. I was so curious I had to ask him what it was. We got to talking a bit and I found out that the drink was around $200. I was so started that I ended the conversation short and got back to my dinner. While I was eating the waiter brought over that same exact drink for me because the guy had ordered one for me. WHAT?! Totally made my night. 

I have to say that this restaurant is a gem. They have some of the best food I have tried in the Vegas area and they have the best view & service to go along with it. This place is now my go to spot from here on out.",swqSj4zuamI_HFfPTj63Hg,2,1,5,WsnFQ8w2-yXIxc-I-8pdzg
3332553,2017-06-03,0,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

I enjoyed every dish at Americana. From the gold egg salad to the halibut to the chicken. To begin, the egg salad had a remarkable presentation with a bed of spinach muddled with an edible golden egg. Very unique dish, with included bread in the middle and truffle shavings to top it off. The halibut was a little dry but perfect when dipped in the accompanied sauce. The chicken was perfect with a crunchy skin and 3 different dipping sauces to compliment the meat. Each entree came on top of a few veggies to green it up. The wine prices can get up there but there's definitely affordable options as well. Beware the upsell though as our waiter kept trying to push us when one wine we picked was no longer available; this gets old after a while. 

The venue is great overlooking the lake. It can get a little buggy at night but still beautiful. The waiters are actually quite good but it's a deceptively big restaurant so they can get lost in the mix depending on which tables they're treating. The bread to begin was a little weak and we were not given macaroons with our check which I thought were complimentary with the check, but other than that a nice weekend meal. Our food portion was about $85 for the entrees and shared appetizer which is pretty solid for the quality. The menu is pretty small as I assume they specialize so you really can't go wrong in whatever you order.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,mi7M_NAn0UfIKe16lzYGug

The restaurant overlooks the lakes, so try to get seatings by the window or outside when the weather permits. Lunch entrée starts at $14, so it's quite reasonable for the quality you get. They give a complimentary bread basket (love the olive bread) with your meal.

My friend and I shared the grilled octopus (it's on the dinner menu) for an appetizer. The dish had pork sausages and fingerling potatoes. The octopus was cooked perfectly and was very tender. The sausages were flavorful. A definite thumbs up!

For my entrée, I ordered the cheddar crusted braised beef short rib. The short rib was so good with melted in your mouth kind of meat. It was served with potato puree (so smooth and creamy!) and sauteed rainbow carrots and mushrooms. I didn't think the cheddar added anything to the dish, but I, for one, would not refuse any addition of cheese on my plate lol. My friend had their crispy chicken breast with smashed potatoes. She enjoyed her dish so much that she polished off her plate :)

The restaurant has great atmosphere. It's sophisticated without being stuffy. Food presentation is top notch. Service is great. It will make great place for a romantic dinner date. I can't wait to return and try their happy hour and dinner menus.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,2,1,4,GXKzkpSUGgociDBrljvzrg

When we arrived, the view was very pretty (probably the only good thing about this place). When we were seated I opened the menu that only gave us one option which was a 3 course meal for Mother's Day, $75 a person. When I initially called and made the reservation a week in advance I was not told that they wouldn't have a regular menu, I should have been notified that the options would be limited. We asked the waiter if it was possible to just choose an entree and he told us no, that it came as a package. I told him to ask a manager due to the fact that I wasn't told about the menu. They finally agreed. Some of my party ordered the crispy chicken and some ordered the salmon. The food took an hour to come out and it was not very good anyway. It was very unseasoned and it was JUST a piece of meat and some sauce for $36. No sides or anything. We asked for salt and pepper and they had none. After this, a waiter came out and asked if I was celebrating a birthday. I replied yes and he said that they'd do something special for me. They brought out a dessert and sang to me, which would have been nice had they put some effort into the presentation. The handwriting looked like a 3 year old did it and there were smudges of chocolate all over. On top of all of this, although we did sit outside, a lamp was placed right by the table that attracted bugs from the light. Because of this we had bugs all over the table, in the food and in our drinks. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Terrible food, service and experience overall.

We visited last night to celebrate a work milestone. We wanted something with delicious food that was a little 'over the top' - the type worthy of a celebration. The other places we considered were Le Cirque, Picasso, Raku and Andiamo's but agreed on Americana after reviewing the menu and seeing some pictures of the dining area. 

Started in the bar with a couple of cocktails. Happy to see they served Blanton's bourbon which can be hard to come by in Vegas. Once seated we ordered appetizers- grilled octopus, Pacific coast oysters and burrata. All were delicious and had a unique take on them. Also had the Australian waygu, the Japanese waygu (served table-side) and king crab. The steaks were literally like butter and they were cooked perfectly. The crab was the best thing all night- served in this other-worldly sauce with grapefruit. I mean who would think to serve warm crab with grapefruit?!? And it worked amazing. Finished with brûlée-d cheesecake and complimentary macaroons. Amazing finish. 

Service was impeccable. Atmosphere was unique and fun. This was a great change to the standard neighborhood restaurants we typically visit. If you visit Americana, you will get a Vegas Strip restaurant experience for a fraction of the price since you aren't paying for the fancy chef name on the restaurant.

It's not the setting-romantic overlooking a man-made lake with you seated almost on its banks.

It's those damn distracting lights.  The strings of bright little lights are very nice.  The problem is they've gone overboard and use many pulsating, and flashing lights.  I swear they could to trigger a seizure in a susceptible person.  They're just plain annoying and are best used in a strip club or perhaps a disco.  The saying of Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe from almost 70 years ago still applies, ""Less is more.""

This was my favorite place that I dined out in Vegas during my stay. What an amazing dining experience in regard to the combination of professional service and great food. The setting and ambiance was sophisticated yet relaxing with a peaceful view into a lake seeing the ducks glide onto the water. The interior was super clean, simple and inviting. Service from our server Marcin (Or as I called him ""Marc Boogie"" LOL) was exceptional, right down to his phenomenal attention to detail. Food was exquisite with balance of taste, colors and textures. Thank you Mr. Stephen Blandino (Owner/Chef) and your staff for an unforgettable dining experience. This will definitely be the first of future visits when I visit Vegas. Marcin you should never have given me your card with your email and cell phone. I will be staking you for that Chicken and cake again lol. I would definitely recommend this amazing professional inviting establishment to all my friends and family without a doubt.

My ratings below:

1. Pan Roasted Australian Seabass (5 out of 5 stars). I loved this entree and the preparation. Very well seasoned and was not over done so you still captured the freshness of the fish. It was made perfectly, crunchy on the skin and tender inside with perfect balance and the sauce it came in was spectacular !! 

2. Duo Of Kumamato Oysters (3.5 out of 5 stars). The only thing i had that was not Flawless. It lacked flavor and you could barely taste the caviar. That being said it was still pretty good.

3. Macaroons (5 out of 5 stars). Marcin hooked us up with complementary Macaroons. Perfection is all I can say. It was so delicious. Definitely will get that again. 

4. Crispy Skinned Petaluma Chicken (5 out of 5 stars). This was arguably the entree I loved the most. The flavor of the chicken was flawless, and that crispy skin gave it that extra crunch taste that made it mind blowing. I have never tasted chicken prepared this way before which was a life altering experience lol I begged Marcin to tell me the secret so I could try and make it at home. (True Story)

5. Foraged Mushroom Ravioli (4.5 out of 5 stars). Everything was perfect but the ravioli itself could have been cooked a tad bit longer. Other than that it was perfect.  

6. Creamy Kale without bacon (5 out of 5 stars). well seasoned and tasted fantastic.

We made our order and shortly after, the fresh bread were delivered with a butter spread. The bread was perfect.

For drinks- We had Champayne and Roos Smoked Old Fashion Bourbon. 

For meals, we got the Grilled Octopus, Lamb Chops, Crab Fried Rice and Rainbow Trout. 

WOW! everything was unbeliveably tasty.   The octopus was cooked absolutely perfect and the potatoes that came with it was crispy and delish. The Rainbow Trout was not fishy, my bf thought it would be fishy for me before I ordered. It was so fresh and the fish skin was crispy just the way I like it. The Lamb Chop were ordered medium rare and had an amazing flavor.

Lastly we decided to split Chocolate Peanut Bar. It was one of the best desert I have had. They even brought us a complimentary Raspberry Macaroons. Awesome treat end to an incredible meal.

The service was top notch, and all the staff are attentive and friendly.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,5,4,5,CbgDYD5MqnIIE1pgihBBMw

3580234,2017-09-04,0,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"Something amazing happened to us at Americana today. We have been to Americana a couple times in the past. First for brunch. We had been at the location with the previous restaurant and loved the location. The brunch was such a good experience that I chose it for my birthday dinner which was amazing as well. This place had the hat trick. Great food, Great Service and Great atmosphere. For me Food and Service are a must. If you have great food and the service ruins my experience then I'm done. 

So we decided to hit Brunch for the holiday weekend. We were hoping to sit outside but still a little too hot. Instead we had great window seating with the great view. We had the same waiter that we had before so all was looking good. Then things went to hell. I ordered the bottomless mimosas and we got our firs course. Had trouble getting my second mimosa. When the third coarse was finished and my bottomless mimosa was sitting bottled out, we were getting upset with the service. It's all you can eat and bottomless mimosas and we have no food and an empty glass. I try to be understanding and they had three big parties but still it isn't a cheap place and I'm having a bad dining experience. 

This is when something amazing happened. They actually recognized there was a problem and fixe it. The Chef/Owner came to are table chatted and recommended a dish which he said he would send out. He had my mimosa refilled as well. When the dish was ready he personally brought it to the table. That did impress me. Then he came back and talked to us about our next choice as well. Then I notice he is serving the tables beside us as well. 

I was amazed. I have been many times in a restaurant  that had problems but never seen if fixe in stride. The owner saw the problem and solved it by personally serving several tables. We went from having a bad experience that would keep us from coming back the Americana remains as my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",PeKqZ414yF7WuKfqbpOlAg,2,1,5,Ohak6k46IoXHpayyHJxlww
3581870,2017-05-05,2,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"Run, don't walk to Americana!!

This hidden little gem tucked in Desert Shores served me and my partner one of the best meals I have ever had in Las Vegas and as a born and raised local who has dined at many different restaurants, including those on the strip, I think the weight of that claim is pretty substantial.

We had such a wonderful experience at this beautiful and incredibly quiet and secluded restaurant. A true luxury when it comes to dining in Vegas was the tranquility of being right on the water and not having the loud street traffic or scenery of other buildings around. It's something I did not realize I appreciated so much while dining but quickly learned to appreciate as I sat at Americana. 

We walked in and were greeted promptly by Chef Blandino who was friendly and eager to tell us more about his restaurant and the extraordinary menu he has to offer his guests. We were immediately excited to try things out and the hostess seated us promptly.

The main dining room is elegantly decorated with large bay windows overlooking the lake, dazzling chandeliers and a clean and open space with white table cloths and candlelight. We were attended to by a busser, server and food runner while dining and each of them were equally attentive and friendly. 

Marcin was our delightful server who explained in detail featured menu items, some of his personal favorites and great wine and cocktail suggestions for our food. He was charming and easy going, not at all over bearing and attentive to our dining needs. We loved having him and I would recommend requesting a seat in his section.

We started with the grilled Octopus and prosciutto wrapped romaine hearts. Both dishes were full of fresh ingredients, savory flavors and different textures to please the palate. The Caesar dressing on the salad was likely the best I have ever had and the portion was very large. Served with homemade sourdough croutons and freshly grated Parmesan. The Octopus was incredibly tender from first cooking it sous-vide and then had a nice char and crunch from the grill. It's served with thin slices of crispy fingerling potatoes, celery root puree and poblano pepper sauce all complimenting this dish well. We practically licked the plate and agreed that this was one of our favorite dishes.

We also ordered the Japanese Kagoshima Waygu and the Charred New York Strip. I have to say the Waygu was one of the best I have had. Perfectly tender, cooked and seasoned slices of beef served on top of what I believe were nameko mushrooms and a savory sauce. Another must try at Americana and at such a great price it is worth ordering! The New York strip was also tasty, cooked a nice medium rare and seasoned well. It was served with bone marrow that had a very rich flavor along side some vegetables and a creamy potato mash.

We were also lucky enough to try some delicate lobster ravioli in a rich cream sauce that tasted like lobster bisque served with morel mushrooms and English peas. The homemade pasta was an flawless al dente and filled with large purist portions of sweet lobster. I can't express enough love for the sauce it came with and I wanted to ask for a spoon so none of it went to waste. 

Last but not least, dessert! Meyer lemon tart with toasted meringue, blood orange scented cheesecake with blueberry coulis and blood orange sorbet, chocolate peanut butter mousse bar with hazelnut ice cream and homemade blood orange and coffee macarons! I think they were all my favorite in their own special way. The lemon tart was packed with pure lemon flavor that you can only get from using fresh lemons and the toasted meringue on top added the extra bit of sweetness to cut through the tart. The blood orange cheesecake was served in bruleed wedges and I loved the added crunch on top. The sorbet and blueberry coulis were lovely additions to the creamy cheesecake and overall it was a wonderful dessert. My favorite part about the chocolate peanut butter bar had to be the hazelnut ice cream it is served with. Sweet and nutty and a fun flavor to try. 

All in all this restaurant was one I look forward to becoming a regular at. The attentiveness of the staff, meeting the Chef, the view, the enticing menu and the flavors served in each dish will have me wishing I could dine there daily. I look forward to trying their brunch menu and their sunset on the patio! 

Thanks for an incredible experience!",_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,2,2,5,zAbEZB46VTn0VJUFzWbamQ

I highly recommend the shrimp grits, seafood ceviche, shrimp tacos, parsnip soup and Hawaiian poke.  My daughter ordered the carne asada fries that she raved about.  

In addition to the Sunday brunch they also offer endless mimosas and bloody Mary's for $12 per person that we did not partake.

I HIGHLY recommend this amazing restaurant! My husband and I did in fact dine here earlier this evening celebrating a special occasion.

I have been here 4 times over the past 2 months, and I have tried nearly every single item on the menu and every single entree is to die for. I have been twice for dinner, once for Sunday brunch and once for lunch. First off, this place is so beautiful (interior and exterior) overlooking the lake and the ambience is romantic and lush. The service is top notch and you feel like royalty eating here. Ok now to the food...

I don't even know where to start. The complimentary bread is so good (comes with an olive bread, multigrain, and sourdough). Every dish consistently delivers in presentation and taste. Their sauces and vegetables on every entree are utterly delicious and so are their meats (cooked to perfection). I can't rave enough about the food. For Sunday brunch, every dish is unlimited. To find a high quality restaurant offering unlimited gourmet food at a very affordable price is so hard to find. You can't go wrong with any entree and I can say this since I've tried them all. 

This place deserves more credit than it is getting. Their food is better than most 5 star and Michelin restaurants I've been to. I've been to a handful of the top restaurants on the strip, and this one beats them all.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,2,0,5,zlpWTypBYzRbAxsTYtTjPA

I've eaten here 4 times and the food has been consistent and I cannot wait to come back for the total experience.

This time, it lured us in with an unbeatable deal for a quaint, upscale establishment that is tucked away in the Desert Shores Community. Let me tell ya', this place is a gem! The stellar discount and reviews from my favorite Yelp Elites sealed the deal. Reservations were made and off we went to enjoy our Saturday night under the stars. 

We perched ourselves at our table; ready to enjoy the mini-lakeside oasis in the desert.  Black swans, ducks, and turtles floated by as we dug into our appetizers. Our evening continued with exceptional food and attentive service that would rival any restaurant on our world-famous Strip. 

This was a wonderful place to celebrate my birthday! We were over the moon with the service, the food, and stellar Groupon deal. We are already looking forward to coming back to sample their brunch! 

 
We ordered: 

Starters that included... 

 
*Artichoke Soup*
The soup is poured over Iowa Pancetta with a creamy parmesan emulsion at the table. It was very fresh, creamy, and delectable. 

*Grilled Octopus*
Served with herbs, peppers, and slightly charred. It was delicious. I encourage you to give it a whirl! 

Main Courses that included... 

*Nantucket Scallops*
Fresh, plump, juicy and perfectly savory served over a succotash style risotto and a splash of freshness with a bright green pea purée. The scallops were out of this world! I loved them! It would be hard for me to sample another dish after enjoying my scallops so much. 

*Bone-In Ribeye*
Grilled medium-rare with a topping of roasted potatoes in a whiskey reduction. My husband licked his plate clean! I sampled a slice of his steak and was very impressed with the cut and tenderness of the steak. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.  

 *Asparagus with Truffle (Sharable/Large Side)*    
Grilled fresh asparagus served with truffle shavings and salt/pepper seasoning

Desserts that included... 

*Meyer Lemon Tart*
The refreshing nature and brightness of the Meyer Lemon did not disappoint. The citrus curd was topped with a toasted meringue and made a winning combo. It was a perfectly light and fluffy. 

 *Crème Brûlée* 
This exquisitely rich and elegant dessert had hints of vanilla bean under a signature layer of crispy, torched sugar. 


Tips/Notes

* Dress to impress. I wore denim jeans and a cute blouse. However, I would wear a dress and have my hubs swap his jeans for dress pants on the next go around. Bring a sweater in case the wind picks up. 


* Entertain out-of-towners or throw a bridal/baby shower here. This is great option to entertain visitors from out of town. They will be impressed with the private and elegant atmosphere. It would also be lovely for showers or other special events 

* Make reservations to ensure you grab a table on a busy weekend. Also, I've noticed other mention that they offer an amazing brunch. I'm looking forward to sampling that soon!",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,16,14,4,x3LH0KD5aw99XZgOxChdBQ

We were served by Misho, who was excellent & suggested that one of us order the tasting menu, while one of us order either an appetizer/salad in addition to an entree. It was a thoughtful suggestion as we were able to try a lot. 

We ordered the happy hour cheese platter, & calamari. The calamari was tossed in a sweet & sour sauce which was both different & delicious. The amuse was a refreshing oyster. First course was foie gras with a sweet chocolatey touch that was a palette pleaser. The sashimi was probably my least favorite thing we ate. Second course was a poached pear salad, and I loved the combo of sweet, savory, and creamy. The chef also generously sent my boyfriend a complimentary salad during this course. Our third course scallops were perfectly prepared. The star of the show was undoubtedly the the fourth course's smoked venison; I haven't stopped talking about it since Friday night. The presentation was inspiring, & the dish itself was a perfect medium rare & so savory. My boyfriend ordered the sea bass, I remember it tasting yummy, but I was so blown away by the venison I didn't pay much mind to his dish. Lastly, we had the peanut butter bar during the  dessert course  that I can only try to describe as a snickers ice cream bar meets a frozen Reese's peanut butter cup. 

Our dining experience spanned around 2 & 1/2 hours which I don't equate to slow service, but to the time & care it takes to prepare & deliver a meal with that delectable. Misho & Adrienne were constantly attentive despite the food pace. Chef Stephen was gracious enough to come introduce himself and shake our hands. 

The ambience is beautiful. During the daylight it's very bright, open, and unpretentious. After the sun sets, the environment defiantly feels romantic.

3939553,2017-05-15,2,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"So obviously I'm not someone who yelp reviews every place she goes to...but I'm really rooting for this place so I'll put in my 2 cents and hope they read this review.

I came here for Mother's Day brunch. 4 stars for the food. 2ish stars for the service. 

First of all, the brunch menu for Mother's Day brunch was $65...which is a significant upcharge from their typical Sunday brunch price of $42. I get it...it's a special occasion. But they didn't advertise this price anywhere and the menu didn't include *so* much more, you know? This special menu included a pretty basic dessert bar that was fine but very limited and served in plastic cups. And they included a carvery station that was also fine but also nothing special. So it was a little annoying, although absolutely not a deal breaker, to pay $23 more than any other Sunday just because it was Mother's Day.

Food: shrimp and grits were great! Portobello was also nicely done. Salads were crisp and flavored well. Smoked salmon was fine, but....you can't go wrong with this unless you have bad salmon. Carne asada fries were as good as you're gonna get. The tuna was good and the ceviche was average. Pork belly eggs benedict had little flavor but eggs were nice.

Okay. The less great. FIRST, let me preface this by saying everybody is VERY nice. AND that this restaurant is pretty new (opened November 2016) so this is the first Mother's Day they've done. I understand there are struggles. When we sat down at our table, we immediately noticed tons of trash everywhere. There were empty food packets, applesauce jars, used napkins, broken candles, scrap papers, and literally a half eaten giant ball of cotton candy (I kid you not!) all around and under our table. We notified a waitress and she said ""Oh! There was a baby here yesterday!"" Which is fine...except that was yesterday. Like...they had all night and morning to clean that crap up. So, whatever. 

Also, we waited 20 minutes just to get utensils and napkins. We were the first seating of the day at precisely 11.00 AM. I'm just saying, you literally have all morning to get your tables ready in time for opening so...you know...get them ready. Because 11 AM should not come as a surprise to you.

So, typical good waitering means if you see an empty plate, you grab it. If you see an empty glass, you fill it. But these guys arent great at that. Like, our waiter (who only stopped by twice, by the way) took our orders without taking a single one of the 7 empty plates on our table away with him. Not great.  And we had to keep asking for more drinks because they just weren't good at refilling them. But again, they were nice so I just...really want them to do well! 

We also kept getting food we *didn't* order and we weren't getting food that we *had* ordered. This is weird. I feel like they had a good number of people working! I think they just need to learn process better.

Also, some of the reviews here have mentioned that the service is slow. This was true for us as well. We are fast eaters but we must have stayed here for 2.5 hours because food was not coming out fast enough. Which also means they were behind on reservations because they just could not turn tables in time. We heard people complaining pretty loudly. The food that came was good. It just took a while for it to come.

So, yes. I'd like to come back! And I hope when I do, I get to revise my rating to something higher. Lots of kinks to work out on the front end.",yZVoXTvybz0LMItl0bRzxA,4,1,3,_g-uOjj7401IW1qehR2Gow

I was looking for a chill place to work and escape the heat and found Americana at Desert Shores.  The restaurant overlooks the lake and has patio seating and amazing views.

I ordered the Petit Salad with salmon.  The salmon was perfectly prepared, and while not huge, was definitely filling.

Added bonus! Not only was the service exceptional but my server was a classically trained pianist from Julliard and during slow times he got on the piano and played Moon River and other classical favorites.

The second time was for brunch and the service was subpar at best, but the food was still amazing.

Today, I made a reservation for myself and family, many of which had never been to Americana. I was excited to share this place with them. We will most likely not be returning. We had a reservation and waited an hour. By the time we were seated they were out of the dishes we wanted. The waiter was irritated that we wanted to order our own dishes rather than just letting him bring by what was available. For a $60 brunch, I expect a little bit more from my experience. I'm disappointed to write this review, as the food has always been delicious. Today I left irritated, frustrated, and none of my family was able to really enjoy the meal we paid so much for.

We ordered a ribeye, venison and their pear salad with couple of their sides. The server recommended us the Faust cabernet, which was great and went amazingly well with our steaks. The venison was very nicely cooked and it was really soft too. It comes in a plate with some kind of smoke that made the dish even better. There was nothing too special about the ribeye but it definitely was worth every penny we paid for. I loved their pear salad and the crystal rose jellies were something new.

4484486,2017-11-25,4,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"It pains me greatly to have to downgrade my review from five stars to two, but our Thanksgiving dinner was one turkey leg short of disaster.

A friend planned to join us and wanted a perfect sit-down dinner with atmosphere. Americana definitely has the ambience, so after looking at their Thanksgiving menu online, my husband called to make a reservation a couple of days before the holiday. They asked if there was any special occasion, and he said no. Then he remembered that it's the actual date of our anniversary (!), and called early Thanksgiving day and told them. That's when they said they had no reservation for us (WTF!), but would squeeze us in. We should have said ""never mind.""

We weren't on the patio or next to the window, and it was too brightly lit to be able to see the lake. Once seated, they provided us with a ""special"" wine list that had only bottles. I asked if there was wine available by the glass, and I was brought a pricey list. Two glasses added nearly $25 to the bill.

For our appetizer, we chose the butternut squash bisque instead of the salad. Last time we had it, it was beyond fabulous. This time it totally lacked flavor.

We all decided on the traditional turkey dinner, but what we were served was anything but traditional. I asked for mine with gravy on the side, but all three plates came out exactly the same: Slop, and more slop. Small pieces of dark meat turkey, with skin and fat, mixed in with a few veggies, some stuffing, a dollop of watery, over-pureed sweet potatoes or yams, all sitting in a pool of liquid. It looked disgusting, and tasted even worse. The stuffing had some seasoning that burned our mouths - not the kind of good spicy, but more like someone dumped half a bottle of oregano, or something like that, into the mixture.

After we complained, we were served a regular platter of white meat turkey, along with the veggies (in short supply), and the same yams and stuffing as before.  Our friend, who had a different vantage point, noticed that a table across from her had the white meat plate, too.  Had they complained also? And what's Thanksgiving dinner without cranberry sauce? It was on the menu, but wasn't served until we asked for it. And sauce it was: not jellied, not cranberries, just a cranberry-colored soup that helped us down the rather tasteless turkey. (Note: we doused the leftovers with a real, delicious, whole cranberry sauce from Smith's supermarket). 

During the meal they delivered deep-fried turkey legs to all the diners, and those were good. For dessert, we chose the peanut butter bar.  It was Thanksgiving, so we gave thanks that at least that item was the same as we remembered it, except that it was decorated with oat flakes, instead of the strawberries or raspberries of memory.

Finally, why ask if there's a special occasion being celebrated, if absolutely nothing is said or done to commemorate that occasion? So much for our anniversary.

For those who think this is a five-star restaurant, go on a holiday and see for yourself how they can't handle a crowd.  As for us, we're done, in more ways than simply ending this review.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,6,2,M231Ni4GCTqVrmIXuLgRKg

But lets get right to the reason for the five stars.... The food!
We started with the duo of Kumamoto Oysters. These are always my favorites, but these were fresh, served well, and delicious!
Next was the Golden Truffled Egg Salad, this is an absolute must! A perfectly poached Golden egg.... yes, gold..... covered in gold, on a bed of petite spinach with Jamón Iberico (a cured ham) and a perfect Hazelnut Vinaigrette. Every bite was perfect!
My Entree was the Ravioli Doppio,  (Buffalo Ricotta and Berkshire Pork Ragu). You can have a smaller portion as an appetizer, I opted for the Entree and I did not regret the decision! It was rich and decadent down to the last drop of sauce I soaked up with bread!
My hubby opted for none other than the Wagyu! He ordered an extra ounce or two knowing I would nibble off of his plate.
This was so amazingly perfect! Cooked and sliced to exact perfection! Each piece melted in your mouth like butter! Almost made me rethink my ravioli.....almost... I got the best of both worlds.... my ravioli and his Wagyu!

I always hear people raving about Lake Las Vegas Which I believe has a shopping area and a casino, but this lake has cleaner water and of course this awesome Restaurant. I had the pleasure of visiting this location, by recommendation.  Americana has a beautiful location right by the Lakes, you can either dine inside or dine outside. The view is spectacular and you can even catch a glimpse of some ducks frockling in the water. The locals are even lucky because they have boats they can cruise in.  But I personally just can't get over how awesome the water looks and how lucky this restaurant is to be located in a serene and even romantic location.
Now that we have established how magnificent the view is and location let's get to the food!  The menu is definitely not your average burger and steaks! The chef definitely put some work on creating a very unique menu and the prices are definitely worth it, considering their ingredients are fresh (like their herbs that are located in the patio). I caught a glimpse of the cook selecting the herbs straight from there pots that are located around the patio. Talk about Fresh! Wow!
We ordered a few items off the menu and the most impressive order has to be the smoked Salmon Tar Tare, when it arrived at our table the waiter unveiled the dish and this beautiful smoked aroma filled the restaurant.  The best part is the food tasted just as the smell did, it was quite an experience! Our next item order was the toasted beef with veggies and cheese, omg the flavors were excellent and it was definitely an upgrade then your normal pot roast- I wish I remembered the name, but the meat was smothered in some cheese and it was delicious. I definitely can't recreate this dish, but I will definitely be back for more!  I am a little disappointed that I didn't have room for dessert, I should of not eaten so much bread, but hey the truffle butter was to die for and definitely made resisting the bread more difficult.
So would I recommend this place? Yes!  Would I recommend children? Maybe unless your going for a romantic dinner, then No!  Is the staff awesome? Yes!

Then we had reservations in the main area - such beautiful scenery of the lake, you forget you're in Vegas. We got some oysters to start - very fresh. My wife had the scallops/gnocchi - truffles! I had the salmon, cooked to perfection. For sides, we got the grilled veggies - great variety of veggies! And crab fried rice - even better than it sounds! We concluded with a delectable cheesecake/sherbet dessert.

Again, the service here was the best. We'll be back for Happy Hour and future special occasions!",XbrgwqwKyCUAVeQMSE7Lvg,1,0,5,Ha60lZh8dJCn_Sa8Zj0FhA

The this lady (I'm assuming the owners wife) who was a typical summerlin Mom then started to throw a fit in the middle of the restaurant because the lights were turned off and kept insisting that they should be turned on again.

It's also a spacious place with a great view. A hidden jem where you have the quality of the strip but much less bucks. 

What I tried:

1. Golden truffle egg salad (5/5). Great presentation with the golden egg. Enjoyed the hazelnut vinaigrette with the spinach and iberico ham. 

2. Foie gras terrine (5/5). Again, loved the presentation. IG worthy pic. I enjoyed everything in this dish. The fig jam, the bitter chocolate and the brioche. I would definitely order it again. 

3. Pan roasted Australian seabass (5/5). I loved this entree. Very light flavor so it doesn't overpower the freshness of the fish. It was prepared perfectly, crunchy on the skin and tender inside. 

4. Crispy Skinned chicken (3/5). Probably the dish I liked the least that night. Loved the potato. However, the flavor of the chicken was there, and the chicken seemed a bit dry. 

5. Lemon tart (3/5). It was nicely presented like the other dishes. However, I thought it was overpriced for the tart with average flavor. 

6. Tangerine cheese cake (4/5). I enjoyed the torched cheese cake with tangerine pieces. It came together nicely. 

7. Macarons (5/5). Chef was kind enough to provide us complementary macarons. Loved the banana flavor. It was so delicious. Definitely will get that again. 

In short, this will be a restaurant that I will visit regularly. Although the chef/owner was from Charlie Palmer, I enjoyed this place much much more than Charlie Palmer.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,10,9,5,jHo6g4ecuhYvqQCCKkIaYg

5141621,2018-06-24,0,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"An inclusive brunch and an all you can drink option are great, but dependent on two things- fresh food and prompt attentive service. Our Father's Day visit to Americana was lacking both. 

At nearly double the price of their regular brunch the Father's Day bunch had an attenuated menu and the addition of a sea food station and a carving station with prime rib and lemon chicken. The prime rib was a quality cut and the a jus sauce was perfectly reduced and not thin like most. The sea food was fresh and flavorful.

The problem lay in the other menu items that were tapas sized and underwhelming.  Tapas sized entrees are fine if they're executed properly, the Border Grill brunch consists entirely of such dishes. Here they came out so infrequently and late it was hard to judge if the dish was bad or as our as our waiter put it ""the computer dropped the order."" so that was why the dish was lukewarm and bland. 

We started with a watermelon salad that was plated like the watermelon had it's value in gold-a sole one inch chunk- that the waiter apologized unprompted for and said he would correct- he did not.  We had the white pie, pork belly waffles, the short rib Benedict all were just ether lukewarm or tasteless. We also had the corn on the cob dish, that was like Mexican street corn, but served stone cold. Was the food horrible - no, but at the price being asked and having experienced Cleo's Mother's Day brunch which was considerably less in cost with the same stations but more of them and better executed. Cleo also had more patrons that day and did a fantastic job of service. 

The mark of a quality restaurant is that they are seeking to meet your needs up to the time you exit the establishment. We hardly saw the wait staff after taking our order and once the bill was processed they absolutely disappeared. Again I compare them the Border Grill and Cleo staff who were prompt and attentive for the complete meal regardless of the number of customers.

Greeted and seated right away.  Our waiter, Marcil,  was personable and really knew the menu. He was fantastic.   For dinner we ate the following:

Octopus appetizer x 2:   This was by far the best thing we had all night.  Octopus was incredibly tender!  The plate had little sauces to eat with the octopus and blood orange pieces as well.  It all balanced out so well.  This is a must try! You will not be disappointed

Chef surprised us with homemade gnocchi that they were going to start featuring on the menu.  Mine came with a beautiful sauce and a medley of fresh mushrooms.  No shrooms on DH.  Gnocchi was good, but not as fluffy as I normally like.  But definitely appreciated the chefs thoughtfulness! 

Entrees.  Smoke venison, again.  It was so perfectly done last time. We had to order it again.   

Seared scallops and truffle risotto - presentation was beautiful.  Unfortunately, the scallops were a little under cooked.  So was the risotto.  A little more than al dente, it was a bit of a disappointment just bc it was so beautiful I wanted it to taste as good as it looked.  For what it's worth, the flavors were delicious, just the temp was under.   

Last time we were hear, there was a little issue with the whole Jaqueline fries, when we were told they were like truffle fries.   As a surprise, Manager Samantha, brought us out homemade truffle fries with real truffle sliced over.   AMAZING SERVICE AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  

For dessert Chef again surprised us with the peanut butter bar, lemon bar and macaroons.   The desserts were all very good on their own accord.  Peanut butter bar rich and decadent.  Lemon bar sweet and tart.  Macaroons crunchy yet moist.

Food: If you see the review below, for June 2017, it was great! There were cool items on the menu and the dishes were fantastic. They did not have the bagel with lox/salmon and cream cheese that was on their menu the last time, which was disappointing as it was delicious. Instead they had mussels with lemongrass, which were OK. We ordered the summer corn chowder which was grossly disappointing and extremely bland. The buttermilk pancakes were good, the kids loved the French toast and strawberry crepes, and we did like the fruit parfait. The burrito was just OK. The turkey and bacon sandwich was way too heavy and a disappointment. The meatball crostini was a fail when compared to top restaurants with incredible meatball recipes. The biggest fail, though, was the shrimp and grits. I raved about how good this was the last time that I was there. Our waiter today told us that the dish comes with only one prawn and grits per person, so he ordered three prawns as there were three people. The prawns were good, but the grits were a massive disappointment. They were light and airy the last time and absolutely delicious. This time, they were overly thick and placed like a paste on the plate, like a decoration rather than food. It did not work. The last time they came in a bowl full of grits with three shrimp in it and it was just for me and it was perfect. This time, it was literally a thin paste of overly thick grits, underseasoned, with prawns. The menu states $42 for everything on the menu with no limits. I don't see why it's one prawn per person. That was not an issue last time and this is why it worked so well last time.
Service: this left a lot to be desired. For the first time, I tipped a waiter the minimum rather than going over which is what I usually do. It turned out that we had a way better waiter the last time. The last waiter was experienced and apparently put all of our orders in as family style. It worked! The service was great. This waiter was not all that present, his staff did more work than he did, he kept asking for how many people was the order for which was very annoying and confusing as it was very different the last time that we were there, and the family style isn't that much bigger, and it took forever to bill our credit cards. 
Overall, it was very disappointing compared to the first time that I was there and there was absolutely no consistency in terms of how good the last time was compared to how average and not so great it was this time. Chances are that I will be asking to go to other places on the strip for brunch. I had hoped to find something off the strip, but this restaurant, for me, proves that it's a hit or miss for brunch. I am not OK with that.

June 2017: This is a review for brunch. We went earlier today, on Sunday, at 12 PM. 
The location is beautiful and the scenery is absolutely gorgeous. When the weather is not very hot or very cold, a table outside is a must if you can get it. Overlooking a man-made small lake with beautiful homes surrounding it, with an absolute peaceful and surreal picture, it is relaxing and makes you think you left Las Vegas for a vacation.
The restaurant is beautiful. It is open and airy and the lobby going into the restaurant is rich with posh comfortable sofas and a beautiful bar. You feel at home right away.
The service is wonderful. They are very attentive and they are very friendly. If they can do anything to make your dining experience better, they will. The menu for brunch is fantastic! It is all you can eat off the menu for $42. If you want to add bottomless Mimosas or bloody Marys, it is another $17. I ordered the shrimp and grits which was perfection. I ordered the lox with bagel and cream cheese which was delicious. I ordered the French toast which was quite yummy and the fruit parfait which was incredible. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict which he loved, along with a Caesar salad and wedge salad which he loved as well. We simply could not eat more because we were full, but everything was delicious.I did have them almost Mimosas and my friend had the bottomless bloody Mary, both delicious.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,2,0,3,KfQR2n4gEyntUJ85ewCSjA

Casey and his team were all very attentive and he had great recommendations! We had a table by the water and the ambiance is top notch. The brunch is unlimited small plates so Casey chose a few popular items and brought them to the table for us to try while we looked at the menu. They're shareable so you get to try so many different things! There's also unlimited Bloody Marys, Watermelon Margaritas, and Mimosas. At $42 unlimited food and drinks per person it's hard to beat. Especially when it's gourmet dining at its finest. Well done!!

I had eaten here years ago when the venue was a seafood restaurant and was excited to try it again. Normally I would choose this restaurant for a special occasion but we had an expiring Groupon. 

We had perfect weather for lunchtime outdoor seating by the lake. When we arrived, we were surprised that only a few other patrons were eating on a Friday at 12:30. It did start to get busier by the time we finished our meal. So readers, please consider this establishment and keep it open!

The staff was very attentive throughout the meal. Warm bread was served immediately with complimentary champagne. I am not generally fond of champagne but this house version was delicious. I would order it again. The bread was to die for, with three types. My favorite was the multi grain. Normally I skip the bread due to gluten sensitivity but I made an exception this time. I ordered the parsnip soup out of curiosity since I never ate it before. It was served elegantly with veggies in the bowl first and then the soup was poured into the very warm bowl. Even the dish underneath had been warmed. There is great attention to detail here. 

I ordered the Pataluma Chicken and altered the side  dish to eliminate Brussel sprouts. I am familiar with Mary's Organic chicken and this was better.  I had the roasted tomatoes and mashed potatoes. There was a drizzle of balsamic reduction which perfectly complimented the food. The tomatoes were so sweet. Each mouthful was an explosion of flavor. The hubby ordered the wild king salmon with leeks and fingerling potatoes. Lunch portions were perfect.  We were too full for dessert.

As soon as I was home, I ordered another Groupon. As stated first, this is a gem, worthy of any occasion. Take your guests here instead of heading down to the Strip.",YCkRZrpcLi177y5wUSQX2w,3,0,5,Lzw_qOJKWI5CZE4yWdZ2bg

My friend and I decided to check this place out on a Friday evening. We had made a reservation so we were sat at a nice table with a nice view of the lake. 

We both ordered a glass of wine. I enjoyed a tasty Albariño which would complement my main entree'. My friend ordered a Chardonnay which also went well with her choice. We then ordered a delicious appetizer of Compressed Watermelon - served with organic watercress, burrata and heirloom tomatoes. Being such a hot summer, this was this perfect way to begin this food journey. Next came our entrees, Pan roasted Rainbow Trout served with flowering cauliflower, radishes and mangoes. This dish was so heavenly. The fish was cooked to perfection and all of the accompaniments really complemented the dish. Every bite was an explosion of flavors. My friend ordered the Nantucket Scallops which I was able to taste and yet again a very edible and satisfying dish. She was wishing there were more scallops to eat when she was done. 

For dessert, we selected the cheesecake complemented with a blood orange sorbet. Our waiter also brought us mocha macaroons with raspberry sauce to top it off just because. This dessert was very tasty and the cheesecake/sorbet combination was genius. 

Our service was outstanding and we did not want for anything. I was extremely pleased with this dining experience and anxious to return to taste more of their dishes.

The brunch was $42, and everything is unlimited. There are about 20 options. I did take a picture of the menu. Also, the menu that is on their website, is correct. I studied it before we went. So, by the time the waiter came along, I already knew what I wanted!

The things that I really liked were the salmon with cream cheese and bagel, artichoke soup with pancetta and grits and shrimp.... I ordered about three of these. 

For the sweet options, they only had four, and we ordered all four of them. The two that we really liked were the creme Caramel which was basically a flan and a parfait with granola and sweet cream. We ordered two of those.

The views are absolutely incredible. But, at night, I know that it is even more beautiful. They have beautiful little lights everywhere that make it extremely romantic.

Upon entering there was nobody anywhere; not at the bar or at the hostess station and no guests at all in the dining room so actually thought they were closed until we saw a few people on the terrace. We headed that way and a girl materialized from somewhere and eventually led us to a table outside overlooking the lake. The cushion was falling off of my chair and when I started to adjust it noticed a massive amount of debris and leaves so obviously they had not been cleaned in awhile. We then waited a little over 10 minutes for the one waiter to come to our table and we then asked for menus. There was a table of 4 that had finished eating; a table of two and us also a table of two so he certainly wasn't overwhelmed with customers but appeared to be flustered. I had the Pan Roasted Salmon which the menu said came with Cranberries, Delicata Squash and Spiced Apples. The Salmon was NOT pan roasted but instead seared off and put in a oven; there were no Cranberries and no Spiced Apples and the Squash was over cooked and flavorless. My companion had the Short Rib with Butternut Squash and Garlic Potato Puree. The Short Rib was tasty but there was no Butternut Squash and instead the exact same over cooked Squash that was on my plate. The Garlic Potato Puree had NO garlic. The table next to us was complaining about how expensive the drinks/liquor was compared to the food prices and I must agree. They did provide a nice basket of assorted breads and butter and we had a great bottle of wine which saved the whole lunch. Will I go back ??

It is pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Five star service. Attentive staff. The highest quality.

Every bite was better than the last. Being the indecisive one, we ordered all the desserts, my favorite being peanut butter bar. 

Turning it up a notch on a Wednesday night, we paired each course with a glass of wine and started the meal with a smoky old fashioned. This was an experience. It's brought out in a glass case that is opened table side.

For appetizers, we ordered the oysters (which were amazing), the beet salad (also delicious), and the squid spaghetti (slightly overcooked and subpar taste compared to the oysters and the beets). As for entrees, I ordered the shrimp and scallop paella and my boyfriend and my boyfriend ordered the lamb with a side of asparagus. While the proteins were cooked beautifully, I was expecting my paella to be more on the saucier side.

Overall, the flavors were good but maybe not the price that we paid for good. It also may be because I was not expecting the food to be so traditional. I saw ""fine-dining"" on their website and some pics on yelp and expected more interesting flavor combinations.

As for the location, it really is romantic which is precisely why my boyfriend and I chose this place for our anniversary. And I do have to say, the service here really knows how to give a personalized touch. We had Casey as our server, but I wish I knew everyone who made our visit so amazing. If you're into more traditional food and you want to a romantic place to celebrate, Americana could be the place for you.

5927205,2017-05-15,4,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"We came here for mother's day brunch. Very unorganized staff... i worked in restaurants for 10 years and i know mother's day is one of the busiest days of the year. But this place was a mess. The hostesses were so backed up (not their fault) that reservations had to wait 45 minutes for their table.  Then when they did try to seat us they gave us a table in a totally separate room not a part of the actual restaurant. There was only one other table and there was no music playing or anything. The table wasn't even set with place settings.  Not really acceptable after waiting 45 minutes for a table with reservations. I ended up speaking to a female manager and she told me that they used the other room for catering and that she couldn't move us because we were already sat... Not the friendliest or most professional way to handle the situation. Luckily the young hostess was much more helpful and moved us to a nice table by the piano. 

Our server was nice enough... although when we sat he said he would send out a sampling of the entire menu. It honestly felt like he just didn't really have time to take our order. Plus we ended up not getting everything on the menu anyway. The food was decent for the most part but nothing worth $65 per person plus an additional $20 for mimosas. 

I wanted to like this place; we love going to nice ""locals"" type of restaurants. It has nice views of the lake and could have been great,  but they have really got to work out their issues.  Unfortunately we will not be back.",lx51rqUtlmoTxWs9RZu1uA,8,4,2,bJiIhFKVszF0VyyklFXqtA

5967436,2017-05-19,6,siuAD-vFRYAjozc332wq3g,"KA-BOOM! Me and my man were completely blown away by everything at this restaurant. The atmosphere in the sitting area is open and very romantic with help from the low lights and lake right next to the patio area. The music also helped with keeping the mood just right and their playlist had a mix of slow, relaxing music. 

Now the good stuff, finding this restaurant was a little tricky as it is tucked away in the corner by AllState and the floral shop. When we entered the bar area, we were greeted by Daniel and another young lady. He was very polite and welcoming. When we mentioned we were there to celebrate my man's promotion, he reached out his hand and shook my mans hand and congratulated him. I was very impressed with how he presented himself and welcomed us to the restaurant. Our server assistant and server were really attentive and helped us decided on menu choices with their excellent recommendations. We got the oysters naked with the champagne mignonette which complimented the oysters superbly.  The mignonette included diced cucumbers which gave the sauce a crisp, refreshing taste. The oysters themselves were fresh and smooth as it glided from the shell into my mouth. For our main entree, my man ordered the Rib Eye, I opted for the Filet Mignon and we ordered the crab fried rice. The presentation of these dishes were overwhelming. I was not expecting as much food and all three dishes did not disappoint.  The Chef prepared both dishes to specified temperature and the reductions that they were prepared in were perfect. We took some of it home, because it was a lot plus we wanted dessert. For the finally we ordered the Meyer Lemon Tart along with two glasses of pinot grigio. Our dessert was brought along with two tangerine macaroons. The Meyer Lemon tart was a bit on the sweet side even for me but it was a nice ending to the meal and so were the macaroons. 

I liked the view at Americana a lot better than Marche Baccus as you could see more of the lake. This place has nothing but high marks from me in every category.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,11,10,5,4N_ZEALZuBsD-HpuYpf0Jg

Obviously this made a complete 180, as I'm leaving 5 stars instead. I had set reservations for Father's Day a month ahead of time and had called the day before to see if we could be seated indoors instead of on the patio (112 degree heat + a baby), as my original reservation requested. When we arrived, our reservation had not been updated to reflect the change; they had a table for us on the patio. After a short wait, a table indoors had been prepared for us and we were seated. About 5 minutes went by without a server or even menus. Then, a man came by and poured our waters and said our server would be right with us. Then, 15 more minutes went by and we still didn't have menus or a server, and now even the guy who poured our waters was MIA. Frustrated, my husband and I were packing our stuff up to leave. I was upset because this was a first Father's Day treat for him and I wanted it to be perfect. My husband got up to leave, but on the way to the restroom, bumped into Samantha, the manager at the time. He explained to her that we had been waiting for 15-20 mins with no menus, no server, nothing but two waters (then empty). This is where my review turns around. Immediately, Samantha sprung into action to make it right. She put a server on our table right away (Vinnie) and the food and drinks started coming quickly. Our plates and glasses were never empty. Vinnie was the best. He was attentive, fast and generous and treated us very well. He and Samantha were both overly apologetic and paid for our whole meal, which was unnecessary but very much appreciated. Every single thing we ate was FANTASTIC and the ambiance was perfect.

Part 2: My mother came to town, and we wanted to treat her to brunch and also celebrate my new job. We requested Vinnie as our server, of course, and like the first time, he was Johnny on the spot with everything. The menu had slightly changed, but every single thing we had was perfect (again), and Vinnie never left our glasses empty... again. We had a wonderful time.

So glad we didn't give up on this place. We continue to recommend Americana to all of our friends! We'll be back.",r9TtgyIUyeWhWM8BsqKj8w,1,0,5,pi7rSpGaFhooFW1guFX5_w
