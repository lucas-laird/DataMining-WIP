Waitress/Servers need to be more enthusiastic and say hi to customers as they come in and not leave you unattended for a long period of time, which happened on our first visit. We mentioned the place to our friends and we decided to go again (second time in a week) and this time we were dissapointed and even ashamed we had mentioned the place to our friends. Service again from servers was bad, again they need to say hi to customers and not leave them unattended. They didn't have some of the food in the menu available. The server messed up our entire order and we had to wait longer. All in all some of the food is good, other not so good and they need better service and to have food in the menu available, if you cannot have it available, why advertise it???

935108,2015-12-02,0,gTlKDwjfiNvCc5mnl8p1NQ,"Just walked out of this place with no food, still hungry after a poor customer service experience.

First of all, I've eaten here before and even ordered catering for a party, and the food is pretty good. It's not Miami good, but it's as good as you are going to get in Las Vegas. When I ate here, it was a relatively new place and hadn't yet been turned into a wannabe nightclub. 

I'm sure some people will like it, but I don't enjoy walking into a ""cafe"" at noon and immediately finding myself in a pitch black empty dance party. I could barely read the menu. Turn some lights on! Turn the weird strobe effects off!

After 3 minutes spent getting the attention of the one person working there, a very busy hispanic lady who didn't speak a ton of English, I ordered a simple Cuban sandwich. Example of the language barrier: I asked her how long would it take to make the sandwich, and she brought out an example of the sandwich from the kitchen, thinking I was asking how big it was. After that, I made sure to throw in some Spanish for my order. 

It was $10, which isn't a terrible price, but isn't exactly a bargain either. I threw $13 on the bill just so I could have it paid for and leave.

When I ordered, I told her in both English and Spanish that I didn't want any pickles or mustard on the sandwich. (Sin pepino, sin mustasa) When the bill came and I paid, I reiterated that I didn't want any pickles or mustard.

15 minutes after I order (a looooong time in an empty place), I finally get my sandwich. I take it outside in the to go container, because I literally can't see in the dark, and discover it has mustard on it. I bring it back in, and the server/bartender thinks I'm complaining about the mustard packets that were included in the bag. After finally getting her to understand there is mustard on the actual sandwich, she takes it back to the kitchen.

4 minutes later, she comes out, skips me and goes straight to the other customers in the restaurant. When I get her attention and ask her about my sandwich, she tells me it will be another ""8 or 9 minutes."" 

At this point, I'm super annoyed that a sandwich not only takes so long, but also that nobody has apologized or even taken the time to give me an estimate on a remake. I tell her that I just want a refund, and she goes back into the kitchen. A very annoying 3 minutes later, I get my money, she finally apologizes, and I walk out hungry.

That covers my experience, but there were other problems around as well.

One guy came in and sat down. It took about 2 minutes before she talked to him and he ordered a soda. When I was still waiting for my food to come out, he finally got up and asked for the bill for the soda. It was unclear what the exchange was, but he either canceled his order because it was taking too long or he was unhappy because she never came back to take his food order in the first place. Either way, there was even more drama when the soda bill came and she said they don't accept cards when the bill is that low. He didn't have cash, so she had to let him walk out without paying.

Another couple came in, looked around, and left without ever sitting down. This was during the 4 minutes no employee was in the front of the house. 

I really wish I could find a Cuban place in Las Vegas that serves good food and has great service, but this isn't it. This is a Cuban place with an identity crisis. Is it a live music venue? Is it a night club? Is it a restaurant? Is it a cafe? It somehow manages to be all of the above and none of the above simultaneously. 

I just wish I could walk into a real cafe and get a Cuban sandwich or some bistec empanizado in a reasonable amount of time.",BwoZMzp8iqeNFwGMhS25Dw,5,0,2,8RXtuZKOMnGfZiia620dQA
980400,2014-11-09,0,gTlKDwjfiNvCc5mnl8p1NQ,"We went here to taste Cuban food in Vegas. We went in around 3pm to enjoy lunch. As we entered we were greeted by owners, servers, and musicians. Very warm welcome. 

I had pechuga de pollo (chicken) with Congri. I wasn't asked if I wanted Congri but since I was hungry I just went with it. Not bad but it was on the dry side. The chicken was good though. Well cooked, moist and seasoned with the right flavors but a bit too much salt. To be perfectly honest every restaurant I've been to in Vegas has used salt excessively. I think it's a regional preference, but who knows. 

I ordered yuca frita as an appetizer. Again too salty but it was good and the mojo was perfect.  Waitress was cool and attentive. 

There was an old Guajiro playing Cuban classics with his Tres like 'Guantanamera' & 'Como Fuè'. Desert was un cafe cubanito nade correctly. Yes, I'm of Cuban decent. lol 

4 stars because the food was good not great, and the service, staff and ambience was accommodating as well as comfortable. Sorry, no pics this go 'round.

My wife and I were excied to try something new. The place was nice, clean and cool with Cuban videos playing in the background.

We were promptly greeted. Down hill from there. The young lady spoke no english..at all. IE; we had asked for a booth, she did not understand the word. A quick look around revealed that there were no booths. We were handed attractive, clean menus. 
I had asked her to recommend a Cuban speciality soft drink or cocktail. She did not understand. I settled for a (bottled) diet coke. The menu did not expand on the primary ingredients of each selection. There were a few pictures....so much for trying something new and exciting. I tried a few times to have our server explain their menu items.....no go. Disappointing to say the least.

We settled for the 'Cuban Sandwich' and a tamale. The sandwich was....well a Cuban Sandwich....and the tamale was tasty with a rather sweet masa stuffed with chunks of pork roast.  Our server said it was hot.  I asked 'temperature or spicy' she said ""spicy"". Not

It was an unpleasant surprise to find they were no longer accepting the deals, but the meal itself was so much better than expected that I didn't count off a star for it as I normally might.

Appetizer: Yucca is amazing, if you haven't had it before this is a good place for a first experience. The garlic sauce makes the dish. 
Entrees: Palmilla steak was thin cut with grilled onions and served with a rice-bean mixture that was understated and simple but so tasty. Cuban sando was huge and perfectly toasty with melty cheese and plenty of meat inside, served with basic fries.
Dessert: Flan was creamy and that espresso alone would make me come back- tiny, strong, sweet, and flavorful. 

The space is odd, with dark wood floors and high-end-looking tables with topped with glass and cloths, but dollar bills and writing covering the walls like a low-end club, and a small bar to the side of the entrance.

2235873,2013-09-15,7,gTlKDwjfiNvCc5mnl8p1NQ,"""We are not screaming. We are just Cuban.""

Truer words have never been printed on the wall of a Cuban restaurant. I started laughing as soon as I walked in and read this, so I was definitely off to a good start with El Mundo Cubano. Next, I spotted two glass displays of guava pastries and I was ready to place my to go order: one of each pastry and a café con leche. One was puff pastry with guava paste filling and the other was more like a crisp, sweet cookie dough with the same filling. More guava filling would have been nice and $2 a piece seems pricey, but they tasted great!

$8.50 for two small pastelitos and a café con leche is about double what I'm used to paying, but after one sip of that coffee, Celia Cruz started singing ""La Vida es un Carnaval"" and I was driving down Okeechobee Blvd. in my hometown, West Palm Beach. It had the proper amount of sugar (way too much) and the perfect flavor. They also included two slices of delicious buttered Cuban bread. Every other Cuban place outside of Florida has served me unsweetened coffee and disappointment. 

There's dollar bills pinned on the walls and hand-written notes, and a little stage in the corner with guitars and drums. I'll have to find out when they feature live music so I can come back for that, and to try their black beans, rice, and plantains. It's a high price for espresso and pastries, but it's cheaper than a trip to South Florida!",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,11,6,4,lRga9oaFhDX_jlvw0sN_MA

The food can only be considered authentic by the inexperienced or the ""New"" Cubans that sadly do not know good taste as they have lived on the island having to go without proper ingredients and spices. The food was too greasy and lacking taste. 
the lowdown
Picadillo (ground beef) the greasiest mess I have ever been served
Ropa Vieja (skirt steak roast) tough and chewy rather than tender and lacking much taste.

Ordered the Cuban Coffee, which was great, even came in a little coffee cup adorned with Cuban flags. Server was nice enough. I ordered sauteed pork with the con gris and a side of fried yucca and my girlfriend ordered the Cuban sandwich.

Here is where it goes wrong. Everything was luke warm. Most likely reheated, which was a shame because the con gris was actually good, just cold. The pork was the chewiest thing on the planet. I thought I had gotten grissle or something but all of them were like that. The fried yucca was not fried enough. The fried yucca pieces were huge, never seen that with fried yucca. The outside of most pieces were a bit fried but the inside was mush, just like regular yucca. I wanted something more fried.

The cuban sandwich was also cold. The bread was extremely flaky, again a shame. Cuban bread is delicious but this was lacking. Also, the pork was whatever on the sandwich. Like boiled ham. No real flavor. If it was warmer, it would not have been so bad. 

Apparently this place has live music sometimes, I think that'd be amazing to see. I can't rate it based off the possibility of live music, but if you wanted to check this place out, that would be the time. It wasn't great.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,3,0,2,JdETSF1WguBaUvrDxGUu9Q

We visited on a Sunday evening so it wasn't very busy. The atmosphere is casual, kinda like you're sitting in a good friends living room. There are chairs and small tables outsiide as well for Al Fresco Dining. Our server was very nice and attentive making sure we had water and checking in on us often. 

The menu is small with just a few well picked choices for your meal. For our appetizers we chose the Tostones and Fried Yucca. The Yucca was especially good and crispy. Both came with garlic dipping sauce, Yum! For our entrees we shared Ropa Vieja with Congris and white rice with frijoles (black beans) and Palomilla steak. The Ropa Vieja was to die for and the steak was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife. The white rice and frijoles were much better than the Congris; there was just something missing in the flavor. The only thing missing from our meal was a slice of avocado! There were only two choices for dessert; a slice of guava and flan. We had the flan and it was good but not great. The caramel sauce tasted as if it had come from a bottle not home made.

They first had to have us show them where on their own shelves the liquor was. Then instead of mixing the drinks, they poured the liquor into shot glasses. We had to tell them no, you mix them. So the guy bust out the REALLY REALLY small glasses not much bigger than the shot glasses they were already in, pours our shots in them and fills the rest with about a tablespoon of coke and orange juice. Then charged us $4 each. Between our drinks and the food, it was over $50. Once we got home, I was highly annoyed. The rice and chicken dish was very tiny and 99% rice.

I was so excited!, I have never been to a Cuban restaurant. We first went with our kids but as we walked in around 4 it had a night club vibe, so we decided to take the kids home and come back. My husband and I came back, waitress was nice told us about their famous Mojitos and took our appetizer order. I was excited because they were going to have live entertainment later on in the night. I went on Facebook check us in and noticed on their page that it was happy hour! I was like ""yes""!!! So we started pounding down mojitos, got our appetizers fried plantains, they were good, Oh yes Mojitos were good too. We ordered our food, my husband had the Cuban sandwich and it was just blah, nothing special, I don't remember the name of my dish but it was  fried pork like carnitas but super dry and hard the black bean and rice were good. As the evening went on the ""live entertainment"" began, it was just one singer with his back up music, not gonna complain he was pretty good!. Now, once we asked for our bill I noticed that our drinks were full price not happy hour price, so I asked the waitress which she had no idea about happy hour, so I showed her their Facebook post. She told us she would talk to the manager, I also handed her the gift certificate I had won, it was for $25. She came back and told us that the manager said they can't honor the happy hour if we used the $25 certificate, we had to pick one or the other! I was like wtf?!!! Are you kidding me! So she called him over and he told us we couldn't do both, it was either happy hour or certificate we had to choose! I mean come on!! I have never been to a restaurant were they turned down their own gift certificate!! And than advertised happy hour and deny it to a customer! I was so disappointed because we were having a good time and were thinking about coming back and actually thought of bringing friends that were coming in from out of town. I told the manager which turns out was the owner that my certificate was going to expire the next day and all he did was sign it too extend the date... Did we go back HECK NO!! If I was the owner I would have been, ""you know what because you guys are new to my restaurant and seem like you had a good time I will honor the gift certificate and give you the happy hour price just so you come back"" but he decided to lose potential returning customers, sucks for him because we were going to go back! I'll just stick to Applebee's happy hour! They are happy to take my gift certificate during happy hour! If they are lacking business they shouldn't give these gift certificates to radio stations to give away and then turn them down. So sad! They definitely lost returning customers and all the others I could have recommended. Sucky service!",4PQxdRCHsxyjDWeAuMdkMw,5,1,2,sjPQwxMavwO76rQxzjuTAw

I'm a big coffee person. The stronger the coffee, the better. And the coffee here is perfect. It's strong but sweet. Not bitter at all. Which is my style. I had some Cuban tamales and the classic Cuban sandwich . (The real deal) it was wonderfully made and all tasted nothing short of amazing ! The place is nice and clean, the owner was super kind, and the overall environment and experience was pleasant. They also play live music on the weekend at 6, I definitely will be back to check that out. I highly recommend this place to try some quality Cuban and a good espresso",MsmIGfzd3oQYEUMG1rLHEw,0,0,5,5J7g5_nBRVpkaUz6W_M6Lg

I also ordered congri on the side which is $3. The food is way over priced for the small portion they serve. There's not a lot of options on the menu either.
The food all together? Including my mother in laws and my husbands food; it taste like something that my mother in law can make at home but a lot better. Moving on to customer service? My husband dropped his fork and the owners wife immediately gave him new utensils. So that was a plus... There are a few tables and chairs outside if you feel like eating out in the sun or at night. This place is eh, not all that great. It's not a place i would ever come back to.",omzK_8C8RdZoulHbC8t3Ug,4,2,1,QTx4nAjHFoXk42H94cyx7A

4835383,2014-06-14,1,gTlKDwjfiNvCc5mnl8p1NQ,"Went here since I had bought their groupon. I ordered the ham croquettes, the cuban tamale, and the cuban sandwich.

I had to send the croquettes back since they were still frozen in the middle. The initial order that came out had 5 on the plate. When the server came back, there was only 4 on the plate, with some of the filling coming out, like a over cooked mozzarella stick. So I guess they just re-fried the same order that I sent back.

The cuban sandwich was mediocre at best. I chewed through so much bread compared to the amount of roast pork and ham on it. Even though I don't know for certain, I can only assume the pork wasn't made that day by the way it looked and tasted. It was priced at 10 bucks, and was comparable to a school lunch sandwich a parent would make, in terms of size. Barely any cheese, with the most flavorful part of it being the mustard that was on it. Nothing special like spicy mustard, grainy mustard, or even grey poupon. Just regular yellow mustard. 

The only redeemable part of what I ordered was the tamale, but only marginally. While it was actually tasty, there was a lot of the masa compared to only two pieces of what I was to assume were pork. For whatever reason, there were pork rinds on top.

Overall, the food tasted as if a non-cuban person attempted to make cuban food for the first time. Nothing that stood out enough to make me want to come back without a groupon. If it wasn't for the groupon, I would have felt like I didn't get my money's worth.

I would recommend to pass on this place unless you have some type of coupon/groupon/sale/deal.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,0,0,2,M0eSZ-OBFYYeQyueHwlfHA

5260158,2014-06-10,2,gTlKDwjfiNvCc5mnl8p1NQ,"Since moving to Vegas, my wife and I have been going through some serious Cuban sandwich withdrawal. Finally, we found this place and decided to go in for lunch. The place is small, but nice, well-decorated and clean, with a full bar and a small stage for live music. The guy who waited on us (and I believe, cooked our food) was very friendly and welcoming. And our sandwiches were excellent, exactly what we were craving! So far, so good, right? Indeed. 4 stars, in fact. I'm taking that 4th star back, though, because of the fact that they only allow you to have fries as a side. The rice and beans have always been a huge draw for my wife (and many other people) at other Cuban restaurants, and was what she wanted for her sides, but they wouldn't allow it. We offered to pay the difference, but when he told us it would be $6 extra, even without the fries, she decided against it. That would be $16 (pre tax & tip) for a sandwich, some rice and beans (no drink). That may not be outrageous, but it is definitely too damn much, no matter how good the sandwich may have been. In fact, as odd as it sounds, you can only get rice & beans one of two ways: order one of their 6 or 7 entrees (not sandwiches) or pay the additional $6. I don't understand why a Cuban restaurant would want to make a major Cuban staple so difficult for customers to eat. It's like a southern restaurant trying to charge almost double to get mashed potatoes with your meatloaf. It just doesn't make any sense to me. So, that being said, their sandwiches are really, really good, but their not-very-customer-friendly policies will probably keep us away most of the time.",J6Jz3UXH1oab79JShMaLGw,1,0,3,gYET8tgLEsOHb4ZzKWgyAg

5326496,2014-05-28,1,gTlKDwjfiNvCc5mnl8p1NQ,"A good friend of mine and Elite Yelper once told me that he doesn't review a place until the second visit, assuming the place earns a repeat visit that is. I usually do the same but I'm thinking this place is so good I'll review now. 

THE DIGS: Its nestled in a shopping strip across the street from the Mini dealership to the east of the Carmax on W. Sahara. and can be hard to miss easily. We actually ran into trying to use the parking lot to make a u-turn. It's a very clean a airy place. Much cleaner than could be expected for a restaurant in that shopping strip. As soon as you walk in the atmosphere is festive with authentic Cuban and tropical music playing. They have a small stage toward the back and it looks like at night they move some tables and make way for a dance floor which I thought was pretty cool. The bathrooms are very clean and looked like they're serviced frequently. 

THE SERVICE: The host was very welcoming and attentive. He provided just the right amount of attention to all patrons and was fair and equal in treatment with everyone. He was friendly and helpful, professional  and moved with a purpose. He wore authentic Cuban attire and you can tell it's how he dresses daily. The food came out fast and it was still nice and hot.

THE FOOD: Excellent, authentic, delicious, hot, well seasoned, well presented. Very tasty. The servings are perfect and price is right. 

The only reason for the 4 stars is well, there's always room for improvement. In this restaurants case, it's the location and the layout/set up of the establishment itself. The seating seems to be a bit limited, but as good as this place is I don't think it will get packed because not too many people know about it.",3MwccEgTNoXgc-en9e7Qzw,4,4,4,s8P48FVAunSm8g5KL8A9yA

Sandwhich was huge and delicious. The fries were about a handful or less and they were bland. Ordered the Mame smoothie drink. That was very good  but tastes more milky than fruity. The check in for 25% off your total that is advertised through Yelp they do not honor. Apparently there is a new owner and he happened to be the server too. He was friendly and polite. Nice music playing in the background. Apparently there's a live band and dancing on the weekends. Definitely want to check that out one day. The prices are decent. My total was only 14 bucks. Aside from small booths and tables along with a few minor things I mentioned i can't really find anything major to complain about. I'd recommend.,eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,2,1,4,EmLNh6MdGrbq2k9MIWnA4A
