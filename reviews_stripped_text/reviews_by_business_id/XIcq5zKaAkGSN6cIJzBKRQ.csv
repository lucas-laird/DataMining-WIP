523140,2017-02-19,0,XIcq5zKaAkGSN6cIJzBKRQ,Bad service and food at all times. I tried giving them the benefit of doubt and try them again today at 4 pm.  If the foods bad at 4pm it will always be bad. I tipped the cashier a dollar and she still didn't get the sauces on the side and slammed window in my face before I had a chance to  check or say anything. I tried at lunch at  noon a week ago and it was the same. I think they are on the way out of biz. Prices raised and quality went down by far. I was my favorite.,RDBgZu_UTRW-qROG74OkeA,0,1,1,KwWj299eFcQ7hJWhf3hiaA

Now, if we could find similar food at a similar price but served on real plates with real silverware, that would be great.

I am always greeted when I walk in and they don't hesitate to cook fresh food if I don't like what I see.The managers have all been great, I just wish one would stay a little longer. Diana is super nice and so is Rae. I think its a hidden gem, its rarely crowded like the others and I get extras from time to time.",9R79EddSWMgfP2FXqLHW0A,0,0,5,ssNKd-3aWIUBN_fBhHiYwg

One the first visit there were several vehicles ahead of me.  On another visit I was the lone customer and rolled right in.  On my most recent visit, I ordered up what I had previously....a chow mein bowl with honey walnut shrimp.  Delicious!  The person at the other end of the squawk box was friendly enough on both visits.  What makes this purely a three star experience (based on an average) was my experience today.  Everything was rolling smooth.  Upon paying for my order, I was asked if I wanted any sauce.  I appreciated this and asked for chili sauce.  My request was repeated back to me...thus acknowledging my request.  Transaction accomplished, I was off to a corner of an adjacent parking lot to enjoy my meal.  When I settled down, I realized my chili sauce had been replaced with soy sauce. WTF?!  I thought about driving back, but decided against it.  Maybe my pleasant server was clueless or maybe she decided to amuse herself and f*&$ with me.  Either way...I had no time for either.  The food was superior (fast food wise) but the portion size and price had be wondering if I has been F'ed.  May I will return, may I will just order a regular one item with side.  Who knows!!",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,5,3,gFebxE13CVEmmxAPTAv3xw

The best part about this particular PE is that it has a drive-thru open until 10pm.  Try to sneak in a minute past that, and they won't answer; not even to tell you they're closed. *shoulder shrugs* I drive past this specific one on my way home from Church on Thursday nights and I almost always get a craving for it.

Big meal choice: Noodles, Mandarin Chicken, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Crispy Beef PLUS Cheese Rangoons ;x

Small meal choice: Panda bowl with Honey Walnut Shrimp.

Not the best Chinese food in town, but then again, Chinese food has always felt and tasted so greasy to me. When I'm up for a cheat night for some Chinese, PE is my go-to. I'll come back when I feel like throwin down the calories on a late night tip!",bTTZzC8RvTxTOeGMvJ5icQ,1,1,3,zW4PIi9Z1VPPEVlEof07Qg

Between the two of us, we had mushroom chicken, teriyaki chicken and orange chicken.  Boy are we paying for it today!! I did call to tell them this morning and a manager is supposed to call us later. I would be surprised if we were the only ones affected. We went through the drive through around 9:30pm last night (husband works nights) and by 8am, he was heaving at work and I was heaving at home.

2848552,2017-03-31,0,XIcq5zKaAkGSN6cIJzBKRQ,"I'm struggling to give this particular Panda Express a 3 star. There is no consistency when it comes to food quality, care of customer, or the staff. 
There are times I love coming in. Greeted in a friendly manner, the food portions and quality I expect, and I can be in and out. Other times, the lady at the front can be extremely rude, including getting mad at my friend because he  asked her for a different item then he just said (the usual, changed mind before she even plated the food). 
I've gone there to have varying portion sizes, majority too small from other Panda Expresses, cold, dry food, and sometimes burnt! 
Until quality hits some consistency, I would say find another store to go to.",XldVMNlrDQ5zLW8zbDbwfQ,0,1,3,dCZrdbFGeSiGjwRXci_Axg

So disappointed about that.  i'm not sure why they no longer sell it because the employees don't seem to know themselves.  I do love the fact they offer free samples so you can see if you will like it before you order it.  I do wish the prices was a little cheaper but you can get 2 meals out of a 2 item combo.

The store was being cleaned while we were there and was in great condition. The drink area was stocked and cleaned and also being serviced during our visit. 

We ordered a three item combo with orange chicken and beef and broccoli along with a child's meal with beef and broccoli too. We were rung up and the second cashier was very attentive to us and talked with us, but our cashier was short and ton the point. She did not give the receipt to me and as their coupon offered for Chinese New Year was put in the bag it fell out. I asked her for it as she went to help the next guest and wandered away like Im done with you go away. Or maybe because only spent 13 and some change at the register. They did not even ask me to donate the change. The inconsistent with this Panda are obvious but the second cashier nice smile and service made it better for 5 star.

Since it opened. Last night 8/8/2016 was my LAST TIME EVER!! The quality of the good had been degrading slowly. The food last night was almost inedible. The noodles were dry and chopped up so small that you almost didn't know they were noodles, tasteless! The  Orange honey walnut chicken was pasty with no resemblance to an orange taste at all! I also ordered a chicken egg roll, which was dry and overdone, almost a burnt taste!

Don't get me wrong, the place is clean, and the staff is courteous, just not the best and brightest. On more than one occasion, even as I am repeating my order, the same older, Asian lady messes up my order. I'll order Sweet Fire Chicken, and she still gives me Orange Chicken. Then *I* feel bad for her mistake, because I feel it may be a language barrier issue or something like that, so I don't correct her and just eat what I don't order. 

Many times I've gone in there and the food looks old, wilted, and tough. The rice is usually hard, and so are the chow mein noodles. It's just not the best quality for Panda's standards.",yPFB_NuRX4W_nAkxnTKxhQ,0,0,2,6NCswSHq7Q5V7F79AVzyvA
