7793,2017-05-01,0,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,This was by far a VERY uncomfortable experience. We came here to be entertained not haressed every 5 mins for lap dances and when we declined the guys got pissed off looks on their faces. They were like vultures circling their Prey except for one male stripper that was actually polite & respectful. Thank you Rebel for being a gentelman & for the memorable lap dance. (Rebel & our waiter - I would give 5 stars.....the rest not so much). I'm not a prude by any means but this was too much...I at on point had to tell one of the strippers to back off because he was making me uncomfortable and he still continued to massage my scalp & kiss my hand/arm.

Be careful of the bait-and-switch for private dances. The management staff would rather have an extensive argument with their patrons regarding the bait-and-switch problem. (e.g. not taking responsibility for the sales techniques of their girls by saying ""They are independent contractors and they (the management) have NO CONTROL over what they do and say"". That's such a convenient cop-out that I heard it from more than one manager there. It sounds like the management has no control of what the girls do there (hmmm..) unless, of course, it's something that may cost them money then their story changes real quick!",wkgywRYov-7Ou03TLZdUCA,4,0,1,Kew-ERII9cJHXlH2BCv9gw

I was with a group of friends and we decided to go. The ""promotor"" said that the entrance was free plus 2 free drinks. We got there and was said that we had to pay ""taxes"" which was $35 each to get in. We did recieve a voucher of 2 free drinks. But when I asked for a blacklabel the blond bartender said that it would be more $ for that drink. The place was way full. I could hardly find a place to stand. There were a lot of girls but they werent that great looking. The third round was about an $15 drink so... bring lots of money. I totally understand that in a strip club you have to spend alot of money (I get it) but why the hell do the promotors act like if I'm getting a major discount and then surprise us with charging us at the entrance? Be honest people.... the drive there and back felt kinda unsafe. Beer bottles on the floor. No seat belts. Driver driving extremely fast. I do wished they had better music.

There were all different types of girls here, but barely anyone came up to us at all. I believe we asked two girls to come talk to us and they were very nice and gave us dances and introduced us to a friend who also gave a dance. We went up to the stage to ask girls to come up to us. I am not used to have to beg women for attention at a strip club! 

The club itself is nice and spacious, if they actually had girls walk around the entire club and not congregate in the back of the club, it would actually be just as good as spearmint rhino. We left after feeling frustrated that we could not get any girls to come up to us.

There were several couples in there so i was happy that they were welcoming to women. The black dancers in there are very friendly. Can't speak on the white or asian ones because they ignored us.",tMrJ0w9CSoB98BDHPYHMyA,2,0,3,hgteTc9Bb-xjlabH3fmVmQ

I understand some of the dancers are cut throat but I expected more of a laid back feel in the restaurant especially for the prices we paid.

352522,2017-07-24,1,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"Overall, not a bad place. During conferences, I've gone every night for 3-4 nights straight. The atmoshere is very nice and plenty of space and seating. Some nights are less busy but there is still a mix of hot and not so hot girls. Many are pretty friendly and not too pushy. There are always those who are in every club including this one. This is not the problem with this club though. Dances on the floor are about $20 but upselling to go upstairs for a private dance is common. This wouldn't be bad if they told you that the dances are ~3 for $100. Although this is not bad and pretty standard in most clubs it seems, some girls want to charge more. One year I was told $150 for 15 minutes, another time I was told $200 for $15 minutes. Then I was also told $250 or $500 for 30 minutes. So...what is the price? From what I can see, definitely depends on the girl. Oh, and they forget to tell you there is a 2 drink minimum once you get up there. That will cost AT LEAST $20-30, if not more. Expect to spend probably $200 just to go upstairs. If not for this extra cost, it wouldn't be a bad club. Maybe other clubs are like this, but in my experience, this is not the case. Lap dances upstairs can be very, very good depending on the girl but if course that varies by the girl. Some girls may upcharge even once you are upstairs (I will only get topless if you pay another $100). My suggestion is get a dance on the floor first, see what the girl is up to and what she says it will cost before going upstairs. 

I'd recommend this club if you are okay with the upcharging and are willing to spend quite a bit more for privacy in the dances. It's not a bad place and the girls can be better than I've seen in other clubs.",74-vM7fXLbcWnz48hJ_txg,2,1,3,aO88u056UDk46VFk0lwGjw

451560,2016-03-08,6,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"Come on guys! I came from LA with my lady, were in our late 20's. Limo picks us up for free and were at the joint, Whoops! I had a knife in my pocket, slide it to the doorman with a 5$ tip and we are in the door... Big surprise everyone, yes it's 35$ per person and you get 2 drink tickets. NOW LISTEN TO THIS PART! It's Vegas, therefore it's expensive. We all know this. For Christ's I bought a pack of cigs at my hotel for 15 bucks! But in the club my jack and cokes are 17 bucks (and for the love of god JUST GIVE THEM THE 20 and get back to the business at hand! THE GIRLS YOU DOPE!) I digress, so... 2 drinks come with each cover, so that's 34$ effectively voiding your ""cover"" and don't forget that free ride you just stepped out of. For the 2 of us, that's 70 at the door and I use my card, I sign the receipt and the counter lady says ""In Vegas you ALWAYS fill out your receipts"".. That's a great tip! Slap a couple bucks on the tip line, shoot her a smile and were in the club.. We grab a table next to a rather boisterous group ladies and drunk/loud and ""balling out"" guy throwing money around getting loads of attention. Not gonna lie, I hate those guys but after a few lap dances and a few more plumes of singles thrown in the air, I didn't even see him leave. The cocktail waitress is at the table within minutes, and we pass her 2 tickets and I let her know we're gonna burn through these vouchers, pull the required funds from the ATM, and yes that's a pricey endeavor so be forewarned. Loaded up and walking back to the ticket i look my lady and see that she's looking at a dancer and the dancer is looking back at here. So far friendly to ladies, I sit down, hand some cash to my lady who in turn lays them out on the rail. At the end of her dance, I see a smile exchanges and a minute later Georgia sits down and introduces herself. The cocktail waitress sees that were polished off the first of our included drinks and 2 fresh ones hit the table. FIRST LESSON PEOPLE! The waitress is there, the dancer is there OFFER THE WOMAN A DRINK! Including the tip to the waitress, and a drink for our girl, I part with a even 20 and PRESTO. You have just established that you are not a cheapskate back-row peeper, WERE HERE TO HAVE FUN. I'll be completely honest and brief from here on out. I lost count of drinks for my lady and I, and encouraged my lady to spread a stack of singles around where she saw fit. I am somewhat aware that i have parted ways with somewhere in the realm 250 dollars. That's penny's is this town, and YOU KNOW THAT.  I decline an initial dance but offer Georgia a 20$ for the chatting and looking her up and down for a good 15 minutes. All 3 of us are smiling and she's leaves her drink at our table and tells us she will be back after this song. These girls are at work guys. There job is to like you and make money, be a man and meet them half way just like you would anywhere else. Ultimately we have a great time, we decide to go upstairs for a thrilling private dance (short but fun) and only do the one round at 100 bucks, 2 slightly higher priced drinks with tips and the next thing you know we wander out at 5AM, pocket roughly 600 dollars lighter. I look to my lady and we have  smiles plastered on our faces... WORTH IT. Sadly the limo guy went home, I collect my pocket knife from the valet and he manages to convince 3 locals to drive us to our hotel in their 70's shaggin-wagon. 10 minutes of laughing and reminiscing with complete strangers and were back on the casino floor buying a bottle and heading to the room. My personal belief is that the shitty reviews come from people who refuse to accept how things work, or have unrealistic expectations. Had we had the energy we would have done it again all over again tonight! Neither of us want to come off as a creep but we both admit wanting to see Georgia 1 more time, but we truly are feeling the effects of 5 nights in Vegas. Maybe if the stars align we will see you again girl! Big shout out to Georgia and the folks over at Treasure. We had a blast and are defiantly coming back. Until next time!

The quality of girls are good . Tried out the VIP again was force against my will . Drinks are pricey & especially in the VIP which the drinks is totally rip-off ! You have to pay for 2 & you'll be lucky if the waitress gives you back your change so you pretty much get ripped-off twice ! Girls here can get money hungry so they always try to get you to do VIP which pretty much the same dances you get from the regular couch dance .

2. Drinks are$28 for a DOUBLE WHISKEY AND 7UP. If you ask for anything bigger they charge extra and if you ask for a simple double rum and coke they charge you extra and it's not even a decent double.
3. The bartender tried to stiff me on my drink by asking for my drink ticket when he already took it. Then instead of admitting his mistake acted like I was the one being a dick.
4. Do not make this your first strip club. Even with the ""free"" limo service it's going to cost you 3-10 times what you should be spending. Go to another club. Pay your cover. Enjoy a reasonably priced drink instead of having your cover hidden in the drink cost.

693791,2015-02-01,4,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"A rather cliche Las Vegas gentleman's club. Great architecture, viable and diverse crowd of ladies and bouncers dressed like broad, tuxedo masks. 
  Was brought here with my friend and fiancée by limo after a rather fun encounter with a promoter, which overall was part of the experience, but to judge the club itself by it merits, let us break it down. 
Pros: 
      *Great service for me and my fellow interlopers. Perhaps it was the female in the party, whom enjoys the womanly figure, but the girls seemed to really enjoy our business. 
      *The girls were kind and attentive, perhaps too attentive at some times. (explained later). 
       *Diversity is always a good thing in a club of this nature. Some were foreign, some were domestic, some were older and some were young. While some may have one, specific demographic in mind, I myself enjoy all the unique qualities the opposite gender possesses. 
       * It has food. While this is alien to me it is nice to have access to food. Steak was overdone a tad but it is difficult to complain in such a setting. 
       * Great seating. At least, when I was there, I bet it can get crowded during busy season. 
       * Music was as diverse as the women who danced to them.
Cons: 
       *Fabricated circumstances; the promoters and the door men seemed to have different stories regarding costs. While I was promised I'd get in for free, it became clear as we arrived that the only one getting in without cost was the girl in our party. They wanted 40$ per person but I implore you that you negotiate this if you mention the promoters offer. They will probably knock down the price to get your business. 
       * It is dark. Really dark. The lighting could use a little more residual image in its wake. You will have difficulty discerning people at a distance. I understand the desire to obscure the feminine imagery but it was a little much. 
        * these girls can be aggressive, and I fear it's because of the income pressures brought on by the vestigial employees. Some are more patient than others, willing to sit and at least talk, but others are far too 1-dimensional in their propositions. They try, vehemently to get you into VIP, which is expensive and comes with a myriad of hidden costs that don't even go to the dancer; this includes tipping the host bouncer, which is ridiculous because he is not the one providing me with service. I prefer to give my money to the hardworking females not the tuxedo clad sentries that stand there broodingly.
      * Expensive drinks. Your average lust inducing beverage is 15$, which is almost a dance without the fun. Come tipsy if you'd prefer not to spend hundreds on drinks themselves, and do not rely on any of the deals the promotors or managers give you because they won't last past 15 minutes.
      * Some dancers aren't as enthusiastic as others. While I was taken care of, my friend noted his particular girl was not as into the fantasy of it all.
      * Overall you will at times feel you are being scammed. I might not be local, but I'm not an idiot either. Be careful of what you ask for and if you want to have fun without wistful regrets, make a plan and remain adamant. 
     
        Treasures has some of just that, but it all comes with a nearly constant pressure and hue of financial foreboding. If you do find yourself here, make sure you have surplus spending money for the inevitable occurrences of extra costs. In conclusion, not a terrible place, and some of the performers are legitimately nice as well as conducive; but at times it feels like you are in front of a slot machine, and a gentlemen's club should never be a gamble.",f5GcSh-E4pTfJF8UX6fdAA,16,6,3,bw_apVUfpOhVWwJbclqIjQ

731000,2008-02-24,1,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"So here's how the Treasures experience shook out for me:
We got free passes from a cabbie that was taking my group from Hard Rock back to the strip and we decided to check it out. The passes said ""Free pickup, free admission, and $10 drink voucher, $30 admission if arriving by limo or other drop off"". We figured there had to be some catch. We ditched our vehicle at a casino and posted up at Vegas Blvd. and Sahara (like 3 minutes from the club) after calling the club to pick us up and hoped to god they would hurry since it was cold out. 20 minutes pass... no driver. We call again and the hostess informed us there was only one driver out right now so she'd get a 2nd one out to pick us up. 20 more minutes roll by and we see the black Excursion drive right past us. The driver calls us to ask where we are, we inform him at the corner of Sahara and Vegas Blvd. He says pick up is normally only from hotels on the strip (something that retard hostess could have told us so we wouldn't be out in the damn cold). He picks us up there anyways and off we go... We arrive and the doorman announces ""2 by limo"". The hostess takes the pass from me and says we have to come with their limo. I politely inform her I did arrive in their ""limo"". She says the driver should have given me this white card (she showed me a sample) that says I came with the company limo. Note that!! If you come with the pass make sure the driver gives you that white slip. She lets us in anyways and we immediately get our drinks. Right off the bat I was impressed with the layout. Not the biggest joint but its laid out real nice with 3 active dance stages and a slew of women working the floor. A little too dark but I guess it's necessary since a few of the girls were cottage cheese grade and a few were old looking (late 30's to early 40's) but a nice handful of attractive ladies. As I walked in I immediately spotted the girl I knew I was destined to be with for the evening. A nice busty (though they were implants) 5'3 Asian girl with a nice solid body. I grabbed her hand and told her to follow me as I made some change (damn casinos and their large bill payouts). I sat her on my lap and after a brief get to know each other session she got to work on me. Man I was punch drunk with lust instantly. She had some pretty good moves and she got my soldier at attention in record time. I tell her to go for a bit but to swing back in about 1/2 hour since I wanted to check out the rest of the talent. Nothing I saw peaked my interest, many of the girls at that time either had small boobs or nice bodies with a face only mom could love. One slender apparently mixed black+? came and pushed my chair and said hey youngster, you cant handle this. I informed her that's because I had no interest in handling her. She took off and a very busty blond that had my buddy's attention walked past so I motioned for her to come and dance for him, my treat. I'm enjoying the show when boom! aggressive mixed chick comes and pushes my chair and straddles me (apparently upset I called over blondie for my buddy but I rejected her). She says you're getting a dance, ok? I was a bit amused by her ambush so I said go ahead and do your thing, I think you're all talk and no fucking bite anyway. Prove me wrong. She gave me the worst lap dance of my life! My dick couldn't have gotten more flaccid or smaller if I had just gotten out of a cold ass pool. 1/2 way through she asked if I wanted her to keep going I said hell no, I didn't even let her take her top off. She still wants to be paid for her 1/2 assed performance so I give her the $20 just to avoid problems with the bouncers. Along comes my sexy Asian siren to redeem the evening. She asked if I was having fun and I proceeded to point at miss attitude and told her she was the worst lap dance of my life. She smiles coyly. I said lets go get a private room so we proceeded to the ""private"" area which is really a dark side of the club just slightly higher than the main floor but with a high enough privacy wall to not share your show with others. The deal for that area is $100 for 3 songs or $260 for 1/2 hour.  My fantasy girl got to work on me and immediately got me erect. She seemed to enjoy that too as she gave it lots of attention with many parts of her body... I was timid at first but she quickly gets me involved placing my hands on her breasts and down her sexy body to her waist and onto her ass. It was as if God designed this woman just for me. She started moaning softly as I gently kissed her neck... Anyways. the rest of that time in the private room is my business. But know that I was NOT disappointed and I was glad to have invested my new found money that the wonderful casino so generously lost to me at the craps table from my $100 original investment turning into thousands for all. Great end to my Vegas adventure!!",tMQr8-ccTeRWD_ihNp2OvQ,2,0,3,mi51D9Btc-3t68j8vPHDGw
745477,2014-11-08,1,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,Girls are average at best. Promoters are pushy and demand a tip even though they are being paid for you to go in. Dances are same as UK but with a little bit of grinding this applies to upstairs dances. Not worth the money. 100 dollars mysteriously disappeared from my wallet and not in a good way. Got caught up in a dispute between waitress and dancer about a missing tip. Waitress said dancer had taken tip i left even though i left it on card. Managements suggest solution was i tip another 10 dollars which i refused to do. This place is best avoided completely.,uB-T1ggIlfB5fJMIZbICyw,0,0,1,X4KFSNMZXlo_c9qnnOiQdQ

You rarely see a well done dark baroque style strip club in this town let alone anywhere else.  The steak restaurant section of the place is very nice with a top end steak menu that is close what you expect from Morton's or Ruth Chris.

Then there's who's inside the place.  Went to the steak restaurant and immediately, was hit up by a dancer sitting with me.  The waitress (she looked like the house mother of the place) immediately suggested the top end meal without any introductions.  Not even a mention of a daily special.  After the meal, I hit the main floor into the gaggle or girls working the place.  

These girls are worked hard by management.  From that, the girls are biting back.  One manager criticized a girl right in front of me for not ""rotating"" enough and just sitting and talking with me.  That should be done away from customer's view.  Also, whenever I refused a dance from a girl, they were either sarcastic, bitter or angry.  A good girl working strip clubs should walk away with a smile and then cuss out out of our view.  

Also seeing signs that says ""Prostitution is Illegal"" almost every twenty feet was a turn off.  I can only guess is this place was busted or cleaned out recently.  Found one girl and had a few dances plus a VIP.  She pressed way too hard in the VIP room and almost left before my time was up over it.

Suffice that there are many pitfalls to place this huge ...

- Drinks are weak and overpriced.
- Some dancers are true hustlers.
- Staff is trained to extract your $$$.
- No R&B or hip hop played after 8pm.

Each time was by happenstance ... a guy approached a
couple of us on the strip offering a free limo and cover.
Each time I'm on my way back to the hotel just to sleep.

$25 Cab ride
Damn this place is far. We get out of the cab and this place looks cool. Okay fine, we go in cause there's nothing else around and the cab took off already.

$30 Cover charge
Umm okay...so I guess it's Tit's THEN steak? I guess. After paying cover we're escorted into the empty Restaurant portion of the joint...um what? The ""waitress"" tells us not to worry, she'll have a few girls come over and give us some attention. We tell her not to worry cause we're hungry for Steak more than Tits at this point. So she laughs and gets our drink orders....5 minutes go by..10...I'm gonnd look at boobies..15 minutes..WTF did she go to Ireland for my Guinness? Oh there she is! 

She takes our food order...all menu items are ala carte...we all ordered steaks and there was no choice as to the size of the portion we ordered but they were all HUGE the filet mignon being the smallest 18oz!!!! But that shit cost $62!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!!!!!?!!!!! I got a 24oz $48 Rib Eye and the ""Waitress"" says the portions of sides are pretty big and 1 order should be fine for us all. So we just got:$15 Mashed Potatoes and
$15 Sauteed mushrooms....hopefully it's a huge portion of sides. Plus 2x $12 Guinness. 

So with our orders placed after about 5 minutes the ""waitress"" brings out some cold bread and butter...our 2nd round of drinks arrives about 10 minutes after we'd ordered them...keep in mind the Food part of this place is empty...We dig into the bread cause we're hungry as hell....

10 minutes later the beer shows up. 
We check out boobs...
5 more minutes...Oooh look that one has got cellulite!....
+10 minutes....*watches old man dry sexin a stripper doggy style*....friend says,""I smell fish or...is that blood?"" Back to the table we go.
+20 sitting at table talkin....coulda did this at the room...minus the fishy/blood aroma where we walked by.

""Didn't the ""Waitress"" say she was going to send some entertainment over to our table?""
""Yeah."" 
""Uhh k?""

+5 Food comes ""HOLY SHIT!!!"" Huge meat is placed in front of each of us who had ordered. It was good too....wait...""who ordered the baby shoe sized portion of potatoes and shrooms???"" Fuck it...we eat.

Minutes later, we're all so stuffed we can't walk. The majority of us at the table are straight up carnivores that destroy buffets But damn. This amount of food, so late at night which is placed atop several pints of beer, shots of liquor and who knows what else, isn't good at a strip joint.

We finished eating, pay $685 for 6...yes...$685 for 6...so dumb. Then we go and sit in a corner to chill. After a while a girl comes over and sits on my in process 24oz steak....

""I'm sorry, but no...please. Get off.""
""What are you broke?""
""No I'm FULL."" 

This happened to a couple more of us and we leave. When Steak ruins tits it's never a good thing. Treasures needs to balance their portions...I'll let you decide on what to make smaller your women or your steak, I like my girls with meat...so yeah please take the hint.",zjwO_sICRWDAca3d1mMxmw,27,13,1,4AB7gp1P4TQ4jrQswMb9vw

My New York Steak was nothing overly memorable but was definitely Steakhouse quality. The meat was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly to a medium rare sear. I barely touched my baked as I put all my effort into finishing my steak. Unfortunately, the steak won and my jaw was beat. My friend also enjoyed her dinner, but we could not move as our food coma started to take over.

If you like strip clubs and steak, this is your place. The interior aesthetics are very brothel-like with lots of velvet. The chairs at the dinner tables are big and comfortable and don't help against the cause. The dinner area and strip club are in separate rooms but less than a 15 second walk, as they are in adjoining rooms. My friend and I had an early dinner (8pm), which meant the strippers weren't out in full force. I was a little bummed, but I was ready for a post-coma nap anyways.

Note: Unless you want to pay $10 for a diet coke at dinner, I suggest sticking to water.

I'm not really caring at this point until it hit me I'm going to be charged 10 for 20 dollars ughh PLEASE bring cash the ATM will kill your pockets as well. Women's bathroom ..,.

The strippers are freaking amazing and the lap dances are so much better ;). They offer you quality drinks for just a little bit more with the drink tickets and their drinks are very strong.

2037086,2009-08-24,10,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"Billed as ""the most luxurious gentlemen's club"" in Vegas, Treasures definitely tries to live up to its name. I showed up on a Thursday night for a bachelor party and were greeted with a $30 cover, which is pretty much standard for Vegas. We were able to sit immediately and drinks were procured at the bar. 3 Jamesons on the rocks = $39. 2 shots of Patron = $40. I guess ""luxurious"" means ""ridiculously expensive."" 

While the girls were nice (not pushy, not mean) and the staff was too, I couldn't get past how insanely overpriced the booze was. Even the Heinekins were, like, $12 or $14 (I can't remember because at that point I simply stopped looking, because the only way to enjoy myself was to pretend like I wasn't getting raped by the bartender every time I was thirsty). 

Overall, it's an alright club. Not a single girl on stage did anything other than strut around (disappointing when you're from Portland and the girls here do insane pole acrobatics) so there's ZERO reason to sit at the rack. Drink before you go, or maybe go for the bottle service? I generally avoid bottle service, but the drinks are so expensive that it might be worth it. You're better off showing up toasted or smuggling in a flask. 

This is definitely not my first choice for adult entertainment in Vegas unless someone else is footing the bill. The level of ""luxury"" they offered me (standard strip club chair, standard strip club table, same drinks as anywhere else) is not worth the luxury price I paid. Maybe if a high-roller is rolling with me footing the bill, I'd be into it.

Okay, I remember a limo picking us up at some point and my friends brother yapping about how we should go here.  It was wayyyy to late in the night or early in the morning I should say to be thinking clearly.  My friends brother picked up a friend from Bellagio who happens to be a dancer for Cirque du Soleil ""O"".  She was just getting off work for the night.   Funny thing was that I had met her before a long time ago in SJ but just couldn't put a face to a name.  

Entry was like $25-30 once we got there, game face was on and I was ready to tastefully throw around some money for my friends B-day.  Got in and the place was dark and a bit small in my opinion.  It looks so much larger from the highway for some reason ahaha.  It is two levels, so we ventured up to an open table up there.  I think a Asian stripper came up to me and started to ask me about the girl we were with, lol.  If you go to a strip club, bring a girl cause it will always attract more attention. There was something very hot about watching our female friend get some freaky lap dances from the strippers... I might have even bought her a dance I don't really remember :-P  I bought my buddy a lap dance from the Asian stripper who kept trying to hustle me.  Terrible I can't even remember what her face looked like; although it was dark and I was prob. partially drunk.  -----(this is why I'm a photographer ***)

Had a lot more fun once we went downstairs to the main stage.  My friends brother had a whole stack on ones for the dancers.  We found a table right next to the stage luckily and we immediately got service from the sexy servers.  I noticed all the guys around us kept starting.... probably cause we were the only group that had brought one girl with us haha.  My friend starting throwing around some ones, and I think I usually enjoy the main stage most at strip clubs because of the lights and music.  I think my friends got me a couple lap dances but I can't even remember the strippers now, LOL.  I don't remember how much money I spent that night but it wasn't absurd.  You really don't need to spend a ton at a strip club to have fun IMO.  

Things I hate are the douches who smoke and get out of control around the main stage.  Security is pretty good though at most places if anyone gets out of line, they will boot their asses out.  I had fun b/c of the group of people I were with were down to party and have fun.  Albeit I have been to much better strips clubs with sexier girls and better interior so I'll have to stop this one at a 3 star rating.  I likely will not be back to this specific strip club whenever I'm back in Vegas. 

I felt like our service might have been above average...  or better than most of the other guys who were hanging out here.  Our server was pretty attentive to our table and made sure we had all the drinks we needed.  By the time we left the sun was coming up; I haven't ever stayed up that late in Vegas before and time really  does fly when you're having fun haha.",gUhL_vkTY_zwrzT71a73Bw,0,0,3,XxquS7aCKRUc0P-E1EYpFQ

Too bad two drinks is almost the same price as entry, $40 per person. You get in and the strippers immediately want to get you to buy a dance. $20 per dance, about 5-10 min. Then they'll try their hardest to get you to a private room, which is anywhere from $250-600+. If you don't have cash, the ATM fee is $10. I was there for 30 minutes and spent $150 for myself and my girlfriend. The limo drivers will also tell you that they go by tips. ""The free limo stuff is BS"", is what he told me.

In short, bring lots of cash before you go. Drinks will break your bank. Do not let them have your card information. The place was nice. I didn't eat any food.

Also while initial stage they tell you that the pick up and drop is included in the cover, but during the night when you are leaving, you have to wait for an hour before you get a drop and that is also not guaranteed. Also the manager & staff shirks responsibility when asked to arrange the drop off.

Food:  Fantastic!  Treasures was classy and their steaks were on par with some of the high end steakhouses that I had in the past.  Steak prices ranged between 40-70 dollars and sides are separate.  They also had a huge lobster tail and filet mignon special for $65.  Even if you're not down for titties, I would recommend coming here for dinner.

Girls:  Better than average.  My friends argue that Spearmint has the best girls but I say that's only because they have more to pick from.  On an average basis, I think Treasures wins.  The venue is much more luxurious compared to Spearmint and it's less crowded.  If you want to get titty slapped with class, Treasures is the way to go!

Another word of advice, call their limo service to save on cover charge.  702-259-GIRL.  We didn't know about the free cover if they pick you up, so my friends and I ended up paying $30 each...which could have gone to another 10 lap dances.",VH-sP1PAuwi8_gebVxpg1A,11,3,3,JhSnD3HHv4vP4n2dIAiDSA

2557727,2009-07-18,23,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"I guess getting old isn't all bad.

The last of my college buddies was getting married, and being the smartest one of the lot, he chose to skip the pomp and circumstance of a conventional wedding and got married in Vegas.  As the best man, I offered to take everyone out to Treasure's for one last party.

Now we're not youngsters anymore.  Gone are the days when our money would run out before our desire to drink.  A late night now is anything after 11 pm.  Now we make plans, rather than fly only by the seat of our pants.

The plan - Steak and naked chicks.  Some things don't change with age, but now I can afford them.  

Planning also involves research, and said research turned up 2 for 1 dinner coupons at the steakhouse.  2 for 1 here meant anything on the menu would be 1/2 price - much better than getting the cheaper dinner for free.  Using a coupon in a strip club sounds cheezey but hey saving $20 is a table dance, 2 drinks or 20 singles for g-string stuffing.  Since there were 4 of us, those coupons worked out to be $80 worth of dances, drinks, and stuffing singles.
 
Research also indicated that Las Vegas has a unique taxi to strip club policy that requires big kickbacks to the cab drivers that bring in customers.  The clubs recoup that cost with their cover charge.  Since I drove, we all got in for free.

We also arrived around 7 pm.  It's not prime strip club time, but it is dinner time.  It could also explain the free admission.  Either way, we got into the club without paying the $120.  That's even more table dances, drinks and throwing around money.  Being old just netted us $200 worth of entertainment.

Despite my research, I expected a typical gentleman's club that had mediocre steaks that would be served at your table, or tucked away in a far corner of the club.  I couldn't of been more wrong.

The Steakhouse is a full blown steakhouse.  From the steakhouse you wouldn't even know there was a Strip club attached.  The music didn't bleed through.  The waitress was sexy but not anything you couldn't see in a casino.  The Steak was huge, the Lobster Tails were bigger than my hand, and 2 sides served all 4 of us, with leftovers.  Even when I was 22, a 28 ounce porterhouse was more than I needed to eat.  If Treasures was just a steakhouse, it would warrant 4 or maybe even 5 stars on it's own, even from a crotchety old fart like myself.

OK, I'm not really an old fart, but I finished college 20 years ago.  And I am crotchety.

The strip club side was nice.  The women weren't top tier, but it was still very early by night club standards, and a Monday night.  The majority of the dancers were about 30-32 years old, and naturally stacked.  Somehow, this is more appealing to me than an 18 year old that already has implants. If you're 22, you might prefer the younger girls, but when you are planning to celebrate your 39th birthday *again* the 32 makes you feel a little less perverted.

The dancers were unusually friendly.  I suspect this was also a function of the time/day issue.  With fewer patrons, the women could just hang without feeling they were missing out on better paying patrons elsewhere.  We also appeared to be closer to the dancer's age, so a decent conversation (no generation gap) could take place.

Strip club experiences can be all over the map, from 1-5 stars depending on the hormones and the expectations of the reviewer.  Both of mine are much lower now, but excellent value steak and lobster never change.  I wouldn't mind going back, but at my age I have to worry about looking like the creepy old guy you always see in strip clubs.",cMAiTrM0Fxm8vKLQag53jg,34,16,4,O9uZPzktkCyh4tVO0ZpmJQ

To me this is really more of a strip club than a true ""gentlemens club"".   Put it mildly, there weren't alot of real gentlemen in here (unlike a very fancy and expensive gentlemen's club I visited once in Dallas).

Anyway, the cheesy decor is  kinda funny.    Got their a little early (I think between 7-8pm?)  in order to miss the cover charge and take advantage of happy hour drinks...basically  2 for 1.
The club is topless only...typical first song drops the booty shorts down to a thong, second song off comes the top.  One main stage plus 1-2 side stages seemed to be working.  None of the ladies I saw could work a pole to save their lives...too bad.  I have a client that teaches pole dancing classes.  It takes alot of skill and I like to reward the ladies who can do it.

Yes, the girls are aggressive about hitting you up for a lapdance ($20) or a trip to the champagne room ($150+).   Aren't they all in Vegas (or pretty much any good club?...mgmt hires hustlers).  

I took my time to find a lady who was fun and took a trip upstairs.  Early in the evening seems to be (as a friend joked once) C-section hours...basically your single moms.  Later seemed to be the top girls.  I'm told Vegas primetime strip club hours are basically 10:00pm to 6am.  I didn't stick around into the wee hours so I can't offer much advice on that.  Anyway, I had a very good time.  
Definitely not as good as some clubs in the Atlanta, Dallas or S.FL areaas  (as someone else noted) but WAY better than Southern Calif. area clubs.

I had the filet mignon and it was delicious and perfectly cooked medium. The steak was so tender you barely need a knife. It was a typical steakhouse where you had to order the sides separately. The side dishes were large enough for two people to share.   The only negative is the steak presentation it was rather plane meat on a plate but to me that's not a deal breaker. I would honestly say this steakhouse is in my top three Las Vegas favorites. 

As for the club it was super clean very nicely decorated with friendly non pushy staff and ladies. I really like that this club was not smoky and must have had lots of smoke eliminating devices because I did not stink like cigarettes when I left. The prices are above average but like anything in life you get what you pay for.",QH9i-p3cvlI8G18PE4aVkA,1,0,5,OAXH_Jw7fqGeuIFQL9Pwmg

I got there by the free limo, which is a limo bus/van with other people inside. When I was on it, I didn't feel rich, I feel like a crimial who's going to jail.

Then I have to pay $35 to buy 2 drinks because I took the limo. So it's not really free limo.

Some girls here are very pushy and only care about money. I hate that. I was with a girl there, and she kept ordering drinks for me, got me super drunk, then she kept asking me to pay... It's Vegas, it's understandable, and the girl did a good job, but I didn't enjoy the paying part.

I didn't really like the showgirls there, most of them are older, not what I expected. and the drinks sucked bad, we paid $25 each for 2 drink tickets, but they were only good for well drinks, light beer, house wine, cheap vodka, yikes! we had to buy better drinks, those drinks were still so bad, I suspect they were watered down or something.

There were very few attractive girls dancing on the stage, they did bring lot of girls upstairs for entertainment, a couple of them tried to give hubby lap dance, but when they saw me, they were like '"" you are so pretty!"" and just ran away!

My husband tells me that he has taken CLIENTS here to the steakhouse and they had a great time here at ""dinner theatre"" LOL. It's our private joke. Usually the fare at these joints is absolute crap no matter what you spend, but the food here was actually good. We must have had the hook up because hubby called this number and a limo pulled up to our hotel pronto! We had an excellent steak dinner with two side dishes and a nice Italian bottle of wine. Our server was this lovely lady from NY. Although dinner was pricey, it was in decent restaurant and you did not feel that you were in a strip club. I was expecting crappy food like hot dogs and chicken fingers, so prime cut steaks cooked perfectly, was a treat. I also got a few chuckles watching some other parties of guys eating with scantily clad ladies. So if you hate eating alone on business, this is the place for you. So after wine, dinner and dessert... we proceeded to the club area.... 

We were escorted to the seating area. There are two stages. The ladies looked fairly good looking. Actually better looking than in the bay area and less pushy. I saw a lot more male/female couples in the audience with a few male posses in the audience. The ladies were doing their lap dances for $20 right on the spot. Pretty decent grinding topless lap dances and you can fondle them. It was nice having drinks served from the bar. Bar service is pricey, but hell this is Vegas. I imagine all you guys are bitching about the prices and all. You can go to SF for soda, $40 cover charge, pushy chicks and lame touching if you are that broke ass!!!!    But while you are here you can also go into the private rooms/private areas for a little more money. We ended up dropping around $600 for dinner, drinks and about a 45 minutes of ""play"" with a very friendly girlie. So I guess the spouse is happy.

Cover charge at 4:30 in the afternoon was $33.00. Almost immediately upon entering you're besieged with hustling bitches trying to shake you down for table dances at twenty bucks a pop. Should you decline, they'll step up their marketing efforts by offering you a package of five dances for only one-hundred dollars. 
God, they're clever. 
I think that works out to, oh wait, twenty dollars a dance.
As I said, clever.

When servers ask for your drink order, they'll also ask how you're going to pay for it, suggesting perhaps you may be homeless and without funds for such a wondrous event. 
The look on your face suggests you're experiencing a wtf moment. 

Cash or credit?"", she annoyingly barks while you're still in disbelief.

Shaken down at the door and now insulted, as if you were going to swill down a beer and beeline it for an awaiting cab without paying.
You reassess if any of this was worth it.

Whether your response is cash or credit, they'll demand payment up front prior to taking the order. I believe this is because, and this is only conjecture mind you, their default statement is to not trust anyone who graces their shit hole establishment for fear they're part shit hole too. 
It's a projection thing I guess.

Don't get suckered into a VIP dance in the back room by one of the many fleeting nubiles promenading about. They're there for one reason; to cajole you to their 'back room'.
If you do get suckered into a back room dance, the fee starts at $100 with a $32 two-drink minimum, again, all paid up front of course. And god help you if you happen to get caught up in the moment - losing count of your five song 'deal'. The sixth song just shot the price up to $250 along with a  $50 two-drink minimum penalty.
It's like being penalized for getting caught up in the music and whirling tits!

You're now knee-deep in the shit, having unwittingly purchased the multi-dance package and guess what? This time, the dancer doesn't shake you down for loot, she waltzes you over to some guy bigger than all outdoors and whose tone of voice is lower than a 30"" subwoofer and whose countenance is that of a Buckingham Palace guard.

""Two hundred fifty bucks pal, how you gonna pay?"" 

I panic.
The eighth song just began playing and I don't know what the rules are. The seventh shot the price from twenty to thirty-five. 
After everything I've seen thus far, I'm thinking they're going to ask me to pony up a nut when song number eight begins playing.
I cut my losses and head for the door.

When you've had enough of their bullshit and want to take a cab back to the hotel, guess what, no cabs. 
Oh there are cabs, a cab line and a valet, but you're not going anywhere - not just yet. 
That's because you'll need to grease the valet, this or else wait in a terminally long line of losers who didn't have money to line the valet's pockets.

Here's what I did.
I saw an off-duty cab about 100 yards from their driveway entrance and started toward it.

""HE'S OFF DUTY!"", the valet shouts. 

""FUCK YOU!"", I respond politely. 

I offered the taxi driver a fifty to take me anywhere as fast as he could. This so I could begin erasing the entire shitty experience out of my memory. 
He declines, saying he'll get in trouble with vah-ray. (Asian)
I make it a Franklin.
"" Hop in, he says.""

Everything about Treasures smells to high heaven, including the plethora of Russian whores in cheap perfume and glitter. 
You'll know who they are immediately.
They speak with the same dialect as that ugly bitch from Rocky & Bullwinkle; Natasha Rotyercockov.

I would only come back here if I won the lottery, buy the place, fire all the bouncers, line up the dancers and make them eat the slop out of their buffet till they puke.",9sldtsoM9MFEyPEss0L9kA,34,15,1,4IGQD6PicZntGy0yXDE6HA

Once upona time, a Joe Pesci actalike hustled me and three of the best human beings I know into a limo and saved us from strip hell.  A cute blonde I knew back then haggled JP (who it turns out knows East Tennessee pretty well) out of a couple extra drinks and promos.  So, at least half of this ???-fated party  claimed to have never darkened the door of a boob bar. The questionableness of that claim notwithstanding, I don't hang with friends who lack impulsivity or are not susceptible to peer pressure given the right proportions of booze, drugs, titillation, or shame.  I may also hang with you if you can be bribed, extorted, blackmailed,  or coerced into letting go of your inhibitions or good judgment.

3335198,2014-10-27,1,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"This is my second review for this establishment... and there is a reason for that... Treasures has VIP customer service down to an art!

My wife and I planned a getaway to Vegas after a grueling 6 months of organizing a large charity event.  A VIP trip to Treasures was to be a cornerstone to that trip.

It did not start off well, however.  I had sent an e-mail with questions about the VIP packages that was never returned.   Finally I called an made reservations for 8 pm  and that that went very well.  Just before 7:pm I received a call from the driver stating he would be there in less then 10 minutes, making him about an hour early.  I told him that my wife was just getting out of the shower and he said that he would wait until 8.  

The limo was a LONG stretch Escalade that was obviously used and a bit worse for ware.  I ASSUMED  that was something they picked up second hand and were going to refurbish, but the driver didn't say anything about gaping holes in the headliner, or bad condition of the upholstery.  The ride itself was TERRIBLE!  The driver has a heavy foot on the gas and the break.  So with hard accelerations and heavy breaking in stop and go Vegas traffic over its legendary potholed roads...   My wife likened the ride to the seen in the Wedding Singer where they are ""trying out"" the limo driver.  When we arrived we were not escorted in as we were before. 

This evening ended nearly before it began.

In the past, we paid up front for our VIP package so pricing was understood.  Not this time.

Now for the good part.  Once inside we were escorted to the restaurant and seated.  The waitress asked if we had been there before and we commented on the great service we had had in the past. Through the conversation we learned that that same waitress was still working there and on duty that night!  The waitress we had relinquished our table to CC who either actually remembered us from two years ago, or did such a great job of customer service that she made us believe that she remembered us!

Service was thorough and prompt.    My wife had the Lobster Bisque which was excellent.  We both had dinner salads which, I have to say had to be the most well presented and tasty dinner salad I have ever had... in a strip club or anywhere else for that matter!  I had the NY steak and my wife had the Filet.  In my previous review I had complained that the quality of the steak was not Treasures claim to 5 star or Prime.  Not this time.  It was both 5 star and PRIME!

After dinner we were escorted into the club.  My wife and I both dress for nights out and I would say that we were better dressed that most of the clientele... as such, we had girls at out table constantly!  It was happening so frequently that we could not hold a conversation!  Drink service prompt, pleasant, and accurate and I was never wondering where our waitress was.  I was happy to leave a significant (30%) tip!  After a while we were approached by Brian the VIP manager and asked of there was anything he could do for us and gave us his card and offered some discounted VIP services in the future. 

Later, as we were leaving, Brian went out front and ordered a limo to take us back to our hotel.  In our past VIP experiences at Treasures, they only brought you to the club, and you had to take a cab back.  This was the first time we got a limo ride back!  The ride back to our hotel was VERY pleasant!  I do not remember the name of the driver, but it was her last day and she was moving back to Texas.  

There is a reason that I am writing a second review for Treasures.  They have customer service DOWN!  Aside from the ride there, they made us feel like we were the most valued customers in the building!  I don't know if CC actually remembered us, but she made us feel like she did.  I am sure that Brian offers his services to a number of their clientele, but he made us feel like we were special.  At the end of the evening, even though we were not going to spend anymore money there, they gave us a limo ride home, and the driver, even though it was her last day and no longer dependent on that job, treated us like we were her favorite clients of the night.  

We are not rich by any means.  We are about as average as you can get.  When planning this trip we wanted the VIP experience and budgeted $400 for this night out.  We received VIP treatment that exceeded our expectations and walked out of there way under our budget.  I am not saying that this place is cheap, or even reasonably priced, but if you plan for it, you can get more than your money's worth!",2xa5FYd6SRxPI9qDkF0N8w,1,1,5,F3xHzlHu6IhW6oeUlilL8Q
3432916,2013-01-15,5,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"This probably should be a one-star review...
The extra stars are only because someone in management/ownership understood I'm not a ""dumb drunk bitch"" and have a brain. 

Went on Saturday night, with thanks to a promoter who was hoping to show 3 girls a good time (two of which were celebrating their 30th birthdays; one of which, was me). 

Promoter told me in advance there would be no cover but a $27 two well-drink minimum (which is paid prior to entering the club). 
Okay, fine. 

We're given receipts (which are also drink tickets). 

After sitting down and getting a feel for the vibe, a server comes over to take our drink order. 
At the same time, another server swooped behind my girlfriend and took her drink ticket(s). 
Original server said she could only serve us 2 drinks for the 3 of us (after we had explained another server just grabbed the tickets without taking an order). 
And, wait a minute, we had 4 additional tickets between 2 of us...?
What just happened here?
Pretty sure 3 chicks x 2 drink tickets = 6 drinks. 

This is where management came in, asking who took the drink tickets and they'd be happy to compensate the next round of drinks. 
That's nice and all, but I already PAID for the SECOND round of drinks. 

Me and my girlfriends decided it wasn't worth staying and asked the front if we could at least receive half of our money back. 
We didn't even take but one sip of our drinks before attempting to walk out and the entire (shady) debacle had me completely on edge. 

Another manager (may have been an owner?) came out to explain there would not be an opportunity for refunds, but he wanted to try to make it up to us. 
Being a business owner, myself, I would want the same opportunity before someone completely gave up on me. 
So we followed him back in and were accompanied by a private table, server and bottle service -- all which were excellent, unexpected and much appreciated. 

Long story short:

-The men who worked there were respectful and helpful. 
-The female servers try to pull wretched shit over other females. 
-The entertainment is so-so (some entertainers were really into it and others were not). 

To any female party interested in checking it out:

My beau went up to a girl to try to get his friend a dance and on his way up, he accidentally dropped his winnings from earlier that night. Before I had a chance to even say anything, a girl ran over and picked it up and ran back to some dude's lap. I confronted her about it and she was about to give it back to me when some senior stripper told me ""any money on the floor is fair game"". And the girl stuck the money back in her purse.

I was having an absolutely amazing time until then. We left right after that, there's no reason to give any more money to thieves.

Thick and juicy...well-prepared, and simply seasoned. The lobster tails were not as good, but still tasty. The service is prompt and quite colorful.  The decor is kind of upscale ""vegas brothel"" but not unbearable. Prices are a little lower than the Strip steakhouses: in the low 40s.

However, there are two areas that ARE irritating.
First, the wine list: it is very modest and obscenely over-priced; 5 times retail in some cases!  A bottle of Siena which can be purchased for around $20 at Lee's Liquor is on the winelist at over $100!!!  It should be about $50 tops.
Second, because the restaurant is connected to the strip club, dancers wander in thinking that diners want their company, which is extremely annoying. Just do what I did and tell them they are not the kind of meat you came there for.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,3,5,3,Dz6wCsW7fRJhk45uRAo5UA

Seriously, this place is a fun spot for a bachelor party or even for couples.  The dancers are very relaxed and aren't all over you for lap dances every second you are in there.

About 98% of the dancers look like lingerie models...the other 2%...well..they should stick to dealing cards at the casinos.

4197390,2009-01-23,53,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"It's true that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Especially what happens at a Vegas bachelor party, but this story is too good not to share.

Last day of my week-long Vegas stag party.  Most of the gang already broke out early in the morning, but half a dozen of us diehards have evening flights home and we're gonna get in one more round of blackjack, Crown Royal and T&A.

Early morning the Rio treated us somewhat nicely at the BJ tables so we had a decent grip of cash to rain with.  About 10am we head out for breakfast, but the limo driver from last night just happens to be pulling up to the curb and recognizes us.  We couldn't say no.

So we had him take us directly to the nearest titty bar.  The only thing open at that time was Treasures so we head over.  1st points in their favor is they comp us the entire cover when they find out it's my bachelor party.  Only thing is, the place is like a freaking funeral home.  No lights.  No music.  No girls.

Us: Is this place really open??
Hostess: Oh yeah, just come on in!

So my boy Hap walks past the entryway into the main room as we follow.  Still, dead silence.  ""What, does this fucking place run on headphones or something?"" he asks.

Hap almost breaks his neck tripping over a big object in the darkness.  Turns out it's a passed out dude.  ""Oh never mind him,"" says the hostess, ""That's Dan.  He's been here since last night.

The fuck?  Whatever.

All of a sudden, the lights turn on, the music starts thumping, we're whisked into plush seats right up against the stage, and a bikini clad blond materializes in my lap like she just came out one of them Star Trek Transporter shits.

Freaking awesome.  I imagine somewhere in the back there's a panel with a switch that says ""Off"" on one side and ""Music, Lights, Tits"" on the other.  Shit was amazing.

We quickly dispatched a bottle of Crown as the girls came crawling out the woodwork and onto the stage.  Good times, although the one single mom attached to my lap was really starting to put me in a deep sleep with her neverending dreams of going back to school.  Luckily, it was eventually her turn to go up onstage.

At one point they put on ""With Arms Wide Open"" by Creed and I jumped on stage and belted out a few lines (with my arms wide open, of course) before the manager came and escorted me down.

As we were about to leave, there was more humor to be had.  A stripper marches into the joint and confronts the manager.  They exchange harsh words and she goes storming off.  A few minutes later Mr. Manager has some security dude go after her.  We go outside to see what's up and girl is a couple hundred yards out, buck nekked except for a bikini top, 5 inch heels and a strip of floss between her legs -- running across the desert in the middle of the day.

Security dude jumps in his pickup and starts coming after her.

She speeds up.

Trips on something.

Eats it, face first.

Fuck, heels must be murder to run in.

p.s.: To Ryan H. - I feel you on the grip of money you burn through at titty bars, but as far as pervs, most people really don't go to these upscale joints 'cause of that.  The pervs get their diddle on at the seedy little local joints.  I'm not a huge titty bar fan, but the fun is in throwing a few dollars around and acting like you got it like that.  Don't nobody really live like that.  Paying double for drinks and cover isn't exactly my idea of a great evening out, but where else can you throw down a few twenties and motorboat a hot gal while she tries to grind your nuts into jelly?",RJ1BpR2vLWZedb68_m6kcA,6,10,4,HBrxiJLsWoGs24KSYogFIw

I've been here twice, and both times I had an awesome meal accompanied by excellent sevice and even excellent-er people watching.  Talk about dinner and a show! 

Treasures is a super-classy faux-baroque McMansion nestled in a cozy industrial area on a frontage road off the freeway. Once you make it past the dago thugs at the door, take a left into the plush, clubby, restaurant, seemingly decorated to evoke Colonel Mustard's drawing room -- white tablecloths and plush wingback armchairs, and a super-cool ultra-Vegas lady server with a raspy New York accent and a brusque yet affectionate tableside manner.  The chef apparently paid his dues in some gourmet rooms on the Strip, and his pedigree is reflected in the food, every bit of which was awesome.  I had typical steakhouse fare -- Caprese salad, Caesar salad, filet, potatoes, creamed spinach, cheesecake, etc. and everything was GREAT!  
But for me, what really made the place special was the fact that you can watch strippers feeding and being fed choice tidbits of meat to/by fat old conventioneers and perverts.  I think the wonderful lady server checked with us to see if we were interested in having female company, and since we demurred, we ate our entire meal unmolested by the girls.  But we did go into the main room after dessert and give them some business, so all was not lost for the club.
Anyhoo, if you're looking for the QUINTESSENTIAL Vegas experience, swallow your square-ass Puritan qualms and go here!  All that other shit is just Disneyland -- thid is what the Vegas of today is all about!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,9,8,5,oiUWBWHcoCzbWyvZTNU-3Q

First of all - ALL of that building for what?!?! This place is a small fraction of what the outside appears to be!! We were highly disappointed at how tiny this place was, once we entered. 

Management - 5+ Stars - For Professionalism

Service/Waitstaff - Average - To have my drinks pre-paid for as required for entry, please be attentive to my table. I do not like having an empty glass and neither does my husband. AND we are not cheap tippers as we've worked in the service industry environment, including adult entertainment, for numerous years. Actually, we are above average tippers - when service meets expectations. For this place to be as slow as it was (on a weekend night), that was pretty lame.

Dancers - Mediocre - I've seen better and I've seen worse... but that's what the lighting is for! ;-) The closest we got to a dancer is when we witnessed a lap dance right next to our table where the girl was basically kneeing the guys crotch.. how can that be enjoyable? But hey, to each their own. He was pissed about the price ($40), so I'm assuming not very. We were never approached by an entertainer, for whatever reason. I assume it's because of a small, what appeared to be, bachelor party that must've bought them all since that's where they all were and where they stayed unless on stage or giving a lap dance. If they ever even went to stage... several times the DJ called the same girl over and over to no avail. I'm pretty sure not having a girl on stage is a huge ""NO-NO"" - especially on a weekend... in VEGAS!

Entry fee was for cover and a two drink minimum charge. What ever happened to only a cover charge?! I ""might"" not mind as much paying $35 per person if I could taste the alcohol in my drinks. Complete waste of money.

Oh, and the music was hideous. I don't mind not being able to understand the DJ if I can enjoy the music but it was awful and not even recognizable tunes most of the time.

We were getting back from a show and we walked pass the Cosmo and we ran into a guy advising us there was free limo rides and 2 free drinks. We thought about it for like 1 min and decided to go for it, since it was my Bday. We walked maybe 10 steps and we got into their limo. We meet a family in town for a wedding who were really cool and they ended up inviting us to the wedding the next day. 

The ride was nice, and the company was cool. I think it would be a little weird if there was not a party going on in a limo on the way to a strip club. So, we got in and my wife talked to a manager mentioning it was by Bday and he escorted us up to the top floor. This was a Friday night and it was packed. There were no seats available, but the person my wife spoke to was able to get us a nice seat that over looked the down stairs area too and it was right in front of the bar. I really don't remember how much the drinks were or how long we were there, but it was an amazing time. 

There was a steady stream of girls coming over and asking if we wanted a dance, then it turned into my wife interviewing the girls to see if they were any good at couples dance. I ave to say, it is good to have a wife that not only would come to a strip club with you, but filter through the ""weeds"" as well. I would say after about 5-7 girls we decided on one and we went to the back room. There was a 2 drink min., but since there was 2 of us...it was not too shabby. We did have to buy a drink for the entertainer, but it was well worth it. It ended up being 3 songs for a bill. I had a good time and even better my wife had a great time. She could not stop talking about it the rest of the trip and that was just our first night in town. 

We were getting ready to leave and we ran into the same people we were in the limo with on the way there. Funny how things work out. So we got the free ride back as well and everyone got dropped of at Cosmo. I mean that is where they picked us up at so it seemed fitting. Everyone in the limo tipped the driver so I think he ended up with well over $150.00. I am sure he had a good time listening to everyone's conversation on the way there and back. This was a great stop on our trip and I have a feeling when we are back in town next year, we may have to make another couples stop there.

However, the level of service, attentiveness, and professionalism I encountered here definitely warranted at least some sort of acknowledgement.  

This was several months ago and I've forgotten nearly everyone's name.  But even so, I will still treasure the Treasures experience, and I think that's what matters...

So toward the end of last year, a group of us took a close friend's brother to Vegas for his 21st.  Yes, we did the normal 21+ staples. Hit up the pools, gambled a bit, even entered him into a silly game of beer pong.  So, after mulling around on what to do for his last day, and after hearing Treasures repeatedly recommended to us by other friends, at the last minute we decided on treating him to their steak.

As the designated ""planner"" of pretty much everything, I jumped in to call ahead and make reservations.  Unfortunately, the kitchen would not open until much later in the day, when we'd already be heading back to California.  For shame!!  I had pretty much given up at this point, but the manager on the phone had another idea.  He assured me he'd take care of everything and he'd see us later for an early dinner.

Ultimately, about half our party left to drive back down to the OC.  But our small party still held to our plans for steak at Treasures.  The birthday boy was a little wary of entering his first gentleman's club, given the seedy surroundings and less than stellar exterior.  But we were happily and professionally greeted at the door with no cover, an offer of a coat check, a small tour of the restaurant (closed at this time), buffet, ""sports corner,"" etc.  The bouncer even asked if we were the ""birthday group,"" cluing me in to the fact that the manager did indeed inform staff that we'd be coming.

After touring us around, we were led to our ""dinner table,"" which was set up by the main stage.  It was an elegant white tablecloth set up complete with white china, silverware, and low lighting ambiance.  It was incredibly classy and far from what I had expected.  The manager then stopped by to let us know that he'd given the Chef notice of our intention to eat some red meat, and that the kitchen was almost finished being prepped for us.  The fact that the manager prepared for us in advance, and that the kitchen was being opened before hours just to accommodate us was far beyond any level of service I've encountered in Las Vegas.

Our waitress was fantastic as well.  She was knowledgeable about the food, attentive to our table, and even asked us if we'd like her to bring some of the women over to chat with the birthday boy.  Of course, we obliged her offer, and had some lovely ladies stop by to chat with him in between their short stage sets.  Every woman we spoke with was professional, casual, nonpushy, and very well put together.

Of course, the steak was perfectly cooked and the entire meal was a dream.  In summary, my experience at Treasures far surpassed anything I could have envisioned.  The treatment is five stars, the women are gorgeous, and the cost is a remarkable value.

I took my buddies here for a bachelors party and it's beyond expensive. Everything's a promise promise promise and no deliver. 

Bottle service is outrageous and even after paying for it girls will try to hit you with two drink minimum charges. If you go with a promoter the cover charge is $60 a person. If you call the club by yourself the cover charge is waived. Watch out for shady promoters.

Once inside every girl will guilt trip you to tip every single person. The dude who walks you to the table, the dude who hands you money you ordered, the only person not begging for tips or money is the waitress, and honestly she deserves it the most.

They will hit you with $300 private dances and promise to do all things of your desire. Don't fall for it, your fantasies will not come true. Everything is over promise, collect and under deliver. You will leave not happy and broke. If you do attempt this spot you gotta stand your ground and not be over hustled.

He agrees to let the girls in free, but the guys have to pay the ""cover"" of two drinks, which came out to $30ish/guy.  After all the mess, finally our group of 10 went in.  

Inside, the lounge wasn't bad looking.  Classy-ish with two areas for strippers.  I wasn't very impressed with the strippers at all.  The club said they did good pole tricks (yes, we asked about their skillz before we went) and we were sorely disappointed.  Strippers here = boring.  And there weren't that many.

Sex on the beach was $1 extra because there were two types of alcohol on it.  Okay.).  Going home was sketch.  We DID get a limo home, but the driver told us he was working on gratuity.  So?

4996220,2015-02-28,2,O589S0opFB9oK8VcL5tRcA,"My coworker wanted to go to a strip club, and for whatever reason he wanted to come to Treasures. From the outside, the looks of this place seem ultra fancy and extravagant, it definitely catches your attention. The inside looks fancy too, like a better Spearmint Rhino. I was impressed. 

Now, you would imagine that a steakhouse + strip joint would be every man's dream, but somehow I managed to leave slightly disappointed. First I'll rate the dancers. They had all sorts of women from different ethnic backgrounds, so if you appreciate variety you'll appreciate Treasures. Most of them were friendly and didn't bother me too much when I politely declined a dance offer (I did buy a few), but some did give a little attitude. Also, I was annoyed how some of them were bugging me while I was eating my overpriced steak in the back. Common courtesy suggests maybe leaving an eating customer alone. Dances start at $20, I don't know what VIP rates are.

Drinks: You have to buy 2 minimum upon entering the club, at $14 a pop. You can get crappy, mass produced beer in a bottle, or a rather weak mixed drink. I bought a few more drinks throughout the night, however I don't recall if they were also $14 each or not.

Steak: The woman who runs the steakhouse is named Cici, who has a warm personality and wants to make sure you leave satisfied. The fact that I remember her name weeks later lets you know she is good at what she does. All the steaks were dry aged 28 days at least.  Initially I wanted the porterhouse, which has always been my favorite cut, but she recommended the rib eye, which was $3 more. Now, I love steaks to death (quite literally, it may kill me), but generally speaking I prefer to grill my own. I' ordered it medium rare. It was a good, not great steak, somewhat slightly overpriced. To be fair I think any other Vegas steakhouse would have charged about the same. However, due to the poor lighting in the strip club, I was not able to remove the fat from the meat.

After we left, my intoxicated coworker was flirting with the idea of getting a dirty massage but I convinced him otherwise.",yNyj1A_h0TC38eK3_S3DdA,3,0,3,tVAo1v9J-BDPv3bXa6UL5g

As women in a strip club, if you want girls to come to your table, be prepared to ask for them. They won't automatically come over to you.

Beware that it is likely you will get hit up by a stripper in the middle of your meal.  This can be a gift or a curse depending on who approaches you or the occasion for your visit.

One mistake we made was with the cocktails.  Our assumption was that we would get normal restaurant prices for cocktails $8-$10 for a simple well drink but reality was it was more like strip club / night club prices at $13-$14 per cocktail, ouch.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,5,2,3,X1eCLpdXt80GZJ7sHj3Pjg

I reserved a table for 10 over the phone - I was on hold for 8 minutes and was very tempted to hang up but I had to stay on the line. A few Yelpers and I came here. I've been very curious about their steaks...I heard good things.

The early birds and I had some drinks at the bar. Thanks, Chris for the champagne! They were having ""specials"" on drinks which means 2 beers for $12 and $25 for 2 glasses of champagne! I'd have to be drunk before I pay that much for alcohol! The 2 ladies that work at the bar/restaurant took really good care of us. They called me by my first name and even spelled my name correctly which hasn't been happening lately.

Cece was our server and she was very patient with us (late peeps, splitting up the check and peeps who didn't want to get entrees). She's a very spunky lady but she treated me well and gave us a good deal on entrees (buy 1, get 1). So, for a group of 10, we only paid less than $400 including tax and gratuity.

We had a view of the stripclub and we can see the dancers from our table. We also had access to the stripclub without paying for cover. Some dancers were walking around the steakhouse to accompany men who needed them. You can request for girls in advance or tell your server when you get there. But if you didn't, they won't bother you. 

Surprisingly, the steak was great and so was the garlic mashed potatoes. I heard about them but didn't trust other people's opinions I guess so I had to find out myself. The bone-in ribeye was huge (24oz) and had to share it. We got it medium-rare. It was tender and delicious. The steaks are anywhere from $30-60.

It was an interesting dining experience. Dinner and a show I should say. To answer somebody's question: no, the girls won't be grinding on you while you eat your steak!
