Bread came prior to our meal, but wasn't great by any means.  The service was slightly below average, as the server we had was slow to refill drinks, and didn't seem to pay much attention to us throughout the meal, which was irritating because it was not exceptionally busy. A house salad my date got was $8 by the way, and not much to show for it.

649776,2008-08-07,0,pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ,"We planned on having dinner with the fam before seeing V.  After walking through the Miracle Mile shops (and enjoying that cool fake sky), we ended up at Lombardi's, right across from the V Theatre.  The patio seating was pretty full, so we asked for a table inside, the hostess took a peak and told us they didn't have anything available and offered us the first patio table (right next to the hostess desk).  They quickly opened up the table and set us up with 5 seats.

Everyone was hungry and we tore into the bread and dipping oil (with parmesan cheese... ooh!) immediately.  For starters, we had the fried calamari and the Caesar salad, both were good.  I had the lobster ravioli.  The ravioli was really good, but the filling wasn't the best (i.e., didn't really taste like lobster at all).  The hubby had the linguine frutti di mare, which was very tasty.  The linguini was excellent and the sauce was yummy.  The kiddies ordered angel hair pasta (I didn't try it) and tagliatelle with chicken, truffle oil and wild mushrooms (yummy!).  Unfortunately, we were all too full for dessert, so I missed my favorite part of the meal...

Service was good and the food was pretty reasonably priced, except for my lobster ravioli.  $20+ for something that didn't even taste like lobster!  One more thing, after dinner, us girls had to use the facilities, and as I walked through the restaurant, there was not a soul sitting inside with the exception of the private party area in the back of the restaurant.  In fact, there was a table set up for 5 right inside the front door!  Tsk-tsk...",2ibfJ0knhob06EWv2B8JkA,0,0,3,Z9qGLSD2F6kTyg3fLh7Vqw

658911,2012-04-14,0,pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ,"This is the first review I have written for anything anywhere.  Unfortunately, it is for a restaurant and I cannot even comment on the food.

My husband works in commercial real estate development, and needed to be in Las Vegas for the week.  We live on the East Coast, but I decided to tag along and work remotely.  My last day here, I thought it would be nice to sit down somewhere and have lunch, even if I had to dine solo. Not being able to decide on a place to eat, I called my husband.  

I was on the phone when I walked up to the host at Lombardi's, but asked my husband to hold one second.  I asked the host if I could be seated for one.  He said there was a 15-20 minute wait for the outside tables, and offered me the bar.  Dining alone, I actually didn't want to sit outside and asked for a table inside.  All the tables inside were empty except for two.  He looked me in the eye and said he could only seat me at the bar because all the tables were taken.  I said, ""but I can see the tables and all but two of them are empty.""  He reiterated that there were people waiting for them and they weren't available.  

I walked away dumbfounded, noting that the only other person dining solo in the restaurant was seated at the bar.  I ended up eating across the way from Lombardi's at La Salsa Cantina but to exit the mall I had to walk by Lombardi's again.  I noticed that, at this point, not a single table inside was taken.  I don't mind dining at the bar in a restaurant if a restaurant is packed, but I feel like I should have the right to sit at a table if there are tables available even if I am dining solo.  

I debated whether or not to go back and ask for the manager's name.  Eventually, I did.  I walked up to the host again and asked if he was the manager and he said, yes, so I asked him if I could have his supervisor's name and contact information, along with his name.  He balked and asked me why.  I recounted our exchange of less than an hour before and he proceeded to not only disparage me, but flat-out lie about what had transpired.  After ten minutes of this, I eventually got the host's name and the name and contact information for the Director of Operations.

Once I got back to my room, I immediately called the Director of Operations located in Dallas.  He was very apologetic and extremely understanding.  He repeatedly asked if my husband and/or I would go back to Lombardi's as their guest.  While I very much appreciated his offer, his professionalism, and his compassion, I will never again set foot in this restaurant - solo, with my husband, or with anyone else.",EUpZvv9ij1OKhtkD7wyKhw,0,0,1,8SsnZvcqigGMM-Au2B6jUg

685257,2011-12-26,0,pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ,"This is the first Yelp review I have ever written. I just returned from dinner at Lombardi's with my family and I can rate the food a solid ""C"". Lobster ravioli was good, seafood fettucine was good. fettucine bolognese was mediocre at best, and lasagna was straight from the microwave with the sauce congealed into skin on the top. The salads were just OK.

 But the thing that led me to write this review was the 17% service charge added to our bill. When questioned, our waiter showed me the last line of the menu...in the smallest print. imaginable...after the name, address and phone number of the restaurant was a statement that a 17% service charge would be added to parties of 5 or more. Even after it was pointed out to me, I had trouble finding it on the menu. 

To be fair, the waiter offered to remove the charge when I told him that I preferred to give a tip, rather than have one taken from me. So, I left the service charge on, which was less than I would have tipped the waiter left to my own devices.

Avoid this restaurant at  all costs....not a worthwhile dining experience.",sgEBCQgMvKi1E0Ua046Rgw,2,0,1,q59s3ot351VLxZa9Lqj9bw

I had the risotto al parmigiano as I was assured by the waitress that it was the cheesiest thing ever, and I was not disappointed.  It was cooked well (unlike other expensive restaurants that I had visited in my trip), although a little saltier than I would have liked, it was indeed cheesy and delicious.  I also had a side of their meatballs, which were delicious.

I'll start with the bad so I can end with the good. I spent eight dollars for a house salad that was drenched in dressing. I truly suffered through the salad because it was soggy and tasted horrible because of all of the dressing. I then spent $25 on the lobster ravioli. It tasted delicious however the portion was so small that after spending almost $35 on food I left hungry. Not cool. However the atmosphere was nice and our service was excellent. I suggest that you ask about portion size before you order and get your dressing on the side.,i4Rtfmt1s157dZHkroGiug,0,0,3,3Z3159iVMCUeyVgTWPsCZQ

We were seated pretty fast without a wait.  I had the lobster ravioli, which was ok, nothing special honestly.

An elderly gentleman came to our table and sung a song along with his violin ""Lionel Richie""(note the bunny ears)  for 30 seconds than asked for tips.  I only had $20s on me, so I asked for change.  He dropped the money a bill at a time between two plates of food as if it was invisible.  

A lady also took a picture of us and showed us two frames.  One for 15, and two for 20.  Both of which were in Las Vegas frames.  When I asked for both, I didnt notice that she slipped one of the pictures off the frame, and into the bag.  I had to track her down to get money back since this was not what she clear on her ""sale"". 

Thanks to the older gentleman, I had to knock a star off of my experience.  Mr. Lombardi, please do not hire people to rain money on my food!!

I ordered the soup of the day, which was a zucchini saffron soup. or i think it was zucchini... it was definitely some vegetable and saffron because it was bright green. Decent. 
My friend and I shared a Capelli'D Angelo (angel hair pasta tossed with tomatoes and basil). It was just ok. Not super flavorful, but that might have been just the dish anyways. 

The service was horrible. The restaurant was not busy at all. We were seated outside and the waitress barely came by ever. My best friend is a former waitress and even she was appalled by the poor service.

We noticed that she was very rude to the females in our party but was quite nice to the guys in our party.  She only had one other table that we saw her taking care of yet her service was exceptionally slow.  I cannot fathom a restaurant having a wait staff that bad.  I've seen really bad before but this was an extreme new low.

The food was mediocre, nothing to rave about.  I took pictures of just about everything I ate on my trip but I just felt this place had nothing to remember.

Would I come back? That's a negative!
Would I recommend this place? Uhh, No!

Oh and by the way if you have a party of 5 or more 17% will be tacked on your bill as a service charge.. WHAT SERVICE? Horrible.",lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg,1,0,1,z1rrajKb246_h3tf098W9Q

Last week we went for din on Sunday.  The decor is nice, if you sit ""outside"" where you can people watch on but inside is cozy as well.

Wine list is nothing to rave about, just the regular names you see in most grocery stores.  We ordered the calamari app. which was below par.  It had no flavor, which I guess is better than tasting bad, it was strange, it just didn't taste like anything at all. The only flavor was the marinara sauce they served with it which just tasted canned.  Our table had a white pepperoni pizza, the roasted chic pasta and the seafood pasta.  The pizza came burned which was a little strange to us since the restaurant wasn't very busy so you think they could have kept an eye on the one pizza in the oven.  My chic pasta was just ok, kinda reminded me of something I'd eaten at Olive Garden a decade or more ago.  My friend's seafood pasta had decent flavor but almost NO seafood ! I think she counted two measly shrimp, three baby scallops and two mussels.  I think we expected more for a $20 pasta dish.

Service was decent but overall we were not impressed for the food.  Granted, it is not as expensive as most of the restaurants on the strip, but I wouldn't go back.

Crust was decent as well, and it was HUGE!

This was also a nice looking restaurant. It has an open kitchen you see at many decent and higher end restaurants (which I wouldn't call this higher end). It looked like an impressive kitchen that would be helmed by an Executive Chef. 

This was probably one of my better surprises in Vega$. Definitely a good place for lunch- they have lunch specials @ decent prices for an expensive town. Next time I want to try a pasta.

1.The food is mediocre at best. It wouldn't be in business if it weren't for the ""dinner and a show"" package. I bet they get so many people walking by that they don't even care if they get return customers. And it shows.  

2. The manager (beach blonde frat boy) is one of the rudest people I have ever met. I didn't even have to deal with a manager in our situation. Our party just crossed paths multiple times in the restaurant and on all occasions he was a straight up prick. 

3. Happy hour only occurs at the bar is what they told us. And they told us if we wanted the happy hour deal we had to go to the bar. So we placed our order for dinner and the people in our party that drank, walked to the bar to get drinks at a 1/3 of the price. Rather than sit at the table and get up-charged for ordering from the table. 

We were fine with walking our little legs over to the bar for some cheap refreshments, but we had to drink them at the bar. The manager approached us to tell us we could not go back to our seats with happy hour drinks. In my head I am thinking, this is Vegas I can go where ever I want with this drink after I pay for it. But, we kindly sipped at the bar. What we were not fine with was our order being held until we returned to our seats. To reiterate, they did not push the order thru until we finished our drinks at the bar and sat down at the table with the rest of the guests. 


4. At the end of the meal, one of the women in our party had her earring slip out of her ear. The manager walked by and saw it, picked it up and asked if it was anyone's in our party. My aunt asked if she could see it with her hand out, and he pulled back assuming we were going to steal it saying we couldn't put our ""hands on it"" until he matched the owner. We were kind of annoyed as we couldn't really get a look at it. The girl in our party who's earring it was returned from the restroom and showed the matching one. We knew it was hers, but he wouldn't let us even see it up close to definitely confirm. Super annoying and he was rude and condescending about the whole thing. 

5. Then at the end, we ordered another round of happy hour drinks at the bar. Then, we asked to put them in to-go cups, because Vegas.... what I do not freaking get... is why they held our food until we returned from the bar, if we could order a to-go happy hour drink, and then leave the bar. Why did we have to sit at the bar and finish our drinks during dinner, but could leave after dinner??? This tells me that they were just trying to f*ck with us. Some of the worst display's of hospitality I have ever encountered. 

6. If you do go because you are there with a ""dinner and a movie"" deal...let's be honest, it is probably like 75% of their business...anyways, if you go because of that, you have 3-4 choices. Otherwise, you can order from the rest of the menu at a $10-15 addition. If you are vegan, tough luck and pay up. There are no vegan options that come with the meal deal. So you would have to pay an extra $10-15 to order something that you can eat.

My friends and I used to LOVE this place because they offered an all you can drink Mimosa/Bellini special on Sundays. We could have shut this place down, but we more then made up for it with all the food we ordered.This must have been back in 2007-2009 or something. The bread is amazing! If you don't like pasta then go for the anti-pasti platters and you won't be sorry. If you want some peace and quiet, opt for a table indoors. To people watch, sit on their patio. Fair warning, the patio seating is rather tight.
Fast forward to current day and I had to take away one star. I think our waitress was having an off day so I don't really want to blame everything on her BUT it played a huge part in our overall experience, which is the bottom line when you dine at any restaurant. Anyway, I was trying to be friendly, joking with her about their old specials while my friends were looking over the drink menu. She evidently wasn't having any of it. We wanted to order the focaccia bread appetizer which is a slam dunk, but she suggested we order ourselves entries because it would come with a side of focaccia. We ended up ordering a salad and two entries. One of my gal pals and I ordered a Pumpkin Martini each. Our dishes arrived before the bread, but we didn't think anything of it because we were so hungry. 
Our water glasses were all empty along with our adult beverage glasses. Being that the food is rather rich, we stopped eating. Our waitress never bothered to come by and see if everything was OK so we flagged down a different one to refill our glasses.  Under my breathe I quietly said to my friends, ""Our waitress is terrible."" I think she heard me because after that she finally stopped by to see if we wanted another martini. At this point I was annoyed because she was catering to her other tables more than ours. I asked about our order of focaccia. She looked at us funny and then said she was so sorry it didn't come. The next words she uttered were just plain wrong... ""Ummm, do you still want me to put in the order for you?"" Granted we were a table of 3 and now very upset women who only came to this place specifically for the bread.

I looked up the restaurants online & inteded on going to Yolo's (a Mexican cantina inside the casino), but as I was walking through the Miracle Mile shops, I came across this place & started craving Italian.

The ambiance is nice. They have a setting for most every need... long & secluded tables for large groups to make it feel family-style, regular seating inside, bar seating with a TV, or patio seating ""outside"" the restaurant to people watch. The music is kinda loud coming from the Miracle Mile walkway & the A/C was up way too high, so it was freezing cold, but the decor is a nice cross between olde world Italia & contemporary flare, so, overall, it was pleasant.

I came around 3pm, which is after the lunch crowd & before the dinner crowd, so it was pretty empty. They were still serving off the lunch menu, which I'm glad about, because it was a tad bit pricy, so I can imagine what their dinner prices are like.

As for the food..... delish!! I ordered the Paglia e Fieno which is made with tagliolini pasta (like a flat linguini), chicken, mushrooms, truffle oil & cream sauce. I've never had tagliolini before. Typically, I would've substituted that for fettuccini noodles, but since I've been trying to ""try something new"" in 2013, I kept it as-is. Glad I did too... I really liked it! I did substitute broccoli instead of chicken, & they cooked it perfectly... not all mushy, yet not raw. The mushrooms were tasty without being overbearing & the cream sauce had a nice consistency & was garlicy. It was a terriffic dish!

I do have to note... after reading another Yelper's review about how good their house bread is, but the difficulty they had in actually receiving any, I was looking forward to getting some which came with my meal, according to the menu. Well, it didn't come out with my meal. After a few moments, I realized this & stopped my waitress asking her, ""excuse me, does this come with bread?"" She suddendly seemed a bit irritated & replied, ""oh, do you want some?"" This was almost exactly the same snippy reply the other Yelper got, so I'm guessing this was the same waitress &, no, she wasn't just having an off day. And when she brought the bread out without any butter or anything & I asked her for some oil & vinegar, she acted like it was such a task! Very strange, because other than this bread ordeal, she was a pretty good waitress.... what is it about this bread?! Lol (Minus 1 star)

Went there on Thursday evening for dinner, I ordered the blackberry mule, bruschetta and chicken parm, wife order tagliolini scampi.  Waiter was nice enough, started us out with bread and olive oil vinegar dip.  Bread seemed a bit old and so didn't the olive oil but ok,  Mule was nothing to write home over, bruschetta was actually good, but very watery ,  the bread warmed up.  Meals came, immediately my wife said taste this and stuck a shrimp on my plate, it was tough and with a strong fishy taste.  The chicken parm was horrible, dry, thin and flavorless.  We knew we made a mistake we each tried another shrimp to make sure, and I ate around on the chicken to check the other zones.  We ate the pasta and wanted to leave.  We told the waiter it wasn't very good he apologized and just brought us the bill.  Now we hand him the cc and then see him head to the back where he stands there shooting the breeze with his coworkers for about 10 minutes.  i just wanted out.  About three hours later sure enough both the wife and I are puking in our hotel rooms,  not a good way to spend a night in a $300 room.

As I approached the entrance, I asked to sit in the outside patio area. Such a relaxing spot to dine in at. The atmosphere of this Restaurant is very appealing and most of very romantic. They have done a great job in setting the mood to relax and enjoy your meal.The lighting and the music and most of all the small wares and the linen are a added bonus to enjoying your meal.
My server was very attentive. Sara. Your an asset to this establishment. I hope they see this in you how attentive you where with your Guests. Your personality and smile are the key to your success.Don't lose it. 
I ordered the Chicken Marsala with mashed potatoes and vegetables and the whole plate was very good. The dish also came with their version of bread and olive oil. Now the bread is also made to order and baked in a Wood Oven for such a better taste.
For Desert I had their home made Tiramisu. I was in haven.

I actually dined here solo because the husband wasn't hungry so I took advantage of the opportunity to get some serious Italian on.  The location is in the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood and they have an inside and an ""outside"" seating area.  I sat ""outside"".  

First, my server was amazing.  She was friendly, helpful, took care of me and made me feel welcome.  Just wish I remembered her name.  Ah well.

I started with the beef carpaccio and it was delicious. it came with a pile of arugula, lemon and capers.  I had planned to just eat half, but I cleaned that plate, it was so tasty!  The lemon was perfect with the beef.  SO GOOD!

Then I had the lobster and crab ravioli.  Also AMAZING.  The flavors were so delicate and tasty and the ravioli were floating in a brandy crustacean sauce that was a creamy pink sauce and my mouth is watering right now thinking about this dish.  It was a daily special item, but if they have it when you go, trust me, it's YUM.

Before my meal I had their sangria and it was good... on the sweet side, then I had a glass of wine with my food.  

It was a wonderful meal, I left full and happy and it hit my pocketbook to the tune of around $50 plus tip.  Worth every penny.  I will definitely return, especially since my timeshare is right across the street!",_vy7K2Q9X8p7Jl1OkY_JOQ,3,1,4,-vxcGsQaI2JOnYqLXqM1ag

We went back a second time since our first visit was outstanding. This time was different because we did a dinner and show combo pack. They asked if we had purchased the deal and took the tickets. They put the vouchers in the middle of the table. We waited over 10 minutes for someone to great us. While waiting we made an observation that everyone with the tickets on the table were waiting but people who came in after, without tickets in their table, were awarded quick service. My husband commented about that as the host walked by. The host came over and got our drink order. I asked about the drink special and he said it was only at the bar but we could move there. We did hoping it would be better service. It wasn't. We also only had a choice of four meals unless we wanted to upgrade for 10-18 dollars a piece. We had spent plenty so decided to go off the choices included. He got the tilapia and it was pretty good. I got the only vegetarian option, fettuccine Alfredo. It wasn't disgusting but the sauce wasn't as good as canned from the grocery store and the noodles were not fully cooked. This was nothing like our first experience with service or food quality. After reading the other reviews it seems that if you go as a regular customer it is wonderful. If you purchase the combo package with a show, it is a different and not desirable experience.  

Excellent food! I had the macaroni and cheese and my husband had a daily special. Mine was wonderful and he said that his was one of the best meals ever! Our server was attentive and kind. We are in Vegas for our wedding and our waitress made a special design for our dipping sauce.

2929327,2012-12-08,0,pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ,"I'll admit it. Italian is on the bottom of my top cuisine list. Most dishes can be made at home and it's hard to find a place that actually stands out and makes you want to come back. 

For me, Lombardi's is the epitomy of this, if not worse. It's your typical sub-par Italian restaurant that presents itself as high-class but really consists of waiters who dread their jobs and chefs who have never used seasonings outside of salt and pepper and consider the microwave their utensil of choice. I really didn't expect much more in the first place.

I ordered the Lobster/Crab Ravioli special, which I tend to gravitate to in the rare case that I do go to an Italian restaurant and they actually have it. This was probably the worst I've had. The dough was under-cooked, the filling was just some mushy paste that barely had any seafood flavor, and the portion was pretty small for the price. It was just bleh, for lack of a better term. If you're going to have a dish that's considered a special, at least do it right.

Service was mediocre at best. We had a group of 10 or so and the waiter always took forever. Now I wonder why we even came here considering all the options Vegas has to offer...",1yv6GXttiII_-od7HaUcfA,0,0,2,ftfvzzr8ddFygMIXYMBdBg

2938251,2013-02-12,1,pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ,"I have no issue saying I'm wrong. After going to Lombardi's for a second time last night, I will be a regular at this location for a very, very long time.

I wanted gluten free pizza, and we were staying in PH, so we decided to grab some pizza from Lombardi's and then walk around. My husband convinced me to give them another chance and we sat down for some lunch. This time, we grabbed a couple cocktails, one Cosmopolitan creation and an Italian Margarita. Delicious. My drink was perfect, not too sweet, just perfect. His was just the way he wanted it, a little sweeter but with a nice bitter kick and a little salty. Yum.

Now, then they told me they were out of GF crusts. I was about to walk out, but I wanted to give this another go around and ordered their caprese salad and the Paglia a Fieno. Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back. 

The salad was perfect. Perfect marinated tomatoes, nice tang of vinaigrette, wonderfully fresh basil and oh that mozzarella. A little smokey, very smooth, the server, Matt, cracked some fresh pepper on top and BAM. MAGIC. I could eat that salad everyday for the rest of my life and never get sick of it.

On to the pasta. If I could eat pasta and never gain another pound, this pasta would be my breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day. Amazing. The chicken was just slightly overcooked, but I still would have eaten that chicken anytime as long as it was in that pasta or that pasta was my reward. Gluten free pasta, mushrooms, a little hit of truffle oil and a perfect cream sauce. This is not an Olive Garden cream sauce. This is garlic, plus cream and then some cheese. This is a sauce that probably got them Zagat rated. This is my go to pasta. Anytime. Anywhere. A-FREAKING-MAZING.

Finally, let me comment on the service. Last time, the service was horrible and bad enough for me to almost walk out because why am I paying this much for food when the service is wretched?  This time? This is an example of why this restaurant is Zagat rated. First of all, I saw the manager walking around and checking on tables and greeting guests. I firmly believe this is a manager's job and should be done everywhere. Our server, Matt, was perfect. He brought salad plates, explained the dishes, described the drinks perfectly, made us feel good about our food and drink choices, brought us freshly grated parmesan cheese with our meal, offered red chili flakes (a welcoming addition to the pasta), brought us entree plates since we had told him we were sharing our dish, filled the water glasses all the time and was just very warm and friendly. He told me that the reason they do not have the GF pizza crust is because they're revamping the crust so that it tastes more like regular pizza instead of a generic GF pizza and so that it is the size of their normal pizzas. The manager came over and said the same thing and was very friendly as well.

Sorry about the novel, and I normally don't change my mind based off of one re-visit (and I normally do not revisit after that kind of experience), but this one was perfect, and I am confident this will continue for our many visits to come.",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,1,0,5,I_fHbqKDMRKuSQPbh-Bw_w

But I have to say that the dark chocolate chips made the desert taste like a cafe mocha which was delightful.

All-in-all I would say that my experience with LRM was well worth a visit to Planet Hollywood Casino and the Miracle Mile Shops. 

Kudos to Charese who was such a joy to talk to, and to Sarah (our waitress) who served us with a smile.",7AENCr56ijU5oOmNSbWljw,0,0,4,QZehLbSBWWOQF4cMwQDBGw

A few minutes later, the waiter said it was fine and we could order from our table instead. They were okay, nothing special but the price was right - 2 for $10. The food was hot and seemed fresh. I didn't like the taste of the lasagna at all. I couldn't tell what was wrong with it but wouldn't order it again. The piece was also very small for $20 and no sides.

Our meal started with the complimentary foccacia bread with rosemary olive oil and parmesan cheese. Then we got our salads. I got the Caesar salad while my friend got the house salad. Then came the entrees. I got the Fettucine Alfredo while my friend got the Rigatoni Bolognese. All of the food was pretty good.

What keeps this place from getting anything above 3 stars was when we got the bill at the end. The meals were free since we had the coupons from the V theatre across the way, but we would still have to leave tip. The value of the entire meal was listed as $70! I was floored when I saw that number because there was no way the meals we got could have cost that much. For fun we went ahead and added up the cost of everything, assuming the foccacia bread was complimentary. The total was only about $50. When we added the cost of the foccacia bread, the total value was $58. Where did the remaining $12 come from? And if the foccacia bread is in fact complimentary, where did that extra $20 come from? Even with the 8.1% sales tax, the highest total ends up being $63. There was no way we were going to leave a 15-20% tip based on $70, when that was much higher than actual value of the meal!

This is probably the better place inside the Miracle Mall to go to for a pre-theatre meal. Just be warned, the free meal does not include everything on the dinner menu and they will try to squeeze more money out of you thru drinks, desserts, and tip.

We made reservations on Open Table for Saturday night at 7pm & we were seated immediately, We opted to sit in the ""outdoor space"" which was funny since it's not really outdoors, but still, better for people watching on the faux patio.

3 of our girls opted to split a bottle of wine while the other 3 all ordered individual cocktails. Personally, I ordered the sparkling rose and it was only ok--definitely not served cold enough for my tastes.

The daily specials had a roasted tomato soup and both my friend and I were interested in trying it, but for $8.50 for a cup of soup, we opted to split it in case one of us didn't like it. Fortunately the soup was delicious, but again, $8.50 for a cup of tomato soup is a bit ridiculous...it wasn't a bowl, it was a CUP.

For our entrees, 2 of us opted for their streak ravioli daily special, 1 got the veggie pizza, 1 got spaghetti and meatballs, 1 fettuccine alfredo, and 1 spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil (I forgot the name of the actual dish). Everyone really enjoyed their meals. The ravioli was very small which basically forced me to order dessert (lol), but it was good none the less. I ordered the chocolate lava cake and while delicious, it was REALLY REALLY rich and I couldn't eat more than half without getting a serious stomachache. PROTIP: this is a dessert to SHARE! It's small but deadly!

The bread and dip (oil, parm cheese, and balsamic I think) they serve is very good and we went through a lot of it. The service was mostly okay, although it did seem to take our server a while give us our check and then take it back after we put our money in. 

Finally, I'd like to apologize on behalf of my two EXTREMELY IMMATURE FRIENDS for drawing penises all over the table!!!

3922718,2008-01-28,0,pfmr8R3WH8RXqW0W6D8ffQ,"Pros:
Service - we had a very attentive waiter that was knowledgeable, made good suggestions, was friendly and talkative without being overbearing.  Had an issue with the chicken (see below) and it was taken off the bill immediately without a second thought.
Atmosphere - Sure, the fake sky is a little cheesy, but it's fun and the ""outdoor"" seating area was cute and even with people passing by it wasn't loud.
Roasted Tomato Soup - Oh my god.  It was delicious!! Not sure if it's a standard, because it was the soup of the day but they possibly offer it often?  HIGHLY recommend getting it.
Price - For what you get, I would expect it to be much higher.  $10-$15 for pasta dishes, they also offered more expensive surft and turf, filet mignon, etc for a higher price but this is definitely an affordable non-chain  (I think) option when in Vegas.
Dipping oil for bread: Oh wow...I can't remember exactly but I think it was olive oil, balsalmic vinegar, parmesean cheese, chili pepper flakes, pepper and something else that they mixed together to dip the bread in...it was definitely the best standard olive oil/vinegar type mix that I've ever had at a restaurant. 

Con:
Chicken - my friend and I each had chicken in our pasta (she had added it, didn't come in her dish originally) and we both thought that it tasted like cleaning supplies.  The server talked to the chef about it who suggested that maybe it was the rosemary maridnade that was used.  I'm not sure about that because I like rosemary...suprisingly, even though the chicken was disgusting I am still giving Lombardi's 4 stars because the chicken was taken off the bill, the waiter was super nice about it and the service, other food and atmosphere made up for it.",mlXwqNmyiFwnYoCjzXR2IQ,2,2,4,Q8nw_oOXYPHBsx-_yUg3JQ

When we arrived, there was no one at the host stand, and we had to wait a couple minutes for him. And although he took our drink order, we waited a long time to recieve them, and even longer for him to take our orders. 
We got the oil for our bread early, but the bread itself wasn't given until moments before we finally received our food. Everyone around us, even those that arrived after us, had already received their bread. 

The only complaint I have about the quality of the food is that the alfredo is nothing like any other alfredo sauce I've had before. It's almost transparent, thin, and greenish. It was just okay, but not at all what we expected. 

The decor here is a very bland italian feel. Just whatever. 

I just felt, overall, that I could have had better service and atmosphere with the same quality of food at a less expensive italian joint.",fquTEV93jh82JYob6u0CEA,2,1,2,Dd_Yd1qIbVhUANoLgR_7iw

The first time we went was to see a show at the V theatre which is just across from this restaurant and we wanted to also people watch in the ""outside"" area. It was for late lunch/early dinner and the place was not busy. Johnny gave us great service and we both ordered fish dishes (halibut and salmon) which were perfectly done as well as the vegetables that came with them. We also ordered the melt in your mouth calamari which was only lightly breaded ( instead of drowned in a bready crust  like some places that do not know how to make this dish) and crisped just right! The manager of the day, Daniel Martinez, also stopped by to  ask if everything was ok- YES!

So, when we decided to go back the next day - because we received some tickets for a free show at the V theatre with dinner..........well that experience other dinners have documented below.

So I found out why some people really like this restaurant - and others don't.

If you are a regular customer, who pays for your meal, you are much more likely to be pleased with your experience here than if you have the ""freebie"" coupon.

The pasta was well cooked, the meat was tender and juicy, and the sauces full of flavor.  The gnocchi melts in your mouth, and the shrimp was perfectly cooked, which is hard to find in the middle of the dessert.

This is a typical sit-down restaurant with cloth napkins and home-made bread served with oil and vinegar and entrees ranging from teens to tens of dollars. Everything from steak to veal to salmon was available and there was even a lobster ravioli on the menu.

To sum up our experience, it was neither a good or bad experience. We were told there was no wait but then ended up waiting for about 7 minutes talking to the manager (maybe owner) at the front because he wanted to give his waitress ""time to catch up"". Uhm, how about staffing correctly and seating accordingly. But things like this happen so it wasn't a huge deal. 

Sat down at the table only to find out that the waitress was definitely not caught up by any means. The number one factor in knowing that a server is busy is when your bar drinks are brought out before sodas, tea, waters, etc by another server simply running well drinks. 10 minutes in, we had all of our drinks and were ready to order. 

I ordered the caprese salad and one of the items off their daily specials: Lobster Ravioli. The Caprese Salad did not disappoint but it is hard to mess that up. The Lobster Ravioli was a huge disappointment. It was OK, but tasted almost as if it was frozen. Small portions, so I would suggest ordering at least 2 courses whenever dining here. 

All in all, the service kinda sucked and the food didn't necessarily make up for it so hence the ""eh"" 3 star review.

Our waiter, Evan (I believe that was his name), was AWESOME. Very friendly and knew exactly when to swing by the table and check on us. He made some great suggestions for food choices, and he would come to the table and refill not only our water, but also our sodas, when he saw they were depleting. THAT is good service.

Service was excellent (food came out quickly and refills were handled in a timely manner as well).  I liked that even grown ups get crayons to draw on the paper tablecloth. 

The price wasn't too bad, honestly. I live in Orange County here in CA and it's nothing worse than you'd pay around here for a nice meal. Dinner for two and a nice tip for the waiter came out to $50.

The reason I took off a star is their manager. The table next to us had a big dramafest over a customer service issue, and the manager was a total douche to them. Even our waiter admitted that he was embarrassed of the manager. I was mortified *for* him because it was awful, not to mention a little uncomfortable for the tables within earshot.",XI9IDGQJoW10bXSWKBwkSA,1,0,4,2lQHAnDOZ7DQ45WRBl35kQ

All the food was delicious, although next time, I will try and order a bigger portion of my appetizer over GF pasta, because it was much, much better than the entree.

Scampi Picatta ($10.50) - I didn't care if there wasnt shrimp, I more wanted the sauce to dip bread in.
Caprese ($11)- the elements were fresh, but I think that they really shouldn't substitute basil oil for real basil. Basil makes a big part of it.

My friend wanted to order a certain drink and the waitress made a comment saying it wasn't that good and she wouldn't recommend it. Despite what she thinks of the drink she shouldn't be putting her two cents in. I also seem to recall when we placed our orders for lasagna she seemed hesitant about that as well as if it wasn't a good choice. Maybe she was right since there was hardly any meat in the lasagna. Regardless her whole demeanor was not pleasant!

I will say that she was kind enough to surprise me with a birthday treat that was unexpected so I thank her for that, even though it wasn't that great.

I wish I could remember the name of Azya C.'s entree - it was a lunch special, a pasta stuffed with pear & gorgonzola in a white (not alfredo) sauce. The pasta looked like sacchietti but I know they weren't named that. This dish, although sized modestly, was the best-tasting dish we had. I had the gnocchi and even added chicken at the suggestion of our server -- and it was pretty good! We also had the spaghetti & meatballs, which were reportedly ""not bad.""

Our service was excellent, and we enjoyed sitting ""outside"" where we could watch the Miracle Mile Shops' patrons pass by.

Price: 3 stars
Atmosphere/decor: 2.5 stars

Let me start off with the food. I ordered the lasagna and one more pasta that had mushrooms and chicken in it. Both were delicious and both were portioned enough for my mom and I to be full. BUT i think that with the decor of the place and the price, I'm not sure if I would come back here. First off, who uses yellow table covers? I think that threw me off the most. It was so tacky and ugly looking that really, with the quality of food being produced from this place, if they only made this place look nice(starting with replacing those really really ugly yellow table covers) I'd pay $35 for the two portions of pasta. I know we're in vegas so prices are a bit more expensive, but I think that the setting of a place is just as important as anything else and they need to update their look. If prices were about $2-3 less, maybe the ugly table cloths will do.

OH i also like that the bread came out nice and warm, and this was the first place that i've ever been to where they separate the olive oil from the balsamic vinegar using Parmesan cheese! what a brilliant idea EVERY Italian restaurant must do. I hate picking up mostly oil in my dip, but when its separated, i can have more vinegar and less oil.",fiA-NzrW7qDXIEjiONq7Vw,2,1,3,P9zCaJSv_Hs0S7icJl_2AA

Their desserts taste fresh and light regardless of how heavy/ rich they may seem. The tiramisu is light, fluffy and does not feel heavy or too condensed in texture. The cannolis shells are flaky, crisp and not too thick. Just right! The filling tastes like the ricotta is whipped with some sort of chocolate and has small chocolatechips as well. I rarely eat cannolis, but these were worth eating. They are actually better than the cannolis at my local Italian deli/ bakery, and that's saying something positive!

Our server was so kind and gave us a second glass for $1 instead of both us having to pay $7 each for our first glass.

The server says it comes in three strips but we had more than three.  I was super happy because I needed the greasy goodness to counter the buzz I was getting from the mimosa.  Well it didn't counter it, I was just super happy because it was damn good.

Hubz ordered the hash dish with potatoes, brisket, and I think poached eggs on top.  Wasn't sure because we smashed it all together.  The only way you can eat it!  The brisket was tender but some were a bit hard but the yolk soften it up by not much..

Upon gazing over the menu, delicious descriptions of simple dishes give way to belief of something worth dinning on. This was not the case. The bread they brought out to us was bland and almost disgusting. It looked appealing, hence why I decided to try it. But to my surprise, it was way worse than I anticipated.

I decided to order the chicken parmagana as my main dish. The description was great, and the smells of fresh food filled the air to accompany my appetite. When the dish arrived at the table, I was greeted by a, what I assume, previously frozen chicken cutlet topped with what tasted like canned tomato sauce.

When he returned he passed the menu's to a young female who took us to our table. We were seated outside where it was super noisy and too be expected when seated in this area.  The restaurant inside was approximately 90% empty.  When we were finally approached by our waiter we asked if we could perhaps be seated in side.  He said yes and then just stood there and looked at us.  I finally asked if he coul check for sure and have someone move us if possible.  The young female returned and took us inside.  It was a little better.  Now we sit for approximately 7 minutes with no service from anyone - no water, no bread no nothing.  Finally the waitress leans over and said she would be with us in a few minutes.  Probably 5 minutes later she returned.  We ordered our wine and when that arrived we ordered our dinner.  Both my dinner and my husbands dinner were mudh less then average.  My husband ordered Pollo Parmigiana.  The chicken was extrely dry and tasteless.  I ordered Risotto Capesante.  The risotto was bland and the scallops were extremely fishie.  Yes I know that scallops are from the sea but I also know that when fish in a restaurant is that strong it ususally means it is close to beging bad.  
We ordered coffee and even that wasn't good.  Our meal came to around $100 - not much for a strip meal but so not worth the money.  We probably should of just gone and grabbed a burger.  I'm sure it would have tasked better. 
Won't be there again.",K6SwU-RKlxh_n1Sp_Rw77g,0,0,2,F68SkS2BeeNfxLu8G7m57g

We had a free food voucher and we wanted to tip on what the total would have been, but we had to guess since the bill only stated the balance for our drinks and extras. The flatbread and Caesar salad were just okay for me. The best dish was the Tilapia in a roasted pepper sauce. It was truly delicious. Our server was friendly and attentive and they sat us in a really comfortable booth in the back.",rV_6AC3lCEUAA2FHYyr8NA,0,0,3,twyB07w71qqpCpJ5kB-ZiQ

The bread was warm but A little hard to chew, but that's just the type. The staff and manager was very friendly and service was fast.

Food 4.5. Good Italian. Heavy sauces but done well.  Lobster ravioli 25 used.Small portion but good flavor so.  Pappardelle ? Not sure how to spell.  Suggested by waitress. Really good. Sauce was heavy and creamy but still was well done. 20 used. Kids meatball and spaghetti 7 used.   Average marinara sauce but my daughter liked it.  I liked the meatballs.

Service 3. Not rude like say Chinese restraunts rude but not helpful. Food came out ninja fast.  For us with two kids was good. Wait staff seemed to be every man for himself. Asked 3 times for water so finally got it from manager.  Others experiences seem to have good service. Maybe just an off night. also mistakenly overcharged me for a kids drink which was an annoyance.

Ambiance 4. Forgot I was in a mall for a second.  Doesn't feel like Italy but then a lot closer. 

All in all I may come back for the food.  At my age and with so many good restraunts where we live, I typically will not frequent a restraunts with poor service.  If u happen to be at miracle mile, seems to me to be the best choice and I would give it a try. Not cheap but not expensive.",NTJwKqrD7tHfx-gLVO7c1g,0,0,3,oR2jTIeig15EavSK22Y8xw

My cousin asked if they had bread and she said yes but they bring it out with dinner, she asked if she could just bring it out before dinner and the waitress was looking at her like uhhhhh no! What's the difference? She also didn't provide the table with water, you had to ask if you wanted some I thought it was normal to just provide water anyway. The gnocchi caprese was awesome.",gdDTmvbfKLDYLUnjRrCcaA,0,0,4,JRKRfU4bxmUHj5Gljb4ZrQ

To cut the story short.. after some Fat Tuesday's we stumbled onto this place that looked interesting. It is located in the Miracle Mile shops (part of Planet Hollywood). Normally you don't expect to find really good food in a shopping center (or equivalent), but it really is one of my favorite places. I have brought friends here over and over every time I go. Every time my friends loved it. Not to mention that I watched my winning parlay ticket here.. so bonus points. ;-) But back on a serious note.. it really is a great place.. great eggplant parmigiana, same with their chicken parmigiana, and delicious gnocchi.  They also have what I believe is foccacia bread (or something super thin) that comes with cheese (Parmesan sprinkled on top) and oil and vinegar (on the side).. this used to be complimentary, but I think they charge for it now. Anyhow, highly recommended. Must try at least once!!",ZaTih-bdkU7fjn1LugGkYg,1,1,5,LMSQcq_rVUmLCfr2aUqe3g

In need of drinks and a little something to eat, we landed here on a Sunday afternoon.  Pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We chose the bar as we didn't want a full meal.

Husband enjoyed his Manhattan and I had a nice Chianti.  We shared a perfectly delicious sausage and peppers pizza.  Highlight was the awesome complimentary bread and beautiful trio of nice olive oil, parmesan and balsamic to dip into.  Yum!  

Atmosphere is a bit dated, but the food, service and drinks were just what we needed!",fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,2,2,4,kbojqLG0wy64Kw5sEJBxsA

It is located within the Miracle Mile shopping center linked to The Planet Hollywood casino. Nicely themed restaurant. Seating available within the restaurant and along the mall's walkways near a large fountain. We had the meal that was packed with tickets to the Saxe Theater. The meal always has a $20 value whatever your hear . We enjoyed ourselves and will come back.,HfhzwGsW66IODVDQtByGVg,0,0,4,edFdiNWsbsZWJmiU8XPunw

My family was walking around PH looking for a place to eat a casual dinner. Lombardi's hit the spot! We got seated without a wait, and got the ""patio"" area so got to people watch as well.

Our server was fantastic. Super helpful and nice. He recommended some tasty dishes as well! It was with his recommendation that I tried the Manhattan clam chowder for the first time.

The Manhattan clam chowder was SO good. Given that I have no prior experience, this was still super tasty. For my entree, I got the lasagna. The sauce was flavorful. Unfortunately, the noodle, cheese, and meat ratio was off. Not enough cheese and meat.",03RJcIDcNwH4WQmqjIvwIw,3,1,4,hzz4ImWi2eWrw7qd6GjTIQ

I got the chicken Marsala which was very good, but also something I make at home fairly regularly so it wasn't anything to write home about. My husband and I shared a Nutella panna cotta for dessert and it was PHENOMENAL. I'm going to make an attempt to make it myself this weekend. 

It was definitely really good, but next time I'll order off the regular menu for something a little more adventurous.",SqeBzCpSehkkI_UbrMmktw,1,0,4,Uqfi5-qNx7xNxjv6B5nzTA
