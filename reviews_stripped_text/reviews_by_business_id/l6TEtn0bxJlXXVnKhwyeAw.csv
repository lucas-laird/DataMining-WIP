128400,2016-06-10,1,l6TEtn0bxJlXXVnKhwyeAw,The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the first time it was awesome.  Lobster roll was absolutely delicious.  Then I went to a food truck event at Knickerbocker Park and it was not great at all.  They told us it would be a half hour wait and it was probably 45 minutes.  No apologies for the long wait.  The lobster rolls looked like someone sat on the them and then they pried them open to add the lobster.  Not worth the $60 for 3 lobster rolls and soup.  They didn't seem prepared for the event at all.,2SofzfWKRsSDoH6I8CZqSw,0,0,3,3GCqqH9afGUhQ2cP-YCqbw

Wow, what a big disappointment, and after seeing photos of some of your other lobster rolls, I'm just mad. The roll I received looked nothing like those pictures. There was barely any lobster on the roll, and the lobster itself was tasteless!! I really didn't think it was worth $7 let alone $17. Never again.",bae151Q78OmwZTHVhO1p_w,1,0,1,VZdv6a-qeySLnapbDqsdpw
341528,2017-08-30,0,l6TEtn0bxJlXXVnKhwyeAw,"Last night my wife and I watched a show on lobster rolls in Maine. We were craving lobster and thought it would be awesome to go to Cousin's Maine Lobster truck. We drove the 12 miles to get to it and we're simply excited. I ordered the Maine lobster roll, she ordered the lobster grilled cheese and we ordered the lobster tots and a whoopie pie to share. $60 later we got our food and hurried home to eat it. We got home and to my disappointment got a 2 bite roll with about the same amount of meat in it as 3 crawdads. You can see the length of it is about 4 inches. Now the lobster in it was good, don't get me wrong, but from the pictures and the just shy cost of $20, it was a major disappointment. The same went for my wive's grilled cheese. There was a small speed bump of lobster in the middle of the bread and that's it. One bite of lobster and the rest cheese. 

So the lobster tots were awesome. Crispy tots with a pico and lobster topping. That's about all I can get behind. Unfortunately I was hoping this was going to be a weekly stop since they are right by us every Saturday night. But oh well.",x5e7DCtX7zYtvYz9x3n0ug,3,0,2,xOmHBKjIkk8w4MJFWy3Bag

On 12/6/17 I stepped out of the Smith's grocery store located at Valle Verde @ Paseo Verde in Henderson.  Curiosity of a line of folks standing in front of a food truck caught my attention. Lobster! Are you kidding? Maine Lobster and having hooked up with Barbara on Shark Tank.... well that's all it took to hook me in. I ordered the Lobster Taco and to my delight thoroughly enjoyed every bite! Fresh soft homemade taco shells layered with chunks of succulent fresh and sweet Lobster, shredded cabbage, homemade Pico de gallo,
A squirt of a light mayo sauce.  2 nice large slices of fresh limes accompanied the tacos. Squeezed just enough lime juice on each of the 3 tacos and enjoyed a feast of fresh homemade goodness!   I enjoyed the Lobster so much that I drove back to the Smith's parking lot and ordered a Maine Lobster Roll and Moon Pie to round out my dinner. The lobster was layered unto an incredible tasting toasted bread roll with just enough mayo so as not to disguise the flavour of the tender  sweet succulent lobster chunks. And the moon pie which was wrapped in its own packaging was an import from Maine appeared to have been frozen and the middle white fluff was in its thawing stage and still firm....had I been home I would have popped it into the microwave for a few seconds...but none the less the flavour of the chocolate cake and vanilla cream sandwiched in between were good old fashioned goodness and could easily serve 2 to 4 for dessert.
The price for the Lobster Taco $16.00
Maine Lobster Roll $17.00
Moon Pie $5.00
Which includes tax.
Was an expensive eat alone treat and well worth it!

I was pretty excited that a lobster roll food truck was going to arrive in Vegas and I had planned with a couple friends to go. Obviously I'm aware that lobster isn't the cheapest thing on the market, but their lobster rolls were $14/ea, which was higher than the price offered at their LA trucks. As lobster rolls traditionally are, this included lobster meat piled on a hot dog bun. Tasty, but just not the Vegas portions I'm used to. I got a side of plain tots which were $4. They were fine. I just knew I was going to need more food in addition to the small roll but didn't want to make this food-truck equally as expensive as going to a half-decent sit-down restaurant by purchasing another lobster-garnished dish.

My friend asked if the $12 lobster tots were large enough to be a dish on their own. ""Yeah they are huge!"" When she received hers she immediately knew it wasn't going to be enough food. It was the just side of tater tots with some lobster on the top.

I love lobster. I love sandwiches. Therefore, lobster rolls are just like two of my all-time favorite things wrapped into one amazing piece of deliciousness. I was ECSTATIC to find this truck on a night where my fiance and I decided to stroll fremont street. I promptly said to him, ""this. this is what's for dinner. I need this."" I perused through the yelp reviews and they are understandably mixed. I mean, lobster rolls are pricey and when you dish out 16 bucks for a sandwich, I'm sure we all expect it to be amazeballs. I went for it anyway, though, cuz...GIMME THAT LOBSTA.

Service? Fine. It's a truck. There wasn't a line but it was also a Monday night. We ordered two Maine lobster rolls (they also have Connecticut rolls for you blasphemers) and devoured them with the extreme quickness. Lobster was juicy and tender; mayo was ample but not too crazy. They provide a lemon wedge but we decided to live on the edge and went sans lemon. Did I feel like it was absolutely worth the dough? Maybe not. Did I feel disappointed? Absolutely not. Would def do again.

Other menu items included lobster grilled cheese (really was tempted to try this bad boy out), lobster quesadilla, and lobster tots! Those looked delish but I couldn't rationalize the price point of tater tots with lobster (something like 16 bucks as well).

I tried Cousins Maine Lobster for the first time during the Farmers Market at Tivoli Village, and I was completely blown away.  The ""regular"" old Lobster Rolls are where it's at!  I tried the tacos and tots for the heck of it, but nothing is as perfect to me as the basic Maine Lobster Roll.  The portion of lobster meat is great, the roll is perfect and delicious, and the lobster meat is so succulent, fresh, and sweet.  All it needs is a little squeeze from the lemons provided, and you are golden!  Don't get me wrong, it's fun to try all the menu variations, but I think the simplicity of the Maine Lobster Roll is the best.

Tips: The truck has a beautiful, ""A"" rating from the health department posted right in the front window - score!, it accepts debit/credit cards in addition to cash, the customer service is friendly, the wait time is very reasonable (we had an $80 order and it took about 10 minutes), and the prices are fair.

Even living in Vegas you can get quality seafood but it usually entails dining in the very overpriced strip. I was psyched when I heard this food truck was going to be part of the several that swing by my corporate office building. Dealt with the rediculous  $15 pricing for a good truck however woukd have been fine if it had been worth it for quality seafood especially lobster. Split a bunch of stuff with coworkers including lobster rolls and tacos. Everything was horrible and I am still baffled by it. The rolls were 90% bread to 10% lobster and the tacos we even more of a joke. They literally had some slaw thrown on as the majority and had lobster buts literally sprinkled on as if they were flecks from a can of tuna. I had to have lunch somewhere else after as most of my office did who tried them out too. Have never been so underwhelmed in trying out food in Vegas to say the least. I think it's pathetic that a company especially being in a nation show with a shark invested could manage to grow to the point they have with locations and trucks all over the country yet habe absolutely no quality control. How the he'll is that being successful and it is absolutely a crime they have the nerve to charge the beyond above average food truck pricing they do for this kind of crap quality and portions. It has made me never even consider trying their more ""legit"" locations in other states if this is how they run their business, like other typical franchises.

I went into the store to pick up a few things and when I got out they were opened. So I walked up and was about to place my order when the guy told me he has not gotten his credit card machine working yet and If I wanted something I had to pay cash or wait. When I asked him how long the wait was he said he didn't know how long it would be. So I got cash and ordered one Maine roll, one Connecticut roll and a small lobster bisque. He quoted me $43 when in fact it should have been $42. He mumbled something about he thought the soup was $9 and not $8 . When I finally got the food I took it home to share with my wife. Surprisingly when I took it out of the bag it turned out that it was two Connecticut rolls and no Maine one.  We each had a roll and split the soup. The only reason this is a 2 star review and not a one star is the fact that while the portions are small for the price, (Las Vegas has the highest prices of any franchise city) the food is excellent.

Most of the lobster here is not from Maine but thank goodness for the Cousins truck!!! They r always super nice and the Connecticut roll is AMAZING!

5207629,2017-11-01,1,l6TEtn0bxJlXXVnKhwyeAw,"I went here because of Shark Tank, of course, and the fact that I love lobster!  I read many of the Yelp reviews beforehand and knew what to expect.  The Maine lobster roll was small, that's for sure, but it really did have a good amount of lobster in that small roll.  Now, being from Kansas, I am not anywhere near a lobster roll expert (honestly may have had 1 in my life before), so I can't speak to it's place in the lobster roll hierarchy.  But, I thought it was very tasty although expensive as hell for $17...I at least like to get more than a snack for that price.  I would probably try the Connecticut roll on my next trip to Fremont, just to say I did, but if I'm really hungry, I'll take a few more steps to Evel Pie and grab a couple slices for half that price.",T-bbNiVDbGVxxdbQX52KTA,1,0,3,epaTS_eSNhNK8p_7PRSp-A

First of all, for $17.00 I expected the bun to be on a french roll. NOT! It's on a tiny, what looked to be a hot dog bun. Actually, regular hot dog buns are bigger. Secondly, we ordered it ""Connecticut  style"" meaning the lobster is hot. It was completely cold. Lobster was also overcooked. And the lobster amount was tiny and NO CLAW MEAT!

 I finally tried one at the Sunset Park'd festival this past weekend. I expected it to be pricey, most food trucks are plus it's lobster in the desert.  It was super tiny, not a lot of meat. It was way over cooked, liked chewing on rubber, didn't have much taste either. I was so disappointed. I have learned my lesson and will continue to steam a lobster at home when I'm in the mood.
I suggest skipping this food truck.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,14,5,2,LYyVyDI4nPk2TPpKHBnzeA

It's a huge shit pile of mayonnaise underneath some yes good lobster but this sandwich roll is the MOST OVERPRICED AND DISGUSTING lobster roll I have ever had in my life.  NYC Maine hell I've had a better lobster roll in Florida.  

I mean nobody I know wants a four tablespoon helping of Mayo dropping into their mouth with every bite. God I'm repulsed.  I literally want to throw this sandwich to the uncaring person in the truck slopping his low quality no effort crap to us in Summerlin. 

Are you kidding me look people if you've ever had an amazing lobster roll you will be so angered at the crap they give you here. 

The quality of the lobster is great but plain lobster on a roll with a bed of mayo underneath one more time FLAVORLESS DISGUSTING WASTE OF $17 RUN AWAY FROM THIS CRAPPY OVER PRICED TRUCK ! 

If I pay fkn $17 for a lobster roll I want an overfilled sandwich. Not a shitty sandwich that has a tiny amount of lobster and shit ton of mayo. 

God this TRUCK should be banned from Las Vegas ! Period",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,5,2,1,nABhL5EumY4KU6CSAgjFEg

You got the roll right and the amount of lobster was pretty good although slightly pricey.  The main problem I had was that the lobster meat was overcooked and chewy.

The tacos had a good amount of lobster, sauce and cabbage on it within the floor tortilla. I give it a 4/5 since I believe the lobster could have had better/fresh flavor. Overall though, pretty good tacos.",-5ye1ya0wRQhNRF9NfQ1fA,0,0,4,6fJmlJRqFvO9wmH2HXyLTg

The lobster was chewy and stringy, so it being served cold with a glob of mayo was incredibly unappetizing; we threw it out after one bite each. The Connecticut roll was a little better because it's served warm but the lobster was still chewy and stringy. The bread was the best part of both sandwiches.

They definitely served up a solid lobster roll. It was probably one of the purest I've ever had - no mayo, just butter on a perfectly-toasted bun. Served with a lemon!

Not sure it's better than some of the lobster places in the New York area, but I can see how it's a major treat in the NV area. I am excited I got to try it out!",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,4,3,4,VdmITbqn5C6L8hZKsd7xpw

The second time around I wanted to explore the menu so I ordered their shrimp tacos. I know, why order shrimp tacos from a lobster truck right? Well I'm here to stop any future person from ordering them as it is definitely not worth it! You would think you get what you pay for right? The whole taste overall was like eating fish sticks. No flavor at all. I attached a picture and I had to zoom in as the shrimp were so miniscule. Probably smaller than the chopped tomatoes.
