58083,2013-10-24,1,0uR48n5SYcLE_DLcjONZPg,"Ok went to jimmy johns and Firehouse subs to see who's tuna sandwich is better. (For my taste) I know your thinking who goes to firehouse for tuna? This guy does. Plus the lady working the counter was like ""odd two people ordered tuna today.""

They both cost about the same.

Ok first off lets go by how fast food came out. Jimmy johns wins. those dudes pump those things out like nobody's business. I pay and boom sandwich in hand. Firehouse I had to wait a bit longer but still didn't take too long. 

Taste is a toss up. I preferred the actual tuna in the jimmy johns. It had more crunch from the veggies. Now firehouses one held up better because the bread is softer. I feel like my teeth are not sharp enough to bite thou jimmy johns bread sometimes. And when my teeth finally get thou delicious bread, it decides to leak white fluid that will smell and look like all sorts of body fluid.  (You take ur pick.... They all dry white....) 

It's hard to pick a winner because I want to say the flavor is better on the JJ, but I ate more of firehouses. Just because it was easier to eat . I don't want to go about my day smelling like tuna. I'm can't tell you why but i am leaning to jimmy johns don't know why. But still both are leaps and bounds better than subway. Time to go find a breath mint to wash down the shame that is this review. Do people even read these?",hC3VbM-rHX9cLzjlxuJ9jQ,3,1,4,PqimTOGQiPNHiPRimbApjw

We instantly fell in love with the fresh gourmet sandwiches when we took our first bites on our trip to Chicago last year.
To our disappointment, the first location we arrived at per our phone no longer existed while the second location we found was closed on Sundays! :(
we called yet another location to find that they close at 5pm and it was already 4:55.
However, the wonderful boyfriend called them back and asked if they could keep the doors open just until 5:10.  The staff agreed and we raced like maniacs to the third location!!
We didn't arrive until 5:15 but the awesome staff waited for us & we were finally able get our Jimmy John's sandwich!

I'd go again for sure. It's on the top of my list for sandwich shops in the valley.

EDIT: I returned here and got their ""club"" sandwich on their french bread, which is the same sandwich with twice the meat, and that was great. Highly recommend the clubs on french bread.",kBoCLXsjzpSTpOKC9J6FUg,0,0,4,lV1HRe86l1MsN3lG_xINBg

At this location in particular the staff are always really friendly which I greatly appreciate. In some other locations (like the one closest to my home) are not as spot on with their customer service. Oh well, whatcha gonna do. 

Extra tip: If you are also too lazy to not only make your own sandwich but actually leave the house to get it you can make your order for delivery. They are pretty quick too!

BOMB. I had to scarf it down because I had to go to class so was a bit disappointed I wasn't able to fully enjoy it, but it was delicious.

1368066,2018-02-26,1,0uR48n5SYcLE_DLcjONZPg,"Wow when they say they make their sandwich fresh, from house made baked bread to freshly slice deli, cheese, and toppings, it's a win-win. I went for The Veggie ($5.69) which has layers of provolone cheese, real avocado spread, sliced cucumber, shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, mayo, and I requested to add hot peppers. The hot peppers definitely gives The Veggie sandwich a nice spicy kick. And I like the texture of their bread, it makes the sandwich very satisfying. You can purchase a day old bread for 50 cents and it is a great bargain deal.

If you want a tasty dessert, they have cookies sourced from a local vendor in Las Vegas. They have Raisin Oatmeal ($1.75) and Triple Chocolate Chunk ($1.75). I was told to heat in the microwave because it taste better when the cookie is warm. Both cookies taste good. But if I were to choose between the two cookies, I would go for the Triple Chocolate Chunk simply because it's made with good quality Ghirardelli Chocolate Chips.

The service is fast and I like how the ingredients are fresh. It wasn't busy when I came so I had a chance to learn a little history about Jimmy John's. The owner began work at a hot dog stand, and later on he ventured toward building a small business making a simple gourmet sandwich and delivering it fresh. What's impressive is that Jimmy John is always smiling, I was able to see a jolly and cheerful photo of him. This place is a very chill and relaxing environment with good music in the background. They have a large sandwich menu board and I love the positive quotes that are featured on the wall.

I've ventured to JJ's the past three weeks to meow down on a sandwich before my long night class. All 3 times I've arrived at this location, there are 4+ people working behind the counter but it takes a while to get acknowledged to take an order. Whatever, it's all good, I'm in no hurry. But what really put me off during my last visit was a manager taking a few minutes to berate an employee for ringing up a previous order incorrectly. It was strange and very unwelcoming. 

As for the important part (the grub), I have to say the menu is a bit confusing and doesn't cater to my personal tastes at all. I enjoy a sandwich with quality meat and lots of veggies. While I like the bread at JJ's,  I find the turkey cheap and and the veggie selection/quality sad. :-( The sandwiches I've tried (Turkey Tom and something else with a beachy name) lacked any zest or flavor. I got guacamole on a sub once and it was the same stuff Taco Bell uses. I do enjoy the sprouts and salt & vinegar chips, though.

I'm going to give this location 3 stars because it's a great place to kill time in between classes. It's also reasonably priced, clean, and quick. I think I need to take an experienced Jimmy Johner with me to tell me what's good.",B_kRkBxSNYPk-XEZWhbCJg,3,1,3,VeG_vGyzTvp8WnYJTPQPrg

I always get the ""vito"" which is your classic italian sub. Comes with three different kinds of meat and upon request they can add some pepperchini's to it.

They make the sandwiches so fast and are always friendly. They really know how to deal with crowds because I've gone on an extremely busy day during lunch AND was able to get in/out in about 10 min --(for 2 orders that's pretty impressive.)

They are conveniently located in the shopping center that Starbucks is in so it's easy to find AND they deliver fo freeeeee!! Which makes it every college students dream during finals week.

Insanely efficient and incredibly delicious. Jimmy John's never disappoints with the food or service, and prices on par with the major chains.
If you are a fan of the toasted sub (as I am) next time you are considering Quiznos, or Port of Subs, skip it and hit up Jimmy John's, especially if you are in a hurry!
I still give the crown to Capriotti's for Chain Sandwich shop, but Jimmy John's is definitely a close second.

This location of Jimmy John's opened up pretty recently (of course, to my addled brain 'recently' can mean about 5 years ago, but I'm sure this has been within the last year) and I'm pretty bummed I hadn't made the short trip there yet to get one of their yummy sandwiches.

Now, I like sandwiches as much as the next guy (unless you're Joey from Friends - it doesn't go THAT far) but I'm not a big fan of Subway or Port of Subs and the like.  Their meats are grody to me, frankly.  Their breads are never as fresh as I hope they would be, and frankly I'm a little scared of anyone with ""Sandwich Artist"" embroidered on their shirt.  Jimmy John's has none of this stuff.

I gad a turkey club on seven grain wheat bread.  The bread was cut into big, thick slices that were soft and fresh and tasty.  The turkey didn't look sickly or have a thin coating of goo like the other places have, the lettuce and tomato were both colorful and fresh tasting, and the bacon was thick sliced and generous.  I got a bag of BBQ chips that were also thick cut and yummers and a soda and was out of there for under $9.

The lunch crew is always on their A game, energized and friendly. You're acknowledged the second you open the door and they're ready and waiting for your order which will be prepared in less than a minute usually. They recognize their regulars as well. I hadn't been in for a few months over summer and I recently came in and they still remembered my order. Great customer service! And of course the food is delicious. My favorites are #16 with Dijon and you can't go wrong with the #9. Sandwiches are always fresh, delicious, simple and tasty. 

Now if you're going at night it's a COMPLETELY different story (hence the 1 star deduction). I used to come here at night before my night classes but I have stopped doing that. First of all, it's always been pretty empty when I've gone at night so you'd think there would be awesome customer service...wrong. The few times I went at night you have to wait a few minutes to even be acknowledged while the staff continues their conversation (whether it's with their fellow coworkers or their friends who are there eating). Eventually they take your order and make your sandwich at a glacial pace. The entire time you're there you feel like you're inconveniencing them and interrupting their evening.

The UNLV adjacent area is littered with the usual suspects but they also have Mid West staple Jimmy John's throwing their hat into the ring.  While it diversifies the sandwich portfolio, I dont necessarily think it strengthens it.  Thats not to say you cant get a satisfying meal here...

Located in a small strip mall across from the campus, Jimmy John's has a fresh, clean aesthetic and cheerful college kids that keep the place humming.  The roster of sandwiches isnt overwhelming yet most people can find something that suits their tastes.  Ingredients are fresh and simple, yet nothing really wows you.  There are some more novel items like sprouts and 7 grain bread that can be added as accoutrement which is nice if you're looking for a different taste than most chains.  

I find myself at Jimmy Johns from time to time because of its convenience and because I can get a fairly healthy meal there.  When I go, I like the Veggie, Italian and California sandwiches.  None of them will knock your socks off, but you'll still leave in a good mood.....that is if your not starving when you get there.  My one major complaint is the size of the sandwiches and the amount of meat they put in them.  While not expensive (5 to 6 dollar range) they are smaller than I would like.  Im not asking for Cheesecake Factory portions here, but a little girth would be nice.  Maybe its my inner fatboy complaining, but usually my inner fatboy doesn't lie on these matters.  You're from the Mid West Jimmy!  Appetites are hearty there, make your sandwiches reflect that!

JJ's standard sandwich is a 9in sub (also available on sliced whole wheat bread) with an assortment of meats, cheese, and topping.

I'm a big fan of the beach club: double portion of turkey, avocado and provolone, the bootlegger club is also pretty good. At about ~$6 a pop, the sammiches are decently priced but can easily turn into a $10+ meal if you throw in chips and a drink.

A co-worker and I bought a 30 piece tray yesterday to bring lunch to the office for 6 colleagues as a way of saying thanks for all of their hard work recently.
Unfortunately, the sandwiches were spindly and sad.  Very little meat and cheese, gobs of mayo, and overall the most pathetic sandwiches I have seen this side of a prison vending machine.  They were so skinny and wimpy, I kept opening the sandwich to see if anything was in there.
It kind of reminded me of being on a field trip in Kindey Garden and they hand out sac lunches with some sad vacant sandwiches that have been smushed under 80 other sac lunches.

The sandwiches were so anemic, I felt like I now have to go buy lunch for my colleagues AGAIN to prove I wasn't trying to insult them by feeding them those skinny-ass, wish sandwiches.   And they put onions on the sandwiches which we specifically requested be excluded.

It must have been the person making trays just throws them together.  Very disappointing.

The only redemption of the poor sandwiches was it becoming a topic of humor and ridicule during lunch and provided for quite comedic relief during lunch.

Ordered around noon for delivery between 2:15 and 2:30.  At 2:20 I saw that my order was not out for delivery yet.  No big deal, they are usually very fast, but I called just to make sure that it was on its way.  I was told that the driver had a couple of deliveries just before mine but that it would be to me soon.  Awesome, no problem.  

2:45 rolls around, no food.  Since my lunch is about to be over I call again.  The person who answered the phone was the same person as before and seemed surprised that I had not received my food yet.  They were very apologetic and offered to credit my account.  I do understand that things happen and was appreciative of that offer.  I check the app a few minutes later and it has updated that my order is out for delivery...as of 2:43, which was right when I called the second time.  Convenient.  

My order FINALLY arrives at 3:18, a full hour past the start of the delivery window.  The delivery driver was apologetic and said that they had a rush and got swamped, but both calls I made to the store gave me no indication that there was any reason my order should have taken that long.

Twice I ordered a large amount of sandwiches and asked for them to be individually bagged (which I know is a hassle for jimmy johns but Gabby assured me they would make an exception and there would be no issues since I ordered so far in advance) we explained when we need them and why it's important for them to be on time (having over 20+ people waiting for their lunches is an important reason to be punctual - not sure if Gabby is aware)

When a business takes the time to order a day or two ahead and you promise the order will be successful you should be doing anything in your power to fulfill that promise instead giving up or just tell the truth and say that it's not possible and is going to take longer so I can make other arrangements. 
Gabby ""attempted"" to make the situation better by offering us $30 credit on our next order (two different times so a total of $60 credit) but gabby lied to us and never added any credit to our account.

I can however eat salami as its a cold processed meat and does not contain the possible bacterial contamination of deli meats. I asked if they could make me just a salami sandwich, he informed me they have one that's half salami and half capicola that they could pick off the capicola. I'm not satisfied with that response for two reasons, 1 capicola is a deli meat and the bacteria would transfer to the salami thus defeating the purpose. Then secondly I was told he could not substitute the capicola for salami that I would have to pay a double meat charge.

Even though I can expense my meals I'm not too excited about spending ~$30 on an average tasting meal that is usually on the unhealthy side and/or when it causes time on the porcelain throne.

Subway pales in comparison when it comes to taste, quality and freshness and usually Subway causes time on the throne so I tend to shy away from that place.  My current favorites are Beach Club, because I love sprouts, and Italian Night Club.

I'm not sure what is ""Gourmet"" about their sandwiches, but mine was far from gourmet. It was far from Subway for that matter....
First off.... they don't serve hot sandwiches, only cold. Sweet.
Secondly.... I asked for something like a turkey club and they served me a 6 inch sub with lettuce, mayo, turkey, tomatoes and bacon. That's it. When I was ordering, I told the woman at the register that it was my first time here and I was hoping to have something that would bring me back.... She was deaf apparently.
The bacon was so weak that Subway bacon would've turned its nose up at it.... It was barely cooked and half raw.
They gave me 2 thin slices of turkey for every 4 inches of sub. The turkey wasn't roasted, baked or offered any flavor whatsoever. It was grocery store bought turkey, slattered with mayo on a sub roll.
The roll wasn't bad, but far from Gourmet.
The restaurant was clean and painted very fun, but it didn't get close to making up for my crappy sandwich. 
I gave it two stars because it's almost impossible to mess up a turkey sandwich, and although they didn't mess it up, they did leave a lot of be desired.

Their sandwiches are around $5 for an 8"" sandwich, which is a great price for a good sandwich.  The service is extremely fast, and the service is friendly, which always makes it easier to come back.  

The sandwiches are what really bring me back, though.  My favorite sandwich is The Vito.  The Vito is a classic Italian grinder, and is one of the most popular things at Jimmy Johns.  I always get the hot peppers, too, which makes the sandwich that much better.  I also really like the BLT, and the Roast Beef and Provolone.  I can't remember what these are called, but the menu's not too confusing to figure out.  

The sandwiches are all made to order, and come out VERY fast.  Usually your sandwich is done by the time you finish getting your fountain drink.  Which brings up another great thing about Jimmy Johns, their fountain drinks.  I usually don't mention fountain drinks as being great, but they have Cherry Coke.  I always like to give props to any restaurant that has Cherry Coke, as it is a rarity, yet is one of the best sodas on the market.

I had seen some of Jimmy John's signage on buses...A little over the top but innovative.  Yesterday the work crew was unsuspectingly hoodwinked into attending a motivation seminar at the Thomas & Mack that was a mix of religious evangelism, tin salesman and how many sheep can you fit in one room.  

At around 11:30am I realized that I was not buying Jesus half-off so let the boss know I was going to take a long lunch.  Since this was at the Thomas&Mack and I quickly realized that after the event collected our precious $10 for parking, those attendants were long gone by 11am and I better leave my car parked and go for a walk.

I texted the g/f for lunch ideas and she informed me there was a nearby Metro Pizza...YAY!  She always eats there so I wanted to give it a shot.  I walked to the intersection of Maryland Parkway and Trop and looked towards Smart and Final but did not recognize or see Metro.  So, I asked a hip-looking college girl for directions thinking they know all the good eateries.  She pulled out her ear-buds and quickly remarked that Metro was closed up.  What?  Turns out they weren't but my hunger precipitated a quick Plan B.

As I started to stroll north on Maryland Parkway, I noticed this JJ's tucked into a dive strip mall 200 yards from actual Parkway next to a ethnic grocery.  Seemed like a strange location for such a well-branded sub shop.

Nice layout when you walk with a large menu.  Everyone is friendly and they greet you.  I was not sure what the difference was between their ""sub"" or their ""club"" with a $1 price difference.  Turns out they are all subs but the ""clubs"" have more meat, etc.  I got some sort of ham sub on a white roll with salt/vinegar chips and drink for $8 and some change.  They have an upstairs seating area for about 20 people which is nice.

If I have eaten a gillion subs, with this economy it seems everyone is trying to get sneaky.  One way is to sell you their branded chips with about 8 chips in the bag.  JJ's chip bag was a real bag of chips.

Would I consider this a ""gourmet"" sandwich?  NO.  Was it good?  Yes.  I also respect their location.  Why pay premium rent to be right on Maryland Parkway.  SInce this is the UNLV 'hood, the percentage of pedestrians and cars might actually be 50/50.  So, if they are banking on good food at a decent price, these kids will find the place as I did.",BzEf4f8nNYz3SCb_qA66DA,3,1,4,8Nv4333yfbRGFe7BMsM_gw

I love Jimmy Johns and the fact that this location delivers to my place of employment has been the greatest thing about my lunch experiences at work. I have ordered successfully and haven't had a single issue with an order or delivery at any time during the 6 years.  A few weeks ago, I was hoping to surprise an amazing coworker with a Jimmy Johns lunch on me! I told her not to bring a lunch from home since we were going to enjoy sandwiches from our favorite place. I placed my order online, as I have done a gazillion times, and received a confirmation that the order would arrive by 11:45 am. When I went to the main office to pick up the order (again I've done that plenty of times) I realized my order was missing, however, another order was sitting there just waiting to be claimed. The office informed me that the person who had ordered the unclaimed meal, had canceled the order due to timing issues but the order was still delivered. I thought ""JJ's must have mixed up our orders and cancelled the wrong order. No big deal, mistakes happen, right?!"" Assuming this mistake was no fault of my own, and a simple, non-intentonal mistake by Jimmy Johns, I figured I would call, inform them politely about by concerns, and the situation would be rectified quickly and I would still be able to provide my amazing coworker with a much deserved Jimmy Johns lunch. Unfortunately, I was transferred to multiple employees and after explaining the situation multiple times, kindly, I was connected with someone named ""Gabby"". When I explained the situation, Gabby immediately became defensive, accepted zero responsibility, and even went as low as to tell me someone called and cancelled my order. When I told her that was virtually impossible, she reassured me the person who called to cancel the order, repeated my order ""verbatim"" and therefore, they cancelled the order. Gabby- insisted she was right and acted as if what I thought happened, and did happen, was completely wrong. All I could think about was the fact she still hadn't said one thing about trying to fix the situation!!! I still wanted my Jimmy Johns!!  I have never met someone like Gabby who works in an industry to meet the needs of customers, treat a one with such disrespect and disregard! Anyway, the order sitting in the office, unclaimed, was the order they were suppose to cancel...obviously...not mine, which by the way, could never have been repeated ""verbatim"" since it was a totally different sandwich order. Throughout my incredible effort to explain the fact that no one called to called MY order...completely impossible...Gabby NEVER once took the time to explore the situation further or even attempt to understand what actually occurred. Instead of accepting responsibility for canceling the wrong order, which I would have graciously understood, her response was to insist I had called, recited the order ""verbatim"" and asked for it to be cancelled. So, there I sat...no lunch...starving, no lunch for my coworker, who I insisted not bring lunch from home that day because it was my treat to provide her with an amazing lunch from Jimmy Johns ?, feeling disrespected, unheard, and completely unvalued as a dedicated customer. I ended up informing Gabby that even after years and years of excellent customer service from this Jimmy Johns location, she- in one outrageous display of the inability to accept a mistake, that could have been easy rectified- chose to approach me as a dumb customer who called to cancel my own lunch order that my coworker and I had been looking forward to all week long. As if that wasn't bad enough...I had to contact my coworkers who ACTUALLY cancel their completely different order-which never actually got cancelled- that they would have to put in the effort to get the Jimmy Johns order removed for their credit card since they had been charged for the same order they respectfully cancelled appropriately. I am not a YELP reviewer and it has taken me weeks to write this, but this situation was one I could not let go unnoticed. No person, such as Gabby, should be handling situations such as this- especially when dealing with dedicated, satisfied, understanding, and forgiving customers.  A simple, ""Oh, man. That was our mistake. Let me fix that for you."" would have turned an already awesome customer into an even happier one.  Instead, the opposite occurred because of the blatent disrespected towards a customer who just wanted to check up on her lunch order that hadn't arrived on time. I will never, nor will my affected coworkers, ever place an order with this Jimmy Johns location. My suggestion would be that Gabby never again be the default person to handle such situations. It's sad that a situation that could have been an opportunity to display great customer service, this was the outcome.",R8To6ciIBUfyrCeJs9JuQg,2,1,1,rNXj0nQcw3iOQJ8pHPStGg
