The menu is not apt for me, It is a steak house yes I know but you have to order and pay a separate price for sides. 30-50 for just the steak! Then you order your sides with is another 10-20 bucks. 
The wine was great selections.
The steaks come out in sizzling hot plates. Honestly we had to take the steak out of the hot plate and put it in another because it was sizzling and splatting grease. To hot to eat.

598600,2011-11-04,0,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"The Ruth's Chris in Vegas is a good solid restaurant, but with so many steak options in Vegas, I can understand why people would pass it up for a more glamorous Vegas style dining experience.  It gets lost among the glitzy upscale restaurants, but then again, they have Ruth's Chris across the nation and some folks go to Vegas to experience things unique to Sin City.  Although the dining experience is a bit sterile, you will walk out satisfied and ready to take on more of Vegas.  

Pros:
Good food
Efficient service and staff

Cons:
Sterile and lacks character - not Vegas like

I like Ruth's Chris for the same reason I like other chain restaurants - familiarity and a fairly consistent dining experience.  The food is good and of high quality, and you will hardly ever walk out hungry or disappointed.  There are tons of steak restaurants in Vegas, ranging from ""super cheap"" to ""you've got to be kidding me"" expensive, so do your research and compare options before dropping upwards of $50+ per person without drinks or appetizers.      

In most cities, a Ruth's Chris would be considered a ""fancy"" or near ""top tier"" dining experience, but unfortunately in Vegas, it's just another restaurant.  I like that it's quieter than a Strip restaurant and with most of the pretentious folks eating at more ""upscale"" establishments, you can bet that the restaurant will be less crowded and the atmosphere more relaxed - you would hardly know that you were eating in Las Vegas.  

The service at this location is pretty consistent with the other locations - efficient and professional, though distant.  I think the servers at Ruth's Chris do a wonderful job: they take your order and come around to check on you, but don't expect a lot of personality from the wait staff or the restaurant.  It's a great place to eat good food, but it's not necessarily a place you go to be wowed...unless you're wowed by a beautiful cut of filet sizzling on the hot plate.  Don't get me wrong, this is a nice place to eat unless you're absolutely expecting to be blown away (Vegas style) by the experience.  By the way, our wait person didn't inform us of the specials they were running.  It's no biggie, but I could've saved $20-30.

Ruth's Chris in Vegas might not deliver on style and may not be one of the ""hot"" places to eat, but you can always rely on a good meal comparable to most steak restaurants in Vegas.  It is one of my favorite places to get a filet, but in Vegas, the competition is just too stiff for an outright recommendation. 

I'm giving it 3 stars on Yelp though it deserves 3.5 stars:
4 stars for the food but the overall experience only earned 3 stars because of the numerous options in Las Vegas.",-sIsgLLcH4m1exAh5zyprg,1,0,3,sIPvTuLOHMn1FfOSfRw4sA

986176,2007-09-15,0,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"If your idea of a good steak involves a trip to the Outback Steakhouse, you should check out Ruth's Chris sometime.  Sure, it's more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  There are better steaks out there (I prefer Delmonico in Vegas), but they are really, really good here (I'd give it a 4.5 if Yelp allowed it).  I think the side dishes are quite tasty, but nothing amazing.

The sizzling butter is a nice touch.  That said, someone once recommend to me that I order my steak with extra butter.   I'd advise against that unless you are at a Ruth's Chris location in close proximity to a hospital.  Extra butter at Ruth's Chris will kill you.

The service was friendly and on the ball. Our server was pleasant, as was the lady who assisted him throughout. 

The lighting here is different from the Ruth's Chris locales I've been to in California, but I thought it was great. The place has an old-man's steakhouse feel to it. Dimly lit and paneled in dark wood throughout, I could easily see the Rat Pack dining here after a show. 

The food, as expected, was excellent. My filet was delicious, well-seasoned and juicy and tender. My fiancee ordered the Stuffed Chicken, which is a half-chicken stuffed with cheeses and herbs. I thought she was crazy for ordering chicken at Ruth's, but the dish was awesome. The flavors in the cheese/herb mix were amazing, and the chicken itself was tender and juicy. 

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Sin Cake. If you like chocolate this is the dessert to get. Enough said. 

This place is open 'til 3 AM, but you might want to make reservations to be on the safe side. I found the location a bit odd (it's in the middle of a strip mall), but other than that, an excellent restaurant.",1KIk3BYAo6DmNgEp-xIi1w,0,0,5,lOAgyolC6FZ_CsdmT_CtrA

I first experienced Ruth's Chris in Beverly Hills many years ago and enjoyed it.  Since then I have been back to Ruth's Chris at the Beverly Hills location (once) and this Las Vegas location (twice).

My experiences since that first visit haven't been good.  I have found the steaks to be way too salty and buttery.  In addition, they are a little dry for my taste.  Everything else (from salads, sides, desserts) are mediocre at best.

1764301,2009-02-17,2,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"I am deeply conflicted on rating this place. On the one hand, the food here was awesome... as expected. On the other hand, they really put a damper on my valentine's day dinner! My bf and I were headed to Vegas for the 3 day weekend, and decided we wanted to eat at Ruth's Chris for Valentine's Day. I made the reservations sometime last week for this location on Paradise Rd, since we had eaten at the other location last time we were out there. 

We hopped in a cab and headed over to the restaurant for our 7:15 reservation, only to find a line of at least 20 people out the door (all with reservations as well). Come to find out, they had overbooked their reservations and were running AT LEAST one hour behind on seating people. I, along with many other people there, was pretty pissed off. I mean, what is the point of making reservations, ESPECIALLY on a busy night like Valentine's day, if you still have to wait an hour. I felt especially bad for people who had tickets to shows later in the evening who were trying to decided whether they could wait that long to eat dinner and still make it to the show. And to add insult to injury, the first employee we came in contact with after waiting 15 minutes out in the cold just to get in the door, was oblivious and just asking how long the line was and shocked to hear it was out to the taxi drop off area. They should have sent someone out to inform people of what was going on and apologize. 

So we check in with the hostess, and then head over to the bar, clearly some vodka was in order to check my rage. The bar was packed with other disgruntled would-be diners. About an hour to an hour and a half after arriving, we were finally taken back to a table. And from there on out the experience was as expected, the service and food were really good. It's just a total bummer to get all pissed off before such a nice dinner.

1942843,2010-10-15,1,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"I tried this place for breakfast a long time ago in Los Angeles and never forgot how incredible the steak tasted. I just recently tried this location (Vegas) recently for an early dinner. This location does look dated and does not give the food and service any justice. Don't be intimidated by the looks of this place exteriorly, the ambiance inside is decent. 

The server started with their bread and butter, which was average. Soon after, he dropped off a stacked basket of Garlic Bread with cheese. I love garlic and not being biased, it was simply perfect! Next was their Sliced Tomato and Onion salad. They definitely don't mess around with their tomatoes, I mean they were chunky, juicy and delicious (I love tomatoes). The bleu cheese wasn't overpowering like I thought and everything together was well balanced and tasty! I also had the chopped salad. This was ok, it was served with a huge pile of breaded onion ring/strings on top and well poritoned overall. As a starter/appetizer, I tried the Veal Osso Buco Ravioli. It came with 4 pieces swimming in the sauce. The ravioli was good and the sauce made it better. 

The Main Event: I ordered the Ribeye Medium Well (I like the center just slightly pink). It came sizzling in its own buttery sauce and smelled like it fell from the sky. Cutting through it took minimal effort and biting on it was no different. It was cooked exactly to my liking, had just the right amount of chew and the flavor was so succulent, I almost fell off my chair! Let me tell you, their ribeye steak is one of the best I've ever had! 

* The service was Excellent.. Server was patient and delightful. The server assistant was attentive. The chef actually came out to serve the steak along side our server, we actually had an intersting conversation table side. The manager even came by to greet us and made sure everything was going well.

Somewhat (very) inebriated, a few friends and I took a cab to Ruth's Chris for dinner. The server asked if we'd like some water. Dehydrated and sloppy, we all said yes. The server brought a carafe of water which we slammed in a few seconds. ""Another?"" the server asked, ""yes please!"" we responded in unison. This went on a few times throughout the night. We probably had eight to ten carafes of water. 

We get the bill, and lo and behold. This water was bottled Fiji brand water! I'm okay with paying fifty bucks for a nice piece of meat at a steakhouse, but fifty bucks for water?!! The server should have been upfront and asked ""tap or bottled?"" instead of slamming us with his silent upsale. 

Oh, and like everyone else said, the steak is overrated. If you like butter, then this is your place. The steaks are smothered in butter rendering it on the verge of being inedible.",YKT0lqXc8U8HqH8Zqitynw,4,1,1,UEhxyEGaJ5x82VKHDKKidw

With that said, though, I have had steak that was equal to or even slightly better than the petite filet I had here, and slightly less expensive.  The blue-cheese crust was tasty, but a bit skimpy in portion.  The mashed potatoes?  Tasty, but not inspired.

The lobster bisque soup, though?  That was absolutely heavenly!  The best I've ever had.  And, perhaps amusingly, the garlic-cheese bread was also quite delicious!

Our waiter was friendly and helpful... present enough be useful, but not to the degree of being pestery.

Anyway, there were 14 of us in town for an event, and Ruth's Chris was offering a 3-course prix fixe menu for $40 or $50 depending on your entree. The complete meal offered at $39.95 includes a choice of Steak House Salad, Caesar Salad or Louisiana Seafood Gumbo, followed by a choice of Ruth's Chris signature eight-ounce Petite Filet, Stuffed Chicken Breast, Barbecued Shrimp, or the Chef's Fresh Island Fish selection.

Diners may upgrade their meal to the $49.95 entrÈe option to select from the 11-ounce Filet with Grilled Shrimp, Veal Chop with Hot and Sweet Peppers, 16-ounce Ribeye Steak, or Lobster tail with blackening spice, lemon and drizzled butter 

I, in a slight prescription drug induced fog, thought I had ordered the ribeye just like my 2 co-workers sitting across from me had. Unfortunately I received (and vaguely recall hearing myself say) the filet. My choice of appetizer and side dish was the house salad with a zesty French dressing and the garlic mashed pots.

The salad was good with a flavorful and slightly tangy. The garlic mashed was only so-so at best. They tasted a bit off and were somewhat crusty as though they had been under a heat lamp for a while. Next time, I get the mushrooms like my mother taught me! Now the steak... aside from being slightly undercooked and much closer to rare than medium rare, the flavor was AWESOME. Without a doubt the best piece of meat I've ever eaten! 

Unfortunately after the entree is where this experience took a turn for the worse... We all had finished and were sitting there waiting for the plates to be cleared, water to be refilled, dessert to be brought... aaaaannnnnndddddd.... nothing. Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Finally one of our group had to go up to the maitre d' and complain about the lack of service.

As it turned out, or so we were told, another large group being handled by our waitress decided to ask for seperate checks once the bill arrived and then were having credit card issues on top of that, tying her up trying to get them out the door. Anyway, moving on...

The dessert course came and was a pairing of strawberries in a vanilla creme along with a chocolate mousse with whipped cream in a fluted cup made of (dark?) chocolate. Absolutely delicious!!

All in all, the experience was more positive than negative. Aside from the fact that management should've (and according to the waitress was requested by her to) handled the other difficult table, I was thoroughly impressed. Bon appetit!!",p_KduMgnPb4nULgzxj_w3A,0,0,3,noD5q49ct4IrXDI8Z1V4OQ

Except instead of getting drunk and flashing you at the bar, Ruth's chris' reputation is outstanding service, and the most delicious aged steaks that money can buy. (and believe you me, you'll need to bring some money with you) however, my first experience with this wonderful chain of steak houses was in Baltimore, and after that wonderful experience, the las Vegas cousin didn't quite blow my mind.  Yes, the steak and sides were equally amazing.  Yet the restaurant layout was a wee bit cramped, and the service seemed more Applebees-esque than what you'd expect from a restaurant with such high esteem.  
And for the 121.00 dollars I spent on dinner, you think they'd be able to afford to, perhaps, turn on a light or two, it was the DARKEST restaurant I've ever dined in.  
That being said, I give them four stars, which for a regular establishment, is pretty solid, but for a 'five star' restaurant... It's no bueno.
My recommendation, have at least two

There are two Ruth Chris Steakhouse in Vegas.  Both of them are  fine restaurants.  

-Filet Mignon (Comes in two sizes: 12 oz and Petite 6oz) : Cooked to perfection.  They charred the outside and juicy throughout.

-Mash Potatoes (All sides are big enough to share, they are family style): Fluffy and buttery.

-Asparagus (again big enough to share):  Cooked just perfect and not over done.

-French Onion Soup- It had a great crispy outter shell and the soup was not too salty like some places.  This is a must have.

Onion soup was good, NY Strip good, filet was just OK. The au gratin was fabulous and the asparagus tasted like they cooked it last week. We had to ask for more drinks. When a place cost as much as this one the food and service should be outstanding. Personally I prefer food at Outback. I have to say this place SUCKS. Also had to pay some old guy who called himself valet to move a cone so we could self park. Parking is bad in this center.Carpet is old and dirty. People at the front desk chomping gum. The whole place just lackluster. Very disappointing.",FAsoP7gzkDmFdP-eYuysmw,2,2,2,xjuH9Y3VVlIzxnJrjnBY8Q

5586764,2011-08-30,2,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"Maybe it was because my date was so well known here, or maybe it really was my winning smile and hot shoes, who knows? All I know is that I was treated like royalty and had one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.

We started at the bar, sharing a lovely cabernet and some conversation with the bartenders and the maitre d'. Part of me wants to call it glad-handing, but (and I can say this about every time I had been here), the staff truly was happy to see us, ask my friend for updates on his goings-on, and make sure that we were extremely well taken care of. We took our time, never feeling rushed, and just enjoyed our time.

When we decided we were ready to be seated, we were ushered into a private booth in what was, for most of our meal, a private room. The bottle we brought with us was waiting on the table. Once we settled in, it was decanted and shared (of course!) with our waiter, Tommy, and Jay, the maitre d'. Our order was taken, and the expert, personal service continued.

The lobster bisque was fantastic. Creamy, rich, and with a depth of flavor I rarely find. It was truly one of the best I have had. 

*tangent*

I would love to do a taste test between this and the one at the Grotto at Golden Nugget... also one of my faves. Might have to plan that. Any takers? ;) Ahhh, I digress.

*/tangent*

The lobster tail was prepared very well, buttery with a generous portion of garlic. It came cut up and not on the tail. This is fine, though I would have preferred it slightly less cooked; the broil on the end was unnecessary in my opinion. However, it was still sweet, tender and beautifully done. The potatoes he ordered to go with his lobster were OK. Not amazing, but done well.

My filet with blue cheese crust was absolutely, spot-on, perfect. Rare with a cool red center, the blue cheese crust just slightly browned, and seasoned well. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender.

The service was, if you haven't guessed it yet, the highlight of the night. We declined dessert but opted for the recommended second bottle of wine. Tommy's choice was great and inspired a lovely conversation about wine, origins, vintages, and (most important!) ""drinkability.""

One of the best parts? I had shared earlier a story about how this restaurant was the first steakhouse I had been to in Vegas... brought here by my late father almost 2 decades ago and taught how to properly order a charred-rare, blue cheese filet. Well, this got back to Marcel, the owner, who came over and spoke with me a bit, trying to remember my Dad, and sharing stories of his own. There was something so touching, so sweet about his appearance and willingness to share.

We were well fed and everyone made us feel welcome, honored, and important. Aside from the OK potatoes and the personal preference on the lobster, this was a perfect, five-star, par excellence experience.

As I kissed Marcel on the cheek on my way out, I promised I would be back.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,2,5,AQDiKgZmFQoQ5rdfr9VdRg

5683439,2009-11-11,0,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"Steak is a complete food. It has all the protein, fat and deliciousness I could ever want in a food. 

Now I have been to other Ruth Chris steak houses before. They are steak artists. On this particular occasion though, I was left a bit wanting. 
I will say, I wasn't at my best when I went to this particular Ruth Chris. It was at the end of a long booze filled weekend and we had an hour and a half to kill before we needed to be at the airport. I figured going back to San Diego with a belly full of delicious red meat and wine was an excellent choice. 

Right off, this Ruth Chris seemed a bit dated. There were no windows where we got seated and we were right in the path of the kitchen so we had frequent flybys from waiters and waitresses. I didn't so much mind as wondered why we got this table, on a slow Sunday evening. The server was nice enough, nothing special though. Like the waitress in ""Reservoir Dogs""...""she was nice!...um, she was ok. She only refilled my coffee three times. I'm used to it being refilled six times!"" and so on. I ordered the New York strip which I thought they would get spectacularly as they always do. I ordered it medium rear with a potato on the side. 

When I got it, I looked a little scrawny to be a 12 oz but oh well. It was a bit overdone and it was pretty greasy. It was served in a deeper dish than usual so a lot of the grease just pooled. 

I got through my overdone steak ok. I didn't want to be ""that guy"" and make a big deal but I was disappointed. I would go again and definitely the one here in SD though.",gFRrT8kQseKgKp8gMC9fkg,1,0,3,fbx9KYUvTWAyNq60NLjcJg
5737972,2010-12-06,0,qA4MWdUmaXYkrZ223cFfFA,"Wow.....I read some reviews here before we embarked on this fiasco last night. Shoulda listened to the naysayers. Unfortunately, what sent us there was a $100 gift certificate. Shoulda wasted the gift certificate instead. Woulda gone to Delmonicos or ANY other steak house in LV. Coulda had a better steak at ANY steakhouse in LV. While I was leery of the decor and cleanliness, I was not at all put out by the ambience and decor. I guess I should give a few points for a pleasant server. That is where any positives end. Ordered escargot and a huge disappointment. Maybe 4 in a sauce with mushrooms that disguise themselves as snails. Both salads were so NOT memorable that I can't remember what they were. There was a big banner on the menu to ask the waiter about  the complementary  Oscar addition to any entree.  The server described it as a few ounces of king crab, sauce bearnaise and grilled asparagus. He did not however explain the cost of the complementary oscar addition. I have to admit that I did not think it would be free, but each Oscar added $40 to the price of the steak. I find that absurd. Just call me tight ass :) Steaks were not juicy.....just kinda mealy. To add to the lovely evening, we both got food poisoning symptoms in the middle of the night. I will spare you the ugly details. I will say that I wish I could have been able to share that delight with Ruth's Chris Steakhouse . Woulda, shoulda, coulda!",Q3Y0AjsTpuJuQ-TWZOlVzg,0,0,1,Hych1rribv9OUW3QTd352A

Salty like a salt lick. Eeee haw...

Amongst 6 girls we got 3 summer special. It includes: 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides and 1 dessert for about $90 bucks.

Salad- Good. 5 Stars.
Creamed spinach- 3 Stars.
Filet- Burnt. 3 Stars.
Mashed Potatoes- 5 Stars
Mushrooms- Soooo salty! 0 Stars.
Free range chicken- 5 Stars.

The entree choices were: fish, filet, some other stuff and some other stuff. But the best bang for your buck was the mixed grill entree choice. The mixed grill comes with a filet (4 oz), free range chicken, and a crab cake. I would say go for the mixed grill instead of just choosing a fish or filet (6 oz) entree.",BvmQlN2khHCcowR8cUWtBQ,2,1,3,BlI38WwG_K-NLFB-f6yjpQ
