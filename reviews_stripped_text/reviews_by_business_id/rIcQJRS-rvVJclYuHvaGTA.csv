1048316,2017-09-12,0,rIcQJRS-rvVJclYuHvaGTA,I can't think of one thing wrong with this place. Recently updated looks awesome. Owner is usually there which makes everything go smooth. Staff is always welcoming and smiling. Can get busy especially during lunch hour. Please order online and skip the line. And food is delicious. If you are a subway fan please make sure you try it at least once you won't regret it because they cut the meat and cheeses right in front of you not like other sandwich places. I just love it !!!!,IStpMPEkoqW-Q98hyjwwxQ,0,0,5,tTRdnLtQAdZLQUTiY7iHuw

The owner then came out and suggested that I call to make sure all went well on Saturday. I called and spoke with Melanie. She said that she would get everything ready for me and I can pick up. I arrived at the location and she told me what she had ready suggested some things for me. It took minutes to get it paid and I was out the door!  I have never met a more pleasant and friendly staff.

They rush for absolutely NO reason, my meat was hanging out of my sandwich like a 5 year old made it, I asked for wheat, she gave me white so I had to correct her, then she cut my meat before even HAVING THE BREAD READY, that's why the meat was uneven! I've been eating Port of Subs for 8+ years and this is the worst store I've been to. They have the Subway mentality, just throw shit on the bread!",Qu1s7qhYztgmM4KV2x1yLQ,0,0,1,RRJQekaQTLMHFBRuDkBLKQ

If you're going to charge $8.00 for a Pastrami sandwich, you should put a good amount of Pastrami in it. What I should of done was Cancel my order when I noticed the Pastrami.

I went for lunch at 11:15 and stood there alone for 10 minutes watching one employee work on a catering order. Yes they only had one employee during lunch and she was in NO hurry. She said ""I'll be right with you"" and then disappeared in the back. By this time I was done. I left and went elsewhere. 

I will never go back to this location and would not recommend it to anyone.",TVQLrtlp1kGb3NvWWdBDGw,2,0,1,_-jN54V0emut-Z29rRjo9A

4451976,2011-07-02,1,rIcQJRS-rvVJclYuHvaGTA,"Sammiches, sammiches... I love 'em. They're so quintessential to American everyday life so I love having a lot of options of sandwich places where I live. 

Port of Subs has been a favorite of mine since college. My first big time crush/love worked at Port of Subs for many years so it was always good for me to go out of my way to get my sandwiches at POS.

This one is okay. As it is the closest to my house it is the one I go to normally. The staff here is really young, gotta be high school students. Not that that's a bad thing, but sometimes when I walk in here I get the vibe that says: ""WHAT are you doing here? WE don't want to actually work!"" Yah. And then you gotta order your sandwich from an angry little teenager and watch them to make sure it gets made how you want it. Which is not a problem because you do get to watch them make it - I love that. Especially since you can just easily ask ""Hey can I get a few more pickles?"" 

I like their mayo/mustard combo and the fact that they slice the meat right there before putting it on your sandwich. Usually I get a #5 (turkey, ham, smoked cheddar), but yesterday I got the #3 (turkey, salami, cheddar). Typically I don't go for the salami-type meats, but it turned out pretty good! The reason I ended up getting that sandwich was because I said ""I want a number 3, er I meant 5"", but apparently the lady did not hear my correction. Oh well, her mistake kind of made my day, because I got to try a new sandwich and I liked it! However, still kind of bad that she wasn't listening to me enough to hear me correct myself.

Oh well, all in all I like POS. If you go here often make sure to get their stamp card so you can eventually get a free sandwich!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,1,3,E4YvktFpQ0lAFHsyh4B84A
4933084,2011-07-21,0,rIcQJRS-rvVJclYuHvaGTA,"I purchased two subs (roast beef and pastrami),  my first time buying anything and I will never go back. The bread isn't all that fresh to me and neither is the meat. It smelled like it was just starting to spoil. The service was bad. She needed more pickles while making my sandwich so she put her hand in a container and grabbed a handful while dripping pickle juice every where then she used the same plastic glove wet with pickle juice to fix my sandwich. When I said I don't like my bread wet she was dumb founded as if she had no idea she was doing something wrong. NOT A PLACE YOU WANT TO VISIT.",q0N61z8h2dj3NxdU2_uwWA,0,0,1,k7lrEO3ljTo-VE_h1a0MyQ
5102936,2015-02-27,0,rIcQJRS-rvVJclYuHvaGTA,Its not hard to make a sub.... I've never been to a Port of Subs. I can not believe this location is in business. The bread wasn't cooked...

5345802,2015-04-04,0,rIcQJRS-rvVJclYuHvaGTA,"I love Port of Subs for a reliably good sandwich! They have a wheat bread option and the cold cuts are freshly sliced as you order. The prices are decent. 

This particular location isn't my favorite. The employees are actually REALLY friendly. But the lunch crowd makes it impossible to get in and out quickly. The restaurant is also really small and cramped. Weekday lunch rush also occasionally means dirty tables. I know it's only because the employees can't be making sandwiches and cleaning at the same time. 

I love these sandwiches so I won't let the lunch crowd keep me away. But I think you can order online and it might make the process just a little quicker (you still have to wait on the line of people ordering their sandwiches to get your online order).",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,0,0,3,86kPic-zHMgE7KEMmPRRwg

Once we started ordering the young man kept messing up our orders it was to the point where we had to tell him about seven times what we wanted on our sub. When he finally was done making our subs correctly we decided to eat there, well as we began eating I noticed the two workers were mumbling and the young man was basically giving us the evil eye as he gossiped away with his coworker. Who at the moment was cleaning or should I say sanitizing the slicing machine and in that time about 4 different customers walked out due to this, I'm not sure how the owner is running this place but they definitely need to take a closer look into who they're hiring to run their business.",nAbQPtFdUABGD8EaklqwGw,1,0,1,MEYxny5GVPjqOaxN6tAsUw
5508996,2017-04-17,0,rIcQJRS-rvVJclYuHvaGTA,"Shot out to the owner and employees at Port of Subs on Pecos and Dessert Inn in Las Vegas! I went there today for lunch with my boyfriend. We dined in and I hung my purse on the chair as we ate. The food was great! We left and not too long after, I got a Facebook message from the owner letting me know that I left my purse there. I called the store and spoke to the owner who was super professional and I told him I'd be on my way. I got there and the owner gave me my purse. I'm so grateful not only for getting my purse back just the way left if, but also for their excellent customer service and great food! I recommend this particular Port of Subs to all my friends in the area!

I hope he wasn't making your to go order. I literally stood there and watched him and he continued to make a joke of it.
