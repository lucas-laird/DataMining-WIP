2882213,2015-12-25,0,b0M6rZu3hgCSYs_v6SvP6w,"I ordered a bunch of food on Christmas eve via the Eat24 app.  I used a ""coupon"" from their menu to get a deal for a 2-topping pizza & wings.  I also ordered a couple of other entrees (including the large meat plate), setting up hopes for a tasty feast that would last well into Christmas day.  Sadly, it didn't quite go down as I'd imagined it.

The first issue occurred about 45 minutes after I placed the order.  Eat24 called me to say the restaurant doesn't offer the ""coupon"" price I ordered.  I asked why it was on the menu if I wasn't allowed to order it, and the Eat24 rep told me it was an issue with the app (not the restaurant's fault).  Fair enough; I told them I didn't need the wings, and they could remove them from my order.

An hour later (105 minutes after I placed the order), the food arrived.  I was so eager to dig in at that point, I didn't check if the delivery was complete and accurate.  It wasn't.  The salad I ordered was missing, and the pizza had only one of the two toppings I ordered.  Although they did include the wings without any apparent price adjustment.  The rest of the food was largely underwhelming and bland.  Except for the meat plate, which was excellent.

I realize it was Christmas eve, but it would be nice if the order had been right.  With so many restaurant options available in Vegas, it seems unlikely I will be returning to (or recommending) Cafe Derbi.",MsUOwVSand3qUssodopTow,2,0,2,dqGR7HE6M-iaMcxIftQNZg

While we searched nearby pizzerias, Cafe Derbi came up. We ordered a small pepperoni pizza with a slice of a new york cheesecake. The delivery man came 45 minutes late and nearly hit me with his smoke infested Mercedes. We took the food inside, and tried to manage to finish the pizza that you would honestly find better at pizza hut. As we dove into the cheesecake, all I could of think of was how it tasted like a flan from Cafe Rio on cardboard or a slice of cake.

I remember going there about 2-3 years ago, before I became vegetarian, and the food was almost as good as back in Romania, had a dish with some cheese wrapped in pork with French Fries...was absolutely fantastic ! And tonight I was actually pleased to see its still on the menu, so I had to recommended it to my friends for their next visit.
Tonight was just a night for wine and crepes, something that will always make me come back.
As much as I would like to give this place 5 stars, I just can't ! And it's not because the waitress/bartender wasn't as fast as we would have liked to, but because of the smoke...
I'm sure that if I would be a smoker this wouldn't bother me...but the thing is that I don't smoke and I hate the cigarette smoke...and here people would eat and drink while smoking, no regards towards other guests ...
I'm grateful for the nice weather and their nice size terrace for allowing me and my friends to enjoy the evening outside, almost smoke free!",Ovmw7wC78-PD8BUDS3xM5Q,2,0,3,CP1WClpNZXd2xmqK7BDkpA

I came here on the recommendation of a cousin who gets suggestions from coworkers. I've been putting it off for a while but decided to give it a shot. First impressions 2 Chinese guys going into a Serbian/Yugoslav place felt weird like the music stopped but we just found a place to sit and I just followed my cousins lead since he has already been here once before. The place is simply decorated with orange walls, orange and black drapes with a wood floor that could be converted to a club with a full bar, DJ'ing area and dance lights. 
I'm not sure of most of the names since they are in Serbian. Our waitress suggested for a appetizer the ""Cheese Pie"" a pastry wrapped around cheese similar to mozzarella. For a salad we split a salad made of tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese. Finally for entrees, I had the Mixed Meat Derbi plate, which was basically a sample plate of the grilled meats available (sausage link, pork chop, pork loin and a beef patty over fries) and my cousin got the Big German Hamburger (a Beef patty stuffed with cheese on a Serb style bun). Both were good but I found the flavor lacking, kinda bland. I guess they don't heavily season their foods. Interesting thing was the hamburger bun, it had a light texture and the flavor was sweet similar to a pancake, hard to pinpoint. 
 My major dislike of the place is the all the smoking going on inside, a true smokers den. I work in a casino and don't get this kind of second hand exposure, leaving the place with stinky clothes. Cough, Cough...",T_RiQ-TOeZf8N2kiCNCiSg,2,1,3,suZFesLkFUD6cALlevKtWA
