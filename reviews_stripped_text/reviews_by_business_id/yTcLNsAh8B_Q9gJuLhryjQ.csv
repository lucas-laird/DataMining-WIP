The chef wouldn't give me the pineapple. The customer service was great however ! dining commons , you are somewhat despicable.",q8N3EPPljO1xTPkXtlNfRw,2,0,2,PYGnlh9r5Thj6GIdWL2bzw

Whenever I'm not really caring about what I eat, I'll be here and hope they are serving decent food. Whenever they don't have anything I like, I usually just either make myself a salad from the salad bar or I just eat cereal. There are also a few very rude staff members.. -_-",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,2,0,2,1r4PQvuqkbEx02zDQcukYg

They have the most minimal choices for food and also the no brand food from cereal, fruits, drinks. Other campus have so much more variety and the many of the good schools usually have name brand cereals! I guess they want you to eat out and explore Vegas food instead of vegetating in the dorms and studying.",-4Crtw49pTqry_JzIcxbXQ,4,0,1,RhwCTnZtwMvDGxB5Ag6k_Q

Over all great selection of food here, salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, donuts and a list of other delish carbs I can't eat.. boo for me..
Coffee, soda, milk, who drinks milk? Might be for the cereal bar.. hummmm
The cat that serves the grilled cheese, chicken breasts and hamburger pattys is always smiling and happy..
This place is pretty big, and it is clean, large selection of food and a pretty decent price. Im pretty sure the dining hall is open until 7 on most nights, but get there early for the best selection..",WPe2n-x6xBNy2GIC5LcpdA,3,2,4,cz6-pP3ETSVVncQSX9BuSA

It is convenient for students who do not have cars to go anywhere. Students who are living on campus are required to get a dining plan. Their prices vary on what type of plan you want. DC is not the best food, but it will get you by if you are hungry. 

For breakfast always have eggs, bacon and sausage. There is even a omelette station and a chef will make your omelette for you. Other items on the menu changes per day. The waffle station is pretty good, you can make your own waffles. They also have cereal and milk from breakfast to dinner. They have a good variety of cereal. Their milk ranges from 2%-soy and even chocolate. 

There are also sofa machines around the room. For lunch the safest choice would be the burgers, fries, grill cheese, salad, and sandwiches. They also have a pasta chef who makes your pasta in front of you. Which is nice. The pizza are a hit or miss. It depends if it is burnt or not. The other items are sometimes pretty good or sometimes pretty bad. It depends. 

For dessert they have cookies, brownies, other items and even a dryers ice cream machine. If I had to pick, the cookies would be my favorite out of the desserts. 

The DC is the DC. It is nice to not worry about a meal until you run out of swipes. Breakfast is the best time to go and get food. It just depends if you want to wake up early for breakfast.",e7o1IGApDU8ZmFfGWOepbA,4,2,3,W2zHynFqPfaaksU8bgCGng

Although they do not have the best variety or choice of food it is still enough to get any student through their semester when they are hungry. They have different dining plans but I think that the lowest block count and cheapest will be enough for someone eating every single day for the entire semester. 

Breakfast: they have your basic variety of cereal and choice of chocolate, soy, or regular 2% milk. The omelet station is open for a certain amount of time and the line could get really long so expect a wait. If you are a vegetarian or only want egg whites with your omelet then the chef does a good job clearing everything for you on his grill to ensure lack of cross contamination. 

Lunch: the salad bar, grill bar, and their pizza bar becomes open. There is an occasional extra bar for other types of food they may have on the menu, for example, they could be making their special fried rice for lunch or the next day they will have some type of pot pie, it varies.

Dinner: this is the exact same concept during lunch time, except all bars are basically active and open. The desert bar is active with chef's constantly putting things on the shelf and next to them they will have more varieties of food like beef stew or tacos, etc.

During all three sessions you are provided with unlimited drinks from a drink bar that are located in three different parts of the dining commons. Everything is a buffet style of eating and if you calculate the price you pay per semester down to how much each meal is it ranges depending on the day from $8-$12 per person. Overtime if you are that student who lives on campus all four years and you resort to eating dining commons food then it will get tiring for you. This place is usually busy during the times when classes gets out, example, the morning class would be 8:30am to 9:45am, expect to see a huge crowd at around 9:45am/10am for breakfast. If you want to take out food then you can but you will have to pay for the to-go box itself, they will not let you pay with your dinning dollars or your pre-paid swipes.",80qYPp6Fk_jmO3334DKGGg,1,3,3,ueNXEQQ64rsqIdtVYnYIcw
5278266,2015-12-05,3,yTcLNsAh8B_Q9gJuLhryjQ,"The dining commons excels in offering an impressive array of desserts, beverages, and salad bar options but could use a boost to its main entree selections. Here's my beef with the DC: there's a sandwich station that boasted a menu with a pesto caprese option. Being that I love caprese (and it was the only vegetarian option), it was the logical choice to go caprese. Come to find out, the ""pesto"" is actually pesto mayo and there is no basil on the sandwich! You simply cannot omit basil from caprese. It's one of the main goddamn ingredients! I made do with lettuce instead, and my sad faux caprese ended being okay for a light lunch snack. 

Besides the salad bar and the sandwich station, there's a pizza and pasta bar and what looked like a Chinese food section. I grabbed some fries that were set up to a hot dog station to finish up my main course. 

Dessert is where it's at! There was brownies, cupcakes, cookies, and a Dryer's ice cream machine complete with chocolate sprinkles waiting to be scooped up. The brownies and ice cream were yummy. Beverages available include a Nestle hot chocolate machine, coffee, soda, juice, and lemon water to name a few. I was super impressed that they had chocolate and vanilla soymilk on standby!

When you're all done eating, there's a conveyor belt where students drop off all their dishes. I'd compare the quality of the food at the dining commons to EDR food or any other cafeteria type place. Most things are just okay, but there are a few standouts. My lunch date got a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and stuffing, and she absolutely loved her food.
