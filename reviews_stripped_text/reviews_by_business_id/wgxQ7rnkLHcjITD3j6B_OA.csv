218810,2013-09-20,1,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"I stayed at the hyatt place across the street from Stir Krazy. Without a doubt their food was amazing. When you prep your dish the employees give you tips on sauces to make sure you enjoy your food. 

Pro: You an pile up as much broccoli, carrots, beef, pork, chicken noodles and other normal ingredients associated with Mongolian meals. So stack it as high as you can;there is no limit! When I came back to the hotel room all the other guests said the food smelled good. And I agreed with them as I ate it in their faces. Shortly after and for the next few days my family and I became regulars of this place during our short time. Unfortunately when I asked the manager if I could get some commission for bringing everyone over to eat.

The prices were good also. I would definitely return! Last but not least its al you can eat if you dine in.

Con: There is not a Stir Krazy in my area.",ESiK6T2Kc_tNPK8qzudIbg,0,0,4,OiuKC6h2MNVfJP0jxjBWxQ

839023,2013-05-15,3,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"I know what you are thinking.. Has Dana gone KRAZY?  What is she doing writing a review about a Mongolian Grill?  Here's the deal - I accompanied a few co-workers to check this place out with the understanding that I would just play the role of delightful company and would not be partaking in any of the dining portion of our excursion.  I was familiar with the whole giant slab of wok concept having seen it first hand at the Green Valley Buffet but this place is something special and you will be shocked at the twist coming up.  
Let me walk you through the process.  When you walk in you immediately see said giant wok thing and it smells really good inside which is always a good indicator.  Then of course you find a seat in the dining room and you are greeted by the kind folk who take your drink order and provide you with a bowl.  So as my friends took their bowls to the bountiful buffet I came along just to see all the excitement.  They had I believe 4-5 proteins to select and a whole bunch of veggies and other things I have no idea what they were.  Well the stars must have aligned and my chi was in the right place because something came over me and I went back and grabbed a bowl!  (This is where the shocking twist starts!)  I began placing items in the bowl.. nothing too crazy just  samples of chicken, beef, ham, pepperoni and some noodles that looked orange.  Then you are supposed to give them your bowl to cook and I was prepared to do so when our server stopped me to advise I must put some sauce on it in order for it not burn and not get stuck (probably common sense for most people but not for this kid.)  At that point I almost lost it and wanted to cry because there was quite the selection of sauces and I was scared it would ruin my bowl.   He was very patient with me and assured me that the sauces would evaporate and all would be well and he was right!  And you wait there for all of like 30 seconds to get your food.. Super-fast.
The cool thing about this place is that if you are unlike me and enjoy most foods, they have little signs above the buffet that give you ""recipes"" for you to create the ultimate bowl of goodness.  Also they have a ton of sauces at are made fresh every day.
So in conclusion I know I am not the most credible to recommend a place like this but they are a new restaurant and are currently running grand opening specials where you get all-you-can-eat dinner for like $13 dollars and lunch is even cheaper (but not all you can eat)!  My friends' bowls were so big that when they put it on the plate, along with the complimentary rice, it was quite a meal.  And think about it, this place got the pickiest eater you know to try something new.. that has to say something!  I want to bring my husband to try it out and so should you.

We like that you have the noodle option before giving the bowl to the cook so they can do their magic.  They add a side of white or brown rice to the plate after everything is cooked up.

You have the option of one bowl ( under $10 ) or AYCE for a few $$ more.

2213515,2013-11-04,0,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"Been looking for a decent stir fry/Mongolian BBQ place in Vegas since I miss Flat Top Grill when I used to live in Illinois, and decided to try out Stir Crazy. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty empty since it was around 3 PM. We were greeted and asked to sit wherever we liked. When placing our drink order, I thought it was a little odd that they didn't serve hot tea any other warm beverages, being an Asian fusion place an all...and they only have soda and iced tea ($2.49 w/ refills). We were handed 2 bowls and we headed off to the buffet area to make our food. For lunch you can choose between $9.99 for a single bowl or $13.99 for AYCE. Dinner is AYCE only.

Since we didn't really plan on getting the AYCE option, we tried cramming as much as we could into our bowls. You can choose from 4 types of meat: pork, beef, chicken or turkey; and then add various veggies, toppings, noodles and sauces. Among the toppings were even diced ham and sausage which tasted surprisingly good with thest rest of my food. They had a pretty large selection of veggies which was great, although there are only a handful of sauce choices. Since I wasn't sure which sauce to get, I went with the house option. They have posters of recommended sauce receipes on the wall that you can try if you'd like.

Once you're done cramming your bowl, you simply bring it up to the cook at the grill and he'll ask you if you want rice. If you opt for rice, you can choose between white or brown rice, and he'll include a scoop of it on your plate alongside your cooked food. Overall, the wait time wasn't too long for our food to be cooked. Maybe 5 min for our 2 bowls.

Although our waiter, Bobby, didn't have to do much but bring us refills and our check, he was really nice and checked up on us to see how our food was. The restaurant isn't really decorated and lacks an inviting feel to it, but the food and staff were great so that didn't really matter in the end.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,3,1,4,elk7kFW6BzJ6hdU8aD_YOQ

2741666,2013-06-01,4,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"So lets cut down to the chase. 

Lunch is 9.99 for a single trip. All you can eat is 13.99. For dinner the all you can eat price is the only option. Kids 10 and under lunch is 5.99 and 8.99 for all you can eat respectively. Dinner starts at 4 pm.

They give you a medium sized bowl to put all your meat, veggies, and sauces in. If you are doing the single trip, cram as much as you can into the bowl so you can get your money's worth. 

You hand it over to the cooks. They will ask you if you want it with steamed or brown rice. I recommend the brown since its healthier for you. Since the meats are frozen but thinly sliced, they don't take long to cook. You can actually stand there and watch them cook it and hand your plate to you after they are done cooking. The only advice to you here is that to make sure they cook it well because undercooked pork, chicken, and turkey can really make you sick.

When you bring it to your table, you have sriracha and sweet chili sauce ready to go in containers just in case you need more spicy or sweet kick to your grilled goodies. Fountain drinks are 2.49 with free refills. I asked for water. Note: Their water is straight tap. Its not filtered.

Service is decent for they really don't have to do much except get you your drinks, refills, and your check. Their location is in an ideal spot for they are right next to The Hard Rock Casino Hotel. 

Overall, I like the fact that the only time you really have to wait is when they cook your food which is a major plus. I recommend you get the all you can eat and definitely have enough time to enjoy it because it is kind of pricey. Its not the best but definitely better than Genghis Grill over in Henderson.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,10,3,3,b7v1TZvvSaNn9-5-lMkFwA

The first time I walked in I was taken back to my youthful days smelling the spices and grilling vegetables. My memories take over and I'm not sure if it's actually the taste or the nostalgia that makes the food taste fantastic.

But regardless, this place is amaze balls. Oscar & Todd are very hospitable when they great their guests. The atmosphere is welcoming and the bar is clean and well maintained. It is just one of the best restaurants of this sort anywhere in Vegas. The meats are slices very thin which allows for more flavor and variety when it comes to filling up.

I can't say enough about this place. I know that a lot of times people are only to ready to trash a place when it comes to bad service.

When I finally found it, I think I had over-hyped the idea of the place a little bit, and while the food actually met my overworked expectations, the service was more than a little disappointing. 

First of all, whenever I walk in to a restaurant, I would like to at least be greeted by somebody - or even a sign saying to please seat yourself. I stood around looking for someone for a good minute or two before one of the guys working the grill informed me that it's self seating. I proceeded to find a table, and then go to the bar to make my first selections. While there was a ton of things to add to my meal, there was nothing to put anything in. Quite confused at this point, I returned to the helpful wok-master, who explained that a waitress would bring me bowls and my drinks. This is the first I had heard of the phantom waitress, so I went back to the table to wait. When she finally arrived, I was able to at long last partake of the wonderful bounty. 

The food was everything I had wanted and more! Ever bite packed with flavor from their assortment of seasoning. The food wiped the lack of attention from my server completely from my mind - that is, of course, until I needed another bowl. I had the same issue getting my check at the end of the meal. I really want to give this place four or even five stars, but the lackluster service really killed the overall experience.",YNtH9vbkgMxFcDaeMh8rew,2,2,4,eBQg-_kmoJ487AZPytkOiA
5148567,2013-06-24,3,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"When I lived in California, I was always able to find Mongolian BBQ in pretty much any mall near my house. However, I was disappointed to find that there weren't any here in Vegas! When I was in California, I was known as the Mongolian BBQ expert to my family and friends because of my flawless meat, veggie, and noodle stacking technique, and also for mastering the art of combining sauces. When I stack my bowl, I stack it high. 

When I learned that Stir Krazy had opened and that it was fairly close to UNLV, I was ecstatic! I was ready to bust out my old bowl stacking skills and devour the deliciousness I had been missing for quite some time now. 

I've gone to Stir Krazy a total of 2 times so far, and had I been giving the rating based off the first visit alone, I wouldn't have given them the four stars I am now. However, the second trip definitely made up for the first. Let me explain why..

The First Trip: On my first trip to Stir Krazy I was excited and ready. Visions of flowing noodles, meat, and veggies filled my mind and made my mouth water. My friends and I walked in, took our bowls and started to fill them up. Halfway through, we happened to find out that they did not have any noodles, because they didn't receive their shipment that day. My friends and I were greatly disappointed since the main reason we were there was for the noodles! We were also kind of upset since we had already filled our bowls and could no longer leave. We still ate our food with rice instead, and since it tasted okay, I decided to come back another day and give Stir Krazy a second chance.

The Second Trip: The second trip to Stir Krazy was great. We were promptly seated and handed our bowls so we could begin our feast. I doubled checked that the noodles were there this time, so I was greatly pleased. I stacked my veggies, meat, and noodles high. Added 3 scoops of the house sauce, 1 scoop of the sweet, 1 scoop of garlic, and 1 scoop of their chili sauce. Besides all that I added a bit of baked sesame seeds and a dash of honey.  Booooy was it tasty. Everything absorbed the sauce and really tasted flavorful. It was after the first bite that I decided to give Stir Krazy my seal of approval.

I highly recommend that you take a chance and visit this restaurant. The food is good, the staff is friendly, and the prices are average for Mongolian BBQ.

 A quick tip that I can pass on is to carry a napkin with you to stack the bowl. Having a napkin allows you to push the meat down to match the bowl's shape, and place as many veggies as you can inside. After, push the veggies down with the napkin so it's an even surface. I usually add the sauces right after adding the meat and veggies, but before adding the noodles. This makes it less messy and you don't run the risk of having your noodles fall over! :)",Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ,3,5,4,vdiPhivB5y_nrzy6oq8s2Q
5187562,2013-10-28,0,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"Been looking for a good Mongolian BBQ for a while. I could eat this healthy food every week but its been hard to find.  Been there about 5 times now and each time was great.

So the only thing to learn is every Mongolian BBQ place does their sauces differently.  Not very different in flavor, but absolutely in strength.  At one restaurant  you don't want more than a single scoop of flavoring, others like Stir Krazy you want about 3 scoops for a full bowl.  You will know if its a bit strong or weak in flavor once you try it.

For me the house souse (*3) + garlic + the spicy hot + sweet sauce (*2) (more of a cooking wine not really sweet)  is great.   After you get it from the cooks, wait a 2 minutes and flip it over on your plate to allow the meat to reabsorb the sauce (letting cooked meat sit after cooking is an important trick in all cooking).  Then dig in - YUM.

Hope they add another location closer to Henderson where I live, so I can go more often.  My body just loves this fresh healthy food.",ZwHtjO9KusrudKu8j-Cm2A,1,0,5,H2Mz0g1d_ipQO56jK7pqow
5314380,2013-10-20,2,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"We came on a Friday night and ordered 2 AYCE for $14 (Used the $10 LivingSocial valued at $20) Each dinner is 13.99. Total 30.25

- Across from Hard Rock Hotel. 
- Our server, Angela, said that bc we didn't print our LivingSocial, They can't accept it. WTF. After realizing that it was far-fetched, I told her you can just take a picture of the coupon. She agreed. Management fail. 
- Aside from the initial confusion, This MBBQ offers great options! They serve more than the basics. Tofu is a huge plus for me, along with baby carrots. But pizza toppings? HAHA. Whatever floats your boat. 
- Chef can provide you with optional white rice with your meal. I saw one of their employees stir-fry their rice! Looked great, but not a option for customers. HAHA. Worth a shot to ask ;). 
- Food quality was still fresh! Great to know esp if you eat during dinner.
- Like most MBBQ restaurants, they did not give us fried wantons and soup.
- Nice interior design.",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,3,2,4,H6iAzagFwoWEWXB6hWULAg

We came here for Mother's Day. We saw it while we were driving and I said why not. We really love Genghis Grill, hate their customer service, but enjoy the concept of Mongolian grill. We walked in and was greeted right away. They told us to find our own seating. We sat down and we got our drinks and bowls. We added all the items we wanted. There was a very limited selection when it came to the veggies. The selection for sauces wasn't that great either. They were very quick at cooking our foods, but that led to more problems.

We sat down and noticed our chicken was undercooked. It was still pink! Same thing happened with our next bowl with some pork. The sauce they tell you to add made  the dish so salty it was borderline unbearable. 

All in all this was my first time, but my last. Never again.",p-dD2rsk8YmymWKXtJcyBw,2,0,2,V1a35TE90JwyKO8JC5fpdQ
5498560,2013-06-04,1,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"Do you want to try your hand at making your own Asian dish but don't want to actually cook or the mess? Stir Krazy is for you!

Soon as you walk in you see the modern decor and the counter with the cooks using a giant hot plate is what I like to call it haha. At stir crazy you can do one trip or get the all you can eat. Since this was my first time and I was super hungry I decided on all you can eat. How stir crazy works is there's the meat station, the veggies station, the sauce station. You can  pick from turkey,chicken,pork, beef. Then from veggies they have greens as well as oranges and pineapple.

First dish I did was turkey loaded with greens and some orange's used the orange chow mein. For sauces I did home,sweet,pineapple and a little soy bean oil. It was the perfect sweetness and I had white rice.

Second dish I did was turkey with all the greens, sausage, pepperoni, orange chow mein and went sweet, spicy. I went easy on the spice since I wasn't sure how I would take it. I think I should have added a little more since it had spice but I would have liked more. I'm glad I didn't do like my friend though and put too much and end up sweating a storm haha!

Tips for making your dishes:
Go easy on the oil. Some people really over do it on the oil.
If you want sweet don't be afraid to add oranges and the pineapple in addition to the sweet and pineapple sauce.
To get the sauce on the meat either put meat then some sauce or when you stack the veggies leave a little hole and when you put the sauce it will sink to the bottom to the bowl.

I give it four stars since it is a unique experience, the food was pretty good, and the service is very friendly!",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,1,1,4,Md2-BPJu26HDVq5nFkhG0w

5922092,2013-08-09,1,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,So I enjoy places like this.  We went here for lunch and although it was slow we were not greeted at the door and pointed in any direction.  We kind of wandered around and checked out the selection for a minute before someone told us we could sit wherever we liked.  It was $9.99 for lunch which I thought was a little steep for a place like this but it was nice with big booths.  I made myself some broccoli chicken with onions and mushrooms and then used the recipe off the wall to make a mongolian sauce for my stir fry.   The weak point of this place is they don't have a lot of sauces.  I've been to some similar places that have a much better sauce selection.  The people were nice and the food was great though.,gijqnKe5syCZj7al4kgxFQ,1,1,4,LLM1v27UXMSQWjHBEtqLUg
5983649,2013-06-07,0,wgxQ7rnkLHcjITD3j6B_OA,"Not the best Mongolian grill I've been to, but definitely one of the best in the valley since we have limited options.

I like that they have recipe ideas posted on the wall to help you out if you have no idea where to start. They have a good sized selection with a few odd items (like pepperoni and italian sausage). I like that they have a few sauce selections and offer recipes for mixing the sauces as well. The staff are friendly and offer help whether it's your first time there or not. 

Although the bowls seem pretty small, I'm always full after one serving with noodles and rice. The food is pretty good, but it always seems a bit dry which I try to compensate by adding more sauce, but that in turn makes it more salty. The food's pretty good and it's a fun experience.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,0,0,3,UUm0lUWHJagHlPxye8dwzw
