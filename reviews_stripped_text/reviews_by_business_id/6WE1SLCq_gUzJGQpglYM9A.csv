994810,2016-05-08,0,6WE1SLCq_gUzJGQpglYM9A,"Furious at the ""service"" given at this Pizza Hut. I ordered a half black olive, half plain cheese pizza online and discovered upon arriving back home that the entire pizza was covered with olives. 
My companion cannot stand olives, so I called and was on hold for almost 3 minutes. Finally, an unpleasant employee answered the phone and I explained the situation. She immediately offered to deliver a new pizza - but once I gave the address (quite literally five minutes away), she informed me that they do not deliver to my address and would not be budged. My pizza would take at least half an hour before it could be picked up. 
In my precious food service job, I was taught to bend over backwards for customers who have been wronged. Pizza Hut failed miserably at doing so.",F3egUvup1QxG_vJqBH-ZAA,3,1,1,0_FVlebU_kWh4ghzZTavWA

Easy cheese, well done, xtra sauce thin perfection! Timed for 20mins or so due to the well done request but the pizzas were fresh & hot. I would go back to this location. Only thing it's take out only people.",KKLWlqtaspsWHYGQLfUl1w,10,6,4,Xlfkr_r3Ia6y61Yi_VZcPA

So I arrive to carry it out at 7:20 hoping it would be done early. It in fact was quite the opposite. I remained seated by the counter until almost 8:20, am hour after I had arrived for ""carry out"". When I complained to the manager she told me that they ran out of crust and a million other excuses for why I wasted essentially an hour plus of my life. To her defense, she did give me my pizza and a 2 liter for free, but there needs to be a serious employee overhaul at this location, since aside from the manager all the other employees seem to have their heads firmly planted between their butt cheeks.",pzxNzfwiFudjDnM9G_YX9Q,0,0,1,Mmcu4cmbVzyww2ntKsozkQ
4600027,2016-12-04,0,6WE1SLCq_gUzJGQpglYM9A,"I ordered a pizza and cheese sticks at 10:15pm and was told it would be delivered by 10:45pm. Called twice between then and 11:30pm because the order still wasn't delivered and was told both times that my order was the next one to be delivered. I ended up having to drive to the location and pick up the order myself and I wasn't given a receipt. After I walked out of the store, my friend in the car saw the two workers making rude remarks. During the second phone call I was told if it wasn't delivered within the next 15 minutes, I would get a credit. I walked into the store at 11:47pm and ended up still being charged. Cold food and rude service.",lvEb9XpYk19isFw0CUQ2IA,2,0,1,6YOWzcrNNSRv_xKhh7CLjA

They must recycle pizza to keep from wasting it.",5BpOyawXDHN1_YKd4i9QbQ,1,0,1,kjk7w4wVDBEXMPlx8aNvNA
