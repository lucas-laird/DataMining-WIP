I think it's crap that there were 6 more rounds which meant a total of 10, but when I asked before I entered, I was told that there was only going to be 3 or 4.
I also thought it was odd that on Saturday (competition nights were Wednesday) I texted ""Kuya Ray"" & asked if I made it to the next round, & was replied with a ""yes,"" then the very next day, I text ""Kuya Ray"" another question regarding the karaoke contest,  but this time he had no idea who I was?

Went to check out the place while I was on my way to get my parked car and noticed the sign that said ""karaoke"" and I just couldn't resist it.  I walked in and the place was nice and dark inside. It has a lounge area off to the left side of the building where you can have parties or what not for big groups of people. The ambience is nice. They have a nice variety of alcohol, considering its a filipino bar (usually they don't have much).  

They have filipino songs, but I didn't really go there for that. It's your typical karaoke joint. You tell the DJ what song you want to sing, he can look it up for you. The binder doesn't have nearly what they have on their computer and wastes paper. So just ask him and he will gladly look for it for you. 

Definitely will come back in the future, with friends... 

The only negative, is that, they had a couple odd singers in there.. which made it funny at first, then got annoying quick.

This was my tip as I checked in: DJ Angel has a voice...make sure you know how to sing too...

It's true, you better know how to sing because this DJ can SING. However, call me bias but my niece who sang the last night we were in Vegas rivaled the DJ's voice. 

Anyhoo! My husband and I don't do karaoke not because we do not drink but because we just never did care for karaoke. However, our family has some talented singers and musicians. And this is what the older crowd chose to do while the younger crowd decided to take on the rides at New York New York.

This place is a filipino owned business (hence, the filipino name). Around this area is what I would call asian city because right across the street there are various asian eats (thailand, japanese, korean) with Kapuso beckoning across the street for anyone to sing after eating. 

I almost missed Kapuso and was about to whip my rental car around the parking lots but my husband pointed out that it was across the street.

I gritted my teeth, smiled nicely and drove into the little parking lot. As I stepped out of the car, the sign blared up brightly at us. My first thought was ""Ugh...a karaoke BAR"" but hey...last night with the family that we may not see again for awhile, so we stepped in. 

Your typical karaoke bar with a dance floor *eyebrow raised*. Our nieces and nephews waved at us from the back. All I could think of is ""I'm hungry..is it just filipino pupus?"" 

Our waiter didn't come right away to where my husband had to grab menus. 

I was not in the mood to eat filipino food but I chose their shanghai lumpia when I was actually craving for...pulehu steak, fries, soybeans, and chicken! But, I settled for the shanghai lumpia because you can't go wrong with that appetizer.

As we listened to everyone sing, we found out that next door was for dancing. As we sat there and was wowed by our nieces and nephews, I noticed that they have a great list of  songs from different genres (filipino to contemporary pop, rock or R&B). Another thing I noticed is that the DJ would deliberately place herself on the lineup list for individuals who were singing. 

IMHO...if there are alot of people coming here to sing, can Kapuso minimize the amount of times that the DJ sings? Yes, granted she is talented but I don't know. It started to seem like she was showboating especially after I noticed she would deliberately sing after anyone who sang really well just to try and ""one up"" on them. I kept thinking that hopefully someone will nominate her to be on ""The Voice""

Anyhow, overall experience was okay. The family time spent there is what upped my rating to four stars.

If you like dimly lit karaoke bars, this is a place for you.

If you want to listen to everyone including the DJ sing, this is the place for you

If you are craving filipino food and want to sing Dahil Say Yo afterwards? This place is for you

If you want to dance the favorite filipino party dances (macarena, ocho ocho, electric slide), then yes, this place is for you!",hxCAVwUajMMdg3sPF5wjsg,8,4,4,XVdrUbu4M935Jf7UttHGcQ

Our group of 23 people ordered trays of food. To cut the story short, they tried to charge us over $900 dollars. When we audited what we ordered it was only $719 including tax. We tried to pay with credit card but the manager said it does not work, we tried 2 different cards still no luck and they insist on us paying cash. All food was pre ordered 2 days before but we still have to wait a loooong time for each item to be served. I'm talking 20 minutes in between each item.

Even post clubbing! When we get tired of dancing the night away, we'll go straight here and sing our hearts out loud! Great and friendly staff here especially Jhayzin! He's the man! Or should I say, SHE's the man! The vibe here is always positive unless there's someone who tries to do a concert there, meaning a person who sings a song after a song. Give everyone a break! Lol

Food is delicioso! I loooove their calamari, squid, and ginataan! 

Whenever I have friends in town, I always bring them here to grub authentic pinoy food or just to drink and lounge.",W5iGpA5vgaWRyt4nY4cYBQ,2,2,5,Ift6J0DjblsTvQS7BgwUtQ

Took the food back and told to her cook "" Larry "" but Rowena came back and told me that Larry is getting mad and we have to pay for the beef bistek and cancel the sinigang na baboy only ; I replied to her that both are tough to eat and both needs to be cancelled we will not pay for it. I told Rowena I'll stalk to your manager and she said no manager available instead I spoke to Larry who's a cook I approached him and told him that the meat was tough to eat and I'm not going to pay for it besides been waiting for 31 minutes and his reply "" I'm the only one who's cooking "" I told him is that how you deal to your customers instead of apologizing, take care of the food right and take care of it but instead he is as arguing to me. Larry is very rude just because his the owner relative will definitely report this to the higher which is The better business bureau cause those meat that Larry serve you know it's not fresh looks like been there for two weeks never will come back to this place and the owner Melinda needs improvement and to take care of this issue and train her staff how to cook the food right. Lastly Rowena is great she handled it well. Not recommending this place",BiROPScpyTmPa523wSeftA,0,0,1,OZRMycQp9APQ4sFrSklitw

The singing ruined my appetite since it was mostly the employee singing the whole time. The setting for the place did not really fit the theme since it had laser lights, top 40s music, some paintings that look like were bought from a swapmeet and unorganized seating areas. The price for food was way overpriced! I knew we should have went across the street and gotten something better at a reasonable price..",A4aPuW3i24KnFK9wcH9lag,4,1,2,YG6G3SMHxO0Cqe1Y1beLqg

The prices were excessive for such small portions. Customer service was lacking. The server only came to take orders and drop off food. However, I saw her visit certain tables several times. There was absolutely no regulation- another customer was smoking inside the bathroom and tossed his bud on the floor right next to my table. Honestly, you're better off at Cafe Moda.

5917485,2015-02-13,1,nebRKfau_9iTxRDR6WGj9A,"Karaoke calamity, this little hole in the wall has its purpose but I'm not sure what it is. They will run themselves out of business if they don't start treating newcomers better. They cater to friends and family. I even tipped the DJ Adobo well and he still sent his buddies ahead of me in the karaoke list. The sleazy tattooed oversized Filipina tending bar was curt, unaware, inattentive, and preferred to text on her phone to actually working. When the older middle aged ladies work, it's a better place. The young man with the fake diamond earring and the big painted lady behind the bar run the place with DJ Adobo, it's a joke. The restrooms are filthy and you may need antibiotics after using them. Everything is over priced. Eat elsewhere and have drinks before you get there. Don't bother tipping the DJ because he's going to ignore you anyway. I hope Bar Rescue hits this place. I wanna see Taffer go head-to-head with SheRa, Queen of the dive bars. Wait for the nice older ladies who run and own the place. It's a good place to feel unwanted.

Update: I haven't seen the mean bartender lady the last couple of times I was there. The lady running the karaoke was great! Such a difference, this place is much more welcoming.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,0,3,ztGxrxAgOO25LA8PpCNi3g
