Of course I didn't buy anything in here but really like going in there to use their bathroom because it's like negative McMoney for the big McCorporationBucks.com.  They have a shitty parking lot, people reading racing papers in the back, and a depressed Korean woman eating a chicken sandwich in the front.  There's a big old Golden Arches out there with lights all over it, like just regular light bulb lights.  The sign says ""new building coming soon"" and there are shitty renderings of a new fancy Dallas-style McD's with vegas lights all over it.  I can certainly wait for the new sign and building because I like the old one.  I went in here when I was buzzing on a Full Throttle slurpee which I highly recommend.",W8iFWrbuYUs_UZ1aVLDkUQ,2,1,3,J5jHLicCWuPWgo-xAfYX4Q

The sausage egg McMuffin tastes like heaven when you are a bit drunk still, driving down and around the strip. At the OJ and water.....pure re-hydrating goodness!!! The take ATM/Credit at the drive thru and are speedy and attentive when taking your order.

Oh BTW...the friend I was looking for...he was still in our hotel at the same craps table I left him at!!!!! I actually left the hotel cause I didn't think he would still be down there!! Gotta love Vegas!!",xRKjRsAq5KROElO2qVtXPg,3,1,5,B6pHSZuZlHAB9hA11Cncqg
2228917,2007-05-07,2,vvc7L68Mu3Fa4OnZ8rviFA,"remember when i said I never eat at mcdonald's?  I think I did.  I vaguely remember a fried chicken sandwich sometime around 4am.  i think i might have slept in it, which wouldn't have been too bad, since i think it was soggy anyway.  drunk, vegas, and vacation are my excuses and i'm sticking to em",yUPA1sL2HgMTT2aq4O3ENw,0,0,1,tcdjUyMocqHBrM1a6IPliw
2323185,2018-04-22,0,vvc7L68Mu3Fa4OnZ8rviFA,"Employees are very bad. I asked to go in the restroom and the doors require a code for entry. The McDonald's employee was such an asshole after I asked for the restroom code. So I told him ""you know what it's fine I'll hold it""
He didn't appear to care. They also forgot to complete my order and I had to go back to complete my order. What do you expect from low tier workers.",NgMbFboqL3j2wC1v6YRbUg,0,0,1,LSEQOnp1xXWCojnkutovsQ

The line was long and ill-managed. Only one register was open despite the 30 or so people in line.

Most of my companions got their soda right away. One person ordered a coffee, which took 20 minutes to receive.",Hmjo4sLUIHpuBs5aenOT7w,1,0,1,RkfIqiAQTqZNMNMkcwvgBQ
2891314,2014-03-28,0,vvc7L68Mu3Fa4OnZ8rviFA,Worst service in the world. Good store and location but really poor management skills from the manager to the other 300 training managers running around asking when can I get a promoted? The help is busy sticking stickers on each others butt's. You have to be kidding me.....,qxMpivZxjSVMV633w5elHQ,0,0,1,1FqvrC6rX6rVf9btEwZg9g

Or, I don't know,  how hard is it to work the drive thru window and pretend to know what your doing!! Ugh",06jqtwcRGEyBxhJEgOLWjw,0,0,1,BQjryov5wB_MsCbYC2zA6w
3660047,2011-07-22,0,vvc7L68Mu3Fa4OnZ8rviFA,This Mcdonalds is not only in the business of making crappy food and providing even crappier service watch out for the racket they have in the parking lot . If your not careful reading the sign at the the front of the entrance it is going to cost you $195.00 in parking fees. went in to to ask the management they just blew me off. lucky they are in vegas where they dont count on repeat businesssss.,U1DHIKY3eQWt-OqT7pO_eg,3,0,1,pRmTlWbJU-Hyghir6PMgPQ

It's the last McDonald's I ever ate at. The year was 2004 and in the dark of night, in the cool spring air, my friends and I stumbled out of a casino, drunk from free beer and poor from expensive gambling. It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything. The last man was not so far gone but was the dirtiest of them all. Once our burgers were consumed, we headed out. I was glad to leave... only sleep lay before me now.",7NqIr1o_3ri5YpACRH_Mug,0,4,1,AEi1DBXJfsHllpkRFarS5w
