I tried the sliders, which to be quite honest had slightly dry buns and the burger meat tasted unimpressive. I wouldn't order it again, personally. On the up-side, the sweet potato fries were again excellent, and stayed remarkably crisp and delicious even as they cooled.

Just like my last review: The staff were super friendly and cool people, the restaurant was clean and comfortable and looked great. We're absolutely coming back, even just for the patty melt.",naWOT0hrWBoWt_Xx2CmzhA,2,0,5,-nyM99ESLZzli534R_zEMw

169560,2011-03-22,0,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"Pretty delicious!

We went here on a Friday night a few weeks ago and it was a nice experience.  Decor is nice and subdued - very warm and inviting.  Not your typical video poker bar with restaurant added as an afterthought at all.  Hubby got a ribeye, son got shrimp scampi and feeling a little under the weather, I got a veggie omlette (I forgot the official name of it on the menu) and hot tea.

I loved how they brought out a huge selection organic tea for me to choose from with a big teapot full of perfectly hot (and delicious - not from tap) water.

Hubby and son were extremely pleased with their entrees - I think I made a slight mistake ordering breakfast at night though - the eggs were on the rubbery side but the ingredients and cheese on the inside were definitely on point and the delicious potatoes with the omlette were amazing.  I think it just sat out a little too long while waiting for the other entrees to finish.  

It actually took awhile for me to order - lots of delicious (and healthy / organic) items to choose from.  It will be so nice to bring our vegetarian daughter back and have options for her to choose from besides salad.

The server was very friendly and was nice enough to place my husbands grilled asparagus on the side just because I mentioned that it sounded delicious when he declined it so I could feast on it !  I loved how grilled asparagus was a side instead of the normal frozen vegetable medly that normally gets served at restaurants like this.  I believe I may have had the server mentioned below - I am glad I did not read that review first because she was very pleasant, accomodating and prompt without being overbearing - a nice balance.  I would much rather have friendly and slower than fast and grouchy.

We are definitely coming back - some of the pizzas that were coming out of their wood pizza oven looked heavenly.  Next time though I will save my veggie omlette ordering for breakfast time...",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,1,0,4,gLrIvlWq9GQJk7o0WfdkBQ

Staff is awesome, everyone remembers my name as well as my favorite order and i feel at home every time I'm here. Every sunday morning i go there for the eye opener which is eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast. I also get an order of biscuits and gravy ( which are some of the best in town ) every thing is always seasoned beautifully and the prices are extremely affordable! For lunch or dinner i love their burgers they come on a magnificent brioche bun, and the appetizers are to die for. Some of my favorite apps are the tex mex spring rolls - just a little spicy, very good. I also like the pretzel bites which are exactly what you would expect with some queso cheese on the side. In all this is not ordinary bar food by far they have so many other things i have to order but I'm stuck on my regular favorites i haven't had the chance to order them yet! 
This really is a place you must try and i put my reputation on the fact you will love all the food and the staff will welcome you with open arms!

She came back with 5 waters and informed us that they were out Tortilla chips. Next we ordered another appetizer. The server came back and told us they were out of that too. My sister ordered a drink and they couldn't make it so she got a chocolate milk that wasn't mixed up.  I ordered a glass of red wine and when i said the name, the server looked at me like I had three heads. I had to explain to the server that the restaurant she worked at served a specific brand of wine and that is what I was asking for. Our server kept disappearing for long periods of time even though there was only one other table of two in the entire place. It took her forever to finally come and take our dinner order. Where we were sitting, we had a view to the kitchen line and a few of our dishes clearly sat under heat lamps for a while. My sisters dish was crispy and dry when it shouldn't have been and my mom's was dry on top and soggy on the bottom. Oh, and they must have been rationing water as well because despite asking twice for refills, we never got them. In short, service sucked, food was alright.

872260,2011-08-28,0,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to purchase the Groupon and give this place a try. Big mistake.

We went on last Saturday evening around 5:30 and ordered our drinks and appetizer. The waitress (who looks about 13) came to take our order and when my husband ordered the rib eye steak she informed us they ran out of it. (FYI, it's the ONLY steak on the menu.) We decided to come back the next weekend when they would have the rib eye.

Tonight we went and were happy when they said they had rib eye. My husband ordered the steak and and was given a choice of two sauces to go with it. Of course, they were out of the sauce he chose so he was stuck with the other one. I ordered the chicken fettucini alfredo but was told I was not allowed to order it because we were using a Groupon and it's not considered a ""dinner entree"". Nothing looked too exciting so I settled on the fish and chips. 

Our salads and appetizer (Southwest Egg Rolls) came out and both were tasty. Then came our dinners. At least, I think that's what it was supposed to be. My fish smelled fishy as soon as it was put in front of me.The fries were covered in glistening grease and were overcooked and soggy and when I asked for vinegar was told they ""were out of it"". (Anyone sensing a theme here?) I had exactly one bite of the fish and it tasted awful and I had exactly one fry. I am not a picky person (I mean it!) but that was the first time in my life that I left a meal basically untouched. My husband said his steak was really fatty but liked the veggies and potatoes.

Please don't waste your money here! The young waitress seemed oblivious to the fact that I hadn't eaten my meal because it was disgusting and when an older server came by and asked me if I liked it I told him no that the fish was bad and the fries were soggy.  He took my plate and that was it. No ""I am sorry"" or ""Can we make something else for you?""

1462557,2014-06-07,1,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"I agree with prior reviews.. I haven't a clue as to why this place doesn't seem to have much business.  Maybe location?  Killer menu, great service and an incredibly clean restaurant..  What's the problem?

I ordered the pepperoni pizza, with the loaded (and I mean loaded) nachos and some of their gourmet mexican style corn.  All of it, bravo.  Delicious.  I've been dreaming about the corn ever since.. I've ordered it to-go twice but currently on a mission to make from home.  However, the cotija cheese is not easy to come by.  

Overall, I LOVE this place.  There are so many little bars/gambling saloons that are open 24 hrs.... This place is so much more.   I seriously hope they get more business so that I never have to say goodbye to such an incredible menu.  Location might be playing a part in that.

If you have some late night munchies - go check these guys out!  You won't be disappointed.   They also have an awesome breakfast menu.

The service was super slow and the server was eating food while we waited for ours. The place is also understaffed for its size, but I guess that's ok since it is empty and awful. My daughter's burger bun had green stuff on it and we asked them to replace the bun. They brought it back out and said the cook had some guacamole on his gloves and they didn't replace the bun because they said she'd have to wait too long for them to remake it.The other food we had was actually decent.

The mac and cheese made a cheap Velveeta dinner seem high class. It was bland with a cheese ""sauce"" and I put it in quotes because that is as close as I could come to identifying it. For the burger to offer options on a temperature of your choosing is a joke as it comes as well done as a fast food burger. It had so few onion straws that we didn't believe they were included until we pulled it apart and realized there was a light orange color where the straw batter is assumed to have been though no actual straws were found. Now the real gem, the meat loaf. This is the equivalent of a kid cuisine meal except in a kid cuisine you get a dessert and the corn doesn't suck. They also flat out forgot the salad that is listed on the website as included with the meatloaf though they charged us a $1.50 for as if we added it and then didn't even include it in our bag.

2029927,2014-08-24,0,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"With two friends in town and many local friends off from work, we sought Saturday brunch. The trouble was I worked  til noon and most brunches end by 1pm.

Enter The Brentwood Cafe and Tavern, which serves breakfast 24 hours a day, is just around the corner for all the locals, and - to my delight - offers gluten-free pancakes or waffles upon request. 

We all agreed to meet around 1pm, which gave me enough time to go home, change, and drive over. Parking in their lot is very easy - plus points! 

When we walked in, we were seated quickly which, for weekend brunch, is a miracle - plus more points! 

I quickly scanned the menu and, to my sadness, realized that only a portion of the breakfast menu was offered 24 hours a day. The pancakes/waffles/french toast and scrambles/skillets are actually only offered 11pm-11am. That was all relieved when we were told they would be able to accommodate requests from the 11p/11a menu - super plus points (thank you so much for this)! 

Some of the group ordered bottomless mimosas which, at $15 served in large glasses and refilled quickly, is quite the deal. Others ordered coffee that smelled heavenly. Others still ordered micheladas. 

Each person ordered something different which, for me, meant getting to sample a little bit of a lot of things. 

We had:

- Nutella Waffle

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ

This I think would translate better aspancakes or french toast, but it was well done 

- Junkyard Skillet

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#ghuaYb6VN8fyjfx5n9YGLw

Massive and glorious. It was far larger in portion than expected. It was wonderfully cheesy, eggy, and meaty all at once and left more than enough for leftovers later. 

- Brentwood Ranchero 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#rKQwZfeOnz9nBHUKEbGTMA

We considered this a perfect hybrid between a huevos ranchero and chilaquiles - like crispy, cheesy, breakfast nachos. With the beautifully over easy egg, avocados, and cheese sauce, it was very well received. 

- Bomb-Diggity Nachos

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#UmiSoiQbj_-HqeUZdJslCA

The person that ordered this question the level of ""loadedness"" and was ecstatic to find a mini sheet tray covered with meat covered cheesy chips before her. Definitely delicious!

- Brentwood Burger

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#B3Np1BqE8JisK02sK2pLYQ

My husband at this too quickly for me to really assess it, but he ate the whole thing. Onion rings were on point. So there. 

- GLUTEN-FREE Banana Pecan Waffle

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#Pb8wBGAM7OIYMnUuHNx6Ag

Gluten-free waffle or pancakes upon request caught my eye, especially because it didn't incur an additional $4 fee or whatever can be charged elsewhere. Having tried gluten-free pancakes, I went for the waffle and - OHMYGOSH. The waffle was so fluffy I would argue it was better than the regular waffle (see nutella waffle from this trip). It was so good that it was just a ""good waffle"" versus being a ""good for being gluten-free waffle"". My stomach lining thanks you, Brentwood... I must return for blueberry, nutella, and root beer.. 

- All-Star Root Beer Float PANCAKES

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#iDxRnwyTsQAth_wIiNzS8Q

Yes, PANCAKES. Okay, so I know I made a big to-do about needing gluten-free options, but I did break my avoidance to catch a taste of these pancakes out of sheer curiosity. They are literally a root beer float in pancake form and I need to try these soon without the gluten. 

- Hangover Breakfast

The description on the menu reads like this:

red beer or loaded absolut bloody mary with a breakfast slider with sausage, bacon, fried egg & cheese

I honestly planned on getting the protein scramble but I felt this had to be tried. Therefore, I changed my selection to this just before our orders were taken. 

My expectation: a slider on a plate with a bloody mary to drink 

What I got was this, which explains why I was told my drink was coming with the food: 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-brentwood-cafe-and-tavern-las-vegas?select=D4KL_j2txk5O5jzsCEtPtQ#BAkvEgQIDpnyxuNfJiJpCw

This was a true OMGWTFWOW moment. Not only was it an awesome monstrosity, the bloody mary and slider were both excellent. The drink hit all the right flavor notes and the sandwich was fluffy, buttery, melty, and meaty. 

We were all so pleased with our visit and had a great afternoon together.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,4,0,4,G3c9JDv1awa0ZqLecD49hA
2033312,2015-01-21,1,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"It's a-ok. It's a fairly standard 24-hr, neighborhood bar and restaurant. Though, the lights are almost bright here and the restaurant area is pretty ample. The barstools are in need of serious repair. 

The food is alright. Standard, insignificant, run-of-the-mill fare (or at least for what we've tried so far). It's all edible and will hit the spot. But none of it is crave-worthy. Though, I will say that the full-size burgers are probably substantially better than the slider versions. I'd definitely be willing to come back and try a full burger.

The bartender we had was friendly and attentive. Beer offerings are pretty standard. They have $15 bottomless mimosas on the weekends. 

They also do karaoke here. It's not too bad. Though, the space is a bit awkward for it. I do, however, like that I can sit at the bar and have a great view of the karaoke proceedings. 

Note: If using that Groupon you purchased, despite it being for $20 towards food and drinks for 2, and clearly not stating must purchase 2 entrees, they will try to force you to order 2 entrees.

All in all, an a-ok, average place. I'd be willing to give it another try. If I lived in the neighborhood, I could see myself stopping in frequently for a beer.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,3,2,3,KCnR77IN2ptsgV0StVgMFg

I believe because of the negligence that this restaurant should be responisble for the vet bills.  this all could have happened to a child or and adult who may be allergic to onions  that could also cost  my dog his life.

2660935,2012-05-31,0,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"Disclaimer:  I've only been here for lunch.

My company recently moved to this side of town and Brentwood was really courting our business, so we thought we would try it.

I've been twice and other coworkers have tried it a few times.  I've got to say I have yet to speak to anyone who had a positive experience.  The first time we had a decent waitress and everything was average.  The second time was ridiculously bad.  There were only 2 of us and we both ordered burgers - after waiting 45 minutes(!!) we finally received our burgers.  Both orders were wrong in more than one way.  Its hard to believe the kitchen could make 4+ mistakes on 2 plates when there was only 1 other table of people there - its not like they were slammed.  The other thing that bugged me - they clearly just took my plate back and scraped off what I didn't want and left remnents of it all over the plate.  I HATE that.  Don't be so damn lazy - give me a NEW plate.  At least try to hide the fact that you probably just scraped it off with a fork and hid the evidence with a new slice of cheese.

Their menu is limited but the food would be decent if they actually got it right, or cared what you actually ordered.

This might be fine for dinner when you have plenty of time to wait but for lunch its just not worth it for me. 


Tip to Brentwood:  When people show up at 12:10 with ID badges hanging from their clothes, they're on their lunch break.  They don't have time to wait 45 minutes for a burger when they have to be back to work in an hour.",4krT9JxgkdxLKo7slwOKkA,1,0,2,52k0OvrvtQvf-UNuUUNL1A

My husband and I ordered the same sandwiches, yet I requested the turkey as the protein, and he chose the chicken. The kitchen made the order incorrectly and also put mushrooms on his sandwich when he requested it to be omitted and mine was missing the mushrooms. This type of problem bothers me because the kitchen cant make the food order correct and then it gets brought out without being checked. I decided to eat my sandwich, sans the missing mushrooms, while my hubby's sandwich got sent back. In the end, we had to take his sandwich to go because he ran out of time for his lunch break. Very frustrating. Then my husband calls me from work saying that he found a huge chicken bone in his sandwich while biting into it. Felt bad for him cause he was very hungry and had to take his sandwich all the way to work and ended up finding a bone in it.

We got there and I was delightfully surprised to discover that they're currenlty retooling the restaurant and bar to accomodate fans of the Texas Longhorns.  Unfortunately, during this retooling session, the bar was a little sloppy.

The menu was very small, they were limited on drinks and they were streaming the Longhorns game on a slow connection, so it kept freezing up to buffer.

I'll be honest, the only reason I'm giving this place four stars is because despite the remodeoling faults, my food was delicious and I can't wait to see what this place is like when they're settled and everything runs smoothly.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,1,2,4,mmB6Z-uShN0Ceiamendi0w

My friend and I ordered the Brentwood Burger, Nachos, and a Quesadilla. Everything was made to perfection! The food was more than satisfying and the service was great. Every time.

We sat in a booth in the bar area. The waiter/bartender Jessie was an outgoing guy and very attentive. He suggested a few drinks and normally I'm not a fan of Gin, but he definitely sold me on it.

For breakfast today we tried:
~Chocolate Chip pancake for our kiddo
~Poached Egg Eye opener, hash browns, sausage patties with extra side of fruit and rye
~Eye Opener over medium, bacon with sourdough and, of course, had to go for their Bottomless Mimosas on Sat & Sun morning for $15. Our food was a solid breakfast; eggs poached nicely, over medium done right, a HUGE kid's plate of chocolate chip cakes that we all shared. Bacon was cooked crisp enough, the kiddo LOVED the sausage patties, the hash browns needed more browning, but that was a first. Toasts were great -rye especially. The fruit this a.m. was a cup of strawberries, a nice fresh little treat.

No one greeted us when we walked in; after a few minutes, someone who appeared to be a cook came out and showed us to our seats. He also got us our drinks. The server took a while to turn up- she was the only server, and had a few other tables, so we just figured she was busy. It turned out that she was just really inattentive. After we finally placed our order, it took about twenty minutes for our food to arrive. The server dropped the food off, and took off without asking if we needed anything else, or offering any condiments. I was irked because I wanted some ketchup or mayo for my fries, so I decided to start with my sandwich and wait til she came back to check on us to ask for it. It took her a really long time to check back, though, because a group came in that appeared to be regulars, and she was busy chatting with them. By the time she did come back, my husband had finished his iced tea, so we asked for a refill and a side of mayo. She said she'd be right back with them, but we never got those items. Meanwhile, the table of regulars got their food very quickly, and had a table laden with condiments. It was incredibly irritating. The server came by with our check, never even mentioning the side of mayo or the refill. She offered a box, which I said yes to. I'm not sure why she bothered, because I never got my box, either. When she came to collect her money from us, we were wrapping my sandwich in a napkin. We got no apology, nor did she offer the box again. We left pretty pissed off, especially because we'd tipped fairly well. It seems that you only get good service here if you are a regular- which is a stupid way to operate, because how can you build new regulars if you treat people badly on their first visit? The food was great, so I'd order take out from this joint, but never again will we go in and sit down.",SoAs3jRvZb_cLQ5FNlg8iA,0,0,2,ysMJZ_VrQBnoYVO2Tmi4wQ

While the wait was a bit long after we ordered, but it was very much worth the wait.

The ranchero breakfast was also very good, but I like the pancakes much better.

So now they have no gambling machines. The bar has empty spots now, that's weird. I've never seen someone do away with gambling. They have a separate non-smoking room, which I'm assuming is for families.

I overheard some lady order a bloody mary. She took a sip and refused to drink it. From what I overheard, it was just tomato juice seasoning and vodka. Yuck. She said she stopped by just for a drink but decided to order food. She had the bartender box the food up before it even came out. 

We were there on a Saturday morn at about 10. There was another couple that walked in right after us. Their food came out first, but it was actually ours. We noticed the mistake before the server even did. We already waited 20 minutes for a burger and omelette, so we weren't going to wait any longer. We put 3 bucks down for the drink and just left.

My girlfriend had a groupon too, but we just walked out. She's going to seek a refund for the groupon. I can't see them being in business much longer. The bartender had three customers when we were there, and she messed up all of their orders. She even had a double play when giving our food to the ONLY other customer in the establishment. I don't know why you would go to this place. My idea was that all the breakfast spots would be packed in the a.m., this way we could get breakfast pretty quick. That was my mistake.

The screens are way too small to see any detail. The music (though different than your typical place) was pretty depressing and weird. Think all the forgotten rockabilly artists. One screen was cool though. It made all the soccer players blue. It was a neat game of smurf on smurf.

This place has since closed its restaurant down and only has the bar open, bye bye to the best spinach artichoke dip - *sad face*

I LOVE this place! It's so close to us. The appetizers are the way to go as far as the food - spinach artichoke dip with chips (or bread is okay too) and the chicken wings are amazing! The Alfredo with Fettuccine and chicken is oily and cheesy and delicious as well. And a nod to the Margarita pizza. Casey is the best waiter, super nice and efficient. I really like that you can take your dogs here and eat on the patio. The first times we went here (closer to their opening) they brought out a couple doggy biscuits for the pug. Around Halloween they had a costume contest for dogs and Binkey won! Great appetizers and drinks and a good atmosphere even when it's quiet.",bMb7Y6eFhoQM0EfbrtfoHQ,1,3,3,aZ1okio-UvFgpBTQHZQxnA

3967448,2016-08-21,0,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"First visit here today, and I was not impressed.  As soon as I stepped out of my car, I noticed a strong sewage odor.  No big deal, as it's Vegas and that happens often.  As I walked in, I noticed the smell was also inside the building, and just as strong. 

We went into the restaurant side, which was completely dead at 1pm.  There is a  sign that tells you to sit anywhere (no hostess).  The bartender brought us menus and took our drink order.  When she brought the drinks back, one was overflowing and spilled over onto her, then on both mine and my husband's feet (which were under the table), and finally over the table. No apologies and no offer to clean it up...and no napkins in sight.  She was nice though, so I didn't complain. 

Next, our waiter, who I'm pretty sure was also the cook, took our order. The food took about 20-25 minutes to get to us, and no one came to check on us for drink refills  during that time.  Food arrives, and my pizza was missing an ingredient.  I asked if it was on the pizza, and I was told no because most people would ask for it if they wanted it.  Keep in mind, this ingredient is specifically listed as a part of the pizza on the menu.  He went back to the kitchen to bring me the missing ingredient without huffing and refilled my husband's drink, so again, I didn't complain.

That was the only interaction we had while there, in a completely dead restaurant with only two other people in it.  I watched a waitress with short curly hair walk away from the other table as the customer called out to her to take her menu. The waitress didn't even turn around.  As the customer sat it back on the table, the waitress hollered something over her shoulder, again without turning around.  I couldn't understand exactly what she said, but she still did not pick the menu up. 

As I was waiting, I had time to look around.  I noticed a thick layer of dust on top of the wooden separators between booths and took a pic to post here.  With a lack of customers, I imagine there is enough time to at least clean up the restaurant. 

When we finally saw the cook/waiter again, we asked for the check and I paid without even looking at it so we didn't have to wait any longer to leave. I absolutely did not want to leave a tip, but left $3.00 on a $40 bill (overpriced based on food quality, service, and setting) only out of pity for the poor guy pulling double duty in a non-crowded tavern.

You get the picture.  

Proportions are also key.  Too much of any one or two ingredients and it's a bit like a great looking girl with one huge hairy toe...nothing gets noticed except the toe.  

The Bloody Mary's at the Brentwood Café are so bad that they are literally closer to a marinade for tough, low quality steak than a drink.  As best as I could tell it was 77% cheap steak sauce, then bad tomato juice...undrinkable.  

To top it off the place was woefully understaffed, so getting the check to leave our table full of untouched Bloody Mary's took uncomfortable minutes, and the waitress didn't even question as to if we liked the drinks.",pzcsv281pQBVNYqLi4q6xw,1,0,1,4EBV4CjEHgnpw5DW5JlBqg

I upgraded to tenaya potatoes which made it a whopping $3.29.  

It was delicious.  Sausage was excellent.  Eggs cooked to perfection.  Potatoes flavorful.

4287083,2010-08-19,4,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"This place is is tucked away in a tiny little strip mall off of Warm Springs near Tenaya. The strip mall is almost vacant, save one other place (a Korean restaurant?). The area is still underdeveloped and so Brentwood doesn't get very much traffic. I think since it's so slow, they're only open til 2a. Kinda lame, but I see why. I'm sure if business picks up (and the area develops), they'll extend their hours, but I think that's a long way off. 

This isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you go on a week day, it's pretty uncrowded. They've only been open a couple of months so no one really knows about it. It's a place to go and talk with your company; not shout over ambient ruckus. It's a place to go and chillax; not people watch. 

The bar can be completely closed off from the restaurant side (in accordance with Las Vegas restaurant and smoking laws ... hooray). 

The women's bathroom stalls are shallow. Shallow like, walk in the stall and konk, hit your knee on the toilet. And there are no toilet seat liners in the last stall, but not the first two stalls (my friend is a germaphobe). 

The deco of the place is weird. It's definitely desert practical, but still has this weird austerity. 

When you first walk in the foyer, you can go one of three ways: the bar, the restaurant, the bathroom. It's kind of like entering a business office building. 

The bar side has a huge bar with video poker and also tables surrounding the bar, mostly 4-tops and half booths. 

Of the three evenings I've been there, I've never seen anyone on the restaurant side. 

There's also a dog-friendly patio outside. Neat. Totally trying to accomodate people that just want to have a cold one with their dog. I get it. 

Their menu is typical bar fare. I've only ever tried their spinach dip, $8. Nothing bad, nothing exceptional. Oh, the menu has no desserts. Booooooo. And hiss. BUT my accommodating bartender said there was some ice cream in the kitchen and he could whip something up for me. Hm. Ice cream and Bailey's? Perhaps next time. 

They have Kona Longboard on tap and ... some other stuff. 

I think the major selling point about Brentwood is their friendly staff. Granted, they're new and still have a while to go before they're all jaded and broken, but for now they are swell. I've had the privilege of being served by Huckleberry and Dustin. Huckleberry is a friendly bartender. Friendly to the point where he was whoring out shots. Look for the guy with the Moe (from the Simpsons) tattoo. Dustin was more low key and I found myself missing Huckleberry. But then as the bar emptied, Dustin warmed up a little more and really took the time and care to get us hammered. Such a sweetheart. We also met the two bartenders that just finished their shift, Jen and Lisa, with the nice boobies. Friendly.

You can get the ahi tuna as a salad or as a burger and both are huge portions. It is a generous filet of perfectly seared ahi tuna, tender in the middle and covered on the outside with sesame seeds. 

The tuna burger is topped with a little wasabi and some delicious Asian slaw, served on a potato bun. It comes with your choice of side, fries, onion rings, slaw, side salad etc. 

My fiancé was visiting recently from Australia, and we stopped at Brentwood a few times to have some drinks w friends. One of the nights we both ordered the ahi burger and he had been talking about it ever since. We were going to grab a bite to eat last week before going to meet my parents, and I asked him what he wanted. He said immediately that he had to have that sesame ahi from Brentwood. Really? You've been to Vegas twice and out of all the places to eat, you want to go to Brentwood? It must be pretty good!!!! 

So... This is my third time ordering the sesame ahi tuna and I was compelled to tell all the Yelpers about it. Yum! 

This place is also very big and the staff is super friendly. Tamara the bartender is super sweet and is always nice and bubbly, and waited on us today. 

They also recently upgraded the bar stools and TVs in the bar area. The TVs are are bigger and high definition, and there is a huge one on one of the bar walls that is perfect for football. They also have super fun karaoke on Saturday nights. Plus there is a separate huge nonsmoking dining lounge that is kid friendly.

Lets start off with saying that the breakfast menu leaves much to be desired as listed on the menu. VERY small and poor selection. Even then, don't be fooled by what they have to offer.
My boyfriend ordered steak and eggs. The waitress told him they were out of steak because they sold them all the night before.....okayyy. So then he ordered a waffle. She then proceeded to tell him that they don't have waffles either because the waffle iron had been BROKEN FOR A YEAR!!!!!! He then asked her what they did have so he know what to order, so she said they were also out of steak, pork chops, fruit and a few other items. Another sign that we should have left, but we didn't. 

Okay...so we both ordered french toast (as it seemed that's the only thing they had) and the BF asked to add the pecans on the french toast. LOW AND BEHOLD she comes back and said they didn't have any pecans, but they had walnuts.

A few onion rings for a crunchy,  decadent touch were a perfect addition.  

Today,  for a lighter selection,  the Ahi salad was a great choice. The creamy Wasabi dressing drizzled over the dish was the perfect amount of heat to compliment the perfectly seared tuna. Sesame ginger dressing on the side was a lovely sweet compliment to balance the heat wasabi and richness of the ahi. 

On the beverages, the bloody Mary,  Virgin or full on, is amazing. I joked Wuthering the bartender it's basically a salad ina glass with all the delicious bits of celery and onion in the glass.

Recently under new management, and located slightly adrift of where one's GPS might suggest on West Warm Springs Road, Brentwood Café and Tavern was brought to my attention by a couple sitting next to me the week prior at Old School Brewing Company and featuring a similar 24/7 format with a family friendly dining area separate from the 21 and older bar and gaming area an early morning visit was planned - my 6:55am arrival finding only a young graveyard shift bartender, line cook, and janitorial staff present in the surprisingly large space.

Divided into two sections, the larger dining area not open until 8am thus relegating me to thankfully uninhabited and largely smokeless lounge, it was with friendly service from the barman named Jesse that I was greeted and opting for water over booze a few questions about the menu were answered before a two-course order was crafted, the youngster clearly acknowledging the need to confirm items with a kitchen that still managed to botch one half of the four items chose.

Oddly lit, with red lights overhanging tables and a multi-hued system centered at the bar, it was with a trio of slatted windows open to sunshine that I sat in waiting and although the WiFi was down the combination of SportsCenter and a soundtrack featuring Soudgarden, Nirvana, and Niko Case managed to keep me entertained until savory selections arrived, the fluffy biscuits proving well crafted despite being delivered without any jam or butter while a basket of salty pretzel bites with a pot of creamy queso was admittedly quite good, though certainly not worth $9.49.

Clearly not familiar with the breakfast menu, having to write down the second half of my order and again relay it to the kitchen, it was only after a fairly sizable delay that plates three and four emerged from the back and although the French Toast was the richly saturated sort that I love, crisp over custard beneath sliced bananas and toasty nuts, the ""All Star"" pancakes were anything but what was promised - the flavor entirely devoid of root beer and arriving completely stark despite the menu promising both whip and ice cream, the later only arriving once I pointed out the error, my own 100% maple syrup brought from home added to make the fluffy triple-stack much improved.

Friendly in service and featuring an excellent soundtrack I only wish the food and overall experience at Brentwood Tavern would have been as good,  some of my issues undoubtedly due to the timing of my arrival but others simply due to poor execution with none of it on par with several local competitors in the 24-hour scene.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,3,2,d1WxCcCiWCkp2Re3w4CV0g

The bartender wasn't sure how to make a bloody mary and they didn't have any worcestershire sauce in the whole restaurant, so she used A1.  The drink ended up tasting like a spicy glass of A1.  Despite Happy Hour's offer of 50% off all well drinks I was charged full price @ $8 because they consider a bloody mary to be a specialty cocktail.

My only real big complaint is that the salads, while seemingly original and diverse, aren't as fresh as I think they could be.  Yes, I am talking about the vegetables.  If you're a veggie freak, this may disappoint you, because they really accommodate vegetarians and those with restricted diets better than most restaurants around the area.   Otherwise, I have not had a bad meal here.  They do meat very well and have really good specials.  Service is also pretty spectacular.  

Another warning, if you go here when they have some of their assorted bands playing, and you care about talking to the other diners in your party, you won't be able to hear them at all.  My suggestion - go into the bar.  One night I was there, they featured a Doors cover band, which I found cool but I couldn't carry on a conversation with my husband in the regular restaurant area.  Going into the bar helps this but then you have to deal with all the yucky smokers.

I would choose this place to eat over Born and Raised, which is just up the street.  Less pretentious and hip, better and much cheaper food.  Not to mention, they serve beer out of really cold and large goblets (see attached photo).",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,5,6,4,fMT753Vg4bgjZLWh47_5wQ

It was making that scratchy too loud speaker sound, and making even the decent singers sound lousy. I was waiting for glass to start breaking on some of those notes.

We sat at a table and one of the bartenders came over with menus (sticky menus...huge pet peeve of mine..CLEAN YOUR STUFF) anyway, we ordered two burgers, soda and a beer. The bartender was very nice, but after we put our food order in, we waited, and waited and waited....by the time he brought it, you could tell it had been sitting under the lamp for a while, I think he just forgot about us. 

The burgers tasted ok, nothing to write home about and fairly overpriced for the location and kind of place this is. The fries were luke warm and dried out. Worst part is I was sick to my stomach very shortly after, which for me is always a sign of something I just ate, so something in that food did not agree with me, and considering the lack of clean menus, I shudder to think what it might have been.

Great place to stop in for drinks, a bite to eat, and hanging out...",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,2,0,3,J3OdGEEAEdGpvEf4tTrAsg

Only been to the bar section, however now they have a pet friendly patio. Also it's now opened 24hrs.. I love this place!!",l4Ew7h2owu0MtI3tr2T-1A,0,0,4,XTcCECNmL2hQhuzJSyqVAw
5918834,2015-12-14,3,7IkSGKKiWhfkXQBCT8EOgA,"Maybe the best part or reason for coming here on game days: happy hour specials, aka 50% off, on all appetizers, which on Football Sunday's is essentially all day.

To balance that, for non-smokers, is well, the second hand smoke from all the generous smokers enjoying packs and packs of their cigarettes of choice. Sharing is caring I guess.

The Football Burger Special is what I ended up ordering (1/3 pound burger with side of fries), which is the most popular item to order with my group of friends. For $5.50 it is a decent burger, while you watch in agony or serenity as your team implode or dominate on the field. But even better than this classic burger is their crispy fries.

After watching the second half of this week's afternoon games, we walked out while the sun is still up, but smelling like I personally smoked 3-5 cigarettes. Glad I left my jacket in the car, even though it is brisk 57 F degrees.

Until next time. Maybe.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,3,3,QzyhC7ozUXH-fAJyicP-nw

There was just us & 1 other couple in the entire place. It looked like the place was at its last breath, but the server said they were . Server was nice, but it looked like his friends were there. He gave us 1 set of fork+knife. Sitting somewhere on the other side of this decor separator thing, he kept checking to see if we were almost done. At which point, he screamed:

ARE YOU GUYS HAVING DESSERT??!!?!?

As for the food...wild rice from a box, orange marmalade glaze from a jar, salmon that tasted like it had been freezer-burnt for a while (not a lot of people order the salmon, probably). Bar food. Wasn't absolutely horrible, but food always tastes OK when you're hungry.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,3,2,2,5GCMm89b6tJsu_pZ__jRXQ

The breakfast potatoes had bel peppers in them which was not stated. Unfortunately my boyfriend is deathly allergic to bel peppers we had to send his food back.  Food took long to begin with so wait was extremely long.
When everything finally came out the food was great. I had the veggie sandwich.  Overall customer service was great.",sW5ubhE3aJFcz1r-ecTLUA,1,1,3,QxP3dtdayCUA0aNWt1heDA
