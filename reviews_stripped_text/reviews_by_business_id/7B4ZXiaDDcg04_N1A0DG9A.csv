Roasted Chicken was okay.  They need to give more BBQ sauce with the chicken.  Chicken was dry without sauce.

Ranch chips are tasty.  Too expensive for chips though.

Shrimp & Crab Penne was pretty good.

Pork Chops were tasty, but dry.  The portion was extra large.  Overall I would not choose the pork chops.  Anything dry is terrible.

Hot Wings were good.  Nothing special.

Calamari was good, but the portion was small.

Don't order coffee.  They serve it cold and it taste instant.

Service was below average.  Only thing going for the waitress was that she was wearing corset so you can see cleavage.  Other than that, she was bad.

Notable is the bull riding.  They have a mechanical bull ride that is free.  That is very entertaining to watch.  They need more girls to ride that bull.  Too many guys.

I would come back for happy hour.  Cheaper and good atmosphere.",mgk1pzgEKhZlaG4yntMKRA,1,1,2,_jmgnMokut-lSmezmw72fg

However, the drinks I've had were not good. They just didn't taste good. The food was also lackluster. 

I've never had a problem getting in or trouble at the door. I just think for the drinks and food prices, I'd rather go over to the Blue Martini literally next door during 4-8pm and pay less for better drinks.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,0,0,2,uJvBvh6_ePgwAujq7V_bDg

499171,2011-08-15,1,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"My first visit to Cadillac Ranch Las Vegas location was very disturbing. It revealed a culture of disrespect highlighted by inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. This culture of disrespect seemed to be fully reinforced by management who did not care to listen or address our immediate complaints.  Certainly such behaviors have a negative effect on Cadillac Ranch's profits and reputation, so I thought it worthwhile to address corporate management.

Evidently, our bartender, Rachel (Bar3-t8), was not happy with the 10% tip we provided.  We were $1.50 short of 20% but we were not happy with her poor service.  She was belligerent loudly calling us ""Cheap ass mofos"",  instructing security to ""get them out of here, they don't deserve to finish their drinks"", and proclaiming, ""this is my bar, don't come back.""  We sat their dumb founded that she would treat customers with such disrespect. We quietly left the bar area to seek the manager.

Our group of four never imagined or has ever experienced such disrespect. After spending $25 as entrance fee, $25 for hookah, and $29.23 at the bar,  a total of $79.23, we wanted to let the manager know we felt we paid too much for  the insults. However, to make matters worse, we were informed by an assistant manager, that the manager ""was busy counting money"" so we were to take his business card instead. Evidently, while he had time to count our $79.23, he did not have enough time to tend to our concerns.

As we make our complaints to Yelp, the BBB and the corporate office of Cadillac Ranch we are left wondering what sort of abuse we might have experienced if we left no tip. Are tips required even for unsatisfactory service? 

It also begs the question, ""Is this behavior condoned by corporate management?""  Or, ""Will we get some meaningful action from corporate?"" I know from running my own business and having worked at a Fortune 500 company that substantive changes do not happen overnight, nor did the degradation of customer service at Cadillac Ranch. Typically a signal needs to be sent throughout the organization so that even long after this incident, a line item exists showing a problem occurred and other line items are created to initiate a long-term solution. I suggest a refund of our $79.23 is the needed signal that will also give us reason to try your establishment again.",I6zJxTvZ7UYtda1f3KSp9Q,2,1,1,DltKVDGu8biTB5XAqAIvEQ

Oh, yes, there were the usual choices on the kids menu, but my daughter actually picked the grilled chicken breast, which was a welcome alternative to the usual. I always get the Kettle Chips as an appetizer, and they are really good!  Chips covered in bleu cheese and balsamic vinegar-yumm!  This time I tried the crab cake, and had I not eaten the chips first, I would have licked the plate clean. It was a nice crab cake with lots of crab meat and not too much filler.

Nothing on their menu was stood out, just regular old burgers and salads. We opted for the grilled chicked flatbread, which was actually good.

771817,2010-01-17,0,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"The initial goal was to meet up with a family member that was in town who FLAKED on me.  Looking at the menu before I left I decided to go anyway since the prices weren't too pricey.

The huddle of hostesses were a disgrace.  The place was relatively empty as we went around 4:30-5pm on a Saturday afternoon/evening.  We received our intial ""hello"" but after that we pretty much were non-existent.  The blonde girl was applying her lip gloss with her finger when were standing at the hostess station.  Another employee came in with half-a-glass of water that the brunette hostess stowed behind the podium.  The girl with the glass was also waving her paycheck in the area and very RUDELY squeezed past me and the podium without saying excuse me.  I personally make it a point not to mouth off to the staff before I eat because I enjoy food that hasn't been spat on.

Being successfully irked by the hosting staff, I was pleasantly surprised by the genuine niceness of our server.  She let us know about the specials which weren't bad.  We got the better end of the deal because although it was Saturday the NFL playoff game was going on so our bucket of beer was $5 cheaper.  

Our plates were $7 each which we though were a good deal... until our plates arrived.  They were tiny portions although, they were filling enough for me.  I had the Southwest Taquitos (more like eggrolls...) which were ok.  The pico de gallo had a nice sour taste to it and was well balanced with onions and sprinkles of chopped jalapeno here and there.  My boyfriend got the ""Sherry Ahi Tuna""  I don't know if that was a typo or what, but it was seared and it was served on top of fried wonton squares which were served on top of the Asian salad.  The smell of sesame oil was delightful, and to be honest... I wanted more of what he had.

The mechanical bull was pretty entertaining.  A family and all the kids took turns riding it and it was entertaining to see the chubby kid attempt to get on the bull on 3 separate attempts and ultimately had his brother help him on.... And on top of that the look of apprehension on his face was priceless.  He lasted less than a minute.

All-in-all it was an okay experience.  I will be back, hopefully for the AFC championship (Bolts vs. Colts).",YUNzd4DX-KpCRWyLQ0WmtQ,1,1,3,g0CV0_WMYA9igXBv7oGGEg

    - Drink Beer at the Bar
    - Watch Sports
    - Ride the mechanical Bull
    -  AND Stay away from the food.

The food was not good. I got the Diablo Chicken Pasta. Although the warning messages on the menu about the dangers of eating meat was a pleasant reminder, it did not deter me from it. The Diablo Chicken Pasta tasted bland, mixed with penne pasta, some crushed peppers, and a MAC N Cheese taste. I love Mac N Cheese, but this was no bueno. Especially for 14.95!!! It wasn't spicy and overall it was  just a terrible dish.

Aside from that, the sandwiches also looked mundane. One item I would suggest is the Mushroom Lovers Pizza. That is if you love mushroom and flatbread pizza. 

This is definitely the kind of place where the environment and style undermines the food. The service was good. In fact, it was toooo good. A person would come and check on us every three-five minutes. First the manager, than another waitress, then our waitress. Afterwords, she came again and asked ""how we were."" I don't mind the intrusion, it was just a little too much and annoying. 

Overall...B-

We were told it was open seating, so the hostess suggested we grab our own menus and seat ourselves. We sat for so long without acknowledgement from anyone, that I called the restaurant and complained from the table. Our waitress finally came out, she was frazzled and evidently pretty new, but she was sweet. The food was quite good, the drinks were horrific. At the end when we showed her our still more than half-full drinks, this is what transpired:
She told us it was their policy to charge you for the drink if you drank ANY of it. When we pointed out we had to TASTE the drinks, she got flustered. That's when she apologized and told us she should have tasted them first to make sure they were OK. We stared incredulously, I have never heard of waitresses sampling people's drinks for them, but we smiled politely and asked her to take the drinks off the bill (they were $9 and $12). She told us her manager had to do it and went to go talk to him. When she finally came back, he had only removed one drink, the $9 one. We told her that was unacceptable and to please send him to our table. In the next five minutes, he stormed by our table at least twice but never stopped, he pointedly ignored us. She came back and told us he was in a ""bad mood"" so she removed the $12 drink from the tab anyway. My guess is she gets docked $12 or fired.

Don't give this half-baked operation ANY of your money. The owner of Cadillac Grill should be ashamed to allow it to be run that way.",UVULNkXsR2aEQZNhypwM0w,4,1,1,JBxtFuCri6oUGKGUSOQFag

The drinks were half off which was cool. I ordered a Snake Bite , but the waitress came back and said they were out of pear cider. I settled for a Black & Tan. They brought back a just Black. When questioned about the Black & Tan, the bartender came out and gave us some bull shit excuse. I could've went back there and poured one for myself. After the third attempt...I was just getting irritated.

So I guess we came here on a night when they had a live band playing. I think it was about 20 after we got here, the band started to play and it was loud. It got so effin loud, I couldn't even hear the voices in my head. We decided to leave and continue out party downstairs at Yard House.",RJVpaFHx3MwynTM8TNjz0A,1,0,2,8inUUit67Trbs_znbqHLzA

We ordered a bunch of comfort food, plates of tacos and fixings and there was a platter of fries as well.  We were completely ""carbed up"" after our trip to the movie theater nearby in the mall.  I guess after seeing the movie Red, (it was a bit of an action flick) you get a little hungry.  :)

The server was continually on top of the action and made sure we had everything we needed.

I looks like this place is somewhat of a night spot later in the evening which is totally not my scene but might be worth checking out if you are in the 20 something bracket.

1510430,2010-05-02,4,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"Went here last night for a friend of a friend's birthday party and it wasn't too much of a party to say the least. We were in the VIP section on the patio and got through security pretty quickly upon entering, and the place was super packed. We got a drink up at the bar and went back to the patio. They charge $9 for a teeny tiny rum & coke which is ridiculous but expected in Vegas. But then when my friend's boyfriend went back to the bar again for a second round for my friend, it was $7 and in a plastic albeit bigger glass. WTF? I guess you have to get the right bartender who isn't going to screw you over. 

When I went for my drink (a $10 Rock Candy) I unfortunately had the previous bartender and it was small, and was way too sour, not the way I had remembered the drink. Ick. 

Now the reason we had to go to the bar all the time was because the waitress for the VIP area completely ignored us. She asked everyone else around if they needed anything, but not us.  

I'm giving this an extra star because this is the only place in Las Vegas where karma comes around faster than usual. Literally moments after making fun of some girl's hideous outfit, she falls over in her chair. And that douchebag in True Religion who hit on you at the bar will fall off the bull faster than it took for him to get off of you. 

The crowd was very meh for being so busy. It seemed like every girl there was skanktastic, and every guy was in an embroidered button-down and light-washed jeans with whiskering. Eww. At least we got to see a Snooki lookalike grinding like crazy and a stripper ride the bull. Ahh, Vegas. When there is a mechanical bull, all bets are off. Just make sure you find a bartender who won't stiff you and this place could possibly be alright with the right crowd.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,2,2,2,fK6y2rdMEI4MKmknYfaT8Q

I judge a place based on menu, drink options, but in this case, atmosphere. The vibe is a bit lame, and for a weekend night, it wasn't very full. 

We popped in for a bit as the night began, but promptly moved over to Blue Martini. As the night began to dwindle, we came back to this place, and noticed a massive line outside, but the crowd was lame, inside wasn't full (I can see why), and I didn't really have a good time.

Food/Drinks; Delish. Even better they were half priced. Wings were hot/perfect. Spinach dip was very tasty and chunky. Mozzorella sticks were amazing.

Service; HORRIBLE. The girl gave us attitude, forgot food, brought us our drinks 25 mins later AND messed up our checks 3 TIMES!

Positive Note; Manager gave us two free shots and a 50 dollar gift certificate since it was my birthday

The 2nd time; 
Used the 50 dollar gift certificate on a monday around lunch time, maybe 2 pm.

Food/Drinks;
Got the lunch special which was he perfect size. Husband got the chicken chipotle wrap/bacon&potato soup and he loved it :) I got the pork sandwich/caesar salad which i would have to say was the best tasting one i've ever had. no exaggeration. Next we had drinks. I had a strawberry banana rum margarita. So scrumpcious. Hubby had a martini and a mai ti drink. He liked them. Even asked for the exact alcohol in the martini so we could buy it.

Second because I have been seeking out a fun place to spend my 30th birthday party which is quickly approaching and wanted to give this place a practice run. Cadillac Ranch looks cool and there is a neat looking fire pit outside that I imagined my friends and I clinking drinks around and ringing in my new decade. I went for lunch with my beau and my first experience was that the hostess was fairly unfriendly. To me, a hostess is a huge part of an experience at a restaurant because that is your first impression of a place and I am a customer service snob. We wanted to sit outside and she asked if high tables (bar tables) were okay. Sure! We get outside and it turns out the high tables she referred to were actually in direct sunlight. This is Vegas, and at 1 p.m. in Las Vegas in direct sunlight it is no fun! The question shouldn't have been if we minded high tables, but if we would have minded sitting in the sun, in which case our answer would have been yes. There were a few tables outside that were unoccupied but that hadn't been cleaned. We asked our server, who was nice but an airhead, if we could move once one of them was cleared off. Finally a table was cleared and was waiting to be wiped down, but the unfriendly hostess managed to come out with another group of people at the same moment and between the hostess and our waiter there was about to be a cat fight. She didn't know that table hadn't even been cleaned with a rag and was going to sit people there which grossed me out. Eventually another dirty table not in the sun was cleaned for the second party and everyone was happy, although I was beginning to wonder if there was a busser at this restaurant, or what? Our food came out quickly, my boyfriend a burger and me a margherita pizza. The pizza was good and I was pleasantly surprised at the turnaround time on the order considering the obvious inexperience of the serving staff. Throughout the meal my boyfriend, who is a very thirsty person for some reason, had absolutely no water left in his glass. He asked not once, not twice, but 3 times for more water - he even drank all of mine! The manager was wandering around and asked how everything was and I mentioned that we had asked for water three times and as of yet, nothing. I really liked my server's personality and I felt bad getting him into trouble, but geez, get us our dang water!

Waiter was super friendly, as was the manager who checked in on us.

Food was a major disappointment. We started with potato chips covered in cheese sauce and a balsamic reduction - pretty tasty. Sadly, though, we kept coming back to our appetizer because our entrees were a real disappointment.

I had the barbeque chicken pizza which was a gigantic portion. Too bad it was so lackluster in flavor. The barbeque sauce was just a drizzle over the top, not the base of the pie. It was luke warm, hard to cut and just an overall downer of a dish.

My date had macaroni and cheese and it was insanely bland. Seriously.

The happy hour has 1/2 price all drinks and $5 select appetizers and is from 4pm to 8pm.  We called to make reservations, but the lady on the phone said that there's no need since there is always plenty of room.  This lead me to believe that no one would be there, but when we got there, there was a good amount of people.  We had to wait about 5 minutes to get seated which wasn't a big deal.  

The place was spacious, which was a plus.  We quickly ordered two apps and two drinks.  We had the sliders and calamari for the apps and I had the fleetwood long island while she had the platinum party drink.  The calamari was good, but not great.  The portion could have been about 1/3 bigger for the price.  The sauce it came with was very disappointing since it tasted just like a sweet chili sauce I use with my lumpia that I can by from the store for about $4.  Nothing special.  The sliders were very good, and my only complaint was that the tomato was under ripe. The fries they came with had a either kosher or sea salt on them which made them very tasty.  We also ordered the chicken taquitos from the happy hour menu.  They were pretty good, however I think a side of salsa would have made them better.  

What made the experience special was the customer service that we received.  Apparently our appetizers were taking rather long to get out to us, however we didn't seem to notice.  I honestly feel as though our apps came out in a timely fashion.  The manager who was there came by before our appetizers arrived and apologized for the wait.  We told him that it was no problem.  Completely unprovoked, he then told us that the drinks were on the house.  They were half price already, but still was $12 for the two and we didn't even know that there was a problem.  WOW!  I've never experienced such treatment.  It wasn't until I noticed how quickly another table got their apps after they ordered them that I saw just how quickly they normally bring food out.

The food was slightly average but the price of the food was a bit too high for what we got.  The drinks were very good.  I would have to say if it was not for the customer service, I would likely not have made the 40 minute drive for a second try, but I will likely make another trip out there.

Tell me what the point was for mr to drive there and make early reservations only to show up and get a table thats right in front of a speaker. No one else sat next to a speaker. They offered a booth. However I ha mentioned to the girl that 2 of the people in my group were tall and larger so they would be more comfortable at a table.  And whats the deal with no Budwiser beer.  All in all I spent 300.00 by the end of the night and feel ripped off as I didnt get what I paid for.

It's a cowboy resturant/bar.  Think of a hip Stoney's.  Yes, they have a mechanical bull too which riders seemed to want to grind last night.  

The menu looked pretty standard for bar food: chops, pulled pork, burgers, etc.  I think all food was priced under $30.  I didn't bother ordering food since it was too busy.   

The bottle service was reasonable with a $200 price on most bottles you'd get at a club.  I only recall the Veuve Clicquot being more at $230.

The outside glass rock fire pits were a nice touch to give it a lounge feel.  There are also a couple areas that could be closed off for single or multi-table parties.

They had a small dance floor inside.  Maybe it was an area where they would normally set up tables.  They played different genres of music which was cool.

I'm sure I'll go there again, although I will not go out of my way for it.  It could possibly be the newest LV local hotspot depending on the weekly events.  Stay tuned.",NIzALHObU1UblqCISSMC0Q,1,1,4,Fo1Kda3niuRKI4t-PCcXQw

The Service is mediocre at best... thankfully they serve REALLY BIG glasses of soda and water so that they don't have to attend to them that often.

The Food is .... ok... nothing spectacular... but Not Horrible either.... really Middle of the Road... but in this town... that is not a good thing because there are too many other places (Yard House downstairs) that offer better fare.

Ordered the Chopped Asian Salad... Note... this does not come with lettuce or mixed greens ... just chopped up asian cabbage, red cabbage, peanuts, chicken chunks, wonton strips and red onions... the menu said scallions which are fine by me... but if I knew it was red onions... I would have asked they be skipped as I don't care for red onions.  And the salad dressing... rice wine vinegar... was Too Sweet....  and sugar-y tasting for me.  Oh well... live and learn.

My mom ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders... you get 3 good size sliders that are served with a small side of slaw and french fries.  They 'looked' better than they tasted.  The pork was Dry.... the Bun was old/stale.... and the bottom bun was soggy.  The BBQ sauce was ok...

The bottle service was cheap, the food was greasy (that's all they offered after 10), and fun times were had by all.  Our server was amazing!

Sliders were delicious. The crispy onion strings was a nice touch. Get a side of BBQ sauce and it will be bomb diggity.

Sweet n Spicy Calamari was okay. I really liked the sauce but they smothered the calamari with it so the crunchiness was gone. If you're a fan of crunchy, get the sauce on the side. 

Wings were good. THEY WERE HUGE! I looked at them and said DAMN! Again, I like crunchy so guess what I did. I ordered the sauce on the side. As for the taste, well.. they were just normal wings. Nothing special.

Not only a LATE HH, but everything was %50 off for apps and drinks.

We got in there about 545 and had 45 min to kill.  My wife was having a great time that day telling everyone it was her birthday.  When we got in there she mentioned it to a gentleman who appeared to be the manager.  On the same hand, he greeted us and told us how everything worked.  VERY VERY friendly guy that was really cool.  He told the bartender that she had to take a shot with my wife and I for her birthday and it was up to my wife to take whatever shot she wanted.  THAT WAS PRETTY COOL.

We had some type of a pear martini drink (i didn't realize it was gonna come in a martini glass....i felt a lil Fem....haha) then I decided lets go with a Long island!!

First of all, you can't beat the entrace fee of only $10 for out of state and $5 for the locals.  The music was pretty good for the most part and the crowd was mixed with both young and older folks.

I ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and based on the recommendation from the server, I had a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down.  The food came out pretty fast and was very tasty.  The Breading on the Jalapenos were very light....not the heavy stuff you find on most Poppers.  The Peppers varied from being really Spicy to Mild.....which happens often with Jalapenos.  The ones that were Spicy were REALLY Spicy!  But I like that...so +1 there.  I didn't care for the Cheese filling though...which was a Cheddar blend of some kind....I prefer Cream Cheese filling.

The Lagunitas IPA was very tasty....you could taste the Hops, but it didn't overwhelm the flavor.  It was a mellow IPA in my book.  The server made sure my glass was never empty during the game.

We were seated quickly and given special lunch menus. They had a variety of things for us to choose from for around $9, including a 'pick two' deal where you got half of a sandwich and a side. 

The friend-of-my-friend inquired about the soups for the day. Since it was Friday we were not surprised to hear clam chowder was an option, as well as a baked potato soup. Our waiter was very honest and told us that you do not get many clams with the chowder. That is pretty lame but I appreciated the honesty. So I asked his opinion on the ahi tuna salad sandwich I was considering and the look on his face made it clear I needed to continue to look. 

Finally decided on the slider again for my sandwich, extra sauce this time. And bowl of the baked potato soup. When the food came out, I had fries with my slider. The waiter asked if we needed silver wear, which I would if my order had came out correct, so I pointed out my lack of soup. He quickly rectified the situation. 

I was glad he did, the soup was the best part of my meal. It had carrots in it though, which seemed out of place. My slider was smothered with onion strings and slightly more sauce then my previous visit.

I am not upset about it.. but i was hungry and looking to sit.. so I didn't know if I was supposed to seat myself. Then a little blond came out and asked if there was anything she could help us with. 

I said, ""yes.. we would like to sit and eat"".. she just looked at me as if i said something wrong. I dunno what it was about. then they put us in a crowded section where the server was just overwhelmed. She as very friendly.. very friendly.. and inquired about 4 times as to what we were doing later. So we told her, but she seemed uninterested. So maybe I just read the whole place wrong. 

Our food took about 20 minutes and the appetizer of chicken fingers never showed. We just canceled them cuz the mains were there. The manager decided to bring them anyway and said they would just go to waste. It was a nice gesture.. but you could tell they had been forgotten in the window.. cuz they were just less than warm. Oh well, I ate 3 of them anyway. I had ordered only a Iceberg wedge salad because I wasn't into anything else and the chicken fingers and the salad were going to be the meal for me.

4343132,2010-01-12,1,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,Was visiting my bff in Vegas and we moseyed on over here after leaving Blue Martini (for lack of better music). It was a Saturday night and probably passed 11pm. I don't remember paying cover. I'm pretty sure I didn't. I was already tipsy. I didn't buy any drinks here. The music was ok. Later on in the night it got a lot better though. The place was kinda chill. There were a lot of people but it was big enough that it wasn't crowded. It had a nice patio area. Plenty of space to dance. There's a mechanical bull but my skirt was much too short.,33O3WZ_odvT2GdwTKMXROg,0,0,4,N5lF08swFxow6_8jQ-Kn6Q

The back patio has a bar there so you don't have to try to flag someone down for a drink.  I do have to say their appetizers were pretty good, during happy hour the appetizers were all $5 each.

It is a little hard to compete with Blue Martini, since they are right next to each other.  Blue Martini has a bit more livelier and modern feel to it.  But those that want to have some drinks and get enough courage to ride the mechanical bull, with a laid back atmosphere, this would be a good place to go.

4484772,2009-07-18,0,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"Wow!  When I got to this restaurant on Yelp I never expected to see such an undeservedly low rating.  We had dinner there tonight for the first time, and had a blast.

First, I should say that we are not the typical Friday night customers - we're old enough to be the parents of most every patron in the place, so you might think we were like fish out of water.  It was very loud and jam-packed, just the kind of atmosphere I usually hate.  But it had an energy that was infectious!

Maybe it helped that there was a promo going on - sign up at the door and get three tickets for free drinks (white wine or vodka+) from 6-9 pm.  Just my kind of drinks.  So by the time we got to sit down for dinner we weren't feeling much pain.

We had a coupon from the newspaper for a BOGO.  Our very attentive waitress told us about the night's specials, and we decided to order the mahi mahi in coconut and mango something or other, plus the Chicken Diablo from the regular menu.  We asked if we could use the coupon on the special.  She said yes, but returned a moment later, very apologetic, and said that it was good only from Monday to Thursday.  My husband is never one to hear the word ""no"" and accept it as Gospel, so he asked her to send over the manager.  The manager, Eric, came over right away. Before hubby could even open his mouth, Eric, smiling, said he has trouble reading tiny print, too, and of course they'd take the coupon.  We were very surprised, not only by his agreeing to do it, but also by the friendly and gracious attitude he had.  There are way too many restaurant owners and managers who don't understand the ""Word of Mouth"" concept, but this manager was not one of them.  And we are diehard loyalists, and go out of our way to tell people when we've had such positive experiences.

Happily, I don't have to make up anything positive.  Our waitress was really, really good - friendly, efficient, but not intrusive.  And the food was very good, too.  The mahi mahi dish was excellent.  The Chicken Diablo was good.  It could have used a little kick to help it live up to the name, but the penne wasn't overcooked and there wasn't too much sauce or salt.

All in all, we had a terrific time and a very good dinner, and we look forward to going back.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,4,VsInRQVWQED7PVeZenTiiw
4491383,2010-09-25,0,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"The only reason this isn't getting a one star review is because the service was good. I'm usually not a complainer but I hated my meal. 

I had their Bourbon Steak which is not on their real menu but on their dinner special hand out. It came with green beans and mashed potatoes. The green beans were tasty I finished all of those but the mashed potatoes had the after taste of medical gauze. I took two bites and that's all I could handle. I asked for the steak to be medium well so it would be juicy but it was still dry . I tried to doctor it up with some A-1 sauce and it was still blah. I know this place is not gourmet but I did expect it to be comparable to TGI Fridays, Applebees, and if you want to go old school ....Sizzler. It just didn't cut it in my book. 

I didn't want to say anything to my husband who was paying for the meal but I guess he saw it on my face. He was like, ""What's wrong...did I do something wrong?"" He probably thought I was giving him grief about smiling too much at the waitress or something like that. I was like ""no""...then he really thought he was in trouble for something so I finally told him I was not happy with my meal. He told me to send it back ...I didn't want to get back a spit drenched steak so I opted for settling for it. 

I also ordered a cocktail called Rock Candy it was a $12.00 dollar drink but since it was happy hour it came out to $6.00. I had my ideas about what it would look like before it came out. In my head I pictured it in a big Margarita glass the contents being bright pink and a stick of blue rock candy sticking out of it. I thought for this price it should not only taste good but it should look cute too! When the waitress brought it out I thought it was water with lemons in it. Then she came back to ask me how I liked my drink. I didn't try it yet because I thought it was just water so I took a sip of it and told her it was good. The first couple of sips was good but not great. It tasted more and more like watered down lemonade as time went on. 

We had the Banana's Foster for dessert which I thought I would like because I've had one before. Their version is something I have not experienced till now ...first of all there was no crepe...boo! It was warm bananas swimming around in creme sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice ream in the middle drizzled with caramel. The warm bananas are good as a breakfast meal but not for dessert. So I only took about three bites of that. 

I don't like writing bad reviews so I'll end this on what I did like. If it wasn't for the Cadillac Ranch State Fries I think I would have went home hungry. These are jumbo potato seasoned fries with cheese bacon and sour cream. I should have ordered two of these for my meal and I would have walked out a happy camper!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,3,0,2,EABnXSHZ6Bj1CQ6ECDP17g
4492109,2011-05-24,3,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"I'm not sure where to really start to review this place.

It is in a great location at Town Square, so it could be a good place to stop in if you were shopping there or going tothe movies there. It has kinda cool decor...sort of a rock n' roll theme with guitars on the wall and photos of people like Taylor Swift & Bon Jovi. The bar has lots of TVs for sports, too.

We went in the afternoon, so it was really dead, which made me feel like the service should have been fantastic, but it wasn't. Our sever, Danielle, seemed to be stoned out of her mind. She talked really really slow, and said things like ""restauarants are in my genetic make up"" and ""I can make recommendations 'cause I work here"". She was nice enough, but there was visible dirt under her fingernails and she kept leaning all over the table to make her aforementioned recommendations...which kinda grossed me out.

The food and drinks took FOREVER which, again, I couldn't understand since were were practically the only people there. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers (pulled pork sliders & cheeseburger sliders) and sharing. Both were served with french fries that were ICE COLD. The sliders were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.

It took forever to get the check, and the bill came to over $30 for only the 2 appetizers, an iced tea, and a soda. So, in my opinion, WAY over priced!

We ordered a couple of drinks off their cocktail menu: 
* Pear...fect 59 Cadillac ""Enjoy our signature cocktail made with Grey Goose La Poire and fresh pear puree."" ($10) - We were surprised to see it arrive in a martini glass, something to think about if you're expecting a pint glass.  It was sweet and you can definitely taste the pear puree.

* Seville ""Experience a delightful and refreshing blend of Sauza Hornitos Plata, Citronge, Fresh Mango Puree and Fresh Lime Juice."" ($10) - This arrived in a pint glass and you could definitely taste the alcohol in it.  Decent overall.  

We were initially going to order a bunch of their half off appetizers, but changed our minds after we saw their $7 select appetizer menu.  

They did offer a Complete Dinner for Two for $29.95 from Mondays to Fridays from 4 pm to 8 pm.  (Add 2 Well Drinks - $34.95)  You can choose one select appetizer to share, one select entree each, and one select dessert to share.

* Kettle Chips ""Thinly sliced potatoes deep fried to perfection and served with garlic cream sauce and blue cheese crumbles.  Finished with a Balsamic drizzle and scallions."" - A hearty portion of tasty potato chips with a yummy creamy garlic sauce and a decent amount of blue cheese crumbles.

* Candied Pecan Pork Chop ""One thick-cut chops grilled and crusted with candied pecans.  Served over caramelized onion mashed potatoes and green beans."" - Their regular entree course includes two pork chops, but you only get one in the dinner special.  A nice crust on that pork chop.

* Bourbon Sirloin Steak ""8 oz. beef sirloin seasoned and broiled to perfection, then placed on a demi glaze.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans."" - The regular entree course is a 10 oz cut.  Ours was also served with corn.  

* Strawberry Fried Cheesecake - Only available on the dinner special.  Asked the waitress about it and she couldn't say much beyond that she really liked it.  She didn't think it was deep-fried since it wasn't oily.  It's actually a flaky pastry with the cheesecake mixture inside and covered with cinnamon sugar.  Served with a strawberry sauce and cream.

Food and service were okay, nothing special.  The busboys were quick about clearing out the dishes as they needed.  We probably wouldn't eat or drink here without it being happy hour or they were offering a special.

$3 Corona and Corona Light (from 9 pm to close)
$5 House Margaritas and Cadillac Margaritas (from 9 pm to close)

They were at Cadillac Ranch....I never thought I'd ever walk in here because this kind of place is everything I'm not, but I'm up for an adventure. Some of those ""not my scene"" places have changed my mind before, but this visit solidifies why I didn't step in here on my own volition. 

It was half off drinks so decided to grab some libations and from advice of people who've been- we skipped out on food. I got a Leguntas IPA off the draft and it was bad. I know that this was either old or the keg wasn't properly cared for because I know what this beer is supposed to taste like on tap. This was off. This place isn't really a crowd that is ordering much of the IPA's and the Lagers so they probably sit while the ""Lites"" are getting switched out like hotcakes. Even so, staff should watch the kegs more carefully and drain pour old stuff as needed. I was impressed when I saw something not typical Bud/Miller/Coors on the tap so it made my disappointment worse when it couldn't even be fresh. I didn't complain because it was 3 dollars and we already sent back some incorrect black and tans. 

Some of our party wanted a ""black and tan"" with Guinness and Sam Adams Boston Lager.....waitress didn't know what this was so when it came mixed instead of split, it made us think that they poured it from the draft and not properly spooned in to separate the beers. Someone later came and said that the weights aren't correct to do the split and gave them a ""Black and Blue"" (Guinness and Blue Moon) instead. Though we couldn't dispute the weight issue at the time, I later got researching. Guinness with Sam Adams does indeed exist as a ""Patriot Pint""....I am waiting on a beeradvocate answers if this indeed is split or is blended together. 

We didn't know it was a Band Battle on the locals night so it was way too loud to talk inside. We are talkative folks so it dampened things. Sorry Vegas, but talent isn't up to par with other big cities so I didn't care to stick around. The band playing sounded alright, but made some major sound errors and were pulling out their sounds, ripoff, not inspired by people who came before them. One being an ex (I'll never tell), so I know well when people are arranging their music like his. 

Yeah, I'm an asshole for saying so, but I'm an asshole with a music collection sitting at home that literally enough to open a music store, a music set up and friends in high places in the industry. Until some quality band (Panic does not count because they don't know how to play live) out here makes it big time, then anyone bitching at me how wonderful the local scene is wrong.  Scenesters, go cry to your Edward Sharpe album and if you see their drummer, Josh, tell him he owes Jade (me) some bubble bath bombs. Enjoy music by all means as it is the greatest mediums in the world, but don't try to convince me out of things I know to be true.  

After 30 minutes of attempting to yell a conversation and half drunk beers, we went downstairs to the Yardhouse for some serious brews from well cared for taps.

Wish the drinks were half off but I always seem to miss happy hours by just minutes since it ends at midnight.  Good calamari though, give t a try when you're here.

5231976,2010-03-12,3,7B4ZXiaDDcg04_N1A0DG9A,"Last night my husband and I drove to town square to hit up our new favorite place - Cana. When we walked up to Cana we were told it was closed for a private event. BUMMER.

We considered all the options in Town Square. It was 6:30 PM , so too late for Yardhouse happy hour (btw, screw You Yardhouse and your 3-6 PM HH!), not in the mood for Blue martini.. hmmm.. why not try something new! 

I honestly wasn't thrilled with my husbands choice. It looked pretty lame, and the food menu wasn't exciting me. HOWEVER, Happy hour ends at 8 PM there (big plus!), and I was curious. 

I have to admit, for the type of place it was (cheesy, corporate, western themed, slutty bartenders, all the things I hate!), I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and drink prices. 

We had Blue Moons and Pear Ciders ($3/pint), and tried the Nachos, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and the Ahi Tuna ($7 each). 

My husband declared the Nachos the best restaurant nachos ever (ok apparently he's easy to please?).

Chicken lettuce wraps was different cause the chicken was fried. And dipped in Sesame. And awesome. The lettuce and fried wontons the glorious chicken was served with seemed gratuitous and we didn't eat that. However we loved the chicken. Freaking awesome little fried nuggets of sesame goodness! 

Tuna was a pleasant surprise. I would say it's comparable to what I usually get at Yardhouse (Ahi Tuna crunch salad), but it had peanuts in the salad, a creamier (ie less healthy) dressing, and the tuna had a nice ponzu on it. The serving was smallish- but very similar in size to Yardhouse. 

As mentioned above, the bartenders were particularly plastic and slutty looking. They acted particularly unprofessionally (gossiping loudly amongst themselves the entire time we were there!), but that's all to be expected in a corporate cheese-ball Vegas place. 

Overall I guess what I'm saying is this place isn't all that bad if you're ever stuck here like I was. Food is surprisingly good (for corporate bar food!), and the drink prices are reasonable during HH.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,7,5,3,MLKBnQIAYUGWD4WhMfXHhQ

At the bar, we were informed they were out of Bud Light. So my husband ordered another beer on tap. When the bartender placed it in front of him, the top was all foam. My husband politely asked the other bartender if she could top it off for him. She said, ""Sorry, we have a one inch foam policy."" We thought she was joking. When she just stared at us, he said, ""Wait, are you serious?"" ""Yeah,"" she said. ""I'm backing him up. That's our policy."" WTF?! Our friend took out his phone and measured the beer with a ruler app. After the foam went down, the beer was an inch and a half below the rim of the glass. That's their policy?

Even when she came out afterward, she simply came to remove a glass, and was walking away when I stopped her to ask if she could please get some of us water since we had literally been there for 45 minutes and had nothing. 

Some people ordered appetizers from the bar because they couldn't take it anymore. They were also out of 4 appetizers that were on the menu. When the bartender came to deliver them outside, he said they were out of ranch dressing. I wondered aloud how a place could be out of Bud Light, ranch, and 4 different appetizers... He replied, ""Oh, we're closing down. This is probably going to be our last night in business."" Yup, he said he was dead serious. Now it all made sense. This was their last night open and none of the employees gave a sh*t. 

As the night went on, we learned that they DID in fact have Bud Light. It was in bottles, yet it was never offered when we tried to order it. They also had blue cheese dressing and chipotle ranch dressing, both of which were never offered when we asked for ranch. The parents of the bride had to go inside to order appetizers for everyone. Employees only came outside to deliver our food and take away empty plates. We were all left to our own devices if we needed anything else, whether it was water or napkins. All 40 of us were COMPLETELY ignored. 

There was one bartender who was very nice. When we mentioned that we learned this was their last night in business he said, ""Where did you hear that? We're closing down, but not for a few more weeks."" So the other guy just lied? 

This place had such great potential. The atmosphere was very House of Blues-ish. I liked it when I first walked in. Now all I can say is, I TOTALLY understand why they're going out of business. They don't value their customers at all.",i5h0mqGsqtOerEa05ar-Vw,4,1,1,b--COpy5sibngFgbxoQQGQ

Price is not bad overall, especially if you consider their $5 appetizers, which is like HH pricing and you can order a lot of different food for a casual get together or while watching whatever game is on (you can request the game you want on the TV).

Service is friendly. Orders does however take awhile to be delivered from the kitchen, at least the 2 times I was there when the restaurant wasn't even busy or at 25% capacity (Sunday at around noon and a Thursday afternoon around 5pm).

Spinach, Artichoke and Jumbo Lump Crab Dip served with Crispy Flatbread was good. At $12.95 it is one of their most expensive appetizers, but you get good portions and the flatbread can get addicting.

The only $5 appetizer I tried and liked was the Avocado Eggroll.  You get 1.5 fried eggrolls filled with creamy avocado, which I think is pricey for what it is, but it is yummy.

The Philly Cheesesteak sandwich is just alright. What you get for $10.95 is huge portion, which can easily feed two people with a normal appetite. Their French Fries is good and you get a lot with the sandwich.

Sirloin Steak and Shrimps - steak was nicely marked, but didn't have much flavor and the Demi Sauce that came with it was quickly used up.  The Tiger Shrimps with the scampi sauce was alright too.  I didn't want the Baked Potatoes side, so my waitress switched it with another side (broccoli).

The dessert I tried was Chocolate Lovin' Spoon Cake.  You get a generous slice of cake, which is moist, but I also don't think they make this in house.

Overall, I think it is a cool place to hang out and grab some food (nothing fancy or super delicious) while catching a game or taking a break from shopping.  I am sure it is a cool place to go to at night for an alternative clubbing experience, but I can't comment on that for lack of personal experience.  I do know that the restaurant is available for private functions, as they held a kid's birthday party in the patio seating area on my first visit, and blocked off 1/4 of the restaurant for a private get together on my second visit.

Decor: 3/5  - can get pretty dark in there, but I like their oversize posters, and there are a lot of TVs with ESPN or some game on pretty much at all times.

Food: 2/5 - Not going to win any James Beard awards, but most people come here for the drink specials and grab food as an afterthought.

Price: 3/5

Service: 4/5 - Friendly.

Location: 4/5 - in the hip locals hangout/shopping/entertainment/dining spot off-Strip.

* Mechanical Bull - has potential and just needs the right combination of a good operator and a hottie with a good kung-fu grip for the ride.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,3,3,3,2Pj8MISd6nNgeVoXHwJWMw

I haven't eaten here before; we were going to last night, but then one of my guy friends was in a tee-shirt and they wouldn't let him in. It's a BBQ place for Christ's sake- stop taking yourself so seriously!!",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,2,PcDn6PpnN1pfeTzRjDfw4A
