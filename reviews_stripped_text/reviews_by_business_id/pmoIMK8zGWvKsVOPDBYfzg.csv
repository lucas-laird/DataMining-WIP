9081,2014-06-18,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"I'm just going to throw it all out there and say this is probably the best meal I have ever had, bar none.

We ended up here thanks to a $50 food and beverage comp I had.  If it hadn't been for that, I would have never even thought to eat at this place.  This was everything you would expect from a high-end restaurant: beautiful decor, ambiance, superior service.  I was extremely impressed that when the dining room doors were closed, you absolutely cannot hear any of the noise from the casino floor.  Quite the feat considering when were were there the table dancers were performing less than 50 steps away from the entrance to the restaurant.

We started with the escargot.  It was incredibly fantastic.  I'd had escargot before and it was always my experience that they were a little bit chewy, so that is what I expected.  That was completely not the case here.  They were warm. soft, tender, buttery, and just enough garlic to get a really good flavor but it didn't punch you in the mouth or send you running for the mouthwash.

For our entrees my boyfriend had the sauteed green-peppercorn filet of beef and I had the pan seared duck breast and duck sausage.  On my first bite I just melted.  Gave out and audible ""mmmmmm"" complete with an eyeroll....and again with the second bite....and again with the third....then I cut into the sausage and I nearly fell out of the booth.  Every bite was pure heaven.  I think my boyfriend was pretty sure he was going to have to take my upstairs for a smoke afterward!  I have never had duck so perfectly cooked.  Tender, juicy, and so full of flavor.

My boyfriend was enjoying the same out of his steak.  He sacrilegiously ordered the steak ""medium"", which in my opinion instantly kills the flavor of the meat.  However it was so wonderfully seasoned that there was zero compromise in the flavor and so perfectly cooked that I'm pretty sure it could have been cut with a spork!

For dessert we decided on the pistachio souffle with white chocolate sauce.  Completely fluffy, moist, sweet goodness in a bowl.  It stood beautifully and there was a wonderful crisp crunch to the outside, and oh-so-soft, warm, and melted inside.  The last bite where the white chocolate sauce had fused with and melted into the remains of the souffle was complete perfection.

Normally I would scoff at dropping this much coin on a single meal, but this place is now going to be built into the Vegas budget.  I'm a year away from going again and already I'm craving this food.  We've already decided on the rack of lamb and Dover sole for the next round!",pplya_6D9ElaNXhoFvpZFg,5,2,5,zDQAp9_BpF3GZ_jJ9bApKQ

The dining room is elegant and makes you forget completely that you are only a wall or two away from the casino floor. We had the lobster bisque, beef tongue, filet, veal loin, lobster, and chocolate souffle. The food was a bit rich (and the tiniest bit too salty) but the flavors were perfectly executed. The food was equal in quality to what we enjoyed in top restaurants in Paris last year. We had a lovely dinner and would recommend the place to anyone looking for excellent food and service on the strip.",7XTQK7OX-d_Fiv05uhNydw,1,0,5,P_F29i6ehUozn3lKVklfVA
52357,2010-11-23,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"A must for foodies with a fine sense of attention to detail!  A good friend and I had a  wonderful wine paired dinner about 2 months ago.  We both had the 5 course tasting menu.  I'm not too sure but it may have changed to the new fall/winter menu but with  talented Chef Gary LaMorte at the wheel, I see no hesitation for anyone to give Andre's a try!  
The first thing that will catch your eye is that this restaurant is not like your normal Las Vegas fine dinning eatery.  You stroll into the beautiful bar into a very intimate dinning room.  I would say about a 50 seater.  What really catches your attention is the decor of the room. Elegant but not too over the top. The room is set with a lot of space in between tables, often this is over looked when other restaurants try to cram as many tables into a room.  I loved how you felt old school, and new school at the same time.  
I would highly recommend the tasting menu with wine pairings.  Every course that came to our table was greeted with Chef Gary coming to the table and explaining the dish!  I think that is so key to see the Chef come out into the dinning room to greet guests!  I know that depending on service the Chef may not make it to every single table, but that fact that other diners see the Chef making effort to get to they guests, is something that you don't see everyday in Las Vegas. 
Now for the food!!!!!!!   All I have to say is that this was the best (by far) dinning experience that I have had!  Like I said before ATTENTION TO DETAIL is on every dish! From the amuse, to dessert, everything was spot on!  First course was poached lobster and foie, roasted pistachio puree, Casi's reduction.  You might laugh at this but not to take away from the lobster and foie, but the puree was UNREAL!!!!!!  Texture on that was so so so smooth!  This dish was served with a foie, martini.  If your a foie fan, and a martini fan this is another must have!!!!  Next course, seared day boat scallop, sturgeon fish caviar, smoked scallop slices, pearl yam puree, curry sauce.  With this dish everything just went very very well together.  Next course, Pan roasted king fish, fennel puree, roasted red beet, citrus butter.  Once again bulls eye for this dish!  Next course, my favorite, veal loin, sear foie, sweetbreads, spinach, and mitake mushroom, with a cardamon jus.  I loved how the cardamon went with the sweetbread, just the right amount of sweetness to the dish.  For dessert it was some sort of chocolate mousse but not as light as a  mousse.  I loved the textures in this dish also.
After the meal Chef Gary once again greeted us at the table to see how are experience went. Of course it was amazing to say the least.  I forgot to mention the upstairs cigar/conac room.  I myself is not a cigar fan, but to those who are, this IS a must!  
So the next time your significant other asks you, ""Where are we gonna go for dinner?""  Your answer will be Andre's in the Monte Carlo!",xlGmwNF262UA2HxThm0LUw,0,0,5,q3X7uA-_IionRkiDaIZyCA

Their dining room is tucked away behind closed doors and off the casino floor, so the dining room was very quiet and peaceful, that being said, there were only about 4 other couples there for a 9 pm reservation time. We went for their M club member pre fixe menu for $60, which we thought was a great deal! Our steaks were delicious and the creme brulee trio was amazing! I was able to use my check-in on yelp for a free cocktail of their choosing!

89528,2012-04-13,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"I guess it's because we've been to the old Andre's in downtown (which has been closed down now), we can only give this one 2 stars, course it is not as good as what we had at the downtown one in the past. The food didn't taste bad, just not meeting up to what the downtown one could offer. I don't know why. I suppose it's the same owner same chef, why the difference??
My husband got a Rib Eye steak, I got the dover sole. My husband said the Rib Eye steak was bad but not a wow. My dover sole was okay too but the sauce was too sour that I couldn't really taste the fish. The sourness of the sauce overpowered the taste of the beautiful dover sole. It was a little bit disappointing. 
At the end, my husband got a carrot cake souffle and I got the raspberry white chocolate souffle. But they pour the mixed up the sauce, and poured the white chocolate sauce on the carrot cake souffle, and the cream cheese anglaise on the raspberry white chocolate souffle (the right order should be white chocolate sauce on the raspberry white chocolate souffle, and cream cheese anglaise on carrot cake souffle). So they had to remake the other 2 for us. (The taste was really funky when the wrong sauce got on the wrong souffle). 

At the end they charged us $1 caring donation, probably because of the remaking of the souffles. I was just stupid enough not to ask them at the spot. I should have asked if the $1 is due to the fact that they had to remake the souffles. I guess I was too tired that night so my brain didn't function properly. Now I think about it and even wonder why I didn't tell them that the sauce of the dover sole was too sour????? Why didn't I say something right away? Now I can only learn the lesson not to do fine dining on a tiring night. But who knows what other caring donation they would have charged if they were going to remake my dover sole! I just don't understand why they didn't state everything up front.....it seems so wrong to me. I was never asked to pay for someone's mistake in my past dining experience. 

We are not going back at all, they don't seem to be doing the business in the right way. What a disappointment. Even bigger disappointment when we had the old Andre's to compare it with. Sigh.....",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,1,0,2,Ziomdqp6XJk66rh-uOmxjQ
94455,2013-02-23,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Don't go as a group earlier than 7:30.  We arrived at 6:45 as a group of three, and it was awkwardly hushed and romantic.  However, if that's the scene you're looking for, it was lovely.  I think that maybe it's better for couples than groups.  The decor and styling can't be faulted.  We had two foodies and one non-foodie/food-fearful person in our group.  Andre's was a great way to introduce him to fine French food.  The courses were nicely paced.  Normally, we only order one course at a time, to prevent the kitchen from turning dishes out too quickly.  Our server at Andre's politely asked if we could order all courses at the start of the meal to help the kitchen prep, and then just inform him when we would like them fired.  The iPad wine list was interesting, but not working great when we used it.  However, it really broke up the wines nicely to help with the selection process.  Our apps included Cesar salad (don't judge...), escargot, and fois two ways.  Treatment of the fois was very nice, though I found the fruit compote a bit too cloyingly sweet and would have liked a bit more acid to liven up the richness of the seared fois.  The escargots were very nice.  Entrees included the hoisin duck, venison rack, and lobster thermidor.  My husband loved the lobster, but again, I thought it was just rich without a lot of complexity.  He voiciferously disagrees.  Our non-foodie friend was really impressed with the hoisin duck.  We all split the nutella souffle for dessert, and I loved that it wasn't too sweet.

Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of the meal.  It was elegant and very professionally served.  I would absolutely go back.  If I were to go as a group, I would probably make a later reservation.  I think I would also be very likely to sit at the bar right outside so that I could people-watch while enjoying the full menu.",b_RJXpgaHuXzuFkPFHlCHQ,2,0,4,po3vFJSNGgR9hTSDDAzrXg

We advised the staff we were using this coupon, ready to receive a noticeable drop in the quality of the service. As it was a limited menu you cod use due to the coupon, we were ready to taste the ""b"" team. Our final expectation was that this standard French restaurant would be overly formal and stuffy. This restaurant did not meet these expectations. 
The service was excellent. Attentive without being bothersome. Our expectations of the service were exceeded. 
The food was top notch. Was it overly brash, innovative or daring?  No. It was, however, excellent and very well executed. From the amuse bouche to the excellent desserts, even from the coupon menu, they all were fantastic. 
Finally, the atmosphere was very fine, classy, and refined. But, it was not stuffy. Our server had a light and appropriate sense of humor. The bussers were fun, but not irreverent.

Back in the '80s and early 90's Las Vegas was a restaurant wasteland. The one exception to that was Andre's.  I have eaten at Andre's dozens of times and never had a bad meal ever.

168656,2009-05-22,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My boyfriend and I share the same birthday, so we decided to try Andre's at the suggestion of a colleague and based on yelp reviews. 

As Charles and Chef Greg mentioned in their reviews, the new decor is beautiful. We loved it and it was very romantic but we were one of three parties in the restaurant at the time and the party we were sat next to was very loud and distracting. (On the bright side, I learned several new marketing techniques for Italian neighborhood's in New York. Ha!)  

We started with an amuse of chilled carrot soup with shrimp and a balsamic reduction. It was delicious! I've never been a fan of chilled soup but the flavors melded perfectly (and it got my boyfriend to eat vegetables, so hey bonus points). 

For starters, we ordered the pan-seared foie gras and the bison carpaccio. The foie gras was absolutely fabulous and really well complimented by the apple tart! The conversation that followed after I took the first bite: 

BF: Well, what is it?
Me: Just try it. 
BF: Tell me what it is.
Me: I'll tell you after you try it. 

Needless to say, he tried it and loved it. Then I told him what it was and he wouldn't eat anymore of it. Oh well, more for me, yay!  I have never tried bison and was looking forward to it. It was very good and had a nice flavor to it. The pesto that accompanied was a bit overpowering for me, but it is possible I had too much on my bite. The arugula and pickled mushrooms were standard, nothing special to me. 

For our entrees, we had the filet of beef and the potato wrapped salmon.   The filet was very tender, cooked exactly the way I liked and the hollandaise sauce went extremely well will the beef and asparagus.  I did not like the potato and the onion confit (aka caramelized onions on top of potato slice). I felt as if the onion was overcooked giving it a slightly bitter flavor and although the crispness of the potato was nice, it lacked any seasoning. 

The salmon was cooked nicely and the crust was very crisp but it lacked any wow that you would expect from a place of this caliber. I think my boyfriend wished he had ordered something else. 

We ordered the grand marnier souffle and it was perfect. Very good. If you  are not a huge fan of chocolate like me (yes, I am a female, why do you ask?), I would recommend this in place. And although we waited until our dinner was almost over, it really didn't take too long. But then again, I was enjoying my company. 

As for drinks. At the beginning of the meal, I was asked if I wanted wine. Well, I did want wine but the bf won't drink it and considering I am a petite young gal of 25, I figured I didn't need a whole bottle to myself.  So I ask her if I can have a vodka martini and when I decide what I want to order, I would appreciate some help pairing a wine by the glass or maybe even a half bottle. Well, my martini came but my help choosing a wine didn't.  So I stuck with my martinis which were fine but considering the extensive wine list, a little disappointing. 

Which brings me to my next point. The service was a little underwhelming.  While decent, the only suggestion made to us was the foie.  I would think that the server would like to talk and be passionate about the food and give us some suggestions when prodded. We decided to order salads after our starters but she never came back before our entrees arrived. I enjoyed the bread and spread but I ran out of bread and was never offered anymore. The water we were served was not cold and there was no ice in it (sorry, i don't believe in paying for bottled water).  I'm not sure why the service at our table was lacking, as it clearly wasn't at the other two tables. 

I was looking forward to an unforgettable and memorable evening for our birthday and I left really disappointed. I really really wanted to love this restaurant.  I recall when I was a teenager my grandparents would frequent the Andre's downtown and always raved about it. I've been waiting to try Andre's for years! 

I want to give it another chance, I really do but there are so many great establishments to try in this city.  I wanted my taste buds to dance and I wanted to feel special and I just really didn't.",rONMYLVdSph8OQBb27wDKQ,2,0,3,2Jz3K7MOsIIgMVeW0tZq5w

I ordered French onion soup and duck for my entree. My friend ordered Ceaser salad and  sea bass. My duck was really great but the few slides of sausage that came with it was salty. My friend's sea bass was very fishy and he was able to smell it when they brought it over. 

I was surprised for the food quality for a restaurant awarded Michelin 1 star. Since we were invited by another friend, We were not inclined to give any negative comment in front of our host.

After trying their New Year Eve tasting menu, it's very disappointing.

None of the dishes made a lasting impression and the biggest problem was some of the dishes were way too salty.

The main course was roasted chicken filled with foie gras.  The sauce is way over salted that you can't taste foie gras or anything else inside.  Same goes for sweet pea soup with king crab.  The salt killed most flavors in the food.

It was $185 tasting menu dinner with wine and tips, $250.  Sad to say, this place is no where comparing to French Landry, and even for local popular French places in San Francisco bay area, I can have much better French food much lower price.

I took four people there with the offer from travelzoo. Would have done it without, but the offer made it even better. 

A little advice: Explore the wine list. We started with a California brut champagne. We then had the Cherry Tart Pinot with our main course. We spent a lot of time with the sommelier and he was more than accommodating.  After dinner two of us had a flight of cognac, along with a nice port.  All the wine worked perfectly with the food. 

For the first course we had the salad, carpaccio, onion soup and the lobster bisque. All were excellent. We returned the salad, needing to have a second salad with dressing on the side, a request the staff honored quickly. I added a second course of the seared foie gras since good food is illegal in my home state of California. The treatment was distinct and excellent. Cooked perfectly. 

For the main courses, we had the halibut, the flat iron steak and the duck. Each was cooked perfectly. I asked for medium rare on the steak, it was perfectly and precisely cooked.   We all had soufflé for dessert. 

The presentation for each was very good, the service was top flight and the experience was absolutely as expected. 

As others have said, once you are inside the restaurant you will have no idea you are inside a casino.  Also, a prior post expressed regret over the perceived dissimilar treatment received as a result of using the TravelZoo offer. We looked for any sign of this and saw nothing. We were served and treated as well, perhaps even better than others. One member of our group has some significant food allergies and our waiter worked through the entire list.  He made sure there was no shellfish in the sauce, brought her gluten free bread and made a gluten free soufflé for her.

Also the noise from the casino floor and a view of the faux strippers near the gambling tables will keep this place a 4 star bar, as I see no way to fix these flaws.",v5E6ALS5AajIVKEU07e2Eg,0,0,4,6h6k05OyjrLYGwG2pwPtQw

Beets were roasted to perfection and the vinagrette was the perfect compliment to the addition of some very sage-y sausage. 

The only negative was the atmosphere. It is RIGHT off the casino floor in the Monte Carlo, so it does not feel very far removed from the hordes of 80 year old ladies in t-shirts and visors playing slots.

582616,2010-07-22,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My friends and I went to try this restaurant because I read from a website that it is the best French Restaurant in the city of Las Vegas! After hearing that it's the best French food that you can find, my friends couldn't wait to try this restaurant. 

Upon entering the restaurant, I felt that the place was small but they had an upper level which was really pretty. The atmosphere and ambience is really how you would like it to be if you wish for a nice quiet and intimate dinner with your friends, family, relatives or loved ones.

We took a long time to decide what dishes we would like to order as they had so many good choices and we just simply couldn't decide on one. In the end, we ultimately decided to try different dishes so that we would know which one we shouldn't order if we were to come back, and I hope we do! However, there was no such thing as ""which one we shouldn't order"" because everything was great.

Since it's a French restaurant, they served us a complimentary starter for us to cleanse our mouth (I suppose) before starting to eat our breads, that came with 3 different kind of butter -- Black Olive, Normal butter and Tomato Butter and also before our appetizers came. 

For starters, we had:
1) Escargots de Bourgogne -- I had a bad experience with Escargot once and was reluctant to try this for the second time in my life. However, I'm glad I did try it because this was really good. It had a great texture and it was full of flavors from the herbs that it was cooked with. 
2) Farm Raised Abalone Almondine with Celery Root Mousseline -- It was a new taste to my taste bud, I don't think I have ever tried something like this before. It was refreshing and I would definitely eat this again.
3) Spring Vegetable Risotto with Ricotta Salata and Saffron Butter, served with grated Black Truffle that they grate at your table. This was really good, even to me who dislike the taste of Black Truffle. I eventually took more of it despite the taste because I liked the texture and everything else on that bowl of Risotto. Yums.

The next complimentary serving was a Pear Sorbet, small light and wonderful.

Unveiling our food at our table, we had:
1) Muscovy Duck Breast with Red Rice, Bok Choy and Ramarind Sauce -- Thick cuts of the Duck Breasts, cooked to be a little pink, perfect texture and with vegetable on the side. What else could you possibly want other than this?
2) Veal Loin with Fava Beans, Angel Hair Pasta and Morel Mushroom Sauce - It was good, so good in fact. Pinkish thick-cut loins that you wish you had more of it on your plate. There are alcohol content in the mushroom sauce though, and it's pretty strong (or maybe it's my sensitive sense to alcohol). Not a very big fan of the Angel Hair Pasta but my friends loved it. 
3) Prime Angus Ribeye with Macaroni Gratin, Asparagus, Roquefort Cheese and Pinot Noir Sauce -- Tender meat that you place in your mouth, with the flavor from the sauce, you can't go wrong if you order this :)
4) Rack of Colorado Lamb with Curried Risotto & Goat Cheese, Ratatouille and Lamb Jus -- My friend loved this so much that she finished the whole plate even before I finished 3/4 of mine. Once you put a piece of Lamb in your mouth, it will burst with flavors. Which part of that sounds bad? None.

No meal is complete without desserts right?
Next up was Souffles -- Chocolate and Pistachio flavored.
Both was excellent. They pour the sauce at your table, after creating a hole right in the middle of the Souffles. The sides were a little crunchy while the middle part was soft, creamy and just awesome. Being a bigger fan of chocolate, there is no doubt that I chose that over pistachio. I just wished that there was a scoop of ice cream that could go along with it. 

At the end of our meal, we had a complimentary small-sized dessert and the plate was clean within minutes. 

There is no doubt that this restaurant is one of the best restaurant that I've ever been to. They showed their skills since everything was perfect. The price is on the higher end of the scale, so if you are not looking forward to see a big number on your check, I suggest that you shouldn't come to this place. However, you should indulge yourself if you are in Vegas to try at Andre's. You wouldn't regret your decision! :)",2ppwebXyFvKIHAz3f4N2Pg,3,1,5,Z8lsQJcrrZHu1THv5bIceQ

687108,2010-03-08,2,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My husband and I ate at Andre's last Thursday. We were at the Monte Carlo to celebrate his 30th birthday and to see Lance Burton's show. We had intended on going somewhere else for a drink and pre-show snack, but found that location to be too crowded and boisterous. After having walked passed Andre's probably three times that day without noticing it, we finally saw it. The bar looked quiet, welcoming, and elegant. We sat down for a drink and discovered the 2-for-1 martini special. My husband is not much of a martini fan, but I talked him into trying a Lemon Drop. The bartender mixed the smoothest, most delicious Lemon Drop either of us has ever had. The French Martini he made for me was also impeccable. I wish I had caught the bartender's name, as he was friendly, knowledgeable and warm, easily encompassing all the qualities of a fantastic bartender. After a bit of encouragement from him, my husband and I looked around the rest of the restaurant. What a sight! So beautifully decorated, inviting, elegant and comfortable all at once! When we expressed our regret at not having found Andre's sooner, the bartender let us know about the Theater menu. We immediately made reservations for after the show and looked forward to it throughout the evening. 

When we arrived for dinner after the show, we sat in the lower level room. I cannot get over the amazing color palate and attention to detail in the design of the room! The room is romantic, chic, and warm. The wait staff was just as friendly and welcoming as the bartender was. Our meal, also, was divine. I had the spicy crayfish bisque, which was buttery, rich, and velvety. My husband had the prix fix Theater menu with the Carpaccio, steak and chocolate soufflé. Everything was heavenly! It was the best meal we had while in town AND the best dining experience we have had in a very long time. I cannot say enough about the staff, the restaurant itself, and the food. I plan to tell everyone I know about this fantastic ""hidden"" gem and the amazing time we had there.

I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the ""scallops"" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the ""annex"" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!

This is our fourth time in Vegas and we were meeting our friends from halfway around the world so we decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner here. 

From researching online we saw that Andre's had great reviews as well it was located in the hotel we were staying at. 

Since our friends could not understand english we asked the waitress if she could be patient with us first and foremost and if she could slowly explain some of the dishes they were interested in. She gave us a weird look and then explained pretty quickly using ""food language"" that people weren't normally associated with hearing esp those still learning english. OKAYYY.... 

Anyways we ordered the

Lobster Bisque
Prime Angus Ribeye
Rack of Colorado Lamb
Celery Root & Truffle Risotto
and 1 Banana Caramel & 1 Chocolate Souffle

The presentation was amazing and the person bringing the food was super nice and informative. So really everything was great except our waitress. I expected better service from Andre's.

It's Michelin rated, the menu looked great and the location was perfect. After a few long days in Vegas, staying in the hotel on our last night was a great option. 

When you cross the casino floor to get to Andre's, you wonder if the noise from the party pit will be bothersome, that is, until the hostess opens the doors to the dining room. This was a really impressive room, it's dark and sexy in browns and blues with touches of purples and grays. High banquettes line one wall with tables around the room. We were seated in a banquette and conversations around us were so muted that if we didn't see the staff attending to other tables, we would have thought we were alone.  The room left us with quite the first impression. The music was great too, I think I knew every song, but I've been told I'm somewhat of a music savant.
 
Ross, our waiter told us that Chef Andre also owns Alize at the top of the Palms. He used to own a free standing restaurant, also called Andre's, downtown for almost 30 years, but that recently closed. The extensive, mostly French wine list and cocktail menu are presented on an ipad. I went with a Willy Nilly, how can a drink with that name be bad? It was delicious. Gramercy Guy had the Bloody O Cosmo, mine was better.  After determining that we'd both go fish, the sommelier helped us pick out a nice bottle of white.

Dinner started with an amuse bouche of frois gras in the shape of a club. For me, it was the perfect creaminess and gaminess that I like. Best part was it did get me excited for the meal to come, my bouche was amused.

The service was exceptional and the food was superb, our only problem was we had a late lunch and then our new friends from Seattle and Puxatony, PA brought us In-N-Out Burger which is my fast food kryptonite so we couldn't eat most of our dinner. Ross even asked politely if everything was ok with our meal and we told him about the late lunch. I'm not sure he believed us.

Enough people know about Andre's, so it can't be classified as a hidden gem, but I will tell you that I think it's a MUST.

Let's start with the ambiance. It was a little quiet in the beginning of the evening. So quiet that it almost felt awkward to speak with my party during dinner. The decoration of the restaurant itself was very nice though. It had a nice soothing feeling, honestly, almost reminiscent of being under the sea. I think it was the light blue green color against the creams and dark browns that gave that under the water vibe. Either way, it was a nice look. Too bad I didn't feel too comfortable talking to my dinner date about the place because we were concerned about disturbing the people around us. 

The food was ok. It didn't start out well, the bread was hard as a rock. Our shrimp cocktail appetizer only had a few shrimp on the platter but luckily they were jumbo shrimps! The Lobster bisque was rather excellent, it was probably one of the highlights of the meal. My main course was their chicken breast with a potato cake of some sorts. It was nothing that would leave a lasting impression. The creme brulee dessert was nice, however once again, a little disappointing. 

The part that really docks down the star rating from 3 to 2 would have to be the very poor service we received. It took us almost 3 hours to get through an appetizer, main course and dessert. I understand that a fine dinning experience can take a bit of time, but I would have to say that the 3 hours was a little ridiculous. We arrived for a 7:00 PM reservation and did not leave until 9:50 PM but we were ready to leave long before. There was just so much lag time between each of our courses that we constantly felt forgotten about. There were 2 other tables that were seated after us and were able to finish their meals and be on their way a good half hour before we even received our checks. In addition to dreadfully slow service, I felt like the manager was a little on the snippy side and didn't do a very good job of hiding her annoyance.when we informed her that we had a $100 gift certificate we would like to apply to the bill.",ydnVxzUbQyadw941ZewwyA,2,0,2,_YgajKJmnOFS6P6lH614WQ

I was in LV for CES and a co-worker and I decided on dinner at Andre's and figuratively stumbled onto the cigar bar.  

First - the meal: excellent service, delicious, if a bit pricey, food.  The environment is an oasis of calm in crazy LV.  The French onion soup and duck breast were about perfect.  Crème brulee was fabulous.  The wine list is great and includes some tasty wines at the low end of the spectrum (recommended: Tinto Negro Malbec at $55).  Of course if you are going to splurge you have some great choices there, too.  And the sommelier was friendly and helpful.

The big treat was the cigar bar upstairs.  Comfortable, cozy with the fireplace and tended by one of the great service-oriented bartenders.

I was a little surprised at Andre's location and was a bit shocked when I found out that it was there the whole time. Over the years, I've stayed at Monte Carlo over a handful of times but never really bothered to pay attention to their restaurants. Andre's is a small little restaurant tucked away into the front corner of the casino. If I remember correctly, it's almost directly across from ROK. 

Onto the food! Started off with the Pan-Seared Foie Gras and the Escargot de Bourgogne. The foie gras is on par with most of restaurants. Seared with a port reduction you get the best of both worlds: fat and alcohol. It's a good thing that most restaurants give you two to three credit card-sized slices of foie gras because any more of it could destroy your body! As I mentioned before, the foie gras was pretty good and a bit on the lean (less fat content) side. Very flavorful and worth the try. 

The escargot was surprisingly delicious. I suppose any seafood garnished and infused with spices topped off with a bath of melted butter makes any chewy sea creature taste that much more exquisite. I wish I had pictures to show, because the presentation of the entrees were delightful.

Onto the main entree. I had the Cervena Venison Loin that evening and it was simply awesome.  Normally, venison ends up being a little gamey in taste and a little dry (think of buffalo steak vs. prime rib), but the way Andre's prepared it is something to revel about. Tender, juicy, slightly red, garnished with delectable vegetables and other garnishes, and strategically placed next to a pool of jus/sauce...[beam of light shooting through clouds]... So with that said, I just have to say that you have to try it out for yourself. 

So in addition to the venison, I had the opportunity to sample several of my friends' dishes as well. The Prime Angus Ribeye and the Muscovy Duck Breast were equally as excellent that evening. As you can imagine, a medium rare ribeye is THAT good, and a duck breast topped off with a pomegranate sauce is also THAT impressive.

I would definitely return for a repeat visit and try their other entrees.",ap5-BuREhxfwV5nU1tDqMQ,1,0,4,gq8wdfqJlAnJVVT0GYOOUQ

Andre's was rated in the top ten, I believe at number one.  I felt I had to see what all the praise was about.  Let me tell you that I was not disappointed.

I made reservations for Saturday but then our plans changed.  Andre's called to confirm reservations and was very accommodating in making the change to Sunday for dinner.  We were promptly ushered in and seated in a beautiful booth fit for a king and queen.  The entire dining space is well decorated and nicely kept. 

The attention of the staff (Laurie and George) was impeccable.  They were attentive, patient in answering our questions and providing great service.  We decided to take advantage of a TravelZoo dinner special for two.  Our meals of spinach salad, lobster bisque, oven roasted salmon and roasted poussin (baby chicken) was absolutely delicious and served with perfection.

We have a table ready for you."" And sure enough, we were seated a table set for three. Little touches like this don't go unnoticed.

To get us started we received a amuse bouche a caviar creme palette cleanser. Breads followed, and we tacked on the wine pairing for $25. Reisling, Chardonnay, A French red with a name that escapes me and a dessert Reisling. 

Our first course was Roasted Corn Soup with Warm Crab Salad, Garlic Chips and Chive Oil a beautiful soup with delicate flavors.

Next, was Butter Lettuce Salad with Crispy Duck Confit, Toasted Almonds and Cherry Vinaigrette. Clean and crisp, with a hint of richness just to be naughty.

Seared Scottish Salmon with Spinach Gnocchi, Heirloom Tomato and Truffle Beurre Blanc and Grilled Rib Eye Cap with Anna Potato, Broccolini and Horseradish Beef Jus. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and nicely prepared.

We finished with Cocoa-Nut Marquise with a Banana-Lime Sabayon for dessert. This was a decadent dish without being overly sweet. Tartness from the lime helped to balance the flavors and the banana flavor added a playful element.

We started simply, ordering the foie gras, when the amous boush was sent out by the chef.  It was a potage with tumeric, chives and crispy ham to top.  And while bread and butter may seem simple, this was not the case at Andre's.  Our butter selection was a trio selection of sun-dried tomato, kalamata olive and simple sea salt.  The kalamata olive was out favorite, the flavor was creamy and salty with a hint of grape.  (I know what you are thinking, how can that be?  The magic of Andres.)
Our foie gras was the most amazing that we have ever had.  It was like Christmas IN your mouth.  A generous portion of pan seared foie atop a perfectly poached apple floating in a 5 spice creme anglaise with a port wine reduction that was to die for. (Or stab your partner's hand with the fork so I could eat it all.) Did I mention the skinless grape that was sliced so thin that, if portioned properly you has a slice of green grape with each bite of foie, apple and creme?
After this delight, we were brought our Summer Truffle Risotto.  Market Price.  Turns out for the amount of truffle that was shaved onto our mint risotto with duck comfit it was really inexpensive.  Creamy, balanced, earthy, (just enough) cheesy and so delicious.  I am very happy this was my first experience with black truffle.
The chef then sent out an intermezzo of grapefruit sorbet floating in a bit of soda water to cleanse our palates.
I had the free range chicken, which was cooked perfectly, juicy and tender
on a bed of corn and chile ragout.  It would seem to be a bit on the spicy side for someone unaccustomed to heat, though it was perfect for me.  The mole was delightful and full of flavor.",uonTu0KB7QYQXZZvMfiBFA,0,0,4,Z_AzgNxB9v2Mxt_tCT2pkw

I simply cannot express how utterly wonderful the restaurant was. I had not been to Andre's for several years, and it was the original location at that. In Las Vegas, it is quite easy to find good restaurants, and with the whole plethora of new dining options created almost over night, sometimes you forget the originals. Let me tell you, this is an original, and not only a good restaurant, but a great one! 

Everything from the service the moment you walk up, to the seating, and the remarkable attentiveness of the Staff, it was bar none exceptional. David, our host, was perfectly understated and executed. Ross, our waiter, knows how to work a room, and make it look effortless, his assistants were on top of the game. This was a day after Valentine's, a day when it would real easy to drop the ball, and go easy. Not these people! They made every aspect of our experience as close to perfect as possible. Our appetizer and entree's were prepared with careful thoughtfulness, you could tell. Again, if you have dined at some of the newer places, you know when someone is preparing your meal as a job, and one who does so with a passion. Andre's falls in the later, passionate and thoughtful. Oh, and the souffle' was amazing. Anyplace that asks you to order before dinner, you know they want to get it right, and this place does.

I have been to ALOT of restaurants here, and Andre's is just in a level that is very exclusive. You can find some hipper, trendier places, certainly, but there are reasons those places get ""good"" from me, and reasons Andre's is simply ""Great""",lr80Az12PUt_5V5cXHbPAw,0,0,5,l4MhMc2um9qZEo27gz7iYg
1059734,2013-11-24,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"I have had the opportunity to dine at Andre's twice in a few years and both occasions it deserved three stars. Today's event was no different. It started of with a lecture by the waiting staff that our TravelZoo coupons were not intended for our entire group, however, eventually it was all squared out and the waitress lightened up towards the end when she realized were a fun loving bunch. 

If I am not mistaken the place used to have or still has a Michelin star. In any case it definitely does not deserve one. I wouldn't say the food is bad but it's far from being singled out as a top standard. Let's face it the place is dated. Walls with ripped wallpaper, a sommelier who forgot who ordered the wine, and poorly timed service to name a few examples. I enjoyed the beef carpaccio even though the portion was on the small side. The lobster bisque was a bit on the fishy side and was not poured in front of you, something I always enjoy at a good place. The creme brulee was nicely done and excessively sweet and came with some fresh berries. 

I guess if this was a advertised as just a regular place I would give it four stars, but the hype around brought on some disappointment.",dBbmf0hGiRrlxSAUjvLOiQ,2,1,3,Q9w1LxSQ5GnWK8x9YVmiXg

This small French eatery is splashed in muted ocean tones; it boasts sea-foam blues and notes of sandy earth.  Lovely chandeliers hang overhead with skirts of crystal beads while relaxed instrumentals serenade the room in a hushed manner, much like the decor.


We had a very nice head waiter and his supporting crew were great too.  The service was attentive and efficient without being uncomfortable.  

The Ipads they use for cocktails and wine are utterly pointless, and seem to be there for the sake of show.  You cannot order from them, so they are nothing more than a gimmicky way to ornament the dining experience.  This contrasts the decor and overall vibe of Andre's, and is more of a distraction than a functional addition to dinner.  

While everything we ordered was delicious, I found only one exceptional dish:  

Braised Veal Cheeks - Done in a very classic manner, these delicate pieces of protein were braised in a rich red wine reduction, and served with polenta. The texture and flavor of the veal were both immaculate, and well balanced with the reduction.   I felt like I was biting into the essence of satin, a calm breeze, an afternoon nap, and meat.  It doesn't get any better than these veal cheeks

The lowest point was the amuse-bouche:

Vicchissoise w/ truffle cream - This little shot glass of disappointment tasted like chicken stock with a cream.  I tried very hard to appreciate the subtlety of this small bite, but just couldn't find anything of substance to embrace.

The cocktails are fantastic and there are tons of creative concoctions to choose from (Foie Gras in your drink anyone?)

While very good, I don't intend on returning to Andre's for anything besides the veal cheeks.  Those alone are worth the visit.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,2,1,4,TAIIcyOLXnXvl6moVfOdbA

Our table ordered 5 course tasting menu for 90 dollars. No choices for the 5 course was given.

The first course was the beef carpaccio. A little bland for my taste. One huge drawback was that the carpaccio was frozen on the plate. You had to basically let it warm up a little for the carpaccio to defrost. This is where my table ran into a problem and when the waitress offered us truffle on the carpaccio. As stated in the menu, truffle was an ingredient part of the dish. However, when we got the check we were charged an additional 10 dollars each for the truffle topping. The waitress failed to mention that the truffle was 10 dollars additional and at the end insisted she did. Especially since it was mentioned in the menu without an additional charge, we mentioned it to the manager. The manager stated that something like this at this ""upscale"" restaurant always has attached fees as if our table should have assumed the truffle was additional. The manager was haughty but removed the charge of the truffle from the check not without an attitude about it.

So going back to reviewing just the food. The seared scallops were great. perfectly cooked and seasoned. This was my favorite course. It was also beautiful to look at. So much so you didnt want to eat it.
Ox tail cannelloni. This was decent. The rest of the table enjoyed it much more than I did. This reminded me of a gourmet version of a beef tacquito. 
dessert- chocolate souffle, though I was stuffed at this point it was delicious with pineapples on the bottom.
gelato with panna cotta, decent but forgettable.

Overall I gave this restaurant only 3 stars because of the service and the problem and the attitude we encountered. The food was decent, but I would not return.",_8kJVryWqCrbZVGr4ftUgg,0,0,3,i3U-up3yXOdhpzH5QbLRmA

It was my first time at a Michelin Starred Restaurant and it did not disappoint. Service was superb, they even replaced your napkin when you went to the bathroom. 

Most of my friends had the 7-course tasting menu, in order to sample the foie gras. They had a five course tasting menu, minus the foie gras. I guess that's how they get you. The sauce the came with the foie gras was on the sweeter sauce, but complemented it well. Definitely, a dish I would order again. 

Surprisingly, the winner of the night was the duck breast, which I ended up ditching in favor of a Saffron Risotto. Big props to my friends for letting me sample some of theirs. Normally, I'm not a big fan of duck; Andre's knew how to cook it to perfection. A+.

 We were greeted professionally and politely. Treated like VIPs and were taken to the whiskey/cigar area. We had the room to ourselves, which was nice.
 The sommelier was a real professional. Very knowledgeable about what he was serving and was an excellent touch to the establishment. They are lucky to have him. 
 He suggested some excellent choices and gave us samples so that we can know what we were getting into before we made a selection.
 Unfortunately, during our time there, 2 of the dudes in our team starting having some heated words together.  He provided some input, politely, about how to handle such situations and was very classy and respectful about it. 
Later on, showing even more respect, he apologized for having an opinion on the matter. We didnt mind, because he did it with such smooth finesse that it was necessary he did what he did. 
 We had a toast and I gave a small speech about the bachelor.

There is a dress code, but I noticed a family walk in with jeans an a sweater but they still sat them anyway.  Pretty good service, but you expect that at a place like this.  In my opinion though, it felt a little overbearing.  I couldn't figure out who exactly was our server.  There was a different person for each task; wine order, food order, drink order..a different person who brought us water, our food, dessert, etc.

As far as the food, incredible.  As an appetizer, I got the Lobster Bisque soup.  It was smooth and sweet, perfect!  For the entree, I got the vegetable medley and my husband got the Duck.  Both very delicious dishes, I had nothing bad to say about either one.  Nothing felt like it was undercooked or overcooked.  For dessert, I got the Banana Foster Souffle.  It was my first time ever having a souffle, and as far as souffles go, the bar is set pretty high.

I had the roma tomato and watercress salad, a bit under-seasoned, but it was a pretty presentation with the tomatoes sliced paper thin and arranged in a round platform for the watercress to sit upon. The hubby had the french onion soup which was delicious but over-seasoned...he wanted to dip the baguette slices in it like a sauce. 
There was a drop of pineapple sorbet in a thimble of sparkling water that was tart and refreshing even though it really is a tiny thimble...
The hubby ordered the spring chicken breast on a bed of jasmine rice with mushrooms in a cream sauce. He really enjoyed it, and being an ardent advocate for dark meat, that's saying a lot. I ordered the ribeye with a potato lasagna (looked like lasagna with white sauce but tasted like scalloped potato). The ribeye was the best I've EVER had, a little crispy around the edges without being hard, and yet so tender and flavorful that my heart broke a little when I ate the last bite... 
Dessert was a frothy chocolate affair that was dark and bitter, but went so well with the two dollops of smoked cream on the side, and the crunchy waffle-pattern slice of glaze sweetened the chocolate rather well too. The hubby said all three glasses of wine he had went really well with the dishes he was served with, and you'll just have to take his word for it.",APoNFkpWx0HkQN2lcGXOEQ,0,0,5,OnJtRpXhLDXQWeLTiGrOqQ
1881937,2012-08-05,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"I was blown away by the food and service I received at andres.  I went back home and recommended it to everyone!  Because it, like everything else in vegas, is located at the edge of the casino, they find a way to create a  nice, quiet, and romantic atmosphere.  The bar is located behind the hosts stand only a few feet.away from the casino.  The host/hostess will, take you past the bar, and down a short hallway where he/she will open these two huge doors and take u into the main dining area.  When the doors close all the outside nose becomes muted, and you hear the nice contemporary music.  

It is small, but cozy.  The maitre d welcomed us and explained the menu to us.  While gee did that, the waiters moved quickly and quietly to place our napkins, pour the water, and remove the design plates.  They worked so fast and quietly, I barely noticed them working and was able to focus on the menu.  

We start off with the amuse bouche of cold creamy carrot soup with ginger whipped cream.  I want feeling well at first, so I didn't war much of it (even though it was small), but for the little I did eat, it was phenomenal!  The ginger infused whooped cream was soothing and went well and very smoothly with the pureed carrots.  

I then ordered the lobster and corn bisque for my starter.  When the waiter put the bowl in front if me, it had the silver plate cover on it.  When he removed it, I felt like the made a mistake.  In the bowl, I saw a pile if shredded meat, and three tiny pancake things around the shredded meat.  The waiter then pointed to the meat and said: "" this is the lobster, and these (pointing to the pancakes) are corn pancakes.""  He then brought a silver gravy boat to my attention in front and said "" this is the bisque.""  And he poured it in the bowl.  My first reaction to this dish must have been a classic expression because the people I went with started laughing at me.  This bisque was so good!  so creamy!. It had the perfect blend of lobster and corn!  So if anyone orders this, expect it to arrive a lot.differently than you think.  And I loved that table side service.  

We then had a palate cleanser.  It was a pinapple mint sorbet.  That was just a  mouthful of sorbet, but that mouthful did just what it was supposed to.  It was not tatty like normal pineapples, and the mint was not overwhelming like how mint can be.

Following that, or entrees came.  I wanted to order something more basic because some of the most basic items are the things the chefs have the hardest time doing, so I ordered the filet minon.  I have to say, Andres is the *first* place I have been to that can cook a piece of beef so perfectly!  I like my meat done medium and they had a nice searing on the outside, and the inside was a consistent pink finish on the inside.  Full of flavor!  The sauce it comes with had a nice cheesy, creamy.taste to it which matched well with the filet minon, but with meat done that well, who needs the sauce to cover up perfect seasoning?!

We didn't order dessert there, but they gave us complimentary  chocolates instead.  

The service was so amazing and its an experience everyone should go through.  The food was soo delicious!  I would advise allowing at least two hours to east there.  Like typical fine dining restaurants, you expect great food and service, they in turn expect you to have a memorable dining experience so nothing is to be expected in a rush.

I tell you, I'd be a happy man if you would take me to a place where I could enjoy some seared foie while yelling PAI GOWWWW at some topless dealer.  But until then any french restaurant in Vegas will have to do.

Tried the 7 course tasting menu for $115.  Unfortunately, the seared foie here was overwhelmed by the sweetness of the caramelized apple and creme and port reduction.  The lobster sausage wasn't interesting and reminded us of the chinatown fish cakes.  The veal cheek was the highlight of the meal as well as the souffle dessert.  Duck wasn't bad either.

They do make a tasty Manhattan though.  My friend had the foie martini which was more like a foie shake...tasty at first and worth a try if you like foie but you really need to down this and not sip it as it doesn't sit well.

Service was exemplary and thanks for replacing my bread bucket a couple times while I made excuses about carbing up before the RnR marathon. 

Not the hippest place on the strip, but nice, elegant, old school feel dining area and cigar room upstairs.  Definitely an OK place...I'd come back maybe for an entree or something, but hey, just go with the flow in Vegas.",Mln71x70ZKNA7EDxtK9EpQ,5,5,3,JI6QzNqMMdQjS-5z3aPeWw
1912598,2009-04-23,2,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Highly overlooked restaurant and horribly located at the Monte Carlo. 

Andre's has been on my radar for about 4 years now, but I never made it over to MC or to the now closed Downtown location. Some of it was due in part to a lackluster experience at Alize, another Andre venture. 

I'm excited and happy to say that the experience we had this past trip made me grin and giddy inside. 

As always, I went online and scoured the website's menu. From past research I knew Andre's offered an off-menu Tasting Menu, any number of courses, basically whatever you can dream up, the Chef will make it happen. 

A week prior to the trip I emailed Andre's and mentioned the 'must haves' for the evening: 
-Vitello Tonnato, thinly sliced veal loin, albacore tuna, parmesan cheese, very interesting, unexpected flavor of anchovy. 
-Blackened Bison Carpaccio, parmesan basket, pickled crimini mushrooms, arugula pesto, the mound of pesto worked perfectly with the bison and I especially enjoyed the puff pastry textural contrast. 
-Pan-Seared Cold Water Sablefish, miso glaze, caramelized endive, black forbidden rice, basil infused olive oil, learned that this fish is a notch above black cod, beautiful fish and lightly scented with the miso glaze. Superb dish. 
-Maine Lobster Thermidor, white Mushrooms, tarragon dijon mustard cream sauce, a Andre classic, big thumbs down for me, but the bf enjoyed it, really heavy, the lobster would have been great without being smothered in the creamy mess. 
-Fig Stuffed Quail, prosciutto wrapped, Roquefort risotto, vincotto, excellent representation of the bird. Perfectly cooked. 
-Braised Veal Ossobuco Comesquis, risotto milanese, gremolata crust, natural jus, so comforting, robust flavors, but at the same time refined. 
-Pan Seared Cervana Venison, green asparagus, fingerling potatoes, pomegranate reduction, what a hunk of meat, luscious and delicious to my lips. 

The rest was at the leisure and discretion of Chef Greg: 
-Golden Ossetra Caviar,traditional accompaniments, we were offered the last 2 ounces in the restaurant, we went with an ounce, could have EASILY consumed two. Deliciously satisfying, a FANTASTIC way to start a meal. 
-Chilled Australian Lobster, mango wrapped tail, curried creme fraiche, papaya-serrano pepper salad, from the description on the general menu, I was expecting a dull cold shell-on lobster claw, but the presentation was gorgeous, petite and decidedly unique in flavor profiles. Chef makes his own 'fruit roll-up' to wrap around the lobster. One of the favorites for the evening. 
-Pan-Seared Foie Gras, caramelized apple, five-spice creme anglaise, port wine reduction, the lightest representation of foie, the richness was expertly cut w/a well thought out contrasting ingredients. 
-Free-Range Chicken 
Seared foie gras, tomato, cauliflower croquette, roasted chicken jus, OMG, BEST chicken EVER. I never would have picked this, b/c I try to stay away from chicken in restos, but this was so flavorful, so juicy, I wanted to save some in my cheeks for later. 

Desserts: There was a trio, which I don't remember, but captured by a photo and a lovely vanilla/choc souffle, perfect sugar dusted crust. 

The Sommelier is Italian and quite gregarious in nature. Thoroughly enjoyed all his selections to pair with our 14-course journey. Warning for the lightweights: pours are GENEROUS. 

All the elements Chef Greg lovingly prepared on each dish worked harmoniously together. Wonderful sauces graced each dish and married well with the centerpiece of the course. Old favorites that are staples of fine dining were presented in ways that were innovative. Chef Greg brings a youthful vibrancy to French food in LV. His passion was evident during his numerous visits to see how we were enjoying the meal and at the end of the meal he sat down at our booth to shoot the breeze for a good ten minutes. Make time for this meal, it took us FOUR hours. 

Extras: Menu is printed with the name of the guest who made the reservation. Love to have a reference point during the evening. Got a tour of the kitchen and met Chef Greg's newest recruit from Nobu LV. 

With a gorgeous remodelled interior, the established resto has taken a new culinary vision and is better for it!!!

The service was good. The server was friendly. However, when I told him I didn't like my cocktail, he said ""well, now you know you don't like it for next time.""  He could have at least pretended that he cared.  Btw, it was the foie gras martini, which I thought I would love since I love foie gras, but like many items in this restaurant, it was too sweet.  The accompaniments they bring with the martini are fun though (caramelized pears, berries, banana ice cream). 

I ordered the lobster bisque, the seared foie gras, the scallops, and the rack of lamb. The lobster bisque was pretty good but I could have done without the corn infusion. The seared foie was cooked perfectly, but I agree with another reviewer that it was overpowered by the sweet sauce drenched on the plate. The scallops were very good and cooked perfectly. Probably one of my highlights. The lamb was also cooked very well, but again I didn't like the particular sauce they used, so I had to move the lamb onto another plate.  I probably seemed very ""high-maintenance"" to the server, but I never ever have a complaint or accommodation at the other Michelins I've been to b/c things are usually prepared to perfection. Here, not as much. However, if you like your dishes sweet, this might be the place for you.

I have to say everything was divine and I hope to come back soon.",j6aQNkPkbcgHETYmaDKWng,0,0,5,_705H7kpXlX4zBbw15BZHQ
2111113,2014-01-01,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My fiancé and I were just in Vegas and ate here twice.  I will start from the beginning and say that the customer service was bar-none.  We were seated promptly and our server came to take our order right away.  We had gone there on a Travelzoo voucher, but intended to go for a five course tasting menu too.  After learning that the prix fixe menu was largely featured on the tasting menu, we wanted to change some of our order.  They actually let us, despite the fact that they had already started making some of our courses.  They bent over backwards to give us out of this world service!  

We got a delicious amuse bouche, the ingredients of which I can't quite recall, but I can say that it was a red soup with white fish in it.  While my vegetarian fiancé got the same, they were kind enough to take hers back and make a special amuse bouche just for her, a pea asparagus gazpacho.  She typically does not like asparagus, so it was surprising that she quite enjoyed it.  Of course, the purpose of an amuse bouche is to highlight the chef's palate, so we had high expectations as to what was to come next.  We were not disappointed.   

For my first course, I had a lobster corn bisque while she had a house salad.  She is usually disappointed by house salads, but this one was expertly done, crisp and flavourful.  I savoured every bite of my bisque.  For the mains, I had an potato crusted sea bass, while she had the the butternut squash risotto.  Again, risotto is not one of her favourites but the worst part of the dish for us both, I suspect was putting down the fork.  The bass was flavourful and had an excellent mouthfeel.  My palate was tantalized with each bite I tok.  My beau was in culinary heaven herself.  For dessert we had creme brûlée and a banana soufflé.  Both of these were delicacies.  The brûlée was perfectly torched and the soufflé could not have had a better rise.  At the end, the chef had a special surprise which is best left for the reader to discover on their own.  

When we went back for the five course tasting menu with wine pairings, we both had the pea asparagus gazpacho as our amuse bouche, and I got to see just how delicious my fiancee's previous amuse was.  I had the beef carpaccio this time, which was expertly sliced and seasoned.  I added white truffle shavings to it for an extra $15, (white truffles are NOT cheap,) and my mind was completely blown.  She had the chilled fennel and carrot soup with a marinated apple salad.  She loved it.  She had a vegetarian thermidor, a lobster thermidor without the lobster, and was astounded.  I had the seared scallop and felt no differently about my dish.  The wine pairing was fantastic, as it was throughout our meal.  We had an expert sommelier who was willing to take the time to give us a bit of an education on the wines we were having and why.  All of the food, by the way, was as beautiful to look at as it was to eat.  Our next course braised beef cheek for me and chestnut crusted tofu for her.  Every detail made the dishes shine, even the polenta frites, essentially french fries were to die for!  Next up was a pan seared duck breast served with jicama and duck confit.  I marvelled in the culinary prowess of the French, as did my fiancé with her butternut squash risotto, though she had had it once already.  Our dessert was a flour less chocolate cake paired with a Napa Valley late harvest chocolate wine.  The cake danced on our tongues all on its own, but with the wine it was like upping the tempo to a staccato.  I cannot over-recommend this place.  The food and service are just stellar.  If you are in Vegas and have a few hundred bucks to burn, burn it where they won't burn your food, but burn into your memory instead.

And I don't, Andre's. Because of you, I do not!

High prices and small portions is pretty much how I would sum up all the French restaurants I have been in, so the quality of the food have much greater stakes than anything else I have ever eaten.

It definitely feels a little pretentious, but I came in with my leggings and t-shirt (I'm on vacation dammit!) and was treated with as much respect as all the suits and dresses coming in through the door.

First and foremost, Foie Gras. It is illegal in California (the real question should be, what isn't?), I completely believe that there are overindulgent poultry so don't hate me for loving its overindulgence. It was ordered in addition to our prix-fixe. It's heavy flavor was perfectly complimented by the cinnamon apple reduction drizzled expertly to build its flavors slowly. Perfect, melt in your mouth experience.

Now, I can go on forever about how great our service was and how everything we had was delicious. Ridiculously delicious. And to top it off, I was full. I had to contemplate how to walk out of the place gracefully because I loved everything and almost licked the plates clean, so I was feeling like a tub. But, you really need to come and see this for yourself.

There was, however, one thing I didn't particularly find captivating and it was the truffle emulsion seabass. The fish was on the bland side and the asparagus felt foreign the the dish.

Andre's holds a well-deserved Michelin star.

2251049,2016-10-21,3,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"I treated my sister to dinner here. And yes, I am the queen of frugality, but I'll make an exception for Andre's (and i was armed with a $100 gift check from Open Table!)

To be honest, I am not a Vegas kind of person. I dont care for large scenes (even though I'm a NYC girl), I dont get wowed easily, flashy lights and a water show in a desert just annoy me rather than delight me. The constant cigarette smoke was getting on my nerves and I just needed to treat myself and get the heck out of Vegas and into my car to drive off to the mountains! 

What did I do to treat myself? I booked a table at Andres! We LOVED the private dining scene where the front of the restaurant is only some silly facade for you to get a drink at and the real dining is behind closed doors. 

There was only one other table dining with us that night and it looked like they were celebrating a quiet and fun wedding. Privacy means a lot to me. 

We ordered tons and tons of food. To be perfectly honest, the food is just alright. As I will repeat, I am a NYC snob, and my expectations for food are pretty darned high. With the exception of the snails, everything else wasnt very memorable. We also ordered the french onion soup, duck, french fries (which were those nasty french styled shoe string kinds... i like 'em thick!) and a few other plates that i cant remember for the life of me. Nothing was wrong or bad or yucky with anything that stands out as negative, however there wasnt terribly much that stood out as amazing, positive or show-stopping.

2261666,2010-12-26,2,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My 100th review! Glad it could be something special. And it's gonna be a long one. :)

For my birthday dinner, I chose Andre's based on the good reviews from this site. Also because it was one of the few fine dining restaurants open in the dead zone that is the few days before Christmas.

I'm all about tasting menus and I wasn't sure from the website if they had one, but they do.  Yay!  Five courses for $95 and seven courses for $125.  They also have a wine pairing - the sommelier wine pairing is $90 for the five course tasting menu and $115 for the seven course tasting menu.  

The staff was fine with my husband getting the 5-course menu and with me getting the 7-course menu, which was nice.

The amuse bouche was a small, two bite cup of cold carrot soup.  Good, but nothing to rave about.  They also served warm French bread with three flavors of butter: tomato, regular, and olive.  The tomato butter was terrific, much to my surprise, and I think this is a great idea instead of bringing out of ton of different types of bread.  Just put the flavor in the butter!

First course was caviar with crème fraiche and asparagus granite (asparagus flavored ice).  Served with tiny cumin flavored pancakes (there is a French word for these but I can't recall it).  It was paired with a sparkling rosè.  This was surprisingly tasty! The asparagus ice had a nice flavor to it.

Second course was beef tongue salad with golden beets and a crepe stuffed with lentils all covered in a Dijon mustard sauce.  It was paired with a viognier.  Decent - the wine pairing was good but not my favorite course.  A little bland.

Third course was seared foie gras with apples and a crème anglaise paired with an ice wine.  This course was so yummy!  Typically crème anglaise is served on desserts but it went so well with the foie gras and gave it a great caramel flavor.

Before the fourth course, we got a palate cleanser of mango sorbet in sparkling water and mint oil.  Not bad but the mint was pretty overpowering.  We got the next wine pairing but didn't dare sip it until we got some more food in our mouths.  Wine and mint = bad.

Fourth course was pork belly with truffles served over a custard with a truffle jus.  It was paired with a sangiovese.  The chef personally came by to shave the truffles, which was cool.  This dish was extremely tasty.  Just the right amount of truffle and paired well with the sangiovese.

Fifth course was roast goose with crisp brussel sprout leaves and pistachios paired with a red blend.  The inside was tender but the outside was kind of chewy.  

Sixth course was Boucheron cheese, a goat's milk cheese, with candied hazelnut and cinnamon honey paired with a late harvest zinfandel.  The candied hazelnuts went perfect with the cheese.

The final course was a chocolate crisp with raspberries paired with a port.  This was ok.  I like the crispiness of the dessert but I'm not a big fan of chocolate desserts.

At the end of the meal, they brought out little candies - chocolate with peanut butter, chocolate with mint, some coconut thing I wouldn't touch (I hate coconut), more chocolate crisp, and a couple of tiny muffins/cookies.  They wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate in chocolate and put a lit candle in a strawberry, which was nice.

We ordered some tea but that came out after we finished the tiny desserts.  They serve Stash teas, which is alright, but nothing special.  The lemon ginger tea we had was good with honey and lemon.  

The staff is not stuffy at all.  They came by a lot to chat and joke around with us, which was fun.  The chef came by another time to chat and see how we were enjoying the meal.  It's definitely a good restaurant for those that are uncomfortable with extremely formal, deferential service where the servers keep their distance.  

Everything is served with a silver dome on top. Even if it doesn't fit on the plate, the servers will just kind of hold it over the dish until everyone is served and they are ready for the big reveal.  Pretty funny and very old school. 

The first course took a while to come out, even after we got our wine pairing.  But service was better timed after that.  They were also a little slow with the check as we had long finished our tea and desserts before it came.  

The restrooms are up a fairly long flight of stairs but there is an elevator.  There is also a lounge upstairs which would be nice to check out on a future visit.  It was completely empty when we went.  

All in all a good experience. The servers and food were both great, but only a few dishes stood out.  With special meals like these, I expect everything to be mind-blowingly tasty.  High expectations, I know.  But I'm definitely a fan so four stars it is!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,4,4,4,5m5TybnX3wdEIv5sqtUQyg

2280944,2013-03-27,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My hubby and I decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary at Andre's after reading a great amount of rave reviews about this restaurant. What also had us interested was the fact that this restaurant received the AAA 4 Diamond award, had been recognized by the Michelin Guide with one star rating, and is nominated as Las Vegas' ""Most Romantic Restaurant""; perfect way to celebrate your wedding anniversary? We thought it would be. Guess we thought wrong. Maybe the problem was that we used a Travel Zoo offer? We honestly didn't think using a Travel Zoo offer would have caused such a bad experience as these offers are solicited to Travel Zoo by the vendors on there and not the other way around. So in that retrospect, we didn't think that by showing up and using a Travel Zoo voucher, we would be treated as if we had the plague.  Our suggestion to Andre's is that if you don't want your customers using a Travel Zoo voucher, please stop asking Travel Zoo to post them...problem solved.  

We by no means, have any complaints about the taste of the food, rather we are disappointed in the way they were presented to us.  When you are first seated, they will give you the ""Special"" Travel Zoo menu for you to choose off of. Initially, that didn't seem like a problem until later when our food started to arrive. More on that later. So my hubby ordered the french onion soup with Swiss emmental and Gruyere au gratin to start and I had the lobster and corn bisque with sweet corn cake.  The taste of both were good, not awesomely mind blowing, but good. The lobster bisque could have incorporated more bits of lobster in it as it lacked in flavor. But other than that, both soups were seasoned well and arrived hot.  This is where we started to notice that we were ""different"".  When looking over at the table across from us, my hubby noticed that unlike myself, their lobster bisque was poured into their soup bowl table side by our waiter.  They all ordered from the tasting menu as well so it was kind of awkward that we had not received the same service. We shrugged it off and awaited our next course to arrive. Aside from our set Travel Zoo menu, we decided to order the pan-seared duck foie gras. The foie gras was smooth, delicate, and full of flavor. The poached pears that accompanied it, complimented well and the mixture of sweet and savory danced harmoniously in our mouths. Each bite was heavenly and to die for. The foie gras was the highlight of our meal. Encouraged by this,  we looked forward to our next course. But to our disappointment, yet another issue arises and replaced all of the divine flavors we just had in our mouths with a bitter taste. For some reason, we were not offered the palate cleanser (pineapple sorbet) before our next course, unlike the table across from us. At this point, we really started to get irritated with the discriminative service we were receiving from our waiter. So on to the second course.  My hubby ordered the Hoisin-glazed duck breast with butternut squash semolina, almonds, currants and duck leg cannelloni and I ate the Scottish salmon with saffron and shellfish emulsion and lobster ravioli.  Both entrees were delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed them.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle and 
banana ice cream profiteroles with warm chocolate sauce. We enjoyed them both but liked the chocolate souffle over the profiteroles as the banana ice cream tasted more of vanilla than banana's. The chocolate souffle arrived in perfect form and was very delicious. 

The service at Andre's, if using a Travel Zoo voucher (it seemed) is one to be less desired of.  They do a good job of reminding you, that you are a lesser paying customer from the others. From the time you check in with the hostess, she asks you to present to her your Travel Zoo voucher. Then when seated, your waiter just rubs that in as well. We noticed that the other table that were being serviced by our waiter was get exceptional service while he left us out in the dark and only came by when he needed to. Our server assistants on the other hand, did a tremendous job and we were impressed and thankful for their service. They treated us well and made us feel the way a customer should feel.  Our waiter brought a complimentary medley of truffles for our anniversary and basically just dropped it off. No anniversary well wishes or anything.  However, our server assistant noticed the truffles and congratulated us along with making some small chat as well. We thought he deserved to be a waiter over ours. As a side note, we did not complain or do anything to deserve the service we did that night. We just smiled and acted cordially despite the short comings of the service. At no given time were we rude, thus, we expected to be treated the same way in return.  Will we ever return, probably not. We were planning to without a Travel Zoo offer, if this didn't happen.",bYLXrYkURZPDD5Ct3__B2w,13,0,2,oi_jOMICCqHuw33m9qK2mg

Stellar wine pairings heightened our gastronomic adventure and i swear the knowledge that came out of these ninjas mouths made me feel like i went to France and back in one sitting.

Cousin and I flew to Vegas from California, the foie-gras-less state, excluding the Federal regulated areas. Since one of my traveling policies is to try things I can't have at home, this was on top of our list.

And then there was Chef Andre Rochat's namesake restaurant whose menu has not one but two foie gras dishes. Pardon my inexperienced palette, this would only count as my second try of this now California-banned delicacy. As my cousin and I's first go was a seared foie gras with apple (this in a SF neighborhood French restaurant prior to the ban), we opted for the Andre's chilled interpretation of how this slice of fat must be served.

Drum roll please.

Before the appetizers of escargot and foie gras arrived, we were given something with caviar and some bread. That bread was fantastic.

On to the Foie Gras: I liked it, but we couldn't finish it, and we were two sharing one order. Lesson learned, our inexperienced palettes might have been happier with the pan-seared version than the pate we had. Nothing against the dish itself but just a matter of preference when consuming this kind of fat. The pate foie gras went well with the raspberry paste.

As for the escargot, my cousin thought it was too garlicky, I thought it was fine. Oil was good for dipping bread and I think I made myself full from doing that.

Main course. My cousin had the stuffed duck while I ordered the ribeye, medium rare. It was perfect. I didn't care for the stinky cheese they put a small amount of on top, but that's just me. Other than that, I was in meat heaven. Too bad we were in a rush to see Jabbawockeez so we had little time to enjoy the entire meal. I hope we didn't seem impolite by asking them to fire everything asap. The ribeye steak was awesome, don't get me wrong, but for the time crunch of eating, maybe I should have ordered the lobster which is easier to scarf down while trying to be all ladylike and poised.

And the other regret is not being able to order their souffle of the day. Le Sigh!

The disappointing thing about the whole Andre Rochat experience was the ambience of the place. It seemed dead and lackluster. But tell you what? The service more than made up for it. Firstly, we had reservations for 7:45PM but were running late. I called them at 7:40PM and asked if they could hold it for 10 minutes. They were very accommodating. Secondly, they didn't give us attitude for being asked to take our pictures (some restaurant staff are like that but not here!) And when they checked up on us it wasn't too frequent (I hate it when they're overly attentive - I want my fine dining meals relaxing and I don't want to feel like they just won't leave you alone) which is wonderful.

**On the Restaurant Week Menu only**
It was the last day of the Las Vegas Restaurant week but the event prix fixe menu didn't seem to be proportionate to the restaurant's current tasting menu so I didn't do that. You don't get to choose your appetizer or soup, you only get three choices for the main entree. I know there is a gap between how much they cost, but isn't that part of the restaurant week challenge to showcase what the restaurant has to offer at a more enticing price? I said nay to the one chicken, two fish trio offered as main courses, aside from not having an option for the appetizers.",1DiDNvfbL4Os1C3UOYalHA,1,1,4,pT8nlm2BqI-2WHVnio2mjg

I took my girlfriend here on a Saturday night for dinner before our show. The pan-seared foie gras is as excellent as what the other reviewers have said; the Colorado lamb is the best that both my girlfriend and I have ever had; and the Maine lobster thermidor is an inspiration.

According to our server, Andre has been making two signature dishes for over 33 years: the lobster, and the sole. Being a big lobster fan I had to go for it. It's lobster meat taken from the lobster, cooked in a cognac sauce with mushroom, and placed back onto the lobster tail for serving. Obviously, I found it extremely delicious, but I was also very pleased with the portion as there was a LOT of it.

The lamb wasn't as inventive but also very impressive in taste. It was cooked just perfectly and arrived with two different sauces, both delectable. They really complemented the meat and made it fun to eat.

Our server was very helpful and attentive. He learned early on that we were running short on time and had just an hour before our show. He let the chef know, and at the end of the meal helped us get out quickly. I was a little sorry to have to do this because you go to a quiet and elegant place like Andre's to enjoy the ambiance along with the food. I normally would stay to chat and just take advantage of the setting, but it wasn't possible this time. But I know for sure Andre's left us wanting to try more, like the souffle or the sole.

When we were escorted through the doors, it was so lovely.  The dining room was not too big and it had a wonderful ambiance.  Staff greeted us promptly and told us about the menu and some of their signature dishes.
Amuse Bouche:  Wonderful little bite from the chef.  It was a terrine of duck atop a thin crouton with what I believe was a light basil sauce.  Never had a pate-esque food before and we were happy to have loved it!
Apps:  We ordered the tomato and stone fruit salad with burrata.  It was delicious.  The combination of the acidic tomato, sweet peach, creamy cheese and vinaigrette was fantastic.
Main course:  I ordered the pappardelle pasta with chicken, artichoke, and cherry tomato.  It was delicious!  The pasta texture was perfect, the light sauce made from the braised chicken was flavorful.  Loved it!  My husband ordered the duck breast with fava bean puree and pomegranate sauce.  WOW!  Delicious as well!  Meat was cooked perfectly and the sweet, tart pom sauce went so well with the richness of the duck.
Dessert:  We both ordered the chocolate soufflé.  Here is where it got sad.  Not because of the food, but because I became light headed and unwell and had to leave the restaurant...remnants of an illness from the days prior, certainly not from Andre's food.

My husband also ordered the foie gras martini, and OMG it was amazing!  Of course you'll have to like foie gras in the first place, but even I liked it!  Normally i can't stand more than just a taste of foie gras.  The chef actually comes out and pours the martini for you and even grates white truffles on top of it at your table.

I resisted getting dessert after all that food...and then they brought out a little tray of small chocolates and nuts...again, on the house.  it was just what i needed w/o stuffing a slice of cake into my already bursting gullet.  wow...

Still, the best part had to be the service.  

I absolutely disdain going to a nice restaurant and having to track the waiter down, or even worse, the waiter making me feel like he's doing me a favor by serving me in the first place.  I strongly believe that the whole point of a nice restaurant should be the service.  

Andre's did not disappoint one bit.  They were polite, timely, and extremely friendly.  I would give them 10 stars for their services and manners if i could.

All in all, don't miss this place if you're looking to have a nice meal that's actually worth it.",RXuyk6vbUrdghqEhma_n8w,4,3,5,uIPD5H6UncsJd6oEwDvYsQ

After knowing about it for a year or so, I finally made it down to Andres to check out the cigar lounge. It's upstairs, it's cozy (15-20 people or so would be about the max I think), it's quiet, one big screen and nice comfy furniture.

I was shown upstairs, got a seat, and within a few minutes I was being waited on. I had brought my own cigars to smoke, but I did have several drinks. One of their special drinks and some regular cocktails. For Vegas standards, I'd say the drinks were maybe even a little better than usual for the money.

I stayed for a couple of hours or so. Watched the Sunday night football game, and even had some lobster corn bisque, which was really good.

Seared Foie Gras-Just right

Lobster thermador-Heavy in a perfect and delectable way.

Venison-Perfect!

Vegetables-Cooked perfectly. One of the only times I would actually want more.

Pinot Noir- Nice selection chosen by the sommelier. Went well with everything.

Souffle-This is the only thing I had a slight problem with. Instead of going with a classic chocolate or Grand Marnier, we opted for the white chocolate with mixed berry souffle. Although unique, I don't think it worked too well. I am no authority on souffles but in my opinion ion it was too mushy inside, the consistency of oatmeal.

Suck it up and wade through the casino floor of the Monte Carlo, repeating your own private mantra, ""I will soon be transported to culinary nirvana. I will soon be transported to culinary nirvana. I will soon be transported to culinary nirvana."" Once you see the double doors and step through, you've truly arrived. Not just arrived, but Arrived. 

Ushered to a lovely, quiet table, your experience begins. We were partnered with Lori (with a long-forgotten e) and she truly made the experience memorable. She was professional, courteous, personable, and yet, brutally honest (why would someone order salmon or tilapia? This was one of the tableside discussions, and it was hilarious). After deciding on a nice bottle of Montrachet, we placed our orders.

First, the Escargots de Bourgogne (imported french snails, garlic-butter and herbs). The escargot arrived sizzling hot to the table and the server was nice enough to slide the bread basket over to my place, as he knew I would need a whole lot of bread to sop up the delicious, herb-laden buttery sauce. My biggest issue was in letting the plate cool a bit in order not to burn the heck out of my mouth. Anticipation - argh! Once the snails had cooled just a little, I dug in - delicious. Great herb combo and just enough garlic to make things interesting. I could have filled up on escargot and bread, but forced myself to moderate so that I could enjoy the rest of the meal. My tablemates ordered Pan Seared Duck Foie Gras with pistachio beignet, peach compote, black currant reduction (luscious!) and Beef Carpaccio with arugula, parmesan, espelette aïoli (amazing!) and were kind enough to share a bite. Woo hoo!

Next, the Sauteed Green-Peppercorn Crusted Filet Of Beef with cognac cream sauce, anna potato, sautéed broccolini, medium rare. I really wanted to try the Lobster Thermidor that Andre's is known for, but couldn't justify the cost. Maybe next time. Perfectly cooked filet - seared just so on the outside and it was complemented wonderfully by the cognac cream sauce. I am not ashamed to admit that I ate every single bite (except the few that I gave away as tastes to my tablemates). The anna potato was lovely and the broccolini was nice, as well. But the star, by far, was the beef filet and sauce. Oh boy.

To finish, the carrot cake souffle with cream cheese sauce. Their souffles must be ordered in advance, which is great for me as I am one who likes to look at the dessert menu first to plan my meal (often, appetizers are sacrificed for the greater good of ordering an amazing dessert). Andre's, somehow, took what is inherently a dense concoction and turned it into something light, airy, and amazingly creamy while retaining all the dense flavor of the original. Wow. Taste buds practically broke out into an aria after the first bite.

I mentioned our concern to the waiter but he didn't seem to take any steps to resolve the issue. We were really disappointed. It's not the money that bothers me, it's the feeling of a bait and switch that does. If I had known that the caviar was going to be that expensive, I would've just stuck with the tasting menu alone.

At first I thought it was a really cool concept to have a private room for us. The decor was nice with the chandeliers and blue walls. Alas, the private dining salon was not so private because shortly after we were seated, a loud chattering group occupied a table behind us. 

The food was just OK. There was nothing spectacular about the lobster bisque. Immediately regretted this ordering decision and I wished I got the escargot instead. For my main course, under a section called ""Andre's Classics"", I ordered the pan seared duck breast with duck sausage. I couldn't even find the duck flavor and  this dish might as well have been chicken for all I care. The sausage was the most flavorful thing on the plate but was a bit  too salty. I had great expectations for this dish since it's a $44 price tag for duck. Seriously. Tried a bit of the chocolate souffle and it was the best thing I had all night.

I would describe the service as sketchy. Their ipad for the drink orders was broken but no one could supply an alternative menu. Early in the meal, the waiter hovers over the table with truffle in his hand and asking if you would like some shavings in your soup or dish. Hmm, kinda like when they ask if you want some pepper. I had to ask if they charge for this (I know that truffle is pricey) and looking like he got caught red-handed, he says it's $8 a gram. Most people would not think to ask this question so they would have been surprised by the extra charges after their meal. I probably wouldn't care as much if I was there for date night but I'm paying for myself, dammit. And we also noticed price discrepancy on how much the dishes cost on the final bill. Had to ask the waiter to bring the menu back and yes, they up-charged our group for some of the dishes.

I, unfortunately, was alone when I stumbled onto this freshly-renovated Vegas gem. I moseyed up to the bar in my shorts, and was surprisingly greeted with a warm welcome. They rolled out the red carpet for me, in fact. 

I was lured in by the sign out front ""2 for 1 martinis."" The bartender made me an expertly prepared martini just the way I like it - slightly dirty with extra olives. 

Whenever you dine in a French restaurant, it's almost criminal not to try their foie gras. Andre's is delectable, a seared, generous portion served over sweet, cooked apples. The sommelier suggested a 2002 Riesling Eiswein (they don't offer a Sauternes by the glass) to pair with the foie. It was rich, creamy, sweet, and mirrored the dish wonderfully. 

Then the cheese sampler. It was served on a plate with separate, little nooks for the 10 or so cheeses that were each married with unique jellies. This dish was accompanied by a basket of sliced baguette and several types of crackers. 

Andre's has over 1,500 bottles of wine in their cellar. They offer 20 by the glass. The sommelier is knowledgeable and extremely approachable. 

The cigar lounge upstairs boasts an ideal setting for ending your evening with a fine cognac, Armagnac or port and a smooth cigar.

I think you have certain expectations when coming to these type of restaurants and all of mine were definitely met.

We got a couple of lobster thermidor, I believe a steak, some escargot, some veggie stuff, tasty booze and some other random stuff that I don't recall at the moment. The lobster was very very delicious. It seems like most people who've had it would agree that its a dish you will love.

We did have this random question as to whether the lobsters were live in a tank back there or if they were frozen and got the ""Oh yeah they're live"" response, which seemed odd somehow but its fine. They're delicious whether they're clubbing them in the head 12 feet away or at a different location. They don't parade them in front of you prior to dinner so its a mystery!

First of all it's in a crappy restaurant with a cheap casino strip club cat walk right outside.  If it was classier it could have a nice touch but it makes you feel like you're in a motel.

Came here with a Travelzoo voucher.  $99 for a roughly $200 meal at a Michelin star restaurant so I thought I'd give it a try.  I had the french onion soup and the woman had the lobster bisque.  The onion soup was really good but the bisque was just okay.  I had the duck breast and the woman had the flat iron steak.  I thought both dishes were very good.  Ordered the foie gras add for an additional cost and it was just okay.  Overall, a good dining experience but I wouldn't pay full price.  Also, the restaurant was dead for an 8 pm Friday dinner.  Not particularly late for Vegas but still.  If I had to pay full price, Price score would be a 2.",IY2_wSs2i3G3rbuhUtsDsw,0,0,4,nAN5Kf1CcORkDOKyNzDXSw

We went to Monte Carlo hoping for the best and found Andre's within sight of the Blue Man theater. A very unassuming place, it looks like a tiny bar. We later found out it was a high-end restaurant and were impressed with the cigar and cognac room upstairs with working fireplace.

The two lovely ladies behind the bar were very helpful. The redhead reminded me of Annie Wersching, a beautiful and talented actress who I had worked with in Hollywood. When my wife showed the redhead Annie's picture, it made her day.

We wanted a quick bite and the happy hour menu fit the bill. My Lower Manhattan was the best drink I had in Vegas that weekend and my wife enjoyed her vodka-based drink, as well. We shared the beef sliders and fries and they were amazing. Moist, flavorful and cooked perfectly, just one for each of us took care of our grumbling stomachs before the show. The bartenders told us the chef was famous and we concurred: the food was as good or better than our steak at Phil's Steakhouse. Next time my wife and I will go there for a sit-down dinner. In pinch, the happy hour bar menu is fantastic.",E77r6xeQ83_rJ7pXmkuZFw,4,3,5,7itprptVEtiSjWjX3gSQYQ

Ambiance: 
The place is small.  Probably 10 tables and very nicely decorated.  The doors to the place are also nicely sound proofed so you get an intimate experience even though your in a casino.  

Service: 
Excellent.  Very friendly from the start.  Not over bearing but on top of drinks and just the right amount of time between courses to allow for a relaxed dining experience without making you feel like they forgot you.  

Food: 
Really good.  Really Really Good.  
With the Travel Zoo voucher it was $99 for 3 courses and a champagne drink for 2 people.  You don't get the full menu but rather what seems to be a designed travel zoo voucher, but the selection was still fantastic.  
For appetizers, I had French Onion Soup...awesome.  My wife had lobster bisque, which was good...probably not as good as the French Onion but still very good.  
Entress.  I had the Sea Bass which was awesome.  My wife had the risotto which was also awesome.  Between the two, I don't know which was better.  I would gladly eat both. 
Dessert. I had some sort of camelized banana and ice cream dessert which was good, not my favorite dessert, but i'm not a dessert guy.  My wife had the chocolate suflee (sp?) which was good and very rich.  

In addition to the entrees we received an small appetizer from the chef that included a vegetable croquet and something else (can't remember).  Both of these were awesome.  We also received a small plate of different chocolates that were awesome.

Drinks: 
We received 2 free champagne drinks with the Travel Zoo voucher which were fun.  Basically, champagne with some grenadine and a cherry. 
We then switched to a cucumber - gin cocktail, which was really really good.  I would love to have the recipe for this.  These were really good...the only downside is they seemed a little pricey, but the place is upscale so the prices were on par for cocktails at a 4-5 star restaurant. 

Overall, the place was great and I'd come back in a second...especially with the Travel Zoo voucher.  WIth the voucher it definitely gives you a top notch Vegas dining experience at a reasonable price.",NfoAmvEZ3NVTAtOEshCvwQ,4,4,5,7yprLoV08_cmx64LTcnCNQ

This was the last of our ""Las Vegas French Tour"" restaurants (after Mon Ami Gabi, Bouchon, L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, Eiffel Tower Restaurant, Payard Patisserie & Bistro).  Unfortunately, it was slightly disappointing.

First, we were seated along the wall in their banquette seating. I know many restaurants have that type of seating now but we usually avoid those places because it seems there is always someone obnoxious right next to you (or we are the obnoxious ones and don't want to spoil someone else's dinner). The service was as good as before but the food was not quite as good - with the exception of the asparagus and soufflé.

My wife ordered the fillet, done medium and it was still mooing when she cut into it! I had the wasabi lamb. The lamb was cooked correctly but the lamb they chose obviously didn't finish fat camp - unlike the last time. It was still good and the steak was tender, but we expected more from Andre's.

This is a small and intimate lounge located upstairs from the restaurant but completely separate and private.  I came here on a same day reservation with 20 people and they still gladly accommodated my party.  They had sectioned on an area for me before arrived and I was greeted upon arrival.  The selection of cigars and cognacs and wells at scotches and other drinks was superb and being served on an iPad was a cool feature.  They were even able to turn on the hockey game for us and when I thought they were going to ask us to keep it down the manager came in and actually turned up the game on the tv and closed the doors so we could have more privacy.  The space was very masculine and upscale, perfect for a bachelor party outing.  Alfredo the chef d etage provided excellent and personalized service to each one of us even though it meant going one by one to offer the best experience possible explains the cognacs and cigars and that was truly appreciated.  The sommelier had put together 3 different cognac flights at 3 different price points for the group which I though was great.  I chose the rare cognacs and they were very exquisite.  Alfredo even came back and offered me a sample of an extremely rare and fine cognac as a gift for my bachelor party.

3326421,2014-06-02,2,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Like a lot of people, we found Andre's through the TravelZoo deal that was mentioned on ChowHound. The ambiance is wonderful at this restaurant, it is beautifully designed inside and feels very romantic and posh.

The amuse bouche was a lovely curry flavored panna cotta that the table enjoyed.

For the first course, we tried the French onion soup and the lobster bisque, both were okay but not great.

For mains, we tried the duck, flat iron steak, and halibut. The duck was the clear winner, the steak was fine but the halibut was way overcooked and dry. It was the first time in a long time that I've had to use a knife to saw into fish.

For dessert, we tried the chocolat souffle and the lemonade cake - both were quite good.

I had a couple glasses of the overpriced Pinot Noir from Pays d'Oc at $15, pretty weak selection for a Michelin starred French restaurant. Not even a cheap Burgundy available? C'mon... This wasn't a good representation of French PN and they shouldn't be selling it at $15 per glass - it is probably $5-$10 per bottle retail. It is from a region known to produce cheap table wines. 

18% gratuity is included on the bill... which is fine, we normally tip more, but it might explain the inconsistent service - like the flatware thrown down too quickly, pouring sparkling water into a glass half full of flat water and just saying ""oh"" and walking away when we mentioned it, etc.

Overall, this restaurant does not deserve a Michelin star and feels like it has fallen a lot from its former glory days. I would not recommend this restaurant to people that expect a Michelin starred experience, we expect better food and service at that level.

Even with the TravelZoo deal, I'd skip this one... Too many better options in Vegas.",urnAblh6kiW_wL8eVN2jxA,3,0,2,GPT-2jSPqvCBxtaiWwNwsQ
3333287,2015-01-11,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"This is a review of the Cigar Lounge:  While offering a decent selection of cigars and a very impressive collection of cognac, Armagnac, and the like, the Cigar Lounge is utterly lacking in vibe and atmosphere.  The upstairs space is small--looking essentially like a converted private dining room--with a small bar at one end and probably five or six ""table equivalent"" seating areas.  The lounge was largely empty, with just one other group sitting down to enjoy some drinks.  One fellow even came in, was seated, and left after a minute because it was so dead and uncomfortable.  The environment isn't even as posh as one might expect from a Las Vegas Strip cigar and cognac lounge.  The addition of some high-backed leather chairs could probably give it more of ""salle privée"" feel, but it seems like the space is holding out for some dream of attracting a more raucous, ""bottle service"" type crowd.  Casa Fuente in the Caesar's mall has a much better atmosphere, albeit in less sophisticated surroundings.

On the upside, the collection of drinks is truly impressive and the display cabinet is worth checking out.  Service is extremely helpful and not at all pretentious: the server was more than happy to make some suggestions to a cognac novice and even recommend some of the value offerings (as it is extremely easy to get lost in some very large numbers on the cognac menu).  The friendly service and impressive drink collection are the only things that save the lounge from a two-star or even one-star review.  The ventilation system is top notch, preventing the room (if it ever did get crowded) from becoming too stuffy.  It actually might be too effective, as you'll likely either feel the air currents or at least see them affecting the smoke from your cigar.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,0,1,3,w8r2O9D__xsZ51lc3XMweg

3449238,2014-10-22,2,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Boyfriend and I went here over the weekend celebrating our 6 month anniversary. From other reviews, I learned about a Travel Zoo deal... so I did some research was I too was also able to find a Travel Zoo deal! The deal available now is $135 for a 5 course dinner tasting for 2 people. Normally a 5 course dinner tasting is $110 each! I made reservations online requesting a booth and stating it was our anniversary and was even able to push back the reservation that day since we were still feeling a bit full from eating at the buffet earlier that day. The Travel Zoo deal is only good Sunday-Thursday, so this was our special Sunday dinner. 

Andre's is located at the end of the hotel, across from Minus 5 in the corner. The host checks you in and through these double doors is the restaurant. It's very private and intimate. I loved the decor and the colors. We were seated in a booth as requested! Wine lists are on an iPad. We gave our server our Travel Zoo voucher. I also checked in on Yelp and was still able to get a free cocktail with that check-in! Some places won't honor the Yelp check-in if you use a voucher of some sort for your meal. The cocktail was a champagne cocktail. Not too strong and was light. 

We chose our 5 items for each of our courses and sat back as they brought us the food. To start, there was complimentary bread and water. The bread was warm and yummy. An amuse bouche was brought out first to cleanse our palettes. It was interesting as I've never eaten one before. I was garlicly and like a pate paste of some sort. I ate part of it, but I think it's an acquired taste. For the tasting menu, it's basically either a meat or veggie dish, so only 2 choices for each. 

Course 1: Beef Carpaccio or chilled corn soup. We both went for the beef. It came with truffle creme, artichoke, and wrapped around spinach with some crisp bread. This dish was tasty and delish! The beef literally melted in your mouth! I ate the whole thing minus the artichokes. 
Course 2: Jumbo sea scallop or vegetable thermadior. We both had the scallop. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce it came with was so good!!
Course 3: sauteed sweetbread or carrot risotto. I had the risotto and boyfriend had the sweetbread. I liked my risotto better. It was so creamy, tasty, cooked perfectly, and a big portion too!! I felt like I would be full from eating just that! I had to stop myself as I wanted to have room for the last 2 dishes! The sweetbread, I did not like too much. It was a pastry puff with sauteed spinach and cherry sauce. It was tarty... so if you like the tart flavor, then you may enjoy this more. 
Course 4: Pan seared duck breast or tofu panzanella. We both went for duck. It was amazing! It also came with duck sausage, couscous cake, sauteed kale and the sauce spiced orange and duck jus was so delicious I wanted to lick the plate clean! Duck breast was tender and I used it to get as much of the sauce as possible. 
Course 5: chocolate almond zuccotto or grand marnier souffle. I had the souffle and boyfriend had the zuccotto. You can definiety taste the grand marnier in the souffle! It was too strong for me so I was unable to finish it. The vanilla sauce however was very good. The zuccotto was so good and I wished I ordered that instead. It was creamy and chocolaty and came with an almond beautifully presented with caramel. 

At the end of our dinner, they even presented us with some truffles on a plate that said Happy Anniversary!! That was such a nice surprise! I was not expecting that as our 5 course dinner already had dessert and since the night before, we had dinner at Brand Steakhouse and they did nothing. Thank you staff at Andre's for going above and beyond in excellent service! After every course our dishes were promptly taken away and we were given new silverware. They checked up on us just the right amount and came right away when we needed something. With our dinner, we also each had a cappuccino ($5).

To end the meal, we were also given brandied cherries in a shot glass. It was strong! I felt like I was taking a shot with each cherry! I was glad we came here as part of our anniversary celebration. It was a romantic and exquisite dinner. Find a deal if you can, as this fine dining, even with a deal can set you back a few hundred. Every dish was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked.

The ambiance is nice and classy with plenty of patterns going on to distract you while you sit. It's pretty quiet in the restaurant so I felt like I had to whisper the whole time.

For $50 during restaurant week, this place was AMAZING. I think I'd still come back even if it wasn't for the restaurant week deal. 

Foie Gras Martini is AMAZING. That is, if you love foie gras. It comes with a nice plate of assortments to eat such as raisens, walnuts, etc. It was definitely a great drink to kick off the meal. 
Amuse: Chilled Consommé of Spring Chicken with Fresh Turmeric - A delicious and light way to start off the meal. 
Heirloom Tomato Salad; Burrata Cheese with Caviar, Melon, Spring Garlic Vinaigrette - I don't understand the craze about heirloom tomatoes but these were delicious. I like appetizers that start off light before they hit you with the heavy entrees. 
Globe Artichoke Soup; Summer Truffle Mousse, Orange Oil - This was delicious! This was rich and savory and really fulfilling. 
Intermezzo ; Grapefruit Sorbet With Mineral Water And Mint Oil - Super tangy but definitely cleanses the palate like it's suppose to (or something like that)
PAN-SEARED DUCK FOIE GRAS caramelized apple, five-spice crème anglaise, port wine reduction - Ugh, I love seared foie gras so this was a great dish for me. Nothing particularly special but it's made just the way you expect it to taste. Pure deliciousness. 
Free Range Chicken; Sweet Corn & Poblano Ragoût with Foie Gras Mole - The chicken was cooked very well, very juice. 
Grilled White Peach; Almond Milk Sorbet with Vanilla Bean Jus - This was a heavier dessert to finish off with. Delicious with whole slices of peach which might have been a little too much dessert but still good. 

Overall, the service was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious. I loved it. I also like that it's kind of this unassuming place so you don't feel like it gets super crowded.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,1,1,5,C_cCw-6o7gqyUwIgticLXQ

3520941,2013-12-19,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Where I come from,  vegetarians don't go to french restaurants because there is nothing for them.   Most fine dining has nothing for us either.  So,  I've had a serious gap in my foodie life until this point. 

We choose Andre's because I read they do a full vegetarian tasting menu along side a full regular French offerings.  They have also done vegan tasting menus (but they need a bit more notice).  I love LOVE this.  I can't believe I've been to vegas a few times and didn't figure out that many place cater to veggies like myself (also check out the Wynn - they ALL have full Vegan menus every day). 

We did a tasting menu with wine pairings.   I have to say I died a little with each course it was so delicious.  I don't usually eat so much heavy on heavy food in a meal and that would be my only complaint but I understand that's a bit of a staple of French dining.   One of the dishes on the menu had tofu, candied Brussels sprouts and cranberry sauce. I winced a bit because I loath Brussels spouts but I have to tell you I LOVED these and I could have eaten many more that I was served... now I just need that recipe and a time machine so I can back in time and give it to my mom when I was young to save a lot of kitchen table fighting in days gone by.

The wines selected were amazingly matched to the food.   My favorite whine was a late harvest with chocolate (I'm so bad with details sorry) paired my chocolate flour less cake.  The dessert was amazing and then with a sip of that wine it came alive and I felt like I never wanted to eat anything else again and risk loosing that flavor.  It's almost worth the return flight for that dessert and pairing alone!

Service is seller.  Atmosphere is charming, traditional french with a modern edge.  I liked the fine china and hand polished silver place settings. 

I highly recommend this place - it's a major splurge but it's a highlight of my trip for me.  PERFECT for a special occasion or just an ""I'm worth it"" dinner.",5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ,1,0,5,3fCs221nqvIOjN5uQhNMWg

But I definitely got what I paid for. It was good. Don't get me wrong here. However, the appetizer and cocktail drink I ordered were superb. I would like to only talk about highlights of my meal in this review. (skip restaurant week tasting menu) 

**Foie Gras Martini came in two part  ($18)
1.) Martini made with foie gras, honey, tahitian vanilla & vodka (served by table side)
 Enjoying foie gras in form of cocktail drinks was filled with excitements n surprises! 

2.) A glass palette of accouterments go with Marti-Gras cocktail includes ice cream, macerated berries, caramelized pears and candied walnuts.
It was perfect wonderful way to enjoy liquid foie gras with these accouterments. I tried each sip with different accouterments and enjoyed it in 4 different ways. It was just truly amazing experience!


**Pan seared duck foie gras ($28)
If you are foie gras lover and would like to get best worth value of foie gras dish in Vegas, this is the ONE. There is no other fine dining restaurant in town that chef is generous enough to serve big piece of gras on menu for this price. And it was the best seared foie gras I had so far. (I've been to Twist, Le Cirque, L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, Mix, Aureole, Eiffel Tower, Bouchon, Comme Ca, Mon Ami Gabi) It was prepared in exactly same way I would like foie gras to be done. Having buttery foie gras and caramelized apple dipping with port wine reduction melt in my mouth is like foodgasm!! It was great mixed of flavors. It's absolutely the best value of $28 I ever spent!!!

Overall, I had a wonderful wonderful dinner at Andre's. It was great I could have foie gras in both new fashion and traditional way at same night. 

Shout out to big foie gras fans out there

Got seated at some awkward table that looked like it was for four but was longer than it was wider. My girlfriend and i didn't want to sit side by side so we moved to the ends. Why did we stay at this table for the remainder of the evening? It was in the corner and much more private so we liked it.

We ordered:
escargots de bourgogne
filet of beef
rack of colorado lamb

All was very very good and it was my girlfriends first time eating escargot. Shouldn't have brought her here because now she'll think that all escargot was this good.

Filet of beef was just like a super tender steak, super tasty, and good portion size with its sides. Rack of lamb was amazing. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted!

We walked over around 7pm on a Friday and were happy to find a seat wih zero wait time. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Vibrant blues and teals embellish the walls and chandeliers. The decor was just pretty to look at. The music was also wonderful. 

I thought the food was good, some parts being better than others. We started with a Cesar Salad sans croutons and were pleasantly surprised with how large this salad was. It was perfectly tossed with a delicious creamy cesar dressing and had a beautiful cheese flower for decoration. We each picked out a steak, myself choosing the flat iron with bernaise sauce and my boyfriend had the rib eye with a peppercorn sauce. We also shared a side of buttered broccolini. I will admit that the steaks were just ok, I felt for the price we paid perhaphs a better quality of meat could be warranted. Also both steaks were fully peppered but had practically zero salt. I had to request salt because there was none available on the table. 

Service was great, had a slight mix up with the Yelp check in offer but we got it resolved quickly and my templeton rye neat arrived shortly after that along with a complimentary specialty cocktail.

None of that exists here. The food is good. Not great but good. And at $130 for just myself, it needed to be great.  The service was attentive buy rough and poorly timed. The guys weren't friendly and kept popping up on me whenever my mouth was full.  The muse en bouche was carrot and something or other that was so heavy on onion that it spoiled the taste because the onion was over powering.  I then had sweet pea and king crab ravioli that tasted like just pea. It was good.  Then I had delicious grilled duck foie gras served on mashed pecans with mustard--not a great compliment for the foie gras, but perhaps that's just me. I then had the Lobster Thermidor which was good. Not great. But good.  I skipped dessert because I would rather eat dessert elsewhere where it may be spectacular. Besides, I spent $130 on this meal that would have been 4 stars (maybe 3.5) at half the price.  I should have spent the money elsewhere, but this is how we learn!!

DH had Batch 19 beer, a Colorado prohibition-era brew recipe.  From the $7 app menu, we tried the sliders, juicy beef with roquefort on fresh house-made brioche, and added fries for $1 ... also enjoyed the charcuterie platter, combining meats, cheeses, pickles, toast, dried fruits, stone-ground mustard -- perfect bites of sweet, salty, tangy, spicy.   And chickpea panisse featured moist triangles of chickpea patties topped with a tangy tomato relish ... sort of a super-fancy deconstructed falafel.

We also ""splurged"" on the calamari petals from the regular bar menu -- that was $14. This is a nice twist on the traditional calamari rings ... here, they're flat, oval shaped pieces of squid, fried with a crunchy coating and a lemony aioli for dipping.  Mmmmm.

This is going to be a very long review so bear with me people.  Now I've eaten at some fairly nice places before; Bouchon, Peohe's, Baleen, and a couple others, but nothing like Andre's. It was my first time eating at a restaurant that's received a Michelin Star. My parents and I came here last Saturday night for dinner. I knew what I was in for being somewhat of a foodie and lover of fine cuisine when I can get it. My parents on the other hand have never experienced this sort of dining experience before. I think they understood when the hostess took us up to the dining area on the second floor, pulled out each chair for us, and set the cloth on our laps. Even though we were eating here we were still on a budget so we sadly didn't get any wine, but the wine list is presented on none other than an iPad brought to the table by the server. Our server was wonderful as he should be. He knew the food which is a must for a man in his position, he was polite, witty, and always attentive. We had the whole room to ourselves being that it was early (7:30). The decor is phenomenal. The whole place is a turquoise that suggests a very elegant and relaxing dining experience. The chandeliers are beautiful. As are the table settings, the silverware and plates. Everything about this place is perfect. Now time to get onto the food. It was restaurant week so both my parents ordered off those tasting menus. I'd already studied the menu extensively so I knew what I wanted, or so I thought. Everything sounded wonderful, but there were two things that I knew I must try. One being escargot, and the other foie gras. I've been waiting my whole life to try it (19 years). I must say my first experience with it was heavenly. The meal was started of with a Chilled Consommé of Spring Chicken with Fresh Turmeric that initiated the meal exquisitely. The bread as well is amazing, as best as it gets I suppose. I had the Escargot de Bourgogne and the Pan-Seraed Duck Foie Gras as appetizers. The escargot came in this wonderful little dish with six small wholes for each snail. The garlic butter was divine and the herb base which was a pesto-like medley went perfectly with them. I'm pleased to say that my first tasting of escargot got to go so wonderfully. They were amazing and worth every penny. The foie gras. You should have seen the expression upon my face once I took my first bite. I wish I could have seen it. It sat atop a caramelized apple, which also sat in a five spice creme anglaise and a port wine reduction. I just can't put into words how lovely and perfect it was to get a bite with the perfectly prepared foie gras, apple, swirled around in the sweetest most beautiful creme anglaise you could imagine. You must experience it for yourself trust me. As for my entree I ordered the Pekin Duck Breast. Before that came out though we were served an intermezzo of Grapefruit Sorbet With Mineral Water And Mint Oil. A great way to cleanse your palate and be prepared for your entree. The duck came with none other than more foie gras. This time atop mango, puff pastry, and a duck confit. It was just as heavenly as the first foie gras, though a little smaller. The duck breast itself was amazingly tender. Sliced perfectly with no juice seeping into my basmati rice (they let it sit properly before slicing). The plating was magnificent just as all the other plates that were set on our table. For dessert I had a souffle which was",fLs6kjU7XKSIjzMKYTjO3A,2,1,5,eMBjs4TKjH5cSEoMdMpXjw

Came to take advantage of restaurant week's dinner deal. The menu selection had several choices including one for vegetarians, and several for carni-whores. The restaurant is very small, intimate and extremely quiet, everyone was almost whispering to each other. 

Unlike Alize, which is headlined by the same chef, this place is a lot more traditional in both the decor, ambience and cuisine. In addition, there is also a lounge upstairs that provides whiskey, cigar, and cognac tastings. I was fortunate enough to meet one of the tasting specialist and he was kind enough to explain and show me some of their impressive selection of 200+ year old cognacs: half oz will cost over $100, but you will not find it in many places in the world.

My 3 course dinner consisted of a salad which was good, the chicken spinach crepe created specially for restaurant week - very delicious, and the lemon cake with a hint of raspberry - mind blowing. The service was extremely attentive, the on duty manager, host, and head of staff came around often to make sure I was enjoying my meal and I was happy with everything.

The french onion soup was very nice, and not overly salted as most restaurants tend to make them.  The lobster bisque was rich, fragrant, and flavorful.  I ordered the duck which came in tender slices with crispy skin.  Other members of my party ordered the roast chicken with foie gras, surf and turf (wagyu and australian lobster tail), and lobster thermidor.

3916608,2012-08-29,6,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Andre's was my first stop for Restaurant Week, and I don't think I could have asked for a better meal.  I'll say it was probably my favorite meal so far this year, though Sushisamba's omakase is a close second.  For $50.12, I was treated to a four course meal when a lot of other RW menus were only 3 courses.  Seemed like good value, and I've never tried Andre's before.

While waiting for my table, I ended up chatting briefly with their bartender.  She's from Croatia, which I am a huge fan of.  This girl is so hot she's worth going to the restaurant for alone!

Before the first course came out, I was given an unexpected amuse-bouche.  I wish I could remember what the waiter called it, but it was tasty.  There's pictures above of this item, as well as the rest of my meal.

The first course was ""Roasted Corn Soup With Warm Crab Salad, Garlic Chips And Chive Oil.""  I'm not a big soup fan, but this was fantasic.  Amazing flavor, and a generous portion.

The second course was ""Butter Lettuce Salad With Crispy Duck Confit, Toasted Almonds And Cherry Vinaigrette.""  Another delicious item I wasn't expecting to enjoy that much.  The duck was very tasting, I just wish there was a little more dressing on the plate.

I was then given a palette cleanser, a little bit of gelato.  I've never seen that before a main course, but who am I to argue.

I actually never ordered my main course.  There were three choices, and I skipped the chicken and narrowed it down to ""Grilled Rib Eye Cap With Anna Potato, Broccolini And Horseradish Beef Jus"" or ""Seared Scottish Salmon With Spinach Gnocchi, Heirloom Tomato And Truffle Beurre Blanc.""  I had just had steak the night before, or I would have ordered the first choice.  Instead, I told the waiter to pick.

He brought a steak knife, so I figured that was that.  I actually thought (since I'm a poker player) that it would be awesome if he was trying to trick me and brought me the salmon.  But what waiter would think of that?  RICARDO DID!  The salmon arrived, and I was both disappointed and delighted.  In the end, it was really a delicious main course and I'm not unhappy at all.  Perfectly cooked salmon, and the gnocchi were fantastic.

For dessert (I could barely eat anymore!) they brought ""Cocoa-Nut Marquise With A Banana-Lime Sabayon.""  I know like 2 of these words, but my taste buds liked all of them.

The entire meal was first class, with the manager coming over to chat with me at one point.  The dining room is small and has a great vibe.  I have 0 complaints about this place and can't wait for the next Restaurant Week to eat here again.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,10,7,5,zO5IicfTd5pOiX6uP_QWNw
3921398,2014-12-29,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Very poor experience here. Went in for dinner on Saturday night around 6:45 pm. The place was still pretty empty with only a couple other tables being served. We had the misfortune of being placed with one the worst, rudest waiters I've ever experienced. To begin with, it took about 10 minutes before anyone even came over to hand us a menu. Then about another 10 minutes later or waiter decides to come over and introduce herself, as well as take our order. She was condescending and downright rude to the table next to us, so I wasn't expecting much when she actually came over. Never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink, and I had to ask her for a wine menu before ordering (this is supposed to be a Michelin rated restaurant - come on!) Finally we get our order in, and the food doesn't come out for 30 minutes! Not ONCE did our waiter come by during this time to check up on us or ask if I would like another glass of wine. Finally when the food does come out, they forgot to bring by our side order of brussels sprouts. Another 15 minutes go by, and by the time they do bring them out, we were already done with our meal. Was told by the server to just eat them and we wouldn't be charged. Of course we ended up being charged for them, even though we told the waiter we didn't want them because they took so long we had already finished our meal. And then the icing on the cake...after asking for my ID to charge the tab to our room at Bellagio (which was kind of weird in itself), our waiter takes a look at my ID and condescendingly says ""gained some weight there didn't ya."" I mean, again this is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant, who says that? I don't know the waiters name, but she really ruined what would otherwise have been a decent meal experience.

3936259,2013-10-07,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Andre's is the epitome of fine French dining.  Located in a quiet corner of the Monte Carlo, it is unassuming from the outside.  However, this restaurant is a Michelin-starred gem of a find in Las Vegas.  

The atmosphere is simple and elegant: no unnecessary decor and some lovely chandeliers serving as the only decorative attraction in the room.  Voices were hushed to a comforting hum, and there was a shared intimacy unique to this place.

As other Yelpers have done a thorough job posting photographs of various courses, I'll just give a written description.  We were complimented an amuse bouche of a chorizo and mustard green croquette, served with creme freche, before our appetizer of pan-seared foie gras arrived.  The croquette was a nice surprise, being surprisingly light and airy, despite the rich and heavy reputation of chorizo.  

However, the foie gras was astonishing in its complexity and quality.  One of our servers mentioned it was one of the chef's signature dishes, and joked that often the quality of a French restaurant is measured on the foie gras alone.  There were hints of smoke and cinnamon, in addition to a mild nutty flavor that persists even after your sip of wine.  I've had foie gras only about 6 or 7 times in my life, usually at French bistros, but this one is the clear winner.  You may prefer escargot instead, but it would be a pity to pass on this specialty of the chef.

The second course was lobster bisque, and it was fine.  High quality ingredients speak for themselves, and there were no additional twists on this classic bisque: creme, tomato, lobster, and maybe a touch of saffron.  It serves its purpose: it's seductive and comforting as you eat it, and then you promptly refocus on your wine and the next course.

The entree for me consisted of seared duck breast served over a duck confit, alongside a yam gnocchi.  I'd had a bad experience with a duck breast entree not long ago at the Signature Room, atop the Hancock Building in Chicago, so it was with significant trepidation that I chose this dish again.  However, the duck breast was perfect: tender as a filet mignon and spiced just perfectly.  While I'm not a fan of sweet pastas, the gnocchi worked surprisingly well, but the confit was a bit too salty for me.  My fiancee had the ribeye cap medium, served with broccolini and mashed potatoes, and she adored the beef.  She was less enthusiastic about the vegetables, but I tried her ribeye and it was magnificent.

We finished the meal with creme brulee and chocolate souffle, which were both an excellent finish to the meal.  The magnitude of our fullness struck us only as we put down the dessert forks for a final time, and we looked pensively at each other once four complimentary truffles arrived at our table.   I managed to consume two before formally submitting, and the other two were smuggled out for later.

This bistro is superb.  It seems Chef Andre's philosophy is to provide a classical French dining experience, with just a few deviations in the recipes of non-crucial dishes.  There is a remarkable balance between complexity and subtlety: it was almost as if we'd alternate between courses that required attention and focus on flavors, to courses that required only basic awareness.  The result is a challenging and wonderful meal that does not carry a risk of 'taste fatigue.'  

I would whole-heartedly recommend this restaurant.  Bon appetit!",UAbnZEWFjI3mdwlE-8eAnQ,3,2,5,rURtCsvO25h68_N4bhI8_Q

3960592,2016-07-28,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Two words: highly overrated

I came to Vegas for the weekend to meet up with some girl friends. Before coming to Vegas we decided we wanted to dine at a nice restaurant to celebrate. We chose Andre's after looking through Yelp ratings. None of us had ever been here before, so we didn't know what to expect. I mean, given the 4 dollar signs and the 4+ rating it *should* be good... Right?

Nope.

The entire experience was underwhelming - from arriving at the restaurant to receiving the check, the entire process left something to be desired.

AMBIANCE: 3.5/5
I was surprised by how small the dining room of the restaurant was. We had made a reservation a week prior to arriving at the restaurant, so I was a little taken aback when we were seated at a 4-person table right in the middle of the tiny dining room. Throughout the night, I saw that tables/booths at the periphery of the restaurant were empty. Given that they weren't busy, I can't imagine why they put us in such an awkward table position. The decor seemed dated... tired-looking, almost. It was almost kitsch.

SERVICE: 3.5/5
Given the type of restaurant I was being served in I had expected more of the service staff. They seemed to have done the bare minimum required of a restaurant like this, which means it wasn't enough. Like what some of the other reviewers said, the service was attentive but rough around the edges. One waitress took away our forks and knives right after another server had set them down (for our meat entrees). They also made a big mistake ($150+!) on our check, which we had to correct.

FOOD: 3/5
Alas, the food. I was thoroughly disappointed in the food. Three of us ordered the 5-course tasting, while one person did a-la-carte. Overall, the food was way too SALTY. There was not a single dish where we did not do a double take on just how salty the food was. In addition to being too salty, the flavors were just plain unimpressive. I had the soup of the day (chilled creamy artichoke), crab meat ravioli, duck breast, lamb chop, and the Grand Marnier souffle. The texture of the meats were good, but because of how salty everything was I wasn't able to truly appreciate the food.

My dining friend and I came here for a last supper, as it were, because André's in the Monte Carlo is closing at the beginning of October.  Not to worry, however.  They will be re-opening in a new location to be announced.

I didn't know the first floor dining room existed because we were shown to a table on the second floor after leaving the elevator.  I must say this first floor dining room is exquisite!  Elegant, fairly small, and a classic fine dining look to it.

We were served:

Baguette with butter
Charcuterie platter with two kinds of paté
Fresh fruit salad with fresh made burrata
Cold grilled asparagus
Frogs legs
Duck foie gras with sliced peaches
Duck confit cassoulet
Mussels in a saffron and white wine broth with chorizo
Pheasant en croute
Sweet corn risotto
Roasted artichoke and tomato
Bison t-bone steak
Sorbet in a honey tuille
Lime Basque cake
Dark chocolate fondant with mascarpone, orange, and fig ice cream
Hazelnut praline gateau
Banana ice cream profiteroles
Caramel macchiato bonet
Raspberry soufflée
Mignardises

The two of us spent about three and a half hours enjoying this wonderful meal.  Most courses were shared.  Service was exceptional.  It's hard to point to any particular item as everything was a standout but let me try.

The duck foie gras with sliced peaches was excellent.  The two terrines on the charcuterie platter were amazing.  The mussels in saffron and white wine broth was sublime.  The bison t-bone was cooked perfectly and was very tasty and the desserts were amazing.

I'm sad to see this restaurant close but I'll be looking for their new spot when it's announced.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,12,5,R4TKkCFgasOJ3gbvrWDTwA

We called in advance to ask if there are vegetarian dishes, as one of our friends is vegetarian. They said yes. We asked if it was possible if 3 out of 4 people can do the tasting menu since one friend is vegetarian. They said it depends on the Maitre d. We decided to go for it since all the reviews were so great.

When we got there, we were greeted by an awesome staff.

However, they did not have anything vegetarian on their menu except some salads and the cheese plate (no vegetarian entrees). However, they wanted to accommodate us so they said they could create something on the spot. YAY! They said they could make risotto, which my friend was extremely happy about. Then, our server came back and said no risotto, just pasta primavera. Friend was disappointed.

We asked about the tasting menu but they told us no can do. The chef does not like it when the whole table does not participate because one person will just nurse one dish the whole night. I guess it's understandable. We all ordered our dishes a la carte.

I had the french onion soup (light and good)
the spinach salad (good, though I could have had it without the raw onions)
the duck for entree (it looked like duck burrito and sliced duck..pics posted)
and for dessert, the grand marnier souffle (it was okay..but by that time i was too full to enjoy it).

I also had some good red wine to accompany my meal.

I thought the meal was pretty good. However, I still wish I could have experienced the full ""glory"" of Andre's.",m3FleKsUG-1UNqJsJZid9A,2,1,4,itglcmI7wtLdbykHmS0c9g

The restaurant itself is stunning and one of the most beautiful restaurants I have ever eaten in.  Once you step inside, you forget you're in a casino.  Love the decor and ambience.  I find French food to be a little heavy for my taste.  I am just not in to rich food.  

I have eaten here once before and was pretty underwhelmed.  When I had to go to Andres for a work dinner, I was glad it was during Restaurant Week because I'd scoped out the RW menu online and thought it sounded good (yeah, I have a serious obsession with food).  

Course 1 - Started with an amuse bouche.  Like cold chicken broth.  Nothing exciting.  

Course 2 - Heirloom Tomato Salad.  Excellent! I love tomatoes and the burrata cheese was delicious.

Course 3 - Artichoke Soup - This was good, but like most French food, I thought this was waaayyy too creamy and rich.  

Course 4 - You get a choice of entree and I went with the seared pork belly.  Awesome.  Melt-in-your-mouth pork with a nice crust of fat.  The best part of my meal.

Course 5 - Grilled White Peach - I was so stuffed that I only had a bite.  It was good, but not great.

I also tried the summer truffle risotto and Potatoes au gratin which were ordered for the whole table.  Loved the potatoes, although they were incredibly rich, but the risotto was just okay.  Apparently, everyone else at the table loved the risotto because they chowed.

All in all, service was excellent and food was good not great.  I prefer Comme Ca, because it offers a creative new take on French food. This is a great spot if you like traditional French cuisine.  For me, I was glad my boss was picking up the tab.  Aside from RW menu, the prices were redonculous.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,0,0,4,ndmmamDOrZ-3jy4nsI8Mrw

I've been here numerous times now, I've been to every Whiskey Wednesday event thus far and have to say the team at Andre's ( Tanya and Patrick) always strive to give the best service!  Not only are they attentive, they know their stuff! Ask them about any cigar, cognac, whiskey, etc, they will tell you a little bit about what you are drinking and recommend others for you to try!

I was thoroughly impressed with Patrick on my last visit, I was there to celebrate my birthday and we had dinner down in the restaurant before going up to the lounge for after dinner drinks.  Even though I usually come for the Whiskey events, I am a cognac drinker at heart.  He recommended a wonderful cognac to go with my cigar.  Not only did he recommend a great cognac, but also told me about a tasting flight of cognacs and armagnacs.  

OH MY GOD...I would never had gotten the chance to try the bottles he pulled if he had not offered that, I highly recommend doing a tasting flight at Andre's if you get a chance!  Patrick took the time to show me each bottle and tell me a little about where it came from and the history of it.  Very impressive is all I can say!

4139075,2011-10-05,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"So so so dissapointing! I'm being nice and giving 3 stars as the service and ambience was nice. We were excited to try this place because 1, it was in our hotel, and 2, it got good reviews. My friend's an exec chef, so I trust her judgment in food and such too, and she was highly dissapointed as well. We had to wait for awhile for our table as we got there 15 minutes late (but we called to let them know we'd be late!), and we checked out their menu and cocktails on the iPad. Doors open for us shortly after, and it was a really intimate and nice setting of booths and tables. 

The waiter, who we only saw to take our order and possible dessert order came and told us the best of the menu, etc.

for our appetizers we started with the beef carpaccio and the scallop macadamia. we munched on the delicious baguette bread, and my friend ordered a cocktail that had earl grey in it, and it was a round ice that looked like a tea bag with the string and tag hanging from it. the hint of earl grey was really nice, surprisingly.

the beef carpaccio was pretty good, the meat seemed to be very high quality. the scallop macadamia was HUGE, and the macadamia crust was  really good. so was the sauce with it.

for our entrees, my friend got the free range chicken that was stuffed with crab and mushrooms. I got the apple stuffed pork tenderloin. we shared our dishes, and okay my pork tenderloin was not good. it was cooked to a way where it wasn't very tender, and i couldnt eat more than a piece. the sauteed brussel sprouts were so salty, that all i really enjoyed from the dish was the mashed potatoes. i even started going back to the bread basket. my friend's chicken was okay, i cant really say the combination of the chicken and crab went well together, but the worst part was her tomato gnocchi. the part we had looked forward to most. i put one in my mouth and i wish i spit it out, but felt rude to do. i felt like i had just dumped a spoon full of salt into my mouth. it was absolutely disgusting. do they not taste their food before serving? the only thing good off her plate was the spaghetti squash. 

now, we should've said something and we were about to, but im not one that will complain even if they ask how the food is. I regret it though because really, no one should eat their tomato gnocchi.

the sweets they give you at the end, they tasted like fondant. horrible.

The chairs are big and comfy like in a living room. The service here is amazing. For an appetizer I had the lobster bisque which was very different. There is a lobster cake and they pour the lobster bisque soup on top of it right in front of you. For dinner I had the duck and it was cooked perfectly! (And I'm pretty picky with duck). For dessert I had the carrot cake soufflé which was amazing. If I ever do go back to Vegas I would go back here because it is definitely worth the price.

4199769,2016-04-09,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"My boyfriend and I made reservations to Andre's for our 8 year anniversary dinner. It's inside the Monte Carlo Casino on your left-hand side if you walked from the hotel's main entrance and on the big artery path that runs through the casino. 

We were walked to our table which was a booth that was along the wall and faced out, so we sat side by side with a view of the other patrons. We were given an ipad to explore the drink options which categorized the drinks by the type of alcohol that is used in them. We decided to order a la carte instead of the tasting menu, which was an available option.

We shared the beef carpacio, roasted chauteubriand, seared diver scallops, and a side of potato puree. 

I never was a fan of arugula before but when it's paired with the beef carpacio, it adds this peppery taste that compliments the beef and cauliflower puree so well. On the menu the chauteubriand is suggested for 2 people but it was more than enough! We each got 3 thick slices cooked medium. Although the scallops were the star of the dinner, we both loved how perfectly cooked the scallops were. We had more than enough food but I couldn't really leave without ordering a souffle... Luckily for me, my boyfriend is not a big dessert person so I didn't have to share my chocolate souffle. It was soo heavenly, I'm pretty greedy so I practically showered the thing in chocolate sauce...

At the end of the dinner where we both were so full we were about to keel over, our server brings out a plate of mint chocolate truffles that read 'Happy Anniversary' - so cute! We wrote on our open table reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary, but didn't really expect them to pay attention to the comments. It was such a cute gesture. We also received complimentary cherry soaked in brandy at the end. 

It was a cute experience, definitely suited for our anniversary dinner. I'd definitely want to come back to try their happy hour and for more scallops and souffles!!",dh_2BNnKPlvp3OW3TLTDNQ,2,3,4,ANd6DKmgyXgPmNxMq5H_Uw

I decided on trying the Lobster Bisque and the boyfriend tried the French Onion soup. Neither of us were that impressed by the soups. Entree time!!!

The amouse bouche was an uninspired tomato et. al. soup. the service annoyingly rushed, trying to get you out before the 7 course meal is finished or make sure it finishes fast - all in, 90 min from entering to leaving the restaurant - blessed be american efficiency. 

The oxtail cannoli was burned - I guess somebody put a torch to it and overdid it - talk about quality control... Gordon would have the chef do the dishes. The fois gras was ok. the sorbet inbetween to cleanse the pallet was a block of ice that I could not eat...the duck was done very nicely- a perfectly cooked piece of meat with a very balanced, sweet ensemble of sides. The cheese course was good as were the berries, but then again what could you do wrong except buying bad ingredients? The chocolate pineapple desert was quite nice.

I am used to unfiltered wine, but to shake the bottle prior to serving seems ill advised - especially if you do not decanter, so it is up to the customer to battle the deposit.

All in - certainly better than a macdonalds, but Ido not get what is so good about andre's... a waste of money, only good to impress a certain clientele.",_j259cqaNeqkJqX1bidFRw,0,0,2,qCHRHUB37vv6vNOXI_Gtww

-Waldorf salad - was a bit of a disappointment because it was one like 3 pieces of butter lettuce, the salad dressing was a tad sweet and the walnuts weren't so tasty even though they were candied

-Almond crusted calamari - well I am a calamari lover but it didn't taste much like the calamari rings I'm use to..I think it may have been the calamari tubes but it wasn't chewy so that's a plus

-Our main course we ordered the PAN ROASTED CHÂTEAUBRIAND which serves two but we were 3 girls with a whole bunch of side dishes so we decided to share it. It was a big portion with 6 pieces and it was delicious! Very tender and they gave us 3 types of steak sauce and I liked them all but my fav was the peppercorn sauce. It also came with a side of veggies; Brussels sprouts and spinach on the plate.  Anyhow, it was very good but sadly enough the 3 of us couldn't finish it and had 3 pieces left.. I know we are terrible we wasted yummy food.. What a sin! But when it sin city its expected! 

-Mashed potatoes, asparagus and French green beans were our sides and they were all made to perfection as far as side dishes go. Green beans were cooked enough to still have the slight crunch and similar to the asparagus.  The girls loved the mashed potatoes as it was whipped up so nice and fluffy.

All around a solid dinner. They have use additional amuse bosh(!spelling?) and chocolate truffles for desert since we didn't order desert , we were stuffed from dinner and had so much left over! It was an excellent night and service from all of the Employees were on point- pulling our chairs out, opening doors, walking me to the elevator to go to the restroom, all in addition to their attentive service at the table. They went above and beyond, that was very nice- worth all the $$$$.",zMRSS92KqhSJDEiBa4Tkag,0,0,4,Ar08CJ4ibjL4oVmQ121NZQ

3 butters (plain, tomato, olive) were spectacular. Bread was warm and brought out at the right time.

Service -- very helpful, pressure free. Friendly. 
Space -- quiet in the circus of vegas. I liked the colors. Feels like a special room, as opposed to some massive fancy place like Alex in the Wynn.

- Amuse. Delicious and creative.

- Sweetbreads to start. Sometimes these are pork, I forgot to ask (I don't eat beef). So when they came I realized these were the beef ones. I called over the waiter and he said ""yes they are beef"" and I told him I cannot have it and he said ""I am really sorry. Let me get you the lobster bisque, will that work?"" and I said yes and voila, it was there in 5 minutes. Great service. It was not their fault, it was mine, but they handled it smoothly and in dignified fashion.

- Duck for the main. YES SIR. Fantastic. Great portion size and perfectly cooked.

- Pre dessert amuse. Loved the apple flavor, yum. 

- Carmel chocolate dessert with sugar cane ice cream. Delish. Waiter recommended this one, good call.

- Petite fours. All very nice.

The ONLY reason this doesn't get 5 stars. Wait, you know, I re thought my review and said for the great service, great food, and hospitality, this DOES deserve 5 stars. Bumping it up from 4.5 to 5. Well done Andre's.",d6b5ZXQKR4BxKN6KY2c_7A,0,0,5,9wPV9AraY9oM15mFpZ_n-Q
4451861,2013-09-18,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"I would say this was more of a 3.75 experience, but we must round up to 4 stars. 

My friend and I dined at Andre's at 5:30 PM with a TravelZoo coupon for $99 which gets two people two pre-fixe three course meals with two cocktails. Yes, that is an amazing deal, so basically $50 per person (with gratuity included). Andre's gets two-thumbs up for the deal in the first place, and even more thumbs up for quickly providing the pre-fixe menu selections to us and delivering our complimentary cocktails amazingly quick as soon as we sat down.

Andre's is a fascinating dining experience, with a quiet, dark, yet very refined dining room. The servers are quick to please and you can tell they enjoy the food, explaining it, presenting it, and even, in a flourish, taking it off your table when you are done. I absolutely adore the gold dome covers for some of the dishes that come out. I also truly admire their plating and the colors of the plates/style which reminded my friend and I of Tiffany's.  

Appetizer - Foie Gras with fig/apple reduction. A medley of savory and sweet, cooked perfectly, with a slight, crisp exterior, and a melt-in-your-mouth, buttery interior. Presentation could use some refinement, but overall pleased with the dish. (BTW - this was not on the Pre-Fixe Menu)

Pre-Fixe Starter: French Onion Soup - Ee gads, the soup was inedible. I tried to eat some, but could not. The top was charred too much. It must have sat under the broiler to melt the cheese for too long. One of my croutons simply looked like a black coal, I kid you not. 

Entree - Rib eye, with potato cake and broccolini. I have never been a fan of broccolini. I would much rather have plain old broccoli, mostly because it's just easier to eat. However, it was well cooked and had a bite to it, so at least it was not flaccid and inedible. The potato cake tasted like hash browns, but in a square cake form. The rib eye was tender, ordered medium, and honestly very good. Although I recently had a more expensive rib eye that has kind of ruined a lot of meat for my in general. None the less this one was the best part of my entree.

Dessert - Creme brulee with seasonal fruit. Presentation was perfect, but the bowl was too shallow! Ahem, I mean, I can always use more creme brulee! Although the portion was small, it was still a creamy creme brulee, with only the slightest crackle to the top, which I prefer over a harder char on my dessert.

Overall Andre's is kind of a diamond in the rough of Monte Carlo. It should definitely be on any fine-dining ""must do"" list though. I would certainly return, especially since they appear to feature seasonal tasting menus and happy hours.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,1,4,B_KtvXNFki6XMeP0hjxRkQ

A novel concept compared to the constant thumping typically encountered in many of the other restaurants along the Strip.

We ordered our dessert, souffles, at the same time as our appetizers. Glad I did, as I was stuffed at the end and may have passed, but I ended up trying three of them. Kahlua, Grand Marnier, and a yummy Roasted Peanut. Pricey, so be ready to pay at least $100/head without drinks or wine.

4488949,2013-04-30,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"One of the best dining experiences in Vegas tucked away in a corner near the entrance from the strip adjacent to Dragon Noodle. Andre's is a high end, traditional French restaurant! My accomplice and me booked for a 5:30pm reservation which we later moved to 6:30pm since we were running late. We also used a $50 Monte Carlo dining voucher we had received from playing too many hours of MyVegas on Facebook.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the host and led for a quick walk straight and to the right of the bar. There are stairs that leads to the cigar room upstairs and the lobby of the restaurant has a small bar that seems to cater to a more upscale, older crowd. Host opened a set of fancy doors and we walked into a small room that fits no more than 25 tables (probably less) and 1 table of Chinese patrons who stared at us from head to toe. We sat in a comfortable booth with a high back clearance. 

Host Ricardo Hernandez and staff stopped by to greet us. Waiter handed us two menus and an ipad that contained a wine list and the Spring Tasting Menu. Seeing that we wanted to try a bit of everything, we opted for the Spring Tasting Menu ($100 for 5 courses). Guests also have options for a 7 course at $125 per person or $180 with wine pairing (5 courses) and $220 with wine pairing (7 courses).

We ordered and/or received the following:
-Duck Foie Gras Mouse (Chef's Complements): I thought I was eating dessert. Loved it.
-Beef Carpacchio: I didn't have this since my accomplice did. Accomplice said it was very rich, the argula was fresh. Colors and plating were vibrant.
-Chilled White Asparagus Soup: Very smooth. Not too salty.
-Stuffed Piquillo Pepper:  I was hesitant to order this, but I didn't like the other items that were in this course section. Item came out very smooth and the pepper was well blended. 
-Seared Jumbo Sea Scallops: Note that it's actual a scallop (not scallops). Loved the juicy fava beans. Seafood was very fresh. 
-Pan Seared Duck Breast & Duck Sausages: Some of the best French cooked duck breast and sausages I've ever had. Meat was soft and tender and the rissole of potatoes were mini and so fun to eat. Poor duckies. 
-Palate Cleanser (in the form of a carmelized orange, Chef's Complements)
-Cinnamon Layer Cake: Loved the chocolate honeycomb with vanilla ice cream. The chocolate was rich and favorable.  
-Grand Marnier Souffle: Better than the layer cake. Hot and so soft! Melted in my mouth.
-Powdered Chocolate Balls (Chef's Complements, 4 Balls of Various Flavors such as Dark, White, Regular).

One look at the silverware/China and I knew it was the good stuff. Alberto Pinto good (designer of China and his dessert plates go for around $200-$300 a piece).

I did have to wait for my water to be refilled a few times, but other than that it was wonderful and attentive! The sommelier was an expert at the restaurant's long hard to beat wine list and the waiters and hosts knew the food well.

Overall, I had a fabulous time and would come back again. If you want a more romantic experience, get to the restaurant before 7:30pm. At around 7:30pm the crowd picked up and the noise in the room got a lot louder especially since the restaurant has no opening to the outside (minus the door that shuts) and no windows. For the first half hour, it felt like private fine dining and a break from the overcrowded and noise of Vegas on a Saturday night. The dining room was beautiful and stunning. I ended up having a late night snack afterwards, but hey it's French food and you never get full.

While I didn't see a dress code posted, this is definitely a business casual and up place. I saw several elderly ladies donning high end jewelry and expensive purses. Reminds me of The Great Gatsby.",h9GVLf7Crm4kNuLFBDnEIw,3,2,4,srj8I85XTEIXY3Yd8M7Ypg

This restaurant is very traditional french, nothing new or contemporary but, flavors were excellent and well executed. We were going out after to meet friends after so we were on a time constraint and were not able to do the tasting menu however, had an appetizer and two entrees.

AMUSE BOUCHE - artichoke soup with a foie gras reduction. This was  nice and thick. Lately it seems like everyone is doing some sort of potato soup amuse bouche and they are starting to all taste the same. The artichoke was a nice change and bottom of the soup had foie so of course, it was delicious. It was chilled and rich definitely only need a couple bites.

PAN-SEARED FOIE GRAS
caramelized apple, five-spice crème anglaise, port wine reduction. Pairing with a Royal Tokaji 2006. This dish was almost like a dessert. If are squeamish about duck liver this dish might convert you. The foie light in flavor and extremely soft like butter. The Tokaji went very well with the dish.

MAINE LOBSTER THERMIDOR- asparagus, white mushrooms, tarragon, brandied cream sauce. This was an entree lobster with mash potatoes at the bottom. It was delicious and very filling. I guess an entire lobster is a lot, huh? :P 

MUSHROOM RISOTTO - with freshly shaved Perigord truffles. This was probably my favorite dish. The risotto was cooked perfectly the mushroom were earthy and tender. When we walked into the restaurant you could smell the truffles in the room. Fabulously!!

In terms of the food, we came the day before Valentine's for a set dinner.

This was the first place wife ever got foie and boy has she been hooked since!  They have had a really nice seared foie gras that is was paired apple one time and pear the other.  Since that first experience at Andre's anytime there is seared foie on the menu it is the likely choice.

With our most recent they had revised the menu slightly.  They had added a pasta/risotto section of which at that time they had crab ravioli.  It was disappointing as bit into a piece of shell.

The French onion soup is always delicious, and comes out piping hot every time.

For entrees I always get the lobster thermidor.  It comes plated inside the tail shell covered in a rich cream sauce.  There are some veggies included and the portion is huge so there is no need to order sides if you get this.  Wife has mixed it up with some inconsistent results.  Last time she got the salmon and requested it cooked medium rare.  Definitely missed the temp this time.

portions on the apps and entrees are quite large for a fine dining restaurant.  Often this leaves us with minimal room for dessert.  We usually end up splitting one if we get anything.  We have done the gelato sampler or a souffle when we have gotten desserts.  They have been very good and would recommend!

1) We were seated at a table right next to the kitchen door.  There was a CONSTANT flow of traffic in/out of the kitchen: that was VERY distracting and REALLY disrupted the meal.  If we were at Denny's... no big deal, but this place had a Michelin star.  They should just remove that particular table and that problem would be solved.  

2) We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairings.  While the food was worthy of their Michelin star, the wine pairings were TERRIBLE!!!  We never saw a sommelier and I got the distinct impression that they were just trying to get rid of their already opened bottles of wine.  Additionally, the wines were of low quality and most of the pairings made absolutely no sense.  A fine-dining restaurant can't afford to let a poor wine program ruin the experience for its customers.  

Andre's is something of a forgotten gem.  If they would pay a bit more attention to details, I have no doubt they can regain their glory.

My rule is if you can shake it in a shaker and pour it into a martini glass (and it isn't poisonous or still alive) I am in! This rule has led me to the delightful bacon martini, electrolyte-rich pickletini, creamy avocadotini, and now the amazing and sinfully decadent Foie Gras Martini.

Yes, I said Foie Gras Martini! We came to Andre's just to have this intriguing concoction. We sat at the bar and ordered the martini. The wonderful bartender told us it was prepared in the kitchen and came with accompaniments so it would take a little longer, but it is worth the wait. He was not lying. About 10  minutes later a procession arrived at the bar. The chef stood before me, behind the bar and a waiter placed a large divided glass plate in front of me. There were also 2 or 3 other servers/managers there to watch. Greg, the chef introduced himself and placed a tall elegant martini glass in front of me. He shook a small martini shaker and poured the luscious contents into my glass. Essentially it looked like fluffy liquid foie gras. Then Greg produced a black truffle the size of my head and a microplane and proceeded to grate a very generous amount of the truffle on top of my martini. He then explained the martini and the 4 different items on the plate and the best way to consume my ""experience."" He then wished us bon appetite and slipped away.

First the martini: It was all the wonderfulness that is foie gras and more. It has hints of honey and vanilla and a fluffy luxurious texture. It is also earthy which is complemented by the black truffle. It was honestly mind blowing! 

The accompaniments: a poached apple with 5 spice powder creme anglaise, nutella ice cream, macerated raspberries and huckleberries, and toast points. Each item was delicious on its own but when paired with the martini brought out different flavor experiences which made the martini even more mind blowing.

This was more than just a drink, it was an amazing culinary experience. Of all the decadent delights in Las Vegas the Fois Gras martini experience truly stands out. This is now on my ""must-do"" list for future Vegas trips. Oh, and it is less than $20.",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,6,5,5,BhCUV_Npi4wF2JyBLS-pyA

You will absolutely love their presentation. So pretty you'd think they were Japanese presentation masters. Below the surface, however, mixed reviews here.

Loved their escargot (can't really mess that up), and wowed by the foie gras terrine. Absolutely a must.

The Dover sole came highly recommended, but I actually felt it was only slightly above average. Good, but nothing outstanding.

The lamb dish was good. Again, nothing phenomenal.

The mid-cut ribeye was very good, especially if you opted for truffle butter. Potato purée was a good accompaniment. 

Now, this is where things got interestingly amazing. We had pre-ordered the soufflé at the beginning, which is standard. Having been only slightly appreciative of the entree, I honestly wasn't looking forward to dessert.

Boy.

Was.

I.

Surprised.

Oh my god. Their soufflé was incredible. Did not see it coming. I'm a soufflé snob, but was humbled this evening. We ordered both the carrot cake and coconut soufflés. I don't even like carrot cake, but it had the most excellent balance of sweet and savory that I simply could not stop eating it. 

But the coconut soufflé.... 

....... I saw heaven. Incroyable!!

I could go on and on. Andre's is an absolutely stunning restaurant in the Monte Carlo hotel. From the outside, it looks like a tiny corner restaurant but step in and it's beautiful. 

The BF and I sat in a small private room. It was filled with chandeliers and romantic lighting. The service was wonderful. We used a coupon from travelzoo that entitled us to a three course meal with a house cocktail. We both ordered the same things and the food was delicious. 

We started with the lobster bisque. I was amazed by the size of the portions! The soup filled me up so much that I couldn't finish any other course. It was prepared with three lobster balls and the bisque was served at the table. The taste of the bisque was absolute perfection. 

For our main course, we got the salmon. It was served with a flaky pastry with spinach. It reminded me of spanakopita. It also had three little shrimps with it. The salmon was cooked perfectly. It was very tender and moist. It was also topped with caviar. 

For dessert, we both ordered the chocolate soufflé cake. Our server came to our table and poured in the hot, melted chocolate into the center of the soufflé. Mmm. 

This would be a great restaurant for anyone celebrating or looking for a romantic and intimate meal with a loved one. It was truly a wonderful dining experience and I loved it!",9bZLIEwZsUP262-3bOEsnA,1,0,5,ZNnXyYxTP2nsjDhn99voPA

5057849,2010-01-11,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Compared to the grand scale of most Strip restaurants, Andre's has always been exceptionally intimate, the perfect place for an undistracted romantic repast. But while it was once all old world elegance, the room has now been remade with Art Deco motifs contrasting complementary patterns of blue, rust, cream and brown--still subdued, but also convivial and whimsical. The ample staff augments that spirit with warm but studious service. 

If you simply ordered a Caesar Salad (garnished with rare Tete de Moine cheese) and a fine Prime Angus Ribeye (finished in an inky pinot noir reduction) you would likely be happy here. But why not play a little? Rochat and his Chef de Cuisine Gary LaMorte produce some memorably creative turns on French classics augmented by fresh ingredients and peppy presentation. 

Be daring, as I was, and plunge into that signature Foie Gras Martini--half aperitif, half appetizer--the earthy fresh pate dissolved and shaken with chilled vodka and poured (over fresh huckleberries, on my visit) in a glass as tall as your eye level. An almost milkshaky savory sweet delight, it is a decadence best shared. 

Of the many worthy first courses, I could have happily entertained the caramelized pork belly, frisee & warm oxtail confit salad, traditional escargot, or the popular onion soup au gratin, but was happily diverted with the uncommon farm raised abalone, the toothy shellfish providing a worthy canvas to an heirloom tomato and almandine potage, balanced with a subtle celery root mousse in the shell. A Cajun-inspired spicy crayfish bisque en croute followed, hot and peppery with delicate meat. 

Though I've enjoyed Andre's elegantly delicate Dover Sole Veronique in the past, I was just as delighted with the modern take on Muscovy Duck Breast, lightly crusted and remarkably tender, accompanied by wild mushrooms, a tricolore of near-liquid gnocchi and a flourish of tart pomegranate sauce. Venison loin, vegetable risotto and veal pot au feu were other intriguing selections. Desserts follow suit with rousing revisions of the classics.

Such a meal of course practically demands the grape; Wine Director Claudio Vigani oversees a substantial but digestible list, bolstered by Burgundy and Bordeaux verticals but also offering impressive bottles from California and around the world.

Andre's has yet another hidden surprise in its upstairs cigar and cognac lounge, one of the only places left on the Strip dedicated to enjoying a leisurely smoke. With possibly the biggest cognac and brandy collection west of the Mississippi, it punctuates the experience with panache.",97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ,3,0,4,ZzNWRL5FzeLHvV0niJUOhQ

We started off with the Escargots, and for the first time having it, they were really good. The combination of the flavors blended well and the escargots were not too rubbery or hard. The only problem with it was that it was really not, and I nearly burned my tongue.

I had the Colorado Rack of Lamb and I think I'm willing to say that it was the best rack of lamb I've ever had. The tenderness and juiciness of the lamb was just perfect. It was very difficult for me to resist grabbing the rack with my hand and gnawing on the meat as if I was eating at home. Tucked underneath the rack of lamb was curried risotto w/goat cheese. It was a very interesting combo and loved how there was a slight kick of spiciness as an aftertaste to the risotto.

For someone who wants a change of pace to cheap eats or Las Vegas buffets, Andre's is definitely a place to go check out. If price is a worry, it might not be your first choice.

The ambiance was very intimate and quiet, despite the fact that it is next to the casino at Monte Carlo. I was with my mom and we both had a nice time.

Service: Friendly, respectful, nice!

Starters:

Bread: Crusty on the outside and soft and warm inside. Good sign.

Watercress salad: Came with thin slices of beef, parmesan shavings, lemon aioli, mushrooms, and toasted bread. AMAZING. We did not know what to expect when we ordered this, and we liked the very cute presentation. But the flavor of all these ingredients threw us back. I never had something so fresh and delicate on a piece of toasted bread! I guess molecular gastronomy experts know what they are doing. This all worked so well and was very impressive.

French onion soup: A big cup of very flavorful broth, caramelized onions, thick gooey cheese and bread. It was piping hot and so very good. I went with a soup I usually enjoy, and this did not disappoint.

Entree:

Steak: With broccolini and mashed potatoes. A deceptively simple dish. The steak was tender, the broccolini crunchy, and mashed potatoes were probably more butter than potato but I wasn't complaining. Everything was juicy and perfect.

Duck: Came with pieces of gnocchi, root veggies, and duck medallions. The medallions and sauce were too salty for me, but everything else in this dish was good. The duck was so soft and tender! I usually don't like duck but this was quite nice and did not have an overpowering taste.

Dessert:

Lemonade cake: Again, molecular gastronomy wins. This was amazing. I do not know exactly what the components to this dessert include, but it was sweet and tart and light and yummy.. just heavenly. I recommend this dessert.

Chocolate souffle: I went with the safe choice again-- something I knew. This was fluffy and not too sweet, very much chocolatey-- what more could I ask for?

We used the TravelZoo coupon for this place and I was glad I did. Not my favorite place to eat in Vegas, but this place is definitely worth a try if you are looking for someplace quiet and comfy but sophisticated. I would come back.",Z280VWXP4EsFtxoKosemRA,0,0,5,hQ-_CItpJPzt9EzMQLjw3w

First of all, this place is small...surprisingly small.  Downstairs is a bar...a single stool style bar...that's it.  You go upstairs, and the dining area is to the left.  It looked like there was about 4 tables that seat about 8 people each...that's it!  Even the bathroom is TINY, with the door pretty much hitting the guy if he is washing his hands, and almost the other guy at the single urinal...you kind of see where I am going with this lol.

But the cigar lounge is actually a good size, and the bar within it is very very impressive.  I came here for the WW, which included a tasting of 5 different types of Whiskey.  The whiskey themselves were not very memorable for my palate, but I was glad to have tried them!

However, what was memorable was the great conversation and intimate setting!  Everyone, from the servers, the bar staff, and my table's company were all great.  This was a very relaxed setting, and I had a wonderful time here.  The servers were also knowledgeable of their product, and answered any questions we had and talked about other drinks as well!

I just received an email with them saying that Whisk'y Wednesdays will be EVERY week now!  I can't say that I will be here every week, but when I run into a selection that I am curious about, you CAN'T beat the value and setting here!  Essentially AYCD for a nominal $25!

    After a completely magical experience here in April ('09), and a let down in Sep ('09), this evening on Halloween night was total redemption.  Not the magical experience of the first visit, because the first time was just so full of delightful surprises (that are now expectations), but the staff at Andre's made sure this was a night to remember.  
    My two dining companions and I arrived 10 minutes early, but our table was waiting.  A booth, and they graciously pulled the table out so we could sit without sliding around the bench.  The waiter was right there with menus and wine list, and cheerfully asked if he could get us anything to start and what type of water we would like; not the least sense of pressure, or disappointment when we opted for tap water and no cocktails.  
    The waiter had a very heavy Spanish accent, which made us concentrate hard to understand him - this was the only imperfection of the evening.  He was charming and knowledgeable, and spent a good deal of time explaining what seemed like half the items on the menu.  
    Once we decided on our choices, the waiter was right there to take the order.  The staff has a knack of staying out of sight, but very well aware of exactly where you're at and what you need.  My niece loves chocolate soufflé, but doesn't like the taste of coffee; the pre-order dessert included chocolate-kahlua soufflé.  She inquired, ""could I have this soufflé without the kahlua?""  ""But of course, we'll make it any way you want!""  
    Once the order was placed, the sommelier was right there.  Now, it was a little more awesome on our first visit when the sommelier found out what we had ordered before arriving at the table, but no complaints.  We had decided to share a bottle of wine, but we had a mix of meat and fish, and my niece has a strong preference for white or light reds.  Not a problem for the expert sommelier - he zeroed in on a red blend and asked us to trust him.  He brought it, opened it, and poured it into a decanter at the table - so that it would open up and soften to be more to my niece's liking.  He even said, ""if you don't like it, I'll take it back and bring you something else.""  She loved it; we all loved it - superb.
    First course (not counting the amuse bouche):  salad for me and soup for the others.  I had also ordered soup, which came next, but my companions had not ordered another starter.  But along with my soup came two special (full size) salads for them to eat so they wouldn't have to sit with nothing while I had my soup; the salads were, of course, comp'd.  What a great touch!  And, of course, the food was all great.  
    Main courses were all phenomenal - filet, lamb and swordfish.  During the main course, the chef came out, introduced himself and shook our hands.  He was making more than a token visit, genuinely concerned that we thoroughly enjoyed our food; it felt like very special treatment.
    I had let them know with the reservation that it was my niece's birthday.  The staff did not need reminding - they do their homework and pay close attention to every detail.  A special birthday dessert plate arrived, as well as our orders.  Everything was wonderful.
    Presentation, from the appearance of the food on the plates to the flair with which the entrees are simultaneously unveiled, is superb.
The staff at Andre's confirmed that there is no better service, anywhere.  And the food is unsurpassed as well - not just one or two dishes, but everything is consistently wonderful.  They are the epitome of class; always right there when you need them, yet do not intrude on your conversation or visibly hover.  They do not try to chat and be too friendly, but are charming, friendly and talkative if you invite them to be.  I ate at several high-end restaurants in LV this week, and while the food was great everywhere, no one comes close to Andre's for service and atmosphere.",hdUxcqJ8Ont_DvtVvv0Gtw,0,0,5,RDKgXAh20-gOxHufYP1cIg

I get more excited about restaurant week than I do my birthday - trying out fancy restaurants is a little obsession of mine. I check the menus weeks in advance, carefully plot out my week, and get so excited for trying new places. Andre's was one of the few total let downs I've had during restaurant week, unfortunately. 

The menu printed online for weeks before had duck as an entree choice. My husband, a friend, and I, all being duck freaks choose Andre's based on this. Unfortunately we got there and they had changed it to f-ing chicken. Honestly I don't get the whole chicken in fine dining thing. Chicken is for KFC, El Pollo Loco, or to be grilled on a salad. You can't get more boring than chicken. Chicken is my protein of last resort and not to be eaten at fancy restaurants. BOO. 

Already things are off on a bad foot, and then we get an awful waitress to boot. She's in her 50s and clearly very full of herself. When we ask for the restaurant week menu, she sighs and tries to talk us out of it! I thought this was for charity, lady. Then we ask about the restaurant week wine pairing and again says we shouldn't do that because it's only small glasses. Thanks, but no thanks. 

I had the scallop (which was tiny, but FAB, sadly the highlight of the meal), steak, and souffle. We added a foie gras. The foie gras was good, but like I always say, I nearly always like foie gras. It wasn't particularly memorable in this case. My steak was just steak. Nothing special there. Then it's time for dessert and it takes 45 minutes. After 30 minutes I complained to a bus boy (as out b*tch waitress was no where to be found) and finally 15 minutes later we get them. I mean I know souffles are fired to order, but damnit we orered these at the same time as our meal, figure it the f out. Our 3 course meal ended up taking over 3 hours. Not cool when it's a Tuesday night and my friend and I both wake up before 4 AM for work. There's leisurely dining then there's obnoxiously bad service. I've never spent well over $200 on dinner before and treated like complete crap. Oh and to add insult to injury the place was nearly empty as well. Ouch. I did send an email to the manager and got no response. I'm disappointed the downtown location is no longer in operation - I would have liked to try it.

5279619,2016-10-05,2,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Scheduled to shutter at Monte Carlo on Thursday, but already looking to regroup and reconcept the recently closed DW Bistro space, it was with two local Chefs that a final meal was enjoyed at Andre's Restaurant and Lounge on Friday evening, the several course fete stretching nearly 4.5 hours with much of the time passed chatting about what Chef Rochat and the cooks he has trained mean to this town.

Truly one of Las Vegas' classic dining rooms, white tablecloths draped across banquets, tables and curved alcoves, it was just past 7:00pm that the trio settled in at a four-top twice inhabited before and with a service led by Joe Marsco and Marc Boutiron it was with a semi-selected Carte Blanch from Chef Bulen that the night marched forward, a small amuse accompanying Champagne Cocktails tastefully leading things off.

Lightly playing Rat Pack and Jazz classics as always, the room approximately 3/4 full with several men occupying the Cigar Lounge upstairs, there is little doubt that announcements of pending closure have risen a sense of nostalgia in locals and visitors who probably should have visited more frequently prior, course one arriving with Chef Rochat's classic Frog Legs along with housemade Rillettes and Jumbo Shrimp snappy and sweet on a bed of boldly flavored Remoulade.

Offering the rare ""wedge"" worthy of ordering, Chef Bulen opting to divide the head of Lettuce in the kitchen before sending it out, a surprise follow-up of Chicken Forcemeat was topped tableside with an intense Broth that was simultaneously clear as crystal, a 'Chicken Soup' as much for the soul as it is for the technique involved and something that Chris suggested he hoped to explore further when he moves to Alize later this month.

Always a place where Foie Gras should not be ignored, both the Terrine and seared Steak with Apricots perfectly textured and substantial enough to share, a large crock of Boudin Noir was featured next as an off-menu special with classic underpinnings, the Stewed Apples and Onions imbued with the poignant flavor of Calvados.

Unable to resist one more round of Sole, the delicate flesh garnished in Brown Butter and Almonds, additional entrees entailed two large Pastas stuffed with King Crab and Peas in a creamy Citrus Sauce, the Rosy Duck Breast perched atop a Cake comprised of Confit and Chickpeas with Pan Sauce, Pickled Plums and Turmeric-tinged Carrot Puree.

Always enthralled  by Chef Tammy Alana's desserts, none new from the last visit though all remain industry standard and reason enough to visit Alize where her sweets stand to highlight the end of every diner's night, it was with broad smiles that the group sat speaking with the team for another forty-five minutes after the final Bradied Cherry had been consumed with a cup of Espresso, Sin City's constant reinvention sad on one hand, but at the same time always offering a new reason to be excited for things to come.

chocolate souffle - light, airy, rich chocolatey goodness.  My favorite part of the meal.

white chocolate raspberry souffle -  creamy and not overly sweet.  tangy raspberry with the smooth white chocolate sauce, too die for.

Highlights of the meal included the carpaccio, foie gras, rissotto, duck, and the cheese dishes.  All of the dishes were unique and excellent.  The presentation was top notch.

Their cocktails are good. Most of them are light and refreshing for the summer. It is a deal compared to the regular $14. I had the Moscow Mule and the And A Twist. The former was my favorite. The latter had too much residual sweetness to it. Both are light and scream quintessential summer drinks.

Got the Chef's tasting menu, which can be 5 or 7 course. Only the 7 course has foie gras as a choice, so got that. A wine pairing is available but really, one cocktail should suffice. The 7 course meal is really more like ten course all together, including amuse bouche and PRE-DESSERT! 

Highlight of the night: Chef Andre Rochat stopped at our table. I do get so excited when the chefs come out and check things out.

Most interesting cocktail is the Martini made with Foie - comes to table with an accompaniment of candied almonds, seared peaches, sugared mixed berries and a lemon sorbet. Very interesting and something you've gotta have at least once in your life.

you can pick all meat, or mix it up with the vegetarian choices.

Amuse bouche: braised beef croquette (one bite of crispy outside, creamy potato) plus a small bite of Jamon wrapped crisp breadstick. A promise of better things to come.

Beef carpaccio - tender delicate slices with a cirtusy aioli, peppery arugula, shaved Parmesan.

The following hot dishes were all served with a flourish of revealing the meal under a cloche. The staff would each open one cloche simultaneously with a ""Voila!"". 

Seared Foie gras - tender, beautifully seared, delicate flavor.

Seared jumbo scallop served on celery puree and saffron sauce -  perfect sear and mild flavor without being overpowered by the puree or sauce.. 

CRISPY PORK BELLY - pickled cherry sauce, cornbread purée
Tofu option was just as beautiful and good. 

PAN SEARED DUCK BREAST & DUCK SAUSAGE - spiced mango and duck jus, rissole of potatoes and artichoke - perfectly tender and cooked med-rare.
Risotto was too al dente for me and too bland for my taste. Served really hot off the pan - steaming.

Cheese course : TÊTE DE MOINE - rhubarb purée, candied almonds - comes to table in the form of a carnation ( shaved from the main round wheel, according to the waiter Ricardo)

SAINT ANDRÉ - triple cream, soft, rich, perfectaly paired with caramelized orange, toasted pistachios

PRE- DESSERT of a semi-fredo orange pannacotta. At this point I was VERY full and VERY happy with my meal and it was not yet over!

WARM CHOCOLATE FLOURLESS FONDANT vanilla bean ice cream and cocoa crisp (sort of de riguer these days, but also very good)

5387573,2012-09-18,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Romantic and intimate dining experience.  We dined around 8:30 on Saturday evening of Restaurant Week.  When I booked the reservation earlier in the day I had requested a cozy booth, which they explained they were busy, but would make an effort to accommodate if possible.  Upon arrival, there were about 5 other tables dining.  They showed us to our lovely round shaped booth reminiscent of something you would see in a romantic film.

As soon as our water was poured we were treated with an amuse bouche of creme caviar, which means ""amusement for the mouth"" in French.  The amuse bouche is a small bite before the meal begins in which the chef welcomes you to his cooking style and gives you a hint for what lies ahead.  My palate was dancing with the intensity of flavors from a single bite sized morsel.  As the flavor swirled about my palate I knew that I was in for a real treat as I watched the wait staff serve other diners from a wheeled cart, in which each dish was covered with fancy silver cloches. Does it make me a total dorko for feeling giddy and thinking ""neato""?

Since this was my first time dining at Andre's I did a little homework prior to our arrival, and discovered that the most popular dish among the restaurant staff is the Pan seared foie gras with poached apples & creme anglaise.  It's been years since I've had foie gras.  This dish was without a doubt the single best thing that slide onto my fork that night, maybe even in the past year.  The foie gras was so rich, buttery, and melty on my tongue, in fact I would describe the flavor of what you might expect if butter was a meat.  The creme sauce was so delicious that had I not been in a fine dining establishment, I would have licked the plate clean!

We were now ready to start with the 4 course restaurant week menu, which we opted to add the additional wine pairing package.  First course consisted of a roasted corn soup with warm crab, garlic chips & chive oil paired with a Reisling.  Delish for me, but they didn't have an alternative dish set up for people who are allergic to shellfish, such as poor Dave.  

Second course was a butter lettuce salad with a (small) crispy duck confit, toasted almonds in a cherry vinaigrette paired with an old world style Chardonnay.  It was tasty, but mostly lettuce and little else.

Third course was a choice of: 
1) Grilled rib eye cap with potato cake, broccolini in a horseradish beef jus 
2) Pan seared chicken breast with panzanella & balsamic chicken jus 
3) Seared Scottish salmon on a  heirloom tomato with spinach gnocchi in a truffle beurre blanc sauce

He selected the real winner here with the grilled rib eye cap.  What a wonderful, perfectly cooked, succulent piece of meat.  Being on a mission to find the best salmon buerre blanc since I first tried the mind-blowing dish at Morel's (during the Spring 2012 Restaurant Week) led me to order the salmon, which did not compare to Morel's at all.  First of all this course was paired with a heavy GSM red wine regardless of which dish was selected.  The wine completely overpowered the fish.  I asked if I could have something else, which they said they're not supposed to do, but would try.  They asked if there was one of the previous wine pairings that I would like to revisit.  I asked for the Chardonnay, however was served the Reisling, then the server disappeared and did not come back to check on us.  Secondly, the salmon was overcooked and a little dry.  Third, the spinach gnocchi was also overcooked and a downright odd pairing with the salmon.   Thumbs up for Dave's tender grilled rib eye cap, but not so much for my salmon dish.

Fourth course was a rich flourless chocolate cake with coconut lime sauce and dried bananas along the side.  Explosively rich and delectable, which we ended up taking home in a to-go box.

The other real shocker was the loud club-like music playing just outside the restaurant in the casino.  There was a runway where dancers were performing for the surrounding poker tables, in which the music was blasting.  Every time the door to the dining room opened and closed, the loud music blasted into the small area that was otherwise filled with soft, romantic music.  The casino might consider relocating the dance runway to another location further away from an intimate, not to mention expensive restaurant.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,2,1,3,lN_sHtsJgmtq5QYWa53mng

Reservations were made at the last minute because hubby decided he wanted to eat at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon- but they no reservations until the following week???  And as it was Saturday we decided to go out, of course most places were full.  But we got into Andre's.  

The only negative is getting in and out of the booths at this place, but other than that, the service was really good and the food just as good as the service.  We honestly didn't have one complaint.  

I started off with Pork Rillette Pate (which hubby liked and shared with me), he had lobster bisque and I had their french onion soup.  Then instead of a full entree, I opted for the foie gras terrine while he had the scallops with side order of potato puree.  We ordered the chocolate souffle and that was different than other places and quite delectable.

One item to note is that the seared foie gras appetizer is updated as well.  We really enjoyed this presentation because it had the perfect balance of sweet / savory.  We like our foie savory but wanted to try the new menu.  We would order it again like that as well.

Our dinners were excellent and we had the wife's leftover bits of steak for breakfast straight out of the ice chest (remember it is the MC).  The service is always top notch and that keeps us coming back.

5529596,2011-02-20,3,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Valentine's day dinner and so thankful they didn't do a lame pre-fix menu for the ""holiday"". The reviews were pretty much solid and really helped with what to order. I honestly had my mind made up before I went into the place :) 

Started with a couple of champagne cocktails at the bar before going upstairs to the main dining area which were great. Then the hostess let us through the elevator door while she shot up the stairs to meet us as soon as our doors opened. We were seated by the wall across from the elevator entrance. While this wasn't the best area...this place isn't really that big so I couldn't be picky for such a busy evening. It turns out it wasn't a big deal since there were that many people coming after us since our reservation was at 8:30. Might be a little annoying during peak hours. 

Staff was great. Everyone from the bartenders downstairs to the hostess to the sommelier and servers. All top notch. 

Appetizers: 

Pan-seared foie gras, caramelized apple, five-spice crème anglaise, port wine reduction: This was simply incredible. The apples and creme really gave it a great mix of flavor. I could've had this as an entree!! This dish will be the biggest reason I come back. 

Bison carpaccio: I thought this was just ok. There would be no way to tell that this was bison vs cow but the presentation was unique and tasted great with the truffle and watercress. 

On a side note...I REALLY wanted the escargot but my wife isn't that big a fan. I also questioned whether 3 appetizers for 2 people seemed excessive. 

Entrees: 

I had to go with the lamb since so many of the Yelpers said it was the best lamb they'd ever had. Awesome dish. I went with medium rare but I think I should've opted for medium. The cous cous that sucked up all the lamb juice and side of squash were great companions to the lamb itself. 

My wife went with her usual filet mignon. Pretty good but its hard to justify the price with so many great steak places in LV. If Carnevino's filet is a 10..this was a 7 at best. 

Thank god we ordered the chocolate/strawberry souffle in advance. Otherwise we probably would've been too stuffed to order it after the entrees. So worth it!! 

I also liked the cigar lounge.  Comfy chairs with a fireplace really set a nice mood.  Perfect place to finish off your bottle of wine after dinner.   

Overall a solid v-day dinner!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,6,4,4,E5yx0_CHqvneTIEj3m-NhQ

I felt that the value for the money was right on. Everything was made to perfection, and the wine pairings were creative. I especially liked the pear liqueur at the the end. My friend raved about it to the waiter, and was rewarded with a second pouring. That was the end of his sobriety.

The location is unusual, as it's right off the dated gaming floor, in the bowels of the Monte Carlo. BUT, walk in and you will be transported immediately to class and pampering.

5550085,2010-12-01,1,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Ah a restaurant I forgot to review during restaurant week!

My husband and I had a show at the Pub we were attending, and it was restaurant week.  At the last minute before we went to the show, we decided to make a reservation and try yet another Michelin Star restaurant.  And, like some of the other Michelin Star restaurants I have been to in Las Vegas, this was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I just don't think the food warrants the prices they charge, even for restaurant week.  We also got the wine pairings, and I was annoyed they poured barely a sip of each wine.

For appetizer:  I had the Seared Diver Scallop (yes one scallop).  It was good, and it had some caviar that was tasty on top.  I just wished there was at least two or three scallops on the plate.  My husband had the french onion soup and he thought it was delicious, but he enjoys the Mon Ami Gabi version more.

Main Course:  I had the free range chicken, husband had the fillet of beef.  I found the chicken to be fairly lackluster, and I feel like I've had better.  If you've read Candace's review of Alize in the Palms of the chicken there, this is practically the same dish.  I didn't really want to finish it, but my husband liked it.  His fillet was okay, but we've had better at other restaurants, such as Stripsteak.  As I said, this is a Michelin Star restaurant so I expected much better.

Desert:  I had the souffle of the day, a raspberry souffle with chambord sauce.  This was good, but I haven't had desert souffles before to compare.  I liked it mainly because it wasn't too sweet if you avoid the sauce.  My blood sugar thanked me for this desert.  My husband on the other hand had the creme brulee which was pretty delicious and well made.  But I liked my less sweet souffle better.

All in all this was an ok meal.  But honestly, had it not been for restaurant week I wouldn't have gone here, and I wouldn't go here to pay for a regular meal.  

I want to mention the decor, because normally I feel ok in high end restaurants, except for this one.  I felt completely out of place.  Being in this restaurant was like being in a museum.  And the service is good, but they had the food in metal covers, and had the waiter raise them at our table at the same time.

I had the Dover sole, simply spectacular, I would highly reccomend it. 

My date had the veal and she absolutely loved it.

It's a little tricky to find, being at the very front enterance to the Monte Carlo, but definately worth checking out.",KPeskfzCntleJCs5UwT3Gg,1,1,5,baQIKT6wBchjfO32bwy6PA

We ordered the scallop appetizer & foie gras. They're both super yummy! For my entree, I ordered the RIbeye w blue cheese topping n it was also super yummy! The souflees were also delicious.  :)

I honestly think this place makes the best foie gras everrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Writing this review makes me miss her n wish we could come back here one day for another lovely dinner.",Zh196G7CVa9mcIz6Dk9U5g,1,0,5,wB4TO9DY_nYc8NQ7uwJ4PQ

I did get the travelzoo voucher- I highly recommend that, unless money is no object for you. :) The french onion soup was the best I've ever had- and my wife got the crfeme brulee, we both agreed it was the best we've ever tasted. The chocolate truffles and chocolate souffle were also wonderful. Only thing I did not love was the lobster bisque- but that's also because it's very rich, too rich for my taste.

Highly recommend the bar upstairs as well. Hate the cigar smoke, but the $25 tasting of 5 scotches on whisky Wednesday was amazing!",mEUv8wNyavGb8MDdb_WF8w,0,0,5,jWCe_H4axpOmS2wFzaOLnQ

More importantly i will miss my time at your cigar and cocktail lounge upstairs. With that I look forward to a new chapter of my dining experience on your next adventure.

5768619,2012-02-08,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Excellent food, beverages and service in a decidedly French Restaurant atmosphere. We had a wonderful time with a party of 4, the service was superb. the food was tasty and excellent quality. I ordered what the menu described as a Ribeye Steak, but it looked and tasted like a particularly tender and flavorful Filet Mignon.  The souffle and sorbets for desert were superb.  I recommend this restaurant and would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the server misrepresented the size of the deserts, insisting they were small single serve portions not suitable for sharing, when in fact the desserts were very large servings very much suitable for sharing... The sorbets were three full scoops! This made us feel like we had been ""sold"" on ordering extra desserts, which was quite ""tacky"" for such an otherwise superior example of a French Restaurant.",LTjtaa2tuAYWv17a93PVsA,1,0,4,PBc0SZ-MNSNf2uyDuUZzPA
5778401,2015-12-18,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"Oh my goodness. Came here on a Saturday evening and was surprised to see it was mostly deserted. We used a Travelzoo voucher that made the meal $99 for two 3-course dinners with drinks.
I had the beef carpaccio which was good, but my date had the lobster bisque, which blew both of us away. I didn't know I liked lobster until I tried it at Andre's. We ordered the special: 2 Australian lobster tails (not part of deal) and it was seriously 100% the most delicious thing I have ever tasted. I still dream about that lobster. I'm afraid to try any other lobster now.
My date and I both got the grilled flat iron steak, which was tasty but nothing special and a little heavy.
My date got the chocolate souffle for dessert, which he loved - for me personally it was too heavy but I prefer light desserts like custard and mousse - which is why I got the creme brulee trio. Another winner here, probably the 3rd time in my life when I've had absolutely EXCELLENT creme brulee. The trio is composed of traditional, coconut and pineapple, and while the variations were intriguing, I will always prefer the traditional kind.
Unfortunately I cannot remember the cocktails we ordered but they were well-made (date is a former upscale bartender). 
Service was excellent! Waiter was on point and extremely attentive, our plates were removed and replaced within minutes of each other. This could change with patron volume, however.",2rlmRoNsfWqldTtIbODxmw,0,0,5,kshZAJ-s7pscGQbFMlIu-g

i took my best friend here on her bday. i love the decor. its really beautiful inside.

we had all kinds of things. 

we ordered the scallop appetizer & foie gras. They were both Phenomenal.

My best friend is a foie gras fanatic and she says this is the best place she's ever had it.

i honestly dont remember what we had for the entree, but i remember it was really good too.

we had souffles for dessert which were perfect as well. i love this place. its french at its finest. and even though i spend $210 on dinner (including the gratuity), it wasnt so bad because we each had soup, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and two desserts. Theres many places on the strip that would charge much more! i love this place i want to go back!!!",xWCDD4AVIVjDfLZp5Qc5yQ,3,3,5,HEbD0wWfVc3b6iozmWtPNA
5839869,2010-04-04,0,pmoIMK8zGWvKsVOPDBYfzg,"We went to Andre's at the Monte Carlo in March 2010. The first impression was how small the dining room was. Compared to the typical grandeur Las Vegas fine dining scene, it was quite intimate. 

We had the chef tasting menu and a foie gras martini. The foie gras martini was truly amazing. Chef LaMorte came out and shaved golden truffle on my drink, and it was heavenly. Even better, when he learned that I loved foie gras, he added the foie gras terrine into our menu. The creamy, smooth texture accompanied by the toasted brioche was definitely another highlight of the evening. 

Between my husband and I, we had 15 dishes total-- and that did not include the bread, the amuse bouche, the intermezzo, and the handmade chocolates at the end. Every dish was sent out with a beautiful presentation, and the smell was wonderful. From the bread with three flavored butters to the sweets that came with the bill, we had a lovely three hours at the Andre's. 

My husband and I both gave Andre's an 8 on a 10-point scale. We think the chef was artistic but a little more reserved when it came to temperature: the scallop was not caramelized enough and was still cold in the center; the pan-seared foie gras, although delicious, could use a little more caramelization, so did the duck. The veal cheek was very tender, so was the pork belly. The only drawback is that the pork belly was a little bit too salty and cheesy to our taste. But it may be just our preference. 

Although every dish was only a small bite, at the end we were pretty full. I wasn't sure if I had room for desserts. Fortunately the dessert plate, composed with three tiny desserts, was delicate and delicious. It was a perfect ending for the night. 

Overall we had a great experience at the Andre's. I am most impressed with how personable the chef was. He came out checking on every table a couple of times and engaged a wonderful conversation with us during several dishes. The service was attentive and professional. The host was friendly; the waitress, on the other hand, was helpful but condescending, a little bit snobby, and quite pushy. Luckily, none of that ruined our dinner. 

I would definitely recommend Andre's to whomever wants a quiet dinner in Las Vegas.",rYduaRSe23tF3_LvSYc0lA,0,1,4,N6OAz07ml6C1Qg5wjsjMTg

2. Most amazing food!
-- lamb that is not overdone.  I've never had it so ""less-cooked"" before.  Not a huge fan of lamb, but it was amazing, and I appreciate how it was done correctly!
-- chocolate soufflé.  Fluffiest I've ever had in my life.  A masterpiece.

Funny how when it's just outrageously amazing, there's not much to say!

I will be back for sure!

Thanks! :)",WFcDOsTSZwOHE77H_bL1fA,0,0,5,1MhOYUvnd72CD9BmP2IavQ
