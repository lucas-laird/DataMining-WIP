REMEMBER TO TIP THE DELIVERY DRIVER. $5.00 OR 20.0% (WHICHEVER IS GREATER!)",nYx1r_QQIqbE2JsUrtimkQ,0,0,3,a7Cy_peQ-QV_GbHwMp4tXg

I wouldn't have purchased it if I had known, but I guess that's why they didn't tell me before I bought it. Displeased.",NBF9Yaro5nBsmwNUquP4HQ,1,0,1,y_wmz1YCeb2F_3Px6BtUPQ

The pasta is done to perfection with a great flavor. My son ordered the lava cakes and says they are delicious. The delivery guy was super nice! I will definitely order from this location again.

If I say I want oregano and seasoning on my pizza guess what ? I expect oregano and seasoning on my pizza and if you forgot to deliver my items I paid my hard earned money for and I let you know my items weren't delivered guess what I expect you to send someone to deliver them or for you to refund my money , not just steal my money for stuff you haven't sold to me ....This location really sucks!!",n-mXNepLHuSjwYykm_zzuA,0,0,1,Tnr3e0qzllsBfW7cdVeaiA

The delivery women asked me 3 times if i paid her enough,  not sure if she was hinting that I didn't tip her for being late or if she didn't know how to do math.  Pizza and chicken was cold even though it's 98Â° outside.  Won't be ordering from here again.",RJ-KUfpnqJdfuG05odFoBQ,0,0,1,4MMN9BEQ3wa-Tld3xMIWZg
