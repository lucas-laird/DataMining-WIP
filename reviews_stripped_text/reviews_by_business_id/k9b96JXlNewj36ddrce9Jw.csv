Great vegan food that is fresh and creative and extremely delicious! Their beer-battered avocado and BBQ pulled jack fruit tacos are so good! But the fave is definitely the philly cheeze steak sandwhich made out of seitan. Meat gobblers wouldn't be able to tell the difference! Overall, what matters most about these wonderful people, is that they not only serve up gorgeously good food,but they are all plant-based, Non-GMO, use locally whenever possible and omit all refined ingredients.

Their tacos are amazing and they seem to regularly change up their menu, which is nice. I cannot leave their tent without grabbing some of their fresh made Jaimica. 

It is one of those rare vegan places where you are staring at the menu for 15 minutes because you just can't choose. Family run and very friendly. I haven't tried their vegan cheesecakes, but they seem like a crowd favorite. I would 10/10 recommend the Garden Grill to any vegan, or meat eater, that enjoys food!

Four stars due to a website that is not kept updated. There have been multiple times where i have traveled across the valley to find this ""food truck"" in their regular spots, but they are not there. After i find this out and check their website, there is nothing there saying that they cancelled that day. Apparently they keep their Instagram updated very well; however, for those of us who don't use Instagram, it would be nice to see that the website is updated.

1380966,2014-03-11,6,k9b96JXlNewj36ddrce9Jw,"What can I say about Garden Grill?

It's amazing.

I have tried all of her food and I must say her tacos are amazing and they are my fav. Pull up a chair and let me explain...

I think out of the four styles I am in love with the fried avocado one the most! When you bite into the crisp tempura-like thick batter then you reach the creamy avocado center...I just don't think anything else compares. There is really something magical about it.

The breakfast style taco is super good and it reminds me of how hubby makes his morning scramble. Kala Namak salt, turmeric....all the yummys make up that scramble and I love that flavor! 

The famous cheez steak is not my fav...burn me at the stake if you must...I'm just not a fan. I do love the bread but I'm not a fan of faux beef and fajita type grilled onions and peppers. I also like my cheese a more golden silk like cheez lol. Makes zero sense other than the fact I was never a fan preveg so my opinion is invalid.
Just try it for yourself...actually it's huge so ask a friend to help you eat it.

I'm a serious fan of jackfruit pulled BBQ. I try to make it at least once a month because I love me some slaw and baked beans...well pride aside...there is something seriously amazing about her BBQ sauce. It's amazing and she should bottle it. The crunch of the slaw and the tang of the BBQ sauce...YUM!

The tacos are a food item that I crave, no joke I crave them. Heaven help me if she ever goes brick and mortar! 

Be on the lookout for that new Crispy Chick'n Sandwich! Oh and during the colder days the black bean soup in the bread bowl and the amazing albondigas soup...amazing.

Believe it or not, I have never tried her desserts!!!!!! If you try them report back to me because I'm not big sweets fan. Besides...I'm always too full from tacos :)

1444352,2015-06-04,0,k9b96JXlNewj36ddrce9Jw,"Amazing street taco place in Tivoli on Saturdays (but make sure you get there early)! When we first went a few months ago, we tried a few different tacos like the jackfruit and the beer battered avocado. They're so scrumptios- perfect for a snack to try their varieties.

After trying the tacos, now we always get a California burrito with the beer battered avocado instead of any ""meats"" and it's the best thing ever! The avocado cream says and the spicy red sauce that come with it are perfect for dipping and adding a little more flavour. We also always get the hibiscus tea and that is the bomb. Sweet and sour and perfect for hot weather. We go here almost every Saturday just to get this meal and it's always on point and never fails to satisfy.

Plus, the people who work here are so kind and the food comes out quick even with their ever present long lines! Hoping they will have some sort of food truck soon, so we can continue to have more vegan options right here in Summerlin, and have them be more frequent.

I don't think that you have to be vegan, vegetarian, fruitarian, or even observing Lent to appreciate Garden Grill. That California burrito could change the mind of even the biggest skeptic. For me, the convenience of enjoying their creative and delicious menu at the farmers market while my daughter runs around on the playground can't be beat, but I'd love to see this hardworking team open their own restaurant!

They make some of the most flavorful vegan food I've ever tried. You might request the sauces on the side if that's your preference, as some dishes tend to be heavy. You can't go wrong with their tacos and the beer-battered avocado is a good choice if you're not a fan of fake meats, but don't be scared of the amazing BBQ jackfruit! The crispy chikn sandwich will make you forget about Chick-Fil-A; get buffalo if you like it spicy. If you want to try a special that they post on special media, arrive early. They will sell out and you will be disappointed. It took me two attempts to score a California burrito. It's huge, packed full of asada, pinto beans, Mexican rice, fries, guacamole and more, and definitely worth $12. They even make a huge bacon burger with doughnut buns using Ronald's doughnuts.

I could go into detail about specific menu items, but I'm not even going to bother because I've discovered that you really can't go wrong no matter what you order here. Everything is seriously amazing.

As far as price goes, some might say it's a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth the few extra dollars. The food is so flavorful, they use local and organic ingredients when possible, and the people are super friendly. I'm currently transitioning to veganism, and Garden Grill definitely helps satisfy the occasional meat cravings. I've seen their food win over my vegan and non-vegan friends time and time again.

There's a reason why these people are gaining popularity so quickly, and I highly suggest you come find out why for yourself!",m3SYuv7IhJ47T0smsYWLXw,3,1,5,3E-7Pu_KBKnOKAIrfPRyuA

Last night I got to the Bruce Trent farmer's market later than usual so they were all sold out of them. Guess I'm not the only one digging on those tacos! So I decided to try the philly cheezesteak. Wow! I was, once again, blown away and my taste buds were thoroughly impressed. 
I was unable to finish the whole thing because it's huge, so I took the rest home and my omni Dad stole and devoured it. Never told him it was vegan, but since he knows I don't eat meat he probably guessed. He wanted to get their location and dates so he could stop by after work and get one for himself. Vegan food is just salads by bottom! 
I don't know what these guys do to make their food so delicious, but they need to keep doing it! I love everything I have tried so far. Next time I will have to venture into their dessert items, but I don't know if I should start down that slippery road...

Much like a great pizza is enhanced by the crust, a great fried avocado is enhanced by the batter. You can tell that Garden Grill LV pays attention to detail. The batter was excellent in taste and crunch, and the two sauces worked very well together. The jackfruit asada was a little spicy and sour... Just the way I like it. The breakfast burrito was also great. The sausage they use is a little salty, but it's fairly well balanced as a whole... Especially with so much spinach. I guess if I had to change one thing it would be to cut the sausage bits smaller and use less. Finally, the horchata was incredible. Best vegan horchata I've ever had. Not too sweet...

So you can imagine my utter joy when I found Garden Grill at the farmers market. I ordered 2 of each, Beer-Battered Avocado, BBQ Pulled Jackfruit and Chick'n Teriyaki. As I bit into my first taco, which was the avocado one, I felt these flavors just burst into my mouth and I cried of joy. I honestly could have never  imagined  such flavors bringing me to tears. As I enjoyed the next one, BBQ Pulled Jackfruit I lost it...I was so emotional eating these tacos.

I had the jackfruit quesadilla, which in my opinion was wayyyyyy overpriced ($10). It wasn't a good portion size, it was an average sized tortilla. They drenched it in 2 sauces, not sure what they were, but it was a lot.  I'm guessing vegan sour cream & a green one, maybe avocado cream? Anyway, the sauces are really rich so I scraped it off.

I took my entire family to the Farmers Market and we all ate different dishes at Garden Grill, and keep in mind half of my family are not vegans. Anyway, they were SHOCKED and wanted more because it was so delicious.

1. Food- 10/10
I cannot say enough about the food, everything was perfectly flavored! The crispy chicken sandwiches were PERFECT...seriously so crunchy and so tasty. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The tacos were AMAZING with the delicious sauce they put on it- was just so so so so good. My favorite was the buffalo chicken sandwich- tasted like crunchy hot wings in a bun. I'm seriously going to be here every weekend. Amazing. 

2. Service- 10/10
The guy helping us was so nice, and so friendly- he has the best customer service and even helped take some overload of food to a nearby table. He asked to make sure that everything was great, which it was. Also the food was done within 15 minutes and we ordered 6 different things from the menu. Great service. 

3. Price- 10/10
Nothing was crazy expensive, and for the quality I feel like it should have cost more! But please don't do that! haha 


Everyone seriously needs to try this place out, even if you aren't vegan...TRUST ME when I say you wont be able to tell the difference. It was just so incredibly great. I really wish they opened a restaurant because I would be there every day ahha

I'm always skeptical when a restaurant has 5 stars with over 50 reviews, but I came to Garden Grill with an open mind.  And man, this place is very good.  Plant-based ingredients, terrific dishes, and surprisingly large portions.  The meal had a hangover cure feel to it as the sandwiches were full of heavy ingredients and sauce and bread, but still terrific.  The California Burrito ($12) was the size of a large Chipotle, full of beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, plant-based steak, cheese, and french fries.  I could have done without the french fries and cheese but the rest of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The hot sauce was awesome as well; don't forget to get extra.  The buffalo chicken sandwich ($10) had  a little too much sauce, but the meat itself was so flavorful that I'll give the sauce overload a pass. Add the great coleslaw on the sandwich and we have a winner. 

The prices are of a sit down brunch spot overall but the portions are big and service was great and quick. The bread greatly underperformed in my opinion on the sandwich as well as the tortilla for the burrito, which is the main reason I'm knocking Garden Grill down from a 5 star experience.  I do really like that they park specifically at Farmer's Market which show the spot's freshness.  I would come here often if they opened a storefront.

I'm ashamed of myself for not having written a review sooner but I am glad that I have been able to enjoy their food a few times before I can give them a solid A+ rating.

Their ""chicken"" sandwich is the best sandwich I have had since becoming a vegetarian, 8 years ago. The breading might as well be real chicken skin (and I know that might be weird for some vegetarian/vegans, but I LOVE IT!!) I miss chicken the most, of all of the meat, and their sandwich has a huge portion of it, along with tomato, romaine, and a sauce like an aoli all on a toasted bun. It's filling as hell and is like vegan comfort food. 

I've gotten the deep-fried battered avocado taco as well as the carne asada, I think... The avocado was AMAZING and is by-far the most ordered meal from them. I mean, who doesn't love a beer-battered avocado deep fried and topped with some delicious sauces?? Heaven!! 

Ooh! Almost forgot to mention that their horchata is perfect!  it tastes like cinnamon toast crunch. Their jamaica (hibiscus tea) is rich and flavorful and I've heard it's the best you can get in the valley. Justtttt make sure to keep the lid on because that stuff will stain! A gorgeous purple color, but still a stain. :P

These men and women work SO hard to make some of the best food in the valley for damn good prices.

I looked on the map and the original place we wanted to try was in the opposite direction of the dam.  So we decided to scratch that plan and see what was up with the Las Vegas Farmer's Market.  I searched for Farmer's Markets on Yelp and found Fresh52 located on Sundays at Sansone Park Place which was in the direction of the Hoover Dam. It was the perfect pit stop to the dam!

As we were walking through the Farmer's Market we found Garden Grill - an all vegan food stand specializing in tacos!  I was a happy girl as I stared at their mouthwatering display of tacos with creative fillings such as  - beer battered avocado, BBQ pulled jackfruit, chick'n teriyaki, asada jackfruit, breakfast, and plant-based steak.  Everything looked so delicious!  Not only did they have tacos, but they were also serving up philly cheeze steak sandwiches and specials like chick'n and waffles.  

My BF and I ordered two tacos each (2 beer battered avocado, BBQ jackfruit, and breakfast) and split the chick'n and waffles.  We were both in heaven as we ate our tacos - they were all so good!  I was happy that our chick'n and waffles also came WITH mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy; I don't see that too often with my experience with vegan chick'n and waffles in the Bay.  The chick'n was perfectly crunchy, waffle was perfectly crispy and mash and gravy was savory and delicious.  We were fighting for the last bite of waffle.  LOL.

We had plans to be in Vegas for the weekend. Because we were gonna be in town, I entered to win tickets to the Life Is Beautiful music festival. Then I won two 3-day VIP passes thanks to Yelp LA West CM Brittany F.! Immediately did my research and discovered that Garden Grill was going to be serving up some vegan goodies at the festival.

Sh*t just got real!

At this point, I didn't even care about the bands anymore (except for Fitz and the Tantrums). All I could think about was BBQ Pulled Jackfruit Tacos and Beer Battered Avocado Tacos.

The line was surprisingly long. I didn't realize vegan food would be so popular at a music festival. But I guess that's a good thing. Each taco was offered at two for $8 but sadly they wouldn't let you mix and match that day. Later on I discovered that there's a Yelp check-in offer for $1 off your first order that I wish I knew about before hand. I also noticed that the taco prices listed on their website is $1 less than what they offered it for at the festival. Damn those festival prices!

Great BBQ flavor in the Jackfruit Tacos and I liked the crunchy mix of shredded cabbage in there. The creamy dill sauce on top was tasty too. http://bit.ly/1E7np5J

The portion was much smaller than I would have liked it to be for $8. Let's just say, on the drive back to LA, I stopped by a vegan market/cafe (Viva La Vegan in Rancho Cucamonga) and their jackfruit tacos were a much bigger and filling size at $3 a taco.

I was still hungry after eating Garden Grill's jackfruit tacos so I ended up ordering the Beer Battered Avocado Tacos in which the serving size was significantly bigger. Large chunks of avocado batter fried in a way that doesn't make the avocado taste cooked (which I prefer). More crunchy shredded cabbage and a delicious creamy cilantro pepita dressing and Sriracha. It's very messy to eat but yum yum yum yum YUM! http://bit.ly/1yKXca0

The meateater BF was curious about the menu too so he ordered a Chick'n Ceasar Salad Wrap with grilled chick'n, ceasar dressing, croutons and romaine lettuce wrapped in a yummy spinach tortilla. I thought it was tasty! The meateater BF said he liked it better than the meaty prime beef sandwich from T-bones Chophouse a few tents down from Garden Grill. Yay for hooking the meateater! http://bit.ly/10DEeac

Yeah it's kinda pricey but the sad truth is, I would pay that much for their deliciousness. They get 5-stars from me! I just wish I had room for the Raw Chocolate Cheezecake while we were there.",53dkR4-xyhjsCVHfrwiGaQ,4,3,5,GS579mwNAsXbXjK5tJLktA

5542547,2015-05-13,4,k9b96JXlNewj36ddrce9Jw,"Garden Grill is the main reason I make the trip to our farmers markets. So far I have only tried their tacos. If im speaking from a mexican food point of view their flavors are delicous and authentic, if im speaking from a vegan point of view its the same thing! Im not a vegan but I still love it when a restaurant can take something so familiar like tacos and make it completly vegan and still have that same comfort food experience. Plus where else would I be able to try Jackfruit? So far I havn't seen it on any other menus around town. 
There tacos are usually 2 for $7 so on my last visit I ordered the bbq jackfruit and the beet battered avocado tacos. Both were very tasty. I loved that the avocado taco came with a very beautiful and generous slice of a nice ripe and creamy quality avocado. And I'm not sure if they make there own tortillas or not but they are soft and delicious!
the only critiscm I can offer is that they sauces or salsa's could be a little spicier in my opnion. But other than that what ever Garden Grill is doing I hope they keep on doing it!",xBMH3N0Fbua5pDtG1Y1mYQ,6,3,5,V_KSAi87ulOlzAJaPJN51A

Drove to the farmers market in Vegas (coming from Denver) and had to check this place out. My girlfriend and I each ordered a breakfast, jackfruit, and battered avocado taco with an agua fresca jamaica. Let me just say... WOW! The tea was extremely delicious and refreshing and complimented the meal nicely. Each of the tacos were savory and perfectly balanced between texture, spice and sweetness. Though I enjoyed all of the tacos, my favorite was the jackfruit! While trying to convince me of buying her a second jackfruit taco, my girlfriend said ""If I can relive the best moment of my life for $3.50, I'll do it!"" 

I highly recommend checking this place out no matter your dietary preferences or needs.",R8-Yg7wWz3soag5FKeshBQ,2,2,5,E1XQqEzOmX1MRvpT9Fl6ng

We've tried them all & my wife had and absolutely LOVED the Chik'n Sammich. Another weekend we tried the Vegan Pozole which since we are now vegan we don't ever get to have unless we make it. So tasty good !! The cabbage, lemon & onions complimented it perfectly. Memories of our childhoods came rushing back. You don't realize the power food has to elicit emotion until you taste something this good. 

Everything we have tried from the Philly Cheez Steak to the yummy desserts have been top shelf perfect. Amazing culinary talent here & really super nice family people. 

Also, some people gave less than stellar reviews based mostly on price. I've been coming to Fresh 52 for years now & now know some of the other vendors. NO ONE IS GETTING RICH AT THE FARMER'S MARKET !! They use such high quality ingredients & have to work so hard to bring you this food that they love so much that some weeks they don't even make $$. They count on the busy times to make up for the slow times where they actually lose $$. They have no backers & do this all on their own. 

So everyone come support something so unique & delicious in Las Vegas !!!",e336oNvU26amR71Ibo5AZQ,1,0,5,Y_YfOjcasALBnSt8Lys6vg

This I've tried:

Beer-battered avocado tacos: the sauce reaaaally makes the taco for me (and of course, the avocados)

Chicken sandwich: their ""chicken"" patty tastes so much better than real chicken patties in my opinion. The sauce they use in this sandwich is really good too and I love that they have avocados in there as well.

The Thrillist: basically the chicken sandwich but with donut (yes, DONUT) buns and soy bacon strips. I felt really adventurous that day, but honestly I like the regular chicken sandwich a lot more.

BBQ pulled jackfruit tacos: very tangy, not my favorite since it was too BBQ-ey, but still very tasty.

Beer-battered mushrooms with a side of aioli sauce: my favorite side dish! The mushrooms were MASSIVE & very juicy. Once again, the sauce really made this one for me too.",rtOP1AmOHbZv9yQ7VI8InA,4,3,5,k-FQlum8kqJyl3ImsH_BNg
