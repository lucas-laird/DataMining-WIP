49487,2013-11-04,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Pretty good hot pot place in Vegas. I love the Little sheep Mongolian hot pot in CA so its hard to replace. 

Good price for AYCE and the items are fresh. 

They have about 4-6 fridges along the back wall of the restaurant that each contain items that are individually wrapped and sorted and portioned. From different vegetables, mushrooms, meats, tofu, and pumpkin. They also have a sauce station with a variety of  house made sauces, chili sauces, green onions, cilantro, and garlic. Everything you need to make your dipping sauce. 

They also have a seafood station where you can choose from clams, muscles, crab legs, shrimp (peel and eat with head-on) and fish that is sliced.

The soup base for me is  little plain but they give you two choices. You can either split your both in 1/2 with one side regular stock and the other side spicy stock or you can choose to make it a full pot regular or full pot spicy. 

I personally don't really care for the sauces that they have there. They don't taste quite right to me. No matter how much I mix the house made peanut sauce with the house made sate sauce I can't get the taste exactly to my liking. But they do give you a great variety to choose from. 

clean, pretty good service, and they also have a side menu for cooked for fried items that you can order from the kitchen which they limit you to four orders per person. 

the fried tofu that they offer is our favorite and they lamb chops they serve are pretty good as well since they don't have that gamey flavor.",zm5ZxCeFYT4GD8u4v60D-Q,1,0,3,UkvTVyQba9igeKNJFDoxRg

We stopped in looking for a simple soup as we had just left the dentist and the patient couldn't really chew :).   First impressions were that the decor was very cool, it was clean and inviting.  The staff was incredibly friendly and took the time to explain everything.  Terry was our server and I think he is officially the friendliest, most helpful person I've run into in a long time.  He explained how things worked, made great suggestions and was attentive without being overbearing.  We had a simple broth with chicken and tofu that I don't think was technically on the menu but was awesome, and the fried rice with chicken.  The flavor was excellent & the service was outstanding.   Another server, Hi'i stopped by our table too just to be sure everything was good.  Super positive experience, we will definitely be back when we can both chew!

Located in the same center as Sushi Mon, Thai House, and Full House BBQ, I tend to turn to this place when I'm craving shabu shabu which involves cooking meat, seafood items, noodles, and veggies in a spicy or regular broth.

You'll find a fridge which holds all the food items ranging from crab, crawfish, scallops, oyster, lamb, beef slices, chicken, liver, tofu, noodles, options of vegetables, and more. I can't verify how fresh these are, so make sure you cook them all the way through! Also, be sure to season your broth and check out their sauce station. Tip: if you need more broth, there's caraffes towards the back of the room to refill.

The most recent time I've been here, I've noticed a few changes. Prices have gone up from $20 to $25; they've removed their two appetizers per person from their kitchen option, transitioned over to paper plates, but have added a Thai station with asian desserts. I honestly don't mind the changes and their Thai station offers some pretty good items like thai dumplings, papaya salad, coconut milk desserts, and panna cotta.

This place fulfills any shabu shabu craving you may have. I've always enjoyed interactive dining and you'll get that here along with a happy belly. 3.5 stars overall!",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,3,2,3,3sfYIUUy-BmDCUQbo-n-Zw

With that being said, there are somethings I think they need to improve. 

1. Service - very disorganize, I think only 2 server had prior restaurant experience. Although they are all very nice but 80% of the time they are not very efficient and not very helpful. 

2. The shabu pot itself and stove was VERY worm out, its already lost its original shape. Kind of worries me when the pot is tilting towards me with a pot full of boiling soup.

But overall, I would recommend the place for a casual family or friends gathering. Although the shabu meat quality isn't the best, but make sure u try their lamb chop and fried chicken wings (dinner menu), SOOOO GOOD!",YQ6HzQjpZeUGyY7zho_TbQ,0,0,4,DU4iY4nvnfJSiE4zVozVsQ

792355,2015-11-20,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Sooo I hadn't been to Shabu Grill since early this year, but I had decent memories so was feeling excited to try it again. 

A few minor gripes:
-Friday night, but no Thai station! So no fried rice or any of the small Thai dishes. Which can be understandable, but to charge diners the same full price for dinner when a component of the experience was missing felt a bit like a rip-off.

-Weather was cold outside, and it felt even colder inside. Perhaps so diners don't get overheated by the piping hot broth?

-Some of the employees didn't wear a uniform, so it was at times hard to tell if they were just a regular patron standing/walking around or not

-One of the employees asked if we wanted more broth poured in. Turns out ""more broth"" meant plain water, which diluted our broths.

Some of the good:
-The selection of veggies seemed to have increased slightly. And some of the items seemed to be on plastic plates now instead of all on the styrofoam plates. 

-Still love their sauces. They make for good dipping sauces, and to add to your broth. Favorite is their tamarind sauce.

The quality of the meats and seafood aren't the best, but what can you expect for AYCE. We usually get the original and spicy mongolian broth. Unfortunately neither has any flavor on their own, so flavoring them up with garlic, green onions, cilantro, jalapeno, soy sauce, etc is a must! But thankfully you can customize it to your taste.  Next time we'll try the tom yum broth and see how that goes.  

To get your money's worth, definitely don't come here if you're in a rush. Relax, graze, eat, then eat some more.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,3,_ci3zXswToqWMHkesTWjPA

We requested for half tom yum and half plain water. There's a reasoning behind this. 

As we eat only halal/kosher meat, we weren't able to take the chicken based broths they provided. 

However, they accommodated us by making the tom yum broth with a mix of water and Tom yum paste. As for the plain water half, I made my own concoction with the sauces and condiments from the sauce station. 

After ordering the broths, we proceed to picking all the goodies. We went for just the seafood and vegetables. They were all fresh and contrary to another review, the vegetables were well-cleaned. 

My only ""beef"" with this place is the fish ball is not properly labelled. I took a plate of the fishball. After cooking it and cutting it in half, I saw meat in it. I later confirmed with a staff that there's actually pork in it. So pescatarians beware. It's not fish roe. 

The service wasn't so bad. They are quick to clear the empty plates. Water was refilled often too. Maybe we were there on a good day. 

They also had a variety of desserts. I came specifically for a Thai dessert, khanom buang that's on their website. They didn't have it this weekend but it's alright. They had plenty of other options.

The restraint has a pot of bowling broth in the center of the table and you go to fridges and select what you want to cook. The food just didn't have enough flavor in my opinion. However there is a small selection of food that you can have cooked by the chefs in the kitchen. The beef tenderloins were amazing and did have a ton of flavor if you do go herein strongly recommend eating here. The service was the main reason for the two stars I would often have to wave several times to get the attention of one of the three servers and it was not busy at all there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant. Even when the servers would stop by the table to grab some of the empty plates it was hard to get their attention to ask them for something. One even walked away when I was in the middle of ordering another dish. Also the ice in the drinks had a very odd chemical odor however I didn't notice a taste difference.

1375818,2014-06-08,5,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Ah the Shabu Grill.. This is a tough review. It's like I wanna give it 5 stars, but at the same time, I want to give it 1 star. There are big reasons for each. I shall go into detail.

First of all, which has already been stated many times, it's 13.99 for ayce lunch, and 19.99 for dinner. For shabu shabu, it's a great deal. That's where the 5 stars come in. Unfortunately, some of the food items were a big let down.

I came in during lunch. I was given the choice of a hot or regular broth. They also said I can get half and half. I chose the latter. The broth is kept warm in the middle of the table that has a stove in the middle. After tasting both broths, I noticed that they were pretty bland. (Nearing the end of my meal, a different waitress told me that there were seasoning items located in the bar area, I wish I had known that sooner.)

I grabbed hold of some items at the fridges where they kept their food. I first grabbed some seafood. The shrimp were pretty good. They were large and sweet. The octopus was tasty as well. Unfortunately, the squid and the fish filet smelled funky. No chancing this one. (After I told the waitress, another waitress came back later and said it wasn't spoiled it was .... you know the drill....I stopped listening, didn't want to hear it...)

Tried some meat items as well. I liked the pork and beef cuts. They were good as well. But you have to realize that I'm still dipping this in my bland broth. Then finished it off with veggies and egg noodles, which were ok, but the napa cabbage was pretty bitter, even after boiling them for a long time..

The best thing I tried was probably the tofu, it got really soft after boiling it for a while and it was nice. The pork wontons tasted weird I thought.

While almost through finishing my meat items, a different waitress than the one  that had first seated me comes and see's and asks me why I don't have any sauces. I'm like ""Sauces?"" And she's like ""There on the counter near the bar"". I'm like ""Great.."" So I go over and grab the Thai chili sauce and some ponzu sauce. I also grabbed a ton of chopped garlic, cilantro, ginger, and lots of S.A.L.T.!!! I dumped all of these items (not the sauces) into both broths. Holy crap, what a difference seasoning can make. And the sauces here are killer! After dipping some meat into the seasoned broth and then into sauces, it was really good.

Well, there you have it. I would come back, probably during dinner so that I can try some of the entrees that aren't available during lunch. And I would get just the tofu, and meats. I would season my broth AND get my sauces before eating anything. But, I would come here just to try, I don't see myself being a regular.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,9,7,3,pYogGgscmOq9OEndPjuI2A

We added a bunch of different stuff to our broth, including tofu, salmon, broccoli, cabbage, and beef; we enjoyed it all and our bowl was pretty much empty toward the end. 

The one thing I would've liked was an explanation of what the heck we were supposed to do. They brought the broth out and left, and we sat their like morons. When we finally flagged down our waitress, she explained that we had to go pick out what we wanted and add it ourselves.

Let me remind you once again that this was my first time trying hot pot. The waiter said, ""spicy, original or half and half?"" I had no idea what he was referring to, but my boyfriend knew a little and decided on half and half. The hot pot got to our table and the waiter walked away, leaving us confused. Were we supposed to go to fridge ourselves and get the food? There were no menus or directions on how hot pot works, so we were even further confused. I finally asked a waitress how hot pot works and she gave us the basics.

After grabbing meat, seafood and tofu and dipping sauces we started cooking. This is where it got fun and tasty! I enjoyed the hot pot experience of cooking your own meat, seafood and tofu. The workers were great at picking up empty plates and keeping our table clear. 

I was disappointed that the workers assumed we knew what we were doing when clearly we didn't.

By the way, for some reason, this complex rocks!  We have experienced three excellent restaurant choices here:  Sushi-Mon, Thai House, and now, Shabu Grille.

When we arrived, it was packed (a good sign!).  We were seated in the back room and were waited by 5 different people.  It was awesome.  For an asian restaurant, this was refreshing.  They were attentive and really took care of us.

We basically ordered the AYCE hotpot.  We were told to head over to the refrigerator and pick and choose what we need.  In the fridge, there were:

1. Lobster
2. Crabs
3. Shrimp
4. Mushrooms (Asian strands)
5. Beef,
6. Pork
7. Various veggies

It was a buffet dream baby!!  Only complaint is that the plates used to pile on the stuff were awfully small and flat.  It was tricky to keep it on the plate.  Because, it was flat, it would easily slide off.  Would recommend they buy BOWLS (plastic is fine).  This can be easily remedied.

In addition to the hot pot buffet, there is also a side menu (included in AYCE) that you can order.  We ordered wings, seaweed salad, edaname, and several other goodies.

Dinner definitely filling!

Food - 5 Stars
Service - 5 Stars (surprisingly! Excellent)

My party was seated when we got there and they gave us a list of appetizers to choose from with a limit of 3 per person. After checking what you want, you basically walk over to their fridge and it's a free for all. To be honest, I was kind of disgusted by the fridge because it just had plates of exposed meat lying inside for god knows how long. I stuck to a lot of the vegetables.

The hot pot itself had two sides, a spicy side, and a non-spicy side that was divided, like most hot pots. The meat, as I expected, was not very tasty. But, it wasn't horrible. I stuck with the beef, the lamb was too gross. Halfway through our meal we got all of our appetizers, and at that point I didn't even feel like eating them, I was too into cooking in the hot pot.

I would say the highlight of the meal was drinking the soup broth after cooking a lot of vegetables and seafood in it the whole night. It was flavorful and satisfying.

Our server was very attentive and refilled our water constantly while taking away all our used plates every time there was a small pile. He also left us a teapot of water to refill our soups when we needed it.

If this place was closer to my house, I would consider coming back sometime. But I think for me, hot pot is better left at home.",utjpVFySRyXGM-X9znTq0Q,1,0,3,IHAhF5zJrwGJ3mLACegy9A

Shabu Grill has two flavors of soup - spicy and regular. We did half/half. I went for regular while someone else in my party went with spicy. The regular really doesn't have any flavor which was disappointing since I've had curry soup before and that was delicious, but I got over it because it was time to start cooking food.

The fridge had several different types of vegetables, like spinach and pumpkin, and meats, like pork belly, shrimp, and crab legs. There is a sauce station, but I only grabbed green onions to toss into my half of the hot pot because I'm not much of a sauce person.

There is no front of the house at this restaurant. I mean literally... There is no hostess stand, no ""please wait to be seated"" sign, just nothing. My friends and I stood in a crowd (I can't even say it was a line because it wasn't.) I made my way to the front and asked how long the wait is. The place looked semi-busy and I'm totally cool with waiting for good food, but this kind of chaos for a 10 minute wait was just unprofessional. After being seated and being 80% through a delicious meal, our broth was running low. We had to flag down a waiter to get more broth. They literally just poured water into our broth... No seasoning or anything. It wasn't even broth/stock that was being poured into my hotpot... After finishing our meal, we waited another 20 minutes just to be able to flag down our waiter to get our dessert and another 10 minutes just to get our check. Lastly, the name itself is very misleading. Shabu-shabu is Japanese themed, whilst Shabu Grill is very Thai themed. There's also nothing you would actually grill here either. The only thing that's even cooked on anything resembling a grill would be the kra nom krok (Thai coconut pudding dessert.)

It's just a shame such a great idea is ruined by bad employees and disorganized management. However, even with all the complaints, I may still go if I'm really craving some good hot pot. #firstworldproblems",P0Zd9BjnCgbfzsHiQFdhoA,1,1,3,J05qg7Fjx4Q779laI8r09Q

This was my very first time to have this type of a meal.  There's nothing better than a leisurely meal with friends, sharing food, ideas, experiences.  Thanks Marie T. for teaching me what to do.  Following her lead, we proceeded to the glass front refrigerators storing seafood, beef, pork, noodles, vegetables to cook in the steaming pots.  I went back to the area with the sauces and condiments and pulled together garlic, green onions, jalapenos and some hot sauce.  

I loved how the bok choy absorbed the flavors of the broth.  Next went in salmon, squid, shrimp, fish balls, mussels, white fish.  I then realized I could order off the menu and it was included in the all you can eat price.  So I had the dragon shrimp, lettuce wraps, pork chops.  

Included in the AYCE was dessert so I ordered the strawberry ice cream which seemed to be everyone's favorite. 

At the end of the meal, I watched Debbie ladle up the broth after everyone had cooked in it.  What a great idea, it will have all the flavors and nutrients of the evening.  I am going to try that tip next time, too.",VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg,2,2,5,bhTHTKc12IC2DaUxxOuefw

1930698,2013-08-20,3,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Shabu/Hotpot has always been an iffy for me due to the illusion of 'all you can eat'. Is it really 'all you can eat' if you gotta wait for reloads of meat and veggie plates? Yes and No. Sure they'll bring you plate after plate after plate but you're at the establishment's mercy.

Enter Shabu Grill. 

Aside from specialty items and desserts which i'll go into later the setup is truely all you can eat but you're still at the establishment's mercy for a few items. 

I like the way this place is setup. Three (i think) food services grade fridges are stocked with meat, seafood, and veggies as well as a carton of eggs for your impending gluttony. No more asking for that 18th plate of rib eye just to see how small the portion sizes are coming and spare the server's feet he/she's been walking all damn day. That's replace with three big-ass fridges that are kept stocked with food. I'd love to see a little more variety when it comes to the veggies but that's just me nitpicking. 

The sauce station is well stocked but VERY overwhelming. There's just so many damn choices. If you dont know what you're doing, you'll end up with some weird 'little bit of everything' sauce that tastes like a nightmare. Would be extremely if they posted a sign for recommended combinations.

Alright so now the reason for the three stars. Honestly i'd give this place a solid 3.5 if possible. Everything you need to get hot potted out the door is readily available to you at limitless quantities. Now the specialty items as well as the desserts are limited and some just need to go back to the drawing board. 

The lamb chops are a hit or miss. One person at our table didnt like them but i ended up loving them. The seasonings arent that great but the lamb itself is on the gamey side which i like. Meat stuffed mushrooms...yeah go ahead and pass on these. Fried tofu was good, not too oily, still soft and tender on the inside.

Okay i forgot what they're called but they're little fish that have been deep fried and you eat them head to tail whole. They contain roe which is why you order them. ORDER THEM! Order these tasty sons of bitches. Order six. They wont let you? Order six anyway. The manager is coming out? Good that means more hands to carry the TWELVE orders of these mofos. They called the police? Good! Have them stop by the seafood market and pick up a few more boxes of these tasty pregnant fish.

So overall go for the limitless option of hot pot, dont expect much from the specialties menu except for them fish i was talking about, and for dessert just go for the ice cream, either strawberry or vanilla. Other options are lacking. Like the coconut rice and mango i've been hearing about...lacking as in it wasnt even on the menu at time of dining.

*EDIT*
Just bumped them up one star. Saw the transaction on my card for how much this place costs. Not too shabby once the food to cost ratio is factored in.

My glass was never empty. For the value, I recommend this place over regular buffets. They have options for just about everyone. For vegetarians and vegans, they have lots of veggies available -- tofu, spinach, mushrooms, celery, cilantro, green onions, various types of noodles (rice, vermicelli, udon, etc.), seaweed salad, all very fresh. 

And of course, there's lots of seafood options as well. The flounder filet is delicious; I lost count of how many plates I had. It's especially good dipped in Ponzu sauce and sesame oil. The squid, clams, and fish balls were great as well. 

I used a RNG (Random Number Generator) to pick some items from the menu. #6 came up twice...Chicken Cake. I had no idea what that was, nor did it sound too appealing.

The duck spicy basil noodles were delicious though ! They didn't ask how spicy we wanted it... so it ended up pretty spicy and i would've preferred it to be a little less, but other than that ... it was great. They didn't skimp out on the duck either which was good.

The hostess explained how it worked to us very well & the service was excellent (staff refilled our drinks, added broth to our pot, and checked on us frequently). We went with the spicy broth, but had it refilled with the plain chicken broth. I agree that the broth was ""plain"", but I liked that we got to add as much (or as little) garlic, ginger, cilantro, green onions, lemon, and jalapeños as we wanted...so as we cooked the meats, shellfish, and vegetables, the broth got more flavorful along the way.

Chicken, shrimp, pork wontons, tofu, and liver servings were individually wrapped, as were the different noodle offerings and some of the vegetables. Sliced meats were portioned out in individual trays (beef, lamb, pork, pork belly). The rest were offered in bins for you to put as much, or as little, as you desired. Selections included: clams, mussels, squid, octopus, lobster, snow crab, fish ball, fish cake, fish (sole?), broccoli, baby bok choy, mushrooms, pumpkin, taro...there was more, but I can't recall them all.

They offer an assortment of sauces to dip your meats and veggies in: ponzu, BBQ (like hoisin, but lighter in flavor and texture), peanut (similar to satay dipping sauce), Thai (a little spicy with a little sweetness to it, really good for the octopus), and 1-2 more that I didn't try and can't remember...sorry.

Dinner comes with 3 appetizers per person. If you are a lamb lover, definitely pick the lamb chop for one of them (it was oh so yummy). You also get a scoop of ice cream for dessert.

2) We sat down, and the same lady AGAIN mentions, ""DONT TOUCH the knob (duh). We close at 11, so make sure you get the food, and hurry"" SOMETHING like that, I couldn't quite understand her. Keep in mind, it's not 11 yet.

3) We get our food, and she comes back yet again to ask if we are okay... And AGAIN MENTIONS that they are closing soon!! Talk about pressure! 

4) Another lady comes and this one is better. She somewhat apologizes for the other lady telling us to hurry and tells us we can eat until it closes. Thanks lady! She then gives us more rice like we asked for and puts it on our table because they're starting to put everything away.... At 10:15pm??

5) Not okay, they're mopping, cleaning, and putting food away WHILE we are eating. I couldn't help but NOT enjoy the rest of my time eating while also checking the time because I felt like we were the ones disrespecting the time.

6) overall, NOT enjoyable like how we used

The FOOD. Definitely not for you to WOW. 3 pieces of vegetable, 2 thin pieces of meat, frozen seafood on the plates. Seriously? Can't you just put more in 1 plate so there won't be tons of work to do for dishwashers. No signs for anything they put out for dessert. How do you suppose to know what is what? 
SERVICE. I got charged $36 gratuity automatically because there was 6 people of us. I wasn't mad at $36. I was mad that I didn't deserve to pay that amount of the money because I didn't get served well. Let me tell you about the girl who served us. We sat behind the reception table so that girl was sitting there on her phone constantly. She picked up the empty plates only TWICE during our meal. NO drink refill. NO table touch. NO smile. NO thank you. Do you think she deserved $36? She thought that she got my $36 anyway that's why she didn't offer anything on her end.
I came here last year and it was better. That's why i came back this year with my friends. But the service and the food embarrassed me so bad that I won't be coming back.",dQaki9vmqkGkoStjWe_RTA,4,0,1,cCgDF2NbH5mKoTxl7_UFrg

The first item as an eggplant dish.  It never arrived and we kept asking for it and some lamb chops.  We were presented with our bill instead.  Finally 1 lamb chop arrived and we still had to ask again for the eggplant dish.  When the eggplant dish finally arrived, it had the most nasty old grease smell that I almost lost my dinner from the smell.  My wife took one bite and passed.  We tipped our standard $1 for bad service on our $50 meal.  Oh yea, that AYCE price might be less than $20, but it does not include drinks.  At least I got a refill of the lemonade, the only thing I enjoyed.  If you like AYCE places, this might be your thing.

Came in on a weekday, around 1 or 2pm. It was my first time, and I was a little weary, because it was dead! I almost left because the receptionist seemed like she was too busy on the phone to seat me. Fortunately, a lone employee was doing some cleaning in the corner, noticed me, and sat me down.    The place was spotless... it smelled like bleach (at least you knew it was clean). I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do--she kind of left me to my own vices, no menu, no explanation. Then she came back and asked whether I would like spicy or regular soup or both. She clarified the whole ordering process when she saw the confused look on my face (it didn't help that her English was poor). You choose the soup: regular, spicy, or both--meaning they split the pot down the middle so you can have best of both worlds, then you get up and physically handpick your meats/seafood, veggies, and sauces on to a plate and bring it back to your table to cook up in your boiling hot pot.  I was pretty impressed by the variety they had.  They had shrimp, clams, mussels, squid, pork belly, pork, beef, and huge selection of veggies to add to your concoction!  It was all kept in a market style fridge/freezer (the kind that you can see through and open). Everything smelled and looked pretty fresh! The selection of sauces and condiments allowed you to flavor your soup to your liking. I really enjoyed the built-in gas stoves at each table, including the bar. I haven't seen a shabu place in Vegas that's set up like this. In addition to the hot pots, you can order food from the kitchen (this is considered the dinner all you can eat, which is $19). 

All in all, I enjoyed myself. I left full and satisfied. The service was so so, but the cleanliness, the food selection, and pricing all makes up for that.",t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,1,1,4,lXu5MtBdtVR6yRdDPdshVw

At first, I was skeptical since it was just me and Dad at the restaurant at first but more people trickled through out the meal. The server came by frequently to refill our waters and add broth.  The dishes of meat are perfectly portioned and  the quality is top tier. The meats are thinly sliced and well marinated. It does help that there is a wide variety of sauces to choose from and different foods too. I was fond of the sauce station where you could control the amounts and types of ingredients to select from.  I was very impressed and the price you simply cannot beat for all you can eat at mid-day. 
You can let the server know if you want hot, spicy or a not spicy chicken broth or 2 of the 3 split in a pot. I highly recommend the squid, tripe, fish fillets, shrimp, thinly sliced beef, fish cakes, soft tofu, Asian vegetables, and the pork belly. I hardly touched my water cup until the end. If you are not stuffed quite yet then you can either get a bowl or a few spoonfuls of the broth.

I am really talking about scraps here.  Keep in mind that they close at 11 pm! We asked twice for desserts and all we got was a confused smile. The lady appeared to be the manager or the owner  but she just blew us off. The friggin meal was almost $30. per person and we surely should have been treated better than that.

I've been to a few shabu places in my day and am used to ordering the meats from the server, but  here, you walk up to the fridge and get it yourself, so there's no wait. They offer a variety of items including beef, lamb, pork, squid, mussels, shrimp and a large selection of vegetables. You can grab as much as you like, but just keep in mind they charge if you have extensive leftovers. 

You then bring your uncooked items back to your table where there is a boiling pot of two broths, spicy and non-spicy. The menu has the cook times for each item so you won't end up with a rubbery piece of meat. You then cook your food in the broth and scoop it out and enjoy. Don't forget to use different utensils with your raw and cooked items as not to cross contaminate. They also offer a variety of cooked appetizers that you can order so you have something to munch on while waiting for your items to cook. There is a sauce station as well with different herbs and spices, to cater to everyone's taste. 

My favorites were the mussels, lamb and pumpkin. I cooked them in the spicy broth and dipped them in my ponzu/sesame oil/cilantro/garlic/chili/green onion concoction. It was quite tastey. My favorite appetizer by far was the fried tofu. Crispy, light and melt in our mouth. Not rubbery at all. Don't forget dessert is included. Strawberry, vanilla, green tea ice cream and mango pudding. I heard the green tea ice cream was not good so I opted for the safe choice, vanilla. I definitely had food coma after this meal.

Be observant and scan all your options.  This is way more than a shabu shabu place.  I lived near Tokyo's shinjuku district with plenty of shabu shabu places to chose from.  This place took shabu shabu to a whole new level. I'm not sure if it was Kobe beef but it was extremely lean and tender.

Helpful hint: visit the sauce bar first.  Pass on the prawns and crab legs as I think we tend to over cook them and they get soggy. Don't be afraid of the liver also it was surprisingly very tasty.

The concept is amazing, ayce + hot pot is equal to heaven. The sauce bar is amazing, everything you'd find at a normal hot pot. But the funny thing is one of the workers put the salt under sugar and vice versa so for a few minutes I was wondering why my meat I was dipping in the sauce was sweet!!

- service needs to change. It's like they don't want you there.

- some food items even when cooked still taste like freezer burn
- desserts at dinner can be skipped they aren't very good

The decor is modern, the music is fun, the place is very clean and they also have 3 big screen TVs. The restaurant is Asian Fusion mixing, Thai, Chinese, and Korean dishes. Having never been to a restaurant like this, the staff  was very friendly and helpful in explaining the different things on the menu. My friend and I decided to try the shabu shabu (hot pot), the grill and we ordered pineapple fried rice as one of our sides. Every thing on the menu is very reasonably priced. For the shabu shabu, you get to pick out 2 sauces to cook your food in, we picked coconut milk and the spicy chinese ones. You also get to pick out the different  tray of meats and vegetables you want to cook in them. Each tray of food is individually priced but very reasonable. We picked chicken, beef, mushrooms, and a separate tray of veggies, every thing was very fresh. We also picked Korean short ribs for the grill. We had a lot of questions for our waitress, she helped us cook all our food and came to check on us several times in case we had any additional questions for her.  For dessert we tried the mango sticky rice, it was very refreshing. I was very impressed at how good the food was and how much food we got for the price we paid.

3318270,2014-12-11,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"I was a little disappointed with this place compared to the last time I was here. 

I remember dinner was under $20 last time I was here. Granted it was a while ago and things could have changed, it jumped to $25, almost the price of an AYCE sushi dinner. I only went here before because it was cheaper, but since the price gap is closed, it's almost worth just going to an AYCE sushi place unless you really want some hot pot. 

They now offer more seafoods such as oyster, scallops, lobster, and crab legs. They are more expensive pieces of food, so that is where you can justify the price increase. The lobster that they put in the fridge for you to get through, are not meaty pieces of lobster. It seems like they take out the meatiest part of the lobster and store it away for themselves, or they just get the less meaty parts of the lobster. A few lobster pieces I got were 95% shell and it was incredibly hard to get the meat. It's like not having lobster at all. Everything else is the same, the meat, vegetables. They chaged the island in the middle and now they have some Thai specialty stuff, dessert, and a few Thai dishes. Another change that I personally don't like that they made was the change from washable plates and bowls, to plastic and styrofoam plates. They only put a few pieces of meat on a plate and then the plate is gone forever. At least when they had the ceramic plates, it could just be washed, but they probably were going through too many dishes, which is understandable, but I don't like the extra waste that they are producing because of it. 

Yeah this place is still good for what it is, but the changes that have been made are making me less inclined to come back.",hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg,2,0,3,WOsvCwLdoybxnl4Wn1h7qw

All the meat and seafood is frozen solid in the fridge.
Then you can taste the quality of he meat once it's cooked.
Not the best for the price.
USUALLY with that kind of quality I'd give a lower rating. It because they're AYCE I can understand a bit why.

They have A TON (50... 60, maybe?) of options for you to cook at your table shabu style, and yes, as the name implies, you can keep going back for more. Veggies, starches, seafood, any kind of meat you want, desserts, etc. 

My only gripe was that the waiter didn't really explain what Shabu was or how to do it (maybe they don't get many newbies?) so i found myself weirdly staring down other customers to find out what the heck to do. In a nutshell, you add your ingredients to a hotpot broth on your table stove, adjust heat and wait... making sure you time things right (mushrooms are different than beef is different than shrimp) to eat it all at the same time at the correct done-ness.

Also, no alcohol. That was kind of a bummer. But it speaks volumes that i still enjoyed the meal in the absence of that. My advice: go with a pro your first time, or don't be afraid to ask questions unless you want to be the creepy staring guy like me.

The BBQ  is the same concept as Shabu Shabu. It's a la carte which I like because I like tasting a little bit of everything. I'm also trying to watch my diet so I take a little bit of meat at a time and make sure I don't overdo it.

We got the pork belly, beef and kalbi ribs. They provide a bunch of different types of sauces to dip your meat in but I didn't need it. The meat was really marinated. So much so that it was too salty for my taste. I had a side of fried rice which was good. 

I ordered boba again and the pearls were undercooked. 

The service is attentive and friendly. I love the prices. For everything we ordered, and I was full, it came out to $28 for dinner and that included two drinks.

I was really craving hotpot because Lu Gi's in california was a life changer.  I came across this place and decided to give this place a go. 

This place is all-you-can-eat, you get to choose two soup bases (we opt for regular and spicy), the meat, vegetables,  and other items we self serve in fridges, and a sauce station (you can build your own sauce for dipping). 

I came during lunch because after reading some of the reviews, I was doubting it would be as great. I was wrong, this place is really fucking good. I can just only imagine what they serve during dinner time. I created my own sauce (peanut sauce, soy sauce, hot chili oil, a squeeze of lemon,  and seseme oil) and had ponzo just by itself. It was so bomb. 

If you're not into the whole waiting for your meat to cook in boiling soup, then this isnt for you. Trust me, by the end of your meal the soup is so full of flavor when you wait to put your noodles in at the end, best noodles you'll ever have.

2 waters

Me and my husband walked through the doors and there was no one at the counter to greet us. We browsed through the menu and liked the prices and were intrigued by emphasis on all you can eat at a shabu shabu place since that's unusual. A host brought us to the back room and sat us down. He asked us what type of broth we wanted and went to get it. When he came back he set the broth bowl down and turned the burner on. There were two ladies to our right that were experiencing shabu grill for the first time too. we talked about how this was our first experience and where we have experienced shabu shabu before. We waited around 10-15 mins and the waiter didn't come back to give us drinks or menus infact he told us to take a picture of the menu with our phones, we walked around the restaurant to finally realize that we were suppose to get our own things and when we sat down they finally brought us water. Our waiter only asked us once in the whole 2 1/2 hours we were there if we needed anything. A majority of them were cleaning and not caring about customer service. Both my husband and the ladies to our right were disgusted by the horrible service we were given and aren't going to be coming back. We had to ask for our checks in which the server said to walk to the front to pay and there was no one there again.. we paid but to be honest there wasn't anyone paying attention to the customers and anyone could have slipped out and not have paid. 

My first time experience would have been better if there was a person at the door to greet me and my husband with a warm welcome to the shabu grill. A tour of the place if we never came here before and a menu when we sat down so we could plan what we wanted to eat. Sample cups of the broth would have been great to the new comers that haven't experienced shabu before or wanted to know the restaurants blends in broth.The customer service here needs to be focus on customers not bussing tables.

I've had hot pot before and this place did not deliver anything close to my expectations. This in no way was Japanese, it was mainly Thai which was even more confusing. 

Since it was our first time we asked for help. NO ONE could explain anything to us properly. They couldn't even explain how it all works or give us any tips. Which was a huge red flag and we should have left then. 

SERVICE: Was horrible, the guy only came to refill our water once. No one was helpful at all. The people that worked there even seemed to be confused by each other.

FOOD: Broth was tasteless (even the spicy one) we thought if we kept adding items in it would help, but it didn't. The food quality was a F-. I could honestly say we all felt unsafe eating that food. I only took one bite out everything before putting it back down, and pushing my bowl away. 

CLEANLINESS: A majority of the silverware was dirty, and Disgusting. We had to send some back for new ones. Even the tongs I grabbed to dip the meat had food build up on it. I ended up haveing to use chopsticks the entire time.  

SAFETY: The tables were dangerous. There was no barrier from the gas stove in the middle of the table from underneath. My girlfriend burned her leg/knee from the burner under the table, and screamed in pain from it. All the staff rushed over, but didn't do much but turned it off, and tried to set up a ""portable burner"" on top of the table. The whole situation was very awkward.

PRICING: OUTRAGEOUS. Save your money. I never been more disappointed paying $30 a person for what seemed to be undoubtedly a low-end Asian buffet. For a table of 3 the bill ended being $100 which was shocking and very displeasing.",MmXSPen6VitSuX_A_Fn53g,3,0,1,TfuAEXWCmDaCHhfT8ddZGQ

I didn't like any of the broths they have. The curry was kind of weird, which is a shame because it sounded promising.

The quality of meat is really sub par. I've been to a lot of places that had the same price points and had a way higher quality of meat. They keep everything on a styrofoam with Saran Wrap. The environment is definitely not something they're concerned about.

I was very impressed with the variety, especially the seafood: 3 different types of crab, scallops, clams, mussels, and even lobster. Not sure if the seafood variety is like this every night or I just happened to visit on a special day. A selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats (beef, chicken, pork, and lamb) rounded out my choices. Each of the refrigerated items were portioned out on Styrofoam plates and wrapped in cellophane, which I thought was a little wasteful. In the center of the restaurant were a bunch of desserts and some cooked items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. The theme of the non-refrigerated items was thai. As mentioned by others, there was also a condiment/sauce section.

Both broths were fine. The spicy broth was not that spicy and did not cause any numbness, but nor was it very oily. The meats were just okay, very lean, so they ended up a little tough after cooking. The lamb (a classic) and beef (eye of round?) were my favorites. I am not a huge crustacean fan, especially if I have to shell them myself, but I did enjoy the shellfish. The desserts were okay, nothing special. The meats could have used a little more marbling and an extra waitperson would have helpful.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,2,1,3,eUImOpyq7rAXhb4P9c46gw
4049833,2014-10-24,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Not a bad place for lunch as long as you are not in a hurry.  You need to boil all of your food so it takes a while.  Just waiting for the ""soup"" to boil seems to take forever.  

Here is the basic process.  You go to coolers and get little foam containers which each contain small portions of various raw foods.  You bring those back and cook them on a wok full of liquid what has flavor added to it.   You have two halves so you can decide to have half spicy half regular.  You add the raw items and wait for the water to boil and then you guess if it's cooked long enough.  Most of it cooks very fast because it's mostly seafood.    There is also a really wide selection of sauces you can select while your first food is boiling.  This place is not for people who have trouble with basic cooking just from a food safety perspective.  There is risk of cross contamination from mixing utensils and raw ingredients.

The selection of food is actually quite impressive as is the possible combinations of sauces.  I was there for lunch which is about $16.  I understand they do some different things on a different station at night,   Lunch section included various vegetables, tofu, dumplings, noodles, pork, beef, liver, raw eggs, crab leg clusters, clams, squid, octopus, salmon, salmon belly, white fish could be tilapia, mussels, and probably a few more I forgot.

In all it's a good meal.  I can see this could take forever if 4 people were sharing one cooker.  The staff seemed really disengaged and barely interacted with customers, but they were quite attentive.  They brought you anything you needed.  They took away the dishes.

With the previous management, you were able to order Shabu items a la carte, now for lunch it is AYCE shabu. For dinner, the grill is a choice and you can order  specialty cooked items. 

I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp and it was more just the shrimp with veggies and a bowl of rice...it came as a bento with fried rice, edamame and fried vegetables! Was not expecting that combo and was pleasantly surprised. Oh and then a couple minutes later, a small bowl of westlake soup came out! I love soup! How did they know it was the key to my heart?!

The food was good. The shrimp was small but I was expecting big anyway; they were about an 1 to 1 1/2 inches when curled up. Flavor was not spicy enough but at least it wasn't a salt lick like some other Chinese restaurants. The edamame was warm and cooked al dente. The fried vegetables were not tempura style, as I think they used rice flour so the fried batter had a rice cake consistency. The vegetables were broccoli, carrot and I think strips of potato. Fried rice was normal but the rice was not that day old crap. Westlake soup was yum and freshly made.

Since I didn't order Shabu and the person sitting next to me did, let me tell you about what I saw. The server explained the menu, how to cook, where the  sauce station was and where to grab more food to cook when ready. I thought the server was helpful to the newbie and that's cool. The guy called his friend to tell him he is trying a new restaurant where he cooks food in soup, blah, blah. 

Like I said the last time I was here, I hope they make it. I really like this place but I alone can't keep this place afloat.

I found the menu less Japanese and more south east asian. The shabu shabu pot featured two separate broths, one spicy and the other chicken.

I liked the options!

There is a condiment bar of dipping sauces, and refrigerators of meats, veggies, noodles, wontons and tofu. It is a help yourself thing so it's nice to get what you want. It was delicious! There are also kitchen items that can be ordered in addition to all  you can eat!

So I decided to give this place a try after my first time.  It's under new management.  I really liked it! Still AYCE and seafood is part of it! You still have to make your own sauces but they have some pre-made ones that worked for me this time.  The beef and crab legs were my fav.  Def a must try.  The price for dinner is $19 and you get 3 appetizers included.  No 5 stars cause it took about 5 min for someone to notice us standing at the door and forever to get the check.  


I think the dipping sauce is important to enjoy shabu. The meat and veggies aren't marinated so the broth and sauce is where you get the flavor. With that said, this place didn't have any good sauces. There was an assortment but nothing like the ponzu or peanut sauce you normally get. Additionally, we couldn't build our own sauce..no garlic, raddish, green onions, chili oil , pepper, nothing.... And they have their meat pre cut and stored in the fridge that you can help yourself too. No freshly cuts meat. the experience was different but not enough to get me back in those doors.

They kept jacking up the price to where it is now almost $30 per person and that doesn't include drink. Below is my latest review on each category:

Food: It wasn't fresh during the last two visits and some of the seafood were actually kind of smelly. 

Service: So bad. They seemed to have only one person up front beside the host/cashier. This lady seemed to do everything, ranging from getting utensils, remove dirty plates from the tables, getting drinks, getting soups, etc...What made it worse was she did everything so slow and because of that, every single table always seemed to have tall dirty stack of plates/trash.

Cleanliness: Nasty!!! While eating, I observed that this ""waitress"" wore the same disposable gloves throughout the entire time I was there. She picked up dirty ""with raw meat/seafood"" dishes with that gloves, she brought out utensils with the same gloves, she brought drinks to the table with the same gloves. Talk about food poisoning waiting to happen. Ewwwww.

Price: $30 for bad food, bad service, and dirty place, no thanks!!!! 

Unless they fix all the problems I listed above, this place will go the way of ""Woo Che"", which I predicted correctly that they will have to close their business soon. 

I recommend you go to Red Pot while they still have the 20% winter discount. That place is much cleaner and I love the fact that they use electric stove instead of gas.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,2,0,1,FZ4cQxzrBgSDezm_4qitvQ

Now the second go around our server didn't explain the new menu nor did he know what an Arnold palmer was. He only explained that he was having a bad day since the Chargers lost. He seems lost and unsure of the menu. Then said we had the option to do the lunch or dinner menu. Stating lunch menu did not include appetizers and the dinner menu includes 4 appetizers each. We wanted to do lunch because we only wanted two appetizers. He said OK then a moment later came back and said we could only do the dinner option. He rarely check on us and looked high. 
Totally upset that we wasted $40 on broth that tasted bland and possibly old. The high light of our meal...my water. The appetizers were actually better then I expected. They were the 2nd highlight of our meal. Maybe we just got a bad server. Whatever the case. Not satisfied.

Came here after hearing good things from my classmates in regards to an AYCE (all you can eat) shabu experience.  What they failed to mention was the variety of other dishes you could order from the kitchen.

To summarize what you get for $19.99:
1. AYCE proteins/veggies/tofu to be cooked in your hotpot.
2. More than 20 other dishes that you can order from the kitchen that aren't even mentioned on this restaurants website.
3. Unlimited dessert.  They only have strawberry, vanilla, and green tea ice cream... still unlimited though so you can't go wrong.

The reason I'm giving this place 5-stars is that the dishes you can order from the kitchen are both eclectic and super flavorful.  Have you ever been to Firefly or Ichiza... or any other type of restaurant that gives you the choice of a smaller dish for 3-5 bucks each?  Imagine that type of experience, except you won't rack up a bill over 23 bucks for trying as many things as you can on the menu.  Simply amazing.

I was able to try the stuffed mushroom, pan fried fish, satay curry chicken, sizzling beef tenderloin, soft shell crab, and salt and pepper tofu.  Each was different from the other yet still very flavorful.

I almost died when I had the salt and pepper tofu.  I had no idea tofu could taste that good.  I just may go back and eat 10 dishes of the tofu next time and skip everything else.

5 stars - wait staff was friendly, quick, and always accommodating
5 stars - food was great.  ability to shape the shabu to your taste was cool.
5 stars - restaurant was clean, very nice ambiance, crowd noise low (able to have a nice conversation over dinner.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.  Even though it's located in the area of Silverado Ranch and Maryland, it easily rivals and dare-I-say outcompetes some of the asian eateries on Spring Mountain.  

Check this place out and see what all the hypes about, the hype is well deserved.",_b9CQb4fPUo0sM0tdmhq5A,3,0,5,KrexSywkZouaz0h4g5cieA

Got here for lunch and it was pretty empty. Everything was in the fridge for you to take and add into your pot. You also get two different types of broths. They had all sorts of meat, vegetables, and seafood. I got here at lunch so there was no lobster. I did get some mussels and crab though. The lamb slices were my favorite along with the tripe. Not too bad. 

Don't bother with the dessert. Wasn't great at all. Left out for awhile too. 

Everything was about $25 minus the tip. I think it was a bit too pricey for what they had to offer. Especially for lunch. So that turned me off. 

From what I saw on here, dinner looks like where its at. More options and I believe, about $30. Anyway, I want to take my friend here since hes a huge hotpot fan, but idk if I want to do that anytime soon.

4934378,2014-09-30,8,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Just a quick note,  after coming her at least 9 times now, I can tell you that whenever I have a hankering for tasty and healthy food, this is where I come!  I just thoroughly enjoy everything here so much and both the quality and freshness of the food is A-! in my book!  They don't have a liquor license, but I bring my own wine and beer here, and there is no problem to consume this here!  GK says, gotta check this place out!

After reading reviews from fellow yelpers Rockne H and Michael K, I knew I had to try this place.

If you are looking for an all you can eat buffet style place to eat, then this will be a great choice for you.  If you love a great deal on seafood, this is the place.  If you like Hot and Juicy Crawfish, this is the place.

If you are used to eating at Shabu Shabu Paradise, then you need to shift your perspective a bit.  Shabu Grill is heavily influenced by a Chinese ""all you can eat"" style and a traditional Shabu Shabu place is more Japanese.  More on that later.

Questions - Be sure to ask the wait person everything!  Where are the sauces, how to make them, the dessert, the salad, and how you pick the items. Items are in refrigerators, on the bar counter, and in different sections. This is totally self service with exception of drinks, and clean up.  Think casino buffet and it will give you an idea...

Price - At 24.99 for Dinner or 19.99 for Lunch, this is not the least expensive place to eat but certainly it has value. 

Quality - The quality of the food is outstanding. From the Veggies, the seafood, the meats and the additional items, there is a huge assortment of very fresh and very enticing choices. For the meats, you have lamb, pork, chicken, beef, pork belly.  For the seafood, you get octopus, squid, mussels, clams, fish head, crabs, crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, fish ball, fish dumpling and possibly a few more that I did not keep track of.  The best for me was the veggies. I like a ton of veggies in my meal. Plenty of bok choy and another green veggie called tung ho, which is a cooking chrysanthemum that is great in a soup and it is great in soup.  Besides this, you have mushrooms, pumpkin, taro, tofu skin, corn and spinach. 

The broth - Whereas in other Shabu places, you would get to have water or a sukiyaki style sauce to cook, here you have either chicken broth and or a heavily spiced hot broth to cook your food in. Certainly different than my normal experience yet I was excited to try the hot broth as i enjoy a bit of spice. 

The sauces - On the ""bar"" area, they have all the sauces.  There are about 8 different types of sauces you can help yourself with and they have about 10 condiments to add to these sauces like jalapeños, ginger, garlic, green onion, cilantro and etc.  Very cool and you can customize your sauce to your taste and heat level.

Be prepared - If you ever ate at a Mongolian Grill or something like Ghengis grill, where you get to pick all your ingredients and bring it to the cook who fries it on a large iron grilling table, then this is what you can expect with Shabu Grill. When I say there is that Chinese influence, it is easier for me to describe how it is not Japanese. In a traditional Japanese Shabu Shabu restaurant, you have subtlety in everything.  Delicacy and simplicity is key. The broth is to compliment to meat, and the dipping sauces are light and not overpowering.  In general, everything is designed, refined and presented in a manner to enhance the dining experience and to enjoy the flavors and the natural food itself.  Here at Shabu Grill, I am saying that you can create this as well, if you are really good at it, and you can also go hog wild crazy and create some mixtures of meat, veggies, and seafood that are way different and cool too. 

I really like this place for what it is, and just be sure that you are not going to go in thinking this is a traditional Shabu Shabu Japanese restaurant. To me, this is more Chinese Hot Pot but it is still good, just different that is all. This place is an oddity to me. It is both chic and divey, casual and high end. The style of this place and the ambiance is about as simple and confusing as the food is. That makes it cool if you want something different.

If you are really hungry, or very food specific, this can be a great place for you to try.

I will be back with the kids, they will enjoy this for sure!

5041528,2014-04-22,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"My weekends are often times busy as heck! It's also a great opportunity for me to connect with friends! Every meal is reserved for a new friend and new experience. For Saturday's lunch, a friend recommended Shabu Grill as it offered some delicious food. I haven't been to Shabu Shabu since I moved up to Vegas almost 7 years ago, so I was excited to experience this again. For those not in the know, Shabu Shabu is a savory dish where thinly sliced meats, veggies and noodles are cooked in boiling broth. Once, I heard that Shabu Shabu was actually an onomatopia referring to the sounds coming from the pot when the ingredients are being stirred. Whether or not that's true, my taste buds certainly made the decision to Shabu my way to Shabu Grill.

Shabu grill is located in one of the most popular intersections on Silverado Ranch. If you've been to other popular places like Sushimon and Thai House, you know exactly where I'm talking about. Shabu takes a chunk of the building, close to the corner of Silverado and Maryland. When you walk in you'll notice the bar to the left and a couple of fake palm trees and bamboo sectioning out the actual dining area. The dining area was actually pretty nice and modern. Stainless steal vents over the tables, exposed air duct on the ceiling, marbled table that gives a granite counter look, exposed rock countering. In the middle of the restaurant was a non-alcoholic bar area with a big boat on top as the focal point. Although they had servers clearing the tables and bringing appetizers, this was an all you can eat joint. My favorite!

For lunch, the AYCE option was $20. It came with unlimited food and 3 choices from the appetizer menu. How it works is you choose our broth, either non spicy, spicy or half and half, and then go to town on the food. All food options are served in two big reefers. You grab a plate or two, open the doors and choose what you want.  They literally had everything! Baby bok choy to tofu skin, mushrooms to dumplings, lamb to pork belly. Everything you wanted was there for the taking. As many items as your arms could juggle was available. Remember though, it's all you can eat so pick out what you want, go back to your table and go get some more! I really enjoyed the long stem mushrooms, bok choy, lamb, pork belly and pork gyoza. For this visit, we chose the spicy broth. I'm certainly not the spicy kind of person but trust me, it's not spicy at all. It makes the food tangy and flavorful! With the thinness of the meat, you'll be going back to the reefers again and again. I must have visited them at least 6 or 7 times!

On top of the AYCE items, we were granted 3 appetizers off their menu.  I chose the chicken wings, lamb chops and pork chops. All apps are included in the $20 bill. The chicken wings were crispy and juicy on the inside and came dry meaning without a sauce. The pork chops were tender and super flavorful but the lamb chops were the star of the show! Although it wasn't cooked at a medium temperature, it was still perfectly grilled. The seasoning was light and allowed the lamb flavor to shine through.  Highly recommend this app!

I'm always appreciative of the interactive types of meals. Korean BBQ grills, fondue, Sukiyaki, they're all the same. Having the interactive element makes eating the food that much better. I'm definitely sure that I'll be back again very soon. Now that I've discovered a location close to my friends' houses, it will give me an excuse to come back again and again. If you're in the Silverado area and looking for a good place to eat, check this place out! You won't be disappointed!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,6,3,4,WdUxHFy6cXk_CR_sVYnWpA

Everything is pretty much a la carte. My friend and I decided to do asian style and share our food together. I did the Shabu grill and she did the japanese hot pot.

I really love the concept of this place. Pretty much all the meats and veggies are prepared and you can grab as much as you want from the fridge. everything is lined up and organized with all the meats and veggies. 

BE WARNED it is not all you can eat. they charge you per plate. average cost for a plate was 4.95$ for beef but the way my friend and i eat we racked up alot of plates and not even pay attention to how much we spent.

The food is great they have an array of sauces you can choose from. I didn;t really use any of it because i already like the natural flavors of the meat i was grilling and as for my friend she loved her japanese hot pot.

For those of youhave like authentic japanese you will be discouraged because the hot pot was not japanese at all it was more Chinese but we till loved it though.

I felt this palce was really unique because it was Asian food fusion with all the other countries. The restaurant was a combination of japanese, thailand, korean..

They are still in the works in getting the place together, they are adding a bar and tapas coming soon..

I really love this place the food is great and the cleanliness of the place is excellent as well.

The staff is great they fill your water up constantly and really friendly.

Very spacious and clean. It's actually pretty big for a shabu joint. They have plenty of tables that even extend into another room. The set up is different since it's an all-you-can-eat shabu joint. 

Quality/Taste: 2
Obviously since it's a buffet set up, it wasn't anything amazing. You had your meats and seafood to pick from, which included: beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, mussels, calms, squid and a few other things. They also had all the basic veggies, which worked out for our party since one of our girls was pescatarian.  

We all asked for the spicy soup base, which was whatever and almost tasteless and unmemorable. I think I only got my money's worth because the only thing that tasted fine was the shrimp.

Service: 1
Terrible! 
They start off with drinks, great. Then they give you a list of appetizers where each person is allowed to pick up to 3 options. Tell me why we didn't get our appetizers 'til half way through our meal.

There was 4 of us at our table and we all wanted spicy soup bases. They gave us one pot that splits, and one side was spicy and the other was water. So we asked for another one, and same thing - one side spicy, the other water. So we had to run down another server to get us the spicy powder base to make both sides spicy. The first server gave us some chili paste... The second finally gave us the powder

One of the girls at our table asked for rice at the beginning of the meal, and didn't get it 'til the end of the meal. We ran down different servers for it too, but they seemed to have an attention span of 10-seconds. 

One of our servers who had given us refills, brought us refills again, only this time they were the wrong refills...

At the end of our meal, we decided to just pay up front so we didn't have to wait any longer. We told the old man who seated us to put $21 on each debit card (there were 2), and the rest cash. And what does he end up doing? Uses all the cash and puts $14.51 on each card... They were able to fix it, but I was left unbelievably annoyed.

Overall: 2
I would not recommend this place to anyone. I read some of their tips, and I guess they're under new ownership - which my homegirl said makes sense because when she first gave here, she liked it a lot. Management needs to get their act together. Seemed like there were only 3 servers on the floor that day to cover the entire restaurant. On a busy night like that, at least have a busser - that would make such a big difference. That, or hire some better servers!",qwURNQ11dEFTKI3Dn3Mb2A,3,1,2,xXe6dUjYxtkiD1Nuv7yWDA

It is about $20/per person - I paid $55 including tip because the service was great, friendly, and all around awesome. Staff was attentive and always wanted to make sure we got everything we needed.

This restaurant is set up very efficiently. Everything is in small portions...where you go up to the refrigerator..and grab it yourself! YAY - no more super big plates that you and your party have to gargle down to avoid the leftover fee and everything is already wrapped over in plastic wrap already so it won't go bad - also, there is a station where you can mix and make your own dipping sauces! - ranging from peanut sauce to spicy thai to fish sauce, etc. 

Although it is on the opposite ends of the strip (a bit closer to Henderson) - this is definitely worth your money and the drive to come here.They offer seafood: crab legs, clams, shrimp, etc to noodles: rice noodle, vermicelli, udon, yellow noodle(avoid this one lol) to meats: pork belly, chicken, beef, etc. to veggies: lettuce, bok choy, spinach, etc to other yummy items: wontons, taro?, enoki mushrooms, etc.

Service was friendly but spotty at times. While they were good about taking away plates and refilling water, they forgot some of the appetizers we ordered for dinner. 

Speaking of appetizers, I recommend the sizzling beef tenderloin and the lamb chop. Dinner also comes with crab legs and dessert.

5390388,2012-08-14,2,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"As someone who has over 50+ check-ins to Shabu Shabu Paradise, you can probably tell how I feel about Shabu Shabu in general.   If you guessed that I like it, ding ding ding!  You're the big winner of the day!    When I saw Shabu Grill was taking over what was formerly Match, I was pretty excited as it's closer to my house than Paradise.   I did, however, have my doubts that it could be as good as either Paradise or Swish on Spring Mountain which I also frequent.   Spoiler alert: I was right.

I must note that Grill has a much more extensive menu than either Paradise or Swish offers, and I only tried their Shabu Shabu offering.   Many of these sounded tasty and warrant further exploration in the future.  The concept behind how their Shabu works is much different than any other place I've been to.   You get to choose two broths up front, and then you go to some stocked refrigerators and choose the veggies and meat you want to dip into the broth and pay as you go.   I do think this could ultimately be a winning idea as it provides a lot more flexibility with the experience than any other place that I know of can offer.  Here are the downsides:

1.  Quality of the meat - I personally wasn't too impressed with the meat when comparing it to particularly Paradise.  The pork just had an off-putting flavor to me and I'd never buy another plate of it again.  Conversely I think Paradise has amazing Kurobuta pork.  The beef was okay, but I do prefer both Swish and Paradise's version

2.  The rice - WASN'T STICKY RICE.   I don't know, I just thought this was some sort of crime against humanity.  I know nothing about traditions when it comes to sticky vs non-sticky rice, but it simply didn't feel right to me

3.  Lack of sauces - Grill did offer a decent selection of spicy and sweet mixing sauces at the table that I liked, but did not offer any dipping sauces for the meat and veggies being taken out of the broth.   I read another review mention to ask for a peanut sauce, so perhaps they do have them, but even if they do, I find it weird it wasnt offered to us standard.  This led to not only a downgrade in flavor, but I like using the dipping sauces to also cool down the extremely hot food coming out of the broth.

4.  No alcohol - This is a work in progress and I can't really fault them for the delay, but I do love a nice glass of wine or sake with my shabu, so it led to a lessened experience even if it's not their fault.

Positives are the different broths (though I preferred the regular to the lemongrass), the variety of options available, great service, and the price was a very good value (much cheaper than my average visit to Paradise).   

Overall it was a decent shabu experience, and if Paradise or Swish didn't exist for me to compare it to, I'm sure I would have been more impressed.  And if the Yankees, Red Sox and Rays didnt exist the Blue Jays might have a chance.   3 stars!",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,4,1,3,Muqz5Gmc6gEPVfGvbPguOg
5408403,2014-05-06,1,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Been here about 3 times now and it never disappoints. I would say the main star of the meal is just doing hotpot. They allow a choice of 3 appetizers per person from a large list of variety appetizers but they're not worth filling up space in your stomach (save all that room for the all you can eat meats and veggies). Shabu hotpot is about $20/person for all you can eat. It comes with the 3 appetizers as I've stated above and ice cream at the end of your meal. They serve half regular broth and half spicy but you can choose to do both the same if you'd like. You can also change your mind later so don't worry. One thing I love is their dipping sauce station! You can create/choose your own sauces and as many different kinds as you like! For someone like me who basically has condiments with a side of food that is heaven. Hotpot is self serve. They keep all of the meats and veggies wrapped up in a refrigerator and you grab what you want. Some people might be a bit iffy about the arrangement but for $20, you get what you paid for (everything's fresh, don't be afraid). I love the variety of veggies and tofu. It's a great place for my husband and I since he's such a carnivore and I'm such an herbivore. Service is always friendly and if you basically want the place to yourself come around 4-5pm, people don't begin rushing in until about 6pm and after. They're also open late in case you're a complete night owl.

But it's hard for me to get past that they serve frozen proteins, especially the seafood proteins which obviously brings up questions about the age/freshness and quality of handling.

We were acknowledged immediately and seated right away when we entered on a Wednesday night around 8:30. A very thorough explanation of the menu, options, and where we could obtain the proteins and sauces was given to us. This was very helpful as we don't have the process down pat yet. We really didn't even look at the menu as everything was kind of done and explained to us. We ordered two broths with one being spicy and we were also informed that two skewers of chicken and two skewers of lamb came with our meal.

The selection of proteins, vegetables, and sauces was enormous. We were satisfied with the beef, chicken, and pork. As said before, the broths were flavorful also. But when it came to the seafood, almost everything was frozen when we pulled it out of the cooler. I needed a hammer and chisel to pry the scallops from their shells and the meat in the crab legs was frozen to a shriveled mess inside their shells. And of course when you attempt to cook a frozen protein it turns out to be a tough, dried out meat, which is my favorite.

The frozen seafood would usually be a deal breaker. But the service was excellent and the price was affordable at $26/person so I might give them another shot in the future and avoid the seafood.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,1,2,3,63QqouF3xa4B7oCSZ3mg-w

I started getting really cold and I switch seats to the other side with one of my friends. We tried to ask to sit somewhere else but I guess the server doesn't speak English. So we were pretty much stuck in the corner. We waited for 30 minutes for someone to assist us, no one helped at all. We called the guy who sat us and asked can we order drinks? We've been here for more than 30 minutes! We got our drinks and yet still waited for another 15-20 minutes...

I've only done at home hot pot once. He goes on and just says, ""spicy or no spicy"" okay, thanks for explaining... Once we got our broth that was it. No such thing as service!

The papaya salad was bland and flavorless, not spicy, vinegary, or have any ""bite"". The little Thai style dumplings were better than the shabu shabu sadly, which is why we went there.

LOL I'm in love because I love my clams and mussels.  ALL you can EAT!!!  Crab legs were nice and sweet.  Boiling in the spicy broth just gave it a nice touch.  The desserts were amazing!!  Thai style.  We are definitely coming back here for more.  Everyone was so nice too.  ASK the server for ICE CREAM!  They have it in the back :) I'm satisfied!!!,UTfHHn6hDDKGNeF1tExzLA,0,0,5,BOGASnmsfZ5sx0FetLFadQ

It's AYCE so you can hop on over to the fridge to grab your ingredients for your hotpot.

My sister and her boyfriend like to come here so they're on friendly terms with one of the staff members. They all seem very friendly so service was a definite plus.

It's definitely out of the way for me, though, so I'll only be here sparingly but I'll consider it for a birthday dinner :0).

P.S. They take reservations for parties over 6.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,3,2,5,MAUwnjm5R0kUd5DrKM36tg
5765181,2015-10-30,1,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"It's $30 per person the price is not that bad for all you can eat but the problem is the quality of the meat and seafood are very poor compare to the price. This place own by Thai so you will find good authentic Thai sauce for the soup and amazing dessert there, that's a plus! I think they should charge a lil less to match the quality of the seafood. $25 would be fair.",a3yOeL5b0lzbo1ORHF2yHg,1,1,3,IFnfTwTz9IOyN6s2DMQeBg

Anyways, I did the lunch special, it was $9.99, got a choice of a meat, 3 veggies, 2 broths and choice of noodles. It was kinda confusing as it looks like Korean bbq, but it's not. But I'm not complaining! If I did the All You Can Eat, I would probably so fat, but I was watching the tables next to me and they were going crazy with the AYCE, from meats to seafood to all the veggies! Not bad, probably try it again when it gets colder, but it was good.",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,2,1,4,JSqI3h8MDCAt5aJN9eQSFg
5836395,2017-08-26,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"They had some pretty nice seafood for dinner, but no lobster. When they get a little bit more busy they get a bit forgetful with appetizers and water, but the people are nice. The selection was smaller than Red Pot but the quality was better, I think. There is likely a little MSG in the broth because, once again, I had a little reaction to it. Always hard finding a good place, particularly with soup, that doesn't cheat a little for taste.",SgcNTpx_ASfvyQHmLU443A,0,0,3,DL0AFDtPIQoP3G226Ri4tw
5860663,2015-08-27,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,Disappointing. This could be a great place. The setup is excellent and much of the food is decent. The beef and octopus are especially tough. The fried rice was good. I hope the place improves. I will check recent ratings before visiting again.,Q9EfqX_6VvA0LwANNyJ_DQ,1,0,2,Ff8Vu552VUlc_jzkm8hFYw
5868372,2013-06-02,0,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"I love Shabu-Shabu.  The three stars is due to the quality of the meat.  I do not seem to sound like a snob, but the places that I usually frequent for Shabu Shabu use Kobe beef and other high end choices.  This place used beef like it came from the supermarket.
That being said for 19.95 you get AYCE shabu shabu plus grill and kitchen items.  I had seaweed salad, fried shrimp rolls, grilled pork belly, fried oysters and a bunch of other stuff.  
For those of us more on the eclectic side of dining they offer salmon heads.  I wish that I could have had them grilled but they were still ok cooked in the broth.",1Qca4FtV1tUp-WZz9APgzA,0,0,3,9TJR6a-jCX4FhCdFmLcWlA

Luckily, it finally is! I'm so glad I've kept my eye on this place because it was exceptional! Although it hasn't had it's ""Grand Opening"" the service was exceptional, they answered ALL my questions. 

We had shabu, which included Original broth and spicy oriental broth with:
- Beef
- Scallops
- Tofu
- Vegetables
- Extra enoki mushrooms


If you do come, please ask for their peanut sauce! It is delicious and flavorful and my mouth is watering because of it. I will definitely be back!",ANLSKvFmCgRMjxtELq70FQ,3,2,5,7Mbe01ExkIgshWHoy4DX-w
5918504,2014-01-17,5,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Kitchen items/appetizers now limited to 3 orders per person. It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! 

I first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.

So when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.

The main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  

The DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.

I would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.

Note:  There is a ""bar"" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.

5938350,2015-11-19,1,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,This place used to be so good. Now with increased price no service and not many selection like before. Time say opened till 11:00 pm. it was only 10:00 pm. they started mopping the floor and putting desserts and sauce away. They cut the meat so finely that they no taste.. Don't waste your money. New ownership charge up the ass no service and rude.,kKnBdaG5eQPLZ0p8J0kkfg,1,0,1,242ZdNckS8o_3Bv_8q_vSQ
5947355,2014-12-28,3,PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ,"Five stars. Five freaking stars. This is one of my top AYCE places ever. With a party of 4, we were seated within minutes at 6:00PM on a Saturday night. 

I was blown away by this place. The last time I was this blown away was when I first went to Bacchanal Buffet last year. For $24.95, you will not be disappointed. If you're ever in the Las Vegas area, please make a trip out here. If you're on the strip, get a ride here. 

Everything is included. I mean everything. Raw shrimp, prawns, crabs, mussel, prime rib, lobster, lamb, chicken, fish fillet, crawfish, squid, scallops, clams, octopus, imitation crab salmon, noodles, tofu, fish tofu, pork wontons, thai wontons, etc.... seriously, it's a lot of food.

If you need vegetables, like a lot of vegetables, this place will have you covered.

Instead of asking the waiter or waitress for more food, you walk up to the refrigerators and grab them yourselves. All the portions are on styrofoam plates. LOVE THIS. Sometimes there is a line, sometimes there isn't. It goes by pretty quickly and the shelves get replenished pretty frequently. 

Dunk the food in one of their signature sauces, Sa'Cha Sauce, Seafood Sauce and Thai Chili Sauce. Shabu platters and you'll be sent to heaven. As far as the broths go, they offer regular and spicy. Both are good. Can't decide? Ask for both and have them put a splitter down the middle. That's what we did!

In addition to all the great foods, they also had an amazing selection of thai desserts with coconut milk. Can anyone say yum? I missed this type of food so much and was more than impressed to see this included in the AYCE!

As far as service goes, our waitress was beyond friendly. She took care of us and made sure our glasses were always full and our tables were clean. The bus boys were very efficient too and were always on point, even in a crowded restaurant.

Satisfied. Completely satisfied. If I was ever craving shabu shabu, I would choose this location in a heartbeat again. My advice is to get there early, or call in advance because there was a party waiting about an hour too by the time we left.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,3,2,5,VXMKglDv0SYoiixSUVMBWQ

It was actually me and hubby's first time trying out shabu and nobody helped us and even when we asked they didn't bother to explain anything. We just has to google what to do just to eat.",7vzosYBptYT-mLsLjoXkfw,0,0,2,5aeBEI7-PuUlsDqWR0g1nA
