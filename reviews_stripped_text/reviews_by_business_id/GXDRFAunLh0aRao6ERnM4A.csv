My boyfriend and I shared the Veal that was served just like a Pizza (almost bigger then a small pizza and flattened out encrusted in Parmesan).  It melted in your mouth and had the perfect flavor.  For our entree, we also split a nightly pasta special (seafood cavitelle) which was also incredibly good.  For startes we had the grilled calamari, goat cheese salad, and bruschetta to start with.  The calamari was our fave of the 3 apps.  The ambiance was very warm and charming yet upscale.  It's like you are in an Italian Villa.  Highly recommend!",Dpyal9p7-E1HJgcRixQLdg,2,0,5,mYbPnr8zp4Ot5Z9SeThd-g

189566,2017-09-19,0,GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A,"For some reason I wanted to eat pizza in Vegas, and since I was staying in Treasure Island I had to try this place out. I ordered a Medium Pepperoni Pizza ($23 total with tax) because by looking at the individual slices it was huge. The medium pizza took about 20 mins and it was kinda small....The six of us of course had one small slice each and was not too happy. The pizza was good but not great. The good thing was the pizza is fresh out of the oven and the cheese is melted perfectly. Overall, the food there was good and I probably won't go back. Make sure to ask someone about the whole pan size before ordering.

Also during your rush maybe have a couple pies going so there would be less wait time. The whole reason I'm writing this is that a girl had a slice of cheese to go that got cold. She went up to chef and asked for him to warm it up or replace it. He took he cold piece and put it back on the pizza bar to be reserved and grabbed her a fresher one. I would have left right then but figured i had a whole pizza coming so i wouldn't have any of those scraps. The whole thing was greasy and nasty.

For nyc-style standards, these can't be considered large slices.  They're medium at best.  

You have to be skeptical of most ""pizzerias"" on the strip, especially if they're located inside a casino that was erected in the mid-90s.  Now I'm not saying that the place is old, I'm just saying not to put too much stock in a place found in a casino that's Caribbean-themed.

For what it's worth, the pizza has a decent flavor.  But it's short on size and long on price.

Authentic NYC-style should not be on your to-do list while in Vegas; drinking until you forget should be.

As you see it sitting out on the counter, you had a feeling it wasn't that great. As you order, they warm it up in the oven and serve it to you.

When a pizza got low on the display, they simply stuck a pre-made pizza in the oven. There was a whole rack (probably 8-10 pizzas) already pre-made waiting to be placed in the oven. No telling how long it has been sitting on the kitchen counter but I'm guessing it doesn't help the freshness.

SUPER greasy and too strong on the tomato flavor... After eating one piece, eating another one was work. We didn't even finish the pizzas. I also got the house red wine and wow... it tasted like the wine was sitting there open for a while :(

This pizza is pre cooked; and then re-heated; so first and foremost just notate that.

There is a Japanese man making the pizza; who's somewhat grumpy and awfully hard of hearing. 

My first and ONLY visit to this location (as I am a local to Vegas) I ordered 4 slices of Pepperoni. There were 4 available at that time. I went to the counter; paid, and waited. Soon thereafter since it was just a reheated slice; only 1 slice came out. I asked if the other remaining slices were on the way; and he immediately got defensive and told me that I had only ordered 1 slice. I showed him my receipt which validated that I ordered 4 slices; however at this point now; there were only 2 slices left. The other slices were being re heated for guests who had ordered and not yet paid behind me. I let the Manager know that because I not only asked specifically for the pepperoni, but also paid for it; that the remaining slices should be coming to me. She apologized and said that wasn't the way it worked; but that I was welcome to pick another slice instead. I let her know I wanted what I paid for and nothing more; to which she replied ""sorry"". I told her at that point to just give me a cheese; which was less expensive that the pepperoni. No refund was given for the difference in price.

I figured that this pizza had better be some damn good stuff for me to have had to put up with mediocre customer service; and $5 slices. It was AWFUL! Tasted as if it was reheated (which obviously it was)................sauce was nasty; almost Ragu tasting as funny as that sounds; and the cheese they use is either old or its just very cheap. This pizza was gross. Gross Gross Gross. I threw the remaining slices out, as not even the other Manager I work with wanted to eat anymore and felt the same. 

If you want GOOD AUTHENTIC PIZZA go to Sicili's on Twain Ave (Just behind the Venetian; passed Paradise. Its CHEAP, and its SO GOOD you'll crave it weekly (I'm not kidding you). $9 for a Large.

The night before Adam and I walked by here and thought they had a pretty good deal so when we woke up hungover and ready to get something into our systems we thought this would be a good option since it was quick for us. Well the special was only at night and wasn't going on during the day but we were already here. 

We both got a slice of pepperoni and a garlic bread as well as 2 fountain drinks. There was only a few other people in the restaurant so we were helped immediately and it took next to no time to get our food warmed up.

There are some tables you can sit at and there is also a bar top where you can sit and eat too. We got a couple of seats at the bar top and were able to enjoy in peace. 

The pizza was okay. It was nothing amazing. There were no great spices or flavors that stood out to us. It was just some pizza. The garlic bread was the same. It was a little tough and there really was no garlic flavor. I actually had to use the dipping sauce it came with to get it down and I hate putting my bread in sauce. 

I felt it was all very over prices as we were paying over $5 for a slice of pizza which is crazy. If you are going to charge that much then you should at least make sure the pizza is good. 

The deal my husband saw the night before was for pizza, wings, and a beer for $12 and that would be a great deal but they didn't have it out when we were there. I am sure if I was drunk I would have really enjoyed my meal.

Our slices were HUGE, although it looks like it could be hit or miss, with  no exact science behind the pizza wheel. They were definitely a step up from mall pizza slices, and another step up from the big name delivery guys, but not as good as CPK or the like.  

Greasy, but in a good way - if that's possible - ingredients seem legit, and the selection is average for a cafeteria style pizza joint. 

It's a little on the pricey side for what it is, but it's very convenient if you're already at T.I. and a bargain compared to what your other in house options are.

My friend was craving pizza, so the nice lady at the front desk recommended Francesco's.

There was no wait, our server was efficient, and the food was good.  I started with the caesar salad.  The lettuce was crisp, and the croutons were crunchy and buttery (although there were only about 3 of them).  The dressing was creamy and tastey, although it lacked that bite that anchovy paste would have lent it.  I also was not offered fresh cracked pepper until I was halfway done with my salad.

We ordered a margerita pizza to share.  The crust was undercooked and floppy, for lack of a better description.  The sauce was WAY too salty, although it did have a nice garlic flavor.  There was a nice helping of torn basil leaves sprinkled over top.  

The bread was probably the best part of the meal; they give you a chunky tomato tapenade to spread over it, or a combination of olive oil and balsamic venegar to dip it in.  They also provide a little cup of olives.

I had entirely forgot about this place (and maybe for good reason). We ate here while staying at TI after coming in from show at another property. A better idea would have to eat wherever we were for the show, or ANYWHERE else en route to TI. 

It must have been a Friday or Saturday night. The queue was so long it left the restaurant and encroached on walkway that separate it from Mystere's theatre. To make it worse, the service is so goddamn slow here, sometime during your interminable wait the thought that they are purposefully slow to artificially create a club-like queue to attract more patrons starts creeping into your psyche.

Hubs got a piece of pepperoni pizza and I got a fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, very fresh with yummy pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, etc.  My hubby's pizza was a greasy mess!  It looked so nasty, I can't believe he ate it.  He did use several napkins to blot the grease, but that didn't seem to help.  The crust was also burned to a crisp so he almost chipped a tooth on that!  All in all, if you don't really care what you're eating, go for it.  If you want a solid piece of pizza, look elsewhere.",Sn6DV1-Xk7du4dGqnXuEdg,0,0,2,_yGgrj2Xa6l96C8Sabp7nw

Best part was there was no waiting it was ready and just heated. So perfect for late nights and those super hungry moments. Casual dining place. I wouldnt get dressed up to come here. I would eat here again.,ggyJIt-qqVjvlI7u7mFEgw,0,0,4,-qItJwUmzC0bRnuVH-oLAQ

We both got the sausage,since it was the freshest.  It was very cheesy, greasy, and the crust was just mediocre.  I had to use 10-15 napkins to sop up all the grease.  We ate it, and it served it's purpose, but for pizza standards, it wasn't all that.  Last case scenario, or be very very drunk!",DSDL_v5dvLOIJ-o5sRhz4w,1,0,2,KJsWImrVJYENhN0tFFvrrw

My girlfriend and I came here for dinner after a night of partying.  I just woke up and was like....OOOH PIZZA!!   So we both ordered our own pizza (where one pizza could easily feed 2 or 3 people), so needless to say, we had leftovers, which was fine cause her man was passed out in the hotel room.  haha!  Anywhoo, i got the margerita pizza and added mushrooms to it.  It was scrumptious and hit the spot.  Although I didn't finish the pizza that night, it was done by the morning.  It easily became something for me to nosh on through the evening and in the morning!!",dRaLq9sF45RYHhKfUd8NMg,1,0,4,Nqkw5pE0HAqytuAmT3Y86w

And I know someone said that buffet is $14 for lunch? And I know they have pizza there. Well someone do the math here.,eOz2IdGXU6NqU_wcaelkDQ,0,0,2,LWv3o-omN5kICQFyCYHKxQ

Thin, crispy crust, the veggies and onion are pre roasted and caramelized on the supreme, yum and about $6 per slice.  Cheaper for less toppings.  Also, fried wings for around $5.  

Sustenance, greese, the basic necessities.  Your stomach will thank you afterwards.  Decent pizza, nicely priced for being on the strip.",l4pabLd84WrBxt-nHVsZ3g,6,7,4,v3OnKzEqoNqH_AMSExwiwA

5772867,2012-06-25,0,GXDRFAunLh0aRao6ERnM4A,"Okay.  First off my disclaimer: I did not eat this right away.  We picked it up and ate it at our hotel in Paris (prob 20 minutes from picking up).  However, I am keeping this in mind when I do this review.

Medium supreme pizza:  $22.  dafuq?  Must be as good or better than pizza in New York.

Nope.

The crust was thin.  But because we didn't eat it fresh it wasn't crispy.  Even assuming it was crispy, here is the main problem.  They oversalt this pie like a mofo!  The tomato was good and it wasn't like oversauced... but Nothing really blew me away (except for the extra handful of salt they used).

$22.  That's too much for a medium pizza which as probably 12"" or maybe 14"".  Better than Pizza Hut?  Yes, but worth 3-4x the price?  Na.",Jndb3IoOrN-xj1QFxvKAcA,1,0,2,1Fntttje8sADZEicJPKXHA

below-par salty pizza
garlic bread was ok, but the marinara that comes with it was like a red salt sauce.

don't come here even if you're desparate and on a time crunch since the wait time seems to be pretty variable for a grab-and-go style pizza place...",M0mONsg1ZJIKA30ad1qE1w,0,0,2,S1TE4uQf2jgfM_fj2Uh4EA
