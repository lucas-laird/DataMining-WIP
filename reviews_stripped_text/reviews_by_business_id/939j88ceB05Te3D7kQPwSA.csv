18841,2010-07-13,0,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"VooDoo has the BEST view of Vegas and the Strip. Unbelievable! Inside the Casino we got free passes from someone handing them out, we showed our passes and I.D.'s at the host desk and then preceeded to elevator  where you go up to the 51st floor to get to the club. About halfway up in the elevator the back opens up to a window so you can see the Strip as you climb. 

Upon entering the club we immediately headed out to the roof, where there is a full bar, DJ and dance floor. There was also a little roped-off VIP area that would be nice for small parties. This section offered the best view (and a place to sit!) The view of the Strip is absolutely breathtaking! I was completely mesmerized and didn't leave my ""spot"" for the whole two hours or so we were there. The weather was perfect; not too hot and no wind. The music was great but I opted to dance where I was standing versus hitting the dance floor area because I couldn't bear the thought of losing my view! The drinks are pricey (i.e. $17 for a Vodka/Cranberry/Red Bull but it's Vegas and everyone knows if you're not gambling you spend a small fortune on alcohol.)

At one point I went inside to use the restroom and was surprised by how packed the indoor part of the club was. The dance floor was shoulder to shoulder and the bar was two or three deep. I understand that they had another DJ dance party going on in there but HELLO!? Didn't those people realize the GEM of a view that was only feet away from them!? It was a good thing though, because my party of 8 was able to enjoy our rooftop experience more comfortably. Ladies, the bathroom is small...only two stalls, so don't wait to go until the last minute because chances are high there will be a line!  

You MUST make a trip to VooDoo! This was my second trip to Vegas and my most favorite experience BY FAR!!! (I would also recommend having dinner first at Boozio's located in the Casino and then heading up to VooDoo for after-dinner cocktails...this was the perfect evening!)",dqw1ahXDW-BCMwz2icJ1Sw,1,1,5,WHyhfJhxKREi7E5AfiyrlA

Door staff seemed friendly and the view was awesome. The crowd is mostly adult, with a wide age range going there. Very few youngsters for a Saturday night. Pricey drinks like everywhere else in Vegas and lack of seating & dance floor space looses 2 stars. So many of the tables were empty but don't even think about it unless you've paid for table/bottle service.

My second experience didn't start great. Our reservation was for a certain time and we weren't seated for at least another thirty minutes. But, sh*t happens and I get that. Plus we got drinks at the bar and the interior is really fun to look at. Soooo, check this place out for the view and get some drinks.

The DJ was great!!! We like the old school stuff hip-hop with a mix of some newer stuff. The DJ not only mixed to music up well but he also had big screens and he would be mixing the music videos up at the same time!! 

The outside balcony was big with an amazing view it was cold so didnt spend to much time out there. Although there isnt a dance floor in the lounge there is plenty of room out there with a bar aswell. We just danced where ever we would be standing. They did do what seems to be the standard in Vegas which is blocking off all seating for ""VIPs"" More than half of the VIPs were not being used kinda rude.

Two and a half hours later, we still were not seated and were not give any explanation.  We watched several other parties being seated immediately.  I guess we're ""nobody's"".

I don't think my gf got the memo of how bootsy this place is. There are countless of other places we could've gone to-anywhere that didn't have skulls & neon voodoo crap! Entering this place felt like going into a scary ride @ a theme park. The place was dead. Literally. There was no one there. And mind you, the men in black @ the door wouldn't let some people in-wtf?  

After dinner, the smart ones, who drank most of the witch's brew (it was huge!), was lucky enough not to remember the awful dining experience.  I should've known better & got wasted like the rest of them. Was too busy trying to dodge corners thinking the grim reaper was coming after me. No, no, wasn't on hallucinogens either. haha!  Did I mention that the brew had dry ice? The food? umm.. forgettable. I seriously don't remember. And me, not remembering food- must have been that bad. 

Someone needs to do something witht his place. This is prime realty being wasted. We're talking major overhaul to be up to par with the rest of the city. I get the whole theme but I still say don't do it. Unless, of course, you're into that kind of stuff.  You'd see a better view of the strip from the Ghost Bar @ Palms, across the way. Ironic that it sounds voodoo-ey but it's not, at all. Every other place we went to after that made up for this crappy resto-lounge so i'm not that bitter. I mean- it's Vegas! How mad could you be?

Seriously though, If you find yourself stuck @ the Rio, you'll be better off taking your money & partying with the seafood at the buffet downstairs. lmfao.

We were out celebrating my husband's 49th birthday. I really wanted him to see the view even though I know he has a fear of heights. When we arrived I explain to them I only wanted to be there for a few minutes to show my husband the view because we had plans to play poker. They only charged us $10 for the three of us to get in I was free because I was a woman and he allowed my husband to go out for free because it was birthday and our third-party cost us $10. Fairly reasonable even though we did not plan to stay very long. When we arrived at the bar inside we ordered two beers for the guys. The interior bartender was a complete sweetheart. We walk to the outdoor area and the view was spectacular. It was pretty slow maybe less than 50 people. Most of the booths were roped off and it seems to be only one party had bottle service. There was area with no roping and we decided to sit down for a few minutes. I stood up and dance for a few seconds and the next thing I knew I had a security guard darting for me and screaming at me to move out of the area. He was completely rude and nasty and I didn't appreciate his behavior. He could've explained that it was bottle service only. I didn't remove any ropes or anything it may no sense why I got yelled that. I had to explain to another guy that seem like he was part of security of how rude he was and he just nodded his head as if he didn't care. We had one more celebratory cocktail that cost us almost $38 and exited the area promptly. I can understand roping off during the weekends but the place was completely dead on a Tuesday night. Perhaps you shouldn't be so greedy about giving bottle service only. We were paying customers that spend over $75 and cocktails in less than 15 minutes that we were there plus the $10 cover charge. I do regret spending that kind of money and a small period time and being screamed and yelled that. If you want to be treated like A piece of garbage I suggest you go there.

My 12 oz choice flat iron was delivered exactly medium rare and was lean yet wonderfully flavorful. The side dishes of mushrooms, mac n cheese with truffle oil, asparagus, creamed spinach and shoestring potatoes were all very good. VooDoo's cuisine is on par with Morton's, Capital Grill or The Palm. Late night diners be warned, the Lounge above starts pumping out the beats at 10:00. If you want a quiet, candlelight dinner, there are other places in Vegas. If you want to dance, experience the rush of standing on top of the Rio Hotel & Casino, attempting to finish a diabolical Witchdoctor cocktail, head to VooDoo Steak and Lounge.",vq7Aq37DgJw8zqkruqbn6g,0,0,4,2_1b6NHOWLqcFGuSLHIKsA

We got the huge pink dry ice drink for $37 which was too sweet to our liking but we finished it anyhow lol. None of us even felt light buzz from it, which is strange, considering all the things they put in it, won't order it again.
 
Seating is a real pain: 3 seats inside club and 0 on the roof-deck outside, unless you booked a VIP tables. Music is ok, mix of everything: old school and now. There's a dress code, but night we went there (friday), people wore really average stuff, flip flops and shorts so I am not sure how strict they are. 

Seems not to be a place that young crowd go to, mostly middle age ++, at least that night. 

We paid $30 cover charge, that included lift ride and no line admission.

Won't visit again, better clubs out there for sure!

I went here for dinner with my Dad after an afternoon at Las Vegas Speedway for a track-day event a while back.  The Rio is probably my favorite place to stay in Las Vegas for the price, although I had never been to this restaurant.  This is easily in my top 5 dining experiences that I've ever been to - and that's saying something considering I live in San Francisco.  I had the sea bass which was one of the best meals I can ever remember having it was one of the most unique tasting dishes as well.  I've gotten sea bass quite a few places and haven't ever experienced anything close.

The price wasn't bad considering other options in Las Vegas and for the quality of food it's unbeatable.  Very professional staff and the ambiance of the place is very comfortable.  The view is absolutely amazing as well!

This place is a great outing if you are thinking or traveling off the strip for a more mature night of drinks and dancing. Beware though, this place has been a sausage-fest 3 out of 4 times going there and has a much older blend of patrons. If you are looking for a bunch of freshly turned 21 year olds, I would not count on Voodoo. The view is spectacular even though it can get breezy and chilly outside on the dance floor. Still great for some pictures though. This time around we ate at the restaurant too which was definitely tasty. Not the best food I've eaten, but it did the job. My buddy did say the lobster bisque is fantastic. Oh, and a quick pointer: don't stand under the black lights in the hallways if you have spots on your shirt, they will be on display for the world to see. Probably not the best way to impress the ladies. Gentlemen, be wary of the creepy bathroom attendant. He did everything short of shake it for me and I felt obligated to give a tip. I don't know about you guys, but the last place I want to be bothered is when I'm taking a piss. Overall this place is a blast and the view is phenomenal, I would definitely recommend Voodoo to couples or small groups for a more ""chill"" atmosphere. Great experiences there, bring a jacket unless it's summertime, and find a promoter so you can get in free (they are all over the Rio). 4/5",jnqP5-TqSLozh3OmJCZH7w,0,0,4,91UH9pFj52Ez65edg9a23A

Where else can you stand outside over 500ft above Las Vegas and look down at the strip? Their outdoor patio area is the main reason I like coming here. I've ordered some of their mixed drinks here, but the one that you really need to get is ""What the Witch Doctor Ordered"". And that's if you don't mind spending almost $30 for a drink. If you do mind, then share it with someone. Although you might to share anyway. It's huge!!!

I don't remember what they mixed in here, but I think they put every kind of alcohol ever made in it. Then they drop some dry ice in the center, so you get that cool ""volcano"" look to it. I didn't care for the dry ice taste, so I get mine without that. But you need to see it first before you get it without.

That is supposedly not a good guy/girl ratio for Vegas clubs, but the Bouncer & Host had no problems with that.  And one of the guys had a cane from a recent back surgery too.  They also accepted all of our coupons to waive the $20 cover charge without hesitation.  Therefore, I must give a lot of kudos just for instant customer service excellence.

After the host desk, you take a glass elevator up to the 51st floor, and there is an inside bar with people dancing and roped off couches.  We got some drinks, including 2 $30 Witch Doctors, which are basically Fishbowls with dry ice.  Then we headed outside where the real action was at.

Best view of Las Vegas was on this outside club, yes, even better than Stratosphere and Paris.  You see the backside of every Strip hotel, and it's too good to believe.  You also see the backside of 2 go-go dancers wearing just ugg boots and not much else.  

So why not 5 stars?  Well, shots are $12 each, and the air of exclusivity that belongs to places like Pure, Tryst, etc isn't here.  There's no chance of a celeb sighting when there are more guys than girls and the guys are wearing tiger-striped pants.  Seriously, a lot of guys wore this.  

Still, this is an excellent club for people who have never gone to a club.  Great music, strong drinks, a view of a lifetime, and no worries about getting rejected at the door.",wxct58evcVcR5xI_i5xvmg,0,2,4,dn8kn9vqzJohM_m4YkU8jQ

First, you have to ride to the top in a windowless elevator crammed in with a bunch of drunken, clueless, smelly Vegas visitors. Yuck. Doors open and. the. decor. is wack. I'm talking somebody went freakin' crazy with the black walls and neon scribbling that glows weirdly with some blacklight backlighting. Voodoo? I'm confused. 

Drinks are so expensive we didn't even bother. The flairtenders dick around with them so long you're essentially getting a flavored water anyhow. 

The view gets half a star and the people watching gets half a star (and a quarter of that people-watching is for the downstairs doorman talking into his sleeve in order to manage that frenzy otherwise known  as the 5-person line).

The staff was friendly and helpful, our waiter was great and very attentive without hovering.  He suggested we take our drinks out onto the patio after ordering and what a good idea that was!  The view is spectacular!  You can basically see end to end of the strip (although City Center has gone and screwed up the view of MGM).   

The steak was fantastic.  I had the NY Strip, and it was one of the best I think I've ever had.   My girlfriend had the skirt steak and also couldn't say enough good things about it.  The sides are not all that special, but they are solid and do compliment the meal nicely.

Maybe we made a mistake by telling our waiter and his ""assistant"" that we weren't going to be there long, because we were treated like crap for the rest of our visit.

We ordered the VooDoo version of a fruites de mer plate and it was pretty standard stuff.  The lobster portion was large, but a tad overcooked and rubbery.  They had a couple of oyster shooters in vodka on the plate, and the vodka was God awful, really nasty stuff.  The shrimp were shrimp.  Not bad, and it was $48 for two, so my expectations weren't too high.

While we were eating my water glass was empty for at least 15 minutes of out meal.  Ouch.

I can take some rudeness if you're good at your job, but these people weren't.  And at the end of it, for appetizers and drinks, I still dropped a bill on it.  Not really worth it.

I've been here a few times now, and it's definitely a hot spot in Vegas (even though it's off the Strip).  The shuttle runs every 30 minutes from the strip to the Rio until 1am for free so getting there is not a problem.  

Cover can be anywhere from $10-$30 depending on the night, but there are always promoters handing out free passes in the lobby.  Get your free pass and take the elevator up to the 51st floor and you have arrived.

The DJs here play a mix of hip hop, techno, and top 40s. It can take a while for the dancing to get started because most people are taking in the view. They have a couple of go-go girls to watch, but they are kind of boring.

Ok so the 'Witch Doctor':

Wow! My friend and I found a 2 for 1 coupon, but we had no idea what we were in for!  The bartender set up two HUGE goblets (we thought we were getting a specialty shot or something--try 10).  The drink contained Malibu, Peach Schnapps, Pineapple Rum, Raspberry Rum, Captain Morgan, and Grenadine. If you're into fruity drinks, this is for you! We were actually planning on hitting a different club, but after our drink order there was no way we were leaving.

There is no pretentious line of people or bouncers; just people dressed up to have fun and dance the night away.  Voodoo is all about the experience and views.  There's a great view of the strip and desert from the 50th floor rooftop dance area. While you dance, mingle and enjoy everyone's company you can just sit back and Vegas in. 

The Signature drink ""Witch Doctor"" is tasty and fun to watch as they make it. Be sure to get it. 

PROS:
* Fantastic View of Las Vegas from the rooftop
* Friendly Bartenders
* Mix of non pretentious (hot) people 
* Witch Doctor Signature Drink ($30) 
* Free Entry if you're smart and look for the people handing out ""VIP cards"" at the escalators.

We have stayed at most of the high end hotels and love to try the fine dining that each place has to offer. Today was our 3rd anniversary, but as it is the holiday season and the fact that we have 5 kids and a new granddaughter we decided to not splurge as much as we normally do, so we chose to stay at the Rio and eat at the steak house which was a terrible mistake.
They seem to have a delusional sense of grandeur, they charge premium fine dining prices but the food, service, cleanliness and appearance  just doesn't qualify. 
We had to return our appetizer, coconut shrimp that was undercooked, hard and disgusting, though our other choice of crab cakes was at least average and edible. My husbands steak was OK but at $60 in reality was not a very big step ahead of what you would find at outback. Mine however was extremely undercooked. I had two bites and refused to eat anymore or anything else. 
We are generally not complainers and normally pay our bill and just dont go back. But this was our anniversary, we had two terrible dishes, we ordered a second bottle of wine and even though our glasses were empty the guy just put the bottle on the table and walked off. Never have I seen this before in a supposedly higher end restaurant. Not wanting to make a scene in public husband went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager in private. He was told the manager was in the wine cellar and would be there in a moment. 10 minutes later there was still no manager. After giving up and returning to the table we tipped our waiter and told him the issues. I will say he was very courteous and apologetic but also informed us that a manager wasn't even on duty that night. So being lied to was just a great way to top off a terrible experience! How bad can a place be when the best parts of your celebration dinner was the excellent  souvenir photo that we purchased and the wine, other than that there is absolutely nothing else positive to say.
p.s.  don't use the bathrooms, they are absolutely disgusting. I've seen cleaner ones at a sports arena!",uD8uF2PfINMbdo9ng7pCLg,10,1,1,HpbjY-dlxQaS-nKB2TNrvw

Mine was not so great, I had the roasted chicken and it came with a side of mac n cheese (that not only could I not eat, but was getting nauseous from smelling... too much truffle oil). Chicken was very dry, had two strips of peppered bacon that were shriveled up. Not worth the 30 bucks for the plate, not even close.

This drink is the size of a fish bowl, smokes and bubbles, and is def. bewitching. I didn't have a drink because I had been drinking since I got off the plane a couple days earlier (my one friend started drinking on the plane) and needed a ginger ale and glass of water asap. In retrospect the 'doctor' would have cured my sickliness and would have gotten my night off right. i will know better next time.
why a next time?.....the lobster thermidor.....i have been dreaming of it since i've been back. soooo delicious. Then after dinner, we ventured out to the rooftop club that has a breathtakingly spectacular view of the strip. The club was bumpin and was a mix of all different crowds & ages, I would actually say it was more of an older crowd (by which i mean older than my low 20's entourage). It was a great time because my parents were with us that night for the birthday celebration and so the mixed crowd was perfect for our situation. 
So why 4 stars? I don't think any of the restaurants in Vegas should be ranked on a 5 star scale. Every single restaurant I went to had slow service, slooooooooooooow service.

Your all the way at the top of the Rio partying it up ! Although a bit small you have the option of staying in the building or going out to the actual rooftop outside. Bars in and out so dont have to walk back in for drinks.Once outside though you will see one of the most awesome views, THE awesome lit up city of Las Vegas. The view itself is worth the trip here ! 

Drinks here seem to be a little on the expensive side but as a previous Yelper stated , Gotta get the ""Witch Doctor."" It is a 30 dollar drink thats huge and has about 3 or more different kinds of Liquor in a bowl shaped cup topped with punch and a piece of dry ice to give it a cool "" smoke coming outta the glass"" effect. Definately a creeper drink. Did i mention awesome?

Music is above average but could be a bit better. 2 Dj's. One inside the premise one out on the rooptop.

Overall i like this spot alot. The reason why its not a full 5 stars its because of  the size of the place.. not all that big and the fact that the Witch Doctor ( the drink i always get ) runs me 30 dollars plus a 5 dollar tip. You dont have to tip but i just feel i should. To the average person one Witch Doctor or maybe even 2 would have someone saying "" Im getting messed up ."" But me i need 3 maybe even 4 to get a good buzz going. Do the math.The Drink is not good on the wallet but Definately taste good going down. thats why i drop the 35 anyway.

Im closing this out .... Want an awesome view , a good time , dont mind paying a little more for drinks? Go to Voodoo , youll have a blast!

Ps. i know i said i was closing this but i just wanna say that Voodoo is no Marquee @ the Cosmo or XS @ the Encore , thats like comparing a Toyota to a Lamborghini but i think youd still have a good time here.

Pss. Seriously this is it ... So you dont pay a 20 dollar cover at the door sometimes you can find both males and females down at the lobby of the Rio passing out free passes to Voodoo as long as your in before midnight.If you dont see anybody passing out passes i recommend going to that bar to the left of the escalators that leads up to Voodoo (forgot the bar name , sorry ) and just ask them if they have any passes you can have. Just be nice about it and theyll hook it up. Passes at the bar can be free passes or just half off tho. Have fun !!",Jba0ywbULpKrjN3a90MutA,11,4,4,i1N4GxhYZ62rVfGho5aZEw

They wanted me down the elevators. When I disagreed and told them that my friends are coming, Kalani and Luis pushed me into the elevator and gave me no choice. I called the manager ""John or JP"" to tell him how they got physical with me when I was standing by the elevators waiting for my friends, and he defended those who pushed me by saying it's their policy.

The rooftop was pretty small. I expected at least the venue was bigger than the billboard posted on the freeway. The place is a bit dingy and felt pieced together. Also, since there were lots of people dancing I also expected an even dance floor instead of the slope towards the middle. I am guessing it was for water irrigation but it doesn't take much to upkeep or place a false raised floor on top of that. I've seen much more vegas magic during my stay than this slap in the face. I find it insulting to give such a poor kept venue when charging $20 at the door and $14 a drink (a shot of fireball). 

But the clientele was very friendly and fun. They kept their attitudes with a smile, excepted this place, and danced away. 

Here is my main complaint on this place that took the star away. After spending $200 on drinks, I asked for a water. I was then showed and told that there was no water. He pushed his tap gun and showed me that nothing comes out of the water button. Is that legal? having a bar with no water? but the other buttons on there work? At least sell cheap bottled water at the bar if you sell everything else? I like a good party but I do water my friends after some drinks.

Second time here. We bypassed a crapload of people in line on a Sunday night Labor Day weekend, and walked right to the elevator to the roof. That is the great part of coming with just one other girl to these clubs. I would have been pissed if I had had to wait or pay to get in there. Just saying.

I love the view from the rooftop, and that there are two levels. It is much easier to enjoy the place on a breezy summer night, it is unbearable in the colder seasons.  They play some old school hip hop which is always fun. The bartenders are also pretty cool, much more attentive than at the more trendy XS and Marquee.

First off, this is still VEGAS, right? Just checking. I called on a Friday night for a reservation that night at 9:45, was told to be ON TIME! If I was five minutes late they wouldn't hold our table. After hustling over we have to wait 15 minutes for a table in a predominantly emptying dining room.  WTF? I assumed this place would be packed and open late on a Friday. No. They are just interested in getting you out of there and up into the lounge.

Plus side - the view is really good.

Waiter was very friendly, very engaging. As he brought me my beer, he somehow managed to spill it UP MY SLEEVE of my jacket. Understand, I am wearing a glorious, three-piece, styling red funky suit. I am dressed! What does this napkin monkey do? Nothing. Stands there and says, with a big smile, ""OH, I'm sorry."" I had to send him off for a damp rag. Idiot.

Now, this is VEGAS, right? The town of tipping and comps? What does Napkin Monkey comp me at the time? Nothing. I expected at least a beer. Nothing. So I'll wait for the check ... one should not have to ask ... we'll come back to that.

Food. Service. Sucked.

1. The place setting was a small square placemat with silverware about ten inches apart. When the 15 inch plate of salad was brough to the table, the server used the salad place to shove the silverware aside! Hell, I've never been a server, but even I know this is WRONG. 

2. My Heineken  beer was served with a MIller Lite branded glass. Wow, classy!

3. I was still eating my salad and they brought out the entree. Again, serious server error. 

4. Server did not come over very soon after food was served. Beer was empty. Hey, I'm a freaking drunk in Vegas, I want continual suds over here, Napkin Monkey!

Back to the comp. NOTHING. Not a thing. Not a word. I ate at Denny's one early morning and the turkey was frozen on my sandwich. That waitress comped me a second order of onion rings. The waitress at Denny's was better than the waiter at Voodoo? What the hell has happened to Vegas??

Food quality was average, I've had better. Not a good value for the money, my buddy and I dropped $200 on dinner. Frankly, we should have eaten at the Peppermill instead.

You do get free entry to the club if you eat dinner, but I could have hit the doorman with a hundy and been granted admission.

1861798,2011-03-10,0,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"Anytime I want to take a friend to take in a view of the Vegas Strip, I always keep the VooDoo Lounge in mind.  The lounge isn't as pretentious as the lounges at the Palms.  The VooDoo Lounge is inside The Rio Resort and is pretty simple to get to.  Dress code is enforced and consists of dress shoes and a collared shirt.  Cover can vary from free to $10; however, a limited amount of free passes are distributed at the Help Desk on the casino floor.

Once you get through security and the hostess, you taken an elevator ride up fifty floors.  The lounge can vary depending on the night, but expect young to middle aged people and a hip hop soundtrack on Friday and Saturday nights.  The bar is fairly large and drink prices are standard club fare.  You can expect paying $8 for a shot of Skyy Vodka and about $10 for a mixed drink.

 The major draw of the lounge being the outdoor patio, which houses the incredible view of the Vegas skyline.  Depending on the night, a second DJ performers on the patio and keeps the night going.  Additionally, a bar is located on the patio which facilitates the boozing of the night.  The only reason I give VooDoo Lounge an average of three stars is because the past few times I've been by, the lounge seems pretty dead with not many party goers.  Furthermore, I was denied entrance once for my attire.

Nevertheless, the lounge is a cool spot to go an chill an have a few drinks and take in the view, especially with prices being somewhat generous and affordable.  Unfortunately, I've yet to try the steakhouse, but it's on my to do list.",BdV-cf3LScmb8kZ7iiBcMA,3,0,3,0Qea74cLG3aZNCWC5L_6jA

Me and my family recently ate at the steakhouse for a graduation and we were a large party of people. I would like to warn people about this restaurant because two people in my party became violently ill with food poisoning. Both ate the seabass, and both displayed the same symptoms about 2 hours after eating the food. When I filed a complaint, the Rio responded that they provided safe and quality service. I would be careful with choosing this restaruant as I have also put a call in to the Nevada Health department. I understand that these things happen, especially in other restaurants, but they way that they handled this matter was unprofessional. As a side note, for being an expensive steak restaurant, the steaks were average, I have had better steaks at outback.

Wagyu cows are the same as Kobe cows, they just don't or no longer come from Kobe Japan, (think Hennessy and cognac)

Wagyu is special because the cows are bred to have LOTS of marbled fat in the meat and suppose to be very tender and make you never want to eat another cow ever again.

Voodoo lounge does an excellent job of making this delicate meat taste like an expensive version of what i can get at a run down casino's buffet. My cut was over salted and tough which i was not expecting from wagyu beef

The entree isnt really an entree, you have to order your sides separate.

To those who cant tell the difference between Waygu and standard american beef this place is probably  4 to 5 stars. I can tell the difference and i am greatly disappointed.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,0,0,2,rf0xF9bFrqArAf_isJgplQ

Here's the deal: 

The drinks are expensive (and I'm from New York!).  $28 for a double of Jim Beam is a little more than insane and you know, um, highway robbery?

But here's what's even worse than insane drink prices:

I ordered a round of drinks (like 6 or 7) for those I was with, and I was given a credit card invoice to sign for $109. I wasn't given a bill, just an invoice.  It sounded expensive but not completely out of the question so I wasn't fazed by that. However, before paying I asked if we could add one more drink.  ONE. MORE. DRINK.  The bartender obliged (the double Jim Beam, above) and came back with yet another credit card invoice for me to sign (with the standard line for a tip, obvs).  The invoice was for $160. Seriously? We add one drink and the price goes up $51?! I asked another bartender to see my actual bill, which, several minutes later, was produced by our original bartender. Well, one look and apparently, he'd very generously already given himself a tip, which the credit card invoice didn't show since it was just a total. He apparently expected me not to notice and to tip on top of that. Slick.

If you like a side order of rip-off with your rooftop experience, then go to Voodoo. If you don't, well, there are lots of other options where they have slightly more class than to pull a number like that, even if the drinks are expensive.",azupW8UYwIzcFGchoEz-Dg,16,1,1,8kfCSvdnY3LIXjnjy8F8fw

Inside was a voucher for free admission for up to 4 people for VooDoo. We decided to check it out Saturday night 3/27/16. VooDoo is a steakhouse but also a nightclub. 

We arrived around 11pm. The entry line was short but slow moving. Once we got through the ID check and our hands stamped, we went up the elevator 51 stories. When you first walk in it's a lounge type area with a bar and some tables, but then when you walk outside that is where the Dj was playing and people were dancing. When we arrived it was pretty dead, not reminiscent of any other clubs I had been to before, but this was cool since we got to take some rooftop pics. After a while it started to fill up and was really crowded. The drinks were flowing and the music got louder. Only then did it start to feel like a nightclub-just a really small one. 

They do have bottle service if you are into that. It's pretty cool cause you can sit outside and take in the views. On this particular night the weather was amazing. It wasn't too warm, it wasn't too cold, it was just right. There was a bar outside and we ordered drinks. The bartender hooked us up with Patron margaritas for $14 each. This drink got me feeling goooood, it was really strong. Then a little while later we were hanging out inside, and we ordered margaritas and they made them with Jose Cuervo, and those drinks were $26 each? I am still confused as to how thing happened, but I am not complaining. All in all we had a good time and I would say this is a fun place to check out. My friends were both really drunk after that, so we didn't end up going anywhere else. Lightweights! I dont think I would come out of my way to come back here, unless it was to show someone.

It was around 1am and they close at 3am, but we still had to pay $10 cover charge for each of us, which was kind of a bummer. At the bar, the bartender told us that they ran out of the cups they use for their specialty drink The Cauldron. I don't know how they can run out, but apparently people can take those cups with them when they leave? But, at least the bartender was kind enough to split it into normal cocktail cups for us. The drink is definitely a strong one.

It has a great restaurant on the lower level and an excellent patio view of the strip. At one point I stopped hanging out with my friends and just stared at the view for awhile. The go-go dancers didn't hurt either. The Voodoo has three areas: the inside bar, the top patio and the bottom patio. Tables are available in all three areas but I think the best are on the top patio. There are different dj's for the outside and inside areas. The outside DJ played a mix of hip-hop and house. It was a really good mix of music. The drinks are great for the price. Really huge pours. Don't sleep on this fact. Three drinks at the Voodoo will have you on your butt.

It's at the Rio which is far away from everything else.  It has probably one of the best views of Las Vegas and the strip since it's on the 51st floor.  The only caveat is that there's only one elevator but it's a quick ride.  There's two main areas, the lounge area with the live band and the outside patio area with the DJ, bar, and the view.  The band was decent but if you want something current musically go outside and don't forget your jacket!  Heat lamps can only do so much in December.

It wasn't too crowded and it was what I expected in the lounge sense.  Lots of places to sit, a huge bar area with flashy bartenders, good drinks (try the witch doctor), an average outside area, and a good mix of people from locals to tourists like me.

After speaking with truly concerned, open, and apologetic management I decided to come back with my friend's bachelor party and hoped for the best. 

Booked a VIP table for us with bottle service because I know they're into that. Nice, attractive setup on the tray.  One bottle of new Amsterdam, Three mixers, lots of garnishes, extra glasses, and everything was constantly bussed and refilled.  I really have to give it to the staff for staying on top of this. 

Me?  I got a knob. I hate vodka (his night so his choice).  Nice pour, nice guy behind the bar. 

Speaking of bartenders...

We were seated inside right by the front entrance (not prime, but it was what it was) so we got a front row view of some really impressive show bartending. I find a lot of it to be gimmicky but damn, these guys know their craft. 

The view was incredible. Seriously. Can't stop thinking about it. 

As for the music and the real draw...

There are a few dancers scattered about. I felt bad for the girls outside because of the high winds and the low clothing. 

The girls inside were in a better position but was that a card table behind a screen behind one of them?  Not a huge deal. I doubt anyone noticed, but I'm the type of guy who wants to suggest a different tie knot based on facial structure so I did...


The music was a mix of 90s hip hop and other tracks.  Couldn't tell you what, I don't know club music but the DJ was fun to watch and almost everyone was dancing. Mission accomplished. 

As for the crowd it was great people watching because of the diversity. God knows I didn't fit in with any of the types so I sat back and watched as a younger crowd mixed with a sometimes older crowd and wondered where they're marketing to get such a mix. 

I enjoyed it, though.  

I gotta say, I'm really glad I talked to a receptive management, went back, and was able to show my soon-to-be-married friend a great night out.

But I have been to the VooDoo lounge twice (in three years) and had good fun both times.

2255361,2010-02-18,0,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"VooDoo is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. It's a bit difficult to describe, so bear with me.

Here's what I love: awesome view of The Strip, fun signature cocktails, yummy food, voodoo-ish decor and great music. Here's what I must warn you about because they're the kinds of things people complain about: high prices, enforced dress code, older crowd.

First, I'll cover the stuff I love. The restaurant and lounge are located at the very top of the Rio, so you get a wonderful view of Las Vegas from inside the restaurant, or you can go to the balcony of the lounge for a stunning outdoor view of The Strip. The view alone is worth the visit to VooDoo.

I am a die-hard seafood fan. And being that Las Vegas is in the desert, finding fresh seafood here is very difficult. The lobster at VooDoo is fresh, thick and scrumptious. If you love meat, the filet mignon is also to-die-for, and I'm salivating right now as I write this. 

I love, love, LOVE VooDoo's signature drinks. I highly recommend the Witch Doctor, which is an oversized cocktail that bubbles and steams like a witch's brew. Share with a friend.

In the lounge, you'll find one DJ inside and one outside on the balcony.  Or, you may find live music inside and a DJ outside. Whatever the musical situation is, you'll love it. DJs ordinarily play hip-hop and dance music. If there's a live band, they'll most likely play fun, sing-along tunes to engage the crowd.

Yes, there's a dress code. And being that I love fashion, you can imagine that's never been a hindrance for me. You can probably get in wearing jeans. Just stay away from flip flops, shorts and track suits.

Yes, VooDoo is pricey by most people's standards, but I think it's worth it. Bartenders pour heavy, the ambiance is great and as I said before, the view is beyond impressive. 

The crowd isn't your average nightclub crowd. But, I think that's a good thing. As such, VooDoo is very couples-friendly. So if you're in a long-term relationship and you're looking for a new place for date night, but you want to avoid the annoyances of the usual nightclubs, I recommend VooDoo. Great food. Great drinks. Great fun.

On a side note, my husband arranged a surprise birthday dinner for me at VooDoo years ago. He worked with the restaurant manager prior to the event, as he covered the entire bill, and they were wonderful about creating an affordable and delicious fixed menu for our dinner guests. We had a very memorable time and it was the best birthday I ever had.",2SoCvxdSZ0_USpUrVKlUNg,4,1,4,HLpvBUZBilVdxC-iP8EuaA

We went inside to take a break from dancing, get water and chat, and at one point some gross guys came in and started bothering us.

This view is so gorgeous that it makes up for the Voodoo Lounge's MANY SHORTCOMINGS (see below).

LOCATION: 2 points
I'm awarding an extra point for location, since it's just so phenomenal! You take a clear elevator to the 50th floor of the Rio (quite an experience in itself), then walk up a staircase to the rooftop. Stepping out onto that roof never fails to take my breath away and is one of the best natural highs ever!

SOUND: 2 points
Again, I'm awarding Voodoo an extra point for the music:
The sound system is THUMPING, and there's nothing quite like being on a 51storey rooftop and feeling the entire space vibrate! Their music selection may not be super original, but the DJs  are excellent at mixing it up and getting everyone to boogie. This is true for both the inside and outside dance floors.

CROWD: Zero points!
While this is obviously a favorite place for tourists due to the view, I wonder whether the Voodoo Lounge has given up on enforcing their dress code? Just because you're a tourist, doesn't mean you have to LOOK like one! Why anyone would wear flip-flops or Berks to a rooftop in Vegas is incomprehensible to me...

SERVICE: Zero points!
The employees here are rude and uncaring to a level beyond the usual Vegas jadedness:

A friend of mine works in Vegas and put us on the guest  list, unbeknown
to me. We paid the $20 cover, and were told that this entrance fee could be used towards food at the lounge. Except when we got upstairs to the lounge  they were done serving food (at 10:30pm!). My friend contacted me to let me know that we were on the guest list, and advised me to try getting our entrance fee refunded. Of course, the employee at the door couldn't care less. With the amount of people inside and $$$$$ they're making on food and drinks, couldn't they even attempt to have better customer service? Also, the bartenders are surly and drinks are expensive even for Vegas (though generously poured).

SUMMARY: Nice place to catch the view and get your groove on prior to clubbing, but definitely not perfect in my book!",-5aaGQbMA90Cp3krCTiX0w,3,2,4,Ed5ayNkA4K-Tx-F2AHTaLQ

Bates on the other hand is up about $1000.  I go to the room to watch some hockey and wait another half hour before our dinner reservations.
 
I come back to the table to find  Bates stacked with the ""great wall of $5 chips""... I'm talking about $2500 worth of $5 chips.  I beg him to leave but he's bombed and continues to blurt out loud, ""these people suck at poker and I'm gonna take all of their money"".  Which he probably would have, but he got so drunk he did not know what he was doing.  I watched him place $100 bets without ever looking at his hand.  Anyway, I could not get him away so I left and spent my first dinner in Vegas alone.  I could care less.
 
Which gets me to the point: I sat down and ordered Kobe carpaccio as a starter, plus a martini with blue cheese olives.  It was served with roasted golden beets and a very fine goat cheese rolled in lavender pollen.  Friggin awesome.  For the main course, I had a kobe ribeye (austrailian) that was brilliantly served with a veal shank bone roasted so the marrow ended up crispy on top.  This was truly a religious experience, topping the kobe ribeye with marrow.  Wine, you ask?  I kept it on the downlow... a 1991 DRC Richeborg did just well.  Just kidding... they had that on the menu for $15,000.  Hahahaha...
 
I went with a 2001 Gaja Brunello for $250.  All in all, I spent $450 of my winnings on an amazing dinner.
  
BTW - security just dropped off Bates.  They found him passed out on the 5th floor.  He's sound asleep.  I went back to the poker room and the guys at the table said he gave every $ back over time.  Sucks to be him.  I tried at least 5 times to get him to leave.  Oh well.

It costs $10 (on thursday) to go up and it is def worth it!

There's a cover here but they walk around the casino handing out free admission comp cards... Look for one of these or ask, it's probably not worth paying.  

When we showed up there was quite a line... a much longer line than I probably would've waited in.  We didn't wait but went up...  

Once upstairs, you start out in the inside lounge portion.  It's spacious and there's a pretty busy bar.  If you keep walking you'll find the outside, which is really what you go here for...  The Rio is a pretty tall building (50something floors) just off the strip, so your view is of the entire strip. Quite amazing scenery.  I can't really think of anywhere on the strip that compares.   Outside there is a pretty cool stairway that segways between the two levels... You can hang out on the stairway and it's pretty great being up so high in mid-air.  The music outside was loud, but there was something great about being outside with music blaring seemingly across the sky.  (The music itself... kinda standard top 40 pop.. think Pink).

Drinks are expensive but not outrageous.  Somewhere in the $9-12 range for a mixed drink.  I would not drink beer here, it will cost you nearly as much as a cocktail so you'll probably feel ripped off.  If you order inside, they gave us nicer really heavy plastic glasses, whereas outside it was kinda flimsy ones (though I think that was because they ran out too).  The bars were crowded though it wasn't too much of a wait for a drink.

The crowd itself is pretty schmucky...  They actually apparently market the Voodoo to attract a Latino crowd now, but there was a mix when we were there.  There were an excessive number of guys wearing button down and jeans.  The girls were all over the map from trampy to girls night out... The bottom level outside has a DIY stripper pole where girls can go and embarrass themselves.

There's a VIP area behind ropes with sofas and stuff where the kids who think they're rich take their friends.  The ropes are guarded by guys that look like the incredible hulk, something like 7' tall and 300 pounds.

When we went the parking garage was packed completely full, so we parked in a side lot and walked a bit.  Not too far, but it became a half hour ordeal just parking.

I'd go back for sure, but I wouldn't pay cover to be here and I might even go earlier just to avoid some of the schmuck factor.",sZxXpvmBUN2fSCtK_BZFoQ,3,2,4,P5RjDOcus7zQbFODEJdE0g

The strip is your backdrop while you're dancing and drinking out there.  Both areas also have their own bars so you don't need to go back and forth.  The indoor DJ was a little full of himself.  He would dub in his name into the lyrics of songs and whatnot and just kept screaming into the mic all night long.  There were also different forms of entertainment  such as, a contortionist, a freak who chewed glass and stuck a sword down her throat and a belly dancer who would let a python hang off of her body!

We decided to check out the place on a Friday night since it was already midnight and we had just arrived in Vegas. The guy at the front asked us if we were locals (apparently it was locals event). I said no, but we could be for one night *wink*. Whether it was my answer that got us in for free, or the fact that we were two young women, we were escorted to the elevators that take you to the 51st floor of Rio.

The view, 5 stars hands down. I felt like a baller hanging out on the huge balcony and partying on the outdoor dance floor, and isn't that what Vegas is all about? The music playing outside was ok--decent mix of top 40s and popular old school hip hop jams that I love. The bouncers and bartenders were really friendly-- a major plus since most of the time I just expect nightclub staff to be complete jerks.

The crowd is pretty mixed, which I appreciated because I don't know if I would have survived a night in a frat boy meat market environment that many other Vegas clubs tend to be. As for poppin' factor, I'd have to give it 2 stars--not crowded at all, which might be good for those that like having room to dance.

2724940,2015-04-22,7,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"Boo!  Been here twice.  Last week was a bad start to an overall meh experience.  
Went on a Wednesday night with a large group for a birthday party (not my idea).  The plan was to buy bottle service.  Trying to call in advance to get connected with a host was the worst experience.  Touch-tone phone number and a voice message required to get a table?  I never got called back by anyone.  

Anyways, part of the group is already inside while I and another guy arrive a bit later.  The host at the front podium (Dave) stated even local guys had to pay $20 to get in.   Mind you, I've worked for the nightlife industry for a few years here in Vegas to know that I'm not paying to get into a 'bad' club, off the strip, on a Wednesday.  When I told him we were getting bottle service upstairs, he almost didn't believe me.  He had to call up on his radio to confirm that we were indeed getting a table.   

So a table is confirmed.  We get in 'free'.   I ask the other guys how much they were charged: $10.   Dave was trying to charge me $20.   Was the staff just trying to make some extra money on the side?  We made sure to get our money back from their 'cover' fee.

Anyways... the view is the only thing they have going for this place and honestly, there are plenty of other clubs and bars/lounges with way better views ON THE STRIP.  (Foundation Room, Mix Lounge, even the bar at the Stratosphere).  The crowd is just a whole mix of everything but mostly an older, I-don't-know-better-than-to-go-to-Voodoo crowd.  The DJ was super inconsistent.  No real great transitions from one song to the next, a mix of hip-hop, then some rock and roll, classic rock (what?) and maybe some edm type stuff.  

I also asked if there were any local or industry night deals on table service.  Nope. $700 for two bottles of sky vodka on a Wednesday night at an unpopular club. At least I didn't foot the bill.

It's not exactly the ""happening"" spot these days, and it's on the other side of the freeway from The Strip, so my expectations were fairly low. I was happily impressed, however - this ended up being an awesome experience, and a ton of fun!

The DJ was awesome - very chill, played good music, and was not arrogant. I love where he was situated - right on the edge with the Strip view behind him! It made the ambiance seem like you were in the movie ""21"", the ideal Vegas party setting.

Thankfully, walking on the way in through the Rio, a promoter was handing out free pass cards if we went before midnight, so the four of us didn't pay cover. (I love when that happens!)

Drinks are Vegas expensive, but at least they had some cool bartenders interacting with us and putting on a show while making drinks!

2852904,2011-08-18,0,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"So recently the boyfriend and I were on vacation. We've stayed at the Rio before, but never got a chance to try the steak house. Needless to say I wasn't too impressed. 

Service: I was torn on this. The woman who seated us was nice and pleasant. Sat us as quickly as she could. After being seated we were approached by who we thought was our waiter but was just a backup for the other waiters on the floor. He brought us our drinks and bread, then the actual waiter decided to come over and ask if we wanted anything to drink. Uhm, no already taken care of. Needless to say this guy was less than impressive. He treated us like we didn't belong in this ""high class"" steak house. He asked us three times if we needed the menu explained to us, even after declining the first time he asked. After we ordered he pretty much just ignored us like we had the plague. 

Food: The food here is so-so. My boyfriend ordered the fillet mignon, and I ordered their specialty Menage a trois. The food took forever to come out, which struck me as odd since it wasn't very busy. When it did finally come out our waiter just threw it in front of us and went to attend other tables. The fillet mignon was not cooked the way my boyfriend asked, it was well done instead of medium well. The menage a trois was a mess. The lobster tail, and shrimp were completely over cooked. I had to cut them with a knife to eat them. The steak was cooked right, but lacked any real flavor. 

Overall: I would never come back to this place. I would suggest to save your money and time and just go downstairs to the American Bar and Grille. Much better food and staff.",2a2dDKLFImkKQZsOCkO39Q,0,0,2,gn6LymbXXrR8UaJa-kkjlg

Not worth it: The food. As a disclaimer, I did come here for a dinner using the invitation I got from the Rio for NYE, and they probably weren't able to give attention to detail for each plate, but I don't think it should be a valid reason for the poor quality of food I experienced. 

Here's some dialogue to give you a sense of what was going on.

""All the steaks were done medium to medium-rare"", says the waiter.
Well, my steak is rare. I prefer medium, can you do anything about this?
""No, I'm sorry sir, all steaks were done the same for everybody,"" says the waiter.
------- The steak remained raw.

""Oh my gosh! This is a delicious! What is it?"" says someone at my table.
""It's a potato croquette,"" says the waiter
_____Mind you that the mashed potato used in the recipe had the consistency and flavor like it came out of a box____________

__________________

Okay, so back to the steak. Other than the fact that it was raw, it was completely tastless, except for the grounded peppercorn on top, which the steak was obviously just dunked in. It didn't taste like I was eating steak. It tasted like I was eating rubbery pepper.

The dessert was 90% pretty looking white chocolate in the formation of a flower, with a cake in the middle making the other 10%. Or should I say that remaining 10% was more like 80% whipped cream and 20% cake.

I had a filet mignon, which was not as good as what we prepare at home and maybe slightly better than Outback Steakhouse - maybe.  The asparagus and mushrooms were disappointing sides.

Back to our time while at the VOODOO! We had a great time at this nightclub. We reserved an inside table on Friday 4th of July. We were given a table near the exit to the rooftop. It was perfect since we wanted to have AC while still being close to the outdoor dance floor and AMAZING view. There is nothing like the view and we were pleased with the service over all. The club was spacious and we didn't have to dance inches away from other sweaty people like at other clubs. The music was great and there were various age groups there.

We were skulking through the casino when someone pushed a card in our hands for ""VIP entry"" into the Voodoo Lounge.  They got thrown into the back of my handbag until the last night in Vegas when we considered two things:

1. We hadn't yet had a decent cocktail.
2. It sounded like there were good views to be had at the top floor.

The door people certainly do enforce the dress code, turning away a couple wearing casual sportswear and flip flops. We were hardly dressed at the height of fashion, but we weren't slovenly either, so we were welcomed in.

The place was near empty, which wasn't a surprise, being late on a Monday, and the large screen tv was playing Scarface, that was a plus. 

The outdoor area, while empty, does have great potential. I do loves me a cage to dance in every now and then. And being this high up is naturally euphoric. There is a very expansive view of the strip, it's a great photo opportunity. But you know what else? The expansive view of the strip means you are nowhere near the strip. Talk about feeling left out.

Anyway, for all the potential of the outside dance area, the music being played was not impressive. Greenday, twice, in an hour, at a club with a ""hip"" dress code?

We went to the bar and ordered a Manhattan. What we like in a Manhattan is for it to be stirred and served with a cherry that's not one of those chemical neon abominations. What we got was a drink tossed about in the air and shaken with such fervor it had an inch of froth on the top and we couldn't even see the dyed and brined cherry. $13.
Apparently, some people like that. But a cocktail that's 90% showmanship isn't our thing. That's Vegas for you, I guess.

2956097,2011-06-26,2,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"The thing about VooDoo is that you need to know what to expect when you go here.  It feels like one of those lounges you may find in the lobby of a hotel tucked away in a corner, decorated to attract an upscale crowd with a mix of slow and dance-inducing music.  It's a chill venue, not overhyped by the media or locals but a nice location to get a drink. It's one of those places.  Certainly not Vegas nightclub standards, but not at all mediocre either. Diamond in the rough.

So if you understand that this is what you're looking for, it's a great venue.  Parking was very easy and the line wasn't too long.  I wasn't on the guestlist and I still got inside in less than maybe 20 minutes.  Not bad.

The interior is nicely decorated and they have a great balcony view.  Although there was a lot of people, walking around wasn't too bad. The circular interior is built to have traffic move inside and out onto the balcony, and crowds are always moving.

The crowd energy is fairly mild.  Not too noisy, no one is overly drunk or causing a scene.  Everyone is pretty considerate, and just trying to have some modest fun.

It's a great place to go BEFORE hitting a Vegas nightclub, which is exactly how my group and I treated it.  We got a couple drinks here, got a little buzzed and walked across the street to the Moon at the Palms Hotel.

The reason why I'm giving it a three stars is because although it is a nice venue, I don't know what gap this place fills in.  The drinks aren't much cheaper than a real nightclub, and the place feels like a high school junior prom in the first hour where nobody's on the dance floor and just floating around.  If you want a cheap drink, there's tons of lounges everywhere and you don't need to wait a very long line.  I haven't tried the food so I have no comment on that portion.  People may argue that the lounge is upscale and you pay extra for the experience and the view, but in my opinion it's not an absolutely necessity.

PRO: Nice pre-club venue to get a little buzzed, chill out

  The music was great they have a dj and he was playing a bit of everything. Music you can dance for sure!

The restaurant was definitely a 4 Star experience. I had a New York Steak 18oz Medium Rare ($38) and it was just right. None of their entrees come with any sides but I highly recommend the Mac & Cheese or the Cajun French Fries. They're $8 each and the steaks are definitely worth it (common you're already paying this much to eat at the buffet, don't be cheap). The first time I was here I tried the 24oz porterhouse as well and it was great ($42).

Additional Information

This place is usually packed during the summer. The outdoor view is amazing. Everyone is dancing and the music is usually ""bumpin."" Bartenders here are great as well. The ladies usually order a ""Witch Doctor,"" pretty much a giant Mai Tai with more liquor in a giant Goblet. It comes with dry ice and has all the cool effects. 

If you haven't eaten dinner yet and plan on going to the lounge anyway, eat here to save the cover charge. I've been here 4x and I believe the cover charge ranges from $15-20 (depending how busy it is).

VooDoo Lounge.
We ended up not getting there until almost last call (it was a Sunday night, so still early by Vegas standards). We only ended up getting one drink and one shot each, which was fine- we were there to see the view we had heard about. No disappointment here!! It's so exhilirating to be up that high and see all those lights in a way you just can't when directly on the Strip. It is definitely worth the trip to be able to see that.
Other than the great view, the lounge itself is small and seemed to attract a mixed crowd- not specifically young or old, just all over the place. I think the music was more slow jams than anything when we were here... in fact, I'm having a flashback of ""Time of My Life"" being the last song played (and no, not talking about the B.E.P. version). The bartender made a mean chocolate cake shot. :) I think if I were to come here with my S.O., we would have a good time, as it seems more couples-oriented than other places (although, I think ""lounges"" normally are geared more towards couples... maybe).

Now...the bad part. Drinks were anywhere from $12 to $15. That's pretty expensive. But I guess everything is expensive in Vegas. The crowd was a bit ghetto. And the guys a bit douchey. But we just shooed them aside and still had a great time anyway.

This place is really really nice (the decor, ambiance and outdoor scenery), but I was not happy with the crowd here. I don't know if it's always like that or if we just went on an off night, but how horrible... My friends (in our early & late twenties) went to this club on a Saturday night hoping to try their dry ice fish bowl called the witch doctor. That was the original reason why I picked this place because it looked so cool especially with the nice rooftop view, but when we got inside... the crowd were in their late 40s or 50s.... which was such a turn off. We couldn't find anyone to dance with  and I felt as I walked further into the club, everyone was getting older. I felt bad because I had picked such a horrible place when we could have gone to a newer & cooler club like Marquee :( One of my friend even left the club...

Outdoor was AMAZING, there was a beautiful view of Vegas, and there's also an OUTSIDE downstairs dance floor with a pole, which we almost missed out on because you cannot tell that there was a downstairs. Indoor, there are stairs leading downstairs, but I'm not sure if that leads outdoors. I think the indoor downstairs might have been the restaurant. Don't let the pictures fool you...it fooled me.

3250689,2011-05-17,0,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  You cannot beat the view...it is definitely the prettiest in my opinion...yes, even better than Top of the World in the Strat!

You are treated like a king/queen the moment you arrived as you travel up a glass elevator that overlooks the strips to the 50th floor of the Rio.  When you enter the Voodoo Cafe, you'll notice it's uniquely decorated with voodoo type drawings on the walls.  Always ask to sit on the strip side of the restaurant...it's where you'll get the best views.

The food here is great!  I repeatedly get the Manage a Trois which has lobster, filet, and shrimp with mashed and veggies.  It is phenominal!  I'm not a big eater and I will sit there and clear the plate...I just love it.  They have some great sauces you can try with your filet as well.  

My husband has had the chicken once and steak several times.  He is always happy with his meal.  The Witch Doctor is a really cool drink to order if you're there with friends from out of town.  Oh, and remember to order the Mac N Cheese.  It is the BEST gourmet Mac N Cheese in town...and trust me, I try the Mac N Cheeses at every nice place we go to in Vegas looking for one that can top Voodoo...and none have yet.

Best thing to do is set your reservation for 20-30 before sunset...you can google for the time since it changes throughout the year.  Head in, order a bottle of wine, and then head out to the roof deck to check out the sunset and the amazing view.  It's just gorgeous!  

After your meal, head up to the Voodoo Lounge.  It's intimate and there is no cover when you eat at the restaurant.  You can even leave and come back later when the club gets busy and cut the line as long as you have your bill from dinner.  There is a deck up there as well (which is the 51st floor) and it's simply beautiful at night.  And since the Rio is just a block off of the strip, the view is awesome and unobstructed.

Oh, and check before you go...we're not gamblers and were tipped to get a players card.  We were just there again last month for our 10th year anniversary dinner and with the player's card we saved 20% on our bill!!!  Love it!",X26028b-8PmvFyprCfOiWg,4,2,5,8GuzbH2KbeWxWqVWN8K5mQ

So my friends & I stumble into the Rio last Saturday night and try out their new theater/nightclub: The Crown...the only saving grace from that place is that they hired a pole dancer that actually did more than shake her booty...she did some pole tricks. So after we left that meat market we stumbled onto something more intriguing. 

The VooDoo lounge...

mysterious- check
dark- check
on the roof top overlooking the strip- check
non-meat market vibe- check
good tunes & good people- check

This place definitely made my night. There was a good mix of people with a more laid back vibe, which makes for a better experience. The view was killer and the weather was perfect. I'd definitely want to spend another Vegas night here....or at least end it here. You can dance outside on one of their 2 dancefloors and the tunes were just right. The stairs were a bit of a challenge in heels, so next time i'll try and wear something more forgiving on the feet.

3293752,2008-07-21,1,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"Voodoo Lounge might possibly be the easiest club to get into in Las Vegas.  This is a good thing and easily a bad thing.  The good thing is that the place is a very chill spot, one that doesn't get overwhelmed with hordes of people and the staff is relatively friendly from the door to the bar.  The best thing of course that is undeniably the only reason some folks may come here for is the fantastic view of Las Vegas.

The bad is a little more overwhelming than the good.  To start, the place is so dated that the decor is uber cheesy and looks super cheap as a result.  The crowd is closer to a middle age'd generation than anything under 35.  Music will vary depending on the night but its nothing good enough to lounge to or exciting enough to bust a move.  Prices can be suspect depending on the type of drink and bottle service is not recommended here at all.

Place is nice, dim-lit, comfy booths. Food is terrific. Yes expensive, but thats what you get. Free access to club upstairs, which sucks ass but great 51st-floor outdoor view. Yes, we went early to the club, but they had 20-year old mashed hip hop and even some R+B crap that made me wanna puke. As for fellow yelpers who insist on witch doctor, I didnt wanna pay $30 per person for a drink to find out when I can have a very nice glass of red wine for $13.
We ordered wedge salad, cold seafood platter, and surf and turf with shrimp. Portions arent gonna fill up anyone with a hearty appetite, but quality is borderline spectacular. Our waiter was very attentive, (adrian?)
Load up on the bread to fill up, unless you are a google majority shareholder.

I saw a group of 3 bald headed, full arm tattooed guys with their chicks come in and sit, all with sneakers, shorts, and TANK TOPS. For dinner. No joke.

3363769,2011-03-19,0,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"Review for the Lounge/Club:
Every time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). 

The DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. 

Also, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. 

For newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. 

For the Restaurant:

I've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price.",FVc4g9P96Jmc47P8ERywEw,0,0,3,boC8bnvr1qh2VYwFw9Gv2A

I am not a frequent Night club visitor by any means but I was in Las Vegas for an industry awards dinner and I did win an award so of course I ""had to"" celebrate at the after party with my peers.  I had no idea the view was so amazing from the rooftop bar.  It blew my mind it was so beautiful.  The drinks were very tasty.  We got bottle service at our table inside  (it was a little chilly, even for this Reno girl, to stay outside long unless you were outside dancing) and our large group was treated well by staff.  
They have a photographer who will take your photo and then you can purchase it after if you like.  She got a great shot and it was something we could show to our bosses without any embarrassment later too.  Better than any of us could take. 

The place was crowded so I'm sure it's hard to keep the floors and restrooms clean but that would be my only minus and they weren't too bad at all.

So we go to the VIP line, I just got in line and some girls were saying they r not letting any men in. I just went in and they stopped my bf and told him he needs to go to the back of the other line because this line is for the ""list"" I tried to slip this ass some cash he was some blackass BIG man, he wasn't tring to hear it mean while I saw lots of money being exchanged. So my bf told me to go ahead. So I did. Then 10 mins later he was in, I was like what happen he said he paid someone else the 20bucks to cut in front of them I said what a way to be innovative. So we had a couple of drinks a couple or dances, the restrooms were packed.

-awesome view
-good music
-free admission before 10 pm/local ladies free
-pretty laid back dress code (they have signs saying otherwise but a lot of the people I saw were in athletic wear/flip flops etc.)

Other than that, it's okay. This place is basically a dance floor on a roof top. Came here on a Monday and it was pretty low key, mostly locals or birthday/bachelorette groups.

One thing I think is kinda lame is that they have seats/tables but you can only sit there if you are VIP/buying bottle service. Thing is, no one was buying bottle service - there were a bunch of roped off empty tables inside and outside. They kicked out anyone who sat down. I mean, it's their business, but if it were up to me I'd let people sit there and ask them to move once someone actually bought bottle service. It just looked kinda sad seeing all that emptiness.

Take the glass elevator that's a visual treat of the city as it climbs up to elevator doors that opens up to a dimly lit hallway. Bar and lounge-like setting with purple accents wrapped around in glass with a view. A stupendous concept of a dancefloor outdoors on the terrace that envelopes with Vegas air.

My feet on high heel shoes ached as it did its twinkie moves my legs allows it as I execute some real simple dance moves on concrete flooring. Not good for my dancing feet. DJ music is that of club dancing type. Not well-spun mix of music interspersed after another. Awesome to be able to sit and just relax on the VIP table and seating area. A nice privilege with attentive host and servers. (Not awesome without ""VIP"" reservation which means ""standing only"").

The view alone was terrific, and the service was delightful.  The restaurant is located on the 50th floor of the Rio Hotel.  It is decorated in contemporary western art such as the giant metal t-bone hanging on the wall next to the host counter.
We were taken to the table by a very nice woman who acknowledged my birthday thanks to the lady at the door downstairs (we - ah-hem, no the boys, were late for the reservation).  She let the restaurant know I was there and to hold our reservation.
We were seated by the window and our drink order was taken promptly.  I ordered the crab cakes and the boys ordered salad as an appetizer.   The crab cakes were crispy on the outside and sweet and juicy on the inside.  The boys enjoyed their salads.
The waiter suggested the Chilean Sea Bass, and M's boss ordered that entree.  To his delight it was delicious.  I ordered a filet with a wine sauce and asparagus.  All sides are a la carte and enough to share.  M ordered a filet as well with a pepper sauce.  The steaks were tender, juicy and cooked to order.
The waiter brought a plate with 3 tiny desserts and a lit candle for my birthday.  The ""boys"" ( I use that term loosely) sang Happy Birthday quietly and I enjoyed what seemed to be a mango/cream custard, a chocolate wafer thingy and another chocolate item.  It was sweet of them to do that.
After dinner, M and I went upstairs to the club and he bought me the famous Witch Doctor drink.  It was a huge, fruity, sweet, dry ice steamin' concoction that made my birthday!",ddZffVYvHsCIhylU5UG-dA,0,0,5,Ci1PqUEva4EpGjbQJb8gWA

We made reservations through the operator of the hotel for VooDoo after the Penn and Teller Show.  When we got there, they wouldn't honor them because we were late.

I didn't even know VooDoo Lounge was a steak house/restaurant. I've only been to the lounge itself and experienced the nightclub aspect of it.

Let me say that if you want to meet guys: this is it! lol
Not because it's a club but, because it's a steakhouse. You know, men love their meat!!! No-pun-intended...kinda.
Almost every table had men of 5+ and zero to one girl eating with them. It was strange! 
Although my  table consisted of 4 girls and 1 guy...so, take from that what you will.

I already ate and didn't have much of an appetite so, I ate the beef steak tomato salad. It was good but, come on, $10 for a small to medium plate of tomatoes??! COME ON.
I had a chance to taste my friends' plates and everything was pretty on point. The lamb was yummy! Although I may be biased since it is my all-time favorite entree..everrrrr. And that mac and cheese of theres --- WOW!!! It reminds me alot of Yardhouse's mac and cheese...probably because of the truffle oil in it. SAMPS THAT!!! Definitely.

Other than the view, the best aspect of eating at the restaurant is that you can get into the club without paying. YES, WITHOUT PAYING!!! In Vegas, not paying for entrance to any club is a treasure, pleasure, and all around good time already!!!!!!!!!! Definitely one less thing to pay for. 

It was packed which is expected on a weekend. Good mix of people. Quite a few more young people than I expected. Music was ""ehh"" but, fun is always brought about when you're partying with friends. So, it was a good night =)

The outside was phenomenal. Two LARGE dance floors, a bar, and a gorgeous view (check out the pictures)! No place to sit unless you reserved a spot with bottle service. The music was ok and the dance floor was packed... till they had some breakdancing contest and started playing some weird shit. 90% of people left the dance floor and the friends I was with didn't feel like dancing to that music. I mean... I didn't pay $20 to wait in line and watch someone else dance (yes... I was dancing... leave me alone).

The drinks were kinda weak. Someone got me my first drink, it was $12 and weak as hell. After that one I knew I had to ask for something stronger (if I wanted to keep dancing, that is....) so I got a double vodka and cranberry ($24) which was much better but way too expensive.

I'd recommend checking this place out at least once for the view. That's all.....",VzzxTAOi3jFaPlwgkVC5IA,3,3,2,mORAmVvbiyvJUL4EqKrOJA

We had 17 girls (bachelorette) and so we got in no problem. This place was pretty. It had a outside area and a inside area. 

Ambiance
There was a pole (spinning pole)... I'm not used to a spinning pole but was able to get one spin... But the rest were hard haha. I have a stationary pole so I'm used to spinning on that. So spinning pole at the outside dance floor.

Inside dance area had mini stages for girls to dance on. That was fun. With glowing lights... It was like a stripper joint. But it's not. The music is different inside the club and outside. Outside more hip hop and the inside had more house electronic. 

Drinks
Didn't buy any. Pre partied and I didn't really drink cuz I was sick. 

Location
At the Rio. The bachelorette party was staying there so very convenient for the drunk girls - and yes we had some. 

Bathroom
Expect lines ladies

Crowd
Very mixed crowd - very little Asians... But everything else was there. We were really the only Asians.

The view *is* great, and if you go for bottle service out on the deck, it can be a very special place to spend an evening with friends for a special occasion. The DJ plays a pretty eclectic mix (I never thought I would hear a techno-remix of Pink Floyd), and the crowd seems to be be pretty nice. If you have a good spot on the deck, you will get some folks hoping to hone in on your action. The staff seem to be really attentive (frequent ice refills!) which is a definite plus.

The food and drinks are so-so. The ""Witch Doctor"" is a fun-drink for a special occasion from a entertainment viewpoint, but I wouldn't really rate it as a decent cocktail. It tasted a little too much like artificial food coloring, and not really enough like anything else.  The food portions are huge, but the there is a little something missing in execution every time, and in a few cases things are quite off. For example, the hush-puppies look like some kind of fritter, and the beignets look like hush-puppies. Don't get me wrong, it was all pretty edible, and in some cases tasty. The seafood served is plentiful, but they could cook and chill the shrimp a little better to avoid that ""this might kill you"" look, and they could use a little seasoning in the pot for the seafood across the board.

The decor is reminiscent of a french quarter nightclub, with strange ""voodoo"" markings and symbols - courtesy of black light neon paint on black walls, and plush purple drapings.

Our party of three ordered the same entree on the varied menu, the ""menage a trois."" A succulent combination of lobster tail, grilled shrimp, and filet, it was beautifully paired with wasabi mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.  We felt the $45 price tag was worth the super indulgence to our senses, and bellies.

You'll see many familiar items on the menu, catering to the traditional American fare like the ""Hellfire Hotwings,""  or the ""Mystic Crab and Artichoke Dip.""  

We thoroughly enjoyed our food, loved the crab and artichoke dip, as well as the assortment of fresh breads served at the table.

The only downside to this restaurant, as with most eateries and clubs in Las Vegas, is the price for a cocktail.  We were all a bit chilled that night, so we ordered coffee with irish cream and chambord.  We paid $16 for drinks we would have paid half the amount for in Phoenix.

3987252,2009-02-21,1,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"I first have to mention how grateful I am to the staff at VooDoo for putting up with my group's shenanigans.  It's been a while since I organized a large-scale restaurant outing, and I should have remembered to lower my expectations.  First we had a reservation for seven at 8:15, then a side group got a separate reservation for four.  In the afternoon, two cancelled, so we consolidated the arrangements into a single reservation for nine.  Based on what I knew about the restaurant, I was surprised that they could be so flexible only a few hours before the Saturday night rush.

Four of us arrived on time and waited in the bar...and waited, and waited, and waited.  Ultimately, we wrote off one friend entirely, but the two earlier cancellers were back in, so we changed from nine to ten.  All of this was no problem for the staff.  Soon after, they seated the four of us, despite our uncertainty about the arrival time of our friends.

Ultimately, they came almost an hour late.  In the meantime, we had ordered some drinks and wine.  In my mind, I was trying to invest just enough in the table to keep them from throwing us out, but at no time were they anything short of gracious and accommodating.  

Much later, one severely drunk friend fell asleep in his chair and then had to be literally carried out by two of my other friends.  The VooDoo people never batted an eye.  They even gave us a complimentary Bananas Foster for our 30th-birthday friend.  When it was time to pay, we asked to split the bill across seven credit cards.  I wish that I could remember our waiter's name, but I've discarded the receipt.   I made sure to tip VERY well.

Now, the rest of the experience:  We found this place through the magazine in our hotel room, and it seemed like a great option for our one big meal while in town.  The restaurant is on the 50th floor of the Rio, and the view from our table was spectacular.  I was surprised that it was never full in there on a Saturday night.  We did not go upstairs to the lounge, but we saw some interesting characters (and a lot of flesh) coming and going with that purpose.  The restaurant seemed somewhat more touristy and less ultra-hip than the magazine made out.  There is a minor dress code (no sneakers, flip-flops, torn jeans, or t-shirts) to keep things just a little classy.  We had a fine time overall, and the food was very good.

I started with a Witch Doctor appetizer sampler.  When it arrived, I was disappointed by its small size, and by the realization that all four items were fried.  Crab cake, coconut shrimp, tasso ham beignets, and rock shrimp hush puppies:  they were all tasty, but at $18 for a small plate of glorified fried seafood, I felt a little bit taken.

My entree wiped out any trace of bad feelings.  I really wanted the Australian #8 Wagyu Ribeye, but at $15 per ounce with a 5-ounce minimum...well, let's just say that I wasn't caught up enough in the decadent spirit of Las Vegas to blow $60 on a tiny steak.  Instead, I ordered the 12-ounce ($38) Wagyu Flat Iron steak, with thyme butter and (sigh) applewood smoked bacon.  I usually like my steaks unadorned, but this thing was amazing.  Every bite a sensuous thrill.  Worth every dollar.  For a side, I got the truffle-onion macaroni and cheese, which was interesting but not as good as the other items.  I tried a bite of my friend's Chilean sea bass, and it gets a thumbs-up too.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.

The meal overall was a great success, once everybody showed up.  The food was very good but not spectacular, and the service far exceeded expectations.",6EHbIv5w2I4XbXs3dG_D1Q,6,3,4,_jKiAz8_usE6Z0dyk829Xg

When I first came to VooDoo Lounge 2 years ago, I had an amazing time - fun group of friends, good drinks and decent music. This past trip, the group of friends was still fun, the drink was smaller and now in a plastic goblet and the music was awful. D*ck in a box is funny yes, but the whole song techno remixed...really? Actually the really?! moment came when the theme song to Gilligan's Island was techno remixed. Le sigh...

No wonder they took the free guestlist before 10:30pm off their website and have 3 or 4 people handing out free ""VIP"" admission passes in the hotel lobby. They are now good before midnight which is a perk because up until 11:30pm this place is pretty dead. The one benefit of the lounge is still the view. Best view I've seen of the strip - better than Ghost Bar. I don't think I'll be coming back...unless someone tells me the music is better :P",NsqDhj79N8x5NamFCRLAsA,4,2,3,TUfTd9S8KTUK85Tns1mKSA

You enter the VooDoo through the Rio casino, after passing the bouncer you take an elevator up to the 50 something floor. (Entrance was free on a Monday night) From here you can access the inside bar or go outside- and I suggest you go outside. 

The rooftop view is AMAZING! There are a few sectioned off couches for VIP bottle service, and plenty of room to dance to the DJ. The outside never got super crowded, which made it a great place to socialize. Smoking is allowed on the rooftop. 

Make sure you order the VooDoo cocktail, there are at least 8 different types of alcohol in it- but you can't taste any of them. Delicious.

This was no Denny's for sure I didn't know steak could be so good.  Thick, juicy, piping hot, dripping in warm blood, melt in your mouth good steak.  This thing was so tender you could eat it even if you didn't have teeth. 
      I was a little dissapointed that they didn't have any appetizers that a seafood hater could eat, couldn't eat the bread because I hate sourdough.  I sipped my tea while my husband munched down some really stinky coconut shrimp.  
     I would not recomend this place if your afraid of heights, it's on the 50th floor of the Rio Hotel.  The view was beautiful but the elevator ride up was less than fun.  It runs on the outside of the building, and it's cold cold cold.  I think the draft from it also made the place freezing.  There are also doors to the outside deck in the cafe making it windy in there too.  Maybe in the summer it's probably not so bad but in late January I'd recomend a coat.

Got a drink right away and was able to find a dancing/standing spot right against the outside wall and literally just took in all the breath taking views of Vegas.  I have lived in Vegas 8 months now and never seen it from that type of angle! Wow absolutely breathtaking.  It was perfect weather with a soft breeze.  Words cant express how amazing it was.  

The music was good a nice mix of today and even some 90's thrown in.  The people were not really my thing, lot of overly drunk grouping and grinding, but you never know how any club your going to go is.  

We got one free drink with our chippendale ticket stubs (double score!!!!!!!)

We got a half off discount to get in for $10 apiece, which was nice, but we very quickly discovered why, especially in comparison to other similar places.  The elevator lines both on the 2nd and 51st (or however high it actually is) floors have NO organization whatsoever.  Once you get in the queue, it's every person for him/herself.  You get to meet really quality a-holes and bitches this way.  Awesome.

Once you step off, the sounds and views look promising.  We ordered on recommendation a very pricey ""witches brew"" which was a large glass of rum-based punch with dry ice for that bubbly look.  Trust me, we got a lot more attention walking around with that than I ordinarily would like.

There's virtually NOWHERE to sit unless you have a table reservation.  That blows.  Inside it's a long bar and a bunch of tables.  Once you venture outside, it's an entirely different sound system (and both were crackling all night long...  hello, I believe it may be time to schedule a service or a replacement even) and vibe.  There are even tables outside and STILL no seats, so it's just a gigantic free-for-all.

Aside from getting hit on by a very large and very drunk young gentleman who seemed destined to pick out us larger women from the crowd (and consequently getting a LOT of his Grey Goose bottle for myself and my crew), it was relatively uninteresting outside as well.  The view is gorgeous and even in the blistering wind it was totally chill, but the bar outside is insane and there's a bunch of random drunkies trying to make a dance floor out of a smaller space.

When you've been to the Ghostbar at the Palms, you just can't settle for cheap imitations.  This is a different crowd with a different vibe; it's hard for me use any other adjective than ""not as classy.""  As much as I enjoyed the free liquor (I had to bust out the fake engagement ring -- that's how bad the situation got) and hanging out with my people, we basically took off after like an hour.  I waited in line for the bathroom, but the line never moved, so I mobilized the group and just took off.

I don't know the first thing about running an establishment like this, but I do know what I like -- line control, a bigger space for a dance floor, and places to sit that don't involve overpriced bottles of alcohol and drunk desperate dudes.

4253576,2009-12-29,6,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"I think Voodoo Lounge is a polarizing force in the Las Vegas nightlife arena.  Many people decry its lack of sophistication and its lower socioeconomic demographic.  Others feel that the Voodoo Lounge is a breath of fresh air from the self-important clubs on the Strip that charge $14 for a bottle of domestic beer and where people are too busy posturing and primping to just have fun.

Maybe because my wife and I go clubbing so rarely, we enjoy places like the Voodoo Lounge.  Even though we didn't see any knockouts like you do at the megaclubs, there was a great mix of people.  To wit, in the course of 15 minutes I saw:  a late 40's Midwestern housewife throwing hands in air like she just didn't care, two gay Aussies hopping around with 44 oz. magnums in their hands, two cute Japanese girls who spoke 10 words of English between them, an Armenian dude with the craziest perm/baldspot/mullet hairstyle and a black transvestite who proceeded to dance with all the aforementioned.

Despite everyone's different backgrounds, there were no putos staring people down, no fighting or jostling for attention.  What was present was a reasonable amount of space to dance, the ratio of women to men was about even and the song selection was fantastique.  Highlight of the night:  watching a slightly overweight, mid 30's hipster dude break out the 1/32 beats while pop locking to Salt-N-Pepa's ""Push It"".  I (perhaps foolishly) thought that hip hop was best danced at a 4/4 beat, but this amazing man proved that cramming four times the normal amount of moves into a song can produce amazing and not to mention extremely entertaining results.

I'm sure that Voodoo is not for everyone, but if you're looking for an unpretentious place to drink, see a bevvy of interesting people and want to dance with no ridiculous dress codes however the fuck you please then I would definitely suggest this establishment.  (2nd favorite highlight of the night: watching Chinese guy throw back his head and howl with unbridled joy when the DJ mixed B.I.G.'s ""Hypnotize"" with DeadMau5's remix of ""Longest Road"".)

Added bonus:  Drinks are relatively pricey but damn if they're not heavy handed with the pours!  We ordered a round of six shots of Don Julio and the bartender used what had to be at least 3/4 of a full bottle for the order!

Additional bonus:  Dancing outside on a rooftop bar in the middle of a desert winter makes for a chilly beginning, but on the flipside, you can go as hard as you want without worrying about those unsightly sweat stains.",3iocNPlPThAG2ZaNtUo4TQ,6,5,4,Hl0oXhgp-giquHqFSyUUXA

I stuck out like a whitehead on prom night; it was that uncomfortable. 

We got a VIP bottle service table on the roof overlooking the city. Normally, you'd have to drop about $1000 for something like that, or so I was told. The view is spectacular enough from up there. I'm not into the club scene per se, so this was a rare occasion for someone like myself. They spun some typical contemporary hip-hop, all of which sounded the same. We sucked down a few Stoli-heavy drinks before calling it.

4309394,2013-11-21,3,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"I got to checkout the Voodoo Rooftop Nightclub on the Sunday of my last night of my most recent trip to Vegas.  It was my first time here, and it was a very interesting experience.  The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Voodoo is the view.  It was awesome!  I felt like I could see almost all of Vegas.  Besides the view, what made the experience most interesting was that they were having a celebration for the 238th birthday of the Marines.  At least 90% of the people at Voodoo that night where either Marines in uniform, or the significant others of those Marines.  It seemed like an awesome party for them, but since my friend and I were not Marines, we were two of the few civilians that where just here to have a good time.  Although the Marines seemed like they were having a great time, it felt like we had crashed a private party.  It just wasn't a fun time for me at all.  

Voodoo is an okay place with a great view. Hopefully it will be more fun if I ever visit again.  If not for the Marines, this place would have been empty. They had great energy, but I just felt like an uninvited guest.

4321548,2008-08-14,1,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"So there we were, in Vegas on a Saturday.  My boy just won over a grand in craps, I won over $350 in poker, we're all feeling good.    He's feeling a little better than everyone else tho, so he decides to take us out for dinner.

Last minute we got a reservation for Voodoo, heard about it from a local so we thought we'd give it a whirl.

We were staying at the Palms so the Rio wasn't that far, but we walked over and wormed our way through the establishment to the door man who confirmed our reservation and let us through to the elevator waiting room, elevators which have glass fronts that let you see all of Vegas as you ride up 50 floors, which is a kind a cool bonus, especially for a Vegas first timer like myself.

Once getting there, we had to wait a few minutes to get seated, so we hit up the bar, and there we saw a drink being made that blew our minds.  (warning: we might be simple minded boozin gamblin fools).  It was a large margarita type drink in a fish bowl type glass that had dry ice added, so a mist poured out of it, and that was more than enough to convince us all we should get one to split.

After getting halfway through our first round of drinks we get seated, and at first they put us in a booth, but the whole restaurant, being on top of the Rio tower, had glass all the way around it and you could sit right by it with a ridiculous view, so I requested a table by the window and the staff was quick to oblige.  

Once seated, we were greeted by our server, and i wish i could remember his name because he was on point.   He was what every server should be, he knew the whole menu, he was quick on anything and everything, and an overall nice guy to boot.   

We got one of those dry ice drinks, which I can't remember the name of, sorry, and it was awesome.   For dinner I went with the Filet Mignon and my friend with the porterhouse, while are two other associates that accompanied us also got steaks of different varieties.   We also got the mac n cheese and yukon gold potato puree sides, which were more than enough for the four of us.

""How was the food Cliff?"" you're probably asking right now, and I'll tell you this, it was so good that with the view and the day's winnings, we all felt like royalty.   It was a surreal moment where you bit into a nice juicy succulent piece of steak and realized, ""Rome might be crumbling around us in this day and age, but g********n this is a good steak"".

I even said out loud after I finished the last bite of my filet ""that steak was so good i might just have to rip a phone book in half"".

After we finished we got our check which my boy took care of and we headed out to the outdoor patio that looked over Vegas and had a dj playing.    Our server, being the nice chap he was, followed us out there and asked if we needed change, which we didn't and then wished us a good time for the rest of our stay in Vegas.

Overall, I'd say this experience was glorious and I would recommend going to the Voodoo to anyone and everyone.

I think my friend read one too many books on the mystery method dating strategy - and perhaps drinks too much... but I don't have the heart to tell him.

This is a great spot for an older crowd... older by Vegas standards. 30 years old is what I am talking. So many of the most trendy clubs are so heavy on the just-turned-21 crowd that a guy my age just doesn't feel at home at such places.

The outdoor space is breathtaking. You are just far enough from the strip that you can see it perfectly. Indoors have a more intimate feel and windows surround the whole club as the whole kidney bean shaped floor is designated to Voodoo Lounge.

My friend did encounter one noteworthy mother hen: a young 21 year old girls mother. Again, this is a place where 20 to 40 year olds just blend in with the walls.",wuT2zH7Atq-98BirpB-8Aw,5,0,4,1dL5OFW0Tcoks3-lAdtuaA

4346807,2012-01-02,7,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"This was the worst dining experience I've had in a while. I ordered my steak very well no pink - you can't see anything because it is so dark. Luckily I filled up on my soup (a whopping $8 for a cup of soup) and some bread and potatoes. Back in the room I looked at my steak and it was rear.. I thought it tasted a little off.. 

The doorman downstairs was super rude. Tried to make us wait in line to go to the club, we explained we had a dinner reservation, then he snapped we had to wait and pay, I was like no - for a dinner reservation. Finally he let us go. The noise from the club is so loud you can't hear yourself think. You can't even read the menus our waiter had a flashlight for us to see. On the way up you have to cram in this little elevator with all the people who want to go to the club, so most of them are already drunk and annoying. 

The food is overpriced and flavorless. My $60 steak wasn't even made right. I emailed the hotel (which we were staying in) and the manager said I should have brought it to their attention at the time. I explained it was dark we couldn't see, we weren't happy with the whole experience and just wanted to get out of there. He said he'd remake me a steak if I came to the restaurant to pick it up. I asked if he could send it to our room - a big fat no. Then I asked if we could get a gift card because we were leaving the next day. Again no. I'll upload a picture of my wonderfully undercooked steak. He did offer next time we're in Vegas I can come get my steak. Seriously? Like he's even going to work there or remember.

This was not only the worst dining experience, but it was our anniversary as well. What a way for us to waste $200+ on food I didn't even eat. I suggest going to another steak joint - it's Vegas there are hundreds!",cG0vpu706k9eR885-Jcqiw,6,1,1,kFOj83jbJIop9gM6Q4xkYQ

For our first night, we didn't feel like venturing too far and since we were staying at the Rio, VooDoo seemed the perfect choice.  Granted, we came here on a Tuesday and probably early for Vegas standards (10ish), so there wasn't a line to get in and we were charged $10 each.  We ordered drinks from the first bar we saw inside, and two witchdoctors for four people was plenty to get us started after our drinks with dinner.   The witchdoctor drinks were good, just really sweet and pretty much just a hodgepodge of different flavors of rum with a lime in it.  After those, we just stuck to our ""plain"" drinks of vodka sodas, rum and coke, etc.  

Outside, the DJ was already playing and since no one was having bottle service yet, we were able to sit at the bottle service tables giving us an even better view for a couple of hours.  The music was great; it was a mix of old and new, rock, pop and rap so there was something for everyone. 

The view was just amazing!  We were here when the skies were clear and there was a full moon making the view that much better.

If you did not like a song, the clever mixes ensured just wait about 1 minute and it will switch into something else.  I swear they played MY personal playlist.  All my favorite songs.  The cool DJ also took a request from me.  He later let me know with a smile that it was coming up soon.  On another night, a different DJ quickly made my requested happy birthday announcement. Fantastic job!
Bring a sweater (Unless it is summer).  It can get a bit cool. You cannot HELP but have fun and dance, even if you are not a dancer.  Order some drinks and you will be!
Our first round of 2 drinks was a jaw dropping $30!  But my whiskey and ginger ale tasted like 80%whiskey 20% ginger ale.  Which = QUICK AND STRONG BUZZ.  And I am no lightweight!  Subsequent beers were $10!  Arrive before 10PM for no cover. After, if you are a Rio guest, ask at the main desk for discounted passes.  It is very pricey just to enter!  
No pretentiousness other than the down to business line to get in.  Just play their lil game, get past that, and await the elevator doors opening up to that beautiful, sparkly view on the roof!",nxUKTm5XpynIINQQLgcH9A,2,2,5,bU58tX9WqI-Z9YYWq7YQfQ

We visited on a Saturday night. Walking through the Casino we were handed two discount coupons for the club. We arrived about 9:30 and weren't charged the cover which was nice. We went upstairs and as I expected that early it was relatively empty. It was filled up more by the time we left around 11:30. 

There is NO seating. Every booth inside and outside was reserved for bottle service. There was a couple of benches and stools by the stairway from the steakhouse and one booth right at the front that were not reserved. Outside on the deck, which is supposed the dance floor, they've put more booths for bottle service that take up half the deck. So when everyone crowds out there to see the view there is essentially no where to dance. When we left at 11:30 not one of the bottle service tables had anyone sitting at it. 

Go check out the view but don't plan on much else. Expect to stand. The crowd is definitely mixed age. I saw mid 20's up to early 50's. Also, the dress code is a joke. Don't bother.

The hostess said we could not be seated in our window table before our reservation time, but could be seated in a booth if we wanted, or go to the bar.  There was no waiting room or other place to sit.  As we walked to the bar we saw individuals eating at several window tables, and then a large group of window tables open.  We decided not to sit at the bar and returned to the hostess to ask why we couldn't be seated at our table.  She said they did not have waitstaff yet.  We asked if we could just sit at our table until our reservation, and she said no.
We stood around and then were seated.  I found it a bit unusual, that even though this was Valentines Day, there were no flowers or any candle on the table.  The wandering violinist was very good by the sound was way too loud- we, and the table next to us, asked to have it turned down so that at least we could hear one another.  Our server did take care of the.
At any rate we decided to go with their price fixed Valentines Day menu, and ordered a bottle of wine to go with it.  Our server, Jamal, was very good.
The shrimp appetizer was well done and came quickly.  This was followed by a grilled romaine salad, that was served on one plate- two large romaine leaves topped with a single slice of toasted bread.  There were no serving utensils nor did they offer to put it on our individual plates.  The romaine leaves were considerably longer than the salad plates and the single slice of toasted bread was very difficult to cut in two.  The romaine leaves were tasty, however.
The main course, a 40 oz porterhouse, was beautifully presented and excellent in taste as well as tender.  The rissotto with truffles had so much garlic that you could not taste the truffles.
The tray of deserts was very nice, especially the white chocolate shell hearths.

While they looked nothing like me or my friends they had been carefully doused in our favorite liquor, had hairs on top surreptitiously plucked from our heads and were clothed in socks, missing from our last visit to Vegas. The witch doctor cackled with maniacal laughter knowing he would royally kill our buzzes in Vegas.

The torture began by throwing all his victims' dolls together, bundled tightly with twine for over an hour and a half. He planned his night of nefariousness while dining on gruel of enemies' bones. At the same time my friends and I were in painful limbo, outside Body English, packed like sardines, begging to be let in. Little did we know we were part of a sadist's sick game. http://www.yelp.com/biz/GCRvrxMSC1nzShyM4Y-guQ?hrid=mYQzT_gkw5feEE4GSNMszg

The witch doctor snorted to announce the end of our wait. He raised us and other dolls high above his head - reciting the most evil of incantations - at the same time we rose in Voodoo's elevator with only dudes. Were there any women at this bar? A perverse thought entered the Witch Doctors mind, 

""Rather than burning or stabbing these infidels with pins, I will bludgeon them to death! But with what, what do I have in my kitchen? Hmmm... Yes, yes that's it. How twisted... Sausages! I will bludgeon them with sausages!"" Who knew a package of Johnsonville Bratwursts could be part of a black magic ritual?

We entered Voodoo and felt compelled to move to the rooftop deck. We found ourselves helplessly surrounded by March madness, NCAA fanboys in baseball caps, and white trainers. I was in Vegas hell. The witch doctor spanked the dolls mercilessly with the bratwurst from his fridge. We were knocked back and forth as dudes and their dude's friends pushed to get a better vantage point of a fat girl dancing with a skinny guy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9kBOvbyoJI

Eventually the witch doctor grew tired from a busy night tormenting and cast the dolls aside. His pet dog smelled the snausage scented dolls and picked the blond-haired one up. He shook it vigorously before setting it down beside its bowl. Compelled by an unseen force I gyrated my hips uncontrollably in the Casino.

The food here is quite excellent, and everything tasted great.  Be prepared to pay about $40 a place, with all sides costing extra. The only thing I can complain about on the food was that I got the lamb chop, and it was extremely fatty.  It seems that a third of what I had was pure fat, and at least to me at $45 for a lamb chop, it should be a little on the leaner side.  But still, it was quite delicious.

The only other complaint I have is that they changed the decor inside the restaurant.  With a name like VooDoo you would expect there to be a voodoo theme inside, which there did use to be.  But now they have taken all of that away and gone with a neutral color scheme throughout the entire restaurant, and it just seems to take away the ambiance that made this place unique, now its boring and unoffending like any other number of other restaurants in Las Vegas.

First off, I have to emphasize that this is a LOUNGE. we came on a thursday nite at almost midnight but since we stayed at the RIO, i figured we'd be ok to get in. NO, they wanted to charge girls $10 and guys $20! 

When we decided to walk out, the bouncer convinced us to stay and that ""there's no other club like this."" (uh... what about moon at the palms?!) He was willing to comp our 3 ladies, but our 2 guys had to pay. The elevator ride up was pretty... had the view of the strip. Once inside, the party was NOT hopping. Instead, the party was outside on the balcony. We went outside, took pics of the view, and noticed people with the Witch Dr.  We went to the inside bar, and the bartender put on a mini show when making it. It's in a huge glass, fruity but still good and made with dry ice. I think it was about $30.

Once we were done with the drink, we went outside to dance. the DJ was not very good. He was playing some hip hop earlier, but now it was house but mixed with other stuff. it just didn't sound good. We went inside to see if the DJ was any better.. not really. but we made the most of it because the dance floor was empty so my friends and I used the whole space. BTW, the crowd was eh.

4792205,2013-05-04,2,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"My girlfriend and I planned our trip to Vegas down to the minute.  We left nothing to chance and did extensive research.  It was her first trip to Vegas (I had been before) and besides, she's a planner.  So when looking into nightclubs, we wanted to find 2, one for Friday and one for Saturday, that we HAD to see, and then one or two more to go to after if it turned out the first wasn't all it was cracked up to be or if we just wanted to check out something else.

Friday night was XS and we were disappointed.  We left after 90 minutes or so and headed to The Act, which we loved.  Our second night was going to be an ""off-strip"" night.  Firstly, we wanted to check our as many rooftop lounges and clubs for comparison, and between Rio and Palms, there's like 3 or 4.  And in our research, Voodoo looked like the best, so our first club Sat was Voodoo, and our backup was Ghostbar in Palms.  We never left Voodoo.

Firstly, you have to start with the view.  Voodoo has 2 outdoor levels, and both have fantastic views.  We were there in mid April, so the weather was perfect.  The inside of the club was nice - maybe not the fanciest or coolest place, but it was upscale.  Dance floor was a bit small.  Regardless, there was no one inside - why would you be for a place like this.  When you could dance to great music and those views, it makes for a great night.

Second, music.  This is the type of music I want to hear.  Top 40, hip hop, dance.  Not house.  Mix some house in if you must to show off your DJ skills, but stick to what people like to listen to.  Admittedly, this was an older crowd and I think we (I'm 35) prefer top 40 over house music.  But you can dance to it, sing to it, and just have fun.  The only strange thing with the music was that the DJ for the lower outdoor level was playing the same songs as the upper level DJ, just maybe an hour or so behind.  I'm not sure if that was intentionally, but my girlfriend and I were on the upper level for a couple of hours, but then had an issue with another patron, so we decided to walk down the outdoor stairs to the lower level (it's only one floor down - still practically rooftop).  We got down there, and heard maybe half a dozen or so songs that we had heard upstairs earlier in the evening.  So that was strange.

Our only problem was old people who can't handle their liquor.  There was some woman there, having fun, and dancing like there was no one around her.  Head and arms flailing all over the place.  Voodoo didn't get nearly as crowded as the other clubs - there was a crowd, but there was room to dance and move around - but regardless, club goers, you have to be aware of your surroundings.  Show a little restraint in your spasms.  This drunk 40 some year old was throwing her arms around and knocked my girlfriends drink, hard, right out of her hands.  The drink hit the ground and splashed on at least 2-3 other people.  So while we're apologizing profusely to everyone else, this woman went on like nothing happened.  Thankfully, everyone around us understood and we didn't have a problem, but this idiot didn't even acknowledge what she did, much less replace my girlfriends drink.  So it put a damper on the night, but we still had fun.

Therefore, if you're okay with a 30-40 year old crowd that forgot how to party, then you should absolutely go to Voodoo.  Besides XS and Act, my only other club experiences in Vegas were Rain at Palms, which is now closed, and Studio 54 at MGM, also closed, so I don't have many places to compare it to, but I think this has got to be one of the best.",0-hb63A9uWjR1YIyVMu6rg,6,1,5,0MJDx5DF4kYFwn4VBNQMRQ

They have the Voodoo Cafe on the 50th floor where they serve Cajon/Creole food. Lets just say the menu is not the most innovative. But right above that on the 51 floor is the Voodoo Lounge. When you get out of the glass elvelator ride like you were on a Willy Wonka Express with a great view of the city...you walk into a black light lit  reception with chalk drawings of Voodoo symbols and music. 
Voodoo has a unique patio area that overlooks the city. Like Moon, it has two levels of patio. The bartenders are also Flair bartenders. The drinks are average 8 dollars. It is popular for the infamous drink called the ""witch doctor."" It's kinda a really cool atmosphere. One setback is you can smell the food from downstairs. Sometimes it's just not the best smells of seafood when you're trying to drink :) The house band is pretty cool. Especially if you're Jamming out to ""Could this be Love"" and it's a white dude singing it. Their go go dancers....Mostly hot....so not bad. Overall it's a good club. You can talk to people without having to overly strain your voice. It's a good crowd because it's a mix of locals and tourists.  Cover....I'm not sure.

Overall we had a great experience here, we have a table of 13 and most everyone ordered the VooDoo ""Menage et Trois"" - 6 oz Premium Petite Filet, Half Cold Water Lobster Tail and grilled Mexican White Prawns - They all seemed to love it!

 I personally ordered the Classic Lobster Thermidor Maine Lobster with Lump Crab Meat with a Lobster Tarragon Sauce - which was absolutely mouthwatering deliciousness! I was full halfway through and couldn't help myself in finishing it because it was so rich and yummy! Huge pieces of lobster and fresh crab meat!

A couple of others had the 14 oz Berkshire Pork Porterhouse with Forest mushrooms, Creamed Grits and Pork Jus - This thing was massive and well worth it!

We also had the Poached Asparagus and Lemon Aioli - nom nom! and the Crispy Coconut & Sugar Cane Shrimp - even better!!! 

The wait time was a bit of time to get our food, but well worth it. We went upstairs and got a VIP table which hosted a beautiful view of the strip. I think this is one of the most beautiful views along side the Mandalay View.",oqyfqKq0XYw4lNzZHcszSg,0,0,4,XqgUzTSoO8ciQ8crS_qfuQ

Like nice atmosphere, excellent food and great service.  Well the atmosphere is the only one that fits into that category.   It was warm, romantic, and the view was awesome.  Things go down hill after that.  Our waiter took forever to even come over to us, hands us menus walks away.  Finally after quite awhile comes over to take our drink order.  We did not have a wine list.  Instead of offering us one, he just says well what do you like?  STill would have been nice to see a list.  Next our salads are brought out.  Caesars and they are pretty good.  Next our steaks come out.  Mine is rare (I wanted medium).  So I show it to him and he is like Oh, let me take that back, he knew right away it was wrong.  So my spouse is eating while Im sitting there.  The steak comes back and half of it is still too pink...send it back again! 
We had mashed potatos that needed more seasoning so we added salt/pepper.  
Dessert we ordered creme brulee.  I have made better my self.  There was hardly any carmelized sugar on top, and the custard was very bland.   I have to say our waiter was totally consumed with a larger group of 12.  My spouse and I felt neglected on a service stand point and a food stand point. The waiter brought me a on the house glass of wine to try to rectify the problem with the steak, but It wasn't enough to fix the dinning experience. I  was really disappointed in the whole experience, especially when you are paying that much $$.  I will never go back here again, there's too many other good options in Vegas to pay alot of money for crappy service and not great food.",un5zzeKaNYz78aGfOZ3Pqg,1,0,2,1KifgQAUXwGJz-np6ixBaA

Located 51 stories up from the infamous Rio Las Vegas Hotel, there is an indoor and outdoor [rooftop] nightclub area to drink and dance the night away. 

Since it was warm out, my girls and I decided to hang outdoors to enjoy the cool breeze and take in the lights & breathtaking views. 
As you enter the rooftop, you are greeted with a full bar and a dj located on the opposite end. There are VIP bottle service amenities available and comes equipped with cozy booth seating. 

Drinks are overpriced but what do you honestly expect when you're in Vegas & having some fun at the club. The dance floor is wherever you are currently standing and although I didn't pay too much attention to the music, I do recall them playing a little bit of everything from edm to 90s hip hop.

Overall: 2 Stars because this place is NOT poppin but the views are stunning [+1 star].

Riding up the elevator made my stomach a little queasy but once I stepped off and heard the DJ it was all GOOD. So I love the fact that if you are a hotel guest you get in here for FREE. At least I don't remember paying to get in. My friends and myself went in March and it was sooo windy that we just went outside on the patio to take model pictures. You know, where your hair is blowing and you look all sexy and stuff. Sadly our pics didn't look so glamorous, I guess because we didn't have a wind machine which we could control. We had 60mph winds because we were stuck in some sort of wind vortex. I could imagine that if you weighed less than 100 pounds you could possibly have flown off the roof!!!! Good thing that I am not under 100 pounds. I bet the patio is a great place to dance in the summertime with the great views and plenty of space to dance.
So the lounge itself is a bit small for my taste because I like a lot of room to dance being that I am a PROFESSIONAL DANCER(hip-hop only). 
Don't be alarmed if someone grabs you in this place, it happens all the time. It's code for Welcome to the VOODOO LOUNGE, you have a nice.......

The next time I went was with a bachelorette party of about 11 girls.  We asked all around for passes and no such luck.  We were lucky enough to run into one of those big guys in suits giving away passes for ladies.  We headed up there early and it was dead dead dead.  Of course, the view was fabulous and the weather was good, so we stuck around.  There was plenty of room on the dance floor outside and it was entertaining watching the ladies on the stripper pole.  (And boy, is that one nasty stripper pole!)  And guys, don't bother even trying to get on that pole. Security will have you off of it in a second! 

More people eventually did show up, but it was hardly what I would say as a happening place.  You usually get a bunch of dudes watching from up top staring down at the ladies and down their dresses.  And you even get the ghetto crowd of people throwing stuff down at the lower level people.  Sure, you aren't complaining about it being a sardine can in here, but a few more people would be nice.  

Drinks are expensive of course and the floor is sticky as hell in front of the bar.    

Overall, the view is what you come for.  It's not as uptight as the clubs on the strip and the line is hardly long.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,4,3,chT9_1eY35fj4mCwGoYjWw

First strike:  You're hit up for $20 a head to get in if you're female, $30 if you're male - so remove $50 from your wallet per couple at the outset just to get in.  I'm not normally one to p*ss and moan about cover charges, but I'm a big fan of the concept of ""reasonable.""  If you've got a kickin' live band and open dance floors, then yeah, I'd consider $50 steep but ""what the hell, it's Vegas and we're here to have fun,"" and just go for it.  

As it was, we forked the money over anyhow, but when we got to the top discovered to our disgust that each of the outside dance decks had roughly 60% of the floor - almost the entire periphery, which means the view - roped off for some ""reserved"" parties.  There was a circle roughly 20 feet in diameter left in the middle for us Plebes to cram into, whilst a clutch of sleazy, overweight types in poorly-fitting suits and overstuffed dresses enjoyed their mostly-deserted couches and copious floorspace along the railings.  The scene was bookended by a couple of motionless, stone-faced mafia-thug types who stood there staring at everybody else as if there were something important in need of guarding.  

I paid money for... this? 
Second strike.

Third strike:  Now I do realize that the gangsta rap phenomenon of the Decade of Ugly has inexplicably been propped up and kept around well into the 21st Century like some moldy, reanimated corpse, but...  

I'm wondering if I'm the only one to question whether some amplified loser shouting ""I'm gonna slip that hoe the snake"" and other choice gems is something that a.) has some kind of aesthetic value to a crowd of people who have presumably emerged from the Beavis & Butthead phase of pre-adolescence and b.) is the kind of thing likely to get anyone in the mood for some serious romance.  'Cause I'm just not clear on that.  A tangential issue, I know, but while I'm a big fan of Voltaire's famous statement on the right to free expression, a couple hours of that is enough to convince anyone that we have indeed become a nation of tasteless pigs.   

Damn, what I wouldn't give to hear a solid live band slammin' home some soul-satisfying blues - (the name ""Walter Trout"" springs immediately to mind, by way of example...) People who can actually play musical instruments - what a concept, huh?   Now *that* would justify the price. 

But dance floors constricted to postage-stamp size miles from the Voodoo Lounge's rumored city views, gutter-sludge audio, and (oyeah!) - airport-priced drinks... 

We paid through the nose to get into... *this*?

I heard Dreas is better. Next time I'll go there. Also they have the edges of the whole dance floor filled with empty tables for supposedly VIP. So you really can't get a rail to lean on and look over to the beautiful view down below. It is really more like a waste of space bc nobody sits there and if you leave your bag on one of the couches they make a big deal about it. It kills the rooftop experience of the club.

Sorry, but most of whats played is just for drunk bitches to shake their asses to and they don't really care what it is. At the very least I would think they would have a decent sound system but the playback is terrible and the mixing wasnt good- some of it wasnt even beat matched and sound all kinds of warbled for a few seconds til the songs switch. We're forgiving as majority is top 40 like Akon is not our thing, but it's saving grace for us is the quality and it's not that good. To some people it might not matter, or people too drunk to care, but shouldn't music played right sounding right matter?! Is that not a big part of the reason to go to a club?! I was expecting a decent standard from big casinos if places in LA independently owned have amazing sound systems and good DJ's that understand beat matching and mixing in smoothly. I forgive mistakes as it's live, but ALL the mix ins were so noticeable and I doubt anyone can eff up their entire set unless they believe their doing it right. BF can do better and we just are playing at home for fun. *rant* *rant* 

Mixed bag kind of crowd and I prefer when it's more older/mature/high roller crowd so we went closer to those groups.  I just dont like all the screaming loud ditz college sorority sister drunks running into me and screaming in my ear for no fucking reason. They were rampant that night unfortunately for a birthday.

Embarrassing a bit for me because they're most likely my age- recently legals and feel like if I stand by them I look like I'm with them. Oh hell no. 

I like the Witch Doctor- that was strong but yummy and not boozy tasting for something so potent. View is nice. I came with family visiting set on coming  because they want the view or else I would have persuaded them elsewhere. 

Free cover with a card made it worth it but I wouldnt ever pay for this (except if I HAVE to go- I would pay to get some privacy in a VIP section outside). I'm a LA snob who loves ambiance with classy people and this is not it. Not that I have an air of importance, but I just find I'm less annoyed when it's a more beautiful atmosphere where I can actually mingle and relate.

- Stingy on my seafood plate.  At $26, I got an oyster shooter, one on a half shell, a baby lobster tail, and 2 shrimps.  I was still hungry and looking pathetic, leaving my friends to give me bites of their dishes.  
- My friend's pork chop was drier than, oh, I don't know, a Vivid girl?  It needed some kind of moisture.  (If you've read this far into this review, I will give you a $1)
- Another friend of mine had the sea bass, which was accompanied by chili.  We both agreed that it was an odd combo
- The filet mignon was tender, but my friend said it was cold about halfway through the big chunk o' meat.
- Splitting a plate will set you back an additional $10.  How about you split it yourself and throw that $10 on black at the roulette table?

The goods at the restaurant - They served yummy bread.  Olive loaf, cranberry walnut, and raisin almond.  I suggest loading up on the bread and just waste your money on libations.

5159658,2007-05-08,1,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"I came to VooDoo Lounge for my cousin's wedding reception, with a party of about 30 people. Being that it was my first trip ever to Vegas, the view from the 50th floor roof deck of the Rio was astounding, with great photo ops at night with The Strip all lit up.

Aside from the view, my experience here SUCKED. Really. One of the two stars I've rated it is just for the view, because the food was nothing to write home about, and in fact, they seriously fucked up a lot of the event.

First off, our reservations were at 6pm, but we weren't seated till 6:30 because they weren't ready for us. It was not a big deal, as we were able to enjoy our cocktails outside on the deck. When we finally were seated, the bride almost had an aneurism because they had spelled her last name wrong on the menu. That is serious bad form, not even getting the bride's name right on a keepsake item. The dinner was a four course meal with several items to choose from for each course. Well, somehow, the wild mushroom ravioli appetizer got replaced with buffalo wings, and they also had a spinach artichoke dip available but they didn't tell us about it. I only found out when I said I wasn't going to order a first course because I don't eat meat, and the waiter mentioned offhand that they had the dip as an option as well. 

It took probably about 45 minutes for the first course to arrive. Unbelievable. The salad course came not too long after the appetizers, but by this point we were all getting restless. We had four children under the age of four in our party, and the kitchen managed to bring food out for them right away to keep them calm. The portions for the kids were out of control - they received giant dishes of chicken fingers, french fries, and a HUGE bowl of pasta primavera (kids eat vegetables??) that not even a large adult would be able to finish. Oh, and a note on the salad - the menu stated that the ""mojo caesar salad"" came with molten gruyere croutons...but not a crouton was to be found on any caesar salad plate.

By the time the entree course arrived, no one was really even hungry anymore. My cousin the groom had ordered the Ahi tuna entree...and found it so tough that he sent it back and ordered a steak instead. Everyone was underwhelmed by their entrees. By this point, the wait staff seemed to have forgotten we existed and we were all in serious need of water refills. 

Desserts came, which were fine, but nothing to write home about. Not to mention that the groom's entree arrived just before the dessert, so he was eating his steak while we ate our sweets. We were all pretty pissed at this point. 

I REALLY, REALLY hope they gave my cousin and his wife a big discount on that meal, because it was horribly botched. Nothing about it was right. It was supposed to be a two-hour affair, but it ended up going at least twice as long. When we left, we saw a long ass line of people waiting to get in. Why??? The view, I suppose. I highly do not recommend going to this place with a big group for a big event. I suppose it COULD be ok for a dinner with your significant other, just don't order the tuna. I wouldn't bother waiting in line to get into this place, either. I hear there are other places in Vegas with great views and better service.",kV7kmmBw_8IPLyI5M6wgTw,5,1,2,Qmns8PgrLcZ1hqzLMCJEww

Line wasn't too long on a Sunday at 10pm.  I almost always avoid places with cover charges, but I wasn't charged as a guest of Rio. If they were smart, they'd let you up for free... and then charge $10 for the 51 floor elevator ride down.

CLUB
The inside of the club has a purple glow that feels very 90s, very Night at the Roxbury (EMILIO!!!), but the obvious appeal is the rooftop patio with the view of Las Vegas, fifty-one floors up.  Being on a roof in Vegas is the only reason to be at Voodoo, right?  From there you can see where ask the hip clubs are.

CLIENTELE
Nobody was too formal.  Only a few girls got hoed up.  I guess you could say it is Casual Ho.  Surprisingly low douchebag count. And nobody wearing blazers (except maybe one of two foreigners who may have mistaken this for the hotspot it may have been in the 90s).  I was a bit shocked to see a pair of schlubs in their mid-50s in beige T-shirts and shorts allowed in, but I don't want to be a snob. (I was in Levis and Darth Vader vans, so.) 

DRINKS
I don't need dry ice in my drinks.  I'm an adult.  (Don't look at my shoes).  A Tito's and Cranberry will do fine.  I don't really need the bartender to flip the alcohol over his shoulder, under his arm, across his armpit, bunnyhop over the elbow, over the river and through the woods, heads shoulders knees and toes knees and toes.  But whatever.  At least Corrie had a heavier pour than the others.  I couldn't help but think of the amount of liquor spilled during that performance.  At least they should dedicate it to our homies.  

PRICE
Two drinks run $28.12.  The twelve cents was annoying.  Nobody wants a pocketful or purse full of change.  Just make it $28 even. Pennies don't belong in a nightclub. They are the coin equivalent of 55 yr olds in beige shirts and cargo shorts.  No change!!  If they were smart, they'd have a big Plinko board that empties into a tip jar.  

DANCE FLOOR/DJ
 Though the dance floor is naturally assumed to be in the middle of the deck, in between the bland, dark bar and the lit up DJ area, surrounded by booths roped off to the general public, the lack of designated dance floor is actually a good thing because you can stand on the ""dance floor"" or dance off the dance floor (in other words, stand where they dance or dance where they stand) and not feel out of place.  The DJ, playing a healthy dose of 90s hip hop classics, was mixing songs so quickly that you couldn't tire of any song, which is a great thing.  He was an ADHDJ.",RhpaXVpwiMoVs4gQMehauQ,28,13,4,IKH5AMPGUqWAO_gxPyrf0g

(That could also be the multiple free drinks we all had) but in either case, I would definitely recommend this place to others. It's much more mellow than the other clubs and you can actually move around without being elbowed and jostled and groped everywhere you turn. You definitely have to check out the outside lounge because it's phenomenal. The music out there is different than the music they play inside but it's still really good. And the view is wonderful. As the night progresses, they bring a live band into the indoor lounge and the band plays cover songs all night long. The drinks are good and they're made strong and there's a lot of fun flare bartending you can watch while they make your drinks.

I went to VooDoo Lounge late one Saturday night on a Long Weekend. To my surprise, it was not as crowded as I expected, and the crowd was a lot  older than expected. This to me however, is never a problem. We made the best of the night by having drinks, dancing, and enjoying the view (the view is AMAZING). 

At some point of the night I realized I'd had one too many martinis and retreated back to our room (thankfully we were staying at the Rio). Thinking back on the night the following morning I realized that this place wasn't excellent (I've now been to better, w/also great views) but it was definitely not bad.

The view is breathtaking though I admit.  The line was a bit long due to the waiting of the elevator to the 51st Floor.

The weekend I was there, it was pretty windy so imagine being on the rooftop I almost blew over a few times.  I mean just made it COLD even for the end of August.

A girlfriend of mine was promoting so she had given us free passes. She just kept reminding me about ""the view"" and said little about the rest.  The music was okay.  There was decent mainstream house music being played then it switched over to some old school hip hop.

Our bartender didn't know how to make a 3wisemen which worried me a bit, but in the end he ended up making it a double shot. I guess we scored on that part.

Go for the view and chill, but I wouldn't recommend this place as a clubbing experience.   

As I left the club they were charging guys 40 and girls 20. I was in shock.  I had an extra pass and gave it to the girl who was about to hand over a 20.  She looked at me blankly so I'm hope her somewhat more sober companion realized to hand that pass to the cashier.",GQwiY_PvTUtdtnt8cCjmfQ,2,1,2,-P08MIzEl0toGjJ_U2tUFA

We purchased the Bachelorette package through a third party vender and the vender paid the bar $250 USD.  For this we received a bottle of New Amsterdam vodka (retail value $13-17), some juices, and a private area. We were then told that we could leave our things in our area and that we could go dance and enjoy ourselves. We came back to our area and there were a bunch of random people sitting there and our bottle was completely empty; they had finished our entire bottle. When we asked them to rectify the situation, he was unwilling to satisfy our request of getting a slightly nicer bottle of alcohol (we specifically asked for Titos). For this club in particular, there is no reason that we should pay $250 for a rail bottle of liquor in the first place. This club might be ok for a bunch of 21 year olds but definitely not for a group of women that like to enjoy their liquor and not for people that expect great customer service. The manager actually said to me ""Lady, if your just going to give me a bad review, then why should I give you a free bottle of liquor"".

After 8PM this place charges $20 cover, but no fear just look for people handing out passes downstairs in the casino/bar areas. 

The views are so gorgeous up there and there's a lot of glass so you can really see the whole strip. 

We of course HAD to order the Witches Brew, while it was good and over  the top Vegas style with dry ice smoke pouring out of it, it was reallllly sweet and didn't seem to have any alcohol. For $30 we wanted to get at least a little happy! So we just stuck to beer for the rest of the nite. 

Their roof top area is awesome with a DJ mixing top 40, hip hop, and I even heard a few deep house beats. Their dress code is relaxed here and we saw a mix of people in casual jeans/shirts to some nice/fun dresses. There was a large group of boys out for a bachelor party dressed in their matching zoot suit and hats. 

I highly recommend this spot if you're looking for an easy/fun spot for drinks but don't want to deal with annoying lines or obnoxious bouncers. Only bummer is that their seating area is pretty limited (unless you reserve a table) and they have zero satellite tables so you have to hang on to your drink the whole time.

5515907,2012-07-30,2,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"Let me tell you first of all... I HATE NIGHTCLUBS! Absolutely hate them. Pretentious people, high cover charges, blaring techno music, expensive watered down drinks... I'm usually looking at my watch non-stop to see when I can finally escape the madness. Voodoo falls within that category.

Well the bachelor in our party wanted to go to at least one of these establishments during our visit to Vegas last weekend. I'm sure glad he chose Voodoo over Pure or someplace else.

The Vegas skyline view cannot be beaten there AT ALL (that alone is worth the cover charge itself).

They don't play obnoxious constant beat techno here on their speakers, but actually good dance music. For a ""nightclub"" drink prices surprisingly are not astronomical. The fellow clientele are not annoying douches and Voodoo's staff members (bartenders, bouncers) are ridiculously a cool clan of people. They even let our bachelor dance upon an empty go-go dancer podium for a simple photo op, as the security staff ""turned their backs"" when we asked permission first... extremely cool!!

Yes this place qualifies as a nightclub... but Voodoo's management, staff, design and execution make it impossible for anyone not to love the place.

Voodoo, you have a fan in me. Thanks for the fun!

PS... as a good tip, tour around the casino floor for a while until you run into a voodoo promoter handing out half off cover charge cards even on weekend nights (score!)",bMu0YmyjO7jtFXsDIIH35Q,14,5,5,1maBB2S1zGbfQcy34E7A3A

5550989,2011-08-10,1,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"Ok, this is just for the steakhouse, not the lounge.  I didn't visit the lounge.

I was really hoping for a great experience with VooDoo, but it was quite disappointing.  I'll dispense with the obvious rhymes I could make about the quality of the place: suffice it to say, I do not recommend it.

No doubt, the view is great (not as good as the view from the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, but still great).  But the problems with the food and the service (and to some extent, the setting) just can't be made up for by the view.

I was a little surprised at the level of ""casual"" dress in the place.  I was wearing slacks and a sport coat.  There were dudes in there in tank tops and jorts.  I don't want to sound like a snob here, but I thought this was supposed to be a nice place.  Oh well...to each his own.  I'm no Mr. Blackwell.

The service was very slow.  I was having wine by the glass because my dining partner wasn't drinking.  Well, I only manged to get one (it was a very good Stag's Leap, by the way); I probably would have had 3 if I ever could have gotten our server's attention.  It took forever to get the food, and once we got it, they just dropped it and hauled ass.  I want to point out that the place wasn't crowded at all.  All the servers were just hanging around talking with one another. 

I got a bone in filet.  I have no complaint with the quality of the beef.  But they overcooked it.  Bad.  Real bad. Overcooking is something that will kill a filet.  I ended up with a bone-in hockey puck.   I love truffle mac n cheese, so when I saw it on the menu, I was happy to order it.  I've had it at some places that prepare it really well...VooDoo doesn't: the macaroni was this short little stuff like our of a kid's school lunch, and it had very little flavor. The creamed spinach was so salty, I could hardly eat it (and I like a lot of salt). 

I didn't want to bother with dessert for two main reasons.    First,  I had no idea how long it would take to get it, given how slow the service was.  Second, just about the time I finished my entree, they cranked up the music in the lounge, which is on the next floor up and connected by a staircase.  Ok, ok, so I'm old, but it was so freakin' loud the water in my glass was rippling with every thump of the bad-assed bass accompanying the techno-noise music from upstairs.  Not a nice atmosphere if you'd like a quiet, relaxing dinner.  I decided to haul ass rather than bust a move, get jiggy wit' it, or whatever the correct phrase would be.

I don't know:  It may be that I'm too old to enjoy a place like VooDoo Steakhouse.  Maybe they should have ""reverse carded"" me or something. I suppose I should start practicing: ""You darned kids get offa my lawn!!!""",72lroC1VvyQ3s0nRLuY7Fw,1,0,2,HiNX1fDJ9_2vSQ302rj-Yw

The music was meh. I immediately spied that DJ from Lolitas back in November spinning in the main room. UGH! It's the guy with the mohawk that plays 10 minute sets of Katy Perry. Gag me. 

Even though we were 2 of maybe 20 (very generous estimate) a cocktail waitress/photographer came by to take our picture about 3 times. It was a bit embarrassing because the place was a ghost town. 

The music on the balcony was better, but there was literally 6 people outside, including a 40 something couple eating each other's faces.  Some guy in his sixties kept offering to take my picture and after taking some pictures of the view, Jen and I bounced up out of there. 

Nice view, but too much of a ghost town sprinkled with older people.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,3,2,2,7g6BkUp2FNoWgXw6eutuqg

5781901,2010-01-05,5,939j88ceB05Te3D7kQPwSA,"This review goes for the club portion of the VooDoo Lounge.

We arrived about 1230am after leaving the Ghost Bar in the Palms.  I had never been here and wanted to check it out (I am a huge fan of the Ghost Bar and it has a similar rooftop set up).

Boy what a gross experience.  I do not exaggerate when I say this place smelled like vomit.  We paid our $20 cover charges and stepped into the elevator.  It smelt like puke and it looked like there were puke stains that had been poorly cleaned up (maybe from the night before on New Years eve).  Anyways, no big deal.  Its just the elevator right?  Well when we got off the elevator the smell did not change that much.  Depending on where you were standing in the club the puke smell went from strong to mild.  There was a line around the corner for the mens bathroom but no line for the ladies.  I am not a single guy, but for you single guys out there...this place was a meat market.  While in line for the rest room I found where the smell was comming from.  I found 2 piles of puke on the floor, both different colors.  I found another pile of puke shoved in the cornber near the end of the bar too.  On our way out I told the bouncer and he didn't care (not surprising).  Speaking of the puke problem, don't they serve food here during earlier hours?      

Conclusion:  While this place had/has potential it was just disgusting.  Maybe they just did a crappy job cleaning up from NYE.  I heard the Ghost Bar used to be twice as much so a lot of locals frequent this place.  However, we paid the same cover to get into here as the Ghost bar.  If your looking for a rooftop experience GO TO THE GHOST BAR!!!!  I will never come back to this place or the Rio.",HmhDnOPGv2txxcI9mnZjgA,1,0,1,JPpB31B8JOjt-QLSXo-JiA

Rooftop view is pretty awesome but if you don't have bottle service, you can't get to a rail to enjoy it and chill unless you're at one of the two narrow corners of the roof.

3 drinks were $40.  If you order a special drink in like a 65 oz goblet it's like $50.  Bottle service starts at around $300 if I remember correctly.  Music wasn't terrible.  Good mix of hip hop, EDM, some rock and 80s.  DJ was fairly smooth although I thought he didn't play enough of the songs and transitioned too quickly.  He should, in my opinion, stay with good popular songs longer.  He gave each song like 20 seconds it seemed like before moving on.  Also, the crowd was a bit ghetto in my opinion (sorry to sound like a snob because I'm not).  I'm just going to describe it like it was so that my review is honest and accurate. Mostly people having a good time though.  Nothing bad.  People were mostly polite and did the right thing when trying to scoot by.  This was our first and only visit.

I wasn't aware of the restaurant hours and it actually was about to close but they were hospitable enough to seat and serve us at a table next to a window with a great view.  The Porterhouse I had was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right so that you could really taste the flavor of the beef- most important.  The bit of bone marrow as one of the sides was also deeeeeelicious.

It was a Thursday evening, so out in the lobby there were promoters handing out free passes to the actual ""lounge"" part of the two-story piece of awesome.  The inside lounge was okay... nothing special, especially since the DJ was playing really badly mixed 80's songs and it seemed like a complete disservice to the outdoor area where they had go-go dancers, a phenomenal view of the city rivaled only by Ghost, and good Top 40 music.",ivW4PlSyvGjqXIMsTjbHkQ,1,1,4,yCuSIeKpoUGzOZIy1zjjzg

I did not have an entree instead I did two appetizers. I started of with the foie gras and it did not disappoint.  Tasty tasty stuff.  I left nothing for Miss Manners.  I used the bread to sop up the left over sauce and oil.
Secondly, I had the pork belly.  It was excellent as well,  I suggest mixing in a salad between the two if one is going to go the foie and pork belly route.  It was rich followed by rich and hindsight suggests that I have a salad with some sort of acid between the two.

Local ladies are free, $10 for locals males and $20 for non-locals that eventually creeps up to $30 as the night progresses.  $50 for 3 drinks, a whiskey on the rocks, long island ice tea and Hennessey & coke.  Steep prices makes this place a total 2 stars, where you can find another place for cheaper, but not compromise too much of the view.

No doubt this place is fun, good variety of locals just hanging out and a bunch of Californians out partying and having a good time.

Plenty of both in-door and out-door standing, sitting and dancing room.  

Table service is so-so, bottomless sweet mixers were refilled almost immediately before it got really low.  My favorite part of the deal were the olives.  With the nice breeze on a perfect May night, it did feel like we're on top of the world.

The Voodoo -- how you disappointed me!

Second best thing, great music from Lady Gaga to Eddy Grant (still love ""Electric Avenue"").  Third, no cover.

The Boodoo -- people are able to smoke inside; ratio of guys to gals 5:1; $17 for a red bull and Skyy Vodka -- that's just sad.  On a Thursday night at 930pm - it was ages 50+ and I was the spring chicken in the room (cougar alert), seriously, WTH!  At 1030pm, the gogo dancers began...and 25 (or so) gents stood around and finally had something to drool over (okay, 24 + 1 you might know).  I was dressed up a bit, but clearly, the posted dress code was not enforced...guys, especially were very casual.

I remember I was wearing flip flops that night so they must not be very strict on the dress code. The atmosphere of the place is pretty cool, from what I can remember. There's a nice outdoor area where there was a separate dj. I couldn't tell you what he was spinning though! Inside, there was a live band and they were really cool, my friends got on stage and danced with them.

When you finally get into the club you are indoors once you get outside you are amazed at how beautiful it is.

I'm from newyork and used to going to places where a jack and coke is $7.00

The reason this place is getting the 4 stars is because if I had money I would have enjoyed myself a little bit more.
