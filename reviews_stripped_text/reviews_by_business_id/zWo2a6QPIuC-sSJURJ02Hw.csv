It was closed for remodeling, so we went to this cafe. It took us 30 minutes to get our order taken....and this took 2 attempts to track someone down.  It then another 15 minutes to get soup and a half sandwich.  The turkey noodle soup was nothing more than flavored water with cubes of processed turkey.  The ham sandwiches were very dry and only helped by the fact that the waitress spilled the soup on the sandwiches which gave it the only bit of moisture that it had.
Upon checking out, the cashier asked...How was everything?....we replied...""awful"". Then she did not respond at all...she handed us our change.  That was the end of the mistake we made by trying to eat lunch today at Terribles.",u75L5cco6mPpBz4rbyxTEQ,1,1,1,nm_f8jIpAGB445QnbkCKnQ

Simply gross. I had good expectations for this place. Now, I am a cheap something else but I normally find some good food for a great deal.

The mashed potatoes were running....since when does mashed potatoes run (like eggs)? *throws up a little bit in my mouth* I tasted it and it was purely inedible. I sent it back, paid, and left.

My first time in Gigi was our server, the food was incredible for the money and incredible in general. Great service on this visit. I felt guilty for spending under ten bucks on a prime rib dinner so I put a $10.00 into a nickel video poker slot on the way out. I changed the denomination to ten cents, bet max ($0.50) and dealt. One card away from a royal straight flush. Tossed the other card, and wham. $400. That made the meal even better. The second time in we got the Russian Ice Princess hag for a server - the service was terrible, the food was wrong and we were basically told to ""deal with it"" by the hag... very much the opposite experience as before.

Welcome to the Bougainvillea Cafe inside the Terrible's Casino. I've always wanted to check this place out. After seeing the sign outside for the 2.99 special I decided to come inside. The restaurant itself reminded me of a Cracker Barrel, kind of eerily homely. After I sat down and ordered my meal it must have taken them around 5 minutes to cook it. I was kind of scared. Fortunately, everything was pretty good. 

The pancakes were soft, but not too soft, and was not too sweet but just sweet enough. The whipped butter that came with it was 100% butter and spread very easily. 

The bacon was warm and crispy, and not greasy at all. 

The only gripe I can think of is that the eggs were not quite cooked specifically to my order... but I came to expect that.

Unfortunately, I can also comment (positively) on the security.  There was an unruly couple at a table about 15 feet away.  The male of the relationship appeared to be a bit of a drama queen, making loud snorting and swallowing sounds during his meal (not great for restaurant ambiance).

It's late (or early depending on how you want to look at it), and my crew and I are fiending for some food.  I'm a big breakfast fan, so I suggest Terrible's.  Since I'm the only one capable of driving, that's exactly where we ended up.

This place isn't too much of a secret.  When we went there, the place was pretty busy, and we had about a 10 minute wait.  Even after we had been seated, it was another 10 minutes or so until we even saw our server.  Once our server was tending to us though, she was super friendly.

The food itself is probably nothing to write home about, but when you're drunk or starving, it really hits the spot.  From 11pm-7am, they have graveyard specials.  My wife and I split the country fried steak and eggs (4.99), while other people in our party got the steak and eggs (5.99), corned beef hash (4.99) and spaghetti with meatballs (under $8).

The portions were more than anyone person can handle (hence the sharing between my wife and I), and for about $30 + tip, I was able to feed 5 people.

If you're not too picky about your food, and want to get your grub on, check this place out.

When me and the wifey checked this place out, I was expecting bad service and low quality food based on some of the reviews. That was a no no. But how else can you perceive a 24 hour diner in one of the older casinos down the street from the heart of the strip? My advice to you is to always keep an open mind, especially when trying out new places.

With that said, from the host sitting us down to our waiter taking our order, everything was done in a satisfactory and timely matter. The only thing that kinda irked me was that the rice option if you decide to get it is steamed rice. Im used to rice pilaf. That and a particular odor seemed to bother my wife. I think they shampoo their carpet (which I think is a good thing) but it smells like they didnt get all the shampoo completely out. You mix that with the smoke smell of the place and it has a slight musty scent. Not overpowering but you can definitely smell a hint of it.

Other surprises are that the menu is diverse in food options. From breakfast items to American dishes to Chinese cuisine, im sure there is something for everyone in your party.

We demanded to talk to the cashier, and then the supervisor, and then the General Manager (some old white lady) who all said that we have to pay together instead of separately. 

We are COLLEGE STUDENTS with part time jobs, we just came from a party for the Japanese Student Association of UNLV. Of course we can afford your shitty $6 pasta alfredos. Second, theft is not within our moral code as innocent students. Third, if you wanted us to leave TOGETHER then don't tell us to do this at 3 o' clock in the morning where we are all tired and want to go home. 

Some of us, have priorities like a job, or classes, and we just wanted to have a quick meal. 

Stop making really bad food too. I made 3 bathroom trips within one and a half hour of being stuck here.  One of the waiters tried to stop me from going to the bathroom. I guess his grumpy ass thought I was trying to run for it. 

We weren't being obnoxious, there are plenty of seats and dining tables around us, and WE ARE PAYING. Since all of us were getting pretty sick from the Alfredo Sauce, Pasta Sauce, Pizzas, and poorly made dishes, one by one we started to go up to the cashiers counter to pay for our own dishes and leave early, only to be turned away at the front door. 

I started noticing a pattern, only females that complained managed to pay and leave, and the rest of the dudes were only allowed to leave together. By that point, I started making a scene on the Host/Cashier's Table for the restaurant, threatening to accuse them of being sexist and claiming that they are calling us thieves until they finally let me pay for my own bill. 

The amount of bullshit that I had to go through to eat here was fucking insane. I have never been to a dining location where I, and my peers, are viewed as fraudsters in the back of the minds of the entire staff as we entered. We didn't come inside in hoodies and waving Glocks in the air. We wanted to fucking eat. 

The staff wouldn't let us leave. They served us food that gave us the shits. And they tacked on undeserved gratuity on our bills.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,3,0,1,B1T5s-L_9DmS1kkcUXJTTQ

First of all, you have the clientèle. Those trucker hats you see aren't worn by some hipster wannabe from LA clad in an Urban Outfitters ""vintage"" tee, it's worn by an actual trucker or a retiree dining with his wife. After a few days of the glitz of the Strip, it's refreshing to go hang out with people who aren't living above their means.

Secondly, the food is cheap and better than it has to be. Sign up for a player's card and a plate of pancakes, eggs, bacon, & sausage will set you back about $3, even if it's not the middle of the night.

Third, the service is friendly & efficient. They're working their butts off, so tip them well.

3577068,2011-08-19,0,zWo2a6QPIuC-sSJURJ02Hw,"In a nutshell, this place has awful customer service and I'll never go back again.

I have previously reviewed the buffet at Terrible's, and this place is right next door.  I actually gave pretty favorable reviews to the buffet, but the 24 hour Bougainvillea Cafe right next door would get 0 stars if I could do that.

I went at around 3 AM.  3/4 of the restaurant was closed for cleaning and all the diners were seated in the back part of the restaurant.  I'm not sure why they are cleaning it at 3 AM since there would certainly be far less traffic at 5 or 6 AM.  There were 3 or 4 people who were seating people and working the register, at least 3 people waiting the tables, and 2 people doing drinks and such.  I would call this overkill for a time when they only have about 30 total seats available.  Only about 20 people were there when I was seated -- they were not busy.

The real problem is that even with all this staff the customer service was as bad as you can get.  The person who seated me indicated that he didn't have a specials menu but would bring one over.  I was seated at a dirty table with chairs askew and the condiments sitting at the far corner of the table.  Nearly 10 minutes later I'm without a menu when the server comes to take my order and it takes her another few minutes to go get one.  I order immediately and begin waiting.  

I overhear a conversation from a table next to mine that it took them an hour to get their food, just as they were finishing up.  When they pay their bill and as they are leaving they make a joke about how long it will take them to get their change back.  As I'm approaching the half hour mark of waiting, another table next to mine remarks that they've been there at least 45 minutes.   A man who was seated at the same time as me and had ordered a breakfast special had his food within 20 minutes, while my $5 breakfast special still wasn't there after half an hour, so I just left.  

At no time did a server come over to check on me, to notify me of any delays, or to apologize.  It really is the most backwards way to run a restaurant, and it's doubly bad since it reflects horribly on the casino.  For instance, they could have told me that it would be a while and I could go gamble for half an hour or whatever.  That would have been just fine with me rather than having me sit there for 30+ minutes.  Seems like it would be prudent, no?  The casino makes money and I don't get angry at poor service.

I had fully planned on grabbing a bite to eat, throwing a couple hundred in a slot or video poker machine, playing a few hours and then coming back to get something on the way out.  Instead I just left and went somewhere else.  In Vegas it's not like you don't have a hundred options for casinos and thousands of options for food at 3 AM.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,2,0,1,q8s7lVwF-sT_4fVZbZKPZg

I'm not a huge steak fan but I'd definitely say mine was cooked better than other places I've been to.  For something that's 9.99 you'd expect a whole bunch of nastiness but everything was surprisingly decent, even the Terribles sauce was yummy and tangy.

Well, in a few words, NOT HALF BAD!  I started coming here when I was a poor college student at UNLV.  Ah, the memories.  Now I'm a poor 30 year old.  With that said, the cafe has some great food.  They have a ton of specials for you night owls, lots of good breakfast combos from 11 PM to around 7 AM everyday.  They also have a separate special menu for Mexican fare, the likes of tacos, nachos and fajitas as well as lots of other stuff.  And they have a special 1/2 a rotisserie chicken with your choice between potato (baked or mashed) and veggies, or with refried beans and Spanish rice.  I usually go for the beans and rice, because you get this spicy mango salsa that goes pretty good with the chicken.  All for $5.99!  The chicken is usually pretty moist and succulent, BUT don't get it when it's after 11 PM.  They turn off the rotisseries by then, so you may get a chicken that's been
sitting in the warmer for a bit.  I learned that one from one of our servers, nice guy....but more on that later.  Try the onion rings too, they come stacked like a pyramid (like you find at Red Robin's) and they come with a few different dipping sauces.  Crispy and not too greasy.

The big surprise here is the Chinese food.  YES, the Chinese food!  It's actually very good!  It's close to what you will find at some of the local Chinese restaurants, but at almost half the price!  They have a lunch special here where you can choose from several of their entrees, and you also get Egg Drop Soup, crispy noodles for dipping in hot mustard or sweet sour sauce, a bowl of steamed rice, and a Fortune Cookie!  All for the bargain basement price of $5.99!  And yeppers, the food is exceptional!

My fav for the lunch special is the Hong Kong Chow Mein.  You will not go wrong!  It is a HUGE plate of fried chow mein noodles on the bottom, with this silky, almost gravy-like sauce on the top (doesn't taste like gravy either, but it's still real good).  It's topped off with large pieces of shrimp, chicken, and char siu pork.  It's got a ton of veggies too, like straw mushrooms, baby bok choy, carrots, onions, and baby corn.  It's enough food for two!  And for the low price it can't be beat!  I get this almost every time I'm there.  This dish will cost you $7.99 at dinner but it's still worth it, and you still get all the same sides with your dish.

The decor here is simple, but comfortable.  They have a separate section for smoking/non smoking, but with all the smoke on the way in it's hard to tell the difference.  The only bad thing is that one side of the cafe has a half wall, which means you can see out and right next door to the Terrible's buffet.  Stick with the cafe, the buffet is um...not so great.  

Every time I've been there I've had great service.  I can't remember their names right now, but my favorite servers have been this jolly Filipino guy, and this one hilarious gay guy.  Both provided me excellent service with no filler.  Kept the drinks full, very attentive but not overly attentive.  These guys were top notch.  Rare to find in dives like this.

If you can get through the smoke, get over eating at a casino called, Terrible's, and avoid the buffet, you should definitely give this place a go.  Keep an open mind because sometimes this place can be full of drunk college kids late at night getting a cheap meal (I used to be one of them).

So, the three of us ordered the HKCM dinner (only offered at dinner, and minus the soup; those were the changes, in my 1st review, it was offered at lunch), and the birthday boy got the t-bone steak dinner (choice of potato and vegetable). So the three of us got the crunchy noodles, two kinds of sauces (spicy, sweet), chopsticks, and a fortune cookie- this is part one. And shortly after, we got the platters of food (a very generous portion- I never finish it) and a separate saucer with a bowl of white rice (my husband never eats his).

So, right away, my husband noticed that it was different, the sauce was sweeter. So, he asked Anita, if the was the dish was changed. She said ""It's a different cook tonight. You want Papa- he's the best. He's off tonight, though."" Well, us ladies, we just added some spicy sauce, and it was a nice adjustment (just a little for me, and it was enough). So my husband knows the manager here, and he told us, a while back, "" We have a real chinese cook back there."" Thought it was kinda funny, so I mentioned it.    

The decor is vines and flowers. The seating is comprised of tables and chairs, booths, or combos (booth on one side, chairs on the other). It's like a tee-pee in here, because it's pretty long inside. You can't tell from the outside. Pay the tab at the cashier near the entrance, where the hostess seats you. BTW, most of the people eating here are elderly and sometimes families.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,0,5,4Rqsp3DfphAW8-vxO_hgiA

Open, 24 hrs, the Bougainvillea Cafe is tucked away upstairs at Terrible's Casino on Paradise and Flamingo. Parking is easy as there is an outdoor lot as well as a parking structure. 

Portions are fairly big and can be easily shared. Over the years, I've enjoyed the nachos appetizer,  chicken dinner, country fried steak, and the prime rib meal. Didn't like the New York steak meal or the ribs though. They also have a Chinese and Mexican menu, although I have never ordered from them (except the nachos). 

They've also got some pretty good graveyard specials. My favorite is the country fried steak and eggs for $5. The gravy is thick and can be served on the side.

The steak is a deep fried variety.  Not too many places pan fry.  I prefer pan fry.  For a deep fried variety, this steak was good.  Fork tender (as it should be) with a good amount of seasoning.  The gravy was standard white sausage gravy.  The low point had to be the hash browns.  If this place was more popular and had a lot of people eating breakfast, my hash browns would have been perfect.  You know when hash browns are cooked in advance and sit around a bit too long and the crispy outside gets tough.  This is what I got.  If there was enough turnaround in the restaurant, the hash would rotating faster.  So, if this were a Clint Eastwood movie, there is the good, bad and the ugly.  The good being the steak. the bad being the hash brown.  The ugly has to be the biscuit.  When I say ugly, I mean it in a good way.  This biscuit was ugly huge.  It looked like a short stack under gravy.  It's a good thing I got the 8oz steak instead of the 16oz ($6.99).",NI2glfU_qscu4YcxtI8F9Q,0,0,4,NSR4vnWm1LmTD6unNbdPyw

This is my final meal in Las Vegas before heading back to the airport. So I decided to return to the Terrible Casino for their $9.99 specials .i.e. Full rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs.  

The special is at this 24-hour diner called the Bougainvillea Cafe; located in the Mezzanie level (one floor above the casino-level). There are a ton of other specials too. But my target was definitely for the Baby Back Ribs specials. For $9.99, I get a full rack of ribs drenched in BBQ sauce, a corn on a cob, a side of mashed potatoes and a toasted sourdough bread. It's not Cattlemen's, Claim Jumper or any of the finer steakhouses version, but it's decent for the price. The rack's end has some dried and burnt pieces and the middle has some moist and juicy meat. The Mashed Potatoes were ok, but the corn on the cob has no comment from me (I didn't eat it).

CHICKEN FRIED STEAK AND EGGS AT 4AM!!!!

So yeah, we were headed back to the hotel, and were looking for some cheap Vegas eats at 4am.  Most of the locals' spots were closed, so we were relegated to eating in a casino.  Terribles?  Never been there.  Special night owl menu from 11pm-7am?  Oh boy, let's give it a shot.

We walked into Terribles, and I'll save that for another review.  But we went up to the Bougainvillea Cafe, and while it was a crappy looking diner feel (think Denny's), it was comfortable and quiet.  The server was pleasant and friendly.

The menu was standard fare.  Cheap.  Breakfast 24 hours.  Nice.  Gf asked me for a preliminary take on it.  A solid 1-2 stars I said.

Gf got 2 eggs, hashbrowns, chicken fried steak with gravy and toast for $5.99. Yep, you read that right.  Chicken fried steak was pretty good for a heart-attack on a plate.

I went for the prime steak and 2 eggs, hashbrowns (that were actually fried and really good... I don't usually eat hashbrowns), and sourdough toast.  The bread for the toast was really good, Ryman was impressed.  And the steak wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected.  I ordered my eggs over-medium and they came out over-easy... exactly as I figured they would, which was perfect!

For the prices, the quantity, the service, and the 24 hour breakfast, this place absolutely cannot be beat in Vegas.  If you're looking for a place to eat for cheap and without drama after losing at the tables (so hence you want a cheap meal), this place is the spot.  I would absolutely go back.  3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the prices.  4 stars as long as you accept it for what it is... a grease spoon.",dRZ0gVGH0EpRKgTu4wpwcQ,3,2,4,fZMcWFjnSh_lS_TzOYEisw
