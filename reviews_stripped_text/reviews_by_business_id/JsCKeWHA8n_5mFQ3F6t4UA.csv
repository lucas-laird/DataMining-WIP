The chips were big and warm and the salsa was delicious. I had the roasted veggie fajitas and they were the best I've ever had--fresh broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, cherry tomatoes and onions with a yummy marinade, served with spicy guacamole, pico, and beans and rice. The cilantro rice is really tasty. My husband had a chili relleno, chicken enchilada, and a tamale. He chose the black beans and Mexican rice and they were good too, but I liked the cilantro rice and refried beans best. The portions were big and we left stuffed. Absolutely a great place. Nice and casual, and we didn't need a reservation. Price was right, too. Even with a decent tip it was less than $50.",cTGZT3Y-bIF0PIIQHhNUkQ,1,0,5,9YSlcZmZ4bqKagO9zQbIQg

Perhaps Mexican food is in my comfort zone, but as I strolled through New York-New York around dinner time, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez sounded very appetizing.

It's a small restaurant, with many tables outnumber the few booths. Our waitress was below average to everyone she was serving, though my party and I noted that the other waiters seemed more attentive. The bar served 48 oz frozen margaritas, which could be seen on many of the dining tables. It's also good to note that there is a wide selection of tequila and margaritas offered.

Like many Mexican restaurants (at least in California), chips and salsa were presented as starters. The salsa was amazing, with the chips not lacking either. I ordered a chicken enchilada and chicken burrito two item combo, along with a mojito. The mojito was delicious; the drink was almost green from the mint. Both the enchilada and burrito did not disappoint, either. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and the sauces covering each item were delicious. The beans were tasty, but the rice was not good. It tasted like the microwavable kind. 

Overall, the food was very good, and well-priced. I was surprised to find it comparable to the great Mexican-American food chains found in California.",KOpYgePzlCVrnzZLgOlFPQ,1,0,4,v_6HvT1FxrJAjxF3-AaJxw
35271,2009-12-29,0,JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA,"Being from Texas, I automatically give Mexican food places a little leeway once I leave the state. The positives were that the chips and salsa were really good as were the rice and beans. My husband said his fish tacos were great, but I cannot attest since he did not let me try them. The margarita I had (a house rocks with salt) was decent, but had a slightly off flavor that I could not identify. I guess it could not have been too bad since I ordered another one. I ordered the shrimp tacos which by themselves would have been two stars. The sauce they had on them was just weird, and the shrimp was overdone. 
But, the service was great - really friendly and attentive, but I didn't feel rushed.",kngL5mBU4Dcal41rXwACXw,1,0,3,7x6MML9yNiuu3O2J-0tSCw

Don't get me wrong the food it was tasty but food is nothing when your being judged by the staff and getting bad service. Just a FYI for your staff just because a family looks young and maybe doesn't seem like they could afford to eat there seeing as thats the vibe we got the WHOLE time doesn't mean they should be treated badly.

169525,2013-03-14,0,JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA,"Gonzalez Y Gonzalez does not offer authentic Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination: the tacos are served on hard shells, they do not stock lime juice for margaritas, and the flour tortillas that came with my fajitas were chewy. 

The salsa was tasty enough, chunky and underwritten by a smoky chipotle flavor, but the chips were too thick for my taste. I ordered the vegetable fajitas, and the mixed vegetables were a mixture of excellent and undercooked. The standard cherry tomatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini were superbly cooked, but the dish also contained some hard, chewy greens that offset that pleasantness. The flour tortillas on the side were not edible.. I believe they did not steam them, so they were sort of... tough. And thick. 

As for the sides, you get your standard rice and beans. I opted for the cilantro rice and refried beans (topped with cheddar cheese, do not expect cojita) which were fine enough. 

The service was friendly, and the food arrived promptly. 

The bottom line: If you're in a pinch, it's better than opting for the food court and probably wont cost you much more. Go elsewhere if you're looking to eat well, because this place seems to be fairly hit-or-miss in terms of quality.",1Cv6rFOhayrPJMd_gSS9zg,0,0,2,17H8Ciogm7K6gZYKy6HP7w

I'm giving it 2 stars only because it was ok & not disgusting. I was there a couple wks ago for the 1st time & was dissapointed :-( I had cheese enchiladas wth rice & beans. Let's start wth the enchiladas, the sauce was ok, I think they use las palmas canned salsa, which is definitely not 5 stars. The rice seemed to come from a pouch that reads ""spanish rice"" and the beans were merely edible. I don't c the hype about this place at all. Also, the service sucks!!! I wanted to sit wth my frnds at a little side table next to the restaurant so the hostess told me to order my food to go frm the bar. I walked over & waited while the bar waitress chit chatted wth a couple of guys. The heffer completely ignored me 4 a few mins till I waved at her. She clearly saw me but didn't want to be bothered while she flirted wth the guys.

Actually there were three waiters just hanging out by the bar talking story and playing with each other while my waiter was staring at us like we were rock stars.

Then, in an effort to give tip I was supposed to get $6 back in change. I asked him to give me dollar bills so that I could tip him what I wanted. When he came back, he assumed he was going to get $5 before even giving me my change back and passed me a $1. I was like, ""no, no, no"" can I please get my change and get a receipt? He was looking at me really confused, and didn't want to give me my change. 

Finally I got my stuff - I was upset and pissed off that the restaurant sucked. Not to mention my best friend had soup that was filled with salt as well and she was upset too.

The serivce here was beyond what I expected. There was a Raider/Saints preseason game on TV, and we my chick and I sat at the bar. Wanted to sit down, have a beer, watch the game and relax. Especially after the 3 and a half hour drive over here. The bartender who took our orders, I think her name was Heather, she was a real Cool chick. She was from Denver and told us how much of a Broncos fan she was. I Love It when a chick knows her shit about football! Actually kind of a turn-on.......

Any-who, LOL.
          I ordered a Negro Modelo, and my chick had a Mango Margarita. They use Patron Silver, which gained some points from me. Bartender actually gave us an extra one for free. Which I gladly drank. Our appetizer we shared a chicken tortilla soup, its been a while since I had a bowl of this stuff, and I was shocked on how tasty this soup was, We both agreed that this soup was very flavorful. Highly recommed this soup if your looking for a lil snack. 

For our entrees, I ordered the Barbacoa Chimichanga. Very good flavor, meat was perfect, came with rice & beans and some guacamole. My chick had the three tacos, two beef & one chicken. Nothing amazing about them from what she said. 

Nothing negative to say about this place. Food was good, not too expensive (Mexican Food should never be expensive), the people passing by streets that look like New York is Awesome, but the thing that impressed me the most by this place was the service.

Service: Upon arriving we were seated right away in the patio area. Our waiter, Chris was awesome. He was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu items. After we placed our order he gave each of us a detailed description of what we ordered and how the food would be served.  We were really impressed with the level of service Chris provided.  He was genuinely nice and friendly.

Food: The food exceeded my expectations. We started with chips and salsa, which were very good. The chips were crispy, fresh, and warm; and the salsa was very flavorful and spicy, but not too hot. Note, the chips and salsa are not free, but definitely worth the $3.00. 
I ordered the Chimichanga with shredded beef (pictured below). The chimichanga was STUFFED with shredded beef and the flour tortilla was fried to perfection. Considering the outside is fried, it was not overly greasy. The shredded beef was full of flavor; a bit on the spicy side but delicious if you like spicy food. I personally could not get enough. It was topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and shredded cheese. It came with a side of pinto beans and rice. The beans had lots of flavor and were topped with a bit of crumbled queso fresco. The rice was cooked well but had a lemony flavor which I didn't care for much.
My husband ordered a 3 item plate with a taco, enchilada, and burrito. It came with a side of refried beans and rice. The taco was made of carnitas, the enchilada was chicken, and the burrito was ground beef. FYI, you have the option to choose different types of meats. My husband said the carnitas had lots of flavor and were really good. They were cooked well and not greasy. The only thing he did not care for much was the carnitas were served in chunks rather than shredded. I think it's more of a personal preference. The ground beef burrito and chicken enchilada were also good. He agreed that the rice had a lemony taste but said it was good and didn't mind it.

Value: Prices were reasonable and comparable to other restaurants. We spent about $47.00 for chips & salsa, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks. The food was definitely worth it; very flavorful & filling.

I would definitely recommend eating here and cannot wait to go back.",xAQhXEWb5fChv4JXun__Mw,0,0,5,eZPLKIii-uC4XGEiyEA2LA

To have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant was strange but it was only 3 dollars and this is Vegas after all. The server however was quick to bring us more chips free of charge which was awesome. The salsa was great with a good spice to it. I ordered the Ancho Chili Halibut which had great flavor to it. Sided with a slightly too bland for my taste cilantro lime rice and black beans which were delicious if a bit runny. The halibut was slightly over cooked but only just and was so good the toughness is almost not even worth mentioning.

My chicken tortilla soup was just how I like it - good amount of broth-to-food ratio and everything was super flavorful - I looooove my cilantro, that's for sure! Chicken was nice and tender.

Food:
- Steak tacos. The meat was juicy, tender and seasoned well. Almost melted in my mouth. ~$11
- Guac. It was nice, fresh and chunky. Served in a traditional bowl and had a jalapeño kick to it. ~$8

Drinks: 
Washed all this awesome Mexican food down with 2 ice cold beers. Forgot cost.

In total with tip I probably dropped $33-$36 bucks. All well WORTH it. Hand downs this was one of the best meals I had in Vegas. Also at night the Spanish music comes on and it's like Latin Quarters Lounge in here.

I'm in Vegas for business, staying at New York New York, and I stopped in at Gonzalez y Gonzalez for dinner. It's one of several eateries inside the casino. Long flight. I was starving. I'm traveling by myself and I really didn't want to wander too far from my room. I asked the host-dude if I could sit at the bar. He said okay. No one gave me a menu. They had some little takeout meus at the bar. I looked one over. In fact, I practically memorized the f*king thing. I sat there for 15-20 minutes and the little bartendresses never asked me if I wanted a drink or something to eat. Nada. Zip. Zed. I could have been f**king invisible.

The gals at the bar were quite adept at avoiding eye contact with me, however. Seriously, how could they miss me? I'm 230 pounds of pure ugly. Kind of hard to miss. I finally picked myself up and walked away. I shot a look at host-dude as I left. ""WTF?"" I said with my totally pissed off body language. I could understand if the place had been slammed, but there was barely a soul inside.

Honest to gawd, it takes a LOT to make me flip a place off over my shoulder, as I walk away with my WALLET FULL OF MONEY. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.

We popped in before heading to the Jimmy Buffett concert at the MGM so we were on a margarita-drinking roll when we stopped by. The food was good, but it was pretty standard Mexican (not that that's a bad thing); not particularly creative but nevertheless a good, decently-priced fish taco with good service. Since we were heading to the concert, we opted for their oversized margarita (the 48oz. behemoth) for the road.

Sunday through Thursday they have deals for $15.95 that offer a pretty decent-sized, though watered-down margarita with your meal!

The hubby and I got this deal:
- I got the chicken and shrimp suiza. Jam-packed tortilla was moist, well-flavored shredded chicken and fat, succulent grilled shrimp with sour cream and guac. The dish also came with black beans and a green-colored rice that was okay. I paired this with their classic lime margarita on the rocks. 
- My husband got the shrimp and lobster chile relleno. I don't really like chile relleno and this was no exception; it was soggy and I don't the batter they cook it on. His meal was served with refried beans and green rice. He paired his with a blended mango margarita.

Good Spot for
- people watching
- not waiting forever to get a table
- cheesy, delicious Mexican food
- FAST service

Bad Spot for
- a quiet meal (Screaming patrons on the roller coaster that goes indoors right above)
- getting drunk for moderately cheap (watered-down drinks)
- free chips and salsa. They are really good and well portioned, but they cost money. I'm from CA and I'm not used to having to pay for that.",JSH-Bj-nd4TcvAZW4PFPRQ,0,0,4,5s7JFsFafV05i4DwbfuQyg

What it will be is a totally above average casino meal with reasonable (for the Strip) prices, free chips/salsa and great service. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were the nicest guys in the world...not too chatty, not too formal, just straight up friendly. The salsa is nicely spicy, the food portions are big and it all comes out as described. I'm sure if I paid twice as much I could have a better meal elsewhere, but that's hardly Gonzalez/Gonzalez's problem, right?

We were seated and greeted by our waiter who offered us chips and salsa (not on the house!) as well as some of their many tequilas that they offer. I mean, seriously! they have a good range of different tequilas from the usual Patron Silver under their blanco and silver menu that also includes Jose Cuervo Platino and Don Julio Blanco, they also have Cuervo tradicional and 1800 reposado under the reposado menus, and they also have abocado, muy anejo tequilas and regular anejo. Super awesome if you are a tequila fan. Of course they also have their margaritas, beers, and even wine. 

The husband and I wanted to try to eat something else other than Mexican food for dinner so we only ordered an appetizer to share. We ordered the chicken empanadas which were ok. Crispy, flaky and soft with a good amount of chicken in them. I thought they were a bit on the oily side but then again, I guess it is fried food. My brother ordered the carne asada tacos which I took a bite off and were alright. At $15.95 though, I thought they would be a tad bit better.

+ Carne asada street tacos ($15.95): The steak was tender with a really good marinated flavor, and the tomatillo salsa gave it a spicy, but not in your face, kick.
- Burrito ($14.95): My friend didn't care for this at all and barely ate it. Francisco offered to give her something else on the house, which was not needed, but very appreciated.
+ Chips and Salsa ($2.95): Not included unlike other Mexican restaurants. The mesquite roasted tomato salsa gave the warm tortilla chips a unique flavor profile.

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito (it cost over $10, which seemed a little pricey), and it did not come with beans and rice on the side. I also did not get an option of what type of beans I wanted in my burrito, and that seems odd for a Mexican restaurant. I received my order very quickly, and once I started eating I realized why. It was a store bought, flour tortilla, with over cooked rice and I'm guessing canned re-fried  beans inside. The cheese inside was not completely melted. It was truly the worst Mexican food I've ever had, and I'm originally from California, so I've had good, authentic Mexican food. I would also avoid the margaritas at this place.

It was a little hard to find - it's located on one of the ""side streets"" that branch off the casino floor.  Don't be afraid to ask someone to point you in the right direction.

Most of the food was good, but the salsa was too hot for my taste.  I asked whether they had a milder salsa, and my server looked at me like I had asked whether they had puppies on the menu.  Unfortunately, my enchilada/burrito combination plate was drenched with the salsa, which made the whole meal unpleasant.  Unless your tastes run to pretty hot food, ask them to hold the salsa, and order a side of guacamole for the chips.  (Both the chips and the guac were good, but not great).

The ambiance was, of course, faux New York side street.  The roller coaster ran overhead; fortunately, they manage to make it a lot less noisy when it runs through the casino than when it runs outside the building.

The selection of margaritas is excellent, if a bit pricey.  Most of them run $15 and up, which is more than most entrees on the menu.  Since I am not a margarita connoisseur, I ordered the happy hour house margarita for $5, and it was fine.

The service was quick, but it would have helped if our server spoke better English, or even Spanish.  (I think her first language originated somewhere in East Asia, but it was hard to tell.)  My wife asked a few questions, and it seems that the server's approach to answering was ""Just Say No,"" which might be fine for drugs but was not very helpful if you're trying to make a substitution on the menu.

We came back to our hotel after a Cirque Du Soleil show and wanted a nighttime snack so we settled for this place. 

The Gonzalez nachos were FANTASTIC - some of the best nachos I've ever had! Nothing was too overwhelming and I found myself digging in despite my pretty full stomach. It was huge and great to share among the 3 of us. Not only were the various toppings really fresh, plentiful, yet not too heavy, but the chips themselves were really delicious. 

El Grande Helado is basically a giant ball of dense and creamy vanilla ice cream deep fried in a flaky cinnamon shell served with deep fried cinnamon pita strips.... It's death but SO unregretfully amazing.. My parents don't have much of a sweet tooth so I ate basically the whole damn thing. I normally don't like fried ice cream because the fried shell distracts from the ice cream, but in this case, the shell was thin and flaky like cereal and offered great texture to the dish! And of course, how can fried cinnamon strips with vanilla ice cream not be amazing....

They were generous with the taco appetizers. The margaritas were great value and very timely in delivery. I enjoyed the salad and although it was plain jane chicken Caesar, the corn bread was the reason I ordered it.

Three words: BEST. SALSA. EVER. Wait, is that drool on my space bar as I nostalgically reminisce about the most fantastic, mind blowing restaurant salsa I've had IN MY LIFE? Hold on as I grab some more tissue. *slobber slobber*

We flagged the waiter down and I attempted to charm the kadoozie out of him to get the secret recipe, but all we pulled out was that it was ""made fresh daily"", ""the tomatoes are roasted on a hickory grill"" and ""vegetarians always get mad 'cuz they say there's meat flavor in the salsa when in fact it's just the smoke from the grill which gives it that sweet smoky taste"". Stupid vegetarians. Every day I try to consume twice as much meat as recommended by my doctor just to cancel out one vegetable-eating moron. 

I got the enchiladas and hubby got a burrito. We got massive food coma immediately after and swore that the next night we'd down massive amounts of red bull to make up for pitifully calling it quits at 11pm. Vegas Fail!

Came back again for a farewell lunch a few days later. The tortilla soup I ordered was nothing to write home about but jiminy crickets the hubby's chile relleno knocked my socks off. Buahaha, that's what she said.

The service was attentive

Why do restaurants not put prices for the drinks on the menu - very annoying
Overall food quality is just ok - about the level of Mexican chain restaurants like Chevy's

We knew Vegas was very hot but we weren't expecting to feel dehydrated the minute we stepped out. So the house margarita came in effect so delicious. It was buy one get one off.

I anticipated the drink to be more for novelty than anything, but both the peach and mango margaritas turned out to be surprising good (not too sugary sweet) despite the notable lack of healthy liquor pours (probably for the better).

The bar that's housed right on the walkway proved itself dangerously convenient. We didn't have to hop into the restaurant to access the bar--it was out in the open waiting for us to find it. I can't vouch for the food, but the drinks aren't too shabby if I don't say so myself.

skinless chicken and a bean and cheese burrito. 

Steak Nachos were TEENY TINY!!! We had literally 10
chips each with beans, cheese, 2 small strips of steak
and a jalepeno pepper baked on top. They were placed
around in a circle - fancy like. To their credit, the meat was
very tasty but damn... come on... give me more than 10 
chips for $12. I was expecting a plate of nachos. Plural.

Bean & Cheese burrito was also small. Taco Bell makes
bigger burritos. No bullshit. $5 for that.

The chips and salsa are endless. Verde salsa was decent.
Wait, our chip basket had a handful of unbroken chips and
then the rest of the basket was FULL of chip pieces. WTF?

Whatever. The waiter came by and asked, ""Everthing ok? 
Can I get you anything else?""

Whoever writes their menu should write ads for online daters, as my friend Dita likes to say (and she is quoted so often): Singles in Sin City would be getting more ass than a toilet seat if we put these folks on the job.

The drinks were watered down.  We all noticed, except for the one person who ordered a bottled beer (he's my attorney, a senior partner from the law firm I call 'Sharks & Piranhas.')  You're liable to get higher from your blood being too thinned-out by consuming their drinks (and being on the high desert plateau) than you'll ever be from the alcohol in their beverages.  Maybe 1 star, at best.

Me an my boyfriend and other people are lined up to get seated at the restaurant. The hostess seemed to be plainly ignoring us while she was taking her sweet time gossiping with a waitress. I think the whole line of people were glaring at her while she was gossiping instead of seating us.

After a long while, she seats the first party. at least 5 minutes later she seats me and my boyfriend. Seriously?! how long does it take to seat a party of 2?

Service inside was not much better. We ordered food and got our free chips and salsa (saving grace). One of our friends decided to join us. The server is NO where to be found. Finally find him and flag him down to put in our friends order. Later, 2 more of our friends join us and same problem. 

I've never been in the restaurant business, but logically I would think big party = great bill = potentially more tip? Guess it didn't matter to him that we normally tip 25%. I was upset at the wait and having to literally find him ourselves most of the time. I told my bf to dock the tip.

Now I don't get what it is about places like this that have multiple TV's and have all the TV's on the same game while there are multiple games on different channels.  I mean, stagger some TV's between different games yanno people?  We don't all want to watch the same commercials on every TV.

Anyhow, the food.

I sat at the bar and got a margarita that was pretty good.  I got some chips and salsa.  After reading some other reviews here, I'm kinda miffed.  They only brought me the red salsa, I didn't even get to try the green one!  Bastards!  The chips were HOT when they brought them out, and were light and flavorful, good chips.  The red salsa was adequate in flavor but lacked a little heat, so nothing outstanding there.

The bartender asked if I was 'really hungry' while I perused the menu.  I said sure I guess, so he suggested the Fajita burrito.  That choice sounded fine so that's what I got.  It was served fairly quickly and yeah it was a good sized burrito served with rice and beans.  The meat was not bad, heavy taste on the marinade, but did seem to be cooked alright.  The burrito itself was heavy, the guacamole did not taste fresh, and the sauce they put on the burrito seemed distracting to the taste of the fajitas.

My biggest peeve was the the side rice and beans were not good at all.  The rice lacked flavor and seemed stale, and the beans were horrid.  I've tasted better beans right out of a can of Rosarito.  I only ate about half of what was on the plate and that's highly unusual for me. 

So overall this seemed a decent place to grab a margie and a tequila shot, but I don't plan on eating here again.",YCkSm_4c5_d5OteO2d60Eg,0,0,2,W8oyWa6Qfoz0sqT4P98QkA

First off my friends and I were here for breakfast we ordered the chilaquiles, tortilla soup and a cesar salad and a table side guacamole. First off chilaquiles tasted like they were from a day before just reheated and they didn't even look like chilaquiles but more like nachos just a bunch of tortilla chips thrown on a plate topped with cheese and some salsa and since when do chilaquiles come with meat? Now moving on to the tortilla soup the smell coming from it was not appetizing but I thought ok it doesn't look that bad so I decide to try it and a maruchan instant soup would've satisfied me more than that disgusting plate. Now salad what can u expect from a salad? It's just salad and chicken and now the guacamole huge chunks of onion like they cut the whole onion into four pieces so u couldn't even taste the avocado it was more like onion with ovacado. Just a huge disappointment of a restaurant that is giving real Mexican food a bad reputation because that's far from it whoever wrote down the recipes and thought it was delicious enough to sell need to give they're food a real try before selling it to the public.

Gonzalez Y Gonzalez came up with high marks on Yelp, so we decided to give it a go, since New York New York was a central location for us. Entering from the doors nearest the Brooklyn Bridge, the restaurant was very easy to find fairly close to where we came in.

The hostess was very friendly and we were seated immediately, even though it was a Saturday night. The restaurant is fairly noisy, but not so much that you're annoyed. It's not quiet and intimate, but it's not loud and douchey like a sports bar can be. It appears that there are no booths, only tables. However, the tables are far enough apart that you don't feel as though you're dining with a family of 60 when there.

Chips and salsa are not complimentary - we asked only after they weren't brought to us. They are VERY tasty however, so I recommend the $3 or whatever to get them; the serving is generous, and the salsa fire-roasted goodness.

I ordered the Arrachera, which is the restaurant's version of a carne asada platter. Holy crap, was it AMAZING! SO flavorful, and so perfectly cooked! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! It comes with a small cup of ""drunken beans"" which I totally suggest dipping the meat into before each bite - jackpot in your mouth!

I ordered an El Coco Loco margarita, and let me tell you - it was a religious experience, as if the food wasn't good enough. The ingredients are Malibu, tequila, pina colada mix, and sweet & sour mix, blended. I'm not kidding when I say it tasted almost exactly like Smarties Candy. Unreal, and so damned good!

Our waiter and one other guy that served us were not terribly friendly; normally, I would have dinged a star for that, but the food is SO good that it made up for not becoming BFFs with the wait staff. The guys should have been more personable, and I hope they aren't indicative of the rest of the staff's attitude at Gonzalez Y Gonzalez.

The chips were decent, obviously not house made, but not poured out of a Totino's bag either. The salsa was nothing to write home about, but neither was it bland and they also gave me plenty of it. My margarita was excellent, neither too stiff nor watered down; expertly made and delicious. The fajitas were always going to be the kicker in this deal though. Even in Austin I'm picky about fajitas, but outside of Texas I rarely find any I like. These fajitas, I liked. They weren't burnt, the marinade on the chicken wasn't overpowering or non-existent, and they tasted like fajitas are supposed to taste. Also the fajitas came with 4 tortillas! I thought fajitas only ever came with 3. Maybe this was just Vegas excess.

We walked right up and were seated right away. The place was a little packed, the Packers vs. Bears! a nice positive vibe in the place for sure. 
It took a while for us to get our waters and to even be approached by our server but after that i think the service got a good grade. I've had better, but then again the place was busy so I'm fair! =) 
For starters they offered up some fresh chips and Salsa, not bad. The chips were warm not the best I've had but not the worst. Huge plus was that they were free! a fine example of what EVERY Mexican food spot should do! I ordered up the chimichanga and taquitos. The chimichanga was kinda bare on the outside, Vegas and all Mexican shops this is where you fail when it comes to SD. The chicken on the inside though, FREAKING GOOD!!

I ordered the carnitas tacos and he had enchiladas. I for one loved the food. My tacos were served with big portions of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream on the side for me to put on my tacos. The rice and beans were good too. My husband said he also enjoyed his enchiladas. The prices were comparable to portions that you get which was also nice to find in Vegas. Our waiter was also attentive and checked on us often throughout the meal. Then something happened, he just brought us the check without offering dessert which we wanted and we had to let him know. He seemed annoyed by that for some reason. For dessert I ordered flan any my husband ordered the fried icecream and we both really enjoyed the dessert. The flan was made from scratch instead of coming from a box which you do get in alot of Mexican restaurants. I love flan and I consider myself somewhat of an expert. LOL. Then our waiter disappears and we end up waiting forever for the check which is one of my pet peeves when I go to restaurant. He was so quick to bring it before no he is nowhere to be found. Then he finally brings us the check some 15minutes later and we stick our card in there and then again he pulls his disappearing act. It was at least another 15 minutes that went by making paying for our a meal a 30 minute ordeal, then he reappears again and he is socializing with his co-workers instead of collecting the check. The quickest way to piss me off in a hurry is to keep to me waiting too long for something that should not take long in the first place. Our food was settled and we were hungry by the time he decided to grace us with his presence. I was amazed at how quick he changed after the dessert incident. He went from being a great server to being a real jerk and for that I deduct two stars. This could have easily been a 5 star experience had our waiter not been bi-polar.

Like everyone is saying, yes the salsa is very good!!!!  We probably had like 2 backets of chips and they gave us our own salsa!  If you know me at all, you know I hate sharing salsas because chips and salsa is my favorite food! :) 

I probably could've left right after my complimentary chips and salsa, but that might have been a little mean.  I wonder if anyone has ever done that...haha.

The place has a really interesting décor, with rough brick walls, red and yellow accents and the usual touches that are supposed to be reminiscent of Old Mexico.

Since neither one of us was exceptionally hungry, we asked if we could split a combo and they readily agreed. Our server was pleasant enough, and I have no complaints about the service.

But while most Mexican restaurants that I know of bring out chips and salsa almost immediately, we were told that there would be a $3.00 charge. So we skipped that. Then the sodas were priced at $3.50, which is much higher than I expected. Our food appeared almost as if by magic, but neither the rice nor the frijoles refritos were hot, but just warm.

We were seated at a booth that had crumbs covering the seats, and then sat at our table for probably 15 minutes before our server came over. We ordered our drinks and chips & salsa ($3/not free). Our server checked for us that we could get the specialty on-the-rocks margaritas in the souvenir cactus cups, and gave us the price before putting it on, which was nice. My boyfriend's was gonna be $46, and he said okay, but to make It strong, and they absolutely did. The bartending got this place an extra star. It took a very long time for them to come out, which makes sense given our special request, but once they did (we could see them sitting at the server counter from our seats), our server passed by them three times without grabbing them until we flagged her down. 

We got steak and chicken fajitas, and the steak was more medium-well than medium-rare, and I didn't care for it much. The chicken had good seasoning and was cooked properly, so that was better. My boyfriend got the trio dish which came with a chicken enchilada (okay-basically a pile of mush without much flavor), a pork tamale (disgusting . . . really disgusting. It looked identical to the enchilada, but I can't even describe how gross it was), and a mini taco (okay).  

They forgot our corn tortillas and we asked or server, but then forgot and we had to remind her again ten minutes later once we could finally flag her down. I felt bad for the table next to us at one point, because after we reminded her a second time for the tortillas and a refill on a soda, she turned to them when they were about to place an order, then realized she forgot the tortillas and for them, then turned to take their order again, then realized one of our sodas were empty and refilled it, then finally actually took their order. Happy to be served, but that was pretty chaotic.

Overall, I'd recommend visiting the bar, only, and maybe even pass on the chips and salsa, since I don't feel they're really worth the $3. The food wasn't good, and the amount of time it took to get our food and to get everything that came with our food was just a waste.",q8OdcTdl_VEsw-zL8Vwrqw,2,1,2,BG2KUiUg0WQkoARFGzRcUw

Let me first start with the margaritas... you get a full pitcher of your choice of margarita in a colored yard glass (plastic) which is easy, and fun, to carry around the Strip. We kept returning with our glass to get discounted refills. It was pretty awesome. The downside is they won't mix flavors for you. Also, after the 3rd one you start to crave other booze.

Now for dinner: Our waiter was very efficient. The chips and yummy salsa arrived on our table immediately after being seated. I ordered the Baracoa beef enchiladas - they were AMAZING! I got 3 enchiladas and a side of rice and beans. It was a lot of food, I was unable to finish my meal. The prices are comparable with other Mexican restaurants I have been to in Wisconsin. 

I loved how this resturant had a private feel, even though it was inside New York New York.  I would recommend stopping here if you are wandering around the strip and get a craving for Mexcian food :)",NpZ6hMBncbIvAo4btwrvZQ,0,0,4,z6pKkurLEshDIvt1lOoSwA

I ordered the chicken tortilla soup, the cheapest thing on the menu, and quite tasty as well.  The soup had generous portions of chicken (this is nice because restaurants skip out on meat portions quite often).  Instead of traditional red salsa, they give you salsa verde and another dip that tastes similar to guacamole, but in a salsa form.

Our waiter was terrific!  He gave us recommendations on what was good and checked up on us a reasonable amount of times.  

It starts off with their house salsa and chips.  It's kinda salty but I'm a salt lover so it was awesome to me.  We ordered the honey chipotle chicken wings and a crispy shrimp something (so sorrry... I forgot the name).  Both were appetizers and both were deliciouso.  :)

We shared a meal.  It was the Avocado Skillet ribeye.  We had it made medium well and again it was very delicious.  

This place is located in New York New York Hotel.  Place is nice and well kempt and our waiter took a picture for us...twice.  Nice vibes and the price was reasonable.  Food portions are perfect.",YC6Gw9d3yoqIECPzxb2vig,0,0,5,jav4F0nNdc8xWtEPKm1AWw

My sensitive stomach did not cooperate being that it's such a heavy meal to be eating as your first meal of the day, but it was so delicious! I wish I was able to finish all of the food we ordered, but sadly I couldn't. 

We ordered guacamole, fajitas, and fish tacos. I didn't get to try the fish tacos, but my boyfriend said those were the best tacos he's ever had in his life. The fajitas were standard, but delicious. The guac was alright, but I'm a garlic monster so that could be why. 

Service in the beginning was awesome! We got everything in a timely manner. But when trying to cash out, we had to wait forever. Our server was so busy helping everyone else and doing others jobs though that we understood the feeling. 

Overall, this place was awesome! I would come back here again and I'd probably try the fish tacos next time too.",Ji3_ekKRP26qbOkU-knD2A,0,0,4,P9eQ5lm2byRnGWlEsdB9Ew

I ordered the pozole and she ordered the tortilla soup cause she wasn't feeling too well. It definitely hit the spot though!! I've only had homemade pozole once which happened to be my first time and so I figured right now try this one, plus I was craving it! My pozole was super delicious, just perfect! We also ordered the table side guacamole, it wasn't bad, but definitely not worth $8.75.

I do have to say that the 4 stars were for the food, maybe a star for service and it was lacking it. The hostesses up front weren't very friendly, more like in a hurry. When my girlfriend and I were seated, it took 10 mins for someone to come ask us what we wanted to drink. I understand if it was a weekend but it's Monday. 

Of course I will give this restaurant another shot next time we are back here, or staying at the Monte Carlo again.",CO-hrvV8pwxWufDqgtVrdw,1,1,4,vt3aQDUzWaB1C6T4N5JQBQ

On Saturday, April 27, 2013 she and all over her staff front and back were absolutely amazing and worked with us immensely on short short notice. 

The back story: 
We had just finished up with a wedding and the Bride (my cousin) decided she wanted the entire bridal party and all the guests to meet at Gonzalez's in New York New York for a celebratory dinner. Mind you this was NOT preplanned so we did not have a reservation and had a party over 20+ headed that way. My girlfriend and I were one of the first ones there and took it upon ourselves to get a reservation in. We were extremely worried with the amount of people expected that we would not be able to all be seated at one time. The hostess was unable to book a reservation of that size on short notice without the G.M's approval...so we spoke with Mary. Mary was amazing (I couldn't say it enough). She and her staff cleared out the left side of the restaurant as the guests left and ""reserved"" the tables for our party. They were able to pull a table together for the entire party and saved some seats along the outside of the table for any stragglers. 

They we're more than accommodating with our needs and even with a party of our size the service was great. Each person we encountered was happy and smiled and was willing to help service our needs. The food was prompt (a little slower than normal, but nothing outrageous taking in our groups size and short notice).

Needless to say the Bride and Groom and everyone who came were extremely please with the attention Gonzalez's staff gave all of us, the food, and the experience in general. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I will make it a point to stop back in and have another Beer-A-Rida (or three) and the yummy chips and salsa! 

Thanks again Mary - you guys were truly life savers!!",b8LZXHFi-gpxEDfJ_WxFYg,0,0,5,XpfJR_rqVeGGzNaFdY4RSg

First impressions, cute Mexican theme and it was clean. We were greeted and shown to our table -fantastic! No waiting!

Note: if the waiter asks if you want chips and Salsa... just know it's not free. (Like other Mexican restaurants)

So I ordered the tortilla chicken soup and carne Asada tacos. Probably a little too much for me, but I thought I'd give it a go.

The tortilla soup was Delish, plenty of veggies and chicken was freshly Grilled. I like how they brought me my bowl and poured the soup broth right in front of me. 

The tacos were ok. I've had better... it was bland and warm, no sizzling steak... the flavor was not there. I felt like I needed to add hot sauce or something to it to make it a little more tastey. 

Either way, the service was great. But the food was ok.",TEYwFtIioGhcHp38LwIhsg,0,0,3,MgwyR-WoK5pjj8lQRJcjwg

5927687,2013-01-31,0,JsCKeWHA8n_5mFQ3F6t4UA,"Feels like home! Finally, a Mexican restaurant on the Strip with great food and not for $20 for 2 tacos. 

Even though the steak in my fajitas weren't stellar, I still really enjoyed my meal. I think it's because they didnt put the plate over a candle, so the steak became cold and dry very fast. The guacamole, beans, and sour cream more than made up for it though. My other half ordered the Arrachera (pretty much like carne asada) which was freaking amazing. The meat was perfectly cooked and tender with BIG flavor. Was kinda jealous that he ordered that! My steak was nowhere near as good as his. 

Lots of different kind of margaritas. We had the El Choco Loco, and it was fantastic! IT HAD MALBIU IN IT!

The downside... Our server was... weird. He would come to our table and not saying anything. He just stood there waiting for US to say something. Uh. But it looked like the servers around us were decent, so maybe we got the sour one out of the bunch. 

Also, no complimentary chips and salsa. Meh. It was $2.95 at least. 

Overall, great Mexican food that doesn't try to be fancy like most Vegas restaurants do. Just the kind of Mexican food you crave! Finally a great restaurant on the Strip that has great prices. I didn't feel ripped off at all.",1l8-c0409lKevE9RTVsRLA,1,0,4,284gPRIay0UGJttE-hu4dQ
