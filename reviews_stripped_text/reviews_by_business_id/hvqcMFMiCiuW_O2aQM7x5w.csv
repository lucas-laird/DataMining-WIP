They started a credit card fee which I guess is OK but I think it would be better to hide the fee in the food price. I've never seen a place charge a $3 credit fee for a $60 order. The fee is a nice option for the $20 or less meals. Many places wont let you use your card when it's that cheap.",03NRSwsey4oLxQ6O0_pMrw,0,0,4,kflKig76BPdY9hOk-tiroQ

We were quite surprised I must say in the quaint and comfort of the cafe.  Our waitress was extremely kind and helpful.  She gave great suggestions, waited on our table with promptness.  Sometimes I hesitate at the quality of a restaurant in a corner gas station plaza, but I am glad this went above our expectations.  Never judge a book by its cover.  

The hummus and pita was delicious.  The greek salad was huge.  The chicken kabob was a bit salty for my taste buds.",pgSQybHXDdmu1dN08IdqYA,0,0,4,25Ucpv-0kKSV8bE-V84jmg

170382,2012-02-22,0,hvqcMFMiCiuW_O2aQM7x5w,"I usually thoroughly enjoy my experience here... however, the last time I ordered from there I was extremely disappointed by several things. So, I ordered my food through the 24 hour food delivery website I like to use. I ordered the cheeseburger and added on fries, the philly with everything (which says it includes fries), and 2 16 oz. Sprites. 

Every time I have ordered from Ambrosia Cafe I have received my food in 20 min. or less, I don't know if the management or owners have changed, but this was not the case this time! I didn't get my food for 45 min. to an hour! The boy who delivered it did not have a receipt for me when I asked him for one. Once I got the food in the house and opened it to dig in the fries with the cheeseburger were cold, the sprites were watered down because of the melted ice, and the philly had no fries with it. I then made a phone call to Ambrosia Cafe. A girl answered the phone and I told her that I had just received my order and I was missing an order of fries. She then told me that it did not come with fries that they were extra. I quickly let her know that their menu online states that the Philly with Everything does come with fries. She then tells me that she didn't even know that they had a website, but fries are only served with that particular sandwich at lunch time. I let her know that the menu on the website says nothing about that and then I asked to speak to a manager. She told me that there was no manager there at the time, but that she would let her know. Yeah right!!!! I finally just got off the phone with her because she clearly had no clue about her place of work at all! I plan on calling back again and trying to get a manager on the phone and if not I will go in person and speak to someone. I am usually a pretty easy going person, but I do not like being lied to and I most certainly expect to get what I pay for. Needless to say I will probably not be ordering from Ambrosia Cafe ever again! Hope this review helps someone! Thanks for listening!",NphdjrE8H45jEt5GjBo9SQ,1,0,1,z7uIF2l4P062fJD8FyjEMg

Their food is nothing really special, but the convenient location had us coming back a few times throughout the year. The gyros are filled with flavorful meat and the tzatziki is very good. The Greek fries are to die for. Their falafel is too dense and too heavily spiced with cumin for my taste. Before today, this place would have earned a solid  3 stars. But today we returned with my brother and his fam for lunch and they served him RAW chicken wings! Totally unacceptable! The server was very gracious when we informed her and even offered us a fresh batch which we declined. She came back to the table a few minutes later and asked to have the undercooked pieces so she could show the cool.

Pulled up to the place and noticed they had a nice little patio setup with table and chairs out front. Looked pretty cozy. Walked inside and the coziness continued. I was impressed with the inside as they even had a little fireplace going. Food was already bagged up and ready to go. Paid for my order quickly and left. 

As to the food, I wasn't overly impressed but was happy with what it was. I had the Falafel sandwich. falafel were big and meaty and the sandwich was good for the $5.95. Also had the Ambrosia appetizer plate for my wife. Grapeleaves were very good. Tzatziki was good, Hummus and Tabbouleh were OK. 

Was a bit disappointed with a chicken parm sub though. Not sure if anyone told them but the chicken on a chicken parm should be breaded. This was like strips of chicken you get in a salad, covered in cheese and sauce.

Very brown & crrispy on the outside, barely cooked inside, not good obviously the oil was too hot . His chicken wings came out  when I finished my plate. But he had to send them back to cook more since he asked for them extra well done & they were only as golden as the non-crispy fries.

I was wanting something fairly healthy and greek/mediterranean sounded fabulous. This place was right up the street so I headed over with high hopes and let me say I was got more than I was hoping for a quickly lunch.

I went in and there was only one other table, but the place was really cute and the lady behind the counter told me to find a seat. I found a nice little two seater high top in the corner. She quickly brought me a menu and I perused their offerings. I was really in the mood for hummus, but wanted something more substantial as well. I noticed they had a gyro and fries, so I ordered that and a hummus platter. Luckily, she was smart and just ordered me a gyro because I know I wouldn't have needed those fries. 

Hummus and Pita - YUM YUM YUM. I only meant to eat half the pita but good grief it was so good and the hummus was so smooth, I kept shoveling it in. I swear she probably thought I was coming off of a fast. I boxed up the other half and ordered more pita for later. I dreaming of it now.

Gyro - I've never been THAT fond of gyros but all doubts have been squelched! More yummy, soft, warm pita topped with fabulous meat. I usually get gyros that are dry but NOT THIS ONE. The tatziki was amazing too. It took me no time to polish this thing off. 

Tatziki - I love love love tatziki and this stuff was above and beyond good. It was/is so tasty I order a platter to go so I can enjoy it at home. The thing I love is that tatziki tends to last a good bit of time so I put it in good tupperware and will be slathering some grilled chicken with it for dinner tonight.

Service - the service was good and she was quiet friendly. I secretly loved that she had a accent because that tells me this place is probably family owned. Also probably why it was so good.

This is my new favorite place to go and luckily we are starting our busy season so I'll be going up to Creel on a regular basis. I really can't wait to try other things on the menu.

On a spontaneous trip to Vegas this past Memorial Day weekend, I had the honor of meeting some down to earth peeps (DJ David and Chrissy) whom introduced my friend and I to some local Mediterranean food off the strip.

After a long drive, we needed a quick bite to eat before hitting the nightlife scene so this was a convenient place for us. This small and casual restaurant accomodates nearly all kinds of foodies..from the health-conscious to the hard-core carnivores. 

Waitress was attentive and we were seated almost immediately. I liked the colorful and bright menu! Being as indecisive as I am, you really couldn't go wrong with the menu selection. Everything sounded familiar, simple, and straight-forward. 

I ordered the ""Vegetarian Gyro"" sandwich (tabouleh, fresh veggies, and tzatziki sauce) and my friend ordered the ""Simply The Best"" sandwich (Authentic gyro meat, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce.)  Both ~$6-7 and a decent portion size.

KEY IMPORTANCE: Freshness!!!

Upon arrival (quick service btw), I was visually impressed at the setup and freshness of the ingredients. Presentation is important to me so my mouth was salivating already. My camera phone didn't do it justice though (see pics), but let me tell you..as simple as the ingredients were...nothing beats a good gyro, but FRESH and TOP QUALITY ingredients! This had THAT!!! The tabouleh was flavored nicely. Simple and Delish!

My friend devoured his sandwich in what seemed like 3 bites or maybe it was 2 and a half. It all happened so fast that by the time I looked at him, he was smiling with a look of sweet and utter satisfaction! According to him, ""It WAS simply the best."" HAHA! Or maybe he was just THAT hungry?! =p

As for me...I'm a pretty slow eater. I made sure to chew 13 times before I swallowed. haha. Okay..maybe not 13 times, but I did let all the flavors dance around in my mouth, but only to get a text soon after to meet up with the rest of our crew in 20 minutes! EEk! So I got to eat half and took the rest ""doggy-bag"" style.  

Only 4 stars since the restroom could have used a bit of a makeover. I know, but I'm anal like that. Anywhoo, I will definitely head back to ""Ambrosia Cafe"" to try out their other menu items. I hear their ""Falafel Sandwich"" and ""Eggplant Parmesan sub"" are HITS!

Considering my first impression, I was actually quite pleased with my lunch. I ordered the 'felafel' sandwich plate ($6.99) which came with a good version of tabbouleh and an undressed salad. I realized after eating half the sandwich that I should put that little salad inside, since the weird (or to be kind, interesting) combination of falafel, hummus, pickle, and peperoncini needed a little color and a touch more crunch. The falafel itself was beautifully browned and flavorful, but could have used a bit more kick. The hummus was fine, yet fairly standard, and the tabbouleh salad was properly done with lots of lemon juice. After the hummus and tabbouleh at Sunnin in Los Angeles, however, I am finding it difficult not to draw comparisons and become slightly disappointed in these two items elsewhere. The portion of lentil soup ($3.99) was huge, but I'm not sure it is supposed to be, judging by the way the waitress had to move at the pace of a snail to avoid spilling any of it over onto the plate. I appreciated her care, but unfortunately by the time it got to me it wasn't super hot anymore. It had a pleasant hint of curry that I enjoyed, but needed salt and a probably a more flavorful stock. It definitely improved once I doctored the leftovers back home later that day. I wasn't terribly impressed with my lunch, yet it was better than I'd expected so I was content. This isn't a place you would go out of your way for, but if I lived in the neighborhood I wouldn't mind its presence and would most likely frequent it on occasion (they also deliver).",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,2,1,3,_K6eI6EGwa3AhktKlVjZ7w

I had the Falafel Special that came with a Falafel Sandwich and a side of Tabbouleh. I haven't had Falafel in years so I forgot what it tasted like. I was pleased when I took a bite out of the sandwich it was good. The Tabbouleh tasted really fresh and zesty. You could tell it was just made because it wasn't soggy. 

My husband had the Cheese Steak Sandwich with the Greek Fries. The fries were too salty for my taste but my husband seemed to like it. We wanted to try something new so I didn't mind it. 

The atmosphere is relaxing and calm which is a nice change especially after work. I also liked the music they played while I was in there. It was most likely The Beatles Greatest Hits ...when I thought no one was around me I would sing along to some of the songs. I couldn't help it! When we were getting ready to leave the waiter asked if I liked the Beatles. I was thinking ""Oh no ...Did I sing that loud"" ? I told him that I did hoping he wasn't subjected to my singing. It was refreshing that he was so personable because it just makes the place feel more welcoming.

So far EVERYTHING I've had is DELICIOUS!  Big portions, fresh food, nice flavors.  

They have the BEST RICE i've ever had.  It's moist and cooked perfectly, with a unique flavor.

Chicken Kabobs are awesome.

I've had the ribs twice,  ""Mediteranian Style"" which means not bathed in bbq sauce.  Tender, Juicy and naturally flavorful with just grilled onions on top.  

Other than the rice,  the other sides are Meh.  Beans and potoato salad seem like pre-made.

Deserts also seem like pre-bought, but not bad.

Entree's, price and deliveries make up for
the mediocre side stuff.

We ordered a large meat lovers pizza, popcorn shrimp, and onion rings. The meal with a $5 delivery fee tacked on for us being over the 5 mile radius came out to $38. This was a bit pricey for a bland, thin crusted pizza with virtually no sauce and paper thin slices of meat (i cannot tolerate dry pizza), frozen popcorn shrimp, and very small and thin onion rings. They were not cheap on condiments, although the dressings were of very poor quality. Good thing only two people were eating. We stayed at Tahiti Village and the front desk made us leave the room and walk to the main lobby (in a different building). Not the delivery person's fault but sure did not help the experience either.",p3rQEm0gp2UsR4Rwh6FirA,1,1,3,OqJEDqPPbJc9nLcGV8Y35g

5339805,2013-02-02,1,hvqcMFMiCiuW_O2aQM7x5w,"My husband and I call this place ""Pizza Kabobs"" because of their oddly-spaced window signage.

When we are feeling lazy (which is often) we tend to pull out the box of menus and order some delivery... About 4 months ago we tried Pizza Kabobs aka Ambrosia Cafe and we were not disappointed.

Their menus has a vast variety - part pizzeria, part-Mediterranean fare. We felt the need to try a little bit of everything. 73 dollars and 15 minutes later we had A LOT of food at our door.

Their gyros were pretty darn good. Not life changing but excellent for delivery expectations. I love a good shish kabob sandwich and I was in love with their beef. The hummus was great but they were a little stingy with their pita bread. The pita bread was probably the most memorable and our big favorite but when they give you a big order of hummus - 3 pitas ain't gonna cover it. We knew for next time - order extra pita bread.

The pizza was actually pretty good - again the expectations were low because it seemed Mediterranean was their calling. The sauce and cheese ratio was awesome. I wish they had a bigger selection of pizzas but their Meatlovers was loved by us both.

Their phillys weren't bad either!! I ordered the philly with everything and the meat was well flavored and the fixins were fantastic.

We have ordered from them at least 1x a month since then and while their delivery time isn't always consistent (one time we waited like an hour and ordered much less food) we always finish the meal saying ""can't wait till next time"".

I would definitely recommend Pizza Kabobs (Ambrosia..whatever) to anyone in the neighborhood.

5357959,2010-11-23,0,hvqcMFMiCiuW_O2aQM7x5w,"I've since tried the chicken noodle soup, the pizza, and the calzone.

The chicken noodle soup is not what you'd expect from a traditional chicken noodle. It's lemony and has much more depth of flavor. There were definitely notes of cilantro in there. I couldn't put it down. It's incredibly interesting, yet still comforting in the way that you want chicken noodle to be.

Their pizza is good. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but I like their crust, their sauce, and their cheese. The pepperoni pie was good, as was the gyro meat. I haven't yet tried the Greek pizza because the boyfriend doesn't like feta or olives, but I really can't wait to do so.

If you order a calzone, and you are less than two linebackers, get the smaller size. The large is enormous. We ordered the large with onions and gyro meat. It was good, but I felt like it had a little too much mozzarella cheese and not enough ricotta. The ricotta seemed to be all piled around the edges, while the inside was all mozz. I think they could mix it up a bit more. 

For my update, the calzone gets three stars, the pizza gets four, and the chicken noodle gets five. Averages out to four stars again. Next up, I'm trying their ribs and their wings.",WuPCEBFGX8W3ouTOd57ywQ,5,2,4,3-x9rPr4Wz9g9Y0FIG4iKQ

With that being said I most recently dined in with a bunch of friends and ordered a slew of items. Started off with the hummus, Greek fries and falafel which were all on point. 

Followed up with some popcorn shrimp and placed our orders for a few gyro salads, an order of their signature pork chops and the beef and blue salad. All of which were amazing. 

Ended up ordering a gyro pizza to go, to see if their pies carried any weight, and let me tell you it did. 

All in all, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. What's great too is they deliver and they also have some great lunch specials. The server who took care of us was Hunter, he was cool too. Really nice and didn't screw up any of our orders (which is always important to me).",TcVOQpmPh4tgM-U10qmt1Q,0,0,4,r35Z3KleWuBRyUgC32sXbg

My first thought as I entered Ambrosia was how dark it was.  My second thought was that I should call Robert Irvine from Mission Impossible ASAP. But I thought hey looks are decieving so let's DO THIS! Ok first off it is not a Cafe by any means. It is more like a diner  with bad old plush hotel furnishings. Well it was midday and I got to cheat so I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and my daughter ordered the Hamburger meal thinking these are 2 hard to mess up menu items. #Wrong ... My daughters burger buns were so Saturated in Grease and she refused to eat it and it was way overloaded with Mayonaisse. The Non Attentive waitress brought out a New bun however that let you really taste the flavorless Frozen hamburger patty. My philly cheese steak was disgusting. The mushrooms taste like they were canned the meat was non existent. The fries on the side, those frozen fries they gave her and I barely any. The waitress did not offer Ketchup, ranch or anything else with the meal. So I am waiting for a refill and as I look around I start to notice just how dirty and filthy and disgusting this establishment really was.  I did not eat any further. Nor did my daughter. I asked for the check and we raced out the door and I hear that little innocent voice come out of my daughters mouth singing ""I told you we shoulda went to Subway""  Alas she was right however I told her well We would not have known if we didn't try it. We left sad and turned off we wasted a eat whatever we want day here at Ambrosia. They are a Restaraunt Impossible waiting to happen!
