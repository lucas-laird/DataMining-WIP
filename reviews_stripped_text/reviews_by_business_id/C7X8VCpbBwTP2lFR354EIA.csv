89028,2014-09-26,1,C7X8VCpbBwTP2lFR354EIA,"I cannot stress how happy I am and how lucky I feel that Grass Roots Juice Bar is within walking distance of my residence.  The store is beautifully merchandised with just about all of the fruits and veggies and nuts and seeds and flowers that I could possibly be eating/drinking on display just to tantalize me during my wait.  Their produce is as organic as it gets here in Las Vegas.

I had the vegan tortilla soup.  It was a perfect balance of ""creamy"", spicy, hearty, and delicious.  It is impressive that it was made to order within minutes.  Because they want to keep it raw, it is also served at the perfect temperature for a hungry person to devour immediately - albeit at just the right pace to also savor each flavorful spoonful.

I also had the veggieccino.  Once you have this drink, I don't see the point in going back to any sugar-laden version of a chocolate or mocha shake.  It is extremely filling, holds its temperature well (I had the soup first and hoped to make the smoothie last - and it did).  I've also had the mint whatever-its-called coffee smoothie drink that they make, and I love that as well.

I took a to go menu so that I can mark off what I've had and continue trying everything else on the list over the next few weeks.

Owner Shane Stuart has a gift for simultaneously checking in with his staff on the juice line, schmoozing with regulars as they come in, and educating newbies.  He makes the art of hospitality look easy and fun.  Too many places in this town - even the ones with good food - forget about that lost art of hospitality and the impact it has on customer experience.

As a fellow small business owner downtown, I wholeheartedly endorse this business.  I hope they open up shop many more places around town.  I hope they inspire the masses to eat more plant-based foods at all times of the day.  I hope they expand their hours here in this location because I get hungry later too ya know.

Thanks for all you do, Shane and Nichole and staff.  Us downtowners love you!",2IWP7DubDnm6MXrSelJxdA,11,4,5,aiUzVzFohJHgxTtSHwgM-g

Grass Roots, unlike most of the cold press juice places, is centered around Vitamix creations. This gives you delicious smoothies packed with vitamins AND fiber. My go-to is the Holy Alkaline for a super refreshing green experience. Also love how many greens are packed into the Chocolate Peanut Butter, and how delicious it tastes.

The often overlooked part of the menu is their soup selections, and I don't know why. Their tortilla soup is completely plant-based, and probably better than any tortilla soup you can order in the city. Sooooo delicious!

We actually had a sample of a mint capigreeno while we were trying to decide what to order. It was delicious enough that I would've ordered that, had I not already had an Americano a few hours before. I asked about their nut milks and he assured us they were made in house. He let us sample the almond milk and coconut milk and they were so good and fresh tasting. My husband was skeptical (meat and potato boy) but to my surprise, he ordered the creme de avocate instead of going to Subway . And he was impressed! I ordered the chocolate peanut smoothie and loved them both. I would definitely return next time we are in town. It served as a meal for me, and I was full when I finished.

I came during a rush (4 people ahead of me) so I waited a few minutes before someone was available to take my order, no problem. 32 minutes later I received my smoothie... kind of a problem, I had to extend my parking meter it took so long.

My suggestion to them would be to get a new POS system and get new staff or retrain. The gentleman working seemed to be in charge and was very nice but they were flustered, disorganized and were making drinks no one ordered or didn't know how to claim. I work in the food industry,  so I sympathize with them during rush periods but they need a better system by either assigning names/numbers to their customers' orders, possibly getting another set of hands to work the register (three people beind me had to wait at least 5 minutes before their order was taken), and have their order tickets be more clear because they were confused on almost all of them. Also, the one girl with long hair should take a servsafe class to know it's not ok to come to work looking like you rolled out of bed and hair all messy, it's not professional.

1118544,2015-03-16,1,C7X8VCpbBwTP2lFR354EIA,"Delicious, filling, organic -- and hands down the best place to grab a to-go lunch in downtown Vegas. GrassRoots soups have amazing flavors with great ingredients. (You know a place has potential when it even thinks through what salt it uses -- in this case, Himalayan salt!) For $8, I can get a soup that satisfies me, and I have a robust appetite. I know someone who likes the Cashew Broccoli Cheeze soup so much that he ordered a bucket for his family's Thanksgiving dinner.

GrassRoots just added pressed juice; I look forward to trying it. This is the first place in the Vegas valley, that I know of, to make juice that is both pressed and organic. Not everything I eat is organic, but avoiding conventional pesticides especially matters in a concentrated juice. There is plenty more on the menu. I am still exploring.

I have never written a Yelp review before today, but am a big GrassRoots fan and have to share. My friends have started coming here, too. And they are starting to give me homework -- try the dirty chai, try the tortilla soup -- because they like it that much!

Edited to add: the staff here is great. Always welcoming. I once spilled my order on the floor -- it was entirely my fault -- and they replaced it with smiles the moment they realized what happened.

Would give it a solid three but the drink was soooo good I will throw another star on. I don't see paying $12 something (with tip) everyday for this but I really think it's a good value. I have juicers and Vitamix at home so when I'm lazy I'll walk here.

Service was friendlier to a regular who walked in and striked up conversation with the girls working. They responded pleasantly enough, and it was cool to watch an aloe vera drink being prepared, but the three other (non-regular?) customers were treated as I was, with the bare minimum of eye contact, conversation and service.

My drink was plopped on the counter and Blondie walked away without saying a word. I called out a bright, ""thanks!"" as I picked it up and was treated to a smirk. I added a ""have a nice day?"" for good measure, and got a reluctant, ""yeah you too.""

As I tried to decide what I was going to finally order for lunch, I was given a sample of their new watermelon cold press. I was blown away at how refreshing it tasted even though it was a little sample cup!

However, I decided on the bud & vine smoothie bowl with granola, raspberries, blackberries, and cashew vanilla sauce. All of their smoothie bowls come with the choice of 3 toppings and 1 sauce. The ingredients all tasted incredibly fresh and the fruits on top tasted amazing, but I don't think it's worth the price of $13 for a 16oz bowl. Maybe I just don't understand the high cost for organic ingredients? I would love to try more of their items since their quality is definitely up there based on the sample cold press and the smoothie bowl, but I think that it's a bit too pricey for my taste.

For parking, there's a 15 minute loading zone that you can park in for free right in front of the store if you're looking to order and dip right away. Otherwise, your best (and cheapest) bet for parking before 6PM would be to park in the meters on 6th street or Carson street for $1 an hour.",8RuySv_b1YVWVK_0mMqKOw,7,6,4,DHttBA8IRnSQB86OI_fRvw

I've tried the Dirty Chai and Tropical Basil whole food juices and loved them both. I really like the blended coffee beans in the Dirty Chai for a healthy boost of caffeine. After trying the warm cashew broccoli cheeze soup, I know I have to try the rest of the soups, which are blended fresh to order. Recently, I ordered the Bud and Vine smoothie bowl, which was a very satisfying and delicious meal with the flavors of berries and lavender. I requested fresh raspberries, blueberries, granola, and a drizzle of vanilla cashew cream as toppings. The crunchy granola included whole roasted cashews and goji berries. If I had a whole bag of that stuff, I would not be able to put it down. It's unbelievably good.

Owners Shane and Nichole are very passionate and knowledgeable; not only do they run an awesome juice bar, they do a lot in the community, such as participating in downtown's annual Gobble Gobble Give and visiting schools to educate kids about healthy eating. Grass Roots is a made to order juice bar with no indoor seating, but there is a nice courtyard with some tables. This outdoor space is shared with O Face and Carson Kitchen and smells like delicious fried dough at times, but it doesn't make me crave doughnuts when I'm enjoying a Grass Roots smoothie. Sometimes I order both and you will see other people doing the same.

We ordered the soup. Made fresh to order right in the blender... It was amazing. Definitely give it a go for a light snack on a cold afternoon. 

Service was okay. Took a little while but... When everything is fresh... It's to be expected. It was around $40 plus tip for two smoothies with protein and a small bowl of soup. Was it worth the 40$?

I know when I come here for business I'm going to look for the best food I can get because the Strip doesn't offer much in my opinion. Plus I love to look for local businesses offering fresh, flavorful, and, if possible, locally grown food.
Grass Roots Offers All 3 And More!
Between Seth(sorry if I have that wrong. It's the name I heard when you were ringing me up) and Chancey(sp) giving me small tastes of juices she was making before mine was ready, I had a fun experience at this New JuiceBar on the corner of Carson and 6th. It's small so keep your eyes open for the glass door with the Grass Roots logo. 
Part of the fun was I intercepted someone else's order. I was standing at the pick up spot cooling off after a 4 mile run - yes, I'm a little crazy to be running from the strip in 92° heat at 7:30 in the morning but I will do that for a great food(juice) experience - so I grabbed the Ginger In The Grass that Chancey handed me(Great green juice, btw. Buy this one if you want to get Your Green fix) and thought she was being nice giving me a cool drink until I order. No, it was for the guy standing beside me. Sorry brotha. 
I downed that drink pretty fast and ordered up a Matchaccino. Another great one for a pick me up with green Matcha tea, coffee beans, almond milk or coconut milk, if you prefer and some other amazing goodness. It's thicker so I felt like I had a great, healthy meal in a 24 oz cup. 
All in all, I very highly recommend Grass Roots for the juice recipes, fresh, local produce and great, friendly customer service. It's given me another reason to come to Vegas.

It makes it so easy to find something you love and they make sure you love your drink before you leave.

I couldn't find something I really loved, so one of the baristas asked me what it was I liked. I said I wanted a juice with beets and ginger since I needed that boost on this day. She suggested the Beetaccino (Beets, raspberries, blueberries, dates, curly kale, purple cabbage, avocado, lemon, vanilla, and coconut oil), mentioning that it could be fully-customized. Since I didn't want caffeine, we removed the coffee beans and added fresh ginger. I don't remember why, but we also added housemade coconut milk. Also, originally, I didn't want the dates, but after tasting the finished product, it needed the sweetness, so she added it back in. After everything, the juice was exactly what I wanted and delicious!

I also sampled the Bud and Vine (Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, sage, micro greens, spinach, avocado, dates, and lavender flowers), yum!

I asked for a Bud and Vine. I didn't realize it was both a smoothie and a bowl so I just asked for it thinking I would get the bowl version but the employee just assumed I wanted the smoothie so I got that instead. The girl making the smoothie said she would dump it out and put the granola and fruit on top to make the bowl but she said the smoothie and bowl are made from different ingredients so it wouldn't taste the same. It was nice of her to offer but I declined since it wouldn't be the same. The smoothie was really good but I was kind of disappointed since I really wanted the bowl.

Ever been to a juice bar that doesn't have a juicer?  You have now.  Their ""juice"" consists of throwing the ingredients in a blender.  You know, like a smoothie.  

They make smoothies with ingredients that consist of mostly liquid, like watermelon and grapes, and call it juice.  When you ask about it, they give you an explanation that consists of telling you how it is better because you get all the nutrients from the skin and pulp.  If I wanted all of that, I would order a smoothie, because that is a smoothie.  I ordered juice, because I wanted juice.

5120244,2015-12-30,0,C7X8VCpbBwTP2lFR354EIA,"I was looking forward to loving this place, I LOVE green smoothies, organic juices, and healthy foodie options. My friends and colleagues in the DTLV & tech community have raved about the good experiences they've had here. I was really really really looking forward to this place and I'm all about supporting local small businesses. My foodie friend and I drove all the way from Anthem (Henderson) to try this. At least a 30 minute drive. 

Sadly, I was disappointed. I have made my own smoothies and juices at home for years and I was disappointed with what I tried here. Service was great, staff was friendly but not informative. I wanted to try the smoothie bowls, that was what we drove across town for, but it wasn't available. They didn't have the ingredients in store. 

Okay, no problem. There were a few smoothies I wanted to try because of the ingredients they use. I asked for my second, third, fourth choice. Sadly, those weren't available either. All the ones I wanted to try were not available. Or rather they couldn't make it because they didn't have all the ingredients but informed me that the fruits are on they're way there. They didn't have an estimated time when they would arrive either. Ugh, come on now. Throw me a bone! And we got there in the afternoon. 

So....... I settled with the Tropical Basil ($8). I didn't really want it, but I wanted to try something here. Sadly, I was disappointed again. I felt so confused and disappointed I didn't realize that the Tropical Basil is suppose to be a juice, not a smoothie. I had a sip before I left, and it tasted alright. I tipped them a few bucks and left. After looking at the menu again, I realized the Tropical Basil is a juice. Or it should be. The drink I had was thick, more of a grainy smoothie with chunks. I'm surprised because even with Vitamix, this should have been smoother. 

My friend had the Dirty Chai ($10) she was disappointed as well, and yes, we both complained about it being chunky and grainy and not worth the $10+ tip.

They were also at the Yelp event Redline Rendevous in October, but yet again it didn't make up for my previous experience. I had a sample of their popular green smoothie, I think it was Holy Grail of Greens and a healthy truffle. The truffle was flavorless and the smoothie, well I could have made something better. 

I am so sorry, I really don't want to give a 2 star, but yes ""meh. I've experienced better."" I don't want this review to seem like I hate this place or discourage other yelpers from trying this place, I advise you to try it for yourself. I'm not saying I won't try this place again, but I don't know if I would drive all the way from Henderson, pay for parking, and go out of my way to try this place again. I hate to say it but just writing this makes me feel disappointed and let down.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,6,0,2,BW53BRvI-dshQgiEsn-yYA

I'm so happy they're doing something positive with the John E. Carson building. A little concerned with how they're able to offer fresh cold-pressed juice on the go, home made ice cream, smoothies, AND soups in such a limited space, but I have absolute faith in them. 

I got to meet Shane & Nichole (owners). It's nice to be around people who are passionate about what they do on top of being absolutely knowledgeable as well. They pass that same energy down to their employees, which makes me excited and confident to be a customer there. Especially since all their ingredients are organic and mostly sourced locally.

Shane made me the Dirty Chai smoothie out of the most obscure ingredients. I was definitely unconfident of how the beverage would turn out as I watched him toss things like cabbage, ginger, pumpkin, coffee beans, and wheatgrass among a bevy of other ingredients into the VitaMix. However, all my concerns were demolished once I took my first sip. My first thoughts were, ""WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS?!"" Immediately followed by, ""Must. Have. More."" Needless to say, that smoothie was inhaled swiftly without remorse. 

My only gripe with this place is how far they are from my home, and how early they close. Being a night owl is not conducive to my need for delicious & healthy items that I have to drive across town for before 3pm. BUT... That won't stop me from trying!",f55TOSjgytP_yBKYarBwog,5,3,5,xbKpIovQaITOCJNoB8CYcg

So if you haven't had a chance to visit this juice bar in downtown Las Vegas yet, this week is your last opportunity to do so! I've always wanted to try out a healthy smoothie from Grassroots, and my co-worker finally made it happen when she made the executive decision to get some juices delivered to us via Postmates last week.

MINT CAPIGREENO ($9.95): I called the shop for advice on what to order because I was overwhelmed with options. A friendly employee advised me to get the Mint Capigreeno since I'm a fan of mint chocolate chip ice cream. This caffeinated beverage has cacao nibs, mint leaves, and avocado to name a few ingredients. It was smooth and refreshing. 4/5

5688678,2014-08-09,2,C7X8VCpbBwTP2lFR354EIA,"About f-ing time DownTown got a real juice spot! I have been waiting for one of these for years. A couple have popped up here and there DT but didn't quite mimic what I wanted. I wanted something more like Greens and Proteins with a mix of Whole Foods and I got it. 

Pros: 
- From what I understand, everything is organic. And they have an array of vegetables/mixtures/and fruits...like yellow watermelon? Damn good.
- The juice and smoothies have a right blend of enough greens but not too much to taste like grass and not too much fruit where you start wondering how could this be healthy. The perfect balance.
- Unlike some of the other posters I actually had a great customer service experience my first time. A blonde woman helped me pick my order, let me try a couple of samples, and was actually another reason why I came back. However, on my fourth or fifth visit, there was an older brown haired lady who was a little sassy and I don't mean fun sassy like Blanche from Golden Girls, but just sassy.


Cons: 
- Closes early and not open when I need it the most aka drunk and want to be healthy.
- It's tiny in there, so if more than five people are waiting for juice, be prepared to wait outside or in the building where you can chat up random people from different shops like bikram yoga.
- It's still downtown so I've had a couple bums ask me to buy them a juice. Not really a con it was just random, I've had a bum ask for cigarettes, money, and alcohol but never a juice.

5872889,2014-07-01,2,C7X8VCpbBwTP2lFR354EIA,"Where a similarly located John E. Carson shop insists on too much filling to cover a lack of basic flavor structuring, Grass Roots is entirely the opposite. Each juice starts with the basics that will give you an appealing color, a pleasant texture, and for all its complexity, you'll have no idea just how many greens and other healthy things are blended into your cup. Basically, your juice will be sweet and tangy and smooth all over. And yet there is SO much STUFF in the juices, smoothies, and soups that you can order off the menu, or you can work with the juicers to craft something all your own. It's certainly more magical to watch Shane Stuart and his team concoct colorful juices with your taste buds in mind than it is to select a few veggies for a ""build-your own"" sandwich. 

Of all the places I will miss in Vegas when I move east soon, newcomer Grass Roots is certainly in the top three. Even more than my work friends who inevitably end up here after nearly every team meeting, I am viciously jealous of children in Las Vegas who have Grass Roots juices to look forward to after braces-tightenings. As young teens, my brother and I shared those torturous braces years. Our mother, fretting that her growing children couldn't get nearly enough nutrients for the week or more following a painful tightening, kept weird-tasting, canned nutrition drinks on hand at all times. I remember surviving, barely, on those for a week or two at a time. It certainly helps that Shane can hide kale, cabbage, and just about any other green or veggie in the drinks and you'd be none the wiser. Seriously, kids with braces, I hate you so much right now. No matter that I am freakin' lovin' my juice right now.

But as an adult, there are other times when juices and smoothies are a solution to the inability to eat solids. Grief from a loss, and other additive stresses has lately warped my ability to feel hungry or very much interest in eating. Food, especially anything I would cook myself, simply hasn't appealed to me. However, where solids aren't enticing, Grass Roots is not only helping me put something meaningful into my body, but I'm actually recharged and calmer after a Mint Capigreeno or a Ginger in the Grass. As I treat my body well, my mind finds more normality too. While enjoying the wait for my juice, I've met some others who have similarly found that where sadness or stress has eliminated their desire to eat solid foods, Grass Roots is doing more than feeding them; it's helping to heal them. 

The wonderful community that presses into the popular, small juice bar at all times of the day is a great addition to the therapy as well.  Everyone wants to know what's hidden in your juice, and you KNOW you're equally as curious. Go ahead, ask them. They want to tell you, and they're going to give you such a long list that by the time they finish, and you're listing out what is in your cup, you'll be fast friends. 

Don't forget to tip your concocters.",KXRcHZxGuNH1kzeROaZYWw,5,4,5,41wqkuDJtM6IJRO5XNWQVQ
