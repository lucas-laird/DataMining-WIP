I ordered mozzarella sticks and a stromboli (pepperoni, sausage, garlic).
The sticks were completely bland and unseasoned, and the stromboli simply had some oregano on top.  There was nothing unique or seasoned about the meat or bread.  Fortunately the meat sauce was okay, so that helped me get some food down, but I only ate half of my food before quitting.

I wouldn't return to this place, even if i was in a bind.  I'd just get some frozen pizzas from the store.

Oh and the price is even better!",fVXc4oAkV1QL6kCX5XnsZA,0,0,5,lN0JuTkE4ZE3OqXo6_VvMA
2217135,2012-03-26,1,CR2DMfg3uP02PKT_fuygIw,"Many of the reviews for Lefty's say it's the best pizza in Vegas, or at least in the top five.  If that's the case, I may have to move back east.  I understand that being on the west coast, it's going to be hard to find east coast pizza.  I lowered my expectations, and I picked Lefty's based on the reviews on Yelp.  What a mistake that was.

I'm going to start off with my review of the food.  The rest of the experience was not great either, but some of that was simple mis-communication and has no bearing on the actual food.

To start, we ordered two pizzas.  We got a plain pie and a mushroom/sausage pie.  We ordered mediums, thinking that we should have more than enough food for two of us.  The menu says that the medium pizza is 14"".  Our pizzas were not 14"".  They arrived in comically small boxes that I have seen for personal pies or for single slice take out.  I remined hopeful, however, that the pizza within was big on taste.

The pizza within was not big on anything.  It was flat with a very stiff and bland crust.  Good pizza crust has a bite and then a spongy texture on the inside.  This was more like the texture of a garlic knot.  It was heavy and doughy.  The cheese was greasy.  The sauce was ok, but nothing to save the rest of the pizza debacle.

All told this was not the pizza i expected based on the Yelp reviews.  I dont know where some of you got your pizza from on the east coast, but if this is what it was like, you are getting lied to.  My Las Vegas pizza search will continue elsewhere.

Now, on to the other factors that contributed to my 2-star score.  My house is about 2 miles from Lefty's.  At the time of night we ordered, this pizza should have been at my door in 30 minutes or less.  After 90 minutes we had to call and find out where our pizza was.  Turns out that the driver couldn't find the street (new neighborhood that isn't in their map yet).  To make matters worse, the person who took our order never took our phone number so they were unable to call us and ask for directions.

To top it all off, there is a delivery charge.  We ended up paying $2 to have a driver come 2 miles and deliver us luke-warm pizza about an hour later than we expected it.  I know that gas is expensive, but if I am paying for you to deliver me food, you better get it right and get it to me fast.

To Lefty's credit, they did recognize that this was their fault and they offered me two free pizzas.  If their system for keeping track of store credit is as good as their system of taking down delivery addresses, I dont expect to see those free pizzas anytime soon.  Of course, based on the pizzas I got last night, I may not want to...",IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw,5,0,2,jzgC-9OdvAeRpgB-TKgD1Q

We ordered the Romano pizza, it's described ""With fresh garlic, grated romano cheese and oregano""  Sounds great right?  Well what we received is a cold pizza with a ""cheese"" crust.  The cheese was the parmesan that comes in a shaker off the shelf.  It was inedible.  We ordered meatball topping.  The meatball had zero taste.  I'm not sure what the meatballs were.  The sauce has zero flavor.  It was very dry, we tried putting olive oil on it, didn't help.  Usually I can stomach any pizza, but we wasted our money on that one, we both ate half a slice, threw the rest away.  
We also ordered the pizza fries.  Again, the sauce must be the cheapest they can get, it has no flavor, ketchup would be better.  Again inedible.  
We tried the zeppolis, and thank god I ordered 12 because that was our dinner.  Luckily they couldn't mess up fried dough with sugar.

I've been living in this area for two years and I am sad I didn't discover this place sooner. I've tried ever pizza place in this are and lefty's blows them all out of the water. The crust is the perfect density as is the ratio of sauce to cheese/toppings. We had cheese with pepperoni and jalapeño which might be my new flavor combo. Plain cheese is great as well.,SVH0qJBvYGLxrt6YuUdyyw,0,1,5,PQVH6WhjvyqCysUmct7XQQ

My first clue to go elsewhere should have been when I asked for a sicilian pizza and was told that they ""were out of that size crust."" Really? You can't just make a crust?

I ordered 2 other pizzas of different sizes and picked them up for carryout. The guys at the counter were polite and courteous. 

The pizza itself was okay. Better than the major chains (which isn't hard), but nothing to write home about.",KV8YcH0JBaynbC1M-RM4PQ,0,0,3,eOoeA8kpx12ncd6TQFvnGg

First off my order was late, when I called to check on the order, they couldn't even find my ticket and he had to ask everyone else if my order went out yet.....the pizza was soggy, not like your typical NY pizza which is greasy, this was soggy and the taste was not good at all....I've had much better pizza in town.  

I even tried the pizza again a second time as left overs are always good and still nope not good at all.  The crust has no taste to it, the pizza itself did not even taste like regular pizza...I don't know if it's the sauce or the meat they use, I'm just not sure but almost all of a XXL pizza went to the trash. 

I even had friends over and they did not like they way the pizza tasted, so it was just not my opinion.  I asked if they wanted to take some home and they said nope, just throw it away....that was a waste of $35...

The good news is I guess, is it's a lesson learned and I will not order from this place again.  It's sad as I was so hopeful for a good meal and this was not it.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,8,2,2,EuxvAyGLRNfqawlrNBYiGw

Order the Baby Ruth pizza, medium for two who like a slice at dawn, large if others are hungry too.  Call it in, come 20 minutes later, and you will love this pizza.  They make their own sauce, dough, the toppings are generous and as fresh as you are going to find in Vegas.  We order it at least once a month, it has never wavered or changed, it is always done perfectly.  Lots of green pepper strips, onions, sausage that is WOW, pepperoni, generous cheese, what else you want?  Old school oven, no hairdryer pizza at Lefty's.
