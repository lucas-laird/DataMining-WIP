Love their garlic knots, greek salad, and pizzas (cheese w/ ricotta & basil is our standby).  They also have calzones and stromboli.  Good cannolis- thick cream with cinnamon and chocolate chips, filled to order in their homemade shells.  Spumoni ice cream for sale by the tub.

The reason they are getting 3 stars is because of their creepy delivery guy with the tattoos on his arm that looks like a convict. He always makes comments when he comes to my house such as ""where is your old man tonight"" or has brought me free sprite even though I didn't order. So I started to do pick up only because I didn't want him at my house if I was alone. One day I walked in and placed my order and had told the guy behind the counter about how uncomfortable I was and he told me that the delivery driver I was speaking of would not be working their much longer and I could order deliver again soon. Low and behold when I was waiting for my order the creepy delivery driver walks in and says ""is my delivery too slow for you"" and makes me feel completely uncomfortable. I no longer order from there unless my husband is home because he has shown up a few times now and I refuse to answer the door. We order from other places which is a shame because we do like their food.",9WCgoi4rHTAowPHwuwk5tA,0,0,3,gYMvNq0ARLdXonZowChuBA

361729,2015-06-24,0,oH6QAuoTLFaX97oqqpLTMg,"This is a gem of a location for authentic NY Style Pizza. A little hard to find because it's hidden behind Bomas. If you don't like the pizza from here, maybe a Chicago Style Pizza or heaven forbid a Dominos Style Pizza is more to your liking. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I can provide a review for what I have tried. I love pepperoni pizza. When comparing pizza from one business to another, pepperoni pizza is my litmus test. The crust is the traditional thin crust. It's cooked in an authentic brick lined pizza oven that produces a crust that is slightly doughy on the top yet crusty enough on the bottom to be compared to a cracker. The sauce is extremely flavorful that balances the sweetness of fresh ripen tomatoes with just the right amount of zestiness. The mozzarella cheese and pepperoni are the finest quality. 

I've also had the pleasure of having there canolli. Originally, it was lacking in chocolate chips. Now it does have it. If you like the chips, you're welcome, or maybe they were just out that day. Now if I could only get them to put ground pistachio nuts on the ends it would be perfect. Just like the Italian bakery around the corner from where I grew up. 

The prices are also amazing. They have Specials that compete with the chain joints, but are infinitely better because they are coupled with a premium pizza. My favorite is the 18 inch (that's right not 16) one topping pizza with one dozen chicken wings with hot sauce (my favorite of the handful they offer) and ranch dressing for $19.99. Can you dig it.",KqbowpYkOxkpFNuEd-rTnw,1,1,5,3hsUtlHs_U1sSwllfHDA1w

Went inside and it is small. 3 four tops and a 6 top, but it was clean. My wife said she thought it would be a little ""nicer"", I thought it was great! Old school, like back east. Restroom was clean and maintaned. On to the food:

You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. Self serve 20oz styro cup fountain service, $1.35, 8 flavors Coke products, iced tea sweet or plain.We ordered:
   Lg dinner salad, $5.95. Very big, romaine, tomatoes, onions, black olives, banana peppers, pepperocinis. Each of us had two servings! They serve on paper plates. Cool!
   Lg (16"") cheese pizza, the deal was 2 cheese for 17.99, we added pepperoni, 2.00 extra each pizza. Not bad. Pizza was crispy on the bottom, crust was chewy, plenty of toppings and sauce. Really good pizza, worth the money. Took more home than we ate, 'cuz too much salad before.
    Staff was very nice, we asked for an extra container of creamy Italian dressing (yes, one of the few places that have it). When the guy brought it over, he said ""It's on the house, it's Father Day"" What a nice dude! I complimented the mgr as we left. I wanted them to know they were doing it right.

The Subs I ordered where a Philly Cheese Steak, Veal Parm, and Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions. All 3 were a decent size with meat falling over the edges. The Philly Cheese was AMAZING. My wife never had one before and wanted to finish it herself after a couple bites. (we split all 3 among the family) The veal parm was very tasty and not dry like some can be. And the Italian Sausage had a good mix of red sauce.

They catered several events I had at my house.  We loved the food.  The staff were always wonderful.  Guests frequently requested them.    I don't know what happened, it started with the service going downhill for several months, but we still used them since the food is great and a guest favorite. Delivery times got longer and longer.   This weekend did it for me- I was made to feel like I was a nuisance and a jerk for simply trying to place an order for 10 people- a full day ahead of time no less.  The restaurant discontinued catering apparently (even though as of this weekend it was still on their website).  I had called on Friday in advance of a catering order for Sunday delivery (we are talking a half tray of lasagna,  pizzas, chicken fingers, salad and knots to feed 10 people, about a $300 order).  On Friday I was told that they no longer do catering (trays of things).  I said no problem, we will just order individual meals and I was told ""if that's what you really want to do""  call the next day and speak to the now ex-catering manager, whom I believe is the owners son.  He was incredibly rude.  I told him i was going to be ordering for delivery the next day for a group of ten (read: spending alot of money with your business).    The first thing i wanted was five orders of lasagna (on their menu, mind you, as an individual option) and he cut me off and said "" I can't accomodate that.""  Dead silence. No other suggestions.   Umm, Ok, ""well what can you do?""  ""I only have 3 orders right now.""  ""OK may we have those three.""  ""NO. they will be gone by tomorrow. look, we are a small business and we can't afford to keep alot of ingredients around like that.""   I'm sorry, aren't you a restaurant?  this isn't catering a wedding.  It's an order for ten people called in two days before, and again the day before. The tone was angry, hostile, and annoyed.  At that point I tried to explain how much we loved them, had ordered from them for years,  this was a big deal, could they maybe set any of those three orders aside for us.... NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.  Total jerk, could care less.  Made it very clear they don't want or need our business anymore.  WISH GRANTED.",8P9tanfLFfBvt4uxplSwHQ,1,0,1,gdQMkbZhTbtUBlxKL3emxw

I used to think Rocco's Italian Deli was the best place but Familia gives Rocco's a run for their money.  It's also a lot closer to home so I'll definately be visiting Familia more often.

We ordered the Pepperoni and Familia Special.  Both pizzas were awesome.  Lots of cheese but not too much.  Sauce was right on.  But the best part was the crust...thin crust but not too doughy.  

We also ordered the chicken wings..bbq style.  It was ok, I've had better at places like Yard House.  But, the Cheesecake was out of this world.  Not too dense, but rich and creamy with a graham cracker crust. 

They offer a wide menu and I wish they would have more sandwiches like Rocco's does.  But all in all, a great pizza joint.  Delivery time was exactly as they said and not a minute over.  I will definately be back",XYy7o-sRCJ9_XqzACDk7iw,0,0,5,HDrDBVMN9RhQITaPij1SSg

It loses a star due to a lack of originality in the pizza.  However the thin crust is done very well and has a nice texture.  It loses a second star for not offering some healthier options on the side.  You are going to get pizza and fried, fried, and more fried food.

saw the place mentioned in a pizza thread a few months ago - i think Matthew gave the place props so i opted to try it  i'm glad i did.

I've tried:

 the 10"" mini-pizza with soda special ( $7 ) ;
The two slice with soda special ( i believe it was $6 ) ;
Large Sausage pizza ( i believe it cost $14) 

I'm a fan !  The crust has that crispy yet, chewy texture that works for me.  The sauce needs a little more ""zing"" to it but that's a personal preference not really a ding on the pizza itself.

Good service.  and conveniently located for me.  I probably give ciao ciao a slight edge on flavor, but not on convenience and cost.

Anyway, I Googled pizza by the slice in my area and was surprised with this little gem. I went immediately. Knowing what to look for since I'd worked at a pizza by the slice shop when I was in college, I knew I was in a good place. They had the already, sliced pizzas under glass, ready to be reheated with your choice of topping. Slices were $2 and .50 cents for each topping, I think. Either way, it was reasonable. The crust was legendary, New York style, thin. My toppings were pepperoni and sausage. Truly amazing. I had 2 slices and a drink and was on my way. The guy at the counter was courteous, conversational, and clean. I was so impressed, I went back for 2 more slices for dinner. Only drawback, and it's really not a drawback, is that they closed at 9pm because it is Sunday. They close at 11pm the rest of the week. That's just poor planning on my part. I showed up at 850pm. I didn't want to mess up a table or their closing activities so I got my order to go. Going back tomorrow, for lunch. Going to try the garlic knots, possibly the chicken fingers.

I'm not too meticulous about whether it resembles NY pizza but the pizza is large and tasty. On top of my pizza, I ordered a meat lovers calzone without sausage. Well, I think I did?

Upon unwrapping my calzone I noticed that there was no meat whatsoever. So I called to ask to see why I didn't get my proper fix. Turns out that the calzone is only cheese and nothing else basically holding the responsibility of knowing that on my end. So why wasnt I told this in the first place? If you had at least told me, I wouldn't have expected it. But I specifically said over the phone that I want a meat lovers calzone with no sausage. And the employee just said ""ok"" which confirms that the order is fine.

And now I am taking a bite out of their crispy chicken finger coated in medium buffalo sauce and blue cheese....sooo yummy. I don't care if my keyboard gets dirty from my greasy fingers!

This is not the first time I've had their pizza (I order a delivery every month or so) but this IS the first time I'm actually writing a review for yelp. Not sure exactly why I decided that Familia would be the one because I've been eating here and other super yummy places for months now and have just been too lazy to review, lol...

...maybe it's because I'm really missing NY right now and this is the ONLY place in Las Vegas that serves an authentic NY-style pizza...crust has that perfect balance of crisp and chewy, the sauce is very flavorful and they put just the right amount on the pie (I hate pizza that's oversauced and soggy), the cheese is the way it's supposed to be...nice and melty with just enough stretch when you pull it away...DELISH.

And yes the pepperoni pizza is oily but cmon, it's pepperoni! The best pizzas are the ones that take up 5 napkins to soak up the excess oil. 

Other Menu Items:
- I usually just get plain or pepperoni so not sure what their specialty pizzas are like but they do sound delicious. 
- Chicken fingers (sauce on the side so it stays crispy) over their wings...fingers are better than a lot of other places
- Their house salad is huge with large chunks of lettuce, tomatoes, slices of pepperoncinis, . I usually get the Greek dressing 
- The zeppoles are AWESOME but you definitely have to eat them while they're hot....I tried to eat one the next day and almost broke a tooth hahahaha (what?? they're really good!)
- I recently just tried their Classic Gyro and it's actually pretty decent. I've had better elsewhere but I would order this again. It had a lot more lettuce than other gyros which I liked and the tomatoes were thin slices instead of chunks which I also liked. 
- I've tried the cannolis once and it was really good but I'm the only one who likes them at my house and I can never finish a whole one by myself, lol so never got to order it again

They have some really great anytime and lunch specials also.
This is seriously the only pizza place I go to since discovering it a year ago. Every time I get that craving for some NY pizza, I call and order...and then get nervous that I'll be disappointed but I never am!! Love this place =)",GxB_VQ8GaffGnXiUfQubHA,3,2,5,U_GE0BjMkQNKxGJbj3U0Ig

I didn't try the garlic knots, which I regret, but I do plan to return and give them a shot. They do serve pizza by the slice, which requires you to choose toppings. I generally grab the standard ""veggie"" slice, but without that crutch, ordered a slice with peppers and spinach. It was a good decision--the pizza was pretty good, not too greasy. The rest of my party ordered sandwiches. 

I will note that the restaurant was pretty warm--not sure if this is due to the constant baking of pizza or the weather in general, but for someone not immune to high temperatures, it may be uncomfortable.

The pizza is dreaming amazing the slices are huge and the pepperoni was home made I think or sliced on house at least. The pie is thin and when you pick up each slice you kindda have to fold it because it's a little heavy per slice and had the perfect grease to cheese to dough to everything ratio. The wings were meaty and yummy. So the food is great I haven't tried any of their pasta yet but will because I've been here like 5 times now in one month.

It had your East Coast hole-in-the-wall ""feeling"" with it's size, lack of detail in the decor, but I'm going to be completely honest when I say the guy making the pizza with the tattoos on his neck and the Asian guy working the register really threw me off... Needless to say, I had my doubts. 

$19.99- We got a 1-topping LARGE pizza, garlic knots, and a liter of soda.. great deal! 

I know, I know, get to the point already, how was the food, right? 

DELICIOUS!!! The crust was east-coast thin and crispy, sauce or ""gravy"" as we Italians call it, was shockingly fantastic (not too sweet, not undercooked), my only ""eh"" moment was the cheese. Trust me when I say the cheese was not a factor when it came to devouring the pie and knots. 

Let's see, it's 5:27pm the following day and.....yep, I still can taste a slight hint of garlic in my mouth resonating from last night. (Mind you this is 3 tooth brushes, 2 mouth washes, and 2 meals later) 

I happen to LOVE garlic so this is not a problem for me, but if you are not in the market to ward off vampires for 2 days, pass on the garlic knots ;)

-kids plate of spaghetti and meatballs with an extra meatball for $.75. Their sauce is on the sour side, which is not our thing. Their meatballs weren't bad... My kids ate them and they're pretty picky.
-zepettos? Powdered dough balls. These were aight... It's a sweet bread with powdered sugar. Can't go wrong there.
-fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken and mushrooms. This needs help. It was dry, had no flavor... Kinda like thick milk with Parmesan sprinkles. You def have to add salt. the grilled chicken which was an extra $2 was dry and only came with a handful of chicken pieces.

By the way, I love their pizza & fingers deal (we get 2 toppings on our pizza and it comes out to $22 after tax).

First, any ""real"" NY style pizza place will always blow away that fast food crap pizza. That's a given. The problem though, is most of these NY pizza places are just clones of one another.

Don't get me wrong, the pizza here was pretty good. Comparable to most local NY style places, and 100x better than fast food pizza. However it didn't stand above the rest. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and an order of chicken fingers based off of another Yelpers review. The pizza was great, however I wasn't a fan of the cross cut pepperoni. No this is going to sound weird, but the chicken fingers were too large for my liking. It was almost like breaded chicken breasts instead of manageable chicken strips or ""fingers"". Most people will say ""but thats a better value dummy!"" Sure, you probably get more chicken for the money, but the are supposed to be chicken fingers, not deep fried chicken breasts. The taste was good, the spice was good. Breading was a little soggy, possibly due to the massive chicken chunks.

In the end if you live close to this location GO THERE! Especially if you are thinking about fast food pizza. This place is much better. However if you don't live close to them, chances are you can find a closer NY style pizza place nearby.

The only thing I would like to see is a bigger seating area for eating-in.  That's probably not practical given the limited area in the shopping center they are located in, but other than that, this place is very good.  If they keep doing things the right way, maybe they can expand to bigger property someday.

We will definately be trying their food again, the White pizzas looked good, (I had the stromboli, which is a very good size. so there was no room left to try it this time).

Also ordered 6 garlic knots.  I've never seen them literally covered in minced garlic.  Seriously I thought it was a heavy layer of grated parmesan cheese.  Nope.  Delicious raw garlic and olive oil which is great if you're a garlic-head like me but if not, be warned.  Surplus garlicy olive oil got poured on the pizza.  Oh and also the knots come with a good-sized side of marinara (and there was extra of that for dumping on pizza too!)

Finally, surprise-surprise, the canolli's were great.   I really didn't expect much as even at a good pizza place in NY the canollis are 50/50 at best.  But here the shell was crisp, crunchy, and almost light.

I can't tell you how many pizza places I've tried before I happened in here one night. And I am SO glad that I did. I figured I'd leave disappointed - like usual - but holy shit.

This pizza reminds me of the place that I used to go to around the block from my house in New York. It's literally perfect New York pizza. I am SO thankful that I found this place, because I couldn't stomach choking down another slice from another stupid NY pizza knockoff place.

I mean it, no other pizza place in Las Vegas will have my business from now on.

This could get 5 stars. This is a solid 4 for me. What would make this better? 2 things.
1. I dont like canned sliced mushrooms. I dont think they go on anything, let alone a pretty good pizza. Can the canned mushrooms please!
2. Better sauce. It's not bad, and I'd rather have it taste the way it does, than a gross sauce. It's just....bland. I prefer a sweeter sauce.

The dough was very good. Crusty and doughy and chewy at the same time. All in a good way. It isnt a thick cut crust, but not think either. Just right in between, and I loved it!

I called my order in, and a few things worth noting. I was able to pay cash and not give any personal credit card info, they were able to break a $100 bill, and the best part......they delivered 10 minutes EARLY! How cool is that.

I ordered 1 Slice of Cheese, 1 Slice of Pepperoni, and 1 Slice of Sicilian Cheese.  All three came out hot and fresh.

NY Style Cheese - This was the best of the 3 slices.  The crust was cooked perfectly and the Cheese & Sauce proportions were perfect.

NY Style Pepperoni - I thought the Pepperoni was undercooked for my tastes....I like it slightly burnt.  It was very oily and was beginning to get soggy.  I wouldn't recommend for delivery.  Flavor was good, not great but good.

Sicilian Cheese - The crust was a little dry for my tastes.  The edges of the crust were very hard due to the overall dryness of the dough.  It was my least favorite out of the three.

The menu had other Italian dishes that looked interesting, the Pizzaghetti Sandwich looks very enticing.

Overall, the Pizza was pretty good, but nowhere near as good as the competitor that was mentioned in the talk board.  This is where I wish there was a 1/2 Star rating system as I would give this place 3.5 Stars.  The NY Style Cheese was a 4 Star in my book, but the other 2 were 3 Stars.

If you get the 19.99 special, 1 lg tray of pizza and either 12 wings or 5 fingers, get chicken fingers instead of the wings. The chicken fingers are HUGE and meaty with no cartilage or giblets at all. They are tasty and awesome! I've eaten nothing but chicken tenders (I am as close a chicken tender/nugget connoisseur as you can get) all my life and I'd put these in my top 20. They actually are comparable to raising canes' tenders. These are meatier and thicker than Canes, just not as flavorful, but sauce can make up for that.

Their pizza is decent NY style pizza. I recommend it.",feX4HQ9YmRgd0Y-4oqvh8A,0,0,4,hyiSYEAQDnQZIDukaGXT9A

Delivery once and pick-up once.

I'm born and raised in NY and have become bi-coastal and pregnant (!!!) in the past few months.  I lived in Vegas for less than two years in the past, and I am sorry to say, the food in Las Vegas (unless we're talking about cheap Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, self-serve froyo, and kind of pricey Middle Eastern) has always depressed me.  No Jewish or Italian delis, no diners, no good Greek, no one has heard of a bialy, no good Indian, no gastropubs, no French (off-strip, that is), and no pizza!  Until now, that is...

This place was a google hit.. no joke.  Best google hit ever, that is!  It was about 10 and my little sister was starving and tired of shit local sushi.  Now, the names kind of tickle me, but whatever... we ordered a Mamma Mia-thin crust pie with tomato slices, garlic, olive oil, and mozza, a veal parm sub, and a cannoli.  Delivery time was less than 35 min... The kid on the phone was the sweetest thing ever, and he may have been the one to deliver, if not, he was just as sweet, like 16-18 y/o's.  Pie was the best pie I've had in LV, reminded me of home, I was so happy to be stuffing my preggo led zep self with a familiar thin pie with not too much cheese and a yummy bottom char... an NYC/New Haven, CT hybrid pie.  Sub was good, cannoli, ehhhh... I'm not a big cinnamon fan, but the shell was really crisp for closing time, so it was still good to me.

Second time around, pick-up was a breeze.  They're located in a totally unassuming strip mall.  They're so sweet in there, it's so nice to have your ass kissed, lol.  This time, Mamma Mia and the Margherita with some garlic... Margherita was a little bland, but still a really good pie.

I see that they've gotten some less than favorable reviews.. I can't speak for getting any kind of produce or meat on my pie, as I really don't eat anything other than tomatoes, garlic, cheese and oil on a pie, but if they use canned mushrooms, then that does suck.

If you're iso any of the things I have tried, go for it, you won't be disappointed!

Oh, and pizza by the slice!  Another east coast thing that just made me smile.

Next visit was a cheese pie and some ravioli for the kids. Hands down best sauce. Love it!  As for the pizza, finally, a crisp bottom the cracks when you fold it! That is how a slice should be!

My wife ate about half a slice and I forced 2 down-after soaking up grease with paper towels-trying not to waste it but ended up having to throw away 75% of the pizza.

The pizza is always stellar, the baked ziti flavorful and .... screw the adjectives... its just good.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Hands down it is the best pizza establishment in my area.  I would probably even call these guys over Rosati's if they were still around here.

Never again!

Placed an order online for a 90 minute delivery. When I called after 90 minutes passed, I was told that it would be another 30 minutes. I would not have ordered from there if I knew it was going to be TWO HOURS! Then while talking to the woman on the phone, she rushed me off and hung up on me. When I called back and asked for the manager she was rude again. Then when the manager came on the phone, he backed her up and made no apologies. Seriously???

We have been ordering from here for so long. After tonight.... Never again. I told them to cancel my order and now I'm waiting on the credit back to my card. 

That horrible service will not fly with me. 

Number one - your ""web confirmation"" was wrong and you should apologize for that being incorrect and then you should apologize for your rude employee. Honestly, sometimes all that is needed is an apology to correct the situation. 

If you want NY pizza than I would call Rocco's. Their pizza is better anyways.",Q7bLDV2RGKF5KJyasrwZ6A,2,0,1,NTXMIK8CvDLgu7xa-z8Y4A

Welp... There were highs and there were lows. 

LG. Meat stromboli - Large indeed. Very large. Also very, very greazzzzy. But I'd get it again maybe not the meta one though. Marinara sauce is on point. 

Eggplant pizzghetti- cut it open and to my surprise... It was chicken!#@*! The sauce was good. Dough was soggy. My kid liked the chicken. Better review next time on that. 

Greek salad - Fabulous. Delicious dressing. Quality feta. 

Kids spaghetti with meatball - Picky two year old ate it in a flash so that's a win. 

Jalapeno poppers & Garlic Romano fries - both tasted old or from old oil. The poppers were blah. Like they had Kraft American cheese in them. Pass. Fries had potential. Even old tasting they had great flavor. Garlic was fresh!

Ranch dressing - They have that good, good ranch. That keeps you coming back even if the food is lackluster.",uMh4aDyruj0Awh85lAVgIg,0,0,3,wnkjTbgNDb3w0RWVhQTtsw

Even though I have never ventured past these 2 items, I've eaten here enough to know that their food is always consistent. When I'm craving for this type of pizza (vs. a thin crust), the crispy yet chewy dough and the super cheesy pie just hits the spot. Their slices are usually pretty substantial so 2 slices is enough to get your belly full. The wings are really impressive as well for such a little eatery. They give a pretty good size order of wings and it come freshly fried and slightly crisp. I hate when wings get fried in advance and just some lukewarm sauce is thrown in when you order. Makes for some dry and unappetizing wings. Their buffalo sauce is pretty good as well. I can appreciate the way they pack the wings when ordering to go. We never finish the portion in one go, so it's nice to be able to pop the whole container (sans plastic lid) in the toaster oven and have some yummy leftovers.

Try their lunch special. 2 slices of pizza and a drink for about $5. You wont be dissapointed!",Tw3_-eahwaTZJjEsos1gpg,1,0,4,vgRxsICFIbygF0PagutO1w

We really enjoyed our pizza, but the service was NOT very nice. I called in a phone order and was put on hold for a very lengthy time, only to be talked to in a condescending manner. It was like taking my phone order was a huge inconvenience to the guy on the phone. The pizza was delivered on time by a rough hoodlum looking kid in a Mutant Ninja Turtle t-shirt with a whatever attitude, who was so rude. After handing over the pizza he seriously waited several seconds staring at us as if to imply he was due a tip. Nope! Not after the phone service and his attitude! I'm sorry, but a tip is for excellent service, it's not an obligation. 

I really hope this place talks to their employees about how their delivery of customer service is SO IMPORTANT and makes an attitude adjustment. We love ordering from and supporting local businesses. The pizza is great, but they're so much nicer over at Grimaldi's, and that's where we are happy to do business.",-95gDpECFDSjWEL1AIrkAA,4,1,1,EjLrVP3SaX2yObYR5K4cbw
