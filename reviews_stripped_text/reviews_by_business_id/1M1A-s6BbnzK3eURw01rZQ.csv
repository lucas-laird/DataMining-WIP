The baliadas, frijoles, queso, crema, everything was excellent.  The only slight disappointment was the platanos fritos - but they were still pretty good.  This place even has banana-flavored Tropical soda.  Before leaving Vegas, I had to stop at this place one last time to get some food for the road.  

I definitely recommend this place.",AWzhXtYXwq1-KtVR092iDw,1,0,5,bI7xZVOTQQUbfBu3owe46g

The reviews weren't bad, so we went for it, even tho Hubs had some major reservations upon walking in. This place is a dive no doubt about it but I'm not one to let lack of decor hinder me from a good food experience. 

The service was a bit slow for my tastes but the servers were very pleasant. Our server didn't speak very good English so I got to use my woefully dormant Spanish. The prices for the servings are quite good. We ordered a bunch of appetizer plates: shrimp empanadas - 3 to an order, chicharonnes with yucca frita, 1 asada beef pupusa, an order of tostones, and beer yet we spent less than $30 before tip. This place is obvi priced for locals not tourists. Me gusta mucho!! 

As for the food itself...
I've never had Honduran fare before so I can't speak on how authentic it was. The food was good though not outstanding. Although well-seasoned, the pork was very dry and the tostones needed some dipping sauce for flavor.",X3ZgxjhQD_Fh9DjXIbzXrA,2,0,3,Nljd7FBymWsaZdAYdiyiqA

You can never go wrong with some Salvadorian Pupusas, my favorite are the cheese Pupusas, or if you want to try some Honduran food I highly recommend the "" Pollo con tajadas"" which means Chicken with Banana Chips! It is by far one the most juiciest, tastiest, most colorful and delicious dish you will ever taste, 

It consists of chicken, of course- Fried banana chips, Covered in cabbage, red onion, and their special sauce! 

For breakfast, you can never go wrong with a Salvadorian "" Casamiento""  it's rice mixed with red beans, scrambled eggs with veggies, a side of sour cream, cheese and some fried Bananas! 

The restaurant itself is very well kept, they have Karaoke on the weekends, and a dance floor! 

The only downside is that they do take a good while to bring out your food after you order, then again all Central American restaurants are the same. Won't stop me from coming back.",vGEVwwWi-SkW_gH_-V_wRA,0,0,4,VTdHOvrUh_Xwf9cur08cmw

When we walked in, we were allowed to pick our seating and the server was quick to give us menus and offer us drinks. I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). 

I ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?

Our food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. 

Downside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....

Overall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. 

Would come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done.",YnMHlGm6XX1MtnKqiSgDIA,0,0,4,2nYMjXwjJ9txtx6cMMdhVw

2363676,2012-03-10,2,1M1A-s6BbnzK3eURw01rZQ,"Parking is limited. Weirdoes in the parking lot. Very loud. But this is the place to have a few beers, eat well and spend next to nothing.

Sometimes they seat you, but you can seat yourself. If you come at night (Thurs, Fri, Sat) you can't talk to your friends because the karaoke is loud. It's fun because they play a lot of stuff you'd recognize from the radio. They play it on a huge screen, very nice. Many children run around casually at all hours. Be ready to be patient ordering if you don't speak Spanish. Staff is kind and patient.

Complementary chips. Often times, if you devour them, they will offer more. Then they bring a slaw and red sauce in a bottle. Save it for your meal and go nuts with the sauce right on top your pupusa.

Clearly quantify your pupusas and each one's contents to the waitress. Two is enough for one person. If you don't know what to get, just get cheese. I also enjoy the corn tamal con crema (enjoy it w/one pupusa) and the chile relleno con queso (comes with salad, rice and beans). Get yourself a negra modelo. It's served in an ice-cold beer mug.

When you finish you may not get your check brought to you. Just go up to the register when you are ready. They figure it out with no explanation.

The only time I didn't enjoy my meal was the most recent time I ordered a chile relleno. It had a hard spot from I can assume was from microwaving it too high. That bummed me out. How could I love something that came from a microwave! The pupusas though couldn't possibly be microwaved. They have cheese crusties.

Based on the reviews, I had my mind made up to try any one of their pupusas. 

As I enter their nice sized restaurant, I am greeted by one of the very nice servers. ""Hola!"" she says. I just smile and make my way to one of their tables. I still have flashbacks to my Tacos El Gordo incident (refer to my review). 

So while im looking at the menu, she brings me chips with some kind of cheese and salsa on them to snack on. 

So im trying to decide which pupusas to get when out of nowhere my eye catches a picture on the menu of scrambled eggs and skirt steak. I point at it and say I want this. She smiles at me and says in a sexy Latin accent, ""Chilaquiles?"" Now whether or not she knew I didnt speak Spanish did not matter any more. I smile and say ""Si!"" 

After my meal I am thinking about making a trip to Central America because if their food is like this than sign me up for a Latin Food crawl! Of course I'm gonna need a translator because I will be too busy eating!

Service was great. I like the vibe these ladies put out. Kind of like when you are new in town and they wanna show you their hospitality. I think next time I will definitely order a pupusas or two.

After I was done at the barbershop I decided to stop in here for lunch. I had a restaurant.com voucher for 5 off so I figured might as well give them a try.  Walked in and noticed a strange smell that I couldn't quite tell what it was.  Not many people in for a weekend afternoon which I should have seen as red flag.  No wait so I hostess seated me quickly.  When I asked about the restaurant.com voucher she said they no longer accept them, red flag number 2.  I was starving by this point so I decided against my better judgement to stay. 

I order d something simple just a chicken quesadilla. When it arrived I noticed there were some aluminum foil shavings in the retried beans. Not a big deal since I didn't plan on eating them but that was red flag number 3.  My chicken quesadilla had a decent flavor but it was very greasy. Weird but I ate it anyway.  I regretted that decision later that evening.  

I did have some entertainment while dining here. There was a guy who came in and was talking loudly to himself over at the counter the entire time I was there.

3601979,2015-02-03,2,1M1A-s6BbnzK3eURw01rZQ,"I do not give out 5 stars often. I am the patron saint of 4 star reviews. This place really should be given a strong B+ or more likely a weak A-. It gets the full 5 star A because it is exceptional for its location. This is a little hole in the wall place in the corner of a dicey strip mall in a so-so part of town. To be as good as it is, and to have made it 9 years in the same location, is phenomenal. Also, they are not cheap. They are not expensive, but for the area they are located their prices are fine dining level. You can get in and out with two people for $30 if you stay away from the drinks. 

So here is why 5 stars: I had the best chili relleno I have ever had. I actually dropped an F-bomb on the first bite. When you exclaim ""Holy F..."" In polite company because the food is so good you have to give five stars. I

The food and flavor where fresh and cook throughly. The ambiance is one step above neighborhood at, but who cares. I would eat that chili relleno off the floor of the bathroom it was so good. 

My constant companion Sancheta Panza had a chicken in cream dish that was almost as good as mine. The cream was a lemon zesty sour cream source that got better with each bite. It had a uniqueness of flavor which took a few bites to get used to it and enjoy the complexity. Rarely is a meal better with the last bite than the first. 

It salute hidden gem worth a trip cross town. Don't waste your money on the drinks, they are nothing special. Besides the food is so good there is no reason to dilute the flavor. The worst part of the whole experience is that I have work next to this place for 4 years now (it's right by the University) and I finally found it. I have wasted 4 years of culinary delight.

One last note, I think it would be more fair to all this  Central American fair rather than Mexican food. One of the joys of living in Vegas ( one of the few) is the diversity of communities within communities and their ability to thrive through their own traditions. I would have ordered another meal if I wasn't so full when I got done.

The chilaquiles with steak had great flavors and was cooked perfectly. Service was very friendly and expedient. Cost of the dishes are at a great value. Had to use a translation program on the smart phone as no one in our group spoke Spanish and no one in the restaurant spoke English. The soccer game was going on, so was lots of excitement. There are lots of other dishes that look very promising and can't wait to try. If I didn't have two left feet, I would probably try dancing. The decor is a tiny bit outdated, but nothing to the point where you just want to leave in disgust. The jukebox can tend to overpower any conversation one might be trying to have.

As others have mentioned, Spanish is the language at Rincon.  My server could not understand me.  I pointed at the menu and read the Spanish for the two flavors I was ordering.  The server turned to a young man who translated for me.  Gracias #1.  After getting my diet Coke and while waiting for my pupusas, a woman at an adjoining table asked me if I really wanted one to eat there and one to take home.  When I said no, she sent her son to tell the server the error and the correction was made.  Gracias #2.

While waiting, she brought my slaw and tomato sauce.  All the while I enjoyed the complimentary chips topped with a tomato sauce and cotija cheese.  They were very good and I almost finished the basket before I left.

Soon the server brought my two pupusas--one cheese and loroco and one cheese and pork.  I heaped the slaw on top both and squeezed the tomato sauce onto these hot goodies.  They were excellent!  

Time was getting to be a factor.  I Googled menu in Spanish on my phone but by the time the server came back, rather than ask for a menu, I remembered flan and that I can say.  That's what I ordered and it was very good, too!

My server was a delightful young woman with a great smile.  My problem with her was that she was having a good time with the young guys at the next table and that was the cause for my time constraint.  I also think she had a hard time dealing with my lack of Spanish.

Next time I go, I'll do one of two things--take one of my Spanish speaking friends from Yelp or mark things down from the menu and just hand them the paper with my order, gabacho that I am.  

This place is good and I will make a return visit.  Pupusas to go to enjoy at home?  You betcha!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,4,3,esVZQpIFXiUqAZ5EEIX76w

The service is kind of slow but they're nice. I think they were having an off night because of computer errors. They forgot one of my items and left it on my receipt. They took it off after I said something but it was still annoying. The place is big. They have a big menu.

Anyways they have Central American food. I went to a sister restaurant on the north east that I actually prefer. I love Central American tamales, pupusas, and plantains! 

I got one of my favorite dishes which was fried chicken, fried plantains, slaw, and pickled onions. This is AMAZING! They serve it with a sort of mustard and the combination is just amazing.

I also had one of their pupusas which was good. The slaw on top was a good compliment.

The complimentary chips are topped with this warm sauce that is also one of my favorite parts of the meal.

They have some things to work out like ambience, better and more friendly service, and not forget  one of the items I ordered.. And I'd totally give em five stars. The service isn't unfriendly at all the entire visit was just awkward. It just wasn't anything special.

Beware of overeating though, because those complimentary chips are good but filling.

I love salpicon -- and am accustomed to it served cold -- RC's is hot, but it's good, well seasoned and their rice and beans are terrific.   I wasn't expecting such a nice slice of tomato, perfectly ripe wedge of avocado on my crunchy crispy iceberg.  The vinegar from the curtido and the hot sauce make a perfect dressing.  

Their chicken tamals are also good, moist and hand made -- mine had a tiny chicken bone that they missed when pulling the meat  (no problem) -- this one has peas and potatoes -- as my friend said who was trying it for the first time said "" ooo, it's like a chicken pot pie"" -- and she was actually, spot on.  This is Salvadorean comfort food most definitely.   The kind Mama would make, if she were from  El Salvador...

3 pupusas, curtido, the chips, a tamal, and the salpicon plate were right at $16.   

I also highly suggest wearing anything but white...because you will wear your food -- it is magnetically attracted to splattering on anything white.  Trust me -- I look like I've been shot.",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,3,1,4,gpsGG42rpL7Ay3E5BfgCww

I stopped by here on a beautiful November afternoon with two of my co-workers. I owed them lunch, and one of them had been bothering me for some pupusa action. We were heading back from the Cambridge Community Center for a quick meeting, so this was a halfway between the office and our meeting. 

The place is a whole in the wall, but it was very clean and the staff was friendly. The place was a bit larger than I had expected and what it appeared from the outside. 

We were greeted right away and sat a booth. The place was about half-full noting that it was just after the normal lunch time. We were also greeted with chips and salsa (salsa already on the chips). They were quite delicious, and could have filled up just on these. As far as the pupusas, I went with my traditional bean and cheese. They were quite large, and very delicious. A little less grease than I was used to, and the cheese was a bit creamier than other pupusas I've had around town. 
My coworkers each got various meat pupusas and were very impressed. For the 3 of us, the total was about $12. 

Our waitress did not know english, but fortunately one of my coworkers speaks spanish so we were fine. 

I will definitely stop by this place again for sure. They also had delicious looking pastries that I will want to try on my next visit.",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,5,1,4,Vx8NETPqBkGRvHgYZmgadg

In the day this place was just the same as it was when I went a few weeks ago at night. The decor has not changed, nor has the typical patrons. When I arrived my friend was already seated at a booth and there were about 3 or 4 other tables full of people. Being that it was exactly Noon when I arrived I was a little surprised the place wasn't more busy. Perhaps it's the economy (or the gas prices).

This time around my friend and I both had pupusas again. My friend ordered the zucchini and cheese (she's a vegetarian). I ordered the shrimp and cheese (yes, I had it again - it's GOOD), and the bean and cheese. Once again the food did not disappoint. For how cheap their prices are and how big and filling the pupusas are it is just a meal you cannot pass up! Everything is melted so deliciously in the pupusas and they are generous with the fillings. I never had a bite that did not have shrimp in it.

Service was a bit slow for my taste. However, the girl working was still very nice. However, I do not believe she knew much English, but hey, you're going to run into that if you want really authentic food like this. Don't worry though, just speak slowly and point at the menu, make sure you repeat things, especially if you're having the food changed in anyway that it is not described in the menu. 

Our total for our meal of 4 Pupusas and a Coke was $8.95 (plus $3 tip). That is as much as you might spend on combo meals at a fast food place and guess what? This food is a thousand times better.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,0,5,IrpvjWv03fxZl-9qhUIPfw

We had ordered a plate of plain plantains and they are very generous for $2.50. We had six large pieces of fried bananas and they were searing hot. It did not stop me from shoving them into my mouth though. Next were our our two pupusas; one cheese and squash blossoms and one cheese and beans. Both were good, but our favorite was the latter. The cheese crisps up better and compliments the creaminess of the beans well. At $1.50 a piece we were almost full. The pork tamale was the item that pushed us over. It is not something we would jump to order again. At this point we could not eat anything else.

True story - when I moved to Las Vegas 20 years ago I went to UNLV, so I lived in the area.  I used to go to the Tower records in this strip mall!  Now I am back 20 years later... Anyways I thought that was interesting.

This place is kinda dumpy inside, it was dark and a bit cluttered.  No big deal though - I was sorta expecting that.  The service was muy bueno.  Super friendly waitresses.

The food is Honduran.  They had some Mexican dishes, too.  I ordered the Honduran special dinner plate.  It was compartmentalized like a cobb salad, but of course with out the cobb salad stuff.  It had a piece of steak, 2 eggs, sour cream, cheese, plantanos, rice, avocado and beans.  It was a strange combo but I did enjoy it.  A friend ordered the flautas and said they were very delicious.  Another friend had the pupusas and said they were tasty!  

The food is moderately priced.  Great value here.

Around 9:00 they busted out some Karaoke!  Seriously.  It was all in Spanish, but it was cool.  It got crowded, too.  People there were having a good time.  They were serving beer, not sure about alcohol though.

One observation was there were almost all men here.  So, for you ladies looking to score a latin lover your chances here are through the roof at this place!!
