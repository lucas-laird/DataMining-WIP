The decor isn't that important, service should be adequate, it should be clean and a have a working restroom which FB did not have. So I have to give Farm Basket 2 stars. We had chicken fingers, farm fries, regular fries, coleslaw, potato salad and fried chicken. The farm fries were the highight because how can you go wrong with gravy over fries. The rest of the food was average to below. The chicken fingers were, well I've had better frozen from the supermarket. The regular fries were crispy but greasy, time for an oil change maybe. The fried chicken was okay but nothing special. The sides were also okay but not worth the drive. A couple of pluses was the service was quick even on a busy Friday night and he staff was very friendly.

FB is a unique but very delicious fast food shop that specalizes in chicken and turkey items. Best on their menu is the Great Gobbler sandwich, a deep fried half turkey breast sandwich with Miracle Whip.There's something so great about this! Perhaps that it's cooked to order and fresh helps. It could also be their delish fries (if they are cooked in turkey fat/oil it explains ALOT of why they are so great) that are served with a Lawry's seasoning salt. Simple, but oh-so good.

For me, it's on the other side town, but when i'm in the area, I have to get some. When this one closes, it will be a very sad day for me.",DwS5fvL_BR1-uUaafGTkOQ,3,1,4,XJL_qH8pNorw9eU3OxWTZQ

A couple of months ago, I was driving down that stretch of West Charleston near Jones, and saw the Farm Basket sign.  (I thought they had gone out of business.)  Still around, still that one small building, and, surprisingly, the same very good chicken.  Of course, in the interest of nostalgia, I had to order more cluck-e-tos ... still as good as I remember then.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the roll.  It's a huge thing, which in itself is not bad, but they drizzle it with some kind of sweet syrup, which is not what I want when I want bread with my chicken.  Otherwise ... yeah, I'll be back.

1328713,2013-01-22,2,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"Having lived in Vegas for a long time, this is an old high school favorite. 

Think of it like the greasy pizza place or Philly cheese steak you used to have on a Friday night with a bunch of your friends long before you could start drinking legally-but it's fried food instead!

I would have to say after all these years, the consistency has never changed. My typical meal consists of a gobbler sandwich, large fries and lemonade. The clucker sandwich is also good. 

You won't find any mayo here for your sandwich, it's miracle whip only or go home. My gobbler always comes with cranberry sauce as well. Personally, I ask for two cranberries hold the whip just so I can smother the juicy turkey breast in the cranberry delight. It's like deep frying a chunk of breast from Thanksgiving leftovers and loading it on soft bread.

And now for the fries..... Sometimes I drive through just to get three or four servings, and nothing more. Farm basket fries taste like they've been deep-fried chicken fat. They are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with just enough seasoning salt (and I wouldn't doubt if it has MSG) to make you keep going back for more.

The dining room is no-frills and never has been. Neither is the restroom, that is, if it's even open in the back like used to be. There are even some of the sodas that they still serve in cans. 

For dessert, may I suggest the cream cheese carrot cake. It's moist and a healthy serving! 

This might not be the place for some of the newbies in town because it's not diet food, and not fancy. But to those of us who've been in Las Vegas for years , it still remains an old favorite!",MqWViEypCBBOldFI0wm51A,10,6,4,m3z3ATXfY3LX4eGlP5UDKw

But very clean, and the staff give every appearance of liking to work there and wanting you to like the food.  Just an impression.  

Then you bite into a piece of their chicken.  We got the crispy.  But I suspect the same of all their chicken -- WOW.  Jenna was our order taker.  She's a kick.  This is the thing you can tell she loves to do.  And when we left with our takeout - we hadn't taken a bite yet - we called out, ""thank you"", and every single one of the staff all turned to us with a big grin.

So you can bet what the chicken tasted like when we got home.  Sunday night is movie night for us.  We made up our plates and sat down to watch our movie.  But quickly we stopped the movie to talk about how spectacular the chicken was.   Now I can tell you, this reminds me of the saying, 'chicken the way my mama used to make it'.

Sunday night dinner, fried chicken from mama -- go hit up Farm Basket.

Oh, by the way: workers behave the way they're treated.  Jenna told us a story about how her boss challenged the staff for an exceptional need; and it's obvious from her story that the boss here is pretty exceptional himself.",c__rAhHgIHP6DBe4uQ_1yQ,1,0,5,spFUgl6-87YmeU2Y1QPhoA

1617440,2014-08-22,13,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"In the words of Drake, the Farm Fries here ""be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there."" In theory, anyway. Fries plus chicken gravy (with pieces of fried chicken) and shredded cheese, in a giant portion, for $4.  Except the gravy could be better, and the cheese is cheap and rendered almost tasteless. But if you can overlook the fact that the product could be better, it's excellent for drowning your sorrows in on a bad day.

That being said, the chicken is largely regarded as mediocre and I ordered the clucketos and was underwhelmed as well- crispy, topped with lettuce and cheese, served with a side of salsa, but stuffed with chicken ground so finely as to make me suspicious of it's quality. 

And ""The Gobbler"" is basically a dry-as-ashes fried piece of poultry (you can't even taste that it's turkey), about on par in size and appearance with the ""Chicken Littles"" or ""Snackers"" at KFC, served with packets of cranberry and Miracle Whip. Not only is the sandwich sad, small, and disgusting, but it's not worth more than a buck or two. And whoever created Miracle Whip should be burned at the stake.

As others have said, order was ready in a flat two minutes- which is remarkable. Frankly I'm surprised the clucketos were so crisp because I can't figure out how they cooked them so fast. But those fries, man... it's actually kind of a blessing they're not better. I mean unless your life goal is to weigh four hundred pounds.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,2,ik9Jzb_UEDWjVdEaogLk1A

I must have passed this place for years before stopping in one night to finally try it. The clucker sandwich has become one of my favorite cheat meals ever. It's a fried chicken breast sandwich that comes with cranberry sauce on the side & miracle whip (I skip the miracle whip but my man loves it). The bread it comes on is buttered! I also need to mention the fries which are heavenly. Not sure what they do to give them the perfect crispy bite but I don't even need ketchup on them they're so good! 

We've also tried the sweet, orange rolls that are crazy good and then the cluck e' tos!!! Three rolled chicken tacos with cheese, lettuce & salsa. Everything is great here and if you haven't tried them you definitely should.

The chicken was a bit bland; I prefer spicy chicken or well seasoned chicken. The potatoes had plenty of gravy on them. The coleslaw was good and had a different seasoning that I couldn't quite pinpoint, but it made it better.

2442263,2013-02-25,7,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"Farm Basket is probably not the cleanest place in the world to eat. In fact, a few insects from inside the restaurant attached themselves to my wife as we were leaving. This place is a grimy and greasy!  My son's head smelled like fried chicken for the rest of the day.  That being said, I didn't want to wash his hair- because I liked it!

No joke, this place is great!   For lunch, I chose the 2 piece fried chicken meal (white meat) with mashed potatoes, gravy, and a delicious roll. The chicken was so juicy and seasoned perfectly. Translation - no salt or pepper needed, which is usually the first thing I do to fried chicken. I usually don't like using my hands to eat food, but I had no choice with this chicken. I felt like a fork and knife would have slowed down my eating process.  Instead, I shoved that chicken in my face and made all kinds of embarrassing animal noises until there was no meat left on 'dem bones. 

My wife opted for the cluck-e-tos, which were chicken taquitos with lettuce, cheese, and salsa. I was able to sneak a bit of these crunchy delights while keeping an eye on my chicken to make it wasn't going anywhere.  I have always associated taquitos with those frozen things that come in a 96-pack at Costco. This experience has made me a believer in this Americanized appetizer. The only thing that would make these better would be guacamole. (I'll trade the lettuce in for guacamole any day)

My kids tried the chicken fingers which I rank third on the list of menu items. The chicken wasn't nearly as tender as the fried chicken, and was not anything special to yelp about.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention those incredible French fries. These thin cut fries were cooked perfectly, and had just the right amount of seasoning. In fact, next time I will sub out the mashed potatoes for the fries instead. 

The staff was super friendly, and the food came out really fast. However, the dining area is small, and is not wheelchair accessible. All 6 of us were crammed into the back corner trying our best to not kick each other under the table.  But, with food this good - I can put up with it.

We didn't try the salads but I am sure they are good considering everything else was stellar.  They have pasta salad, potato salad and coleslaw.

2741723,2013-07-30,11,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"So these guys have been here forever I heard. After coming here, WHY is my question.

First of all, I was looking for a chicken combo meal. You know, a couple pieces of chicken, fries, and a drink. Let's see.......you can have a sandwich combo, a chicken finger combo, and a clucketo combo. They have a chicken combo but it does not come with a drink. That's not really a combo dude! 

So after looking around the place, I noticed everybody that was eating didn't have any actual chicken on their plates. All I saw were chicken fingers, sandwiches, and clucketos (chicken taquitos). As if that wasn't enough of  a clue that the chicken wasn't good. 

So I opted for the Gobbler Combo, which is a turkey sandwich. The turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried. They give you a small package of mayo to flavor it, which I thought sorely needed it. The fries it came with were dry and covered with a lot of salt. Sadly, it could not save those poor potato sticks. 

After forcing myself to eat the turkey sandwich, against my better judgement, I actually wanted to try their chicken so I got a leg and a wing. Might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam. 

Service was mysteriously fast. After further observation, it looks like they cook everything in advance and put it under warmers. I know this because not one second has passed since I hand over my debit card, they have one of the cooks handing me the two pieces of cardboard......err I mean chicken in a bag. I literally saw him pulling the chicken out of the warmer. 

So after taking a bite which should have been a nibble, I was afraid it was gonna bite me back. I would not give this stuff to a starving homeless person. That would be considered an insult. 

So to the reader, please, PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE. To the owner, since you have been there forever, I assume you got nothing to worry about since you got some people to actually come back and eat here.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,18,7,1,phPnhaEHMgvrHOeyf2I_qQ

I had a such high expectations of this place because some reviewer told everyone on Flavor Flav review that Harold's Chicken (which closed down) and Farm Basket had a better fried chicken.   So I decided to try this place out, instead of getting a refill of a KoMex's Sunday religious experience.        

I pulled into this location, and there was three table filled with customers, but none of them were eating Fried Chicken.    Something not right,  I see a few Chicken fingers plates, a Mexican salad, a turkey plate, and a bunch of chicken sandwiches (which I heard is one of their specialty)  but no fried chicken.     At that point, I should have left, but I was determined to see it  that guy was correct.     

The menu is pretty simple, but I ordered the dinner plate which consisted of three pieces, Mashed potatoes and gravy, and some roll with some kind of sweet sauce on top of it.    I sat down, but my order was up in 90 seconds.   I was surprised at the speed of my order, but it was painful to eat this darn meal.    My experience was closer to getting a meal in the hospital when you're on a lot of  painkillers, and temporary lost most of your taste buds.    The chicken was pretty dry, and warm.   The Cole slaw had about 1cc of vinegar, and even less mayo.   The mash potatoes wasn't bad, but can you really blow pre-made potatoes?   

I'm not a monster fan of this place, and I'm wondering how the heck they stayed in business for so long?    Perhaps, it's all about the Sammie sandwich at this place because I seen more of those getting hammered than anything else.     Well, I  will give this place a chance again for one of their sandwich.     Perhaps, the stars will star to rise for the Farm Basket from me.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,7,1,3,HzB2oG44KOT28t9tTPaB_w

This place really is a step above (barely) KFC.  Hell, Popeyes is far superior to Farm Basket. The chicken is dry (and that was the dark meat), mashed potatoes and gravy very bland and kind of gross, and I don't know what the deal is with the bun they give you, but it's definitely not finger licking deliciousness worthy of how other people have described it. Gross as well. Bread was dry and cold   And the coleslaw was the worst I've ever tasted. My husband and I just sat there looking at each other, in complete disbelief, because we couldn't finish the food. We have never in our lives been ones to waste food and throw it away, but we literally took about two or three bites of everything and we're totally grossed out. You have to understand, my husband is from the Midwest. He would NEVER turn down chicken and ESPECIALLY mashed potatoes and gravy. He'd say, ""yeah, I've had better, but I'm not going to let it go to waste"". He literally could not eat it. I'm very saddened that our experience turned out this way because we had been wanting to go there for a very long time. It's not even a good fattening kind of meal. If you want that stay with KFC or Popeyes, or get the Broaster Chicken at Streets of New York. Even the employees are annoying. Just typical teenagers that can't be bothered with anything-which really fries me. Do yourself a favor and just skip this place.

I read a review that the Gobbler was right up there with a Bobbie (my most favorite sandwich). After having one on this visit, I must disagree. The hunk of fried turkey was cooked well. Did I enjoy the flavor? Not really. I didn't detect any seasoning in the batter. The bun was smaller than I expected for a $5.99 price tag. I also fail to see the point of not dressing the sandwich. The cranberry and Miracle Whip would be better served on the Gobbler rather than in packets on the side.

Atmosphere: Naturally Country
With a name like ""Farm Basket"", one would only expect a countryside-like feel of this facility. The architecture definitely brings out that feeling.

Service: Not bad
I went through the drive-thru, asked, ""So what's good?"" obviously referring to the menu since the preceding question from the cashier was asking me for my order.

As a reply, she said, ""Farm Basket!"" with a cheerful laugh. Kinda corny of a response: caught me off-guard for sure.

Food came out in a timely fashion.

Food: Not bad at all!
The chicken was quite juicy and had a good crunch. the potatoes were fluffy but did not have a real distinct flavor to them. The bread and coleslaw were nice, but nothing special stood out to them. I was full at the end of my meal, however. The price I paid for the meal was a decent, value, however.

Summary: A good stop for a quick and hearty meal
Despite the lack of individuality the food has, it's actually quite filling after consumption. Stop by for a hearty meal that will fill you up!",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,1,0,3,h8x5HgG2rJJIHFqoITB47g

We received a combination of white and dark meat although I did request white meat.  The chicken is very crunchy, a bit much for me. The meat was tasty but the breasts were a little dry. The coleslaw was basic and enjoyable.

Unfortunately, we live in a world where one mishap like that can wind up on a rating site like this and torpedo a solid business.

3517160,2016-04-12,56,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"If you count when it was originally called Picnic 'N Chicken, Farm Basket has been in business over 40 years. We got our first Farm Basket in 1977 and while the original location on Tropicana is gone you can still find this one on West Charleston. Steve, the owner can be found most days behind the counter with a huge smile ready to serve customers. Bless Steve and his wife's (apart of the original family of owners) heart for keeping Farm Basket fresh, local and delicious all of these years. So many things come and go here in Vegas, so the fact that Steve is still doing it right after all these decades with very little change is truly awesome. Don't come here expecting fancy decor or anything modern looking. The business gives the appearance of a barn on the outside and inside has an old school western vibe that's very simple with no frills or gimmicky stuff. Ask sometime you are inside about some of he decor and you will find out that most of it has special meaning to the owners and is a nod to them. There is seating inside and they also have a covered patio with seating. During lunch and dinner time this place can get cramped with customers however the line moves quick. There is also a drive-thru which is very convenient. The number one seller here is the ""Great Gobbler"" that is a breaded turkey beast with cranberry sauce and Miracle Whip (don't even try to ask for mayo on this one!) and it's worth trying at least once if you never have before. Customer service is top notch here. 

Cluck e' tos ($4.99) - Something worth noting is that these are BOGO every Sunday! These are rolled chicken tacos with cheese, lettuce and salsa on the top. I have had plenty of rolled tacos from other places and there's something unique about how these ones taste. I like them a lot and when  Sunday rolls around it's hard to pass up. 

2 Piece Lunch ($5.99) - This comes with 2 pieces of fried chicken (your choice of original or crispy), mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw and a sweet orange roll. I always chose the original fried chicken because I just prefer it. The chicken is tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes have a nice buttery flavor and the gravy, made from scratch, is really good. Coleslaw tastes fresh yet could use a little more flavor. If you don't like sweet things then tell them you want a plain roll with your meal or it will come with a sweet orange glaze on it. I personally like the sweet orange glaze, but wish the roll was served warm. 

Farm Fries ($3.99) - This is a generous portion for the price and can be easily shared with someone. You get a pile of fries smothered in homemade gravy and shredded cheese. Need I really mention more? Comforting and tasty!

They offer different specials each week and most of them including ""Wacky Word"" Wednesday are posted on their Facebook page.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,68,72,4,jOu3PC9Xqg_PRG_rv60Xig

PRO: The calories are indeed delivered to you fast. Seriously no more than two minutes after stepping through the open doorway I had my food in a tiny white bag -- seeping grease from it in various spots -- in my hand and on my way. 

CON: The food provided was grossly over*priced as well as fairly unimpressive. If you are going to charge Chick-Fil-A or Raising Cane's prices, I expect it to be close to the same quality (minus the unabashed homophobia and Jesus music playing in the case of CFA).

PRO: They are a non-chain business (?) in a world of chains galore. 

CON: They won't be an any-type of business if they keep salting their fries so heavily that they will single-handedly kill all of their loyal clientele. My blood pressure might have tripled succeeding eating my small fries, which had more salt on them than I have had in months, combined.

Conclusion: Their tagline is ""We're Carried Away With Quality""; the truth is that they are carried away with their use of salt. Do not recommend unless you are suffering from dilutional hyponatremia. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,13,6,3,VV7uclhjObEKnkmWfJecMw

I even took a marketing class in college with one of the owner's children and got a free Farm Basket meal once!  That was something worth bragging about, Free Farm Basket!  Alas, I moved out of the area but not too long ago, I took on a position where the office is not too far away and we have been reunited (and it feels so good)!

Best...Fries...Ever...  That's all I need to say, but it's not all I'm gonna say.  I'm more of a Clutkeetos (chicken taquitos) and fries person these days, but I can't go without those fries.  I commented on my facebook page about the reuniting and all sorts of my former classmates chimed in about their favorites and I didn't remember the ""gravy fries"" from before so had to try them.  I think I closed half an artery on that one, but perhaps worth it!  

I can't eat what I want to as much as I used to for health reasons, but I do need to stop here and assure I get my fix once in a while now days.  I'm glad to have rediscovered Farm Basket!",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,2,2,5,mzYFoHvkADYbJNBgPHoDIQ

Now I am twenty-six and happy to show this place to anyone I can. This small, simple spot has been around for over forty years, and there's a good reason why: the food is consistently delicious and reliable. 

Much like the revered In-N-Out, the menu hasn't changed a whole lot over the years. After all, why fix something that isn't broken? Instead, they choose to stick to what they are good at--what they are great at. And that's turkey and chicken!

The family favorite in this house is The Gobbler sandwich. It's a simple piece of breaded and fried turkey cooked to juicy perfection on a soft roll. No muss, no fuss to let the turkey run the show! On the side automatically comes a small container of cranberry sauce and a package of Miracle Whip should you want to dress it up. It reminds me of making sandwiches out of Thanksgiving leftovers without any of the dried out sadness. Making it a meal adds a drink and a side of fries,  which are thin but golden and crispy and seasoned. They also have a chicken sandwiches and buckets of chicken available and a variety of sides. 

Come to Farm Basket if you want chicken and turkey done right. You can't survive in that business as long as they have if you don't. On Wednesdays they will offer a deal on one of their menu items if you come in and give them the code word they post on their Facebook page.",dcpE4CUvtqLf63tRJgNqKQ,4,2,5,4bqteulAelEOTmd08iu7EQ

There've been lots of chicken places I've eaten over the years from Roy Rogers to KFC, to Chick Fil-A to Raising Canes.   But quite honestly, the number place for me when I am in the mood for chicken is Farm Basket.  The place is small but comfortable.  The booth's are nice and long so you can stretch out a bit especially if you're there by yourself.  I almost always order the Finger Meal Deal with a Diet Pepsi and a small cup of their gravy instead of their usual dipping sauce options.

I didn't use to order their gravy when I first started eating there in 2007, but around 2010 or 2011, I tried it for the first time and oh...my...GOD IS IT THE BEST!!!!!!  I'll even dip my fries in it too!

I am one of those people who always knows exactly what they love when it comes to food so I'm unfortunately not one of those people who has tried everything on the menu.  But I can tell you that I have had both the Gobbler and the Clucker, and YES, there IS a difference! One's a turkey cutlet, the other's a chicken cutlet, but originally I could NOT tell the difference in taste!  The addition of Farm Fries to the menu is a nice version of Poutine in my opinion.  Their carrot cake is sometimes too big to finish even if you order a small size.  The gravy is to DIE FOR!  The chicken fingers...what I can tell you from coming here nearly 10 years, I know they've changed the recipe, and numerous times.  Back when I first started going in 2007, the chicken had somewhat of a softness to it and was a bit more salty.  Over the last 3 or 4 years, they have used less salt and the chicken is bit more on the tough side, but still edible and delicious.

I only wish that to show my love for this place they offered merchandise for the restaurant like baseball caps and t-shirts!

4960191,2010-05-12,1,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"Farm Basket used to have many locations around the Vegas Valley, but with the Tropicana location losing its lease, this is the only one left.

Farm Basket is, essentially, a drive-thru restaurant specializing in poultry products. They have been around for decades, and had several locations in the Valley - if you see some sort of establishment around town shaped like a small barn, chances are a Farm Basket once occupied that property.

The food itself is very good, and filling. The portions are a good size - so good, in fact, that I have to order off of the kids menu and it's STILL often too much food (and they have no problem if you order off of it, regardless of age.) 

The menu itself is quite diverse, featuring a variety of poultry products. Want straight-up chicken fingers and fries? They've got that. But if you want something a little more exotic, they also have the Gobbler, which features real turkey, and their signature Cluck-E-Tos, which are essentially taquitos with poultry instead of meat/beef.

The big complaint I have is that they only have one location left, and it is not in a great part of town. This remaining location is near the West Charleston campus of College of Southern Nevada, so unless you're in that area, expect a long, painful commute to get here. 

All thongs considered, Farm Basket is delicious, it's just a shame they don't have the variety of locations they once did. If you're in the neighborhood, swing on in, but don't go out of your way for it.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,3,1,4,2US6JuG3uipweXr6WGQ8TA

The fried chicken in the ""family fried chicken dinner"" I had was absolutely fried a day (or days) earlier and then thrown in the microwave. I've made the mistake of reheating leftover fried chicken in the microwave before and this was a reheat job. Never have I had such a thick, soggy coat of breading on a piece of fried chicken that slid off in a greasy mess in one wet disgusting piece. Thick and soggy...and tasteless! -And for comic relief, inside the meat was dry. Just the worst piece of fried chicken I ever had. I dare you to find an elementary school cafeteria that could produce worse. Even my girlfriend agreed, ""wow, this is bad"".

To elaborate on the rest of the meal...

The rolls were not fresh
The cole slaw was dry and tasteless
The fries were INSANELY over-salted

...and I've had better mashed potatoes lunchtime at a Chinese buffet.

I really hoped I could go far on yelp without tossing out a one-star rating (as I have a soft spot for business owners) but to be this out of touch with what you are handing out across the counter is ridiculous.

I might eat at a fried chicken joint twice a year, but with options such as Popeye's, KFC and Church's everywhere...how anyone can justify coming here is beyond me.

I don't buy that this stuff is healthy, but damn it tasted awesome. Plus I loved how they let me get 2 legs unlike most fried chicken places that require you to get a leg/thigh combo. 

We also tried the cloqueetos (ok that doesn't look right, but it's spelled something like that!).. so they are basically just chicken taquitos with tons of cheese and lettuce and salsa. Delish, but they definitely could have used some sour cream.

That was all I needed to hear. Farm Basket was all over Vegas when I was a kid.  They were even inside Pizza Inn, but, alas Pizza Inn is gone too.  But, fortunately 2 Farm Basket locations survived over the decades.

Farm Basket is a true ""fast food"" treat.  Best known for the ""Gobbler""  ( a piece of breaded fried turkey breast served on a long roll with cranberry sauce and Miracle Whip.....oh mama!)  and best known by me for their fantastic turkey fat fried and salted french fries.  (YUMMMY!!!)

So....I had a Gobbler, some French Fries, and a few Cluckeetos.  I'm full....MUST...TAKE....NAP!!! Zzzzzz. ( See that means I fell asleep.)",dZBXRw0BtYd-C3MEjtHUFw,3,2,5,_tYNZD1AzaQiSC175W-Cxw

The gobbler it's a simple sandwich with a roll, piece of chicken and on the side comes with cranberry sauce and miracle whip. Normally I do not like miracle whip at on that sandwich you cannot go wrong putting that miracle whip on it complements the chicken and the cranberry sauce perfectly. I could probably eat a dozen of the sandwiches except at six dollars apiece it's pretty pricey.  I wish the sandwiches were bigger for the price.  

Cluck -e-toes.  Their version of taquitos.   Killer!!!  Perfect crunch with the tender chicken in the middle.  I could live off of this stuff.  Served with shredded lettuce and cheese and salsa.

The guys at work kept talking about how great this place was and when I finally tried it I was disappointed at how I got a smooshed bun wrapped around a KFC original piece-looking chic-fil-a. The fries were heavily seasoned but looked like someone cooked them ahead of time and with a STRONG hand grabbed them, then through it in the bag. I made fun of the guys for liking such a terrible place. I sat and thought. ...what would make this taste better?

I should not have told them ahead of time at the drive-thru window that I had a Groupon. The eight piece box had chicken pieces that were overcooked, hard and greasy.  The chicken wasn't good at all.  It seems like they threw whatever scraps of chicken that was left over into the box.

We were so disappointed. We had a Groupon for a 12 piece family dinner. We got the Ol' Fashioned Chicken, it was comparable to original KFC but it was SUPER greasy, we were both afraid to eat too many pieces; we'd end up having a heart attack or a belly ache. The mashed potatoes with gravy tasted like paste. They are definitely instant potatoes, the gravy didn't help them much. The coleslaw was pretty much just shredded cabbage with a little milk added. The rolls were different, we didn't mind eating them, they were like dinner roll donuts.
The staff was nice and the restaurant was clean even with it being as old as it is.
Thankfully we didn't pay full price because we threw most of it away.

I have tried the cluck e' tos and the gobbler sandwich but my go-to meal is the kid's finger meal deal. For $6.49 you get plenty....three chicken strips, fries, hot sauce and ranch, and a lemonade.  It is bad for you, it's greasy, and it's dee-licious.

It was nothing but pre frozen pre cooked food! 
The chicken sandwich we got was so gross! Not to mention we had to put  our own mayo on it.
Are you serious????? You call this good food? 
All I remember is saying we would NEVER Go back!!!
And surprised they have been in business so long.  Its not good fast food nor is the prices any good.

I totally agree with the negatives here because we had the same thoughts and feelings. This is like a low end fast food chicken place.
Maybe it really isn't chicken lol

5871267,2014-03-01,2,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"I love Farm Basket. I don't eat meat, just chicken. I love their chicken tenders. I usually get a finger meal deal. The chicken has a taste that no other restaurant has. I love it. Their ranch is good too. I think the fries are fried in something more than just regular oil, because they taste very salty but delicious at the same time. You get a pretty good amount of food for what you pay, and it's yummy, at least to me.

I've given it 4 stars instead of 5 because of a couple reasons. One, there's no restroom inside. Two, there is a lady who works there that has zero clue what she's doing. My friend asked for hot sauce for his dipping sauce and she said they only have ranch, buffalo, etc not hot sauce. Buffalo is hot sauce, lady. She also then swiped my friend's card wrong and told us that my friend's card was being denied. He told her that she must have swiped it wrong, because he's used it that same day with no issues and there's money on it. She told him no, that there was no money on it and that the machine will not accept the card. He didn't have any cash on him so I took my wallet out. Not a fan.

It is a small place. The tables are pretty small. There's only about 6 booths, also some outside seating. Food comes out really fast, though, and in my opinion, is a great meal to have on a cheat day. ;)",OCz9lJa59X2YXkQy9u2-0Q,4,1,4,_3H0ClWK3W0hmk0N4p3UIQ
5918605,2017-02-27,3,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"One of my friend Annie told me about this place awhile back. The restaurant does not look at all impressive from the outside or inside and certainly not in the rather worn out looking strip mall it is located in on Charleston Blvd, it definitely fits the right in in the category of hole-in-the-wall hidden gem type of restaurant establishment.  But Annie spoke highly of this place, and her fond memories of her family dining here from when she was younger reminded me of how I felt about going to Pizza Hut (back in the day it was a sit down restaurant and some even had salad bars).

Anyway, I drove past it often when I used to drove past this area getting to class. But never had the inclination to stop and check them out. But having listened to Annie talked about getting dinner at Farm Basket for her family recently and it being really good fried chicken I decided to check them out. Plus I found a Groupon for the Family Basket, so I was able to try out more of their menu items than I would normally.

The Family Basket weighs a fair amount. The sides that you pick are also very ""Family"" sized and portioned for sharing. Mashed Potato with gravy was buttery with good texture. Coleslaw was fresh, but could be better with more flavor (I prefer more vinegary taste to coleslaws in general anyway). The Country Rolls are good and has this sweet glaze that I was not expecting. Their fried chicken was made fresh for me, which I was more than willing to wait for (gave me time to look around and take a few pictures to upload to Yelp), and I thought it was very good. The fried chicken was crispy and had good seasoning, the chicken was juicy and oddly reminded me of the fried chicken my grandmother made when I was little and living in Taiwan. Maybe it was the homemade from scratch taste that I vaguely recall.  Anyway I thought it was good.  But the pieces near the bottom of the basket were fairly greasy by the time I worked my way to it.

Overall I do like their old fashion fried chicken prepared and served in a vintage no frills restaurant that is a throw back to an earlier era.  The Colonel may have concocted a better secret spice blend, but KFC fried chicken now is not as good as I remembered when I tried it as a kid on a multi-state family road trip. And Farm Basket's fried chicken is definitely a better value and juicer than the present day profit-oriented KFC.

Going back for more since I recently purchased another Groupon.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,12,3,3,5gBUkVGLyWJljaJ0GgpgYA
5956138,2017-03-12,0,B3omTXI--0eiBC7nCv_WXg,"I have been frequenting this establishment since I was a young feller.  Surprisingly, I've never tried the cluckeetos, or even the fried chicken.  But the Great Gobbler is freaking life-changing.

It is a breaded, deep fried turkey breast served on a wonderfully soft and buttery roll. It has nothing on it, and is served with a packet of miracle whip and a cup of cranberry sauce.  Personally, I cannot stand MW so I always forgo that, but usually get an extra cran to smother all over.  Each bite is a combination of soft roll, crunchy coating and juicy turkey, with tangy cranberry.  And obviously the shoestring fries that are always perfectly crispy and seasoned with seasoning salt.  

You also have to love that some of the employees have been around for as long as I've been coming, and they still use their whiteboard system for taking orders.  Also, if you're looking for classic chicken fingers and fries (I love Raising Cane's as much as the next guy, but sometimes you want OG), you can't beat FB's fingers and ranch.  Killer.  I truly hope this place stays open forever.",NZwjXxRU0M6t6Xvq3aAbHw,2,0,5,ERWyjpFcB1npsogBaCctYA
