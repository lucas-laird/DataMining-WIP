108655,2016-12-27,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,Wow. This was literally the worst service that I've experienced in Las Vegas. Went for Sunday brunch. To start the menu was pretty limited. Ok I can work with that. It took about 10 minutes to get my 3oz empty glass filled with water. It took another 17 minutes for a waiter to come over and take an order. All the time crazy thirsty because no drink refills. I asked one of the 4 different staff that came by the table what the fish of the day was and never got an answer. Finally asked for the check and proceeded to go downstairs to the Thai place which was excellent. Never again herring bone,FZaSXdkSBi0lIYEsWfisRQ,0,0,2,9oARRqNSHHrwww1CSDcbpQ

128999,2016-04-05,1,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"So, we're checking out the menu online and everything looks great. Looking forward to trying something new on our vacations. Wednesday night, we easily book for two at 9pm. Showing up a bit early we notice that it's that new-fangled ""couch seating"". I believe it's called ""lounge"" and of course it's all the rage these days. Ugh. Not a fan. If I want to eat dinner from a coffee table sitting on a couch... well... I'll just stay home. It's ""fancy"" food with Vegas casino prices, I'm not interested in holding a large heavy plate of clams and mussels in my lap. Why not pull up a TV and put on ""Grimm"", sounds like a perfect evening out, right?

We elect to sit at the bar, which also isn't our favorite, but much better than leaning over the low coffee tables. As we're coming in, we notice several couples, dressed nicely with napkins across their knees, taking very careful spoonfuls of food from the low tables. You know how you have to hold your hand under the fork so you don't spill pureed carrot sauce on your strapless Versace? Yeah, we saw that.

It's important to note that the place is totally swank and had a groovy vibe, the couches and chairs looked really comfy. I totally get the concept, but not for ""full"" fare. If it was all small bites, tapas and drinks, then it would be fine. 

On to the food. We've been to Julian Serrano several times (also at Aria) and come to expect amazing presentation and flavor combinations that we don't get normally. Eating anywhere at an upscale Vegas casino should be the pinnacle of gourmet. The food at Herringbone was well prepared and tasted very good, but for the money, we didn't find that it had the ""wow"" that we experience consistently at Julian Serrano.

We started with Roasted Beets (excellent), but unfortunately I make my own version that we like better (always looking for new ideas). I had the Ora King Salmon, a large cut which was cooked perfectly and seared crispy. Along with carrot puree, more beets and lime salsa, it paired well with the salmon. My wife enjoyed the Mussels & Clams, but again, it didn't have the ""wow"". We also ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese which contained a decent amount of lobster, but I seem to remember that the sauce was a bit split. Had to try the Death by Potatoes as well and found it to be very tasty (pancetta FTW), but also a little too buttery... based on the description though, I should have expected it, so I can't fault it.

Service was perfect, the bartenders took care of us well. Presentation was very nice.

I think we'd come back in a heartbeat for tapas (sized+priced) and drinks, it's a nice place. Or perhaps dinner without the extra sides outside on the patio (tall-boy tables) if the weather was nice (it was closed because of a storm the night we visited).

Thought the seafood pasta dish was excellent with the right amount of zing to its tasty sauce and ample fish, shrimp, etc.  The sea bass on the other hand was a disaster.  It was very dry presumably because it was grossly overcooked, and lacked flavor.   Rib eye steak was tasty but a step down from a real quality steak house.  Tried some appetizers including the salmon cold dish, and was not at all impressed with the chefs attempt to turn the salmon into something special ( I consider myself a sushi connoisseur ).   Had a Mac n cheese side dish and was somewhat surprised to find small bits of pineapple floating throughout.  In my opinion the pineapple was not a pleasant surprise and simply detracted from a dish that I consider rich comfort food.  In retrospect I should have sent the sea bass back, but felt my doing so would impact our guests who were here from Korea.",xlj27anGGrkhcUA2V2jUlg,0,0,2,0qneGBg_GLLA0PRwiF-1sA

Food came out around 15 mins later and looked delicious already.

The Seabass was amazing, topped with tangerine reduction sauce. Meat was moist and cook just right (We would definitely order that again!!!)

The Seafood spaghetti was really good too, the seafood they put in was good selection (including squid, crab meat, 2 or 3 huge prawns, a few huge scallops as well). The sauce was Amazing. 

The dishes are pretty big portion. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish the spaghetti. It's good sharing size I would say!

When the staff heard about our story, they decided to treat us like a king and queen all night! Thanks to our wonderful server, Jamie, our amazing Chef, Jonathan, and the generous Manager, Doug, we were able to forget about the bad in the world and we were reminded that love is so much stronger than hate. Everything we had that night was beyond delicious and I could not have asked for a better way to spend my birthday.

399457,2017-05-03,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Came in around 3pm for lunch Yesterday after debating between Julian Serrano or Herringbone. My girlfriend and I had planned to go here for our anniversary dinner a week ago but was told the patio was closed due to an event so we ended up doing lunch at Milos that day. Still wanting to give this place a try we walked up to the host stand to get seated and was told they only have their small bites menu. Which seemed weird for a restaurant to only offer that menu at that time when they have their only lunch menu and dinner menu but I guess the kitchen might have been transitioning to dinner or something. We were hungry and in a rush so we were seated outside at the patio which was nice. What wasn't great was being put in the middle of the Vegas sun as it's hitting the 90s now with barely any shade while everyone around us seemed to be covered especially as we were in jeans and my girlfriend had on a sweater. Also it was strange how a group of ladies were able to order full sized menu items while we weren't allowed to partake with no explanation.

Service: I know it's more of a casual restaurant but you're still working on the strip in a high end casino. Server did his spiel and gave quick unhelpful answers when I asked about the menu which consisted of like 6 things. Like thanks for reading it for me that totally helps in my decision. Kept pushing drinks, when they couldn't even have the decency to give out cold iced water to guests sitting out in the patio. I know it was our choice to sit there but you'd think one would be aware enough to realize maybe the majority of guests outside would enjoy iced water instead of warm water in the sun. I know they make their money from drinks but you don't have to keep pushing after we said we're good the first few times. When we were eating my girlfriend asked for hot sauce and the server responded with ""You mean Tabasco?"" In a condescending tone and proceeded to tell his busser who yelled about it as they both dicked around for a bit before finally taking it out, all while we were still two feet away. The runner did a good job bringing the food out and breaking down the dishes so at least one part was good. 

Food: We ordered 4 fish tacos with one being beer battered, Kobe Burgers w/ Fries, and the ""famous"" Buffalo Octopus. The first fish taco was decent that was beer battered while the grilled one was flat, plain, and riddled with bones. Everything was literally soggy and I couldn't tell if I was eating tortilla or fish. Do you know that feeling you have as a kid when your parents make you eat something even though you didn't want to and you're crying as you chew it with tears streaming down your face? That's how I felt with the tacos. The Kobe sliders. I've had angus beef that was better than what was served. For Herringbone to even sell this as ""Kobe"" is a crime. Barely tasted the meat as it was mostly the thick bun which they couldn't decide if they wanted it soft or toasted and at what parts. The Buffalo Octopus was decent with the first bite but afterwards I couldn't tell if I was eating Chicken or Octopus as it was fried so tough that I felt like I was eating a buffalo wing at Bdubs. Honestly the best part of my meal was probably the french fries. Which isn't saying much as it's the same thing you can get at any burger joint.  

Thoughts: Herringbone is a chain restaurant spawning from California and I get that. I understand it's more casual. But this is not a high end chain restaurant even though they market and price it as such. You could honestly get better food at Applebees or Chilis. These servers and bussers act entitled for no reason at all. I'm not even sure if what we ate was made by a chef of herringbone or just thrown out to us by the Aria Pool Kitchen. Which I wouldn't be surprised as they are connected. I ended up paying about $80 after tip and I wish I went to Julian Serrano. You go into certain places with a set of expectations with the price point you pay and this place shattered all expectations and runs away with your money all while leaving you feeling sick from questionable fish tacos.",rfD1rP1mwozBj7pJ1eS88Q,2,1,1,XvoSS1x7bowQziq_nCjujQ

897572,2016-11-30,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"We went to Herringbone for Thanksgiving dinner with 10 people after seeing their 4 course Thanksgiving menu online. The ambiance is nice and the food was delicious. 

Unfortunately, we had a serious customer service issue that soured our experience. When we sat down we were informed that they would only make the Thanksgiving menu if the entire table was getting it even though what I had seen online did not say that. We had 10 people and trying to get that many people to agree on anything is nearly impossible! One couple wanted to do a seafood feast instead because they don't care for turkey. It was not as though they weren't ordering hundreds of dollars of food and drinks! The Thanksgiving dinner was served family style but they only made an amount for the number of people that were eating it and you couldn't ask for more (we tried with the oysters) so there wasn't a concern that those 2 people would be eating something without paying. I have no idea of the logic behind this rule...I see the point for a table of 2 or even 4 but for a table of 10!? We spoke to the waiter and he was nice but it was such an issue that he re-seated our 2 friends at another table by themselves, at this point, 2 others of our group were so disgusted they walked out! So now we're taking up a table for 10 with 6 people and a table for 2 and our ""friendsgiving"" is missing 4 of our friends! We asked for a manager who was apologetic but wouldn't make a decision and had to go ask the chef. Finally, they agreed to let our 2 friends with the seafood feast move back and sit at the very end of our table so that we could eat together. We then had a nice meal but while the food was good, the whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths. To be treated this way at a fine dining restaurant is not acceptable. 

I would not go back to Herringbone nor recommend it for this reason.",z7XM-D1yRbEkGD8X3NgRMQ,5,0,2,PvusZyKYFjtBw9CO6Axplg

Knowing how great the Executive Chef (Geno Bernardo) reputation is in the community, I had to come and try Herringbone!  And of course Chef and the staff hit it out of the park once again!

Everything was delicious and the presentation was superb! We started off with the Valentine's Trio of Jars of Scallops, Steak tartar and Poke...so good! Next, we sampled Nana's meatballs...so delicious; I think I could have eaten 2 plates!

The pasta was flawless...agnolotti with butternut squash had a nice touch of sweetness and the tortellini was top notch.

I also highly recommend the White Sea Bass and the Icelandic Cod Loin, cooked to perfection!

Finally, the drinks were delicious, great service, I loved the vibe of the restaurant and the patio is amazing.  I cannot wait to return to sample more of Chef Geno's masterpieces!",sUa3C4amQDm_GQokRxPSGQ,1,1,5,aqCxCoxjW_kg0u7ywnvnAg

957361,2016-01-14,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Overrated in my opinion - at least for now.  Maybe they're still working out their kinks but I was unimpressed overall.  Started with the Salmon Rillettes which were really good - served in a jar with toast points and a small ramekin of lemon curd.  The lemon curd was a great touch and paired nicely with the savory Rillettes.  Unfortunately that's really the last positive thing to talk about.  The service at the bar was anemic and subpar when they were actually around - they seemed more interested in cleaning the bar than actually performing service or talking to their guests ... except for one gentleman sitting at the bar who they must've known since he was the only person to have the bartender engage them out of a 4/5 full bar.  They were very unsure of themselves when I asked a routine question about the ""set"" on which the fish were served - it took three of them to come to a conclusion as to what to say when I asked them to tell me about it.  My entree of Sea Bass was minuscule and I'd feel the same way even if I were in a tapas place.  If the fish itself was 5 ounces I'd be surprised, I'd say more like 4-4.5 oz ... for $40 - I know it's the Strip but that's just ridiculous ( to be fair, everything else seemed reasonably priced considering I was in Aria, as did the fish ... before I knew how tiny the portion was for a main dish ).  Fish and veggies were cooked nicely but severely oversalted.  The dish would've been good had the fish not been too salty and there was more of it but the way it stands I didn't feel there was any value there at all - seriously, it was appetizer sized ( and I'm a local ... I know all about how expensive it is to eat on LVB - this dish had me scratching my head as to whether or not 1.)  more was on the way out or   2.) I had been given and charged for a ""smaller portion"" ... but neither were the case ).  Had the Mac & Cheese ( with lobster and apple ) as a side ... skip it.  It had no backbone - the noodles were overcooked, close to mushy, and retained no sign of al dente and the whole side was super bland and lacked any structure.  That's where the salt could've come in handy.  I had hoped with apple involved there would be some sort of crunch but it was nowhere to be found as the apples were also overcooked, lacking as much backbone as the noodles themselves, and had very little to add to the dish ( Maybe the apples aren't supposed to be al dente ... but again, I was thinking that the snap and ""crunch"" of the apple would provide texture and that was the reason it would be included but there was none of that and almost no taste component added either since I had to seek out the bits of apple to make my assertation ).  Not much lobster in there either but I didn't really expect much for $18 - it was most likely slipper lobster and, again, not much of it.  I did like the idea of the pretzel crumb crust on top of the m&c and that was probably the highlight of the dish but that was the sole bright spot.

The ambiance was decent.  The music was just at the right volume, even a hair more would have been too loud - I like my restaurants as restaurants ... not clubs ... and the DJ who was spinning music for the room was doing a pretty good job.

Again, the Salmon Rillettes were very good but $85 + tip for Salmon Rillettes, salty fish, and bland mac & cheese isn't cutting the mustard.  I will try it again in a few months and hopefully things will have turned for the better.",S1uf2BCgKcQET2OmDz0HAA,0,0,2,tSjaRuV0wtZveJ-l29FITQ

Also, the meat used is mostly claw meat which is kind of a bummer for a $34 lobster roll. Surprised that when we complained and the manager came, they did not take it off the bill.

Service was pretty bad: we were seated for 20 minutes or so and it became obvious that our waiter had forgotten about us.  The manager stopped by and asked us if we needed anything.  We told him we would like to order and he said that he didn't have paper or pen but would try to remember our orders instead.  He did an ok job at that but I ordered a cappuccino and he said 'so latte right?"" And I said ""no cappuccino"" and thought 'uh oh'. Our waiter came by after the manager berated him (we saw them) and he came to apologize about how he dropped the ball.  And then he was like ""you got a latte coming right?"" Me: ""no cappuccino"". And in the end they still brought me a latte.  I was too tired to make a scene about it due to lack of food at this point.  First course came out and then a reaaaaally long pause before our other food did.  Our meal was like 1.5 hours for lunch.  Most of it being waiting to order, and waiting for other food.  

Food was meh.  We got:
Salmon rillette: was served with this lemon custard that was too sweet and not enough brightness.  Also only 4 pieces of tiny bread for a giant pot of salmon, that doesn't seem right.

Ahi poke: too salty, not flavorful/sweet enough.  I grew up in Hawaii and this wasn't even as good as the poke we got in Costco.  The green onion pancakes served with them were gummy and not crispy enough to balance out the texture.  

Niscoise salad: Wasn't that memorable which is why I can't remember anything about it.

ALASKAN KING CRAB cause you can never go wrong w/ it & I wanted my parents to try that first on New Years Eve.  They loved it so today we started there again.  I love the devil dip!

A blow me away evening at Herringbone consisted of the following, but first & foremost, thank you Chef Jessica, Manager Cefrin, Chawwn, Rolando.. WOW.  

TUNA POKE.. Mom & dad had never wanted to try raw tuna or sashimi.  The beautiful presentation & freshness of the tuna made them a bit adventurous & they LOVED it.  The wonderful chip, possibly a fried seaweed & sea salt blend to accompany the fresh tuna tartare w/ Maui onion & small pieces of toasted Macadamia nuts were remarkable.  Not a rough chip cause once the tuna met the chip it kind of melted in your mouth together.  Perfectly planned combination.

JUMBO SHRIMP.. Mom is not fond of cold shrimp, but this was the second time she had it here & absolutely loved it too.  The cocktail sauce & presentation on ice in a brass type of rustic basin, similar to how the King Crab comes out was just fantastic.  Hearty & filling.  

BAJA SHRIMP COCKTAIL.. a SUPER tasty 'Bloody Mary' or a Michelada that I am still craving!  Served w/ Clamato, lots of fresh shrimp, pico de gallo, avocado, all mixed together.  Garnished w/ a Tajin type of Cajun mix on top of a couple of Jicama sticks, a jumbo shrimp, a celery stick & celery flower, & a side of Saltines, which I prefer the Lavash, it's way better than the Saltines.  
They no longer have the Shrimp Ceviche that I posted before FYI, this is now their Shrimp Ceviche.  I wouldn't consider it a Ceviche, but honestly it is filling & fantastic.  A bit tough to share, but an absolute must if you love Bloody Mary's & Shrimp.  Wow so good!!  I can't wait to order it again w/ my brunch or for my brunch!  

LOBSTER ROLL.. the salad mixed w/ the lobster did not overwhelm the chucks of lobster at all.  I was happily surprised.  The roll was slightly sweet & perfect to share although it doesn't look like it is.  Once you split it in two, wow the lobster salad is really packed in & filling!  I like to get a few dishes & share so this is one that you can get w/ the King Crab or Baja Shrimp or eat all alone.  Also I saw the Cobb Salad & cannot wait to try it.  It is ENORMOUS & looks like it would be a nice shareable dish w/ the Roll or anything really.  

CHEFS SPECIAL SCALLOPS WRAPPED IN BACON W/ RISOTTO.. I am not a fan of scallops, however this special comes w/ three bacon wrapped scallops so I tried one.  Not a grain of sandy taste, that I cringe to when I've had some of the best of the best scallops.  The bacon was a perfect crispy addition to the scallop & PERFECTLY cooked risotto.  The risotto was phenomenal.  Creamy & a nice bite, as risotto should be.  I couldn't get enough.  

GRILLED ORGANIC CHICKEN SANDWICH.. shared between mom & I.  Cooked perfectly & moist w/ my fav heirloom tomatoes, Burrata, charred red onions, Dijon & aioli.  No onions next time, but I'm picky, it was so very tasty w/ a nice homemade tasting bun.  Very soft.  Both the Lobster Roll & this brunch item come w/ either a salad or fries.  The fries are unbelievably seasoned & at the end of your meal you will notice that you've eaten them all!  Fabulous & worth every calorie & bite.  

HERRINGBONE SUNDAE.. Excellent!  5 STARS Pouring the salted caramel onto the combination of honeycomb, Oreo & coffee gelato, Chantilly cream w/ the toasted smooth creamy marshmallow was hard to describe.  Our favorite dessert so far here is the best way.  It wasn't a s'mores or Rocky Road, but had it's own uniqueness that is definitely something that you should start with first, if possible lol.  Mmm mmm mmm!  

My least fav dessert is the Chocolate, Sea Salt & Caramel.  All of my favorites combined!  Except I find it super tough to cut into the ice cream & Nutella gelato.  Dad said it needed to be warmed up for a few seconds.  I agree since this is the second time we've had it.  The candied hazelnuts, chocolate crumble & presentation are wonderful though.

New Years Eve brunch & today's brunch were both mind-blowing.  The Hostess's greet you w/ smiles & are very nice.  Thankfully they added more comfy seating versus how it was in the beginning.  They do still have the couches outlining the restaurants, which I think are nice for cocktails.  Outside seating was closed due to weather, but I took a look & it is beautiful for when it is nice out w/ a view of the pool.  They have clearly stepped up their game since multiple times being here.  I don't like to leave a bad review so will often frequent a place to get a good feel so after I left my review, I came back twice.  Both of which, I left craving dishes, excited to go back & try new dishes, also impeccable service.  

Thank you once again Chef Jessica, Manager Cefrin, Chawwn, Rolando!  You made our evening amazing!",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,16,7,5,X6D4nb3vKzP5ogH9JDPhKw

The original restaurant we had planned on having the birthday dinner at wanted to charge us a horrendous amount, and we would not be getting anything well portioned.

1373182,2018-01-18,22,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Came here for brunch a couple days before Christmas.  Made a reservation on Open Table, so that we were sure to have a seat ready.  I know sometimes (having lived in Vegas) that without a res, brunch can be difficult to get into mid day.  We were seated in the middle of the room at a two-top.  Given the run down by our friendly female server that there is a small paper menu of items included that are made fresh to order in addition to a station by station buffet around us.  That alone is $59 per person.  If you would like to have a mimosa or bloody mary, they are $17 each, or you can do bottomless starting at $35 - $95 per person depending on the level of basic bubbly to premium bubbles.  I would suggest arriving early (11am) and staying to watch a game and leaving at  2 or 3pm when it ends.  Then you can get breakfast and lunch in. lol  We did two brunches, a coffee, and I had one bottomless basic bubbly package.  Our total before tip was $170.  Very expensive for an afternoon meal.  COME hungry!

On the bright side, the food was good.  Excellent, no, but good.  We ordered couple items straight from the menu.  The orange ricotta chocolate chip pancakes with tree sap (in less fancy wording ""maple syrup"").  The chips were more like pistoles (the large round pellets), and not chips.  Good quality chocolate.  The whipped cream melted off the pancakes faster than I could get an insta worthy photo.  Some segments of oranges ontop.  The Egg Al Forno is basically baked eggs, pork gravy, garlic confit and Parm.  Served with toast, but I wasn't about to fill up on bread.  This was tasty, but I was over it after about three bites.  The manager made a stop by the table to check in.  They are at least attentive.  

Stations:  Carving meats, shellfish, lox and cream cheese, omelettes, waffles, bacon, and my favorite stone crab (but they were small).  There was a salad station in the back, and a cute cart with desserts in the center of the room with filler decor like packaged mini donuts, jellybeans, Good and Plenties, and mini cupcakes, red velvet whoopie pies, and some pretty but tasteless meringue kisses.  To get the most bang for my buck, I stuck with the meats and fishes.  Had a few bites of salad.  The desserts were terribly disappointing and overly sweet.  

At least the juices with my $35 mimosas were freshly squeezed.  And we watched an entire football game.  There was a DJ too, very interesting mix of music.  I definitely ate enough to have the energy needed for the electric car I rented.",vUthM37V1IkWqy2laAzuhw,44,41,3,fU8egpp2QttushGTlRBJkg

We were seated outside and since we were right next to the speakers it was very loud! But hey, it's Vegas. I assumed it's just part of the image the restaurant wanted to create. Our server was nice & polite and went over the recommendations. We decided to split the seafood spaghetti, the grilled baby octopus and the onion soup. Do not order the seafood spaghetti....the lobster was no where to be found, the shrimp was over cooked and it was definitely not worth $45! For that price for a pasta dish, I would expect a lot more content! The crab meat barely existed as well. The onion soup was just like any other onion soup....no cheese covering the top but simply only a small baguette with some cheese sprinkled on the bread that was swimming in the soup. There were also tiny raviolis in the soup...wasn't really anything amazing. $14 for the soup. The octopus was probably the best dish. It was nicely charred which I liked. But is it worth $18? Probably not. Since we didn't try any of the raw items, maybe that is what they are known for. Vegas has too many good restaurants to choose from and I don't think I'll be going back.

Started off with a glass of Merlot and had the mussels braised in curry, served with pipping hot pita. The pita was burnt and was surprised it was served that way. The mussels were fresh and was cooked perfectly. The curry sauce was robust and nutty but had way too much oil in it. There were tons of oil puddles swimming with the mussels. 

The yellowtail crudo definitely had potential. It was served beautifully on a platter, and the fried onions added a nice crunch to the dish. However, the yellowtail was fishy and it could have been because the night was almost over. I was hoping more hints of grapefurit for some additional flavors and would recommend that this is incorporated a bit stronger with the yellowtail.

We were one of the first tables sat and brunched until the near closed of the brunch hour. Our server was awesome and we passed on the mimosas and was provided just the vevue champagne. I doubt the server expected we were going to sit there and brunch for 5 hours! We definitely drank well over the price of the package.

Oysters = super fresh!
Octopus = 10/10 delicious, where's the other 7 legs?
Tuna poke = 8/10 good but forgetful

Grilled Whole branzino = 9/10 great flavor and light and fluffy! Fileted, so didn't have to deal with bones! Not fishy at all!

Salmon = 8/10 well cooked and meaty. Skin side was nice and crisp. Tasty especially with the succotash it was served with.

Seared Tuna = 7/10 good but not as good as the other 2 dishes. Saving grace was the sauce it was served with to add more flavor.

Mashed potatoes = 6/10 too rich and buttery for me. You can see the oil/butter on top. 

Brussels = 8/10 delicious.  Order this side! Doesn't taste Healthy which means it's good!

Cocktails = 9/10 all were good, no complaints, well made concoctions!",-QmmHtp57b3zT79APvRONA,1,0,5,gNaAEwV0D6bXELrKaJGBgQ

We had reservations here after our Red Carpet and from approaching the restaurant and checking in we were all smiles as the hostess was super nice and sat us promptly while pulling out my chair and placing my napkin on my lap and then going around to do the same for my husband who didn't allow it as he's a man and much prefer pulling out a woman chair than having one pull out his chair. However the hostess placed the napkin on his lap and provided us both a menu for food and a shared wine and spirits menu. 
We were entertained by a LIVE DJ who was spinning a mixture of 90's R&B and Top 40's I mean I couldn't stay still in my chair last night. 
We started with some crab puffs, calamari and Kale and strawberry salad. I explained be calamari earlier. The crab puffs and Kale Salad were the starter SHOW STOPPERS. They were soooo good and flavorful. My husband and I shared them both. We went on to share a main course which was scallops and Risotto and when I say it was soooo DELICIOUS I MEAN IT.

The egg & bacon ravioli was mediocre, the chilaquiles was underwhelming, and the avocado toast was inedible. It's served cold so the ""toast"" was basically stale bread, that was so hard that the knife won't slice through it, and it cut the roof of my mouth.

I've been here on a couple occasions, both for dinner and the most recent - for lunch. I came here at lunch looking for scallops but didn't realize that the lunch menu is incredibly abbreviated, there's almost none of the dinner entrees on it.

For lunch, we ordered the lunch box - I had a small trout caesar to start, and another side salad with my lobster roll. It's a little confusing, the ""little gem"" salad is actually the trout caesar, just named differently on here for some reason. The portion sizes were decent, not overwhelming large but not like some fancy French restaurant.

1789942,2016-08-14,2,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Herringbone is a relatively new restaurant in Aria, brought to us from Brian Malarkey (Top Chef Season 3, a mentor on The Taste, and chef from Seersucker).  Funny how the name Herringbone and Seersucker refer to types of clothing weaves!  

We came here for morning brunch, and got seated outdoors under a nice umbrella (with a humidifier!) and surrounded by plants.  It felt like eating at a resort since all the servers were in shorts and there was a huge pool behind us.

We went for the Coastal tasting menu for $55/pp.  Overall pretty good - especially seafood and eggy items.  Kitchen service was a bit slow, but our waiter Rodney was excellent.  Highlights of our brunch:

First Courses:
* Appetizer of radishes with sea salt and honey butter - crispy and the flavor combo kinda works.

* Poke - wow pretty fresh yellowtail with shoyu, Maui onion, and mac nuts.  They offered some flat bread that reminded me of green onion pancakes that was quite good and perfect for scooping up the poke.

* Shrimp Ceviche - more on the tart side from the Clamato and salsa, but lots of shrimp!  They added some nice guac and used saltines for scooping up the ceviche.

Second Course:
* Crab Benny - Instead of something on an English muffin, this was two cakes of lumped crab meat with two perfectly cooked sous vide farm eggs. We liked this dish, especially that runny egg which is like having more sauce for the crab cakes.

* Bobby Sliders - Named after ex-poker legend Bobby Baldwin (and now Casino Exec at Aria), these were Kobe beef with some aged cheddar that added some sweetness to the sliders.  Pretty good as well!

Dessert:
* Fresh fruit platter had a nice variety - mango, watermelon, strawberry, pineapple, and a rambutan! The whipped yogurt sauce underneath was nice and sweet.

Definitely recommend coming here for brunch, but only if you're not in a big hurry.  Seafood dishes seem on point here.",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,5,3,4,wW8qwX3ZDW8bT2T1dv0WXg

1800383,2018-05-21,1,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"We were looking forward to trying Herringbone for some time. Made our reservation over a month in advance. When we arrived for our 6:30 reservation, there was no problem getting a table because the place was nearly empty. The hostess sat us at what we hoped would be a quiet table in the corner. The restaurant could be described as upscale casual. Lots of televisions with sports shows on them. No table cloths, just small leather place mats. It was about 10 minutes or so before our server, David, came to the table to get our drink orders. Another 10 minutes before the water arrived. And another 10 minutes before the adult beverages got to the table. And we still hadn't given our order for dinner. It was about 45 minutes before we got to hear the specials and place our order. We decided to share 2 apps and 2 ""plates"" ( their entree sized portions). As appetizers, we tried the Buffalo Octopus ($21) and the Peel & Eat Shrimp ($22). The octopus had a nice presentation- 3 pieces of octopus, nicely arranged on a small plate with a couple of carrot slices and some black eyed peas. Tasty. The P&E Shrimp was a run of the mill shrimp cocktail served over ice with a small cup of cocktail sauce. OK but really nothing special. For my entree I got the seared tuna ($37). The plate had 4 one inch diameter cylinders of tuna with a small scoop of humus and a very small portion of an eggplant-like side on the plate. An appetizer-sized portion with an entree-sized price. Really good seared ahi should melt in your mouth. This didn't. It wasn't bad. Just meh.  My wife got the branzino ($46). Served filleted with the head on. Also meh. As side dishes we got the Boardwalk Fries and the Brussels Sprouts and Pecans. Both came to the table room temperature. I know, I know. I should have sent them back. But when you've been sitting well over an hour waiting for the food, you are not anxious for anything to go back to the kitchen. Besides, to send something back, we would have to have seen our server. After taking our order, his next appearance at our table was to hand us the check at the end of the meal.
Which brings me to the service. Which was absolutely awful. When we came in, the place was pretty empty (see my photo). You would think that would make for great service. Nope. Besides for being extremely slow to get the food out of the kitchen, no one came by to see if we needed anything more after the food hit the table. Our water glasses stayed empty until we could flag down a busboy to refill them. We were pretty much ignored for the evening.
Oh yeah, did I mention that they charged $3 for 3 slices of cold toast. And $9 for parking.
Bottom line, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 adult drinks for $200.
Suggestion: If you feel like a fish dinner, take an Uber 3 miles south on Las Vegas Blvd to Bonefish. The service is much better, the fish fresher, the prices more reasonable, and the parking is free.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,5,1,1,0EUYSqx7LTp56PQUoilenw

This place has the perfect menu. Enough specialty cocktails that there's something you would like, but not too many where you feel overwhelmed. The food portion is also perfectly balanced. With a mix of raw, cold, hot, land, and sea, you're bound to find something that suits you. All the entrées are a la carte, so be prepared to spend a little more if you want some of that lobster Mac & Cheese. 

We tried the 8 oz filet, the sea scallops -land risotto, burrata, fries, mushrooms, and lobster Mac & cheese. While everything was delicious I wasn't super impressed with the risotto that went with the sea scallops. The flavor was a little too sweet and didn't balance out the natural sweetness of the scallops. However it was all cooked to perfection. I think the real stars were the sides and the appetizers. 

We sat on the patio and it was beautiful. Wonderful decor, mature potted plants everywhere, a view of one of the Aria pools. It was like being on vacation.

I've gone to some of the top restaraunts in Vegas for multiple occasions and just for fun and I've never had the experience that Jenna gave us.

I love how they have cocktail sauce and you can control the heat with the side of horseradish. I do wish there were little cups to hold the sauce on the side though, I don't like things to mix. Beverage station included in price and of course you can upgrade your package to have more alcohol and bottomless alcohol as well. Salad station was good, I really enjoyed their caesar. The hot station had lamb, pork and something else. But I pretty devoured the baked salmon. Omg, it was so creamy and not over cooked.

If you're not familiar with the Aria, then you'll learn to realize that the casino is rather massive. This restaurant is located in a hidden area next to the buffet. 

Ambiance: From the outside it's not very appealing or inviting. The interior was purposely kept dark to give it a lounge and romantic setting. The table seating wasn't too comfortable. tables were placed very oddly unlike a restaurant that's sort of upscale & trendy. My boss thought the servers were all ""extremely attractive"" and he's right, but again it's Vegas so this is a good strategy to have. How to better drive business? Simple: Sex appeal. 

Food: 
Burrata - well garnished dish with plenty to share with 2 pple. 
Branzino Ceviche - supposedly a whole fish but they don't serve you with the head or tail, just the cuts of fish. Very refreshing!
New Zealand Trout - grew up eating trout from South Africa. The trout was well cooked and it's a huge piece of fish laid on roasted vegetables. 

Overall: I suggest those who like seafood to give this place a try. The ingredients were quite fresh.",vZ_39LxO0ulFenLRqYNbsA,0,1,3,l8biUszH4HhXrcEtD9P2_w

My gf wanted to come here for dinner since it was at where we were staying, located at the Aria hotel. I've been to Herringbone in Santa Monica for brunch and was not a huge fan so was willing to try this location and for dinner. The layout is very nice. Very open space and welcoming. It has a casual and comforting feeling to it. As you walk in there is tables laid out across the room, a bar, and a pretty big outside sitting area. On the side there was more lounging seating, which is where we sat. It was a bit warm but luckily it got slightly cooler as the night progressed. 

We were not too hungry for a big entrée dinner so we all just grabbed some appetizer and one of the girls and I shared an entrée dish, since we needed carbs before a night of drinking.

_Peel & Eat Prawns (We Peel!) ($22) Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce. This pretty much came out like shrimp cocktail. 5 jumbo sized shrimps. They were all fresh and thick, they had a nice bite to it. Served with a cocktail sauce that was sweet and tart. This was good, especially since it was hot outside, but nothing that was really amazing. 
_Smoked Trout Caesar ($18) Little gem, soft cooked farm egg, smoked trout dressing, parmesan, croutons. At first this came out way too over drenched in sauce. Not one lettuce was spared from being dressed free. Although the first taste was good, as the dressing was a bit sweet and earthy, I really dislike when there is too much dressing, as it gets wilted. The waiter was nice to bring another one back, but this time it was dry! Maybe I should have just asked for it on the side because I don't think it can be that hard to know how to correctly dress a salad, that's a good portion and balance. The eggs were cooked perfectly, I did not care too much for the trout, but the overall flavor was good. Nothing special but a solid salad. 
_Local Mixed Greens ($16) Summer vegetables & berries, herb champagne vinaigrette. Colorful and a well sized salad. Refreshing and light. The summer vegetables were just tomatoes, that were fresh. The berries were sweet and tart, and the vinaigrette was a standard sweet and light dressing. Just a salad, nothing to rave about. 
_Whole Fish Ceviche ($27) Branzino, fresno chili, cilantro. This came in a very eye catching and pretty presentation. It was literally the whole fish head and tail on the plate, and the middle sliced into bite size. I can see the art in this as well as the flavor, but for me it was a bit too fishy. The taste had some acidity and tartness to it, but I can taste the fishiness on the back of my palette. 
_Yellowtail Crudo ($23) Grapefruit, avocado, serrano. This should have been pretty good as it's a standard dish, but it was pretty bland. For the price point and a place for seafood, I would have expected more flavor. Maybe some ponzu or something. 
_Wings ($21) Pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce. This was the BEST dish here, and the main reason why my gf wanted to come here as she mentioned she's had this before. It came out in cute little drumstick shapers which was cute and easier to eat, compared to big ones. The seasoning and depth of flavor in this was amazing. It was sweet, tart, spicy, and acidic, but all complementing one another without overpowering one another. The chicken inside was cooked great and was all well distributed. I'm not big on wings, but this I would eat again and again! 
_Spaghetti Ciopinno ($45) San Francisco inspired seafood pasta. I was craving pasta so decided to opt for this. It came with shrimps, scallops, calamari and lobster. Pretty big portion. At first I thought it was bland but the more I ate it, I appreciated the lightness of it. The seafood were all fresh, well cooked and they gave a generous amount, which is always something to look at, especially for the price point. The pasta was well cooked and I love that it had a light tomato sauce to it. I would rather it be a tad under seasoned than overly salty. This was my second fave dish after the wings. 

Overall I love the ambience and vibe more than the food. Out of all the dishes we got, only 2 were the best and stood out. For the price point I would think most should stick out. Some hits and misses but a good restaurant to check out if you are staying at the Aria.",1a60tzkZy_9iruwRZl9nyQ,6,6,4,R-ZHfvQEBV3TxPNtD7uErQ
2376920,2016-09-03,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"First of all, this is a review of the bar and not the restaurant itself.  My friends and I were staying at the Aria and two of us decided to have a drink at the Herringbone which is inside the Aria.  We ordered two drinks and no food.  The drinks were expensive ($16 each) but they were artisan cocktails so it was fine.  They weren't life-changing but they were good.  I left a 2$ tip per cocktail so the total bill (with tax) came to $38.61.  I still have a copy of that bill that I signed.  Upon checking my bank statement, however, I came to find that I was charged $49.74.  Then the real fun begins.  I call the Herringbone and ask to speak to the manager.  Placed on hold....20 minutes later no one has answered.  I hang up and try again.  Then I'm told that if I have an issue with my bill I need to go through the Aria (which is really MGM Resorts International).  I  speak to a customer service representative named Bryan (yes I know his last name but I'm not going to post it here) and I am told on 8-22-16 the following: ""I spoke with Christian, a supervisor at the Herringbone. He will contact you once he locates the signed copy of your receipt and does the necessary research.""  Yeah, that never happened.  I write back to Bryan asking again about this.  He does apologize and takes my cell phone number assuring me that someone will get in touch with me.  That was on 8-25-16.  Have I heard anything back from them?  Big Fat No.  

So you know what?  I'm done with this.  To the Herringbone/Aria I say this:  I hope that $11 was worth it to you.  This was my second time staying at the Aria.  There will not be a third.  In addition, the two friends I was traveling with will also not be staying there in the future.  

On a side note, if you're staying at the Aria don't even think about opening the little refrigerator in the room.  Let's say you walk past it and bump the door with your leg and it opens?  You've just been charged $25.  ......insert eye roll here.......",Rh7-kwp96z8QK0Zw34d9Ww,1,0,1,MNBGJa-yMqllzS34ekm4tA

2422293,2017-06-01,1,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Brunch club is the best thing I've ever had. So controversial as it may be I am not a huge buffet person. While visiting vegas I was looking for a non brunch buffet with a cool outdoor vibe. Luckily I stumbling upon herringbone which pretty much hit the mark for what I was looking for. 

Now their brunch club does have a buffet-esq quality but it's really just 4 ""interactive stations"" set up. They also have a menu of items the kitchen will make for you, this is all included in the cost for the brunch. 

The seafood station is worth the money for the brunch club alone. Delicous raw oysters, huge cocktail shrimp, lobster tail and crab legs. Also featured were several poke and seafood salads. The devil sauce was amazing on the lobster tail. 

From the menu my friend and I split the fish tacos, Loco benny, and chocolate chip pancakes. The tacos were really good. The benny had a great sauce but the egg was sunny side up and way undercooked. The chocolate chip pancakes were rich and a nice dessert alternative. 

The other stations they had were salads, a craving station of meats and also smoked salmon with bagel chips and cream cheese. And a station for desserts.

We also opted for unlimited mimosas for an additional 35 each. This also included Bellinis  (peach or strawberry) and bloody marys. The strawberry bellini was my fave. 

Definitely get a table outside as they had a DJ and it's a really great vibe near the pool. The server was great and very attentive and didn't mind that we were there for awhile.

They use La Marca prosecco for their bottomless options, but you can upgrade to something nicer for a marginal fee. I didn't find it necessary, but you do you. 

Also, the bellinis are delicious too! The peach purée is so good. 

The buffet for brunch has so many seafood options, literally couldn't stop eating. Crawfish, shrimp, seared tuna, crab legs... the works! They also had prime rib (the secret to my heart). Also lots of salad options, waffles, etc.

I get it...I am born and raised in Las Vegas but there are many pretty girls out there that have a personality. First impressions are everything. Food was ok. Nothing like the Herringbones in La Jolla which was amazing! I was hoping to have to the same experience but as you can see from the picture....

The tea wasn't too sweet, it was just right, and the syrup added made the experience even more enjoyable. I then proceeded to the raw hamachi with a pomegranate reduction. Simply delicious and light at the same time. The sauce complemented the raw fish so well, and gave it a different dimension in flavor. For lunch, I had the Two Hand Burger, and boy was it delicious. A perfectly grilled burger with bacon, lettuce, onion marmalade and chipotle aioli. Need I say more? It was a burger unlike any other I had, honestly. Then fro desert, their sundae. By god, marshmallow fluff and chocolate and vanilla ice cream with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. It was delicious and sweet to the bone!

You must order the wings off the menu. The wings have a great spice kick to it and is crispy and flavorful. It is honestly the best wings I have ever had, flavor wise. 

The lemon meringue pastry is a must try dessert! The cream on top pairs perfectly with the cookie on the bottom of the dessert.

We came here with a group of 9 for my friend's bachelorette party. So much on the menu looked incredible. But the fisherman's stew really caught my eye for the variety of fish in it. It had calamari, shrimp, halibut, and mussels. It also had chorizo, which was a good touch! It came with a crostini with this deliciously spicy harissa-esque spread on top. The crostini was the perfect softness for dipping and soaking up all the amazing sauce of the stew.

We got potatoes and cauliflower on the side, which were soooo good. The potatoes were super creamy and cheesy. They were loaded with butter and cheese but it was so worth it. The potatoes came with pancetta, which was the best pancetta I think I have ever had. It was crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and super savory. The cauliflower was also incredible. It had these amazing capers that complemented the vegetable quite nicely.

To top off this amazing meal, they brought us tons of complimentary flatbread to start. AND! They brought us this beautiful tray of desserts, for free, because it was my friend's bachelorette. The staff were so unbelievably kind and helpful, too.

Yellowtail crudo was excellent as was the burrata appetizer.  Had the whole grilled branzino (yes its the whole fish) and the white sea bass, both were excellent as well.  Service was efficient and friendly, and they have a fairly extensive wine list hitting a lot of different price points.

Overall an excellent experience.  So why only 4-stars?  Because this place has succumbed to the pressures of trying to be as hip as possible, so half of their tables are basically coffee tables with arm chairs positioned around them.

They have different types of brunch packages. There is an Al Carte menu which is just for the bar. We got All you can eat brunch which was about $59. This included 4-5 different stations of foods and also you can order as much as you want on the al carte menu. At first we were just going to do the Al Carte menu but decided with the price ranges of the Al Carte menu it would probably be more beneficial if we decided to do the all you can eat. That was a great idea. 

And than there are few different drink packages. We got one that was about $35 and it consisted of all you can drink mimosas, Bellini, and bloody Marys. The other drink packages had premium alcohol and/or champagne on it for higher price.

The different food stations: we had a seafood station that had oysters, crab legs, shrimp, and poke. All delicious and we visited this station the most. They had a dessert station, a fresh salad station, they had a juice station, and a station where they had bagels, steak and salmon. All really good.

From the Al Carte menu we ordered Loco Moco and Fish tacos. Both were soooo delicious. From the juice station they had this bomb juice that had berries, pomegranate, Red Bull and vodka! wow that was so good we had 3 of them. It was safe to say that we left that place in a good mood!

I am super selective with my food and with service so the bestowing of 5 stars is certainly indicative of ""high praise"". This is my new boo go-to spot. The front of the restaurant is not where the action is for me, but certainly is cool to walk through. Hidden off the right shoulder of the inner sanctum of Herribone's is THE PATIO. And I call it THE PATIO because it carries its own. The patio is where perfect date night conversation, romantic interludes of sweet nothings, or a secret hideaway with your new Vegas love can line up with the stars. This too is where my evening of wonderment began. 

The atmosphere was already set when we walked through the door for sure as it is the perfect setting for after work cocktails or dinner with colleagues.  BUT being taken to THE PATIO was like stubbling upon a secret garden. From the outside, you would never know it was there. Service was hitting on all cylinders from the Hostess to the various Servers who appeared at our beck and call. Yep, I'm feeling kinda important in this place and I like it!

We tried a variety of appetizers of which the tuna salad baguette was my absolute fave! I kept ordering them until my companion finally snatched the last one off the plate....... suggesting that I slowly walk away. No kidding and all jokes aside, this was the best tuna salad EVER! It was made from fresh tuna and complementing ingredients. The fresh lemon flavor set it off quite nicely.

As for the main courses, the Salmon perfectly cooked (moist) and was served with asparagus. The chicken was served with pan drippings and was nicely done as they serve Mary's free range chicken.....a sure sign that quality lives all over this restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised, but not overly shocked as this was the Aria Hotel.....this food is what you would come to expect from a gem like Aria.

The service made the evening just perfect! Nothing was off and everything was fabulous. The attentiveness of our Server (s), the atmosphere, the food....what more could one ask for in a city of many choices like Vegas?? Sometimes business and personal travel dining can be hit and miss, but this one goes on the list of best places to dine in Vegas. And this is from someone who eats out often. I was very pleased and will return soon (perhaps for brunch) for certain. I was so IMPRESSED that I plan to review the restaurant in an upcoming issue of the magazine I publish as well.

We went for a noon brunch and left around 4:30pm.  You heard that correctly, a truly everlasting brunch for 4.5 hours and constantly getting refills.  We were never judged, never shunned, and always had full glasses.  Stupendous service.  We sat outside and there really wasn't any of a crowd considering it was primetime Sunday.  We ordered the breakfast nachos and the loco moco (beef with eggs and rice).  We wanted to take a different route with brunch this time so stayed away from the typical omelette or benedict.  The nachos were very good - soft yet not damp.  The beans and runniness of the eggs really gave it a nice flavor and the dish spiced just to our liking.  The loco moco was a very interesting dish as rice is not my first thought when it comes to brunch.  It came with a freshly prepared wagyu steak and 2 eggs over a bed of rice.  The beef itself was perfect and the sauce was a tasty thick sauce; perfect to start the morning.  Add in some fresh bread and we were in heaven.  The bellinis were super strong and always fresh.  I liked the strawberry-yuzu better than the peach, but they allow you to go back and forth so no worries if you can't make up your mind.  And we ended with a nice raspberry cheesecake with mango sorbet.  A perfect, filling meal.

The waiters were great at giving us privacy yet still knowing when to be heard.  The only issue there was the process of getting extras such as tobasco sauce or a new napkin.  The process always involved multiple waiters passing along the request like telephone so it did take a few minutes longer than normal.

We sat out on the deck which was perfect as the weather held up nicely.  There was a DJ who had the music on a bit too loud, but it wasn't STK volume just a little too high.  It is outside near the pool so maybe they just set the level and leave it there all year even when the pool is closed for the season.

One of the best brunches in Vegas hands down.  And it's also a nice change from your typical French variety brunch.  Still has an upscale, loungy feel with great food, but a nice change to the menu offerings.  Give Herringbone a try if you are a brunch fanatic.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,5,WKvsPNV3V-AxjFSifaOWAQ

I had the chilean seas bass, it was very good.  a nice chunky filet with a tasty sauce plated. $45
Wife had the branzino; perfectly grilled she loved it; ditto on the price.
Oysters (12pc) were great but quite overpriced, $50+ including tax, not worth it. Shouldnt be more than 35 bucks, but hey its the LV.
Tuna poke with nori chips was delish, also coming in at a hefty 25 bucks for a small/medium portion.
Death by potatoes= another appetizzy, its just mashed potatoes with thick cut cubed bacon (not a fan of taste or texture) but the rest was good tasting.

My  husband and I have traveled all over the place and have had our share of really good seafood. This place is one of the better places that we have been to (especially considering that there is no ocean nearby). This is hands down the best seafood place we have eaten in Las Vegas.

We used Open Table to make a reservation, as we were not sure how busy it would be. It was a good thing that we did. This place filled up once we were seated (and I understand why!) 

We were here for dinner.... The starters / apps all looked so good that we opted to split 2 of them and split one main dish. We started off with some of the freshest and tastiest Tuna Poke that we have ever had. The serving size was actually more than we were expecting, as well. Our main dish that we split was the sea bass. It was cooked perfectly! We didn't plan on getting dessert here, but we did. We got the chocolate sea salt and caramel (it has chocolate sauce, candied hazelnuts, chocolate crumble, and Nutella gelato).. I'm not a big fan of chocolate but my husband is. I had just a few bites, and it actually worked and wasn't a full overload of chocolate. My husband was happy to eat the rest of it by himself, once I couldn't do any more.

The staff were all very knowledgeable and super friendly. I can see why this place keeps getting such good reviews.

We also had the crab cake poppers ($19) and the clam chowder ($14). Both were just ok. If crab cake is what you are looking for, go to Brian Malarkey's other restaurant Searsucker in Caesars. I had the best crab cake there.

The grilled chicken sandwich ($18) was underwhelming. Ora king salmon ($34) was cooked perfectly but the sweet sauce that it comes with ruined it for me. I just don't think sweet goes with salmon. For about the same price, I would rather have gotten another order of the lobster.

I did have a really good non-alcoholic drink here. It was called Umbrella Not Included ($8). It was a mix of pineapple, pomegranate, lime, orgeat and ginger ale. One of the better mocktails I've had.

My Husband is a Bar and restaurant  owner and we understand the business. We spent several weeks scoping out where to eat New Years Eve, bc Vegas has so many options. Made reservations a month in advance after seeing the Menu and calling. When we saw sea bass on the menu we picked here. Reservations were at 745. Upon arrival out table was not ready , no big deal finally got sat at 8:20. Tried to sit us outside with temps around 35 degrees, so we asked to move in and all they had was a low couch and coffee table, still no big deal it was right behind the Dj and in my opinion music was not to loud, as others wrote in reviews. This was a 5 course meal, for 150.00 per person. First 3 courses came out fast 10 minutes maybe in between, everyone around us was being served their entrees , so 45 minutes later we finally asked where our main entree was, she checked and said any minute. About 5 minutes later they brought our main dish. One was snapper and one was tuna. Had to call the server back over and we said this is not Sea Bass, a different server came over and said yeah we are out so we just made this. WAIT! WHAT!, by the way its now 9:45 and we have not eaten yet and they close at 10pm. I have never seen a restaurant run out of something and not tell you and just bring what they feel like. I hate TUNA and Snapper. We ordered all our food at 8:30 pm, why is it that at 9:45 we have to ask where our food is and now they don't have any. We asked for a manger and the waitress said he will be right over. We waited half hour he never showed to our table. We than left , never had our Dinner .

I ordered the shrimp ceviche nothing special I've had better. My boyfriend ordered the tuna poke which was good but the fried tortilla chips that came with it was greasy and chewy so we asked for crackers instead. To drink i had a michealada which wasn't very good either. The one I ordered at the pool outside was way better.",aPsXvSnP0FeNshnNJzo9Rg,2,1,3,xmCE7qoEUYKuBpw8HZtwlA

3526995,2018-06-04,2,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Buyer beware. The $59 all-you-can-eat weekend brunch does NOT include coffee and orange juice. It's $4/coffee and $8/orange juice, making your actual total $71 plus tax and tip, assuming you like coffee and OJ with brunch.

Which is ludicrous because:

1. Coffee costs them what, 10 cents? So to upcharge for coffee but not for say, the shrimp or salmon that's part of the buffet, is just tacky.

2. The coffee arrives at the END of your meal, not the beginning, as was the case with our lackluster service.

3. The buffet includes fresh-squeezed watermelon juice and berry smoothies, but they decided to charge extra for the one staple that most people want, orange juice, instead of just placing it in the section already containing the other juices/smoothies.

As someone who's studied pricing extensively, the whole thing felt like pricing manipulation designed to lure you in with the $59 price point while hoping to get $71 out of you. For most people who want a higher-end brunch and want to avoid the longer lines at the regular hotel buffet, the $59 price is just within the threshold of still feeling comfortable, but $71 is above that threshold, so they sneakily withhold coffee and OJ from the buffet to extract that extra money out of you.",vkRzuJVWhv3yppDc5RZEJQ,2,0,2,ZVBEDDbiExpQkMqlDdZBTA

3600028,2018-06-18,4,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Best. Brunch. Buffet. Of. My. Life. 

Literally. 

And that's saying something...I've had my fair share of brunch buffets. So often, buffets try to compensate for quality with quantity. Not so at Herringbone!

They offer the brunch buffet on Saturdays and Sundays. It's a hybrid where there are several buffet stations and then you can also order small plates (which weren't all that small) from a menu. 

I spent most of my calories at the seafood station, which had chilled crab legs, lobster tail, oysters, shrimp, tuna poké, and ceviche loaded with avocado (ask for a side of chips) with a few different sauce options. 

There was a carving station with a variety of meats--my favorite was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, which was a special. In a totally genius move, they served smoked salmon with bagel chips instead of bagels (all the flavor, less filler) and the cream cheese had salmon and herbs in it--so good. 

Omelet bar looked great, but I wasn't about to waste precious stomach space on eggs. 

Pre-prepared waffles and a variety of toppings (fresh berries, syrup, etc.) looked good, but I skipped them because I'm a total snob about pancake syrup...I'll only eat actual maple syrup. 

I absolutely loved the veggie/salad station, which had 5-6 different prepared options, all of which were excellent. The Caesar salad was amazing. I loved having some produce to offset the vast amounts of seafood and pastries I was consuming. 

The small plates we ordered were all excellent, with the exception of one. The loco moco benny was delicious, french fries (that aioli--yum yum) were great, sliders were ultra flavorful, but the absolute star was the wings. Best wings I've ever eaten. Perfectly crisp and complemented with a fantastic sweet and spicy sauce. I could eat those all day long. Next time I'll definitely skip the pancakes (orange ricotta chocolate chip). They weren't bad, but totally not worth it. They were just plain pancakes with a sprinkling of toppings. Worst part was that, despite being described as coming with ""tree sap"" (hip speak for maple syrup, I guess?), they were served with fake syrup. Deal breaker. 

I opted to add the $35 unlimited prosecco package (it wasn't advertised but it was La Marca) and they kept a steady supply of bellinis in front of me. They also have the option to do Veuve Clicquot (more) or Moët (even more)--each package includes mimosas, bellinis, prosecco/Champagne, and/or bloody marys. 

So often a decent brunch buffet falls apart at dessert--the focus is more on treats that look beautiful instead of taste good. Every single pastry we tried was great. I especially loved the chocolate dipped strawberries (hard to mess up, but nice they offer them as an option). 

At $59 a person, this buffet is more than worth it!",bGPaNsTLxN6n4kbQwCPkew,9,7,5,0JhsK02fVqZAe_Y9a4cYTQ

We came around 6:30ish on a Saturday and it was pretty dead. The hostesses told us they had a private event and won't be seating in the dining area until 10 pm, so we decided to sit at the bar. During this whole interaction with them, I couldn't help but think how a new-ish restaurant could put such rude, unprofessional staff at the front of the house. First impression FAIL.

The only decent part about this restaurant was the food. Everything else was just a huge disappointment... you are nothing without service!

Anyway, we ordered:
x Roasted Mushrooms (Cipollini Onions, Herbs) - probably my favorite of the night. 
x Spanish Octopus (Salsa Verde, Roasted Red Pepper, Preserved Lemons) - bursting with flavor and so tender. Super good with the cheesy bread, but almost better separately.
x Yellowtail (Sweet Mango, Jalapeño Salsa, Radish, Micro Greens) - BLAND. The fish was very dry.. needed some sort of citrus or liquid component.
x Lobster Tortellini (Squid Ink Pasta, Soffritto) - another bland/dry dish. I was super excited to splurge on some unneeded calories, but this failed me :( The tortellini itself felt under cooked and the sauce was lacking in flavor.

Small party of 3, late seating, horrible service, ran out of food and lost our wine, then after the abysmal service they forced $100 gratuity on us. The food also isn't really on par with what they are charging here. I know it's the Aria but I get better food for half the price and 10x better service from my local spots. 

30+minutes late seating our reservation because they couldn't find someone to clear tables. I spoke to the reception several times and pointed to empty tables. It wasn't busy, the rush passed. They kept saying 5 minutes. We finally get seated and right off the bat we find out they are out of the highlight dishes on the price fixed menu. So we ordered a bottle of wine while thinking over the few choices we did have. Well they Could not find the wine we ordered, waited half an hour for drinks. I asked the waitress several times what was going on, didnwe need to just order cocktails or something. Waitress completely uninterested in helping us. Just said they sent a runner and he would be there soon. He wasn't. I had to find the manager who found something for us quickly. During dinner they Messed up the order and brought us the wrong items. Ran out of the sides on the menu so they did an auto sub without asking. Brought me my friends steak which he ordered medium and he got my rare one but it was so dark we didn't notice until we each took a bite. The waitress was hardly ever at the table. The manager did come by to top up our wine. 

The food was good but what really ruined things was the added $100 gratuity on a party of 3. The service was obviously not good. It was horrible. So we ended up paying $600 for 3 people to get ok food we didn't want and horrible service.

Everyone seemed pretty on top of each other, seeing as there wasn't much room to walk in between, but then we opted to sit outside (it was just opened up).

Outside was gorgeous. I could spend all day and night there. The ambiance was relaxing, cool and casual. Palm trees and spray misters surrounded the whole rooftop and it was so relaxing that I di not want to leave. Not to mention that since it was so hot out in the middle of July, no one opted to sit outside except for maybe two other couples that we shared the roof with. I'll say it again, gorgeous. 

Our dinners were divine. They have a strict Ocean-to-Table menu mindset. We were excited to get our seafood fix here for our vacation. I got something on special, a branzino with some arugula seafood salad. I hadn't had this type of fish yet and it was very flavorful. My boyfriend indulged in Sea Bass all week long and he took advantage of their specialty here. Fantastic and light. But surprisingly the star of the dinner would have to be those potatoes. Our waiter was very excited to pair our dinners with a side of these potatoes because he impressed upon us that they would pair very nicely with both of our choices of dinners..and oh it did. Those potatoes, there wasn't a spot left in that bowl of potatoes. And to be honest, I probably could have ate another bowl if they brought us another. That good.

* Wings
* Brussels & Pecans
* Duck Fat Fries

We were seated at one of their lounge style chairs and table.  The patio was not yet opened because of the cold weather.  Having lunch that lasted about 3 hours, it got a little tiresome for me leaning forward and reaching down to get food from the coffee table.  I can see for a dinner or some drinks and a little food, this would be fine.  

Chef Bernardo brought out/sent out several seafood dishes to start the lunch.  After an auspicious start with crostini topped with uni, sea salt, and lardo, we were brought three kinds of oysters and then an oyster shooter. I was impressed by the chef's relating how quickly the oysters were gotten to the restaurant.  The Naked Cowboy shooter with crab and caviar was especially good with the salt of the caviar adding to the flavor of the oyster.

After this, several seafood dishes were brought from hamachi crudo to escolar sashimi to big eye tuna, and tuna belly.  This was some of the freshest seafood I've had in Las Vegas.  The dishes were very creative too.  A standout here was the Poke with macadamia nuts, crispy onions, togarashi, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, and Shoju with green onion pancakes.  What a great combination of flavors.  There were other dishes each worthy of mention but I will lack space to name them all.

We then moved to the hot dishes with Thai chicken wings, onion soup, bacon and eggs ravioli, branzino, Grandma's meatballs with pork neck ragu, sea bass tails and belly, and a vegetable medley of carrots, French beans, and broccoli rabe.  I am known for not eating wings.  These are so good and done so well, they're a delight and I'd go back solely for them.  The onion soup with its pretzel crouton and gruyere cheese ravioli was also a big winner.  I also have to mention the sea bass tails and belly.  Excellent!

Moving on to desserts, we were served Adult Root Beer floats made with Not Your Father's Root Beer (5.9% alcohol) with vanilla bean and cinnamon ice cream.  My float was made with Coke and there were gingersnaps served with the floats.  Along with this we had turtle cheesecake, carrot cake with pineapple sorbet, and salted caramel panna cotta. A double espresso over ice was an additional enjoyment to the sweets!

Service was excellent!  My iced tea glass was constantly replaced with a fresh one and water was added to glasses often.  

Some of the items we had are not on the menu but may be when it's finalized--we were trying them out.

SERVICE 
Uneven yet accommodating. They accommodated a special request to make a salad into a sandwich. Even through end result was questionable, the effort is appreciated. They also gave a free dessert for the off-peak lunch order taking almost an hour to come out. Hostesses and roaming managers always super engaging and friendly. 

FOOD
Tomato/Avo Salad: craving some texture, so asked to put on a wrap or sandwich if possible. What I got was half a salad on a butter toasted hamburger bun. I mean, OK, I asked for something done off menu but also said is fine if chef can't do it or thinks a bad idea. Paying $20 for an entree salad which amounted to a side salad on a bun was not particularly inspiring. Food was decent, just an awkward interaction all around. 

Dining companion had the lunch box with tomato/avo salad and lobster roll. He was a big fan.

My girlfriends ordered a myriad of things and our bill ended up being nearly $500. But due to my diet restrictions, I only tried 2 dishes.

Oysters - Delicious! This was my first time trying oysters EVER (my friends literally bullied me into it) and I was like oh, oysters are pretty good! I have since had them at several other places so I can say the ones at Herringbone and very fresh-tasting. Also I really liked the kimchee salsa they are served with. They also come with apple mignonette, lemon, Tabasco, and spicy cocktail sauce.

White Sea Bass - I ordered this because I did my research on Yelp first and this dish received rave reviews. The server also recommended it. It was good but far from amazing. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked and the dish simply isn't memorable at all. I wouldn't order this again.

The numerous other dishes ordered by my friends (Death by Potatoes, Whole Fish Ceviche, Herb Fries, etc) were enjoyed by all of them. We also had an awesome waitstaff that brought us out a free round of shots and a surprise birthday dessert for my friend, also free of charge. Even though it was a great experience, I'm not dying to come back for some reason. It must be because I didn't like my entree too much. If I return, I'll try the scallops!

Everything was delish, especially the smaller appetizer-like dishes - but entrees were a miss. My friend strongly recommended the lighter fare like brunch on the patio (the menu is different) - so I would love to give this place another try on my next visit.

Ordered:
Whole fish ceviche
Grilled Baby Octopus
Meatballs (the server couldnt stop praising about)
Wings
Seafood Spaghetti
Mary's Roasted Chicken

-----------------------------------
Favs (if i can pick):

Whole Fish Ceviche - so delicious but be warned of the small portion - felt more like a carpaccio (the sliced raw fish pieces are presented like a whole fish hence the name) rather than a typical ceviche where everything is chopped up and mixed. All the ingredients and the sauce come together like a delicacy.

Octopus - most deliciously charred. Those r not decorations - its the perfect finishing to the plate.
-------------------------------------
Miss:

Seafood Spaghetti for $45 - most expensive dish on the menu, I presume because of the lobster, crab, scallops etc etc.   I really think my dish was missing lobster - I was too dumbfounded like ""they couldnt have possibly left out an ingredient"" - so I didn't ask. To this day, I question it (u can see my picture)

But overall, no visible lobster meat (i didnt see any red) and 1 giant scallop (seriously?) = not worth $45 for a pasta. I think the chef was ready to call it a night.

p.s. The pasta noodles are mixed black and white - at $45, Im thinking its pasta made from squid ink *shrug*",WIfREdU61FU2D4HxI5JGzw,0,0,4,lS6R7iODed4UZkpT1rTudA

Ambiance- Herringbone has such a fun atmosphere, you are seated outside but even though it was a cooler evening my fiance and I were very comfortable- we got just enough of the breeze without getting cold. We walked by during the day and it looked like a really fun place to sit and eat lunch also! 
Service- Our waitress was very nice, she took us through the menu, made suggestions about what to order and even struck up a conversation with us! She definitely made the dinner a good time. 
Food- this is where this restaurant unfortunately falls short. I had the baby kale salad which was actually quite good- the vinaigrette was tasty and the salad had a nice mix of flavors. My fiance had the onion soup (not what I would have picked at a seafood place) and it was just okay- not very flavorful and perhaps a little bit too much of a stretch from the classic (they put noodles in it and it didn't have that fatty hunk of melted cheese on top). For dinner we ordered the Sea Bass which was very very bland, the brussels sprouts which were way too sweet, and the death by potatoes which were very delicious.

I don't know why it took us so long to give Herringbone a try, but now that we have, we will definitely go back!  Make reservations if you plan to go for dinner, and be sure to request a table on the patio if it's not 937 degrees outside.  There is a large bar to grab a drink at if you have to wait, and service there was quick and friendly.  We noticed several people having dinner at the bar, so if the wait is super long for a table, I would definitely consider doing that, too.

The hostess was friendly and found our reservation quickly, so we were showed to our table on the patio right after we walked in.  The ambiance on the patio is so nice and unlike the other restaurants located in the Aria, we definitely want to go back and try brunch there.  The manager came over and took our drink order because our server was in the weeds, but after that initial greet, our server did an excellent job of taking care of us.

We were dining late, so we decided to share a few small plates, and with the layout of the menu, dining that way was perfect (I would recommend two appetizers/small plates per person if sharing).  Of everything we had we LOVED the oysters!!!  The variety was unique, the quality was outstanding (bright & briny!), and the kimchee mignonette was different, but refreshing and delicious.  If you love oysters, this is one of the best places we have tried in Vegas to get them.  The other standout dish we had was the Baja Shrimp Cocktail, which was so much more than just your average shrimp cocktail.  It was full of huge pieces of plump shrimp and creamy avocado - and of course came with a Coronita to really make the flavors pop!  A side of boardwalk fries paired well with both dishes, but I guess what doesn't taste good with french fries? :)

My only issue with this restaurant was the wait time for the check and our receipt to sign at the end of the meal ( more than 25 minutes total).  Other than that, it was fabulous and we cannot wait to go back!

We started off with specialty drinks (they have a spruced up Moscow mule with rhubarb and strawberry deliciousness). We then ordered the ""Dingy"": a size-able platter of fresh crab, shrimp and oysters that comes with six amazing sauces for your delight. We also had the ahi tuna poke and some other sushi appetizer: all of it was tasty. To keep the seafood extravaganza going, I ordered the scallops with butternut squash risotto and balsamic glaze. They were cooked just right and melted in my mouth. My friend ordered the sea bass and got a very nice portion. We finished with a dessert whose name I can't recall but it was similar to cheesecake with a raspberry garnish and chocolate shavings. The presentation on everything was fantastic. Chef Nick and various others came to our table and thanked us for dining with them. Lastly, the service was probably the best I've experienced on the strip. I tend to drink quite a bit of soda water, quickly. I never had to ask for a refill-they were provided before my glass was low enough to notice.   The only thing I didn't like was that there were no salt/pepper shakers. Sounds silly, but I love salt (extra) and was kind of afraid to ask for it-given the fact the chefs cook to perfection, and I just tend to prefer salty. Oh, and then there's the co$t factor: this place is quite extravagant and pricey, to say the least.

We were seated inside at one of the lounge areas which included a couch, table, and two chairs. It was a unique way to do the seating for brunch, but I enjoyed it.

We started with one of the featured cocktails and Maple Bourbon Bacon. The cocktail was much larger than the typical cocktail and was plenty for my husband and I to share since we aren't big drinkers. The Maple Bourbon Bacon was awesome. The bacon was tasty and crispy. We loved the bruleed banana and banana mousse on the side. It was interesting dish that they pulled off well.

My main included Brulee Grapefruit and Crab Cake Benny. The grapefruit was unique and tasty. I liked the sugary layer on the grapefruit which made the fruit taste a bit decadent. The Crab Cake Benny was delicious with a nice amount of crab and nicely prepared poached eggs.

My husband had the Bacon & Egg Ravioli. He thought it was okay, but nothing special. It was also only two pieces of ravioli which wasn't enough food for the cost of the dish. The pancetta was hard to find in the dish since they used so little. I wouldn't recommend this dish.

We ordered a bottle of wine from the menu and it was out (No problem we'll get something else). The waiter brought over a few samples to try of what the had and then disappeared.

She came back after talking to the manager for 10 min saying that she can sit us at the lounge area, and that the main floor is reserved for ""special"" people. I guess we were not special enough for her, so we turned around  to leave.

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas to celebrate our 2 year anniversary and on one of the nights while we were there, we wanted to go out to a fancy dinner.  As we were walking through Aria during the day, we fell upon Herringbone.  We made a 6:30pm reservation and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.

Appetizer - Wings:  The waiter mentioned that their Hot Fare and Cold Fare dishes were small but when the wings came out - there were 12 pieces and it was DELICIOUS.  A bit spicy - but overall tasty and my boyfriend and I finished them all.

Main Dishes - Chilean Sea Bass and the Lamb Chops:  The sea bass had the right amount of sweet and spicy.  The sauce was a coconut sauce which was my favorite.  The stir fry vegetables were cooked perfectly and matched well with the fish.  The lamb chops was a special on the menu and this was probably the best dish of the night.  My boyfriend asked for the lamb chops to be medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  The added touch of the radish sauce was perfect.  Both dishes were quite big and filling.  You would think that since it was a fancy restaurant the dishes would be small - but Herringbone got it right.  It was a great large portion for the price.  

Side dish - ""Death by Potatoes:""  It was practically mashed potatoes with bacon as an added topping.  The potatoes had a perfect texture and it was a nice touch to both of our main dishes.  

We sat outside - which had a very nice ambiance.  (And had outdoor heaters -- which was very helpful since it was a bit chilly that night!)

It does take two hands, and the ability to unhinge your jaw it's so tall. It also loses all structural integrity after a few bits, so the more fastidious will need to resort to fork and knife.

There was some confusion with my order, and they were very apologetic about it and brought me a complimentary shrimp cocktail and glass of champagne! Between the salad, burger, fries, and extras it was all way too much food but the gesture was much appreciated.

We came here for my friends birthday and the food was pretty good! The restaurant is dimly lit with a full bar + sports tv. 
The prices were pretty fair for the food that we got. 
I got the San Francisco inspired Cioppino and the portion was enormous! I highly highly recommend this dish because it includes a generous amount of seafood: lobster, shrimp, scallops, and calamari. 
This dish was too big of a portion so maybe you can share this and another dish. Overall I was pretty satisfied! 
The service was below average but we were in a rush anyway. Don't expect great service here because it's a pretty casual restaurant.",VUhZCfChpTSiO8TkmSn18g,3,2,4,TQJCwdkwBJ_aaXLe208Nug

Everything including the atmosphere, the service, food and cocktails is such a fabulous place to dine on the strip. A couple things that stuck out I would have to say were the watermelon salad with feta cheese, arugula and tomatoes, the brussels and pecans, and the whole grilled Branzino. The salad was very light and refreshing. I wouldn't say I normally like fruit in my salad, but everything complimented each other and made it delicious. I'm on this brussel sprout kick right now, so as soon as I saw those on the menu I had to try them and they were perfect. I loved that they were the right amount of crispy, the pecans were in the mix and whatever sauce the chef used was really good. Truly the best brussel sprouts I have tried yet. I only eat fish and I feel like I've tried my fair share, but it always seems like I usually get caught up in ordering the salmon or the sea bass. This time I told myself I'd try something new, so I ordered the Branzino. Such a great choice and I'm so glad I decided to try something different.

Plus, they didn't have the lobster Baja....which I see on the menu now.  If they have it, it's an absolute must!  Also ordered the wings which were amazing....the meat basically fell off the bone and was super flavorful.  Another must have is the whole fish ceviche (assuming you enjoy raw fish).

4908508,2017-12-31,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"I was looking forward to this place (like many others here) but it felt like a miss to me. 
We walked in and we're seated right away at a great table - a party of 11. The reason for the 3 stars is while we sat down at 12:40 for lunch, our main courses came after 2 pm. No one really came to check on us or let us know when food is coming. No one even said sorry it's taking so long, is there anything I can do for you? 
We ordered 2 soups and I got the lunch box with small salad and choice of ""main"".  
Things I liked: the ""no umbrellas"" drink (no alcohol) but that the cup was full of ice, and it was $8 for juice. I also really liked their take on the Caesar salad with smoked trout. 
Things I didn't like: I got the chicken sandwich with tomato and burrata. The sandwich overall was pretty bland and my chicken was charred to death. I mean it was bad. But food took 1.5 hrs and I couldn't wait for something else. Also the 3 hours of indigestion that followed lead me to believe that while the sandwich was charred, it may not have been cooked all the way through. 
More bad: I didn't like that there were no ""brunch"" items on the menu. What I really didn't like is that as a seafood restaurant, the only seafood option I saw was the seafood tower. The other options were a burger, a nasty chicken sandwich, tacos that people at our table didn't enjoy, and something else uninspired. 
So slow slow slowwwww service plus mediocre food plus prices that are way too high make for a place I don't want to try again. Sorry guys, there are way better restaurants and brunch places in Vegas.",DjctZj2M46j5g2i25-5FFw,2,0,2,ETGdVVb-RIj3KwfGNSAyFQ

4924676,2017-02-27,4,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Just landed in Vegas and Herringbone was our first stop - was super convenient since we could walk to it from our hotel. It was also Super Bowl Sunday. This review is for the 'ALL YOU CAN EAT, BIG GAME EATS' menu that went on that day. 

For $75 each, we had access to AYCE for the duration of the game. 

Food included:
Unlimited poke bar (with all the extras)
Peel & eat prawns - Mexican white prawns, sambal cocktail sauce
Nachos - chicken, queso, tortilla chips, black beans, tomato salsa, guacamole, scallions
Pigs in a blanket (with house ketchup & mustard)
Wings - pickled cucumber & carrots, chili, cilantro, garlic, peanut sauce
Meatballs - Nana's pork gravy, whipped ricotta, parsley
Bobby's sliders - kobe beef, aged cheddar, grilled onions
Boardwalk fries - old bay, malt vinegar aioli, ketchup, herbs
Mexican street corn - chipotle aioli, scallions, cotija, cilantro

Boyfriend really wanted to see the game and eat, so I went along with his choice of restaurant and the menu had food I was fine with. There was no wait as we walked in and got seated. The atmosphere was loud with tons of guys chattering and drinking. Dozens of flat screen tvs were all over the walls. I guess Vegas has these AYCE buffets specifically during the big game cause it makes the whole event really fun/exciting. There was a deal for drinks going on and since my bf ordered one - he got put into some lottery and the hostesses kept giving him free Jack Daniels stuff lol that was cool I guess. He got some stickers, lip balm, and a necklace.

I liked the idea of the poke bar, and there were tortilla chips too! They had the raw seafood all laid out in the back of the restaurant. The tako (octopus) tasted a lil better than the poke (fish). Poke was mushy and soft - like it wasn't fresh or it was just sitting/marinating in sauce for too long. The shrimps were awesome though. Good size, crunchy, and tasted great dipped with ketchup. I also enjoyed the tomatoes and cucumbers - definitely helped to clear that fishy taste in my mouth in preparation for the rest of food on the menu. 

I did not care for the corn, fries, nor the wings. The corn was covered in a lot of stuff and had waaay too much going on. Expected it to have tons of flavor but it just tasted dry with NO taste. Fries were okay. The wings were too spicy for me. My boyfriend liked the wings the most, and he also ended up eating the rest of the food. 

My favorites were the pigs in a blanket and the sliders for sure. I think I was so hungry that I just really craved meat at the moment and all the other appetizers were not cutting it for me. Pigs in a blanket was nothing special...but it was filling. That's all I wanted. Tasted like regular mini hotdogs with ketchup and mustard. The sliders were AMAZING. Don't know what sauce the patty was covered in, but it was delicious. Wanted to eat more sliders but I couldn't..was too stuffed from just one. #smallstomachproblems 

Wish we didn't order the nachos cause I wasn't expecting them to come in a large bowl. Honestly we just wanted to try a little bit of everything and went crazy ordering. Couldn't finish that along with the meatballs. The meatballs were gooOod, and we ended up taking that and the wings back to the hotel. The nachos were different and not to our liking. They didn't use regular melted cheddar cheese and the chicken was cold while everything else was kind of warm? It just didn't mix well together. I enjoyed a couple first bites of the nachos, but then I got tired of the taste later. 

If we were more hungry, I think the AYCE deal would have been worth it. But my boyfriend and I agreed that for what we paid, we did not get our money's worth. That always seems like the case for these types of situations regarding buffets/AYCE. We just came for the convenience, fast service and the game.... not for the price or food. Probably should have came to Herringbone for their regular breakfast/lunch/dinner hours and maybe then we'd feel like we actually got what we paid for.",29XxHvrJAyvuRaPXu_h-QA,14,16,3,oQiObxCedqExFh_WQqNU7g

5094853,2016-01-29,15,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Antisocial?  Eat somewhere else.

Imagine lounging around with your closest friends on a cool Cali evening, sipping cocktails and being served fresh and vibrant bites the ""help"".   Now drop that into a Vegas mega resort and you have Herringbone.  Billed as ""social dining"", just think comfy lounge, with sofas and plush seats surrounding low tables forcing conversation.  

Before continuing, ""Hey, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone"".  Don't be that douche.  Nothing screams, I don't know how to interact with live humans like bringing out your mobile.  Try it and watch eyes roll.

Summary: great vibe, great ambiance, OK food.  Being honest, in a social setting, the food is not the center of attention.  It just needs to be good enough not to offend.  Solid, not stellar.  That said, it meets expectations.

In general, ingredients are fresh and treated simply.  Flavors are vibrant.  No heavy sauces.  All dishes are meant to be shared.  Think finger foods eaten over a cocktail napkin.  

The oyster sampling is fun and the chilled seafood tower OK (perfectly cooked lobster, slightly overcooked shrimp) but those can be had anywhere.

Focus instead on a very good salmon rillettes.  Warm smoked salmon mixed with crème fraiche and clarified butter and chives paired with a tangy lemon curd.  Perfect when spread on the grilled bread.  

Not to be out shown, the scallop ceviche.  Sweet, tender scallops in a sesame ponzu sauce with tobiko (flying fish roe).  The earthiness of the sesame and very bright citrusy taste of the yuzu greatly enhances the oceanic sweetness of the scallops.  Lavosh accompanies the dish but dive bombing is the best way to enjoy it.

Finally the poke.  Simple cubes of hamachi, Maui onions, grated ginger, garlic, scallions, and crushed macadamia nuts.  Yuzu, soy, and shichimi pepper rounds out the seasoning.  Great complexity with the oil from the macadamia nuts adding a great nutty flavor.  Very clean finish with just the right amount of spicy heat.  The scallion pancakes make the perfect vehicle to get this into your eagerly awaiting mouth.

Friendly, casual but efficient service.

Interesting selection of craft cocktails and half bottle service.  Well chosen wine list.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.

Note:  This restaurant is very busy.  High level mLife members, make reservations through the mLife site to guarantee seating.

Service was impeccable, I mean really awesome servers, hostess, all of it was great. 

The food here was nothing short of perfect. I don't believe I would add/subtract a thing from the dishes we ordered.

Dozen kumamoto oysters - 5 STARS is an understatement. Absolutely without a doubt the best oysters my bf and I have ever had. We both fell in love with the kimchi sauce they provided us with, but seriously these things didn't even need lemon they were amazing on their own. 

Fish tacos - 5 STARS. We got a grilled and a fried and I gotta say I preferred the grilled. Mahi Mahi was cooked perfectly in both types of tacos. Oh and because we waited a little long for our food we were sent out an additional taco, awesome. 

The Dinghy - 4 STARS. Half lobster, King crab legs, 2 jumbo prawns, 4 oysters. All of the items were fresh and flavorful, but a little pricey for what you get.

5224849,2017-02-03,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Herringbone has been on my radar for a long time and I finally got to try it this past weekend for lunch.  I must say that my initial reaction to their menu was shock... it is not quite ""American"" only, which is what makes Herringbone amazing.  As I researched for places to eat, I noticed that Herringbone was marketed as an American seafood restaurant, which to be honest does not sound exciting to me.  But the truth is that this place is a fusion restaurant with dishes from all over the world.  We had the Hamachi, beef tartare with truffle, chilaquiles, ceviche, moco loco, lobster roll, and a few other things that I can't remember right now.  The Hamachi and ceviche were out of this world.  Chilaquiles was beautiful, but taste wise it was ok.  Lobster roll was great.  We inquired about mussels since I had seen those in Yelp but it wasn't on the menu.  The waitress asked the chef if they could do mussels during lunch and he said yes.  However, we decided that we didn't want mussels in the end... so to our surprise, the chef came out with a dish of mussels and said it was on the house since they had already started preparing it before we decided we didn't want mussels.  Chef was super nice and the waitress was as well.  Overall, I was very happy with my experience and the food.  Definitely a place I would try over and over again.",hC-CU3NM3Ffxcb2rMbPuuA,0,0,5,-TJnkq_pz4nvrd64afBXyQ

Enjoyed the majority of the brunch items that were out for self-serve, but think one whole stand dedicated to sweets is a bit much.

We ordered them and about 5-7 mins later the waiter said the kitchen was working on them - they came out soon after and the chips were soggy and cold ..?? Also disappointed that coffee wasn't included in the big ticket price for the brunch. Besides the raw bar, not really worth the price.

5279345,2018-05-08,2,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"It has been jokingly stated that Chefs in Las Vegas are like gypsies in terms of their migration and with the brand recently sold by Brian Malarkey to Hakkasan Group and Geno Bernardo gone it was under the direction of Chef Marty Red Deleon Lopez that dinner was enjoyed at Herringbone on Friday, the Vegas Golden Knights live on Television both inside and on the outdoor patio where a DJ spun tunes.

Formerly of 35 Steaks + Martinis followed by a brief stint at Andre's Bistro & Bar, Chef Marty's tenure at Aria's second floor home of ""Land Meats Sea"" beginning earlier this year but only now starting to make the menu his own, it was arriving just prior to 6:45pm that two diners were greeted by familiar faces including longtime Managers and a server named Austin, seats taken outside at the lady's preference as Sin City's brief Spring was agreeable without the need for misters or heat lamps.

No stranger to Herringbone or neighboring Bardot Brasserie and Jean Georges Steakhouse, the trio undoubtedly comprising Las Vegas highest density of great Food in such a small area, it was with servers immediately whisking away menus that one ""It's Still Hot in Mexico"" was delivered based on memory, a small Amuse of Jicama and Watermelon quick to follow before presenting a grand platter of Seafood highlighted by BeauSoleil Oysters, Jumbo Shrimp and wrist-thick Crab Legs plus six housemade Sauces.

A frequent destination for big sporting events, the Big Ten Championship and Superbowl most recently serving a magnificent spread but this visit more focused on an upcoming Menu change and several Chef Marty originals, it was starting light that Herringbone's current Tomato & Avocado Salad was updated by vibrant Antirrhinum and Thai Basil dressed in White Wine Vinegar, the light spice and minty notes immediately refreshing the palate prior to a collection of new and old, the Buffalo Octopus thicker with char than prior and all better for it while seared Scallops with Mushrooms were safe yet nicely prepared, though certainly not as noteworthy as ""Lobster Larb"" topped with what Chef would only refer to as ""crack,"" it's crisp and buttery taste a perfect juxtaposition to fresh Shellfish, Grapefruit and Peppers.

Admitting a mandate from corporate to focus on ""rustic Farm-to-Table"" without getting to ""Chef-y,"" a task anyone familiar with Marty and Michael's plating at Hard Rock will realize ignores a significant talent, it was nonetheless utilizing Herringbone's great sourcing ability that course four featured two line-caught Fish flown in that day, the Swordfish braised in Mediterranean flavors meaty, moist and great for those seeking something healthy while deboned and fried Branzino was easily the night's most noteworthy plate given its light and crispy texture that ate well on its own but even better when shredded into Jungle Curry.

Offering more menu previews by way of ""his & hers"" Steaks, the Coffee-rubbed Prime Strip definitely a Beer-drinker's favorite thanks to robust smokiness and Black Garlic Sauce, it was in the opinion of both guests that the thicker Filet cooked Medium-Rare was a better choice for those not just looking to 'get full,' particularly with sides such as Las Vegas' best Brussels Sprouts and creamy Potatoes with two types of Cheese, Lardons and Scallions competing for stomach space. 

Unfortunately not yet updating the Dessert Menu, an ""if it's not broke don't fix it"" strategy apparently in place as everything remains good despite being tasted several times prior, it was with two Cakes and a Tart that dinner reached its conclusion, the Cheesecake remaining a great choice for those seeking something light though the Salted Caramel Tart is the only one that would be missed if/when the collection finally gets a makeover...and hopefully brings back the Carrot Cake or Bread Pudding that seem far better fitting a ""Farm to Table"" concept.

****1/2:  Offering some of the freshest Fish and best Produce in Las Vegas the challenge facing Herringbone as it moves forward with Hakkasan will be one of differentiating itself from the pack, something that ""farm to table"" cooking seems unlikely to do in 2018 but the sort of thing Chef Marty has proven capable of in the past and continues to do with daily specials that taste even better than they look.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,4,5,c9OfRKzrdMUes0-BptPbbg

We all had the buffet style brunch which was outstanding. There was so much seafood to choose from that it made it well worth the $60. You could even order food directly off the menu and that too was delicious. Our waitress was a gem but she too had the one complaint we had.. the DJ was TOO DAMN LOUD.. 

I mean I get it, it's Vegas but come on, it's brunch there's no reason for a club . It's time to enjoy and recoup. We asked the manager to turn it down but I guess they have a limit of turning it down.

5384326,2017-10-27,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"Stopped in here for a very satisfying lunch during my recent Vegas trip. The space is open, airy and very easy to navigate in a wheelchair. Since it was Mid-October and even in Vegas, there was a little nip in the air I opted to skip the beautiful patio and sit inside. The only negative to this was there was construction going on nearby so it made it quite noisy.

I started with an interesting Cocktail called, It' Still Hot in Mexico.

It was sweet/savory concoction with Espolon Reposado Tequila, Thai Chili, Agave, Lime, Cilantro and Cucumber Juice. It looked like a Green Smoothie, but had a strong, boozy kick and little heat. Although not brave enough to try the Chili Pepper garnish, I did enjoy the two fresh slices of Cucumber while waiting for my food.

My Lunch selection was The Lobster Roll with Maine Lobster, Lemon and Creme Fraiche with Boardwalk Fries.

The Lobster Roll was among the best I've ever had. Just enough Creme Fraiche and Lemon to enhance the sweetness of the perfectly cooked Lobster. I even loved the slightly sweet, split and grilled Hot Dog Bun the Lobster was tucked into. The Boardwalk Fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned ( I think with Old Bay) with a fluffy interior and crisp exterior.

Although quite full, I couldn't resist Dessert. I chose the Butterscotch Panna Cotta with Chantilly Cream, Caramel Corn and Chocolate Crunch.

The perfectly light, sweet ending to great lunch. When the plate came out I figured I would leave the Caramel Corn scattered around the plate untouched, but after one taste, I finished it all!

My server was friendly and knowledgeable, but the noise from the construction made it hard to hear. I will definitely will be returning to Herringbone in the hopefully near, future!",e0lV0WyRCYbYs9k6chh8YA,1,2,4,Vop_1-GDHX2iwNS5MZ45JA

5401468,2018-05-07,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,"We went for brunch today. It is all you can eat for $59.00 per person and this does not include alcohol. The cheapest bottomless option was $35.00 extra or more. That would mean $95.00 minimum. 

The good: I liked the food. We ordered the chilaquiles, fish tacos, and sweet crepes from the kitchen. All were very good. I was not so crazy about the other options from the kitchen and there were only a few to choose from. The brunch included a bread, carving, and omelette section at one end, and a salad station and dessert station at another end, and a seafood section by the first station. They were all over the place. 

The bad: I was disappointed with service. I had to keep asking for coffee after my cup being empty for well over 15 minutes. The latte I initially ordered before the regular coffee was way more a cappuccino than a latte. Yet that was mild compared to the fact that this was our first time having brunch there and our server did not tell us where all the stations were or even explain the brunch to us. Due to this, we missed the Bloody Mary station and the salad station. We only knew about the dessert station after my friend asked if she can see a menu for dessert. We knew about the bread/carving/omelette station as we were sat right next to it. We knew about the small seafood station as it was behind us. The salad and dessert and Bloody Mary areas were way on the other side of an angled restaurant that is packed so easily missed if not told about it. We did not bother with the Bloody Mary station or salad station as we already ate when we found out about it. This is the first restaurant where our server did not ask us if we knew where everything was. I suppose this is why I could not believe how expensive the price was for what we knew of. I was disappointed in what I believed was way overpriced for what you get. 

There are way better brunches in the city that have way better service, better food, and better prices.

I'm staying at the Aria and lying by the pool. I wanted something to eat and yo not have to go too far...hence, Herringbone. 

I will say this...dining by yourself is difficult enough....when an establishment opens and there are many vacant tables, don't quibble about where to put someone. Seat them and get them eating and drinking. 

That being said, I started with oysters...I reckon that I'm waaaay too East Coast, as I thought the West Coast selection was just eh.

Small Bites
-------------
WINGS
These lollipops fall right off the bone have just the right balance of crispiness and juiciness. The peanut sauce was killer, and thanks to the frenching of the wings, we didn't look like sloppy 5 year-olds with sauce and chicken remnants all over our faces and hands. #classyladies

PT. JUDITH CALAMARI
I had to order this to erase the memory of the disgusting airport calamari that I had eaten the night before. It did the job. My good friend (Google) let me know that Port Judith, Rhode Island is the hub of the US squid business and that Atlantic Squid is greater than Squid Imported from China. Agreed.

OCTOPUS
Every time I've eaten octopus, it's kinda been like chewing on sole of a Teva sandal, but we ordered this on the recommendation of the chef. It did not disappoint. No rubberiness whatsoever. The texture was amazing and the salsa verde and preserved lemons gave it a wonderfully zingy and fresh flavor. It's the kind of dish that you go out of your way to come back for -- my favorite of the appetizers.

Chef Special
---------------
The chef took the night's special and shrunk it down into bite-sized portions for us. I can't remember all the details because I was in a food-induced euphoric state, but it was a white fish (crispy skin still on - soooo good) and shrimp with risotto. Holy ****, the RISOTTO. It was made with the leftover sauce from the shrimp, along with white wine and Meyer lemons. One bite of the risotto and I wanted to bust into the kitchen and - without saying a word - make a beeline for the chef to hug it out.

Entrees
---------
8oz CENTER CUT FILET
I have a visceral reaction when my steak is not the proper temperature. I get unreasonably angry internally, as I choke down charred disgustingness with a fake smile on my face. (I don't send food back. It's not in my DNA.) This filet was 8 ounces of medium rare perfection. Crusty on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. And lets talk about my side, the Death By Potatoes. (Yes, that's how it reads on the menu.) The chef described it as ""fat on fat on fat on fat"". How could you go wrong with that? YOU CAN'T. Parmesan, mascarpone, butter, pancetta, and scallions. I may have clogged an artery last night. NO REGRETS.

WHITE SEA BASS
The bestie got the white sea bass. When it came out, I got a whiff of the truffle vinaigrette and almost slapped her for a bite. Thank God she offered me a taste before it got to that. It's the kind of fish that even people that say ""I hate fish"" would love.

Desserts
----------
COCONUT CARROT CAKE
I fancy myself a carrot cake connoisseur and this was the best I have ever had in my life, hands down. It makes me want to murder every other carrot cake out there. Posers.

TURTLE CHEESECAKE
The bartender strong-armed us into getting this. (And by strong-armed, I mean, raved about it and politely suggested we try it.) The cheesecake was silky and the Oreo crust was finely crumbled and delicious, but it was the toasted pecans that blew my mind. It was the perfect complement to my almost comically-sized giant after-dinner coffee.

If this place had a 'Most Eaten in a Single Visit' award, I would have left with the crown last night. Every bite was phenomenal and the service was exceptional. Now please excuse me while I eat my breakfast in bed (AKA leftover steak).",T26MtL0q4rCAbyFgzagtRg,10,5,5,kcmXL_fsrsh6lcwJU-Dq4w

I ordered their non-alcoholic Patio Crusher which was refreshing but a bit steep at $8 especially when there was so much ice in the glass.  To eat I had their La Jolla fish tacos that I ordered fried and with a side of mixed greens salad.  The food was ok but not special enough to make me want to come back for it.

Atmosphere: Quite louder than you'd expect. Everyone was leaning in to talk to each other and nearly shouting around the restaurant..... for brunch. Nice to have a DJ and all but you can still take it down a notch. The decor was nice, open air, well-dressed servers. Lots of good natural light.

Service: There was one server for nearly the whole brunch restaurant and it got busy. She was aided by a few ""second-hand"" mates but it didn't run as smoothly as one would like. A few times we needed to remind about bringing some hot sauce, one beverage, and someones dish.

Food/Drinks: Here's the big ups and downs. Let's start with the highlights. The Chilaquiles were amazing. Spot-on and totally legit. We were pleasantly surprised how authentic they were. The ravioli egg and bacon were also nice, appropriately small, and rich. However... rest was just off. The breakfast burrito was dry and not very flavorful. The pitcher of bloody marks was watery, bland, and needed 1lb of tabasco to make it lively. The other basic dishes people had were just meh. Even the avocado toast was scant on avocado and flavor -- mostly the charred bread came through. Even the polpo courtesy dish was uninspiring.

We likely won't go back with so many other great restaurants for brunch (e.g. Bardot right across the hallway!). It could be a nice spot for dinner when louder music and more of their land and sea spirit might come through.",QwYUgv2fSLbtelKZd4MdAg,1,0,3,G8eeruKHSeEJN-qXWi5Y2Q

We had Peter serving us on a beautiful sunny morning where we sat outside on their gorgeous patio where they had a DJ spinning music. We tried everything on their special brunch all you can eat menu of 8 items. They also had a cold seafood bar and a omelet bar as well.

Even though the restaurant was not full we waited about 15 minutes for the table to be set up with a reservation.  The waitress brought us desert menus before the entrees were even served, so she clearly wasn't paying much attention.  No one came back to ask how we were doing after we did finally get the food.

Once we were seated, we were all handed the menu. First introduced to their wide variety of clever-named cocktails and wines. I stuck with water the whole night. We first ordered the herb (truffle) fries (about $8/order). They were crisp, and a bit addicting when dipped in the aoili. For the entree I decided to go with the wings, as they are a very popular order. I split them amongst my boyfriend, so we got two orders. The food didn't take too long considering I was dining with a large party of 9! (Who mostly ordered steak.) The wings were delicious and packed with flavor. Though they were a whopping $18/order, I couldn't complain about the quality. I was also able to taste the steak as well as the 18-oz rib-eye ($62), and ""Death by Potatoes"" ($9). The steak was incredibly tender, and I had wished I ordered it. The potatoes were very creamy, and also packed with flavor. Next we had our desserts. All were unique from the other. The Cheesecake Mouse was my favorite.

I recommend Herringbone if you are looking for a place on the strip that doesn't feel touristy. A place where the prices are a little high, but the food is worth the price. You get what you pay for, and in this case...you get a wonderful meal.",-IM1qwYck6nqKizjCzR_ww,0,0,5,__HL3-Y0m32_CfobzKOucg

We weren't really hungry so we opted for this place. It was a warm night with a bit of Vegas breeze/wind, so we sat outside. It gave us a nice view of the pool and we were semi shielded from too much wind. There was a good bunch of people out. The music was perfect. The blend of mellow but up beat Vegas. 

We only ordered the crab cake, some drinks, and the seafood platter for two (or smaller of the two versions). The crab cake was okay. It wasn't my favorite among the ones we've had. It was citrusy and.. pushed the freshness of the crab out of the food. I didn't enjoy it. My husband says the cake was a three but he wouldn't order it again. 

The platter on the other hand, I'd order that again! It was fresh, well worth it and the kitchen did a lot to accommodate the people who are unfamiliar with cracking/de-shelling. The dish came with lobster, shrmip/prawns, oysters and I think that's it? It doesn't sound like much but definitely filled us up and we left happy.

My party and I showed up last Saturday morning for the most amazing brunch buffet and Brandon ensured that our drinks were flowing and that our food came out exactly to order. 

The brunch buffet, which I believe is $54.99, offers amazing items like a raw bar, sliced to order prime rib and porchetta, an omelet station, a dessert station, and there fruit juices on ice that you can grab and bring back to your table or even take it to go. On top of that, you can also opt in for various levels of unlimited vodka and mimosas, which of course we all jumped in on. In my honest opinion, this brunch buffet is one of the best values for money on the Strip in terms of value, quantity, and unbelievable service. 

The only hiccup that occurred during our experience was our order of 3 dozen Fannie Bay oysters getting delivered to the wrong table. We suspected they got delivered to a larger table where a bachelorette party was seated. In any case, Brandon suspected something was wrong and he immediately went to his manager to remedy the situation. Unfortunately, they weren't able to shuck another 3 dozen oysters so we were ""encouraged"" to go directly to the raw bar and request them. It ended up working out because we came back and ate way more than 3 dozen oysters anyway. 

All in all, my wife and I plan to make Herringbone Las Vegas a frequent place for us to dine when we come back again to visit because of the awesome food and hospitality. Thank you again, Brandon and team!",R9IutadqUKpgVmNf9C1_YA,0,0,5,vOK2H6Ih2bv3sxO4r0hGIw

First of all, the hostesses are extremely unfriendly. Seems like it's a bother to you that they have to do anything. The restaurant was about half full and we were first told it would be an hour then the hostess said a table got up, but we watched that dirty table not be touched or cleaned for 20 min while we waited- once again the hostesses were no help in that.

Got seated finally and someone came over after about 10 min and poured water, but no mention of any other drinks. Eventually a girl came over and said our server was really busy so she would take our drink order- we went ahead and ordered everything since we had now been sitting for a good 20 min with nothing to show for it. 

Finally saw our actual server about 30 min in when he brought our first round of drinks. 45 min in we finally got ""apps."" Some of the group started with salads or should have but for some reason they brought oysters, one salad and one entree. Oysters Rockefeller and melon salad were both awesome btw, the food was spot on.

About 20 min and empty plates later I finally see our waiter to let him know someone got their entree and not salad. He was quick to blame everyone else. He then proceeds to tell us they haven't even started our entrees- mind you there's maybe 8-10 total tables full in the restaurant. My boyfriend was a little annoyed to find out they hadn't started our dinner for no reason... servers response was ""well what do you want me to do? I can put your entrees in now if that's what you want."" Umm yes... that's what we want.. dinner and without having to tell you... thought that's why we ordered. 

My boyfriend finally asked for a manager whom was very pleasant and sent out an extra appetizer which we were very appreciative of, but that the same time we had been sitting for over an hour and not had the dinner we ordered for apparently no reason. The manager also sent over deserts later. 

All in all I can overlook certain things. Had the server provided great service or even been around I could've dealt with the long wait for food. Most of the food was very good, probably would've been more enjoyable under different circumstances. 

My group is praying this type of experience isn't the norm for Aria or any nicer restaurant on the Strip as we are here for a week for my Birthday. This one really put a bad taste in my mouth about a reputable brand.",_P-3dXWmS24EcAs7m7332Q,0,0,1,eEYdYPnGgRul5JqKjEjGUA

The menu was expensive but we were expecting that. Our service was AWFUL!!! Made the meal the worst of the trip. Not only did our drinks take at least 15 min to get we had to find the server to place our order. Then our food took forever. The server then proceeded to bring us shots to ""make up"" for the fact that he was not around. He said he was taking care of the president of the hotel so had to cater to him. So I'm paying $$$$$ to his company and you cater to him?? No won't be going back or recommending them. Oh and we women have worked in the industry. Those poor tips you didn't even deserve them.",ZPSJvBU1CM45G2EYgyQV0A,0,0,2,WRUuKhrcXhSVrQGrp587Dw

For $68, I got a juicy and (slightly crispy on the edges) piece of filet mignon and lobster already deshelled for me. Even though Herringbone specializes in seafood, the filet mignon is one of the better ones I've had even from steakhouses. They also offer a lot of seafood options. I believe we got the fish steak as an appetizer, and it came out grilled and with very little bones; a healthy option. We came for dinner, so expect to take 2 hours.
The waiter was helpful in suggesting cocktails and menu options.",vHoQglxERgYFLo3n8IlKjA,0,0,5,Gv-iuibPPwKouGMLTsOm4w
5922901,2017-09-05,0,-wCtRhzWJ40Z4F8mmg7kWg,Decent restaurant inside city center.  The food was good and the service was really good.  It would've got five stars but the seating is awful and the chairs are so uncomfortable.  Like standard wood chairs that are too tall for the tables.  My back literally hurts from sitting there on that cheap chair.  Pretty unfortunate that the place that devoted so much time to detail incredible copper silverware didn't look at how awful their chairs and seating are.    Probably other places I would check out at city center first,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,0,0,4,0PTIhwEAq-G7amOTn5miZg

Went with the avocado and tomato salad and a burger in a combo called the lunch box which came with what I assume is a mini version of the salad and choice of entree for $32. Both were excellent, highly recommended. Service from wait staff was prompt and friendly. Patio was great and so was the weather. 

Pros: great service and food
          Good vibe whether you sit inside or out

Cons: none, just be calibrated to Vegas prices.",6eDshPJmQZJrvG-aLubi2Q,0,0,5,uYm-YgdplsbWi6dAJO6hjA

We dined here on a Wednesday evening, ambience is amazing on the patio, the food runners and wait staff were amazing, waitress who actually took our order was subpar unfortunately the 2 gentlemen who were assisting her were far more attentive & willing to go above and beyond.

Perfectly cooked seafood, expertly seasoned, using high quality ingredients. The chefs in this restaurant care about the food they prepare. I have eaten and travelled all over the world but the seafood pasta I had was one of the best dishes I've ever experienced. Extremely flavorful with large quantities of high value seafood ingredients such as lobster and large shrimp. My wife's fish fillet was delicately prepared and not over cooked. 

The restaurant itself is somewhat disappointing. It has a bit of a sports bar feel with lots of tv screens and you can view the indoor mall.  But, ignore all of that and go there for great seafood and you will totally forget you are actually in a desert.",-0GfW6bw64XRcI6fWvUQ6g,1,1,5,o6onywVxMFQWB0LyExAaVw
