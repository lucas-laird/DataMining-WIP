Good prices. Great food. I couldn't wait to get on the road, so I took a bite before leaving the restaurant. 

I was sad when their other location closed--so glad they reopened here! Much closer to the strip! Pho is definitely a must after a heavy night of Vegas fun!! Heh heh or even on a cold night ;)",dFpo4b86OqkdeWa88QJeAA,0,0,5,nbxGcwR2pDWDQmXrMfyg2g

1668359,2017-06-15,0,TmAbrQoXslJsReCqLfwnXA,"Right off the bat, two stars from the cleanliness.  This has to one of the most friendly and spotless Vietnamese restaurant.   

Although the service was slow (there were only two workers), they were both extremely polite and they consistently asked if we were satisfied.  Everything seemed fresh and at least average or great in quality.  

I had rice and beef and although the portion was smaller than other places, the beef was flavorful.  The pork and rice was appetizing and it also received high marks.  The bun bo hue was a bit thin but the portion was quite large.  The beef noodles was alright but once again the portions of beef and egg rolls were generous.  The fish dishes though, were the best.  The fish stew and clay pot fish were fresh and there were large chunks of fish in the stew.  We could easily tell that it was fresh and the broth was well seasoned.  Although it was pricer, the dish could probably feed two to three people.

The drinks here were outstanding.  I had the Thai tea and boba; the tea was good but I would skip the boba.  The avocado shake was delicious and not overly sweet.  The durian shake was great and I've had my fair share of durian drinks.  The passion fruit drink looked highly suspicious at first but it was our favorite drink.  Highly recommended.

1808605,2015-11-18,8,TmAbrQoXslJsReCqLfwnXA,"Uh-oh. I think Kinh Do and Dakao have some competition on their hands- the bahn mi here are cheap, huge, and tasty, with an incredible bread! The sandwiches are usually pretty low-priced but the version here is a ""foot long"" - literally two huge halves, double the portion that you get elsewhere, for only a buck or so more. My usual complaint about bahn mi is the lackluster bread- but here, it is fresh baked, fluffy, and beautiful. It almost reminds me of a challah bread. I'm definitely coming back here for more sandwiches, though the selection is a bit limited . Grab the dac biet!

The namesake pho is also a good option- broth was lighter than is typical around town, and meat was an average portion but less fatty than cuts served at other shops. Large and small sizes are offered, typically under $10. Two of us split a large and didn't finish it. I was a bit surprised to see the pho included sliced white onions. Menu has some healthier-sounding options, including a chicken pho and a shrimp version.

The spring rolls were the only item we were slightly less than blown away by- portion of two rolls came nicely plated and generously served with two cups of creamy peanut sauce. However, the filling seemed to be mostly shredded iceberg lettuce with the protein/noodles. Everything was fresh and priced appropriately though ($5).

Service was attentive and friendly- much more so than I'm used to receiving at a Vietnamese place, to be honest. The massive order above was $22 for two before tip, and was enough food to leave an entire roll and half a sandwich for my lunch the following day.

Arrived here at 10:20 and they open at 10 a.m. My table was the second one there. 
My reason for a low rating is because the food took 30 minutes for us to receive and it wasn't the greatest meal I've had. There was one lady who seated us and made our drinks. And apparently one server who brought us the food. I'm assuming there was not enough staff to cook the food and make drinks, since it took so long.
We waited 15 minutes before our drinks came out. Not everyone got their drinks until about 20ish minutes. My sisters drink came last because she got an avocado smoothie. Not sure why it took so long. 
Our first plates were the Nem Nuong spring rolls. They were alright, it was thinly sliced meatloaf with some veggies, a few herbs and rice noodles. I had the combination egg noodles, my noodles were hard but everything else was good. My mom got the beef pho and she didn't finish her bowl cause the seasoning wasn't as good as our usual pho places in California. Her beef pho  had a lot of fat pieces. My dad got the ""banh hoi"" which was pretty appealing because it came with pork, shrimp, egg rolls and etc.

3797957,2015-12-07,0,TmAbrQoXslJsReCqLfwnXA,"TRY THIS PLACE, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!

Being from Hawaii originally, I've had my fair share of delicious food. We spent three years in England, two in North Carolina and we are now in fabulous Las Vegas where, once again, I can eat my heart out on all kinds of different Asian foods without driving too far (20 mins from home). I had been craving pho for quite some time before deciding to venture out after studying reviews on Yelp to figure out which places I should try.

The first place I tried was Pho Rancho. It's up the road from where we live but it didn't quite hit the spot for me. Disappointed, I turned to Yelp again and tried Viet Bistro a couple days later. It was better but wasn't mind blowing. 

Today I turned to Yelp again and found this little gem. Decided to give it a try and it was all that my belly was looking for and more! I'm so happy I tried this place and this is now my go to place for pho/any Vietnamese cravings. They have a decent sized menu with tons of options from banh mi to vermicelli to pho to rice dishes to dessert drinks. I ordered the fresh spring rolls with pork and shrimp. From the time I placed my order to the time the food was on my table was literally six minutes. SIX! I also ordered a banh mi with chicken to try and also take home for my husband for dinner. Lastly I ordered a large beef pho with flank steak only. 

Everything was so freaking good. The rolls were awesome and I'm happy it came with two peanut sauces. The pho immediately hit the spot, the broth shouldn't NEED sauces to make it taste good, it needs to hold it's own by itself and it definitely does. Something else I appreciated was that they have wooden chopsticks at the table to use! It's always so annoying to mess around with the slippery plastic chopsticks that are in the majority of Vietnamese pho places. The noodles always slip out. This place had well made wooden chopsticks that made the process of enjoying my food not take forever. The banh mi was awesome, the bread they use is incredible and such big portions for such great prices! The banh mi was $5.95 I believe but it was a foot long cut in half. Literally double the size of a regular banh mi for $1.00 more, if even that. The pho was ginormous. I still ate it all because even though I'm 5'1"", I have this super power that allows me to eat insane amounts of food. The large pho was $8.95 which, compared to the other two places I tried, was the same price as just a regular sized pho. Such great prices. The people who work there are super sweet too. I will be back soon! Definitely give this place a try! I never write a review the same day I ate at the restaurant (due to being lazy and procrastinating) but I had to do it today so anyone else craving pho and turning to Yelp knows where to go.


TL;DR. This place is AMAZING. Try it and you will not be disappointed. Quick service (rolls were ordered and at my table within six minutes, pho within 15 minutes). Great prices and fabulous wooden chopsticks.",-tEu9XCZJHtgBFu9q6xXzQ,3,3,5,E4Az2FCizyjX0t6NZb7V6Q

4014536,2016-01-22,4,TmAbrQoXslJsReCqLfwnXA,"Great late night eats!

The fam & I were out doing last minute holiday things when all of a sudden the 'Hunger Games' hit us like Jennifer Lawrence in a tight top & an even tighter bow string.  Only problem was it was past 9:15 PM, and I was feeling like a sandwich.  But no one besides me would settle for SUBWAY.  Off I go on my Yelp app, plugging in 'sandwich' for a search nearby.  As luck would have it, we were cruisin' along near Chinatown.  What's that you say, Yelp app?  Right off Sahara, a pho place with banh mi sandwiches open till 10 PM?  With over 3 stars?  I'm there!

Getting in front of the place, I thought Pho Vegas was already closed as it was EMPTY.  But upon pulling on the door, I was let in to the awesomeness that is broth simmering on a stove.  Pho broth can be so intoxicating!  I asked if they were already closed and the polite little old lady (our hostess and possibly one of the owners) said, ""No, please sit down.""  We didn't want to keep them waiting too long for us after closing so we went over the menu as quick as we could.  

We ordered:

*#34 - Pho Vegas Dac Biet ($8.95 for Large) - Special noodle soup with rare steak, crunchy flank, tripe, tendon, brisket, and meatball

#12 - Banh Mi Dac Biet ($5.95) - Foot long sandwich with combination pork

I'm just gonna come out and say the pho and the banh mi were some of the better stuff I've had in Vegas!  Tasty tasty tasty!

The pho was in a really large bowl with enough noodles, goodies, & broth for two of us to share (which we did).  The broth here at Pho Vegas is actually pretty flavorful without being overly salty.  I could taste the star anise, and possibly a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg?  Nice for a cold winter night.  The additional condiments were fresh too, the basil, bean sprouts, and jalapenos were crisp.

But for me, the banh mi was the star!  Each are a foot long!  Bigger than just about all other banh mi offered in Vegas, with similar pricing.  The bread here at Pho Vegas is killer delicious!  Warm, but crusty on the outside & cushy on the inside.  Probably key for a great banh mi.  Some Yelpers complained that theirs were light on the meat, but the one I had that night was on point.  Mayo on the bread as well!  A good serving of fresh veggies in there too - cilantro, cucumbers, pickled carrots & radish.  I added some extra basil, bean sprouts, and a couple of jalapenos from our condiment plate...topped that sucker with a healthy dose of hoisin sauce, a splash of Sriracha, and I was ready to go!  Delicious sandwich!  Shared half with the wifey & she liked it enough that we ordered another one to take home!

I work less than 10 minutes from Pho Vegas so you can be sure I'll be back for lunch to get a banh mi (or 2) to go.  Big bang for the buck!

I ordered grilled pork banh mi and chicken banh mi to go. All I ordered were sandwiches. That's it.  Thirty plus minutes later, no sandwiches.  The lady who worked there apologized that they were so busy. Okay, fine. After 45 minutes, I got my sandwiches. By this time, I was  hangry. From what I saw, they may have been understaffed, but 45 minutes is unacceptable for just sandwiches. Are they baking the bread?  If so...tell me! I don't think this was the case though.

What is impressive about the banh mi here are the huge portions and freshly baked bread; however, the grilled pork tasted off. I was questioning whether or not I got the right order.  In addition the veggies were lacking the vinegar taste that I am used to.  

I would probably recommend calling in your order, if only ordering banh mi. I don't think I'll be back though.

Starting with the VERY large portioned Banh Mi Thit Nuong, almost twice as large as the norm, announcing fresh bread at first bite.  Charbroiled pork is well seasoned, a bit sweet (almost Tocino like).  A steal at the asking price....Subway, eat your heart out!

Pho Tai is moderately oily, served with delicate noodles, slightly thinner than the average.  Too bad my Rare Beef was already well done when presented, the only note mentionable from a surprisingly satisfying non-Chinatown bowl.

I didn't like them at all and I just can't figure out what exactly I didn't like about it. Were they fishy and salty? Maybe. I haven't had this dish I did not finish so, this was a first. 2/5

Com Dac Biet:
Steamed rice with grilled pork, sausage, pork cake, and egg. Pork cake? Por que? It's not what you think it is. It's like meatloaf slices made of pork. 3/5

Banh Mi Thit Nuong:
A huge fat sandwich with grilled pork and veggies. Oh my goodness, this thing is thick and delicious. They bake the bread on premise so, when you get your sandwich it is so lovely and warm. You'll ask, ""where have you been all my life?"" Whatever bad things I said in the previous paragraphs, just disregard them. Their Banh mi more than made up for everything. Your first bite, the warm flakey crunchy bread...oh, my! And it's packing some good meat...lots of it. It's just perfection. It's about $6 and it can feed 2 people. Those places that sell sub  sandwiches has nothing on this. 5/5

So, yes, come here for the Banh mi and take it to-go. Skip the egg rolls.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,10,8,4,6OZM3VOzJbZ_e7gzb0flcw

We ordered a #40 Pho w/ raw steak & meatballs - it was flavorful, hot & deviously spiced, and #71 Bun bowl - well balanced, filling, egg rolls & pork - yummy, sausage- different but not bad. We also ordered a fresh lime drink  and Taro smoothie they were booth +A. You should definitely try them!! 

The staff was friendly and didnt speak much english. But they came by to make sure we were ok. Thats all I ask for in good service.

Overall good food and amazing prices. We will be back when in the area.",-go-R_jzvYLYngQbfKN4_A,2,1,4,u8qFK4INzWgW_5eTM6J7ag

I also ordered the pork plate which was just ok. The egg rolls were the best thing I had and they were just ok too!

5775092,2015-12-06,1,TmAbrQoXslJsReCqLfwnXA,"Came here for dinner around 8pm 12/5/15. I ordered a combination pho, combination bahn mi sand which, and my other half got the bun bo hue. 
Our food came out quick! We waited probably about 5-10min at the most. The combination pho was delicious. I had so much noodles and meat that accommodated each other especially for a small! It was mines & my bfs first time trying bun bo hue. So I can't really say much about it besides that it does have a fishy broth to it & thicker and rounder noodles than pho does. The bahn mi was the best I ever had in Vegas. It's so rare to see Vietnamese places serve bahn mi compared to back home (Hawaii) where every Vietnamese place usually has bahn mi. 

Customer service was great! Everyone was very nice! Usually when it comes to Asian joints they don't show much hospitality to their customers but they did. They checked up on us a bunch of times. We were short about 50 cents on our check and they lady said it was ok. 

I will definitely come back here again! I just wish it was closer to my side of town.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,4,4,5,nMdUiy9GLqa9zARMw1CnLQ

We had kids with us and they automatically assumed we were going to share our pho with them and brought us extra small bowls and scissors to cut up the noodles. Never have I ever been to a pho restaurant that automatically accommodated to our kids! It was very thoughtful of them! The pho was so delicious and had a lot of flavor!

5921973,2016-12-27,1,TmAbrQoXslJsReCqLfwnXA,"Because we aren't from the area and it had been a long day, my parents wanted comfort food so we checked this place out. It wasn't super crowded when we came in but there were more uncleared tables than tables with people at them. We were seated and warned that the kitchen was understaffed (only two ladies on the floor and they were kept very busy) so the wait would be around half an hour (and it was). I ended up ordering the pho rare steak, tripe, and brisket.

PROS:
- Clean enough looking place with simple and not overbearing decor
- Open late! We came in around 9pm
- Polite staff
- Fair prices that match the portion size
- My mom's dac biet rice meal had a nice variety of sides and each portion was good 

CONS: 
- I barely had a few strands of tripe in my bowl
- The broth seemed more like chicken broth than that of typical pho broth (didn't seem quite right to me since I'm used to more flavorful soup)
- Average enough pho, not going to be memorable but it filled me up",MZJ2LkdMTcjjk1dyPlg-tQ,0,0,2,OK_b05WQyBBlMaOF7uhbuQ

The lady who serves there is really mean and if they have more than two tables they will refuse to take order-_- The spring roll was too dry and was not tasty. I don't understand how they can screw up the spring rolls...  Peanuts sauce was way too sweet. It took them over 30 min to make two sandwich:(
And boba was soooooo soggy and bad. Really no texture. They way over cooked them-_- Yikes.",pWslOzIw51k3CYnKHVUCFA,0,1,1,Y_JGn6ZRhv-DmKKNHZCu1Q
