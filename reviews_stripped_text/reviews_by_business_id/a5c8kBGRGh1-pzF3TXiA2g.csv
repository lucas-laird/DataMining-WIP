Usually there is a young man there who is very helpful and friendly. However I made the mistake of going late at night when there is this very old, rude, and crooked man working there. I have never had someone steal my money the way he intentionally did. He told me my total was $5.07. I gave him a $20 then I told him I had 7 cents in change. He took the opportunity when I was going through my change purse to pocket my $15. I insisted to have the police called to look to make sure I did not have the $15 in change. I waited 30 minutes for them to come. He still pretended like he didn't have my money. All the while his son, (who I believe is in on the scam) was watching and yelling obscenities at me. The old man went out to smoke as I waited inside to have the police come to solve things. I then asked him if there were coming, he then pushed me and called me a stupid bitch. Now, that I am over the initial shock of not receiving my money, and being physically and verbally assaulted, I will be pressing charges against this company. Please for your physical and financial safety, do not shop or get gas at Pump N Snack.",J_wA27Ujap6Jhq9vTZ5EHw,0,0,1,ZFGMCDL-fjJM1hXvjx-nIg

It has the unfortunate location right next to the 7-11 so you don't really see this place because the sign is small and the place is pretty dimly lit.

They also run a really great special of $5.99 for a 6-pack of coronas. 
There's not really a huge selection of snacks & drinks but what they do have is really cheap. 

But as bad as it sounds, some times I just don't want to stop there because there is ALWAYS at least on homeless person hanging around the parking lot, and dealing with it EVERY time gets old.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,3,1,3,rfu8aczrpo3qvRSS96NH6g

From the looks of it, I told my dad not to pump gas here because it looked very sketchy with suspicious characters and very poor lighting. He and my aunt agreed with me and we found another gas station in a better area.
Not a good place to be hanging around at night anyway, especially if you're alone.",Ur4u9wfVtacMnYGbo29ZpQ,0,0,2,cExxqzJuV-6GeqfYebiu9A
4883503,2015-12-03,1,a5c8kBGRGh1-pzF3TXiA2g,"There are lots of homeless people and drug addicts around this place begging for money. Most of them are harmless, but some of them can be downright aggressive and rude. Watch your belongings. This place isn't that far off the strip, but it certainly isn't a place I'd recommend. Sometimes saving a few pennies on gas isn't worth it.",lRHUkES8HnFAqdoi4hwNkg,1,1,1,qsJpd_pa-i9dk-nK2bGj6Q
