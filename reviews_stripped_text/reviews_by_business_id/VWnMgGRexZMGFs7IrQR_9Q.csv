Service is that of a local everyone knows everyone type of vibe bar. Entire staff is super friendly and they know their beers. 

Take advantage of the great happy hour 4pm-7pm which includes all draft beers and a couple of food selections. Also if u not sure which beer u would like, don't be afraid to ask to sample it.",-SnGq6dVUOSJZEqDu1TqpQ,1,0,5,jpoL6C3lbObOAZCbbsawqw
1881702,2016-06-22,0,VWnMgGRexZMGFs7IrQR_9Q,"Came here on a Wednesday night and there were only two other parties seated, one at the bar, and one at a table. I opted to get a salad here to go. I went with the heart of Palm salad and added the organic chicken for $5. The salad stated it had arugula, heirloom carrots, avocado, heart of palm, and radish with a jalape√±o vinaigrette. I asked to sub the vinaigrette with the sesame one from the other salad which they happily did. 

Portion size for to go was pretty small especially for a $15 salad ($16.22 with tax). The chicken was super dry and overcooked lol I had to try to soak it in as much dressing as I can fish from the bottom of the bowl. I was looking forward to heirloom carrots because I LOVE heirloom carrots but they used regular shaved carrots which was disappointing. And lastly, there was no avocado! That was one reason I  ordered this salad and no sight of even one. I wondered if it would have been different if I didn't order it to-go, idk. Well I  know I won't be back. I would have been more satisfied if I created my own salad from whole foods for sure lol..",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,1,1,1,zDDMI7Ldlff5Hd4uOSfDtA
1882010,2018-02-22,0,VWnMgGRexZMGFs7IrQR_9Q,"A bar/restaurant inside a grocery store?! Having moved from Virginia (a state where Whole Foods Markets are known for housing several fantastic restaurants under one roof)...I was excited to find that there was a hot food option (besides the hot food bar paid by the pound).

I got the Pub Burger ($12) and was surprised by how simple but delicious it was. Grass fed beef, pickled red onions, roasted garlic aioli, and bacon jam...this burger is doing everything right! Unlike other restaurants that pile topping after topping on their burgers, the pub burger here satisfies any burger craving without too much added on. Fries were also perfectly hot & crispy  + the organic ketchup= :)

Happy Hour runs Monday-Friday from 4-7PM. The pub burger is part of the specials offered....if anything, save a couple dollars & treat yourself to a burger that won't disappoint.

Service was a tad slow, but the server also doubles as the bartender. She was very friendly and helpful given the circumstances. 

I'll be back for happy hour, lunch, snack...let's be honest: whenever I shop at Whole Foods.",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,0,0,4,QbhSK-WcxUxS8t9w657nNA

2744049,2018-02-19,0,VWnMgGRexZMGFs7IrQR_9Q,"Can I just put one of these in every Whole Foods location?!? Oh my goodness you guys, the vegan food here is seriously legit. And what is even better is the beer selections that they have to go with your vegan food! 

Please do yourself a favor and order the cauliflower nachos. You'll have regrets for the rest of your life if you skip this. I promise you. Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, with thinly sliced peppers for some heat and avocado cream to cool it down. Nice balance of flavors and textures. 

The Beyond Burger...wow. Just. Wow. You've got layers of flavors on the bun. 

But the beer selection on tap?!? There's a Blueberry Basil Kombucha Beer and a Mango Ginger Kombucha Beer on tap that's crisp and refreshing like a cider. 

And if you have room for dessert, get the vegan chocolate cake. Ya'll...I'm in heaven!! 

Now how do I pack these guys up and take them home??? :)",29b8E11HQS10rpXHzVRsFA,0,1,5,X4hQIRHi33ej0Mhn6fw-zg

A good size list of beer on tap.  Folk music in Vegas. I will be back for sure. Not a dive bar by any stretch. Bright airy and the food is fresh and healthy.

Oh and the beast burger (vegan) was on point (they gave us a sample). It's located inside whole foods town sq... They offer happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6pm (beer and wine). 

The service was decent... And ambiance was a little bright in comparison to the photos I've see on Yelp. They did have the cooking channel and hgtv on which We were stoked about... They offer plenty of non vegan options as well with an eclectic menu from breakfast to dinner. 

We grocery shopped after dinner and had dessert at home in bed. Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back! I'm still waiting for a location to open at the Charleston and ft Apache location.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,6,6,5,O-BqLADZ32jsn08_TZEwiQ

The tap list is amazing! Lots of local & regional beers, plus some from back East and Europe...
(1000 IPA from Denmark was amazing)

They also have a decent, bar food menu. Our food was great...and reasonably priced for the area.

I was told you can even go buy beer from the store & bring it inti LV Bar to drink it... a nice alternative.
They said they fill glass growlers, but it was $$$ as they charge by the pint price, no deals there.

Our server was great...both friendly & helpful.

A must return often for us!",fGfs1wP0ENl4oZCqGxH6zA,1,1,5,_zoKy_-YceHglvM37yskdA

Our server was really nice and was helpful in drink selection and saving money.

Everything is awesome here, you really can't go wrong.  All the food is made fresh to order.  It's a great place with a daily happy hour.  You can order food & drink here or grab something from inside the store and bring it in.  This is a good place to check out.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,12,10,4,EQgLiCYhpU9Gn-yk8J95oA

We also tried the vegan Beast Burger, which was also great. The pizza we ordered was awful. The crust tasted like it was made from animal crackers. I love animal crackers, just not on my pizza. Everything else was great though. The server was also very nice. I think she was the only person working there and she was very attentive. Great service!

First off inside a wholes food market I stop by had a drink and a bite to eat then went shopping but I felt a bit odd. 

It was a nice change being able to eat and drink to relex before shopping probably save me a little money they have like 20 something beers on tap and a good selection

This isn't your run of the mill little food counter, either. Sit at the bar or at one of many tables in a comfortable lounge type setting neatly carved out of one front corner of the store. And, yes, sports fans, there plasma screens for you.

And the best part is that get all of the friendly, attentive service and tasty high quality food you've come to expect from Whole Foods Market.

Or, maybe the best part is that they have happy hour from 4 to 6, with special menu items.

Or, maybe it's the 24 taps...

I can't decide :)",cHr4S_PSpAWpLi8CWtLzrA,1,1,5,snJtul6jpVvtlovCrKdqYQ
