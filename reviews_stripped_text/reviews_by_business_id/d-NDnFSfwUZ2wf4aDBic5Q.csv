A lot of people were there at the time, so I guess they were fans of CiCi's as well.

I never knew you could mess up salad till I ate here. the dressing is awful! the quality of the salad items are low grade. The choices are very small. The pizza was mediocre. it cant even compare to round table. round table is $2 more but they have a return stamp card which gives you a free buffet for every 5 you purchase. not to mention they will make any pizza you ask for on their menu and put it up on the line within 10 mins. this place only offers a limited pizza menu. they don't even offer their featured pizzas. I am seriously annoyed that this place had 5 people working and a manager. we got there at 11am and there was a sign in the desert area for the apple/Bavarian pizza but there was nothing there. tons of cinnamon which is mostly bread with hardly any cinnamon sauce. everything was out except for the desert that was missing. around 11:15 my son asked if they were gonna put any out. they said they were working on it. 11:30 I ask and they said they are putting it in the oven. 11:45 my husband goes up there and they are just getting it into the oven. 12:00pm they say ""its in the oven now."" 12:15 pm it finally came out. pretty pathetic for 5 employees and a manager to handle 9 customers. seems like they are putting too much money in staff and need to put more money into quality.

So here we are and for $17 we get an all you can eat pizza experience with a 16 ounce cup of all you can drink beverages from the fountain. 

When you walk in, there's a salad bar when you come in and then a line of a variety of pizza which sits under hot lights. Those were  pretty decent but nothing to write home about. 

You can also get a small pan pizza freshly made to order. I had a veggie pizza made which was very good, the best of the three. The half cheese pizza was kind of what I expected. Tastes like the kiddie pizza you'd get at a skating ring. The other half which had chicken cubes was disgusting, a really low quality item. Hated it after 2 bites and left the other three slices on the pan. 

I'm somewhat miffed on 2 stars or 3 because the place was clean and some of the pizza was good. The low quality meat feels like a rip off, but for just 8.50 for a drink and all you can eat pizza and little desserts,it's a really good deal on the go when you want to get filled up without burning a hole through your wallet. 

The folks were also really kind and satisfied your order quickly. The place suffers from a lack of enthusiasm and/or pride from staff and the lack of quality ingredients in some cases.

This place is a good value for the price. It's got a salad bar and the feature I like the best is that you can custom order any pizza you want and they make it for you.

We arrived really not knowing what to expect, but the staff (thinking is was a manager) was very friendly, but most of all the one person that stuck out as friendly, helpful and smiling the whole time was the gentleman cleaning the facility tables and floors.

LOCATION
=========

Not nearly as big as I envisioned in my head. Their website listed 24 varieties of pizza so I imagines a looooong buffet line. Nope. There's like 10 pizzas out and every 10 mins they rotate new ones in and out. There's also desserts, salad and pasta on the buffet.


=========
THE FOOD
=========

~ MAC 'N CHEESE PIZZA - The best item on the menu. Your basic pizza slice with with Cheddar sauce on top instead of mozzarella. Mac n' Cheese atop... so bad for you but so good. (4/5)

~ CINNAMON ROLLS - Decadently delicious homemade cinnamon rolls topped with icing. They weren't cinnabons but REALLY REALLY good nonetheless. (4/5)

~ ALFREDO SPINACH PIZZA - A creamy alfredo sauced slice, topped with mozzarella spinach and herbs/seasoning on top. (4/5)

~ CLASSIC CHICKEN PIZZA -  Diced chicken, fresh sliced mushrooms with zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)

~ ZESTY VEGGIE - It's a veggie with WHITE sauce. Pretty good. Freshly sliced mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, diced tomatoes and black olives with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese and Parmesan oregano seasoning on our traditional crust. (4/5)

~ BAVARIAN DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Really good. Rich Bavarian cream filling served with sweet crumb topping on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)

~ APPLE DESSERT PIZZA PIE - Surprisingly good as well. Warm cinnamon apples and sweet crumb topping drizzled with icing on our dessert pizza crust. (4/5)


~ DEEP DISH PEPPERONI & JALAPENO - It was surprisingly decent. (3/5)

~ BUFFALO CHICKEN PIZZA - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust. Closer to a 2.5, it's hard to make a mediocre Buffalo Chicken pizza but they managed. (3/5)

~ OLE - It was ""supposed"" to be like a taco, it's a big mess of whatever. Beef crumbles and fresh lettuce with spicy red sauce topped with shredded cheddar cheese on our traditional crust. (2/5)

~ PEPPERONI - It was ""whatever."" (2/5)

~ PASTA - It was pretty bad. (1/5)

~ BREADSTICKS - They ""looked"" good but they were terrible. Waaaaay too salty. (1/5)


===================
THINGS I WANT TO TRY
===================

HOG FEST - Crisp bacon, Italian sausage, sliced ham and pepperoni with classic tomato sauce topped with shredded cheddar and pizza cheese on our traditional crust.

BBQ CHICKEN - Diced chicken, zesty Buffalo sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and drizzled with Buffalo sauce for that extra kick on our traditional crust.

ZESTY HAM & CHEDDAR - Sliced ham and sharp cheddar cheese with our zesty Parmesan ranch sauce topped with shredded Italian pizza cheese on our traditional crust.

GARLIC ITALIANO - Diced tomatoes, sliced red onions and black olives, garlic butter sauce topped with Italian pizza cheese and garlic oregano parmesan seasoning on our thin and crisp Italiano crust.

FINAL THOUGHTS
===============

There's a $5.00 all of July special going on which was awesome. All-in-all it's not the best BUT for $5 I can't complain. Some of the pizza was horrible, some was decent... a few items were good.

Service:  Friendly enough.  But the staff stand around for the most part.

Atmosphere:  Typical buffet restaurant.  Quite popular with locals.

Food:  Meh- but incredibly cheap!  While the buffet itself (filled with an unlimited pizza and salad bar) is $5.99, you can get an individual slice for 81 cents.   Yes, 81 cents.   The slices are really small and not that remarkable, but you get what you pay for.

I bought the pepperoni stuffed crust and the garlic veggie slices.  The former was really doughy, had a sauce that was reminiscent of ketchup and was doused with too much butter, but did the trick.  I liked the garlic veggie slice, but unfortunately the crust was so thin it reminded me of water crackers.

Before we paid we asked if they had stuffed crust and thing crust and Alfredo... they said yes.  After we paid we found out that they had nothing . They were out of most pizza and sauces and dressings.  They said ""next Tuesday they will have everything back in stock"".  So we asked for our money back. Did not get it.  So we walked out and ate nothing.   7 years of going to cicis... no more.",9rIkb2m9irpWoE_ln6ZPPA,0,0,1,G_H0TkEbHeDl-t-k_K_v3A

Finally gave it a shot and wished that I had not given it a second thought.

It's not even that cheap, if you consider the total after drinks are added.

The quality is just not there of course. Not going to find anything gourmet in their AYCE buffet.

I guess I am one that prefers quality over quantity.

The $18 bucks or so we spent for two was not worth it by any means.

I am not a fan of cheese covered cardboard which is their version of pizza.

Oh well I tried it, now I know what it is all about.

Life will go on without ever consuming their cardboard cuisine again.

They seem to keep up with the freshness of their food so that's good. Customer service is friendly which is always a plus. Thanks for the pizza. It was good .,YOImIB91eptt0y2WVjiHqQ,0,0,4,SOL7Asysd3Juj939jmD9Iw
