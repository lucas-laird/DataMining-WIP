I don't know how anyone can say that it is, being that most of the L&L franchises are owned by Chinese or Vietnamese.  If you want authentic Hawaiian food come to Hawai'i, but even then you will have to search for the REAL deal because not many places make it real.  Unless you go to someone's home or lu'au.  In O'ahu, there are maybe 3 places that have authentic Hawaiian food.  It's rare...but it includes things like poi, lau lau, lomi salmon, lomi oio, pipikaula, haupia, opihi, poke w/ inamona (kukui nut) and limu kohu...better yet go to the outer islands.",1mOUEhTj5yI8YiKN15B7OQ,1,0,1,_xqYLRVZfUz_4D9ko_1uyQ

I have been to L&L many times, across the valley and I was introduced to it when I first visited Cali.  I kid you not, I have had the most fulfilling expericneces eating at L&L but alas I can't say that about the experience I had here.  

The funny thing is, I can't put my finger on it, I have tried to do it in my mind but I have failed multiple times.  I just know that I left there feeling empty, not literally because as everyone knows they give you a lot of food, but figuratively.  I had the Mix Plate which is a staple for most Hawaiian food establishments but for some reason or another it tasted like it had no soul.  Believe me when I say I am bumming myself out writing this review right now, I almost want to change the 3 star rating to 2 stars but I do have to remember that I did leave full but something was missing.

408894,2011-02-22,0,44xBONbuMSghULXXEnl-Lw,"This is actually the first L&L I have been to on the Mainland. I have to say, it wasn't bad. 

Having lived on Oahu, I had one near my house & would go there every now & again, just cuz it was close by & when I needed my Teri BBQ fix or chow mein, from this particular location anyways. It was good in a pinch, when I couldn't get to my non-chain faves. But on Oahu they are all hit or miss. Some have different items, to include Chinese fare. However, the quality & choices vary by location. 

I have been to a few of the other Hawaiian BBQ places near my side of town (the now defunct Aloha A Go Go & Aloha Kitchen, not so great review to follow on the latter) & have been pretty disappointed. Especially in the mac salad! 

So, as far as this place goes...4 stars for the portions! I had the large BBQ mix plate. I opened up the container & was pleasantly surprised! 2 nice big slabs of Kalbi, about 3 slices or so of Teri Beef & about 3 HUGE pieces of Teri Chicken, 2 scoops rice & 1 scoop mac salad. All I gotta say is...WOW! Great flavor on everything, especially the mac salad, just as good as any I have had in Hawaii!! This was the next best thing to being in Hawaii :) My roomie, Nicki G. had the same, but with triple mac salad!!! Ever since I turned her onto Hawaiian BBQ, she can't get enough. 

I left off the 5th star for cleanliness & the flat fountain Dr Pepper :( Oh yeah & cuz they serve Pepsi!! One thing I would love to see as a beverage, that some of the ones in Hawaii have...Slushies...with ice cream in them!! 

My roomie has been to the Centennial one & says this location has better portions. I am going to try the one closer to me, in Summerlin. Hopefully this one will e as good, otherwise I will be driving over to the East side to get my fix. Oh & trust me, I will!!",JUeGFCsprKVUYok4oLsdEA,0,0,4,xbJ42yhzQbCvQ7tOpvGGsg

1347041,2013-05-02,1,44xBONbuMSghULXXEnl-Lw,"On walkabout on the outskirts of Vegas, southeast of the Strip, I saw this small fast-food stop standing alone in the far corner of a mall parking lot, next to a car wash.  Hawaiian?  Barbeque?  Yes and yes.
Inside was reasonably clean and well ordered for a small grease joint, and I looked up and down the menu for something that would allow me to explore without getting too much of any one thing... and I settled on the Seafood Platter with Chicken Katsu.  After all, for $12, how big could it be?

Oh... my... word.  When it came out I thought they had the wrong table... it was a rectangular styrofoam takeout container, same as you typically get Chinese food combination plates in, but it was STUFFED to the brim with food.  And they didn't just pack it with rice, either... it was a generous serving of katsu, shrimp, and mahi mahi each, all in a big glistening pile over a scoop of rice and some shredded cabbage (to help move the grease along, I guess.)
And the container was so full that they put the sides (some kind of Hawaiian macaroni salad) actually on the side in another container.  Plus two tubs of katsu sauce.

I managed to finish it all, including the super-rich macaroni salad (which I probably should have skipped, my dietician now advises me), and stagger out of there in an ambulatory food coma.

If you fiend for a pile of deep-fry Aloha style, get here.  Do they do Loco Moco?  Of course.  Got a good, healthy heart, no history of heart disease, and exercise regularly?  Come on down and change your oil, this place is awesome. Mahalo!",l-1g7hDc1bS1xjtyxY79hw,0,0,4,GTeXlQ2yCCJzokh_Dvo7_A

The building is in a location where you see homeless people sometimes gathering at night in a particular corner of the parking lot. Now the food here actually taste good and it's quite affordable. The person who place my order is Mandy and she has been phenomenal in striking great conversations, delivering exceptional service, and ensuring that every order is correct. 

I chose Chicken Katsu ($7.95) with Brown Rice ($0.30) and Macaroni Salad. The food is made fast and it is serve hot. The portions are abundant. The texture of the deep-fried Chicken Katsu taste crispy yet the meat inside is tender. I love dipping chicken in that sweet katsu sauce, it just makes the food delicious. And the mayo in the Macaroni Salad is very light and it goes well with brown rice.

In addition to my order, I opt for the Healthy BBQ Chicken ($8.25) as a takeout. The BBQ Chicken also has brown rice and it comes with a fresh green salad. I request for a side of a thousand island dressing, and an extra Macaroni Salad ($0.99). The meat taste very tender and I'm finding out when I dip the BBQ chicken in a thousand island and eat that with brown rice, my taste bud is liking it. The fun part of dipping is trying a different flavor and that to me feels like an adventure.

The next year after it closed, I had my first trip out to Vegas being over 21.  L&L was immediately on the agenda, and it was again just this past week.  The mix BBQ plate is amazing, as is the chicken katsu.  I also love he macaroni salad that comes with every dish.  The SPAM musubi is good if you like SPAM and REALLY love rice (there's a bit much of it).

Sadly, this location is a bit lacking, especially compared to the one that used to be on the university.  No free cilantro soup here, and the entrance to the washroom is outside like at a gas station.  If you live in the area, I'd say take the food to go.

2799010,2012-01-23,0,44xBONbuMSghULXXEnl-Lw,"I was disappointed.

Right off the bat... they didn't have a restroom.  My 4-year old was doing the potty dance and they couldn't help me.  We had to walk across the parking lot to Albertson's (which is why I don't think this is a good location for kids...even if it's also next to a Toys R Us haha).

Second, and probably most important, our food was bland.  We ordered a saimin, a lau lau/ short rib combo and the super low carb plate.  

Saimin was alright, but my daughter didn't get to enjoy it while it was warm due to her mid-meal trek to the restroom.  

My lau lau (oven cooked meat and greens wrapped in a banana leaf packet) was super bland and mostly green.   There was literally one 1inchx1inch cube of beef.  When I used to make this at home (or eat it at a luau in Hawaii) it would be packed with beef, pork and fish... at least one chunk of each. Not here. Not this L&L.  My short rib was ok; a little greasy, but that is to be expected, but also very bland... like they kind of just dipped it in sauce after cooking instead of marinating the meat for any period of time.

The whole bland thing killed the super low carb plate.  It was loaded ... eggs, bbq chicken, bbq beef, shortribs, no rice... Not a bad deal, I guess, for $12. But, again, the meat, the chicken, everything tasted like it was missing something....

My recommendations is that you go with spam musabis, chicken and/or seafood/fish plates and avoid the beef as it can be a bit salty and is styled after but isn't as tasty as my #1 love, Korean BBQ.

Let me explain further. The counter person would greet us with a smile. But as we would pull out the BOGO coupon, the smile immediately turned into a frown, which clearly showed disappointment that we were using a coupon. So, finally after years of unwilling participation, they are no longer in the Entertainment Book. My husband says that we are the single cause for that- ha-ha. We went to the other one on Maryland Parkway also, but they never gave us any problems when we used a coupon. The service is better at that location.  

The food is good. We always get  the chicken katsu and the barbeque chicken (order it skinless) and we split it- that's our thing. The regular pac is pretty big and we always bring home the rest.

Everyone who's a fan of chicken katsu sauce knows that it's the sauce that makes the meal. We weren't really upset that we had to do this but we were upset that when we purchased two extra sauces that it was only filled halfway. The other hiccup was that the lady isn't the best at customer service, she gave us the wrong change and so my mom just went to correct it and right after my mom turns around, she says rude things about my mom and in English too. It's not a crowded restaurant and we're only halfway through our meal so that was really uncomfortable. It put everyone in a bad mood so we just packed up and left.

The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the customer service. I don't expect people to stop eating here because it is a chain but if I were you, I'd just spend my money elsewhere. It's not worth it to get treated rudely and be disrespected.",FFP8PeRas97ekr1JcU9kiQ,0,0,2,NU4hF7v0whzHaFtZECex7Q
4453602,2017-09-27,0,44xBONbuMSghULXXEnl-Lw,Ordered on Postmates app and my order came completely wrong. I ordered a BBQ Mix plate and they sent Chicken Katsu and then completely forgot my drink so now I'm expected to choke down this breaded chicken and rice with nothing to wash it down with and then they wouldn't even answer their phone a half an hour before they close.  Hey 9th Islander just because the Pakalolo is legal here now doesn't mean you can handle da kine like could back home eh.

4620896,2012-03-08,0,44xBONbuMSghULXXEnl-Lw,"My first reaction to this place was that it had a bad smell, like a teenagers room with used clothes and dishes all over the floor. My friend wanted to use the restroom and asked if there was one. The guy mumbled something that we couldnt understand and pointed to the back of the building. My friend went outside to check but found out there was no bathroom to be found.

My friend and I stopped here for lunch. He ordered a regular chicken katsu plate and I ordered a regular lau lau kalua combo plate. It was awful! The katsu was very dry like they fried it too long. The lau lau combo was dry as well. I usually enjoy eating the fatty pieces along with the moist pork and fish cubes like they usually serve it in Hawaii. But not here! Every piece of pork was dry. There was probably just a small piece of fat, and no fish at all. The kalua and cabbage was gross. No taste. It was also dry like the other dishes. They served it with mac salad, which was okay, and a container of what I think was shoyu, but it didn't taste anything like Aloha shoyu or even kikkoman. Not sure.

Overall, we walked out with partly filled sore stomachs. I would not recommend this place for Hawaiian food. Instead, look for Island Style on Sahara! 100x better food and even better service!",0nDeoyxAaWHcihihxiIa3A,0,0,1,LpmET50iRjy3D65q1pRqwg

I really enjoyed my first experience there, loving their pork lau lau and other goodies like their chicken katsu and short ribs.  I even gave them a four stars that first time.  However, things have since changed...

Their regular pork lau lau order came with two scoops of rice, a scoop of mac salad and two pork lau laus for $8.50  There was nothing special about it this time.  It was rather dry and just not enough fatty goodness to make it good.  I actually had leftovers this time, and when it's good stuff...I eat it all!  The mac salad and rice were only okay too. 

The BF ordered the Seafood Combo Plate Lunch ($8.20).  It's not the Seafood Combo on their menu, but the one from the picture on the wall.  It had three pieces of fried shrimp, deep fried mahi mahi, and beef short ribs.  Two scoops of rice and a mac salad come with that combo too.  Nothing special once again.

Counter service was okay.  The girl at the register is obviously bored and it's very routine for her to be working there.

Overall, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at this L & L, especially after really enjoying it the first time.  You probably won't find me back here again any time soon.

The restaurant itself is a casual-dinning place to eat with friends or by yourself. The staff is friendly and they get the job done correctly. The cleanliness is not at its best but it is not to an unpleasant point.

It's on the cross streets of maryland and flamingo, and could be easily missed. It's looks like a worn down brown shack, but the inside is cleaner than expected. It was pretty empty when we came in, but by the time we left it was popping. 

The employee was very polite and cleaned up after people when they left. I ordered the chicken katsu in a small which is the perfect size for a lunch, anything more you would have leftovers. 

The chicken katsu was flawlessly cooked, crunchy yet soft in the inside. It also came with macaroni salad which was good, you can't really mess up macaroni salad.

So for $6 including tax, I'd say this is a great place to come during lunch or any of your classes after unlv.

Only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is how long the food takes to come out, there were only two customers ahead of me but it still took awhile for me to receive my food.",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,2,1,4,S3IyeyPgyLmEG5UVrv6oUw

At first glance, the place looked deserted.  Couldn't see anything inside the windows since it was dark inside (and maybe the angle of the sun) and the parking lot around the restaurant looked unkept.  Weeds growing around and just plain dirty.  I saw some movement in the window and went closer to check it out.  Sure enough, they were open. 

They offer a special if you order 3 musubis instead of just one.  So I got six spam musubi and 3 portuguese sausage (not for myself mind you, had the fam in the car).  Service was ok, not overly ""Ohana"" as one would expect, but served it's purpose.  They only offered water cups in little dixie cups.  No lids which is always a pain when traveling.  I guess that's their ploy to get you to buy something with a lid or that won't easily spill.  We're just big water drinkers and not a lot of soda.

Anyway, the musubis were on par with what we'd expect from L&L and it hit the spot for all involved, so it's all good.

I flew to LA (Los Angeles Airport) and meet with some people for a task development. I was only down there for only 2.5 hours without eating anything. 

Then with the next three days off from my job, I immediately flew to Las Vegas for another assignment...""party""!

After arriving McCarran Airport and becoming dark quickly at 4pm, I drove down Maryland Parkway and saw a huge ""Happy Hour Special"" banner in front of L &L. on Tropicana Ave. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OJofPDW-G_OPVKz84Fhbxg?select=yoqpk5PpbUZRWrHX5cqf1g

When I opened the styrofoam container, I had the look of horror on my face. The bbq ribs were not marinated or grilled, but simply thrown on the griddle. I bit into a piece and it was horrible. Disgusted, dejected, mad, and sad at the same time, I threw the rest away. I ate a bag of Funyuns for dinner. Funyuns.

5457468,2013-05-21,2,44xBONbuMSghULXXEnl-Lw,"From the outside, this seems like a semi-decent ""restaurant"". I came in here today for two reasons: 1, the L&L by my job (aka, the one on Maryland and Sahara aka, my favorite place in the whole entire world) was PACKED to the point where the line reached my parked car and 2, because I trusted it would taste the same. Boy was I wrong! 
   To start off on a bad foot, I walked into the restaurant and was greeted by this putrid smell of what I could only describe as resembling ""Mothballs""? I, stupidly, decided to place an order anyways and was surprised to learn that my usual BBQ Chicken Bowl was one penny more than at my  usual location, but at this point, I was hungry and didn't even care. 
   After I sat there and pondered about my many life goals, achievements and the proverbial ""one that got away"" for the next 5 minutes, my bowl was finally ready.
   I looked up and was mildly pleased to find that the Chicken Bowl at this location was about 30% larger than the Sahara location's... but that mild pleasure was soon to meet its demise for it did not know the disaster that was about to ensue.
   I opened my bowl and was almost knocked out by the warm mothball smell that wafted my way... I wanted to vomit at that exact moment... but again, my extreme hunger forced me to press onward! 
   Alas! I came across my usual favorite part of the meal: the Chicken. 
   Words cannot describe the injustice that was performed upon this chicken... The Skin; left on only to have been scorched in the cooking process... The BBQ Sauce; almost nonexistent. And finally, the smell- I can't stress how much this all smelled of mothballs. 
   As I sadly tossed the whole thing in the trash, I wondered if I should even make a fuss, ""$5.40 for THAT? I'm going to ask for a refund"", I thought. But I digress, no fuss was made.
