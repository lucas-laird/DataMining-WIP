Huge line of customers waiting, half the tables waiting to be bussed, multiple servers just waiting at the kitchen window for food, and the hostess tells us ""it's going to be a while."" What?!?! When we finally got seated, we had to walk around the dirty tables hunting for clean spoons and sauce dishes. When the spring and egg rolls arrived, we had no napkins or plates and the knife we asked for never came.  The table next to us were told they ran out of utensils, probably because they didn't clean tables. Waited over an hour for our pho!!! Were they making the soup from scratch??? Got 2 plates of veggies for 3 bowls of pho and our request for a third was ignored.

Banh Khot was good but was not large enough for an entree. Perhaps they can give customers an option for larger size if you want to eat it as a meal instead of an appetizer.

Rice and pho dishes were good and authentic.

I don't recommend the Banh Xeo, since it took a long time to come out. Also, it was skimpy on the meat in the crust, and could use a little bit more filling (mung beans and sprouts), and the dipping sauce was way too salty so you couldn't dip the Banh Xeo in the sauce too much.

I order a bun tom thit noung that was decent. It came out in a big bowl and had too much noodle for the amount of meat it had. I felt it was very disproportional. The food I had here today is 3/5.

Their most popular item is the nem nuong cuon which is delicious, especially paired with their special made sauce. When it opened, it was reported to be a ""sister"" location of Brodard, hence the different name. Being a fan of viet foods, that means it bringing the other types of various viet cuisine aside from the usual pho. 

My friend and I came here on her lunch break (30 minutes). We were quickly seated and ordered. We told the waitress we were on a time crunch and needed it to be fast! Luckily, they did speed it up and we received our food, ate, and paid fairly quickly. 

We had shared an order of nem nuong cuon and a com tam bi cha suon nuong 

Nem Nuong Cuon (grilled pork sausage spring roll) - $4.95 for 2 rolls - when i saw the price, i was a bit surprised. If i remembered correctly, it was about $1.50/roll at Brodards. Ok, maybe it was a transporting fee, or something. When the rolls came out, it seemed smaller. Ok. Took a bite. It seemed similar but seemed like something was missing. When i tried the sauce, i was surprised how HOT the sauce was. I definitely dont recall the sauce being hot. Luke warm to warm at most. Ok. Maybe they just made the sauce. The sauce tastes completely different. It was really underwhelming. It didnt have those mysterious tangy bright flavors the sauce at Brodard had. Overall, quite disappointing. May

Com tam bi cha suon nuong - (broken rice plate with shredded pork, egg meatloaf, pork chop, shrimp, and deep fried shrimp cake wrapped in soybean curd) - $11.95 - Overall, was a decent size. This kind of fed two people. So portion size, pretty good.  The pork chop and shrimp were a bit underwhelming. Need more seasoning. The deep fried shrimp cake wrapped in soybean curd is pretty good. Freshly fried so soybean curd skin was nice and crispy while the shrimp cake was still moist and hot. Egg meatloaf is pretty good. one of my favorite viet foods. 

Overall, food was ok. Maybe i was too hyped for this place and was a bit disappointed when i experienced it. Service overall was decent. Got things to us in a good timely manner. 

Maybe give them a few months to get up to speed and maybe change it up a bit. Hope for the better. Would really love to have a different viet restaurant to go to =P",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,3,FQfPDpEknCyBVWUf8iCHzQ

I'm sure a lot of you say that you have had spring rolls in your life. But trust me, after trying the nem nuong here... You have never had spring rolls in yo life!!!

I've never been to Brodards, the Cali based spring roll institution, which I hear has the same owners as Nem Nuong. After seeing the pics on what made Brodards so famous, I had to check it out.

The restaurant is really well designed. It is probably the most upscale Vietnamese restaurant in town. After sitting down and ordering our food, it came at a reasonable time.

Nem Nuong - these are basically pork spring rolls. But, not the run-of-the-mill ones that are typically served. That would be like comparing a Little Ceasars pizza to one made by an Italian Michelin rated restaurant. I think that what sets it apart is the fried egg roll shell that they stuff inside the roll. It gives it a marvelous crunch!! I was wondering, while eating it, why doesn't every place do this? It should be the law. And, I will enforce it... like Judge Dredd. Because I am the law. The pork was a generous piece that was really tender and well seasoned. It was probably one of the best bites I've had all year! But from what I've been hearing, they are a little bit overpriced as compared to Brodard's, but that's typical of Vegas food as compared to So-cal food.

Bahn Xeo - Now if you guys know me, my favorite Vietnamese food in the whole world is not pho, but actually their take on the Crepe. But this is not like the French version. It is more like a giant omelet (kinda), and it is stuffed with seafood and bean sprouts, and you eat it like a Korean ssam wrap, with lettuce, mint, sesame leaves, and pickled vegetables. I thought the one here was OK. It didn't blow me away. The inside seemed a little bit pasty and undercooked.

I would like to come back here and try their pho and broken rice dishes. Their nem nuong is legit and would encourage everyone to try it out!

I ordered the combo spring rolls which included the pork sausage spring rolls and shrimp paste spring rolls. These rolls are awesome and the sauce they give you to dip it in (TELL ME YOUR WAYS!) I also ordered the glass noodle pho which wasn't good AT ALL. The broth wasn't good, the glass noodles weren't of the right consistency and the chicken was average. 

My friend tasted my glass noodle soup as well and said it tasted like soapy water. Service here wasn't bad, and a check-in gives you 10% off your order or $30 or more!  I'll definitely be back because all my friends enjoyed their orders and it must've just been the glass noodle that wasn't good. Going to stick to my usual next time, combo beef soup #1!",WLuI_fMi1BIbNhIBSoxgoQ,3,3,4,jpn3wsJxxiag-dvcjXk-Ww

The dipping sauce is fantastic, the mix of meats doesn't sound like it would work but it does. Add in fresh herbs and spring roll skins, and you've got a great snack or light meal for under $6- but I'm confident you couldn't actually share these with anyone, so either don't let anyone taste them or order a separate plate for each diner.

I got excited that they offered Nem Nuong Spring Rolls and was even more happy to find out that they are the same family as Brodard's Restaurant in Orange County who are famous for their spring rolls!

SETTING:

The outside of the building doesn't look quite pleasing. Its part of a strip complex and looks a bit run down from the outside.

But inside its clean and bright. 

Plenty of tables and chairs.

Got seated immediately and ordered our drinks and appetizers.

FOOD:

Nem Nuong Spring Roll (2) $4.95
(Sweet Pork Meat with Crunchy Eggroll Paper and Veggies)

The spring roll itself was delicious. The sauce was average. It is a bit lacking in flavor compared to Brodard's famous dipping sauce. But I would still recommend it anyways.

Banh Canh Tom Cua $8.95
(Vietnamese Udon Noodle Soup with Crab, Shrimp and Shrimp Cakes)

One of my favorite vietnamese dishes. It's not served at many places so I was excited to try this as well. Soup had a good light flavor and had many bits of real crab meat. The shrimp cakes were a bit lacking but at least there was also three juicy shrimps to go with it. The dish is also lightly sprinkled with green onions and fried onions.

Brodards is a famous Vietnamese restaurant in the southern California area.  They are most well known for spring rolls that are Bomb.com

According to one the employees at nem nuong, a relative of the owner of brodards opened nem nuong which is why everything here taste so good.

It is without a doubt one of the best places to go to for some quick and easy yet still absolutely tasty Vietnamese food.  Don't be shy to order anything ranging from the pho soups, rice dishes, noodle dishes, or even their famous spring rolls (yes I ordered all of the above so I know).

And after a night of debauchery, this place just hits the spot.  Unfortunately, they do not do delivery... But you can call in ahead and then have whoever gets the shortest straw go pick it up for you.

The place is located a little aways from the strip (2-3 miles) in Chinatown but it's a pretty neat area to visit.  I was surprised at the amount of decent restaurants and food choices here.

Luckily for Las Vegas locals, the owners decided to open a branch in China Town along Spring Mountain and named it after what they're famous for.

The restaurant was surprisingly packed for a Wednesday night considering they've only been opened for a week!  I knew this place was going to be a hit since we were the only two who didn't speak the language; everybody else appeared to be an expert of Vietnamese cuisine which they seemed to enjoy eating.

Started out with Nem Nuong Cuon (grilled pork sausage spring rolls seved with house special sauce). These are certainly worth the hype and even one of the better ones I've had in the valley.  I like how they add fried egg roll wrappers which adds extra crunch and texture.  The dish also comes with a sauce unlike the typical peanut sauce served at any other Vietnamese joints.  These spring rolls are so good I asked her to stop by the next day for more!!

Banh Khot (rice cakes topped with whole shrimp, mung bean, and scallions) wrapped in lettuce with other accoutrements was actually quite tasty.  However, I prefer the pancake version, Banh Xeo, which are usually stuffed with slivers of pork, whole shrimp, green onions and bean sprouts.

Tried some of Stephanie's fried rice which was good but was a little creeped out by Michael's crepe.

We had the spring rolls, the nem nuong rolls and the #12 flank steak. Spring rolls were so so kinda over cooked.

Great banh khot (mini luna pancakes with shrimp) and above average bun cha gio thit nuong (cold vermicelli rice noodles with egg rolls, grilled beef), and nuoc cham (sweet fish sauce). Price is pretty steep (I think it was about $5 for 2 spring rolls), but it sure beats driving 4 hours to Brodard so I'll take it!!)

I think I can speak on behalf of a lot of my foodie friends, when I say - OMG! They have Brodard here now! With the crack sauce and errrrythang!

Sitting pretty in the heart of China Town, right next door to Beauty to Beauty Salon and in the same strip mall as Joyful House Chinese restaurant, you'll see a large Grand Opening/ Vietnamese French Cuisine banner for them (they don't have their official signage yet).

Alright, so you might be wondering why am I so freaking excited that this restaurant is in town...We just moved here from Southern California and Brodard in Garden Grove was the dominating force in (Vietnamese) spring rolls. Their (crack) sauce is the most talked about sauce in Orange County! (I eat it like soup, it's that good...) Turns out that Nem Nuong Bistro gets shipped the real deal nem nuong (pork patties) and (crack) sauce from Brodard weekly! What a relief! 

One of the brothers from the wildly popular Brodard in Garden Grove owns Nem Nuong Bistro. So the rumors are true, they're offering up the same spring rolls as Brodard in CA! Well, almost the same -- They put more of the crispy fried eggroll wrapper in their rolls and a little less nem nuong meat compared to Brodard (to cut costs?), but you really can't tell the difference. It's still bomb as fuuuuuh. The sauce is exactly the same! Rocked my face off! Damn good. 

The rest of the dishes are still being ironed out and are not identical to Brodard, but that's more than ok with me - I thought they did a great job and my compliments to the chef! 

We also tried their banh khot appetizer (mini luna pancakes with shrimp lettuce wraps.) The luna cakes were crispy on the bottom and had great turmeric flavor. They were extremely addicting. 

We shared the bun cha gio thit nuong (cold vermicelli noodles topped with grilled beef, egg rolls, veggies, peanuts, and served with nuoc cham (sweet fish sauce). It's the perfect summer dish for Nevada's scorching hot weather! I'm typically very picky with this dish since I'm Vietnamese and cook it all the time, but I found their version to be delicious, refreshing, and I scarfed it down. They gave plentiful moist grilled beef, though the egg rolls were heavy on the wrapper, it was still better than most. They also gave a heaping amount of noodles - there was an excess of noodles at the end. 

The restaurant is new, clean, with modern asian decor. They have only been open for 5 weeks and they are already running out of those spring rolls! When we ate here, they were down to their last rolls, so we were limited on how many rolls we could order - we were only able to snag 2 rolls total. (Yup, they are that sought out!) 

Also, amazing service from start to finish! Our server Lam is a great guy! Very respectful, friendly, efficient and all around stand-up guy. Felt like we knew him for years!

The Crispy Chicken Skin was a small half bird deep fried with delicious moist crispy golden skin along with red rice (tomato/ketchup rice). The plate is very large and eye catching. The Rice in Clay Pot is okay, the rice is slightly brunt at the bottom so it was really crispy but it wasn't as flavorful. The Broken Rice has a lot on the plate including choice of grilled pork or ribs, it's delicious and satisfying. The HaiNam chicken is small, only few pieces but it is packed with flavor. I heard it's made from organic chicken (ga di bo) so the bird is small and skinny but very delicious, a small plate goes a long way with white flavored rice made from its chicken stock.

Both dishes were meh. It could be that I am Vietnamese so my expectations are a bit high or the food simply is average. IF you are from California, where the Viet food is more authentic, then this is not the place for you. You will leave disappointed.

I thought the ones at Pho Bosa were better. At least this restaurant was a million times cleaner than Pho Bosa and they also had working air conditioning. 

For my meal, I ordered the Crispy Chicken Skin with tomato rice, but shortly after placing my order, the waiter informed me that they were out the chicken. So I went with the Shaking Beef instead. It was not bad. The portion was a little small, but it had little cubes of filet mignon.

I guess I haven't been in this area for a year now but it's so different. So many new places to eat. Anyways we came by for lunch. It's not too big and it wasn't very full either. We ordered a few combo plates of the spring rolls for the table. For a place, known for the spring rolls, it was very good. And then I started reading the reviews that it's comparable or the sister restaurant to Brodards in the OC and I would say it's one of the most similar places to Brodards but Brodards is still better. I do like that the spring rolls here are served cut in half so it's easier to eat. They brought individual bowls of the sauce for everyone, which was nice. But the sauce isn't as great here. I definitely preferred the pork over the shrimp spring rolls. They had more flavor. Also I think the cucumbers in the spring rolls were pickled. But the spring rolls had that nice fried wonton skin in there to give it a crunchy texture. Mmm. For my main entrée I had the banh canh tom cua. It was these thick udon noodles with seafood (fishcake, shrimp crabmeat) in a thick red syrupy type broth. I've never had this before and I really liked it. I think it's similar to bun rieu. They're not really a pho place but I think the majority of the people got that. They do offer three kinds of pho though - everything, just beef, and chicken. They have mostly vermicelli and broken rice dishes. Service was fine. The guy who took our order was really nice and memorized our whole order even though there were like 10 of us. A little pricey for pho/Viet food but that's comparing it to competitive LA prices. I'm sure it's normal for Vegas.",shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g,2,2,4,C0vjlHk1Ft_uWF_uNFavUw

The place is new so it was clean, nice artwork, and a lot of employees lol.

Our server was a friendly older gentlemen. He was pretty good! He have us some suggestions before our meal and even advice on some things we may come back for.

Had the pork patty spring rolls to start. With two to an order it was $5. This was good! I liked the dipping sauce as it wasn't overly strong. What's the point of having fresh ingredients in a spring roll when your sauce over powers it?


My friend had the beef pho. $7 The bowl was small, but there were a lot of noodles. My friend said it was a bit sweeter than normal pho. Also that's really well priced IMO.

I had the vermicelli noodle salad with grilled beef and egg roll. The ingredients were fresh.

I was pretty disappointed in mine though overall. The meat portion was a little skimpy as was the tiny cut up egg roll. After mixing it around it tasted good, but nothing special.

Overall I had a good visit. Didn't try more. It was pretty average but I gave them a four because there was nothing necessarily bad I experienced and for the server.

Just want to say I'm huge on service. We had our drinks refilled frequently and being friendly goes a long way. I refuse to frequent restaurants like pho Kim long who don't seem to value their diners. The friendliness went a long way.

Overall this was a solid Vietnamese restaurant that I enjoyed and will return to. Is it the best? No. Will I rush to come back? No.

For those that don't want to be gnawing on chicken bone, they have a boneless sliced chicken breast option too.

The Pork Spring Rolls are probably the best in this city as they make the pork meat sausage in house and serve with a warm slight peanut-y sauce. Like the famous Vietnamese restaurant in So Cal, Nem Nuong puts in a skinny fried egg roll of sort for added texture to the roll. I like! 

By recommendations from Yuhi and Ardie, we also tried their Shaking Beef. I've had various versions of this dish and again, I think this is the best version in Las Vegas. The beef is tender and the red rice (tomato based flavoring) is tasty. 

All the other dishes (rice noodle bowl, rice plate) we tried were average and good to have again, but we can also get them at other Vietnamese restaurants in town too.

Nem Noung Bistro is my new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas!!! 

Came here on Memorial day weekend and was pleasantly surprised! My family has had a Vietnamese restaurant in the Bay Area for over 35 years so getting a good rating for Excellent Vietnamese food is as rare as winning the big jackpot in Las Vegas.

We order their specialty, Nem Nuong (Must Try!!) and Banh Khot (So Good) , Beef Salad, Bun Thit Noung Cha Gio, and Rice Plate with everything under the sun on it. The food was tasty and had the perfect flavoring. 

My parents, who are Vietnamese food critics in their own right, kept saying how impressed they were and how happy they have found a new place they can frequent now that they will be spending more time in Vegas for Retirement. 

The service was also very warm and friendly from everyone. Two in particular that I really appreciated was a waiter by the name of Dang and Laura, who is the new owner. I usually don't ask for names, especially at Vietnamese restaurants, but Dang always had a big sweet smile and I can feel that he wholeheartedly wanted to do a good job, which was more than I can say about some of the other places in town who ignored us most of the time. Laura also always made sure the food was good and our waters were full. 

They were also very apologetic that the food took a little longer than expected but I didn't feel that it took long at all. I mean it's Memorial Day weekend with a million Vietnamese people in town wanting to all eat at the same time. With 30+ years of working at my family's restaurant, I can empathize how hectic and stressful it must have been with a grand opening in the same weekend that Paris by Night show was going down. I personally believe that Nem Noung Bistro ( Brodards) did it flawlessly and I will definitely will be going here every time I come to Vegas!

4701551,2016-01-19,6,YH_3Z_-sFoWeG8QiuO1-oA,"Nem Nuong Cuon ($4.95): Grilled pork sausage, crispy spring roll, lettuce, cucumber, and carrot wrapped in rice paper. Served with house special sauce. Delicious!! The translucent rice paper was softened and easy to eat and the filling was flavorful and most importantly, crunchy! I loved the textures, especially from the crispy spring roll, and the fresh vegetables. The sauce is really wonderful, too. I love peanut sauces and this one is like peanut sauce meets sweet and sour.

Banh Khot ($8.95): Translated as ""Luna Rice Cake"" on the menu. Mini rice pancakes with steamed shrimp, accompanied by herbs and fresh and pickled vegetables. Plus, fish sauce for dipping. These cakes are supposedly tiny versions of their crepe-like pancakes and they definitely have the feel of crepes with more of an egg flavor. Each ""cup"" could have done with more than just half a shrimp, but otherwise, it's a very tasty dish. I enjoyed topping each cup with all the fresh herbs and vegetables, then dipping them into the fish sauce.

Com Tam Bi, Cha, Tau Hu Ky, Tom, Suon Nuong ($13.95): Combination broken rice with pork chop, egg loaf, shredded pork, grilled shrimp, fried shrimp paste in tofu skin, and pickled vegetables. You can choose either Pork Chop (22a) or Grilled Chop (22b) with this combination. I asked for the recommendation of the pork chop and I was very pleased with it. The pork was flavorful and succulent. The egg loaf was similar to a frittata though it wasn't anything special or particularly necessary to the platter. I felt the same way about the shredded pork. The grilled shrimp and fried shrimp paste were both lovely. I'm not sure if I'd like the shrimp paste by itself, but I really enjoyed it wrapped in tofu skin and fried. Overall, I liked this dish, but I'd prefer the toppings on vermicelli bowls (without the vermicelli).

I enjoyed my meal, but the only standout dish was really the Nem Nuong Cuon. The rolls were delicious and I could eat several of them in a sitting! The other dishes, though good, aren't enticing enough to return, but there are so many other dishes to try. Also, I'll definitely look into getting a vermicelli bowl with rice instead.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,7,4,UP5ZazobfEokbq4e-i2wAA

So on our way out from Vegas and heading home, my boyfriend and I stopped for a quick brunch in Chinatown Las Vegas. We got here earlier than their opening--by accident because I forgot to check their hours--and they were nice enough to open up 20 minutes earlier than they needed to.

We ordered the nem nuong rolls (because of course I want to know if they are just like Brodards), crispy chowmein (mi xao don) seafood combo, and broken rice dish with grilled pork (com tam thit nuong).

The nem nuong rolls are not bad. They just aren't meaty enough like Brodard so it didn't exceed my high expectations.  The meat to crunchy filler to vegetables were equal here.  I didn't get a chance to try the mi xao don because I have a shellfish allergy but it did look good. The broken rice were slightly soggy than most com tam dishes I've grown up eating, and portions were small.

I would have to say that the spring roll was decent and the sauce that goes with the roll was okay however, it was not the same as brodard for those who go to orange county for the nem nuong fix. 
This is probably a pretty decent smaller version substitute for it. 

The prices on the menu when i looked were pretty reasonable. 

When waiting for the roll, it appeared that the restaurant was pretty clean so if you want to go to a place that is cleaner than pho kim long that is down the road, this would be your best bet.

New (and delicious) Vietnamese joints popping up all over the place! In short, Nem Nuong Bistro is the business. Possibly, the only truly Cali-style Vietnamese in Vegas. I've heard Brodard it their Golden State counterpart? ...still to be confirmed.

Always start a meal off with the combination Nem Nuong Rolls. I've almost completely sworn off Cha Gio (Fried ""Egg Roll"")! 2 Nem Nuong Viet Sausage + 2 Shrimp Paste/Cake ($10.50 for 4) filled with crisp lettuce, and crispy fried egg roll wrapper bits wrapped in pleasantly chewy rice paper--slightly drier than spring roll paper. It comes with the most amazing sauce. I have no idea what's in it. It's sweet, salty, and savory. I asked once and the waitress said she has no idea what's in it either--just that it has peanuts for allergy reasons. -___-"" le sigh. 

Vermicelli Noodle Bowls: I go with #16-BBQ Pork, Nem Nuong, and Cha Gio. It's your standard noodle bowl. The pork is less fatty, somewhat thinly sliced in comparison to other places, and not heavily sauced or salted. It's different but I really enjoy it! It comes w/ your usual Nuoc Mam fish sauce but I scrape the last bits of my Nem Nuong Roll sauce and use a combination of the two. HEAVEN.

Pho: Their broth is HEAVY on the cloves. It's not my favorite pho in Vegas but it is quite tasty. I think District One, Pho So 1, and Pho Annie are still my pho-vrites. For you non-meat eaters, Nemz has a 100% veggie pho w/ lightly fried tofu cubes in place of beef. If you're a meat eater but cutting back on your meat consumption, Chef suggests veggie pho w/ chicken broth. Much improved taste. (Happy Hour 4-6pm $5.95/bowl)

Bun Bo Hue: I'm not an expert on Bun Bo Hue. I've only had it at a couple different places and they were both extremely fishy and had lots of offal like random parts in it. Don't get me wrong, I love my blood cake and intestine on occasion. But there's a line to be drawn when an intestine tastes like an intestine. Moving forward before I spoil your appetite... Nemz BBH is nothing like this! It's heavy on the lemongrass, slightly spicy, and a relatively clear broth. I recall beef and Viet meatloaf. 

Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef): The beef is amazing. Tender and flavorful. Just as it should be. The tomato rice is a little flavorless. It's rice. Served with a side salad. Get this. Definitely one of the richer things on the menu if you're not feeling noodles or soup.

5172917,2015-01-05,36,YH_3Z_-sFoWeG8QiuO1-oA,"Nem Nuong is their specialty.  That's why you should do yourselves a favor and order the Nem Nuong Cuon.  It is a little more $$ than Brodard's in California but which is cheaper:  Flying/driving down west to LA or slapping down an extra buck for nearly the same rolls?  A member of the family that owns Brodard's runs the operation and with at least two visits there, I noted:

1) Nem Nuong rolls ($4.95)* are similar to Brodard's but with more crunch and thinner slices of Nem Nuong.  The sauce is about the same to me, regardless of what others say.  They make these rolls when you order them so the rice paper wrapper is still freshly soft and not hard and dried out.  Overall, their best item is their signature item.  The other roll contains shrimp paste (chao tom) and also okay but not as good.

2) Combo rice plate with Thit Nuong (grilled pork) - not recommended.   That day the meat came out way salty and I notified them right away.  They did offer to take care of it so that is always a welcome customer service gesture.  For some reason, I didn't take a photo of that rice dish that day.  hmmmm

3) Banh Canh Tom Cua - a Vietnamese udon noodle soup with crab and shrimp.  I recommend this soup.  The broth is rich and delicious.  Noodles come soft and the toppings are sufficient for a wholesome bowl of hot goodness.

4) Banh Khot - I forgot that I hated Brodard's Banh Khot when I ordered this one.  The walls of each mini ""pancake"" were still too thick causing the batter not to be crispy as it potentially could be.  The lack of other toppings with the shrimp detracts also.  Not recommended.

Conclusion:  Despite the mishaps with the rice plate and banh khot, if you stick with the Banh Canh Tom Cua and the Nem Nuong rolls and you should be golden.

Nem Nuong Cuon:
Sausage and veggie spring rolls. They have some crunchy bits in them. Probably the best version I've had in town. They named the place after this dish - they better be good! 4.5/5

Chao Tom Cuon:
Shrimp/ shrimp paste with veggie spring rolls. These also come with crunchy bits. I get tired of eating these, to be quite honest. So, I go back to eating Nem Nuong as a chaser. 3/5

Rare beef and flank soup with vermicelli. Fantastic broth. The portion is just right. The noodles aren't stuck together not chewy - even when you get it to-go. 4/5

Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:
Grilled pork, egg rolls, and veggie vermicelli bowl. The grilled pork is so tasty and not burnt. I love the egg rolls - the meat is well-seasoned. Again, the noodles are great. 5/5

My friend and I decided to share an order of their nem nuong cuon ($4.95) and a com tam bi cha suon nuong ($11.95), which is a rice plate with shredded pork, egg, pork chop, shrimp, and deep fried shrimp cake. For a lack of a better word, it was a little on the bland side.

As for the rice plate, the deep fried shrimp cake was done very well. However, the pork chop was very bland. The flavors from this plate, all together, was very underwhelming.

The pork sausage with crispy fried egg roll shell inside makes these rolls stand out from the typical shrimp spring rolls.

I could probably eat two orders of these as a meal even!  Onto to the rest of the menu, I also ordered #37 which has grilled pork/shrimp, fried shrimp cake, shredded pork skin, and egg cake.  The price seemed a little more expensive than other Vietnamese restaurants, but the portion was huge and I couldn't even finish half of it.  In addition, they serve the rice dish with a bowl of broth with a quail egg inside.  If this is similar to the broth they use for the pho, then it definitely has a clean taste to the palate and I ended up drinking the whole bowl.  Normally, I don't drink the broth served with the rice dishes since it often seems very bland.  The service was also stellar, we were brought our food quickly and they refilled our waters several times without us having to flag someone down.

Also, chicken lovers....they don't have grilled chicken as an option for vermicelli bowls or rice plates.  Most likely I will make this my summer Vietnamese spot and order copious amounts of nem nuong cuon at my next visit!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,4,3,4,DKOJInaBN34YGuOF36_ZZQ

Tonight I ordered the Dry egg noodle with soup in the side. It tastes just like San Gabriel Valley! Very authentic. The flavor was perfect sweet and savory. 

My husband ordered the banh canh which is a flour noodle soup, and enjoyed it as well.

Halfway through our dinner, there was a strong sewer stench. Very off putting. But I guess you have to get used to that at Asian restaurants. We continued unphased. 

On this night there were no desserts on display in their fridge. I usually like to end my meal with  che ba may, which means 3 colored dessert. Its a mixture of red bean, mung bean, and green jelly with coconut milk. Its very tasty! Try it if you haven't before!",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,1,2,4,qU6oPQiB_F49FsfFhVUejA
5620477,2016-01-12,6,YH_3Z_-sFoWeG8QiuO1-oA,"Well, I am officially a fan of Vietnamese food after my second visit to Nem Nuong Bistro.  I can take or leave pho, honestly, and that was really my only experience with Viet food, but here, you don't even have to order that soup to appreciate the cuisine.
On my first visit, I dined solo and had the pork spring rolls, definitely a must (Item #1 on the menu), followed by the Shaking Beef (Item #37).
After having both of these delicious dishes, I was hooked.
I dined here again last week for lunch with a gal pal and we had the pork spring rolls to start, of course.  For my entree, I chose Item #27 with grilled shrimp, grilled shrimp paste, grilled beef over vermicelli: so fresh and tasty!  We also shared the Luna Rice Cakes (#7) with steamed shrimp and Asian greens, another light and fresh item.
The thing about the food here is that you feel like you're eating healthy because nothing is heavy on sauces or greasy.  There are vegetables in everything we've ordered so it's a great mix of protein and greens.  If you've never been, I highly recommend a visit soon.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, and maybe even their pho.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,6,5,m3ZJ6If2SyKeREpDb_WvRw

The luna rice cake was different then I thought. It was a fried batter boat atop with shrimp.

We wanted to have a light lunch and decided on their special salad rolls - 2 of the shrimp paste and 2 of the grilled pork but wrapped up in delicious crunchy goodness of rice paper and fresh, fresh, fresh greens.  Oh and the dip is out of this world!  Very different from any Vietnamese restaurant I've ever eaten in.

The other 2 appetizers we ordered were the Luna Rice Cakes and the Banh Xeo - both were hands-on and came with green romaine lettuce leaves and other greens to make up your lettuce wrap using the cooked items.  Dip the lettuce wrap with fish sauce.  The cooked items were very interesting.  The Luna Rice Cakes came in little crispy rice cups filled with shrimp, mung bean and scallions.  The Banh Xeo looks like an omelette, flavored with coconut milk and filled with shrimp, sliced pork, onion and mung beans.

Very good service!

I had #16 Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio...man, the Egg-rolls were nice and crispy and the noodles was a fair portion. The sauce, however...umm...wasn't so bad, kinda too sweet for my taste, but overall , best bowl I had in Vegas and I've been here 11+ years. 

My Wife had Pho Ga and she enjoyed it (super picky eater, if I may add). 
How it was brought out was really different...the chicken is served on a plate. 

Perhaps if you want to dip it in other sauce ?

Ohhh what I love is the Logan drink!! Most restaurant do not serve this! Haha and I'm a huge sucker for it. Ordered 2 ! 

The place is clean, staffs are friendly & more professional than most Vietnamese restaurant I've gone to here in Vegas. 
Food came out pretty quick for us.

Which is not enough cause these rolls are absolutely addicting. I've tried other soup dishes, rice dishes, and noodle dishes that were okay. Nothing really stands out as extraordinary or amazingly delicious. 

The restaurant is huge and it seems like they may be understaffed at some times.

The egg roll crunch is there, the sauce is on point, and the nem is mighty juicy. The only complaint about it would be that it was slightly on the thin side. No shade though, would definitely go there again if the craving hit. The place seems very popular as most of the items were sold out by Sunday afternoon of EDC weekend. Service was sub par probably due to EDC morning rush; had to go to counter to ask them to refill waters and pay bill. Pleasantly surprised that they took 10% off our bill without me saying anything about the service. Definitely shows what they think of their customers!

First of all, the service was super slow even though the restaurant was mostly quiet. It took forever to be able to get something and for our food to come out.

The food was just okay at best. I shared a bowl of pho, which was $9.95, with a friend and the bowl was small. The broth didn't have good flavor and they were really stingy on the noodle. I expected more for the most expensive bowl of pho I have ever ordered.

Their namesake dish, nem nuoung, was decent but nothing special. They use the crispy flakes inside like Brodard and the meatballs itself has good flavors. This place really doesn't compare to Brodard though. The sauce was a little bit too sweet.

Sadly, the highlight of my meal was the iced soy milk I ordered. I would recommend skipping this place if you're in Vegas.",9lXgNWJQbGO6Qpj_ZCBnkg,5,1,2,ggUfNdCoYIKReIb696EVwQ
