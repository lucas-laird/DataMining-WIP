6214,2013-02-18,0,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,This place has the worst chinese food I've ever eaten. I have been to quite a few chinese restaurants and have chinese friends who often let me sample their food. This food does not even begin to compare. The flavors were all over the place. Its a nice place with nice service but when it comes down to it I think the food plays a big part in the review of a restuarant.,7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,2,0,2,rPN6v1sNLgoLq7sJXZMvUA

35589,2012-12-20,0,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"Bobo China was just what I needed to fulfill my chinese take-out craving.  It is tucked away in the Smart and Final parking lot at Sahara and Durango.  I usually call ahead and pick up.  I wouldn't recommend dining in as there are only a few tables and the ambiance is nothing to write home about.  The food, however, is everything I wanted.  I ordered the pork lo mein and the mongolian beef.  The lo mein was tasty and had a decent amount of pork in it.  The mongolian beef was good but had a lot of onions.  Definitely don't order if you don't care for them.  The portions were generous so I'll definitely be having left overs.  The girl at the front is great, always making sure everything is just right.  This place is a hidden gem perfect when you're craving some Chinese take-out....4 stars.",wl3BnGZs0KnOts4M5YLBjw,2,1,4,KMSQsPqDgYuc5OH3ePMsVA

93300,2017-02-21,0,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"I was a first time customer, went on the recommendation of friends.  Ordered the General Zao's Chicken as a lunch special.  First, it was a lot of food for one person. The soup was a yummy egg drop soup, exactly as you would expect. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the level of spice was lighter than I expected. But not to worry, the owner's wife (who was also my server) brought me some fresh made dried chilies in oil. The fried rice was not oily (which can easily happen). She also gave me a side lo mein, it was perfectly cooked and slightly sweet. The sweet was something I didn't expect but fit the dish well. I figure if a restaurant can do a good job making a twice fried entree and it comes out crispy and the chicken is not over cooked, they can make anything.  I'll definitely be back.",gYauBXTFvIqR881KFGULaA,0,0,5,p49dPaP_fhh19QZenERW5g

We are new to this side of town, and tonight we were at our new house painting - none of our dishes are here yet so we figured why not get Chinese? So we ordered from Bobo - Mongolian beef with fried rice, 2 egg rolls and a wonton soup. 
It came in about 40 minutes (a little slow, but the delivery guy was nice). When I opened the package up I was disappointed to find no spoon - I have no dishes so I can't eat my wonton soup. However, after looking at it, I didnt want to eat it anyway...it was super oily and had some kind of gross bright purple mystery meat in it (pork? Chicken? Something more sinister? Honestly I couldn't tell). My boyfriends Mongolian beef was okay, although not at all spicy like I had ordered. Fried rice was greasy and bland at best.

They say the general tso chicken is spicy, but if ordered right off menu the way it is, I think anyone could eat it because it wasn't spicy to me. They can also make it spicier if you prefer. The Mongolian beef was well seasoned and if you are used to this dish being spicy and like it that way, ask to order it with some spice because just off the menu there is no spice at all, but it is still excellent.

As we entered, it is a small restaurant with about 8 tables. There was dark tint on their windows. The nice waitress welcomed us inside. 
They have lunch specials from 11 am to 3 pm which include an egg drop soup with a main entree, Lo mein, and your choice of rice. Not bad. We all had cold waters to drink. 

I ordered the Mongolian beef with fried rice and came with noodles. The noodles were really good. Soft and flavored with soy sauce. I was a little disappointed in the Mongolian beef. It was good but they gave me more onions than meat. A little stingy on the meat. The fried rice was good. The best Chinese food I have tasted so far here. 

Service was great by our waitress. She was telling us it is a family owned business. She was talking to my daughter and made her feel better. Waitress  gave my daughter an egg drop soup on the house because she wasn't feeling good. She even massaged my daughter's head. Wow! Super nice!

The food is great and it's one of the best values around for lunch or dinner. You'll never leave hungry. It's the type of place where you find yourself ordering your favorite dish each time you come back. We also love the egg drop soup which she always adds her magic ingredients to at the table which take it to the next level (chili oil & white pepper). 

This place is tiny with only a few tables but somehow we've never had to wait and we love grabbing takeout on extra busy days and the food is just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. Your dishes will come with all sorts of extras like egg rolls, cream cheese rangoons & fried shrimp. I love dipping them in the sweet & sour sauce or hot mustard! Everything we've tried here has been really great!

I also want to point out that Shelly pays attention to your habits & if you don't eat something she'll say I can make you that without the water chestnuts. She'll customize dishes to your liking & you'll stop wasting food :)

Best option is the lemon chicken- it's like the chinese food version of junk food, but the version here has two gigantic servings of chicken and is practically swimming in a generous amount of the perfectly sweet lemon sauce. Mad cheap with a side of rice for like $8.

If you're going the healthy route, the shrimp and vegetable stir fry with brown rice is also a good option- lots of snap peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery in a flavorful sauce with several shrimp. Combo also comes with an eggroll, rangoon, and a fried shrimp, also for $8.

My husband and I visited Bobo's New Years Eve. Not wanting to fight the Las Vegas crowds we elected to pick up dinner and bring in the new year with sparkling cider, noise makers and a big sloppy kiss @ midnight. Though we had never heard of Bobo's. And it didn't really sound Chinese to us. We decided we had little to lose. So we trusted our faithful GPS system and headed to the closest Chinese restaurant to our location. Let me tell you we were not disappointed. The customer service was wonderful. And both my vegetarian meal and my husbands Lo Mein w/ chicken & vegetables and his chicken wings were on point. Very seldom have I found a place that is able to satisfy my Chinese itch. It was so good the first time, I had to go back a few days later to find out if my taste buds were dreaming. AND GUESS WHAT? They weren't. Even the second visit was beyond satisfying. And when I heated up my left overs for lunch the following day. The vegetables, rice and tofu were not mushy or oily the way some dishes get from reheating them. I recommend not only this restaurant for the quality time and energy they put into their food. But also for the care and concern for their guests. I would have given them 5 stars however I was unable to have a spring roll because they fry them in same oil as meat products. :(  so I was left wanting. But do let that deter you from and excellent meal.

I really had a great foodie experience. I was glad I capped the end of the year off with Bobo's. I have already recommended the restaurant to family. And IM recommending it to you.

Everything was FULL of flavor!  Probably my favorite fried rice from a takeout place EVER!  My mom ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and ate the entire thing (to her surprise!) cause it was that good!

You're greeted with a smile and sassy attitude. I absolutely love her. Her husband is behind the kitchen deliciousness. 
If you come in and order to go, or stay and eat, you will always be welcomed with a small bowl of egg drop soup... come on who doesn't want some delicious egg drop soup?! If you need a recommendation just ask and she will guide you- just have to pick you're ""protein"" (chicken, pork, beef). 
The dumplings are a must. I love the volcanic shrimp- it's a different kind of crispy. It's not tempura but it's not a heavy deep fry. Well I think it's deep fried, it is, but it's not a regular kind of deep fry. Today my mom and I went in and we had this garlicy sauce dish- oh my goodness, perfection.

2641268,2015-12-08,52,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"I love discovering small businesses like this one! It's a total hole in the wall, but offers extremely affordable lunch specials from 11-3pm. They also offer a cheap $7 all day pricing menu! You won't find anything over $10 here! This place is a neighborhood staple when we're looking for fast and satisfying Chinese food. 

Lunch specials range from $5-$6, they come with your entree, complimentary soup (dine-in only), half low mein and half simple egg fried rice. We always receive hospitable service from the owner Shelly, she's very sweet and quirky. She treats you like a regular right from the start. If you order takeout and arrive before the food is ready, she'll bring out fried wontons and soup for you to enjoy while you wait. She also offers these treats as complimentary appetizers when you dine in.

Here's what I've tried:
*Walnut shrimp $8.95 - the classic Chinese/American guilty pleasure. They use really plump and juicy shrimp here which never taste frozen. It's cooked to crisp perfection and the flavor is always delicious! 5/5

*Combination/ House fried rice $6.50 - it comes with tender chicken, plump shrimp, fluffy egg and vegetables. It's moist, flavorful and pairs perfectly with most of the items on the menu! 4/5

*Egg flower soup $4.95 - Hot and comforting! The right consistency and also lots of silky egg ribbons throughout! 5/5

*Crab Rangoon $4.50 (6 pieces) - Classic and tasty. Fried just right and filled with lots of creamy and flavorful cream cheese filling. 4/5

*House special chicken ($4.95 lunch special) - lightly breaded chicken, fried to golden brown and then topped with their house special garlic sauce. It reminds me of a fusion Chinese/Hawaiian katsu. It gets soggy quick though so maybe not my first choice. 3/5

We like this place and always recommend it to friends looking for a cheap fix! Portions aren't massive but it's usually enough to share between 2 - the quality & flavor really make up for it!

This seems to be a small family restaurant and everyone seems to know each other. Everyone talks to each other. Fun and engaging.

I did noticed a lot of orders over the phone. They were very busy with all the phone orders. 

We decided to try the pork wontons, Mongolian beef, sizzling rice with shrimp, low main with chicken and vegetables. They give you complementary egg drop soup and it's delicious. I liked everything I had, except for the sizzling rice. It was ok, I'm was not crazy about. It might just be me but not my favorite. However; everything else we had it was great.

I'm a big beef with broccoli fan but I'm eager to try some of the spicier options too.

Also, the lady who owns the place is hilarious, she's very talkative and sassy, remembers what you order and adds/removes ingredients based on your preferences.  For examples, with my B&B I like more bamboo shoots and less water chestnuts and she took care of it without even asking me (she noticed the first time I had it, talk about attention to detail).  The egg flower soup is terrific too and she'll make giant bowls of it for only $5.  All the locals seem to know this place well and are friends with the owner, and often while you eat there they'll be striking up conversations with her.

I loved the water chestnuts and the bamboo pieces in the dish! My boyfriend always orders either orange chicken or general tso's chicken at Chinese take out restaurants and he says that this is the one here is the absolute best he's ever had. The chicken they use is only white meat and the outside is very crispy. You know how you normally feel really weighed down and heavy after eating Chinese take out? You won't get that feeling here because the food and ingredients used are such high quality and prepared very well. 

SERVICE 5/5: Our combo also came with the egg drop soup and if this hasn't been reiterated in the reviews enough already, it was amazing! The woman who took our order (owner?) was super helpful and recommended we add chili oil and white pepper to the soup which took it next level. She also asked if we liked hot mustard and brought some out for us to try with the fried items (egg roll/crab rangoon/fried shrimp) in our combo. She customized the hot mustard for us by adding chili oil to this as well along with soy sauce which was MONEY. Our complimentary water cups were always refilled without needing to ask. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I've always left other Chinese take out restaurants feeling like my Chinese food craving was satisfied but never felt that it was amazing - similar to how you feel when you just need your junk food fix.

The food is not bad, but in Las Vegas that's not good enough. Yea, it close by and they deliver, so there is the whole convenience thing, but you would better served by driving a few miles to Chinatown, where you WILL get good Chinese. 

Good Chinese is just one of those things that can never be compromised.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,2,0,2,0D7PmBT15kXGPvRa6KkCTA
3601988,2016-01-30,4,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"I adore this place, and most especially I adore the matron owner who I lovingly refer to as Madam Mao. I am continually disappointed with the Chinese food in Las Vegas. Vegas has some great Asian food, but for some reason Chinese food is often little better than fast food quality, or chain style Americanized Chinese. Sadly, after visiting China a couple of times I have become a Chinese food snob. 

Welp, Bobo satisfies my Northern Chinese food needs. The quality of the food is fresh and well made. The meals have a a good, strong, Chinese flavor. The meats are not over cooked and the veggies remain crisp. The sauces are succulent and not full of sugar which is so often he case in American Chinese food. For the food alone it is worth the trip across town. Couple this with the fact the proprietor hasn't raised prices in more than 6 years. You can get in an out with a huge delicious meal for two people for less than $25. 

There is a down side. The dining room is tiny. Just four tables. Most of their business is takeout. They do a brisk take out business so you have to be wiling to wait for your main dishes as they only have one cook and one server. 

Speaking of the service, the proprietor is a bit of an acquired taste. Some might view her as abrupt with little tolerance for indecisive customers, but I adore her. She can cast a disappointing gaze in your direction if she is not happy with you. However, she is also very kind and rewarding if you are a good guest. She has an excellent memory for good guest which has helped her create a very loyal customer base. Half the reason I enjoy eating there is because of my totally inappropriate crush on Madam Mao and loving sternness. 

if you are craving Chinese it is worth a trip to check out. You might not get a seat right away, and you might get dirty looks from Madam Mao if you decide to wait instead of just ordering the food to go, but the food and for show are the best you are going to get for the price.",6EdfElu9BdsecacShHIpTQ,4,2,5,0HzCPv2075hhARUlCShgLQ
3617044,2015-05-27,0,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"Just picked up a little Mongolian beef and Lo Mein dinner special (not on dinner menu but paying a little extra will get you special order). I just want to say that this totally hit the spot. Just ridiculous. The beef is super tender and full of flavor. I knew I had a craving for a reason. Thank you so much!!

Also, I want to note that this is my ""Go-To"" spot for a quick and delicious meal. The owners offer a $4.95 lunch special that includes an entrée, a side (fried rice) and an egg drop soup (dine-in only), I believe. The all day $6.95 special offers an entrée, a side (fried rice and lo mein combo I believe), one spring roll, one fried shrimp, cream cheese rangoon, a baggies of fried wontons and a soup (dine-in only). It is a massive amount of tasty food for a low price. I come here quite often and have gotten to know the owner very well, she is my favorite person Ever and for a buck or so more, she will customize my all day special with lo mein instead of rice and two spring rolls instead of all the other fried stuff. 

I love supporting this business and while it is not a fancy or a big place by any means, I feel more welcomed and appreciated here than at any other food joint I've ever been to in Vegas (and I've eaten this entire city many-a times over). I'm always engaged in a conversation and humor, which is definitely not a normal occurrence in Asian or ethnic food joint.

3971409,2012-01-04,1,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"I'm really conflicted about this place.  The food was good, but not that much better than any other take out in my general area.  We ate in which also colors my review.

The first thing that struck me when we went in was how messy every table was.  At that point, I asked my wife if she wanted to do take out instead, but she said we'd wait.  A gentleman who just finished his complimentary egg drop soup while he was waiting for his takeout, got up from his table and offered it to us.  It was at this time that the woman showed up.  She cleaned off the table and we were seated by the door.

From then, it was a bit of a wait for her to cover the few tables in the place, answer the phone, and give take out orders to people as they came in.  After a fair amount of time--nothing outrageous--she came to take our order.  My wife wanted the garlic chicken.  I wanted the pork with garlic sauce which was listed on the menu as hot and spicy.  She questioned each of us on what type of vegetables we liked.  I didn't understand this, but when I ordered, I guess she assumed we would be sharing and since my wife already had ordered a garlic dish, I wouldn't want the same.  Again, a discussion of what kind of vegetables I liked.  She then suggested I get one of two other pork dishes.  I ended up ordering the twice cooked pork.  I really didn't come for a discussion on vegetables as well intentioned as that might have been.

We got a complimentary cup of egg drop soup which was good.  My wife liked her chicken with garlic sauce and I liked my twice cooked pork, but it wasn't spicy.  And, during the meal, I couldn't help look at the table ahead and to my left where every dirty dish from every other table ended up for a temporary home, but they stayed there during the hour plus we were in the restaurant.  I realize it's a mom and pop operation but when there are only 4 tables, it becomes an issue.

I liked the woman.  She was quite friendly and had a good sense of humor.  If I come back, it will be for takeout only and I'll call in advance.  I think I've sworn off Chinese food in the neighborhood.  I'll stick to Thai food and get Chinese in Chinatown.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,1,3,p0LEvu718S6wmoeEckO8GQ

My co-workers don't have the greatest taste in food and I was walking in blind (hadn't checked the Yelp). It looks a bit sketchy from the outside, but usually the hole in the walls are decent. So in I walked while quickly scanning reviews.

It's located on Sahara in the Smart & Final shopping center a couple businesses down from the Biscuits Café. 

One of my co-workers has been frequenting this joint for 6 years is what I've been told. So the nice lady did not bother to give her a menu because she was getting the usual. I quickly scanned until I found the lunch specials. Lunch specials include your entrée choice, soup, low mein and fried or steamed rice. I decided to go with the Cashew nuts chicken and steamed rice. She provided us with a Styrofoam cup of arrowhead water that she kept cold and full the entire time. I wasn't totally keeping track, but the soup came first only about 2-5 minutes after taking our order and the food followed maybe 5-10 minutes after the soup. Food was extremely hot and totally delicious. I actually had to let it cool off before I stuffed my face. The one thing that stuck out the most for me was the chicken. It wasn't chewy and rubbery like I normally find while eating Chinese food. There was plenty of food in each portion, so much that I couldn't finish mine completely.

Not hard to do since there are exactly 5 tables to choose from and 1 was taken.  I continued to be skeptical.  The prices were better than reasonable.  They were quite low.

I order the cashew chicken combination, my husband ordered the broccoli beef and our son ordered the chicken lo mein.  We had water to drink.  Water was served from an Arrowhead gallon jug.  Still skeptical...

As we waited for our meal numerous people came and went.  I then realized this was a popular local take out place.  The tables were only there for the few of us who aren't there for take out. I started counting.  4 people dropped in before we got our meal.  Another 6 came while we ate and 2 more while we visited after dinner.  This is a local hot spot for take out and let me explain why.

For 6.99 each we ordered combination plates. With our meal came our entree, fried or steamed rice, 1 egg roll, 1 crab/cream cheese stuffed won ton. 1 fried shrimp and soup.

All our meals arrived hot and one at a time.  These dishes are cooked to order fast and fresh.  The chicken and beef were super tender and sliced thin so sauce was coated on each perfectly,  the flavors were amazing and the texture of the ingredients were so fresh.  The chicken cashew had lots of cashews, water chestnuts, onions, peppers and carrots.  It was so good.  The broccoli beef had water chestnuts, onions, bamboo shoots...

I live walking distance to this restaurant as it's next to my local Smith's grocery store. The woman on the phone was very rude and tried to argue her Mapquest location that I was a mile away. I definitely am not as I walk about five blocks and cross the street to get there. After her rudeness, I was put off and didn't feel comfortable receiving any food from them and couldn't believe there wasn't a care in the world to being polite or trying to attempt great customer service given that I am a repeat customer who has ordered from them several times before. This woman wanted to argue with me. I called back and cancelled my order. She didn't seem to care. I got a ""OK I will cancel, bye"".

5127033,2010-12-29,3,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"I owe it to Yelp for helping me find this place. I've been to the Smart and Final and Del Taco a gazillion times, but I never noticed the Bobo China in the same shopping center. Even If I had noticed it, I'm not sure I would have tried it. I am absolutely in love with this place. The lady who always helps me is very nice and pretty sarcastic which is pretty much how I am. 

    I order from here at least once a week. I get pickup and delivery and I'm always pleased either way. If I had to be critical I think one time it wasn't really as hot as it could have been. But that's out of like 20 times ordering so far. Another big note is that delivery is free. That's rare! Obviously you still need to take care of the driver but hopefully that doesn't need to be said. 

    I first had the Egg Drop soup when I was waiting for a pickup order. The lady behind the counter brought it over which was so nice! That little gesture was appreciated. It was delicious. One of the best Egg Drop soups I have had yet. It probably helps that I'm a little plain and there isn't any crazy other ingredients. Since that day I have ordered it several times. It comes in a pretty good sized container. You can definitely share it with at least one other person if not two. They even give you this spicy chili sauce to add to it if you like it spicy. It adds a great spicy kick to an already delicious flavor.

    I also am a fan of their wings. I don't get wings often at chinese restaurants but I have here once or twice. I love the way its breaded.

    Their potstickers and dumplings are delicious as well. I'm not sure the difference between the two here. They were very similar. Maybe just the way they were cooked. 

    I also love their Kung Pao Chicken. It's pretty much what I always order, though I'm tempted to try more things soon.

    And to top it all off the prices are so reasonable. It's the ideal little hole in the wall Chinese takeout spot. Clean, cheap, friendly, and the food is delicious. A big thank you to Yelp for helping me find this place.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,7,4,5,zdtPJM0z6CdpfWIrtR3bYQ

On the first round, I thought it was just ok, but I wanted to give it another go. Second time, I think having an Asian brother with me assisted in the flavor department! It's a strong call for quick, semi-Americanized Chinese eats. The menu isn't huge, but more than likely, they can make things you may not see on the menu. 

The owner is a hoot, and she took a great interest in the husband's nationality. Based on his Taiwanese roots, she made suggestions and even offered up some off menu items. I think the key is talking to her and describing your dream dish. More than likely, they can make it! Heck, she even offered to make brown rice if we called an hour ahead of time to let her know we were coming.

We had the Kung Pao and Szechuan chicken. Both were fresh and flavorful. Everything is also cheap. The all day $6.99 special comes with egg drop soup, egg roll, fried shrimp and crab rangoon, but I may just stick with the dinner orders in the future.

The place seems to be run by a family - the waitress said her husband is one of the cooks. It seems that they care about their food and their customers. It was my first real meal in Las Vegas after a long day at a work conference, so I was glad to enjoy the food as well as the experience.

So in this city I can't compare locations because I am from Los Angeles but I do know great food when I taste it and this place put its mark on my list of go try. So I was here on vacation and I of course I search for a good lunch spot and this one came up. When we arrived it was the day after Thanksgiving so it was empty with just two customers during our meal. The lady that served us was amazing very friendly, informative, and just all around hospitable. She served us an egg soup that my wife loved but my son and I were not into because of the texture.  We started with the pot stickers that the nice lady mentioned she makes fresh daily and they do run out occasionally which is cool to know. We then had orange chicken, egg rolls, lo Mein, and Mongolian beef which were all amazing.

It's a small place with maybe 4-5 tables, kind of dark and our server was the owner. She was so kind and funny and told us how her husband has been cooking for 40yrs.

Beef with Broccoli - Lots of beef!  Then again I prefer more vegetables than beef in my Beef with Broccoli dish.  

House Special Chicken - This tastes like a chicken breast with tempera batter and a sweet orange garlic glaze.  Daughter ate most of it.  

Next time I'll have to try the cashew chicken!

5776837,2016-03-24,1,H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag,"This is hands-down my all-time favorite Chinese food restaurant in Las Vegas.  The food is always delicious.  My boyfriend and I have been several times, and although I live on the other side of town, the food is definitely worth the drive.

The restaurant itself is squeezed in a small strip center by a Smart & Final and Smiths, the dining room is tiny, only 4 tables, but the restaurant does a steady carry out business.  Shelley (the owner) and her husband (whose name I don't know) single handedly run the place.

Shelley is amazing.  She knew my boyfriend and I on our second visit (even though it was over a month since our first visit) and now we are greeted like old friends.  She knows what we like to order  (I order the same thing every time, and my boyfriend likes to experiment with the menu).  We are hardly the exception.  She greets almost everyone who calls and comes with familiarity and knows what people want before they order it.  It's astounding.

As previously mentioned, I usually order the Lemon Chicken -- it is tangy and juicy -- while my boyfriend orders random things on the menu.  Most recently, he had the twice cooked pork which was divine.  

The prices are more than reasonable -- making this some of the the best priced, and best tasting food in Las Vegas.

I think the owner is a little sweet on my boyfriend, (and I know he harbors an inappropriate crush on her), but that does not change my enthusiastic 5 star review!

Anyway, I ordered one of their all day specials and it was done within a few short minutes.  The shrimp tasted fresh, everything was piping hot (yeah burnt my tongue getting a preview before I drove home). I felt that there was a lot more ""sauce"" than the rest of the food,otherwise it was tasty.

It is a nice little neighborhood Chinese take-out spot for those in the SW (Sahara and Durango).  They will deliver within 2 miles.

I think the restaurant is run by a Chinese couple.  The wife mans the front,while the husband cooks in the kitchen.  Definitely worth supporting this kind of small business that provides good food and good value.

After she took my order she asked me to sit down and brought me a bowl of hot soup while I waited for my order. 
My order was promptly made and while I was waiting she found out that I was from Taiwan. Before I left she gave me some dried Chinese herb so I can make some hot tea because she thought it's not good for my health to drink cold Thai iced tea on a very cold day.
