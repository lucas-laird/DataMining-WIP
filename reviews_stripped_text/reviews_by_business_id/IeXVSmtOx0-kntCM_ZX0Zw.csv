The chef is friendly and any dietary restrictions can be accommodated without sacrificing flavor. They also do meal prep. Healthy and convenient... if you can find it.

The location inside the CSN food court means you're unlikely to stumble in without knowing about it, and for whatever reason they don't have any posted hours so I've found them closed more often than not. The salad and wrap I got were both good, but it was a customized order out of necessity when three things I tried to order couldn't be made because ingredients were out of stock in the kitchen. A little advertising and a bit more attention and this place could be even better.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,14,3,ZNZiNuHf2PBB3wyvlG1W3Q
