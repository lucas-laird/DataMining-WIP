Do not come here if you have capnophobia!

Do come here if you want to smoke in an airport. No food, just booze and a place to light up. Every airport should have one of these f@ckers. Lot's of smoke. Party like a rock star, smell like an ashtray. No cigars allowed, which sucks, since they sell them 50' away.",ONqYv2Re2sLPdspqjsHfsg,2,3,3,VGMsBTuz5BB0eUtCqd8GBA
