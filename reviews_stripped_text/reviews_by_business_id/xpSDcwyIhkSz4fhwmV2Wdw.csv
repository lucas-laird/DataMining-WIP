2203344,2017-01-21,0,xpSDcwyIhkSz4fhwmV2Wdw,"This little Taqueria is amazingly good! The owner Alboro has a passion for excellence. Everything that comes out of the kitchen, made by one of his 3 beautiful cooks, is looked over by him and does not hit your table unless its perfect. I fully recommend paying the dollar to get into the Fantastik Swap meet just to get into this place for food. If your already going to the swap meet check out Tia's you won't be disappointed its quality Mex grub for sure. 

The Mexican Corn is probably the most popular dish.",9zH4TJW2Wl2SuLf90xSeeQ,0,0,5,f1_lOZylihaz3_S3iWtAfA

3263449,2018-04-21,0,xpSDcwyIhkSz4fhwmV2Wdw,"Honestly some of the best Mexican food I've had... even better than some places in Mexico! 

For $6.99 I ordered the 2 fish tacos, beans & rice combo.The best fish tacos I've had. The batter was thick & crispy, it wrapped around the fish & matched the soft fish texture perfectly and wasn't greasy or flaky... paired very well with the flavorful refried beans and fluffy spanish rice.

For $5 the pollo sopa has a whole chicken thigh, marinated carrots, (cucumbers or zucchini, couldn't tell) and cabbage. The broth was light, full of flavor & however, not heavily salted...just a perfect blend. 

For $2 you have your small drink choice of homemade cantelope, pineapple and the BEST HORCHATA I've ever drank. Seriously, I've had some over cinnamon-ed, over milky horchata and the flavors in this blend are just perfect!  

I think perfect seems to be the key word to describe this place. Whoever's Tia is cooking, MUCHAS GRACIAS!!!",IokB1_OkvPxCCL2n3pybTw,1,1,5,2YGcAYj4JirM9yp-t2R-Jg

My son and I were looking forward to it since where we live we don't get the ""corn man"". next time we'll try something else I'm sure everything else tastes great.",KbSnmZHZ1wo-3MYMlFYHJQ,0,0,3,9Ln6PBsm-r95d97lt-pAXA
3555360,2018-04-23,0,xpSDcwyIhkSz4fhwmV2Wdw,"I was checking out Fantastic Swap Meet and came acrossÂ Tia's Cafe. I decided to try it. They have authentic Mexican cuisine. From what I learned, their food are made-from-scratch. They have Burritos, Nachos, Tostados, Quesadillas, Chicken Wings and more. 

I tried their Chicken Wings, and also tried their Churros for dessert and Mexican corn.

They are located at the corner of Oakey Blvd and Decatur Blvd inside the Swap Meet.

Oh, don't forget to try their specialty drinks Horchata.

You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. There are several small seatings. The service was fast and on par.

This is a great find and a hidden gem and I want to try the other items on the menu. The menu are not overwhelming and the prices are reasonable.

You pay the $1 to get in to the Swap Meet and I believe it's in the aisle H and follow the Food sign. They don't have a separate door. Remember they are open only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 9am - 6pm. Maybe that will change in the future.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,4,2,4,vB1SRIMqj4JlDQwfFTnHzg

Went in the swap meet for the first time since we have moved here to check out what it offered (Which was very great stuff by the way). Little did I know.. not even being that hungry, we would find a phenomenal place to eat! This place needs to open its own restaurant immediately!! I had the steak burrito and it was one of the best I had in town. hands down! I'm a foodie who loves to try new eats everywhere. Great service by the man up front. very friendly, efficient and quick. A very reasonable price makes Tia's cafe one of the BEST I've had in Vegas for Mexican food!",L4FNttArO02WeM3TyhipXg,0,0,5,SYEtPK0lrlXXjTSwxr79nw

I really wanted tasty mexican food during my trip and I'm glad that I found this restaurant!

I asked the worker what is their best seller and he said their enchiladas are tasty! I ordered one order that includes 3 enchiladas with green sauce.  Inside has tons of cheese and tender steak. On the side has lettuce, cucumbers, and radish. It complimented well with the cheesy tasty enchiladas!

The enchiladas were very cheesy and delicious that if I lived in the neighborhood then I'd visit each weekend. Also I bought a refreshing strawberry lemonade! 

Check out this restaurant in the indoor swapmeet and you won't be disappointed. :-)",ISfEHOfFjuEXiQXATzG7Hg,0,0,5,ZPJNn-k5G8J9DxP9HZLKrA

A hidden gem at the indoor swap meet! The food is made fresh. One thing you need to try is their torta. 

Torta is delicious & a good size. I had a half and it was more than enough for me. The bread was soft on the inside and crisp on the outside. The meat was flavorful and tender, soooo DELICIOUS. Good amount of sauce as well. And dare I say it... it may be better than some I've had in Cali. (Sorry no photo of torta, I was hungry :-P I will take photos next time, for sure!)

Our group had the sopes, elote, fried chicken & fries, enchiladas and horchata. All were delicious, no complaints. The torta and horchata was my fave from this spot. 

Food & service were amazing, it felt like going over to my Mexican cousins' house for some home cooked meals. 

Looking forward to coming here again next time I'm at the Fantastik Swap Meet.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,8,8,4,Kk9ySowcTPGkQXY9MVqXew
