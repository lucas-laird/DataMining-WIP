Twice I came in. Twice I waited for 15 minutes with not so much as a glance from the bartenders. Twice I got up and left without even seeing a menu. 

I can't believe that they allow this to happen at a place of business. I get you're a ""local"" place, but I'm a local. I live in your area. Why don't I deserve your business?

B-Dubs is on the other end of the parking lot, and their service is a lot better. Shucks is down Durango and their food is great and their service is better. Timbers, which I regard as a pretty low-star experience in the Centennial area, would still get the nod from me over this place for no other reason than they acknowledged my existence.

They also have an enclosed food restaurant to eat your dinner without all the cigarette smoke. But if you want to gamble, you have to be in the bar.

The cigarette smoke is rather intense in the bar area. When I leave this bar, I smell like an ashtray. Not enjoyable at all. Other nearby bars seep to have better ventilation. Also, this bar REEKS when you walk in. Stale and musty, as if the carpets were filthy. This smell goes beyond simple cigarette odor.  Other bars in the area may have a cigarette smell, but do not reek like musty or moldy carpets. 

The bartenders are pretty cool, but sometimes it's difficult to get their attention as they will converse with a favorite client for a long time and not look around at the rest of the bar.

The complaints most people will tell you about this place isn't the food, but the service. I visited this place for the first time yesterday and have no qualms about either.

I didn't stay long, I sat at the bar and drank a Budweiser. They were out of XX which was a bummer. I ordered a small appetizer to ensure I wasn't sloshed for the drive home. I got the pretzel bites with cheese. The cheese was a little too on the olivey side, but the pretzels were delicious and smothered in artery clogging butter. Just the way I like it!

Hey, if you wanted to be healthy, your dumbass wouldn't be at a bar, now would it?

The bartender was very nice. Her name was Tara and she paid plenty attention to me. My food and drink came pretty quick, she stopped by every once in awhile to ensure I was okay, and I didn't have to wait to have my check to be brought to me. She seemed to make her rounds on everyone just the same, so I assume she's not the bartender people have been complaining about. Ans she's super nice to boot!

I went in the afternoon time, so it wasn't too packed, but there were quite a few people there, including obvious regulars. Lots of sports on the TV screens and they even have an entire non-smoking section for people that are afraid to die.

I then asked for a menu and got the chicken wings well done, they came out exactly how I ordered them. Maybe this place has gotten better or changed but I really enjoyed myself and will deffiantly return to the Keg. If Dan is there ask for him, he is amazing and very knowledgable on all the beers and food.",6l787K7GA77hV8Ym8yXlqA,2,1,5,Jv6A-dhwxH_L9azw-0MYYw

Our server gave us the menus which were small on items, but had enough to chose from. The meals were good for a breakfast.Altogether a nice place for a quiet breakfast, the staff were good and friendly.
A nice surprise!",iFotFoBw-op8C0xW8ljqWg,0,0,4,a_jVjyOpYZIOGqDP2V9zsA
5576853,2016-05-08,0,5XORYO9raiXVZSGGPvjSmA,"I have ate at this location several times but today was by far the worst in terms of customer service, food preparation and lack of management ethics.  The food servers at this location if you order to-go, will not give you your change and take it for themselves instead! I have witnessed this myself in person today.  The order I had today two out of the three items were correct however I was assured everything was correct by the server, prior to her stealing my change.  After I got all the way home and opened my mail which was their chicken sandwich with fries come to realize that chicken sandwich was mostly burnt and dry, as well as the bun and I got flipping sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries that I ordered.  Management did offer to comp the meal, although they would not comp me what I actually paid for it, because of their $2 service order, on all to go orders on top of the additional pricing,of they're ala-cart items like bacon and onions, which any other restaurant would include in that type of meal.  I used to really enjoy this location however the quality of staff has dropped off a cliff and the management doesn't seem to truly care about their patrons.",gvC9vVIQbTSPOpXvtiUbUg,1,0,1,zZSygpHcMbcI6092joqFpQ

I love the pretzels bites! I could eat those damn things every time I'm in there. Let's see, the BLT is awesome too. The chicken fingers are pretty tasty. If you order the nachos, be prepared to have an empty stomach or someone else to share your food with. 
Onto the prices: They are exactly where they should be. Not too pricey. 
My favorite two things about this bar..... the lighting (it's dimmed) and the gambling is awesome. I rarely leave this place down. I play Keno mostly. My hubby plays poker. It's one of our favorite places to play. The first time we played Keno at this bar, we left with over 1K in our pockets. It was a good night! Suzie is a really good bartender. Ask her for some Sooz juice. You won't regret it! There is plenty of seating. Lots of tables too. 
If you want to bring your family, there is a smoke free side. 
Last but not least, if you're trying to catch a game on TV, chances are it's on one of their many tv's. They've got plenty of them. There's also a couple pool tables. The bartenders are super laid back. Attentive too. Be sure tip your bartenders and servers!!!!!! They work their asses off. (:",JKPbAYGiLGatUE3yzFQR7g,3,1,5,3_GVqL9koZRgiGMq67xK8g
