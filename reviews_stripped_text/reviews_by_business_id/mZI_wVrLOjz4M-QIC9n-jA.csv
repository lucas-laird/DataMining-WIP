150602,2015-11-23,0,mZI_wVrLOjz4M-QIC9n-jA,"My story begins on Saturday night, November 21 2015. I decided to go out with a friend to your location on Tropicana and Maryland Parkway and the night began like any other. I came in and was carded and then sat at the bar. The bar was very crowded so the service time wasn't good at all. There was only one bartender working which I didn't understand since it was a busy Saturday night, but that's material for a different complaint letter. My friend and I ended up waiting for 20 minutes until we were even able to get a menu and a drink. The bartender was a male, possibly Samoan or Hawaiian, and he had curly hair that was up in a ponytail.  After sitting at the bar for awhile longer he was finally able to take our order. My friend ordered boneless chicken wings and fries, and I got the messy tatter tots and a barbeque chicken pizza. With the food, drinks, and the extremely generous tips that we gave, our totally came to a little over sixty dollars....for two people. My friend and I ate and enjoyed the atmosphere. My friend could barely finish the wings and friends and I ended up eating the whole tatter tot plate and I had a slice of pizza. We were both extremely full, especially since we were drinking beers. I then asked the bartender if he could give me a to go box or something for my pizza since I was full and couldn't eat it, this is where the night turned bad. When I originally ordered the pizza, I asked him if he could give it to me in a to go box and he said no we had to eat it there, I said not a problem and followed directions. Since the pizza was $9 dollars I ended up tipping him another $9 dollars since I got the discount. Once I asked for a to go box the bartender ended up flipping out on me in front of my friend and other bar goers. He said and I quote 
""You're going to have to eat more of that pizza or else I'll have to charge you full price man!"" 
I then replied ""are you serious? Even though I spent all of this money?"" 
He then said ""Yeah man, I have to charge you full price. You've been here before man so you know the drill, you knew what you were doing man, trying to pull a fast one on us. It's a dine-in only deal and I should be charging you to cover my ass from my boss but I guess I'll let it slide"" and he said it in the rudest tone possible, yelling and talking to me like I was a child. It was shocking to me especially since I spend at least $100+ dollars at this location a week and always tip extremely well...yet I can't take a pizza out of the building without catching a case from the bartender? The quality of the pizza wasn't even good either but that's material for another complaint letter as well. I don't see how you guys could charge $18 dollars for that bland pizza let alone give it to people half off with an attitude. Next time I will just go to Albertsons and get beer then go to pizza hut. It'll be cheaper and far less attitude will come with it. Quality of the food was bad, service was terrible, I was talked to like I was a child in the rudest manner possible, and on top of all of that the bartender ultimately ruined my night because I wanted to stay at the bar and drink more but I was so angry about the pizza that we left. I just didn't want my pizza sitting out while we were drinking so I wanted to put it away in a box....but having these wishes came with the consequence of getting talked to like a dog by your bartender. I don't know what needs to change but he shouldn't have gotten attitude with me. Another thing that I acknowledge is that he's under pressure because it's company policy to not let people walk out with pizzas. But if people are paying customers then why won't you let people leave? Especially if they've eaten at least one slice like I did. I bet if I told any Kids hunger program or World hunger program that you tried to force me to eat a pizza or suffer the consequences of having to pay more they would be appalled. The funny part too is that he had already cashed my bill out and I ate for awhile then he threatened to charge me more for leaving with the pizza! It's absolutely ridiculous. You can't force people to do anything after they've paid for the food and are constant paying customers of yours. Next time I'm at a PT's and someone threatens to charge me more $ for not eating I will make it more public then you can imagine. This is ridiculous service and that bartender needs to brush up on his customer service. If his service had been better I would of stayed longer and bought more drinks. Even if he had just said it to me nicely that I couldn't leave with the pizza THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE! But he was so rude and such a douche that I had to write a complaint. If he is seriously losing his mind over a pizza then maybe you guys need to reconsider him as an employee. You guys just lost a good loyal paying customer due to your bartender having a bad day and giving me attitude over A PIZZA. That's totally worth losing my constant business (sarcasm).

Even more disgustingly dirty bathroom, and this was early evening, I can't imagine what this place looks like after it gets busy in the later evening. If the public areas are this dirty I can't imagine what the kitchen might look like. By far the WORST BARTENDER SERVICE EVER,,(or lack thereof) and this is based on at least 5 visits thinking it might get better..... forever to get a drink, if it is the right order it's watered down, then the check is wrong and the bartender gets an attitude about correcting the tab accusing me of trying to cheat him. As I ask if he remembered serving me cosmopolitans (which I hate and never drink yet had 4 on my tab) I remembered he couldn't remember I ordered crown/coke to begin with when I did order it. Oh yeah, and very little comp for playing $80 in, max bet on quarters and only got two drinks comped? Management really needs to overhaul the staff here big time.

1022398,2011-10-07,2,mZI_wVrLOjz4M-QIC9n-jA,"Though I hate the smell of people dying from cigarettes, this bar is my favorite around the university area. Pool tables, sweet jukebox, beer pong tables, and a great staff. Bobby is probably my favorite bartender as of now. 

It is heavy on the smoke inside, but I get past it when hanging out with my friends here. They have amazing food, at least as far as what I have had. Pizza, wings, the chicken caesar salad and club sandwich is my favorite ! 
They may not have a huge variety of beer, they can make pretty much any drink you want. Bobby makes a pretty good AMF. 

Thursday nights are UNLV pride nights as well as karaoke night. Come in wearing any UNLV gear and you get discounts on drinks. Like $2 bud light for me last night! Plus get drunk and sing ridiculous songs all night. I cannot sing Summer Lovin' from Grease sober, that is for sure. 

Then everyday from 4-7pm and 12am-3am is Happy Hour. 

I really love coming here to just sit and have a beer some nights. It is chill and a favorite hole in the wall place in my eyes. If you go there as often as I do, you would want to request a Beer and Bites card. Reward card for food and drinks, as well as needing it for Happy Hour prices. Another rewards card to add to the collection of the one's I already have from every casino in town, no biggy. haha

Ambiance: walking in from a bright sunny afternoon sky, it takes a few seconds to accommodate because it is very dark inside. The room is pretty much divided into three sections. You walk into the bar area. Then there is a relatively small area with tables for the eating. And then there is a third section with 8 pool tables. But overall, it was pretty depressing, in part because it was so dark. And in part because it was so empty ( other than me, there were only three people shooting pool in the entire place). Plus, while I was eating someone came in and while sitting at the bar lit up a cigarette. With no real separation between the bar area and the dining area, the smoke drifted over. Yuck!!
Service: my server was at the table almost immediately after sitting down. She gave me the specials menu and the full menu. She brought my drink almost immediately. And a different person brought out my food. My server came back a couple of times during the meal to make sure that I didn't need anything else. Overall service was good.
Food: I had the barbecue chicken salad. My biggest surprise was that the presentation was excellent (see the photo). And the salad was actually quite tasty. Unfortunately, one third of the plate was chips , which was not mentioned on the menu and I had no interest in. Were I to come back for lunch, I would order it without the chips.
Value: Overall, four-star food and service was dragged down by 1 star ambiance. I would not come back here for lunch.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,0,0,3,S5J7-jNhPVDxtFw0ZfqY3g

I've never really had a bad PT's experience -- but I've never had a great one, either. So let me tell you about my last trip to a PT's, the one one Trop/Maryland in the University neighborhood. 

I came here after the Runnin' Rebels game (Go Rebs!) as it's one of the closest bars to the Thomas and Mack. The place was cool, and there is clearly a lot of school spirit there. Our beers arrived nice and cold, and the $2 Coors deal was pretty good. My Jack and Coke was too weak for my taste, but that may be because I drink a lot. I ordered wings and fries to go along with my beer. The wings were nice and hot (temperature and spiciness) and the fries were good, too. 

The reason I'm giving this place three stars instead of four or five? It's really, REALLY smokey in there. They could do a better job of clearing some of that out with some air recirculators or filters or something. Seriously, you walk out of there with the worst aroma ever. My clothes smelled like I lived inside a Marlboro carton.  Also, the weak drink really brought me down, too. Also a con, the men's room contained two urinals, a toilet, and a sink... all in a room that's about 25 square feet. You could imagine the situation...

Still, this'll be a place I might re-visit eventually, but not somewhere I'd be keen on bringing others. It's not cool.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,1,1,3,vjeEtX9nXtOh3LJwgEE98w

Workers understaffed working hard but people waking out left and right.  Owner should be furious - killing current business and future business,0yAuGcG-KML6EVKGQ1zWPQ,0,0,1,pQiy0toriZUh017MrYsOHw

Jennifer and whoever the other dumb bartender who's name I didn't catch, I hate you.

I used to come to this place every so often about a year ago, and I was given a rude reminder as to why i had stopped.
The security guard let us in around 8 pm and we took a seat at the tables right off to the side of the bar. The bartender was sitting across the bar smoking and no one else was to be seen. We see the waitress come out and give her a few minutes to spot us, but to no avail. About 5 minutes we get up to move, getting the hint, and the security guard comes over to tell us there is no server (on a Friday night?) and we should sit at the bar. Way ahead of you bud, but seems like the armed security guard has more customer service than the two bozos at the bar.

Magically we are noticed and the waitress tries to chat us up, I politely tell her to fuck off (I worded it civilly of course) and put in our food order. Towards the end of our meal was the end of the dumb bimbo's shift, but she didn't bother letting us know she was leaving and that we should get the attention of the other bartender if we needed anything else, like most normal people would do (maybe explains why she's just a waitress?). Probably cause she knew we hated her and she wasn't getting a tip anyway.

This guy must be afraid of eye contact or something, cause I pretty much got the whole freaking bar's attention besides his. People even tried helping us wave him over. No avail. Took us over an hour and a half to get out of this dump, gotten out of a sit-down meal at a real restaurant faster. After getting fed up I finally walked over and waved my hand in his face and demanded my check. 

I don't ask for much when coming to run down bars, but really. The bar. It has corners. Look over to them.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,5,4,1,qA3HE0k9nXiWGJQTREEfFQ
5153466,2007-03-15,0,mZI_wVrLOjz4M-QIC9n-jA,"Of all the PT's scattered about Vegas, I really think this is one of the nicest ones. It's clean, comfy, and there are a gazillion pool tables, all pretty well-maintained. The menu is pretty large, consisting of all sorts of anything fried, sandwiches, burgers, and wraps. I've never really gone to a PT's specifically to eat, but it's happened a handful of times that I've been in a condition where food has become necessary. The chicken Caesar wrap is pretty good, but it's packed full of croutons, which can make for quite a mess in your lap. And of your grill. The prices are reasonable, service is always friendly, and there's a juke box. I couldn't ask for anything more.

If you make it in before midnight, say hi to Bubba. You can't miss him -- he's comparable to The Fridge. Sweet as can be, though. He'll take care of ya.",9zoQR_pQ5SgIixQFyhBDhQ,1,0,4,lvmsfqUhSfMHY-9XyzI8RA

The bartender (didn't get her name and was a little afraid to ask) is a Comp Nazi, insisting that you play video poker non-stop and at lightning speed in order to get a lousy shaker pint glass of Stone IPA. Boo! Heaven forbid you take a few seconds to look up at the TVs to watch a little basketball.  God help you if you take time out to enjoy your dinner.  No, no, no! Keep hitting those video poker buttons! Or NO BEER FOR YOU!!!! 

P.S. Generous tips (I put a fiver in the glass before I even sat down) make no difference.",zPuY0JwZb2e6YHdk9o-7uQ,0,1,1,0ivF6bfjf4VBTT9BCYb8dQ
5754001,2017-07-22,1,mZI_wVrLOjz4M-QIC9n-jA,"Worst Pts ever! Looks sketchy from the outside but we gave it a try because we were picking someone up and were waiting for a delayed flight. The inside was nice though. Very deceiving from the outside. Our first bartender was very nice and we got our drinks right away. Decided to leave the bar area to play pool and opened a tab. 

So...  when I went back up to grab another drink, another bartender clearly saw me sitting and waiting to order, then turns around and asks ""do you need something?"" Um, yeah! Hello. So rude. Drinks are overpriced, $7 for a tiny rocks glass of rum and coke with barely any rum. Stay away. 

Oh yeah! Someone swiped our truck on their way out. Didn't notice it until we got home, called, and they told us there was no parking lot surveillance.",qba1JQlp5a6kEwRRTGxdkg,0,0,1,JYBdJ3WB8j1uSPTwg3zqKQ
