1 star = Terrible. Multiple things went wrong. Never going back.
2 star = Not good. I will not go back, but it wasnt absolutely awful.
3 star = Good, not great. I wouldnt go out of my way, but I *would* go back.
4 star = Excellent food. I really liked it. I could be a regular here.
5 star = Phenomenal food. Something truly special here.

Maybe I was spoiled during the 5 years I lived in ATL. Med Grill in Decatur. Phenomenal. The little hole-in-the-wall place on Broad Street near my office at GSU. Yum. I guess I had it good.

I started to worry when I asked if they ever featured cabbage rolls. They guy ""cooking"" looked at me with a blank stare and said, ""my wife is Polish, she makes cabbage rolls..."" Awesome.

I ordered a small Greek salad, hummus, a falafel wrap, and the kibbe special.

The hummus and falafel wrap were both bland. The pita bread was dry. The greek salad was good, with a generous amount of feta and plenty of chick peas. The kibee special was probably the best part of the meal, but they didnt have laban to go with it.

They people working there were nice enough.

Oh, last straw. The baklava was absolutely awful. Dry and tasted terrible.",4PAbEV_aep8BYVZPzVGrnw,1,0,2,wqcE1LuUFIv3JWfVpsgrrg

I went there the first day, just 2 hours after they had opened their doors. As I stepped into the restaurant, I was instantly greeted with a great big smile and ""hi welcome to  Sultan's Grll""! I love a place with excellent customer service!! 
I ordered the gyro, it was a good size portion, simple - beef & lamb meat, 9"" pita, tomatoes, onions (I ordered without) and sauce on the side. The only thing that's missing was the flavor. Overall It was just bland for me. They could definitely take it up a notch on the flavor.

205082,2017-01-29,1,gBQH64vIkA-kIDFGM290dw,"I LOVE this place. I used to live in the neighborhood and would order from here at least once a month if not more. Now I'm farther away and only get food from here 3-4 times a year. My favorite is the chicken shwarma dinner that comes with rice or fries, a white sauce in a cup, a salad, a full pita, and garnish. I love the seasoning on the chicken and that it's thin pieces with no fat. It can get dry though because it's cooked so well done (which is my preference) so I use the creamy dressing for the salad as a sauce. This dressing is sooo good! It's very flavorful and has good consistency - not too runny like some dressings from take-out places. It's kind of ranchy and garlicky and just delicious. I always get a few extra dressings with my order. 

The dish comes with a sauce that is supposed to be like a tzatziki but they have a tzatziki sauce for the gyros that's different. I don't know what the white sauce is that comes with the meal but I don't like it. It's much thinner/more watered down than either the dressing or tzatziki and has little flavor. I toss it if I forget to tell them I don't want it. The rice is fantastic. The fries are steak fries and are really good as they're crispy, not soggy.  The garnish is called torshi and consists of diced purple onion, pickled beets, and pickled cabbage and something else I love (minus the onion which I hate). I guess I really like flavorful foods with good spices - and I'm not talking about hot spices because I don't care for heat just for the sake of heat - so this place just rings all the bells for me. 

The salad is basic with lettuce, a couple grape tomatoes, and a couple slices of cucumber. The lettuce is very fresh but watery so I rarely eat it with my meal though I do steal the dressing out of it. The pita is hot and crispy. For a couple dollars extra, I can get a side of baba ganoush or hummus on my plate as well. I don't really like hummus but the baba ganoush is very garlicky and very good. I have had the chicken and beef kabobs which are good but in my opinion, the shwarma is better and more filling. The gyros are good but I think I like another take-out place better for gyros because the meat isn't as flavorful or cooked as well. Some places put cucumber in sour cream and call that tzatziki but this place has real tzatziki with cucumber and yogurt. It's not the best but good.  

The Greek salad is very good but again, watery lettuce. I'm happy they clean their lettuce but they need to spin it or something to get all the water off because it dilutes the dressing. We've ordered the family dinner with 4 meats and tons of rice, salad, pita, and torshi. It's a pretty good deal but the meat portions don't feed as many people as indicated especially when your meats are kabobs. Despite my minor complaints, Sultan's Grill is one of my favorite places!",wcNNu8b8czwHzaKvkswO5w,1,1,5,EWx5-ZW3Dbg70rS4X-_sTQ

We ordered an appetizer of Sultan's bread. It did not come out until our main meal so not much of an appetizer.  We ordered a chicken salad and gyro sandwiches with the salad ready in about 15 minutes and 20 minutes to get the gyro sandwiches.  The salad came with dressing which they called vinaigrette but was mainly oil with a very little bit of vinegar.  When asked for another type dressing they only had a creamy which we did not prefer.  Asked for a side of tzatziki instead and they said they would have to charge extra for that.  Had grape leaves as an appetizer and they were soggy and not very tasteful.  The gyro meat was not very warm/hot in the sandwich after 20 minutes waiting for it to come out.

Definitely not a good Sunday lunch experience at this place and we will not be back.  Not sure what it is about this shopping complex but restaurants and food places definitely struggle here.

Their ""Homemade House Dressing"" it's just so thick that it looks and taste like Mayo mixed with ranch dressing its horrible... the rice was just so salty that I still have the salt in my mouth. the gyro meat look old and it taste like old bologna but dryer. The ""fresh"" diced tomato and onions let's say it wasn't that fresh... The main reason that I'm doing this is because in their menu it says ""everybody get greeted with a smile"" I'm sorry but the lady that was at the cashier was not courteous at all even when I told her that it was my first time there. She was not helpful to tell me what Torshi was she just pointed at the menu (i know it says on the menu but where I was looking at it didn't).

1479693,2015-10-25,4,gBQH64vIkA-kIDFGM290dw,"This is not one of the best Mediterranean style restaurants in town. It is conveniently located in the Village Center shopping center where many locals in the area frequent. 

I have not visited Sultan's Grill in months. I used to come regularly over the span of seven years. I stopped coming frequently due to a rapid decline in customer service, food quality, and the inflated pricing for what you get. 

My previous experience nearly ended it for me when the staff couldn't wait to rush me out the door fifteen minutes before closing time. The lamb was cold and appeared to be scraps - as though they turned everything off and put everything away prior to my walking in and then made my food with what they were going to toss out. So naturally I thought - coming in around closing time is not a good idea since closing time is not literally when they close.

This visit, I figured I would see how the restaurant is handling customer service and food quality prior to dinner rush around 4:30pm. Well, customer service is still not very good. Staff is much more preoccupied with dinning at the front table and chatting with friends than providing even a small amount of service. 

The food quality this round was good. We each had a large Greek salad with gyro meat. I have to that say though that serving a large salad on a flat plastic dinner plate makes tossing and eating the salad a little difficult. Since all the toppings are on top, you kind want to toss the salad without dumping your salad on the table. The pita bread that comes with the salad is good and they offer two types of dressing for the Greek salad. I always get the house vinaigrette.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,8,4,3,3yx03xfVaIY6NTn85Cachw

Falafel was clearly made from some factory made rehydrated powder mix. Pita bread was thin and dry.
Kebobs were DRY DRY DRY.
Chicken Shawarma was bland, dry and didn't even remind me of Shawarma of any kind.
The Gyro, is once again, that same factory bought pre-made and frozen mystery meat that so many places serve these days.
Rice was flavorless and didn't even taste fresh.
Hummus was terrible, could have also been made from some powder or bought from some supplier rather than made in house. You get better or similar Hummus at your local market.
Tehini sauce was like water.
It's unfortunate that Mediterranean, Greek and Middle Eastern food restaurants are popping all  over the place as fast, cheap and catering to a public who do not know what it should really taste like, so they don't know when they are getting vamboozled.

A friend and former Vegas resident loves this place and recommended it- he is confident it is the best Mediterranean in Las Vegas. Cursory first visit suggests this place definitely is more than it appears!

Menu includes the usual suspects: falafel, chicken shawarma, dolmas, salads, and gyros, with specialties like the gyro or shwarma bowl, roasted eggplant salad, three different kinds of hummus, and their star dish (for good reason!) the spinach pie-- available only Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

Portions for pita wraps are giant, rice is amazing, salads are fresh, and staff is friendly. Definitely a neighborhood staple, just wish they were closer to my actual neighborhood.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,2,4,QdbubTC5ftjoxyV0G4U1Nw

The hummus is fresh tasting and creamy.  Their warm pita is super tasty whether you eat it with the hummus or one of their salads.

I'm not sure if the management has switched over or what but the food was absolutely terrible compared to what it used to be. 

We ordered a gyro sandwich, side of hummus and a falafel plate for dinner. This all totaled up to about $27 and it was definitely not worth it. The falafel was quite possibly the worst falafel I've had. They were tiny, overcooked and severely lacking in flavor. The hummus was bland and boring. It tasted like they threw some garbanzo beans in a food processor and considered that hummus, no spices or anything. The rice was mediocre, the tahini sauce was extremely salty and the fries were ok. The pita bread was hard and dry.

The salad was just a ton of romaine lettuce with four grape tomatoes, four slices of cumber, and 4 olives in each corner of the carryout container along with a sprinkling of onions.

You would think a detail like that would get mentioned as there's no question I most likely would not have ordered what I did though they didn't, and I wasn't looking to tell them I was not interested as I was very hungry.

I've only been here twice and both times I ordered the same thing - Gyro Sandwich that consisted of seasoned sliced beef, tomato and onion wrapped in pita. For the price of the sandwich ($5.99), they were not stingy at all, it was probably the size of a burrito. The sandwich is served with tzatziki sauce on the side and my only advice is...ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE. This sauce seriously brings together the flavors of the sandwich and you CAN'T, I repeat, CAN'T do without it! The lightness and freshness of the sauce balances out the vegetables and meat contained in the sandwich. 

Like I mentioned above, it is a little restaurant so there is limited amount of tables for dine-in customers however, they offer take-out and the sandwich is an excellent choice of you're on-the-go, which I was.

The place is pretty basic, but a plus is there is some outside seating. Today was quite nice so outdoors we went. 

From the look of the menu, this ""Meditteranean"" place seems to be a mix....I noticed Lebanese dishes, some Greek.

I grabbed a Shish Kafta plate which comes with rice, salad, flatbread and a bit of pickled cabbage and turnip. Pretty decent lunch deal for I believe $6.95. Shish Kafta are ground up  lamb or beef made into a long hot dog shaped patty. It was pretty decent, juicy and good with the tzatiki it came with. Rice was flavorful with saffron butter in it. I also got a side of falafel ($1.29 for 3)....it was okay. They were pretty small and small makes for crunchy, but then it loses some of it's moisture in the middle so I just dipped it heavily in the tahini sauce it comes with. 

The BF got a falafel plate and that was also around $6.95. He added a side of baba ganoush (99cents) which was okay. It was more whipped instead of the usual chunky and definitely has a lot of tahini in it.

We also both got a baklava for dessert (99 cents). It's a small cut, but good. It's a lot spicier of a baklava so it's not the usual mellow honey kind. The BF like that it was very light and flaky and cites that is the ideal baklava texture for him.
 
2 plates, 2 extras, 2 drinks, and 2 baklavas- $22 and some change.

Good deal considering it was a decent portion of food and was pretty good. ( Aww look. I remembered to keep up on prices to be more helpful of a reviewer. ...and included pics). 

 Their shawarmas looks good....they were slicing what looked like chicken shawarma and it looked really juicy. It's now on my list to come back to try. We're in the area fairly often so we'll probably drop in again sometime.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,6,4,oGh59f2U-AipZ9d21xPpLw

I was ecstatic to find a Vegetarian Combo plate, as this is hands down my favorite thing to order at a Mediterranean-esque place, and I have yet to find a reasonably priced, tasty option in Vegas. 

The place is very casual. You order at the counter, and I would say the service was very NY. They weren't overly friendly, but she did call me ""hun"" at some point. 

The plate came with a little green salad, some pickled cabbage, hummus, baba ganoush, pita, grape leaves and falafel. Looking around, it appeared that most people were ordering salads, and the lettuce was a fresh, green Romaine. Perfect for a lunch salad. The hummus was good, and I actually thought I had two helpings of hummus because the baba ganoush is blended to a hummus consistency! I prefer a chunkier baba, but the flavor was still good. The falafel flavor was ok, however, they were small, oblong and a little dense. My ideal falafel is round and a little fluffy. As for the pita, I am not sure if this is just on the vegetarian plate, but it was covered in a thick coating of spices and seeds. The predominant flavor was oregano. The pita was thin, so the spice to bread ratio was lopsided in favor of the spice. I definitely prefer a spice-free pita, so next time I would definitely request that. 

The do have shawarma on a spit twirling around in the kitchen, which is nice to see. They also have Gold Peak tea! I am a fan of the unsweetened black mixed with the sweetened green.

The hummus, is amazing too. I typically get the hummus trio, it's got a little of everything that I want. The pickled beets, mmmm! The green hummus is a mix of scallions and parsley and it's become my favorite fast! 

The Vegetarian platter is a delicious mix of everything a vegetarian would want. Delicious hummus, stuffed grape leaves and falafel. So good.

My wife's chicken was under cooked and over salted. They are so slow to cook the food. Place good be so much better...,H1DdXT2zGzAylXeiI67gGA,0,0,1,n5EQHEBKwi3JbxFUbcANvA
5855884,2014-12-30,0,gBQH64vIkA-kIDFGM290dw,I ordered a Chicken Gyro. The chicken was flavorless and extremely dry. The bread was a dry tortilla and not a fresh pita. Won't be back at all. I don't know how they stay opened.,U5_ejijOPRhWTAHOFS7zBw,3,0,1,5h6FhItdNjE-1TagSCUtcw

Consequently I loooove Greek food, especially the not-so adventurous gyro. I regularly get the gyros from this place and they are pretty good. I get upset when they charge me 50c for hot sauce . People sit down and eat in here , it's very basic and zero ambiance so I take out. Lamb chops are good , they give you a side salad with most dishes but it's just a couple of lettuce leaves and a tomato. Hey but it's close to the house.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,4,0,3,-yJdl1TFs4HU3mPId4khow

We usually order kebab - chicken for my husband, and kafta or chicken for me.  But tonight we decided to shake things up, and the coupon did us in.  There was one from one of the mailers offering two dinners for $14.95.  Kebabs wasn't one of the choices, but Chicken Shawarma was.  How different could it be from Chicken Kebab, which we've always liked???

Step 1:  Call to order for take-out.  Kid on the other end: ""I'm not sure we have enough rice left for two dinners.""  It's 8:15; they close, I think, at 10.  Puts me on hold for quite a while.  Finally:  ""Yes, we do.""  So I order them, with one vinaigrette and one creamy for the salad dressings.  Five minutes and it'll be ready.  No prob, we live close by.

Hubby's sick, so I pick up the food.  Back home, I open my container to see the usual yellow rice, pickled cabbage and turnips, chopped raw red onion, the usual hard, dried-out pita, and a whole mess of dried and shriveled chicken pieces.  I taste one of them;  first I choked on the dryness, then my mouth shriveled from the salt - so much of it that two pieces and my lips were stinging as if I were doing a dead man's float in the Dead Sea.  It was completely inedible.

It was when I noticed that the salads - fresh romaine, two slices of cuke, and one lonely grape tomato - came with not one, but two vinaigrettes.  No creamy for me.  I was then completely pissed and called the restaurant.  Got the same kid who'd taken my order, and asked to speak with the manager.

I was put on hold twice - the second time for a verrrryyyy long time.  How big is this tiny place that he can't find the manager??  Finally the clerk gets back on to tell me that the manager isn't there, and he doesn't have the authority to issue any refunds.  But the manager will call me later this evening, if not, then tomorrow.  He didn't call tonight, so I'm waiting until late tomorrow afternoon to post this review.  I suspect that I will have waited for nothing.

Well, I was right to wait.  I never heard from Sultan's Grill.  I had planned to give this meal two stars, because I do like the chopped veggies and the salad (when I have the dressing I ordered).  But I believe that a food business shouldn't be in the business of selling inedible food, and if they do, they have a duty to respond to complaints.  I'm not even asking for a free meal, just an acknowledgment that they dropped the ball.  A business that does not do this doesn't deserve any stars, so I've revised my rating downward.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,0,1,n4_DcWgQqJ57px8X01B4uQ
5969902,2015-08-18,0,gBQH64vIkA-kIDFGM290dw,Came for lunch and chose the gyro dinner platter and kbob platter.  Both came with salad and rice. Cooked to order and very tasty.  For a done in the wait time was for fine. But if you have a short lunch - order ahead and give them 10-15min before you pickup or dine in,p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,4,E0GhYPtDFQZt0X2jFcYQAg

It was on a Saturday after a library visit, and the service was fantastic.  I had both kiddos in tow and we were 1 of 3 parties in the restaurant.  The woman taking our order was so attentive and making recommendations.  She was truly following the #1 rule of their ""House Rules"" listed on the back of their menus: Service with a Smile.  

The food itself is good, not great- but when I am craving that taste of the Mediterranean, it hits the spot. I ordered the Gyro Sandwich and the green hummus and enjoyed every bite.  The price was very reasonable, and another plus is the fact that it is very close drive and in the vicinity of many places I visit regularly.  

On my second visit (for lunch during the workweek), the place was packed with everyone on their lunch breaks, and the service (different cashier) took a 180. There was absolutely no service with a smile while I I placed my order of a Chicken Schwarma and a half order of Baba Ganoush ""to go"" and waited about 15 minutes.  I didn't mind because I came during the peak time and had my iPhone to keep me company.  Well, my head was down and I was shocked when my bag of food was just shoved under my face.  No ""excuse me"", no ""your food is ready"", no verbal communication whatsoever.  And I was definitely very aware of my surroundings, anticipating my food.  Unfortunately, she turned around before she could se the look of complete disgust on my face. Well, I don't know if the rude service ruined my meal because the chicken schwarma was completely dry.  At least the Baba Ganoush was good.  

I defintely won't return during the lunch rush ever again, but if I am craving a gyro on the weekend, then I may just visit again.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,6,0,3,vsriECAeuDh6Nh5FUr6Qpw
