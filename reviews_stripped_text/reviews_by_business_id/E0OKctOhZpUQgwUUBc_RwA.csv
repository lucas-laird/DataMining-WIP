Ordering service is noteworthy - asked if first time visiting them and if say yes they explain their menu and patiently answer your questions 
She recommended the double but I got single 
Food is ok ...I still prefer In & Out for flavor and their addicting sauce 
Another noteworthy item be their tempura fried beans ...doesn't sound too sexy but man, of man ...ill drive by just for this! It's very crispy on outside and naturally moist  green beans inside ...and unlike Tempura which you need digging sauce for flavor ...this is good on its own but they offer Ranch, Thousand Island, etc I got honey mustard and barely used it coz did I say it's tasty on its own ?",n_TY6rd1wXZBczBaOaK6Rw,0,0,3,anIZTbRzC8yazfcjEzf8-w

377583,2017-05-18,0,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"I always compare any good burger joint to In n Out. I didn't know what to expect since none of my friends ever talked about this place. My first impression when I walked in was wow this place is clean. And it doesn't have the fast food atmosphere like In-N-Out does.
First glance at the menu I was happy, no over priced burger here like other higher end burger joints. And it has pretty extensive menu (can't wait to try on the tuna, chicken and tri tip).
My husband ordered the original char burger and I had the teriyaki burger. We split an onion ring and strawberry malt. We sat down waiting for the order which came out pretty quick. As we took our first bite, we both let out a soft groan of satisfaction. Sorry In-N-Out this burger tastes so much better and I like the fact that I can have pineapple on my burger. The onion rings were so crispy and seasoned just right. And the best part is, neither the burger or the onion ring was greasy. Normally my husband would push the onion rings toward me because they're too greasy. This time I have to fight a little for my fair share. And the malt, oh the malt was deliciously melting in my mouth.

You have NO WAY of contacting your store directly. I placed a drive thru order, you screwed it up. I get my receipt to call in and get it remade. Zilch, nada, nothing, no phone number. I found a phone number on Google on my Audi Connect. Picked the option 3 and was immediately told to go to the website and fill out the form, CLICK. The line hangs up on me!

I did not have internet access, so that is just STUPID to ASSUME everyone can just connect to the web. You are a REAL store, providing REAL food, to REAL people, so have a way to contact REAL managers. DUH! How stupid can a company be? 

I called the corporate offices, nope. No help. This is a franchise. Call the franchise owner. How exactly does this get my sandwich remade NOW? It doesn't.

So sad that people running business are so stupid that they think this is customer service. OMG, the manager might have to talk to customers!!! What a concept.

While writing this, the Franchise owner contacted me. It is the corporate offices forcing this system on them. I will contact the Franchise Manager at Corporate, but still this has hurt this local stores reputation.

Most often they are rushing through people like they are too busy to do their one job, take the correct order.

I personally like to think of myself as a burger connoisseur and when I don't want to spend $25 on a delicious piece of heaven at Holsteins I head to the Habit Grill!

From what I've gathered this is a chain burger joint that comes to us from California and offers a somewhat limited menu.   Don't let the menu part turn you off - nothing is as limiting as In N Out and look how successful they are.

As of now I've tried almost every burger on their menu and have yet to be disappointed.  They do have a few sandwiches/ melts on the menu along with salads.

Don't get me wrong - as an American we probably have the worst eating habits in the world but let's be real here - none of us think ""man I can't wait to eat a double cheeseburger but right after I smash this side salad"". In short - I don't agree with burger places selling salads but hey!  we all know how important organic, low carb, gluten free vegan options are.

We also ordered a Santa Barbara Style Charburger which is a double Charburger with avocado on a grilled sourdough. Very big burger!!! The fries were a little disappointing though.

As for the burger I have to say it's just ok. The bread was just regular bread nothing fancy here. The meat wasn't as juicy as say shake shake or five guys! The toppings are great and the burger is filling but just was missing that overall wow factor. It is a good burger but it's far from great.    

 That may be harsh but I love my burgers and expected more. I'm not saying don't give this place a try but according to others reviews I was expecting better. Others compared it to five guys and it's not even close.....

 So why the four stars? Because It is a good burger and the service is awesome the staff is super friendly.

From the moment you start having your order taken you are asked if you have been before or not and walked through if not and warmly welcomed if you have. I have had Jhoi and the Manager Edith wait on me many times and each time they nail everything from the warm greeting to making sure your order is perfect. Unlike most places they also offer ranch for free and are never stingy with it. The food is actually really good and they offer the ability to add patties, cheese, mushroom, and get extra grilled onions, which we often do, to build your own or make a larger burger and it's not very much to add the stuff at all. This has become by go to for great burgers and fries, quick and easy. The drive thru can be a little tricky.

The tuna was overcooked and very firm but not too dry. I was looking forward to a succulent filet that melted in my mouth. They did more than sear it which is why I docked a star..

The fries were great. Thick fries which weren't crispy but rather had a soft interior which I prefer. They're like bendable.

Anyways, this is not a review about in-n-out.... BUT i had to put my 2 cents out there...:) 

Habit Burger Grill on the other hand was fantastic!! The burger had a great char flavor to it... It was juicy and the toppings were on point. I had the hatch green Chile char with extra lettuce. And it was amazing... So delicious and with the hatch chilli's it had a little kick. 

On my second visit i had their BBQ bacon burger...bbq sauce was good...a little on the sweet side but the saltiness from the bacon counteracted the sweetness and it was a great bite. Yummy!! So far i have tasted 2 burgers and they have been dabomb.com!!

And they have a chili bar with jalapeños, pepperchinis and yellow chili peppers... Yummy!!! 

My bf had the Santa Barbara and he said it was delicious and it looked yummilicious with all that creamy avocado!

Now onto the sides... We had the fries.... Yummy! Perfectly golden and crispy... Tempura battered green beans... So good... The tempura batter gave it that crunch and the green beans were perfectly cooked. The onions rings.. Wow.. if you love onions rings get some. They were just perfectly crispy with tender onions in the middle and the flavor was dead on.

I had the Char burger with sweet potato fries. Burger was very good, not greasy (huge plus for me) and the charbroiled onions added a nice flavor. Sweet potato fries were awesome. Hubby had the tri-tip sandwich with teriyaki sauce and fried green beans. I was apprehensive about the beans, after recently eating a disappointing similar dish at the Red Rock movie theater. But these were outstanding! Again, not greasy, crisp batter and seasoned perfectly. They were excellent with or without the side of ranch.

The setting is similar to a Chipotle/Smashburger, quick casual dining, as opposed to a fast food restaurant. Spacious booths, free condiments like banana peppers and jalapeños, and three types of iced tea were the icing on the cake!

The burger itself,  im sorry to say, wasnt anything special.  I also think for aprx 3.00 for an onion ring side, they could put more than 6 onion rings in the order?

My favorite thing on the menu is not the burger though, it is the Caesar salad. Yeah I said it. The salad comes with romaine lettuce (duh) parm cheese and croutons, and it comes already dressed. At first this turned me off because I like a little dressing with my salad, and thinking that someone else knew how much dressing I wanted seemed offensive. But said salad maker much love dressing too because this salad is not dry at all. Not only that, it's a HUGE salad and it's less than $5!! I usually add protein though, either tri-tip which comes with a teriyaki glaze, or ahi tuna. This adds a few extra dollars to the price but it is worth it! 

I don't always get a salad here, but I realllly don't care for the burgers. I do like the tri tip sandwich which comes on sourdough bread. Everything tastes better on sourdough. I also like the tempura green beans and the ranch is bomb as well. Try the strawberry limeade too, it's refreshing on these hot ass summer days.

One thing to note is the parking here SUCKS. The restaurant is located in a super busy shopping center off Blue Diamond/Decatur and there are a ton of surrounding businesses all jam-packed into this little corner.

The cons:   There aren't many.  It's a little bit more expensive than in and out but the value is there.  I'd say that a double double is equal to a single here.   So when you get a double charburger here is pretty much a 4x4 over there.  I didn't find it to be as tasty as in and out.  Fries are good for a fast food place but they definitely aren't anything to write home about.  I'm like 98% sure they were frozen like 10 minutes before I ate them.

Chocolate with just a hint of that malt flavor it - was almost like a liquid whopper. The salad was great too and I got the BBQ/Ranch on the side so I mixed them together to make the most perfect dressing. 

The salad was crisp, fresh, and the chicken on it was charred which tastes awesome. In fact, they call their burgers ""charburgers"" because that is their signature flavor. I also tried the tempura green beans which were pretty good. They taste just like they sound, green beans dipped in tempura batter and fried. In all honesty, I missed having fries with my meal, so next time I would probably stick to that and skip the tempura green beans even though they were great. My boyfriend tried the Santa Barbara Style Char and said it tasted great, I was so full by this point I didn't get to try it. This is fine because it gives me a good excuse to come back!",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,4,3,5,ehKRzqzcODjR_LaKu4xYkA

I tried The Habit tonight for the first time and was blown away. For a fast food burger spot they are clean, neat and organized. There is varied comfortable seating available with an assortment of options on their menu. 

For vegans there is a portabella burger, veggie burger or a burger with no meat/ no cheese. So amazing! Fries are fresh, add on bar is kept clean and there is home made ranch available. 

Must try!",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,5,4,5,rPlzkKGmuOen00MdT9MKJA
2352042,2016-10-30,2,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"Love this place. Reminds me of a bobs big boy, as their hamburgers are large and tasty. Burgers to me are burgers but what makes this place stand out above the rest is their chicken sandwiches and salads. the chicken sandwiches taste very juicy, not over cooked like a lot of places. The salads are huge, I've eaten them a ton of times and only been able to finish it once. Very balanced with ingredients and dressing. My favorite has to be the Cobb for the amount of good in it. Great amount of chicken, egg, avacodo and bacon. I'm drooling as I think of it. 

I think the drive through is a waste of time to make the food come out quicker but it's perfect when I've got my sleeping five year old in the car and don't feel like waking her. They've got lots of options for toppings and sides. The onion rings far outweighs the fries. 

I get how busy they get at lunch time. There's no where to sit and people literally stand at the end of your table til your finished. The tables aren't always clean too but understandable that turnover happens quickly",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,4,4,4,zyNHmdW34T6CPXNbJDRw-g

2416629,2016-07-14,9,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"It seems like there is always another out of town burger spots with an established fan base opening up in Vegas. Next to do so, Habit Burger, with over 40 years of operation under their belts, brings their charburgers, sandwiches, and shakes from Southern California to the Valley. It kind of reminds me of Carl's Jr but a lot better, yet different, and I'm a Carl's Jr fan There's actually one right across the street if you're into comparing.

The Santa Barbara is probably my favorite. It's a double charburger with cheese and avocado in grilled sourdough. I don't know what I like the most about it the grilled sourdough, which I'm always a sucker for,  or the avocado. 

The Teriyaki charburger I liked. It came with a nice sized slice of grilled pineapple with mayonnaise, pickle, tomato, lettuce and caramelized onions. Can't really say no to teri burger with pineapple unless it was bad. Good thing it was good.

I've also had an albacore tuna sourdough sandwich. Different but I actually liked it a lot. A friend tried the albacore in a salad, looked pretty good so I might have to try it for myself another time. 

Their onion rings are a must, very crispy, not burnt, and very delicious. The condiments bar with its various pepper are good. I like that I can stuff my burgers with as much jalapeños as I want to. Their shakes aren't fancy but not that bad I'd order them again.

This location gets pretty busy during lunch and the drive thru is weird cause it goes around the bank next door you might miss the entrance.

To be honest I've previously gone to another Habit Burger location, tried their double charburger combo, and kind of wrote them off cause it wasn't that great, little plain. Glad that I ending up attending the Yelp event held here cause it was a good chance to try Habit again and more of the menu and lets just say I've been a number of times since.

Good place I'd go back. Probably wont order the regular charburgers again unless I'm dumping a lot of jalapeños on it.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,15,14,4,1d3F53NHTfUMDBftOTUQcA

Last Friday, I decided to give it another try and chose a salad. I got back to my office and started to eat it but was surprised when I tried to take a bite of the chicken and it was very tough and rubbery. Upon closer look, I found the chicken under cooked and very pink in the middle. I immediately tried to call and the recording said to visit the web site to contact, which I did. After receiving no response for a couple of days, I again sent another message through the web site. I have yet to hear anything back after a week.

My burger was full of juice, sweetness and savory all in one bite with fresh lettuce buns and ripe tomatoes. DELICIOUS! I've gone to other places and had their teriyaki burgers before but this one takes the cake. We big agreed that both our burgers had a savory char grilled taste to it- you know, the kind that reminds you of being in a backyard BBQ with your friends and family. 

We also got onion rings, fried green beans, and fries. The onion rings had a nice crispy taste to it and didn't taste like it was drenched in oil. It had a kinda sweet taste to the batter but I honestly think that's what made it taste so good. It almost tasted like it had panko on it to because of how loud the crunch was with each bite. I also loved the fried green beans too- you can tell the beans are fresh and full of crisp and the right amount of juiciness to it. There wasn't a huge amount of coating on the green beans but just enough to give you the bite from the batter and the freshness of the bean.

Yesterday I was able to check out the new location for the first time and I was very impressed! You can find the Habit's new location right next to Teriyaki Madness, on the northeast corner of Decatur and Blue Diamond Road.

As expected, the charburgers were so juicy and tasty! The fries were delicious and given in a generous portion. This is in no way a surprise.

What really stood out for me here was the amazing service! Everyone I encountered here was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were all happy and satisfied!

It is almost dangerous that I have a location like this so close to my house! I see myself coming here repeatedly to enjoy those luscious, scrumptious burgers! ...and becoming a much larger mammal due to it! :P

My go to is usually a Veggie Burger (add Avacado) and an order of either Tempura Green Beans or Onion Rings.

I usually give places 2 tries before writing a review, but eh... I don't think I would be rushing my tush back over anytime soon.",FmtnXwc_eyvpIv1Q1-bVCQ,0,1,3,zUxHWqcjKybnIpXVL3rhyA

We took the Albacore burger and the Tri-Tip Steak burger along with sweet potato fries, fried green beans and a Sundae, and everything tasted very good. The price is also rather reasonable given what you get but the dessert selection is pretty much the same as what you would get in any other fast food.

The restaurant was rather empty when we arrived so we were able to order right away. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located on Blue Diamond Road right by I15 which makes it easy to access. The restaurant also offers a large parking lot which means that you won't have any problem to park.

Overall, my experience with The Habit Burger Grill  was positive and I would recommend it. This is a better fast food restaurant than your average one. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,3,1,4,jS6cGrWLWurWN-LZjxeGtg

Juicy and tender meat, pink in the middle with a sesame roll and tempura green beans which were banging! Crunchy side without the French fry guilt. My dad and husband find something wrong everywhere we go. Dad had the Tri tip on sourdough and was saying he wasn't coming back because they forgot to give him his teriyaki sauce, otherwise he'd rather go to Johnny Rockets.  My husband got the burger but even though I told him to ask for medium based on other comments, he didn't so he said it was like eating a hockey puck. He said the pickles were limp and hated the shredded lettuce. They also put the wrong cheese on the burger. Next time they want lunch, they are going to Rio and I'm going to Habit.

I ordered for me and my Mom for a ""to-go"" order and I asked if it was possible to order the burgers with ""raw onion"" instead of cooked and add cheese to another burger and the girl took my specifications without hesitation and read me back my entire order perfectly to ensure that everything was correct and offered a cup for a beverage while I waited! I tried the lemonade while I waited and it just delicious! Once my buzzer went off and my food was ready the gentleman read me back my entire order and made sure it was all correct, offered me ketchup and ranch and even offered to help me carry out everything to my car! The service was incredible and the food was just as amazing, the ranch is just fresh and delicious as well as the meat and produce!

3634294,2018-04-13,0,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"Made my first stop at a Habit Burger Grill today. Here's my review.

The restaurant is a clean and attractive fast food environment.

The menu consists mostly of burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads. They are known for the ""Charburger"". You may order a single or double. Cheese is $0.60 extra. For about $9.75, I ordered a double Charburger with cheese meal which comes with fries and a drink.

Now, I'm not trying to be funny or negative for any reason, but this burger tastes nearly identical to a Big Mac from McDonalds. The only difference is the quality of the ingredients. If the McDonalds Big Mac is ""Grade D"", The Habit Double Charburger with cheese is ""Grade B"". The beef is fatter and more juicy. The sesame seed bun is fatter. The pickle slices are fatter. The onion pieces are larger. Other than that, the remaining contents of this burger is virtually identical to that of a Big Mac which is why they taste the same. It was like a Big Mac that someone put a lot of love and care into but left out the center bread piece.

Now onto the fries. Yes, they too taste just like McDonalds fries except they're fatter and shorter. 

When I was done, I felt like I ate a Big Mac meal on steroids.

The whole experience was fairly similar to McDonalds except the food is better and the restaurant is cleaner. It was almost like they copied the business model for McDonalds but beefed up all the ingredients, added some decent tables and chairs and swept the floor.

Also, just so you know, they offer chicken nuggets on the kids menu with your choice of BBQ, Honey Mustard or Sweet N Sour sauce. Sound familiar? If they offered a yogurt parfait on the desert menu it wouldn't surprise me.

I'd probably go back, but only with friends. By myself I'd pick another place for a cheeseburger and fries.",k_ygij9GEqELTg3nYca_zw,0,0,2,SQIiSzYvyzzTBBEeOE9NRw

The menu is sweet and simple.  Easy to read and lays everything out for you.  All burgers come with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  Add cheese, bacon and other options for a few more cents.  They also have chicken options too.

I ordered a single char burger with bacon and made it a meal so I can test out their fry game.  It only took a few minutes before it was ready.  The burger smelled great and was very tasty,  the only thing I would change is to use crisp leaf lettuce instead of shredded.  The fries were hot and fresh.

4500858,2016-07-13,0,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"Decided to try this new place for lunch today.  We ordered the Santa Barbara burger, which did not disappoint; Char burger, sweet potato fries, onion rings and a garden salad.  We also had two beverages.  The food was delicious!  The char burger was juicy (but not too much) and wrapped so it made it nice to eat without everything spilling out.  The Santa Barbara wasn't wrapped but the way it's put together allowed it to be eaten without a big mess.  The salad's ingredients were very fresh and didn't give the appearance of having been made and sitting around.  It was also a nice mix of lettuce, not just iceberg, had tomato slices, cucumber slices, shredded carrots and croutons; it was huge.  The onion rings were nice and crisp--the batter they used had a good flavor and the sweet potato fries were very good too.

We will definitely be back because there are some other good menu items that we would like to try.  They have a nice variety of salad offerings also.  In addition, they have some not-so-run-of-the-mill offerings such as Charbroiled Albacore Tuna sandwich, Tri-tip sandwich, and tempura green beans to name a few.  You can request your sandwich be served with no bun, but lettuce ""bun"" instead...I think that's called protein style.

They have a nice condiment bar that offers jalapeños, pepperocinis, hot peppers and lemons & limes.  Also, they have a large pump with little cups for ketchup.  This is located near the beverage area and the napkins, etc. are there too.  I liked the layout because you could get your beverage, then assemble the lid, etc. and wipe the counter if you spilled and the napkins and trash are right there so it makes it easy to clean up (your mother doesn't work there...so it's always courteous to clean up...LOL!)

In addition to soda, they have a nice offering of several different teas and their strawberry limeade, which I hear they are known for but I didn't try it.  They also offer milkshakes and malts which looked good but I didn't try those either. They also offered a vitamin water from the machine.

We also liked the decor, which was a step up from the usual fast-food establishments.  The booths had nice, cushiony seats and were not so smashed in together; the 2 person booth & table top was bigger than most places so it didn't feel so cramped. They also have a nice, 10-seat hi-top ""community"" table that is convenient and allows for flexibility in seating.  Plus the decor is a bit more upscale than other places.  For example, they had nice pendant lights over that community table.  They also had a few seats outside (in the shade).  I guess I would describe it as quick food casual and not ""fast food"".

Super friendly staff also contributed to our great experience here.  They also have a drive thru if that is appealing to you.  It's sort of funky because you have to go around the bank just to the east of the Habit to access the drive thru.

Last, but certainly not least, it was very clean!  Of course it's new and we'll see if they can keep that up.  

For fast, casual, fresh & delicious food in a clean place, this like will become our go-to place! Try it out!",wlF5PX7A1rUGgIE5VKaC1A,4,0,5,tL4UCQec0DOrCoUAB5q4Uw

4655398,2018-05-21,6,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"Since the time that I visited the first Habit Burger in Las Vegas at Hughes Center Drive in April 2016, the Habit Burger is a fast casual brand that I trust. Evidently it is a trust shared by several people. Habit Burger is growing at a rapid pace. Since I reviewed the Hughes Center Drive location on April 4, 2016; Habit Burger opened 103 locations. Talk about rapid growth! Habit Burger's ""Charburger"" had also been voted the Best Burger in America by Consumer Reports in the middle of 2014.

  The way I see it, the Habit Burger joins the movement of Class-A fast casual chains that have settled in Las Vegas alongside In N Out, Shake Shack, and Freddie's. In similar fashion to the Class-A fast casual chains, the restaurants include an open kitchen, made to order food, and better quality.

  It was after hours of hiking in Spring Mountain Ranch State Park that I decided to have a post-hiking supper in a fast casual restaurant that I trust. Now if only parking here was as smooth as the restaurant experience. This Habit Burger is in the Albertson's-anchored Shopping center at the northeast corner of Blue Diamond and Decatur. The back of the restaurant faces Blue Diamond Road. The issue is that there is a high traffic volume on both Decatur and Blue Diamond that creates a risky situation pulling onto southbound Decatur without a traffic signal or having to cross three lanes of traffic on Blue Diamond westbound to make a u-turn onto the eastbound highway. Furthermore, if you are not using the drive thru chances are that there will be a decent walk to the restaurant. 

  When I visited the restaurant on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 at 6:15 pm, the friendly lady at the counter greeted me right away. Above her it was a breeze ordering off the menu. On account of the fact that there are only a couple of combination menu items, I was immediately set on the Charcheeseburger combo. It included French Fries and beverage. After taxes, it came out to $8.65. With the food being prepared upon ordering, the friendly lady presented me with a buzzer that went off when the food was ready.

  On a Tuesday evening, there were plenty of tables. I sat in the back right at a table overlooking the open kitchen. After hearing horror stories about fast food restaurants including a Long Island Checkers, I would like to see who is making the food that I am going to eat. And I want to see what is going on. It was near the open kitchen where I filled up my beverage cup from the Coke fountain. If I had been up for Peach & Ginger Nectar or Strawberry Limeade I could of filled the cup with one of these signature Habit Burger beverages. It was at the edge of the open kitchen where I partook in my Habit Grill tradition of enjoying a couple of chili peppers from the pickle condiment station which also includes peppercinis and jalapeños.

   The Charcheeseburger combo came out Yelp photo ready. The sandwich is in a sleeve that adds a nice photo quality to it. Even better than photographing it was eating it. Between two fresh tasting buns was the charbroiled burger, crisp lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, pickles, and mayonnaise. Where the sandwich wasn't huge in size it made up for it in taste. I know that I just enjoyed a delicious burger when I experience a charburger aftertaste. Complimenting the Charcheeseburger were good tasting French Fries.

 Habit Burger has yet to let me down. As of the time of this review that comes over two years from my initial Habit Burger review, this is a fast casual brand name that I still trust.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,19,15,4,_NWxFBJf3urDvfadLCb7Cw
4658071,2016-08-05,0,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"Tasty burger, but not enough to unseat In-N-Out or Smashburger. I try to get the signature item when going to a new burger place, so I had the Original Double Char with cheese, fries, and a drink. The patties are flame grilled and the flavor profile reminded me of a fancier Whopper. It was cooked well, but nothing about the burger was distinct enough to separate it from other fast food burgers. The fries reminded me of fries you get at a baseball game. Standard fountain drink offerings, but of note were the additional handmade strawberry limeade and three fresh brewed teas. The strawberry limeade was delicious and refreshing.

If I want a burger, I'll probably not come here again, especially since In-N-Out is cheaper. However, there are other items that caught my eye. You don't normally find things like a tri-tip steak sandwich and an albacore tuna sandwich on the menu at a fast food burger joint, so I will definitely try those items on the next visit.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,2,0,4,Gi1X_trAMGOYboRQMAdPfQ

Ok, don't get me wrong, it's a solid burger, but I think maybe I had very high expectations based on reviews and photos.  I will say this, if it were purely based on the fries I'd have given five stars; they were amazing.  

The ""charburger"" is what sold me, but I honestly didn't taste a lot of char.  I got the Double Charburger which is their big item and it just fell a little flat to me. 

I like that the ingredients are fresh and it's not McDonald's level fast food, but it's about ten minutes from me and I honestly wouldn't make it my business to go out of my way when I have In & Out and Five Guys right around the corner.  

I'd put it somewhere in-between In & Out and Five Guys.

Again, it was a solid burger, but there was nothing ""wow"" about it.  If you're near by, definitely stop in because it's better than most of the fast food options.

Once we got home, we tasted our food. The French fries were stale and kind of chewy. Probably not their fault. French fries tend to get a little cold and stale once you get home from the establishment. I ordered the Garlic Portobello mushroom burger and my husband ordered the BBQ bacon burger. Well, they were pretty good. But honestly, I can live without ever having to eat there again. The burgers tasted like something you can get from Applebee's or TGIFriday's. Not bad, but nothing original or to run through the neighborhood screaming about. We will just stick to Smash Burger, Bachi Burger and In n Out for now on.",7uqal6YKtmCoF4sZTsqkHw,0,0,3,3FPzMvkWsPs5AZ_DfVKkgw
5093182,2016-06-20,3,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"So we had to try this place to see what everyone keeps talking about and that it's a CALI franchise?. They said it was a mix between In n Out, Five Guys, and Smash Burger. To tell you the truth there was nothing about this place that stood out to me bc most of the items we tried lacked flavor. Prices are aren't too bad. Combos range from $6-$11 each. 

Albacore Tuna Sandwich - The sandwich was greasy to the touch but had a nice crisp toast to it. Tuna had a nice sear to it. Came with tartar sauce on the side but even with the tartar sauce it lacked flavor and needed seasoning. 

BBQ Bacon Charburger - good

Mushroom Swiss Burger - good

Fries - blah ..could use salt or seasoning. Was soggy with no crunch or texture to it

Tempura Green Bean Fries - nice crunch to it but lacks flavor. A little salt goes a long way 

Onion rings - probably my favorite thing in the menu that I've tried so far. Perfectly cooked. Nice and crunchy

Strawberry limeade - has that perfectly sweet tartness to it

Would I come back to try other things on the menu? Yes. Did it have the wow factor to make me have to crave for it. No.",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,6,4,4,p8P9Uhb05dR81SJt5cwUBQ

I would compare it to price of In n out but these burgers are thicker and too me taste better. Ordered the double char with cheese meal. Only thing I wish I added were some sauces. Burger was fresh and not overly seasoned which I loved. Fries were ok wish it had more flavor. Plenty of seating for dining in and the bathrooms were extremely clean.

Launched in Santa Barbara California in 1969 by two brothers, and since having spread to more than ten States with four locations dotting Las Vegas beginning in 2016, The Habit Burger Grill had been a source of some curiosity ever since opening down the street and some calling it the best burger under $5 in the city, Consumer Reports also awarding them the title of ""Best Tasting Burger in America"" back in 2014.

Slightly different from the hundreds of locations up and down California, the local Habits all franchise operations while those in California are considered 'corporate' entities, it was mid-day on Friday that a stop was made at the Blue Diamond location where the line was just two persons long, a man easily identifiable as the General Manager teaching employees how to work one of the register functions immediately greeting all guests with a big smile, the menu pretty self-explanatory with Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads, Shakes and Sides.

Using a vibrating pager system to summon diners, a similar situation to that at Shake Shack given the fact that each item is made to order, it was in passing on the Tri-Tip that is offered 'medium, medium-well, or well' that an order of two Sandwiches plus a side and Shake took place, the Charburger with Cheese complimentary and taken without Mayo as a result of signing up for their free online ""Char-club.""

Featuring a clean design and condiment station with all the expected, plus several styles of Peppers, a quick look at Beverages also shows Habit to offer their own housemade Lemonade alongside Coca-Cola products, a quick Buzz from the little square summoning diners back to the counter where a weighty tray contained everything presented nicely, a bit of paper left on the Straw and each Sandwich half-wrapped and Insta-gram worthy.

Starting with the Onion Rings, a relatively simple item for even a fast-food kitchen to execute well, The Habit improves on most by cutting their Rings uniform before dredging  them in Buttermilk and frying each one crisp, a total lack of oil making each one crunchy and flavorful, much like the well-seasoned Chicken Breast that is spiced, seasoned and breaded on site before being placed on a grilled bun with California-fresh Produce and a couple Pickle Rounds, the recommended Red Pepper Sauce a worthy addition to a Sandwich that not only outsizes and tastes better than that at Chick-Fil-a, but also makes the version at Shake Shack seem somewhat boring.

Moving on to the Charburger, only the second ""fast-food"" or ""quick-casual"" option tasted in almost a decade, those expecting a Restaurant quality Burger are likely to be a little disappointed by the thin patty that none-the-less contains a lot of flavor and good grind for just $3.25 and an extra sixty cents for a slice of Cheddar, the Caramelized Onions definitely adding a lot of 'oomph' without making the Sandwich too messy while the Milkshake served next to it unfortunately did little to be impressive, the 'Coffee' flavor substantially muted by that of Chocolate though the base was homogenous and quite creamy.

THREE AND A HALF STARS:  Good for what it is, and far better than most of what Panera or Chipotle is serving at a price that is far less, The Habit Burger Grill certainly takes a major step in upgrading the sort of stuff served at Burger King, McDonalds or Wendy's though the relatively small menu may leave those looking for more variety or bargain-basement dining unimpressed.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,7,4,2X0-4NwFOSWFE-R2qo0njg

5518179,2016-12-06,8,E0OKctOhZpUQgwUUBc_RwA,"After a sincere apology from the owner and a request to come back to the store and make amends, I am happy to say that at least the higher positions in the store know true customer service. 

Granted, I will admit my fault for not reading the sign correctly for their hours between the drive-thru and the actual store. However, because of this experience and other reviews, I know that I am not the only one who got mixed up with the Hours and found it confusing. It also doesn't change the fact that I really did feel a sense of rudeness coming from one of the workers who was cleaning and just staring at me. 

But let's move on to the food now. 

When I went for my 2nd meal, I noticed the inconsistency of their food. I understand mediocre food if the prices are dirt cheap like normal fast food joints, but the prices here are much steeper, and because of that, I expect to get the same quality of food every time I go. 

The saving grace from my last review here was the fries. They were thin-cuts, super crispy, lightly salted, and just wonderful. When I came, I got soggy ones, as if they've been out from the fryer for a while now. 

So without the mix-up of the hours in my scoring, I would still rate this place at an average of three stars.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,9,7,3,SUxf2wrvqUquh6O4D59mEA

I have a college degree in Hospitality management. The more diverse your staff is culturally the more successful your business will be. They should have employees who are white, black, Asian, Spanish, American Indian, etc. The more diverse the employee pool is the more money they'll be making. I'd say they have a manager who only hires his/her own ethnicity and this is obvious when you step in the door. On 3/14/2018 they had nine employees working and they appeared to all be the same ethnicity. The restaurant will be losing a lot of customers and $$$ if they continue this practice.
