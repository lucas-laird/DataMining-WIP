I had literally been counting down the days, so that I could start enjoying Chef Kenny's food again. What shocked me was that the Cajun fish was even BETTER than the one I used to order at the other place! It tasted perfect before...I didn't know that you could improve on perfection! The melody of spices, coupled with the texture of the fish was so tasty, that I left none for my guy (he was at work). He wasn't too happy, but when he ate the orange chicken and the crispy beef, he forgot all about it!",pZR_w5PS9ENTi1Ca6uaRSA,1,0,5,JFmgrCF1RbU71HmlYKPtmw

But this spot has sushi which of course I had to try!!! The sushi does fill a void that has been missing in my life for awhile. The two rolls I got were the crunchy roll and coconut roll. The crunchy roll was my favorite. The coconut roll was good, but a little on the sweet side. Next time i will add spice! Would recommend adding mango as an option to the sushi, that would be really cool!",q56w9mg1T_G2l5Rbt_t_tQ,1,0,4,JI5NRiwSR1W-wV0EAxfCRw

Now here is my issue , it tasted like the real deal ! My first bite i said no there's no way so i pick up my phone and call the restaurant and ask is all your food vegan based the lady says yes ! So i said thank you ! I'm still not believing it tho but it's excellent food very delicious and had me stuffed! The reason i wanted to rate 4 stars is cause i wish grub hub explained more of what is the base of each entree. But when you come across that friend that's like vegetarian or vegans are boring bring them some food from chef Kenny and ask them if it's boring now !

2006065,2018-07-02,0,L16ly2UGc9j4qO3Id8Gx3A,"I've been to Chef Kenny's other restaurants and have quite enjoyed them all. This is Chef Kenny's newest endeavor and I'm glad to report I approve of it! 

Onto the food! 

Hot and sour soup: I'm pretty picky about hot and sour soup and this one was done perfectly. It has more of that ""sour"" taste from the vinegar which is what I enjoy. The spice level was perfect as well. 

""Beef"" pan fried noodles: Taste wise, this was good. However, I did wish it had more sauce to it because it was pretty dry. 

Fried tofu and ""fish"": I don't know why but I really liked the texture of the ""fish""...most likely from what it's made of. I'm not completely sure what's it made from but I'm thinking it's tofu related. If you close your eyes while eating this, the texture is very similar to fish. 

Roti canai: my favorite! Roti canai is what I always get when I visit Malaysia. This is the closest place I can find that is similar to the ones back home. It's a thin flakey pastry (almost like a pancake) that you dip into chicken curry...in this case ""chicken"" curry. I highly recommend this dish.

3 different sushi rolls (spicy tuna, jack fruit, crunchy roll): Instead of the usual cucumber rolls or California rolls, Chef Kenny came up with more interesting rolls. Out of the 3 that we got, I liked the jack fruit because it's different. It had a nice sweet taste to it that I surprisingly enjoyed. 

Overall, I would come back here again. I would love to bring my friends here. I do want to try their lunch menu because from what I can see, it looks like a pretty good deal!",60skTN6p8SdQ2sGNKL0vRQ,0,0,4,NksiPZEOUFw0169o2vRYpQ

2474390,2018-07-01,1,L16ly2UGc9j4qO3Id8Gx3A,"I have been seeing all about this place on the Las Vegas Vegan Group on Facebook, and I knew that when I was in Vegas I had to go here first thing. As soon as I came over the hill and started descending into Las Vegas, my mouth started salivating because I knew what I was about to experience. There were definitely high expectations. 

When I got to the restaurant I was so happy I practically ran for the door. When I got inside I was greeted by a very friendly, and helpful hostess who told me all about the sushi. I then got the menu and was pretty overwhelmed by all the amazing options. 

We all decided to order the fried rice, chow mein, rainbow sushi roll, sweet and sour chicken (not pictured), and then orange chicken.

While I was waiting for the food, I saw chef Kenny and felt star struck. I saw him walk out of the kitchen and start going around tables, and I was preparing what I was going to say. Before he got to our table all the food came at once, but he then came over and was incredibly nice and talked to us multiple times, and even took a picture with us. 

As for the food - all I can say is INCREDIBLE!!! Not only did it taste like the real deal (including the shrimp), it felt relatively light compared to most Chinese places. I left feeling perfect!!

If you're ever in Vegas, or just driving through, you can't miss this place!! You also have to go to Chef Kenny's other restaurant Vegeway, which I didn't get to try but Kenny gave me the card for it and said it's great. Amazing!!",KXwerH3YgH4QsmL-uFD4kg,1,0,5,XeKxZB3oRxSJqn5uOVwe0w

2878369,2018-06-13,0,L16ly2UGc9j4qO3Id8Gx3A,"Located right next to Greenland Supermarket on Spring Mountain we have the very well-known vegan chef, Kenny. For those who do not know chef Kenny, he owns other vegan restaurants as well. Upon walking in you are greeted with a warm welcome from the staff which is a good start to any restaurant. My family and I ordered the hot and sour soup, house special pan fried noodles, fish, roti with curry, and three different sushi rolls. I am all for trying out new things and love vegan restaurants, but this one just didn't live up to its hype. Two out of the three sushi rolls we ordered tasted the same, the only one that tasted different was the spicy tuna roll only because it had a spice factor to it. The house special pan fried noodle looked very appealing and almost looked like it wasn't vegan at all, but after trying the shrimp, beef, and chicken they all had no flavor at all which was quite disappointing. However, my favorite dish would have to be the Roti with the curry. The Roti was fluffy and the curry had potatoes inside for you to dip in. However, the staff needs to be heavily worked on. With our Roti and curry, we weren't even finished yet and they took it away assuming we were done with it without even asking. Secondly, the place is very cramped. Luckily when we went it wasn't busy, but if it was a full house then it would feel very cramped as the tables are literally one feet from the next table. I could literally touch the table next to me if I barely reached out my arm. Also, the price of the food is quite pricey as well. For three rolls, a fish, house special noodles, and roti with curry, and hot and sour soup, our total came out to be over 80 dollars. Overall this place to me is a solid 3.5 stars because of the service and pricing of the food. Will I come back? Possibly, to try their lunch special. Will I recommend this place to friends? If their service improves then most definitely I will recommend this place to my friends.",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,2,0,3,syr6yjUiHvfpIa29p80u0A

It's so delicious and the ""eel"" is made in house from mushrooms. The spicy tuna hand roll was delicious and we also enjoyed a crunch roll and dragon roll. 

The lunch specials have generous portions and come with rice. The faux meats are good. Some are breaded such as the orange chicken and others are just insane that they are even vegan (vegan shrimp!!) The Cajun shrimp is so good. Sounds weird but the flavor reminded me of flaming hot Cheetos. 

Both visits we were brought complimentary cups of cabbage soup which was simple yet delicious. I've heard good things about the ramen and curry and can't wait to try them next!",yi0nAlMG8Mg3txBek1j0sA,1,0,4,HfTJwQHly21W6bgRh8vOig

I took off a star based on the wait for our food - the food quality is way up there.  We started with a tame spring roll... nothing too exciting, but it was hot & crispy so we were happy.  The only issue was that it took 25 minutes from the time we ordered for the spring roll to arrive.  After that glitch, the rest of the meal was pretty close to perfect.  The Crunch Roll was soooo tasty, plus, if you ask for it, they do have low sodium soy sauce.  The highlight of our dinner was the Orange Beef, which is incredibly tasty and plentiful.  This dish gives vegan a new position in my life because neither the Hubby or I missed the meat.  We're fans & I hope to upgrade the stars on our next visit.

Only $8.95 for vegan main dish, rice and soup. My braised tofu and veggie was great, but I liked my husband's crispy vegan beef was better(definitely ordering for myself next time) 

Only problem was slow service. The waitress who came to take an order was pretty nice, friendly and welcoming. But the waiter who came to deliver the food was kinda shy and needed to speak up. We had no idea what he said and he acted like avoiding contact with the customers. On that day there were only 2 servers on the floor and we ended up waiting like forever for the box and check.

As we entered we were welcomed by the same staff from the the old location, it was a pleasure to see key staff have moved too. 
The food, now, started with hot n sour soup, it's a big bowl good enough for four/five people. Flavors were amazing real opener of the taste buds. This time i experienced a peppery after taste which I loved but others on the table found it spicier 
Then came the lettuce wraps, this a seriously delicious dish, lettuce was fresh n crunchy with vegan meat cooked to perfection
Then came along the sesame chicken, it was probably the last on my list. For me it's was a bit oily n lacked the spicy punch, my daughter loved it her #1 dish for the evening

He's also a much better chef and manager.  People here are happy.  The other restaurant irks me now cuz of the lack of attention to the food and service.

Old Veggie house review.
Great service, the chef is a nice and talented guy.  The vibe is relaxing and the food is delicious.  The innovative and delicious, healthy dishes blows me away every time.  Coming here for a few years after my friend first introduced me here on a whim, and I'm always finding myself wanting to come back.  I can say that these employees, AND the chef and owner himself always always go beyond excellent service.  They will greet me and all guests, along with doing so much for you.  After infrequent and spaced out visits, they seem to remember me and my friends.

If you love Chinese food, vegetarian food, or a twist on food, you'll love this place.  If you enjoy chipper employees that most Chinese restaurants lack, you'll love this place.  The vibe here is so zen!  Each time I order a dish, it never goes unfinished unless planned to be taken home from the start.  The quaint and peaceful location feels out of place from the rest of Chinatown.  This is definitely one of my favorite spots to have ever visited in all of Las Vegas.  This is an all around knock out location",NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,2,4,5,jBtvC6L5UOansSwiKO2apg

Da Food: 5/5 Food here is excellent, such delicious food! If you have ever eaten at Veggie House in China Town then this place is the better looking, taller, more successful older twin. All the good Chinese Vegan food you came to love from Veggie House is here, but they have now added vegan sushi, and it is bomb!

Da Customer Service: 5/5 Always excellent, a few of the divorce employees from Veggie house came over with Chef Kenny and service is still as awesome as ever. Super quick, vey attentive, before I even have to ask for a refill, or put my fork on the plate, they are refilling the drinks or taking the dirty dishes away. 

Da Price: 4/5 Prices are reasonable for the majority of the items. Many of the items are shareable size so it makes it a lot nicer on the wallet. My only gripe is now hot tea cost money, were before it use to come complimentary. 

Da Good: Excellent Vegan Chinese/Japanese food that is shareable and good for big groups or even one person who wants to taste it all.

Da Bad: A lot of processed ""fake"" meat, not many Veggies are used as the proteins.

Da Ugly: I wish the ""sushi"" was AYCE, 11 dollars a roll get a little expensive. 

Overall: This place is a great option for Vegan Chinese food, it has all you have come to love in Chinese food without the worries of consuming any animals. It is also excellent for groups of people, I like to take my parents and in laws here.",7KoN2yg19p6wwDg755Qtug,4,2,5,7SIrlRIX9jvGWdC8zCsELA

I'd recommend starting off your meal with some spring rolls (~$3). On my next visit I plan on trying the BBQ appetizer. Now for the main course, you MUST try the sushi. I am sold on the spicy tuna roll (~$11). My husband got the Kung Pao chicken and loved it.

We were seated right away at the most beautiful table in the room! The servers were very accommodating and the food came out really fast! Now on to the food...

The menu had a great selection of food. My boyfriend and I ordered jasmine tea, thai tea, the fried wan tons and spring rolls appetizers, the dragon roll, crunch roll, spicy tuna roll, and kung pao beef with brown rice. Everything was delicious! It is hard to choose a favorite, but if i had to pick one it would be the Spicy Tuna Roll! Sooo good! reminded me of real spicy tuna (well at least, what I remember it tasting like)! My boyfriend really enjoyed the crunchy roll and the kung pao beef (he is not vegan either)! My best friend is not a vegan but said the sweet and sour chicken was perfect! He couldn't even tell it was vegan!

Chef Kenny even came to our table to ask how we were enjoying the sushi! I felt so special. He explained how he uses guava and makes his own vegan mayo to make the sushi delicious and healthy. 

The server was very sweet and attentive; she took the time to separate our checks. She even took a group photo for us!

Everyone was nice, Chef Kenny came by to say hi and the service was exceptional. We bought the Groupon and could order anything on the menu except for the lunch special.

We ordered the Orange Chicken, rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, fried eggplant, fried rice and chocolate and strawberry ice cream.

It was all so delicious. I am sure if you brought a non vegan here, they would love it. We had so much food left over to take home which was nice for the lunch the next day.

The restaurant was also really busy and everyone seemed very happy. I can't wait to go back.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,6,3,5,AhkLA3eXontlDxo24mSddw

I had the Rainbow Roll and absolutely loved it. I also had some of the Kung Pao combo which consisted of shrimp, chicken and beef, and all of them tasted great and very much like the real thing! The lettuce wraps and spring rolls were also delicious. My only suggestions would be to add some more dessert items to the menu- vegan cakes and baked goods would be perfect! And also to serve alcohol, even just beer and wine would be great. Other than that though this place was so on point and I will definitely be frequenting it now on a regular basis.",BrKoAfW32omNcaFqW9pKsA,1,0,5,KV5qJYLwtJOb5Xx3nFyUcQ
5413093,2018-06-23,0,L16ly2UGc9j4qO3Id8Gx3A,Omg amazing!!! I have been a vegetarian for 9 years and sushi was something I really missed. We tried several nigiri rolls and cut rolls and everything was perfection. The crunchy roll and rainbow were probably my favorite. The chef came over and greeted us and is a very kind guy. We love all of his restaurants. Great job!,kliMN6j9GjLvkg-81Fb77g,1,0,5,U9CimybbQ7REJpx_mXpTVw

His new establishment  hits the mark on vegan sushi.  As I am not a fan of raw fish, the comparison is lost on me but not being a stranger to cooked and veggie rolls, this adds a new twist. Our food was explained to us in detail by our happy, smiling waitperson. Chef Kenny stopped by our table to chat and talk about his new venture. We wish him great success but that won't be necessary as the food speaks for itself. This place is on repeat for me and the Bar, who is part seal, didn't mind.",Y_JTnxZiyBx4LOzZhUrgVw,2,0,4,aDs_qvtaQ4X9anpwShIOdw

He was even out table touching when they were busy.  This is the place to go for Vegan Asian food.,uwRd0buZlfjPWbmNK7kGhQ,0,1,5,S2tLqKFuEmUM3LuUD-DQPw

They were really packed so I decided to order take out. I really don't like to leave bad reviews but the food was so disappointing. Lack of flavor and I couldn't eat the faux meat, very weird taste, also for over $50 such small portions. 2 stars because I liked the sushi (rainbow roll) and I'm glad the restaurant is vegan.",qsuwdPhk-Wq6nI5EehS-ww,3,0,3,-SV3JQI8vX5oLVS-twC1PQ

It took 20 minutes just to take our order and nothing came out together. I finished my full appetizer and lunch before her appetizer and lunch even came.  Hopefully that is one of the kinks they will fix since they are still a new place.",OQhzkmZ6AV9Oje8tgelZVA,0,0,3,ea_4A1wvsMHYS684zEHRZg

I ate at Chef Kenny restaurant four days in a row. I did not miss eating meat at all. The dishes are flavorful and varieties. There are so many choices. One on of my favorite is the Vietnamese Pho. It's so delicious that I though the vegan beef ball is a real meat. The soup base taste so fragrance and yummy. It's comes with a lot of vege.  I would recommend the vegan sushi too. I especially like the one with the kiwi fruit. It taste  little tiny sweet and sour. Is perfect combination. It comes with avocado too.  Don't miss the refreshing fruit tea. I will  be back for sure.,DFha7EXxHe3WDjQWtaiCkA,1,0,5,sHLlMvf7RglkZWYvkB2PsA
