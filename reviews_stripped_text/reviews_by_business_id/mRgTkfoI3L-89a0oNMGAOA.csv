97527,2012-12-02,1,mRgTkfoI3L-89a0oNMGAOA,"3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 because legitimate honest effort seems to indicate they'll get much better.

Located in the former Ruth's Chris location on Paradise Rd, Kelly's is in some tough company in one of the best steak cities in the country. My friends and I were excited to see how it stacked up.

Food-wise, it was mostly excellent. I'm a carnivore and I ordered a steak tartare and a prime rib. The tartare's flavour was wonderful, although the portion size was significantly smaller than what I am accustomed to. My friend ordered the French onion soup, which looked a lot more substantial. Wish I'd gotten that instead. The same friend also ordered an escargot appetizer, which was a bit of a disaster. They forgot to bring him a mini-fork, then forgot again after he'd asked. Not only that, even after procurement of said mini-fork, he was only able to extract the meat from 5 of the 7 shells. I took a crack at it myself (just being that kind of person) and gave up after another 10 minutes of poking.

To their credit, they removed the escargot from the bill. 

Oh, and they also gave us 50% off the entire bill. Apparently we'd caught the very last day of their opening week promotion. Nice!

For the most part, the food is definitely right up there with the top steakhouses in Vegas, so they've got the most important part down. There were definitely some service hiccups, these things are bound to happen when you have a new wait staff learning to work with one another. But everyone seems to be putting in a very good effort and I'm sure they'll work out the kinks. When it comes to a new place just getting its feet, attitude counts for a lot. As long as this commitment to improving service continues, Kelly's should be a solid choice for Vegas locals and regulars.",I_HmKYwFFK_0LXM5Upnf7A,7,1,4,M1p0foYEW7boP9dET2lQsQ

We waited a Kelly's for 20 minutes just for the server. No manager around. 25 minutes later our app arrived. We ordered the carpaccio and for $22 we expected our money's worth. It came out bland and the small dry pieces of white bread. Definitely not worth the money. 

Between the waiting, the lousy service, the bland food we decided to leave. This placed is way over priced for the food the are serving and are on groupon for a reason. There are much better restaurants and steakhouses in Vegas. We won't be returning or recommending this place to our friends and family.",DAkJpz7xLlxg2A7qBFxUAg,4,0,1,ifZWEprj1Z9aXOrkiEGkpw

When we called for the reservation we were told ""we have space at any time, you don't even need a reservation""  ... I should have turned back at that point!!! Here are some low lights of our dinner...

* Escargot with rancid butter - $20
* 11 dollar bottle of wine - $45
* sizzler quality steak and canned crab meat (steak Oscar) - $60
* Ok quality prime rib (40% untrimmed fat) -$50
* The mac and cheese was actually good - $10
* Re-warmed garlic mashed -$10
* Banana's foster (ok if the ice cream was not pre- melted)  - $30

I can not believe this place is still open... I feel bad for the staff because they know they are serving crap.  The hostess looked like she was called in to work between shopping at walmart and going to the gym.... The place stinks too.  They have a saucepan of onions cooking in the corner?  What kind of smell are they trying to cover with that????


I have paid over $650.00 for a dinner for 2 and felt like I got a good deal... even after the $100 gift certificate at Kelly's I felt like I was ripped off!

Got this Groupon for Fine Dining at Kelly's Prime Steak & Seafood ... When we arrived we were greeted and ask if we had reservation. We replied, ""Do we need reservations?"" He said, ""No! 'Cause no one is here, So come on in."" [FYI he was right. At 5:30 PM on a Tuesday there was no one else in the dinning room. HOWEVER, The bar was full.] We were seated, given our drinks and had our food orders taken before the next table was seated. 1ST COURSE, was Calamari. It was cook correctly and tasted divine. However, the 2 sauce that accompany this dish leave much to be desired. Sauce #1 The ""Marinara Sauce"" tasted OK but it was so thick that when you'd dipped Calamari in the crunchy bit batter was left in the sauce and I was just eating perfectly cooked but totally naked Squid. Sauce #2 The Crazy Mustard base sauce was just an epic fail and needs to be remove from the menu. 2ND COURSE, I got the Lobster Bisque and My guest got the Cesar Salad minus the anchovies. The Lobster Bisque was so salty I could not eat more then a few spoonfuls. My guest got the Cesar Salad stacked high with those DAMN ANCHOVIES. Not wanting to cause a scene we simply mentioned the mistake to the waiter and push them off to the side of the plate. My guest later commented that the Cesar Dressing tasted like they had tried to doctor up some Thousand Island Dressing and did a piss poor job of it. MAIN COURSE, my guest had the Prime Rib and I got the Beef Stroganoff. First off If you remember I mention earlier we had our order in before the next table was seated. So why did we have ask the waiter if there was a problem with our order because everyone around us was getting there food before us. At the time there was only 5 occupied tables in the whole dinning room. After a few moments the bus boy / assistant waiter finally came back with our final course. At first glance it did not look appealing but we said well maybe its okay. But HELL NO! The Beef Stroganoff was runny and had a clump of sour cream setting on top. The food was not hot or hell even warm and it did not taste like anything, and I guess Kelly's is cutting corner because for something name Beef Stroganoff it had very little beef in it. The Prime Rib was over salted and had to ask for au jus and horseradish. FYI the horseradish was a joke it had no bite. I think the cook is clearly not a Chef and needs to return back to school and learn some new technique in how to cook at a real ""Fine Dining Restaurant."" Thank God for Groupon because if I had paid the full price there would have been a problem because I would have need to act a DAMN FOOL in Kelly's Prime Steak & Seafood. I don't think I would ever return back for the food but maybe for the drinks only.

I was in town for a conference, and wanted to try some local places rather than hitting up the strip. My friend said she had heard about this place on the travel channel or something (Firefly). Upon arrival, there was a wait, and the hostess suggested getting a drink nearby. Well don't mind if I do! 

Kelly's has a lot of leather... feels pretty old school, and caters to an older crowd. There was a lounge singer and piano player on the night we visited, and a few tables of patrons but plenty of space. We were welcomed warmly by the bartender and hostess upon arrival, and seated at a booth/ table combo towards the back.

1649644,2013-06-20,3,mRgTkfoI3L-89a0oNMGAOA,"First off, let me emphasize that this review is not about the service, which is actually quite good and attentive. The hostess was very sweet. Our two waiters were on top of things from start to finish. This is a frank review of an establishment which includes the word ""prime"" in their name. ""Prime,"" as in ""superior,"" or ""top of the line.""

Kelly's is NOT ""prime."" So reel back any such expectations.

I've read that Kelly's is where Ruth Chris Steakhouse once stood. By my observations, the ownership has invested very little money into refurbishing a restaurant which shows a great deal of mileage. The carpeting is old, and while not filthy, it does show the kind of wear and tear that shampooing simply cannot remove. The entire establishment is in dire need of fresh paint. Why would anyone looking to open a new establishment skimp on such relatively inexpensive basics? 

I've read other Yelpers state that Kelly's smells of insecticide. I didn't detect any such smell, but the place does smell stale and musty (my guess is the old carpeting and interior paint are the sources). 

As for the food....just okay. We had a coupon from Travel Zoo. They honored the coupon according to the terms, but the overall quality was disappointing. The wedge salad was good, but the petite fillet mignon wasn't particularly tender. The au gratin potatoes were undercooked. I'd rate the food a B+ for quantity, but only a C for quality. And that's not ""Prime.""

This place has potential, but it's not even close to being there yet. They need to close down for 6 months or so and do it right. Right now, it's lipstick on a pig.

Pass on Kelly's until they make the necessary improvements to live up to their name (Kelly's ""PRIME"" Steak & Seafood). There are many, many better options in Las Vegas. If our party had to pay full price for this dining experience, we would've been pretty unhappy about it.",SfCTBZ0LTSpns_uB1QwGxQ,7,0,2,w-SGD6wRsJXkBTo4BCJbew

2082103,2013-07-26,3,mRgTkfoI3L-89a0oNMGAOA,"Stay as far away as you can from this place.  A Sizzler buffet is better than this place.

We were driving through Las Vegas on our way back to Southern California.  We lived in Long Beach in the 70's and through friends had heard that the present owner of Kelly's in Naples/Long Beach was opening up a Kelly's here.  We were frequent patrons of Kelly's during the 70's and were excited to find a quality place off the strip (so we thought).

What a shame that this guy doesn't have the class that the Long Beach Kelly's has.  I don't know who he is, but the logo/signage is the same.  NOTHING at all like the Kelly's in Long Beach.  But I have now heard that the Long Beach Kelly's has closed due to mismanagement and if this is the same guy (who I am told it is) this place won't be around much longer as well.  It is an insult to the Long Beach Kelly's of the quality years.

We came on a Friday night about 7pm.  We used to dine here when this was a Ruth's Chris so we new the location well.  We did not make a reservation as we had plenty of time and thought we would enjoy sitting at the bar with our martinis.

There were only two other tables occupied when we were greeted by the hostess.  That should have been the second clue right then.

We were seated right away. Martinis were ordered and served.  Perfect drink.  The waiter was very personable.

We ordered Caesar salads, a lobster bisque,rib eye and peppercorn steak, both medium rare.  The Caesar salad was tasteless and over dressed.  The salad plate was not cold.  The lobster bisque was thick and gloppy and not hot.  When the steaks arrived, they were also lukewarm and OVERDONE.  We didn't dare send it back because it wasn't hot because we would have had shoe leather!

I won't even comment on the dismal wine list.  We were told that two of our selections were out of stock, so we just stuck with another martini each!

During the time we were seated only three other parties arrived in the dining room.

I have seen that they are offering coupons. I'm sure that is the only way that they can get patrons in.  We definitely won't be coming back here.",MKRALOUWUsAm9zjWTQN1zA,8,2,1,Mq8gz3-mLisT8qI5yynj2A

Food: Honey ordered the salmon and said it was very good and I had the med size cut of prime rib which was more than enough for a guy with a hearty appetite, but tasted just average at best. We each had a salad and shared a bottle of wine & two sides. The asparagus was a bit overcooked and the Irish white cheesy potatoes were bland.

Even though our server was attentive, my lasting impression of this restaurant will be of the little things. I've been to dozens of 4+ star restaurants to celebrate special occasions, some offer customized desserts to the guest of honor, but nothing here. Not even a HBD acknowledgement from the host or server.

We started with a bottle of wine (not included in Groupon). They had a fantastic selection. Unfortunately, they did not have our selection. The GM gave us a similar bottle at he same price, so no issues. 

First course: calamari. Delicious. Very light and crispy. No complaints. 

Second course:  Caesar salad/ French onion soup. My salad was huge and very tasty. I actually didn't finish it because it was so big. My husband loved his soup. He says the favors and textures were all well balanced. 

Third course:  prime rib. We enjoy a good steak and this did not disappoint. Well seasoned, generous cuts of beefy goodness. 

Side dish:  twice baked potato. I want to give this good reviews, but I never ate any. It was cold the first time it came out and not hot he second time. By the time he second one came out, we were full, so we decided to take it home.

For starters, when we walked into the restaurant we got hit with such a weird smell. It was like a cross between mothballs and burnt wood. The building looked really old, and the inside was clearly outdated. They obviously didn't change a thing when they opened. Their leather menus have the name ""Kelly's"" in bright neon.. Well actually Kelly green.. The K is backwards and there's a shamrock on the menu. This can be really misleading from the outside, because it looks and sounds like an Irish pub, not a steakhouse. 

They have live entertainment from 6-10PM daily. Their idea of entertainment is an older man singing terribly to his piano. I joked with my husband and told him that I felt like I was in a nursing home. 

For apps we ordered the steamed Manila clams. I hated them, the sauce was really salty and it tasted like a wine infused BBQ sauce. 

In hopes that it would get better we both had the lobster bisque to follow. Again--- overly salty and the bisque tasted like it came from a can. It does come with a generous scoop of lobster though. 

At this point, I was just looking forward to our steak. It arrived quickly. The waiter said they marinate them in a nice mixture of oils, salt, pepper etc. He proudly boasted that the steaks were high quality.... they weren't good :-( I love filet mignon. Matter of fact, Ive never had a bad steak night in Vegas, until now! 

We also ordered their garlic mashed potatoes, truffled corn and creamed spinach. I'm absolutely sure that they use an instant mashed potato and just add a few fresh potatoes. The consistency was so gritty, you could just tell. The corn did not have truffle oil, or truffle anything. It was creamed corn with a breadcrumb crust on top. As for the spinach, it was watery, not seasoned and undercooked. 


I've never had a dinner in a restaurant where every aspect of the meal was this bad. This place will not survive with Mortons around the corner and Del Friscos across the street. 


Pros:
-The server was so nice, very attentive without being overbearing.

The house wine and well drinks were half price $4 and $3.50.  The bar menu was also half price!

My hub had a glass of wine which was the Kenwood Cab, decent... I had a bourbon Manhattan (in honor of our friend!) and it was great and impressive for $3.50!

For food we ordered fish and chips $8 and caprese salad  $6.  I mainly ate the salad and it was excellent.  Thick slices of mozerella and heirloom tomatoes.  One of the tomatoes was green and ruffled, gorgeous and delicious!  I joked with the bartender that I got a green tomato and he explained they were heirloom LOL, got him!  The hub really liked the fish and chips.  Huge pieces of fish batter fried and tasted like beer batter.  The fries were great too.  I kinda wish I tried the prime rib sandwich since we were at a steakhouse and all but def next time!

The bartender was very accomdating and friendly.  He had no problem serving us in the comfy lounge area where we were sitting and he never neglected us.  It probably helped that there were not very many people in the place and the ones there already were in full swing of HH.

The lounge area was very comfortable, upscale and we really enjoyed going to a place for drinks that was quiet and relaxing, unlike the Strip.

Salmon was decent and the steak appetizer was also alright.

Dinner and dessert fiasco was done by 10pm but we didn't get our check until 10:30pm (that was because I walked up to the host and asked him to get us our check)...  that totally pissed me off because there were only 2 other tables in the room with customers..

Extremely overpriced, especially given that it's off the strip. 
The food is forgettable and the wine selection is deeply uninspired.

The decor is fine albeit typical, and the service is well-intentioned, but this place is out of its league here.

Del Frisco's is right across the street, and although I'm not a huge fan of theirs (unlike so many other yelpers....go figure)....Del Frisco's is a significantly better steakhouse than Kelly's.

In the Darwinian jungle of Las Vegas restaurants, I suspect Kelley's won't survive.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,7,1,1,jtL28taXuRiQMenI4Nz6Vg

There was 1 customer in the huge dining room. We sat at the bar and our bartender was the highlight of the evening, super friendly. We both had the filet and it was very good. The ""twice baked potato"" was obviously thawed from a box and was worthy of the trash. I'd say we'd possibly go back but I am pretty certain it will be out of business in the next 2-3 months.",kWvLJBYMh6WTBTXHwpLQ6Q,1,1,2,wQTd8BGTAem9VGZS9qytTw

We shared a Caesar salad, which our waiter recommended, so we each got our own plate and it was delicious. My fiance got the New York steak and I got the Rib-eye, with a side of loaded baked potato and twice baked potato. Our steaks came out still sizzling, they were cooked perfectly and both were juicy and tender, we didn't even need any sauce because the flavor was just amazing. Our sides were delicious and the portions are huge, we even had enough leftovers for a steak and egg breakfast the next day. The place is pretty upscale, the staff is extremely attentive and friendly, and there was a guy playing the piano, which made it a nice experience. Definitely a great place to go for special occasions. Also, we went on Friday night with a reservation and had no issues waiting for our food, we were in an out in just over an hour.",Fo4tbu1fEmEAB5A7t2t4ZA,1,0,5,xyZlixlAQlM5-c-xsSVC3A

Reservations - Not required.  Hardly anyone was there on a Friday night.

Location - The old Ruth Chris location.  About a $12 cab ride from the strip.

Food - When you charge this much for a steak and advertise yourself as a fine dining steakhouse, at the very least, your steaks should be cook perfectly. Everything was undercooked which is a bad sign.
1. French Connection Escargot -  The escargot was tender but swimming in a pool of  cream and butter.  Very bland as if they forgot all the other seasonings.
2. Kelly's Cut Prime Rib - Undercooked and overly salty without adding any au jus. I ordered mine medium rare but the dish came out rare.  Horseradish was a joke and had no bite.  Yorkshire pudding was good and had a great crust.
3. Ribeye Steak - Again medium rare steak came out a fleshy rare. Seasoned well but did not come with any sauce as promised.
4.  Irish White Cheddar Potatoes Au Gratin - Watery and bland.",A9AM8NH3ToduRvYDvDSADA,2,0,2,-eqcn-llnzXKDFH97xkpRg

I used the $75 Groupon that covered a starter, 2 salads/soups, 2 entrees, a side to share and 2 desserts. Asked for a medium cooked Filet Mignon and very clearly was given rare/seared. Mediocre steak and quality, would not go again and that showed! Seating for at least 250 and there was about 15 people on a Saturday at 7pm.",x6hyJl9iTbYJV5x6y5N4Ag,1,0,2,WuR0z4LL6nZlhS9cE0R-Gw
5778789,2013-08-28,5,mRgTkfoI3L-89a0oNMGAOA,"Like most everyone else that ends up here, I had a Groupon - it was a really good deal and I figured how bad could it be? So we walked in w low expectations, hoping to be (pleasantly) surprised. I'll say it was probably worth the $75 Groupon deal, but we still wont be back and I'd honestly be pissed if I had paid full price ($172). 

so I guess this place closed temporarily and just reopened w all new staff. the menu is also slightly reduced from what's on their website. no more escargot, bananas foster, some of the salads.

Calamari was pretty good, but that's pretty hard to eff up. French onion soup was inedibly salty, lobster bisque wasn't bad - lots of lobster bits w the soup poured table side. Prime rib was decent, my rib eye was ordered medium, but arrived well done. They brought a new one out pretty quickly, probably because this one was way rare. I was debating whether to just eat it (figured they would overcook it again) but the waiter saw how raw it was and took it back. It came out close enough to medium - seasoned fine, I liked the charred bits. Definitely not ""prime"" quality like the name says, but the steak was ok. Creme brulee was standard, their apple strudel wasn't at all strudel and it sucked w mushy overcooked apples and way too sweet crust. 

Server was just ok, but I loved the busser Vladimir - he was super nice and attentive the entire time. My friend drinks water like a mofo and his glass was never even half empty. 

So... yeah I wont be back, but I guess it was worth the $75 for 1 appetizer, 2 soups, 2 entrees, 2 desserts. + we left $35 tip (off $172 original total) and Groupon had $10 off purchases over $30. So having spent a total $110 w tip and a cocktail is fair. 

I agree w everyone else - this place won't be around much longer so if you get the Groupon, use it quick. and it does have a really odd smell - it wasn't really insecticide like others said. We couldn't decide what it was and the people next to us asked, the manager said it was Rosemary. no clue wtf it was, but it wasn't effen Rosemary",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,8,4,2,rkjWD1vuF1aSON2PXrunrQ
5837966,2013-09-11,2,mRgTkfoI3L-89a0oNMGAOA,"I know this restaurant has received very mixed Yelp reviews.  But the one night I was there with wife and friends, it was a very enjoyable and tasty experience.  

A Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail obtained at no charge through a Yelp check in featured very good truly jumbo-sized White Mexican Prawns with thick classic Cocktail Sauce; and a crock of French Onion Soup was robust, laden with melting Gruyere Cheese, and also very good.  A Caesar Salad with requested anchovies was good but did not particularly stand out.  But the well-seasoned Petite Filet that arrived sizzling in butter and perfectly medium rare as ordered most definitely did.  And, Shrimp Scampi was fine, with the individual shrimps dancing on the plate in an excellent-tasting sizzling Lemon Butter Sauce.

Very cheesy Au Gratin Potatoes were simply great, and nicely turned out hand-cut, skin-on French Fries not far behind.  In the negatives column, steak knives with worn wooden handles made the restaurant look dated, detracting from an otherwise classy steakhouse ambiance--and the dining room was unusually dark; complimentary bread was rather pedestrian; and my first glass of Iced Tea was viscous and oily.  

Service was very good throughout the duration of the multi-course meal, and dinner culminated with superior Apple Streudel accompanied by Vanilla Ice Cream.  

Based on this experience I will surely return!

4-1/2 stars overall this night",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,3,4,NogTdS7OR0_3xBBy6xCt6A
