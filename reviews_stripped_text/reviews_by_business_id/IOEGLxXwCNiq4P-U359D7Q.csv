The ingredients all are good quality and it's cooked east coast style, so the crust is not too thick or thin.  Couple of other New York style places on the far west side in Summerlin, but this one is definitely better.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.  Also, the girl who took my order was friendly and competent and the delivery guy was courteous and friendly.",INbqkFXtHeCdEP_wPp2dUA,1,1,5,S_kC_mBGU2mRxiE5aAA_iQ

We had the White Pie and a order of wings which I liked that you put the sauce on them by putting them in a bag with the sauce you want and shake it up. 

After we finished out dinner we tried the Maple Mascarpone Cheesecake, I hoped nobody had seen me lick the bowl it came it.

165820,2012-09-17,3,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"We were excited to try a new pizza place, even more so when we heard it was from the same guys at Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. Really wanted to like this place, but it was not meant to be. The mishaps started when we tried to call ahead for pickup. The first time we called it went to a voicemail box after several rings with no way to leave a message (not that we would anyway). We double checked that the number was correct and that they should be open. The same thing happened with the second call. I don't know what possessed us to try yet again, but the third time our call was answered. Not an auspicious start... What a great way to lose a lot of potential business from less tenacious, potential customers.

We ordered the Italian white pizza ($22) and a spinach salad ($7) and were told it would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived about 35 minutes later and was told my order was not quite ready yet. As I was paying for my order, I noticed that they were just putting my pizza into the oven. WTH? Really? I guess that's a new personal first... When we get pizza from anywhere else, we are told 20 minutes (sometimes 30 minutes if it's prime time on Fri night), and when we show up it is usually ready or occasionally comes out of the oven a couple minutes after arrival. Here, I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for the pizza to be cooked and then another 5 minutes of so for them to construct the spinach salad. So basically, it took another 15 minutes after I arrived for my order to be ready for a total time of 50 minutes from when I called. It should go without saying that it shouldn't take 50 minutes to prepare your take-out pizza order. Even if that was acceptable, they shouldn't tell you 30 minutes, only for you to show up and wait significantly longer. It wasn't like they were busy. I was the only customer there until this other guy showed up to pick up his pizza which they just started to put in the oven as I was leaving. I guess I'm not the only one...

We were hoping that after all this, at least the food would be worth the wait. Not by a long shot... Although it smelled pretty good, the pizza crust was undercooked so we stuck it in the oven for another 5 minutes. Despite this, the pizza crust was quite soggy in the middle and pretty greasy throughout. The broccoli rabe topping was tough, and the homemade sausage was nothing special. My wife commented that she would rather have Dom DeMarco's pizza, and she doesn't even like their pizza! Of note, they included tiny containers of red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan which was a nice touch. The spinach salad was even more disappointing. It was lined with an anemic pita (not included in the salad description) and contained a relatively small amount of wilted, soggy spinach dressed with some bacon lardons, goat cheese, and candied almonds.

We'll be sticking with our tried and true, Rocco's Pizza, where the crust is cooked properly, it's not too greasy, the toppings taste better, it's ready in 20 minutes, and it even costs less ($18). Sorry, Those Guys Pies. I just tell it how it is, and you've got a long way to go.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,8,3,2,1HC-jO242vNehg0showsCQ

I find this odd as i never get the vegetables and it wasnt that small before. They offered to remake it but I am not even able to get there my friend had picoed it up for me and i am not interested in ordering here ever again.

Saw this joint on DDD, I finally committed to drive out to west bum excited to try this place out. Heading back to Southern Cal from Utah the place is not close to the route home, but today was the day my son and I stepped up.

It's small,  a couple tables, geared for take out local.  Having been on the road I had to pee and they don't have bathroom, frustrating.   

To be fair, the  food is better than 2 stars but service and the mistakes made me rank it 2 stars overall.  

After waiting several minutes (Ignored) at the register to order. I ordered a small cheese pizza and a chicken fingers hoagie (Sub) it comes with lettuce, tomato and mayo, I added and paid extra for provolone. After a long wait, They had  burnt the first pizza (more wait) and had to cook another one. We got a plain cheese and It ended up tasting good.  After a wait, my sub showed up with no mayo, no cheese. It came dry with lettuce and ??? sun dried tomatoes??? I gave up, waited for the pizza and ate my sub asking for a side of mayo to spread myself. I let the cheese go and picked out the dry tomatoes.

531180,2014-01-24,0,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"I lived in Boston for 18 years before moving to Las Vegas.  I had my favorite pizzeria, a spot in Brighton Corner.  It didn't look like anything special.  But sit at one of the cheap formica tables a while & you might notice the Italian newspapers strewn about, then that the gentlemen behind the counter are all speaking Italian.  What the place lacked in fancy decor it more than made up for with authenticity.

And my point, you ask?  I have really high standards for my pizza.  I signori at Brighton Corner made the best red sauce I've ever tasted and used a pepperoni that was like no other.  For years in Vegas, I looked for pizza that was 80% as good.  Then I gave up &  looked for pizza that was half as good.  Still nothing, until I discovered Those Guys.

No, neither their red sauce nor their pepperoni are as good as i signori, but they're reasonably close.  And Those Guys' crust is actually better.  It's a big plus that Those Guys make their own sausage, meatballs, and even smoke their own bacon.  Also, TG makes a cheesesteak with the best quality beef you'll ever find in a hoagie.

Despite the 20-minute drive, I go to Those Guys fairly often (once every couple of weeks).  It's a bit of a distance to go for pizza, but it's a lot closer than Brighton Corner.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,3,1,5,tUw3A_mzrRLRVgY0wpLRxA

Well, the pepperoni pizza, cheesesteak and veggie sandwich was delicious....and no I did not eat all this myself. I use to think Caps had the best cheesesteak for Vegas....NO MORE!

i ordered the ""shroom"" pizza on white (white means the fact that there is no pizza sauce, just a combination of garlic oil and ricotta cheese), to add at least SOME health aspects, i added artichokes to the pie, this is what i got.

an aroma that wafted onto my palate way before the box was even opened. aside from the fact that it was covered with cheeses (ricotta and mozzarella) the crust was actually edible, not like many pizza crusts, that get tossed to the wayside because they are too tough, hard, or doughy, this crust was just what a pizza crust should be, slightly crunchy on the outside, and slightly doughy and chewy on the in.

the only problem i have was that even though the pizza was laden, the toppings were slim...that and they forget to send me a menu.

personally can't wait for the next rainy day as an excuse to avoid cooking and order a pizza from them again.",i3fzFrfaq5v5p4OEiJzNHQ,1,1,4,3yiV2rfZv1bx2gpLqfOk4Q

I've been looking forward to trying Those Guys because of all these good reviews. I had a ""buy 1, get 1"" coupon so I figured that was a bonus! 

The shop is small and hidden and the employees were friendly enough, but the pizza did not live up to the 4 stars it gets here on yelp. We ordered 2 pies: the ""Shroom"" and the ""Spicy Red Italian"". They were ready in about 20 minutes.

I always make sure I try a slice before I get home because a 15-20 minute drive can do terrible things to a pizza and I want an honest ""out of the oven"" opinion. We found a spot outside and opened the boxes only to find two very wet looking pies. I tried picking up a slice and it was so limp I basically ended up with a handful of toppings and grease. I had to fold it in half and even then, the tip had to be folded up into the middle of the slice. I ended up sucking out the ingredients like pizza soup.

Taste-wise, it wasn't too bad and the ingredients seemed fresh but the crust could not stand up to them. It was a very messy situation. If I hadn't had the 2 for 1 coupon I would have been really upset as those two pies would have run me about $45. Seriously? I've worked in a pizza shop before so I know pizza doesn't have to cost that much.

I seem to be in the minority here but I definitely won't be rushing back to Those Guys any time soon. There are much better options out there.",J3CUnbo1nu34RQJA1KHnwQ,0,0,2,NW6AppINJlX3d0Ky8IQREw

Big pizza joints on the strip, downtown, etc...close your doors. You can't hold a candle to what they produce at Those Guys Pies.

Second time was way more recent, still couldn't decide on what to eat, and ordered it on yelp to pick up after i swung by my friends house to pick up something. 

Yelp/GrubHub or w/e the service is to order through yelp, had estimated it to be like 50-60 minutes before I get my order. I had originally called and wanted to cancel the order if the wait was that long because i was trying to swing by and get it on the way home. Whoever had picked up the phone had told me it was going to take like 15 minutes. Oh? Nice ! And off to the restaurant i went to pick up. 

This restaurant is located in northeast-ish side of 'The Lakes'. It's midly hidden even in the shopping center it is in. Since i was like 5 minutes away, i sat at the restaurant maybe 10 minutes before i got my pizza. Fairly on point with the estimation ! Thanks ! The restaurant itself is really small. Maybe room for i think like 2 tables and some chairs. Rest of it was the kitchen. 

So onto the food. Both times i had gotten the ""Italian White Pie"" that is listed under their 'Specialty House Pie' category. The Italian White Pie includes ricotta, mozzarella, broccoli rabe, sausage, garlic, and carmelized onions on a white pizza. What makes it a white pizza is not using the ""usual"" tomato sauce but a white cream sauce, probably similar to like an alfredo sauce. cream and cheese based. 

The first time i got the 'Italian White Pie', it was awkwardly mildly too salty. Which was surprising for a pizza. I decided to give it another try and this time, it was PERFECT ! Crust was nice and thin but crispy. Good amounts of ricotta and mozzarella which gave it a nice amount of creaminess and cheesiness. The sausage was thinly cut so you get more then a pebble worth on each slice. Carmelized onions add such a nice savoriness and sweetness overall. Next time something i'd change is EXTRA GARLIC ! yeah i just love garlic. why not have more garlic?! mmm hehe maybe the onions too. The broccoli rabe adds a nice green color and a ""crispness"" to it all aside from the crust, since everything else was nice and soft. 

The italian white pie is just so good, i dont know if i can try anything else. I just love everything about it ! Maybe if they can throw on some peppers to give it a nice spicy kick, then it would be 100%",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,x5yyQ6OlDvewSoP5XgEMCw

(It's a pick-up/delivery kinda place.) Super nice guy working, very pleasant. The storefront was very clean and our order was ready as promised. The counter guy said business was picking up, which is good for such an out of the way place.

We ordered the 'Big Sexy' pizza the cheesesteak with extra onions and the cinnamon poppers (spelled that way on the menu). I'll keep this short; the cheesesteak was super dry and hardly an onion was to be found and the roll was a couple of days old. The pizza was 'ok' the edge of the crust was good but the rest was greasy and soggy....way too thin is the problem. The sauce and meatball slices were good.
The poppers were ok for 5 bucks, kinda tough but ok. I make zeppoli at home and thought these would be just as tender. Not. 

For the money I'll stick to Rocco's or Metro as for the cheese steaks I'll drive cross town to Geri's or around the corner to Cappriotti's. I'm from South Philly which means nothing.

Add on some tomato slices or shredded cheese, again it needs more oomph and less lettuce I literally felt like I paid $10 for a box full of lettuce and a piece of chicken sliced up.

We ordered an 18"" white pizza, and an 18"" meat lovers pizza. I was impressed they had artichokes - so I asked if our pizza can have artichokes instead of bacon. They said cool, so I was very happy about the easiness of substituting one item.

We get home, and we find out that we received 2 of the White Pizzas. I LOVE white pizza - my kids despise it. I usually take a peek at the pies before bringing them home, but I failed to do so this time.

I made a phone call to Those Guys. Unfortunately, I live 15-20 minutes away and was not going to drive back to show them the pizzas. I tried explaining we have 2 of the same pizzas - I am looking right at them. I tasted a slice from each. They look the same, taste the same - and the person on the phone insists I have 2 different pizzas. 

Being a 42 year old Long Island born and raised boy, I kinda know my way around pizza. I promise if a pizza had pepperoni or artichokes on it, I would know it even if I was blind.

I am ok with the Pizza. I would give the pizza 3 1/2 stars of 5. I can appreciate that the pizza tastes like a decent pie. It is middle of the road for quality. When a pizza is wrong, I have no choice but to deduct points. When I am told I have the correct pizza in front of me and it is not, I have to deduct for that also.

I took pictures of both pizzas, and if I can figure out how to add them to this review, they will shown here in just a bit.

The Greek was the best out of the two pies we ordered, because the sauce and toppings all worked well together. However the Italian White pie was just not to our taste.

I was looking to try something new than your standard pizza chains, so I searched Yelp.  The first place that appeared was Those Guys Pies.  So I read some reviews, looked at the menu, and decided to try them.  I was not let down!

I ordered the ""Big Pie"" Meat Pie, which was excellent!  The meatballs are sliced in a way that makes the meatball slices bigger than most places Pepperoni.  Not only that, but they taste great as well.  The bacon was tasty and not ""fatty"" like regular bacon can be.  And for the size of the pizza, it was worth the price!

I also ordered a ""Regular Pie"" custom because they have a pizza sauce that I had to try: Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce.  First off, the Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce is awesome!  It gives a nice burn without overpowering the pizza taste.  I added meatballs, pepperoni, and broccoli rabe to this pizza, to go with the sauce.  Everything went well with the ingredients.  If I have one issue with this pizza, is that it could have used a bit more sauce (only because I loved the sauce).

Their cheesesteak (which I ordered with ribeye, onions and white american cheese) is one of the better cheesesteaks I have had.  Very tasty with the right amount of cheese and meat.  The bread was soft in the middle and has a nice crust, without the hardness that is found on the ends of a lot of french bread.

I also tried the 3 cheese fries, which was interesting because of the cheeses used.  I'm not sure which cheeses were on it, but I'm guessing it was whiz, mozzarella, and cheddar?  Even still, the fries were tasty and filling...a meal unto itself!

The price is a bit higher than standard pizza chains, but for the quality of the pizza, the cheesesteaks and the ingredients, it is well worth the money.  Plus, the one dollar delivery fee was a plus!   I can definitely recommend Those Guys Pies, and will order again soon!

Oh, and to Those Guys Pies...do NOT get rid of the Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce!  That stuff is so delicious!!",xVA0VhGnf0dBjP9K6FgK9w,0,0,5,fxx8DF1YZ84-Su8a2RUVjA

The cheesesteaks here are almost good enough to say Pop's who? Almost. The meat is quality and they aren't shy with it. Using cheese whiz never hurt anybody either! I recommend trying the cheesesteak before anything else. I still need to try a pizza that is more my style with sausage and peppers but my wife ordered a white pie that I gave into and tried a slice of. It wasn't bad, just not my personal favorite toppings for a pizza. The crust on it was good. The mozzarella sticks are made fresh and by hand to order. They have a good amount of gooey cheese and cooked perfectly. My 2nd visit I also tried the 3 cheese fires which looked much better than they sounded and tasted. The fries were cooked right but I would just want cheese whiz on them next time and not the other cheeses. I do wish they had better signage out front. I had a bit of a time finding it and at this time anyway there is nothing on the building saying who they are like the neighboring business in the center.

We ordered online for our office. Mistake number 1. Apparently if you order before they open they app pushes it to the next day. So we call and when speaking to the females the manager persists to call us young ladies in a condescending matter and argue with us when we try to find out where our food is.  If your website is crap maybe fix it. He even called one of the people back to continue argue how he is right and she is wrong. Try to learn customer service. This is not how business is done. If there is an issue on your end don't blame the customer do not get nasty and do not be condescending. Their food isn't good enough to deal with such crappy service.

The ""Big Sexy"" comes with sausage, pepperoni, garlic, onion and pepperoncini. The ""White Pie"" comes with ricotta, mozzarella and garlic. 

I enjoyed the pizza a lot. The slices are huge which makes the very tip of them flimsy when you hold it by the crust and try eating it. The crust was great. My girlfriend loved the White Pie and we would both order from here again.

Our Big Pie with half Big Sexy and half White Pie came out to $23.50.",Wzl9iQmj5Dy7YdQKXivTAw,1,0,4,jKRQo-FA31Fk361PgIX-bw

I was going to save the pizza review for last because I thought it was the best thing on the menu. But, after tonight's surprise cheesesteak, I'm torn. The pizza, for us, was the main draw. It's virtually perfect. The crust is thin, crispy but with that little bit of chew. The toppings are unlike any other pizza joint...they house make the bacon, the sausage & the meatball. HOUSEMADE  PEOPLE, HOUSE MADE! An Italian white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta & broccoli rabe, who else is making a takeout/delivery pizza at that caliber? It's takeout pizza on a whole other level. 
Now, on to the cheesesteak. We're west coast people, born & raised in San Diego and  we just never quite got the craze for cheesesteak. It's good, but we've never been wowed. Well, last night we were sent home from Those Guys Pies with an original cheesesteak. Ribeye. Onions. American Cheese. Cheesewhiz. It blew us away. It was perfection. It wasn't just a cheesesteak, it was an experience! The reason we weren't ""cheesesteak people"" is because we had never had a real cheesesteak done right.

We ordered a half Shroom and half Spicy Italian pie with a side of wings (with the Wasabi Ranch and Garlic Parm dipping sauces).  Due to the limited seating, he suggested that we sit by the lake, which had a great view.  Once we received our order, we dug right in.  The first bite was so yummy and full of gooey cheesy mushroom goodness.  The wings were nice and crispy.  We both enjoyed the Wasabi Ranch very much; the ranch actually made for an excellent dip for the pizza crust as well.

But, if I were to do it again, I would order a large pizza, put it in the fridge for 2 hours, and heat up individual slices on aluminum foil (or a pizza stone) for 5 minutes at 475*F.

Not all pizza reacts this way. But real NJ/NY pizza does. (This is meant to be a compliment to Those Guys Pies.)

The interior of the shop is cozy with only a few tables.  Its mostly kitchen, but since he makes all his sauces in house I didn't mind at all.  The first trip we ordered the BBQ Maui Wowie pizza, that was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives with Guy Fieri. My wife ordered the chicken Parm Sandwich.  Everything was made to order from the stretching of the dough, to the hand cut and breaded chicken.  We engaged in a great conversation with the co-owner Roy, and got to hear about his culinary ladder he climbed and how started Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, to where he is today being his own boss.  Amazing guy.

It didn't take long for our food to arrive. Both our pizza and sandwich were piping hot out of the oven.  Upon first bite of the pizza, it was like a flavor explosion with the 50/50 tangy BBQ/pizza sauce, the little heat from the pickled jalapeno, the sweet of the pineapple, and the savory of the pulled pork, and the saltiness from the bacon. MMMMM, it is what pizza dreams are made of.  Her sandwich was amazing as well with the toasted sub roll, pizza sauce, and melty cheese.  The chicken itself was very tasty due the amazing breading.

The second time, she got the chicken parm again, but I got the original cheesesteak with onions, and white american.  The cheesesteak was one of the best i've had with great seasoned meat and the toasted roll. And her chicken parm was amazing again.

We will definitely be back the next time we are in town. Thanks to Roy and his crew for the awesome stories, and the amazing food.",16WQ0DK1X6VGeWMElPnLQQ,1,0,5,VkBWGyM29HTiVR8etK3A1w

The pizza was really good, my boyfriend was obsessed! It was a little cold because of our drive home but still awesome. I can't wait to try one of their specialty pizzas next time! The buffalo chicken sandwich was definitely good, but a little dry- there wasn't much sauce. The works was probably the BEST Philly cheese steak I've ever had in my life. The three cheese fries were also good, but definitely don't recommend getting them if you have a long drive home... They were a bit soggy and cold by the time we got home.

Pizza and wings it was with our Yelp poppers, I'm craving it now.  I had a cold piece of the pizza today for lunch two day old and it still satisfied every taste bud! Cold or hot the sauce and crust make it. Not too greasy either. Their wings are flavorful with any sauce and full of meat! The don't come with sauce on but rather give you sauce and a bag to toss yourself.  Our order was take out which I guess most are since there's maybe three tables inside.

So I went on yelp and decided to try Those Guys. I ordered a regular pepperoni pizza and the cheese fries. The guy on the phone was very nice and courteous, and told me it would take 35 minutes for delivery. Honestly it came before the 35 minutes, which made me really happy. And let me tell you, if one of my friends tried Those Guys and didn't like it, I would look at my friend differently from then on, secretly of course, but different nonetheless. I vow to never eat at another pizza place again! even if they give me a life time of pizza. Also can't deny Hottie McHotterson the delivery guy (too much? Sorry) I finished the pizza by myself by the next morning, and I'm ordering the same thing again two days later. Next time (probably in a few days) im going to try the white pizza. Ugh I'm in love.

The Diablo would have been amazing if they hadnt drenched it in that sweet chili sauce on top, there was just way way too much on it, it was all that was tasted, it was like eating candied pizza... Ick! The Big Sexy.. well it was actually just weird.  have had a similar pizza (same toppings) from another place and liked it, but TGP they put their onions on in HUGE slices, it was all that could be tasted. It wasnt as bad as the Diablo, but It wasnt amazing either. I will probably be passing on their pizza in the future.

The second time I ordered I got Chicken fingers, and 3 cheese fries.. The fries were AMAZING, I mean the cheese was hardish when it got here as it cooled, but they are still great, especially with ranch (not theirs) drizzled all over them mmm. The Chicken Fingers were just nasty. They were big which is nice, but super salty. I mean overly salty, the breading was weird, I LOVE chicken fingers and this is the first time Ive ever passed on them. Their ranch is just weird tasting, its like... they mixed Mayo and Ranch together, luckily I had some in the fridge for the fries.

I really liked the slices they served but they were not served hot and I quickly forgot about them. I was finally able to try their pie right out of their Lakes location and man, have I been missing out. 

My husband and I ordered a half Maui Wowie(bacon, pineapple and jalapeños) and half pepperoni pie to split. A few minutes of waiting and it came piping hot, straight out of the oven. The crust was absolute perfection when it came to taste and texture. The sauce is really good and a nice amount that doesn't overpower the other ingredients. It's also not overly tart like some pizza sauces I've tried. The pepperoni topping was really good but pretty standard but the bacon on the Maui wowie was excellent. It was large crispy bacon, not the canadian bacon you see at other pizza joints. I only wish there was more of this yummy porky goodness on the pie.

The store was small and easy to miss because it still didn't have overhead signage. There's a small counter to order from, a couple of chairs and a table which was overtaken by bags of condiments. This is a takeout place. There are no heat lamps at this joint. Call ahead or order your pie fresh and wait. Take the pie home, eat in your car or find an empty table by the fake lake nearby. They also provide a delivery service within 5 miles but I suggest coming down to say hi and experience the pizza hot out of the oven. It's totally worth it.

Although we are slightly out of their delivery range, they let us know they'll deliver to us during slower periods (which is super nice of them), but we also have just picked-up here as well. When they have delivered, they did so in a timely manner and food was still fresh. I'm a big fan of their ooey-gooey but still crispy cheese fries, but their Philly cheesesteak just wasn't for me (meat wasn't seasoned well).

As someone from the city that made cheesesteaks famous - I've had my fair share of good steaks and bad both in Philadelphia and outside of Philadelphia.

While I don't think these were the best steaks that I've ever had - they are definitely one of the better cheesesteaks in Vegas AND they come TRUE to form ... (American, Provolone, or Whiz) and with or without fried onions ... NO GREEN PEPPERS in the equation.    There is adequate high quality meat, chopped correctly, cheese incorporated correctly and great bread (even though it's not Amoroso's) ... but anyone from Philly knows that a good cheesesteak does not have to have an Amoroso roll.

We ordered cheese fries with whiz as well and although I loved the fact that I was able to get fries - I didn't like that they were seasoned fries.  I'd much prefer a standard plain fry that is a little thicker with cheese on top.

To begin the place is so small there is only two tables to sit at. The over all appearance is not very clean or organized. You are not greated as you walk in and almost not even noticed. Had to get up and waited about 5 minutes before someone finally came to take my order. They offer no fountain drinks but bottled so you end up spending more than expected. My son needed to use the restroom and was told we had to go to another restaurant down the way to use their bathroom... How ridiculous! Once receiving the food the fingers were great but the pie was soaked in grease and just did not look anything worthy of being on DDD. To then encounter no cups for my kids to share a bottled drink, no silverware to cut up smaller slices definitely ruined the experience even more. Was not impressed with the pie at all due to lack of flavor and the crust was burnt. I will not be back to try and have them redeem themselves at all. The only perks of my visit was the some what friendly service we received even though I had to get everything I needed. Also, received a discount for being military. We did notice that if you become regulars you receive your meals for free. Witnessed twice between two different customers. I guess that's a perk if you choose to continue to go back.

The pizza I always go with is the Diablo pizza. It's got a ghost pepper sauce as the base, banana peppers, jalapeños, pepperoncinis, and sweet chili as toppings. It's really not that spicy, but I suppose that's not saying much as I order my Thai food at an 8 for mild spice. Either way, if you're a spicy food fanatic you need this in your life. 

The chicken tenders are HUGE, panko breaded, and fried fresh to order. It takes a few extra minutes when picking it up but it's so worth it! The chicken is piping hot and juicy. They have creative dipping sauces such as pineapple buffalo and Thai peanut. 

The customer service is flipping fantastic. There used to be an option to order all the chicken dipping sauces as ""extra hot"" and apparently they did away with it. When my fiancé called and requested it they said they no longer offered their old extra hot option but could put an off the menu hot sauce in our dipping sauces to spice it up more. They could have simply told us it wasn't on the menu anymore, but they went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Major brownie points.

I had this pizza for the first time about three years ago and I remembered it just enough to try it again when we were deciding on where to order delivery from. It was a little soggy by the time it was delivered to us, and I'm slightly disappointed that the basil came in the form of tiny stringy paper looking slices. When paying $1.50 per topping, you expect whole basil leaves, even if they are wilted from the cooking process.

3300680,2015-04-03,1,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"Ode to the Meatball Parm from Those Guys Pies

A perfect blending of texture and taste,
Not a crumb of this sandwich would ever I waste.
The bread to slight crunchiness is toasted;
The meatballs' incredible flavor is roasted;
The sauce is rich from the sun ripe tomato;
The cheese is all melty, does not taste like play-doh.
Order one now - don't procrastinate!
It will be the very best thing you ever ate.

The meatball parmigiana sandwich from Those Guys Pies is just about the most phenomenal thing you can eat on the planet. I had one for dinner the first time 2 nights ago. And then for the rest of the night, I could not shut up about how good it was. So I ordered another for dinner yesterday, but this time, I concentrated really, really hard, so that I could use real words in my review instead of just saying ""yum yum."" (I concentrated so hard that a poem popped out!) The bread is sturdy enough to hold up to its hearty contents, but it's not tough or anything that you feel you are ripping apart with your teeth. It doesn't have remarkable flavor on its own, but that's fine, because you don't really want it competing with the rest of the mouthwatering taste sensations. It is a perfect canvas for the food art laid atop. The home-made meatballs have superb flavor, and you can see within the herbs that are used in its making. They are dense enough to have good bite. (As in, not fluffy, like when people use breadcrumbs as filler.) I also like the sauce. It is bright and flavorful, but not too fruity or acidic. But  we must not forget to mention the BRILLIANT way this sandwich is crafted - in the way they lay the meat on the bread. Mark my words, it is such a remarkable idea that I have no doubt in a few years, all meatball parms will be made this way. Instead of your typical 3 or so meatballs tucked into the bread - you know, so that sometimes the uneaten part of a ball rolls out of the bun and into your lap - they slice the meat and angle it so that there's no rolling action, and the amount of meat you get with each bite is fairly consistent. Genius. I took a picture that I will upload in a second. I hope you can see it with this review so that you will see what I mean. 

Although I just recently tried the meatball parm, I've actually eaten here about 15 times. Everything I have tried here has been amazing. I'm from Jersey (New, that is), and I have been looking for a great pie (pizza, that is) in Vegas for over a decade. I feel pretty confident saying this is the best in the whole city. (Which, by extension, really means the best in southern Nevada.)

Pizza: Crust is thin like it should be. Our usual order is the sausage & pepperoni pie. Awesome every time. One time I ordered a veggie pie, no cheese, for a vegan friend, and it was the best damn veggie pie I ever had. (Although to be honest, I didn't ask about the crust ingredients, so it may not have been vegan. Please don't tell my friend.) I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it wasn't just the standard pepper, onion, mushroom, tomato. Maybe they added artichoke hearts? I don't know, but the point is, it was mouthwatering.

Cheesesteak: I have also had this sandwich a couple of times. It comes with onions at no extra charge, but I order ""The Works"" to add on peppers & mushrooms an extra $1. It's fantastic. I do think it's a little pricey for a sandwich, (I think the ribeye is $11, which makes the works $12). But - the meat is thinly sliced, and not chewy, like you get with cheaper meat that has a lot of fat and gristle. I can't stand meat that I can't bite through. I know not everyone agrees, but I would rather pay the extra to enjoy my sandwich instead of fighting with it. 
 
Chicken Fingers: very good. The chicken is moist, the breading is good. I can't say there is anything that needs to be improved about them, I just find it hard to get excited about chicken fingers. If you love Raising Cane's, I'm sure you will love these too. The thing that stands out about them is that they are much, much longer than usual. Fun variety in sauces, too.

I might have to get another meatball parm for dinner tonight, for the third day in a row. Seriously, this sandwich is that good.",OdexeMpufpv2H4yZt2dIZg,3,0,5,qcOaNy8jxg6Spo4RTo6V0Q

To start, the gentleman that I ordered from on the phone was incredibly nice and helpful. 

We ordered two pizzas for delivery. One ""Big Sexy"" and one custom made vegetarian pizza. They were both very very good. The vegetarian had their roasted tomatoes and they were the highlight of it all. They were still crisp and juicy but also full of flavor. The gentleman on the phone explained how they are marinated before roasting. It really was a delight on our pizza. Thin, bendable, pizza with a bubbly and crunchy crust. I am sure when we order delivery to the house we will be ordering here from now.

The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of ""Mozzarella Sticks"" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a ""Italian White Pie"" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches.

Tucked away in an old strip mall by The Lakes, you have to hunt to find this place. It's a tiny shop with virtually no room to dine in. Take out or delivery are your only options. Specializing in New York-style pies, you'll find crusts with a good balance of crispiness and chew that are slightly blistered. I've been meaning to try their red sauce, but their white pies are so good I haven't passed them up. My usual order has been an 18"" white pie ($22) with added caramelized onions, pepperoni, and mushrooms. The 'shroom pie with the white sauce wasn't bad either, full of a variety of mushrooms.

3592465,2012-12-05,5,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"It's funny how things change as the years of our lives pass by. 

I can remember, with vivid clarity, how obsessed I was in my college years about pizza. We spent just about every night out, me and the boys, which would almost always end at someone's pad with Sports Center and pizza. There would be a ten minute debate, each of us making a case for toppings and our favorite pizza joint, until a consensus was reached and an order was placed. Then we would all dig deep for crumpled bills and pocket change to cover the pie (and a little something for the driver).

I could eat almost a whole pie back then, most of us could. But after a long night of partying and spending  way too much money buying drinks for that cute chick in the corner (who was never going to give me her number anyway), the few bucks we had left wasn't going to get us more than a couple of slices each. So when the pizza finally arrived, it would be half gone by the time the delivery guy closed the door (you didn't want to be the guy paying the driver, trust me).

The funny thing is, back then I don't think it really mattered where we got the pizza from or what we ordered on top. When all was said and done and the grease stained box lay empty on the living room floor, each of us would lie back and sound out a deep, satisfying groan of pleasure, as if we had just devoured the tastiest treat on planet Earth. Night after night, pizza after pizza - and each time with the same satisfying moan and a big smile.

And then one day we suddenly realize (as if the past 20 years caught us asleep at the wheel) that we are actually driving 20 miles across town, through rush hour traffic and lights on a mission to destroy us, all the time conflicted about whether we should even try parking  or just pay the $5 for valet, then zigzagging a half a mile through crowds and crowds of bewildered tourists stopping at every little sparkling thing they see, then up three long  flights of escalators, stuck behind some woman who is clearly unaware that the ocean of perfume she bathed in that day is causing the wallpaper to peel (cough!) -  just to grab a slice from the only place we swear we will ever eat pizza from again.

My how things do change.

It's everything you used love about Secret Pizza (apparently the guy is over here now), without the hassle that is the Cosmopolitan.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,4,5,5,-zY07yiLLNOWU5WzhHA44Q

This is another of those places. The fact that they serve pizzas and cheese steaks didn't hurt my desire to go.

My wife and I ate cheese steaks for lunch. I had thought of taking half of mine to work that night. Bad idea. Ate the whole thing for lunch.

I ate what is called ""The Works"". A ten inch thinly shaved rib-eye with onions, mushrooms, green peppers and in this case, provolone cheese.

My wife had ""Italian Steak"". A ten inch shaved rib-eye with caramelized onions, broccoli rabe, and provolone cheese"".

Dining in is not the best of options, only a few tables, the place is very small.

When you walk in you will notice one television, with only one show being aired.

The show is Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives. I mentioned to my wife that it would be funny if this were the episode that features Those Guys Pies. Sure enough that was the episode that was showing. After that episode, it ran again. Coincidence? I think not. As we were putting on our coats to depart, the cook, owner, guy you see on television with Guy thanked us for stopping by, and made a little chat. I happened to notice while eating how hard he worked, how messy his work apron was. 

That's what I like, a cook who had a messy apron !",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,4,3,4,mNNGDC8F8j7p1yJ-yDktsA

Called back 15min later, and they said we'll call the deliver guy right now. Seriously? it takes them a 2nd call to check on the delivery?? Pizza eventually arrived an hour and half after i placed the order--that's double the time i was quoted! if things couldn't get worst, pizza was completely cold, stale and had formed grease pools, and all sides were forgotten AGAIN.

Called the delivery guy right after, and asked him to please come back and return my money and take their pizza back. Nothing for 15min, so i called the store again and asked for a manager. Manager get's on the phone and i tell him what's wrong. He apologized and said they are busy, and when i told him that it's not okay to take an order when you are too busy to honor the time you quote and then deliver a cold pizza for $30.

We decided to give them another try (this time pickup instead of delivery), and I'm so glad we did!  It turns out, the reason for the influx of customers is due their recent debut on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.

We ordered a half pepperoni, half Greek pizza, cheese-steak hoagie, and fries.  ALL of it was delicious and hot.

3956450,2012-11-20,3,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"This is the best cheesesteak in vegas.

I'm from the philadelphia area, so I'll break it down for all my fellow cheesesteak experts on what their cheesesteak is like:

Cheese- choice of whiz, provolone, or white american. I ordered whiz, it was mixed into the meat, not poured on top, making an equal cheese-meat ratio

Meat- good quality angus beef. Cooked perfectly, but not crusty. Finely chopped, not served in a big hunk like at Geno's. On the juicy rather than greasy side. 

Onions- sliced thinly, not diced. These are probably the thinnest sliced onions I've had on a cheesesteak.

Roll- the roll was, hands down, the best part. Perfectly soft and crusty. A+++++++ for the roll. No sesame seeds on the roll.

They have a number of options for cheesesteaks, such as hoagie style (with lettuce and tomato),  pizza steak (marinara sauce) and an italian steak with provolone and broccoli rabe (a la tony luke's, they have a similar sandwich there).

Also, they NEVER refer to a cheesesteak as a Philly.

I called and ordered a Big Sexy--a pie with sausage, pepperoni, garlic, onion, and pepperoncini.  It is offered in two sizes--14 inch regular and an 18 inch ""big pie.""

I was home in a few minutes and the pizza was still warm but not hot.  It was a good pizza with a nice crust and plenty of toppings.

We had leftover slices that I froze and I would remove one from the freezer the night before I was going to have it for breakfast.  Leftover, cold pizza--talk about breakfast of champions!

This is basically a take out place.  There are only a few tables in the tiny restaurant.  The name is not above the door outside but rather in the window.  

Finally, if it matters to you, Those Guys Pies was on an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  II first heard about the place from a couple from New York who like to try Triple D places when they travel.  Because of the lack of seating, they ended up heating the warm pizza in 100 degree weather in Desert Breeze Park.  That speaks to the lack of dining space inside.

Until further notice, this is a pick up only joint and no sit downs.  Wish I read this on one of the earlier reviews but nope.  You can sit but it will have to be outside on the rinky dink table next to the Lake or a bench in front of another business.

I had the intentions (with Yelper Angela T)  to come in and sit down to try these new pies but there was no sit down option, there's a flat table to the right when you walk in but it was more for their business.  However, we met with the person running the joint, Sean B., and he offered us chairs to sit down and have a slice or two.  I immediately took a bite out of my pie because the toppings looked fresh and it tasted as it looked.  

I ordered half a big sexy and half cheese steak pie, both great and had a kick to it.  The pie and box comes with small containers of additional condiments such as peppers, cheese, garlic.  The true test for me however is how it tastes in the morning, and Those Guys Pies passed.  

The upside down cheesecake was delicious, I would definitely recommend picking up an order of those.  It's not too much, and it's not too small, for how sweet it is it fits fine on the container they use now.  Some reviews state the thin crust, I've had thinner but I like this place because of how stacked the good quality ingredients are on the pies.

If you look at my record I only have 7 five stars against my 100 and whatever so... that means quite a bit of awesome happened this day. I think the best part was meeting the 75 year old chain smoker while we waited for our pizza but... I digress. 

BBQ Chicken... delicious. One of my favorite BBQ pizzas ever... which I guess doesn't tell the whole story. They use a great BBQ sauce that mixes well with the chicken and cheese and yum.

The garlic chicken - I think... I dont remember haha. But what i do know is that there was ricotta cheese on them which is a freakin must and a half. (what does must and a half mean... no one knows.) But it was so good i loved the garlic mixed with mozzarella.

The Cheese sticks... great I would suggest getting some with your order (total price ended up around 40). I am writing this review while hungry and I am just craving this pizza. It is the perfect comfort food. And the perfect make you fat food. Thats how you know its good.

THE VERDICT: best pizza place in vegas. I dont know i only went to one... but a who gives a damn... yes it is the best.

We picked up our order of pizza and cinnamon poppers and we all really enjoyed it and complimented the sauce, crust and overall freshness. The last two times we ordered, the quality has steadily declined. Last time the crust wasn't quite the same and it was greasy. We figured we would give it another shot tonight and ordered same toppings we did the first time we ordered. It was worse, sadly. The crust was dense and hard to chew, the cheese had congealed and sauce had soaked through and appeared to us maybe it had been sitting a while?

We figured this would be the pizza place we order from when our little ones want pizza night, but after tonight and finishing only a few pieces from a regular size pie, we will be branching out and ordering elsewhere from here on out. It's always sad hen a place goes downhill after just a couple visits. 

Maybe it was the fact that we did delivery and not takeout? Who know. Either way, we won't be doing Those Guys next time we order unfortunately. I'm giving 3 stars because initially I would have given a 5 star review, but after the last two visits and them being more like 1-2 star reviews, I just took a couple stars off. Any advice I would give would be, don't so delivery. Maybe that'll help?

We went in today, and the guy that helped was helpful, funny, and really laid back. He made us a half regular and half white pie, because he overheard my girlfriend and I debating which to get. 

When he was packing it up to give it to us, he said something to the effect of ""if you don't like that pie, you're crazy!"" .... But he's such a laid back guy that it came off more of quiet confidence and being friendly. Man though, he was right. 

They slather on garlic, which I happen to love. If you don't, perhaps this won't be the place for you. 

The regular pie was delicious, the sauce and cheese they use are SO flavorful. The crust was a bit soggy (we drove 10 minutes home), but man the flavor was so good I easily forgave some sogginess.

How unfortunate, yet again this place that used to be great completely missed the mark. Asked for wings & pizza extra crispy - both couldn't be any soggier -
HERE'S A TIP FOR YOU GUYS-
When dealing with fried foods - always ventilate the styrofoam so steam doesn't ruin the crispness of the food DUH
I'm pissed! No bags to put the wings in & sauce them - no center piece on pizza preventing the lid & cheese touching 
The fries sucked for the same reason as the rest of the food - no ventilation & so now after spending $55 on food I'm standing at my oven cooking trying to revive the food I paid for. 
Also check out the pic of the wings & notice the sauce on the right - ventilation again would've prevented this tragic mistake ..

   I took a friend there......very small......very ! .......we ordered 2 salads , 1 pizza , an order of wings and had 2 iced teas out of the cooler. We had to ask for a couple glasses and ice....no straws.....then after waiting and no offer of even water....out comes the pizza.....then the salads....then wings.......timing was just awful ! The salads  came in a to go container.....it was just ok....just thrown together and to much crappie dressing dumped on top. The pizza......well....Dajorno would have been an improvement  !!!!! Awful taste.....crappie crust ! Then the wings....omg.....plain old wings deep fried in a basket and 2 little plastic to go cups with dips. I have to say.......the WORST wings I've ever had !!!  
  I should have known better......most Triple D places I go to are dumps and poor food, and this place was no different!  Save yourself the gas and stomach and forget this place.

Three Cheese Fries ($5). This was a large serving and was DRENCHED in cheese...awesome! I split the cheesesteak and fries with Eva, and we still weren't able to finish everything!

I had to pick up the order because my office is just outside the 5 mile mark (I am 5.2 miles out) but I said to try a new pizza location is well worth a drive and the guy on the phone seemed exceptionally nice and apologetic.  

When I got to the location it was easy to find the staff was very friendly I like being called by my name, telling me have nice day NAME. Just don't get that enough out here in Vegas. 

Now the details of the delicious food!!!   The Cheese Steak has to be my favorite it was delicious, perfect amount of cheese and the steak OMG melted with so much flavor not chewy leather that I find everywhere else in this city.

The chicken fingers are my brothers fav in the city, fresh different and tasty he said and he would be the expert in this department lol.  

The pizza reminded me of the east coast flavor which I miss being from Boston.  The spices, cheese and sauce all such a tasty combination and the dough was perfect thickness for my liking, hand tossed always the way to go if you like the mom and pop feel and fresh maid daily taste.

Cheese Pizza with Artichokes / Italian White Pie with Ricotta, Mozarella, Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Caramelized Onion
Fried Mushrooms
Meatball
Cannolis
Cinnamon Poppers with Citrus Cream Cheese Dipping Sauce

Located at The Lakes and described as ""a labor of love to create the best for the best,"" Those Guys Pies had long been a member of the Las Vegas 'to-do' list and with business nearby on Friday afternoon a visit was planned the day prior, online ordering allowing pickup orders to be placed in advance with an 11:20am default setting.

Cited by trusted sources as ""good pizza in an inconvenient spot,"" the latter lament an accurate description for pretty much anything at The Lakes, Those Guys Pies is tucked away in a small shopping center on Lake East Drive and with minimal signage plus limited seating the restaurant operates mostly as a grab-n'-go option for local residents, the ""wait times approximate"" as was demonstrated by an 11:40am order readied just four minutes before noon.

Visited by Guy Fieri for Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, this fact obvious as Chef Roy Bass plays the DVD on a television in-house, Those Guys Pies looks to set itself apart from other pizzerias by focusing on quality products and a philosophy of doing as much as possible within the small kitchen, roots in Jersey and reference to Tacconelli's giving those familiar hopes that may be a bit over-inflated, though the Philadelphia icon is certainly not a bad target at which to aim.

Running just a three man crew, the wait times not conducive to those with only an hour for lunch, it was at a small table alongside the man-made lake that lunch was enjoyed and although the oft-praised Maple Cheesecake was sold out the $28 tab nonetheless netted more than enough food to share, the half-and-half options for pies as well as sides allowing for a good amount of variety beginning with tender breaded mushrooms and a handmade Angus Meatball that featured almost no filler beneath mozzarella and bright marinara, the richness mellowed slightly by notes of garlic, basil and rosemary.

Watching the pizza get loaded into the oven at the time of my 11:39 arrival, the fourteen minute cook-time certainly not enough to render edges crispy as I stood, ignored, at the counter waiting, first bites of the red sauce slice showed good flavor but compromised crust texture and moving on to the ""Italian White Pie"" Special the results were equally mixed as the toppings were absolutely top-grade amidst pools of ricotta while the crust was starchy and flimsy with too much stretch.

Turning to desserts, the Fried Dough with Cinnamon, Sugar and a sidecar of sweet topping complimentary with Social Media Check-In, Those Guys Pies apparently brings the cheesecakes in from an outside source who makes these only for them and with the daily delivery not yet arriving tastes were instead invested in freshly made cannoli with a sturdy shell that shatters into creamy mascarpone dotted with chocolate chips, not as good as those at Naked City or Elements, but a heck of a lot better than the prefilled disasters people wait in line for at Carlo's Bakery.

***While the issues noted make me question the ""Good pizza"" portion of the ""inconvenient spot"" quote there is no doubt Those Guys are working with good product, the desserts and appetizers all excellent even before considering the bargain pricing compared to local competitors.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,5,3,y0aaUVb1Wrq0lSQsXsSrmw

The steak wasn't overly salty or peppered. It was juicy and tender and succulent. I got my sandwich with mushrooms and cheese whiz.

The store is very small and is definitely not a dine-in place. I suggest calling to order ahead for pick up, although my sandwich was made on the spot and didn't take long to get.

I've been wanting to try their Cheesesteak Pie since I've heard about them. With the red sauce, No shrooms we don't dig the fungi. The staff was very friendly and chatted with my husband while we waited for the pie. They give you little cups of oregano, garlic, red peppers and grated cheese with your pie. 
The pizza was delicious, not my favorite in town but a contender. Loved the crust, it had tons of cheese and was close to an actual cheesesteak taste. My only complaint is their red sauce, I was glad the pizza didn't have a lot of it. I just wasn't a big fan, can't quite put my finger on why.  But I'm weird with my sauce preferences. Prices are about on track with most quality pizza places.

Their pizzas are pretty good, have tried several combinations. Last being the big sexy which was surprisingly WAY spicy (too spicy for my husband to even eat any) and seemed like they skimped a little in the cheese department. The first time we ordered  I remember thinking the pizza was way too garlicky, which you if you know me you'd know that's almost an impossible feat to use too much garlic. Their wings are really good, but their sauces are what makes them great. I give their TGP sauce (sriracha aioli) 5+ stars, I was dipping everything in it, including my daughters chicken fingers and the mozzarella sticks LOL. On that note, their chicken fingers are really quite good. The first time we ordered they were way over seasoned with either italian seasoning or oregano, so I thought they were actually kind of gross, but this last time they were really very good. My husband had the philly cheesesteak and he said it was pretty good. I ordered the spinach salad time before last and it was a pretty big disappointment. There was so much slimy spinach, it was actually kind of hard to eat. I picked a lot of it out and ate what I could, so I think if they washed and checked their spinach and used a better dressing it would actually be a great salad - but I personally would not order it again. Their jalapeño peppers are good and have also had the shroom on white pizza which was good too. So all in all, I think it's a good pizza place.

508PM -- We call Those Guys and order a large pizza. We asked how long the pizza would take to deliver since we needed to feed the babies (1 year olds). Roy let me know that the pizza would take about 15 minutes to cook and, since there was one delivery ahead of us, another 10 for the delivery. 25 minutes to go less than one mile, so we asked for delivery.
558PM -- No pizza. We called back to see if everything was ok with the delivery guy (we were hoping he hadn't been in an accident or anything) and was assured that the delivery guy would be at our door any minute.
612PM -- Still no pizza. We called again and were told that Roy was going to check up on his delivery guy. Something about car trouble.
625PM -- Still no pizza. This is now over an hour past the time we called to order. We called again. This was getting ridiculous and now the kids have already eaten something else. Here is where Roy kinda redeemed himself -- he said if the pizza wasn't at our house in 5 minutes, it was on him. Well, it wasn't.
645PM -- Our pizza finally arrived, with no apology from the delivery guy. Had we known it would have taken this long to get the pizza, we would have driven the 5 minutes ourselves to pick it up.

Now, the pizza. We ordered a large half cheese and half mushroom and olive. When it got to us, it was warm, not hot. This may have something to do with the mediocre taste. We only ordered from this restaurant because of the great Yelp reviews. But, given the time it took to arrive at our house and the blah taste factor, I doubt we'll order again.

I was very impressed being from NY and all, the crust was amazing. I can't wait to check out other pizza from here and their cheesesteaks!",UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A,2,1,4,6gEDu7PpiEd36_-ZAPYN3g
5781852,2016-04-30,0,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"I was really pulling for this place given the exposure on DDD but I was very disappointed. We ordered a large pepperoni, bell pepper and mushroom pizza, chicken fingers and fried mushrooms. When the delivery person arrived with the pizza bag, the pizza box was bending on both sides and the two bags were weighed on top smashing the pizza. I had to help her take the box out as she was pulling the box slanted almost upright. The fried mushrooms were smashed into a closed plastic box and two sauce containers were literally pushed down onto the mushrooms. It wasn't edible to say the least. We are disappointed at the $49.00 spent here. The two stars are for the friendly customer service over the phone.

Pizza was ordered on Saturday, April 30th, in the evening.",dYRsnzPkwhC8stk-XwITtg,2,2,2,-Ba3coMpwaee2w9zdrw2xg

The bread they used is nice and soft inside but nicely toasted outside. The prime rib cuts is exceptional; juicy and flavorful. I tried it with the provolone and as you can see from my picture- it's nice and cheesey. Mmmmm so good... Get it with caramelized onions!

Will be coming back to try their chicken cheesesteak and some of their good looking pies!

Check it out!",IaOyMay2X9VmPyEnIBFb2A,4,3,4,BcgUBkUZAO1UdLpfhqkfyw

We were looking to try a new pizza joint following a fun visit to our Vet on the westside.  I am sooo glad we chose this place!

It's located in the back corner if a strip mall in The Lakes.  I can only hope they expand and put another location closer to us, because this location is a little of a jaunt.  Believe me though, jaunt or no, we will be returning frequently!  If you want to sit and eat, there's a small table inside, or seats by the lake.  It's a beautiful view.  

Don't judge the food from the outside.  It is a small pizzeria, but it's all good!  We were immediately greeted and welcomed.  The place smelled so good!  I immediately thought of our fave pizza place in NYC!  Scrammed, bustling and packed full of deliciousness!  We decided to carry out The Works and the Meatball subs.  I don't think I can properly describe how good these subs were.  Forget any other sub shop!  The flavors were off the chain....homemade meatballs, need I say more??

We will most definitely be back to try the pizzas.  The white pizza has been calling my name.  Those Guys Pies just made customers for life!!!!!  This place belongs on our FAVE Vegas eats list!",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,3,3,5,gmjes3fKsYrDoQadHoChFg
5868524,2014-06-21,1,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,Been back here many times and have ordered delivery. Pizzas are still delicious but I find myself getting the cheesesteaks more often now because they are the best in town by a large margin. When we order in at work we usually split the cheesesteaks and get a slice of pizza each.,bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,2,1,5,KG_Sf05fbi4zAMoE9E92eQ
5888621,2018-05-19,0,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,So good! If you plan on dining in just be aware that this is a very small place. But you will not be disappointed! I had a cheesesteak and it was INSANE!

I was driving quite a ways before I would get home to enjoy this delicious pizza, they told me to keep the lid cracked on the box so the crust wouldn't get soggy from the steam!  Yum!  Yum!  I cannot wait until they open one of these locations in Henderson!  I should also add the the guy who makes the Philly Cheese Steaks is from that area!  So they are legit Cheese Steaks!  :)",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,4,4,5,2WQI4oqdLVR_9KXoBDDW6g
5951245,2013-11-26,2,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"My cheesesteak sandwich experiences are limited to my university's on-campus grill (American cheese oozing over a pile of grilled onions and beef on overly greasy cardboard, ahem, flavorless soggy chewy bread) and Amato's Cheesesteaks in the Bay Area. Amato's has a great reputation, but we always got it to go and it would be steaming in the paper wrapper for about 25 minutes. Fast forward to our trip to Las Vegas, where I read about Those Guys Pies in one of the Las Vegas magazines. Take a bite. Close your eyes. Chew and savor and repeat. This stuff is pure heaven, or at least I hope heaven is a place filled with delicious cheesesteaks and pies from Those Guys Pies. 

I ordered The Works Cheesesteak with a hug and photo-op. The freshly baked flavorful yeasty bread was stuffed with a ridiculous amount of deliciously marinated tender certified Angus beef rib-eye with grilled onions, mushroom, green bell peppers and white American cheese and then placed in the hot pizza oven for a crispety crunchety exterior and piping hot interior. Sooooo gooood. Amazing. Mind-blowing. Life-changing. And then there was the pizza. Thin and chewy high quality crust with crisp edges and lots of flavor (I hate bland crust), topped by the most amazing red sauce, delicious mozzarella cheese and yummy housemade sausage! Since we ordered a half and half, the halves were composed carefully, leaving a strip down the middle that did not have any meat or veggies.

We were going to eat once we got back to the house, but the smell was making me hungry, so we ate in the car instead. My lap was used as a tabletop; thankfully Las Vegas Weekly saved the super hot pizza from burning the top of my thighs. I burned my mouth on that piping hot first slice! After the searing pain, my taste buds encountered immense pleasure. Yummmmm. Hello, best ever pizza and cheesesteak in Las Vegas. Totes Amaze! You must try this place!",UiGjeRQyDE8rxgE-0hisaw,5,5,5,cqH4olbuImxEIdL1nzOzLg
5959461,2014-11-04,2,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,"On the hunt to find new wings to sample, I stopped by Those Guys Pies for pick up. I ordered wings with a number of different sauces, fried mushrooms and a cheesesteak with mushrooms.

They serve the wings plain and give you the sauces to season yourself. My favorite flavors were the pineapple buffalo and wasabi ranch. The fried mushrooms had a nice batter and were cooked well. They even stayed crispy after a long drive home. I was excited about the cheesesteak after hearing all the raves and I was a little disappointed. It was so greasy and was bland.

The wings were enough to draw me back and I look forward to trying their pizza on my next visit. The guys at Those Guys Pies were great and very accommodating.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,3,3,TJz18UOd8CznJ6s_5muDRg
5976693,2014-08-04,1,IOEGLxXwCNiq4P-U359D7Q,Some of the best pizza around. I've been there several times and it is always amazing. The shroom pizza is my favorite by far and the diablo is not far behind (has ghost pepper sauce.) The guys in the shop are super friendly and they are pretty quick as well. I've been to New York and this pizza blows theirs out of the water.,5KzS8xgVJHOY1_L5XcraaA,0,1,5,Mpm4iYHK2glWjBWYu2O3_A

.he said that's how pizza us supposed to me..so he argued with me for a few..put me on hold..and said ok bring the pizza back..which I did and got a refund..when I came in the guy from the back..maybe the owner I'm not sure..but I showed him..he even said that's unexceptable..and apologized and said pizza shouldn't be like that..also u guys need to teach the incompetent smart-ass how to deal with customers .",8DUBy2yBwrtgQ3kwd71_pw,1,1,2,GduM-dVSXnavPFfMjzz9XQ

I don't get subs often so I forgot that some places generously sprinkle black pepper and oregano on top, and I didn't notice it on the menu. The quality of ingredients and quantity of meat was excellent, but the pepper and oregano knocked off a star for me. I ate half (washing it down with some tea), but the other half will be lunch for a family member. I will definitely order there again, but I will also remember to say no extra seasoning on top.",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,0,0,4,cjDcKGAhfnBNViVD_ITVyg
