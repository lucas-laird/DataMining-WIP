However, the menu  was quite limited, the service was slow, and there was a dirty napkin on my chair when they seated us. They never took it away, we had to ditch it on another table.

Located by Maryland and Silverado Ranch, a few doors down from Cici pizza, this place is huge and very clean. Better yet, the food was surprisingly good. We went for the lunch buffet. Don't let their buffet style confuse you, it was also new to me. They bring out the items on the menu as you order them. So it's kind of like ""Tapas"" style dinning rather than a buffet bar where you scoop up your own servings. I actually kind of like this style as I didn't over eat and yet I was fully satisfied. All the curries were delish and spicy and they have my favorite desserts too. Meal includes naan. Bring a friend, heck invite all your friends. The lunch buffet was a decent price of $11.99.

There is a wide selection of curries and items. I really enjoyed the chicken masala, it was full of flavors and chicken was moist!!!! Lamb was great as well. They come in these small dishes, so you can try other items too and not be full after eating one dish. I was not to impress with their shirmp curry, it had flavor but it was not like the others.

Twenty five minutes later ""IT"" comes out. Draped in sauce to hide the fact that it's not done. How hard is it to cook lobster???? You can visibly tell when it's done and when it isn't done. I ate my bread and appetizers and paid for the meal. The kicker is the hostess asked me if I wanted a discount for the undercooked lobster.

We came here for lunch which is all you can eat expecting a long buffet table with steel old food sitting on it like most places. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that the all you can eat dishes were all cooked fresh as you order them so when the dishes came out they all tasted open much higher premium quality.

We had a chance to speak to the owner and if you ever meet him you'll agree he is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Every person who worked here was very warm and friendly!

The food seriously tasted great and getting seconds or thirds is welcomed. We left here stuffed and can't wait to come back again!

Update: Went back 3 more times unfortunately the standards kept going down and the portions are now so small it's just 2 bites before you have to keep reordering which gets awkward and they make you feel a little uncomfortable.

3973287,2018-02-28,3,5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg,"I came here for dinner last night and was handed the all you can eat dinner menu.  I thought it was at the buffet area, which was dark, but the woman explained that all food is made to order in the kitchen rather than sitting in pans on a buffet.

I ordered:

Papadi chaat
Onion pakora
Chili chicken
Tadaka daal 
Matar mushroom
Baigan bharta
Badami kheer
Gulab jamun

The standout dishes were the chaat, chili chicken, and tadaka daal.  The chaat was made with chick peas, pieces of finely chopped potato, tomatoes, and flour crisps.  When I've had chaat before, it generally had rice crisps.  These were flour and were just as good.  The chili chicken had a very nice spice tang to it as did almost all the dishes I tried.  The baigan bharta is roasted eggplant cooked with spices in peanut seasoned coconut sauce.  The two desserts--kheer and gulab jamun-- were standard for Indian restaurants. 

I like the fact that the servings are small dishes so you can try different things.  I wish there was more of a selection but I understand they have to limit it because of cooking time.  

I was the only one in the restaurant when I arrived a little after 5.  Later, two other parties came in but it was a slow night while I was there.  You can also order from the regular menu but the server assumed I'd want the AYCE option which is available only on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  Note--there was a sign on the door that they would be closing Tuesdays starting March 6.

For $14.02, including tax, this was a good meal.  That price also included the mango lassi.  It's an inexpensive dinner and a good one.  I need gto go back and get something from their standard menu.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,8,3,1rHQ5VrmTEa3sibnJUIutg

Garlic naan had chunks of garlic in there. It was so fresh and crispy. Dip this with the rice and garlic and make it into a taco is what I did.

4592302,2017-12-30,0,5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg,"I would easily give this disgrace of an Indian restaurant a 0 out of 5 rating, but unfortunately Yelp doesn't currently support that. 

My dad had suggested this restaurant during our family trip to Las Vegas due to the positive reviews from ""customers"". However, I immediately had a sinking feeling when we entered the restaurant and noticed that the place was empty. Completely silent! In fact, there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled, prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After he seated us, I waited a few minutes, and when water didn't show, I felt annoyed that I had to ask for water. It's a restaurant, Jesus Christ ! In addition, I noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys I was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant I had ever been too. However, I forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service, every single item we ordered took absurdly long to prepare, considering we were the ONLY customers present. In fact, one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because he doesn't eat that. The item didn't even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating. 

Service aside, let's move on to the most important part: quality of food. The vegetable Pakora, the first appetizer, was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell, anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces, I could see the raw cauliflower which had none of the flavorless batter. Unappetizing much? I decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy, was I wrong! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste, tomato purée, and chunks of tomato, with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far, the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning, my uncle said he threw up all of the disgusting channa masala. 

I presume the high ratings are from non-Indians who don't know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you, I suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know. Once you visit a proper Indian restaurant, you will agree with my review and agree with how an abomination of a restaurant Armaan Taste of India is.",NpzLHUDwsVnciPdialPolg,0,0,1,Px_eFn6zAeJbbfjzIqxLuA

It's All You Can Eat off of a menu which has most dishes you find at any Indian restaurant.  You order whatever you want and they bring it in small portions enough for 2-3 people.
The food was definitely fresher and tastier than the other place we normally go to and tue beat part was everything is fresh made to order unlike other places that have food sitting out under warmers.  One TIP YOU NEED TO FOLLOW WHEN EATING HERE...**Order everything you want to try at the beginning!!!** We made the mistake of placing our orders at different times and our 2nd order took 20 minutes.  By that time our stomachs had settled and were full.  Definitely try the rice pudding.  It was also better than what we normally get at the other place on Eastern.  Its topped with almond slivers but I think they should also top with coconut.  Overall they get 4 stars.  Took off 1 star over the long wait.

4948019,2018-06-21,0,5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg,"The only major draw for me here is they have an AYCE buffet every Monday for CHEAP!

If you do come, don't expect any stellar service. Both times I've been, the waitresses were lagging on refill service. It is summer. So guests are hungry. No matter what size glass you give to the guest, a refill is still a refill.

Also, another con to this place is you basically get ""nickle and dime""-d. Side sauces like the tamarind sauce, cilantro sauce and raita where you normally get for free at 90% of other Indian restaurants, here you get charged for it. Being in the business, I get where their mentality stems from, but to actually experience it as a paying guest, I abstain from enjoying these condiments here. 

Food is nothing to brag about, but for price and convenience of this place being closer than MOST Indian restaurants that I would normally visit, I would still come back.

Hey, cheap eats is cheap eats. As long as they keep up the gulab jamon filled, I'll always consider this place!",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,0,3,inrOxasjpXy02ponqrQltA
4956210,2018-01-01,0,5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg,"Food is delicious! I came here with my boyfriend and they seem to still be fairly new. There were only 2 servers and they had a big party of 10, along with a few 2 and 4 top tables.  
Since there were only 2 servers, the service was kinda slow but they were doing their best so I can't really complain but they are understaffed. We also noticed the party of 10 was giving them a hard time and in my opinion being dicks. Anyway....when the food finally came out, everything was DELICIOUS. We ordered the all you can eat lunch and had the Makhani Daal (lentils), Matar Mushroom, and garlic naan. Our server first only gave us 2 orders of Makhani Daal and we had to ask her to bring ring the mushroom dish but she never did. We told the second server and she told the kitchen and they brought it out 10 minutes later. 
The food is great, however if they will need to be fully staffed in order to gain repeat customers.",eIs903qIpxuYvKM2Kmas-A,1,0,3,ahu3ZcaYAoInnZnpPu7vhQ

5040841,2017-12-10,0,5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg,"I wanted to like this place as I love Indian food and was excited to have a new place opening up in the neighborhood. 

I arrived and there was only one table of 3 in the restaurant plus myself dining alone. I ordered the signature lamb shank from the menu. 

It took 45 minutes for my entree to arrive and it was cold, tough and tasteless. For close to $25 for the entree it was a disappointment 

I wanted to give them a shot but clearly they are struggling with just opening 

I might try them again in the future but quite honestly there are several more Indian restaurants in town that are much tastier and worth it.",ylku-3TJU62S1mnKlxDDtA,3,2,1,Xc5jhjwJCXYQIPzZFgBwkA

Was greeted right away and handed a menu - we were planning on the AYCE buffet but did not see it set up anywhere so we started picking items to start.  Karen, our waitress, told us that the 'buffet' was order as you go - this was awesome because everything came out hot and fresh and was shareable by our whole group (3 total).   We were able to pass dishes around with ease so it was like our own family style buffet. 

Karen walked us through some options and we started with our fan favorite: Chicken Tikka Masala.  The sauce was flavorful and delicious, we ended up getting 3 helpings of it.  We also tried the Goat Roganjosh which reminded me of a pot roast, very tender meat.  My unexpected favorite was the Chicken Saag - I have never had it before but now I will make sure to order it every time.  We also tried the naan, Makhani Daal and a roasted eggplant puree with spices but I cant remember the name of it.   All the food was well balanced with spices and flavor and the owner and staff were all really friendly.

I love supporting local businesses and if you are in the mood for great Indian food, I would definitely suggest it!  They also offer takeout which I may take advantage of during the work week but their AYCE offer is a hell of a deal.",OWwO6rlPLSINNYA4RNCToA,4,1,5,lJPAVzQVsM1Lnp0ZRWWQTA

Naan is standard, just okay. Chef by special requests made me whole wheat Puri. A little heavy but very good. Palaak paneer creamy but has a strange spice added. Service is top notch.

They have a all you can eat special where everything is cooked to order. The food is fresh, flavorful and authentic. The owner surprised us with a complimentary order of onion rings and the Indian tamarind sauce. Very nice touch. 

I was blown away with the taste, presentation and attention to detail. I will highly recommend you pay a visit to this new restaurant and offer Mo the opportunity to delight your palate with the authentic taste of India.",Rx-lnDQMrVgqnI0Pcb2Q5w,3,1,5,UfTPPkEfUsGig-lSEYYg-Q

We ordered goat curry, chicken curry tandoori chicken( a little too dry to my taste) and eggplant. 
The food taste good and the spices are just about right to my palate. 
The desert is good, gulab jamun and the rice pudding which I sent back to the kitchen initially, came back as to what I expected.
The price is Fair and the servings are generous. The plus side is the place does not have the normal smell of an indian buffet restaurant cause the food are coming from the kitchen instead of the normal buffet counter.
I can come back again but won't crave for it.",O38E6KW3oiUD9VxHNziakg,2,0,4,9dRl3hVa2qU9JhJA5e6z2A
