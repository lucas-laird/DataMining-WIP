Plenty of other real Israeli kosher restaurants in Vegas to go too!",VcVJgds2-R3kIqN4Yzgx_A,3,0,2,jM5zIHvc3m1AiBkUdf4IgA
1645699,2016-04-20,14,-sEbDB_5jI_yIlklu1o1VQ,"I found this spot on Yelp, checked out the website, and was suitably impressed enough to call in an order for pickup. The woman I spoke to was polite, and even called back to tell me they were out of an item so I could reorder.

Location leaves a lot to be desired. It's in the same general area as Lotus of Siam, Komol, and Arawan- but toward the back of the shopping center, in the same building as Vegas Lounge, but on the other side. Even armed with the address, I had to call for help finding them. Inside is much nicer, with mirrored walls and linen table cloths, like an event space. 

No customers or staff present when I entered. I approached the bar and part of my order was waiting. That's when I saw the receipt: $14 for my schnitzel pita wrap and $24 for a grilled chicken salad. Wait, what?! I had tried to order the Nicoise salad ($14) but they were out of tuna, how does substituting chicken (due to no fault of my own) jack up the price $10?!

I told the employee to cancel the salad, $24 for a grilled chicken salad is ridiculous. She seemed surprised and confused. I left with my wrap and went on my way. The wrap was about half the size as similarly-priced orders I've had elsewhere, and the hummus was barely spread half way into the wrap. The amount of protein was generous, but it lacked flavor and the pita was falling apart. I love Mediterranean food but this was absolutely bland. 

TLDR: If you have to stick to a Kosher* diet, I guess it's good to have another option in town. If you're just popping in for a meal, the menu sounds promising but my experience left a lot to be desired. *Unclear if they are certified.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,20,12,2,knCp-2h9yjo9nfpvQVA9mw
1871460,2015-08-24,0,-sEbDB_5jI_yIlklu1o1VQ,"The atmosphere of the place was very nice. For a kosher restaurant, there was plenty of room and comfortable tables and chairs. The noise level and ambience was also nice. We were quickly seated and our orders were also taken quickly. The food also came VERY quickly.

I ordered a steak (what else to have in Vegas?). The quality of the meat was mediocre--not great, but not awful. I ordered it medium rare (pink), but it was cooked done/well done (brown). I was pretty disappointed. But despite it being way overcooked (for my personal preference) it was still tasty. They gave us a free dessert to compensate for the steak, which was unexpected and nice.

Overall, the food was good, but I would say not a good value for the price. In other words, for what we paid ($98 for two people), my expectations were much higher.",ybfdfMPH6UZYquxctYElsA,5,0,3,VC_xGDetB65beetVzfRZ5w

I ordered the schnitzel/falafel which was good, the babagnoosh very good. The pita was store bought not like my regular place where it's fresh and homemade. I try and take s bite out of my Corned Beef sandwich WOW-TOUGH AS SHOE LEATHER! I ask for corned beef on Rye and get shoe leather on Wheat!

4526343,2016-12-15,0,-sEbDB_5jI_yIlklu1o1VQ,"Overall this restaurant is not great, especially for the pricing. 

Beware of hidden charges. We asked for extra pita with the hummus and there was an extra charge for it that was unexpected. In addition, 15% tip is charged regardless of the size of the party, which is odd.

We ordered the Haifa combination plate that came with kabob, chicken and beef shishlik, shwarma, and two sides for $36 to share. This was a much smaller portion than expected for the price especially because the french fries (one of the sides) took up most of the plate. 

In addition, the meat was not great. The beef and chicken shishlik was tough and the chicken was tasteless and too salty. The shwarma was tasty but a little too salty. 

Looking at the rest of the menu, the pricing seems to be a bit aggressive. For example, a falafel pita costs $12, much higher than I've seen it priced anywhere else. 

For a restaurant this expensive, I expected the restaurant to look more maintained and less aged. In addition, I'd have expected the owner to have his own office in the back, rather than assigning one of the restaurant's tables as one and watching CNN at a volume audible throughout the entire restaurant.",CK1Q1sJ6o5UEorZ-JEmLnQ,1,0,2,ctVpxbdLZoPOUjOYFQLVaw
5381956,2017-05-02,0,-sEbDB_5jI_yIlklu1o1VQ,"Mediocre at best. The decor is too much, and yet not enough. It looks like it wants to be a fancy restaurant, but the ceiling is exposed. Relatively expensive, but i guess most kosher places are. Still, $12 for schawarma pita without any sides or drink is too much. It tasted fine. Not great, not bad, just fine. The pita was store bought, and the hummus tasted like it was also store bought. The wait staff were fine. They never refilled my water or asked if i wanted anything else, but they were friendly. I would've given 3 stars for being average, but when the check came, 18% gratuity was included. I was there by myself, so they automatically put gratuity for a party of 1. Then on the credit card slip they have a place for additional gratuity. So lost a star for that. If you keep strict kosher, the food tasted fine enough that I'd say you're fine to come here. But i won't be back.",NZ2Nad5rO6oTU6YNXwDajw,2,0,2,Ln30morAa8Fx0HdFj918FA
