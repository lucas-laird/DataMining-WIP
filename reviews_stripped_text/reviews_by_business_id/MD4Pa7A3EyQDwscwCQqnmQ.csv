1168348,2016-10-06,1,MD4Pa7A3EyQDwscwCQqnmQ,"The cashier was very nice and accommodating (due to me being a vgan) .. The burrito its self was disappointing.

I ordered a California Bowl , but no chicken and in.a tortilla.

The was WAY to much rice , the beans and salsa was ok , the problem was they used guacamole instead of avacado (like in the bowl ) , there was BARELY any at all . 

Hubbys was so so.

For the price we paid , it wasn't worth it.

Sorry guys ..",7-KDH-EtqzDQg4Bh2xIalg,1,0,2,DZo_WC8XBacR5fD0k89FAQ
1255431,2017-08-26,1,MD4Pa7A3EyQDwscwCQqnmQ,"This is exactly what I want a fish taco to be.

The Boyfriend and I will often split a combo plate as a snack. One tasty taco each, and shared beans and chips. With two drinks, it's snacky perfection for under $15.

This location is clean and airy (lots of windows). Good service.",8la7DygWKVkfpDatXztktg,1,1,4,r_CUsQlt3qe-J749WE1fHA

In fact I drove several miles (since there was no west side location) to come here specifically! Almost makes me never go to rubios when I'm just becoming a fan! ...  So instead... Today...  I left and went to Canes! It wasn't what I was in the mood for,  but they're awesome, so they get my patronage (and money).",h9paMdkJXIe7nFlQwan1Zg,0,1,1,IqUFowsZ0iV9aZJ8hAFoIw

This particular location is inside Las Vegas South Premium Outlets, but the same thing can be said to any.

Unlike Chipotle, they do have seafood tacos, and in fact they are pretty decent.

If you haven't tried yet, trust me and order their fish taco especial. And let me know what you think here.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,1,1,4,GuQcPlt7og0_Fck8wajePw

Hubby ordered the Cilantro Lime Burrito which he subbed brown rice and black beans for the tortilla: so good and filling!

2436012,2017-06-04,0,MD4Pa7A3EyQDwscwCQqnmQ,"It's a better option in this mall than Sbarro but it could be better.  Semi-tasteless entree.  Was it worth the $10.39 price for a shrimp burrito??  Answer - hell no.  I didn't check in until afterwards so I missed out on this $2 off coupon which is what the regular price should be then mi us $2 more dollars.  The burrito was a tad soggy, beans tasted a tad like they were ""no salt added"" rejects from the factory.  The cashier was friendly.  They call u by your name instead of the numbers on the receipt.   They went from Louie to Lya.  Stick to receipt # unless your English improves. They also serve u thin, salt free chips which were decent.  I like the green sauce on salsa bar with cilantro/onion mix mixed together.  Will I be back???? Hmmm no.",tPIK3B7-Epk1JKe9GSJx2w,0,0,3,_9nJOlbgtPlPvdihq4Y36Q
