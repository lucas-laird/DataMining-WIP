All the nigiri was stellar, very fresh and flavorful. The shrimp tempura was cooked perfectly: The shrimp was tender and not at all rubbery, and the tempura coating was delicate. For dessert, they gave us a couple complimentary bites of honeydew melon. Prices were very reasonable and service was prompt and friendly. Some Japanese ladies were eating at the table next to us -- not a perfect sign of quality and authenticity, but a good one nonetheless. Highly recommended overall.",hoKqUvmU9iz_p6HsYdJmdw,0,0,5,1trd4N7gDjvy0MQdOKt58A

I'm Japanese, lived in both LA and Japan, and I've had sushi all over and Sushi Hagi ranks as one of the top places.  Definitely my go to place in Vegas.  I don't think I'll be going to any other sushi restaurant in Vegas, ever.  The restaurant is located in kind of a run down strip mall and the interior is nothing fancy.  If you're looking for a fancy setting, I would recommend a sushi restaurant located inside one of the fancy strip hotels.  If your taste is for delicious authentic Japanese sushi, Sushi Hagi is the place.  What a value!  The sushi itself is delicious but the fresh wasabi the chef serves takes it to another level.

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  I was there with my wife and two year old daughter and they were very child friendly.  The chef made sure my daughter's food came out first to keep her busy so that we could enjoy our food.

We will definitely be going again on my next day off.",alqn0SpTY4sQtWauGGLV4w,1,1,5,pVbs5Hxzt-SEQz3rJaEdSw

We were there last night and asked about the 'new place' next door. We asked our bartender if she'd ever been there and she said no, but had a menu for us. We decided to give it a try.

We walked in and the lights were very bright (unusual for a sushi restaurant in my experience) and you could tell this place was new, only been open a little over a month. Superbly clean. They don't have their liquor license yet, but will by the end of the month. The waitress was EXTREMELY attentive and the rest of the staff nice as could be.

My dad and I got a few sashimi plates and a few rolls. The fish was SOOO fresh, it was incredible. Everything they use is fresh, even the spicy tuna they use on top of their rolls. They even had fresh grated wasabi (not paste); which is rare to find in Vegas unless you're at a 5 star sushi restaurant.. The sushi chef noticed my mom liked the way he prepared the cucumber for us, so he made her some cucumber art, it was cute (he also noticed she liked the paper crane drawing on the wall; he made her a paper crane). To complete the meal they offered us some melon to clear our palates. 

The inside of the restaurant is pretty bare, it's noticeable that they are a very new place. But the food speaks for itself. HIGHLY recommend. We will be going here WAY more often.",T5gGAHQDHefE662_UOE7jg,5,4,5,-uLg20RQpZZpJL5olN7x5Q

The owner, sushi chef, and waitstaff are all Japanese (increasingly rare in a city where the vast majority of Japanese restaurants don't even have ONE Japanese person and are staffed by Korean and Chinese).  Furthermore, every time I have been there, the majority of the customers were Japanese-speaking--and that says a lot.  All the food is fresh, carefully chosen and expertly prepared. The menu is very basic, but everything on it is correctly prepared, and you can eat in confidence that all the ingredients have been thoroughly checked for quality and freshness.  For example, this is one of very few sushi restaurants in the city where I would dare to order Uni, and it's one of very few where I am truly delighted with the Unagi.  Fried oysters are particularly home-made and delicious tasting.

Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and the place was nice and quiet with just a man at the bar and 2 other occupied tables.  The host/server was nice and she sat us down promptly.  

We ordered a 6 piece sushi course for about $13 and my husband ordered the 9 piece course for about $18.  The meal consisted of miso soup and, salmon, yellowtail, scallops, tuna, halibut, cucumber roll, tuna roll and octopus.  The quality wasn't the highest but, what really made it hard to enjoy was the incredible large amount of wasabi hidden in every piece.   It was beyond painful, and we had to disassemble each piece in order to scrape some of it off and still found it almost inedible.   

The server passed by several times laughing at our pain and tears and speaking to the sushi chef in Japanese.  I don't think she meant harm but really felt their take was that we have never had authentic sushi before.  In almost 20 years of trying countless sushi eateries, I have never experience this much pain so I highly doubt everyone else has been doing it wrong all these years.   

Great sinus clearing and tear action though, but that's not why I visit sushi joints.    Also expect a wait for your food as this is a 1 man operation.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,8,5,2,hDgyYqD2G0790AB60DxcnA

It's kind of a hole in a wall where it seems that not many people know about this restaurant. 

The establishment is small and very quiet. 
There's no music so its kind of intimate where you can only hear conversations.
There was a good amount of people there when we arrived on a saturday night, but had some seatings available still. They had us wait a couple of minutes so that they could put together a large table for us even though it was just four people, which was very nice.

Their menu is limited. Mainly sashimi, charashi, bento boxes and simple hand rolls.
I can say that they are an authentic japanese experience, because in Japan, they don't serve fancy or specialty rolls like they do over here in the U.S. They focus more on fresh fish rather than variety of sushi rolls.

We ordered the charashi sushi A combo, which comes with the chef's selections of fresh fish.
The food took quite some time to come out, but thats because he chef really takes his time in making the presentation beautiful and cutting all the seafood in perfect portions.
So you get a variety of seafood on a bed of rice, along with some cucumbers, radishes and sweet egg.

And let me just tell you, that the fish was absolutely amazing. Super fresh, super delicious.

And not to mention that they offered FRESH wasabi and regular wasabi. I've never really eaten wasabi, but it was a cool experience to try it fresh. It's definitely a different texture and taste. And it tastes a lot better too!

And the service was great. Our waittress made sure we had everything we needed, and checked up on us, gave us refills before we even made any requests. She was just very sweet.

Overall, if you want the authentic japanese experience and quality, then you must come here.

If you are afraid of wasabi and you are afraid of trying Sushi as the Chef makes it for you, just reconsider your life decisions.

The chef prepared everything to his own skill and preference. He makes his own unagi sauce from scratch, slices and chops his own fresh wasabi, etc.

We happened to scroll through yelp and find this gem. Thank you yelp, this is the best experience we have enjoyed in years. 

Every single variety of sashimi we tasted was heavenly. I hope you true sushi fans stop what you are doing and drive there asap.

The teriyaki is what you would expect. The bento includes things that are less commonly included like seaweed salad which is a nice touch. Miso tastes fresh and has actual green onions slices. They don't have any complicated American-style rolls, but they do have giant pieces of amazing fish quality. I tend to not order salmon in sushi restaurants, but their salmon has great flavor and melts in your mouth. The fresh wasabi is amazing and something you never get at this price point. 

The reason why I keep coming back to this place is the amazingly sweet server. They don't have fountain drinks, but if you finish your can she'll bring out a 'refill.' My table spilled a big beer and she brought over a little one to make up for it. I showed up twice in one day and the chef sent over a little something special.

I've seen monkfish liver on a lot of tv shows but it was my first time tasting it. They gave 3 thick pieces of monkfish liver with some vegetables.

First... I am a ""sashimi"" girl, not an AYCE or Special Roll person so this place is perfect for me!!!!   It's about the fish, not the sauce! Quality, not quantity. This place served me food that was fresh and clean and yummy!

The restaurant is spotless, the staff is lovely!!! Friendly, adorable, attentive without being annoying! And the food... OMG the food!!!!

I will say that if you want your ""special rolls"" full of sauces and seasonings that mask the taste of the fish then this is NOT the place for you!  This place is about the fish! Fresh and delicate and yummy. (Have I mentioned yummy?)

I ordered the grilled squid appetizer (a long-time, hard to find, favorite of mine) and the Chirashi Donburi (Bowl of sticky rice with various sashimi on top).  I originally ordered a different combination and the chef suggested ""not today... delivery wasn't good for that today""... He could have taken my money, substituted and I would not have known the difference being my first visit and because it is a ""combination"" but he wouldn't have it.   I love it when a sushi (or any) chef tells me ""no"".  That means they take pride in what they serve and will not serve you what they don't believe in.  

Every bite I had was delicious and made my eyes roll back. Even the ""condiments"" were above the normal bar.  Alongside my wasabi paste and generous serving of ginger was fresh grated wasabi!!!!  Mmmmm!

I ate way to much simply because I couldn't get enough!  I can't wait to return with friends in tow!

Summery:

Ambiance... Fine.  VERY clean, A little bright and the sushi bar is set low which felt a little odd but I got over it quickly!

Service:  Impeccable!  Enjoyable. Just the right amount of attentive!

Food: The fish was the freshest (other than the rare ""live"" find a a select few places) that I've had on the East Side.  The selection was awesome! The Prices were fantastic!

Upon entering,  we noticed a few Japanese speaking  customers on a few  tables and only one person at the bar. Perusing the menu, this is a traditional style sushi restaurant serving nigiri, cut rolls, chirashi bowls, not your typical AYCE joint serving up sauced up rolls with  flashy names, etc. Nope, no Western style sushi is served here folks!

Wifey went with a 6 piece chef's choice assortment , while I went with a 9 piece chef's choice assortment which both came with  miso soup. Wait times can be pretty  lengthy as there's only one sushi chef. My nigiri assortment consisted of scallop, ebi, hamachi, saba, salmon, ika, hirame, and TWO tuna nigiri which kinda sucked, because I also had a tuna cut handroll as well. So much for assortment...quality of the fish was not the freshest with the exception of the salmon,  but what made our visit  really go downhill was the chef's excessive use of the powdered wasabi paste.

Yes, traditionally, a touch of wasabi is placed on the sushi rice before the fish which should compliment the other components, but after 3 pieces of nigiri clearing the sinuses, watching the both of us tear up each time, I disassembled my other pieces, scraped all the wasabi off and reassembled each one. The sushi chef and waitress noticed this, and by this time we looked like a bunch of sushi rookies (We've sushi'd well over a hundred times!) and mumbled words in Japanese and chuckled about it.

Never in any of our sushi experiences was it ever torturous such as this one, and to top it all off, our waitress jokingly says ""Are you finished crying?"" REALLY??? No return visit is planned, but if you do take your  chances here, just be weary of the chef's excessive  use of that harsh green paste if and when  ordering nigiri. ALOHA!!!

We ordered the sashimi combo large and chirashi (b). Both dishes had great presentation. Personally, I think the chirashi (b) was better value. It came with pieces of uni and fatty toro if you're into that. As an added bonus, we had fresh wasabi.

The energy it takes for a little lady to tackle parties of 12 and still personally take my order and make me feel like I've been eating here for years. The 40 years of experience in doing it right with Japanese style sushi shows like it is second nature for Chef Tsukada. Now, the food was so good I came back the next day and ordered the same thing to go. And that was so good I came back two days later and ordered the same thing again, And all these times the lovely, motherly server told me to come stay for dinner for the true experience.  She was right. The ambience is absolutely comfortable and appealing.

I have to admit, my appetizer ( the most beautiful breaded fried Kumamoto oysters with a little citrusy salad and a mustard wasabi sauce that I begged for more of the second time) made it home the first time but since, never left the parking lot, as I devoured them in the car. And the Salmon Ikura Don (Fresh Salmon over Sushi rice with Salmon Roe and a fresh wasabi that had to be explained to me,  it was so hot) seemed like a dish made just by my specifications and love for salmon.

You can see the chef preparing the food and can tell he has been doing this for a long time. To me, its very reassuring when you see someone like him in the kitchen.

The server was amazing. I didn't get her name but she is older and makes you feel like you are a guest in her home. 

She had the eel roll which was delicious and I'm not a fan of eel. I had the spicy tuna roll and the tuna collar. The chef only uses the highest quality sushi available and it shows.everything we ordered was delicious.

She also brought us some fresh wasabi, it was amazing and blows away the paste you see everywhere else.

I have to say, the tuna collar was the best I have ever had. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly, so moist and juicy. I did my best to eat it with chopsticks but my Italian upbringing took over and I had to just dig in and use my hands. I might have looked like a neanderthal but it was worth every delicious bite.

They so t have very many rolls listed on their menu, but they waitress explained everything on the menu without us even asking, she also told us that if the roll is t listed they are happy to make anything!",O7vhPiaWiyS6fBnLKuhvtg,0,0,5,CFvkLyKDqGJZcbrLmukHlw

Not the paste imitation most sushi places have. I almost cried when I tasted it, so spicy. Lol. I think it was the owners who served us and they were very sweet and kept checking us if we were okay. Highly recommend trying this place out!",F6bfLeuvoBu35rWMoFybMw,0,0,5,vSXjV5hkSwscINT81ZO2xg

It was really busy, but the chef & waitress made me feel like I was the only person there. The chef checked on me to make sure I was ok and offered me so many free bites I couldn't finish my bento box. I love this place!

Update 10/21/16
They've changed. They have new management, much higher prices, new furniture and lighting. It was good while it lasted.",efloHFA5jEL3P-9Kmla4vQ,6,0,5,VP8-D2S0WBS6577Sk5vdRg

5730541,2016-02-11,0,Dcu698L9WArPRc9mAYrAzA,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! I have always gone to places like Sushi Fever, and I love sushi, when I wanted quality sushi. Sushi Hagi's fish is some of the freshest I've had ever. 
I have to admit, going there for the first time can be a little intimidating if you're used to the all-you-can-eat type of places, or places that have a lot of California rolls, and roles drenched in mayo-based sauces. We asked a lot of questions, our waitress  was informative, and gave us time to figure out what we wanted. We started with a three piece tuna appetizer with fresh wasabi. The stuff just melted in your mouth. We also had some yellowtail, a spicy tuna roll, and yellowtail roll with green onions. My wife ordered a two piece of eel towards the end of the meal. The eel sauce was made by the sushi chef, and it was delicious. It was not as sweet as the sauces you find throughout the valley, but had a lot of flavor. The sushi chef said when he makes the eel sauce he reduces it on the stove for over six hours. 
I'm looking forward to going back and I'm glad I found a high quality sushi place within walking distance from my house!",daq7PVTUQUYO1Kks4qSD-w,0,0,5,F1tcXggkHhsOMaMrsVLQpA
5773734,2016-02-20,3,Dcu698L9WArPRc9mAYrAzA,"Wow lots of 5 star reviews for this place. It's hard to earn 5 stars from me, but I will give it 4.5 because its a nice little mom and pop type place, with good friendly service, and very tasty food. It wasn't too busy at 5:15pm on a Friday night and while there there was a steady stream of diners. They have seating for 30-40 but it never filled up which is good, because I think only the chef and his wife were working.  It's a small, simple menu. They have a board with daily specials that I assume rotate. Prices are fair. Limited selection of beers and sake. Soft drinks are in the can which is nice. 2nd can no charge. 

Items ordered.
Salmon teriyaki bento box - a smallish portion of salmon but cooked perfectly. The breading on the tempura was light and crispy, very good. Miso soup wasn't overly salty like some, a nice mild flavor. 4/5

1/2 roll special - Half sushi rolls of philadelphia, rainbow, spicy tuna, california, and a couple others I forgot. Nice fresh fish, only the philly roll was missing either cucumber or avocado. Enough for me to be full on, for $14.50. 4.5/5

During our meal the chef presented us with a complimentary hunk of tuna in ponzu sauce. Delicious! 

I love the charm of this place. Simple, clean, and delicious! I'll be back often to try out the breaded pork and chicken katsu.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,3,4,6na_iDO5dPF353MXvWcWuw

Finally, an escape from the typical Vegas all-you-can-eat fancy sushi place leaving-you-cursing-and-screaming-with-regrets-but-you-can't-because-rice-is-clogged-in-your-mouth-nostrils-and-throat.

I ordered Chirashi bowl, served with regular and ""fresh"" wasabi. 
Man, that ""fresh"" wasabi burns. It can burn your sunburn!

Place is nothing close to fancy. Small, kinda ""karinderia"" but homey because the lady server was friendly and nice. She explained what she just served even if she was a bit struggling with English; and after being burnt out from work for the past couple of days, having someone serving you oranges, tea and soda refills (mind you, the refill is in can. She didn't bother asking me if I want another one. She just put it on your table with a big smile) made me wanna give her a big hug. 

Aside from the Japanese chef and server, only few people come here. Not everything is on the menu. You have to look at the small board by the entrance to see what else they offer. 

So 2 bites left on the bowl, I ordered fried oysters. Haha! Not as good as the Greenville version, but it is still surprising how it was made and presented. 

Price is reasonable.

The place is small even the Chef bid goodbye when I left.

Definitely a hole in the wall.",tqMkymonhtjvb-j12VwJGA,0,0,5,Vs7UDXTjisvR_71X-hEPHA
5836657,2015-05-28,0,Dcu698L9WArPRc9mAYrAzA,"Amazing place! We originally came thinking that the business that had originally occupied the space was still there, and weren't really looking for a sushi restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is incredibly clean, having only opened about a week ago, and beautifully decorated. The owners were amazing, so hospitable and kept checking on us to see if we needed anything. 
The sushi chef is so talented. My dad and brother ordered the Chirashi ""A"", which included fish, hokigai, egg, tobiko, shiitake mushrooms, and much more, all on a well-seasoned bed of sushi rice. They both praised the way the fish and other items were handled and presented. It was an amazing amount of food for such a reasonable price. 
My mom and I ordered the teriyaki chicken. Although not on the printed menu as of the time of this review, neither of us eats sushi and inquired if there was anything else that was being served that may not have been on the menu. They were happy to tell us that there was the chicken that the chef could make for us. The chicken was tender and the sauce was the best I've had in a long time. The portion size was much more than either of us could finish on our own and we probably could have shared a serving. 
Miso soup was included with all of the meals and the iced tea was made fresh. They also offered us ice cold watermelon to complete the meal. 
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for sushi lovers and even those who don't. We were told that they're working on expanding their menu and it should soon include items that are not sushi. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with the owners. They were incredibly nice and attentive. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Sushi Hagi. We're hoping to be able to go there again before we leave Las Vegas next week. It's definitely a surprise find and one that we're happy to share.",BeDfEK3qeIdnmwjnGFa8xg,4,0,5,ZJ_kDfVPEAcBTl289wEurw
5911016,2016-04-09,1,Dcu698L9WArPRc9mAYrAzA,"I wanted to judge this place, I really did. It's located in a run down strip mall and when I arrived on a Friday night, surprisingly few guests. The decor has a slight sterility and it's quiet enough to hear any other conversation in the room. 

I began to get nervous, but ordered two Chirashi bowls and a grilled squid.  Within a few minutes I felt like we were being served by family. As the Japanese are not known for being overly or ingeniously friendly, she truly just made me feel at home - even sharing details about how she cooks and which shitake mushrooms are best in what dish.

The fish was phenomenal. Hands down the freshest sushi I have had in the desert. The chef takes time to make each meal with care and thought. Yes, you can taste the love. His experience as a third generation sushi chef shows, he is a one man show cutting up his own whole fish and making his own sushi rice. 

There are only quality cuts and dishes - so this is not an AYCE establishment. No mayonnaise sauce and fried breadcrums. Still, I left satisfied and felt like I made a new friend.

If you try this place out, keep an open mind and be careful with that fresh wasabi  (really, it's no joke). They also have a specials menu but you need to ask about it. It's on a board too, hidden to your right when you first enter.",u78hzZ5zaaz0Afht2PdEOA,2,2,5,SZtC5XftDivv7_BFBZrH0w
