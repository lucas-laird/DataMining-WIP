If you're used to Pizza Hut, you're used to a different kind of pizza.  Mama D's pizza is New York style, thus the East Coast transplants (like me) probably appreciate pizza that reminds them of what they grew up with.  The services isn't the fasted and your food might take a little longer than expected, but as the sign says at my mechanic, "" You want it cheap, good, or fast?  Choose 2.""  Mama D's is good and pretty well priced.",ltBVRx7tRA5SPRFFQCORCg,1,0,4,4D6XqkDgdRS3GyY40O36FQ

It took a while to get our food and while we waited, we watched a lot of confusion in the kitchen. I thought we made a big mistake coming here, and I didn't know how much longer for food and what type of quality to expect.

Well...we were pleasantly surprised. One of the guys in the kitchen brought our food with plates, and both wings and pie were really good! So, I'd recommend Mama D's, but be patient.",EKjz04bbBgteLCpmPnc0QQ,0,0,4,L7QfQqYWDXc2ztaU4kRGSA
613002,2012-09-16,0,PS6MUV_adG5JH3SZ4e_sCQ,"We get a pizza from this place about once a week. The cheese tastes so fresh--much better than nearby competitors (such as the one up the mountain with a feminine name--I think you can guess it), and the sauce is very tasty--lots of oregano. The crust is usually crispy and chewy; some days it's ""puffier,"" which is how we like it. What we like is that the crust has a crisp to it that other places don't. Dear Mama D's--please keep that crust--it's especially good when it's risen and gives a nice puffy edge around the pie. The price can't be beat for an 18"" with two toppings. Luckily, we live about half a mile away, so it's always piping hot when we get it. Seems the quality control has improved a lot since it first opened. Too bad they're not open on Sundays--because nothing goes better with NFL football than pizza. Maybe they will expand their hours.",Abu9cB0b9wJV3YoOz4LS-w,0,0,4,UjqlWptkrNh7-jK_Oh_GQQ

The garlic knots sucked compared to what they were before, the chicken wings I ordered mild and they were HOT, the gnocchi was nonexistent along with the shrimp scampi since they have now shortened their menu by half.

We ordered the chicken piccata which came with two chicken breasts and roasted potatoes and broccoli and a side salad. My husband ordered a deli sandwich with a side salad and we ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza. It came out to $40 and there was so much food. The picatta was delicious lemony and with just the right amount of capers and seasoning. 

I wish we had a place like this closer to home. I'll just have to try to recreate the chicken piccata because it was delicious.",HtvCanVKlvBxblg1kGIbMQ,0,0,4,EYxocCXUC6UMpSASy5OAqg

2000535,2011-08-10,0,PS6MUV_adG5JH3SZ4e_sCQ,"I wanted to order pizza for dinner and was too lazy to go somewhere and pick it up. Thus, I wound up ordering from Mama D's. Plus, I've passed by it several times and had wanted to try it out.

I used their online ordering system and received an email confirmation letting me know the approx. delivery time was 7:35pm (over an hour later).

Around 7:45pm, I called to check on it and make sure they received the order and everything since the pizza had yet to be delivered. They said they had received it and it was out for delivery.

Around 8:15pm, I called again and was again told that it was out for delivery.

At 8:35pm. I called again (after all, it was supposed to be delivered by 7:35pm) and was told this time that my order was never received. The staff person was very nice and apologetic, but that was it. No offer of anything to make up for it. I placed an order for a new pizza and it was delivered about 35 minutes later.

I ordered the NY-style pizza with a couple of toppings. It was ok, but I wouldn't ever order it again. It definitely was not NY-style. And the toppings were practically whole, not sliced or chopped.

Perhaps dining-in would have been a better experience? Perhaps the non-pizza items are better? I'm just not sure after this 1st experience that I would bother trying.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,1,0,2,QXaociYfci1pnC8UABcryg

Like I said though, the pizza was good. I used to order the pizza dinner special on nights when I didn't want to cook. Then, the last time I tried to order, they told me I lived too far away. Claimed it took the driver 45 minutes to deliver. I'm not sure what way he went, but he must be a moron. Anyway, not a nice way to treat your loyal customers.

Sausage was better than pepperoni and most sodas have unlimited refills. The order took a little long to get to my table, but they do make it fresh.

I missed the lunch special by 5 minutes (11:00 AM - 3:00 PM) and had to pay a bit extra, but that is okay. My total was $16 for two people. I know I will be back here for more food and to review the other dishes.",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,4,3,3,L9NeCny5GQd7qd7dzbMfhg

 Pizza came at 6:22. No Parmesan or chilli pepper. Boo! Soda was cold. Pizza was barely warm...almost cold. Heated up a piece in the toaster oven. It was ok. Fresh veggies. Pretty big slices and, ya, it's New York style. For the price it was decent. 

Very medium, hence the medium rating. I'll try somewhere new next time. I'm still looking for that go-to pizza delivery. But, if I can't find anything really great...I'd more than likely order here again.",vikFX67phQg5XPjSocckCA,1,0,3,DiXcwssqNYPFDabjaRgxhw
4059618,2011-08-26,0,PS6MUV_adG5JH3SZ4e_sCQ,"I've been here twice, once with my guy and once with my mom. They bring out really yummy hot bread with butter before the meal, and even as a bleu cheese hater, I stole some of my mom's dressing because it was homemade and delicious. So, 2 stars for salad and bread.

I'm not picky about where I sit in a restaurant (I'm not that jerk who insists on a booth with my nose turned up when I walk in) but the tables in this place are super impersonal and small. I felt kind of... crunchy and exposed to the group of loud men sitting 7 inches away from my table at the next table.

The first time I ate here I had a meatball sandwich. The second time, spaghetti with meat sauce (which turned out to be crumbled meatballs mixed in with the sauce.) both times it was good, but even as a garlic lover, the garlic is overwhelming. Seriously, guys, those meatballs are a nuclear threat if the imbiber utters an H word. Your date will be giving you the side face ALL NIGHT LONG. You will reek of garlic for a month. Go ahead, argue with me that this won't happen because you love garlic and eat heads of it as a snack. try the meatballs. I DARE YOU. 

I thought the meat sauce would not have the garlic permeation of the meatballs, but the crumpled meatballs threw me for a loop. So here I sit, in a cloud of garlic odor... :) not getting any kisses tonight.

The service the first time I went in, was strange. Some guy was behind the counter and I told him I needed a second to order. So he sat 2 tables away watching me. Then asked 25 seconds later if I was ready. No. 20 seconds later, are you ready? jeez, I guess I'd better be... 

This time, the service was better although the server was having a hard time with a family who'd ordered 1 sandwich for 4 people and insisted on a free meal because the sandwich was ""wrong."" So she was flustered and unable to get to my table to check on us. which I understand.

You also get unlimited free bread as an appetizer.  Unfortunately, it feels very weird to be waited on in a small little area of 4 or 5 tables.  It just doesn't have the atmosphere Don Antonio's had.  Ordering pasta or lasagna to go feels weird to me as well.

For those who are ranking low due to the pizza....you are missing the point of don antonios.  They always had sub-par pizza.  The chicago style is halfway decent though.  You go to don antonios for the pasta, lasagne, and free bread.",Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,2,1,3,ctcS9KHW4O_srFzZZh58hw
