Upon entering, you load a Gameworks card which will cost you a one time $2 fee. Then, you can add points into the card. The deal I purchased was 120 points for $22. 

On Tuesdays they have double ticket earnings which is a great deal! I enjoyed playing everything from ski ball to Mario kart to pinball and basketball. They offer so many classic arcade games for few points. Ski ball was only 2 points per turn so you can imagine how far your $22 go. Plus, you received so many tickets for playing that the prizes to choose from at the end were not just limited to candy.",0UrlLMlUNQGU-O-iduRoag,0,0,5,bwxOP69QppwVOzq-55e4TA

We are locals and this was our 1st time going to Town Square and to Gameworks.   Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.  Next time we will spend a little more.  Overall this place is pretty cool.  My kids had fun and wanted to stay longer. On the next visit my husband and i will get some food and drinks while the kids go play.",WeDKeBEt3d8o9kk9vshOXg,2,0,4,4TjgQ2wpzhiljJCGTUxCrw

94831,2014-12-07,1,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"I brought my son and couple of his friends here after for the first time after a movie. When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be. 

But my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it's my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for ""adults"" then it shouldn't be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them.",Kf8F5gFrn0m9xOcdXf7uFg,17,0,2,edcqBx8nx8eC8TlOz8QOhg
100667,2017-04-25,0,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,Came here to check out the venue for a birthday party. However my experience wasn't so great. First off there was no changing table in the family restroom to change both of my sons diapers. Luckily I have my Phil & Teds stroller to convert into a changing table. second of all some of the games here are not well maintained. for instance the basketball hoops the staff does not ensure that each basketball hoops stall has basketballs. Most of the basketballs were gathered into one basketball stall. also the machines that are damaged keep taking the credits from the game card. Thus making it's an inconvenience in having to contact a staff member to reload the credits.

Games are always broken down, card readers have a serious issue of not reading or taking others credits. It's sad when a business like this isn't taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that's just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don't respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn't help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven't they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don't get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.

Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what's going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as ""Family Friendly"" as it seems.

I ordered a sandwich from their very limited lunch menu and when my food arrived it was not what I ordered and instead of fixing the situation, our server argued with me about how I ordered my sandwich. I'm sorry, but when I say chicken club that doesn't mean BLT on any planet.

The games situation... The space looks enormous, however looks can and in this case are deceiving. The assortment of games is very small and the ones that most patrons want to play are broken.

The service at dinner was great.  The server acknowledged they had only been open for about three weeks, and they were continuing to take any feedback to improve the experience.  

The shareable crab cake was delicious, but the portion needs to be shipped off!  If you get it,  don't feel ashamed to be a bit greedy as the $14 cake is just that, one expensive cake!  HOWEVER,  the chicken nachos!  You can't go wrong!  

 The entrees were interesting.  I got the beef rib dish.  It's not something usual for me, but I took the server's advice (he was a good guy).  I found the meat to be a bit fatty.  I found enough tasty pieces to satisfy...  The most unsettling part of the dish was the way the meal was garnished.  Imagine the sword in the stone...  But it was the rib-bone jammed into the pile of wasabi mashed potatoes.  Different.

The beer selection was ok...  Just too expensive (I understand the place is on the strip).  I think I could have walked across the way to a competing place, and it would have been more affordable.

The game variety was fun (I stink at video games) ,and I enjoyed pinball.  The pacman air hockey will either make you pull a muscle or lose an eye!  It is not to be missed!  

After speaking to a few staff members, it's clear they are working to adjust things.  I'll give them a few weeks and will try them again.  

Be patient!  I think the place will compete for your attention soon!  Huge TV and video walls will be sure have your favorite sports games available.

Each game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing. 

The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.

There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.

As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.

I've been to the old gameworks on the strip, which was pretty old and dank, but was two stories.
I don't see them having enough business to pay for the strip's rent, so I understand.

Moving to the Town Square is a great move.


Pros: 

- Love that they were open until midnight. Went to a movie at 10:45 and wanted to kill time before.
-It was pretty fun 
-The prizes really are better than most places (keep in mind, most prizes are for kids, and kids love these weird prizes)
-Bowling looked pretty cool, didn't see prices though

New ticket system could be seen as pro or con.
All tickets go back on the card

Cons:

-NOTHING FREAKING WORKS. I mean seriously. You just opened.
There is about 7 basketball games, only two worked.
-Operator didn't work (wish I could play that)
-2 wheel spinning games didn't work
-Spaceballs worked and then would flash out of order, then work again.
-Tetris style game didn't work
-A couple of games ate our game card points and didn't work
-A few more games didn't work.

A total of about 1/3 of the games didn't work which is pretty lame since it is really busy in there.

-It definitely should be bigger with more games.
-The gameperks doesn't work here because ""their system isn't synced""
-They are very very slow. Workers took a long time to load points on the cards, one time was out of printer paper and wouldn't let people buy cards for about 20 minutes.
-VIP members have different credit pricing but we can't get the VIP member pricing?

We spent quite a bit of money here for a birthday.
About $130 and got about 8,000 tickets (which are all kept on the card)
Used 3200 for a giant lego pillow (cooler prizes than most places)

If your going to be stuck up about it go try and find some where else with all the awesomeness build in one place.. And when you do please let me know.. 

But till then Long Live Gameworks!

Whats not to love.  Played almost every game in the place with there unlimited hour game card.  Really fun games.  Lots of choices.  Dark escape 4D is by far the tightest game there.   I could play that for hours.  
The food I thought was average bar food.  Had the buffalo wings.  Nice size wings, perfectly cooked crispy yet juicy inside.  Could of been a little spicier and saucier.  But still really good. Would order again.   Wasn't sure how it would be with all the negative reviews.  But I'll be back for sure.  Cool place to catch a NBA game.

We were here before and they just lost their regular customers. Fire the main manager and promote the assistant.

We went over and the first employee we saw just stood there and looked at us before pretending she didn't see us, so I asked if we were supposed to seat ourselves. She said no, that we would be seated by ""them"". She actually walked us around the corner to where someone would take us to a table and give us menus, only she stood there talking to the two people who were there for a while. One of the other people finally looked over and asked if we wanted a table, we said yes and she said ""oh"". Then she went back to what she'd been doing when we first showed up. Finally, she got us some menus and took us to our table, where we sat and waited a while for someone to come over just to get drink orders. It wasn't even busy there, maybe four tables with patrons and they had a staff of at least six, not counting the kitchen.
Just some side notes; the table they sat us at was not clean, it took forever for someone to take out order, the order was mixed up a bit by the server, and it took a while to get our bill.
The food was pretty decent, but the service sucked. When we left, we got some dirty looks from the staff members we'd  had interaction with, probably because I didn't feel compelled to leave extra money for the awful service. Instead, I left a note kindly asking them to improve their service.

A lot of the 2-player shooting games are missing one gun,so you can't play them together. 

They finally  got a dark ride, and I have always loved that attraction. It's fun, but too short. I'm glad I got to try it here while it's still new, before it looks like the rest of the building.

The new Townsquare GameWorks is none of those things. This location is an offense to the reputation they've built.

Food: 0/5. It didn't get my sick. That's the absolute best thing I can say about it. The Nachos and Pizza were far, far worse than 7/11. Yes, the pizza you get at 7/11 is leaps and bounds better than what's served at the Town Square GW. The Nachos were better in Middle School. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's edible

Service: despite half the restaurant being empty, the server informed us it would be a 20 minute wait. When I pointed out that fact that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, she told me she was short of servers and just couldn't do it(I've worked in two high end restaurants in my life, and that is pure comedy.) There was one large party, and five other tables. I saw a minimum of five servers. There was enough staff to cover a 50 table restaurant and they made us wait so the servers wouldn't get stuck with more than a couple tables at a time. I talked to the manager who at first seemed to be shocked, then did nothing about it. The server was fairly polite but the host and manager ruined it.

Arcade: Decent. Far below the other GWs I've been to.

There's a reason there was no adult parties here alone. Only kids or parents with their kids. The service is God awful and the food is below gas station fare. The Seattle location is always packed and has more adults than kids. Take a lesson from them. 

If you've ever been to a chuckee cheese in the 90s, think of that, with way worse pizza, 5x more expensive food and gaming, and god awful service.",B301ufnpl7TUsY0Im88qrg,14,1,1,42z8mHvkZLUu0JYlC1omhQ

The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for ""The Color of Money"" so no worries.

Keep you gamecard so with the next visit, you can reload the card and not pay for an extra.

If you plan on spending some time at the bar, plenty of TV's!! The food is rather pricey, so I'd recommend waiting till happy hour (starts 9pm)

We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule. They weren't exactly stellar cocktails, but they were tasty enough. On the menu are several items where, if you order them, you can opt to pay more and get a 1-hour game card. This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before. In addition to skee ball and some of the other usual suspects, there was also a motion roller coaster ride and a 4D scary shooting game one.

They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree. 

There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive.

By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!

I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!

The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.

The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done. 

I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good. 

If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks.

I saw on at least 3 different occasions where a 2 person shooter game only had 1 gun..  We sat down on another 2 person game, and the start button only worked for one player. The calibrations were off on a couple games (shooting far left, and the crosshairs are all the way over to the right).  The basketball games with their sad, deflated basketballs, with pieces of the ball literally falling off. The one football game that did work, again had sad deflated footballs. However, I did see Tom Brady playing the game, and those deflated footballs really sent him over the top for the high score. This place is literally the biggest joke, and saddest excuse for an arcade that I've ever seen. This is Las Vegas... get your stuff together!

They have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.

Food is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.

1. Space too small
2. Too much empty space in the front area so it seems like

    tell you:
    a. Can't collect the tickets from games
    b. Can't play the ""win a prize"" games

I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.

We ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good. 

The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater.

The selection of games is very poor. They had several riding/driving games. And they were the standard run of the mill fast and the furious type. There was one that the steering wheel was stuck and we couldn't play it because we couldn't steer. Wasted money on that one. The other ones we played the steering was too loose and you ended up all over the place but not on the course. 

The only race game worth it was Mario Kart. 

There was three fighting games. Tekken was good as always. Marvel vs Capcom machine was shot. The screen was messed up and couldn't be played. Didn't even get to play. Street Fighters joysticks were busted and couldn't be used to do anything but random forward and back. 

Pinball machines were meh. Ghostbusters was the highlight here. The Game of Thrones one was missing it's glass panel where the artwork goes. 

The hunting shooting games didn't seem calibrated. Also we inserted our cards in the cabella big game hunt game and the system rebooted and we lost our credits. Just walked away from that one.

2585746,2015-02-21,0,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Review of the New GameWorks Las Vegas by Mother of three boys.

I signed up online for GameWorks rewards program a week before we left on our trip and received a free $10 game play in my email inbox (sweet)
My first impression of the new town square location was that the shopping center had plenty of parking and high end shops and out door play spaces for kids.
Inside the Facility seems much cleaner, and brighter than the old basement style location on the strip, that we had visited for years prior to it closing. 
This location seems much less busy right at the opening versus in the afternoon hours on the weekends.

The Party/Restaurant area:
We had drove from out of state to celebrated my oldest' s birthday here. Birthday parties have many options like: dedicated packages with your own room or u can reserve a table in the restaurant area. 
We chose a table and added balloons, Andre was our server. I remember this because he was just so friendly and attentive! I felt like we were his only party.. Which we were not! 
There was two other large groups having parties the same time. It was not bad thou.
There is no dedicated ""kids menu"". However we found the Pizza and GameWorks nachos are large enough for kids to share or for an adult as a meal. (The steak on the nachos was very tender and was flavorful.) Each of these seemed kid friendly and were a part of the Play and Eat combo menu (so you could have opted to get a 1 hour timed game card for about $2.99 more if you were coming outside a party package- plus $2 card activation if it's your first time getting a card). 
However the other menu items are mostly adult game day kind of foods or high end restaurant type meals, that would be great for a night watching sports/ or a girls night out. Not a lot of options small kids ( like hotdogs, mac and cheese etc.) I am usually an avid ""Yelper"" and had been slightly concerned prior to our arrival, about food quality and service, due to some older reviewers. My mind was quickly changed! 
I had to talk with the chef in advance of ordering because of food allergies and he was very professional and reassuring.  He said they had a new menu starting presidents day with several new items ( like mac and cheese balls), and that the kitchen had changed a lot since opening ( which happens a lot now that I think about restaurants I frequent). He was right that things must have changed, because the quality far exceeded the reviews I had read. I had no problem getting food everyone could eat (despite allergies) and Andre refilled my drink 4 times in the 40 mins. we sat to eat.
       
Inside the Arcade:
Family friendly atmosphere; Plenty of room for our stroller. We even saw a few double strollers while we were there! The family bathroom has a koala changing station. However no place within this bathroom to toss a dirty diaper, other than the tiny hand towel basket? (Hopefully they invest in a solution in the future)
For kids of all ages; The game floor seems to consist of several ""zones"": Many large ride on/in games, A row of bloody shoot up games , Massive flashy ticket games, A ""eSports"" LAN room which is quiet, dark and filled with a gamers wildest dreams worth of P.Cs and gaming systems, and lastly the bowling ally ( which I will go into more detail on later).
GameWorks did not disappoint with more than enough things to keep everyone entertained for five amazing hours that just flew by.
We had so much fun on the floor with timed cards we returned on the 15th for a second day, to allow for time in the eSports room for my older boys.

eSports/ Bowling Alley:
I inquired about the package options here as well for his party next year, and decided that's what we will plan for, for next time because of the value and option of pc based games like Minecraft. 
While here they spent 2 hours playing diablo 3 and mine craft.
Overall all boys had to be dragged out in the end they were having such a good time, look forward to many visits in years to come!",ryCOvuEBv89NxHk5YsMDjg,0,0,5,XhsH-yk7jBneRYvUDJZCRw

We had a good time on all the interactive games that were for the most part easy to understand and play for the little ones.  I do think that they could have used a few more pieces of equipment.  I understand that many of these machines cost as much as your moms Hyundai.  These machines are also very tempermental and see nothing but abuse from these super nerds who live in solitarey confinement playing Xbox 360 and only come out for cheesy gordita crucnches from Taco bell and a new Maxim magazine to masturbate to. 

 This is a tough crowd to please.  My suggestion would have been to put in a Jack In the Box for gamer dietary needs, instead of another sub par restaurant with high prices.  This is the last thing Las Vegas needed.  You could have used that huge dining space to put in more revenue..... or credit generators. Gameworks you are located in one of the highest rent districts in all of Las Vegas.  You have come up with away to quickly ROI for the $500,000 in equipment you purchased.  Take a lesson from the nightclub industry the way to make money is on the booze.  Bottle Service!!! and VIP AREA!!!

The funnest game they had was the Pac Man air hockey.  We could have played this the whole time.  We will be back. It might be a while but we will.  Good luck to you Gameworks.

The company is always adding new games.  Last time I went there (last week), I found a new Kung Fu Panda game which was ridiculously fun.  

There's a pretty good computer/lan center that hosts video game and computer game tournaments.  I'm pretty sure they do Hearthstone tournaments every other Sunday.

The one thing I'm still wondering is when I signed up for ""four free hours"" of computer time during the midnight League of Legends of event, I never received those free hours the next time I came back.  

Other than that, there are a good amount of games to win tickets and the prizes are great if you have a kid.  I've already won a giant care bear for my daughter.

2716945,2015-12-28,4,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!

If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.

I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,7,4,3,r7sbxrOLqNqGrB5tU2MikA

I paid $54 for 400 credits for future use.  The menu looks appetizing, but way too expensive.  I got one draft beer and it was $7!  The best part of this location?  It is right across the sidewalk from Yard House.  We will likely use GameWorks as entertainment for our kids while my wife and I hit happy hour at Yard House.  Unless they come up with a happy hour with major discounts, I will never buy food or drink here.

We came to Game Works for some food and to play a few games before going to the movies. The food here is not bad, we did the food and play special which allows your unlimited games for the amount of time you choose.

2759611,2015-07-07,14,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Saw a Groupon special for these guys. 20 bucks for an all day play card plus a 10 dollar gift card. I immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10. Thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday. Yes I can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that's not my gripe.

My gripe is that a lot of the games were not working. I would say about 40 percent were out of order. Even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at. Another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases, they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time. There should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion.

I also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons. This did not bother me at all. Again, since some of the games were out of order, the kids tried to make the most of it. Even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3. Looking around I saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade. 

After about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home. Memo to the Gameworks staff. Dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke? At least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade?

I am so disappointed from our visit that I dont see any reason to come back here. You guys should change your name to ""Gameswork"". Because after coming here I am left scratching my head thinking do any of the ""Games Work?""

I'm comparing it to a place I used to go to that had games & food but was a hot spot to hang out at night! Took my 10 year old boy cousin and he had a LOT of fun!! From racing/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good! 
Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were ""out of service"". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design.

Nope. Plain. Not going to send them back again. Granted, the fries, even plain were good fries. The chicken wings were delicious, got 3 flats, no drummettes. The mozzarella cheese sticks were delicious. Perfectly seasoned. Did not need any marinara. Stuffed fried raviolis were not good imo. I can't explain it just that the beef didn't taste like beef. Chicken fingers were good. Grilled cheese was good but the quesadillas were dissappointing. The potstickers were good in flavor but maybe need a little longer in the fryer as the inside was cool and mushy. The fish and chips were perfect. Wish they had tartar sauce or malt vinegar to go with but they don't. Our server brought us an aioli sauce that was pretty tasty with the fish. We ordered waffle fries to go with it but they were really hard. I recommend sticking with regular fries. Also, I want to point out that our server Courtnie was courteous and polite and when I sent back the parmesan fries, I asked her not to take the entire platter of apps back with her so we could start eating as we were starved. As we were asking for our bill, a large party of about 9 people were seated next to us. By the time we paid our check and we're leaving, maybe 15-20 minutes, they were already eating. Not sure why we were unlucky to have to wait so long. 

Games:
40% of the games we wanted to play were out of order. We played the Pacman air hockey game a few times and it was great fun but when we went back to play it again it was out of order. Sucks because my daughter is limited to what she can play due to being in a wheelchair. Lots of the games require you to transfer into a seat or are on a platform that isn't accessible and those that aren't were limited due to so many being out of order. I was happy to see Pinball machines and show my kids how to play it. I believe there were 6 machines but only 3 were working properly. We ended up leaving with 416 minutes of unlimited play still on our card.",WC1QjEVkGosEW1dmX3ZGrA,1,0,1,YW8MP5M5aRQs89LZGGzM9w
2774506,2014-08-04,0,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Okay before i start this let me say that I AM glad that gameworks is back.  After nearly 3 years i really really....REALLY missed having it around.

Now let me begin...

First off, this place was a bigger letdown than i could've ever imagined. There couldn't possibly be any more than 45 arcade games on the game floor. The space that could be used to fit more game machines is currently taken up by over-optimistic restaurant space, unused party/banquet rooms and fancy looking walls. As it is at any gameworks a nice percentage of games were broken....but the difference between this gameworks and the others is that there's not much else to choose from....remember there's not even 50 machines on the floor which leads to my next complaint....a 2-3 person line to play literally any game on the floor. I'm not one to complain about waiting his turn, but this is a first for me at a gameworks. Arcade favorites like sonic the fighters, afterburner climax, marvel vs. Capcom, mortal kombat, street fighter, need for speed, f1 Ferrari challenge, and many many others are all MISSING from the roster. They used to be at the gameworks on the strip....i just don't understand why they wouldn't be here. The ticket/prize games are usually separated at most gameworks locations. Since this one is soooo tiny, they all just blend together. The prize redemption area is soooo small. I was tripping over small children and a couple of large, buff, angry dudes. Very uncomfortable...i never even got to choose my prize. More tickets for next time i suppose... Oh, and gamer beware. Many games will deduct points and the game will never acknowledge that you payed. Luckily the managers were able to see the cards swipe history and refund the card. in comparison to any other gameworks in the country....This game floor gets an F. 

The e-sports room is passable....literally...you can pass right by it and not even notice it's there. Its a decent price to rent an xbox and tv but honestly the game roster is small. I'm not sure if you can bring your own or not. Theres a total of 4 stations with televisions. Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents. They have a 60pc lan party...which is 40 less than what was advertised last year. Which reminds me...they told us on the gameworks facebook and website that there would be a laser tag arena.....which...there is none. Very disappointing. The e-sports will definitely bring in revenue. It just needs more games and console/tv stations. The e-sport section gets a C.

The bowling ally and pool table area is nice. And it has its own bar which is cool since you don't have to leave to goto the game floor for a drink. You rent your shoes at the door. The alley lanes are very narrow compare to say...the station casinos. They're basically miniature bowling lanes....i haven't played on the lanes yet so its not really fair for me to review it. Id say a B just because it exists.

Lastly, the overall service and restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant yet...and i don't believe i ever will. Allow me to explain. I asked the bartender at the bowling center for a glass of water. He immediately tells me itll be ""a while"" before he can serve me the water. Which is fine....note that he had a group of 3 people to serve before me and as soon as he was done serving them...""a while"" never came for me. No biggie. I guess good service is reserved for paying bar patrons. After spending 100 on points (which is ridiculous. I've never spent more than 40 bucks at any gameworks and i usually get hours of entertainment!) you'd think you would be treated half as decently as a hole in the wall bar. Later on i noticed i was hungry and i wanted something light, so i grabbed some wetzels pretzels which isn't far from gameworks.....BIG MISTAKE. I was just about halfway through my pretzel and walking back into gameworks when i was met with the most absurd statement: ""we don't allow outside food. Sorry."" excuse me? I just spent how much money.....to play broken games?! I'm sure you wont mind if i finish my pretzel while i walk through your precious, oversized restaurant past your pitiful, undersized gamefloor, and get in my car. Service gets a D. 

Worst gameworks experience I've ever had. I have been going to various gameworks locations since i was 9 years old. I'm 26 now. I've never seen anything like this. It's as if they only care about making money. I wish sega never sold gameworks to espn. I hope this helps them make better decisions in the future and fall back to their former glory! Long live gameworks!

In which her response automatically was ""Oh so you weren't giving me a $5 tip?"" Which turned me off because in all honesty I didn't like her tone or the way she was looking at me. Like I was ignorant or something.

I said ""Actually it would have been a $7 tip"" 
Which wasn't a problem, I'm literally keeping track of how much cash I spend. But when you get nasty attitudes then I no longer care about how you feel or what you say. 

And before I could finish what I'm trying to say she starts going on a rant about how usually people just give her $7 if the bill is $18 and if the bill was $15 people hand her $22.. okay that's cool and all however that's not what I asked you nor did I say anything about the amount of your tip I was asking how much cash I gave you. 

Then she continues on about bartending and tips I had to interrupt her because I've bartended too, I'm also a hairstylist and never do I ASSUME people are going to tip certain amounts because sometimes they don't and I don't get upset when people ask me how much cash they gave me. I just give them the answer.

My BF and I were playing a game and a lady approached and set her child down on the game next to us. He started crawling over to get to our game.. He even picked up our balls and while playing this fast paced game I hit him with my elbow. Complete accident. I did not think this lady was partially challenged enough to allow her child to run wild. I told her to move her child or it'll happen again, he's not my responsibility. She threw back some shade, so I told her to learn to be a mother. Later my BF and I are at the bar and he is standing next to me. The lady came by as if she was about to exit. She took her styrofoam cup and threw her drink on my BF. I got up and threatened her damn life. We called management and he had said she is here almost everyday and let's her kid run around and he felt too bad to kick her out. Mind you, she isn't paying to play ANYTHING. End of story, he comped us some games and the bartender was cool enough to comp us a drink. Well, I'm here right now and she's still here doing the same thing.

2970781,2014-08-05,6,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Oh man, I'm torn on this place. 

I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. 

They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have ""Donkey Kong"" and ""Centipede"", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most ""little"" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play ""Call of Duty"" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!

Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by ""Barcade"" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, ""One Moscow Mule please"". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. 

All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,12,5,3,Igp3jiy2LzBr_eTw8WRpeA
2975733,2015-12-04,8,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"I would originally give them 3 stars but after taking advantage of their new deal they offer on Thursdays, I would definitely say 4 stars! This deal I'm talking about is $10 for UNLIMITED game playing from 5pm-Close on Thursdays! Awesome! I feel like they read everyone's mind because it would always be kind of pricey to play before, I feel like $20 goes so fast here and I bet that's true for a lot of parents as well. So Thursdays is the way to go! The only catch is that the games that offer tickets, well you can still play them but they don't give you tickets. Makes sense, $10 is such a steal and then you get free prizes too? No way haha That's no problem for me since I don't really care about the prizes but that definitely could be an issue for the little ones. 
My favorites are the football throwing game, skeeball, air hockey, mario kart and this other game that you knock down clowns with balls in an alotted amount of time. Also out of all of the games offered I think there were only 2 out of order so that's not too bad. As for the unlimited game play, you can't use your card at the photobooth but I didn't have a problem using it with anything else.

When they called me about the bowling party (it took a few times for us to finally get in touch) they asked me to pick two colors for party decor. 3 days before the party, they ask if we want to add any other guests or party platters.

The party was $25/kid and included 90 minutes of bowling, shoe rental, party decor, pizza, cookies, & soft drinks. Each person who RSVPd also got a one hour game card that they could start whenever they wanted, as long as it was the day of the party. 

There was a lot of seating & tables for all of the guests. There was even a separate table for presents. Our party of ~20 kids got 3 lanes to bowl. The food that came with the package was good enough for the kids + a few parents. The only extra food we ordered were nachos. 

Ebony was our server and she was so patient and friendly with our big group of 8-11 year olds. 

A few things you should know:
The party does not come with invites; however the manager Janai sent me their logo to work with for some 'DIY' invites.
Their goodie bags are very pricey at $5/kid, but again, Janai kindly let us bring our own.

3063850,2014-12-08,0,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"This Gameworks location is great and is far better than almost any other arcade style restaurant venue anywhere near the vicinity of the Las Vegas area.  Of the comments by others that criticise this Gameworks, it is often that this location lacks some of the greatness of other or past Gameworks locations.  While some of that I agree with, the comparison should be Gameworks now compared to their competitors now, not Gameworks compared to themselves of the past.

The dining areas, bar areas, bowling areas, arcade areas, and the console gaming areas all look great.  The arcade prices generally are about four credits per game, which is one dollar with no promotions or bulk purchase of credits whatsoever.  Most generic arcades in the major hotels would have similar pricing, yet Gameworks provides a much nicer, friendlier and healthier enviroment than going inside a Las Vegas hotel/casino.  In addition, they have deals, 190 credits for $27, making that one-dollar game just 57 cents.  The pricing is good; I do not see where some of these complaints come from.  It is a far better value than Dave and Busters located throughout the country.

The Las Vegas design is different than many other Gameworks, but that is fine.  I personally do not understand the space given to console internet computer gaming, but that may appeal to others.  If that does not work out as expected, a great idea would be to expand the arcade space, which is what many arcade enthusiasts want to happen.  Maybe put in a clever time tunnel entrance and have some great, nearly forgotten games from the 80s and 90s in there that nearly no one has anymore (possibly locate a game list from when the first Gameworks opened, and replicate some of it).  If management wants an idea of games, I would be glad to submit some ideas, or go on killer list of videogames dot com for a blast from the past reminder of games that once existed.  Possibly, add a few more classic cabinets to overflow and transition between sections, so the place is not quite so compartmentalized.  All of this is not a complaint, just ideas to make this new Gameworks even better and enhance it with some classic nestalgia from Gameworks past.

In closing, Gameworks Las Vegas does not deserve an average rating less than four stars.  Those who live in the area should enjoy what it has to offer instead of comparing it to absolute arcade perfection.  Again, compare it to what little else is present in Las Vegas family fun, enjoy the games and the environment of fun that exists inside all Gameworks locations.  I do want to also mention that in my opinion many other Gameworks, current and past, deteriorated over time.  Please do not allow entropy to set in here, please keep the games well maintained and focus on customer service and Gameworks will do well.",hgAfKGJowMXeRYWgliczMA,0,1,5,fM0U0lYoQP-rJpUrylfeLA

It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new ""Recharge Center"" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great.

The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us. 

For food, we went with: 
- Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it

-Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect

-Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite

-Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyed

Overall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!

We added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.

As far as kids parties go in an arcade setting, I highly recommend. I loved how easy going, yet attentive the planners and staff were. A solid 4.5 kid's party.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,3,2,4,SSX2PU3BSkOHHp3XKH6X5g

I've been here before and the service on the restaurant side is less than desirable.  My most recent visit started of course walking to the front to be seated even though the tables are empty.  I was seated at a booth and there were crumbs.  As though the table was wiped down but some debris was left behind.  Adjacent to my booth was another booth with dirty plates/drinks etc. (like everyone placed the dirty dishes at one table to gather together).  Waitress proceeded to ""handle"" the dirty dishes then bring me water.  Didn't see her wash her hands, but she may have.

Food comes (not too long of a wait) and it's missing some stuff.  No biggy, just said hey, missing this and this.  I would of told the guy who delivered the food but he said ""food"" left the tray on the table and quickly left.

Keep in mind I'm still missing stuff from my food, the waitress has been told, then she goes to other tables.  Kind of hard to eat my salad without dressing.  I wait and get it, no big deal.

Food was ok, depending on what you get.  Better off eating elsewhere then going here to play games (assuming you have kids like me)

We asked three employees if it was accepted there because it's not accepted at some locations like Fry's or Whole Foods.  Every one of them said ""I'm not sure but we should take it"" rather than go find a manager and find out.

Anyway we sat down and the waitress (Erika I think) came over to get drink orders.  I ordered a water and she thought I ordered a latte.  My girlfriend ordered a diet coke and the waitress said ""Is diet coke OK?""  :(

Drinks come in the smallest glasses I've ever seen at a restaurant.  My girlfriend orders the pepperoni pizza and I order the steak frites.  It takes a bit too long to arrive, but it finally does.  There is no salt, pepper, or ketchup on any table so we have to ask for all of that.  The steak frites is supposed to come with a tangy ketchup but it is not on the plate so I ask the server about it and she says ""Um, we have buffalo sauce but that's for the wings and I don't even think that's very hot personally ha ha ha.""  I have no idea why she decided to respond to me that way, but whatever.

The fries are OK, the steak is actually pretty good, but my the pizza was very bland and tasteless.  It took way too long to get drink refills, and when we got them the waitress took our straws away and brought us new wrapped straws.  She also tried to pull a plate out from under me as I was still eating something on it.  Finally, at the end of the meal I have my payment card in my hand, all our plates are in front of us with the napkins and utensils on top and the waitress comes by and says ""Oh, do you want some more drinks?""  No I want to pay and leave!

We should have known we were in for a disaster when the poorly designed dining room (dumpy leather couch  from someone's dorm room in the way too-big waiting area?) only had one table of people at 8:30pm on a Friday night. But we had been looking forward to checking the place out for so long we let them seat us anyhow and tried to make the best of it by straining our necks to watch the too-small, misplaced TV's and ordering some food off of the very few options on their 1-page, Kinko's printed menu with too-small font. 

While waiting for our food, we watched the wait staff deliver a plate of nachos to an empty table by the front door/windows (where hundreds of people walked by, looked in at the boring scene, and kept on moving). The employees proceeded to grab a few nachos here and there every time they passed by, and a few even sat down to eat. I thought maybe they were off the clock until one of them left the nachos, went in the back, and came back out with our food delivery. 

The food was just so-so and not at all worth the price. I asked the server for some salt for my french fries and she dropped off an actual cup with salt in it and then started to walk off (as if this was the norm). I asked if there were any salt shakers, she said no, and then walked back to her own table of food. 

 I wish I could rate the game area but it's completely blocked off from the bar and restaurant (WHY??) and the dining experience was such a disappointing and boring downer that we decided to leave and head across to Yard House and Blue Martini to finish our date night instead.

I like Dave & Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails.  So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats.

After blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas.  They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews.  The problem was service.  Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress.  I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full.  Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.  

3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up.  I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill.  Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off.  We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up.  So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself.  The manager (Heather maybe) was on it.  She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room.  I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.  

While the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well.  I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something.  But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off.  That just really turned me off.  She never apologized for any delay.  Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers.  We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time.  That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert.  But she never checked in on us.

We will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks.  And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately.

Thankfully I only paid 24 bucks for both my sons but even that seems steep with what was offered. Lame experience overall and wouldn't recommend,8MID5mD-r6aVuf6cvMWj8g,0,0,3,FRVVunXVtLDWxqTtHrRvPQ

I don't feel like typing it all out again, but basically I'm giving the place five stars because I think it's a great addition to TS, and you can make a fun night of it between AMC, this, and Blue Martini. You could spend hours at TS because of those three places. Yes, some games were broken, but I'll give them a few months to work out the glitches. I also see the arcade expanding in the future because the restaurant doesn't seem to be that popular, but the rest of the arcade is. Peace.",UHFhOK5OTPFVK0g05QN9Yg,0,0,5,-ZA_Vj0Jit3xTEgxTmDvDA

Here's why Star is low , because when I got a credit back from manager from a broken game , he made no effort to place a sign on game so the next person wouldn't get ripped off. If I was close to game, I would tell a gamer not to play, but throughout time I was there , I saw several kids getting ripped off, but they would just walk away, I guess the manager knew that someone like me, asking for credit back was rare , so he was making money by just leaving game unfixed. Place stinks with odor, workers seem to not care, and manager acts like he's to good for his job. This place is just 'Hype'.",LExKqFQSCV989IhHr08z8g,2,0,2,TcUmflK5HzaL0-GeMenoQw

This new location is much smaller than the previous one located on the strip, however, you can still find something that everyone will like. The main gaming area has games that I haven't seen in any other Las Vegas arcades including ticket, shooter, driving, 4D, old school and Japanese games. They even have Purikura inside! There is a section for PC and console games as well as a section for bowling. The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating inside and outside of the store. The seats also aren't located next to the games so it's nice not having people constantly walk around you while you eat (unlike Dave and Buster's).

The only downside is that these games are expensive because you pay with ""points."" I suggest buying the package deal where you have unlimited play for 1 hour.

Nestled in the far back, at Town Square it is a hop skip and jump from the strip. But without all the foot traffic that crowds the strip. When you visit GameWorks it is located in an air conditioned large space where one does not have to worry about the sun until you leave!

The games that they offer here are great with a wonderful mix of Star Wars first player games, those famous cycle and driving games to sharpen going around that curve just right. 

This establishment is not just for children. Parents with children of all ages can come and enjoy all GameWorks has to offer. I have come here alone and with my twins when we're having family day. There is wonderful games where the family can all play the same game together or even play billiards as a family.

It is standard practice to purchase the red game card here for the best deal, I believe. I always load up with $20-50 and that will usually last a couple of hours. They have an email special that when you sign up they will give the guest a $10 game play no strings attached! Plus being part of the GameWorks email club they send all sorts of deals to your email that are very sweet. 

For those of us that are over 21 and need libations they have that covered too! They have a full service bar here! The bartender that took my order today was from Dublin and had an amazing accent. There are adults only pool here in the bar area.

This trip I did not eat off of the menu, but have in the past. The food here is pretty good. With a lot of the entree purchase there is an option to score a free game play card too! These are wonderful deals too!

4107141,2015-12-08,5,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under ""Gastropubs."" That's pretty generous.

I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.

Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.

I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as ""ground steak"" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.

I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.

As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.

I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16"") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.

I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,7,3,GtBI__wuRGjkarstl7oS1A

My husbands fish and chips were dripping with old oil.. But the kids seemed to like the chicken strips and French fries. I think the only thing that was okay to me was the calamari and aioli dip.

4132212,2014-08-22,12,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Yeah...

So Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great. 

I agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around. 

Staff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.

I walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack. 

The bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there. 

I know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations. 

I can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends? 

I wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!",VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q,18,11,2,zuovJUUpUIe9a6ZXOHtXPg

This one is cleaner, it seems bigger or maybe its just their set up is better but its really nice. They have a video game room with up to date video gsme consoles and computers. Very cool cause its like a kids lounge area where they can chill and play video games on couches and or sit at a computer at a desk and chair and play games on there. Also they have a small bowling alley. It was small but for the price it was pretty neat. Only a few dollars per game and shoes. All the games were fun. My daughter really enjoyed the ski ball the most. Some of the games that were more credits than the others was a little bit of s rip off and the way they kept track of your tickets made me wonder because its all on a card and my daughter played for a good hour and only ened up with a small amount of tickets so made me wonder how they track how many ticketd you get per game. But the fact my daughter was having fun made me not even car. She got about 500 tickets for the entired 3 hrs we were there. She got to get 3 small toys at the prize area. The lady said she was 20 tickets over with the one prize she picked out but she just let my dsughter have the small little cup she wanted. So that was very nice customer service.  I mean you figured if im spending $30-$50 for my 6 yr old to play games there the fact they let her walk with one small free gift shouldnt be a big deal since i spent more money on the games than the toys. Lol. The toy is worth less. I guess you're just pretty much paying foe the experience not the toys. Thats a better way of saying it. I will for sure go bsck again sometime.

FOOD is crap. They don't even have the option of getting a whole pizza like the old Game Works at MGM. Only a pan size personal pizza for $14. Nachos with ""string"" like shredded chicken which had no taste and hardly anything on them. 

SERVICE. Well, wasn't too great. Had to call her to order and since it was our first time at this location, we had a lot of questions about the menu, and she was a little irritated with our questions. We then finally ordered. We got 2 pepperoni pizzas and chicken nachos. 

She told us if we added $3 more dollars to each of our items, we would get a free play card. So it would've been perfect for not buying more play cards. So we did add the $3 special for the card play, but she didn't mention to us until after we won at least 10,000 points on games that it wouldn't be included on their dinner play cards. 

Not only did the server and this place ruin our dinner, but made my kiddos cry for not getting any prizes they've earned on those games.

Food: The food there is okay. Pricing is alright for the portions you get. I wouldn't eat here again. I would just grab food somewhere in the plaza. 

Location: Great area, located right next to the movie theater. You get the best of both worlds. Teenagers, kids and adults can all enjoy a movie then come here afterwards. 

Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.

The facility itself is HUGE! There are tons and tons of games to play, my favorite was the frog log jump and the Terminator one!! They also have ski ball and a basket ball shooting game. For those of you faithful gamers they even have an entire room set up for online/computer games where you can play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails. My favorite part is their full bowling lanes!! 

When you're ready to wet your whistle they also have a large full bar with a full menu.

I would say that I frequent all of these places because of the age of my kids and they are all pretty close to this location. I purchased the all day pass from Groupon. I paid $20 and it also came with a game card with some additional game coins. The all day game card does not allow you to get tickets for items. I didn't really like that the all day card you can only swipe once a minute because if you have more than 1 person then you have to have 2 cards and each card has a $2 activation. My son was doing most of the playing, but every so often I would want to play the pirate game with him or something and that is a 2 player game. The card says ""Sorry please Wait"" Ugh... The items in the shop look like they would require you to play for a whole week to get 1 thing. Other places you can get a few toys with a little amount of playtime and who doesn't want a toy at the end of all their playing? I know my 6 year old does! The layout is also very cramped. They seem to have packed in as many machines as possible, but did not consider that when people are playing pin ball that there is no room to pass by. This seems to be a fire hazard if you ask me, but we made it through even though I felt a bit claustrophobic at times. I think I spend less at John's pizza and it includes food that is not just pizza. John's is still my favorite and it has a more open layout so you don't lose your kids as much.

I could easily end the review here and feel like I covered the very basic gist of what this place is all about, but allow me to get a bit more in-depth-- starting with a very short background story. 

GameWorks is no stranger to Sin City, having held open a Strip-side location that saw early success, but ultimately couldn't make ends meet. After a substantial hiatus, they once again returned, this time making their home in Town Square. 

After enjoying this location since its opening, I can safely say this was mutually a good decision on their part-- for myself and their business. Traffic rarely wanes during the summer, even on weekdays. The location itself is more suited for locals since parking is easier to come by than the Strip location, and traffic is far less of an issue. The single-level design of the arcade might be a point of contention for quite a few who knew the old GameWorks, but I find it a lot easier to navigate.

The games themselves are decently maintained, not to the scope that certain Round 1s I've been to are, but enough that on any given day that few machines, if any, will ever be out of service during operating hours.

The staff are generally attentive to most needs in my experience, but things of that nature are VERY different between person to person and your mileage will vary.

Prices for menu and bar items are about what you'd expect. The menu has improved quite a bit over time, but the options wouldn't be enough to entice the truly picky from other offerings within walking distance. It's bar food for casual bites, not a Zagat-rated establishment.

The hidden jewel of this place, however, is not the bowling alley, restaurant area, Dark Ride or the redemption counter-- it lies within the E-Sports center. Rows of consoles and gaming PCs await to satisfy the needs of more at-home gamers, with frequent community events for certain games to give the place a sense of being a hub for all that's happening in the world of competitive gaming. Of all the areas in this arcade, this one has always felt the most welcoming too.

All that, and you can order food and alcohol in the E-Sports area (provided you are of legal age).
Imagine all of the drunk Mario Kart games you could have with your friends...

All in all, GameWorks has become a bit of a cornerstone in the gaming scene here, and it's not going anywhere. With its central location, great entertainment options and cozy E-Sports center, it's well-suited for players of all levels, casual and competitive.",EcsFvqOm2nogMxhJPVH-WA,3,4,4,QfUW80hiABK4M9LqwVUbtQ

I definitely enjoy playing Skee Ball, air hockey, and other arcade games while having an adult beverage. It's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults, except there are also kids too. Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.

The food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.

4676826,2017-10-27,1,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Last night we celebrated my husband's nephew's birthday here, per his request. The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won't get towed if you don't have change to spare. 

We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table. 

I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards. 

I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all. 

BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more ""prizes"" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well. 

1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket.

4896239,2014-10-01,3,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Before I continue, I would like to say that this review is regarding only the arcade portion of this GameWorks. After hearing everyone's excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down. 

First of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It's always crowded with so many people and sometimes you'll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.

Second, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don't even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said ""They never work"".

This brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.

Lastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don't let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they've been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don't even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.

I wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade. From now on, I'm sticking to the Pinball Hall of Fame.",rqKCE0ASDODEd3IHlRI-OA,9,3,1,bmwqc8IG-6hSo5Q6u0Ykbw

We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper.

Compared to the old GameWorks, the selection is a fraction of what used to be and half the games weren't functioning correctly either. Also the useless bar/restaurant area composes half of this GameWorks. That's right, they put more effort into building an eatery rather than getting decent GAMES. The E-Sports arena was pretty decent and the bowling area looked cool as well.

Be prepared to spend at least $20+ if you wish to have a decent experience as the GameWorks cards no longer work by hours. They work by a points system instead and the games range between 4-11 points.

It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games. 

Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet.

Location: I love the new location in Town Square compared to the old location on the strip. It is below the AMC movie theatre and across from Yard House. It is close to a bunch of good bars and restaurants. Here are a few: Yard House, Capriotti's, Mcfaddens, Sugar Factory. 

Interior: When you walk in the front doors there is a service station to your left and a seating area, there is also seating on the exterior if you prefer that. The bar is 20ft from the front door. The bar was average in size with a good selection of alcohol, we ordered a jack with coke and Malibu mix drink, both were $6 so that's not bad. Then you have a decent selection of arcade games and various other gaming machines, there was a variation of air hockey which would throw out about 20 mini discs at once, now that was fun and intense. There was a glow in the dark pool table area and bowling lanes which I did not try but will next time.

Staff: The bar staff was good. There was a hipster looking white male who made us feel at home, explained the changes to the new menu, and helped us when needed. There was a short hispanic male who was in the bar area and didn't seem to do much, I'm not sure if he was the manager but he was rude to the staff and extremely bossy.

The place was busy, but not packed. My partner found his favorite game (some shooter game where you sit in a booth, and you're a pirate fighting undead pirates), and we initially started having a blast. Next, we found an old school Capcom Vs Marvel game that took our credits, and didn't let us play. My partner went to the check in desk and they refunded the credits. Cool. Then we went to a few other games, and most of those would do the same. I started paying attention and saw that it was happening to others, too. 

After getting frustrated, we found our friend and her son and played a bit with him (some of those kid games are even more fun than the arcade games). The ticket redemption area was a madhouse, as to be expected, but the staff was friendly enough. The trainer could have been more helpful with his trainee, but he was preoccupied with chatting with his coworkers, who found it appropriate to flip one another off in front of small children (but at least the coworker had enough tact to discreetly disguise it as pushing up his glasses). 

Oh, and beers are $8 and up (I thought Town Square was a local's place, not the actual Strip), and the girl at the ticket counter said he average cost of a play was 4-9 credits. Sure. In the kid's area. The rest was at least 10 credits a play. One play. No multiple lives, or more than one shot in the kid's area.",yPFB_NuRX4W_nAkxnTKxhQ,4,1,2,I5JaA3ZyVrPaaBZO3SZYjg

Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.

Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything. 

I would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games.

The initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.

I've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.

I felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.

I tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.

They were giving out 2 free hour game cards with a purchase of a $12 card (54 credits) because they were experience problems, which is a nice gesture. By problems that meant that half of the games weren't working. I went to the MGM location when it was open and honestly this location doesn't even come close. There are very little games and it doesn't help that most of them were down and the area is really small. Staff is very nice though. Their systems went completely down around 9:30pm and that's when my boyfriend and I decided to leave. 

What this Gameworks has that the old one didn't is an Esports area where you can play PC games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. I get the concept of this idea, but you can stay home and play these games and this space could've been utilized for more games.

The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game. 

Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable.

Games: Okay selection. Typical games like carnival style, ticket winning games, arcade racing, two rhythm and very few Japanese games. My personal favorite is Taiko Drum Master. Some o the games are rather old and as maintain as other places.

People: For families and children. The kids could be worst and parents have them in line as best they can. Something about the place and the energy causes the parents to be very impatient and irrational.  Probably some kids are pestering their parents and they are at their wits end. The parents are only interested with their kids and they will interrupt your game if their kids want to play. Teenagers are just as bad. ""Every man from himself"" is what this place is like. That happen twice in one visit.

(Specific example, we waited in like for about 1/2-1hr for a game. Then a parent interrupted us when we were playing the game in the beginning and we were like fine. After a while we left and came back. Then we played again after waiting in line for [1/2-1hr] not interrupting the previous player but someone ask us to leave again.)

Arcade is for family which is great but the parents aren't gamers and have zero gaming etiquette.

Staff: Attentive and do what they must. About what you expect.

Come here if you have children. Maybe if you want to go from machine to machine. Not if you want to progress in the game or beat it.",-jDtacIrN9x4c3BDD5xkGQ,5,0,2,5YHeqVLT5xmNnKZ7BrlkyQ

My first awful experience with this place was back in January of 2015. We went for my little brother's birthday, and he was super excited to win a prize from the arcade. When we told our waiter this, he offered us the all you can play for 2 hours pass, and we thought: ""perfect, we can earn a bunch of tickets and get him something fun!"" It wasn't until the two hours ended and we tried to redeem our tickets that we were informed we did not win any tickets, the pass just gave us unlimited game play. My brother was heartbroken, and we walked out empty handed, and when we complained to the front desk they refused to do anything for us, and told us we should have specifically asked the waiter. What?! I wrote this same review on their facebook page, and management never responded. I have sworn off going here since then, but last night I decided to give it another shot since my fiance wanted to play some games for his birthday. 

I would give this experience two stars as well. A lot of games were not working, and the games that did work were EXPENSIVE. I get that it's in a tourist-y area, but really? 9 credits for one game where you don't get a substantial amount of tickets? It's not like the prizes you offer are anymore reasonably priced, and the cheap prizes are dollar store things. 

Also, management decided it would be advantageous to dust their ceiling off as my fiance and I were standing right next to them. We were playing a game when dust just came pouring down on us - seriously?! You couldn't warn us first? Afterwards, when we walked away, the manager made eye contact with us, saw us covered in dust, and didn't say anything. I was appalled. 

I have tried to like this place, but I just can't. I know D&B has had some issues in it's first few weeks, but I would rather spend my time there then spend anymore time at Gameworks - they've been open for at least two years and they still can't get it together.",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,3,2,2,dGoJPq9hHPLmERp6fHn8hg

5604133,2015-08-28,4,n7V4cD-KqqE3OXk0irJTyA,"Recently discovered that my 11YO enjoys playing pool, briefly considered getting him a fake ID so we can hit up PTs. Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool. 

 Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills. 

 Everyone's happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended.
 There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important. 

 Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice ""I'm over my man cave"" Craig's list second hand-me-down.

 Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience. 
 I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind. 

 If you want to know about the food- it's frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don't come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you. 

 In short, it's where you can take the kids when they've outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that.",7Vfy39A_totC-w70qZi0MA,2,2,4,VHdvODWqezvexR0_wFMEzA

Specifically, I'm referring to their Wizard of Oz machine which is one of those coin dozer type games where you knock coins down.  This game was fun to us at first b/c it has cards that you can collect and if you manage to gather them all, you can turn them in for a ticket bonus of like 2000 tickets.  So I learn that the Toto dog card is the rarest of the bunch and there are only a few in each machine.  And obviously you need this card to complete the set and the ticket bonus.  Well obviously they are aware of this too b/c they literally have all of the Toto cards out of play.  How do I know this?  Because they are stupid enough to put them in the machines at the very top of the decks so that you can see that they are in there.  But the cards fall from the bottom and somehow the Toto card is always on top.  Not 1. Not 2. But 3 in plain view and out of play.  I have been in and out of there for over 6 months and just check as I walk by and they are still right there on top.  

I would never accuse a place of being shady or trying to scam people without being sure... but I think 6 months straight is a fair amount of time to base my accusations.  I have pictures as proof on my other phone.  Who knows what other games they have rigged that aren't so obvious.  It's sad really that a business would be so cheap when it comes to winning a relatively small amount of tickets used to buy mostly junk toys.

Shame on Gameworks for taking a game that is expensive to play anyways and feeling the need to cheat children and families.  

I'm taking my business to other places.  John's Incredible Pizza is a very good alternative for those that don't like to support shady businesses.",mmAcpelY5OdTLgwjDDB6Lw,7,0,1,A4EtoGXwY41vBDzmdieJjg

Price: 200 credits for $35 to share between 2 kids lasted almost 1 hour. It would have been longer but they went on the Dark RideXD 3 times which was $5 per ride but they enjoyed this the most. They did Gigamon, the Pirate one and the Werewolf one. The gal was nice enough to throw in a free ride since it was a slow day. It was neat because there was a monitor so I could watch what they were doing inside (it's like a little theater). She also let me watch some of the game on her monitor so I could see what they see (minus the 3D). I thought the Werewolf one was really cool.

At first we were told next time we cannot bring in outside food. I apologized and continued to sit while my husband took the kids back to the arcade. There were 2 other families there (one with outside food, a birthday cake) sitting, talking clearly done with their food. The server then came back up to me and my newborn and told me we would have to leave because they needed our table for another group. Mind you, the place was empty with tables everywhere and no one waiting to be seated. She said because I already paid I could no longer sit there. I ordered a coffee so I could sit but was deeply disturbed. I have been a Las Vegas resident my whole life and have never been asked to leave a restaurant after paying for food. NEVER GO THERE!

The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.

I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.

Still no plates & silverware.. My friend went behind one of the service stations and got us plates & silverware after our pizza had already gotten cold.

Waited another 15-20 minutes for the check.

The second shot wasn't full but she shot me a look like ""See?!"" so I wasn't gunna piss her off more by telling her I saw it wasn't full I saw her spill some in the process. I did ask if the jigger was only an ounce and she said yes. Super low house pour.. and the fact that the second wasn't full basically meant I paid $15 for a standard shot.

I forgot their names sadly (I swear one was named Lorenzo?) but the female hostess with the purple hair was extremely sweet and helpful and our male server was funny and cool as well! GW provided us free game cards and a 2 hour play card but this is a place where you get tired out at easily depending on what game you play (or what you're doing overall), so I only did a couple rounds of DDR. Noting from other reviewers, the games mostly seemed to be back in working condition, so I suppose they recently fixed everything? The only disappointment was the E-sports looked lacking (again, the time and day could have contributed to that.) Would I be back?

I think if they had spread this area out a bit more there would be more room to move around and enjoy the games. It was overly crowded and there weren't too many games that looked worth the time and money to play. The only ones that did were packed and had long waits.
