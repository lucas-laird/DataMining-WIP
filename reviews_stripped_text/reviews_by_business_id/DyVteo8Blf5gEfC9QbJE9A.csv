161327,2010-10-18,3,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"Location not too far from the strip and amazing rates (the last trip we were able to stay 2 nights, $15/person/night on a holiday weekend) is what brought me and my friends back this year.  I checked us in this time, and the concierge was very helpful and super friendly.  Their main restaurant reminded me of an IHOP or Coco's - mediocre food, to be expected at this type of off-strip casino, and the buffet was a pleasant surprise for the price.  I don't gamble, but my friends were huge fans of their late night Bingo and almost everyone won a game there or at the slots.

However: my roommate rented out a huge, multi-room suite on the top floor (couple hundred $$/night).  A comforter on one of the beds had a large, noticeable dried-up stain on it, and he later found a crack pipe which appeared to have been recently smoked and still had remnants in it stuffed into a roll of toilet paper.  He immediately brought these items to management's attention who apologized and offered a discount of some sort that would be accounted for when we checked out.  On check out day, we were told no discount would be given, and after a drawn out discussion they decided to take $20 off of his bill, their excuse being that maybe he was the one who planted the pipe to obtain a discount (which THEY had originally offered, he hadn't asked for.)  My roommate's been sober for 10 years.  Then they pointed the finger at me since I had a key to his room.  Seriously?  They balked when I offered to take a drug test on the spot and gave us 8 vouchers for a free buffet.  Problem with that is we had no use for them since we were leaving, plus there were 10 people in our party.

This place would have easily garnered 3 or 4 stars, but management lost 2 - mainly for accusing us of illegal activity.  I wouldn't recommend against staying here, just hope that no drug paraphernalia shows up in your bathroom.  If it does, you're on your own.",Jd3eEJJ1h1gds64o5JnTIw,0,1,1,uk99PHcjFddQKNXyUciLIw

213261,2011-05-06,3,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"I'm not sure where to begin. Perhaps starting with three days after I returned home from Arizona Charlie's. Coughing, lethargic, gloomy. Mostly that can be blamed on the lack of ventilation and the probable 2-pack-per-day-per-customer cigarette habit that sucked every bit of fresh air out of each square inch of the building(s). Maybe it was the years of sealed in despair that permeated throughout. Down-on-their-luck locals coming for the penny slots - surely this will be the day I make up for all the lost years? Yes, there were a few clueless tourists there for the cheap rates and the $3.99 steak/eggs deal, though how anyone could have eaten through the fog of smoke is a mystery to me. 

Some horrific details: a broken down pensioner at the poker table, two overflowing ashtrays next to him. A gooey substance above the light switch in my room. More motorized scooters than I care to remember. 

On a positive note, it's been almost a month since I was there and I seem to be disease free. Nothing was stolen and the parking lot was well-lit.

But, we were there for a middle-school basketball tournament and if anyone thinks that's a healthy environment for young teens, well then let's shoot back in time to 1972.

220961,2015-01-21,1,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"We were in town for a short two day climbing trip, and wanted a reasonably priced place to stay for one night. Considering the size of the rooms and hotel in general, this place is maybe half a step up from a divey pay-by-hour motel. The staff is fairly polite, but the hotel is disgusting. 

Upon walking into the room, you notice a pungent cigarette smoke smell. We were never asked in our booking process if we wanted a smoking or nonsmoking room. I doubt they even have non smoking rooms. Also, upon coming back to the room after dinner, there was a strong smell of air freshener in the hallway, and a few doors down from us, a new large pale spot in the carpet where someone had obviously puked. Realistically, it's Vegas and that happens, but in the morning it was still not cleaned... just scooped up and forgotten about.

Apart from the odor, 3 of the 4 lights in our room didn't work, the carpet was damp in many places, the walls are PAPER THIN(we could hear a phone conversation in the next room as clearly as if the man was sitting in ours), the water in the shower changes temperature frequently, with no adjustment(steady for a while, randomly bounces to cold, then scalding, then stable again), and the air conditioner didn't work(room stayed in the 70s, despite the thermostat being set to 60).

I wouldn't give this place 0 stars, they earned their 1 star with the comfortable King size bed. But I would not stay here, and strongly dissuade others.",cQXZXJzVpZY60JFOK_R9dQ,3,2,1,tHuhbJl-OnkggtToL_tWsw

Anyhow when we booked our reservations over the phone, it kept getting mixed up over the phone. When we checked in the guy that was helping us messed up our rooms. My sister's room was supposed to be smoking and mine was not but that got mixed up. Also we were told her room was 60 bucks but ended up having to pay for 5 additional dollars which he couldn't explain why. He was getting frustrated and said if we didn't want the rooms then he was going to charged us more. What kind of service was that? We had a large group and it had been a long day we just wanted to call it a night so we let him slide this time. The next day observing the casino floor I noticed that everyone else that was playing had only credits on their machine of 80 bucks or less. I thought to myself wow this casino must be tight. I however tried it myself and omg it is tighter than a damn virgin. Put 70 bucks in and didn't even win anything over 5 bucks.

We stayed here because it was close to a relative's house. We hate smoking, don't gamble, but I'm not downgrading it for that - it's a casino and we knew that going in. However, while the tower is supposedly non-smoking, the elevator sits open in the lobby of the casino and the cigarette smell wafts up through it, down the hall and into the rooms - and our room was the very last one - way down a long hall. Our room stunk.

There is a fridge, which was small, but handy - but no coffeemaker. No way to have some morning coffee, short of going into one of the smelly casino eateries. 

On the plus side, it had instant hot water, which was great. But the faucet in the tub/shower was broken - it was nearly falling out of the wall and the diverter didn't work - only abt 25% of the water came out the shower head and the rest was wasted down the drain. I reported it to the front desk, but I have no confidence that anything was done about it. The irony was, of course, that there was one of those ubiquitous ""Help Us Save Water"" signs. 

But the real kicker was the internet charge. $11.99 per day PER DEVICE! We had 5 devices: 2 Kindles, an iPad and 2 iPhones. $60 a day? Really? I set my iPhone up as a mobile hotspot and used our data minutes to download our daily newspapers and web surf, but lots of people either don't have the capability or aren't that tech savvy and will be ripped off by these outrageous charges.

489908,2013-08-14,4,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"I haven't eaten at every buffet in Vegas, but I can say with complete confidence that nothing could possibly be worse than this. Do not believe anyone who says they enjoyed this place, they are demented, and considering that no one in the place appeared to be under the age of 65, dementia has to be a factor because anyone who would return to this place has to be insane and since everyone there appeared to be a regular, I felt as if I were dining inside an asylum.

It's unbelievable that this buffet is more expensive than Fiesta Rancho's which is exponentially better. Nothing, I mean nothing, was edible, everything sucked, go to the Chinese station, the Mexican station, the place with the godawful chicken potpie and what I guess was supposed to be Cordon Bleu, next to the nasty Tilapia fillets, I couldn't stomach any of it.

I tried some spaghetti but I couldn't top it with any of the beyond frightening meatballs, they looked like they came straight out of an Eli Roth movie. Even the fruit I could not eat because it looked like someone had taken bites out of the watermelon and cantaloupe slices and tossed them back on the bar.

And it wasn't just the food: the grannies racing around on their motorized scooters were extremely dangerous...bingo could not start soon enough.

Look, I am by no means a picky eater and am an extremely tolerant person, but this place would even test the endurance of Job and I doubt God would have been cruel enough to put him through it. As I stared at the grease pooling on my plate, drowning god knows what I knew without a doubt that I had shortened my lifespan by several days by paying this place a visit.

The fact that I had picked up a player's card beforehand was hardly a consolation. Save me a dollar?  I' m the one who should be paid for being here...I tossed it in the garbage with the rest of the refuse.",Iz1g0jEevehWoXCahQFkoQ,1,0,1,HY8W70Pna_VMMCxoVCnN_g

530867,2011-06-19,0,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"This is a review for the buffet at Arizona Charlies.  Took my teenage son here for dinner. Buffets are always a winner with him coz he can count on having 2 of his 4 food groups available to eat which are pizza and fried chicken.  With the players card, I got a sizable discount.  The spread is somewhat limited and has a little of the feel of the dining hour at a nursing home, not too spicy, nothing too tough to chew (except for the prime rib).  What I noticed was how clean the restaurant was (no leftover globs of spilled dressing at the salad bar) and how friendly the staff greeted me.  I almost thought we were dining in Boulder City.  My son loved the fried okra, his 3rd food group and the corn on the cob was super sweet and not floating in that congealed yellow stuff so commonly seen at buffets.  Desserts are pretty basic, not extravagant, but the wait staff was quick to fill my iced tea and son's coke.  The food is worth the money, will fill you up without draining your wallet, and won't make you sick after.

That said, this is the only casino I've been to where someone was so drunk at the table that they fell asleep standing up.  They only open one craps table so its either empty or completely packed.

You earn comps fast here.  I play no more than $20-$40 per visit and i earn food comps pretty frequently.  No other place does this for me.

The room was quiet and very comfortable, we arrived and decided to go down to the casino for a couple hours; downstairs the service was totally the opposite way, the waitresses were so rude and unfriendly that after only one hour we decided to switch casinos. These waitresses had such an attitude that made us feel unwelcome there, I don't know what is the difference in training between housekeepers and waitresses but believe me they have a lot to learn for the people cleaning the rooms, my respect for them and shame on the waitresses, hope management sends a supervisor sometime and they are caught being rude and unpolite.

I don't need the works when it comes to hotels. All I require is that my room is clean, bed reasonably comfortable and that it doesn't have an offensive smell. That's it. I don't need 500 thread count sheets, fluffy pillows, name brand toiletries, plushy towels, etc. 

Cleanliness is at the very top of my requirement list. I am very comfortable staying at a Motel 6 because every experience I have ever had has been clean. Sure, one time my bed had a broken spring and I woke up with a sore back. But I would stay there again over here. My room here had an entire family of crickets. Now, crickets are not as bad as bed bugs but the fact that I killed at least 5 crickets within 15 minutes grosses me out. Give me sandpaper towels over bugs any day! I smashed those buggers on the walls and carpets and thought about leaving them there for evidence but decided to be a nice guest and clean up the bug guts. Bleck! 

Had never heard of this hotel before but booked it through Hotwire on a great price cuz hey I know how to rock a 2 star hotel. If I didn't have these unwanted pests I would have given this place 3 stars. Beds were reasonably comfortable and the bathroom was clean. We also got the non-smoking room we requested and it didn't smell bad at all. It was an acceptable place to spend the night on my way back to LA.  

Excessive* number of bugs equals deal breaker for me. 

*I discovered on this trip that excessive is more than 2. 1 is a coincidence. 2 is kinda funny. 3 is a family which means there were probably 30 I didn't see.",-U4vS4qp47MLkqF3SWEahA,4,1,2,lPkA9o7EQHbX9hZkAEQJHQ

The room was clean, and everything was nice inside our room. You can just take a cab to the strip or drive there depending what your mode of transportation is when you go to Vegas. It's expensive when you take a cab in Vegas and it does not matter if you are in the STRIP, since the meter is still running when traffic is stopped, and so taking a cab in Vegas just like the city is always a gamble, you may pay less one day and you pay more the next.

1790199,2016-08-01,0,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"I feel some trepidation in writing this review. the reason is that technically I did not partake of the services of this establishment. But after what I witnessed I had no desire to give Arizona Charlie's my patronage. But I will simply describe the event and let you make your own decision.
      I had just entered the casino Arizona Charlie's with the intention of trying their cafe and maybe enjoying some low stakes gambling when I witnessed something. A couple had entered at the same time as I had and the gentleman was wearing a shirt that said security on it both front and back. 
       An employee of Arizona Charlie's came up to the gentleman in question and abruptly and rudely told him he must leave the premises immediately because of his shirt. I heard the man explain and his wife confirm that he worked security in a local hospital and he was heading to work after he had lunch. 
       The employee of Arizona Charlie's reiterated his demand in what I can only call a threatening and rude manner. Now this was to a couple that to all appearances were  sober and respectable. Exactly the sort of patrons an establishment in decline would like to encourage. I do not mean to disparage Arizona Charlie's but when walking in, the smell, decor and level of maintenance make it apparent this place should make every effort to attract customers not throw them out rudely. 
        I have seen places with dress codes offer a shirt to cover cloths that advertised or espoused truly offensive things. Why Arizona Charlie's made no such offer but had to treat, what to all appearances was a clean, covered and soft spoken couple so rudely did not bode well. 
     I can understand why a business may have concerns with a man wearing a shirt that says security when he does not work on their security. Though with the vast number of people in Las Vegas who work in security I would think it potentially foolish. But to openly and rudely enforce a rule on this couple in a manner that suggests this is common practice is not only bad practice but wrong of Arizona Charlie's. 
        I wish to reiterate, if a couple of teenagers with buzz cuts or dreads came in smelling of alcohol with ripped jeans such behavior on the part of Arizona Charlie's may have made rational if not business sense. I believe rudeness is rarely called for. But this couple were middle aged, pleasant and to all intents seemed perfectly willing to pay for their lunch. 
      That is why I left. I was dressed like I always am on vacation and that was to a lower standard than that displayed by the couple in question. Frankly if I worked security in the Vegas area I would find a venue that treats my profession with a modicum of respect. That venue would not be Arizona Charlie's.
       Thank you for your patience in reading such a long review. But the incident just rubbed me the wrong way. Rudeness, if it must be tolerated should at least be reported.",fgLAETNAbGxDBL1xslrjTQ,1,0,1,K1UXRvQvXGCNTA2gl4kamg

You must wait until the shuffle to add another hand even if you are the only player at the table. This place is full of OLD CROOKS running the place trying desperately to rip off players. ALL other Casinos give the players 65 to 75% of the deck to offer a much better chance to win. Even their video poker machines are a big rip off.

Stir fry to order station, and a cool fire pizza oven.  I had the best turkey from the carving station of any place I've eaten in Vegas.  The place was clean, the staff was wonderful, and the chef made a point to come by and check in with us.  I would highly recommend checking it out.

The hotel, however, smelled like smoke from the minute we entered the lobby to check in and at the buffet restaurant at the hotel. That's why I have do give the hotel (2 stars). The room rate for a weekend was not bad, however, if you are NOT a smoker, you will smell the smoke on the main floor, the casino areas and all of the first floor (non-smoking) room areas. On the second and third floors it is not so bad. You get what you pay for. When you stay at the high end hotels, Aria, Luxor, Mirage, MGM, Stratosphere, Bellagio, New York, New York, Caesars, Mandalay Bay, Vdara, Trump, Rio, Venetian, etc. You get the picture, those seem to keep the smoke smell out of the  non smoking areas. Many of them will only allow smoking outside. For a smoker, its a great deal, for a NON smoker, not so good. That will hurt the hotel from getting return non smokers.

Initial check-in experience almost sunk the whole thing, some inexplicably angry and completely unapologetic Muppet told me the room wasn't ready at 3, told me to come back in 30 minutes, then I come back and they try to tell me it's going to be to like 4:30 before I can check in. On a weekday with no one else around at all. Thankfully another lady jumped in and upgraded me to a Klondike tower room, which is really what should have been done in the first place -- don't tell obviously exhausted people to go walk/drive around in the 105 degree heat for an hour when they arrive at check-in time! Nice save 2nd lady, you saved this place from a 1* and probably an apoplectic scene at the desk. 

Anyway, once past the desk, everything was really pretty good, especially for $37. The only downside to the Klondike room was that it had a conjoining door. But I didn't hear anything through it all night and slept like a baby, thankfully. Also no wall noise or stomping idiots above me either! Nice fan for white noise helped there too. Fire map on the door indicates only about half the rooms toward the middle of each floor have these doors, so you can maybe avoid them by asking for a room toward either end of the hall. 

Room was surprisingly big, good TV, everything reasonably clean, even had a mini-fridge and a coffee maker. Only downside is that no resort fee means no free wifi -- 12 or 13 bucks a day for that, yikes. 

Not gambling at all atm but the in-house restaurant has the same good deals on all sorts of junk food found over at the Boulder location. Walk just a block down to the intersection with Charleston and it's like cheap food paradise down there too. 

No idea about whatever Hotwire Room they were initially trying to make me wait 2 hours to get into would have been like, but the Klondike room is great if you can snag it for a good rate.",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,0,0,3,ojRttiRddtnz0ow4h0oQrA

Check-in: There were 3 people standing behind the Front Desk and i was the only one in line holding my bags. I almost asked them how long they were going to let me stand there without helping me. I checked in with Javier who had the personality of a concrete floor. He told me the pool was closed for the ""season""--It's April and 75 degrees.

The Room: There was an unknown crusty stain/food/human waste unknown filth with hair attached to it on my bed sheets. Gross, but other than that the room was pretty good. The toilet, however, didn't flush because the plastic arm inside corroded off so you had to reach in & manually flush.

Security: Had some John Wayne want to be Security guy tell me i couldnt take pictures anywhere within the building and I had to delete what i took. I politely told him to piss up a rope because I didnt photograph anything gaming (didnt take pics of games, the cage, slots etc) so anything else was fair game and I wasnt deleting anything.

The Buffet: I thought the lunch buffet was great, the food tasted good and it was a great deal.

Casino Bars: The bars had some good drink specials, and we had alot of fun there.

Cafe: The cafe has food at a reasonable price, food was good with the exception of the undercooked french toast.

All in all it was an ok place to hang out, it wasnt necessarily a BAD stay, not the greatest but i probably will most likely try it again. Note: Noone contacted me about the survey thry emailed to me and an email to them went unanswered- you may find that their guest service is lacking in many areas",fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA,4,0,2,fdC5w1Dzum2gkO7XYXy6TQ

Call me crazy, but when in Vegas...I wanna play BINGO! LoL. I couldn't really find anywhere on the strip that had bingo...so I ended up finding this place that has a bingo game every odd hour. The person at the counter was very nice and helped me understand how to play the game. Basically, if you're a beginner, they recommended the electronic version which basically plays the game for you. You just have to raise your hand and say BINGO!!! when you get it....and guess what?!?! I said BINGO!!! and won $13. LoL. Yippie!

2387030,2016-10-24,2,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"Now this review is slightly colored because we left the Aria to come here because weekend rates on the strip are ridiculous.  This place wasn't cheap except by contrast.

As a casino, this one is average.  They do interesting things, like daily draws, new member bonuses for their player's club etc.  It's tight and dark and smoky, but on the SUPER plus side, they have a Non-Smoking slots area, which is amazing and the only one we've found.  It sure increased our slot playtime, not having to deal with the constant smokers right next to us.

They have live music in the evenings at the naughty lady saloon (the open bar area at the very back of the casino).  We attended, and they have a dance floor, but I would have needed ear plugs to stay very long, way too loud, probably so it flooded the whole casino, but strategically placed speakers out in the casino would have been better and made staying to watch the actually quite good band possible.

You know those hotel rooms where you open the door and look inside and let out a sigh of relief because you're happy that you get to stay in a nice place for a few days, and are happy to come back to your own small retreat to get away from the loud noisy boisterous nonsense of real life?  Well, this isn't one of those places.

As a hotel, this wasn't the worst I've stayed in, but it is definitely the worst at $100+ per night.

The Good:
Free Valet
Large Room
Large Bathroom

The Bad:
Old (non-flat) TV that flickered
Only Very Basic Cable
Wifi $13 per device per day
Room smelled like stale air freshener
Hallways smelled like cat litter
Bouncy uncomfortable bed
Tiny desk
Almost no power outlets
No fridge, coffee maker or any other kind of room amenities

Probably the worst thing was the lack of wifi, TV, and air circulation.  Our room was stale, stuffy and uncomfortable during out whole stay.  They also had a note on the A/C not to turn it below 69 as the compressor would freeze.  Which I don't think is right, but also didn't keep the room cooled to 69 degrees when set as such.  Ended up setting it lower anyway, didn't explode anything.

On the plus side, there is a cool antique shop, and laundry mat in the strip mall that basically shares a parking lot with the casino.  Probably spent as much time in those two places as we did (awake) in our room.",x2RQJbMAzItqGmqY-dcCog,3,0,1,CH4o1OCxRJVluehz9_00kA

It was my friend and I's first time playing Bingo in Vegas, so we made sure we did it the old fashion way of using a dauber and not electronically as most reviews recommended. It costed us $6 for 10 games and a bonus round. Another $1 for a dauber from the vending machine. The numbers get called pretty quickly so if your eyesight is failing or if you can't handle stressful situations, opt for the electronic version. Bingo is offered every odd hour of the day as most casinos in Vegas offer. There are designated smoking and non-smoking areas. Everyone here was super nice and helped us answer any questions we had.

Plate 1 - cheese pizza, salad with Caesar dressing, chow menu, potato and macaroni salad 
Plate 2 - nachos with pulled pork, chicken empanada, lasagna 
Dessert - apple pie with strudel and vanilla ice cream 
Food was mediocre. The pizza had a hard crust but the potato and macaroni salad tasted great! For the nachos and the pulled pork, I suggest eating it in moderation. I added too much pork and the taste got tiring after the 5th chip. The apple pie tasted okay, was not a big fan of the strudel. The strudel tasted bland and sort of undercooked.

This was how I learned we were the black sheep of the family, because there is no way I would tell even my worst enemy to ever step foot in this place.
Every casino/hotel in Vegas has a smoky atmosphere, but in this place you can feel the gritty cigarette smoke that hangs in the unfiltered air. The front desk staff are apathetic if not necessarily rude. You have to give your room key to security before you can get into the elevator, not because they are so up-scale as to offer added security but because only psychopaths and desperate people come here, and desperate people will probably try to break into your room at some point to steal whatever they can get their hands on.
The beds were uncomfortable but the rooms were clean at least. My requested wake-up call came through, even though when I called at 2 a.m. to request a 6 a.m. wake-up call the operator laughed at me like I was insane, which I was not to pack up and leave the moment our taxi first pulled up to this hell-hole.
A word on the food, which everyone points to as the reason to ever come here: the buffet is horrendous, don't do it. The cafe has a great burger and fries special with your player's club card (you don't actually have to play, the card is free) for about 2 dollars; at 3 in the morning you can take all your siblings and their kids to the cafe for the 3.99 ham and eggs (one players card for every 4 people will ensure everyone gets this rockin' deal) and no one will leave hungry, though the potatoes were cold once and the ham is salty. Still, I think I'd rather have paid a lot more for food and stayed someplace where I wasn't worried about what I would catch walking down the hall to my room.
All in all, I will never forgive my family for suggesting this place, and I actually may never go back to Vegas, because all the glitz and glamour in the world will not be able to erase the traumatic memories I have of that city now. Thanks a lot, Arizona Charlie's. 
Oh, but if I do go back, I will take full advantage of the free drinks cocktail waitresses bring you when you are sitting at a machine, not even playing but just waiting for the rest of your party to come down so you can leave.

Super Bowl Sunday.  Arizona Charlie's Hotel delivered perfectly with clean & basic accommodations.  It's located off-strip in a interesting (?) area of town, and doesn't impose the dreaded resort fees that all the strip hotels charge.  Ask for a room in the Tower, preferably high up facing the Strip. Lots of quick dining options in the area.  However, stay away from the McDonald's that's located nearby across the street.  Yuck!  There's a 24 Hr. Wal Mart Super Center nearby, but it's not virtually across the street as told by another reviewer.  More like about 3-4 blocks and takes a brisk, 15-20 min. walk each way.  I didn't play or eat here, as my stay was so short.  Plenty of free, open parking on both sides of the property.

3351670,2014-08-04,0,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"Had not made prior arrangements before booking.  I needed to be in a different part of town for a couple of days, so I put the GPS on Hotels and hunted.  This was the closest place to pop up, only ¾ of a mile from where I needed to be for work.  I phoned the reservation number and asked about rates.  The operator could not have been nicer and directed me to a great rate, $44 a night, plus tax.  I arrived about 60 seconds subsequent to my having made the reservation.  The valet parking attendant was also very courteous and pleasant, directing me to the self-parking lot for easier load-in.  Registration was a breeze and, as it turned out, timed just right.  When I was heading to my room, less than 10 minutes after my arrival, the front desk now had a long line of people waiting.

I did indeed load-in more easily and within a few minutes I was on the casino floor, looking for food. At the Sourdough Inn, I noticed different prices, the lower ones for patrons with the casino's player's card.  So I walked over to that desk and went through the process.  The somewhat new clerk on duty was very nice and even spelled my name properly, something not done in many years.  I provide copious identification, from which she gleaned my name and it spelling.  And so it was quite odd when I received an email from Linda Klarner, a casino executive, who misspelled my name, saying she got it from the player's card information.  Odd indeed.

After receiving my card, I went back to eatery and got a seat immediately.  I sat there a full 14 minutes before the waitress arrived.  I asked about the specials, and her response was, ""Let's see, I'm not really sure.""  We stared at each other for a few seconds, until I realized she had no idea what the daily specials were.  She did recall that a burger platter was one of them, so it was that which I ordered.  It, too, took a long while to arrive, and the place was not busy in the least.  Once enjoying my meal, she never did return , which was a shame, as I wished for a beverage.  On my way out, I mentioned this to the cashier, who said to me, ""Oh that must be_____,"" using the waitress's name.  Interesting how the cashier knew about whom I was talking.

My stay was relatively fine, the room was great, large, clean and easily accessible.  The casino itself is medium-sized with enough variety to satisfy most machine players, while tables are more sparse.  One big surprise is the $11.99 charge for internet access, something of which I did not partake.  The day I left, I noticed an anomaly on my bill, online.  I phoned the front desk, which in turn transferred me to accounting, where I encountered an exceptionally rude individual, who constantly interrupted me and had no grasp of my questions because she did not listen.  The problem unresolved, I spoke with my bank and they took care of it.  Meanwhile, I phoned Ron Lurie, the General Manager of the entire property, to let him know of my dissatisfaction.  We never did connect, which is unfortunate.  But I am sure, after reading this, he now knows the issue.  Coincidentally, another AC's guest was working in my office and he had an encounter just as bad with another hotel employee, all of which I was privy to as he had his phone on speaker.  

Hey, Ron, your floor staff me nice, and at times uninformed, but your behind the scenes people really need more customer service training.  Seriously.",wlNagcXk2dFxjt9QAATNbw,0,0,3,rJ0XIakRC52wXmMj99zTAQ

3. In keeping with the airlines hidden charges, they charge you a ""resort fee"" of $18 a person on top of whatever you paid online when you check-in.

I've been to the Boulder AC on multiple occasions. It was never anything special. However, upon my first trip to the Decatur AC (for a yearly Thanksgiving Bingo ritual) I was nicely surprised. The casino feels much smaller than many other locals joints. I don't know if that is actually true, but that is the feeling I get. Most of the floor is filled with slots, very few tables, and when we came, only a few were of the tables were open. We came for bingo, but had about an hour before our game, so we played a few slots. We found a nice variety of the cheap penny slots. My wife won on a few machines, so that was nice. We play very rarely, so its nice when we can win. The floor is really smoky, as expected. The low ceilings add to the smoky interior. The cocktail waitresses were friendly, as was the bar staff. However, the only beers they had on tap were Bud & Bud Light. Yuck! 

Onto the Bingo Hall. The bingo hall was nice and large. Larger than others I've been too, and much nicer than the AC on Boulder. It wasn't smoky (but it also was pretty empty). AC Decatur is one of the only paces in town you can play bingo 24 hours a day, so I can't be real picky. The price for bingo is pretty standard, about $5 if you have players card and buy the lowest level pack. We play for fun, so that is what I did. The bar and the Bingo Hall was typical, except the beer was the same as in the bar downstairs. The bartender says you have to have a certain players card to get Coor's products. 

In the end, we didn't win, but had a great time. We will definitely be hitting up the AC on Decatur for Bingo in the future!",qF1V8GyuLL5Fpv40Cyturw,4,3,3,5uW2oHi1QnNgtnpg0oG05w

The TV is super old and bulky.The bathroom is also outdated but it's actually clean. No fridge or safe in the room. I didn't go to  the restaurants and the casino;it was full of smoke and packed with very elderly people that act like they own the place. If choosing where to stay had been an option I would not have chosen this place. I can understand people wanting to save money but this isn't even worth the low prices. I forgot to mention that the room also smelled like a mix of chlorine and smoke and the wifi is $11.99 a day for only one device. Also, you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the room above/next to you. I woke up two days in a row at 5 a.m because the people above us were walking all over the place and making a lot of noise. Please don't stay here if you have a choice , do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, you'll be happy you did. Oh and if you chose to stay here don't forget to bring disinfecting wipes since you won't want to touch anything (it's gross) and flip flops to avoid walking on their dirty carpets.

I didn't return after my first visit knowing this, but my second visit to this casino may have changed my opinion.

I will only be reviewing the casino and not the hotel. Would I stay here for the night? Maybe, if I was on a budget. Just read what the others said about the hotel stay turned me off a bit. The casino itself wasn't too bad. My second visit here was looking for a casino with cheap Blackjack. Good luck finding any less than $5 per hand Blackjack tables in Vegas, they seem to be less and less relevant. You can find a $3/hand Blackjack at Hooter's, but I'll never go back there again!

Since me and my friend was looking for cheap Blackjack and were unsuccessful, I settled on giving Arizona Charlie's a second chance which I no longer regret. I did very well that night making nearly triple of what I put in! If you just came here to gamble like I did and not stay at their hotel, this may be the place for you!

You have to get their player's card (ACE) so that you get 10% off of your food bill.  It's a great meal for the price, or actually, at any price.  Once we also added a waffle with whipped cream and strawberries, and it was crispy, yet melted in our mouths. It was sweet enough with the toppings that it didn't require any syrup. 

After eating, we got sucked into staying in the casino for a bit. One friend had heard that the Wizard of Oz slot machine pays off, so we played a bit. It's fun when you get the flying monkey bonus or get to pick your winning credits by choosing emeralds and looking for the four characters to add to your bonus.  

There's also a blackjack table with a bonus bet called lucky lucky where you bet a dollar next to your regular bet, and if your two cards plus the dealer's up card add up to at least 19, then you win at least twice your lucky bet. If your cards plus the dealer's up card is a 6-7-8, you get 50 to 1, and if they're suited, you get more.  It seemed like I would win more on the lucky bet than on the regular bet.

This casino is filled with locals, has a small town feel, and is definitely a change of pace from the fashionable hotel/casinos on the strip. You may see lots of ""characters"" there.

My husband is a serious ""foodie"", a great cook and I am one of the pickiest eaters anyone would ever meet.  We tried the steak house at Arizona Charlies on Decatur last night and have to say I was very disappointed.  It started off good but went down hill fast.  First we were seated in the back, by the kitchen even though the entire restaurant was empty except maybe five tables.  We overlooked that.  We were attended to quickly by a very nice and informative waiter who gave very good advice on what to order and drink.  The Chef salad he prepared in front of us was amazing and for me to say that since I generally don't eat Chef salad is definetely saying something.  He recommended an amazing red wine and great steak for my husband and the sword fish for me as well as a drink.  The food was good but the sauce over the swordfish reminded me of the sauce in chicken pot pies so I scraped it off.  At this point we had decided he was going to be tipped VERY well but then.....we looked at our completed plates for 20 minutes with not one bus boy to clear the table and no attention by the waiter even though he walked by us at least ten times and kissed the butts of the patrons seated in the next booth.  By the context of their conversation they ate there weekly and were well known.  They consumed all of his attention which I am assuming because they are weekly clients and great tippers.  What he doesn't know is that when we find a local restaurant we are also great tippers and will visit often and refer people. We eventually asked the bus boy for our check and at that point he took some of the plates from our table.   So what could have been one of our new local steak houses will not be visited by us again which is too bad because the food was good.

Come on Arizona Charlies, clean up those rooms & do some updating! You also need to get a new crew in housekeeping!!

5454350,2015-12-23,1,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,This buffet is the worst. They were closed for 2 months for remodeling. The room is nice but the food is horrible. Trays are always empty and food is cold. Been there 4 times and had to point out the empty trays to the workers each time. I won't be back and would not recommend this place to anyone. The old buffet was much better.,gvVqmHPMPm4kp_zwW2fVmw,1,1,1,gGrcFP82lXBjc1Yz6ri5DA

Ok, there were some changes, but the atmosphere is still the same. It's not glitzy glamour and I wouldn't like it if it were. The Buffett is fantastic and seems better all the time. The Cafe offers great deals on breakfast that we have enjoyed for all these years. I stayed here once, and didn't enjoy that, but love the rest!",1vUfFZJ1BfYtorPWAAckfw,0,0,4,zdk1s9O7hM1Eow1DqJHxSA

I stopped here because I had an hour to kill after shopping at the Meadow Mall. I'm fascinated by the elegant decor of casinos, but nope nothing exciting here. Can't fault them however. I wasn't expecting much and it's common for local casinos to be no thrill.",sfEHLRBFmvkEuE4DVf8rRA,0,0,3,qtFQoZJdUcMzabGjDtm7lg
5712906,2010-10-31,0,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"I like this place.  I'm a cheap bastard, and I can always get a decent room for a good price here.  If you have 5 star tastes and a huge expense account, Arizona Charlie's isn't for you.  But, if you want a decent room to crash for not a lot of money, it's well worth considering.

I should add the security is very good here.  A security guy would ask to see my key card every time I entered the hotel room area.  One time I thought I lost my key card in my car.  A couple of security guys noticed and asked if everything was ok.  Afterwards, I noticed there was usually someone patrolling the parking lot, which made me feel my car was safe there.  The staff fixed me up with a new card no problem, and was very polite even though I was making extra work for them.

I also felt the buffet was very good for the price.  Again, the staff was very friendly to me, from my waitress, to the chefs, even the guy that cleaned the restroom was pretty cool.

One down side is if you didn't drive into Vegas, its way too far to walk to The Strip or the Convention Center.  Also, I like swimming, and the pool was nothing special.

I just stayed at Arizona Charlie's again.  The security again was outstanding.  I was telling my friend how good the security was when we drove up to the place, and immediately we saw the bike patrol guy in the parking lot.  The same thing happened the second time we drove into the parking lot.  We didn't even get into our room before yet another guard appeared patrolling the hallway.  So, A+ for public safety.

Ate a lot at at the Sourdough Cafe.  Food was good and prices were very reasonable.  I should mention if you get biscuit's and gravy, the biscuit part is literally drowning in gravy!

I thought the buffet went down a minor notch from the last time I was there, in both quality and the selection of food.  Still not bad, though.

Internet was like $11.95 for 12 hours, which is my only major complaint.

One minor complaint is their billing system is very hard to decipher.  They didn't try to overcharge me or anything, but I couldn't figure out how they came up with their final price.

My friend and I both agreed we would stay there again.

Another update to my review.  I just stayed a few more days at Arizona Charlies in 2012.  Let me say again the security here is top notch.  When I drove into the parking lot, a cop car was cruising around.  Every time I went to my car at night, I saw a security guy riding around on his bicycle.  Never had a crime related problem here.

Ate at the Sourdough Cafe 3 times, tried all of their breakfast specials once.  Good bang for the buck.  They had a good chicken pot pie for $6, I think the skillet breakfast  two eggs, hash browns and choice of bacon or sausage and toast or biscuit and gravy was only $2.99, I think it was even 10% less than that if you have an Ace card.

I should add the crowd that patronizes this place definitely tends to be older.  So don't expect to see a lot of beautiful gals or guys hanging around here.  The upside is your hotel room neighbors will probably be quiet so you can get a decent night's sleep.

One small downside is the garbage truck always seems to do it's pick-up around 2:45AM, and from my room I could definitely hear it.  Why can't management arrange for a more reasonable pick-up time?

My friend stayed at the Mirage for 3 days.  His bill was $650 for one person, but he did get 2 buffet tickets.  My bill was less than $160 for 3 days for 2 people.  I had just stayed at the Hilton in Monterey, and although the room there was nicer than Arizona Charlie's, it really wasn't that much nicer.

I'm going to keep going back to Arizona Charlies, because for me it is a good hotel for not a lot of money.",GPqs18f4tITE4P5HAy5rHQ,4,4,4,WWGx9Bi-Nr-oxgjH3ze7Wg
5722641,2018-06-03,0,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"I used to be a regular at the Arizona Charlies on S Decatur, Ive been a loyal player there for several years.
I've seen how the staff & management conduct themselves for a very long time. Between me & my significant other alone we've put over 30+k into that casino over the years. 

Imo, Arizona Charlies has just gotten worse and worse, with more & more unprofessional management and staff that just doesnt care about or respect their players. Even the buffet that they like to comp everyone seemed nice at first, but it got me and my family food poisoning on 2 different occasions, I stopped going after that. 

I've seen management treat table players horribly, just because they were on a winning streak, and i have had a few occasions where they got ugly with me when i was winning. 

If you pay attention on the long term,  players always lose big, and wins just merely allow them to play longer....
 I find it to be the most disgraceful act a casino can engage in, to try to ruin someone's experience or game play when loyal players finally get a little luck on their side. 

When it comes down to it, casinos are built on and kept running by players!
 When the management relys solely on gaming its self & the highest income extraction of players they can get, it becomes a low class casino that has poor hospitality with poor experiences for players. 

 I would suggest to newcomers not to be fooled by Arizona Charlies short term impressions they use to keep you. 
There are far better establishments to choose from that have a better atmosphere, and you will have a much better experience else where.

It's a smaller local casino that doesn't have much tables to play if you're looking for variety of card games or roulette. I love roulette but whenever I go here, I never really see the table open and the floor lady kinda just looks then doesn't say anything. It actually happened twice. I even walked to the table and she just looked then turned around. Threw me off guard but it just made me not want to really play there. This was basically around 10/11pm after the bingo session is over. I love the bingo attendance. The workers there are really nice and it's great to see that they always remember their regulars when they go buy their tickets or get paid out. I'm not a regular there but when I do go, I do notice that. Props to the bingo room! If you don't mind smelling extra smokey, it's a fun place to play.

5939234,2012-01-18,10,DyVteo8Blf5gEfC9QbJE9A,"Have you ever been to a Casino-hotel which was located in a shopping center that had a Pep Boys, a Cash for Gold place, a liquor store, and something called Pizza Potamus in it? I have. ..

This isn't one of those fancy local's casinos like Red Rock. It isn't even one of those moderately fancy local's casinos like The Orleans or Santa Fe Station. Though it might be better than those homeless shelters that they call casinos in North Las Vegas and Downtown, Arizona Charlies is still one of the worst locals joints I can think of. 

 Whats a shame is that this place is operated by the same people who operate the Stratosphere. I love the Stratosphere. Everyone is friendly, the dealers are cool, and they generally treat me nice(except the sports book manager). Arizona Charlies is practically Stratosphere's inbreed half cousin. It has nothing that the Stratosphere offers. A great example of good customer service at Stratosphere was back in 2010, when I was insulted by a dealer. The manager was so big on customer service that he comped me a free night in a suite and gave me a free meal at Roxy's. I didn't even ask for anything. On the other hand, I had a bad experience at Charlies a few months back and the manager just told me ""thanks for letting me know"", he didn't even apologize. A world of difference as you can see. 

I use the Sports Book here a lot and notice that the locals who loiter all day at this casino are very raggedy and street urchin-like. Most of them wear those free shirts that were handed out at the club card booths back when the casinos weren't broke and actually had the money to hand out shirts that cost probably like .75 cents. Everyone here also seems to enjoy wearing gym shorts and sweat pants. You also probably won't ever see a hot chick here. You might hit a jackpot on the slots before you see any woman who isn't 200lbs.

The ventilation here is very poor and even if you are only here for a few minutes, your hair and clothes will always smell like this casino when you leave. Is management gonna do anything about it?...probably not.  

Why am I still giving this place 3-stars??? Because I did win a lot of money here a couple years ago, and they do have a good staff at the poker room.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,4,2,3,dElbhu2pWHPBMFmucMPLbA
