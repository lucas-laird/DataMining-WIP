262631,2017-10-03,0,KMxrk1YDlj_qFI1JXK4zRg,I never eat McDonalds ever! I only come here when I'm craving ice cream. I've been here about 7 times just to get ice cream. Usually in the evening but it doesn't matter what time of day it is. Morning afternoon night. Every time they say their ice cream machine is broken. I call BS. All the times I've been here over the course of a year it's broken ? Its time to fix the problem. Not that you care about loosing customers or money. But I'll never be back.

I have fond yummy memories of this fish sandwich: soft warm bun, the fish fillet, the slice of cheese & tarter sauce. What I got yesterday was a sad, sad interpretation: a smaller drier fillet, a 1/2 slice of cheese that barely covered 1/2 the size of the fillet and a small, small dollop of tarter sauce. I have seen this beloved sandwich reduce in quality and size over the 40+ years I have been eating it but yesterday took the prize & took my appetite away forever! How dare you continue to serve this sandwich and at the whopping price of $3.99! You should be ashamed of this product and take it off the menu!",sEBQqtraUXm-3O7sBG9G8g,0,0,1,p29KgDpTbE0NDT5ZbEcIfQ

1. They have a $1 menu unlike many others in Vegas.
2. They give the drink cup when you order vs making people wait is great! (It's 'policy' at most McD's to make us wait to get our drink)

And obviously, I would not just NOT order breakfast items on the $1 menu -- hashbrowns and sausage egg mcmuffin to compliment my wonderful coffee.  ^_^

Then she called the manager and the cashier told her she never said she had a coupon. Then the manager said we have to cancel the order then give you your money back she also said they don't take coupons through drive thru. I told her 2 weeks ago I went to one and they had no problem with it. I also explained to her how I told the cashier I did have a coupon twice!! At that point I told her I just want my money back and that they should put a sign if they don't take coupons through there drive thru.

When I pulled up to the drive thru I couldn't really understand the lady who was taking my order and when I did give her my order her exact words were ""WHAT""????  
In a very rude kind of way.  It's not what you say but how you say it and your customer service skills suck right now. 

So I asked her.....Excuse me did you just ask me WHAT?......She never answered my  question and finally repeated my order.  When I drove up to the window I was about to give her a piece of my mind because you can't act like that with people patronizing your business.  Before I got to say anything she said ""I'm sorry you couldn't hear me because my voice is cracking"" yada yada yada.....I just paid for my food and picked it up at the next window.

1330290,2018-01-13,0,KMxrk1YDlj_qFI1JXK4zRg,"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt I needed to share this horrific experience of poor customer service. 

Today I was running late for work, so I used the mobile app to place an order to speed up my wait time. BTW, I love the app!!! Well, I placed my order before I left home and proceeded to the restaurant. Once I arrived, I parked in Curbside Stall 4 and completed my order, this was at 2:24pm. Then, I started to play a game on my phone while I waited. After a while, I realized that my food still hadn't arrived, this was at 2:34pm. 10 minutes had passed and still no food, so I got out of my car and went into the restaurant. I waited to speak with the cashier, when the expediter asked me if I needed help. This person was the Shift Manager, I explained that I have been outside in spot 4 waiting for my food. She went and brought me a bag from the back counter. I asked her, ""Has my food has been sitting up there all this time?"", she responded with, ""Yes"". I asked, why it had not been brought out to me, since I had used to curbside option. She said, that she didn't know why and that it just shows up on her screen. About this time the Facility Manager showed up, I guess trying to figure out what the problem was. I explained to her everything I had told the Shift Manager. Her excuse was, that they don't get a lot of mobile orders so they didn't know what to do. This is such a lame excuse, especially from a Facility Manager. I asked her for a copy of my receipt and she said that she could not find it on her machine. I was already running late so I just asked for my bag of food and I had to ask for my cup as she didn't even have it ready for delivery. I informed them that I had planned to filing a complaint with their home office. I got my drink and was walking out the restaurant, when an employee stopped me and gave me a card for a free meal for my troubles. I asked her name, it was Christine. I thanked her and wished her a good day as she got into her car to leave. I can't believe that neither the Shift Manager nor the facility Manager, even tried to make this gesture. I ate my food on my to work and EVERYTHING was COLD. I don't have to tell anyone how bad cold fries and chicken strips are. I was hungry, so I ate what I could stomach. To top it off, I was 15 minutes late for work and dock that time of pay. 

This was the worst experience I have ever had with McDonalds. I have already told my fellow VA employees and some relatives about this horrific experience. I can't believe that this is the deplorable level of customer service from two of your managers. They need immediate retraining on this excellent program of yours and then ensure that ALL of their employees are familiar with the procedures to avoid another customer experiencing the same poor customer service I did.",vY8bKerNpXRkDbGx6_L9TQ,1,0,1,KLdsxuSNnAbxZE4bJjfMaw

The miserable experience began with us placing our breakfast orders.  The cashier must've gone hard on the Vegas paint the night before because he could NOT get our order right if his job and life depended on it.  Normally, this would be quite frustrating but I get it...it's New Years weekend and you're stuck behind a McD's cash register at the crack of dawn #thestruggleisreal.

However, the empathy felt for the cashier quickly wore off as informs us that they are all out of orange juice. Say what? We proceed to ask if we can wait until they make more only to have him repeat that they are completely out of OJ.  Dafuq? Can someone tell me how this is possible? I stood there wondering if he was going to tell me they were all out of egg mcmuffins and hasbrowns next. In the interest of not exhausting our hangover any further, we opt for apple juice instead.

Just when we thought we avoided a headache, we find out a bigger migraine was around the corner. The most unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful witch, wearing a manager's outfit, started bagging up our order.  She shouts our number and tosses us the bags and walks away. Zero condiments in the bags and ZERO customer service...I'm not sure why I am surprised because who has ever been to a McDonalds that actually offered customers any condiments? -_-

Since our order was a bit larger than the average order, we do a quick check to see if we have everything. Naturally, the order was incorrect.  Not only were we missing parts of our order but we got items we didn't even order and in the wrong quantities, no less.

When we try to point the errors out to her, she gives us a look that should be reserved for someone who runs over your dog and laughs about it.  Her devil horns begin to show and it felt like her devil tail slapped me in the face as she rips the receipt out of my hand to inspect our claims of her incompetency.

As she goes thru the receipt line by line, she still had the nerve to continue insisting the order was correct. Excuse me, lady, but you are talking to a veteran McFatty with many years of McD's visits under her belt, so there is no way I am going to mistake a plain Egg Mcmuffin for a Sausage Egg McGriddle...

Eventually, she caves and starts correcting our order, while she yammers on about how she does not know why the order was wrong. Not a single apology was uttered. We bite our tongues and spare her the ""I told you so"" attitude because we were now battling the onset of the migraine she was inflicting on us. 

While we waited for her to figure out our sandwich orders, I reminded her that I still did not get the cups for the drinks we ordered.  She flies back to the counter on her witch's broom to INSIST that she gave us the cups already. She must've had a sudden bout of amnesia bcs. didn't we just review the receipt and determine that certain things were missing i.e. our drinks????

After waiting for what felt like eons, our order was finally corrected...minus the lack of condiments, cream, and sugar, etc.  At this point, none of had the willpower to battle McSatan for some ketchup, so we just grabbed our items and hightailed it to the car.  Needless to say, our breakfast home from Vegas was filled with very black, bitter coffee and very cold sandwiches...much like that manager's very black, bitter and very cold heart. 

I don't care how hungover or high you are or how convenient this McD's is to wherever you are...DO NOT COME HERE!!! if you're in Vegas and the only options were to go here or Timbuktu for a quick bite to eat, I'd have my credit card, passport, and my neck pillow set for the McFlight to Africa.",AXaHXqSO9KX4JCsHQ3gJAg,2,1,1,YeUQdp9GucibdVCwe0FWLg

When I got to the store, there was no one in line and no one behind the counter.

I know teens work here as most McDonalds but have the decency to let people enjoy their meal without having to hear all that nonsense.  I then went to get my diet coke only to find out after i drank a large one that it was not in fact diet.  Some kid that worked there was like oh the diet is Dr pepper, the coke is diet, the water was sprite etc.  How could the managers not know this and why did this employee not tell anyone.  When i asked all they said was we don't know its hooked up in the back correctly.  IF that's the case then the sodas should of been right but they were not and that is not healthy for diabetics and people that cannot have sugar.  The one manager offered me a bottle water which was nice and I asked for a refund on my drink.

What's even more frustrating is the idiot at the very last window (where u were supposed to make an order) was just casually talking to the first car in front of us for nearly 45 min, NOT even bothering to tell us whether there was something wrong because the wait was just too fckn long! Fck ur terrible service!!!",uhNSFfVqC_mQeC4eVCQn1A,0,0,1,s4HblAFmSnOyU5OOqEci4w

Still waiting. 10 minutes passes, our # disappears. Not in que to serve. A man is going through his bag he received and says hey, this isn't my order. Gives it back to them, they go through it and tell him, sorry, and they PUT IT BACK ON SHELF TO RESELL!!! WTF?? IT GOES IN THE GARBAGE!!! Should have video tapped that!! Never got our order, got a refund and walked out. They have our order to that man who went through it and were going to try and give it back to us?? Screw you and shame on you McDonalds!!! You are being reported and I hope you get caught on film once and get cited and then fire those employees that fo this!!!",6Y2jcgAxpog6s_Ky8z-cLA,0,0,1,SA7khrONs8mhXZRSJDFpLQ

On top of that, she took FOREVER to give me back change. It is not like I paid with a hundred dollar bill. It was $2.17. I paid with $10 and the change was only $7.83.

The third time, I was able to place the order, but the service was so slow that I could have ordered at any of the other food places, eaten, and then written this review. 

In fact, as I am writing now, I still have not gotten my food.

Edit: They just called guest 231. I'm 217. Still no food.  Been 15 minutes since I last posted.

I always come in to study since this McDonald's  seems like a nice and quiet place to study after-hours, but the associates here are loud, and sometimes get out of hand. You tend to overhear all the at-work drama and complaints of the workers. 

It's barely midnight and they apparently shut off their ice cream machine and don't tell you until you're ready to pay. Seriously, what McDonald's has their ice cream machine shut off? Oh and my apple pie was cold AF from sitting too long and previously over-browned from baking too long. How do they manage to do that?!

Two stars for having guests feel awkward during their dine-in and two stars for their inadequate system of delivering less than ok food.",73Fr0L-euanFlnhQlUkdTg,0,0,2,ISdKxnryJ52vjjI3-9rmwQ

5846626,2017-11-09,0,KMxrk1YDlj_qFI1JXK4zRg,"Maybe it's just my luck, but this McDonald's always seems to get my order wrong or the food is just plain nasty. The chicken nuggets were always soggy or stale, you could tell they had been sitting there for a while and then thrown back into the oil/fryer when I ordered them and the fries were soggy as well, or cold.. smh
So for a while I stopped going to this one. But I do stop by once in a while for a drink or dessert, something quick and easy. I've learned my lesson when it comes to their food.
I came by the drive through a few days ago on my way to work to get a sweet tea, and after driving away I take a drink and of course it was unsweetened! Yes I know it's only a dollar so I didn't make a big deal about it, I just tossed it. 
So last night we went to the dispensary and decided to stop by this location (it's the closest to my place) and get a couple of hot fudge sundaes, you know for the munchies lol.. first they took forever in taking our order, then when we get our order, we drive away and I turn the car light on to look at them. I'm not too sure if they changed something but the ""hot fudge"" was frozen. You could break it apart, almost like if it was a dipped cone. 
I've worked in food before, and to me this looks like it was put into the freezer after the ""hot fudge"" was poured on it. Maybe someone ordered it and then changed their mind, whatever the situation was it definitely was not ""hot fudge""
Think twice before going to this location.",3ajSADFnm71e_Zcip_igWQ,0,0,2,Bh1kSr0B8SPVi0qljHRVuw

Normally I would not take the time out to complete a Yelp review for this establishment however this location is really nice! It has that College lounge relaxing atmosphere that is welcoming for students and all who want some chill time. Nice comfy cushy black pleather chairs and small intimate tables, colorful art on the walls, easy to relax, eat, study, or use their wi-fi for Internet access.

All you can drink serve yourself fountain drinks are always a plus at McDonald's! The only thing is they do not keep the fresh brewed iced tea or sweet tea out like other locations do so you will have to ask for refills on that. 

The food is good and the staff is fast and ready to go with your order!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,7,3,jXAz-kCN-cwvMkSzkENWbg
