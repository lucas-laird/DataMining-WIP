You can't pour canned gravy over frozen fries and call it poutine.  We were at The Tuscany for a dart tournament over the weekend. Should have guessed, when the escalator didn't work for the entire weekend, that we weren't dealing with a very upscale place anyways...Service at Pub 365 was spotty at best.  But we were told they have been through an entire wait staff, several bartenders, three or four chefs, and 2 or 3 managers since they opened the end of July, so I guess that says something.  my guess is that the great reviews for this place were written by the owners or family..

We were having fun and had spent $200 in food and drinks until the bartender didn't want to continue serving us drinks. I guess our fun was intimidating to them.

I was intrigued about the loyalty rewards app Mug Clubs where you can earn merch and a possible trip for sampling a bunch of the unique beers. I played dumb with my server Veronica and was impressed how quickly she informed me and walked me through getting the app all setup.

The first beer she recommended after I wouldn't give her any direction on preference had jalape√±o flavoring. I immediately obliged as my Mexican half started salivating. In the app I gave the El Heffe a 4 star review but my Mothers beer the Strawberry Lime Cider was definitely worthy of 5 stars. 

The Hangover Burger with egg on it as well as the enchiladas with egg were fantastic. The nachos were a little small however the flavor was pretty awesome and our excellent server did clarify that in advance.

Beers fantastic since all they have to do is pour it. Customer service, lacking, unattentive, and just unsatisfactory.

Got our beer our food and basically never heard from him again, though he was right in front of us it still took him 20 mins to get our check. Then another 15 just to give us the wrong change.

1132835,2016-10-28,1,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"So my girl and I were excited to check this place out as we both love our beers and wanted to try a new place. When we got there we opted to sit at the bar and they had the baseball game playing. 

So we sit down and right away we get greeted and handed menus. Within a minute they asked us if we had picked out what we wanted to drink, told them to give us a few more mins, but before the bartender left I asked if he could put the Dodgers game on the tv in front of were I was sitting and they did. After a few more minutes a second bartender came by and took our drink order. Both my girl and I were happy and very impressed with everything Pub 365 had to offer. 

Then it went down hill from there, and it didn't get any better. After we decided what we wanted to eat we waited for a bartender to check up on us to place the order but 10mins turned in 15mins. At this point an older fellow sits next to me and within 10mins they have taken he's drink and food order. We decide to wait to see if anyone comes to us, and still no luck. Even for a bar area of 20-25 sits w/ 3 bartender they still could manage to even take our food order or simply check up on us. Well we finish our drinks and place the empty glasses close to the edge of the bartender's side and even then they still didn't check on us. So at this point we decide we going somewhere else. I place my card in the glass that had our bill and 10mins go by and nothing. At this point the guy next to me has finished his food, drink, paid and is long gone. I literally had to wave a bartender down just to take my card to pay for my bill. I probably could have left and they wouldn't have even noticed.

Really disappointed as I was thinking of making it a regular spot for me since I'm right down the street. It's hard to believe that between 3 bartenders and about an hour there We only managed to get one drink each and were never check on again after the initial order. Now this wasn't a busy night there were empty bar sits and empty tables in the place so I really don't know why such a bad service. I actually went to another bar that night that was twice as busy and only had 2 bartenders and they still managed to offer better service there w/ less bartenders.

So since I only got to order one beer out of the 365 then I'm giving this place 1 star. Won't b going back because it will take me another hour just to try another one of their beers.",-SnGq6dVUOSJZEqDu1TqpQ,1,0,1,funkUa0ZmSIMcEbw4AwAPA

Last night I came in for the Breakfast and Beer pairing for dinner Event. Also I actually found a beer that I enjoyed here at Pub 365 last night!

Pub 365 is located inside Tuscany Hotel and Casino off the Strip. It has become a place where locals go, I know this because I have friends who go here! There are also tourists, so there is a good mix of both. Parking is free too and there is a lot of it.

Pub 365 is a haven for the beer culture. So it is not a surprise that I actually found a beer that I do like. Drum rolls please... it was the Founders Brewery Backwards Bastard. Figures I would enjoy a beer named the Backwards Bastard! Also, from what I hear from my beer drinking friends, this places is fantastic for craft beers- whatever that means! ;)

As for food, it is upscale Pub Food so if you come in with a beer drinker and you are not, just eat. The burgers are quite popular here but there are also tacos, salads and small bites. The first time I came in I had the Poutine, which was was pretty darn good. I mean who does not like fries topped with cheese curds and gravy? Their version adds bacon and an egg on top- oh yum! Then they also serve traditional Pub food like Fish and Chips or Steak Frites, which is pretty much steak and fries. 

Like I mentioned, everything is upscale Pub Food, so the traditional fare of food served in a bar has been upgraded here so you cannot go wrong with anything you choose. For you people who are part of that Beer Culture, Cheers!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,9,9,4,43JUeAL3QLCgQo1DL-cCTw

Anyway, I already knew the beer selection would be above par due to their extensive menu and because their barman works in and knows the local craft scene. You can join their beer club and win fun prizes in addition to delightful inebriation. But to be serious for a moment, having a bar with an ability to pair a beer with the select foods they offer, that's a blessing in this town that is still slow to embrace the diversity of the craft scene. P365 nails it, though. 

NEXT, my dining companion and I ordered two entre√©s: the steak and the seared ahi tuna. I'll mention again how low my expectations were, as these are sort of run-of-the-mill pub dishes. When they brought to our table, however, we knew we were in for something special. The plating alone was a sight to behold and made for easy photographs. Jenn's steak was rare as she requested and seasoned just enough to highlight that hunkahunka meat. A filling slab and right on price point.

My seared ahi? I lived in Hawaii for several months and have had my fair share of seared ahi elsewhere. P365's  will go down as one of the few memorables. It was perfect, seasoning exquisite, and not a hint of over-heating in the middle. Delish.  And that accompanying chopped spinach couscous salad?  I raved!  Jenn laughed, ""you're thrilled by the salad?? Must be fantastic.""  It was. The perfect compliment. 

We were so impressed, we went the glutton route and ordered a side of the braised beef mac&cheese as part of our Vegas mac&cheese exploratory tour. Another impressive execution, with a full, creamy base, tender flavorful beef, the right noodle choice for the job, and a visually-appealing overflowing cast iron dish. Later we asked what accounted for the experience had; our waiter gave a knowing smile and just said, ""we have a new chef, and he's made some appreciable changes.""  No kidding, sir.  The man responsible? Chef Juan Vazquez. I hope to shake hands next time I'm through. 

We rounded out the evening with one more splurge. Jenn wanted the s'mores, and I rolled my eyes. How boring! 
How wrong I was. Another pleasant visual, this is enough for 2-4 people. Don't go it alone! This isn't your campfire s'mores, either--its base is a smokey pastry shell, quality melted chocolate, medium toasted marsh', and a whipped lite topping. It's surprisingly light for what it is, so you won't cramp. I love being wrong sometimes. 

To conclude, our evening started out as 3-stars when we walked in, due to an absent and then fumbling hostess who told us to wait though we were at the front of the line. She prioritized some folks behind us who, she claimed, had been there earlier and had come back. Mmm, no, not with this many tables open. Or at least figure a more respectable way to manage that after we'd been standing there with no one greeting us for several minutes already. The volume can get rather deafening, too, as they pipe some loud tunes--all good selections!--but conversations at all surrounding tables elevated to near shouting. These are minor flaws, though.

So, a healthy 4-stars. I'll be back and definitely recommend this joint.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,9,7,4,REgqqTvUwVy_BYGBD3GUiA

We were super stoked seeing a 20% off your entire purchase at Pub 365 coupon waiting for us in our hotel room at Tuscany. The winning line was seeing they have 365 beers !! After that long drive from San Diego all we wanted was a cold ass frosty beer lol. Not too much to ask for in Vegas at a 365 beer pub right??? WRONG LOL!!!

We ordered a miller lite draft and a strawberry lime cider. Both came out at a below good drinking temp. Literally both were semi luke warm and not a bit of cold or frost. The glasses were warm which we all know doesn't help. At a pub with 365 beers , number one should be a cold frosty glass. It's all in the details. We asked the waiter for a cold glass and he told us they don't do that there because it can get really busy and the glasses rotate too fast. We were one of 3 small groups there. This wasn't a busy time lol. So he went back to try to find a cold glass but unfortunately came back with no luck. The server offered us another glass but what would another warm glass do to help lol ? So Pops drank half. Usually he'd down 3 to 4 in that period of time. 

Same thing with my cider. It was a draft semi cold in a warmer than room temp cup. I drank half, then gave it to my sister to finish. She took one sip and said BARF!

Needless to say... YOU GUYS NEED TO GET COLD GLASSES  FOR YOUR (LUKE) WARM BEERS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BE A DRAFT BEER PLACE LOL! When we made the suggestion to them, they just blew us off like we didn't know what beer drinkers want lol. WE WANT COLD BEER IN A COLD GLASS!",VbZpfGj4u0swvo8KPjlyIA,7,5,1,8gVJRm4rZxlXjX84vvTuTA

We also ordered the fried pickles. I've never had them before and they were quite good! The breading stayed crispy after sitting there for awhile. As for my drink, I ordered Tropic of Capricorn. It gave me a good buzz but I'm a featherweight. It was a little fruity-not too much, just real refreshing. Their rib tacos were great too.

Our servers name was Veronica and she made sure our glasses stayed full and kept bringing our drinks. She didn't disappear like other servers do. She was one of the best servers!

The beer list is great, but really elevated by how much the staff knew about it. The food on the other hand... UNREAL. The unicorn burger (with bacon) was my favorite, but the enchiladas, nachos, and steak and egg tacos were all out of this world too. Onion rings, fried asparagus, chicken wings, and ahi poke were our favorite appetizers, literally had them every time we went in. I only got to see the burger with pastrami, but definitely getting that next time (it looked SO good) and maybe one of the flat breads too. To top it off, even if you're staying at a strip hotel, this place is easy to get to and find parking, and absolutely needs to be a staple of any Vegas visit. Being open until 3 am was a lifesaver on one night. I think by the end the only regret I had here was not trying one of the desserts, and maybe ordering too many appetizers the first night to actually be able to order an entree.

Amazing turkey burger called The Tom. I like to get it lettuce wrapped.  The patty is so flavorful and moist. Nothing like a demur turkey patty to kill a meal, right?  Well, The Tom is the opposite. And. I am glad that I order it without the bun to accommodate my keto diet because by not having the bun, I am able to eat the whole turkey patty.  As good as the patty is, I think my favorite part is the lemony arugula. It's the magical touch that ties all the flavors from the turkey, tomato and avocado together. Oh, and the bartenders are super nice. 

There was one horrible waitress, but whatever. We just moved to the bar after closing out our food tab. Glad we did, because it's the friendly and attentive bartenders who keep us coming back.

Keep in mind that $45 bottle may not be worth $45. You're paying for it to be there, not that it's that good. Stick to the draft list if you don't want sticker shock.

Oh and I love a place that separates the beer by type. Makes selecting much easier.

The food was pretty good too. I had the mac and cheese burger, which was way more food than I could handle, but it was tasty. Most of their menu looked really good.

4107087,2018-01-17,5,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"It took about a year, but I'm back and I get it.

Pub 365 is an institution at the Tuscany Suites and Casino a few blocks away from the Strip. They have alcohol, including plenty of beer, and food.

I've been here twice recently for the beer. Perhaps I slowly developed some interest in craft beers over the past year, including events at this location and at the nearby pool at Tuscany, but my friend helped to open the floodgates a couple of months ago visit to a local brewery to try a variety of house drafts and guest drafts. Then he invited me here and I was able to sample various offerings in his beer flight while also trying my own CBS.

That's the Canadian Breakfast Stout by Founders Brewing, for those of you who don't speak craft beer. It's an expensive and highly sought-after beer, and rightly so. This beer is a rich and layered experience and was available last month on draft, meaning that it's stored to maintain freshness and poured to order.

Draft beers are important for beer connoisseurs because the quality/freshness is certainly more consistent if not higher than bottles that may have been sitting around for months. Pub 365 maintains a rotating offering of 40 draft beers, along with many other packaged beers including pricey/rare offerings which they refer to as ""Unicorn Beers."" These beers are printed on Pub 365's menus and are also constantly updated through a handy third-party app / web site (you know the one, I hope).

So I came back again on my own earlier tonight (or ""last night"" by now, I suppose), and I went for a flight of beers. Pub 365's always-on pricing is $10 for 3 pours of about four ounces each. Because I've developed an appreciation for stouts and especially barrel aged beers, I asked for some heavy hitters - and got them.

Yes, the bartender poured out Founders DKML (a plan B because Founders KBS had just run out, and that's not a typo of CBS), Founders Backwoods Bastard, and Evil Twin / Lervig Big Ass Money Stout for me. Those are far from inexpensive, even by craft beer pricing standards, so I was happy to get the chance, and I definitely had a great time enjoying the aroma and flavors of all of my selections.

If you read to this part hoping that I'd say something about the food, then your patience is about to be rewarded. Yes, I ended up ordering some food after happy hour rolled around (the 11pm-2am reverse HH, not the 3-6pm deal). I was considering grabbing some fries (with small tastes of the normal and sweet potato varieties having both impressed me during the CBS visit), but I was aware of HH and decided to bide my time.

Offered at $2 a piece, the Carnitas taco, the Fire Grilled Chicken taco, and Pulled Pork slider were all reasonably delicious for my hungry, inebriated self. I do wish that they'd doubled up on the 4-inch tortillas, but the meats were seasoned right, not overcooked, and dressed with at least semi-authentic ingredients. I was also pleasantly surprised by the moderate heat of the jalape√±os in the slider. Definitely would order these if I'm hungry and visiting for happy hour again.

Service was friendly by all bartenders/employees/managers, and they always offer refills on water. The classic rock and occasional more contemporary rock weren't too loud. My seat was quite comfortable for the duration. The only issue was the occasional odor of bleach from the cleaning of beer glasses, so I'll have to remember to sit elsewhere next time if possible.

Pub 365 is an excellent place for craft beer fans (and it does offer plenty of other alcohol) and has a solid food menu to accompany the refreshments. I will definitely return soon.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,6,5,TLwIF2Smi0kdGt18tblNeA
4145038,2017-09-02,0,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"What a great option for the Tuscany ! As a long time Tuscany player I do love the option of coming here. the food is freshly prepared and it's great that you can sit at the bar and try new brews on tap or one of the many bottle options, my favorite being the passion fruit and strawberry lime ciders yummy !! I have had many of their dishes and hands down the poutine and "" I'm not a burger"" are my faves but this last visit I did go with a chicken Caesar salad while not on par with their lil arugula salad it was still a satisfying choice , the dressing was just enough to let the freshness of the lettuce come thru and not overly seasoned either maybe a little more salt would have done the trick, but the star was the chicken, you have the option of adding it to any salad and it is always plump and juicy and I believe cooked to order ! As for service I always sit at bar and receive the greatest service there, the bartenders are quick and friendly and offer samples of some of the tap beers if you are sitting on the fence about one or the other and their beer list is HUGE !! Downfalls are that burgers are not served with sides other than a pickle or handful of freshly made chips, but fries and other sides are available and usually one side is enough to share, also wait time on food is a bit long but the end result is worth the wait and I'm usually playing poker or sampling beers at bar so really not an issue with me , but can see it being one as a regular diner !",WfbJKGJWj2yQ50XRku-OzQ,0,0,4,v7tycl57axqD2OdVF1ymIw
4147048,2017-02-25,0,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"What's all the hubbub about pub grub?  Well, I'll tell you, its damn good food.  Have you ever had a French Dip sandwich?  Yeah, me too.  But have you had one with brisket for the meat? I have now thanks to Pub 365.  I had it the other night for dinner.  It had nice thick cuts of tender coffee rubbed brisket, sharp Swiss cheese and grilled onions.  Of course it came with a side of au jus for dipping.  It wouldn't be a French DIP with out the DIP.  

The sandwiches here don't come with sides so I ordered a separate side of sweet potato fries. They were a bit overcooked for my liking but still good regardless of the darker color. I started out using the ketchup that come on the side but eneded just eating them plain.  Why hide the natural sweetness of the potato if you don't have to. 

My dad ordered a pulled pork sandwich partly based on my suggestion.  I had tried it previously and knew he would enjoy it.  He also ordered a side of pub chips (homemade potato chips). I tried one to see how they are.  Homemade chips are always better than store bought but that doesn't mean I cared much for them.  They were good and all but I don't care for potato chips.  Thats why I ordered my sweet potato fries.

We each got a beer to round out the evening.  In a place that serves 365 beers, one for every day of the year, you are sure to find exactly what you are looking for.  For me, that was a Kapuziner Weissbeir.  For my dad, a boring Bud Light.  Clearly I don't get my taste in beer from my dad.  Anyhow, Pub 365 has this awesome beer club that you can join.  The more different beers you drink the more you benefit from the club.  I believe a manager even told me that trying all 365 beers could win you a trip to a brewery somewhere in the US.  An all expenses paid trip just for drinking.  Hell yeah!  Sign me up.  I don't know that I will ever get to try all 365 but I think its a cool deal.

It is loud inside Pub 365.  Especially if you are seated right below the speaker as my dad and I were the other night.  At least its good music.  Mostly rock from the late 60s and 70s.  Works for me.  The beer could be colder but it is cool and tasty.  And the food is good.  Thats the important thing.

So that is the hubbub about pub grub.  And now you know.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,2,4,KKORkE_klmVlxyfYDKRTUA

Pub is a no smoking area, but you can smoke right when you step out the door in the casino. Aside from ordering some beers and a couple well drinks, we only tried the chicken tacos, which were surprisingly good.

Considering that the place's name is ""Pub 365"", due to the assortment of beers they serve, my boyfriend and I were expecting more of an international beer selection mixed with craft and regular beers as opposed to just craft and regular.

The server said it would come out fast. More than half an hour later we wanted to just leave. We had to ask if our food was ready.... finally they brought out two of three plates and told us that they didn't have the tacos available. Why didn't they tell us this right when the order went in?? So we can choose something else. I guess they just don't care about their representation after midnight. Which is odd... because this is Vegas!

They have an amazing selection of brews on tap including the new nitro-infused beers that are dangerously smooth.   You can gulp 3 pints of those in 10 minutes if you're not careful.    Go during Happy Hour to score beers for $3.65

The menu is predominantly man food with big sandwiches and burgers.   I got the brisket dip and it was fantastic.    Servers were friendly and prompt.   Lots of TV's to watch the game.

Well done Tuscany.   This casino continues to be one of the best places to earn and spend comps.    Pub 365 will be a regular stop on every trip from now on.",3z1_BfMr63EnM60N6AfQCA,3,1,4,R3k1kTMzB3dusVjZbgoSIw

Great after work place for locals and because it's in a Casino close to the Strip good recommendation for guests from out of town who don't want to deal with BS and drink great beer and have a good time!!",dYFks-gKmcFZssfhIyc8Pw,0,1,5,_Sin0Fzpf4uM_MofMpRCGQ

I had the ""IPA Nachos"" they were simple, but amazing. The chips are made in house, and the IPA infused cheese is creamy, and delicious. It's all topped off with black beans to balance out the flavor. 

Our server Veronica was great. Very knowledgable about the beer and food even tho it was only the second day into the soft opening. Her recommendations were spot on for what everyone in the party was looking for.

From what I understand, they opened a couple days early for our group.  That is service!  For a new restaurant, they had the feel of a place that was seasoned.  I never felt like they were brand new, nothing felt clunky at all.

The food was really good.  They had some burgers, some poutine, and some salads.  The Caesar salad I had was really very good.  They serve beers and ciders.  I had a cider that was also very good.  The drink menu was huge and a little daunting.  The food was great though and we came back twice with large groups.",neCjbLj5gLqqc7lJDCkCpQ,0,0,4,FhrDSg6YCUE1wqlFWm7XSw

5674563,2017-09-25,1,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"I would say it's more of like a 3.5 or 3.75, but I'll be generous and round up.

I went recently for a ""meet the brewer"" event from a local brewery and it was my 1st time at Pub 365. It's been on my list of places to try for awhile, but I hardly find myself in the area. This event gave me a great excuse to go, and I am mostly glad that I did.

If you aren't familiar with where the Pub is located - it's inside of the Tuscany Hotel and Casino, near Flamingo/Koval. Since I had never been there, I wasn't sure where to park and I ended up in the wrong place. If you go, park on the backside of the hotel or in front of where it says ""casino"" on the building, not where hotel registration is. It's not a huge deal, just a much further walk. I also don't believe that there is valet, which is odd for Vegas.

The restaurant is pretty good size, but I found it kind of odd that there was actually a hostess. It was a Tuesday night and not very crowded, it seems like people probably could've just seated themselves. I just went straight to the bar, where I met my friends. Although it wasn't very busy, it took a ridiculously long time to get drinks. The bartenders were very nice, just very slow. I don't know what the situation was, but one was more focused on doing dishes than helping customers, which is super frustrating. Eventually I got their attention and got beer, so it's really not the end of the World.

They have a great selection of beer, including many local varieties, which is great. They have a fantastic happy hour menu and also feature discounted beers for $3.65 each during that time. 

I am really glad that I tried the food. I ordered the taquitos and they were really good! It was a large portion and they were only $9. They were quite delicious and I told my husband about them when I got home - he works at UNLV and is always looking for good lunch spots nearby. 

They have something called ""Club 365,"" which is a club for the beer drinkers. Members earn rewards for every new beer they drink and there is currently a regular with almost 500 different beers! I doubt I will ever be on that level, but it's something to aspire to!

Overall, it was a good experience. I look forward to going back to try more of their food and drink lots more beer!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,4,IY91CabN_JUtWAC45nRWzw
5720461,2016-07-23,0,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"A buddy of mine and I stopped into Pub365 for a couple of drinks after he had noticed that it was new to the Tuscany(He is a long time local). It's very clean and the atmosphere seems appropriate, but I would attribute that to it being brand new. We sat down at the bar and were helped immediately, even though we managed to snag the last two seats at the bar. The beer list was a bit daunting at first,  but the bartender was kind enough to sit and talk with me about what beer I may like the most. Since I enjoy Brooklyn lager(As I had just moved from new York), she suggested a lager called Joseph James. It was exactly as I had hoped. Me and my companion put some money in the video poker machines and managed to get through quite a few drinks before realizing we had stayed much longer than we had planned. Everyone was very friendly and I probably got a bit addicted to the video machine to be honest. Upon getting our bill we realized they had comped a few of our drinks for playing the machines. This is new to me and always quite welcome. Even though we were not quite as good at video poker as we had hoped, we had a very nice time and wound up spending much more time in the pub than we had originally planned. Over all we had a very nice time and plan to return to have a sit down meal in the near future.",B-LxgNYMf1p1g2DXUj9FTw,4,1,5,6xyfOeWVUqbnD10j3CymBA
5773639,2016-09-06,10,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"I'm going 4.5 stars for this spot because the food is delicious, the prices are fair, and the service was outstanding!!! The 1/2 star off was not enough sours on the beer menu.

Located inside the Tuscany casino, this quaint little pub is nicely decorated. A large gaming bar shaped like an L provides a lot of seating. Located right across from the William Hill sportsbook, its a great place to make a bet and watch some football games. 

We ordered the ahi poke appetizer, the poutine appetizer (wow), and drunken chicken entree. Everything was delicious and plenty of food. The poutine with pulled pork and an egg on top was excellent...I couldn't stop stealing bites of this from my buddy. 

The beer selection is massive, they have 40 beers on tap, and another 100 or so bottle selections. They also have a ""rare"" beer menu featuring some outstanding craft beers you can't find. If you are a connoisseur of fine beverages, you should check out this menu. 

Service was great with the two bartenders, and the table servers were hustling around. They have a pretty large area with several tables, so if you have a big group I think you can easily get seated here, it wasn't that crowded on a Sunday Labor Day evening. 

For the prices this place will be frequented often by myself. Not a typical casino ripoff, they are fair and if you hit up the happy hours (3-6pm and after 11pm), an even better deal.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,24,22,4,9u3eLzRELeTRaaMhsEDgHw

Everyone was bad chicken that couldn't be eaten, not sure what happened but they looked weird and shouldn't have been served to anybody.

First got seated at the bar waited 15 mins for someone to help us. We told him we wanted to order our food first then get our drinks. They said no I have to make the drinks first then it still took him 10 mins to get our drink order. Then after he made my nasty lemon drop we wanted to order our food but no he went to help someone else and make their drinks then after 20 mins he came back to us and we ordered. We ordered our food then after he took the order and put it in the computer he came back to double check our order to make sure it was right. The took almost 30 mins to get our food and I would say the food was not good at all. Never again going back. You messed up our 8 year anniversary.,chmMA6zqvDy7EdO5kssYLA,0,0,1,iRf2z51By_fzn5WPshKhJw
5837861,2018-05-27,2,2Wl4o7l54I-EtxtaDpOTzA,"Diane and I ate here for lunch right after a short Staycation, and I found the Poutine, pulled pork bathed in a very mild BBQ sauce with unusual slightly melted squares of cheese curds, to be a very good starter.  A half-pound Manhattan Montana Burger conjoined with lean sauteed pastrami, pickles, Swiss Cheese, and Spicy Mustard, was good but the pastrami was tough and the Black Angus Beef patty not that flavorful.  Homemade Pub Chips accompanying this artisan burger were stiff and a little spicy.  I enjoyed the French Fries that went with Diane's Fish & Chips much more.  They were slightly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

Three large filets of golden and lightly battered fish were included that provided a welcome slight crunch on the outside but not that much flavor on the inside.  Service was friendly and attentive.  And the pub ambiance very conducive to watching sports events on the several television screens placed throughout the cavernous room.  And all manner of beers were available aplenty.

The drinks: yummy concoctions. We had a bourbon and sour and The Angry Lion -which is a mixed drink to include angry orchard cider and bourbon with lime juice and all-spice- so refreshing and unique! 

The food: unbelievably delicious. We had the poutine for an appetizer. The fries were crispy the gravy was tasty, the egg and cheese curds on top.... Wow! For dinner we had the Baja fish tacos and the hangover burger. The fish tacos were loaded with a HUGE piece of battered cod and a creamy/zesty dressed cabbage slaw. The hangover burger was reported to be fabulous (I didn't personally try)

The service: while everyone was friendly, the service was slower than ideal. They DID just open, and it won't prevent me from coming back.

I attended a grand opening event 10 days after they opened to sample and sip the offerings at this new Pub! The decor is nice, it's typical brewpub atmosphere with a rustic touch, and they also have gaming at the bar. The main bar area is pretty big and there's a second room that could be used for private events. 

Though beer is the star of the show, I enjoyed their take on a Manhattan tremendously! It was prepared spot on and they even use fancy dark cherries for garnish. I also sampled a Joseph James brew, and this was very refreshing during the 110 evening. We had the chance to try different menu items such as nachos, sliders and mini doughnuts. The sliders were awesome and I would go back for more. The doughnuts could be topped with different sauces- a nice touch!

The beer is stored in a cold room behind the bar at 38F that ensure the best quality when served.

Recommend Crafthaus Jean Claude Belgium Ale, Victory Golden Monkey Tripel and Deshutes Black Butte Porter. The Pub comps the beer when playing VP machines.
