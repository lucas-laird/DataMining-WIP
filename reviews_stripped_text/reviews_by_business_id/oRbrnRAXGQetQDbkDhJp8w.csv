The place was already jumping, and we were glad to have reservations.  With a friend, our party was three.

Both were really outstanding.  Dessert was an almond and mascarpone tart.",ybOQaWY_F1dsq1XM-u8Q3Q,0,0,5,TSV7iaCwrAhK4W_BwaCRuQ

First time was excellent and went back searching for that great experience once more. But it didn't quite work out.

We had reservations, however when we arrived, our table wasn't available so we sat at the bar. After 30 minutes we checked back with the hostess and they claimed they 'looked everywhere' but also said 'I forgot you were at the bar.'  No biggie since we weren't in a hurry, but definitely something in the servics the restaurant can improve upon. 

And then dinner... I mentioned to our server that I couldn't have cheese, and I ordered the Strozzapreti prepared the exact same way as in my first visit where they replaced the parmesan cream with a delicious olive oil and garlic sauce. To our group's surprise, it came out with the creamiest, cheesiest, parmesan cream. My husband asked our waitress to confirm it had no cheese and she said it may taste cheesy but had no cheese. Seriously?   We both tasted it..and fortunately I was able to swap dishes with my husband since we both agreed I couldn't have this dish -super cheesy, the aged parmesan was definetly present. 
Sad to see that our experience was tainted and our favorite spot with great ambiance,  has fallen off our list because of a non-caring staff member that didn't even offer to prepare a new dish.
Sad all around. 
Even if the food is great, if they aren't able to cater to customer's needs, then it's a place we can't go to.",8GQ1L1Gn2ye-Lyyqf_zbIg,1,1,2,WYhchVLEWWlzLGvDHupHNQ

Our group of 8 ordered several appetizers, calamari on a bed of arugula was lightly battered and lemony delicious, meatballs, zucchini chips and grilled cauliflower. Each was so delicious and tasty! The dinner was even better from the homemade pasta dishes, salmon, short ribs and the pea soup was amazing. 

The service was fantastic.  Our server was friendly, attentive and offered suggestions of favorites which is always nice when trying to decide.  As expected for a newly opened place it was packed and yet the service did not suffer for it. We liked the atmosphere and watching the open kitchen through a big window was fun to see. 

Although we were full we saw desserts being served to our neighbors and had to order. The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had! And the Bombolini (Meyer lemon curd donuts!) were light and fluffy and delicious.

We couldn't wait on the pizza or else the other food would get cold. We waited 30 minute total for the fresh pizza. I think they never even made it because we sat right next to the kitchen and never saw the first one come out ""wrong"".

1020917,2018-02-18,1,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Had to try this place out. I'm a sucker for good handmade pasta, prosciutto pizza and crafty cocktails. 

This place is hopping with folks so expect to wait at prime time. Luckily the place is large and they are utilizing their outdoor seating with a covered patio and heaters. Inside is more fun as you can smell the aromas coming from the kitchen. 

For cocktails we got the Milano mule, it was tasty, unexpected it was served in a glass instead of a coppercup. The other cocktail we got was the Apple bourbon sour. It was very refreshing and tasted just like an apple cinnamon. It was smart how they didn't give a straw so you get the aroma of cinnamon. 

The prosciutto fig goat cheese pizza had very tender prosciutto, and was generally piled on. The goat cheese and fig added a nice sweet and savory fruity flavor with the arugula giving a good crunch. The crust was a little much, but it worked great as a delivery system for the goodies. 

The bolognese pasta was so delicious. The pasta was tender and the sauce beefy and tomatoey. I told my friend it tastes like pasta that if I had my own italian  grandma at home. A definite comfort food after a long week at work. 

The squid ink pasta was delicious. Perfect al dente and a little heat to warm you up inside. The seafood in the dish was just an add on. I could have just eaten the past by itself. It would also taste great with squid ink pasta and the bolognese sauce, would be perfect too.

Service was spot on at our visit. Water cups did not stay low for very long and we were checked on by our waitress multiple times.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,2,2,5,oNJ-K8dj-m3y_DQdVDWKbQ

I love how the fig and goat cheese complimented each other in the prosciutto pizza. The crust was neither stiff as a cardboard or too doughy. The chicken parm had all the right amounts of melted cheeses. The Pasta and meatballs was a good traditional taste, it did have a little spice to it that I liked.

1225218,2018-01-08,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Meh... I was dying to try this place after discovering it on yelp. The pictures were so captivating, I just had to try it. Sadly 3 Stars is a bit of a stretch for our experience at North. The food was lacking and the service was just awful. The waitress disappeared for long periods of time which led to our food being cold and us ultimately passing on desert strictly because of her poor service skills. 

Back to the food. After weeks of salivating over those fantastic images I still couldn't decide what I wanted, so needless to say, we over-ordered. See the results below.

Started with the calamari, white truffle garlic bread and the specialty pizza of the day. 

Fried calamari arrived on a bed of greens. The taste was very good, however it was cold. I think had the calamari been hot and greens cold this dish could have been elevated to the next level. 

Meatball pizza was just ""eh"".  We really only got it for research purposes, and I can honestly say, while it's not bad, it's not the reason to go here. 

Garlic bread was prepared very well. Soft inside and crispy outside. 

The Bolognese (house specialty) as well came out cold which was disappointing on a brisk winter day. A steaming hot bowl of pasta was just what was in order, I unfortunately had to settle for a lukewarm one. The pasta was good, the sauce was good... 

Chicken Parm was moist and not too fried or anything. Not great, not bad.

Overall, this was a disappointingly adequate meal. I am willing to give it another shot and hope for a hot meal and good service. Just not sure I'm in any rush to return.",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,1,0,3,n_Wgpw1-2U7eiTQzkDK1Tw

1260606,2018-01-23,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"I'm really torn on how to review this place.. I wanted to love it, and I've come away not really being sure how I felt. First of all, it's a wait to get seated since it's new. The decor is sleek and modern while still being comfortable.

The menu is relatively small, and moderately priced. Nothing cheap, perse, with a few entrees on the pricier side. We waited a really long time before anyone came over and got a drink order, then we waited some more. You know it's bad when the first 20 minutes of your dinner experience the conversation keeps going back to how thirsty you are. We eventually got our drinks and then after that the pace of the meal was better.

We had the kale salad which was actually the best thing we got, though the portion was not huge, definitely not enough for an entree portion. It was also missing the pancetta, which when you are paying over $10 for a cup and a half of kale, it needs to have all of it's ingredients. We also had the zucca chips which were super thin slices of zuchinni, very tasty, my son loved them, though they were a little on the oily side.

We also had the chicken pesto pasta which I didn't care for, it was very lemony and I couldn't taste any basil, it wasn't awful, but not at all what I'm looking for when I order pesto (typically one of my favorite dishes). We also had the fig and prociutto pizza, again, it was okay, not bad, not good, just okay. My son had kids buttered pasta and meatballs, (the meatballs we're very simple, but very good), (though, the noodles while cooked nicely, were decidedly butter-less). The kids pasta entree was a much larger portion than our adult pasta entree, which was disappointing.

Overall the portions are pretty small for the price, no bread on the table, no refills, the service was barely adequate, and for the money we spent, I could have had a really amazing meal at honey salt.

I'm not saying we wouldn't try it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. The bar might be nice to stop in for a drink and an appetizer or something, but again, for the money.. eh, you could probably do better. Or worse.. I don't know, it was the purgatory of all restaurant experiences. I wanted to be wowed and I just wasn't..

The inside of this place is beautiful.  It is very open, and there is a spacious patio as well.  The kitchen is in a glass room, which is pretty cool.

Service was extremely bland when we came in.  Our server pretty much lacked a personality.

The food was also pretty bland.  We ordered the calamari appetizer.  It was served with greens, which was an interesting twist on a calamari appetizer.  However there was no sauce, which was odd.  So we asked for a side of lemon aioli.  The calamari itself was chewy, not very good.

I ordered the the bacon and egg pizza, which came with asparagus, potatoes, garlic confit, and rosemary.  The rosemary was overpowering which pretty much ruined the dish.  My husband just ordered their daily soup, which was a chicken vegetable soup.  This was the best thing we had.

Awesome atmosphere, cool decor, very clean bathrooms. Perfect place to catch up with friends and talk. It wasn't noisy, although it might be during dinner when its busier.

The lunch menu had a lot to choose from. One of my friends has a few dietary issues and they were very accommodating. Our server explained the menu and was very helpful in ordering. Our food came our exactly as we requested it. 

They have gluten free crust for the pizza, one of my friends choose this and it looked amazing- she said it tasted great! I had the roasted vegetable salad which was super yummy and very filling, my other friend had a green salad with salmon.

The ambiance was lively and they had a bit of a wait for a table inside so id suggest making reservations on their website if youre coming any day around 6-8pm. 

Join there ebite club for $10 off a $20 purchase. Id go back considering their service,  quality and price point.

The best part, half price wine by the bottle on Sundays!! We got a bottle of prosecco for $18!! What a deal. This will be my new fav Sunday dinner place.
We started with their signature truffle ricotta bread which was delicious, however a bit pricy for $11. 
They even have a kids menu with all of the kids favorites. My kids tried the Alfredo pasta with grilled chicken which was delicious. My husband tried the strozzapreti, interesting name, our server told us that means ""strangle the priest""  It was pasta with Parmesan cream sauce, chicken, pine nuts and mushrooms. He loved it. I tried the burrata tortellini served in a light mushroom sauce. I thought it was just ok. I don't think I want to repeat that. 
For dessert we had their tiramisu which was absolutely delicious. Loved the little chocolate balls on top, added a nice crunch.

One thing I didn't like was that there is no bread on the house, you don't expect that from an Italian restaurant. The only bread option is the $11 truffle bread.

The restaurant has a bar and dining area and is ideal for meeting up, and socializing. The decor is modern rustic, the music was a bit loud. 

Food: The food had great flavors!  I ordered the braised beef pasta and my wife had the kale salad, the kids had the chicken fingers. My braised beef pasta the meat was tender  and the fresh pasta had bite to it definitely Al Dente, it was not soft. My pasta was great, I actually used the idea at home. The kale salad had the ingredients roasted, and pine nuts. Did not expect  the kale to taste good because it is kale. I was suprised that it was flavorful. The chicken fingers of my kids had some twist and it came out good flavor wise. Over all the food was good.   

Service: The staff that served us, missed some request which is totally understandable because of the amount of diners that they are serving is big we had to be on the wait list for 45 min before we got seated. Again please be patient  because the amount of people that dines in north italia is huge, because its new. Sevice should improve overtime. 

Overall: It's good food and would like to try the other entrees offerred by North Italia, the service should improve overtime. North  Italia is good for socializing since they have a bar to hang out, the food can be a great topic for conversation since its combinations that I did not expect to taste great but it did. Even copied the  braised beef pasta at home. I would to come back to North Italia in a few months to try other entrees.

After placing our orders I noticed that the waitress made no attempt to bring any bread to the table.  I finally asked our server if bread was available and she said yes and brought some over.  5 pieces of bread for the 5 of us.  Gee thanks.  After we finished our bread she came over and removed the bread plates and ""NEVER"" OFFERED TO ASK IF WE WANTED MORE BREAD"".  THIS IS AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT, RIGHT? Bread at an Italian restaurant is part of the eating experience.  I can only imagine that she was following some restaurant protocol where bread is not offered unless asked for and then give as little as possible in order to keep costs down.  But wait it gets better.  When our meals arrived my granddaughters portions of their kids meals were BIGGER than my wife's and my dinner portions.  My wife's $25.00 order of scallops consisted of 3 half-dollar size scallops,  3 tiny pieces of squash that could fit on a spoon, and maybe a half cup of risotto.  My Bolognese pasta dinner, the restaurant's signature dish, more closely resembled a side of pasta you might get somewhere else.  We were done eating before our granddaughters.  The funny part about the whole meal is that on the menu there is a section called ""small plates"".  Since my ""main course"" was so small I can only imagine that the small plates must come with a magnifying glass.

The pizza was pretty good. The crust was a little soft, even though I asked for it well done, but the toppings and flavor were top notch.

So we were back in Tucson a few weeks ago, and again had dinner there. Another excellent meal, with outstanding service. 

They told us there was now a North, here in Las Vegas. 

We went there this past Tuesday. What a disappointment!  The people were just going through the motions of service. While running by us, they asked how we were doing, without listening for a response. 

Plus we both ordered pasta dishes. They were terrible. I would rather go to Olive Garden.

Plus, with how bad the food was, it was pretty expensive. I would not mind the cost at all, if the service and food were anywhere near the quality of their Tucson branch. 

I would strongly suggest going to a different restaurant for Italian food!",F1VzIrmM2sEGA3lP7asrMQ,0,0,1,nHNQAFa0LFTiMAND9c9xDw

We ordered our drinks and food at approximately 6:15-6:20 and our server was consistently checking up on us when we received our drinks and appetizers, which was nice (received appetizers at 6:26, time stamp from photo of appetizers I took).  After we finished our appetizers, we noticed she was checking up on her other tables and hadn't been by, which is fine since we were waiting for our main course.  As it seemed like we were waiting a long time for our main course after receiving our appetizers, I checked my phone and it was 7:11pm.  We kept trying to get our servers attention to ask about the status of our main course, but before we got our server's attention our main course came out at 7:12 (time stamp from photo of main course I took).  After we finished our main course, a food runner brought out one Tiramisu which we ordered and one Panna Cotta which we did not order, we told them that we ordered the Salted Caramel Budino so he took it back.  Our server came by and asked us how our dessert was and she told us that they ran out of Salted Caramel Budino and that Panna Cotta is similar to it, while the server was at our table the food runner came back with the Panna Cotta again and said it was going to be a 15 minute wait for the Salted Caramel Budino, which we were agreed to wait for.  We waited approximately two minutes and a Salted Caramel Budino was brought out to us.

It is unusual that you limit the customer to a prefix menu and then inform them that by 7:30 one of their items is out.  I understand things run out, but I would have thought that our server would inform us that the Salted Caramel Budino is out and ask us if we wanted an alternative dessert instead of deciding for us and bringing out the Panna Cotta, without an explanation.  I saw other tables with other dessert items such as the Bombolini, which were not even offered to us.

Overall the food was excellent, however the service and communication could have been improved.  Our main course took longer than we would expect from a limited prefix menu and if our order was placed late, we should of had some communication from our server instead of avoiding us until our main course came out.  We noticed the table next to us arrive at least 45 minutes after us and they received their main course before we did.  As I said before, the food was excellent, but the service and communication could be greatly improved especially when the menu is a limited prefix menu.",1uW0TmyG_Top6BkYRXy9Cw,0,0,2,ezne7UwcVzotMX4aW6cJBw

The calamari appetizer has a different spin than most with a light tempura batter and a lemon glaze that gives it more zip than your usual plain breaded calamari app.  Was a big fan of it.  Comes on a bed of arugula for some extra greens.  I love me some arugula. 

We also split the prosciutto Pizza which was I thought was really good, but nothing to rave about...BUT my girlfriend thought it was the best pizza she had ever had in her life.  She's a big fig fan and a lover of prosciutto.  The goat cheese always makes everything good.  

The missus got the chicken pesto and despite my waiter telling me that my order of short rib radiatori was his favorite by far, I have to say that the chicken pesto was on par.  It was really good.  The Sauce us heavy leaving you feeling full and satisfied...and guilty. 

My short rib radiatori was just like the chicken pesto.  Excellent.  Very filling and satisfying.  A heavy dish for sure.  

Desserts were both really good.  Tiramisu (hard for tiramisu to be bad, no?) and a hazelnut torta I think it was.

The hostess was super friendly, the ambiance was nice-not stuffy. The outdoor patio looked super inviting and cozy. We opted to sit inside because it was windy and chilly. Our server (I wish I remembered her name) came straight over and took our drink orders. She was friendly and gave us several suggestions throughout our meal. I wanted to try both pizza and pasta, so My firiend and I ordered a pizza to share to start and each ordered our own pasta dish. We chose the Pig pizza-pepperoni, sausage and soppressata. It came out quickly and was hot and delicious! The crust was perfect and the sauce just right. The pepperoni had some heat to it. It was perfect. My friend even said that it was the best pizza he'd ever had. Next, we decided to order some calamari. It came on a bed of arugula with a lemony vinaigrette on top. It was perfectly cooked. Crispy on the outside and tender inside. Yum! We ordered our pasta (even though at this time we were getting stuffed!).  I ordered their specialty the Bolognese and my friend ordered the Strozzapretti pasta. They were both outstanding. We decided that we needed to try the dessert, so we both had a couple bites of our pastas and decided to box the leftovers. Our sweet waitress suggested the Budino for dessert (a salted caramel pudding like dessert). Wow! It was amazing. I was tempted to lick the jar but held back. Lol!

So friendly and informative, the whole wait staff was very attentive, drinks were constantly re-filled, food came out quick, dirty plates were promptly picked up, no complaints regarding service at all. 

We started out with a few appetizers cuz friends were hangry! Grilled artichoke was good, dipping sauce was bomb! Garlic and truffle bread...need I say more? Must try. Grilled cauliflower was average, I didn't think it was worth $12, it was very sour and didn't have much flavor other than that. 

Now the pastas...so so good! I got strozzapreti and even though my stomach was full my mouth wanted more! I never had pasta shaped like that also so it was a fun little surprise, the flavor was awesome, so cheesy but not overwhelming, great pasta dish! My friends got tortelloni and bolognese and both were delicious! 

For dessert we got cheesecake, tiramisu and donuts and oh my lord! All were very good but the tiramisu was my favorite! It was one of the best tiramisu i have had in a long time!

We ordered Italian meatballs, Chef's board, Crispy calamari, Arancini, Black Mediterranean mussels, Daily pizza (for the life of me I can't spell or remember the name but it had sausage, white sauce, broccolini, and garlic), Short rib radiatori, Roasted salmon, Italian farm salad, Squid ink mafaldine, and Strozzapreti. I highly recommend all of them. Just get them all! Haha. 

For dessert we got hazelnut torta, affogato, and chocolate gelato. Again, just get them all! You won't regret any of them. The hazelnut torta was topped with salted caramel gelato and a piece of hazelnut toffee. I want to know if they sell the toffee in bulk because that was the most delicious piece of toffee I ever had. 

Our server was TC (I hope I spelled it correctly). She was awesome! She reminds me of Bernadette from Big Bang Theory - sweet and knowledgeable...and she kinda looks like her too :)

My husband ordered the filet, and I ordered the short ribs on our first visit. We were both in heaven-- he says it's now his go-to steak in Vegas! (Also, pretty affordable for a filet at $38.) The flavors are great, the portions are perfect, and you really get your money's worth in my opinion on a normal day. I highly recommend the Arancini appetizer as well. Yum! 

The one time our experience was less than perfect was on Valentine's Day. They had a pre-fixe menu at $55 per person, offering an appetizer, a main (5 featured entrees from their normal menu) and a dessert. Not bad, especially for the area. However, I ordered scallops and risotto which seemed under cooked. Service was really slow, as well. They also ran out of the desserts so we settled for gelato. I didn't feel like this particular special event was worth it. 

Overall, on a normal day of service, I love North Italia but I don't think I would return for one of their pre-fixe events.

The food was good but nothing was spectacular. Their calamari was to bready but the addition of the arugula was nice. We also ordered the zucchini chips and truffle garlic bread which were both good as well. 

For my entree I tried the squid ink pasta which was tasty but not the flavor that I was looking for. It was Spicy which I like, but it overpowered any of the seafood flavor that I was looking for. My husband had the chicken parm which he liked. It came with Alfredo rigatoni which was a little different from the usual red sauce pasta that it usually comes with. The portions are bigger than Ithey look like in the pictures. Definitely enough to fill the belly. Oh and they have local beers on tap which I thought was a nice touch.

2340240,2018-04-12,1,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Mediocre restaurant. Sat down to a busy restaurant for a Wednesday night. The restaurant is staffed (perhaps overstaffed) with young people running around, but not doing too much. 

The hostess sat us right away, and was very nice. She even had a recommendation when asked about the food.  However, we sat there for 10 to 15 minutes while waiting for a glass of water or any server to even pay attention to us.

Server was nice enough, but poorly trained. Didn't know to get water right away. When the food came (pizza and arancini) I had to flag down a server (5 minutes of waving at workers - not exagerrating) just to get a plate. My wife wanted some bread with her pasta. I noticed that all the other tables had bread, so I asked my server how much a plate of bread cost. He responded it was free and asked if we wanted some. 

The food was decent, but nothing special. I ordered the eggplant pizza (special) and arancini.  Wife got seafood maladine (pasta). Pizza tasted okay, but all of tthe toppings came off every slice in the first small bite, which means I mostly ate crunchy bread with tomato sauce residue.  The arancini was awesome.  The arancini was awesome.  (I wrote this twice on purpose. Pay attention.)

Wife's pasta with squid ink was mostly tasteless.  I put my nose into the dish and couldn't even smell any seafood.  

We thought about dessert, but the entire meal felt like a failed first date, where nothing is really wrong, but it's not right either.  You just don't feel any chemistry. We decided to  quit while we weren't completely regretful. We left. 

In summary: Get the arancini appetizer!!! Then leave.",WRiS2BiHblDHN-9SQlR_BA,0,0,3,amNARsJuBdPUzG0lba_uXg

Between my visits, I've tried quite a few dishes. The bolognese blew me away, truly one of the best I've ever tasted. The salty crust on the salmon was very unique and flavorful. And the salted Carmel budino is my new favorite sweet snack! I'd also suggest ending your meal with an Italian coffee.

Unfortunately, a hair was found in the caesar halfway through lunch. The waitress apologized and offered a new caesar salad, which we declined. Then the manager/supervisor on-duty came to our table to apologize and again offer a new salad. Which we politely accepted the apology and declined the replacement salad. I suspect most people decline a replacement due to the feeling of nausea caused by finding a hair in the meal. Overall, there seems to be some kinks that need to be worked out.

We enjoyed the fresh, modern vibe and the outdoor covered patio looked like a fabulous place to dine when the weather cooperates. Indoors, they have open windows lining the back wall giving us the perfect view inside the kitchen at all of the bustling chef action. The service was very friendly from start to finish.

I wouldn't come here with high expectations for anything in particular. I also feel that the cuisine fits with New American/Italian fusion at best.

Their price point didn't match the way the plates were served; I was not thrilled with the presentation of the food. Value is hard to find here, especially when you have a lot of local, non-chain, Italian restaurants to choose from.

If I had to recommend something, try the arancini mushroom risotto balls and make sure to save room for the tiramisu, this spot adds clusters of crunch balls to the top which gives it an addictive texture.

This is not the case as North has already taken off on its own merit. The menu is not extremely extensive but is varied enough that I would order something different each time I return. We were a group of 9 so I did have the luxury of tasting many items. They were all very good, the pizzas, pasta, and salmon. The above sensational service provided to us by Gianna is what motivated me to write this. She made us feel as though we were the only table she was servicing. Whether it was a suggestion on what  and how to order for a group, to making certain our drinks were topped off, to making sure there were always enough appetizer plates for us. This was all done with a pleasant smile. She made a special occasion that much more joyous for us all. Thank you North and thank you Gianna!!!",aqMXE5thgg7v2JZOeikVqw,0,0,5,C1une7Y8r6gOLlBkm6wOVw

(I remember my first day) given we are easy so we gave em time after almost 20min for even ordering wine the server had no Italian wine knowledge and recomened a domestic wine I forgot what it was but for 80$ I would of rather has something exotic

2816055,2018-06-18,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Yay! We finally got to dine at North, I have been before in Denver, and remembered how delicious the food was. I love that we now have an option to dine somewhere new in town for Italian. North is very modern and in such an ideal location in Summerlin.

We arrived around 6:30 for dinner, we had a 25 minute wait, not too bad being that the restaurant was packed, on a Sunday, and it's Father's Day! All you have to do is leave  the hostess your name and number and they send you a text once your table is ready. So convenient! 

As far as the service, it was pretty good, I do think our waitress could of came around a bit more, but it was super busy. 

Now on to the food. 

We ordered:

Appetizers: Cesar salad , the truffle bread, and the meatballs. The salad was great, so were the meatballs! No complaints there! I do wish they came around with fresh cheese though, getting cheese took a bit. As far as the truffle bread, definitely not worth $11, it was just crunchy toasted bread, with a little ricotta and some truffle flavors. I let the waitress know and she kindly took it off the bill. 

Main: bolognese and a kids spaghetti and meatballs. 

The Bolognese was extremely bland compared to everything else that we ordered! Sadly it lacked so  much flavor! This is definitely  a dish that the chef and management should fix ASAP, because it's such a staple in Italian cuisine. I'm glad we ordered others items, because that dish is potentially something that would stop us from returning.

The spaghetti and meatballs were good, great portion size for a child, even for an adult!  I do think the sauce could use a little work flavor wise, but meatballs were great, as I stated above. 

My only complaint besides the issues with some of the dishes, is that all of our food came out at the same time! I don't even know how that happened!  We honestly didn't get to enjoy the appetizers first.  It was as if we ordered all of that for a main course, it was just too much at once. 

I would definitely return to North, the staff was friendly, attentive, and the environment was very kid  friendly, and the  menu is priced fairly reasonable. Our waitress also left us a complementary coupon for $10 off our next visit, kudos to her! I just hope you guys fix the bolognese!",j2rFqYXfK8dN-CxULh6aUg,0,0,3,G0J4cM11pq_IF_uoKUTR5Q

last Friday we went with No Reservation and Bummer we couldn't get a table :(
So this time first thing i did Book A Table.
booking 8pm. We were all excited. Parking was packed and from far away you could hear the noise from inside!!!
The restaurant was full from entrance, Covered and heated patio, bar area and restaurant.
the covered patio has a very nice fire place, love the decorative azuléjos that reminded me Portugal
the  restaurant is very modern, trendy. Even I loved the decor... if you like a quiet Romantic night ... North Italian is not the right place ... it's loud loud :(
We got our table quickly. I could barely hear the hostess, not sure if she even care LOL
Our waitress was polite but not very sharp on her service :(
It's pricy and I surely expect an excellent service what we did not received. Had to ask twice for water refill, we ordered couple appetizers and she missed to bring our bruschetta prosciutto. We enjoyed it at the same time as our meal.
We ordered a round of aperitif Champagne, Apricot Lemonatta (didn't taste the apricot) Sicilian margarita. Cocktails were great.
White truffle garlic bread (amazing made of fresh bread), Buratta excellent, refreshing, colorful just delicious and prosciutto bruschetta with grilled asparagus.
We ordered the Strozzapreti with pine nuts, spinach, mushroom and chicken. It was delightful but next time I will order it with no chicken or have them serve it on the side. The chicken killed the dish in my opinion. The bolognese with tagliatelle pasta, I tried and like the creamy bolognese not too tomato tomato. Perfect amount of ground beef d carrot. Buratta tortellini... mushroom is my péché mignon :) it was maybe 8 tortellinis in my bowl with some sliced mushrooms and couple leaves of spinach. The dish was okay.
The Bolognese was our favorite!
We finished our dinner with an expresso served like in Europe :) Ask for sugar before your waitress leaves because she might not come back lol
I think we were the last to leave and what a pleasant time we had when half of the restaurant left! 

expérience ... so so

If you like A good Italian, i recommend ROMA deli on Spring Mountain and Jones. It's not fancy but the gastronomy is closer to Italian Grand Ma cooking ... If you want fancy go To North Italia",XEH2VtVx5ZYATKEM4jZOXg,2,1,4,w0xKCbH_QeibRfXCBAeNEQ
2827481,2018-06-17,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"North has a lot going for it.  The food is fresh and interesting.  They are willing to customize ingredients and accommodate differing tastes.  We started with a Chef's Board which had a nice selection of nibbles.  The Calamari was tasty and crisp, but more of a beer batter than what you see in most Italian places.  The rice balls were crisp on the outside and pretty good inside, although they could of used a bit more flavor.  Pasta generally are decent sized and overall nice ingredients put together well.  Chick Parm was tender inside and crisp out.  It was served with a pasta with a white cheese sauce.  The cocktail list and wine list were more than adequate.

The problem is service.  Its just very raw.  Our bread came out without any plates.  We ordered drinks when we sat down.  They didn't come out till our starters were almost done, even though we ordered those well after the drinks. The staff was appologetic, but it still required us to raise this three times before they showed up. Our mains came out and even though we were at a table of four with room on each side the runner insisted on passing food over two of us instead of walking around the table.  Server, who was very nice, confused out credit card with another table so paying was delayed. Its not that I expect white glove service at a casual neighborhood place, but I do expect efficiency and basic understanding of things like how to serve food at the table.

Another server was super sweet and trying to help us out as well!

Food was delicious! We started with the meatballs, then shared family style the arancini, prosciutto bruschetta, and the strozzapreti (?). 

My only negative would be that service was a little slow. With that being said, a manager was great for coming around with refills, answering questions, and helping his staff. I am in the industry and understand how tough it can be when it's a crazy busy night, especially on a day that isn't usually very busy.

2967918,2018-03-05,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"I would love to give this place 5 stars but I will explain why I can't at the end of this review. I first tried this place in Austin, TX. I had never had fresh in house made pasta. It is truly life changing!!! Ok, well not life changing but definitely changed my ability to have pasta any other way. It even has convinced me to buy a fresh pasta maker and get my pasta making on! When I found out it was going to open locally in Las Vegas in December I made it a point to go the day after it opened, 12/13/17.  We went for a friends birthday. I made reservations and made sure to tell the hostess. When we entered the restaurant they asked who's birthday it was and said happy birthday to my friend. Figured we were good to go with some kind of dessert at the end. Dinner was fantastic. We were all impressed, even my friends father who said ""he is not a pasta fan"". My only reason for deducting a star is that the birthday somehow got lost in the transfer from hostess to server. She did not acknowledge it at all. Those little things mean something and are a huge miss when you make it a point to take someone out on their birthday, especially when you've raved about it. Maybe it was overlooked because I didn't bring in any obnoxious balloons or gift bags. It took me a few months to get time to write this review and in reading some reviews it seems the majority that aren't perfect are coming back more on staff and customer service than the food. It's sad because it really beats out places like Nora's that does not do fresh pasta but bad service will deter anyone even from the best food. Hope they get that together!

The ambiance was great and even though the room was big and it was noisy it wan't an unbearable level.  Service was also attentive.  I had the artichoke which was good but not the best I've had.   My husband had spaghetti and meatballs and he said the same thing.  Some other tables nearby had the Chef's Board which looked really delicious and I would try that next time.,tMmGMiagt8gBYSu5lmqeCw,0,0,3,I-NOaVJhg9nzlSRTdf8eXQ

I hope you're an honest patron, I am. I was almost able to leave without paying for my order. I specifically came in, despite living 5 min. from the restaurant, to ensure good service and quality.

I placed my order and was assured, ""bring it to you when it's ready"".

3023646,2018-03-13,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"I've been wanting to come here since they opened and was able to visit, twice, within 2 weeks. The first visit was for dinner with a group of 5 and the second visit was for Sunday brunch. It seems like no matter what time of day, North Italia is always packed.

I love the open seating area and how the bar area opens to the patio. Bathrooms are well lit and clean. Tons of seating on the patio with heaters. The host never wrote down our name but was able to remember who was next and sat us within a reasonable amount of time... although they could have given us a quote. The host just said we'll seat you soon. 

I wasn't offered bread my first visit but the second visit, the server did offer. It comes with butter and a side of olive oil and balsamic. What I did not like was that there weren't any plates given for us to eat the bread on. Not a big deal since we just dug right in. 

The common theme here seems to be a long wait for food.... no matter how big or small your group or what you order. The most recent visit, my bf and I ordered a short rib hash and short rib pasta. It took 40 minutes for the food to come out and our server apologized multiple times. When the food came out... it was very disappointing.

4/5 short rib hash ($14) if I can remember correctly, it had a few pieces of arugula, some red peppers, 3 pieces of short rib & was seasoned very well. A little on the spicy side. The bf thought it had some chorizo in it but it didn't. The grilled bread that came with the dish was burnt so I didn't try eating it but it looked good (minus being burnt). It had grated Parmesan on top. The short rib was super soft and complimented the mashed potatoes well. The hash wasn't like a traditional hash browns, the potatoes were probably boiled, mashed a bit and then fried. 

2/5: short rib pasta ($20)- my bf ordered this and we should have ordered an appetizer and a salad along with it. Not sure if they give out smaller portions during lunch vs dinner or what but it was comparable to a kids portion of pasta at other restaurants. He had 5 pieces of short rib in his pasta which I thought was a decent amount. It was garnished with arugula and shaved Parmesan. I wish our server had told us that the portion size of this dish is on the small side. Their pastas are made fresh daily so it's good! A bit chewy but not over cooked. And the sauce reminded me of an Alfredo sauce but not too creamy.

The first time I came here, my friend ordered the squid ink pasta. He's not allergic to tomatoes but had a strong dislike for it... he had one bite and decided to not eat it because it came with a tomato/wine sauce (per our server). We set it aside and our server did not offer to bring another menu or switch out his dish until after everyone was done eating! I however, did like the squid ink pasta. I love their pastas here even though serving size could be worked on. 

Another friend ordered their scallops and I thought the serving size was spot on, but it was too salty for the table to enjoy. 

North Italia is a good date spot, and has a really good happy hour. Pizza OR cheese board AND a bottle of wine for only $20?! Count me in for the happy hour but if I had to pay full price for their dishes... I think I'll pass.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,0,2,VjRUx8FIhUybmOpylFCwAA

I could not believe how many reviews this place had after only being opened a short while, and all very good reviews!  Well let me tell you it was either the fact that a break form stay at home motherhood would have made a McDonalds date night a 5 star experience, or this place truly is amazing, and deserves all of these rave reviews! :-)
It was quite busy for arriving at 4:30 and by the time we left at 6 there was already people waiting outside for a table.
We started with the truffle garlic bread. I thought, how can garlic bread be any different than from any other italian place?, but oh it oh it can be! This was wonderful! For my main meal I had the short rib pasta which was pretty much perfection, and my husband had the pig pizza and the chicken parm. which he said he really liked. I tried the pasta that came with the chicken and it was great!
For dessert we had the hazelnut tart. It was good, but the toffee pieces that came with it were heavenly... I would have preferred a bowl full of that! :-) 
The only tiny negative was I had ordered a decaf coffee that I wanted with my dessert. Our dessert came and halfway through they asked if I still wanted it since they were making it fresh, and at that point I did not want it anymore. Really no big deal at all.
The service was great, prices pretty decent, and you can tell the waiters really enjoy the food and sharing it with us.

For appetizers, it's hit and miss on whether the one you choose will be available. I've tried and failed twice to get the artichoke appetizer and I really want to try it.  We have tried the zuca chips, which are yummy but the portion is probably enough for 3-4 people. Also their truffle garlic bread is AH-MAZ-ING! You must try it at least once! My husband had some mussels or clams and enjoyed them. You can also get a basket of bread but it's never just brought out, you have to ask.

We both tried the spaghetti and it was delicious and I felt the like portion was perfect when having appetizers too.

For appetizers, we started with a chef's board, which was REALLY good. There was actually a lot of food, and after asking for some extra bread, we cleaned it up (family of 5, 3 teenage boys). We got an arugula and fennel salad, which was very good and had a nice lemon flavor. We also ordered the crispy calamari, which was the BEST calamari I've ever tried. Absolutely fantastic. We added on some mushroom tortellini, which was good and tasted very fresh. Definitely 5-star appetizers.

For entree, we ordered 1 bolognese, a fungi pizza, shortrib, strozzapreti, and a squid ink pasta. The bolognese was good- traditional and hearty. The squid ink pasta was not too good. It was weirdly spicy (but not excessively so) but really did not have much flavor. Don't get it. The strozzapreti was AWESOME- so flavorful and delicious. The shortrib was excellent. It was deliciously soft and flavored well with red wine, and the polenta it came with was sooooo good. Also got a fungi pizza, which was a lot. 5-Star entrees if you know what to order- just avoid the squid ink. Entrees are good sized- not like most good restaurants. They give medium-large portions.

4 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 3 desserts was a bit much, again for family of 5 which 3 teenage boys. 

For dessert, we ordered a tiramisu, affogato, and bordini. The tiramisu was good, but the bordini was AMAZING. Absolutely FABULOUS. Among the best desserts I've had and will ever have- like a salted caramel milkshake that's super creamy in a single AMAZING bite that's just so elevated. The affogato was ok. Solely the bordini was so good it was worth it.

Really solid new casual Italian restaurant in Summerlin.  Good happy hour, patio perfect for nice days or brunch, and solid wine by the glass list.  You can even get a few more ounces at a discounted price for most pours.  Although the beer list could use some help as there's only about a dozen total bottle/draft.

Menu is new Italian with tons of small plates and appetizers, pizzas for $14, and pastas around $20.  Everything seems sharable from the portion size to the tapas pricing.

The fig pizza, with some added prosciutto, was fantastic.  Tons of meat and thicker crust than your typical craft pizza.  Prosciutto is super thin and perfect compliment to the crust.  The cauliflower appetizer was fine with a few asparagus and an egg, but nothing more than a small opener to a delicious pizza entree.

Of wines, a special offer on Sunday afternoons. We ordered the roasted cauliflower, meatballs, margarita pizza and a kids pepperoni pizza. Everything was tasty and service was good.

Did not disappoint.. one of the new restaurants in our neighborhood... ..great ambiance.. bit busy on a Thursday.. so service  slightly slow. ..nonetheless  it was great experience.  Great food.. pasta freshly made. You can see behind the counter how it's  made. squind ink malfadine was too die for.. . Strozzapetti was delish too.  For app we had arancini and calamari.  Different take on calamari seems like it has balsamic reduction but it was lemon vinaigrette  which is good. Arancini .. gotta say had better.. lack mozzarella.. one I'm  used to
My friends had pizzas.. they were good too..burrata appetizer was awesome! 
For dessert.. the tart and hazelnut torta are my fave.  Tiramisu is different  but good. Bombolini with lemon sauce.. i dont care for..but that's  just me .. too tart... will come back and try their other dishes",RPSRYr6kCvXy2bL-I8y2mw,0,0,5,zIaLu2wFqmVtkExNWebMnw

3673989,2018-05-27,1,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"LOVE this place! I'm so excited to write this review because I'm so happy there is an amazing hip Italian place in Vegas. We came last night around 6 for dinner, and it was super lively inside. They have a beautiful outdoor patio seating that takes up nearly half the restaurant, and the whole restaurant itself is open air. I would describe this place as elegant and rustic. 

We got the Garlic Truffle Bread w/Ricotta Appetizer and omg this was so good. The bread is well coated in olive oil, retained the crunchiness and softness of the french loaf, and was bursting in flavor. The homemade ricotta cheese with it was a really nice touch and added a coolness to the bread. 

For our main course, we got the Squid Ink Madaldine. I honestly wasn't wowed by this dish for the fact that the pasta itself was too al dente for my liking and the pasta flavor was overpowered by the mint leaves. The spicy tomato sauce itself was really delicious, but I think it needed more of it. 

We also got the Funghi Pizza, and WOW this pizza is legitimately so delicious I kept commenting throughout dinner how yummy this pizza was. The crust is really nice, but the star of the dish were the perfectly cooked roasted mushrooms in the olive oil and mozzarella. It really tasted as though truffle oil was used, and I'm a huge truffle fan. So pretty much, you need to get this pizza. 

For Dessert, we got the Tiramisu. It was so fresh and yummy, and actually comes in a pretty large portion (enough for 2). I really liked the crunchiness of the chocolate balls on top, adding some nice texture. 

The service here was also top notch. I was greeted by the GM and checked on multiple times throughout dinner. I'm in love with North Italia.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,2,2,5,M7TDFFDBpEYNJibW5lnWeQ

I ordered the Julietta, which was a sweet and refreshing martini. My friend ordered the cucumber martini. The presentation on both were nice and they were crafted very well. 

We ordered the following appetizers:

Roasted cauliflower-served in a hot skillet. Was crispy and had really good flavor. The fried egg was a nice compliment to the roasted veggies. 

Meatballs-served in a hot skillet with a side of garlic bread. Good flavor and a good table share plate. 

Caesar salad-fresh and flavorful 

White truffle garlic bread-good plate to share for the table. One of our favorites. Crispy and soft bread topped with fresh ricotta cheese. 

We each ordered an entree and they were all really good. Nice size portions and good flavor. We had some leftovers. 

Chicken Parmesan-crispy and flavorful. Served with a side of pasta with cream sauce. 

Chicken pesto pasta-another favorite. Pasta tossed with pesto sauce and topped with grilled chicken and pine nuts. Really tasty. 

Squid ink pasta-flavorful and had a bit of a spicy kick 

Short rib pasta-sliced short rib on cream pasta served with arugula. Short rib was tasty and tender. 

Scallops-served medium which was perfect. Really good flavor and texture.

We made a reservation and were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  The hostess was very nice and gave us a couple recommendations as we were being seated.  The place is a little loud but nothing new for Vegas restaurants and the decor is pretty cool.  We ordered our appetizer and drinks first and took a little time deciding on the main course.  After we ordered our main course it seemed like everything went into warp speed.  Our appetizer came out about 30 seconds before our main courses which we did not appreciate.  Our waitress would disappear for long stretches at a time.  I was never asked if I wanted another beer or if my wife wanted another drink and our waters were refilled once at the at the beginning of the meal and they went empty after that.  The next time the waitress came by she started picking up plates that still had food on them that we were still eating and we had to tell her to stop and put them back.  Talk about feeling rushed to get us out of there on a night where we just wanted to relax and enjoy a little family time.  The unfortunate thing is that we did enjoy the food, I had spaghetti and meatballs, the wife had pesto pasta and my daughter had a kids pizza, but the poor service and the feeling of being rushed put a damper on the night.  Its pretty bad when you feel like the server could care less about your dining experience at their restaurant and just wanted to turn the table.  As I said earlier we did like the food but it will be a while before we go back again if we do, too many other places to go with much much better service and dining experience.

3952053,2018-07-02,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Food = Delicious! Primary reason for my 4-stars. 
Service = hit or miss depending on how busy they are (I would give service a 3-star) 
Price = reasonable with larger portions and the quality is great 
Happy hour? = Excellent! You get a steal with this place and it's offered Monday thru Thursday from 3-6 pm 

Highly recommend reservations especially on weekends and Friday's. I use OpenTable to get the points! 

There are indoor and outdoor seating. Each time I come here, it's at night so I prefer to sit outside on the patio because inside it's too loud. The bar has a great selection of wines, beers, and well drinks. 

I will definitely come back here again. However, I won't be back when it's busy because the service becomes sub-par when they are too busy. 

My favorite things to order are: 

The garlic bread: crispy bread loaded with garlic and cheese! Nom nom nom 
Short rib pasta: huge portion so it's a great dish to share 
Any of the pizzas: North Italia knows how to make amazing, fluffy dough topped with quality ingredients for all their pizza's. Comes with about 8 slices so it's a great dish to share as well. 
Tiramisu: YUMMM. Comes with little chocolate wafer balls so you get a nice crunch.

3959379,2018-03-02,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Overall, solid Italian restaurant. I spent about 3 years overseas in Italia (North Italia, north of Venice) so I first opted for the Friulano wine--pleasantly good wine. The selection of wine was awesome too and most were from Italia.

We then got the Chef's board, and it was amazing; this was about as traditional Italia as you can get. For dinner, I got the grilled Branzino and my wife got ""the Pig"" pizza. Overall, my fish was 4/5.. the setup was good but the fish was charred just a tad too long that left a slight burnt taste which impacted overall flavor and left it dry. For the price, I would've definitely got something else next time--My wife's pizza was supremely amazing--again, comparable to what you'd actually get in Italia. 

Finally, my only real critique was that our waitress was not present most of the night for us; either she was assigned too many tables or was inefficient/new at handling the workload. Delayed refills and getting our food out in a timely manner. 

Overall though, nothing major and I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try a new and authentic Italian restaurant.",AmMZnfVaYtfLDz9uXJqq2A,0,0,4,DupHMn7Kg37vRevgozFbcw

4007002,2018-04-19,1,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"To say I was disappointed with my meal and service quality at North Italia is a vast understatement. This past Saturday a friend and myself decided to call in an order and take it to go since her husband was still at home and it's about 30-35 minutes away, we just happened to be over that way. 

We order on the phone and they repeat it back to me and everything sounds great, they say it'll be 25 minutes and we head over to pick it up. Once we get there they confirm our order again and give us the receipt to sign and all seems good. We ordered two different pasta dishes, the scallops, and the bread appetizer. We leave and get back to the house, again, 30-35 minutes away and the appetizer and two pastas are on top with the scallops on the bottom. Everyone's food looks ok, then I get to the scallops. I asked for no butternut squash and to sub for asparagus, which the receipt said again that it was subbed. Upon opening the container, the risotto part of the dish was missing entirely from our order, so right there half the meal is missing. They still put the butternut squash in as well, and the Brussels sprouts weren't actually Brussels sprouts, just the ends that when cooking you usually discard because they're too fibrous to chew through (I included a picture of the Brussels sprout ends, which were the only thing included). 

So, basically I got to pay for a full entree to only get 3 scallops and a few asparagus and nothing else to eat. I called them to see if they could potentially put me on a list or something to have the entree remade at a later time, because again, I'm 30+ minutes away and driving back would be ridiculous. I didn't want a refund and I wouldn't even have written this review if something like that was done but they just apologized and asked if I could drive back to get the missing component of my meal. 

Based on their reviews and people saying everything was good I was excited to try this place and upset that my experience wasn't the same. Just prepare to be disappointed if you order to go. 

**UPDATE: The manager messaged me wanting to make it right and I tried to reply but the email he gave me wasn't valid and he never replied to my message so I guess my review stands since I won't be giving it a second chance due to the flaky communication",4M25m7sE45Q_hNOch4b8fA,1,0,1,dIR4-sLQWaKxo_xlK89eKw

Then we were seated at a table and we proceeded to order a glass of wine. The glass of wine had a object in the glass which looked like a critter but we were told it was sediment. We're also asked if that made us uncomfortable that they would give us another glass instead. Then the calamari came that we ordered and it was smothered in a bed of arugula salad to hide the fact that there were only a few pieces of calamari . We ordered a Caesar salad since we were told this place is like a French restaurant which uses only the freshest ingredients in their salad dressings and their fresh pasta (repeated each time a new customer arrived #annoying) when the salad arrived  we had just started eating it when our pastas was delivered. No one seemed to care as the wait staff seemed to be very unorganized and ill trained. As we started to eat the pasta we realized that both of our dishes which were separate dishes I order the squid ink pasta which came with the smallest over cooked shrimp (reallly) and my husband ordered the chicken pasta dish with the cream sauce. Both dishes had a Marie Callender feel to it nothing felt homemade and there was absolutely no flavor to it!!! Remember when you go to this restaurant that there is no bread served at the table and there is absolutely no ambience to the place. I had not touched my pasta dish but I was asked if I needed a box. They immediately sent over a small McDonald's burger Styrofoam boxes and we were to put our own leftovers in our boxes and walk away sans a bag. Having lived in Vegas for over 25 years this is probably the worst place we've ever been to. If you want some really good authentic Italian food go to Marks Tratoria which is not a food chain it is a local place with real fresh pasta and no one ever says is like a French restaurant.

Service: We sat at the bar on the side that's outside the indoor dining area.  The weather covers were down because of the recent rain and the outdoor heaters were on to keep it cozy.  Our bartender/server was fantastic! I wish I would have gotten his name.  Food came out promptly out of the kitchen during a very busy happy hour.  We ordered more food after happy hour, during the dinner rush and the service didn't falter.  

Happy Hour Menu: The Chef's Board had Meat, cheese, veggies, bread, nuts, etc was pretty to look at and very tasty.  The Margherita pizza had a thick crust on the edge and the cheese was great.  Sangria was mixed proportionately well of wine and juice, I would drink again, and again.

Menu Menu: The Braised Meatballs order came out with 6 and loaded with red sauce, good times.  The mushroom risotto and scarmoza cheese in the Arancini balls was great.  Deep fried perfectly and the red sauce complimented it well.  The Spaghetti and meatballs pasta was well made and this classic dish is an easy ""go to"" here.  The high quality ingredients and the preparation were key to the tasty dishes I tried at North Italia.

Ambiance:  Wooden ceilings and floors, white walls adorned with some simple decorations, and contemporary bulb lighting make for a clean minimalist dining area inside.  Outside, there's a boardwalk mural and plenty of seating when the weather is nice.  The attractive rectangular bar serves both the inside and outside area of the restaurant and is stocked with premium liquor.

I believe North Italia has been opened for just a month now? I am pretty impressed with how well they're operating in such a short period of time especially during that dinner rush I saw.  I'm going to suggest reservations would be the smart thing to do here. The menu is extensive with so many dishes to try and is now a go to restaurant for me when I'm feeling Italian.  I'm looking forward to their brunch and another dinner experience in the near future.  But that's another yelp tale...enjoy! =)",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,4,4,5,Gc-MfHZxOiQW42x8w26sJQ

We were greeted warmly and seated at a beautiful walnut table.  Very quickly our drink order was taken and we had regular tea which was very tasty (like the best part of the meal in my opinion).


We also opted for an appetizer of a grilled artichoke for $13 - which was 3 half artichokes grilled.  Tasty, but nothing you wouldn't get down at the claim jumper across the street for much less.  They also brought out bread which was cold out of the fridge with some butter.

For dinner, I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  The meatballs were pretty good but the pasta sauce is among the least spectacular I have had in a long time.  I don't want to say this, but the dish actually reminded me of Chef Boyardee spaghetti.  I feel kind of guilty for writing that, but unfortunately, it's true.

Having said that, my wife had Burrata Tortelloni and it was good for her - she liked the spicy sauce.

Finally, the portions were very small for the price.

2 Teas - Great
1 App - Good but not wow'd
2 Pasta Entree's - One not good, One Good (so, mediocre)

In the crowded west side food scene, North Italia is making waves from the beginning.

The food is great, nice selection of salads, flatbreads, pastas and mains. I'm more than happy with all my selections. Tonight I pigged out, simple salad, pasta bolognese, chicken parm, also tried farm salad and chicken noodle soup. All delicious.

Ambiance was bustling. Nice indoor/outdoor thing going with bar in between. Not a sports bar vibe but was able to catch some March Madness and Hockey by reserving a high top near bar. Go Knights.

The service was friendly but not really attentive. They forgot to replace my silverware after taking it on my second and third courses. I waited 5-6 minutes for a fork with nobody around.

Still a good value and do appreciate the server recommending the third cheapest cab which was a great value. Nice touch. Decent wine list.

We ordered the calamari - and it came tossed with arugula. I don't think we read it in the menu, but maybe I didn't pay attention to it. My son ordered it, and they staff were kind enough to remake it without the arugula. We should have just canceled it. Without the marinara sauce or some sauce, it's just that - deep friend breaded squid. We wouldn't order this again.

I had the veggie salad and the grilled branzino. The branzino was $27 and it was good, but not $27 good. I'd get it again but not at that price. I think I'd go to Nora's and get a whole one instead. 

The veggie salad - I read it had faro, but it seems it also had quinoa. It was mushy with the avocado and the grains. The only vegetable besides the lettuce was small pieces of cauliflower. I definitely would not order this again. I don't know... maybe we ordered all the wrong things. 

We ate it, but we left going, what's the hype?
On the people side, they were super friendly attentive. I think if you're in the area, and you want to have a relaxing meal in a nice setting, and you want to try something other than Claim Jumper, PF Changs, and Chili's, this is a nicer atmosphere with a feel of more stylized food.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,0,0,3,XBjykc88q-5mKqx77FAUbA

We were seated outside but with the heaters the temperature was terrific. The atmosphere of this place is great. You could come here for a casual dinner, an after work drink, or on a date. 

But. We waited an extraordinary amount of time for a pretty basic meal on a night that wasn't exceptionally busy. The manager was very polite, came over and apologized and offered us another appetizer. We were enjoying ourselves and declined as the food was expected shortly. When the food came it looked great. However. My salmon was undercooked. The center could have been served as sushi. Again the waiter and then manager were both apologetic and offered a replacement meal, etc but at this point I am put off for the evening and will eat when we get home. 

When the bill came, all they had done was remove the meal I didn't eat. After the wait and the inconvenience this is grossly unacceptable.

4238342,2017-12-18,1,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"We went on opening weekend (waitress said it was their first weekend to be fully open). I've been to many restaurants on opening week/weekend and so much was lacking here and I was so excited to try this place. 

We got there and had reservations and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very sweet and helpful so no complaints there. We ordered an appetizer that came out very quickly and tasted great (garlic should have been in much smaller pieces). It then took another 45 minutes to get our food. Our kids were unmanageable by the time our food got to the table and by that point it was hard to enjoy much.

We were brought bread about 30 minutes into the wait because the food was taking so much longer than anticipated. The food was mediocre. The potato and spinach daily special pizza was WAY too spicy and had barely any potatoes. The fig and goat cheese pizza with prosciutto was good, but way too many figs and not enough goat cheese, leaving the pizza just way too sweet. Super chewy and doughy spots on the pizzas, leaving other spots charred and too crispy to eat. 

I can completely understand opening weekend can be rough, but we weren't even offered a gesture of kindness for having to sit and wait forever and it even took the same 45 minutes to bring the kid's food out. Just unacceptable to me for a restaurant that's not necessarily cheap. Most places would offer an appetizer comp or maybe a dessert comp even for the wait and frustration, but nothing. 

I think we might go back and try it again, but it would have been nice to see management walking around to tables having to wait for extended amounts of time explaining the slow food situation etc. If we go again, it'll be sans kids just in case the wait is always this bad for food.

Long story not so short, the food is probably normally much better when things aren't so fast and furious in the kitchen and the waitress was very nice, but was just really hoping for a better experience.",AKe0YPPVeUT2DL6zcQ7ffw,5,1,2,eGjX6gwgLTt4Otc6sMgQQg

The first time was the week they opened (Dec 2017) and the service was very slow, but my friend & I decided to give it a second chance in hopes that the slow service back then was due to how new they were.  Well, lets just say the service is still slow (entrees were served 1 hour after we were seated) and our server lacked basic customer service.  

He was very friendly; however, I ordered the potato, sausage & kale soup as an appetizer (their featured item he told me about), but he brought me tomato soup. While he had the soup in front of me, he explains that the featured items he mentioned were incorrect.  I felt that I was not given a choice to decline the soup (I was really looking forward to the soup I ordered) as he had it in front of me while telling me what happened (keep in mind we were still charged for his mistake).  The food was okay.  Nothing to really rave about.  Usually, a spoon would be served with spaghetti and meatballs; however, we only had forks & knives.  When our server bought us the bill, he placed it right in front of me assuming that I was paying.  I know this review is mainly about an individual's customer service; however, this is when management needs to train better on proper dining etiquette when hiring young servers.

Below was a review from a dining experience at NoRTH Italia.  They really do care about these reviews because the GM Cole contacted me via email and we spoke personally.  He listened to my concerns and said, ""Your feedback is how we improve.  We need this!  I'm so sorry it happened and we'd like to show you how we really treat our guests!"" 

Cole invited us back and we had an GREAT EXPERIENCE!  The service and food were totally on point!  The scallops were done to perfection! Every person staff person was terrific.  They made the birthday celebration a special evening from beginning to end.   Their attention to detail and professionalism was evident ~ flowed smoothly on a very busy Saturday night.  

Cole and his team totally turned a bad situation around. So many other businesses may not bother acknowledging a poor review. At NoRTH Italia, they welcomed the opportunity to fix a problem(s) and create a long term customer.  Although they are new in town, they certainly understand HOW customer service is done. CONGRATULATIONS and THANK YOU!!

Looking forward to our next NoRTH Italia dining experience!

Horrible Experience

We've been here several times and the service is inconsistent to say the least.   Today, was way beyond inconsistent!   They had seated two huge parties one of 35 and the other of 20. They offered to seat us outside on the patio with a heater that took about 15 minutes to light.  Our server never showed up while other tables around us were being waited on.  After going to the host, one showed up and she was very nice and did her best.  We had our food checked on - it didn't show up either.  Other parties seated long after us were eating.  Finally, my french toast arrived along with our other meals.  Mine was awful ~ barely grilled on one side. 
 
The manager did come over to our table (once because the server told him, another time because we flagged him down).  Their response both times was ""let me check with the kitchen and see what's going on.""  Even after he saw my uncooked meal, his concern was bringing it back to the kitchen so ""they could see it.""  How about asking if you could make me something else? 

NOTE TO NORTH ITALIA STAFF:  GUESTS ARE HERE TO ENJOY A MEAL AND HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE.  WE ARE NOT HERE TO WORK OUT YOUR OPERATIONAL ISSUES!

Things can and do happened.  As long time residents of LV we've had our share of good and bad restaurants.  It's ALL about how you recover and fix the experience.  In my opinion, and that of another tables seated near us having similar issues today, this place has a couple of issues: 1) The front-end staff (host, managers) are young and inexperienced for this type of an establishment.  They're trying to give off an upbeat, hip vibe which is great.  HOWEVER, that needs to be done with an experienced, professional staff.   As another guest table said, ""they need more grey hair running this place; They're kids.""  2)  Again, from an experience standpoint, who would book two large parties at the same time, without adding staff?  This place isn't that big!  People can have large parties, 
but how about staggering the timing?  How about adding staff? How about a private room like other restaurants in town?  The situation today sacrificed a ton of customer service due to poor planning on their part.  We get that you are new and want the exposure and business.  Our experience today (and another during the holidays)  clearly speaks to North Italia needing work in several areas.  They may be busy now, but if this continues, their guest won't continue putting up with inconsistent and bad experiences. Their are simply too many other choices in town.",hJEScx2C_WahdIg-pAzQFw,0,0,5,Kpxut_oxkuCaPLX6qh4aRA

I was a little nervous walking up to this place. We were starving. It was jam packed. And, I was sure we would have a crazy long wait. I was wrong. We were greeted and seated right away.

The restaurant was clean & bright with a bit of that industrial feel. Our server, Tyler, came over right away and took our drink order. We weren't given any kind or bread or anything. I don't know if it was a fluke or if this is something they just don't do. Our drinks took a bit of time to arrive. Not long enough that we were getting upset, but long enough to notice it. I felt like this wasn't because the service was lacking, but more a result of how busy they were.

We had planned to order pizza, but other menu items had us at hello so we opted for 2 entrées. My husband ordered the Bolognese ($18) and subbed  Rigatoni. I opted for the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs ($26). Both were excellent! The Short ribs we flavorful & tender. Served with Marscarpone Polenta, Swiss Chard, Carrots, & Fingerling Potatoes. The accompaniments were as delicious as the ribs themselves. I'm not a huge polenta fan, but this dish made me want to lick my plate!

For dessert, we had the Bombolini ($7) which are served with a vanilla anglais & lemon curd.  Again, not a dish I would normally gravitate to, but it was calling to me and I'm glad it did. These little donuts were light and lovely. The perfect happy ending to our meal.

I'm already planning my next visit to North Italia! I am excited to try some of their pizzas, especially the Prosciutto w/ fig & goat cheese and the Bacon & Egg w/ roasted potato, garlic confit, & rosemary. I'm, also, looking forward to the Zucca Chips & the Arancini.

North Italia has a great vibe. The food is excellent & service is laid back and friendly. They are in a great location, and clearly the word is out! My biggest complaint about this place is that it is WAY across town for me so I can't go nearly as often as I would like.",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,4,3,5,JytMIS8zJsgQzSHBksRuGg

I ordered their breakfast wrap and my girls and I shared a pitcher of their red sangria. The breakfast wrap was so good! I literally inhaled it the moment I took my first bite of it. It had Italian sausage, mushrooms, smoked mozzarella, scrambled eggs, and roasted pepper. It came with this cream sauce on the side. I'm not entirely sure what it was but it complemented the wrap really well. It was so nicely made, it wasn't messy or greasy, and it was filling. The perfect amount of flavor and I was impressed that their was a good amount of sausage and mushrooms. Other breakfast wraps or burritos I've had in the past consisted mostly of scrambled eggs and not much of anything else. So this had a good ratio of everything. The sangria was nice and refreshing and between 4 girls, we were able to have 2 glasses each out of the pitcher. The pitcher is $28 which I feel is a deal instead of each girl getting bottomless mimosas.

It's located right across the street from Boca Park near Honey Salt.

For food we started with the Arancini. They were perfectly crispy on the outside and stuffed with goodness. The sauce is really what made this one a winner though, super rich and delicious taste. (4/5) As an entree I had the vegetarian friendly Burrata Tortellini. The broth, omg, SO good! I ate every single piece of this dish and loved all of it. (5/5) My boo had the chicken parmesan which he said was phenomenal. I was able to try some of his pasta on the side which was super tasty. I would get the penne just on its own as an entree if I could. We then topped the meal off with some tiramisu (5/5). I loved the crunchy bites on the top and the flavors were very good.

First let me say that I called a few days (3) ahead to make reservations. I told them between 15-20 people and they refused to give us a reservation unless we could come after 3pm. Seriously? That doesn't work since we meet at 1pm each week at a new restaurant to review the food. I even offered to split up into 3-4 tables for their convenience. No go said the restaurant. OK. So decided to chance it at the door. So we all came and finally they said we could eat on the patio with the heaters turned on. That worked except it was 50 mile an hour winds and about 49 degrees that day. 
The food was OK. I got ill on my portion of spaghetti and meatballs and the calamari was not good. Not sure if they spit in my food or not.

The place has been open 6 weeks and the newbee local customers pack the place.  Will North Italia sustain a customer base?  Doubtful.

I was in the mood for a cocktail and tried two from their craft menu that were recommended by our server. Both were a little more complex, and sweeter than I usually like, I'm kind of a purist. Next time I'll probably stick with what I know.  

We started with the grilled artichoke and garlic bread. I do love a good artichoke, and this one surely was. The aioli was not the best I'd ever had, could have used maybe some dill, or other herb. The garlic bread was otherworldly, and you damn well better love garlic because it is seriously loaded with it. The bread was light as air and the ricotta was amazing.

4786279,2018-04-12,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"Not coming back.  Food was 3 stars and there was no service.

We were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess.

At first glance, the decor was simple, open, and soft lighting seems inviting and welcoming, but it stops there.

Don't get me wrong, there are a ton of staff and no one was particularly idle.  The failure on the service comes from a lack of training and perhaps the way the teams were structured.

From the time we were sat with a menu, it took 11mins for the server to come by and identify himself, as he was already walking away with his head turned to say ""I'll be right with you okkkkaayyy?""  Another 4 minutes go by, he comes back to ask us if we wanted to order drinks, still no water in hand or on the table.  We asked for water and was about to order when he turned to leave so we actually had to stop him from running away to get the orders in and to not course it.

Now there are tables being set all around us that are assigned to various servers and our server got additional table at this point.  Everyone else did not seem to have to wait long to be greeted, get drinks, or have their orders taken.  We know this because the table that got sat 20mins after us in his section got their drinks and food first.  Not only that, our server never brought us bread until when my entree arrived and my husband asked if we needed to place an order for a bread basket.  You read that right.  My lone plate of pasta arrived first, ahead of the complimentary bread and our other plates, which were the arancini and a pizza.  When one requests to not course a meal, it is assumed to be brought out together, not one at a time.  By the time my husband's pizza and arancini arrived, my pasta dish was lukewarm.  Our bread with the olive oil and vinegar arrived last.  Server dropped it off and ran off without giving us bread plates.  We had to flag down someone else to get it.

Our water were never refilled.  We were almost through the meal when the server came by to ask ""how are things going?"" rather than when the food was delivered to see if we required condiments or if the food were to our liking.  I guess it's impossible when plates were spaced so far apart so that it was like we were eating separate meals.

About the food and flavors:
- Arancini was delicious and comes in 3's on a cast iron plate, except the dish was not even hot when we got it.  It was filled with once melted but now has resolidified cheese
- special of the day eggplant pizza was overly salty and the skin of the eggplant made it so when you took a bite, the entire topping came off with it and was messy to eat by hand.  You should fork and knife every bite
- Squid Ink mafaldine was tomato and basil forward with a lot of heat to the spice.  While it's a unique dish, it was not great tasting and the portion was small for $20. The sauce to pasta ratio was good, but the amount of seafood was meager.  The 4 small shrimps and squid strips were not cooked in the sauce so it came out very bland

While I was still eating, the server started cleaning up my plate while I was mid bite to ask if we wanted dessert.  My husband had to stop the server and ask him to put the plate down because I was still eating.  My meal would have been no different if we ordered at a self serving kiosk and got our own water, utensils, and napkin with a number on an extension stand.  It was a ridiculous experience and a waste of time and money!  For the many Italian and Italian American options available in Summerlin (e.g. Trattoria Reggiano, Honey Salt, Masso Osteria, Spedini), I'm going to tell everyone to pass on North Italia.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,3,0,2,ZCh4rgfMwbj-SLAQ5aNhag

Our family has become somewhat of pizza snobs over the last few years taking trips to Italy and NYC. So getting run of the mill pizza really isn't our thing anymore...with that being said we were all so glad we came across this place. The atmosphere is top notch and the food is the same. The thin crust pizza done in super hot ovens is on point and when it comes out it is still bubbling...careful you can burn your mouth. Not sure about some of the other not so positive reviews, but I would look right over those and see this place for what it is....

We ended up sharing a few dishes among friends and family... we shared the prosciutto and fig pizza, spicy salami and arugula pizza, bacon and egg pizza, margherita pizza, meatballs, crispy zucchini slices and calamari. Everything was spectacular and despite all the choices my favorite was and always be a really good margherita pizza. I know simple and plain but this pie was amazing. Everyone loved the  items and it was great sharing.

This restaurant fares more on the trendy side, with split seating outdoors and indoors serving craft beers and specialty cocktails along with fresh made in-house pastas and quality ingredients.

Pros: DELICIOUS food-communally shared white truffle garlic bread, and I got the burrata tortelloni; our waitress was very friendly and talkative.

Cons: Service was frustratingly slow; portion size is very small; price is expensive ($17 for my 8 pieces of pasta, $10 for the 4 pieces of bread).",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,3,1,4,r2U3FsvoAcsuuBFIOVzJuQ

""Reunited & It Feels So Good....""

I fell in love with this modern, family oriented, indoor out door Italian restaurant when my favorite unfiltered dame introduced me to North in Scottsdale. 

The vibe is welcoming and the fresh made daily  pasta & pizza dough is delicious!

Our overall service was pretty consistent considering their recent grand opening!

FOOD
Crisp Calamari $13 Highly recommended golden brown calamari paired with arugula and lemon of course. Great portion size for the price.
Tortellini $17 This vegetarian friendly main dish was smaller than I anticipated but filling. 
Daily Pizza (Potato Spinach) $14 SURPRISINGLY SPICY and our server failed to mention it before ordering. Thankfully I'm about that spice life! My first potato pizza and I enjoyed it. 
Dirty Almond Chai $5.00 This latte was refreshing & filthy at the same time and I enjoyed every sip!

Dessert was on the House compliments of management but I honestly would have paid double for the Tiramisu & Buddino.

The ambiance is awesome with a farmhouse feel to it: bronze salt & pepper shakers, wood top tables, comfy cushy chairs, even the uniforms are a farm feel but it works!

I immediately asked the server for vegan options and even though they don't offer a separate menu for those items, he was able to point out my options with making some adjustments to them. For my meal I had the 

Tuscan Kale Salad (remove the cheese and parmesan vinaigrette dressing) and he replaced it with another dressing and it came with grapes and apples. It was awesome!! 

Special of the day Vegetable pizza (hold the cheese) came with broccolini, crispy eggplant, mushrooms, roasted red peppers on a gluten free crust and it was AMAZING!! It was a decent portion, 6 good size slices and I ate every single one loving every bite 

The bf ordered the tomato soup of the day and the scallops. He loved every moment and our meal was complimented by a glass of the Riesling, pinot grigio and a makers old fashion.

The service there was awesome from being greeted at the door to our server and food runners. Everyone was so friendly and if something wasn't right, they would do their best to accompany the request. Nick was our server and even though was very busy, never left us hanging for service. 

Definitely check out this place and also in the same shopping center they're opening up a sister location called the Flower Child which looks to be a farm to table concept. Can't wait!",9UfZhqfDptllFTKgHAhMYQ,2,2,5,7q7KFdo20jktiG_l-SkMTQ

The decor is super sleek and cute inside. We were seated shortly after ordering drinks at the bar. Service was pretty good. Since I think this is a new location, they are still training staff. 

Our party of 8 almost ordered most of the menu. For appetizers we got the arancini balls and calamari. I liked that the calamari came with arugula because it made it lighter but that dish was a miss for the table. They were expecting just calamari and more of it. The calamari was crispy but it didn't come with any dipping sauces. My friends said the arancini balls were just ok. 

I ordered the funghi pizza. I love mushrooms and this pizza was very very good. It had great flavor and they were pretty generous with the mushrooms. The only complaints were that the crust is too big and thick, and the pizza was on the greasy side. 

I also got to try some of the chicken pesto. It's very flavorful. The short rib pasta was good but the meat was a little stringy. I did enjoy the Parmesan cream sauce though.  The diver scallops came on a bed of risotto with butternut squash. The scallops were very juicy and big. It could have had a crispier sear to it. The risotto was good but overall the dish is on the sweet side.

The party was only 5 on the reservation so it wasn't like they were confirming a massive party. Next, we ordered a bottle of wine and the waitress spilled it on my mom. Not only did my mom have to ask for napkins after she was spilled on, the waitress didn't comp the bottle or at the very least didn't get us a new bottle when she was the one who spilled it. Next, she brought us the wine but the other two people who ordered beers didn't get their beers for 40 minutes, until the food came. Very strange and poor service.

I was with a party of 14 and the service was a little lacking, we really should have had two waiters instead of one. The food and drinks came at different rates making some of us  wonder if our orders were forgotten. I had to remind the server twice about my wine. I guess they don't do bread service? Strange for an Italian restaurant, especially a busy one, where people have a long wait even with reservations. Dessert wasn't offered or mentioned before the checks were arrived, perhaps they were in a hurry to turn the table. And one last thing, they pour wine from little wine carafes into your wine glass which is inefficient for their volume and yet they don't offer freshly grated Parmesan for your pasta at the table. If asked, they will drop off two plastic cups; one of granulated Parmesan and one of dried chili flakes like a common pizza joint. I'm not sure they have their priorities straight and it seems incongruous to their prices and semi high-end menu offerings. All of us at the table were a little surprised by that. But this is a chain restaurant so many things won't really be authentic anyway, I suppose.

Their star specialty, the bolognese pasta was very good. The fresh pasta makes a difference. Everything else I tasted was a little on the salty and oily side.

And don't forget to take a peak at the main menu because you'll find items for anyone's  taste, & prices to match. 

It seems that manager Cole appreciates not only the bottom line ($$) but that engaged employees bring returning customers.  And we were fortunate to have Leonard & Ben (with brains & something to say).  

If I could make 2 suggestions they'd be:  a definite singing guitarist on that wonderful indoor patio w/fireplace; and that North Italia add another day to the Mon.-Thur. happy hour.  Everybody else does.

P.S.  We not only dine out for the cuisine, but for the ""experience.""",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,0,0,4,hBQo0nXbRHORyX2FcTnfpQ

We stopped in after a friend told us about the great deal. You can get a a pitcher of sangria, or bottle of red/white wine with the chef charcuterie board for $20. The board is huge and is easily worth the price alone. 

We had also ordered the margherita pizza, zucc chips, and two more bottles of wine from the happy hour menu. In addition, we ordered the burrata salad and the shaved vegetable salad. It was all delicious. The last salad and the chefs board were the stand outs. 

We had also ordered 2 desserts. The hazelnut cake with salted caramel ice cream and the almond tart were both delicious. We also finished with the Last Great Wine Thief and their housemade raspberry lemoncello.

Delicious dressing that would encourage you to eat more vege!! The short rib pasta was good but not to the point that I would jump screaming wow.

Definitely make a reservation is your best bet, since they seem to be busy all the time. I went on a Monday night around 7pm and it was filled! 

I went with my friend for her birthday and we started off with a glass of wine. I ordered the house Pinot Grigio, the 2nd one on the wine list- which was sweeter, they say. They brought out bread, which how could you say no?! I wish it was hot when they delivered it. But, the oil and vinegar just made it all better. 

I then shared the Mediterranean mussels and margherita pizza, which was the perfect amount. The mussels were ok, it was definitely better towards the middle of the pot since the sauce was stirred and simmered on to the mussels. As for the margherita pizza, AMAZING! Perfect amount of cheese and a basil leaf to balance it out. 

And last but not least, the salted caramel bundino for dessert, talk about never wanting it to end. It was soooo good!

5586755,2018-02-09,2,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"I had such high hopes. A Friday night, starting at the outside bar then moving indoors.

We had to flag down someone at the bar after a full 15 minutes of zero eye contact. While waiting for a table that was to take 10 minutes, the host also avoided us until we stepped up to ask for an update. The bartender that did eventually help us knew her stuff, and is a big part of us sticking around. Great info and great recommendation. Over 40 minutes later, and staying because of the great bartender, we finally sat down.

The area is great and the layout is fun - love the huge patio! - but overall it was... meh. Our main server (we seemed to have a server and a million runners) was personable and *seemed* knowledgeable at first, but there were too many corrections to the information she was giving us on wines and dishes that it became a problem. Asking for help from others during long periods of her absence garnered a lot of ""someone will be right with you"".

Again, most staff were personable but for being sloooow, and the atmosphere was as expected (in the best way). The food was fine, but unremarkable based on the pricing and serving for this area. 

We felt there were quite a few - we THINK - unintentional bait-and-switch moments with specials/features and wines. Sell us on something... but then so much was out or changed or not as advertised. 

I want to try again because it's close by/convenient and I love the space, but after the actual experience I'm reticent to try again.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,2,2,XV09vnyogkY8cgCO3voh3Q

We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away. Our table shared the chef's board which was amazing. Great starter. And in fact, my favorite dish today. We each ordered something different to have a taste of everything. 

The squid ink mafaldine was delicious. Wish it was real squid ink sauce but handmade pasta will do too. The sauce was flavorful, slightly spicy, and more water than saucy.

The Bolognese has had great reviews on here and was recommended by friends. Though it was tasty, I thought it would be better. Maybe all the hype just got to me. Don't get me wrong, the dish was great. But I want to say I've tried better!

The strozzapreti was a pleasant surprise. I totally wasn't going to order it, but my friend did. The truffle flavor was perfect. Just enough salty and savory to do the trick. 

The Today's Omelette was also yummy. The crispy potatoes were a hit! Along with the truffle bread. I didn't have too much of this dish but my husband enjoyed it. 

And of course, all the pastas were perfectly cooked.

Outside of the slow and undesirable service...the food was top notch. This restaurant would make it on food alone and it might just be so good that it would compensate for the miserable service. 

The waitress asked if we needed boxes and obviously sees we have a pizza and realized after she brings tiny boxes that....yeah pizza...doesn't quite go in a tiny box. I'm not sure what kind of experience she has in restaurant....but she really needs some training.

I haven't been to Rome (yet), but this place gave me a little taste of what I vision it to be.

It's located in the little shopping area off the corner of Rampart and Charleston. You'll see a Pottery Barn and Honey Salt. The exterior of this place is super cute - Instagram worthy, if you ask me. They have an outdoor patio with a huge fireplace. I'm sure it looks gorgeous at night. 

My friend and I went early on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty packed, but we were seated right away. We had requested to sit outdoors and I'm glad we did. It was slightly windy, but it didn't take away from the experience. Our sever (I wish I remembered her name) was the sweetest. She gave us a rundown of the menu and even recommended her favorite items. One of options we chose was the Chef's Board. The part that stuck out the most was when the cheese was being described.

5909340,2018-02-11,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"I really like this place! My boyfriend and I came for dinner on a Friday night and the food was very good. We ended up arriving right as happy hour was ending and we were lucky enough to find a spot at the bar. The bar atmosphere is amazing, as the bar opens to the outside which gives you a great opportunity to enjoy the patio vibe. The place has a beautiful ambiance!

I started with a cocktail, and ordered the Julietta which is ginger infused vodka, vanilla, st. germain, lime and prosecco. This was such a fun cocktail and very tasty. I highly recommend it!  For food we started with the Chef's Board which includes prosciutto, artisan cheese, marinated eggplant, roasted peppers, olives and almonds. This was a great starter and shareable item. The bread that came with the Chef's Board was a little to crispy, and could do without it being soooo toasted. When then shared a Margherita Pizza, the basil was fresh and there was a good amount of mozzarella.... so you can never go wrong there, came out hot and delicious. 

I was a bit disappointed when I went to order a glass of wine and they seemed to be out of every options that I asked for. I was wanting red and all they could offer was white, so I ended up getting the last 2 ounces of a pinot. 

Overall the food and atmosphere are wonderful! I know that the restaurant is still new and I can hope that the attentiveness of the service will improve. The staff were all very friendly and kind, but lacking attentiveness, and would forget drink orders all together. Although each time they were very apologetic, it was a bit exhausting. (and when we tried to sympathize by saying this must be a really busy night they responded with no, this is actually slower than normal for a Friday)",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,0,0,3,Yn971M6Lhf3YbIOvBNwHYw

Third time's a charm I guess.... until I found a beard hair in my food. It has a cool atmosphere and they comp'd my meal, but would strongly advise looking through your food before eating it, per the beard hair or just find a different place to go to brunch. A friend told me he found hair in his food before I went. Didn't think that would happen to me. They don't wear hairnets at all, even the hairy bearded guy.

5917114,2018-05-18,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"A friend highly  recommend this restaurant. We were seated and greeted by a friendly server.  We ordered and received our drinks and appetizer timely. However, our meal took over 45 minutes for a salad and  pesto chicken pasta dish.   The server was very apologetic and offered a free dessert.  When we asked for our Diet Pepsi, we asked for very little ice, then no ice.  Both times the sever completely disregarded or didn't hear the request.  When they served the food, my drink was empty and she didn't offer a refill. I had to ask another server to get our server to refill.  Basically after the food was finally dropped, so was the service.  Food was excellent, but experience  was over 2 hours for the 2 of us.",HQ3swlX4oAuHsqin4SdRWg,0,0,2,nPqNeFatnOvrLKhMIly8ZQ

5947929,2018-03-28,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"When sitting at the bar at 6pm on a Tuesday, it was moderately busy. The barback after about 10 mins came over, threw down 2 menus for me and a friend, and walked off. Not even a ""how are you, I'll be right with you"".

10 more mins go by, both bartender and barback continue to walk by us, serving others and making drink tickets. I had to interrupt him and ask for 2 draft beers. It seemed to be a bother to him. After we had sat there for 20 minutes.

I had to ask someone to order, I had to ask for each beer while they continuously provided horrible service, even had to ask for my tab, a togo box. 

Ordered a pig pizza to start, waited 15 mins then ordered 2 pasta dishes. It all came out at the same time ?

Not one single time were we asked did we need anything, how was the food, etc. And we're right in front of you. Me and a friend, $100 tab with the worst service I've had in Vegas. Won't be back.

My main course didn't fill me up at a petite barely over 5ft! No bread with tortellini pasta either? Manager explained that is by request only! That's not Vegas! You need to conform to foodie culinary ways of Vegas! Give this manager ability to be successful! Allow your service professionals to ask guests if they want bread so this restaurant can be successful! It's busy but from the people at the bar it's ok.... make it amazing and give decent portions and offer bread! Let the manager perform magic! He appears extremely customer centered and amazing!

5973672,2018-02-16,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,Well where do I begin? I'd first like to say I'm an occasional customer at this restaurant and it's a little disappointing that when I get there that the options were limited to a three course menu. That's not a bad idea but don't take away your ENTIRE menu! It's not what we came for. That's a little ridiculous you know? To top it all off all I hear is this guy in the kitchen yelling screaming and cursing the entire night and it's on Valentine's Day! Nobody wants to hear that and it was very off putting. The only reason why I didn't put one star is because I do like this place and the food was good.,rD0vlg4Qv2qI_tKbCpWhGg,0,0,2,lSUSGTFM0juJJcLBp3S7Hg
5987856,2018-03-25,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"We (2 of us) went on a Friday night and it was packed. It was a 30 minutes wait, which isn't terrible so we stayed. Usually when we wait we go and grab a drink but after standing at the bar for what seemed like an uncomfortable amount of time with no one acknowledging us we gave up and went to wait outside. We asked a few of the hostesses if there was a way someone was able to get us a drink while we wait and she said our only option was to wait at the bar. We had already tried that with no luck. There was quite a few empty tables so I wasn't sure why there was a wait. After the drink situation I wanted to leave but I knew my boyfriend had wanted to come here for awhile so we stayed. I noticed that a lot of people that came after us got seated before us. I was getting pretty upset but I thought maybe it was due to them having reservations. I was going to get up and ask but then we were seated. Obviously so far my experience wasn't the best but the reason I still gave it 4 stars is because I thought the service, once we sat down was so great! The entire staff works so well together! I've never been to a restaurant where everyone helps each other out the way that they did. Everyone was very nice. Our server was Laura (that's what the bill said so I hope that's correct) and she was great! Always up-selling (which worked!) and she did her job so well. Never got overwhelmed with it being so busy so definitely give some props to her! The restaurant itself is really pretty, trendy. Food was good. Overall, I would come back and I would recommend to friends but if you can, definitely make a reservation or go on a weekday.",8hFr2rtxQKh1EIH2eDvdcA,0,0,4,0R3cIrHaAZp_MDYqAS64TQ
5995135,2018-01-21,0,oRbrnRAXGQetQDbkDhJp8w,"This was a very popular spot for many Las Vegans as we visited thinking that it would not be busy. We were wrong. Thankfully, we were served right away because we opted to be seated outside. It was windy and cold, but thank god they had covers that made prevented the draft from entering. 

The ambiance was romantic with many guests dining in with significant others. But this was also enjoyed by friends and family as the room was filled with muffled chats from everyone. 

Our server was overly friendly as she helped us order our food and checked on us pretty frequently. They really cared that your beverage is filled to the rim so they often came back to refill our drinks when necessary. That was quite impressive for me. 

We ordered the Chicken Pesto, Bolognese, and White Truffle Garlic Bread. 

Chicken Pesto: I thought the pasta was not cooked thoroughly which made me enjoy the chicken instead. But it was delicious overall. I've always thought pesto didn't taste much so I was happy to learn that they have a different style of pesto that had hints of flavor with this plate. It wasn't too salty and you can taste the hints of garlic with it. Delicious. 

Bolognese: Loved the cheese and the meat sauce that went with it. It was simple but heightened in another way as I enjoyed every bite of this meal. Would I order it again? Certainly. 

Garlic Bread: I've heard a lot of good things about this plate, but I wasn't too impressed by it. I understand it's made with truffle but that wasn't enough to give it that ""wow"" factor for me. I also thought the side of cheese was a little weird as I couldn't figure out if it was indeed cheese or butter. 

Also, serving the garlic bread was delayed as they gave it to the other table next to us. To our surprise, they apologized for the mishap and made a fresh batch, free of charge.",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,2,0,4,xjZOB8T2cQ-fh8vhrr2jPg
