Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the UYE treks that Nelson put together due to work obligations. But after having these tacos, I probably should have used up all my sick days hehe. The only thing I regretted was taking such a long period of time to try these delectable morsels of flava'.

For parking, try to find a spot at the gas station or on the nearby streets. It can get kinda sketchy late at night so keep a lookout!

So I ordered three al pastor tacos with pineapple. First off, you know they are going to do things right when they use fresh pineapple. When the tacos came out, they were a great sized portion. Heading over to the sides station, I decided to try a different sauce on each taco. Added on cilantro and limes, and I was good to go.

That first bite... Forget about it. Forget about every al pastor taco you've had in your life. Because these guys? Yea, they know what's up. The smoky richness of the pork layered by the perfect blend of seasonings and spices. Trust me, you need to go here. The sauces? Amazing! Try some and find out which one you like!

First off, they charged $8 for a carne asada burrito with just beans and meat (which tasted like dog food). I couldn't even eat it.

Second, I ordered al pastor tacos because that it what everyone raves about on the reviews. Mediocre at best. Also, the woman who took our order was incredibly rude. She called ""next"" so we stepped up to order. Then she proceeded to organize her cash register while we stood there for a good while. I understand that you may need a minute but at least look up and acknowledge us. I don't even care if its in spanish! I asked for flour tortillas and she told me it would be an additional $2 PER taco. Then all of a sudden she changed it to $2.15 out of nowhere. I'm sorry but $2.15 for a freakin flour tortilla on a street taco?! I'm pretty sure she just made that price up to discourage me from ordering it (which worked). 

I got the orange colored hot sauce thinking it would be the hottest and put it on my tacos. Literally had to drench them in it to get any sort of flavor. It wasn't even hot. I was also surprised at how bland the meat was. It looks so delicious but definitely does not deliver.

The Red Sauce is slammin, red chili with lascivious use of garlic but the Green Sauce steals the show.

About the ""restaurant"" 
You *must* contain the ability to eat your tacos while staring down anyone within a 35' radius because there will be zombie-like bums schlepping their way towards you while you wolf down what are probably the best damn tacos in Vegas.

I hadn't been in a while so I popped by after a game at Cashman. This spot is 24/7, and despite less workspace, put out better product than their brick and mortar restaurant a few blocks to the west. 

The tacos are solid, with pliable, thick corn tortillas that are heated but not fried or oily. The lengua is good and the asada is smoky, but for a place named after the al pastor, that particular protein didn't blow me away. The quesadillas are huge and though it's hard to go wrong with chicken and cheese, it's one of my favorites. Always ask for their orange salsa-  it looks like it would be habanero-based but it has a lot of flavor and not a ton of spice.

If you see a food truck that's slinging tacos surrounded by a ton of mexicans,, you can bet you're gonna get the good stuff. The real authentic Mexican eats that you'll remember for life.

If you're that ""I love cheapotle"" type, please, don't embarrass yourself. Stay American amigo, trust me, they don't want you coming around here talking smack anyways. This is for the serious food trippers, definitely not for the chicken fingers and fried potato sticks people.

Forget the beef and the chicken (pollo) meat. Those meats are like the general tso's chicken of Mexican food. This is where they met the American tastebuds half way. Please order the Al Pastor, it's a much higher level of meat that's loved ALL OVER the WORLD. Yes sir, there is a world outside the USA and they don't prefer beef or chicken. 

Lengua, Buche or Tripa is the good stuff. Trust me on that when I tell you. These are usually the good stuff that you don't eat everyday. It takes a special someone who knows what they're doing to make it really delicious. Someone sent to earth by God himself. 

There's a condiment station next to the truck. There you'll pick up your onions, cilantro, the grilled jalape√±os and onions. Get some sauce too,, green is tomatillo, red is Chipotle or sometimes tamarind. While sticking condiments in your baggie, you just can't stop but imagine all them good flavors mixing together and creating destruction in your mouth.

We should all eat in places like these. But not all food trucks are created equal, some are way better than others. This one, is the truth!!

Tacos should come from a place that has the menu written in Spanish - check. Tacos should be so delicious - check.

After my volunteer shift at The Neon Museum I was heading back home when I noticed their trailer opening, I decided to check them out after hearing good things about their tacos, let's say they did not disappoint.

My first plate was 2 El Pastor, 1 Asada, and 1 Chorizo taco.  The chef cooked them up in a hurry and before long I was standing over a plate of awesome. The Chrosizo was good, a nice little kick but not too much spice. The Asada was probably my least favorite, it was good, but out done by the other tacos. The El Pastor Tacos were INSANE, seriously I asked how much for me to take the entire roast off the spit.

The fixings/toppings bar was nice, I went with only a splash of lime, but the salsas and other options were all fresh and everyone trying them seemed to like the offerings.

After Plate one I knew there needed to be Plate 2, so I ordered up 3 more El Pastor and 1 Lingua. The Lingua was really good (probably my 2nd favorite to the El pastor).  

So in the end I had 8 tacos, I probably could have had another plate, but I needed to get going. I can say I will be eating there again, it'll be a great place to grab lunch after my shifts at the Neon Museum.

Oh I also forgot the tacos are $1.50 each, they come on top of 2 tortillas, and are served with only meat and tortilla, there is a bar you can add salsa/veggies if you want, but I kept mine simple",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,10,11,5,rZi6xg1H1UXk9779nnGmYw

Hands down, Tacos El Pastorcito has the best al pastor in Vegas. I've been across the city from the chain stores to the street-corner taquerias whose menus aren't even in English. This place ranks at the very top. Yes, it's on a street corner in the parking lot of a tire shop -- BUT it has an ""A"" rating from the heath inspector (most mobile kitchens are ""B""s at best). Yes, it's in a ghetto part of town, but it's 30 seconds off the freeway, so suck it up, jump off the 96 and risk your personal safety for 5 minutes while you pick up some of the best tacos in Vegas. 

The carne asada is worth the risk and the al Pastor will make you completely forget that you are surrounded by drunken creepers staggering home from Fremont Street.

Quick Review¬ô
* Trailer in the NW side of the Payless Tire (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tire-shop-payless-las-vegas) lot offering delicious, genuine Mexican taco cuisine (2$ a pop) on the corner of LV Blvd & Bonanza. Don't be scurred. 
* Among the best tacos in all of the Las Vegas Valley.
* Cash for anything under 10$ or some similar amount.

It's a stand/trailer. It's in a non-gentrified part of a major city. Uh oh .... Automatically: people are scared. Don't be scurred. Nick Diaz wouldn't be scared. Stockton! (Free Nick Diaz!)

I have only been here in the late afternoon or late night and I am still alive. I was just here last night (Friday) at 2 A.M. Still alive. I'm sure there is a Chipotle¬Æ in Summerlin or Green Valley where you would be more at home at though, if it is that serious to you.

This entire review section is dedicated to putting forth the hypothesis that it is perfectly safe here. Crime statistics show that crimes against persons are overwhelmingly committed by people that the victim knows/knew. If you know a methhead that resides on and off at one of the two Siegel¬Æs within jalape√±o throwing distance of Buen Pastor, then keep going to Summerlin Mall for your authentic Mexican. ¬°Payaso baboso!

I have tried everything here. Everything! Well, everything besides the burritos. That's ridiculous and not Mexican. Or tripas because that is just gross.

Full disclosure: I am not huge on al pastor. I also have no clue what promotions they have here (if any). I come -- eat -- and go on my way. Chicken is my favourite because it may be the healthiest offering here. 

No desserts except very very very seldom they offer a flan that is not to my likening. Half or more of the time I have patronised, they also don't even have horchata. Of course this is not scientific at all. Maybe they have horchata during the daytime and run out every day at 2 P.M.; I don't know. Figure it out on your own, asshole!

There are also cans of soda-pop, if you do that. I once heard ""coco"" as an option when I asked what drinks they had (when it was obvious there was no horchata) so I figured it was either coconut water or the old Coco Rico¬Æ soda which is just the only carbonated beverage (along with Inca Kola¬Æ) which will get me to drink nasty sugary mess. The guy gave me a Coca Cola¬Æ. Fuck ... and I even know Spanish. 

Pro Tip: Coco/Coca = Original Coca Cola¬Æ
Pro Tip: Mande = What's up/huh?
Pro Tip: Don't get anything from the candy vending in the parking lot of the tyre place.

There are car park stalls available whenever I go in the southwest corner of Payless. Actually, there is parking available whenever I go. YMMV.

I work down the street and this is the closest food place to get anything.

 The steak tacos are AMAZING. Beautiful seasoning (then again I'm a wimp when it comes to seasoning so there's that) and are 2.50 a pop. A little pricey but honestly SO WORTH. 

I also get a cheese quisladdas for 5 bucks give or take 50 cents and Damm if I've never had so much cheese in one of these before, it is God sent. One time they even accidently gave me a steak quisladdas and didn't charge me extra for it. I can vouch that it was amazing.

I also got a special burrito made (bean cheese rice with sour cream) today, they put lettuce in it for some reason but damn was it good (and I Hate lettuce in my food) and they brought the price down from 8 bucks to 5 bucks for my order.

There is also a little cart thingy full of sauces and sides and it does have a drop cover thing so it is very sanitary, also has the time written on each part so you know how fresh it is. 

Customer service here is fantastic always smiling and happy to make you special orders I usually have this nice gentleman that's really nice to me in the early afternoons. They make your food to order so expect to wait between 5 to 10 min for your order depending on how busy it is but man is it worth the wait. 

Now please note before you rage about the 2.50 street tacoz and 8 buck burritos, how close this truck is to the strip and the fact that it is permenetly parked in a parking lot of a business meaning : they are expecting a lot of tourists so of course that's gonna bring the price up a little, and they are more likely than not paying rent to have their truck parked so might also be effecting the prices.

I can't recommend this place enough, I always point it out to tourists at my job, and it's a short walk from Freemont so please check this place out!",j6Hf8aj75DECe78t5SWoVQ,1,0,5,qa7RK5qwp9VMY6vCnKMIlQ

If you're a big fan of street tacos then you have to check out this place.  The Al Pastor w/ pineapple remind much like El Gordos's Adobada Tacos, but instead they have slightly larger tortilla, more meat, better hot sauce, and cheaper at $1.50 pop.   I also like how  their pineapple chunks are a lot smaller because each bite is more balance.  

Things they need to improve:
-The quesadilla cheese need to be melted.  My first bite and I could still see the shredded mozzarella inside.  Would be better if they use Oaxaca cheese or something.
-The tortilla for the tacos need some work.  Put some oil on those babies or something.
-They have a condiment bar on the side which could be a good thing or a bad thing.  I think it would have been nice if the cooks handled the onions and cilantro part, but that's just me nitpicking.

The lot was crowded when i got there, so i had to park across the street.  I think the location of this stand is great because of all the foot traffic it receive, but it doesn't feel all that sunny if you know what i mean.  

So ever since this encounter, i've been having mixed cravings between this stand and Taco El Gordos.  And that's saying a lot mi amigo.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,6,3,4,MWVW72shRk3fYzGwRhRz6g
4108155,2015-09-24,5,JIfSollg32ifUzTw2K4PDQ,"If there's any al pastor in Vegas that's better, please tell me right away. I need to know.

I've avoided coming back to this taco stand since last year for one reason or another, but since I'm working nearby for a little while, it was so easy to stop by Taqueria El Buen Pastor. Having learned about the standing buy one get one free offer for tacos al pastor on Wednesdays, I've been back on that specific day of the week twice now. At $1 a pop when discounted, those babies were all that I ordered, and they were all that I needed.

I'm not sure how they encase their other tacos, but the tortillas on these get crisped slightly but with minimal use of oil, if any. They're a great base for the excellent fillings. Speaking of which, you have to get the pineapples with the tacos al pastor. Luckily, the cashier has asked me both times whether I wanted it served with pineapple. I'm pretty sure they grill the pineapple up to add that extra flavor to what's already a great sweet and crunchy element. 

The meat itself is a fantastic savory, sweet, and somewhat smoky experience that works even without additional salsa. If and when you do go for salsa, skip the tomatillo salsa because it just doesn't complement the al pastor meat. Get either the spicy avocado salsa, the orange colored salsa, or perhaps both (note to self: try that next time). Just don't forget to add the onions, cilantro, and even lime to your liking. Those are essential for adding even more flavor and texture, so don't forget to stop at that metal-covered condiment station.

I told myself before that I would try their other tacos, but the al pastor tacos alone are enough to make Taqueria El Buen Pastor a must-visit. That's even before considering the BOGO offer on Wednesdays, which makes it all the better. Maybe I'll be able to justify trying the other meats if I have an interesting night in Downtown Las Vegas, but I'd be perfectly content without them.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,5,B9sf78EvZ7ozuR9vhK1TUg

Almost passed on this one once we found it in a sketchy neighborhood. Almost under the freeway, I first noticed the rainbow, marquee for Taqueria El Buen Pastor scrolling on a tire and lube business. Confused for a moment, we then noticed the busy taco truck parked on the corner. I echo others' observation about being on your gaurd around this area; I was reminded here that NV is an open carry state.

Warning: Very limited parking! We came around 10pm and had to park in the ""gated"" motel lot next door. 

Couldn't tell if the lady was being condescending or not as she lengthily greeted my white-face-and-red-hair in Spanish. My Filipino companion greeted her in English to which she answered in perfect English the remainder of our encounter...

Prices are higher than what I'm used to pretty much everywhere in CA. I'm not sure if it's just this place or LV in general but I was surprised. $2 for tacos, $3.50 for ranchero (super) which comes with cheese, rice, beans, guac, and crema. Of course, Ranchero comes with less meat in order to make room for all those extra goodies. Standard burritos $8. Ordered the pastor (of course). Best part of these tacos is the inclusion of pineapple in the pastor; The sweet-salty spice combination is tasty. The actual spice flavor of the pastor was okay, could have been marinated longer or been more generous with the spice. Portions are pretty good- this is a meaty taco. The tortilla is on the smaller side but pretty full with meat. They have a mexican fixins' bar with cilantro/onion, salsas, limes, etc. I'd say the ranchero isn't worth it but get the regular taco. $2 extra for ""guacamole avocado""...(!)

It's located in the parking lot of the Payless tire shop on the corner of Bonanza and Las Vegas Blvd, its very crowed, cars parked all around and most are not for the food truck. You almost get hit by cars trying to pull in and out, you have to pay real attention. 2: it's very unorganized there is three different lines for the food truck, order, pick up and getting your own toppings and salsas. It's very confusing to which line is which, you stand there for thirty minutes trying to figure out where to stand. People are just standing around everywhere. 3: Everything is pretty much in Spanish.

It's a taco truck, so I was initially averse to the idea of eating outside at 3 AM in the cold. However, after finding out that the California's Market Street Cafe was closed for its monthly (what are the chances?) cleaning, we were left with few other choices.

It's on the street corner, but it's brightly lit so you can't miss it. The neighborhood isn't the greatest, and a couple of loud, drunk people walked by, but they kept their distance. I'll admit I was a little anxious; it was cold, late, and I just wanted to eat my food and go home. Thankfully, there was a patio heater right next to the older Mexican woman who took our orders (she was quite nice).

I ordered one carne asada taco and a pastor huarache. Once I got my food though, I didn't regret standing out in the cold. The carne asada was delicious, and the pastor was super crispy, just the way I like it. The quality of the ingredients is excellent, and the taste is way better than anything you could get at most local chains.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend people to check out this taco truck. Maybe moreso when it gets a little warmer, though.",bwA9IoQ4Y-fJCgEaBXfJMA,0,0,5,KlIlWZmGwbiBQEOjVlinzg

When we were with a group of friends at a downtown bar, I took the opportunity to suggest capping the night with some tacos. 

So it's not the gentrified part of downtown and is a much more colorful crowd, but calm the fuck down you will be fine. Soon enough they are opening a actual brick and mortar across from the Cardenas market on Decatur and Meadows Ln. While they are building the interior, they have a stand in the parking lot up and running so you can try them there as well. 

Tacos are $2 and they also do basics like tortas, burritos, quesadilla, etc.One of the few stands that take cards ($5 minimum to use credit/debit). 

I got pastor tacos which were solid like last time. A bit of char crispy bits, the seasoning was good on them and has grease, but not too greasy that it's gross. They dont ask you if you want pineapple, you have to tell them as we didn't get any on ours. 

Cabeza was shredded finely so meat and fatty bits is incorporated together well. It was tender and wonderful aside from it could use a tiny bit more salt though I fixed that myself with seasoning it. 

I love their pickled onions here at the salsa bar. They're sweet, a little bit of tang and really spicy with the thin slices of ripe habanero chilies what I originally thought was carrot.

Definitely love this spot. Cheap, tasty and open late (3pm til 1am Tue-Sun).",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,4,4,vvD6kO-msQ4BZ0rGgr95TQ

I have been overhearing that they have one of the best al pastor in town...So I finally got to put it to the test 

First of all, tacos here are pretty cheap. Almost every meat is $1.50, with the Lengua at an even $2.  Pic of the tacos! :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tacos-el-pastorcito-las-vegas?select=qW-Q6OtVPQMb_-RHQNV7mg#qW-Q6OtVPQMb_-RHQNV7mg

The Al Pastor here was good but not the best in my opinion. The taco felt a little light on the meat, but you do get what you pay for. It had lots of flavor, but not quite as good as the other two spots I have recently tried. I think you will like it, I'm just looking for the best in town!

But what was great was the Lengua! As you can see in the picture, they shred it instead of cubing it, which gave it a nice Barbacoa like consistency, and packed with juices and flavors! I really liked this...the best Lengua taco I have ran into so far!

The Chorizo was nice and flavorful...slightly oily like it should be. Lots of other places in town serve it practically dry...I like juices in my Chorizo!

Lastly, they have a salsa bar area to DIY, and the salsas have plenty of depth and not watery and boring like some other places. Give them a try...they are open late!",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,1,4,7dnEm3dZWYHHkRRg1TpJ_w

Now, the Strip is an awful place for any kind of food, or so my hosts who have lived in Vegas for a while, told me. Trouble is, I thought this food truck was reasonably away from all the neon. Apparently not.

I asked for tacos with chicken. There was a self-service station for toppings (salsa, onions, olives etc.). The ingredient quality was appalling, the meat was poorly cooked and grossly overdone; the flavor (presumably from the convenience store oil used for frying) was inconsistent and mediocre. I don't favor the idea of putting a station for toppings on the side of the road anyway. In my experience, food trucks tend to use the limited real estate to make choices on behalf of customers. This tends to get them their often-unique identity. The do-it-your-way vibe is a lot more suited for Moe's or Chipotle.

The pastor tacos are really good too, with the pineapple, but I'm a die hard carne asada fan. Every thing I've eaten here has been LEGIT. 

Carne asada tacos- 5/5. 
Lengua tacos- 5/5.  It's not gummy like the beef tongue at KBBQ. It is soft and tender and you'd think you're eating braised pork or beef. 
Al Pastor Tacos- 4/5.
Carne Asada Burrito- 5/5  IT ACTUALLY has RICE IN IT like California with you asking or adding or paying extra!!!! Only place in vegas I've found that it comes with it!

BBQ FAjita Burrito - 5/5.  If you like BBQ flavors, you will LOVE THIS burrito. The fajita has a nice bbq flavor and it is PACKED with grilled bell peppers, onions, and maybe even red peppers? 

And last but not least...THE HORCHATA is amazing. I don't even LIKE horchata nor do I order it EVER. Maybe twice in my lifetime I've had it prior, and I am a huge fan because of this place.

We even bitched about how the Tex-Mex sucks ever since Margarita's Cantina got blown up in 06. Well, she told me that the only good Al Pastor in Las Vegas is located on Bonanza road near the ""shitty part of town"". I drove down Bonanza from Rancho all the way to Hollywood, and this was the only street taco stand I could find. I just assumed this had to be the place. She was right, it was really good. Just out of personal preference, I still like Taco Taco on Trop better because of the unique seasoning. But, I enjoyed the slices of pineapples that TACOS EL PASTORCITO put in my al pastor taco, and they had this special salsa that was bright orange and tasted like Mexican Tan Tan Men. 3 Al Pastor tacos only ended up being $4.50, and they were pretty big compared to other street tacos. The service was extremely friendly and one of the cooks was really good at setting boundaries for the large homeless population in the area. TACOS EL PASTORCITO is located in the parking lot of a Llantera place, right across the street from a Siegel Suites and what I believe was possibly the wreckage of a UFO(you will see what I mean when you get there). When you wait in line, you will be confronted by multiple druggies and homeless who will either ask you: ""You got a cigarette I can borrow?"", or ""Got 50 cents so I can catch the bus?"".  Well, the cook does a great job screaming aggressive things in Spanish to these people and getting them to run back into the alley for a while. Usually a couple of minutes later they come creeping back out and then the angry cooks starts yelling again... this cycle continues all night long.  I also  liked the regular customers. Most of them are older Mexican men who like to talk about professional boxing. I had a fun conversation while waiting for my tacos.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,11,11,5,QlvdgPcZYOn59IDF8n_QkQ
