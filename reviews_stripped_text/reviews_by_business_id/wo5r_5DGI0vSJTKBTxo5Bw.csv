Both of my parents ordered the soup of the day which was lobster bisque. I tried a bite and it was decent, kind of rich.  3/5

My dad ordered a full rack of baby back ribs. They were very, very tender and good. I wasn't in the mood for ribs, but after I tried his I wished I'd ordered the ribs. 4/5

For sides my dad had cole slaw (fine 3/5) and ranch beans (kinda sweet, okay 2.5/5).

I had the salmon and shrimp picatta. It okay, but I wouldn't order it again. I didn't care for how the salmon was prepared and the sauce wasn't very flavorful. 2/5

For sides I had rice pilaf (good, nothing special 3/5) and creamed spinach (would not order again, didn't taste good and a major disappointment since it was listed as a ""premium side"" 1/5).

My mom ordered the fillet medallions with bleu cheese and wild mushroom topping. They were fine but certainly nothing to get excited about. 2/5

She had the loaded mashed potatoes. They were pretty good and were the best of the sides that we tried. 3.5/5

The service was not great (2/5). The waitress was overly chatty and seemed kind of flustered or something. Also, she kept fanning herself when she took our order and told us she was having hot flashes, which I didn't really need to know. 

Overall, 2.5/5.  The only thing that was really good was the ribs. Of course, that's what they're known for. Definitely recommend getting the ribs if you go here. Everything else, meh.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,2,0,2,FsXh5Yc5ba2AXmOICLW6sA

Then reality set in. 1.) they changed the menu since I'd been there (more than a year had passed) and I wasn't happy to see my favorites gone. However I picked a burger, and we had an onion loaf. They no longer keep sauces on the table and the waiter seemed annoyed when we asked for a selection of sauces. This used to be one of the best parts of the visits for me, the tasty sauces! He brought little samples and they were as good as they used to be, unfortunate that they no longer put them table side. 

The food was a bit below average, the quality, taste and temp was a bit off. The service was slow and distracted which seemed odd considering only a some handful of customers were there.  The check took about 30 minutes to arrive, that was after we were totally done and the plates were cleared. He knew we were done yet he went missing for 30 minutes.

Unfortunately, a lot has changed for this restaurant since then, specifically now with their raised prices and smaller portions. Oh and can I mention that they don't offer the 4 different bbq sauces on the tables anymore? Just more of an inconvenience to have to ask the servers for it. I guess they're really trying to save costs, huh?

I came here last night and ordered the full slab of baby back ribs with a side of baked potato and rice (It's the only item that I order every time I dine here). Their baby back ribs glazed with their bbq sauce are freakin good and has always been freakin good. The ribs are so tender and juicy. However, I feel like their portions have been gradually decreasing over the years. And I'm confident to say that two full slabs today would make up a full slab back in the day along with cheaper prices. 

Sadly, due to a lot of their changes, I think they lost a lot of business. However, if I'm really craving baby back ribs which isn't very often these days, I will most likely end up coming back here.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,3,1,3,4PSoum--BM_nNeQHQNFbqQ

3766239,2013-02-18,1,wo5r_5DGI0vSJTKBTxo5Bw,"Received a free birthday coupon, they are cutting down.  It used to be ""one free entree"", now it was up to $15 (what can you get for that?)  Last time we were here in June, I fell over their sign and had to eat with my leg elevated and swollen.     I had ordered rib steak which  was $23 and came practically blue.   When it was served again, it looked totally different and over cooked.   However, it WAS rib steak.    We went back on 2/15 and were seated immediately.    The server ""hovered""  I hate that!

I knew what I wanted to order, but it was annoying.     My husband wanted the short ribs because he likes it and it  is very soft.  $17 and NO SALAD or SOUP goes with it.

To me,  anything over $15 should come with that.   Their spareribs were over $21 and also do not come with soup or salad.     I make better spareribs as the one time I ordered it when it came for a 1/2 rack special it was overcooked and dry.

We went a few times last year and the 3 filet medallions were good at $19, but after going to Roy Yamaguchis and having a filet, this doesn't even compare!    Roy;s was GREAT.   Of course we didn't pay for it, we went to a ""finance seminar"".

To get back to Tony Roma's this time, I ordered the rib steak, now $25.   Seriously, I took one look at it and it did not LOOK at all like a rib Isteak, even one without a bone. I asked the server to call over the manager, and she looked at the steak which I had only cut into one slice and said ""That is a rib steak""    Well, it didn't taste or look like a rib steak.  At least not one cut from the center of a prime rib.   It tasted more like  a strip steak or  sirloin and was extremely firm.     The prime rib at the Suncoast buffet was ten times better and they cut it to order.   We pay $9.99 there.

Well, I ate the steak and gave half to my husband, but wrote to Tony Roma's corporate office.       I am waiting for a reply from their Operations Manager.
I am not sure if I will return there for steak anyway.    Maybe the filets.   

 We went to Outback and a few weeks ago had the exact same experience with the rib steak.   It was definitely NOT a rib steak.  The manager came over, apologized and picked out one personally and when I ate it , it was definitely  RIB steak.     Next time I am going to Austin's at the Texas Station.  For $5 more I can get a great steak and it comes with soup or salad and a vegetable.",8huKgRX0AWOIBpq97fXycw,1,1,2,71HoFYb_-rh-RD8ouY4mpQ

- 4 Stars for the ribs and margarita; 3 stars for the overall experience.

My wife and I love to go to Tony Roma's for its babyback ribs in various cities. We went to this location (after its renovation) on a Thur evening for Happy Hour and dinner.
- The ribs and margarita were great, as were the hostess and the wait staff. But we did not like its pull pork sandwich - much too bland! The HH was OK but no excitement.

DINNER:
- The babyback ribs ($18, whole slab) were tasty as ever, though the portion seemed to be smaller than usual. The pull pork sandwich ($7.5) was disappointing, however, with a pâté-like texture and a bland taste.

HAPPY HOUR (4-7):
- They have a small, nice bar counter with Sports TV's; no patio seating. One can have HH anywhere in the restaurant besides the bar. For HH drinks, draft beer, $3-4; wine, $4; house margarita, $5. The magarita is delicious.

At the bar coumter, wedid not see many young people: - The atmosphere was kind of low key, quite different from that at the Kona Grill or Gordon Biersch, where it is usually more lively, exciting, noisy, and crowded with people waiting in line. Well, the bar was almost full between 6-7, so Tony Roma must have its own followers.
- I'd guess that people who enjoy the type of happy hour atmosphere at Kona Grill or Gordon Birsch probably would not go out of their way to go to Tony Roma's just for its happy hour only.

The hostess at Tony Roma was cheerful and pleasant. The wait staff was friendly and attentive.
- We'll be back, for its delicious babyback ribs, but won't be going there just fot its happy hour.

5918653,2011-09-22,1,wo5r_5DGI0vSJTKBTxo5Bw,"This is my third or perhaps fourth Tony Roma's restaurants that I have been to around the world. It was way less crowded than the Bangkok location. Lighting seems brighter than the one in Fremont, CA, and I can't recall at all the location(s) of the other chain outposts I have been to.

The menu still have some of the regular old school items, but it has definitely been revamped in the last 6-8 years since I ate at a Tony Roma's. The Steak & Wild Mushroom Flatbread in the appetizer section and the Basil Pesto Mahi Mahi & Vegetable Linguine in the pasta section both look really good, which I have to try next time.

But here's my review on what I ordered for dinner on this visit:

I was craving the Original Back Ribs with the TR's Original BBQ Sauce, which came with cole slaw and I opted for the loaded mashed potato as the other side item.  It came out of the kitchen before I could finished reading a page out of a book I brought with me.  Was told it was because they were slow.  So who knows how long it has been waiting in the kitchen to be served.  The full slab of ribs looks kind of small, it didn't even cover the length of the oval plate, and I knew I would have to order more food.  The flavor was good, but the ribs didn't match my fond memories of it.  Ellis Island's ribs is definitely the way to go for me while I am in Vegas.  (ribs 2.5-3 stars)

Ordered a Chopped Wedge Salad after the ribs arrived, and as simple as it was, it was a highlight of the dining experience (the rice pilaf was the other - crazy! I know).  (4 stars!)

From the Seafood section I ordered the Norwegian Salmon Pan Seared with Sesame Crust and finished with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce. It was served with great rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.  The fish was prepared well, but it would have been better if it was not cooked all the way through.  (3 stars) The best part of this item is your ability to customize your salmon or mahi mahi and the cooking method and finishing options.

Service was friendly, and attentive.  There were only 3 tables my waiter was responsible for, and only 2 at the most were in the restaurant at the same time, so it wasn't hard to check up on the guests and bring refills.

They also have a full bar, but I didn't order anything interesting from them.

Ambiance/Decor: 3/5  Had some pictures and such as wall decoration, the lighting at the booth were fairly bright which I like for taking food pictures, and music playing in the background.  Nice feel but nothing special.

Service:  4/5  Pleasant.

Food:  3/5  Portion is noticeably smaller with the ribs, flavor still the same, but the salad was refreshing and tasty.

Price:  3/5  Comparable to other casual dining competitions, and has options that will meet the needs of those on a modest budget (under $15/person) and others that can slightly splurge a little more.

During lunch they have the 7 for $7 promotion, and their happy hours are from 3pm to 7pm and also from 9pm to close.

Location:  West.  Not at all close to the Strip, so it is for locals.

Parking:  Plenty to select from, as it is in a large strip mall complex with several large national retailers such as Best Buy.

3 stars!  But the ribs will no longer be the reason for my future visits.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,1,3,0sFAy3tueTdZYIywI_87AA
