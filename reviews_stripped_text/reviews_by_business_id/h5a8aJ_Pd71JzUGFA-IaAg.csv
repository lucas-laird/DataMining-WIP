If you are an avid fan of this beverage that is perhaps the one and only compelling reason to visit this little hole-in-the-wall. The inside is dark, and the carpet is dingy. The bathroom... well you get the picture.

While the food is decent, it can't compete with the better restaurants. Their Pad Thai and Pad See-Ew are only okay. They do have a tasty Garlic Short Rib lunch special and a nice Honey Duck dish that you don't often see at other Thai places.

The service is usually warm and eager to please but a bit slow at times. After three or four refills of Thai Iced Tea, the waitress even asked if I wanted a refill to go!

Hey if our table is clean when we set down, our utensils and plate you serve our food in is clean?  I'm good. 

Ever since we left Orange County a few months ago I've been looking for the closest panang curry I could find to what Thai Nakorn served.  This place is the only one so far that has come close!

My Thai BBQ came like it was fried then it was placed on the grill for a little while, then they added some BBQ sauce, reminds me of cafeteria chicken, just worse. There was no grille taste to it. I never BBQed before, but I think I can make a better BBQ chicken then that.  The BBQ chicken came with fried rice. Wait till you read the next part. My pineapple fried rice, it was a reuse of the rice from that came with the BBQ chicken.  Fried rice was basically prepared, they threw in the pineapple, boiled some chicken, mixed it in with the rice.  Then boiled some shrimp and placed it on top of my fried rice. I felt like I was eating the same place from the BBQ chicken. What an experience!  I would not go back there there again.  I had a groupon that I though was supposed to work there.

Every time I go here I wonder how they keep earning that A since the place looks like it can use a serious makeover and thorough cleaning. As I have gotten older I have come to expect restaurants to be cleaner and more refined which this place is not. It reminds me of an old greasy spoon I used to visit in Queens, NY. 

With that said, I come for the food and the service. I have probably eaten here over 100 times in the last 15 years or so and I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal. Their Phad Thai is on par with Archie's and the Spicy beef salad is excellent. Their prices are also very affordable.

The location is strangely ominous; it sits between a smoke shop blaring loud music and an unassuming local bar joint. The interior is nothing short of being appealing, instead of the lively glowing aquarium that LA has,  this Las Vegas branch spells drabness the moment one is ushered in inside i.e. drab lighting, drab decors... and if not for the attentive service, it may have been an altogether drab experience.

A huge salad, with a spicy sweet liquid dressing! So good me and my fiance were trying to pick out the ingredients so we could make it at home! A generous heap of shrimp, and a nice touch of cilantro. A delicious filling lunch or perfect to share as an appetizer.

Pork Thai Jerkey:
Crisp & dry. Obviously jerky like- This wasn't my favorite, but it came with a stellar sauce! See my pictures, it looks exactly how it tastes. Overall, better than most traditional jerky, with that Bbq Thai twist.

For my entree, I enjoyed the shrimp in oyster sauce medium spicy (spiciness coming from strips of green chili). It was good, not an overwhelming portion, which I appreciated. The onions and mushrooms were soft and seasoned nicely as well. 

My fiance ordered their BBQ beef on skewers with a side of fried rice, a cucumber salad, and a peanut dressing which he wasn't too fond of. I liked it a bit more than he did, but something was off there.

The food is probably a little bit better than the yelp rating suggests. I've tried two things here so far: the chicken fried rice and the pepper steak lunch special. The fried rice was decent in terms of flavor with a great amount of volume. The pepper steak was pretty good, but lacking in portion size though it did come with a salad. If I were to come back, I'd avoid the lunch specials since they do not come with as satisfying of a portion size as the entrees.

Papaya Salad- they used bottled lemon juice which is wierd. Left a bad taste.
Chicken BBQ- 4 pieces of dried up chicken and you can tell the chicken was precooked and old.
Pork Rib BBQ dinner- fried rice was sweeter than usual and the ribs again was precooked, you will know by the way the bones are bone dry.
Tom Ka Gai- flavor was good but the chicken was slimy so we stopped eating it. 
Sticky rice - typical, microwaved and the pieces of glass as a treat.

2619353,2015-04-10,15,h5a8aJ_Pd71JzUGFA-IaAg,"This place seems like a total hole in the wall but it's actually a pretty large chain! They have 2 locations in Las Vegas and several locations in California: Cerritos, 2 in LA and Glendale. I was surprised to see that this location isn't thriving like their Cerritos location. The restaurant was empty at 7pm on a Thursday evening, prime dinner time. 

I was craving Thai BBQ chicken so dining here looked promising. Boy, I was not let down! The BBQ chicken marinade was very flavorful. It comes with fried rice which had 2 jumbo prawns and lots of egg bits and they also include their famous sweet and sour sauce which comes in handy for the white parts of the chicken! For $9.95, I was served a generous amount of food - 4 pieces of mix BBQ chicken (wing, leg and 2 thighs), a heaping serving of fried rice, and special sauce. I really enjoyed the chicken plate and would highly recommend ordering this or anything else that is specifically BBQ on the menu. I mean come on, that's their namesake and specialty! Flavor rating: 5/5 

My fiancé ordered the Pad See Ew with beef for $7.50. We thought that the portion size was shockingly small compared to other Thai joints, but the flavor was there. The beef was tender and the broccoli was cooked perfectly with a nice bite. Flavor rating: 4/5

What elevated the Pad See Ew to a delicious level was our special request of thai bird chilies in fish sauce (prik nam pla) - typically you'll see this condiment on the tables of the more legit thai restaurants next to the dried chili, pickled peppers and sugar.  They don't conveniently offer it here, but they were able to whip it up in the back for us and it made the dish pop with so much flavor - super bright and spicy. We loved that sauce! It's probably the best version we have had in a while. Flavor rating: 5/5

This restaurant is a staple for original Thai BBQ and I'm so glad I trusted my gut and cravings on this one.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,15,16,5,BWlQEEHR4_8aOT862_ug-g
2621860,2011-02-27,2,h5a8aJ_Pd71JzUGFA-IaAg,"Meh.  I've experienced better.  I ordered a Thai iced tea ($3.00), the yellow curry with chicken ($8.50), and a beef pad see ew ($7.50).  The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  It was toned down in the sugar department, which is good for some folks, but if you are looking for that sweetness you might be disappointed.  

The yellow curry was pretty bland.  Even ordered hot with extra chili powder, it wasn't anything to rave about in the flavor department.  Apparently they normally make this curry fairly sweet, but I specifically asked for it without extra sugar.  I can imagine this curry with the extra sugar, and it would probably be a typical Americanized curry.  The curry sauce was watery, which I normally like.  The other thing I liked about this curry was that the chicken seemed to be precooked, and was very tender.  Also, the portion of chicken was nicely sized.  There were a couple of thinly sliced peppers though that were pretty skimpy.

I also ordered pad see ew woth beef to go (to go with my Alpha Dog Double Red from Big Dog, yum!).  The noodles were a bit on the overcooked side, although that could have been due to my microwave (I have microwaved pad see ew many times and never had this problem though).  The noodles were a bit on the dry side as far as the sauce used, but that was ok for me.  The kicker was that they don't have Chinese broccoli, so this was served with American broccoli.  

Overall, this place might be good for the lunch specials, but there are so many good Thai places around here.  The service was friendly, but a little slow.  The food was okish.

EDIT: Its been a while since I have thrown out left over Thai food.  The soggy noodles were just gross.  In fact, I have decided to dock Thai BBQ a star.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,6,3,2,_T-4o-6UGu6a0gq58Fv6LQ

differences if you really want to know.  Chicken has some sort of bbq sauce that is not the norm.  Original is like a marinade that grills clean and this is like a thick sauce that adds a layer to the chicken.  not exactly my fave.

Rice is not as good and color is the same but taste is not on par.  But the rice seems to be a little different at all locations. 

Overall it was a decent meal and if i have to have it, then there it is.

Cucumber salad was great - but how do you mess up cucumbers, jalapenos, red onions and rice vinegar?  The Larb was terrible.  The chicken was undercooked, it had some grain on it that should have been cooked but wasn't, so it was like taking a bite of sand.  I gagged on it.  $9.00 in the trash can.  The mint chicken was flavorful and thankfully, generous sized portion so we could both eat.  Neither of us are dark meat chicken fans, however, and this was exclusively thigh meat.

My boyfriend ALWAYS orders spring rolls and their BBQ chicken dinner.  Its red.  Its tasty. And sweet. And comes with a side of Shrimp Fried Rice.

I like to try different things.

Their pad thai is what you expect pad thai to be.  Noodles. Spicy. Sweet. Yummy with a squeeze of lime.  I can never finish an order in one sitting...but that can partly be blamed on our habit of ordering too much food at once.

They have a nice lunch menu.  I think I've tried their short ribs in black bean or black pepper sauce... the name escapes me but  I remember it being good.

Their chicken curry doesnt spark any fond memories for me.  It doesnt bring up any bad ones, either.

I think their best dish (or my personal favorite) is the beef curry.  The meat is soooo tender and just a little fatty.  The sauce is spicy and rich and creamy.  And its a nice portion; all beef, no veg.  In my opinion, the best BEEF curry ever.",ahj9FxM6MQBU501LGypcCQ,0,0,4,A2BoYJVcIuCrScyPNQsUiA

This restaurant is in a small shopping center, and is the sole non-California Thai BBQ. Inside, a Christmas tree greeted us, and holiday music played. There was enough space to handle a light crowd, yet it wasn't crowded. (It was Friday but I guess their dining room thins out around 1 o'clock?)

Our server waited patiently for my cousin to finish a call (checking in every so often) before taking our orders. When I couldn't decide between the mint chicken or moo pad prigking, he convinced me to get the latter.

My entree's grounded up chicken was the perfect texture, aromatic, and piping hot, and the mint was a nice touch. The chili wasn't as peppery as I preferred, a problem easily solved by the liberal application of table spices. I worried that I was given too much rice, but was proven wrong by the end of the meal. It's not uber-authentic burn-your-colon Thai, but it's perfectly acceptable for lunch.

The outside appearance, wedged in a small strip mall between a smoke shop and mini casino (as are so many Vegas secrets) may be unassuming, but good food is delivered steaming hot and the welcome is very genuine.
We were served very quickly and staff were appropriately attentive. We really like the chicken pad thai, barbecued pork with rice, and delicious tender satays of chicken. I like that in addition to sweet sodas or teas, I could have regular fresh brewed iced tea. My portion was large enough to be my lunch today.

It looks like a total hole in the wall, but their food is amazing!  Not exactly in the best location either, but I'll travel to come here.

They have great lunch specials for under $7.  Their portions are smaller than the dinner portions, but the small portions are still filling.  I like to get the L-3, which is the sauteed beef on a skewer with peanut sauce on the side and shrimp fried rice.

The shrimp fried rice is amazing, especially since the shrimp is huge (they may/may not be prawns just be looking at their size).  Also, ask for the sweet orange sauce.  It's not exactly sweet and sour sauce..it's more of a sweet sauce and I haven't seen any other Thai restaurants carry this sauce.  Just add a few drizzles of this sweet sauce on your shrimp fried rice.

Tom Yum Goong (sp) comes in a cute presentation with the flame.  Other than the cute presentation, it's full of flavor with plenty of shrimp and mushrooms.

Our food took approximately 45 minutes to be served to us. We thought they were still trying to catch, kill, and cook the chicken somewhere in the back. 

Prior to that, we ordered 2 Thai iced teas and 2 waters when we first sat down. The waiter brought 2 Thai iced teas and 1 water with 2 straws. I pulled up Yelp and found a check-in deal for a free Thai iced tea and asked if I could use it, showed him the coupon on my phone, and he said yes. So I assumed that meant they would just count the one just served to me as free. But instead, he brought me another Thai iced tea. Silly me...

Cut to the food. My fried rice was nice and hot, yet my chicken was room temperature, borderline cold. If there's anything that grosses me out is chicken that feels like it's been sitting out. My fiance's fried rice was nice and hot. Funny thing is when the waitress brought our food, she apologized for the delay and said it was due to not having bean sprouts. What bean sprouts? There were no bean sprouts in the fried rice.

Lastly, this restaurant looks, feels and smells like a dark moldy basement. There are no windows in the main dining area, the tables are sticky, the floors in the bathroom are sticky....all around just dirty and gross.

Good enough for one person to endulge on and then have some left to take home. The lunch special ranges from $6.25 to $6.95 and goes on Monday-Friday from 11:00 am to 3:00pm. After that the prices jack up to like $10-20 a plate. 

Many places don't serve fresh thai tea, and this place not only serves fresh thai tea but it's refillable! Don't ever expect it to be one from a can! The tastes is rich, smooth, and soft like really light milk. 

I usually run back and forth with the BBQ ribs or the chicken. I personally like the chicken because its healthier. The marinate is amazing! Everytime I eat there I always wonder how they keep the flavor so rich and full on the chicken! The fried rice is a huge portion, and you can expect the chicken and rice ratio to be very fair and generous when you eat (Everyone knows about the ratio! The rice HAS to equal the right amount of entree in every bite until the end of your meal. If not, it'll be a disaster!).

It comes with a side salad which is really just lettuce and two pieces of tomato, but their sesame dressing on it is to die for! So contents, or more so missing contents, of the salad doesn't matter, especially since it's a side salad anyway.

Other items to try, is the Naked Shrip Salad which a favorite. The crab ragoons, and the shrimp pad thai. Good luck! Hope you enjoy your experience!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,0,1,4,-KdMe2ONMJ78rJPzmUlnuQ

Service was fine but I was a little disappointed in the meal. The beef was overdone and tough. The main vegtable is broccoli and it was underdone and tough.

4435921,2008-04-29,0,h5a8aJ_Pd71JzUGFA-IaAg,"i rarely ever will speak bad about Original Thai BBQ, but this is an exception.  I guess i was spoiled by the Thai BBQ places in CA.  Trying this chain restaurant out of state was something i will not do again.

First of all the prices.  Over in CA, all specials cost at between 8 - 12 dollars, with the more popular options being below 10.  Well, over here, only the BBQ chicken was $8.95 and everything else was priced $10.95 and above.  Ok so i thought that there must be something more special about this place - huge portions of their cucumber salad, refills on sauce, etc, but their portions were unimpressive...which brings me to my next point. 

The portions were small.  Usually, im accustomed to seeing mounds of rice spread out all over my oval shaped plate.  But when our food came, imagine 6 adult faces staring at each other with a hidden WTF? face.  of course, we didnt want to make it obvious in front of our servers.  Rice was pre molded in like a bowl shape.  Presentation was nice but we came for the food. And usually, the Sate sticks are maybe 3 finger lengths long, but over here, it was 2.  

The inside was ok.  Not the best of places, but not the worst of places either.  There were alot of couples there, i think about 2 of them, 2 couples i mean, weere making out in booths - definitely NOT a family friendly environment. 

i will say that the food pretty much tastes the same.  No watered down sauces here, thats for sure.  Service was great.  And they also give out free refills of Thai Iced Tea!  thats a first, and at only $2.50, its a pretty good deal.  

anyways, ok so i had to give it three stars due to its overall package  Sorry i had to complain about this place, but come over here to CA Thai BBQ's  and youll see what i mean...",ZMp-I7Jm9LpnCErn9TbjiQ,1,0,3,CL6Ns-yzY21073lL7CF85g

The reason why I like it so much is because they have combo plates and they have bottomless Thai Iced tea. I hate ordering ala carte . I think if I order meat rice should come with it ..I just hate being nickle and dimed for everything. Whenever I eat here my Thai Tea never goes empty. Which 
I deeply appreciate after the service that I received at Basil n Lime the prior night. I'd much rather eat here even though it's not the fanciest place in town. They did upgrade their chairs from last time though ...looks much better! 

I started off with Tom Kar Kai ( Spicy Chicken Coconut Soup). It had chicken with coconut and mushrooms in a hot and sour soup with a touch of lemon grass. It was really good and it also got rid of my sore throat! Then I had their Sa-Te dinner combo which was served with cucumber salad, beef skewers, and shrimp fried rice. It was very tasty and the beef was tender. 

My husband had a side of their Cucumber salad because he can't eat Thai food two times in a row. (We had to stop at Burger King for him before we came here.) I felt abnormal as he watched me eat but I'm sorry I needed my Thai fix satisfied! 

I like this Thai BBQ the best because I tried this other Thai BBQ on Flamingo but they didn't offer the bottomless Thai Tea. I'd rather drive further down the road to eat here!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,2,5,Z-cuRxz8NDrEWdT2DONmMg

I used to frequent this corner almost every day after work, and it's nice to see that the lunch specials and the holes in some of the upholstery remain exactly as I remember. Does anyone know how long this place has been around, really? Everyone I've gone with has varying accounts, ranging from a couple years to a decade. 

Yesterday afternoon I was getting the mid-afternoon lags yet had an irrepressible urge to go bowling. Met up with the group at the bowling alley and suggested we head down the street. Sure enough, everything was familiar and the nonstop Thai Tea gave all of us a major sugar rush. I swear, that stuff is badass. I mean, I'm a pretty laid back individual but when I've had almost a full pitcher together with my Satay (Spelled ""Sate"", pronouce it like ""Gate,"" trust me, they LOVE it when you do that) and Angel Wings (Stuffed chicken wing; like a Bicep on roids), I'm practically one of those radio announcers tryingtosayallthe fineprintintheadbeforethe30-secondtimelimitrunsoutforlegalpurposes.

It's a reliable spot for lunch, since they offer lunch specials for around $7.  Lunch specials do not include any noodle dishes like pad thai or pad see ew, but can still be ordered off of the regular menu for a decent price. 

The chicken or beef satay lunch special comes with 3 sticks of protein of your choice, fried rice, peanut sauce, and cucumber salad. Pretty good portion, left content. Next time, I'll have to read the fine print. Most other Thai places include a soup and egg roll. Our lunch specials did not come with these. 

It's been awhile since I've had it, but get the BBQ chicken, it's their signature dish. A few places in town try to replicate it, but it's not as good.

Like it doesn't say anything about dine-In only to receive free Thai ice tea. The place seemed very dead tonight. Not sure if it's like this all the time. Defiantly not like 3rd st. Not sure if I'll be coming back.,qr_6z5Ov4T_NsiYcYFkrOQ,0,0,3,k-wgUKWCUGsnlon29hT97g

We've tried a lot more since, but every once in a while we find our way back here.  There is only a couple of tables occupied, and service is always great and today was no exception, our order was taken and our drinks brought out.

Within a matter of minutes our food began to arrive, I got the ruby chicken, deep fried, stuffed served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, mixed with red peppers, onion and pineapple pieces.   And it comes with fried rice with shrimp.

My husband got the beef sa-te with peanut dipping sauce and we split them both.  We also shared pad thai noddles.  The food was fresh, just enough spice and served pipping hot",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,82qOCQX66Dm6SZRZq7cdIA

5606364,2013-08-04,0,h5a8aJ_Pd71JzUGFA-IaAg,"Visiting the Vegas Strip can prove to be a financial burden for anyone who has to be on a budget. So my friend and I decided to check this place out. Arriving there at 3:00 p.m., we found ourselves amongst a handful of people there at this particular Thai Original BBQ Restaurant location. Really, nothing special when you look from the outside. A small sign in the front is the only indication it MIGHT be a Thai restaurant. But coming in, the smell of this establishment told us it was definitely not going to be bad. We were seated right away. My only complaint might be the lack of any windows. The interior, itself, was dark and dank. We were brought to our seats immediately. The menu was, of course, full of the traditional Thai meals one would expect. But ordering their famous barbecue half-chicken, let's just say it was a flavor explosion- cooked to perfection and basted just right (without the sauce being overwhelming)- and spicy, leaving a nice heat on the palate long after consumption. My friend had the chicken skewers and rice, with peanut sauce as condiment. The thing that also made the experience of note was the speed in which our meals were done (10 minutes from order). No, it didn't feel rushed (yet, it was perhaps the fact we had come in during a not-so-busy time). But the service was nevertheless prompt and attentive, and our waiter always came over to give us refills on our drink as well as to ask us if we were enjoying our meals. Please take into account again that we came at perhaps the best possible time. But if you like Thai food with prompt service, and want to avoid spending exorbitant prices that are typical at the Strip, you ought to consider taking a 10 minute trip outside of it and check out this unassuming-looking spot to satisfy your palate. It's worth it.",PqHVGtlC4coWbFAyaARahQ,0,0,4,rolIixlVPVpBGj9Im79YSQ

We ordered the small combination soup and two sa-te beef dinners. I had the Thai Iced Tea, and my hubby a coke (can). The combination soup came out first. The chicken and pork tasted days old. The mushrooms were questionable, as if they were about to go bad. Then our sa-te beef dinners. The rice was old and greasy. It lacked any flavor. The beef was tough. Some pieces were cooked medium and others rare! 

On a positive note, my Thai Iced Tea has refills. My husbands coke didn't. They're canned. :/
