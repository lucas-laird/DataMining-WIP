566119,2015-10-09,3,bM-rAr7gxsxxjD-FlRcIJA,"My friends and I were looking for a new place to have fun and sing some karaoke. This is NOT the place. The KJ's are not even real DJ/KJ's, so the music and singers sound horrible. Plus, the karaoke songs they have are really bad versions -- you know, the unprofessional synthesizer kind of versions. The location is kind of scary as well. It's a dark, run-down area which hasn't quite been developed yet. Food was fair, but took a long time to come out. DJ's don't have a clue what to play, or how to adjust things. Maybe a good place for trashy-karaoke singing.",5Asin3t5827GVSgc6ECD0w,2,1,1,Q4CDdb-Z0Mr-LP2Isb04Gg

We have gotten Filipino food in quantity for parties at other places before but this was the best tasting and the best value.  We got 3 big ""full"" size pans for $272 and it was a lot of food...  One of them was Beef Kaldereta that other places want to charge you more for(understandable because of the amount of beef)...  We also got Vegetable Chop Suey and Pork Sisig which is probably the best this American guy has ever had....

2619351,2015-08-19,41,bM-rAr7gxsxxjD-FlRcIJA,"We actually came here since Café de Cebu down the street ran out of Lechon Kawali (Filipino style fried crispy pork belly.) How dare they, right?! Our friend (Jeff V.) wanted to take us on a Filipino food tour and since Café de Cebu couldn't deliver - we gave this place a shot! It's an added bonus that they are open from 3PM until 4AM and serve food throughout their business hours - perfect for all of those late nights and early Vegas mornings.

A family-run business; they quickly helped us feel right at home. Still basking in their grand opening a month ago, the waitress Crystal and owner Rocky were full of personality and really sweet. The ambiance here is like your typical legit Filipino spot - casual, dimly-lit and homey; almost like you're dining in someone's home but fitted with: hip music (top 40/EDM/Filipino hits), a dance floor, strobe lights and a full wall projector with speakers for all of your entertainment, dancing and Karaoke needs. Unfortunately no one in my party had the guts to sing, so we went straight to business and ordered a slew of authentic goodies!

Lechon Kawali (Filipino style fried crispy pork belly) $11 - This dish always seems to run out at great Filipino joints, so get it while you can! We ended up ordering 2 rounds! My whole party enjoyed the roasted, deep fried, extra crispy fried pig belly (it was slightly overcooked, so a little dry) but their house made vinegar sauce took this dish to another level! It helped add some moisture back to the pork belly and you will want to dip everything in that sauce! 4/5

Original Pork Sisig (Deep fried pork belly chopped with onions and jalapeno) $13 - Served on a sizzling platter, this dish stayed piping hot and delicious! I enjoyed the subtle acid of the vinegar which created a nice layer of flavor and the texture of the pork belly was extra crispy! I also liked the flavor that the jalapeno added to the dish! 5/5

""Wet Pussy"" Creamy Garlic Mussels (Green half shell green mussels baked with garlic and cream, served on a sizzling platter.) $12 - It's pretty sad when none of your friends believe you when you tell them - that's the actual name of the dish written on the menu! LOL! Guys. I'm for real not making it up. We ended up having a lot of fun with it in restaurant though. :p It was bubbling hot, super creamy and garlicky! It's a nice variation of the classic Japanese version of baked mussels that most of us are use to. My party inhaled it even though we were all stuffed! 4/5

Bihon Guisado Con Lechon (Bihon noodles stir-fried with garlic, vegetables, shrimp and lechon kawali (fried pork belly) $11 - This is my first time having Bihon noodles and it wasn't bad! Jeff V. really liked it and gave it his thumbs up. I honestly prefer the clear ""Pancit"" type of noodles - but the flavor of this dish was good. 3/5

Garlic Fried Rice (Jasmine rice fried with garlic and egg bits) $8 - The rice was lightly aromatic, but super moist. My party enjoyed eating the rice with the lechon kawali - great combination! Only a minor complaint is that I wish the garlic bits were fried a little more brown to offer more garlic flavor and it could definitely use more egg! 3/5

We ended the evening with Halo Halo (traditional Filipino style dessert) $5 - Their version is not like a traditional halo halo topped with ice cream. It's served in a clear plastic cup and topped high so it was slightly difficult to get to the goods down below. Also my party all agreed that there was far too much ice; it was hard to enjoy the sweet flavor and texture of the toppings and we sure missed a nice scoop of creamy ice cream on top! 2/5

You bet we stuffed our bellies to the max and we'll be back soon! The environment is a great spot to bring all of your foodie adventurers to dine family-style, sing, dance and laugh the night away!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,47,49,4,p_EEOlLKHk1skkB7JtqFLQ

2759538,2018-05-22,9,bM-rAr7gxsxxjD-FlRcIJA,"I have one word to describe my experience. WEIRD.

For those that want to know, ""Tambayan"" in english means a place to hang out where you can eat and just relax.

So me and my party of 7 show up a little after 9 pm on tuesday 5/15/18. Found the door to be locked. As we all talked about going to the Thai Bbq place next door, all of a sudden, some dude opens up the door and motions for us to come in. We all give each other a puzzled look and went on in. Now if it was only a few of us I would have hesitated and probably would have said, ""No thanks!"". Since we were a big group we decided to go for it since we all wanted to see if the pork sisig was good based on the pic we saw.

So we sit down and are given menus by the same guy that opened the door. He said that our server was gonna be here soon. A few minutes later, some lady shows up from the outside and takes our order. Come to find out that the guy that opened the door and sat us was also the cook.

So we order Pork Sisig, Fish Balls, and Lechoh Kawali. 

The Pork Sisig($13) came out on its traditional sizziling platter. It was made up of pork, onions, garlic, and topped off with a slice of lemon to squeeze on. Was sorely disappointed in this dish. The good kind of pork sisig that I am used to also has chopped jalapenos and should have a freshly cracked egg on top of it for you to mix in while the meat is still sizzling. Overall taste was just ok. Did not meet my expectations and it seemed to be overpriced to me.

The Fish Balls($8.00) were also not he kind that im used to. These are deep fried and soft and chewy with nothing in the middle. These ones we got were stuffed with some kind of meat that I could not recognize. I only ended up eating just one ball. At least the pickled cucumber dressing it came with gave it some life but this dish was not to my liking.

The Lechon Kawali($12.00) was probably the only thing decent that we had. Its basically sliced pork belly deep fried until crispy. Comes with a sauce to dip in (Mang Tomas for all you true Flip food connoisseurs). In this case they gave us a sauce that they said they made in house. It was just ok.

For dessert we wanted to order halo-halo but they said they didnt have all the ingredients so we ended up just getting Turon($5.00). It is plantain sprinkled with brown sugar with lanka (jackfruit) placed on top and then rolled up in an eggroll wrapper then deep fried until crispy. It was just ok.

I almost forgot to mention that when we got our food, another random dude appeared out of nowhere and started singing karaoke. So what got was dinner AND a show. Dude that sang was decent. Sang everything from Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" to Josh Turner's ""Your Man"". 

So overall, even though the whole thing seemed weird, I thought it was just ok. Given the facts that the place seemed kind of shady and their hours are not accurate, I dont think I will be coming back here. Plus I have had better sisig from at least 3 other places. Hit me up if you want to know those places.

Open until 4, with plenty of space for our large party of 12+, I can't stop raving about how great this joint was.

We had pork sisig, chicken and shrimp pancit, lechon kawali, pork sinigang, and enough drinks all around to put down an elephant. Hands down, one of the best Filipino dining experiences I've ever had. It felt like I was visiting someone's family home, and the owner made us all feel very welcome.

Karaoke and the dance floor were the highlight of the evening, with a DJ who could find whatever you asked him for, performing slick sound engineering on the sly. Everyone in the party felt like superstars!

I walked in and there were no real customers. It looked liked family, friends and tsismis. There were no actual restaurant things happening. No one was being served food - including me.

I told them I was here for pickup. Then it was a bunch of nothing. It almost seemed like they had no idea I even placed an order. I stood around a bit thinking that the guy that just went into the back was going to come out with my food. Nope.

I sat down and waited. And waited. Nothing.

At one point, I was told that the delay was because of a health inspection earlier in the day. Okay, what? Obvious lie. Even if that was the case, how does that impact the non-existent dinner service? I was a bit embarrassed for the lady that said this.

I ended up waiting more than 30 minutes before leaving. That was plenty of time to overcook a tortang talong and some chicken wings. Hell, they could've overcooked it twice.

That's how this establishment serves the Vegas food scene.

Las Vegas brings the best in everything, including food. 
There are tons of diverse restaurants serving dishes from every part of the world - including the Philippines. Las Vegas has a vibrant & growing Filipino community, and if you're a foodie, some of the best Filipino food can be found in Las Vegas - in particular, at Carding's Tambayan.

Known for their karaoke/open mic nights & a dance floor with a DJ/live band, Carding's Tambayan delivers delicious Filipino food from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day! - its location is off the Strip (it's just about a $10 Uber ride - 10-15 min. away from where you're staying along the Strip), but it's a destination for foodies & adventurers alike! Highly recommended to think outside the box (or Strip) & see for yourselves to get some grub that's way better & way cheaper than the food places along the Strip!

Among their most well-liked plates are the original Pork Sisig - deep-fried pork belly mixed with onions and jalapeno, and the Balls Platter -comprised of deep fried squid, deep fried shrimp, deep friend chicken balls, kikiam, which is deep-fried ground pork and vegetables. Their take on the Lumpiang Shanghai (Deep-Fried Filipino Egg Rolls) is HELLA GOOD that it can cure a hangover AND satisfy your cravings. However, I've heard that their Bangus Sisig is to-die for! Too bad they ran out of it when we visited for some late night munchies! 

One of their specialties that's ordered on a regular basis, is their Tapsilog.
While the entire word Tapsilog is known as an ordinary word in Filipino, broken apart, each syllable actually stands for something else. Per tapsiloganusa.com, ""TAP comes from TAPA, which is cured beef usually marinated with salt, vinegar, soy sauce and pepper. SI comes from SINANGAG which is Filipino fried rice, made with white rice, garlic, salt and pepper. LOG comes from the word ITLOG meaning EGG. Served and cooked at any style."" 

This restaurant not only serves delicious Filipino food, but also offers a comfortable homely feel - the owners care for you & chop it up with you like they know you really well. It is perfect for a casual outing with the family and friends; even a place for an ""after party"" after clubbing/nightlife on the Strip!",NB7rfbs2A_GwSQZKeE96Iw,1,3,5,hJ9aVvYcxStcYw_Sk7BOBg

AND they stay open until 4pm or later in the morning (perfect for after hours from the Vegas club life).",nY9FUScv1oLEo-XNjOcr4g,2,1,5,oEfY3W3UPppGZswlUtrnkg

There was a private party being held in the restaurant but the owners still opened their doors to us. They were having karaoke and so the place was quite loud. We didn't mind it at all because the atmosphere was festive and lively. We ordered lumpiang shanghai, lechon kawali and pork sisig. Our server even gave us a big bowl of complimentary white rice with our dinner. The food was all very delicious and authentic! My favorite was the lechon kawali which was super crispy and juicy. My partner-in-dine preferred the pork sisig. We were so stuffed that we had to take some of the food home. They also serve Philippine beer. And even with the party going on, the food came out quickly. Authentic and tasty Filipino dishes at reasonable prices! Wish I could come here every day.",ElEUh1-Ux6npfDs56sGPSw,1,1,5,pTHCS9E_aly9K1PC6-GXYg

Food wise, we ordered: bulalo, sisig, and fried shrimp. Everything was good. My little girl had about 6 small rice bowl with the bulalo. It was that good. Food pricing was reasonable as well. We will definitely come back.",4YG3CmhBFYajaxa1L2mIRA,0,0,4,Xi4VIyIg22h_QNQEI0RVFg
