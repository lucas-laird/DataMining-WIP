I had the kalua pig and chicken long rice the food was perfect, not dry like at some other places. I reccomend anyone to give this place a try.",1iOkH8b7bmBDBj7gRqZ1Tw,3,1,5,PSSbveNdp_GJT9M9vUQL3w

I had the Beef Curry and my BF had the Laulau plate and Squid Luau!! So yummy!! Not only the food was good, but the people and atmosphere was perfect!! Very friendly and professional! We dined in and I observed the owner greet everyone single person that walked in by their name :) For me, that is a BIG PLUS!! It's as if you are walking into a family house! Thank you Kau Kau Kitchen, you have gained 2 more loyal customers!",0Ev3k-MK18TfhPo9TpyL2w,1,1,5,Kc--tKa7nt8hYFhJYxq-hA
1456755,2018-06-03,0,DFrNSuSMr6sHLvtpj0v7qA,This place should open earlier to serve Breakfast instead of opening at 11. The prices are a little high and the food you get is small in portion. Would rather go to 808,qRXK8hFFRkHJWrLazALRIA,0,0,1,x0VVQCeWGhpiZk4d3uY8vA

I have to say, this place is what my hubs and I have been searching for since we moved away from Hawaii. The pricing and portions are great. But most of all, the food makes you feel like you've been invited over to someone's house for a home cooked Hawaiian meal. Aunty in the back (the talented chef) even popped her head out to ask us how we wanted our eggs done for our loco moco. Great food. Great Vibes. Great Aloha. Baba B even appeared and came around to ""talk story"" with us and other customers enjoying the wonderful food. This place is the real deal!",2FdN8fV5CSUsYg7WfW8jbg,1,1,5,Cxoq5-G4ll4i-cIYBk03uw

The kalua pig eas okay... we also ordered a reg order of noodles that was just ok... my bf ordered the squid luau and that was basically the on thing we really liked their so disappointing.   Also, the lady she did not even come around and see if we needed anything or how the food is instead she was talking stories  to these other ppl instead..  no customer service their.  First and the last for us.",x-RwiZYzACG-Ak4EMyvn5g,1,0,1,JeiitO9z6l68tMi4Ede-EA

They offer some goodies like the candies and snacks we enjoy back home and a couple of specialty drinks like the blue vanilla you get from the Manapua man.  
I got the kalua pig plate and a side of the squid luau.  First impression everything looks ono.  The squid luau looked a little liquidy.  So I dug in!
The kalua pig was a little dry but the flavor wasn't bad.  The squid luau was watery just as it looked.  Was a little disappointed with that.  
The lady at the register was really nice and gave that feeling of home that's the reason for the three stars.  The food maybe like a 2 star but the customer service made it 3 stars.",iF5FuC-6n618DMkg1PaXkQ,0,0,3,BtRUTmuUNmMmvvUap-mrKg
3223874,2018-04-13,2,DFrNSuSMr6sHLvtpj0v7qA,"I just moved back in town after being gone for several years. I was excited to try this place after reading all about it on Facebook. Friends from Hawaii made posts about it as well because they knew the owner.  I couldn't wait to try this place.  This is a new Hawaiian restaurant that is in the place where House of Aloha. If I am not mistaken they may be the same business. From what I was told or remember reading the two owners of House of Aloha had a falling out and split into 2 businesses.

The first time I swung by this place, they were closed. I thought that they would be open since they served breakfast. They open at 1100. My fault, I should of checked. It's weird that they sell breakfast but open around lunch time.  I decided to come back a couple days later to try it out. I got the meat jun and short rib combo.  Came out to $14.00!!!!!! Holy crap batman! Way more expensive than Hawaii.  I was not pleased about that.  Meat Jun has no flavor and I have no clue what kind of sauce came with it.  Meat Jun was paper thin and gross.  Short ribs was on the thick side. Tons of fat on some pieces.  The Kalbi had flavor to it and it is the only reason why I gave 2 stars.  Staff was friendly, but I am sorry to say I will only visit this place once in a blue moon. One for the lack of flavor in the meat jun and the other because of the price. Highway robbery.",lgxCqDMnowyx1Q5fLdLPCA,6,4,2,tXo6Q4xKTSeMfNHtf2OgCA

4945601,2018-05-28,0,DFrNSuSMr6sHLvtpj0v7qA,I LOVE the food here. My most favorite dishes were the garlic chicken and shoyu poke. I just went there yesterday and want to come back for more already. The chicken katsu is juicy and way better than L&L's!! The customer service is excellent! I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back!,V5IVXj2DYoxTLhJW4wrqXA,0,0,5,_ZeAJRpro74r6thANQe4Kw

This place didnt disappoint.  The garlic chicken was great, not overbearing just great.  Their mac salad is one of the best along with their bbq beef.  Just like a steak, lean with not alot of extra fat or grizzle,  Awesome.  Their menu is extensive and we have many other things we still need to try.

5367365,2018-04-03,1,DFrNSuSMr6sHLvtpj0v7qA,"New Hawaiian restaurant that replaced the former House of Aloha. The location just opened yesterday so it still looks similar to the setup of the restaurant it replaced. There was someone measuring things around the restaurant so I'm sure there will be some renovations coming. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by staff and even Baba B himself was hanging out. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. 

We ordered a mini teri beef plate and a mini garlic chicken plate. Each came with a side of Mac salad, too. The teri beef was delicious! The beef was tender, juicy, and both sweet and savory. The garlic chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The garlic sauce, served on the side, was the perfect accompaniment to the crispy chicken. Everything came out piping hot and pretty quickly. The portions were generous, too. The Mac salad was good, but could use a touch more seasoning. For dessert, we ordered the banana cream pie. It was light and creamy, with plenty of bananas and filling. So comforting and a great way to end the meal. 

The staff informed us that the official grand opening will be on April 28. There are tons of items on their menu so I'm sure we'll be back on the 28th...and plenty more times after that.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,7,3,4,oem_ijtfRSNgEh4D9L-T5w
