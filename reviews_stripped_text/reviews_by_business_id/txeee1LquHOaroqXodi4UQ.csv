Yanary M, served us today, and her attitude was absolutely disgusting and customer service, piss poor.

1433077,2015-08-12,4,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,"I came for the hot-n-ready pepperoni pizza. There isn't much more to say. You get what you pay for and it's a $5 pizza. So there isn't much to expect. The service was quick since the pizza was sitting in a box in the heater. 

The store was pretty small and could be a little more cleaner. I'm glad this location is near the UNLV campus for whoever's ballin' on a college student budget this would be your reality lunch or dinner. 

Although I'd have to say that this Little Caesar's is kinda sketchy especially at night. Whenever I go when it's dark, I always see random bums asking for money or on the sidewalk near the entrance. So just be cautious. 

The pizza can be pepperoni or cheese, whichever you like. They usually have both flavors available till 10pm. The quality? Well let's just say you and I could have better but are willing to accept it because it's only $5! Lol",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,2,2,1,SgcXorWSaMqQvDsIuG-bRw
1502048,2010-12-19,0,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,"It is what is is!  $5 carry out pizza on demand, no need to call ahead.  Of course the crust is a little cardboardy and not soft and doughy, but they don't skimp on the cheese or toppings.  Never going to be as great as a premium parlor's pizza, but for $5 you can't go wrong.",jmM_nn2kK6CnYenMz7wmHw,0,0,3,RuiYzSIcMbp-wOVv4l4ttA
1555766,2017-06-07,1,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,False advertising. Nothing hot or ready. Me and 6 others told to wait 10 mins. Then after 10 mins nothing ready still.,ZPaMNOsSNtOHXE1ZN6PvCw,0,1,1,wHCDkukngpPcELQ0VxKEMQ
1867282,2017-04-13,0,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,Most disgusting experience ever. There was a really long hair in my hot wings. I took one bite and felt the hair pulled it out and felt it as it was coming out my throat!!! Yuck. Called them about it all they said is bring back the wings and your receipt and we'll give you your money back like it was no big deal..Yeah right like I'm gonna drive back just to get $6 back not even worth the traffic and gas. Im staying at Planet Hollywood and I just thought I would write a review so people could be warned. Wish I had seen the reviews before going there.,fPKKZhRQO1oMznuwXCwW7w,0,0,1,m_g-yuXS-LIMTJYswjPbnw

Then I called and the girl on the phone says they can give me one more fresh one...but wouldn't refund my money....I told then during my order that I was getting this for a pregnant lady....do you think I can come home to a pregnant lady with the order not right...what a half ass pizza parlor....such a shame I couldnt even get hot bread for this pregnant lady...how dare these people.,cGVkX9DfKhPxwVJVTLrmHQ,0,0,1,Hcf9GqPde1BLO9gPCtg_yg
2361395,2017-06-29,0,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,Pizza was good but Service was slow and rude. They had everyone else's pizza ready but I had to wait 15-20 mins for a deep dish. Someone came and gone with the same exact order before mine. Gave excuses of short staff but couldn't give an estimated time on my order.,6WX1z38WV8s0P2qzF5zx7w,0,0,2,zCJyadObDDBZBvdzaVW0pw
3000225,2017-09-15,0,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,"It was ACTUALLY HOT AND READY!!!!!! ""3 star pizza, 5 star service, that's all that matters"" as my boyfriend said. Anyways, my family actually likes Little Caesar's pizza, it's not bad. I'm not a big fan of the sauce, but the crust is good and I love their crazy bread. This location is really small but I didn't have to wait for two pepperoni pizzas and that's pretty much unheard of at Little Caesers. So, it was a pretty good experience. Now I gotta go eat my pizza!!!",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,0,0,3,b4rm-SeHMqsa7LQBlTg_5A
4063014,2018-01-04,14,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,"A good option if you want a cheap and quick meal, but service here is a bit on the slow side. 

This location seems always so busy, but it was the closest location to where I used to live in Vegas so I'd come here whenever I wanted something quick. There was always a line if you came during lunch or dinner times and the workers never seemed able to keep up with the demand on the ""hot & ready"" pizzas. People would be complaining about how they didn't have any pizzas ready and how they had to wait around for something they pay $5 for..come on people! This is not a fancy pizza parlor and I do understand you come here to get something cheap and quick, but so do everyone else and I'm sure the workers are working as hard as they can to keep up with your pizza orders. 

I normally wouldn't do the hot and ready option as I love their veggie pizza. I would order and have to wait around 15-20 minutes, so I'd go to the grocery store next door to pass time. After making my rounds in the grocery store, my pizza would be done. 

For someone that isn't a huge pizza fan, I think that Little Caesar is a great option for me. I love how they cook the crust, not too crispy or too soft and doughy. They put a good amount of cheese and veggies on my pizza and are more than happy to customize it as well, like adding extra mushrooms or not putting peppers on it. 

My only advice for this place would be to make sure you keep those shelves full of hot and ready pizza as people normally come in for them and don't want to have to wait around for something.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,27,25,4,Lsf1pem8p4xBsrf464SP2g
4122724,2014-09-25,0,txeee1LquHOaroqXodi4UQ,"ok so this is the BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN ALL OF VEGAS!  Plus the ICB, or Italian Cheese Bread is the CHEESIEST CHEESY BREAD IN ALL OF VEGAS with a kick, some amazing spices on it

The rest is just your average pizza,  I could use a lil extra cheese on their normal pizza, I prefer extra cheesy than more saucy..  but the pizzas are fresh and fast and CHEAP!  Plus good taste is a good thing and they have amazing taste :)  

The staff at this location are the BEST as well - love them :)  Thanks guys,

The experience from start to finish cannot be described in one yelp review.... the staff took customer service to a whole new level, the cheese was so aged to perfection that the whole family melted with this buffet of flavors surrounding our taste buds. The sauce reminded me of an early Tuscan sunrise the warm robust flavor took me to heights I've never experienced before. The crust oh man that crust the buttery, flaky, soft, but with a rough doughy exterior left me screaming for more and the best part about it all THE PRICE... 5$ plus tax for A PIZZA never have I ever been more satisfied with a fine dining experience in my entire life. 10/10 will definitely be returning for another slice of heaven!!!!",Xx3jMEsLm9p3WRLIh98Org,0,0,5,PhExWrG-z3rLG4WK0z14KQ

Then the customer behind me ordered it. I was on my lunch it took forever .
