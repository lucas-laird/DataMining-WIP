554668,2017-08-08,0,Q2pyp7Nb3cD4Br2BOnxUDA,"I write this from a bathroom at Albertsons, reflecting on the life choices that have brought me to this location. It all started when I decided to get lunch from this food truck. As a fan of Greek food, I was so excited at the prospect of enjoying a chicken kabob lunch that I didn't mind standing in line under the grueling Las Vegas sun for 15 minutes to place my order. However, when it was time to place said order, I was informed that my savory kabob dish was no longer available. Saddened, but not deterred, I ordered a rice bowl instead.  By the time I got my order 30 minutes later, my soul was discouraged and my skin was slightly darkened but I still clung to hope at the prospect of a good meal. The rice bowl itself was quite tasty and flavorful with chicken, rice, tomatoes, onions, and feta cheese. Tons of feta cheese. I almost thought it had been worth the 45 minute wait under the sun. But that was before the wrath of Hades had unleashed on my stomach nearly two hours later. I was casually working at my desk when the first ominous grumble hit. I brushed it off, but after a few minutes I realized that there was no escaping this terrible fate. Three trips to the bathroom later, I knew I wasn't going to make it at work until 5 so I left so I could at least suffer in peace at home. Except I didn't make it home either, which is the reason I am now confined in a bathroom stall at Albertsons. Overall, if you don't mind long wait times and Medusa's hair slithering in and wreaking havoc on your intestines, this food is amazing. However if you value your time and your stomach, there are probably better alternatives.",DREJvhgOkStpFTfhNeEW9Q,0,0,1,yFIn9I0rVEReA5ismByjEw

1167937,2017-12-29,0,Q2pyp7Nb3cD4Br2BOnxUDA,"This review is for the location inside Walker Furniture. Let me first state that I am NOT a picky eater. I will eat just about anything and like it. This is the second time I ordered from them. I ordered the classic gyro and the Zante fries. 

The service was very good and the guy behind the counter was very nice. However the gyro was very plain nothing spectacular and could not eat more than two bites before I had to toss it. I thought ok, not all is lost and I was looking forward to eating my fries. 

The menu said they would have herbs and spices and feta cheese. No trace of any feta cheese and barely any herbs. On top of that, they were waaaaay undercooked. Sometimes I like a little soggy fry once in a while but not undercooked. I ultimately had to toss them in the trash. 

Overall, pretty disappointed and probably will be my last time there.",1_120oX-hqzvYbZWj3CSXA,0,0,2,ect-mrOIHDQS1aSuWCS5mQ

1977300,2018-02-02,0,Q2pyp7Nb3cD4Br2BOnxUDA,We ordered through GrubHub to be delivered at work for lunch. We ordered the Spartan Fries with a request of well done fries and extra Gyro meat and The Greek Rice Bowl. The Spartan Fries were like they were only thawed out and there was no Extra meat that we were charged extra for the meat. You could tell that the meat was not made on a shawarma machine. The Greek Rice did not state that it had feta cheese and when you open the container it was covered in feta. That is not what someone wants when they hate feta. There was so much on there you couldn't taste anything else. We contacted GrubHub and they attempted to contact the location to request that we get refunded or have the order remade. The owner refused to accommodate. This is terrible service for a business to refuse to rectify the situation. We will NEVER be ordering from there again.

onions, and a few other yummy toppings.

Aside from the food , the service is amazing. I was able to meet the owner which is pretty rare in a place like Vegas.

4107116,2017-03-11,5,Q2pyp7Nb3cD4Br2BOnxUDA,"Well that was an unexpected surprise.

I was following one of my favorite sweets-centric food trucks to some sort of ""craft show"" event at some space that was hitherto unknown to me when I decided that I really wanted some solid food. Greek Delights, which is more of a trailer than a full-sized truck, was conveniently located alongside.

Although I'd never so much as seen this truck before, the menu - relatively simple, like most food trucks - seemed familiar. They seem to feature fries a little more prominently than everything else, but I kept it simple and ordered a gyro combo ($10), which includes a Classic Gyro (normally $8) and an order of American Fries (normally $4). I was fortunate enough to find one of the very limited seats open as I waited for my meal, which didn't take too long to come out.

The gyro meat, touted as all beef and apparently the same rectangular meats as anywhere, was surprisingly as far from dry as I can recall. It was flavorful on its own, and the plentiful tzatziki, tomatoes, and red onions only made them better. The pita is standard fare but got a decent char on the grill. Overall, my impression there it's at least as good as the other gyros that I've tried so far in town.

The fries are not that impressive. ""Plain ol fries"" was the menu description, and they were pretty much that: generously sized portion, average-thickness cut, decent seasoning, but a little dry. They went alright when eaten with the gyro, but benefited a lot from ketchup (separately from the gyro of course). Perhaps the loaded Spartan Fries or at least the herbed and feta'd Zante Fries would have been more interesting, albeit not at a discount. Regardless, I wouldn't go for the plain fries again unless I was as hungry as I was tonight.

Considering that they serve one of the better gyros around while being a food truck, I am impressed with Greek Delights. I hope that they show up more often toward my side of town or at food truck gatherings that I tend to frequent. I'd love to get my hands (or fork) on those Spartan Fries next time.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,7,4,tQHcgnF-mZwLAKe5kDFBxQ
4265817,2017-12-01,0,Q2pyp7Nb3cD4Br2BOnxUDA,"I thought this place was amazing, until I actually saw how the food was made. The gyro meats are basically microwaved before serving. That kinda ruins it for me, though it tastes good. I mean, you wouldn't know it was microwaved had you not seen how it's prepared.

Their fries are made using an air fryer. That's a great option for those who are somewhat health conscious. But for me, if I'm going to eat some fries, they better be fried in some oil.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,0,0,3,XVxLrcTRvfEuUrURkgxBcg
4397542,2018-04-25,0,Q2pyp7Nb3cD4Br2BOnxUDA,"So I'm biased. The Greek Delight truck was at our office earlier, and while I waited for my Gyro salad, the meat was being freshly-grilled - While I waited! It only took a couple of minutes, but it was well worth it. The meat was at a perfect temperature, the perfect seasoning and the perfect amount. The lettuce was crisp and olives a pleasant, salty brininess. The salad was much heavier on the protein than I'd anticipated and that was welcome. I may have to pay the restaurant a visit.",KMPz7ie76JhzlxF76oqGkg,0,0,5,raXpn4QMd-GCfqXlwdDX-g
