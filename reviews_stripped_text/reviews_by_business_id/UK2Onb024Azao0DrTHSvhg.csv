146417,2014-10-23,1,UK2Onb024Azao0DrTHSvhg,"Stopped in today after watching a show last night where someone was having a gyro.  So i yelp gyro to find the closest one.  Lucky for me it was yannis.

I have been to the middle east so i am familiar with their style of kabob and shawarma.   But this was my first ""real"" gyro.  I think i had one back in the 90s when all the fast food places were making their version.

So lets dive into the food.  The portion was perfect.  Hungry guys every where should be happy.  I probably could have only had half but in the spirit of yelp i had to ensure that the last bite was as good as the first.

I ordered the traditional gyro combo woth garlic feta fries.  First bite was a fry.  DELICIOUS.  Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They were garlicy but why order garlic fries if thats not what you're into.  It also had some sort of fry sauce lightly drizzled on it.  Not sure what it was but neither added or detracted from the fries as a whole.  I think the buffalo sauce that they removed from previous reviews would have been okay on the3 side.l but they were good as is.
The gyro was super good.  None of the individual ingredients tried to take the lead but together it was bliss.  I did try the meat by itself.  Great flavor and some of the pieces were crispy and some had more chew.  It was great.

For dessert i had some baklava.   I mran it was sitting there all by itself on the counter and needed me to save it from its plexiglass prison.  It tasted like all baklava ive had before.  Sweet cinnamon and yummy.

The staff was also very friendly.  The guy at the register was very nice.",9CeKCGRwlXMzo9c62xiUPw,3,0,5,DhGpaypEyKq6sCZRR7rGvA

This may be the best Greek food I've ever eaten. The prices are a bit higher than I expected, but it was well worth the price. The portions are very generous. The garlic feta fries are a MUST. The chicken on the kebab plate was lean and moist. They didn't skimp on the meat in the gyro, either. Go there. You will not be disappointed.",Cig1NEEKvDTYC-puDIvEbA,1,1,5,rRwDApY9Cf56FceYdUzeyg

We ordered the chicken kebab plate and garlic feta fries to share and were surprised at how much food it came with. Salad came in a separate bowl and was really well-balanced, with plenty of toppings, and was really crisp and refreshing. Chicken kebab plate came soon after and was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Fries were also perfectly crispy though I wish they had a little bit more sauce. They brought the pita bread after we were nearly done, but it came out warm and fluffy.

1368021,2018-01-29,0,UK2Onb024Azao0DrTHSvhg,"Yanni's Greek Grill is so worth the drive for flavorful Greek cuisine. The restaurant is located on the corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and East Silverado Ranch. You'll see a Shell Gas Station as a landmark, it's in the Silverado Junction plaza and the restaurant is next to a tattoo shop. 

I ordered the Chicken Shish Kebob Plate ($12.99) which comes with two skewers of grilled chicken on a bed of Orzo Rice Pilaf and a side of tzatziki sauce. The meal includes a small Greek Salad and Fresh Homemade Pita Bread. For appetizer, I chose Garlic Feta Fries ($3.50) which are seasoned fries topped with feta cheese, garlic sauce, spice paprika, and parsley. I love the addition of feta cheese and garlic sauce, it just makes the fries more fun to eat. 

Now they do make the meal fast, it was around 15 minutes when my order came. The chicken kebob taste tender and flavorful especially when you eat it with tzatziki. And I am hooked on the Orzo Rice Pilaf, it's a nicely seasoned savory rice and they make it so fluffy and delicious. The Greek Salad is an added bonus, it has fresh crisp romaine lettuce topped with baby sliced cucumbers, red onions, kalamata olives, juicy tomatoes, feta cheese, spice paprika, a light drizzle of olive oil, and every ingredient in the salad is fresh. I love how my meal makes me feel good. Everything taste amazing.

The dining area is open and very spacious, it's like a happy place. The walls are painted in a pretty blue color which makes objects and artwork stand out. They add a silk flower to every table to give it a personal touch. Also there is an elevated lounge area where you can sit comfortably as a group and enjoy friendly conversations. The service is on point, there isn't a wait, your meal gets made fresh, the food is served fast, and they make you feel welcome. Now the highlight of my day is the amazing food and entertainment. My dining table is right next to the TV and I was excited when they started featuring Furious 7. It's the best day ever.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,2,0,5,kuE0QbdgqXpJVa8ELh_4hA

1431426,2014-03-14,3,UK2Onb024Azao0DrTHSvhg,"I was really looking forward to enjoying this place with all the great reviews. We were extremely disappointed. One of those rare occasions I forgot my cell phone or I could have posted pictures to explain why. I ordered a vegetarian plate with hummus, baba & falafel. The hummus was form fitted to the section in the plate just like jello pudding cups, was this plated in the morning for my 7:30 pm visit? Not what I expect when they post a sign on the counter that they don't have specials because they don't use (have?) leftovers. Really wish I'd had my phone to take a picture.
Baba was not as form fitted, but both were covered in a clear oil, if it even was olive it had no olive taste or color so either low quality or not even olive. I have had better hummus buying pre-packaged at the grocery stores. Baba did not impress either, sad that I have made it once at home from an online recipe & my guests loved that, this one taste was enough. I will continue to drive on to Stephano's when craving some baba.
I love falafel, to the extreme that when I go to Parsley Mediterranean Grill, as soon as I walk in they ask me how many orders of falafel I want that day. Here, when I called before going to see if they were gluten-free, I was told they are made from a mix which is gluten free - garbanzo, fava & corn oil. But judging from the shape & texture - these were like balls of bean flavored cake - almost like cupcake consistency. Were they baked or fried? There wasn't oil on the plate under them & they soaked up the tahini that was squirted on them. Baked would be healthier, but these just didn't cut it for me. I ate  1/2 of one & it came with 4. Yes, I left hungry having eaten less than 2 full bites of a $10 plate.
His kebab plate which he ordered the chicken charred wasn't even showing a speck of char on the second trip from the grill (yes we know it's unhealthy charred but it's how he likes it & ordered it). The Greek salad on the plate was drenched in oil so it was flavorless because as I've said, the oil has no color or taste. Probably why there is so much paprika spread on the top, guess not just for presentation but if any taste is desired, mix it in.
Maybe they were in a rush to get out since it was about closing time, but for $30 with the above, an order of their garlic feta fries & a can of soda , if eating off plastic plates & utensils the food should be good. 
This kind of reminds me of food in a mall's food court, not a stand alone restaurant
Food was 1 star, service would have been 3 but couldn't get his char on, cleanliness is what brought them up to 2 stars. 
Still trying to figure out all those 5-star reviews. I use yelp all the time to find great new places, but this time I feel really let down. Maybe for meat eaters this is good, but definitely don't recommend for a vegan.",vMYKQeuuC9py7VkRCdAquQ,5,1,2,ejejHHtBELGetXT4dbXr5g

1649559,2017-09-13,0,UK2Onb024Azao0DrTHSvhg,I'm very conflicted about this place. It has hands-down some of the best Greek food in town but the lady working the front is one of the rudest people I've ever seen in a restaurant. She was short-tempered with the rest of the staff and was curt and rude to the customers. It's a real shame because their pita falafels and garlic feta fries are some of the best food in town.

Then i saw this place, and thought to myself, ""hmm, a greek salad would sure be healthier"" so i decided to Yanni's on a whim.  While entering, i noticed there were a few people in line ordering for take out so I could tell this was a trendy/popular spot.  I was greeted by a middle aged woman with a smile.  She helped me decide what to order, which was a filet minion kabob with a salad no onions and no olives, and i told her I wanted to have an ample amount of lettuce on my salad.  My order came in less than 10 minutes, super fast, hot delicious meat on a beautiful thick salad with 3-4 tomatoes and lots of feta.  Also came with a dressing and yogurt sauce.  I gulped every bite.  And felt very satisfied after.  I think I have a new favorite Greek Spot now!! Used to only trust going to Yassou's greek grill but now they have a tough competitor... this place is great!! Super affordable too..  I was impressed by a huge salad and 12 oz of Filet Minion on kabobs for less than $20 after tax!!  Woohoo Ill be coming back for sure.",PhVbFKUc2BEx1yfLfgiLGA,0,0,5,g5CmwYFuv-tdPTVPLsqXEw
1692703,2015-03-15,2,UK2Onb024Azao0DrTHSvhg,"I kept passing by Yanni's Greek Grill for awhile before I decided to go inside and try out their food. Yanni's is small, housed behind the Del Taco and it's possible to miss seeing the sign if you're not looking for it sometimes, but it's there and it is worth eating there. The first time I ordered from there, I got the chicken shawarma platter (all platters include orzo rice pilaf, small Greek salad, and pita bread). The people behind the counter were friendly and my take-out food arrived quickly. I took my food home and ate the most delicious Greek food I've had in a really long time. I was also surprised by how filling the platter was, so much so that I was full the rest of the day.

I've also ordered the combo value meal with shawarma and a side dish of garlic feta fries. The food, especially the fries, blew my mind. The value meal also is enough food to keep me full the rest of the day, so unless you're a bottomless pit, I don't suggest getting some Yanni's late in the day.

I keep going back to Yanni's Greek Grill because the food is amazing and I'm satisfied with their customer service. I've never eaten in, as I'm usually too busy to, but while there isn't a public restroom, there Yanni's are friendly folk who make you feel at home, something I've witnessed time and time again while I waited for my food and other people were eating in. If you're in the area, definitely stop by Yanni's Greek Grill. I know I'm probably already there. ;)",vLUHU5KxoB_CzLSHLkwz-g,4,5,5,GKXjfqKSWdWMgnb7Ket7Rw

While Stephano's is my usual Greek salad restaurant, I was down south of the strip and thought this might be a nice alternative based on the yelp reviews. When I walked in there was only one other gentleman in the restaurant (about 1:30pm?) This is a real family run restaurant, and it reminded me of my mother taking my order which is fantastic!

They don't really have a grilled chicken kebab salad on the menu so we ordered the grilled chicken kebab lunch with two sides of salad. Take a look at the picture as it was delicious looking and tasting.

They load up the gyro pita/sandwich with meat. The rice with the plates is very good as well, they also come with a nice mini Greek side salad. I always get the garlic fets fries, they're good but need a touch additional seasoning (salt). Friendly staff. They make it fresh so it takes maybe 10 min but worth it. Tables are kinda small so large party's take note. 

I'm a huge fan of gyros, this is a close second place to the best in town and I've been here nearly 20 years.

2192002,2014-02-10,0,UK2Onb024Azao0DrTHSvhg,"One of the best gyros on the Eastside.  Yanni's Greek Grill is a no-frills diner with focus on great tasting Greek food.  The owner does the cooking in an open area with his wife (I think).  Strangely, the cooking area behind the counter is 3-4 times bigger than the dining area, which only has 2-3 tables (there are more tables outside).

The owner is very friendly and easygoing.  We asked if there was any relation to Yanni's Gyros.  He said that he used to own it, sold it, and opened up this new place.  I followed up with ""So that means the food here is better than the other place, right?""  The owner smiled and said he wasn't sure.

I got the shawarma pita combo with the garlic freta fries.  The shawarma uses the same meat as the gyro, except instead of tzaziki sauce, it comes with shawarma sauce.  I found the shawarma sauce to be in-between the creamy white tzaziki sauce and the heavy hummus mix.  I asked for some tzaziki sauce and converted the second half of my pita into a normal gyro, which I preferred more.

The gyro/shawarma pita is huge.  The gyro meat was delicious, tasty with consistent texture.  The pita came with significantly more meat than Yanni's Gyros; I didn't taste any difference in the meat between the two, but my friend said that the meat at Yanni's Greek Grill was a little saltier.  The garlic fries were tasty and similar to that offered by Yanni's Gyros. 

What to do: Order and pay at the counter.  The owner will then bring the food to your table, along with plastic utensils and napkins.  When finished, just leave your plates at the table and the owner will cleanup.  Tip jar is located on the counter.  There is plenty of parking in the mall lot.

This review should begin with 5 stars...

When I was a little person, I used to love Greek night. Dad would break out the frying pan and get busy on some Gyro and the smell would fill the air and appetite or not, I immediately found a hunger. And every time I had it, I was fat and happy. 
But I didn't know what good Gyro was until I found this hidden gem. Kitty corner from the South Point casino you can find a Gyro as big as a football and loaded with flavors that taste like they were pulled from Mother Nature herself. The meat is like bacon on steroids and seasoned with just enough spice to compliment the tzatziki sauce. Fresh lettuce and ripe tomatoes fill out the remainder of the pita. 
When I sat down, I was only slightly hungry, I had only planned on eating half. I was three bites in when I realized only an idiot wouldn't finish it. 
It may be a little further than your other places, but no matter the distance, it's worth the trip.

Eat up! 

Ps-it only lost the last star cause the decor isn't completed yet (although when it does, it's going to be very inviting and filled with beautiful art.
Pps-I may be a stick in the mud, but when I tried to go compliment the cooking, no one was around to hear. Service industry, someone always has to be listening.

Walked into this small little restaurant with mostly table seating and a lounge area clean little place ,promptly seated given a menu with  good selections we ordered .

A Shawarma Platter for $11.99 and a Gyro Combo for $11.25 .  The platter came with Orzo Rice Pilaf, Small Greek Salad , and Pita Bread , starting with the salad it was fresh and crisp with a good Greek Salad dressing served with slightly grill pita that was crisp but soft in the inside we also had a order of hummus at the table which was Delicious ! The Shawarma a mixture of beef and lamb served on top of the rice was good but I noticed it was chopped and not shaved so you know I asked and the I believe the owner/ chef told me she prefer to serve it that way easier to chew well ok good nevertheless . Now the Chicken Gyro was good with the Tahini sauce to us it had a different taste not what we're used to it was kind of sweet but it was alright served with hummus which I already stated was good . All in all it was a good meal .

This is a nice little restaurant which has good Mediterranean Cuisine, Good service , Clean inside and Good food a must try ,and remember support your Local Small Businesses when in the area we will definitely come again !",78lSMnppchL8-yN06z4Q8A,84,74,4,yLbrzXK8HisO01I-zqKPww

Yanni's has started to use Uber eats. We ordered a large order through the app. And requested a few substitutions-as we have numerous times in the past without issue.

This time, some of the orders had correct subs and some of them were disregarded all together.

No one from our party was exceptionally please. Some mentioned it was ""ok"" but not anything special. Not what we had become accustomed to. Some of the comments were that the gyro meat was dry and on the salty side. The greens in the salads were wilted. The tzatziki sauce was runny. The hummus had an off, somewhat acidic flavor

Our office is a little more than one mile down the same street from the restaurant and yet delivery took almost an hour and a half. The Uber delivery driver said the restaurant had sent their apologies in the delivery time and said they got behind on orders. This would have been understandable and an explanation for the previously mentioned issues. I could have chalked it up to a ""one off"" experience.

Unfortunately, the dagger came while I was picking out the onions (I had specifically requested none) from my salad. I found a nice dead fly staring back at me. Unknown if anymore were present as I tossed the meal after taking this picture",W5_OS_FuMRWZ0KobEscPlQ,0,0,1,P6UbvqhUpBhhyVXdt_yoww

The place is small, it's counter service. There are two tables inside and one table outside.  So I had decided to take it to go. 

I remembered from my previous visit to Yanni's that I wasn't a huge fan of the tzatziki, it had too much dill for my liking, just my personal preference. The pita was warm and soft, but the gyro meat (a combo of lamb and beef) was a bit dry this time around, and it had a slight discoloration on one side of the meat, like the part that was on the outside of the spit, maybe too long.

I also ordered a side of babaghanoush, which was delicious  (although I wish they had given us a larger portion for $4.50...at least filled up the container!) I did order one extra order of pita bread for the babaghanoush and an extra tzatziki sauce, because I like lots of sauce! I had Uber Eats deliver it and everything was hot and fresh when it arrived. I will definitely order from Yanni's again!",oGVXjtyrSNedZKvxAyeGvQ,0,0,4,iv0UKQGgfXUBrYjAdIOJbg

Oddly enough, this wasn't my first option for food when I came to this strip mall. I was supposed to be going to Capriottis for a sandwich, but they didn't really have any great vegan options. Then I walked over to Del Taco because I was going to settle on a bean and cheese burrito (no cheese) and a bean tostada. But then I thought, I eat Del Taco all the time, this can wait. 

Yanni's it was. I pulled out my phone real quick and came right to yelp. The overall rating was solid, so I decided to ignore my first impression of the outside and give it a legit shot. 

The inside isn't anything out of Mykonos or Santorini, so don't get your hopes up (LOL). But the fact that people were sitting and eating, as well as the phone/pick up orders kept coming in, I knew this place was doing something right. 

This was traditional greek food, but everything in their falafel wrap along with their fries were vegan, so I went with that. The flavor was amazing, if I had time and space in my stomach I would have ordered another, and that was just the wrap. The fries may be the best thing on their menu. I'm talking top 5 all time on my fry list. 

Sidenote: The gentleman helping me even got it out quickly for me since I told him I was in a rush (BONUS POINTS).

I tried this place out becuase i was craving some Greek salad.
I had to give it a 4 star becuase i was a bit disappointed with the dressing on the salad. It was not vinegretty at all.. it was like pure oil and a little spicy hint to it which I did not expect at all.

The salad itself look beautiful and tasteful but it just wasn't what it looked like.

On the other hand... the garlic feta fries were freaken DERICIOUS! They were juicy fries with lots of garlic flavor and soft feta cheese sprinkled all over.
Also got the hummus appetizer which was also a little bland for my taste and not enough citrus. But they did give a lot of pita bread with it!

Baklava was absolutely delicious and you could see the pure honey on it and every bite had some crunch to it from the nuts.

Overall I would definately be back for the garlic fries and probably the salad but bring my own dressing.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,1,0,4,pOqmU-VW_t6l3_BTNl2mfQ

 The falafel is dry and salty. It tastes like a pound of salt was added. When I complained to the owner she admitted that it is not made fresh it comes from a premixed mix. Why not make falafel fresh like other Greek Restaurants?
 1) Its too hard
 2) we are short handed
Excuses for serving garbage store brought salty mixes? 
 My teenager could have made a better Greek meal.
Stay away from this gross restaurant if you are smart.

Second of all, we ordered a lamb gyro, garlic feta fries, spanikopita, stuffed grape leaves, some other kind of kopita I cannot remember, and baklava.

Everything came out prompt, and the food was incredible. The garlic feta fries were out of this world. The lamb in the gyro was moist and tender. The spanikopita and ""other"" kopita were crispy, hot, cheesy, and delicious. My husband was very suspicious of the stuffed grape leaves, but ended up loving them. The texture can be a bit off-putting if you don't know what to expect, but they were doused with lemon-y goodness and went well with the fried portion of our meal, as a nice offset.

The baklava was covered in sticky, honey goodness.

I was driving into Vegas, and needed a quick snack before a dinner that was later in the day. Came across this place on Yelp, and knew I had to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.

We ordered just two plates to share: The garlic feta fries and the chicken kabob plate.

Garlic Feta Fries - Fried to perfection and topped with a generous portion of feta along with a garlic sauce. Such a great bite after a long day of driving.

Chicken Kabob Plate - Comes with a good-sized Greek salad that's as bright as it is refreshing. ""Clean eating"" is what comes to mind. The plate comes with two skewers on top of rice and a side of tangy yogurt sauce. Great flavor on the chicken, and with the yogurt it was very good.

All I can say is that even though I came for a ""light"" snack, this was a great meal. I was surprised at how large the portions were, and left stuffed. Service was great. It seems like they have a lot of regulars!",W8P0jQq0FozWdc2SixorDw,3,0,5,rpS-yskqBf6Huiu0dRNoOw

We tried a trio sampler:  Baba ganoush, Dolmades and Kreotopita (spring rolls with ground beef) with a garlic dipping sauce. Of the three we loved the beef spring rolls and dip the best. Everything was fresh made and you could taste it too  

Down side is they don't have fountain drinks so they sell cans of soda and water and no public bathroom (you can go to Del Taco across the way).

Chicken Gyro:
Chicken, tzatziki, onions and tomatoes. The pita is warm and fluffy. The chicken is not dry. 4/5

Beef/Lamb Gyro:
Beef/lamb, tzatziki, onions and tomatoes. 4/5

Garlic Feta Fries:
They have my favorite Greek fries in town. Garlicky, flavorful, tangy yet creamy feta on top of crispy fried potatoes.  You could give me a bucket of these fries and tell me that's all I can eat all day and I'll be more than happy. Yuuuuummm!!!  5/5

Baklava:

Also, I order a chicken Greek salad and totally had a brain fart and forgot to ask for the dressing on the side. When I was finally able to track the owner down he was not super kind about the request saying that he had already made it and kinda huffing & puffing about how he would have to make a new one. I am way to big of a push over and agreed that it would be fine. 

The salad was actually quite delicious and thankfully he didn't totally overdo it with the dressing but it was still a little too oily. The food alone is at least 4 starts and I might be back but only for take out and now I know to ask for the dressing on the side. 

The owner did offer after the food came out to make me another one if I didn't like it, but it would have been nice to have been offered that option first.

The food is cooked to perfection - the feta, garlic fries are ridiculously good, but if you're looking for more classic dishes, the kabobs and gyro's will not disappoint. Bottom line, if you're looking for excellent food and even better service, head here.   You won't be sorry.",P2rpxLkxhoMzrLTsUx9yGQ,0,0,5,JnPvTtnqYpGiVz0sVFzlfA

Meat was tasty as was the yogurt sauce. I am used to it having more tang, but it was still good.",iKMSkHTaJOl35Gfz53XjZg,0,1,4,skcoUy3wxx-Hwz8bzIRueA
