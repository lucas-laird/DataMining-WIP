I've only had the beef tacos so I can't necessarily speak for the other foods that they have but I can guarantee that they have quality food and they are worth checking out if you're a fan of Mexican food as they are a genuine Mexican food business.",lkcyRPkigSNZRfEaqdHAdw,2,1,4,keioALrnTIuMy6owOtVTuA

1893105,2014-08-20,8,6Ve_2kEz18dvhp4q3M5I2Q,"Grilled Mexican chicken. Don't waste your money on chemicals in El Pollo Loco's franchised nonsense- go here. Basically the same cuisine, except none of those white-ified salads and avocado-based dishes, and none of the chemicals.

These guys literally throw the seasoning on your meat, toss it on the grill in front of you until it smells like straight-up heaven, then serve it with rice, beans, and tortillas. For rock-bottom prices. 

Love their daily specials: Wednesday you can get 12 pieces for like $10, Thursday they offer a 10 piece taquitos deal, etc. That's right: they also do tacos, burritos, and tortas. Everything is well priced, but the chicken is what really shines.

Intro to the salsa bar: not sure it'd bass health code inspection, as the ice has melted to water, but the heat and spice in each sauce probably keeps away both bacteria and the Chupacabra. Suggest the red with chopped veggies and the verde. Be careful of the other red salsa, it might kill your extended family by accident it's so potent.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,3,QsvcjieHDbpS0ram88wSjw

My coworker and I have been trying to go to this place the past couple months. But it's been hot or too cold. The perfect time to go is that spring gap (one week of Vegas spring). 

We finally got to try it out and it didn't disappoint. $1 tacos?! Can't beat that! Ordered the asada, pastor, buche, cabeza and pollo. It comes with the basic cilantro and onions. YOu can grab your own hot sauce in their little station.

The sad part is, people wrote in their reviews that they have a seating area. But when we went, there were none.

I tried it for the first time about a month ago and have been addicted ever since. They always have chicken on the BBQ and it smells AMAZING!!! yum! My current fave is the canre asada tacos. They are only $1 and are truly amazing.

The only reason why they are getting 4 stars is simply because the last time that I went the salsa was really hot and almost empty.  It was kinda gross. But, since I was going home and I had some there..it didn't hurt my meal.

4230428,2017-07-22,0,6Ve_2kEz18dvhp4q3M5I2Q,I work right by this place and can smell it everyday! Finally went and ate there with my boyfriend and it was amazing. Very inexpensive with 100% quality meat. We got chicken tacos and carne asada tacos and wanted to go back for more. The salsa taste fresh and home made and the meat is tender and juicy. They were quick and polite and even accepted our debit card with no trouble! We will definitely be going back more often!!!! Delicious food!!!!,-V-SVmhwqBmEBA7E_iqLBQ,0,0,5,1fInThmSBJKNh9uBM567ZA

We come here because its close to were we live. The name is self explanatory, its a mobile of chicken... and other meats! But, if you come here, get the chicken!

We've tried the carne asada and pollo tacos from here, and while my son love the carne; the pollo is the real winner here! The chicken is so succulent and delicious and perfectly seasoned! The carne, IMO, was just OK. Not horrible, but not the best. The tacos are the real Mexican kind, the soft small tortillas. They also include onions and cilantro if you'd like.

Come and try the deliciousness this food truck has to offer!!

Tacos are $1 each
I ordered: 
2 carne asada 
2 carnitas 
4 al pastor

Unfortunately all the meat was dry and instead of getting Carnitas they gave me chicken, service was very fast before I could fill up the green sauce containers, the food was ready but they didn't have any radishes, carrots, or onions at the condiment bar. They also forgot to give me limes.

They were grilling some chicken and they had some seats set up while you wait for your order to be filled and can watch TV.....(playing current movies in theaters)....I tried 3 Asada Tacos for $1 each and gave him a $2 tip and all I can say is WOW, they were excellent. Each taco had a large portion of meat and some cilantro and onions and for only $1 each I can say I was surprised at how much they served for such a low price. Put on some fresh salsa and some grilled onions and peppers from the serving tray and feasted on a great meal.

They grill whole chickens in the parking lot and you can get one for $10 for 12 pieces of chicken. There's a tv hooked up in front of the food truck and on most given nights it's playing soccer. The tacos are tasty, fresh to order and cheap. Seating consists of 4 folding chairs in the parking lot while you wait to take your tacos home.",-AGXyI_K8StzQ7CGehQ2tQ,1,1,5,g5kTBn67TaeS3S27fa7Ang

I seriously would give this place 5 stars becuh-uhhzz...Street tacos for a dollar!!! Legit street tacos for a dollar! Come on, you can't beat that! Unless someone got super competitive and marketed their street tacos for .99cents! My review is a late one, typical, but I just can't give them the 5 stars because when we arrived, their salsa bar needed attention. Like how you know you're going to have to be the one to change the toilet paper, but instead...you grab barely enough sheets so that the next person is stuck with one sheet to wipe and the obligation to change it. 

I failed to make the connection, but leave it to me to put tacos and toilet paper in a story. Salsa bar, yes, needed cleaning and needed refilling. Husband was disappointed there wasn't any of those pickled vegetables, yet, failed to let them.know. Look, our job that evening was to eat. Didn't feel like being inventory control specialist as well. Lol. 

I ordered chicken tacos because upon pulling into the lot, the smell.of.rotisserie chicken was magnetic, so I suckered in. It did not disappoint me at all. The tacos aren't Roberto sized tacos, just to put it into perspective. They're more on the mini sized, but certainly worth the dollar!!! The husband pretty much went down the menu and he enjoyed it all. Surprise-Surprise. 

Remember...Street tacos. Cilantro and onions. Don't go crying when you don't see guacamole, pico, and all the other jazz in your dollar taco. And for a dollar?! Heller.

No tables so eat it in your car, on the hood, in the trunk,   or in the car with your legs dangling out of the door like any respectable dollar eating street taco person would. =P",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,1,2,4,nyt1SSdt9P6F8a2HlMkdcw

The last few times the level of service has been horrible and today was another bad day...I guess. Last week  I paid for and ordered 6 pollo tacos with everything. I have been here several times before with no issues. Unfortunately I forgot to check my order before I left. Ultimately I got less of what I paid for ( 4 tacos ) and upon return to fix my order for the mistake I was greeted with disgust for requesting the correction. So I guess the lady at the window remembered me and the food was no less than charcoal when I received the Wednesday Special of 12 pieces of chicken for $10, as well as the 6 tacos had more onions than chicken with no cilantro. I returned the food and asked for a replacement to be told that I can't have anymore. She was very hesitant to return my money as well. It will be a while before I return to this establishment.  The sad part is that the food that I ordered wasn't even for me. I bragged about how good the food is to a friend and ordered it for him.",uEHvq3abviow8-kVRr_qhA,1,0,2,rqbiZ9LDAyh254Ukck4pHA
