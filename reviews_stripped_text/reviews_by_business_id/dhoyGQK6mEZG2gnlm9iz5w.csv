 We had many small dishes empanadas of chicken was good but tiny. Sopes was good.  Tostaditas as well tasty! And grilled corn was delicious no mayo add crema. Pozole was not authentic not my cup of tea.",NA6fxvAMLAORgvJhkr8QAw,0,0,4,Dn9XBeTeXcOl3ETsUyDSoA

Chef Paco, personally came to greet us, our waiters name was Jesse. I'm calling them out, because I wish they had a place like this in LA.
I love the vibe, the service, everyone, the food, the drinks!!!! I'm truly impressed. 
Please OPEN ONE IN LA. I will personally volunteer to work there! 
This place is AMAZING!!! I'll be back!!!",HZl7WQ7DPgubY4KV0nbV7g,0,0,5,iYFH2EO4XMZftTh8PvjTeg

The breakfast burrito is really good-the #5 Burrito Special eggs, ham, bacon, hash browns and cheese.  The food is great but I have to deduct a star b/c the food takes forever to be ready. Our neighbor recommended this place to us.",SHlrZSn5dwHP4UAhTwWM3Q,2,1,4,qhBCMAsx3_N49vLQjNQTfg
