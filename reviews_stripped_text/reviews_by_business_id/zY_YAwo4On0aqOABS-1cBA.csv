Indian couple in front Of us treated extremely poorly and talked down to rudely when they asked for vegetarian beans instead of black  beans, When I ordered my food they gave me literal scraps left in the pan, maybe like 7 pieces of dice chicken and half a spoon of rice, the food maybe took up one quarter of a bowl I ordered a chicken bowl, ridiculous. I was also treated poorly the girl rolled her eyes when I asked if I could have more meat and told me she would have to charge me double meat, what a joke, I didn't even get a half a spoonful of meat.

The ""2 for one"" margaritas?  Only applies to the BIGGEST Margaritas.  So again, all false and misleading.

One of the cheapest and nicest places to get some quick grub that wont bog u down. Pretty good menu, prices are pretty inexpensive (for the strip) and the quality of the food was pretty good. Decent selection of beers and  probably one of the cheapest Grain Alcohol-slushie prices on the strip. I didn't try any of them because grain alcohol gives me a headache. 

Anyway, I ordered two Carne' Asada tacos from the menu, go to choose my beans, good choices of meat and vegetables, and all my toppings. The Place reminded me of Chipotle's. I also took note of a few impersonator's that came in to eat while I was there-Jack Sparrow and One of the two Bumblebee's on the strip-further confirming that this was probably a good price point place to eat. 

Sat a table facing the walkway so I could people watch, and enjoyed two good sized soft-tacos for about $5! Beware, the spicy red & green sauces were a little hotter and spicier than I expected.  A great place to eat because I don't believe there was any food served in the Baby Doll Lounge I was going back to in a few minutes.

Hope this helps!

For 25 bucks, got 2 drinks, and 6 tacos for two. 
The toppings are great; salsa, cheese, corn, etc all are spot on delish. Taco shells and tortllas taste fine and crisp shell.
If their tortillas, taco shells, and ESPECIALLY their carne asada meat are all ICE COLD. Colder than the toppings. 
What amazes me is that they heat the tortillas in front of you (steam) but when you eat turns cold. Still, ok, but the meats sitting there really need to be changed more often, and much, much warmer temperature.
Its all we ate so all I can rate it on, not a margarita person. And didnt wanna pay 5 bucks for a small basket of chips and guac; the salsa in the taco toppings is good enough. $9 gets you a burrito or 3 tacos. I'd recommend a mix of hard/soft taco;
tell them to heat up that damn meat.
Also have carnitas and chicken, but those looked more lifeless and arctic than the meat.
Absolute SICK pain in the ass getting here though.
Having tried tapatio packets b4, knew that it wasnt contributing to the fire in my piehole. Its their salsa. Very good on as a taco topping.
They should take out preservative-laced tapatio and replace with cholula packets, like caesers court. tastes better and no benzonate crap in it.
Service very mediocre at best. Forget a friendly smile or any enthusiasm here.

I had the 6-taquito meal topped with guacamole, pico de gallo and cheese. It was good, but I could have gone with the 3 instead of the 6. I was stuffed! You also get free chips and salsa with any $5 purchase, but the woman working behind the counter seemed very annoyed that we all asked for it even though it's advertised throughout the restaurant and all over the menu. My sister asked for hot and got some mild pico de gallo concoction instead...I had the hot and our friend had the medium. Pretty good salsa and taquitos and not bad prices at all.",YORBk-9pWIz7xPVWRUizIw,0,0,3,JtW6EQxGg9lVqBJC4mRjSA

We definitely used the groupon deal so make sure you do that. The mai tai was the best flavor!

The chips and freshly made guacamole with the spicy salsa is definitely the best snack meal around. They make these killer Blue Lemonade Margaritas that are to die for. 

We definitely made a few stops here for drinks and more guac!",fcWM-oqjgS94yi1INhZa0g,2,0,5,aYmu1P0XF2-dUcpkRO0S8w

5363138,2014-04-19,0,zY_YAwo4On0aqOABS-1cBA,"The drinks and food are cheap... But not worth it if you're sitting at the bar. 
The bartender (blonde female) made an extremely offensive and racist comment to me. Picking up one of those naked escort cards, she held it up in front of my face and said that there is a very close resemblance to me and the woman on the card. 

As a part-Japanese woman, I found it completely offensive that 1) she compared me to a woman who was Asian but looked nothing like me; 2) she compared me to a naked escort; and 3) did this completely out of the blue. There was absolutely no conversation prior to this comment and I have never met her before in my life. Regardless, it would've been offensive no matter who said that to me. 

I don't know if she was trying to make a joke or she was just absolutely clueless. I love this bar, so I'll likely return - but definitely not to sit at the bar... And definitely not to tip the bartender.",sdqxAysszQzYyXxCNlYceA,0,0,2,AI8aYu51Su2xgX0fX37RIQ

The only thing that threw me off a bit was the DJ. He was so loud it was hard for me to order my food. Entertaining of course, but loud.
