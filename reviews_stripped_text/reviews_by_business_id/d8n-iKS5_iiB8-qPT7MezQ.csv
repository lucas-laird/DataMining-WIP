One was Nicole who had probably the worst customer service etiquette I have seen in my life...she was rude, loud and obnoxious and had a very sarcastic tone and she even snatched right out of my hand and yelled at me about taking a golden spoon that they had prominently displayed on the main counter with all the other spoons...The other was Briana and she was a delight and pleasure to deal with and she kept apologizing for her coworkers behavior ;)",J3buAe4i8UMCjlQ9zqLo7g,0,0,1,oCvTI67hZ__BodTEQZz4bw

Would go back here again because of the great service.  The drink was really yummy.  My little one didn't even want to share because he loved it so much.  Good thing I had one for him and one for me.,TeOjhvsTG30U2FglW7gXQA,0,0,5,NMBBxUEPnPsGzYgaEUEa8A

Friendly staff and a plethora of dessert items to choose from. I like the monthly blizzard options. They just keep doing what they know best and that's good service + food. The people that own this location also own many in town, which is good because the people they hire are consistent. Each time I have been inside of this location, the service has been good.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,1,0,5,EvlveTVTdkjrx0Op2kdtmA

When calories are not an issue and you just don't give a crap, a blizzard hits the spot. With a slew of mix ins to add to their vanilla base, you cannot go wrong. The mint Oreo or thin mint during girl scout season are my favorite. They have all the classics; banana splits, sundaes, cones, and dilly bars to satisfy everyone.

The employees in this location are nice. Nothing screams happiness more than ice cream, so I like to have friendly people serving me.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,4,9qrfM8MK8Y-jcAUuDNi7pg

(very sad there is no more cotton candy blizzards!)",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,1,0,4,16nKebIpQHxqpvOiekbLwA
