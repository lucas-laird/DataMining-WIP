She didn't know the dishes or what they had or not.  It seemed like everything we ordered off the menu, was not available that night.  The calamari was so tough we couldn't chew it and it smelled extremely fishy.  The grape leaves were tough.  The green beans that were served with my salmon were so soggy, it seemed like they had been cooking for days.  The sauce on my salmon was lumpy and cold.  The potatoes were cold and over spiced.

For $30 you get 2 entrees and 2 glasses of house wine. My friend and I go one evening and didnt expect to be treated so rudely by the manager because we had a groupon deal, Our male server was nice at first and we gave him our groupon deal that i had printed from home and then his attitude changed. there was only 1 more party eating at this place besides us. We ordered exactly what was said on the deal and nothing more so we expected to pay just that plus gratuity but when we were presented with our check, to our surprise, it was $25 more than what it was supposed to be. 
The waiter coudnt give me a good reason why we were getting ripped off here so we ask for the manager. The manager was so rude & kept giving me different reasons as to why he is charging me extra and when i explained to him that it doesnt make sense and I shoed him the fine print and printed deal over and over again. He got really irate with me to the point of yelling and getting aggressive and said how is he going to make money if he only charges me what the groupon says. WELL THEN WHY THE HELL DID HE PARTICIPATE IN GROUPON! NOT MY FAULT! and the whole pont is to try get repeat customers. I know I shouldnt have paid but my friend said lets just pay the extra and get out of here and never come back because it was pointless to argue with this older aggressive greek man who apparently is the owner. On our way out to the car the waiter asked us why we didnt tip him. I told him him his manager must be ripping him off to and we left. Worst experience ever!

We came because we had a groupon that had expired but they said they would still take it for the price I paid for it. After calling TWICE to confirm that groupon information was correct, we decided to go with a friend. I don't know how this place got this many stars because it is the WORST experience that I have had at any restaurant in Vegas. We first walked in to a dark, over decorated restaurant that's ambience was about as great as a funeral home. They had one window open allowing some sun in, which was adding some nice color to the restaurant; until they pulled the thick, old drapes over the window. We ordered soda and a few meals. They brought out bread (which I think they got from Vons and put in the microwave to seem fresh made) and a ""greek salad"" which consisted of iceberg lettuce and cheap feta cheese.
Half way through the salad an overweight, sloppy looking waiter (with a stained shirt) came out to let us know they weren't going to honor what they had said over the phone ""because the busser answered the phone and gave you the wrong information"". I asked to speak with the manager and he never showed up but offered ""20% off the bill"". That would never be enough to redeem a DISGUSTING restaurant. 

I would never recommend this place to anyone. Im all about support small local businesses, but when they cheat and scam customers, they don't deserve have their doors open.

804486,2010-10-26,0,QH1lePb3lwTKRF_OXH_6uw,"Went here for lunch today with a local who had never been there. Not a real good sign for me as she's also a chef that works in the nicer hotels.

I called while in the car and asked if they have avgolemono soup and the guy answered me, ''Pos den exoume?'' (How can we not have?). Perfect answer.

When you walk in the door, it's a bit dingy looking, like a NY restaurant that isn't very busy.  First impression wasn't so great. It's not that it's the worst looking place I've been to but definetly not the best. 

The waiter was great. Spoke Greek and almost perfectEnglish. Was happy to have a Greek in there as I'm certain, other than the other restauranteurs, there can't be too many Greeks here.

Sitting down, the place was very clean, the table was very well set and they even had cloth napkins!!!!!

We started with the tzatziki and taramosalata. He was nice enough to give us a plate of half and half. The taramosalata as really good, just thick enough and creamy at the same time. The tzatziki though, even though it had a crisp, fresh taste, was much too watery for my liking.

Next was avgolemono soup. It was great. Just right, not too thick, not too watery. Little pieces of breast spread out evenly.

On deck, calamari. These were some of the best I've ever had and in Vegas, of all places. Lightly breaded, soft pieces of squid, not too greasy, just perfect.

I had pastichio and she had a beef kabob platter as main dishes. Mine was really good, just a little dry but that's just my taste. I like the bechamel melting everywhere but no biggie. They had green beans on the plate that were just like Mama's, soaked in oil and tomato sauce with small bits of onions and peppers mixed in. The potatoes on the plate were okay but unnecessary with all the pasta already there. The piece was quite large as well. She said the beef kabob was great and she had 3-4 pieces of large beef with the aformentioned green beans and potatoes.

Overall, a great dining experience where I had very low expectations. I was glad to see that there were no slot machines in the restaurant as well. I think even the toilets have them here.

We should have gone with our initial assessment because we found it over-priced and boring. The Wait-staff was completely disinterested in us (i think she only had 2 other tables), pretty slow, and the food was just OK. Nothing fancy, no amazing plating, no super portions, just some food slapped on your plate like you get at home. 
The Decor was fine (pretty usual ""Big-fat-greek-wedding"" style of decor), there were cloth tablecloths and napkins, and the karioke music was cheerful overhead. But all this was somehow more than the food and service deserved. i was also really dissapointed that they were so dead because i was hoping for some dancing with other guests or even, best case senario, a bellydancer, (they have a picture of one on their site so I was excited) but nada.  
We had 1 bowl of the lemon soup, an order of the spinach turn-overs, main entrees were a chicken kabob plate (dry) and a veggie plate. My sister wanted the custard dessert, but we decided it would take too long and probably not be that good.

There were not many people in the restaurant when we arrived.  We ordered the saganaki (flaming cheese) as an appetizer.  They do the ""OPA!"" thing when they set it on fire, which is cute.  But it was just like eating a block of slightly warm cheese.  I guess I expected it to melt more.
 
I got the moussaka and my husband got the gyros plate.  The moussaka was pretty good.  The potatoes that came with each dish were excellent.  Nicely cooked with a lemon sauce.  The gyros were a little dry.  The gyros plate comes with pita but it's buried under the gyros, which I found kind of odd.

We wanted to try something different, and having grown up with Greek friends, I recommended we drive to Opa.  Even though I live in East Vegas, and it's on Rainbow across the valley, it's worth the drive.  We were warmly greeted by the hostess, who also doubled as our server.  I had just nailed a royal the night before, so money was no object!  so we started out with a round of Mythos, a clean, light refreshing Greek beer and since it was July in Vegas, we needed them!  I decided to order a round of both cold and hot appetizers, starting with the tarasomalata, Flaming saganaki cheese, and the  philhellene, charred octopus.  

The tarasomalata was the most incredible I've ever had, so smooth and whipped, and delicious.  The cheese was incredible, and the server lit it up at the table with brandy and a flourish of ""OPA!""  And of course the octopi was freash, baby, and charred to perfection served with olive oil and spices. Since we were there to take our time, I ordered another round of drinks and we all shared our food with each other. Even though it wasn't on the menu, I was told by the server we could make a combo out of the traditional favorites, which was fantastic, as I wanted to try as much as humanly possible! 

I opted for the pastichio, which is a Greek lasagna but with a thick béchamel sauce on top with tube pasta, and the dolmades, grape leaves stuffed with rice and beef.  One of my friends had the traditional gyros plate, and another had the roasted leg of lamb. All of them came with lemon and olive oil basted potato wedges, and green beans with herbs and tomatoes.  ALL of the food was outstanding, and the service was top-notch.  I was too full for desert, but my friend ordered the galactobouriko.  I had no idea what it was, but it was unbelievable!!  I tried to get another bite but was denied with a fork parry much like Napoleon was in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure eating ice cream with the kids.  The bill came to $120.00 which was very, very affordable for all the food and drink we had.

We were immediately greeted by the waiter who had a thick Greek accent. I don't know why but I always find it comforting when I go to an ethnic restaurant and find that the waitstaff has the corresponding accent. It gives me false security that the food will be authentic. In this case, the security was warranted because the food was really good. I ordered the chicken kabob and it was well spiced and juicy. I tried a bit of the other dishes that were ordered and they were all average to solid, the winner being the grilled pork chops.

The person I was with, a resident of LV, thought the waiter was a total jerk as well.  The cool part was that he forgot something (desserts or appetizer) from the tab...and we gave him a 10% tip.  I felt the combined ""discount"" was appropriate for his disgruntled attitude. 

The apparent restaurant manager was friendly; unfortunately, he wasn't working our table.  I read a couple of other reviews here citing poor service, which is inexcusable for a nice sit-down restaurant (not a fast food joint) and then see some reviews citing good service.  What's the deal?  I remember that the last time I was in LV, I drove past this place with my friend, and she said ""gosh, remember that waiter....""

2960653,2012-10-21,0,QH1lePb3lwTKRF_OXH_6uw,"This was a great ""accidental"" find.  We were driving around looking for a place and my wife caught eye of Opa.  Not one to turn down Greek food, I turned in and came into the typical, faux-Greek decor, all that was missing was the obligatory fake grapes hanging from the ceiling.

After reading the extensive menu, which reminded me of something printed by an old mimeograph machine, we sat and waited for our meal, roast lamb and spanikopita.  As we waited we were cared for by the staff who were not overly friendly, but pleasant and polite.  The rolls were hot and crisp and just the way we like them and the homemade salad was fresh and tasty.  

Finally, the wait ended and we got our main course.  It wasn't fancy by any means, it seemed more home style and homemade, which to us was a good thing.  In fact, it seemed like we had been invited into a Greek home, by a Greek family to partake in their home cooked dinner.  It was delicious.  We both had green beans that were wonderful and potatoes that were just like a Greek mamma would make them (though the lemon flavor was a bit too tart for my wife, I really liked the roasted lemon flavor of the potato).  

My wife had the Spanikopita and it was crisp and favorable with just the right mix or spinach and feta  and the filo dough was flakey and lovely.  I had the roast lamb, and it seemed that it had been lovingly cooked all day.  It was moist, tender and oh so very, very good!.

We had coffee and a Greek dessert which I really don't know what it was called, but it was flaked filo, with nuts, honey, custard and whipped cream, mmmmm, just right.  (I will admit, I am kind of a coffee snob, and so the weak diner style Cafe Americana disappointed me a bit).  

There was live music at  8 pm and we enjoyed the band of two for a few songs before we called it a night.

Next time I am hungry for Greek food, I have no questions as to where I will point the car...to the corner of Rainbow & Sahara and Opa Restaurant!  Yum, yum, A+, OPA!",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,0,0,5,AXfkDXnD71BG5e0n6uo4SA

I was sad to hear that but decided to try it by taking a friend of mine to lunch.  I raved about it prior, but I spoke too soon.  The service was slow and inconsistent.  We both ordered the gyro sandwiches which it clearly states on the menu that it's $1.50 extra to add a soup or salad.  It already comes with fries.  I ordered the greek salad, but it was more like a village salad.  Not like before when it came with a great small greek salad with lettuce, tomatoes, olives and feta.  The pita bread is no longer hot pita bread, but cold dinner rolls.  The gyro was too salty and the yogurt sauce was a salt lick.  At the end of our meal, I was charged $7.00 for the salad.  After I pointed it out on the menu, nothing was done.  Our server just said I ordered incorrectly.  Huh?  My friend was charged $4.00 for his lemon soup instead of a $1.50.

Had the pork shishkabob: juicy and perfectly tender. It was paired with great seasoned veggies and a potato side--both impeccable. Finished off with the custard dessert: delicious, perfect honey layer on top. Our cute russian waiter was very helpful. 

Con: I couldn't figure out if their gyro ""lamb-beef"" meat is cooked on skewers(and not processed crap) so I was afraid to order the gyro--my Greek mainstay back in authentico NY or visits to Greece, where gyros are either lamb OR beef.

The real low point was the very condescending and rude server who tended to disappear for long periods of time.  He only had one other table, so we knew it was not out of necessity.  Still, we were left sitting with empty beverages and dishes piled up to our elbows.  Since I was traveling for my job, I requested a separate check when we first ordered.  He brought one check.

4938625,2012-01-28,7,QH1lePb3lwTKRF_OXH_6uw,"Just got home from Opa and already writing a review... for a reason.  I don't appreciate the way I was treated this evening.  I came into Opa after purchasing a Groupon back in November.  After leaving a 12-hour day at work I had forgotten to print the Groupon, but of course I still pulled it up on my phone.  When the waiter came over to get the Groupon information he had another girl help him out... I handed the girl my Blackberry after pressing ""Use Groupon"" and the screen came up with a bar code and code written underneath.  The girl held my phone for a good minute and said ""I don't know what happened, it just went back to the main screen.""  My Groupon had been marked as used, which is what she intended to do... Then she told me she needed proof that it was marked as used this evening.  I went back to the ""redeemed"" Groupons and showed her, but of course there was no date next to it.  After explaining to her that she had hit marked as used and I had brought up the bar code for her she refused to take it, and walked behind the bar to make drinks for another table.  When I turned around and looked at her she was defensively bitching to the staff about me as if I had been rude, when all I was trying to do was show her the ""redeemed"" Groupons that I had.  I finally told them to forget it that we would pay full price and I would take it up with Groupon tomorrow to get my money back.  What a hassle after such a LONG day.  You'd think after all that they would at least comp us a dessert or glass of wine.    

SO: 2 glasses of house wine, which were less than mediocre.. a ""combination plate"" which was also less than mediocre, and a plate of lamb and potatos... which was also less than mediocre.  I would not rave about one thing about this place, I didn't enjoy a second of it.  (Not to mention, all of these less than mediocre items cost us a total of $75... I wouldn't have paid $30 for this awful experience) On top of the less than mediocre food, the waitress that was bitching about me and my Groupon circled our table, wouldn't make eye contact with me or my boyfriend, and had an awful look on her face.  Because of the Groupon situation she didn't refill our water until after our plates had been cleared!   I felt as if I was being mistreated and accused of LYING and trying to use a Groupon twice.  I wouldn't even go back to this place if they offered me a free meal because of this stupid situation.  The dinner was uncomfortable for the entire hour we were there and it wasn't even good.  Then right before we got the bill this awkward belly dancer came to our table and danced for us... Not gonna lie, she was also less than mediocre.

The 3.5 star average sort of tempered my interest too oddly enough.  I mean 3.5 is pretty favorable, but some strange mental tick in me has me severely favor those that get 4s and 5s over a 3.5.   Well let me say that I'm very glad I tried Opa! anyhow, because it's a WHOLE .5 of a star better than 3.5 to me!

My friend at work told me he wanted the Market Priced Porgy fish lunch entree which I'd never even heard of, and I was going to go with the Salmon.  When I asked about the Porgy the woman on the phone recommended not ordering it for takeout because she said it was better ""very hot""  I appreciated what I assume was truthfulness and in saving my friend probably $150 for a lunch fish (Pro tip: never trust ""market price"")   ANYWAY.  Went with two Salmon entrees instead.  The woman on the phone was very nice, but she never took my name or announced how long it would take.   Sure I could have asked for that info but I didn't so that was a little confusing.   Because of that I got there with plenty of time to spare before the salmon was ready, though the employees were very nice and updated me at multiple times about the order.   

Finally getting the food and back to my office, I was pleased to open up the takeout box to find a very healthy piece of salmon, what appeared to be a nearly whole baked potato sliced in half, and a giant piece of broccoli and some other assorted veggies.  It was all covered in a nice lemon/olive oil sauce.  Along with each order came two hot and tasty pieces of bread wrapped in foil.   The meal was a delight.   The salmon was perfectly cooked, and though the sauce was a little oily in texture, it tasted great.  The potato and broccoli were also cooked to my liking and the bread was some of the best bread-like substance (e.g., pita, etc) I've ever received take out from any restaurant.

It's very comparable to Hedary's Tilapia lunch special but I have to give the nod to Hedary's overall as it's slightly cheaper ($13 to Opa!'s $14) and comes with more (free soup or salad).   If I'm ever craving Salmon over Tilapia though it's nice Opa! can satisfy my cravings.
