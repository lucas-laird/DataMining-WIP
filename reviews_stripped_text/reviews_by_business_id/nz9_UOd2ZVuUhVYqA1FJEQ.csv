So my advice is not to go there unless you are totally healthy. Besides that. .the food certainly wasn't that great. No more for me . I'll go back to the great service and good quality of our favorite pizza place,beFqDUfYeLMUBtNJOvEqqA,2,0,1,uMq4XoKCDINLwptkJRjyAQ

But when I ordered a pizza over 45 minutes ago, and the guy who just walked in before me was just ordering his pizza and got it before me is a little weird. And then have to wait 20 minutes after my pizza was done to get breadsticks it's kind of bullshit. The guy at the counter Billy didn't acknowledge me when I came in, and started helping people that came in after me. Used to love this location.",a58EbU4jYlnPuEWUME0lWQ,0,0,1,qBkCrAAjoqn4nRswC0oRtw

I will never go to this location against, for being a new location with a 1 star rating, says it all!

Papa Johns,  do yourself a favor and hire new management and redevelop this store, because right now it's crap!!!!! Literally!",hWY534z1dIo_67ogS0l5hQ,0,0,1,s_Fbcq0MvFFCtnm0K57vkw

I walk in and he yells pick up or order in a very abrupt way needs some training, in customer service how about hi can I take your order? Or smile and thank you, he also needs some training in how to treat employees they walk in the door don't forget to wear towel corporate is in town! It was 19.00 for a large pizza very pricey! Asked about coupons he said no! I just threw out 5,000 coupons we don't offer them",Gi4c16UZR75pNmUKD2v0-Q,2,0,1,EiarULZjZ2x5k2VrGFuFZQ

I called and spoke with a manager to let them know. I trusted he would work on improving quality. Today we ordered the same order again and the pizza was doughy again...and this time 20 minutes late. Pizzas are coming not just a little doughy but very slimy and raw kind of doughy. Disgusting! We can't even eat it. I just wanted to tell the manager about the problem and he had an attitude and was very rude, he insisted on my information and I simply wanted to give my feedback anonymously. He kept talking over me demanding my info... I asked for the store managers name and he said he refuses to cooperate with me and hung up on me. I'm floored!! I will NEVER order from this store again! Management should no doubt be fired! If the store manager or owner reads this....you want results, start at the TOP! Either the employees aren't being trained properly or just don't care at all. Either way, management should be competent enough to handle the problem. And how he spoke to me...very unprofessional and disgraceful. Done! Lost our business!",oydv_ap7Bh-RZq9leO1wPQ,0,0,1,wamXi6ip51FHgfGvx11Q8A

My husband tried to explain that they were charging too much, but the person taking the orders was not very bright. We ended up at Metro Pizza instead, which was delicious! So, I guess thank you for such ridiculous service Papa John's.  Won't ever attempt to order here again.",4MWUvHzI1I0r2vwUyRgwRA,0,0,1,20Xo5DiPZvF0FBpnIew5Ng

I ordered a pizza with easy instructions and they still failed to send the right pizza... They forgot something on my pizza but because they had ran out! No one bothered to call and tell me, they sent the pizza as it was. Anyways I called them and a worker supposably wrote me down in a book and give me credit for one free pizza... He said he talked to his manager!! I called to place an order a few days later and there's no sign of that anywhere... Horrible service.

The pizza is ok, the service isn't the best, but we don't expect a lot from a chain, BUT this last experience was UNACCEPTABLE! So, bought pizza Sunday via online, the girl helping us clearly had no idea what she was doing. It took her several minutes to even just spot our pizza that she looked right at several times. We sign our receipt for $11.91 & go on our way. Well, fast forward today, I was checking our online banking & notice they charged us $15. I call the store. John tries telling me my total was $15. I explain I have my emailed receipt that states $11.91. He then takes a few minutes & says ""your total was $11.91 but you left a $3.09 tip"". I then reply ""I did NOT leave a $3.09 or any tip at all for a pizza that I picked up!"" They have an employee or employees that are changing receipts & OVERCHARGING CUSTOMERS! We're so disgusted & WILL NOT go to this store EVER AGAIN! BUYERS BEWARE",WvanLjQlrp1OBScCI5o4Qw,0,0,1,VePRTbMX8MIunBsmMIqytg

I ordered 2 medium pizzas, one pepperoni and half pineapple with light cheese and extra sauce, the other pepperoni and sausage with extra sauce. There was some sauce but not even to a degree I would consider ""normal"" let alone extra. Pizza wasn't cold but it wasn't hot. Received in about 45 minutes, which is twice as long as Domino's usually takes. They also called to ask my gate code, which i had provided online when I ordered (but appears they didn't print on the receipt for their driver). Guess I'll be sticking with Dominos - at least they seem like they give a damn.",0VferJTifP7KGV7vyX1PvA,0,0,1,NOUtbisSFE9nhgXmIXnG4A
5095111,2018-02-18,0,nz9_UOd2ZVuUhVYqA1FJEQ,"If I could give negative stars I would! We come here A LOT, I have four boys and they love their pizza. Lately they've been uncooked or burnt with cheese stuck to the boxes. Ordered from them a couple nights ago and my order was totally wrong and they said that they put it on our account that the next time I came in I would get the same order credited because they messed it up and all I had to do was order with the same phone number and they would see the credit. I went tonight and ordered like they told me to and they told me they knew nothing of this deal and shrugged their shoulders. The pizza was again uncooked yet burnt the crust, imagine that. So my order was not credited and burnt yet uncooked. Never again will I spend another dime in this place. Definitely need new management or something.
