1322293,2016-09-15,0,0N53m33GANYeHHl-s22d4Q,Port of Subs has very good sandwiches. This location is open until 2am and it's located within the Shell gasoline station. The sandwich preparer was very polite and generous with the sandwiches' fillings. This is a good place to grab a sandwich in the late hours.,yJRXtqos-BG-ScQ-xd3EkQ,1,1,4,wqYR6uv-laKfXhQTkOSJ3A

They are open late till 2am everyday of the week which is amazing when you have that late night craving!! This location was very clean and the employees were very friendly. I love the #3 sandwich which is turkey, salami, and provolone (I substitute with Smokey Cheddar). The toppings are always fresh and delicious. You have to get the mustard/mayo mix. This is a staple of a port of sub sandwich. Sooooo bomb!!!!",iN9ussjAnJ1CPfgjCkZwTg,2,2,5,Y0rc-kHWo1_iluxe5R5Qcw

They go above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need and more. I want to shout out two amazing employees who provide extraordinary customer service. Alfredo was able to accommodate a last minute request and was an absolute pleasure to work with. Also, Trevor went out of his way to ensure that we had everything in our order and his attention to detail is exceptional. I just want to say THANK YOU to the entire team at Port of Subs - Flamingo for all of your hard work!",JcPXaSA19aODLzlkZQLzfQ,0,0,5,ahIvL2X5KHhWGyIzFNOtyw

4156447,2014-07-18,0,0N53m33GANYeHHl-s22d4Q,"NOTE UPDATE ON BELOW INITIAL REVIEW:

Went in for a sandwich today.  I asked for it To be toasted and Reconfirmed with the girl twice.  She then made my sandwich and forgot so went ahead and toasted the entire sandwich including the MAYO.  I asked politely to have the sandwich remade and she said ""Fine, whatever ok"", she them proceeded to help the other people in line and said I had to wait.  Wow.  Horrible customer service and after 25min and no sandwich I left.

UPDATE:
The business manager replied and was sincere about addressing the situation. Impressed to say the least.  I will reply when I have the chance as weekends leave me not much time for this.  I appreciate the  reply and will get back to you and your questions this week.  Thanks",uaFOvyGPRvSETSS6Lk8-5A,0,2,3,kFAGGVXzTn1-FtQ-frJQ7g

It's in the back corner of the mini-mart of the Shell station on the corner of Koval and Flamingo.  It's within walking distance for me and is open until 2am which makes it an ideal stop for food as I'm walking home from the strip.  Small area that is always clean.",jzRgJRDNfY7llRZLS3EMGw,2,1,5,vVd2CUiiTZP9koxIrpqhGg

This place is located inside of another store. I went and ordered a sandwich and then noticed the sitting area was like a homeless shelter. Several of the tables were taken up by suitcases and a guitar. The homeless at the tables were not eating but I guess management just lets them hang out. 
The smell was horrible. Stay away from this place unless they clean it up. Sorry I stopped in.",r5Oc4CghWdiQspZdj3K2cg,1,0,1,hzYeDWFFcA5pE3Xn0VTKNA

Tonight, I was going into the store for other reasons, But, the man I see on the corner of Flamngo/koval got my attention. He has been sitting there for at least 6months. I stopped to say hello and asked if he was hungry? Yes he said. He said he liked tuna fish. The girl at the counter was awesome! She made him a kick-ass sub! 
Port O Subs, you have amazing employees! Thank you",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,13,16,5,J3oKL0w8ysD1olxcMKzNsg
