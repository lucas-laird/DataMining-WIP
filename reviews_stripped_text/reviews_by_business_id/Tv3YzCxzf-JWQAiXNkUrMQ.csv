Went across the parking lot to get some chocolates at Jin Ju (awesome chocolate btw...) and when I got back there was a large pizza waiting for me. Told them that it was a large and not a family-sized (I've been coming to Papa Murphy's since I was a little kid.... back when it was Papa Aldo's.... so I am VERY familiar with their pizzas and sizes). Both employees told me I was mistaken and that it was a family-sized. Didn't want to argue over what amounts to a $4 mistake, so I took the pizza and left. However, I won't be back to this particular location again because of this. I guess I should have taken a picture of the pizza to prove my point, but hindsight is 20/20. lol  I'll go back to the one on Hualapai and Tropicana even though it's a little further drive for me. This it the only time that a Papa Murphy's has ever messed up my order, and I've ordered a lot of pizza from them. Pizza was good though.... Papa Murphy's always makes good pizzas. :)",1nCovbBNgs1H3Y0JTSdCDg,0,0,2,9V-dFG0U4UPaBcGN3rZG6A

And then I walked into Papa Murphy's and I ordered my first pizza.... And I realized what a gem this place is. :) Never say never and always always try everything at least once!! :D

This location which is the only location I have been to was very very clean and almost sterile which I really appreciated I'm a food establishment. I was greeted and when I told them it was my first time they explained to be how they work. Very friendly! 

Ambiance 5/5
Service 5/5

So I ordered my pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms with jalapenos on half of it. And I got to actually watch them make it which was awesome! :)

I took my pizza home and baked it off following the instructions.... And it was delish! 

Now I know why so many people enjoy Papa Murphy's! Not only is it cheaper then getting pizza delivered it's tastier cuz it seems fresher. 

Will definitely be back. :)",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,6,5,5,PdRhTljeFEsVtfxvG1p70g
2529211,2017-06-04,1,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,"Decided to stop in and pick up a pizza because we received a coupon in the weekly mailer. It was nice to be able to customize it and select the fresh toppings you want. The thin crust was a pleasant surprise and was very good. When I checked in on yelp there we even saved an additional 20%. Once we got home, we preheated the over to 425 and 15 minutes later we were enjoying our pizza.

Enjoy the pics and try one for yourselves!",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,2,1,5,vA7-xfmm3uTGfKfle5UP4Q

2601215,2018-05-07,1,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,I am new to Las Vegas and have been to this location  twice. Both times I was greeted by tje same amazing friendly smile. Her name os Vernice I believe. And her work ethic and commitment to providing an amazing guest experience is awesome! As someone that works in the industry it is refreshing to meet someone so committed to providing the best guest experience possible. As a small business owner I believe these type of people are the foundation of which small franchise businesses like this hinge upon. Vernice gets it and I wanted to make sure she got the props she deserves!!!,lbHzw2yN8MfsWrjNOHSBug,1,1,5,t03SnqlpDpvdKGD6d05DNg

Went to pick it up, and had to walk away empty handed, because the cash is locked in the office, and apparently the manager couldn't be bother to get it. Never coming back! Going to Grimaldi's instead!",0051FFf7M1X1yttO3bq5yg,2,0,1,JLvJxP2Nf3MQup06LHxZWA
2746359,2017-10-04,0,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,"Papa Murphy's is a pizza place similar to those places that customize or create your pizza to your liking. The difference between this place and other pizza places is that you receive it uncooked and bake it at home yourself. 

I questioned myself, ""Why wouldn't I just go to a typical pizza place and get cooked pizzas?""

Their pizzas don't disappoint! They have great taste and all you need is to follow the instructions they provide. The pizzas I picked up were Chicken Bacon Artichoke and Thai Chicken. I bought the large size of those pizzas and they serve about 4-6 people each. 

The Rainbow location I went to was very clean. I told the cashier that it was my first time and was told that this was a take and bake type of place to avoid any confusion people might have about this place. She was friendly and offered suggestions on what she liked and what was popular with customers.

Will be back to try the other signature pizzas.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,2,0,4,FTAKjV48jeQuwsUj_e3Yug

3723164,2018-03-01,0,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,I love the pizza from Papa Murphy's but I would not go to this location at all. The poor worker was doing her best to get the pizzas made while people continued to come in. She was forced to work alone while a manager sat in the office  as she did have to run back there to get approval on something so there was someone back there. That person did not come put to help at all. This location is very badly ran and I would highly recommend using the locations on Decatur or Durango and completely pass by this one. No stars at all for this place tried to give no stars but app would not let me,O1Dfc3pZrSaqo7G6DZ2g4Q,0,0,1,osLufgfYAxbr48UECKzSEg
3931256,2017-02-10,9,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,"First off, I would like to say how impressed I was with the customer service. I will be a repeat customer in the future. Got the coupons in the mail and thought that I would give this place a try. Walked through the door and was immediately greeted with a smile. The inside is set up nicely. Modern decor with a great flow. By the door is a display case with pre made pizzas, various cookie doughs, cheesy bread, and sodas. Then on to the counter where if you don't know what you want, the staff is eagerly waiting to help with suggestions. I got the spicy fennel sausage artisan thin crust pizza. Fresh ingredients, vibrant colors, and great taste made this pizza a hit for me. I like the thought of having to bake my own pizza. Get a pizza in the morning and then put it into your fridge for future use. The timing of cooking the pizza is up to you. The bake it yourself cookies is a perfect compliment to the pizza. A variety of flavors to choose from!",zpwWpno3U-oZaG3AJuKqSQ,13,12,5,xm6gjjhb98vWD8gccJDN2A

5098420,2017-12-19,0,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,"Extremely sadden by the customer service we just received. A friend and I walked into the store at 7:48... place closes at 8pm... we didn't realize it was that close to closing time so we made sure to apologize to the two workers and even tipped $5 when we paid.
From the moment we entered the store, it was very noticeable that the workers were annoyed. We apologize many times and Matthieu, one of he workers, even made the comment after we apologized, ""yeah... we are only open for 9 more minuets""
We could even tell that they were complaining about us while they were making our pizzas..... after we tipped them $5 for 2 pizzas!!!!
Super disappointed :(

Update:
Changed to 4 star rating from 1 star because I was very impressed with a gentleman named Ryan that contacted me after I message the business about my experience. He apologized for the experience and horrible customer service I received and notified me that their policy is to keep their doors open 10 minutes past the posted closing time to accommodate late guests. He asked if the district manager could call me to hear about my experience. I spoke with Scott, the DM and was happy that he seemed very concerned about my experience as well. I enjoyed my interaction with both Ryan and Scott very much.",6VP0WEIBVPlwk3hUmlWObw,0,0,4,hjPCWeV4eEAOxgrWfpkUQw

I ordered my pizza online and was given a 25 minute wait time. When I arrived to pick it up the pizza was still not ready and had to wait an additional 10min, he was working on my pizza and literally stopped working on it and started working on the customers behind me pizzas. I asked him when mine would be ready and was yelled at by him. He said he had walk in customers even though I had put in my order almost 45 min prior at that point. Now he was working by himself but the owners/managers need to get their act together and hire friendly staff who can make fast efficient customer service a priority, cause it is papa Murphys meaning that the ingredients are the same everywhere you go.",HD7U8LvH6OC38-cwjOlehg,1,0,2,G_Zr5j2sg5A-mmzV_sCMlw

5736186,2018-05-16,0,Tv3YzCxzf-JWQAiXNkUrMQ,"Very disappointed!

We have been frequenting this location fairly regularly for the past year. Had a problem once before, problem resolved.

Today we brought home a pan pizza and cooked the pizza. The pizza pan had a liquid literally bubbling out of the pan as it cooked. The oil, butter or whatever the liquid was, was pourable out of the bottom of the pan and made the entire crust greasy.

A phone call was made and the problem described. My wife offered to send pictures if she did not have to come back. We were told to just Bring the pizza back (of course).

Upon arrival, Matthieu was less than polite and requested the pictures. My wife asked why pictures were needed when he had the pizza? He said, ""you said you had pictures!"" Matthieu then asked where the liquid was? My wife had explain that it was poured down the drain. (Because we would drive an extremely greasy pizza back in our car).

Customer service is obviously not a priority here and we will not be back nor will we recommend Papa Murphy's again!

Do yourself a favor and DON'T waste your money or time!",z5xJBWHVXh9XTyEUBWpQrA,0,0,1,1MbxzyNiBchqYcRUmsIe2Q
