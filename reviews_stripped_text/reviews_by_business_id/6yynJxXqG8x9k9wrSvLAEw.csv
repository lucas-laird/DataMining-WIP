170377,2012-11-16,2,6yynJxXqG8x9k9wrSvLAEw,"Stayed at the Tahiti Village hotel and ate lunch here once. No more. The hotel advertises this place as a restaurant and bar. It's really a bar that just happens to serve food. Mediocre food that is. Served very slowly. 

Fries were salty and very soggy. How can you screw up making french fries?? Teriaki chicken sandwich was undercooked and had a weird tasting sauce. The place had a bit of a strange smell to it. I think the only reason they get any customers is because it is right next door to the hotel.

Health alert: 
While waiting to be served I watched an employee working behind the bar. When a couple that had been drinking there got up and left, he took a towel and wiped down the bar. Then he took the same towel and started drying some drinking glasses and putting them away. Yuk!",mBM9OVO7SfR_ZI3bBWHzyw,10,0,1,fRyVUhc8XbN_WjF97OwXPQ

We're staying at the Tahiti Village (separate review)  and wanted a place to watch the Super Bowl without being over-run by 'niner fans. (we were both raised on the Raiders and they were out of it by October)

So we paid the $35 for ""all the coconut shrimp and appetizers you can eat), got our wrist bands and settled in.

At kick-off, everyone headed to the buffet line.  And there the joy died.  The ""coconut shrimp"" were tasteless, wilted, and barely identifiable.  There were other similarly unhappy offerings - some tiny deep-fried unidentifyable bits, nacho fixings - how the heck does one get that many half-stale chips together?  The little hot dogs were good as were the wings.  But if there was anything in that kitchen other than a microwave, a flat top and a deep-fryer, it wasn't in evidence.  

The single bright spot was the dude behind the bar named Randy.  Good guy, personable, kept glasses full and things going, despite his team getting crushed.

1. They sat us, a party of 5 pretty quick.

2. They took about 15 min. for us to just order drinks and cocktails.

3. They took another 25 min. for us to just order food.

4. By this time we needed refills on our drinks, and had to actually get up and request it.  When the drinks were brought over the waitor left the empty glasses on the table.  Would've been nice if he noticed that the table needed to be wiped down from the cocktail drink that was served dripping over the glass.

5. The soup and salad took another 35 min to get to the table.

6. By this time, we are requesting the manager.  My gosh we are starving here!

7.  This so called manager comes over and listens to the complaints, and well he is wearing a chef outfit ( i'm sure he is the chef/ or staff, management doesn't dress like that).  He apologized with an excuse.....Not professional......( apparently there was a wedding party that needed more attention than our tummy's)  Ok I understood his point, but if you knew you had 200 people for a wedding party shouldn't have you put more staff on schedule???? 

8.  He offered free dessert......didn't care about dessert.....wanted food !!!!!  eeek

The 5 of us ordered 4 different dishes, ranging from the flatbread to sliders to the grilled salmon sandwich. Most of our food dishes were fine. The last one they brought up completely wrong. When my friend asked our server about it, she was like ""uhh what's supposed to be on it then?"" We figured she was new, but was the chef also? My friend told her and they brought out what was missing on the dish.

When it came to paying for the bill, some of us were paying in cash and some by card. We wrote on the back of the receipt how much to charge each card and then had the rest in cash. Our server grabbed our check, gave it to the cashier, and then came back 5 minutes later asking if we wanted to split it on the cards. We said no, the amounts are on the back. She goes back to the cashier, then comes back another 5 minutes later saying that wasn't possible because the amounts we indicated aren't equal to any food items' amounts so it doesn't make sense and she didn't know how to calculate the money in. So then we explained to just charge the cards the specified amount, and then whatever is leftover, take it from the cash. She goes back, and then no longer to our surprise comes back and asks us if any of us knows how to use their POS system to do that. We're fed up by now but need to leave Las Vegas so we can get home at a decent time, so a couple of us go with our server to the cash register and helped them do our bill. 

So overall, food was fine but service definitely lacked. It wasn't crowded when we went in, yet the wait was still awhile for our food. The bill part though was just ridiculous. I wouldn't come back here again.",OyRuZzlyT-0_4bo8Qi1gJA,1,0,1,Oa2K1Z-70MYiKYsoXEDeuw

The decor here is very nice too. I can see someone put a lot of money into it. It's a new place so it's pretty clean. The tables are spaced out which I personally love.

What I didn't like was the table of about 6 or 7 consolidated resort/tahiti village sales people being loud and obnoxious the next table over.

The Deco gets a solid 2 stars. Nice wall treatment and good lighting. The Tikis, though, stink. Why not gets some handcarved tikis that aren't from Oriental Trading Co. And it's overall too ""put together"". You know, Tammy Bahama style.

Service was good, but kinda funny. I felt like I was being served by a sorority girl at her brother's Frat party. She didn't bring our drinks on a service tray, instead carrying one in each hand and making two trips (there were four of us). And she giggled very cutely when she spilled some of my drink on my coat, like that made it okay. Perhaps I'm just not the target audience.

We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip, which was too cheesy for my taste (I know, that sounds weird, but it's the only way I can describe it).  The kid's menu is pretty good, and everything costs $1.99.  Let me remind you, this is hotel food - nothing innovative or unique.  But it did taste good.

The service... pretty much sucked.  They have a lot to learn in the hospitality department.  The hostess took forever (restaurant was not crowded) to seat people, while she was doing gawd-knows-what, and the server was rude and mostly nonexistent.

It's no Frankie's, I can put that to rest.  The drinks are okay.  The decor is pleasant, and the staff, though not the most knowledgeable about the Tiki mug they sold (certainly staff has to have seen the mug at least once to be able to give better than a vague description of it), were friendly enough.

The food is... okay.  The prices are by and large under $10.  The chicken fingers I got were cool.  Not ""cold"", but they were not hot, warm, or even lukewarm, either.  The portions provided, however, were ample.

There are pool and ping pong tables, and a bowling arcade game.  The ping pong table was surprisingly active, and more often than not, I had kids fishing out a ball from underneath my table.  I don't blame the kids (they were polite and apologetic about their frequent visits), but the table needs to be moved more out of the dining area.

The restaurant was halfway full when we got there, and all but empty by the time we left.  Their food needs to be prepped a little more, and as a Tiki bar, I would think the staff would be a little more aware about their product.  I don't like pushy salespeople, especially during meals, but if someone asks, either show a sample, or be able to describe the item in some detail.  Or just have one on display, whether in the bar, or on the (actually very nice looking) menus.

I may try them again.  I'd like to get the mug, at the very least.  They have a good place they could work with, but they need to try and make the environment a lot more fun and inviting.  Trader Sam's in Anaheim come to mind.",H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,0,0,3,iApqMAt6A_Lx0s3-3yY0Wg

- clean environment 
- large TVs showing sports
- mood lighting

The thing is, it is the small things that really bring this place down. Things like:

- strange butt smell when I visited that was even mentioned by one of the workers
- no audio at all for the TV, so watching sports is less impactful
- completely dead even at 8 PM

It's not a bad place, and the location itself is very convenient if you're staying at Tahiti Village. The problem is, with so much potential, the place feels fairly depressing without people.

It was very empty when we went on a Friday night, but then again, we were off strip and out of the main action.
