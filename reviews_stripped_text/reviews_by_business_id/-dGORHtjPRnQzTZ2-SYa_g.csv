However the best part was fresh squeezed orange - it's why I'm giving 4 stars. Omelets and other breakfast choices are available.

965297,2018-02-01,0,-dGORHtjPRnQzTZ2-SYa_g,By far the best food in the food court the prices are great very cheap I've had the breakfast and it is amazing the prices are really really cheap compared to the rest of the restaurants for breakfast and they have deals I've also had to lunch as well the meals at $10.05 that is a great price. Although my favorite wrap must be the Gyro it's lamb and beef it is the best thing in the menu and the best seller. I love the customer service from the staff every time I go there I feel welcome they're all very very nice.,jxm7OcfrO6uXdQSUW6E8Qw,0,1,5,KOCCyNRb3t3bXteTGIIIQg

Everything is fresh made to order, I always get the chipotle wrap on a tomato basil tortilla.  It's like one big fat short burrito cut in two.  Their a little skimpy on the fries but that's ok. The fries are just like hooters curly fries and go great with their little Tapatio packets they give you.

Out of all the food court options, Great Wraps had the most promise.  We got a couple wraps - buffalo chicken and gyro.  Both were alright, but nothing spectacular.  The buffalo chicken wrap was way too sauced and it bummed me out.  The gyro was surprisingly tasty for what it was.

Gyro platter. The lamb was too salty for my liking, but the pita bread was warm and soft since they heat it up just before serving. Give it 5 minutes though and it got cold and hard so eat it fast. The tzatziki tastes like sour cream with no flavor. They offer olive oil for your salad. Comes with fries.

Like, very. And the thing is small as it is. And if you like your Z sauce with a little zing, be prepared for what tastes like plain yogurt. The guy in front of me ordered a Philly cheese steak. LOL. Looked like a slider. Even Subway does it better. These guys should take a clue from the Halal food carts all over NYC.

3968709,2014-10-25,5,-dGORHtjPRnQzTZ2-SYa_g,"After the Walk to End Alzheimer's at the Fashion Show, several of us decided to go to the food court for late breakfast/early lunch.  All of us opted for Great Wraps.  I stayed to watch our things at the tables and when some came back with their breakdfats from Great Wraps, I decided to go there too.

The breakfast special was $4.99 and consisted of 2 eggs any style, 2 bacon slices or sausage links, a bagel, and some hash browns.  The order was done in about 2 minutes.

The eggs were cooked as asked-over easy.  The sausage was standard and the hash browns were a oblong patty that was briefly deep fried.  The breakfast came with cream cheese for the bagel but it wasn't buttered.

The breakfast was OK.  A couple of things stand out.  In the need to be fast food, the bagel was only toasted a little.  I don't want it black but neither do I want most of the bagel to be just off white toasted.  Also, the hashed brown patty could have been fried a little more.  I guess to move customers along, the cooking is done a minimum amount of time.  

It was OK, nothing more.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,7,6,3,WBcCJRcV6kEEJf9q503_3w
