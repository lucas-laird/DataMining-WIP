251569,2016-02-12,1,-kbPPBNsIPDfMfgUGO7QhA,"my friend & I always come in on Thursday for drinks. I always play a maximum $60 or more on the machine. we ordered another round & were given a bill. The bartender was super rude & and gave us a bill. I understand my friend had to pay her bill because she was not playing.., but I had put $50 in the the machine., why did I have to pay. We will never come back. I wish I got the names of the bartenders who took over chrystals shift . .They are so rude. Ive been in the gaming business forever & I would never deal with these so called bartenders. (its a joke).Good luck, because your going to need it.. If you want good service, go to pts pub across the street, they no how to treat regulars. Kopper Keg, YOU SUCK!!!!!",N1J8I5nc2IjdaeMXcTysig,1,0,1,B3v9sT9CysXyEKtzwCZ1EQ

When I told you we were OK with our drinks, I didn't think I would have to text your personal cell phone to get your attention because that's where most of your attention was focused. We sat for over 15 minutes without drinks because when we hailed you down, your response was ""Oh, you guys are staying? ""  Gee, I thought service ended when we left the bar.  I guess not.  If you have a Sunday afternoon free,  choose a place that actually values locals and does more than comp 1 drink max.  The food is good and the venue is great for sports, but at $6 a beer, WHEN YOU CAN GET ONE, I would skip Kopper Keg.  And let me say, this is the 3rd and last try.  Even at different shifts, the service remains extremely poor.",PeMIZFop9JGU1DyxUWqt_A,0,0,2,nT78WQjMheOUD0yK4mM_5w

For the manager reading I give you this post in hopes to help your bar out. First off, the dollar a hand keno is too much for comped drinks, only bar I have been to that does this. The bartenders let you know you need to play a dollar to get comped. Second the bartenders should introduce themselves by name. There is also something about giving a little to get customers to come back, I see this at the very successful bars. I looked around and the bar was empty and hardly anyone was gambling. My friend asked to have the TV changed to a hockey game and the bartenders said no. I understand the bar business is tough, but I think the bartenders are hurting the business as we will never go back, remedys is a perfect example of why the bar is successful, the bartenders are great and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel good.",cchOSnclaZjyOPo_Hg24qw,2,0,2,2K5UG5Lvk01d-hzPqHJo-w

The service is poor and not very friendly both at the bar and with the servers. No drink specials when we went in and they charge way too much for drinks.

It's never really crowded. The restaurant area is small and ho-hum in terms of ambiance and decor. The service, though, (at least on Tuesday nights) is really great. The beers on draft are better than average. Their menu is fairly extensive with a good number of options. And while not tasty enough to crave, it's tasty enough to eat again.

3370371,2018-01-02,0,-kbPPBNsIPDfMfgUGO7QhA,The food ain't too shabby with prices typical of a local gaming bar. Drinks are average priced too. Service from the bartenders has always been hit or miss for me. The bartenders don't serve food so they aren't overtaxed like most bartenders at other places yet they tend to regularly ignore  and treat myself and coworkers like they are annoyed with having to refresh drinks. The guy server who serves food only absolutely is fantastic. Too bad the bartenders don't act like him. He should teach them a little about customer service. This place deserves 4 stars if the bar staff can be more attentive,1VsXRuhFNAZBcGcCeL_eeA,1,0,3,3wDCBFscYfGktFGI5q3HZg

3683121,2011-11-15,0,-kbPPBNsIPDfMfgUGO7QhA,"What a surprise THIS place turned out to be! My friend Brion and I were meeting for breakfast, and since he's from Vegas, he was picking. Well, the place HE picked wasn't open at 5am (which was when we were meeting) so I suggested the Kopper Keg because it was almost right across the street from where I'd just made a delivery, and it looked ""Open"". 

I parked my truck around back (lots of parking at 5am!) and he parked right in front of the door. Perfect.

Very quickly we were greeted my Sarah, a happy, friendly, and quick to laugh young lady who actually seemed to like her job. We got menus and made our selections. 

I opted for the Corned Beef Hash with eggs and toast. Oh, and country fries with it as well. Not sure what Brion ordered, but it was BIG, and he wolfed it all down.

When my selection came, it was PERFECT! The hash was crispy through and through (just as I'd ordered), and my fries were also well crisped - as I ordered. I'm liking this place already! 

This is a classy looking sports bar. There's TV's everywhere, so no matter where you sit you can see several. Each one has something else showing (football, tennis, golf, auto racing, baseball - you name it). I wish I lived near a place like this. I'd go broke hanging out there. It looks like it's a lot of fun in the evenings when the place is packed. But for our casual, intimate breakfast it was fine. We had a few years of tales to catch up on. 

Sarah made her presence known just often enough to refill coffee cups and water glasses. 

The menu looks fairly well represented by all sorts of options. I think if you can't find something here to eat, you should just quit eating...",OI8taAco53qGwEzbEtxmqw,2,0,5,SmprheYS4T6kapUEpWGteg

I know throwing sharp objects while drunk does not sound like a safe idea. That's okay, give me an electronic one with plastic tipped darts. Just give me something. 

Now that we have found a place to play, the drinks kept us here. A pint of beer is reasonable at $6. The mix drinks are better at $5. So a tab for four with food does not break the wallet.
