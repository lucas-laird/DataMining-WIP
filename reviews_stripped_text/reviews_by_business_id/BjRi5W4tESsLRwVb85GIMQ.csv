It located at the corner of a sort of ghetto  plaza, which makes me feel unsafe around. When I walked in the store, staff greeted me warmly but I m surprised that how hard the store tried to copy Brew Tea Bar. (Will they also copy King Fu Tea n Tea Space? Let me know, lol.) 
I had the highly recommended tea, strawberry matcha latte and It s definitely NOTHING organic or powder-free. How come a strawberry that red? It has to be cooked with whatever illegal amount of color ingredient. How come Matcha stuff made without powder?  It s water down n too sweet to cover the tea flavor or maybe no real tea actually used. Their other topping looks weird as they presented to me to prove their stuff to be organic.
Every boba tea is made with certain amount of syrup. That is the truth. If they try to promote their ""organic"" stuff, then they got to use serious organic stuff like whole food n be honest to their customers. Customers r smart! I rather trust they making tea with certain amount of syrup n try their best to use fresh fruit at the moment of purchase n production. 
ALSO, the container is NOT recommended for refill due to the #1 level plastic container regulation. It is NOT safe to refill with that kind of bottle. Finally, Hope they understand the definition of organic n don't try to fool the market. I d rather stick with Mr.Tea , at least they use real fruit at production n cook real tea daily.",NOzfwLyVYR7hhf3LJK2apg,0,0,2,PyRNyu_9laJLmBQ7nN1TBA

1030445,2016-10-11,3,BjRi5W4tESsLRwVb85GIMQ,"I have to admit, this is probably one of my favorite boba shops in Vegas. Boba drinks are becoming extremely popular and that means a lot of places are serving low quality boba drinks. Mr. Z is the exception because they have really master the art of boba drinks.

AMAZON: The Amazon Drink is their specialty! If you go here and don't try it at least once, I'm judging you! The Amazon is passion fruit and kiwi blended with boba. I was a little hesitant myself when I heard the boba is blended, but adventurous me tried it and loved it. I can honestly not explain how satisfying it tastes to have your boba blended in the drink. Definitely my favorite drink here.

OTHER DRINKS: They also offer the basic boba drinks like teas, slushes, and milk teas. But what makes me love this place is their drinks are really fresh and unique. They have flavors that you can't find anywhere else like the Kumquat drink. They have really flavorful drinks like the kiwi slush. For milk teas, I highly recommend the honeydew milk tea. Their drinks are all super refreshing.

SETTING: The staff is super friendly and helpful. I couldn't decide which drink I want and they kindly explained their drinks to me. There is a zebra painted on the wall and their are zebra statues everywhere. So cute! They even had a zebra balloon when I was there. Their are high top seating, but it's pretty limited.

*** 4/5 ***
  Walking into the shop, I felt that it had a nice vibe to it. It was clean, cute, and very picturesque. Their theme involved a lot of zebras... hence the name of the shop, ""Mr. Z Tea Co""...and I was definitely feelin' it since zebras are one of my fave animals hehe.  They have a nice mural of a zebra above the two couches on the left of the shop. 
  This place isn't really made for studying as there are only two small tables and some bar stools plus no WiFi (points taken off for that lol). I'd say it's more of a pick up and go type of place.
  This shop is located in a small plaza with other busy businesses, so parking isn't always easy to find, but they do have a couple of designated parking spots just for them in front of their shop for people who are on the go.

*** 3/5 ***
  Came here on a slow day. There were only about 2 customers (both busy studying) and 2 male employees on-site scrambling in the back. My sister and I walk in and we take a look at the menu. It was our first time so we had a few questions. We stood there for more than 10 minutes waiting for someone to pay us any attention. We saw one of them glance at us but continued to work on something in the back. My sister literally said, ""If they don't come out and help us in one minute, we're leaving"". I don't know if a little birdie whispered in their ear or what, but after she said that, someone finally came to help us. 
  After taking our order, they got busy right away with making our drinks. Took about 6 minutes to make them, no biggie. They didn't really smile at all or have the best customer service, but they got the job done.

*** 5/5 ***
  I ordered the Orange Butterfly Pea in the cute tall zebra bottle. It has a purple layer on top and then an orange layer on the bottom. I'm not entirely sure how it works but  I believe it has something to do with the specific gravity or (relative density) of each liquid. The more sugary and heavier the substance is, the greater weight and specific gravity it has -- also the more likely it will sink to the bottom(orange). But heck, what do I know. it's been a while since I've studied physiology/physics! Whatever the process is, just know that it was really good! Lol! Super refreshing + not overly sweet = My kind of drink ;)
  Anyway, my sister ordered the Winter-melon milk tea, half sweetened with boba and it was BOMB. The boba had a nice consistency (soft and chewy). The Winter-melon kind of reminded me of an almond milk tea but less sweeter. It was gooooood!
  I can tell their drinks are crafted with a lot of thought put into them. Lots of creative fruity tea drinks, milk teas, coffee, and slushies. We both really enjoyed our drinks!

 Seeing other reviews advising against the milk tea, we tried the pineapple lemon green tea (a daily special) with mini boba and the kumquat tea with regular boba. The teas were both on the sweet side but not overwhelmingly so, and I really enjoyed the special. The boba were a tad softer than I would like but still better than lots of other nearby options, and slightly sweet. In the future, I would request my tea less sweet.

My sister got the Taro slush and said it was a nice balance between creaminess and flavor! They also added a scoop of actual taro in the middle of the slush which I've never seen before!

My only problem is with the coffee slush. The flavor was a bit too strong and it was dusted off with ground coffee beans which gave it a grainy/sandy taste.

I ordered the passion fruit green tea with boba. The drink was pretty good. You could taste the tea without it being too overpowered by the passion fruit flavoring. Their boba was soft and chewy. It had a hint of sweetness but had a weirddd aftertaste. I did not like the boba.

Mr. Z is in the soft opening phase with the grand opening coming shorty per the cashier. Unfortunately the full menu is not available yet. Only menu items were standard powder slushes and a few milk teas. I got an oolong milk tea with no sugar and boba. The milk tea was decent. The boba is not cooked in longan honey like other shops however it is still slightly sweet. I'd like to try the Wintermelon oolong tea and the chrysanthemum tea when available. The interior is simple with the store having a zebra theme(hence Mr.Z) but one significant improvement is needed. Please get a garbage receptacle! Also Mr. Z doesn't have stamp cards.

No, really. This is a zebra themed boba cafe! Super cute decor-- I love everything from the fake grass on the ground to the giant zebra painted on the wall. This place is very instagram worthy. 

Now on to the important stuff... the drinks!

I had the red bean milk tea. I never had a red bean drink before, so I have nothing to compare it to but I thought it was tasty. It was just the right amount of sweetness. There was a good amount of red bean at the bottom of the cup, too. Delish! The boba was sweet and chewy. I would definitely order this drink again. In my opinion, I thought that the prices were a little high but then again this place made better drinks than some of the other popular boba places in the area. There are two drink sizes. We ordered one large and one regular and it came out to about $10ish after you add boba. Not including tip for the tip jar.

We came here around 8pm on a weekend night and this place was empty. The employees were helpful and brought out our drinks to our table, instead of just calling our names to pick it up. It is also very clean inside. Definitely a place you can hang out for a bit and enjoy your tea. I will be back!",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,11,12,4,iWstrGXeAUpY3Ea8KTJw7g

The place overall is nice to hang around at. The smell really doesn't bother me that much, though a lot of people don't like it. The size of this place is what really got me! It's bigger than most boba places which I like! It's nice and spacious unlike Kung Fu Tea, so you're not overwhelmed.

Was greeted by a gentleman.  I asked him regarding a grape slush I saw on yelp, and he said that it was seasonal, so it's not available or on the menu.  

He was really helpful with asking what kind of drink I was looking for. I told him i wanted something fruity.  He explained the difference and what was in the fruit tea.  Then while looking at the top 10, I noticed one called ""AMAZON"" so I asked him what it was.  And he explained it was passionfruit blended, along with boba!  It sounded really refreshing, so I went ahead and ordered it.

My husband ordered the watermelon green tea as that was the seasonal drink.  My mom ordered Amazon, but wanted only 25% sugar, as she's diabetic.

They took a while to make the drinks, putting love into each drink they produce.  The watermelon green tea was really refreshing.  Had the taste of fresh watermelon juice, then an after taste of green tea.  very interesting!  Even recommended Aloe as a topping.

The Amazon looked SOOO pretty, bright yellow, with pieces of black boba floating around (it tastes so awesome when it's frozen with the slush).  Had a strong taste of passionfruit.  Perfect tartness and refreshing flavour.  

My mom's amazon tasted just as good, I thought without the sugar, it would just taste sour, but no, it was just as refreshing without all that sugar.  Awesome place, and nice decoration!

Came here on a saturday night around 10 pm and they closed at 11pm.
It was EMPTY and we were the only customers (myself and my friends) Only saw one person working there and she was closing up (cleaning) and the barista.

Ambience was modern and cutie. The decor was 5/5. Fluffy life like clouds hung from the ceiling all around the store. A couple chairs that looked very hipster. LARGE painting of a zebra on the wall. And all along the table were cute knick knacks (some of which were zebras as well) Overall the inside was eye catching!

DRINK: Mr. Z black milk tea with boba (medium,50% sweet) $3.75
Ok so I know it's the end of the day, they are about an hour from closing, and it's empty but my drink was straight just WATER with a hint of milk and tea, the boba was chewy but obviously did not taste fresh and was end of the day material but it was OK. However the drink was terrible, no taste whatsoever. Not sure how she made the drink to be that watery. It tasted like she put a spoonful of tea. A cup of milk and filled the rest with water. 

Very disappointed with the quality of their drinks since it had good reviews. My experience may have been different if I went earlier in the day but I think it is disappointing how low grade their drinks are when it's past 10 pm.",Re_t7o_f67Jio-FKroOUlA,3,1,2,Z8Mc0Ec4N2g35KfkfyATmQ

I like the menu. Too much ice in our Taro milk tea Honey milk tea with boba. Next time should get a smoothie or blended kind instead.

Their most advertised real fruit drinks was the watermelon green tea and it was the one the owners recommended, so that's what I went with.  I'm really glad as I did as it was exactly what I wanted.  I watched them make it and they used multiple pieces of fresh watermelon for my drink.  They were able to find the perfect balance between the watermelon and the green tea, with both equally prominent and balanced.  I got it half sweet and it was just right.  It was super refreshing.

I also tried their pineapple apple green tea, also half sweet.  The drink was a bit more tart and a bit more sweet than I was expecting, but it was still quite good.  They again managed to balance the flavors of pineapple, apple, and green tea without any one component overpowering the others.  I was pretty surprised by this since it would have been so easy for the pineapple to take over.

The boba itself was perfectly made.  It was sweetened just right and had a great texture.  They also did something I've never seen anyone do at a boba shop.  The person who made my drinks actually used a tasting spoon to taste each drink before serving to me.  Impressive!

The owners are two sisters from Taipei and they're really nice.  The store is very inviting and there's plenty of space to sit down at a table or stand at the counter.

I ended up getting another watermelon green tea before leaving since I loved it so much.  Mr. Z's was exactly what I was hoping to find.  As the weather gets hotter, these fresh fruit and tea drinks will get more and more satisfying.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I know I'll be stopping by Mr. Z's.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,2,2,5,1RwTuz-dWLNVPAfm_jtUKA

The decor is so cute. They have zebra stuff every where and positive little quotes. The windows give it a welcome and warm feeling. I seriously took like 50 pictures in here.

Being the curious guy that he is, he spotted Mr. Z Tea Co and was saying how this could be a secret gem, a mecca of boba deliciousness. To me, Mr. Z sounds like a weird name for a boba place. Like Mr. Z computer repair or Mr. Z kids store sound more appropriate but lets see how it is. 

Setting: Already stated pretty dead plaza minus rincon, the store itself still smells like construction with ok seating but not really for hanging around at. Business seems very slow since when we walked in, the employees went to the back and turned the thermostat on lol (must be the owner's kids). I don't like that the garbage can's have lids that you have to pick up to throw away your boba, more work, makes my hands dirty. 

Drinks: The employee wasn't sure of a lot of the drinks and just said ""oh yeah thats good, oh that's good, yes that is very good"" I know it's a business but as a picky consumer i like honesty. My friend got the chocolate milk which was just powdered chocolate and coconut milk, pretty disappointing. I got the amazon which was passion fruit plus a kiwi syrup swirl and shredded boba. This was quite refreshing and the idea of shredded boba is an awesome idea. More boba places should think about having shredded boba as an option since people like myself hate having to anticipate the whole boba and then chewing chewing on it...

Overall: I'm not sure about the future of this place... It's really quite dead and to travel this deep into chinatown for boba when you already pass so many other ones. It's tough to say if Mr. Z will survive.",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,4,6,3,9lt0t5EjQNtfNSH2z3w_jQ

Based off of reviews I popped into Mr Z today on my lunch break. 

Mr Z is a cute little shop. A giant Zebra is painted on the wall, fake grass cover part of the floor in the establishment, and there is a huge wall of bricks on which you can write with chalk. 

I had my mind decided on what I wanted before I even walked in. Based off of reviews I knew that I wanted to try the watermelon green tea. This lunch outing had been pre planned you could say. 

My initial reaction to the drink was that it was really good. The watermelon was fresh in the tea, almost like a purée. 

The boba texture seemed off. In my opinion it was harder, more rubbery than I am used to. 

As I drank more and more I took note of a weird after taste. I couldn't narrow it down. Was it from the drink itself or that off textured boba? I made it about half way through the drink and then I tossed it. Whatever the taste was, it didn't grow on me.

I was told, ""this drink does not come with boba"" I explained that I know, that's why I requested that they add boba in both of the drinks I ordered. She gave me this confused face, and I think she was going to bill me again for the boba but at this point I was over this place and told her to forget it. Not even a sorry for the wait or sorry for messing up your order, this is very disappointing as I really wanted to go here on a regular since I work nearby. I'm glad there's twenty plus boba spots to go to....",nBssWrodnyH2iZ6hEI438w,0,0,1,ynCb6mu7ziXOh2IPqRt4zg

With that said, this place gets a 4* instead of 5 because of the customer service. I visit this place multiple times when I'm visiting Vegas, but each and every time the owner always seem to be in a bad mood. She seems to be there physically but not mentally. She's not mean but definitely not friendly and borderling rude at times when you ask her for recommendations or questions about the menu. 

The menu is really confusing, so if you plan on going, take a gander online prior to coming in because the menu makes no sense. They don't serve food or snacks. Only good quality flavored teas with all the toppings like boba, lychee, aloe, chia and others.

While Vegas has recently seen its fair share of new boba shops, they are mostly of unimpressive quality gilded with loud bells and whistles to distract you from the true meaning of a good cup of boba.  But not at Mr. Z. 

My go-to is the Mr. Z Boba Milk Tea.  It is perfectly brewed and mixed with just the right amount of milk but still perfectly sweetened.  A perfect milk tea boba shouldn't require the customer to dictate how sweet it should be; perfection is perfection.  However, if you are in favor of deciding your own fate, I mean, sweetness, Mr. Z is happy to accommodate to your liking.  And, of course, the boba itself is always fresh and perfectly al dente.  

Their Orange Green Tea and Watermelon Green Tea are also something to write to Yelp about.  I was a skeptic when I first saw it on the menu; orange juice/watermelon and green tea? What...? But don't knock it till you've tried it!  Something about the mild tendency of green tea flavor makes me wonder why I haven't heard or thought of these kinds of combinations before. And while I can't confirm if it's fresh squeezed orange juice, it most certainly tasted like it!  

The decor inside is simple chic with a zebra wall decor so huge that if you don't pay attention, you will actually miss it! There is something about Mr. Z in both its drinks and decor that soothingly amplify simple chic elegance. 

Located in the smack of Chinatown on Spring Mountain, right next to the Hong Kong Garden dim sum place; it doesn't get more convenient than this.  Worry about parking in that God-awful parking lot, you say?  No worries, there are two Mr. Z's patrons-only parking spots right in front, so park away and enjoy some tea at Mr. Z!",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,38,28,5,IU1yZu6Rw-A4YRdkwOOIQQ

It's a smaller cafe with limited seating areas; therefore, I would recommend skipping it for a study session and get the drink to-go. The decor is so, so cute. It's themed after zebras so there's a huge mural and zebra figures on the tables and bar seating. To make it even better, it's located in a less busy plaza on Spring Mountain and there are two designated parking areas up front. There are so many unique drinks. My favorite include the red bean milk tea with mini boba (yes, mini boba!), the butterfly yogurt pea (comes in a fancy container with chia seeds), and the watermelon green tea (normally not a fan of watermelon, but this drink is so refreshing).

The boba was very chewy and soft, except for the three or four that were super hard and catch you off guard lol. The slushie, tho, didn't have as much flavor as I wanted it to be. It was more ice than matcha. My adventurous sister got the Amazon slushie -- one of""Mr. Z Tea's favorite"". It looks very questionable (yellow slushie, brown dots, and a green something on top), but it's actually very delicious!

Since this place seemed to have a ton of pictures of their slushes and drinks with blended boba, I decided to try their amazon drink, which had blended boba. I have never had a drink with blended boba before, so I was like might as well try it! It was an interesting experience because instead of chewing on regular balls of boba, I was chewing on little pieces of boba throughout the drink.

5532446,2016-09-08,1,BjRi5W4tESsLRwVb85GIMQ,"I am a boba fanatic. When I hear about a new boba place in town, I HAVE to try it out and Mr. Z just recently opened so I had to give them a visit. It's located inside the Cathay Plaza at Chinatown which surprised me because that plaza has been pretty dead for years already. When I entered, there was not a single customer inside and the workers seemed very bored, no energy. The place is simple and clean. There's only a small bar area with chairs on the left side to sit and other than that, there's no tables when there's a lot of empty spaces which isn't an ideal place to really hangout at. Their only trashcan is this large Sesame Street trashcan where you need to lift the lid in order to dispose your trash which I wouldn't want to touch. I do really like the huge zebra mural on the wall though. 

Upon ordering, the workers seem like this is either their first job or they had no training at all. They didn't really have knowledge of the drinks or know how to use the register. I came here two times to give a second try and they always needed someone else to help them out. I understand this is a new business but the communication is pretty awkward. 

I wasn't sure what to try so I decided to order something I don't normally get. I got their Red Bean Slushie with Boba since it was a Mr. Z favorite. I was the only customer there and it took way longer than needed to make my drink. However, I did fall in love with this drink! It wasn't too sweet or too bland. They put real red beans on top and the drink is just savory. The boba can be improved as its more toward the mushy side than the chewy, firm that I prefer. I also like how their Amazon Slushie has blended boba which is a great option for those who can't stand the chewing/full texture of boba. The second time I came here, my coworkers ordered the Mr. Z Boba Milk Tea which taste like any other milk teas but also a watered down version. 

They offer a stamp card and are currently offering BOGO 50%.

I think I'll come back when I crave for the Red Bean Slushie because it is really good. Not sure if I want to try other drinks though.",gF1XjTQ2yiSJe28o60gozQ,3,1,3,YCv84sfzOURHVPB2TXml4w
