Oh yeah, way too much onion.",ENdK0I8ivAUEybel4r4v1Q,0,0,2,Nb99Md2tJyRcGMdy3dCJog

Definitely not a 5 star restaurant, more of a hillbilly food joint behind a bar. All they have is outdoor seating unless you sit in the bar. On a busier bar night or bike night not sure if I would bring my kid there but it wasn't to busy when we went so it wasn't to bad. Prices were average, $9-12 for a burger, food was great. As I said this is more of a hillbilly joint. So if you like fancy restaurants, this is not your place. If you like good food in questionable surroundings, this is your place. I would recommend.",3FzitnpsBQFjCyTU3WzruQ,2,1,5,DXiWJAcdzo2OyYcGrV3Q8Q

Burgers are always cooked to death(redgardless of health dept cooking temp regulations that everyone else sticks to and doesnt overcook) so opt for other choices.",XxyyTYuL7KrrBFg8a14bEA,0,0,2,3wJkqj5FY14aq3_Ja9N7QQ

The food is great, the prices are right, the atmosphere is totally relaxed, we love that bikers are in and out of the area all day, it's just good fun.

I ordered the portobello mushroom burger and was very surprised how excellent it was! My hubbs got the beer burger and he was impressed as well. The food was served hot and fresh and the mac salad is MONEY! 

Take a drive up to the mountain and stop on by, really, you will thank me.",Ulu3wyEJCry7MLhAK3lsUw,0,0,5,7KiBWa1xBidVtQVsqCHH-w

They offer mozzarella cheese, egg, grill a Jalapeno for you, anything you want on top. Texas beans are also amazing with it. They also make their own BBQ sauce! 

Take a nice drive up and out of town into the beautiful spring mountain range and make this your secret spot to take your friends and family like we do. And shout out to missy at the bar for always being on top of everyone, same to the guy with the LA hat. They are both super nice and make you feel welcomed and quick to serve you.",pPgjYOda6PFDG_hVVVRrEw,1,0,5,MEewZJS3RS4YPxcH3wr5Tw
