6654,2011-08-31,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"OK, I have been here before and loved the food, and my daughter adores this place as well. I was a little hesitant because there was a review posted that made me uneasy, I am Caucasian and my daughter is bi-racial. I have been in places where both she and i had been discriminated against and it is hurtful. I will say when i came in here today, i was immediately greeted by Jasmin (?) I hope I got her name right. She was so helpful and took our orders right away. I had a restaurant.com certificate and i wanted chicken and waffles (my daughter loves Roscoe's in Pasadena and I wanted her to have them here). Jasmin suggested we get the chicken and waffles and in order to utilize the value of the certificate she recommended the smothered chicken as a to-go order. The food was brought out fresh, hot and delicious. No attitude by anyone that I was aware of, if anything, they were uber attentive. She even got us our drinks to go. Nice touch. All the food (and there was a LOT) was so delicious. I will definitely be coming back more often. everyone has an ""off"" day and poor service and rudeness are inexcusable, but I am happy to say that M&M treated me and my daughter like family. I can't wait to try the chitterlings next time..",GZI0VPDn2FXvq-SQJckrTg,2,0,5,8Kc_tJyqgdf2DHzRivVdfw

I thought the full plate was a half plate. This place is not bad, but overpriced. The food isn't Michelin quality. If the prices for meals were cheaper then I'd go as high as 3 to 4 stars.

Food came out quick. Servers were average in noticing needs of diners. Servers were always in a hurry...not looking at diners when asking questions and halfway off to their next task before an answer was given.

Friendly atmosphere.

134006,2014-03-26,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Was in the neighborhood and decided to check it out. I had the oxtail dinner with a side of mac n cheese, dressing, and collard greens. and sweet tea. I will review each item individually. 

Pros:
1. you are greeted immediately as you enter by friendly staff
2. I received complimentary pancakes

Cons:
1.wait. Took me five minutes to get my drink. I came in at 430 didn't leave until 5 with my food that i ordered to go. the menu does state extended times for fried dishes though
2. small portions for certain dishes, (oxtail)

Now onto the food:
1.Oxtails- I am Jamaican and we make oxtails differently but I wanted to try them southern style. I was a bit disappointed. There was mostly fat on the bone and I know oxtail is not the cheapest of meats but i should not pay near twenty bucks for a meal and get kiddie portions.
2. mac n cheese- it was nothing spectacular. You could tell whomever made this batch put way too much Lawry's season salt in it. because that's all I could taste. 
3. dressing- it tasted great but was a bit too mushy for me and smothered with gravy on top. The oxtails already had gravy and then more gravy was put on the dressing, too much gravy for me.
4. collard greens- again, nothing special. needed some more flavor and spice

5. sweet tea- I ordered it and got it in this little mason jar. Um, hello, I'm an adult. a bigger glass please. It was OK tasting as well.

lastly is the complimentary cornbread pancakes, or whatever you want to call them. I was puzzled by this. Since when does a soul food restaurant serve cornbread pancakes? What ever happened to traditional cornbread served square? And they were so thin!


Over all this place get 3 stars. idk about A-ok, it was just OK. I will return again though and try something else on the menu. this place isnt horrible, it isnt faboulous either.",X4AM6vN3cXY8DYKO59lp-g,0,0,3,x86YvwldDXC5crsCKwocEw

Sooo, you're charging almost  $15 for Catfish, when everyone knows that Swai is $1.50-$2. a pound? If that's not bizarre, crazy, and deceitful, then what is?? The you lady stated that if the customer asks if it's really Catfish, then they tell them, otherwise they don't say anything.

We ordered catfish, chicken wings, smothered catfish and my husband couldn't decide between the catfish and the snapper so the server suggested trying one filet of each, needless to say he was very happy he took her up on her suggestion.  But wait, I missed an important part, as we were sitting down, they gave us hot cornbread pancakes. I've had cornbread, I've had pancakes and I must say....two great tastes mixed up into one(where've I heard that before?). Everything was really good. Our sides were yams, greens, cabbage, red beans and rice, fried okra and Mac & cheese. My only critique is of the red beans and rice, I like juice and they were a bit dry, but the flavor of the beans was really good. The cabbage had too much black pepper for me, so I just took my husbands mac and cheese and gave him my cabbage and he loved it. Mac and cheese was really cheesy and creamy, the greens were delicious, the okra was ok, needed some seasoning but had a nice crispy batter and was fried perfectly. My cousins smothered pork chops were so tender and flavorful she really didn't need a knife to cut them...enough said? Fish was flaky and well seasoned. Yams were delicious, not overly sweet, but very mellow. Oh and did I mention the RED KOOL AID? Get it mixed with the lemonade, delish!!!! The food here is really good! So if you have a hankering for soul food, go to M & M's. I'm really sad that I had to knock off a star for the dry (ish) red beans and the peppery cabbage, but it's just my personal preference. Someone else may love it that way! Oh well, I guess I'll just have to go again to see if anything has changed when I come back to Las Vegas.",8zsJK1pVoQ6sqSLvYvA7GA,0,0,4,ZO7ZjXbdnFLa3nWhIXU-lA

I had the smothered chicken with black eyed peas and mac & cheese.  It was delicious and the portions were large.  I could only eat half and decided to take the rest back with me on my drive back home.  I wound up eating the leftovers for dinner that night.

And I know I will get people saying something else is better but this is MY review and what I say goes! Haha!!!  I usually get the Fried Chicken Breast (it takes 20 min to cook and it even says that on the menu) which is the most succulent luciously mouthwater peice of chicken that I ever had the honor to put my lips around (yes, I just said that!).  Also the cornbread pancakes are sooo AWESOME!!!  I really don't know how else to put it, but I think it's because they make them in pancake form that it gives you the light, airy, crunchyness and moistness that you want from normal cornbread but that normal cornbread can't deliver (sorry normal cornbread, I still have love for you though).  And of course you have the sides which are GREAT!!!  You can't really understand it until you've tried it, so get crackin!!!!

The order:
Fried chicken with side of gravy. It was crisp and fresh but lacking in flavor. Gravy didn't have much flavor either I added a ton of salt.

Sweet tea- listen to our fellow Yelpers and get the muddy water. Better than the sweet tea.

Fried oka- AMAZING! I have never had okra before but it was small and crisp and we fell in love.

Mac & cheese- meh

336309,2011-12-05,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"M & M Soul Food Cafe is one of the BEST, most satisfying dining experiences I had in Las Vegas. I would never have found this place on my own (located in a super-tacky strip mall), but thanks to a foodie friend who is a Las Vegas local, we went. I ordered the short ribs, sweet potatoes (yams), and greens. She ordered chicken wings. OMG! everything was amazingly delicious. 

The nice attentive efficient waitress starts you out with two light, delicate cornbread pancakes that were slightly crispy on the edges, and slightly sweet,  tender, full of fresh flavor -- just amazing. Like getting perfect dessert first!

Everything we ordered was way, way beyond expectations. Mac and cheese is just what you hope it will be (but in most places never is). Greens and yams perfectly complimented the melt-in-your mouth short ribs. The vinagar-based hot sauce on the table provided that touch of sharpness that made all the dishes exactly satisfying. All portions VERY generous. Chicken wings were huge and the best chicken I've ever eaten.  

One negative: Ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. Both were bad -- pudding tasted like 'Nilla wafers and pudding mix; cobbler was canned peaches with tough crumbled up pie crust (my guess). Both desserts sickeningly sweet and clearly made out of processed food.  My foodie friend told me both desserts were standard African American nostalgia foods and were exactly what AA people would expect them to be.  Whatever. 

Service: Excellent
Dinner food: Beyond excellent
Dessert: Sucky
Price: Very reasonable considering quantity and quality.

You're not there for the atmosphere, it's all about the food that definitely feels like someone cared about making it.

The fried chicken was one the best I've ever had.  It was not greasy whatsoever, skin that just melted in your mouth and yet the meat stayed moist and juicy.  The fried okra and greens were a perfect side to the chicken and the yams were basically more like dessert.  I'm not sure if they are normally supposed to be that sweet (not sickly sweet though) but I think it still worked well as a side dish.

Gumbo was stupidly good and pretty large for a small bowl!  If you order the large, be prepared to share as it's very substantial.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they made the sausage but it sure did not taste like anything you could buy in a store.  It was nice that they used real crab in it instead of the cheap imitation stuff.

Right off the bat, I could feel welcomed as the waitresses and even the owner welcomed us in.  Everybody was so kind and genuinely cared about their customer service, so it showed.

My friend ordered his usual, the oxtails and I ordered the smothered chicken.  We both had the mac & cheese sides, as well as the red beans and rice and collard greens.  I also ordered a side order of hot wings and some sweet tea.

While we were waiting for our meals, they serve you these amazing corn bread pancakes. They were piping hot and had just the right amount of sweetness and crunch along the edges.  When our entrees came, I couldn't wait to dig in.  I tried my smothered chicken first and the chicken was still crispy and so hot and juicy.  Then the gravy hits you......omg that gravy.  So tasty.  I had a bite of my friends oxtails and they were amazing as well.  Not too fatty, super tender, and swimming in that wonderful gravy.  I also loved the hot wings too, as they were incredibly crunchy, juicy, and quite meaty.  I thank my friend for introducing me to this spot.

*** On a side note, I know that the owner fully understands and lives customer service.

I always order the fried chicken with fried okra, red beans & rice, and collared greens as sides on my first visit, and mix it up on the second visit. One friend always gets a bowl of gumbo (served only on weekends).

As a starter, the cornbread hotcakes are amazing.

I've never been disappointed by their chicken. It's perfect: not too dry, seasoned throughout, with a delicious crust. I suspect that they brine the chicken, since it has a nice, subtle flavor in the meat. It's some of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, and judging by my shape I've eaten a lot of fried chicken. Per my friend who orders the gumbo, even after four years at Tulane he's never had a bowl of gumbo so flavorful and delicious, and once told our server that he'd put it up against any gumbo he had while in undergrad. The gumbo doesn't come with sides, but my friend likes the red beans & rice so much that he always orders a side with his gumbo.

M&M is on our permanent itinerary when visiting Vegas, much like hitting up In-N-Out for a burger and Trader Joe's to buy stuff for family & coworkers. The staff is friendly, the wait minimal, and food delicious. Prices for entrees with three sides are reasonable, and it's easy to get to, right on Charleston in a small strip mall.

This place has been on my list due to southern fried chicken and sides.

I was greeted immediately and received great service throughout.  It was the the trickery of the menu that soured my taste.

I ordered the half order of 3 piece fried chicken. Waitress asked me if I wanted dark or white meat. I asked for a mix and she said sure. Menu says that white meat would be a $1 upcharge so I knew I'd likely see this on my bill.

Dish arrives with two pieces of chicken (1 leg and 1 wing) and my two sides. Why only 2 pieces? I thought maybe the ""half order"" was only two pieces so I went with the flow.

Chicken was great as were the sides (cornbread dressing and string beans).

I get bill with $1 upcharge for white meat so I tell waitress that I was charged $1 and only received 2 pieces, a leg and a wing.  She tells me that a wing is considered white meat. Dude, really? So bill was $11.88 after tax (without drink) for a leg a wing and two sides.

I certainly have the right to feel cheated in my opinion.

This occured on June 18th, 2011 my Vegas road mate decided to try out this place. So we walk in and were told to wait and we did so. Then we were seated with no menus, so we sat there just to see how long it would take before we were given a menu. 

The black bald head male waiter said he would give us a menu and he never did. Finally after a few minutes a waitress gives us our menu. Now usually when you are seated the waiter ask if you would like water or drinks. We were not ask this. 

Now as we are waiting a couple comes in and they are serviced before us! Then the bald head waiter who is a table behind us says 

""Yall want a drink or something while Yall waiting?""

Well I thought that was standard procedure from the start. We ended up leaving and going to Eggworks.

I am from Chicago visiting Las Vegas and read the reviews about this food which seemed to be favorable. The food was so tasteless and unfulfilling. We order mac n cheese (must be velveeta- yuk) which was dry and separated. Greens favorless, Sweet potatoes not sweet and were very dry. Ordered baked chicken with dressing  (no dressing came home with my order), Fried okra (also was forgotten by the order taker).The side of green beans ($5.50) tasted like canned beans.  I was told that the catfish was just sub-par, nothing special. The rib looks to be dry.  This was soul food w/o any soul at all.  I am so disappointed.  I spent over $50.00 for three orders that I could have easily cooked myself but I am ill and needed food that was already prepared.  Would not recommend this place to anyone as I think the food was nasty and the service (order taker) was not fully capable of using her listening skills.

Pork chop - Was on the smaller side, but very good flavor
Greens - Were okay, probably won't order again. A bit too sweet and over cooked for my taste My mom's collard greens have spoiled me. 
Macaroni - Again, it was okay, Not really cheesy or anything, but I would order again.
Cobbler - Way too sweet and was not warm when I got it
Sweet tea - was good, probably would have made it a bit sweeter, for the fact that they put ice in it

Mashed potatoes/Gravy, they were okay but again lacking in seasoning.
Collard greens, according to the husband, absolutely fantastic.
Cornbread stuffing, unfortunately some of he worst he's had.
Macaroni and cheese, it was okay, but rather dry (could be because we got there just before closing).  Wish it had been creamier and a bit more seasoning.

I had Cherry Kool-Aid to drink, and the first sip immediately brought me back to my childhood. I love how food/drink can do that to you. Unlimited refills, but $2.50 seemed expensive for just Kool-Aid. They serve cornbread... in pancake form! Kind of quirky at dinner but I like quirky and they were actually really good! 2 thin pancakes served on a plate per person. It already made me want to come back and try their breakfast menu. I ordered the BBQ Chicken (white meat, 1/2 portion) and it was delicious. The meat was really tender and fell right off the bone. I wouldn't say it was actually BBQ chicken, but rather chicken they made and poured some great BBQ sauce on top of. I just wished the portion was bigger for the price. All I had was a tiny breast and tiny wing under globs of sauce. My husband had the meatloaf (full platter, which is 2 slices instead of 1) which was very bland and unimpressive. As for sides, we liked the fried okra, yams (really sweet!), and rice & beans. The mac & cheese and black-eyed peas were just okay. I would've liked to have tried their dessert but we decided to save that for our next trip here.
The service was friendly and somewhat attentive.

We were greeted by a very nice waitress and given our plates of corn cakes...which kept coming out as soon as we finished them.  I ordered the baked chicken with stuffing and string beans.

They each ordered the mac and cheese but said it wasn't that great.  I don't know for sure because I don't dig that stuff myself, but it's interesting that all three said they didn't care for it.

I ordered the fried chicken (white meat) with sides of fried okra,red beans and rice and the mac and cheese with iced non sweet tea and my buddy got the smothered chicken with the same sides. The menu says to allow 20 minutes for fried foods. ( That right there means it's all prepared FRESH!)
The waitresses here are absolutely the nicest servers I have encountered in Las Vegas thus far! 
They first seat you and bring you out corn bread like I've never seen before. I'm used to skillet style cornbread and they brought us out some little cornbread pancakes. We ate ours so quick that the waitress brought us more and she said we should put honey on them, which we did and dadgum it was AMAZING! Once we got our food the sides were in little bowls on a plate to keep them seperated. Then came the chicken.

1062964,2007-10-01,3,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"I must start by saying that I am one who is prone to wandering. A former GF would say nosy, but I prefer to think I'm observant. At any rate, I am driving down the street (wandering after my trip to WalMart) and see a rather unremarkble place with a red sign-- M&M Soul Food. 

Now I'm driving a full size dually pickup with CA plates, so I'm not about to drive over the median like Myke R. So as I'm driving around the block, I'm thinking that it's a bit early for dinner and maybe I should keep driving. But I live in LA, so when will I have another opportunity? Indeed.  

As I walk through the door, I am welcomed by a man who I think is a patron sitting at the counter. He invites me to have a seat anywhere. Odd, but still, I'm thinking ""what a great place where patrons welcome each other..."" Further observation leads me to believe that he may be the manager but I'm not sure. Sittling beside him is the armed gentleman that Teri C. mentioned. Being a gun guy, I recognize the make and model of his pistol; what I find odd is that he's wearing a red and blue muscle shirt and baggy pants. WTF-- that's no security uniform I've ever heard of. Odd, but not intimidating.

So I order a fried pork chop (half order-- it's a bit early for my dinner, remember) with mac & cheese and red beans & rice and a sweet tea. My waitress brought me a couple of corn bread pancakes, sort of like hushpuppies that got smashed. My pork chop comes rather quickly, definitely less than 20 minutes mentioned. I've never had fried pork chops like this, and it was good! Nice flavor, cooked through, yet still juicy. 

The red beans & rice were unremarkable, but is that a bad thing? I like red beans & rice and I liked them here. Mac & cheese is a different story. People can be very particular about mac & cheese-- cheese was good but mac was too mushy for me. 

Since this was not really a dinner, I didn't order a dessert. I'm intrigued enough to come back to try the ox tails, short ribs, sweet potato pie and banana pudding!",zPofP4KU6kHDxY7cpBulSg,3,3,4,PzE4NiSsB5ypamP_kGVvhQ

For some reason half of the restaurant was hot and while the other half was nice and cool.  After awhile it began to feel uncomfortable.  My cousin and her husband were already seated and waiting for me to arrive.  Once I came, it took the server awhile to come and ask for my drink order.  My cousin's glass of water was empty and you would of thought she would have refilled it when she brought me my drink but she didn't.  She gave us more than enough time to look over the menu.  We ordered and the food took forever to come out, but we were okay with that.

I ordered the half size cat fish plate which came with two sides.  The fish and mac and cheese tasted great but I didn't too much care for their collard greens because they must have had sugar in them.

I would have given it 2.5 stars but it wouldn't let me.  I'm real big on service and my server wasn't the best.  She never came back to check on us and we had to flag down another server twice.  I planned on ordering dessert but she never even came back to ask if we wanted any, so I didn't bother getting any.  While waiting to pay for our food, our server and one of the cooks decided to argue about orders out loud and super unprofessional.  We asked another server if she could just check us out but she said ours had to be the one to do it.  She called out to her two separate times to get her to help us.  She finally came and gave us the bill and didn't even thank us.

For a beverage, I couldn't decide between the sweet tea and the lemonade, so I got the muddy water, which is a mix of the two.  That was refreshing.

Get the Muddy Water (tea & lemonade). So good! The corn cakes that come at the beginning of the meal is complimentary and is much better than any place that tends to serve dry cornbread. The fried chicken breast was moist with a perfectly seasoned crispy skin. The porkchop is a must when coming here. We decided to get it fried and not smothered, but added a side of gravy so we can dip it in. I hear just getting them smothered is just fine, but I personally like having the porkchops arrive crispy initially and then dunk it in sauce.

One would think that an order of shrimp and grits would be a quick preparation. Well, I finally got a bowl of bland instant grits, warmed up salad shrimp, and a few sprinkles of something green on top. Even salt and pepper couldn't spice this flavorless dish up. Yes, those were the only ingredients!

Service was as horrible as the food. The waiter stopped by once to ask if I was okay. As soon as I looked up to answer, he turned his back and walked over to another table.

Also, I do know the place is small, but please I ask you; why would you abruptly remove a chair from my table and scratch my feet in an effort to accommodate a party of about twenty folks? Yes, my table was now in the middle of that huge party!

Ok disregard the inside also and lets concentrate on what's really important,the food!
We were here for breakfast but didn't realized that breakfast is only served at certain time in the morning so we ended up ordering something else from the menu. This was our first time in an all soul food restaurant aside from Popeyes fried chicken so it took us a while to go through the menu to finally order their very popular fried chicken and waffles. Service is good but a little bit disorganized when they get busy, we were asked what we wanted to drink about 4 times from 4 different employees and we got the food before our drinks. The fried chicken was very good, it was crispy and moist and the waffles were outstanding, the thing is there are so many places that serve good chicken in town I'm not sure I'll be making this my number one fried chicken destination. I know, I didn't ventured enough and tried something more soul-ish like the liver and onions or the Chitterlings, maybe I'm not much into the soul thing, but I do want to come back sometime and try the seafood gumbo, but for the meantime I'll just stick with some chicken soup for the soul.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,4,4,3,ffIMTJr-Gq1rVUejJTaQhQ

Okay, you have my attention!

Drove past this place several times and couldn't tell if they were open- found favorable reviews on Yelp and headed in the very next day with the BF. We were immediately welcomed by two lovely ladies who were super friendly throughout our visit- though sadly their names escape me.

I ordered the half order of smothered pork chops with sides of mac and greens, while BF went for their chicken and waffles. While our order was being made, we received the famous sweet cornbread pancakes- and sweet they are! Warm and tasty, but yes, super sweet- as is the muddy waters beverage my guy was drinking.

Orders came in, hot in fresh out the kitchen...
The chops are amazing. Second only to a fabulous place in Texas, but they're not kidding about that ""world famous gravy""- it's downright decadent. Cant even find words to describe the flavor, but it's amazing. The chop was a good size and cooked well, too. Mac was a little on the dry side, and the greens were way too salty for our tastes- they may have been canned? In the future I'd just opt for two chops a la carte, but I'm a total glutton...

BF had the chicken and waffles and raved about them- I took a bite and the waffle was super sweet, and tasted like it was made with brown sugar. Yum, but too sweet for me, let alone for an entree. The chicken was good too- very crispy. BF says is the best chicken he's had in a damn long while. And he knows his chicken.

Would come back again, likely sticking to the chops for me. They also have a breakfast menu til 11AM- might have to check that out.

Seemed like it wasn't in a great neighborhood. We saw bullet holes in the windows. That's a scary thought but at least windows were darkly tinted. 

The nice lady gave us menus and wiped down our table. The ladies here were working hard. Busy place, so that means something. As I browsed through the menu, I decided to get the fried chicken meal, Half plate which runs around $11.00 and includes two sides. They charge extra for white and dark meat so make sure you get one of the same. For the sides, I got fried okra and potato salad. The potato salad was a little tangy but good. The fried okra was good as well. Not too greasy. The chicken was a little over cooked because when I tried to cut it open, the meat was dry but I enjoyed everything else. I had literally like 3 refills. The mason jars were small. 

Our service was excellent which is why I gave them four stars. I definitely liked the service here. Ladies were friendly. I enjoyed the vibe inside as they were playing old school hip hop. My daughter ended up dancing and bopping her head. Some of the songs brought me back to the past. 

The restrooms were separated by side. It's only a one stall bathroom and it was clean. 

Parking is too the side of the actual restaurant. I would come back to try other items.",AN9y_ctlxODtNOhwk2mx-Q,30,25,4,gMrOVsDqPpEG6HAe_JNXdw

We walked in as a party of 8 at around 7:30 and we did not realize they were closing at 8pm, (oops) but they welcomed us in with a smile!  They could have easily turned us away or given us the take-out option, but they did not.  Instead they demonstrated service that would only continue to add a quality effect to this great dining experience with friends! 

They started us out with some Arnold Palmers, Sweet Teas and Cool-Aids and then some delicious sweet Corncakes.  Drinks were delicious and refillable throughout the evening.  The Corncakes were simply delicious warm and lightly sweetened. 

Then on to the main dish! Our group ordered Catfish, Oxtail, Smothered Meatloaf, and of course Fried Chicken!  My Fried Chicken was wonderfully seasoned, crispy and juicy.  Best of all you can order half orders for a lot of their menu items.  Full orders will  come with your choice of 3 sides and half orders with 2 sides. 

On this occasion I had their Cornbread Dressing topped with Brown Gravy and their Yams.   Both were delicious and the right portion.  I love that they don't over sweeten or spice up their yams and the dressing is comparable to Thanksgiving stuffing.    Some of the other sides enjoyed tonight were their Macaroni and Cheese, Collard Greens, Green Beans, Mash Potatoes, and Rice and Beans.  All delicious!

This place has been here for a while and they recently renovated their dining area to a pleasant 50's looking diner! Also they have another location across from the Stratosphere with a Grand Opening in 7 days and that location will be open 24 hours which is very much needed and welcomed for our city that never sleeps!

The comfort food served at M & M's satisfies our cravings but their continued great service will make this place our first choice for Soul Food.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,5,4,4,tqgEnuSFYZ7Kuy56bgGdaw

While the outside of the restaurant is not particularly attractive, the inside is neat, clean and has two plasma TV's with Sportcenter.  That's always a good start.  We were allowed to seat ourselves.  From a fabulous southern/soul food selection, I was the most adventurous, ordering the liver and onions for about $6.00.  My meal came with the choice of potatoes, grits, or rice; two eggs made to order, and a biscuit or toast.  I had the grits and the bisquit.  The liver was covered with brown gravy and onions.  The portion was huge, and I did not finish it.  The biscuit was small but tasty.  The grits were good as far as I could tell.  My wife is the grits lover, and she said they were tops.  My wife ordered the cheese omelette.  I also tried a few bites.  This is not the typical omelette that his a majority of fluffy eggs with a little bit of cheddar.  This is more like a flat, triple folded omelette filled with cheese and cheese on top.  Everyone has their priorities with omelettes, ours is more about the cheese than the egg, so we were delighted.  Her omelette with choice of toast came to $6.99.  There was no child's menu, but for $4.00, we purchased the french toast.  We tend to eat ""family style"" and the kid at my eggs, then ate most of the french toast, careful to avoid the dreaded crust.  I tried the french toast and it was six half slices of battered bread with a hint of cinnamon.  It was delicious.  Our coffee was $1.50, and the waitress was attentive, keeping the cup filled.  I would say that we were able to eat 2/3 of the meal, and we arrived pretty hungry.

$40 for overly fatty, cheap quality ox tails, and short ribs that were more fat and bone than meat. Mac & cheese was extremely bland; greens obviously came out of a can; fried okra came out of a bag from the freezer; dressing was extremely dense, but the flavor was okay; black eyed peas had no flavor; cabbage was mushy & flavorless. Everything was cold. Oh..and the cornbread pancakes (???)...uh uh. That is not cornbread.

Let me say... this really is like home. oh wait, but I've never been to the south. THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS PLACE IS. Truly southern soul food. Just absolutely amazing. That's all I can really say about this place. I've had other soul food in Las Vegas but it was just too salty. The cornbread pancake is absolutely delicious and is unlimited! 

All I usually get is the smothered chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cornbread dressing. I got the half-order so I only could get 2 sides. 3 if you get the full order, but honestly the food is pretty heavy and so I barely finished it.

The waitresses are so attentive and so friendly its unbelievable. I'd move to the south right now if I could have this every day. But then I probably wouldn't. Hah. I want to just get up and dance like James Brown because he releases the soul in me. 

They keep true to their southern roots by having other dishes like Cat Fish with sides like Okra. AND CALLING AN ARNOLD PALMER A MUDDY WATER? As dirty as it sounds, I'll drink it everyday. It seriously couldn't get any more southern than this. 

Even the interior reminds me of an old school diner back in the 50's. Everything just black and white. I wouldn't have been surprised if Bill Haley & The Comets just came out and sang Rock Around the Clock.

All of them are filled with homey, down-to-earth personnel that make you feel you're at your grandmother's house.  This is a good thing if the food is worth it.

So I have been wanting to try M&M for a few years now after reading all the good reviews on many LV boards.  Finally tried it yesterday morning and am glad I did.  Being on West Charleston, I know the area leaves much to be desired, but so is every other soul food restaurant I've been to.  The inside is diner-looking with music blaring, several tables and a counter.  The personnel was a surprise with their almost-formal attire.  Interesting.  We walk in and I hear, ""hey, how yall doing?"" LOUDLY.  Yeah, that's a sign this is going to be good.  Following is what we ordered:

Chicken Wings and Waffles, side of two eggs over medium:  The chicken wings - oh, the chicken wings!  Hot, fresh and oh so golden.  I tore the wing apart and smiled with I saw the smoke rising from this wonderful morsel.  The waffles were oval in shape and were soft with a maple flavor even before I put the syrup on.  Delicious.  The eggs were eggs, no complaint.

Turkey Sausage and eggs, grits and toast:  Everything was cooked to perfection.

With coffees all around, we got out of there with a bill of $22.15.

The service was a bit slow, but they were swamped so again, no complaints.

The building is by the road and looks pretty anonymous, but it is rather nice on the inside. Not high end, but a down to earth place where you can enjoy a good meal :) 

We were greeted as we entered and shown to a table. A waiter came to our table instantly, and a nice Muddy Waters tasted lovely along with the cornbread.

I noticed this place has some 1 and 2 stars and after having dined here, I have come to the conclusion that American yelpers simply are too strict in their rating.  Oh, you were not met with a warm hellooo when you arrived (nor a hug?) .. Is that really important? I take such ratings with a huge pinch of salt from now on.. 

BECAUSE, the chicken and waffel were awesome and the waiters nice and attentive. Also, we paid less than $30 for two persons and I was not even able to eat everything. We left being totally full and satisfied. 

I did not quite get the menu as there were little info on each dish, but I could have just asked. Next time I will. That being said, I am Norwegian and not updated on Southern food really.

I ordered the fried chicken with greens and yams. The waitress told me the chicken would take 20 mins too cook due to the chicken being fresh I agreed to wait. After what seemed like 5 mins out came my fried chicken dinner. I started to ask questions but the chicken looked good and was hot so I gave it a try. Well the chicken was tuff ,stringy and dripping very hot oil. The bottom line was that the Chicken wasn't freshly cooked, it had been precooked and put back into the hot oil and reheated(NASTY!) The greens had a slightly sweet taste and the yams were way too sweet for my taste.
   Overall I have to say this place should be great but the kitchen staff was more interested in the 2 young women that they were entertaining during my visit. I really hope this was not the norm for this place, everything is in place for this to be a great restaurant. It seems like this place is in need of leadership, before leaving I asked to speak with the Manager and was told the manager was gone and would be back in a few hours.

How auntie so-and-so made her greens often becomes the benchmark for good greens. Same for fried chicken and BBQ. That being said I think the food was just mediocre. We opted for the original location and not the one on the strip based in fellow yelpers who exposed their growing pains of being the new location. That being said the ambiance is that if an around the way soul food joint. Expect little by way of decor, photos of celebs and blaring wall mounted TVs bare tables is the basic aesthetic. The service was fine but my expectations were low and not because of M&M but because I'm used to around the way soul food spots. Low on customer service high on great tasting food. This time the servers were on it and acknowledged us quickly, let us seat ourselves and then quickly took drink and food orders. We ordered the full orders of the fried chicken wings and BBQ chicken with candied yams, collard greens, black eyed peas and potato salad. The short of it.... The food was just meh. The BBQ chicken was simply baked chicken with BBQ sauce. Lazy. The fried chicken appeared crunchy and was seasoned well from what my dinner guest said. The sides were just ok...not particularly well seasoned and not outright bland. I would probably go back just to try other things in the menu as I think I may have ordered the wrong thing. I encourage you to try them out and support this business that is off of the strip.

My date had to go find menus and let the waitress know that once again we're here. The food awful. The greens were salty and tasted like they're straight from a can, and if they're not, I have to say that someone has a special skill if they can make a collard green taste that bad. The cornbread dressing was a stiff blob of something with once again gravy that appeared to be from a jar or a can. The cabbage was the saving grace but for the fact that it had very little seasoning. The fried chicken was inconsistent, the wings were a tad greasy but weren't dried out like the chicken breast. The mac n cheese tastes like it looks, like dried paste. Look at the pictures that are posted they will tell you everything you need to know.

Let's start off with the fact that we came through the door, the three of us and weren't greeted more the less  even acknowledged. Then once we do get seated were we asked about a drink or something to start us off? NO not all. Okay I big deal maybe she'll come back in a minute or two. Lol no we weren't asked about drink for at least 15-20 minutes, in fact she didn't even ask about a damn drink she went straight to asking what we wanted to order (with no type of emotion, smile, or anything, like she was a damn zombie with an attitude). The sad thing is that they weren't that busy at all yet other people that were coming in were getting asked what they wanted to order and drink. And let's not forget also receiving their cornbread pancakes as a little appetizer while they wait for their food. We couldn't even get that much. So drink and no appetizer that you're supposed to give every table plus you have a fat attitude when you come to take my order? Um no. Definitely will not be back. And it's sad to say that because as a black female you don't expect to be treated like that at a soul food restaurant nor by other black females but sadly that's exactly what this was.
 And don't get me wrong I work in the food industry and I completely understand how a shift can be crappy as hell!As a young woman in the food industry I know that those girls could've just had the worst shift of their life but that doesn't mean you treat customers like trash. Do your job and make your money and get your tips or go home. It's that simple! Don't get in the customer service industry if you can't handle the heat! It's literally just disgusting to see plus your food isn't that good at all! Then the fact that a full meal is only 2 measly pieces of fish and some gross sides. Macaroni is barely warm and tasteless. The red beans and rice tastes worst than the box stuff. And the green beans were trash too! At least get one of these things customer service or the food but having both that are shitty is just plain horrible. Sorry I'm not a typical ratchet that comes in there everyday.

The sides, especially the yams were good. 

I wish I could remember the waitress name...she was so friendly and attentive. She was a lighter toned young girl with a colorful tattoo on her arm...She, solely on her customer service had us sold. Cannot forget the security guard. Great team and great food equals happy customers!!!

The chicken was perfectly seasoned and delicious and I'm not a huge fan of waffles/pancakes, but the waffles were THE BEST I have ever had!

The place is nice very clean very casual diner type environment. 
The food is a bit pricey but that's because portions are HUGE and the fact they offer half orders is awesome.
This isnt fast food so dont expect to be in and out in a heart beat they actually take time to COOK your food not just heat it up.

Ox Tail - Very nicely cooked lots of tendon and VERY tender WIN
Fried Chicken - Came out hot fresh, tastes great WIN
Wings n Waffles - This is my new breakfast, something about the home made waffles makes it lighter and crispier EPIC WIN
Short Ribs - Had them with the BBQ sauce gotta try gravy next time VERY tender WIN
Fried Okra - Something about it is just pure WIN
Mac and Cheese - Again something about it makes it WIN

The only Fail is we asked for water a few times and it never came, so if you're gonna want something later on in the meal order it as your ordering your food

The grits were super bland which my blood pressure probably went up a few points due to all the salt I had to put in them just to give it a tad bit of flavor.  The shrimp had a boiled taste to them with very little flavor besides the bell pepper taste. The gravy on top tasted like oil or oily taste. Overall, it was a bad choice.
Now on to the chicken n waffles. The chicken was hot and fresh with a decent flavor. The waffles were delicious with a taste of cinnamon goodness 

Initially ordered catfish and quickly changed my mind after being told of portion size of fish. For $17, it wasn't worth it, downright robbery IMO. I would expect a large fillet for that price, not 3 skimpy pieces not larger than 3 of my fingers.

The overall environment was clean and dimly lit. The tables were too close together as by back was nearly touching the person behind us.

Waitress: Greeted us as soon as we walked in and seated us asking for our drink orders before we even sat down. Chose water which was brought out in mini mason jars. Not sure if they had free refils for other beverages, but for the size I sure hope so.

The restaurant is owned and staffed mostly by black people. As much as I enjoy the food, I cannot go back there due to the hostile anti-white prejudice that we have consistently experienced over the years.

We went there last night about 7 PM. We sat down and were promptly greeted and our orders taken. They serve two small corn cakes as a free appetizer, but, it seem, only if you are black. After waiting 45 minutes without receiving our food, and seeing other customers who arrived well after we did served their food, my wife got up and asked the manager if we could have our food. After she did that, the food was brought to the table promptly. It was delicious, we paid our ticket and left. This has been a very consistent pattern over the years. If you are black, you will be served promptly. If you are white, you can plan on sitting for a long time and being ignored.

Tables from our group that included at least one African American had their drinks/orders taken, but even after my wife went to the ladies room, we had not even been spoken to (most likely had not been looked at...) 

There was no shortage of staff, since I saw several employees standing around near the cashier area.

Once we realized that we were being blatantly ignored, we left. I thought we (as a society) were above this type of behavior. I feel like I should look into taking action to bring the media into the situation (much like Denny's in the 1990's, no restaurant should act this way.) Last time I checked, my blood was just as red as the next guys, and my money every bit as green. 

This whole in the wall will never get anything but extremely negative press from me.  If you have any desire for real equality in this day and age, you won't go there either.",tZ4z3R0peQfZjenpbaDRYA,3,0,1,ciPVDtHW1GoT6akr2VX9uA

I got baked chicken (dark meat) with mashed potatoes & collard greens.
The chicken wouldn't have had flavor if it wasn't COVERED in gravy.

Usually Mississippi folks cook stuff to death, but they forgot to finish these. Super firm and big chucks...and they put SUGAR in them!

Only redeeming thing is the cornbread pancakes....good & just a little sweet.

The cornbread pancakes are so good and complimentary. The staff is friendly and attentive. (Even on mother's day when the place was PACKED with a line out the door. We still got drinks refilled and timely/friendly service.) I haven't ventured beyond the fried chicken but my husband has had the short ribs and said they were delicious.

Of course I wanted to get my black-eyed peas and collard greens, but I had a craving for home cooking so to google I went. I had heard about this place and after finding out that no one in town has Chicken and Dressing, I figured I'd get some Meatloaf plus they had okra and mashed potatoes. I was ready

It's New Years Day so needless to say that I wasn't the only one who wanted to get some good luck for the new year. It wasn't even noon and the place was PACKED. I thought it was a great sign that I was one of only two white people in the place. It's kind of a family diner kind of place but that's fine by me. Everyone was super friendly when I walked in and I only had to wait maybe 5 minutes before I was sat. They also had the football game on so I was set. 

I quickly ordered sweet tea while I looked over the menu. I decided to go all out and got a Half Order of Meatloaf, black-eyed peas, collard greens, mashed potatoes and gravy, and friend okra. The food came out very quickly and I was pleasantly surprised with everything. 

I'm definitely glad I went and left feeling full. It's good to know that there are some good places like this in Las Vegas when I need to get my Southern food fix. As someone from Mississippi, I can tell you that this place is legit.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,1,1,4,d5vrSsZ1j3U_tFlLBbbHEA

The macaroni was bland and didn't taste much like cheese at all. Even the table behind me made a complaint to the waitress about the macaroni. The greens were cut into strips, which was a little weird, and they weren't soft or flavorful like how good greens usually are. The mashed potatoes and gravy was very bland also, with no real flavor. I think the sides are just important as the main dish, so the poor quality of the sides really hurt this restaurant from shining as a good soul food spot in Las Vegas.

And I'm sure everyone else agrees too because this place is always packed full whether it's lunch or dinner time. Upon seating you'll get some fresh, warm cornbread pancakes that are mmmm so delicious and much better than actual cornbread or dinner rolls. They only bring you 1 or 2 per person but sometimes I wish I could have more!

I always get the smothered fried chicken, but the regular fried chicken is always good too if you're not a big gravy fan. The chicken is always fresh and crispy and the full dinner order comes with your choice of 3 sides for around $13.99. They also have a ""half"" order for slightly less but you just get 1 less piece of chicken and 1 less side. The sides here are ok and it really depends on what you get. The mac and cheese is probably the best side here. The cabbage is sometimes a little bland and I'm not a big collard greens or okra kind of guy so that's really my only green option. 

I just wish they opened later than 8 pm! Also be patient because when it gets packed in here, the speed of service goes down a little bit because they only have 2-3 servers at all times.

Little did I know they ONLY served breakfast until 11a. I was hoping to get the oxtail thing, but after a long debate, I settled with wings and waffles. My coworkers had gotten there before me and had already ordered. 10 minutes later, I put my order in. Got the muddy water. Mmmm, sweet and tangy goodness.

The food ended up taking about 30-40 minutes. How horrible. There seemed to be 1 server for the whole place and 1 busser, and 1 cook. The server was impressive though, carrying 5 plates of food all on one hand. Other than that, I guess you can't expect great service.

But the important thing was the food! I actually got a side of pancakes also. And they came out first, before anyone's food. And they were yummy. There was a vanilla cinnamon flavor to them. And the waffles were probably the same batter which were delicious as well. When the wings and waffles finally did arrive, nice and hot, I was famished. The waffles were great, very soft and moist with a great flavor and the wings were cooked well and seasoned well. The hot sauce was great.

So overall, 4 stars for their food, 2 stars for service and atmosphere. Comes out to 3 stars. (Yay I can do math!)

Oh BTW, their music/speakers... funky stuff. As we were waiting for the food, we noticed that the music kept stopping. Like in a dance where they pause so you can change partners.

I was very excited to find M & Ms where i could get chicken and waffles. I have to admit it was delicious! I just remember when i was eating, when i would eat the waffles i would say yummm the waffles taste the best, then i would take a bite of the chicken and say oh nooo the chicken is the best. and this just kept going back and forth the whole entire meal. I was soo stuffed by the end but i wanted to keep eating more.

It's a bit of a drive from our house, but we were over on this side of town and decided to stop here for lunch. As always, we were glad that we did. Our water was never dry, and the food was delivered promptly and right on point.

My friends and I were on vacation and decided to stop into the local soul food restaurant with high hopes. The initial wait time was 1 hour for five people which we decided to accept and stay but ended up not being seated for an entire hour. That was the first sign of mismanagement. We then sat down and waited for our server for an additional 15 minutes before she even greeted us. We all immediately knew what we wanted and ordered straight away. It took 25 minutes for our drinks to come. Another 40 minutes passed with no food or update from our server so we requested to speak to a manager, he told us that he was too busy to speak to us but eventually came over. We voiced our concerns and he proceeded to yell at the kitchen staff. Another 20 minutes passed and the chef came out to speak with us and even voiced his disappointment with our service. After all of this time passed they began to then tell me that they were out of the item I ordered. And for our 2 hours wasted and terrible service they were only willing to pay for 2 out of the 5 meals. We immediately left. To say I left disappointed and outraged is an understatement.

Although the outside wasn't very appealing as we pulled up, we decided to try it out anyway.  Once inside, we noticed that things weren't much different in regards to the decor.   It reminds me of a country style cafe with modest décor.  There were a few pictures of celebrities that had visited on the wall.  Despite the minimal décor the environment it was clean, friendly and welcoming.  The waitress, Stephanie, seated us right away.  She was pleasant, warm and engaging.  Her service and knowledge of the menu exceeded our expectations.  I thought that was great compared to some high-restaurants that I have visited where they seat you and 20 minutes later you still haven't been approached by the waiter.  The restaurant was full of people and although she was busy with other customers, she frequently checked on us.  Upon receiving our menus, I immediately noticed that the pricing was very fair. There were a lot of options and all of the soul food favorites were included.  At this point, my M&M Soul Food Café dining service had been great and I hadn't even ordered yet.  The food was even better than I anticipated!  The portions were impressive and the presentation was on point.  One of my friends ordered the shrimp and grits.  Another friend had the chicken and waffles.  My third friend tried the oxtails, greens and yams.  I ordered the smothered chicken and gravy.  Everything arrived quickly and was steaming hot. The food was very delicious!!  It made my heart feel glad and my tummy was very satisfied.  It reminded me of my good home cooking.  We all shared each other's food and laughed and talked throughout the meal.  We had a delightful experience at M&M Soul Food Café.  I'm very glad that we didn't let our first impression stop us from trying a new place.  M&M Soul Food Café has gained a new fan.

Red beans and rice-was okay 
Shrimp and grits-bland, I had to add a ton of salt, pepper, and hot sauce just to eat it

I was with a group of 3, all first timers, and we agreed that we would  be coming back soon. I ordered the fried chicken wings and waffles, of course, as I am a huge fan of this dish and order it whenever it's on the menu. The ONLY time I eat fried chicken is when It's accompanied with a buttered waffle and smothered in maple syrup. If I'm gonna go, I wanna go all the way. Wings are not my preferred piece of  the chicken but that is a small thing and I'm willing to overlook it because the waffles were awesome. Perfectly soft, chewy texture and I'm pretty sure I detected a hint of cinnamon. They were a perfect compliment to the fried chicken. I might be spoiled for this dish at any other restaurant. 

The catfish plate with two eggs, grits and toast was really tasty too. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the grits didn't require any doctoring up. They were good without any added butter or sugar. The third breakfast entree was corn beef hash. I didn't try it, not really my thing.  I'm guessing it was good though because there wasn't one bite left on the plate. 

This building is in a state of slight disrepair. It looks a little rundown but don't let that keep you away. It's just part of the charm. The two waitresses that served my table were great. Fast and efficient service with a friendly smile. Everyone was busy and doing their part to make this place run smoothly.

I would say definitely do not order this dish. Not much flavor and some kind of grease all over the top of it. Which I did not appreciate. I love shrimp and grits but I would never order it here again. Other person in my party had smothered fried chicken. They let me taste some of it it was just OK, nothing fantastic. DM's that came with it were overly sugared. With plain white sugar and out with brown sugar. This is a matter of taste however I prefer my yams with just butter and no sugar at all. The green beans were also rather on the tasteless side. Again, I love green beans, but these were just not very good. 
Third person in our party got the barbecue short ribs. He tore them up I didn't even get to taste them he really enjoyed them so I guess they were really good!
Oh, I almost forgot the most important thing to me. I ordered red beans and rice to take home with a hotlink sausage. The next day when I ate it, the hotlink sausage was really good but the red beans and rice were not. Sadly, you can get much better red beans and rice at Popeyes.

First and foremost... hands down the best customer service ever! All of the servers were phenomenal, kept coming back to give us water, asking if we were okay, and the owner (or who I believe was the owner) came to our table to greet us and asked if everything was fine. 

As I was looking through the menu, I was overwhelmed with excitement and full of joy! I ordered the full fried chicken (white meat) and it came with three sides. I chose macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and collared greens. I personally loved the collared greens, but the sides were okay. The chicken, on the other hand was cripy, well-seasoned, and delicious!!

Low and behold M&M soul food, another joint many of you probably passed numerous times in your travels. It's in the plaza on the southwest corner of Charleston & Valley View. 

You walk in and it's a diner like atmosphere with the counter and all. There's seats straight back if you don't want to hear the blaring music with the TV in front. We opted to sit by the speaker to get the full experience as it is soul food and a lil Earth Wind & Fire never hurt anyone. I ordered the smothered chicken with 3 sides (Mac and cheese, rice & beans, collard greens). The badass thing about this place is they let you order half orders of stuff if your not feeling like stuffing yourself, half orders come with two sides. 

While you wait for you food they bring this corn bread in the shape of a small pancake, at first I put it aside but after staring at it for a few minutes I tried it. The corn bread was very good and when you finish the waitress is nice enough to bring you more (at no charge). My chicken was very good although a lil on the dry side but the gravy helped with that, the Mac and cheese tastes home made. I really liked the rice and beans as they are kidney beans which I am a big fan of. Collard greens were just ok, lil strong for my pallet on the green side, had a lil bite. 

I felt completely safe and comfortable as the 6'5"" security guard (probably not that tall, i'm short) with a gat strapped at his side paced up and down the place several times. Waitress was very friendly and service was prompt. Four of us ate for under $65 and was stuffed when I left. Music was old school 80's pop and when there's a game on they tune in.

I had truly high hopes for this so-called 'classic' Vegas restaurant, but I was just disappointed. 

We were quickly assisted in finding seats as soon as we walked in. We had to move to another table because the table we were given was very wobbly. It was weird that they kind of expected us to deal with that, instead of finding a solution and just leaving the table that way. I told them I was clumsy and that I needed a different table.

Our bus boy was great and refilled our drinks several times. It was kind of cute that they were in mason jars. Our waitress, however, was unacceptable. While she was taking our order, she left in the middle of my man talking to speak to another customer just walking in. She came back 30 seconds later and didn't even apologize for interrupting him. The worst part was that she got our order wrong. We were going to get it corrected, but ended up deciding not to. They would probably going to mess that up too and we didn't want to deal with her any longer.

I did, however, ask for the smothered gravy sauce that she failed to bring us for our smothered gravy chicken. She came to our table irritated and said ""sorry"", in a very unapologetic matter, as if it was our fault she forgot to bring it. She didn't check on us the entire meal, unlike the other waiting staff there. The only time she was polite, was when she brought us our check, which we had to have another employee get for us since she was not around.

As far as the food, the fried chicken was better than okay (not better than Roscoe's in Cali), but the sides were absolutely horrid. The mac & cheese had no flavor and the collard greens tasted as if they had no spices added to them. I think I could make better at home and I'm not even a Southern cook.

2682697,2017-05-26,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Came here on a visit from Cali for a graduation. I am a huge foodie and I have been all over for GREAT food. My brother once lived in Vegas and ranted about this place. I ordered the following:

1) Gumbo - very watery and the only flavor I tasted was similar to white pepper. There was no gumbo file flavor and the gumbo was red in color. There were lots of pieces of crab, however, the crab did not taste fresh and it had a garlic flavor. I've had gumbo from white owned eateries that tasted far better. The gumbo is a no go for me.

2) Oxtails (ala carte) - The oxtails were very fatty and came covered in some type of thick orange-reddish gravy that was over seasoned. I just was not feeling the gravy or the flavor.

3) Short ribs - same as the oxtails.

4) Cornbread patties - the first bunch came out to our table cold and thick. When I informed the waitress, she brought a fresh set of patties and they were pretty good.

5) Our server was very nice but totally ghost. She rarely came back to our table and was actually sweeping the floors in the front of the place and waiting on every other table but mine.

6) Lemonade - I asked if the lemonade was fresh and home made. The server informed me that it was freshly made but failed to inform me that it was freshly made Kool-Aid Lemonade. Not ""KooL"" at all.....  

The place is very clean (the waitress made certain of this by choosing a broom over service) and it is located in a desolate tiny plaza in a somewhat industrial area with heavy traffic. There is a lack of ambiance.

To be fair, there is a lack of great food, and other than the strip, a lack of ambiance in Vegas. Therefore, the food here is in alignment with other eateries but I think I'm good on my never again visit to Vegas.",SJV7XYKkWHKe7EPr5_QhAg,1,1,2,ArxB7em_OXvJ2let4dLfeg

The place is over-priced for simple food, therefore I'm not sure if I'll be back. The portions don't match up with it. In addition, it's just not the cleanest place.

Mac&Cheese Side- beyond cold and seemed to be day old Extremely Disappointed

Red Beans and Rice- lacked seasoning (Picked At)
Potato Salad - had that pickle taste to it (not-eaten)

Koo-Aid- kool-aid was Great 
CornBread Cakes -  CBC Greasy but great as well 
Sweet Potato Pie - Burnt  but the areas that wasn't burnt was good 
The Best Part About this Place that day was the Staff by far 
and i was offered new Mac & Cheese yet  we just didnt want  it 
i would say 50% of the food wasn't eaten but still not the worst experience in the  world i just think they need some better cooks more then anything

Location: Nice ducked off location on the corner. Our Lyft driver told us it was a very popular place, as he picks up a great deal of customer's from here. The restaurant isn't a fancy joint, but it's clean and cozy. *BEWARE... I've seen better public restrooms though.. IJS.
Customer Service: We followed previous Yelper's advice by going when we thought they wouldn't be busy. IT WORKED;-) We were seated immediately by the hostess. Then our waitress Lasanna(AMAZING) made us aware that she lost her voice. Which is why she'd be talking strangely, we completely understood. She answered all our questions about the menu truthfully which we appreciated. 
Food: We ordered to much .. lol But here's the  breakdown.
3pc chicken wing and waffles w/fried okra, cornbread dressing, and black eyed peas.
2 orders of the Smothered pork chops(full) w/mashed potatoes, collard greens, yams and red beans and rice.
1 Smothered fried chicken (full) w/fried okra, black eyed peas, and greens. 
1 order of banana pudding (100% YUM)
3 cups of Kool-Aid and 1 muddy water. 
EVERYTHING WAS MOUTH WATERING especially the red beans and rice, black eyed peas and waffles. Which contained cinnamon something I've never had, but I can now say I like it. Our bill came to $79.86 which I thought was amazing for all we ate. 
Lasanna ended up receiving a $20-25 tip from us as we were VERY FULL and pleased with our experience dining there. M&M's will be on my list of places to return to in future visits.",n5ddOjLzVuzi6GZJYzVxXg,2,0,5,jAB840N4GX2XTE6MaG8yvw

2795852,2015-05-17,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"I'm not too much into how a place looks.  I'm a foodie, I just want that stuff to taste good.

The corncakes that they feed you when your waiting for your food is far better than most bread baskets served at restaurants.  The only thing missing was a LITTLE honey, but the edges had a nice crisp to them.  Delicious.  

I got the BBQ hot link as an appetizer.  My wife thinks all hot links just taste like hot dogs.  I agree to some degree, but I know that's what I'm getting when I order it so it doesn't bother me.  The BBQ sauce on that puppy was a celebration in my mouth, and I love how they cut it up for me to slice my pieces off.

We both got the fried chicken and two sides.  I got the mac n cheese and the corn bread stuffing.  My wife got the red beans and rice and the yams.  She wolfed down the red beans and rice and said the yams were sweet enough for her dessert.  I hate to say it but I've had mac n cheese that was so good I'd bathe in it so I don't think I can ever have mac n cheese again since this one (though good) couldn't compete.  I was glad they put gravy on the stuffing not only for flavor, but I think it helped the texture too.  The only problem with the gravy is that is does cool down.  

The fried chicken is the best I've ever had.  Throw some of the hot sauce on it and I was in heaven.  Eat it slow so you can take in the sweet grease in all it's glory dancing with the spices and sweet steamed meat of this perfection of poultry.  I normally hate the skin, but this was just too good.  I'd have that again and again.  

I finished off my meal with the sweet potato pie.  I've never had it, but the meal was going fine to this point so I took a chance.  I enjoyed the flavor, not as strong as pumpkin but some part of the pie were luke warm and other parts were cold.  That's my only complaint on the food.  

Will I go back? Probably.  Soon? Probably not.  It's pretty out of the way for us, but I wanted an experience that was different that what we normally have and I got it.  Just when you walk in I felt transported out of Las Vegas and into the deep south.  Nice hospitality, everyone working there had a smile and were as courteous as could be.  This is a must place visit for those looking for something different with just plain good comfort food.",38oqUN0J2QgTBaFO6kTmEw,1,1,4,dR3zfReJbcS12eS1donI-w

As far as soul food spots goes, this one is among the best in Las Vegas.

I have to be honest, the strip mall that it is located in is not the most visually appealing but don't let that fool you, the food is top notch.

There was a tiny bit of a wait but we were seated rather quickly and greeted by a very friendly staff.

The menu is a basic homestyle soul food with traditional favorites. I started off with the sweet tea which is a personal favorite.

I had catfish dinner with the macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes and yams. Catfish was seasoned perfectly and the breading was nice and flaky. The mac & cheese was slightly dry but still very good. I have to say I love their gravy.

My kid had the Fried chicken. I'll swing, leg and a thigh to be exact. The seasoning they use the fried chicken is out of this world. Skin was nice and crispy and the meet was nice and juicy. The collar greens were amazing! 

It is all served with peas corn bread pancake looking things. Pretty tasty but I am a more conditional fan of the regular cornbread

The staff was very attentive and very friendly and were quite eager to make sure we had everything we needed.

I'm originally from Los Angeles and have frequent did a lot of the soul food spots. This one by far ranks up there with the top of them. 

I highly recommend trying them for lunch, because they do offer a lunch size portion of it in case you wanted to try a variety of different things.",zIj-0Aa0bLomrCIsveQ8PA,4,0,4,SxPmfLrzZ17Z0og1A0Iy4g

Also had a half order of the short ribs in BBQ - tender and well prepared, very good.

All in all a great southern style soul food meal - high quality and definitely had that homemade quality to it - recipes tasted like family home cooking.

Breakfast menu looked very interesting as well - may go back and give it a shot.

Service was excellent!

My bends were full of flavor and seasoned well. The greens looked good but had a sweet element to them that I did not care for.  I returned my entire plate because my chicken was well below the desired serving temperature, and tasted as if it has been sitting for quite some time. I could tell this by the tough cardboard texture. My waitress took the plate back like she knew the chicken was not right. On the menu it even states ""Be aware there is a 20 minute wait on all fried foods."" Mine came out in about 8 minutes. I am writing this in real time and still within my 20 minute window for my fresh chicken. The waitress staff is full of beautiful neatly groomed black women in black pants white shirts and bow ties. They greet everyone who comes though the door, and are very professional. My food has arrived and it is hot. Hot foils is always good but my chicken is just average tasting.

This is not the best ""soul food"" that I've ever eaten in my life but in Vegas - it's pretty damn good.  

II always order the same thing - fried chicken with 3 sides.  It's $13.99 and definitely will send you home with a doggy bad.  This time with my chicken I got mac n cheese, string beans and rice and gravy.  I usually get yams but figured I could use some green veggies on my carb ridden plate.

The mac n cheese is always on point.  The string beans were great.  I was worried they might be too salty but they definitely were not. and the rice and gravy - well, I'm a sucker for rice with brown gravy and this gravy is damn good.  My other half also got the same as me but instead had cornbread stuffing and collard greens which he raved about.  

One of the greatest things about this place is the corn pancakes they give you.  They are like CRACK.

If you are looking for stellar service, a trendy atmosphere, etc - this isn't the place for you.  But if you're looking for real ""soul food"" you won't be disappointed.

Side Note:  I had a coupon BOGO from the Entertainment Book stating that you could not use if on holidays.  Apparently - they don't accept them on the weekend.  It wasn't a big deal for me as I would have come here without the coupon but just an FYI for the future.",Zemr8otoe_xhutAI62rWqQ,6,5,4,NLIUkYV-SI2xnqhX49RG-A

Atmosphere: Atrocious!
Upon entering the restaurant, it was the usual dining experience I would have when I usually came to M&M. However, upon being seathed, I noticed a slight scent in the air that wasn't food. It was more like musk, dust, and humidity. I knew this visit wasn't going to be my best. 

Service: Slow, but got the job done.
There were definitely waitresses on board, but it didn't look like there were many cooks working this day. Upon ordering my food, I was informed by the waitress that the wait would be significantly longer than usual (20+ minutes). I acknowledged this fact since I really wanted soul food this afternoon. The wait didn't feel too long, and I was served my food within the given time period. For my wait, the waitress gave me a free chocolate cake for free upon leaving. Not too bad for service!

Food: Still fantastic!
The hotcakes were awesome, as usual. Hotcakes are always good to start off with, especially with a dab of butter on top! I ordered Fried Chicken with Fried Okra, Collarded Greens, and Rice. I felt the food was too acidic at one point, but that was my fault for what I had ordered.

Overall:
My last visit here left me a bad impression. I will never look at this restaurant the same again. This was my only ""bad"" visit. I will definitely visit this place again, and for anyone who wants to try soul food, this place is great!

I had the smothered fried chicken and it was fantastic. The chicken stays crispy, even with the amazing gravy that it has been dipped in. The gravy is practically it's own food group. The chicken is moist and tender and easily the best fried chicken I have had in Vegas. The sides were awesome too, especially the collard greens and the yams. Got a piece of sweet potato pie to go and it was awesome. 

The service is excellent, the servers are all friendly and fast and you can tell there's a real camaraderie among them.

We had just had a really long day in San Francisco and were starving. I saw on here that this place was pretty good and it was relatively close to our hotel, so we decided to stop by. I will admit it was about 15-20 mins to closing when we pulled up but we figured if we're just getting it to go it would be okay, right? Wrong. We saw them bringing in the patio chairs and I asked them were they closed they said no, but that they didn't have any food. Like what? Lol . How do you not have anymore food. I felt as though they simply said that so that they wouldn't have to cook us anything right before closing.

I would be the Queen of Thanksgiving! Banana pudding would put a smile back on Paula Deen's face. My only quarrels: I wish they were open a little later - 8 pm comes awfully quick, especially in summer, and I know it's soul food, but I wish they at least offered a couple of lighter options like fresh fruit or green salad.

3410440,2014-11-11,6,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"M&M is my first brush with Las Vegas Valley soul food. And I just gotta say, WOW. I was blown away at first bite.

The very first time I came here, it was because of my boyfriend. Even though he is Chinese, he was raised on an island, so he periodically gets cravings for island food classics, like oxtail soup. One of his friends had told him to head over to the California Hotel and Casino to this random diner for the best oxtail soup in town.

We get there and find out, they only serve the soup on Sundays. It's all in the details, right? Anyway, long story short... His craving for oxtail soup had not been satiated. Another friend told him to check out M&M, if he likes oxtails so much.

When we arrived, the first thing you notice about this restaurant is the energy. The place is just buzzing with people and the vibe is an energetic one. The servers are very upbeat and talkative.

I decided to get a classic, Smothered Chicken. It is the fried chicken dish, but coated in this delicious brown gravy-esqe sauce. I believed at the time that I had made the best decision, hands down. The bf ordered.... Wait for it.... OXTAIL. I was more about that chicken at the time, honestly.

But when the food came out- wooooooo! Those oxtails were looking really, really good. The chicken was yummy, of course. But as I was munching, he decided to hand me his fork with a bit of the oxtail on it.

Oh. Lawd. Yes.

Now, we both always order the oxtail whenever we go. It's fabulous. It's a bit on the pricy side (the large order comes with three oxtail and three sides for $17.99 or so), but every bit worth it. I think there must be crack in this dish, cuz it's that good.

Another tradition of ours to to get the kool-aid to drink, which is super sweet and comes in a mason jar, but it's just the way I like it. When I was little, I used to hate going over to other people's houses that didn't know how to make kool-aid. It would be all watered down... Not M&M! They keep the ""half a bag of sugar"" custom alive and well here.

The cornbread is not made in bricks, but instead formed into these thin, light mini pancake sort of things. So tasty.

The side dishes are all delightful as well, but some are better than others. A few of my faves are the mac and cheese, the yams (they are candied), and the mashed potatos with gravy.

I still need to try the other Soul Food places in town to really get the picture, but aside from my auntie Carla's cooking, this is gonna be a tough act to beat.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,6,7,4,8BUWkcuPXtt-hHX2qol_LQ

3492233,2016-12-21,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"My review in one word-wow! This place is the spot for authentic southern food. This is not a hipster version, inspired, or fusion southern food. Comparing it to that is ridiculous. This is what your southern grandmother would take pride spending all day making from scratch with love. The ultimate comfort food. 

Upon entering I was promptly greeted by several smiling and welcoming waitresses. I decided to dine in and they asked me to sit wherever I wanted. I did and was greeted again at my table and given a menu. I was thrilled to find out that they had sweet tea. I looked at the menu and was delighted to see so many choices that reminded me of my childhood. I went with the half order of the fried pork chop with collard greens and macaroni & cheese. 

When they brought my drink I was pleasantly surprised to see that they brought me cornbread as well. The cornbread was in the shape of a pancake. I didn't understand the reasoning until I tasted it.  OH MY GOODNESS! This was so yummy. The cornbread had the right amount of sweetness and the pancake shape meant the delicious crispness of the edge was all over the piece of bread.  I can't believe I haven't had it like this sooner. 

When my food arrived I was pleased with the overall appearance of the food. I am used to seeing the breading darker on the porkchop. Once I tasted it any hesitation that I had immediately disappeared. I was cuting the porkchop at first. By the end of the meal I had picked up the porkchop and was eating it with my hands. It was so tender and juicy. The macaroni and cheese was baked and perfect with cheesy goodness. The greens are cooked to perfection. While I was eating, my drink was promptly refilled and I was offered more cornbread. As yummy as it was I had to turn it down. There was so much food. I am surprised that I didn't roll out the door after my meal. I left stuffed and so satisfied. I will definitely be back and have already recommended this restaurant to several friends. This is great food, large portions, attentive service, excellent prices,  & all the comfort I'd expect in a real southern restaurant. A+",csEL3VrnnX-T2rWX16v3nA,0,0,5,Nrr-wW_NVaa2sATwUXUrzw

Easter Sunday,  1:45 p.m....We came in hungry for some fried chicken... everyone is dressed in their ""Sunday Best"" probably coming from church, and there were a few tables along the wall up front, but we get sat down in the back on a round small lounge table and are the only ones there.

Our waitress, Pearl seemed bothered, no smile, no acknowledgement, kept it short and took our drink orders. Comes back with our sweet teas and takes our order. Fried Chicken, all white meat for wifey,  Fried Chicken, all dark meat for me.

This is not our first visit here...in fact, we recieved awesome service from waitress Shy on our last visit which was during dinner hours and we know that the hot corn cakes come usually after the drinks are dropped off as we wait for our fried chicken which usually takes at least 20 minutes. During our wait, we observe four other tables arrive after us in Pearl's station...
Service with a smile, drinks brought promptly, and corn cakes on every table. We still don't recieve any corn cakes.

""This is not right!?!?"" Wifey says...Trying not to jump to conclusions, we wait and see that if our entrees come out first, then it's a problem.
6-8 minutes later, our entrees arrive, minus one wing from Wifey's order. Pearl says (her face looking at us and her body already walking away)that the chicken is coming but it takes time...last time I checked,  a breast takes longer than a wing to cook!? We had to ask Pearl for our corn cakes, and reminded her TWO other times that we hadn't recieved Wifey's other piece of chicken, which she insists is coming.

Carefully digging into our food so we don't drop any plates off our small round table, all our sides are cool to room temperature, cornbread dressing was dry, as was the corn cakes, my chicken is barely warm and bland inside having to douse it with a lot of hot sauce,
 wifey's chicken breast is dryer than dry, only eating her wing, and STILL not receiving her third piece!?!? ""You know what?, just remove that third piece from our bill"" wifey says having to flag Pearl down. 

Is it because we were the only non-black people in there?

Is it my board shorts and flip flops I was dressed in, and not my ""Sunday Best"" because I helped baptize over 100 people of ALL possible races at our church since 9am that morning?

All Pearl could say was ""Sorry about that"", which was met with dead silence from us...within a 5 minute span, Pearl comes to our table THREE TIMES with ""can I get you anything else?"" (Chicken never came, drinks were never refilled, why would we want to ask you for anything else but our check?) Pearl received no tip for her uncalled for actions.

Denied an apartment because my Persian
roomate and I weren't white,

Put up in very dirty living conditions(didn't even last a day) because I wasn't a certain religion,

All eyes on me because I was the only brown skinned person in an all white restaurant,

3646680,2017-12-29,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"This was an interesting experience, and to be honest I'm still deciding on if I would come back or not. It was a normal Thursday night and my friends family was in town. They wanted to do something a little bit different and go off the strip (they were staying at MGM) and a friend of theirs that visited a while back recommended they go to M&Ms soul food. They up and raved about the koolaid and the food and my friends family was convinced that this was the place to be. Let's be honest now....  I am now partial to LoLos Chicken and Waffles koolaid so I took this opinion seriously and kept my head and stomach open. This location is catty corner across the street from the Stratosphere so its an easy place to spot. We pulled up and walked in and the vibe we got is 70s funky diner. The place wasn't necessarily clean and there was no hostess. Unfortunately I have the habit of going to resturants on the nights they are short staffed.  An overworked yet pleasant waitress advised us to come on in and pick a table. Considering the options weren't plenty (more dirty tables than not) and the other tables were occupied it wasn't hard to choose a spot. Now let's fast forward 15 minutes and no menus, no greeting, no drink offers, no acknowledgement.  Once again I think this poor girl was by herself and the other only person working on the floor with her was working hard in another section of the restaurant.  Now let's get on to the actual service and dinner portion of this night.
 
Once we finally got the waitress at our table we ordered three koolaids and three waters with lemon. 10 minutes later she arrived with 3 overly sugared koolaids and two waters no lemon. She told us she'll be back with the water and the lemons. I can tell you now a day later, still no extra water or lemons. Once we finally got her to come back (she was busy I tell you!) we stopped and ordered because who knew when we were going to get this lady again.  We ordered the half plate of fried chicken with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes, full plate of fried pork chops with cabbage, okra, and mac and cheese, and another half plate of smothered pork chops with mac and cheese and yams.  Now clearly on the menu it states when busy meal may take 25-40 minute wait if you order something fried. DUDE they meant it! We were waiting forever. We actually waited so long we all got tired. Thankfully they brought out their cornbread (which looks like pancakes) but those were pretty dull. The butter is the only thing that saved these flapjacks that they called cornbread.
 
Almost an hour later we received our food fresh hot and piping. Few mistakes here and there mashed potatoes came out wrong, the mac and cheese had no flavor, they didn't put any salt or pepper on the fried okra, still haven't gotten my water with lemon lmao. But the porkchops were nicely flavored, the potatoes were good, and the greens were salted perfectly. It was definitely disappointing only because we waited so long and still didn't have all of order and when we did ask for another mashed potatoes she actually finished her food by the time they brought it to her. 20 minutes later. All in all we spent about 2 and  1/2 hours  here waiting for service, waiting for food, hell just waiting. Would I go back? Idk. It's decent food nothing spectacular, but just thinking about the wait....NAAAAH...",Pjk0cNsCF8i7ssrzuc0G5g,2,1,3,OQn0wyZduSIAHe7UjfFBug

My other half had smothered chicken, black eyed peas and greens. Why we both choose those dreadful greens, I don't know. The chicken was old, the mac was something out of a box and the greens... Well they tasted like someone picked them out of a garden and threw them in salt water. We both had this muddy water drink... watered down country time lemonade and generic iced tea. 
On the bright side, the staff was very friendly and helpful. So if I was looking to make friends, I guess I would revisit but I wouldn't go back if I was hungry.",iiveaPouQiq4kxL_yA6Eaw,0,0,2,FBXe1AV891_oWbVuDEUV7g

Omg DELICIOUS the food is so so so good.

I ordered the BBQ spareribs with yams and cornbread dressing as my sides, the meat was falling off the bone and was so tender and the BBQ sauce was of the chain, the yams were so sweet and delicious and the cornbread dressing well lets just say i could have had seconds and thirds of it. My plate was completely empty by the end of the meal and I still had room for banana pudding which was homemade just like everything else.

We waited about 10 minutes after ordering and the people beside us received their food. No big deal... after waiting another 10 minutes, a hispanic/white looking waitress (didn't get her name) came up to me and said I couldn't use the coupon because I had already used it in a VERY rude and accusatory/condescending tone. She kept saying I used it on the 24th of March and it was barely the 22nd the day we were there. When I brought it to her attention she just said ""well you already used it"" (Which I never did since it was my first time ever going). I asked to speak to a manager and she said ""no we don't have one"". She kept talking to me beyond rude like she owned the place or something. Then she asked if we still wanted to place the order. After waiting around 25-30 minutes she still had not place our order!! Clearly it seemed like she had it out for us or something. I've never been treated so rude in my life. My husband and I decided to just get up and leave. I will not support any business that treats people in such a manner.

Every time we are in the Las Vegas area we try to make it to this restaurant it is an easy place to get to and understandably it is a very good restaurant. The cooks definitely have learned from their parents grandparents and other culinary personnel how to serve a great meal. I may be a little jaded, I have never really been to the southern states and had a traditional home cook southern meal, but I definitely have had good meals throughout my travels and this is definitely one of them.

Their menu is well made, it's not very extensive and you have a lot of options that you can make with the size of the menu, I am more of a chicken and waffles type person with some Collie greens and some sweet potatoes yummy.  When you order your meal you definitely can smell the home cooking promenading throughout the restaurant. The food is hot and fresh the new quality is terrific and the chicken is to die for.

This is certainly not food that should be eaten every day (see health rates for states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana as reference), but it sure is a treat for every now and then. 

Absolutely affordable, definitely delicious, and the wait staff -- at least when we visited (Thursday night; waitress: Toni) was wonderful. I have a feeling that they are usually wonderful.

The cornbread pancakes are incredible. I ordered pork chops, smothered, and sides of rice/ beans, yams, and fried okra. Dessert: sweet potato pie. All delicious, and brought very fast to our table. Normally, I do not consume even a fraction of the daily recommended amount of sodium or fat, so eating this much salt/lipids was not really a concern to me (I gained .2 pounds in morning weigh ins after eating here). 

I definitely need to return for some chicken and waffles and for the banana pudding. Next time I will probably inquire over purchasing some cornbread pancakes to take home. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,2,2,5,JvNlUdmuIava-8uSslGIog

Now for the food, it was absolutely delicious! The oxtail was so tender and it's sauce was so flavorful.  The chicken was mediocre.  It just tasted ordinary.

Upon entering with my sister and one year old niece we sat where ever we pleased.

I've driven by many many many times, but the inside was a lot nicer than I expected. I think the recently renovated. 

I hate eating with my niece because she's a baby and causes a scene. Anyone who loves food knows that eating is an experience and I hate to ruin other people's experience with a toddler causing a raucous.

The staff here won her over and had her smiling, laughing, and behaving. Even the other customers were laughing at her. She doesn't do we'll with strangers so this put me at ease. In return my opinion of the staff is very high. We had help from about five people. She also dropped about three forks that the staff replaced every time with a smile. 

That little part aside..

I CAME FOR THE FRIED CHICKEN! 

I love fried chicken and I had really high hopes after being disappointed by Meat and three just the night before.

You could choose a full or half portion. Full was 3 pieces of chicken with three sides for $15 half was 3 pieces and 2 sides for $9.99

I had Mac and cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes.

Before my fried chicken came out they serve a corn bread pancake with butter. I could eat a million of these. They were yummy.

For a drink I had red kook aid !

The brought all the food at once.

The fried chicken was fresh, cooked perfect, but I hate to say nothing special. It was very good fried chicken, but not what I hoped for southern fried chicken to taste like. I don't knock the chicken. I just had very high expectations.

It was my first time trying collard greens and I wasn't a fan.

Their Mac and cheese was special though. Next time I'd order three portions of it. YUMM. I DROOL. It's that good.

The mashed potatoes were just average. They honestly tasted boxed and the gravy wasn't particularly good either.

The kook aid was very good but maybe a tad too sweet. It was $2.50 and we didn't get a refill.

For dessert I had peach cobbler. It was very good but a bit watery. I wish their was more dough and peach rather than watery sauce.

Overall I really loved this place.

It may not sound like it from the review, but the food, staff, and overall experience was awesome. 

Next time I'm trying different sides and ill be having my fried chicken smothered.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,2,1,5,9NB9EVqu5dyBm0Q91RDETA

We ordered a full fried chicken dinner it came with 3 sides he got mac & cheese, yams, & greens. Add on catfish 2pc. My order was a half smothered pork chop, 1 fried chicken thigh it came w/2 sides. I got greens & yams. We expected a 20 min wait per other reviews due to ordering fried chicken. The food came out quickly in about 10mins. Everything was hot except his sides were wrong & cold. They replaced the wrong side. Far as the taste goes the chicken thigh was flavorless. The wings were good he said. I didn't like the yams. Greens were ok, but not hot. He said mac & cheese was bland. Fish was good, I think it's swai tho. 

Killer of the meal, the waitress called the cook over to tell him our sides were cold, he screamed over the restaurant they couldn't be. He comes over and said ""them hoes leave the food in the window & it gets cold"" REALLY DUDE??? This is totally unacceptable to say to people you don't know and disrespectful with a female being present. He saw that we didn't engage in laughter and tried to laugh it off with excuse my language. I have never in 34yrs experienced a cook, server, waitress, cashier, owner, or manager call their employees ""hoes"". So ummmmmmm yeah I'll never go back.

The service is great and if there's a wait, it usually doesn't take too long for us to be seated.  My favorite dish at M&M is their smothered baked chicken.  This dish is hooked up with big pieces of perfectly baked chicken smothered with gravy.  I'll usually get a full order and it comes with 3 sides.  My sides is pretty much the same every time...cornbread dressing, the yams, and red bean & rice.  My entire meal is big enough to feed two people. But it's so good that I will finish the entire meal on my own.  Most of the Yelpers I know rave about their chicken & waffles.  The chicken is fried to perfection and seasoned just right.  I highly recommend their chicken & waffles if it's your first time.  In my opinion, M&M is the best place for soul food in Las Vegas.

But the last time we went (and this was the first time I took my husband), the chicken wasn't cooked fresh - it had been sandbagged...and it was tough and stringy.  the corncakes were wonderful as always.  but everything else was off...  and this time, for the first time, we ordered dessert, the banana pudding.  it was all cookies and the two banana slices that were in it, were grey.  it was old.  and not good.  

I even asked the owner, whom I adore, if he had a new cook - and he said no - and asked why, and I couldn't bring myself to go into it with him.  But things are amiss... very very amiss... and if they continue in this direction, no amount of southern charm and wonderful service (which has not changed, by the way) will save it.

Relly quickly said ""I can call our other location to see if they have some, its not far away, I can give them your order by phone and it should be ready by the time you get there"" Relly immediately called in the order and informed the sister location of our name and said they had the oxtails available.

The place was packed when I went in with my boyfriend and it took a while for a server to come to our dilapidated booth and take our drink orders. I understand they're busy, and I understand this isn't a fine dining establishment. No problem. After our drink orders are taken, a long while passes before our food orders are taken. I order the fried chicken, white meat, mac n cheese, collards. Boyfriend orders chicken and waffles. 

I get my fried chicken and wait as is polite since his food wasn't there yet.. even though I'm certain waiting to eat hot fried chicken is really one of the hardest things a person can endure. It was definitely a test of love. Five minutes pass by and his food still hasn't gotten there, he insists I start, I do not argue. The chicken was lightly battered and really really dry. I also had the problem of it being very salty as previous viewers have mentioned. Not inedible, just too salty. 

His food finally comes 10 minutes after mine was dropped off. He isn't ecstatic about it, but loves my mac n cheese which I find too mushy and greasy and bland. Collards are pretty standard, cold by the time I dug in.

Overall, poor service, dry chicken, and no refills on our muddy waters. I'd give it another chance if it wasn't out of the way for me.. but it is. And so I won't.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,2,0,3,sNNMT5T_TyE5HpasKPC_mw
4239052,2012-01-29,7,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Hello, soul food. It has been a while.

I've been to M&M a few times before. My most recent visit had to be the most notable of them all. I usually roll with the fried catfish dish (very good), but today, I decided to go for the chicken & waffles (faint-worthy). Here's a rundown of what I have tried:

***Chicken & Waffles - By far, my favorite dish here (and my favorite waffles of all time). The waffles have an airy, incredibly fluffy consistency. It is practically melts in your mouth with each bite. I actually have to admit that these even surpass the famous Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles over in L.A. While the chicken wings themselves, did not wow me as much as the waffles did, they did have a delightful crisp, with a nice touch of seasoning.
***Fried catfish - I am a catfish junkie. Suffice to say, M&M does serve up a great plate of catfish. If you're in the mood for crispy, flaky, and well seasoned pieces of fish, you can't go wrong with this order. Note: Half order includes 1 catfish + 2 sides. You may want to go for a full order if your stomach demands it.  I paired my half-order of catfish with fried okra and black eyed peas. Just like they sound, they did my body good.
***Cornbread pancakes - These come free to your table as something to munch on while waiting for food. They are usually incredibly fluffy and fall apart with a savory crumble with each bite, but my most recent visit came off a little dry.
***Muddy water - Pretty much a drink like an Arnold Palmer. Half iced tea, half lemonade. Their lemonade really does pack a sweet punch, so it does stand out above the usual Arnold Palmer.

The wait for the food was a little on the long side. We must have waited 20-30 minutes for our plates to arrive. The friendly staff made sure my coffee mug was never empty. Plus, the cornbread pancakes continuously came to our table to plump us up during the wait.

As they say, soul food sticks to your ribs. Over here at M&M Soul Food Cafe, not only did the food stick to my ribs, rear-end, and whatever flab that was hanging off of my body, it did also ingrain itself a spot in my brain as my favorite spot for chicken and waffles.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,10,7,4,qVL_UT0kFtuwLU0UF3nfPw

Fried Chicken - really favorful 
Fried Catfish - 1 piece was a little over cooked making it tough but the flavor on the breading was fantastic.  The second piece was perfect
Ox Tail - (what I ordered) Meat falling off the bone goodness.  Plenty of natural grave and juices that the smoothering of the house gravy was almost not neccesary.  It is a bit gristly for those who are squimish on fat but that's what give ox tail such flavor.
Sides - Fried okra was the star though they were all good.  Mac and cheese underwhelmed a bit.

4287323,2011-11-09,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"So I finally ventured out to see what the hype is about. I was pretty disappointed : (

There was construction on Charleston so I had to make sure I turned in the right hole to get here. I was confused bc the doors arent really visible. I thought one was closed bc it has that reflective tape on it so we parked in the back. We walk in and the place is dead! Not a good sign!! We sit and a little bit later our waitress greets us. Without looking at the menu I order a kool aid and a muddy water. She went and got our drinks and I checked out the menu, I was kinda in price shock! The drinks were 2.75$ & 2.50$!!! Thats insane! Im paying that much for sugar water??!!! Whats worse is that throughout the time we dined I only got 1 refill and my son got none!! 

I looked at the menu and since I heard good reviews about the chicken so we opted for that. One things that was weird is that they do not have kids meals, lame!! They also dont have childrens prices on drinks. I ordered the 3piece all white with dbl man n cheese and rice w gravy. I noticed there was a 20min wait for fried foods and was fine with that. 

Our waitress brought us the cornbread pancakes and I tried them and they were yummy. Shortly after my chicken arrived, not even a 10 min wait! Idk if thats good or bad... Anyway, the order included 1 breast and 2 wings... Wtf? Im paying 13.99$ for that!? At least give me 2 breasts!

Lets talk about the chicken: I expected something orgasmic, alas the only one I had was later that day when I found out Old Navy had 50% off clearance sale. My son grabbed the wings and I was left with the breast. I took a bite and instantly needed water; it tasted as though their seasoning was only salt! Dont get me wrong, I love salt, but sheesh! Thank goodness I ordered a side of gravy (which she forgot) I sucked down my drink and waited for a refill... Which took almost 20mins and I had to ask for one even though she walked by my empty glass... 2wice!! Once I got my refill I went back to my chicken. I guess it was semi juicy but what seriously turned me off was the breading. I have never ever tasted breading that salty! 

I tried the sides and was soooo let down! The mac n cheese was tasteless and freakin dry!! What a sad thing bc I ordered 2 sides and my son didnt even touch his! The rice and gravy was meh, nothing special. I guess the only good think was the corn bread. Our waitress was ok, only checked on us once which was sucky. The others seemed super nice to other diners in there though : (

This place imo is over-rated and seriously over-priced! The chicken was semi juicy but wayyyy too salty. I couldnt even finish a breast and trust me im a fatty and love me some chicken! I've had soul food before, my bro in law is from Louisiana and has cooked some yummy eats! If this is what Mississippi soul food is then hit dog its hella shitty! I'll stick to cooking my own home-made, not dry, mac n cheese and super yummy fried chicken!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,1,0,3,Eg-f2R1npuS4jHhkBhgmnA

It's located in a strip mall with a lot of parking.  About 15 tables and a small counter fill this interior along with the walls of photos of famous people who know the owners.

I need to put out a disclaimer that I'm writing this review the next day after having a horrible dinner at Del Frisco's Double Eagle, so when I write about Quality:Price ratio, you can see where my bias is coming from.

When we found out there was a M&M in Vegas, we knew we had to try it based on the reputation they built in Los Angeles.  We got there at the perfect time ahead of a party of what looked like 20 people celebrating a 40th birthday.  The staff is really friendly and for a mom n pop operation that thinks Michelin is a tire, we got great service.  The food does take a long time to get to the table, but that's par for the course when they are dropping each order into the deep fry.  Other places will cook in advance and use heat lamps. Not M&M.  You have to wait 20 minutes for chicken to fry.

I got the fried chicken, greens, mac n cheese, and Kool-Aid.  I don't know how they do it, but the skin on the chicken is crispy good, but the batter isn't burned dark.  The batter sticks to the skin and the skin will just peel off the meat leaving you with the most crispy potato chip type delicacy.  I bet you can just sell the deep fried skin. It's that good. 

The others at the table had the gumbo, ox tail and short rib.  All was excellent.  They also serve the table cornbread that looks like corn pancakes. They are buttery, sweet and have a nice crispy edge.  Those little cakes are addicting.  For 4 of us, the bill was $63.

Some might say it's pricey, but for what we got, it was worth the money.  We spent about $320 at Del Friscos later that day.  We spent about 5 times what we spent at M&M and our food at M&M was 5 times better than what we had at Del Friscos.  If I was told I had to spend $320 and $63 on the two meals I had, I would have paid $320 to M&M's.

My food highlights:

1. Corn Pancakes - Order as many as you can.  These suckers are freaking addicting and ohh so orgasmically good.  Slightly crispy exterior, butter soft interior, with amazing flavor.

2. Chicken and Waffles - Man the chicken is moist, crispy and NEVER dry.  The waffles are sweet and fluffy and don't forget the hot sauce and syrup!

4448130,2016-04-04,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Mmmm... this soul food cafe is so worth the extra bit of time to get here from the Strip (assuming you are a tourist that rolled poorly and need to eat your sorrows away with good ol' Southern hospitality). After a good weekend out, before heading home to California ,we wanted to try a unique restaurant to Vegas. Low and behold, it took us here!

The restaurant inside is very narrow, but that doesn't stop the lively atmosphere inside from stopping. We walked into massive numbers of families gathered together over the weekend for a meal. Brunch menu on the weekends gives you a more affordable but limited selection of food. Here's what we ended up getting:

* Chicken & Waffles - Classic, everyday soul food. The chicken was really good, but the waffles themselves were pretty forgettable. This certainly is no Roscoe's, but for the chicken itself, I am a fan.

* Catfish Basket - Fried catfish is always amazing when battered and deep fried well, and the ones here certainly hold on its own. Hushpuppies and fries on the side complimented the meal well. I just wish there was more fish in that basket of ours.

For Soul food in Vegas, M&M definitely holds its own. While service was a bit slow, I can respect that they had a lot of people to cycle through. Be prepared though if you are hungry or needing some grub after a fun night out in Sin City.

Parking is plentiful in a private lout outside the restaurant.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,3,0,4,fwSume2iQ9XT1Z9FXIiN2w

This deceptively simple style of food is actually complex and demands 3 critical elements: high-quality meats/vegetables, skilled preparation techniques and a genuine passion to do it right: M&M consistently delivers this quality to every single plate that comes out of their kitchen. M&M may well be the best kept culinary secret in Las Vegas. I turned my next door neighbor onto M&M and she now orders take-out for her family and serves it up to her kids as if it's her own at least twice a week because they just can't seem to get enough; neither can I!

4529694,2015-03-05,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Experience:  I have been here before and really enjoyed the food, so I decided to come back and bring some friends. There was a total of 6 of us. 

Facility: it's located in the end of an older strip mall right on Charleston. It is kinda a long room with tables down one side and the kitchen on the other. It's not the most up to date, modern place, but it's clean and comfortable. 

Service:  our waitress was Tashara and she was really busy, but the times she was at our table, she was attentive and nice, and she answered all our questions. 
There were a few times we had to ask for refills.  It's nice when a sever does that naturally. Then there was even a pretty long period where we all went without drinks after the food was served, and I had to flag down another waitress, because ours was too busy. 
When we were taking a final picture a playful guy photo-bombed us...turns out he was the owner Tim. He chatted with us for a few minutes, and he was super personable and cool. 

Food:  everyone at the table decided to order something different so we could taste many things. 
BBQ Shortribs: I loved these. They could have used a little more sauce, but these were one of my favs. 
Oxtails: they were tender and delicious and smothered in the house gravy. Definitely my other fav dish!
Smothered chicken: I thought this would be a filet, but it was pieces of their fried chicken with the house gravy. Pretty good. 
Fried chicken: I like the fried chicken, but it's not out if this world. It's just good. 
BBQ chicken: meh. It definitely needed more sauce.  This was my least fav dish. 
Catfish: the catfish was at the top half of the good dishes. It was moist in the middle and crispy on the outside. I was SUPER disappointed they brought me packets of tartar.  I just expected a good southern spot to make their own. 
Sides: we had cabbage, mashed potatoes, green beans, Mac and cheese, fried okra, and greens.  Most of them were just ok, but the fried okra was on point! 

Overall:  I still like this place. It reminds me of just going to a friends house to eat. The food tastes homemade. Some things could use a little improvement, but overall I need my southern fix and this does it.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,3,3,HpfkCE73X_27QipxLMXu4A

Let me start off by saying that my family and I went here on a Sunday night. Probably should have known that the wait was going to be a little longer than usual. 

When we walked in, the place was PACKED. The poor little waitresses were running around trying to serve everyone as best they could, but the amount of people seemed to be overwhelming. I'm pretty forgiving so the wait (which was close to an hour and fifteen minutes WITH a toddler) was ALRIGHT. Good thing I had my phone full of kid-apps to keep my little guy entertained. Our waitress probably popped over like 2 times in that hour and fifteen minutes. I feel like she could have popped over a few MORE times, but she seemed so exhausted and overwhelmed, I really just felt bad for her. 

What really bothered me was our food. First off the served us these little corn cakes, but after waiting forty minutes, I contemplated asking the waitress to give us two more batches because we were famished at that point. 

When the rest of our food came out (fried chicken, greens, beans, mac n cheese for my boyfriend and another order of fried chicken, this time smothered in gravy and the same sides for me and my little guy) My boyfriends food was hot but I found it odd that mine was cold. I feel like they fried the chicken, left it out for an hour to cool, THEN dumped the luke warm gravy on it. The sides were pretty good. The collards were very flavorful and had a little kick, the beans had just the right amount of seasoning and the mac n cheese was creamy but it would have been nice to have a little bit more cheese. 

AGAIN, the place was EXTREMELY busy and I'm pretty forgiving; just maybe keep in mind what day you try to come in. And really, I can wait for a while before I start to get really agitated, but I just ask that my food be HOT when it comes out ESPECIALLY having to wait that long. We'll definitely come back ....... on a not-so-busy day.",eH8-DE48eh6xXnoKc6_lnw,0,0,3,knN06SoIFj_zhyLwXAuwWg

My friend ordered the fried catfish, it was also cooked perfectly, the breading had just enough flavor to give the fish a little kick without overpowering the taste. Her fried okra was also amazing, the coating they use tastes amazing! Unfortunately, neither of us had room for dessert. =(

Service was good and friendly. But, the food was lacking. Good food in general is a rarity and good southern food in Vegas is about as common as an oasis. 

The gravy was too damn salty. Unless you've got a major mineral deficiency and a raging salt craving to go along with it, you're gonna find the gravy they put over just about everything too salty. The meatloaf was a bit dry and hard and the flavor was smothered by the salt laden gravy. The liver was overcooked and also soaked in the gravy. The seasoning on the fried chicken was salty, too.

We got ours to go. When I got home and opened up the orders, the meatloaf and liver had two side orders each and they were both the same! Both entrees should have come with 3 sides and they should have all been different. That royally sucked. The mac & cheese was unexceptional and the cabbage was well boiled and lightly seasoned.

The fried chicken wings came with two long, oval, very dark colored waffles that were weirdly dense. I was expecting the light, fluffy, crunchy kind. They were ok with butter and syrup, but hell, styrofoam would be ok with butter and syrup.

Overall, the food and take out service was way disappointing. Again, the staff was friendly and  I was greeted with a smile, so the extra star. Otherwise, to me this is a 1-star place.",POm7GRlCIBpAaQhzZUXeRQ,0,0,2,O5IrAm_rSc6GhJmPyvUR0g

The fish was right on the point of perfection, flakey, right texture, and crispy batter. the mac and chesse was of course amazing you can taste the homemade. my friend ordered bbq chicken, she said the chicken was flavorfull and tender but her side of potatoe salad unfortunately had way too much mustard she also stated the rice and beans were pretty average. the reason im giving this place a 4 instead of 5 is because of Relly, everything we asked seemed like a bother to her. she even commented ""are you sure thats all you need"" and laughed right after! noticing we didnt take it as a joke she said just kidding after. but still succeeded to say that comment a couple more times, it made me
feel uncomfortable asking her for anything in general. for me customer service is EVERYTHING and number one important thing. i still love the place and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.",E7ELwCy8s1mT1qtmHMhKtw,0,0,4,8JrXbkfwXxrQs7TBjQQ_ow

(music stops) Oxtail won't be done for another hour....NOOOOoooo Christmas is ruined again.
What about pork chops? Smothered or fried. Holy crap....decisions...I ended with fried with mac and cheese and red beans and rice. Definitely some of the best fried pork chops I've ever had - with hot sauce....Mmmm It was crispy and juicy, full of flavor.

The last time we ate here, I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese, dressing and okra.  The wife had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes, green beans and mac n cheese.  One of the things I love about M&M is that you get 3 sides with the full meals.  Of course, we had the crispy, sweet, thin cornbread pancakes.  These are great with some butter and honey.  

The chicken, as many yelpers note, is fantastic.  A textbook crispy crust reveals juicy chicken throughout.  They make it fresh, so it comes out HOT.  All of the sides are great, but the okra really stands out to me.  Maybe that's because whenever I find okra out in Vegas I get excited, but there is more to this okra.  The breading is seasoned, I don't know what with, but it adds something that other fried okra in town lacks.   The wife's meatloaf was covered in a flavorful brown gravy.  This was a moist meatloaf, not as dense as other meatloaves.  Excellent seasoning and veggies used in the meatloaf.

Not too salty and not too greasy either.  The waffles were soft and delicious and it seemed like they were made from the same cornbread ingredients.  My life is f'n good.

4973777,2007-06-01,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Passing by M & M Soul Food Cafe, it can easily be missed.  Good thing the BF and I have an eye out for food places all the time 'cuz we're always hungry.  From the outside, there's not much to look out.  It occupies a corner spot and after walking in, you can see tables lined up past the counter to the back.

We were told to take a seat anywhere we liked and after sliding into our booth, menus were brought over.  The waitress came by to ask if she could get us beverages and you gotta get Sweet Tea ($1.50)!  (Yum! Yum!)  

Perusing through the menu, we decided to split an order since dinner was happening in a couple of hours.  We opted for the whole order of Shorts Ribs with gravy ($17.99), which is ""slowly cooked beef ribs, seasoned to perfection with gravy or BBQ.""  The whole orders come with three sides and our choice was the collared greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried okra.  (Check out the picture!)  A half order was available for $12.99, but  I'm not sure how many sides you get with the half orders.

The wait wasn't too long for our order to come, despite the warning on the menu saying there's a 20 minute wait for fried items.

The short ribs were tender and came off the bone easily.  It was flavorful and went well with the gravy.  The macaroni and cheese was a bit bland for my tastes though, but the collared greens fared a bit better.  The BF said they could have cooked the greens a bit longer for what he likes.  We especially liked the fried okra though.  It was my first time having that and we wished we had two orders of it instead.  

Other sides available included yams, black eyed peas, red beans and rice, potato salad, corn bread dressing, cabbage, string beans, and rice and gravy.  Entrees included oxtail, catfish, chitterlings, gumbo, meatloaf, fried chicken, and liver and onions.  Dessert choices were peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding.  

Service was good.  The waitress refilled our sweet tea before we had to ask and before we were even done with our first glass.  We definitely appreciate that.  She also brought out an extra plate for us so we could share our entree.  And she asked if we wanted any dessert before giving us the bill too.

Overall, the sweet tea, ribs, and fried okra were good.  The other sides were just okay.  We felt that it was a bit pricey for what we got, and both expected a larger platter of ribs.  We wouldn't mind going back to try out what else they had to offer.

Sidenote: I'm not sure if it's intimidating or not seeing this very tall man  wiping down tables as his gun and badge bounce off his hip.     

There's an 18% gratuity added for parties of six or more.

Update! 03/14/08 - The BF was craving their short ribs, so we ordered them up again.  This time they were  A  LOT more generous with their portions!  (It makes me wonder if we got shafted the last time - check it out and compare the pictures yourself!)  I wish we remembered not to get the mac n cheese, but we got black-eyed peas and fried okra this time too.

I went for the Small Seafood Gumbo which had crab (hard to eat), chunky sausage, chicken, okra, and rice.  It's pretty generous for a small portion, but there's not all that much seafood in it.  It's super gooey from all the okra 'stuff' though.  

This time we got complimentary cornbread pancakes, two each and a side of butter.  What a nice treat while you peruse the menu.  Their sweet tea tasted a bit different than before, did they change the recipe?  Overall, a better experience than the last.  I'll up it to a 3.5 from a 3 now.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,4,4,tkqxF87qt1uQXjXPIfEMFg

Came here with some friends for lunch and we ordered the fried chicken of course.  I got the smothered fried chicken but asked for the gravy on the side and picked green beans and collard greens as my sides.  My friends pretty much ordered the same things but just asked for different sides including yams and fried okra.

The reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the flavor profile is off for certain dishes.

The complimentary corn bread they served was sour.  That's right, sour instead of sweet cornbread.  I've never had sour cornbread before and didn't care for it.

I was super happy that I asked for gravy on the side because the gravy tasted exactly like the ones you make at home from powder.  Does not taste god at all!  The fried chicken was delicious though.  I ordered the dark meat and it was juicy!  The chicken itself was decently spiced but I wouldn't say it was packed with flavor.  But I didn't mind because the skin was crispy and the meat was moist.  

The collard greens are sweet.  Is that normal?  I've never had it that way but I thought it was kind of weird.

The yams.. basically like eating sugar.  SOO SWEET.  It was good but one piece was enough for me.  It was my dessert actually.

The fried okra was delicious!  I would totally order that next time.  The green beans were ok.  Very mushy and looked like it was from a can.

It was apparent the greens and yams came from a can. The mac & cheese was dry and not cheesy. The dressing was a ball of cornbread with gravy on top. Thanks to the BBQ on my baked chicken because that was the only flavor it had. My cousin had catfish and it has probably the better piece of food on the plate.

These are the kinds of places I miss from LA. Over there, the food was proper and the hospitality is abundant....it's been a long time, but frankly my broken ass self can't add hypertension to the list of issues so it's a real treat to get some Southern comfort. 

I'm with everyone that the cornbread pancakes are love. I've had these once as a cornbread pigs in a blanket in a southern mommas home. These were better. It's nothing crazy creative, but it's simple goodness comfort at it's finest. 

I had a white meat fried chicken plate with red beans and rice and collard greens. The chicken was juicy and I think the seasoning was good...slightly more salty than I normally like, but I'm not big on salt. Once I dipped in a side of gravy and hot sauce though, it was all good. Muddy water to wash it down was perfect. Red beans and rice is basic and decent, collard greens were decent. 

BF got the chicken and waffles. The waffles were interesting since they were shaped like a hot dog bun and the batter was a cinnamon batter. We thought the waffle was good alone, but that the sweet waffle got a bit too much after a while. I prefer plain waffles with chicken. I want to get these waffles for breakfast though.

We brought the BF's mom and grandma and they had a chicken plate and meatloaf. Both were very happy with it and it got the approval that they said there will be a ""next time"". The BF would like to say that he feels this is the best chicken he's had and that he wants the 5 star bump. Both his mom and he would like to add that neither are fried chicken people, but enjoyed it enough that they'd both want the chicken again. 

I'm saying this is good, solid fare, but it's not the absolute best Mississippi cooking I've had.....but I'd have to fly out to go get to my favorite food spot though. I felt the food after, but that isn't their fault my busted self indulged in fatty chicken and salts. Worth it though- drinking plenty of water to flush it out. 4 stars for the food.

With me, the 5 star bump is definitely because of the staff. We walked in and the owner greeted us enthusiastically. Our server was sweet and our service was attentive. Our server even offered to pull me up a to-go muddy water since everyone was finished with foods, but I was still thirsty and took just a gulp to finish it off.  When our plates came except the BF's, the owner noticed and went up to the window to check up on the kitchen and promptly brought out his order. Gotta appreciate an owner who has a hand in the smooth operation. And speaking of the line, it's crazy how they kick it old school without any tickets and call out the order- the kitchen doesn't mess up orders much either. Food never sits longer than a few seconds on the pass so food is hot and fresh for everyone. Sure, it takes a while to get some foods, but it was busy and everything is fried up fresh. I'd be worried if it didn't take a moment to make since everything should be fresh....I think we're so used to fast foods that most people might think it's a long wait.

5091770,2009-07-09,2,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"First, a disclaimer: this review is PURELY for the chicken and waffles. 

DELICIOUS!

Look. I first tried it on a Saturday morning. The waffles come out, two of them, unusual in that the mold they use is not the standard ""round"" one but more of a hotdog bun shape- and light, tender and fluffy, piping hot. 

The chicken... it was three massive wings piping hot. When we bit into them they fair EXPLODED with juiciness and chicken deliciousness. Crisp on the outside, teeming with seasonings and flavor, and it was just all done SO well. 

Reason I felt I had to put a review out there was that I finally got to try Roscoe's- not in LA but in Long Beach. Same chain though, right? I was ready for them to blow M&M's away due to all the hype, but was I disappointed. There was no comparing the wings (sadly small and a little dry) compared to the wings at M&M's. Well seasoned, but dry. Waffles were the standard round shape and had a charming cinnamon aspect to them. They were delicious, but the difference in quality of fried chicken really brought M&M's forward in the race. 

The verdict? I'm just glad we in Las Vegas can enjoy TRULY delicious Chicken and Waffles.. without having to venture outside Sin City :)",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,1,0,5,LE1X8s1qTNapLhSl8j_I3g

Worst of all was an area in the back of their dining room that is set off for preparing drinks and such. Usually it seems it's behind a partition, like an office cubicle. But on this day the wall was missing and several large, damp, smelly, uncovered trash cans were brought out and set down. In the middle of the floor. Of the dining area. Where people were eating.

Then our booth seating started to come apart. I'm not making this up, it came unattached in the corner curve of the seat and started to slide out while we were sitting in it.

Our food, when it was brought out, was the restaurant's usual quality. I used to love their water cakes most of all - cornbread served as pancakes. But by this time we didn't want to stay and eat it.

Later that day I found them listed in recent Restaurant Reports in the good old Review-Journal. The most recent one found M&M's with only a few demerits and upgraded to an A. The original report a few weeks before that had so many demerits they were two points shy of immediate closure.

Another Mom adventure ended with me in a booth at M&M. She said she wanted vegetables, so I knew she meant mushy items that appeared to have been vegetables at some point before they were cooked beyond recognition with a piece of pork, i.e. Southern vegetables. It may sound as if I am saying something bad about Southern style vegetables, but I am not. I love Southern food. I didn't even realize you could steam a vegetable until after I graduated from college, and I turned out okay. 

The ambiance is like Mel's Diner from Alice. The booths sag a little, but if you scoot all the way over, you won't even notice. 

The service was all smiles, and when she asked if we wanted cornbread, we said, ""Yes,"" but we were not prepared for the goodness that landed on the table. We were expecting little rectangles or maybe a wedge, so when the pancakes arrived we were a little confused (I had never seen a cornbread pancake!), until we took a bite and became insanely happy. Honestly, they could have brought Meow Mix to the table after those pancakes, and I would have been just fine. I think I ate my first serving of cornbread in under one minute. You better believe we came home with some pancakes for the fridge.

My mom and I both had vegetable plates. The fried okra was good, but I must say the steamed cabbage and cornbread dressing were not the best. I can definitely steam up cabbage more to my liking at home, and I should have skipped the cornbread dressing to save room for the pancakes. Lesson learned.

It was further backed up by the valet at our hotel saying, ""M & M Soul Food had the best 'greens EVER."" AND then our car driver to the location also verified this place by saying, ""The chicken wings and waffles are the best he's ever had.""

So, along we went. our driver was good enough to give us his cell number to get a ride back to our hotel. M & M is a bit out of the way for hotel tourists. It's about 1 to 1-1/2 miles further west than the Outdoor Premium outlets on W. Charleston Blvd.

There were four of us and we tried the fried chicken (Dark and White meat), and Ox Tail, we also had a side of Pork Chops (one fried and one with gravy) and the waffles.

Each full order (around $13) comes with your choice of 3-sides. The half orders (around $10) come with 2-sides. I can't remember all the choices of sides, but some are: red beans and rice, collard greens, string beans, yams, mac and cheese, fried okra rice and gravy...  We tried almost all the sides and the Greens are very very tasty, but all the other sides were good too...

You can get the Wings and waffles all day long, but breakfast is only served till 11:00 am, so if you want eggs and grits, you gotta come early.

Oh, and their version of the Arnold Palmer is called, ""Muddy water""... just a hint.

A long-term member of my Las Vegas short list I'd originally planned to visit M&M Soul Food with a friend over a year prior when the flu confined me to my hotel room and as such perhaps it should have been no surprise when it was myself suddenly facing a last minute cancellation this time around, the resulting solo visit a bit of letdown in more ways than one.  Obviously not brought up on ""Soul Food"" but raised close enough to Detroit that it played a big part in childhood memories I've since sought out, those looking for collards, chitlins, or gumbo should be aware that none are available before noon on weekends (despite the online annotated 11am,) nor is fried chicken beyond the wing (though if you ask nicely they may be able to accommodate after a substantial delay...IE, the thigh arrived with dessert,)  and moving past these inconveniences be advised that service, while friendly, is constrained - a pair of young ladies and an elderly fellow managing a capacity crowd of ~80 with wait times up to an hour during my stay.  Moving past the 'issues' and onto the food and décor suffice it to say that the interior replicates the façade and with a small kitchen at work behind makeshift walls the food arrived at an awkward pace with mixed results, particularly in the proteins where both pork chop and breast were dry and flavorless despite excellent, crispy breading while the thigh was expectedly more succulent but also far better seasoned, as if from an entirely different batch.  Speaking to the rest, mostly carbs and a pair of over easy eggs, it was in these items that M&M shined - the waffles a soft wheat batter and the 'cornbread' a pair of pan fried flapjacks needing only a touch of syrup to balance the savory notes, something neither the sweet potato pie nor the banana pudding would require at all - the former a well done classic and the second far more dense than any take on the dish I've found and all the better for it, a sort of bread pudding made with only a bit of liquid and a lot of ripe bananas juxtaposing softened nilla wafers.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,1,3,-K2g9mcIcYSqmHGwEl0jGw

5356085,2013-02-22,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"This place is amazing!!!!! Best fried chicken my taste buds have ever had.

Tip: This is not a traditional restaurant with a hostess stand, you have to look for an open table. If you have a large group, then let them know exactly how many and once a table opens up, they will make sure your group gets seated so a party of 2 won't sit at a table for 6.

The servers are all friendly and welcoming. We felt like we went to a friend's relatives house for dinner. 

Recent family vacation, we stayed at Red Rock and looking to grub. We wanted fried chicken and were going to hit up Canes (chain known for chicken fingers), but we were looking for a more sit down place. We Yelped nearby spots and found M&M Soul Food with 4 stars. We went in with a party of 9, We waited about 15 - 20 mins to be seated, but that was fine because were really busy. 

After being seated we knew what we wanted after looking at the menu and with our big appetites, we ordered everything. 
Appetizers: Hot wings, sausage links.
Entrees: Gumbo, 2 full orders of Fried chicken with gravy on the side. Chicken comes with 3 side items each and Cornbread pancakes

The hot wings were made perfectly crisp with the hot sauce on the side. I prefer it this way so you can actually taste the chicken. The entree fried chicken had so much flavor and right amount of crisp. It wasn't overly breaded like other places do to get that crunch. The gravy was not too salty, too thick, or too thin. And the gumbo, oh the gumbo was filled with meat. They filled that sucker with sausage, full crab legs, and chicken. Every bite had so much meat, flavor, and deliciousness! 

If you are looking for homemade chicken with lots of flavor and taste that will melt in your mouth, then definitely give this place a try.",RAXHhcGjhc1xoiZjIqfa5w,5,3,5,ceW19hUx0fQvnIE7IJ5ibA

My sister is on this obnoxious health kick where she cringes at the mention of good food. I am from the school of eat it in moderation, so I dragged her here anyways.

What we ordered? Three piece dark meat meal and the oxtails. Like people have mentioned before, there is a disclaimer that it takes 20 minutes for fried food. We were sitting there for five minutes and got our food before people who were there before us. We were surprised, but were not worried because the food was amazing. The fried chicken was super moist, crispy, and steaming hot. My sister got a side of fried okra, green beans, and mac'n'cheese. I got yams, greens, and red beans and rice. All my sides were way better. She loved hers, but my choices were still infinitely superior. The oxtail was generously portioned and fall off the bone tender. There was so much food that we were able to pack a box to take home. I know it is bound to be a delicious snack later.

5393779,2011-08-20,6,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"So where to begin? 
My boyfriend had been to this place several times and said it was pretty good. They only serve breakfast until 11am, so a lot of the time on his days off and late nights we woke up well after this *gotta love vegas*

We visited this establishment 8/17/2011 around 10am.  We entered through the back door, the side where the salvation army is.Plenty of booths and tables open, we waited to be sat. There were two people working ,and the place wasn't crazy busy being it was a Wednesday. An older African American man and a younger African American woman with a ""four leaf clover on her neck"". The gentleman sat us and took our drink order. We waited about 5 mins after that to place our order. In this time around 5 Asian people came in and sat in the back corner, an African American older gentleman sat at the table behind my boyfriend alone and an older African American couple sat two booths back.  no problems thus far. The woman came over and didn't even look at either of us while she took our order. She seemed like she was irritated. At the time i didn't think anything of it. I ordered turkey sausage and eggs he ordered hot links and eggs. Simple right? 
So the 5 Asian people get their food, then the gentleman alone gets his food, then the older couple gets their food. AND WE STILL HAVE NO FOOD ON THE TABLE! ITS 10:45!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not once did anyone stop by the table and let us know if we ordered something they were out of or that our food would be out shortly.
 My boyfriend is African American and i am mixed *black and white
* *I have tan skin and light hair so most people don't know im mixed.*
I tell my boyfriend that i feel we are being discriminated against, And that i have experienced this before with my parents when i was younger. I wondered why the waitress didn't even look at us! You work for tips don't you? Arent you supposed to be nice and accommodating to your customers?!!!?!??! Its a shame that you couldn't provide proper service because you didn't appreciate the fact i was with a African American man. I could understand if one table got their food before us. But a party of 5 at one table, a party of one, and a party of two. THAT'S 8 PEOPLE THAT PLACED THEIR ORDER AFTER US! AND WE ONLY ORDERED EGGS AND SAUSAGE! THAT DOESN'T TAKE 45 MINS! 
I tell my boyfriend that i am DISGUSTED and i will not be eating anything from this place. He says he wants to ask the waitress whats going on. At this time i walk out of the place and he stays behind trying to find out whats going on.
I am in tears in the car, stomach in knots in disbelief that its almost 2012 and things like this still go on. I now appreciate my African American father and Italian Greek mother even more for the things they had to go through to be together! I never realized the society we were living in.
 I will be filing a complaint with the better business bureau today. And contacting the news to let them know about this. I had a good mind to stand on the sidewalk with a sign saying ""IF YOU ARE AN INTER-RACIAL COUPLE YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T WELCOME HERE!""

I HOPE THE OWNER READS THIS AND TAKES MY COMPLAINT TO HEART. ""4 LEAF CLOVER LADY AS WELL"" REVERSE RACISM IS NOT RIGHT",1PHVlRRHZmGTQQt4_zEBAA,1,0,1,a_sNW8UVd7O_-rjJQaov4g

They start you off with cornbread pancakes, the most fluffy, buttery little flapjacks you've ever had, and they keep them coming all throughout the meal (so you can get very full just on those!). Drinks are served in jam jars, of course, and anything other than water costs around 2-3$, including red Kool-Aid.
They have two specials : One serving of your main dish and two sides, or two servings of your main dish, and three sides.
One is enough for me, and I get the battered and fried catfish strips with fried okra, sweet potatoes, or potato salad. The fish is always right out of the frier hot (they warn that fried foods may take up to 20 minutes, so be prepared) and very crispy. They serve it with lemon and you have vinegar at the table if you need it.

The food is so seriously delicious. I went with two other people and we all ordered different entrees and 'Muddy Water"" served in a Mason Jar. MMMM! MMM! We were 'sampling' off of each others plates. Everything was sooooo good and served at just the right temperature. 

The atmosphere was pleasant with many 'first-timers' for a Saturday night. At the table next to me, I met some nice ladies from Monterrey California (near my hometown)  that heard about M & M.  

I have to say, that when I walked in I was pleasantly surprised with the warm greetings from the servers.  I really loved the pleated tuxedo white shirts and bow-ties. Nice! Very Nice!  The servers were so busy, so polite, and gave plenty of smiles for everyone. 

What I saw different at this restaurant, was how often the servers assisted each other.  I had not seen 'teamwork' like that before. I applaud their performance. 

I live on the other side of town from M & M and I'm definitely going back for more! I just need to stop telling so many people about the delicious food at this restaurant.  Next time, I get there, there will be a line outside the door to get in. 

Thank you M & M Soul Food, for not only the delicious cooking, thank you for all your thoughtfulness in making our dinner experience a pleasant evening.

5516381,2014-01-20,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Why is this place so loved? We've been wanting to know and finally tried them. We're from Cleveland, an old industrial town with real soul food, plus my partner cooks and comes from that tradition. 

I ordered BBQ chicken, cornbread dressing with gravy,  and mac & cheese. My partner had fried catfish, the same sides, plus potato salad, along with chitlins, since you can't find them easily. 

First, they brought out pancake-style cornbread that tasted a bit like a greased skillet.  My partner's entree arrived several minutes before mine, so I got a preview of my side dishes.  We were both surprised at the lack of seasoning. The dressing was a soft, gritty serving with no discernible flavoring other than some sage. No onion, salt, pepper- very odd.   The macaroni and cheese was somewhat hard, with congealed clumps of cheese. The potato salad was more like mashed-potato salad, the flavor wasn't horrible but it was mostly of sweet pickles. 

My BBQ chicken was a huge disappointment. Just a small, baked, drumstick and thigh with bottled sauce (it appears) poured over them. Huh? My partner's full serving of catfish was largely devoid of seasoning, although it was cooked all right. The extra $4 for the third side and half a piece of fish was not worth the price. 

The first bite of chitlins went into a napkin and were declared ""awful.""  I'm no chitlin eater- the smell alone was making me gag, but my partner, who has both eaten and cooked them, couldn't stomach these. 

The server was pleasant but never cleared the table or asked how we liked the food. With so many great ratings maybe she didn't think it necessary to ask. We won't be coming back.   We've done this better at home for less money.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,10,2,1,iooE9VrYnMAN6Q1ynB4HGQ

5580344,2013-04-03,1,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Ok...I'm always hesitant to go to a soul food restaurant. Although I hardly ever eat it now, I was raised on soul food in a family of the best soul food cooks ever. Today was my birthday and my partner surprised me with a trip to M &M. The facility seems very much updated from some of the pics that I've seen on Yelp. It has the feel of a diner. It was very clean and comfortable. I will say that I was a little paranoid with the security guard in front of me with a gun. Interesting, but I suppose I should be happy. 

The food...to my surprise...VERY GOOD! I had mac & cheese, collard greens, and potato salad. Oh...dare I forget...chitterlings. I was politely corrected...chitlins...I was always corrected as a child too... The corn bread that they bring before the meal was amazing. It was round, light, sweet, and YUM. Then came the meal. The collards were superbly cooked and seasoned. The potato salad was delectable. The mac & cheese was a tad dry,  but good. The ""chitterlings"" were scrumptious...people passed my table and were asking how they were. I think in general, people are scared to eat them. DON'T BE SCARED....just order and enjoy. My partner ordered rice and beans(just ok), yams (very sweet and good), and BBQ chicken. I was very disappointed in the chicken only because it seemed as if they took their baked chicken and put BBQ sauce on it. That's not BBQ chicken. The baked chicken was good and the BBQ sauce was good, but it wasn't BBQ chicken. Lol...

The service was really good. Our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful with food choices. Our food arrived quickly. The prices were comparable to other soul food restaurants. That's another topic that I won't even go into. Overall...a solid four and maybe 4.5 stars.",j9vih1KD2r-NLlaHfZPkRA,5,1,4,oPC5YZ3OAtgpSBJLuYJprQ

Went around lunch time and it was packed, so we sat at the counter.  Service was slow, I mean the type of slow where you consider getting up and leaving.  You get better service at Chinese restaurants in china town. (that is not good).

We ordered as soon as we were finally acknowledged.  It took a good 5 minutes just to get a glass of water.  15 minutes after sitting down we got some little corn cakes.  These were thin corn pancakes.  Did not like them. I could taste the baking powder in them.  Why can't I get a piece of good cornbread at a soul food place!!????  WHY????????  Not a pancake, muffin or fritter - but a piece of damn cornbread!

Then 49 minutes after sitting down and people who came in after us getting their food... we got our 2 orders of chicken and waffles plus greens and mac and cheese.  Waitress forgot our sides - had to ask.

The chicken was good.  It was crispy and juicy.  Big wings too. The waffles were different and damn good.  They may have been wheat with a cinnamon flavor.  Not sure.  They were fluffy and had a nice shell to the outside.  Just right.  I ate the 2 off my plate and another off my daughters!  The mac and cheese was ok.  The greens - I was a little disappointed.  Too much of the ribs were in the greens and they just seemed a little tired.

The service wasn't bad, the ladies there working were working hard, but the service was just blasé.  Places like this get so used to being busy - they forget what got them there.  Waiting close to an hour for your dinner is wrong and not even saying anything to placate the customer is even worse.  You get the if you don't like you can leave attitude here.

I sat at the counter and I could see in the back.  It was a mess, and that just makes me wonder.

I wanted to give this place 5 stars - I really did.  The food wasn't good enough to overcome the lackluster service and curt attitude.  The greens and corncakes were poorly done.  Strangely enough I will go back, but with lower expectations.

I have yet to find a soul food joint in Vegas that has friendly service, real good food, clean establishment and a decent piece of cornbread!",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,0,3,xJN2qnPTqVvBa4sFpC48sQ

Who:  Party of 8, including the BF, BFF, L.T.D., and the Qs.
When:  Thursday, 11/6/14, 7:30pm
What:  Oxtail, mac n cheese, potato salad, and sweet tea for me.  Others had fried chicken, meatloaf, catfish, red beans and rice, yams, mashed potatoes, cornbread dressing with gravy, and peach cobbler.

There's nothing better than a good meal with your favorite people.  It's been a few years since I've been back to M & M, but I'm glad we paid a visit last night because that's what we had.  It's that time of year when the belly wants comfort food like ramen or Southern food.  We had ramen last week, so oxtail sounded like a good idea.  We showed up at 7:30pm and immediately learned that the restaurant closes at 8:00pm, not 9:00pm as their Yelp listing says.  Hoping we wouldn't get turned away, the M&M staff was very accommodating and told us that we wouldn't get kicked out due to it being so close to quitting time, but that we should order ASAP, especially if we wanted any of the fried items.  Two tables were cleaned off quickly and put together for us and we were seated posthaste.  Our waitress, Shy, was fabulous; that lady got our orders as soon as we made our decisions.  Soon enough, we were drinking (sweet tea, Muddy Water, regular un-muddy water), eating the delicious complimentary cornbread pancakes, watching Thursday Night Football on the flat screens, and getting caught up while we waited for our food.  Somehow the last person to arrive got her food first: whut?  And, it was fried chicken so the staff wasn't wasting any time getting us fed.  Soon after, everyone else's plates arrived, we got down on the good stuff, and silence ensued.  I love oxtail and my order was just the way I like it:  tender, fall-off-the-bone goodness.  Unfortunately, my side choices were a tad disappointing this go-round.  The mac n cheese lacked flavor and I had to salt it, something I rarely do.  The scoop of potato salad was just okay, as well; I've definitely had better.  But, the b/f's yams and cornbread dressing were on point, so I'd get those next time.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals and we concurred that it was another fabulous fall meal.  Shy split the check four ways which was also greatly appreciated; the whole staff there was great, actually.  It's safe to say that we'll be back for more soul food at M&M this holiday season; check it out if you need some comfort, too.

Its amazing! Always had great service, great food! 
It is a little ways from the strip but so worth going to if your in town. Its one of those hole in the wall places you would never expect to get such great food!
From the moment you sit and get your drinks and the corn cake that come out hot and once you try it you will want more! They are the best I have ever had.
The fried chicken is so good! Along with their cooked cabbage, mac and cheese. The sides are really good. Everytime I want some good fried Chicken this is where we go!
No one in town makes it as good as this place. Great Comfort food at its best! 
Everyone is always so friendly and very welcoming. 
Everyone we bring loves this place too!

5848363,2012-10-23,4,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"I love how they start your meal off with complimentary cornbread pancakes, that was yummy for sure.

We were in the mood for breakfast however during the week they stop serving breakfast at 11am, so we ordered off the lunch/dinner menu instead.

I decided on short ribs with mac and cheese, cornbread stuffing for my sides. My babez ordered meatloaf, mac and cheese, fried okra.  We both ordered half orders which come with two sides. 

I ordered the kool-aid which they give free refills on and I love how they serve the drinks out of mason jars that is an Awesome cute touch!

The kool-aid was delicious, just like the 80's kool-aid I grew up on! I sure wish I could make it this good at home!

The food was good but I had such high expectations that I found myself disappointed with the overall food. :(

The mac and cheese, we both prefer my homemade classic recipe I make at home as theirs was good but nothing I would have to come here to eat. The fried okra has a thick cornmeal batter on it that kind of overpowers the taste of the okra. The cornbread stuffing is made with real cornmeal cornbread however was dry, without the gravy on top I would not have finished it. I make better meals than this at home, so I don't know if I can justify coming back for a meal. However may be back for Kool-aid and to try their banana pudding dessert! The short ribs were tender and delicious for sure, as I really enjoyed the meat falling off of the bone!

The star at this place is the kool-aid and the Fantastic service! The Servers at this joint really know how to make you feel welcome!

We might be back to give it another shot and order different things on the menu as I am just not satisfied wih this rating. I want it to be better than just OK so I will really make an attempt to come back and try again. I really wanted to love it, however I was just disappointed because it was nothing special and did not live up to the hype!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,5,6,3,Qci_Xg8hKFDJtdfik8mMhw
5848768,2015-06-29,3,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"Waitresses make you feel right at home. ""Baby, don't be shy about the cornbread."" Oh honey, we weren't. I honestly can't recall how many stacks my party went through. Say goodbye to that Vegas diet..

Most of us ordered the chicken. Fried. Baked. Smothered. However you like it. It was tender and juicy - never dry. The sauce can be a bit much so opt out if you don't like your fried chicken soggy. 

As for the sides, I tried the yams, fried okras, and mashed potatoes. All were pretty standard, but I think the mash deserves a bit more butter. 

Overall, I would say food was not bad but +1 for the amazing, attentive service even on a busy night.

Mac and cheese leaves a lot to be desired. Their world famous gravy is so goood. Green beans have a great flavor even if they are out of a can. Yams are very tasty also. Over all a good meal.

5887064,2009-01-31,0,NLEe-RzDSU-5BN6xp_WWCw,"I ate at the M&M Soul Food Cafe TWICE today.  I'm almost embarrassed to say that I tried all of the following.  For breakfast, I tried fried chicken wings, waffles, scrambled eggs, and home fried potatoes.  For dinner, I had the beef ribs, ox tails, greens, black eyed peas, corn bread pancakes, and macaroni and cheese.  I also had one of my wife's pieces of smothered fried chicken.  I believe that all of this gives me enough information to provide a comprehensive opinion on the restaurant.

This was simply the best restaurant that I've eaten at.  I should not have eaten as much as I did but I just couldn't help myself!  I just kept eating and eating.  This is the kind of food my mother used to make but doesn't anymore because it would take days!  Well, she never did fry chicken for breakfast to go with waffles.  The chicken was served on bones like chicken is supposed to be and the you've just not lived until you've slurped on some ox tails in public.  The breakfast potatoes were to die for as they were nicely browned and well seasoned.

Although I didn't try it, my wife enjoyed her turkey sausage and didn't mind going back for a second time in the same day.  The beef ribs are cross cut like riblets and offered with BBQ sauce or gravy.

I want to go back again because these were stupid huge plates of food and I simply didn't have room for any dessert (banana pudding, peach cobbler, chocolate cake, yellow cake, sweet potato pie).

The owners enjoyed watching someone who really enjoyed their cooking throwing it down.  If you're visiting Las Vegas, this is worth the short drive away from the Strip.",8AQjx9F-RkwWPhz5NgSGkg,0,0,5,onH1AMHtK3T44v_w9Yzrcw

The service level has taken a serious dive. The waitresses were too busy chatting and cackling with each other,  to even greet us at the door. Once we were seated, it took approx. 5 minutes just to place our drink order.

Being checked on, during the meal...no such luck!

This place has gone downhill, it's certainly not the place it was during our last visits. We come up from California, so, this is not even worth adding to our to-do list.",xqQvbTL4GKVt0q-mw_2oNw,2,0,3,lHjkvG9Zaw6vozdgAFjz1w

The cornbread pancakes are so good. What a nice way to launch into you're meal.  Some of you may be disgusted and I don't care but I'm a huge fan of Chitterlings and I got a good serving at M&M's. Taste almost as good as mine and my Mom's.  Add Mac n' Cheese, Collard's and rice and gravy and I was a happy camper.

I have been preparing vegan meals these past few days and my carnivorous husband has been such a trooper trying my cooking.  Well, apparently tonight he had enough of the kale and soy protein posing as beef, and was in the mood for some good ol' soul food. 

With a raving recommendation from one of his patients- we gave M&M Soul Food Cafe a try.  The complimentary cornbread pancakes already made such a great first impression.  Being a loyal customer of the original Roscoe's House of chicken and waffles in LA, I had to try M&M's version.  I feel like such a traitor because Roscoe's has NOTHING on them.  The seasoning on the fried chicken wings was so delicious, I was actually licking my fingers after every bite.  It was perfectly seasoned and not overly salty at all.  The waffles were also fabulous. A little sweeter than I am used to, but that was OK because it just meant I didn't need the syrup. The sweet and salty combo was perfection.  I ordered a side of fried okra which were OK and the collard greens that I devoured. 

My husband ordered the smothered chicken (dark meat) and that too was delicious. He ordered sides of yams and mac n' cheese.  The sides were good too, but the chicken was definitely the star.  There is no ""kids menu"" but our toddler daughter ate from our plates and was licking her fingers too!

To top it off, we finished the meal with some peach cobbler and it was the perfect sweet finish to a fabulous meal.  We originally wanted to try the BBQ short ribs but they had just run out when we came in, so that just gives us an excuse to come back even sooner (after a few nights of vegan meals, of course). 

Tim, the owner, made us feel at home from the second we sat down to the second we walked out the door.  And we actually did feel like we were at home, because we were able to watch the NBA playoffs as well.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,7,3,4,3Ru1pGHGSnWL0Hjuc0doAg
