I immediately stopped her and asked what she was doing.. she had the tortillas to my tacos in her bare hands after charging me. She was mortified and just looked at me. I asked her in Spanish"" what are you doing, do you plan on washing your hands?""... she stuttered a response of "" I didn't touch money though""... and I said "" you charged my card, and touched the register""... her comeback was "" this is for me""... she put the tortillas down on the counter and disappeared. She never came back out. I seriously stared at them the entire time they cooked my food.. scared to death they will spit in food! Haha! Don't think we will be back. Sucks because the food is good.. would NEVER order drive thru.. especially after homegirl tried to cook my food without washing hands... yuk!",DXG949oK7yaM-4_v-niEdA,0,0,3,hDf1MmPXKlkJ2_LDsBEZvw
159122,2015-07-05,4,G8LBVca1vOBKYeMCMpajGA,"I asked the lady at 7-11 if this place was any good. She whispered in my ear the Health Dept. wrote them up 2 days ago, for what she did not know. Upon entering I noticed they hung their health department certificate of C way up high near the ceiling...probably so people wouldn't see it. 

I took a chance & ordered the carnitas nachos. You get A LOT of meat. The shredded cheese wasn't melted thoroughly. The sour cream was more of a white sauce. The refried beans were acceptable. There was a bunch of fatty oil at the bottom of the plate. THERE WAS MORE FAT THAN MEAT!!  Gross. Nothing worse than biting into a chunk of fat. Clearly the meat hadn't been trimmed...it was everywhere. The meat I did see was dry. The flavor...after 6 hours I still taste it. There was nothing fresh about these nachos. 

The menu is WAY to big, comprised of lots of pictures. Burrito, enchilada, taco, quesadilla offerings are literally in small print. I was standing right beneath the menu & still had difficulty reading it with my glasses!!

After hearing a friend rave about this place for months I decided to try it. I seriously doubt I'll be back. I'm not keen on Mexican food to begin with, so I know great Mexican food when I have it. This was not even decent Mexican food. It was just nasty on a plate covered with cheese.  There is nothing legit, or great, or bomb about this place.

They have no fish sauce from my knowledge the torta was wet and mushy on the bottom. The fries were tasteless with no seasoning. I can make fries better than these guys at home with a sprinkle of salt.

I ordered food off of grub hub and paid 37 dollars for a wet burrito , taco salad and taquitos with a side of Pico. Order came fairly quickly no issues there. We waited a good 5 minutes to finish up with customers before we started to try to eat. Opened up all the bags and low and behold no utensils and no Pico that I paid 1.50 extra for. We made a unanimous decision to buy cutlery at Albertsons because it was quicker than asking them to bring us forks . I called the restaurant to tell them what happened a young lady answered mumbling every word that came out of her mouth.  I told her I ordered off of grub hub and didn't receive forks or Pico. She then tried to argue with me regarding the instructions on my receipt. I guess they were clearly understood . Might I add that you have to list your phone number on this app in case there are any issues or questions regarding your order. After I explained to her she was yelling at the guys in the background in Spanish then told me "" it's not my fault I just got here"". I requested to speak to a manager she said he's not here. I then waited until Monday to call because he was gone until then  ( this incident happened on a Saturday) . I called Monday same lady answered same mumbling occurred she stated again "" he isn't here , who's this "" as if it was her cell phone I called . I then called again Wednesday and young lady mumbling again said "" he left early , what's this about "" . I made multiple attempts to call the manager . I contacted grub hub to let them know about the incident.  I'm not made about the price even though it was high . I'm not mad about the food even though it was mediocre.  I am mad about the lack of customer service I received . Although I'm sure besides the issues I had with this young lady I'm sure she is a hard worker. She is obviously trusted to handle money from the till. She is also trusted to take orders and phone calls. She needs to be trained If someone is going to represent a buisiness properly . She needs to be trained on how to handle customer complaints. And if it is out of her job description she needs to be trained on how to take a message and how to relay one to the manager so that then can handle the issue properly .

Naaaaaaahhh! Not even close, they should really change the name.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito from here expecting chicken, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese.  Instead, I got rice, cheese, and like 2 table spoons of chicken that tasted old and had plenty of ligaments I had to spit out.  Good thing a ordered one of their mini Carne asada tacos which came with beans and chips on the side.

The inside is dirty and the tables were filthy.  The workers seemed like they didn't wanna be there and had a face on them like someone just stole their sombrero.

I need to find out the hours the good passionate cook works...

this place is literally the best and absolute WORST mexican food in Vegas.

It just depends on when you go. There is a cook there you can tell actually cares about making good food.. and when hes working the food comes out absolutely amazing!!!! 5 stars!!!

But then, half the time I order, i can barely eat it.... its sad... you can tell the cook just slopped shit together and gave ZERO shits if the food was good...

No passion nor care for service... im trying to figure out this cooks schedule. because the other ones are ruining the restaurant. They have all the ingredients they need back there to make good food... its a shame more than half your cooks dont have the passion, nor the care! to make good food.... seriously its night and day.... its either amazing, or non edible...

Owner needs to crack down or hire a manager who isn't hiring garbage friends.

I bet every bad review is coming from those shitty cooks too... the good one is a gem and i bet every good review is from when he was working. smh...",G9lr5covEbqGPLlHj5cS6w,2,0,3,G5Gs0Z-e2J3kZqrwCYnThA

Time was around 1 Am and I was the only customer early Thursday morning.

So for the food: Combo No#5. Hard Shell shredded Beef Taco, the Taco was tasty filled with tender flavorful beef. Completely acceptable.

Cheese Enchilada stuffed with Cheese and sprinkled with cheese, a decent sauce and shredded lettuce. Completely acceptable.

The Spanish Rice was good, it had a nice flavor and was properly cooked.

The Refried Beans also impressive with great flavor.

They have a variety of fresh hot sauces and Hot Carrots, sadly the Red sauce had a strong tap water taste and the Red is usually my Favorite type. The other Sauces we're just fine with a spicy zip.

The Breakfast Burrito is huge! I placed it side by side with a Mixed Burrito to show the comparison.

The menu is pretty extensive for such small place between the plates, mini tacos, and just lot lot more. They even have two separate menus one that has pictures of most of the plate items (all numbered make it easier), the pics nice size so you can easily see them, and get good idea what you would be getting if order it. The regular menu kind of all over the place so if undecided kind of makes decision harder.

 I love my lengua comes too my tacos. So I had too get couple orders of the mini tacos lengua style. I order something off the regular menu burrito and enchilada plate. The lengua thought was ok. They were generous with the amount of protein always good thing in life! It comes with refried beans and chips. The refried beans for me just plain and not very good. It was little more chunkier then normal spots go too when get my taco fix. Just felt like no real flavor too them. The lengua tacos were good but nothing special. The combination plate the enchilada was just that nothing special and the sauce could have had more flavor. Burrito it was OK. Nothing skimpy about it. It packed with shredded meat with some onions and green bell peppers. The meat was moist and overall ok nothing that wowed me. Really the general theme through out my whole meal felt was OKKKK. The price you pay is very reasonable and portion size get your money worth. If in the mood for more authentic mexican food not the place would stop by. If want something quick, easy, and bang for your buck Felipito Mexican is great choice.

Comes too personality nothing better then going too gas station for some mexican food! It located next too the mini mart in the gas station. Ok might not be that original considering they're McDonalds or different mexican restaurants at other gas stations.

I'm utterly obsessed with flautas. It happened once I was pregnant with my daughter leilah. She's 10 months & I'm still craving them. Good for the taste buds, not so much for my fat ass. 

Didn't know about this place until my father in law brought it home yesterday. He also brought their homemade salsa (Its a yellow green color with a little red tint) It literally is the best salsa I've ever had. I ate about 4 containers. It is spicy yet refreshing. Yu know its good salsa when you can eat a shit ton and not get heart burn. Felipito's FTW! He brought me their flautas, which come with guac, sour cream and a ton of cheese. Which i love. I don't go to robertos anymore because they put literally a pinch of cheese. Here, your food is worth every time. 

My father in law told me that they are very reasonable, especially for the amount of food they had. My inlaws were able to share a chile relleno combo. They got the horchata and loved it.

3667423,2018-03-09,0,G8LBVca1vOBKYeMCMpajGA,"The drive thru lady that helped me was pleasant at first while I ordered and my kids liked their beans that came with their cheese enchilada meals. Other than that, well let me start from the beginning...
I pull up to the drive-thru menu, not turned off at all by it being attached to a gas station because past experiences with Mexican food in other gas stations, backs of grocery stores, and dive taco trucks have left me super happy and a return customer. Location was a-okay with me. I was the only one in the drive-thru line and she either couldn't hear me well or couldn't understand me but asked me to pull to the window.  This took away the menu for me to choose from, but no worries, they can help just fine.  Further into the drive I had to navigate my truck around 2 medium size boxes that made their home in the lane. Was it wind that carried them both in? Just poorly cared for grounds? Hmm. 
I pull around and for dinner time it really surprised me that the inside was totally dark, except a low light coming from what I assume was the kitchen area. Not another person in sight, and I began to wonder if I should order.  We were pretty hungry though so I put in my order request. She was kind while I ordered.  My order was relatively basic, just got carne asada chimichanga enchilada style, bean and cheese burrito enchilada style,  2 orders of cheese enchiladas, all with rice and beans and chips and salsa. Asked if they had dessert and they only had churros so we got 4 of them too.  I paid, tipped a few bucks even though it is drive thru and I wasn't being ""served"" so to speak.  Everything came to right under $50. When she handed my card back, that was the last time she spoke. I waited 20 solid minutes from then to get our food.  No other customers pulled in, walked in, or were already inside. 20 minutes, but I was patient none the less, hoping the food would be fresh for a wait like that in a drive thru. 
Finally I was given my food.  2 bags, I thanked her with each one handed to me and found myself saying ""have a good night!"" as if she were the customer and I the friendly worker for some reason. Not a word from her, just the windows smacked shut and no lingering at the window. Weird. Whatever, I have my food now.  Finally. 
I arrive home with the grub and first thing my husband says is ""No chips and salsa?"" *sigh* Damn it, we just paid for food we didn't get but we are at the hangry stage now, kids are anxious to get their meals, so it is shrugged off as a loss. 
More disappointment ensued when we see that their enchiladas were cold enough the cheese was a congealed mess instead of melted and warm. Grr. We live less than 1.5 miles away. Why was it already cold enough to do that? My carne asada chimi was my least favorite I have ever had.  The steak was tiny cubes, loads of onion and no heat to balance it out at all, and the tortilla was soggy in spite of it being deep fried. (P.S I absolutely HATE that word, soggy, so for me to include it in my vocabulary is a shuddering, gag me now trigger, but there is no other substitute in this case to drive this home) 
My husband's food was the last straw. The burrito was inedible.  Something was totally off about it. Ever bit into day old lettuce or tomato on a burger? That funky taste that just screams ""don't eat me!"" and you know rihgt away that this is not the meal you were looking for? It was totally evident. This is a bean and cheese burrito folks.  Pretty hard to mess that up if your beans are good.  My kids liked their beans just fine, no off taste there.  What happened to his food is hard to imagine, but it was inedible. Disgusted, he tossed it in the trash and tried a churro. They were jelly filled, which was unexpected but okay enough.  He actually didn't like it either and had a bowl of cereal. My 3 year old ate the rest of that churro with his beans, I gave up on my chimi less than 1/4 of the way through.  $50 for him to eat cereal for dinner pretty well solidified the fact that we will not be returning to Felipito's.",jlDXpZv8kuBpy-UEsp8YSw,1,0,1,bWxsRF8IW04SYmsW1smycg

Between the four of us we got a steak torta, chicken sopas, a ham cheese and egg burrito and a chicken taco and enchilada plate. Everything was really good, Expect the chicken in the taco. The chunks of chicken were very fatty and chewy. The sopas were great!! Best I've had. The beans were good and the rice seemed a little old and hard in some spots. And if you want rolled tacos just know they only come in beef. No chicken. That was a major bummer. 
Service was good. The guy at the register was very nice and helpful. It was very clean in there too. If you come try the sopas for sure!!",RNI2SJkPGW9L4Wm2YSxcMw,1,1,3,vsv-RFdub3jQN_Q8nkH2Zw

So I didn't wanna burst her bubble by telling her that this location was not that great. So I kept my mouth shut and ordered food as well. I figured it wouldn't be that bad.

The young gentleman at the register was nice and he had a lot of patience. I only say that because he was the only one working there that night. He was the cashier and the cook! after taking everyone's order he washed his hands and then he made the food. It got a little busy and our food took a while but it's understandable, he was by himself! I've been there.
