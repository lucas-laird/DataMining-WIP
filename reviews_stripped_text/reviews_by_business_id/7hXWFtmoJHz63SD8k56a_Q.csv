Another patron informed me that after I walked away they all did a round of shots that were put on my tab. If he was going to do that he could have told me and included me at least.

-Angelina's is back in the kitchen.  Not five star dining, but wayyyyyy better than average bar food.  The Angelina's guy that comes out to take your order is very helpful.

-I consider it a blue collar bar, but I'm a white collar guy, yet I make friends every time I go here.  I often feel out of place at blue collar bars but not at Putter's.

-Good atmosphere no matter the occasion.  Wether you want to grab food, get drinks, meet friends, have a date, Putter's is a go-to.

-I once ""slept"" with a girl in the women's bathroom while on a date here, got caught, and didn't get banned for life.  People just thought it was funny.",gV2m50NkIM-MKC9eRylHCA,0,0,5,OxlDZehLX1PwfzRdJYb22w

This morning, we wanted to take our 3 starving teenaged boys out for breakfast, which would normally cost about 50-75 bucks (they'll each eat a big platter of food, then get pancakes or french toast for sides)! 

We pulled up restaurant.com, and Putters came up as a new restaurant. We ordered a $25 gift certificate and used a code to get 80% off. The certificate cost $2, and breakfast ended up totaling us $22 after the coupon. But man all the food those boys consumed was worth it. 

The boys all ordered chicken fried steak and it was a large portion, crispy and flavorful. I had a skillet with made to order eggs, home fries, peppers, onions, cheese, and bacon or sausage. It was exellent. 

We were very surprised at how delicious the food ended up tasting. We hope they end up remaining on restaurant.com, as we'll quickly become regulars.",-HAHTQeOzHX5TCDb7qs9Yw,1,1,4,SgrQly9vb68hcAwoa9WDYg

2585316,2016-11-30,11,7hXWFtmoJHz63SD8k56a_Q,"Years ago, you could walk into almost any bar in Las Vegas, and find steel tip dart boards and players to throw against/with. Skip to today, there are less than a dozen bars. 

So, when I heard that Putters offered darts, I was skeptical - believing they were darts, soft tip electronic machines for those who don't know how to add or subtract. I joke ... there are some awesome throwers - especially with the size of the targets, when compared to steel tip bristle boards.

Anyway - nice Bar & Grill. Ample parking and one clean facility. Friendly bartenders with nice heavy pours with great prices. Dart boards are kept in decent condition. Separate throwing area with enough room for tables and seating for a blind draw or small tournament. 

As for the rest of the place - I really can't speak much other than it was clean and the clientele all seemed to be locals/regulars, from the conversations I could hear. Seems like a great local bar offering a little bit of something for everyone.",I2qJvA0tbGdZJ3XrwzwfzA,16,14,4,So2oIncO4kCbN4quFnZY1g

3060160,2017-08-17,0,7hXWFtmoJHz63SD8k56a_Q,"Last night my friend and I decided to stop by this bar for a quick bite. The evening started off with our server Yazmine, taking our drink order. I voiced my preference to draft beer and asked what Sam Adams seasonal was on draft. The server didn't know and went to ask to bartender, when she came back she said ""Yes we have the seasonal"" to which again, I had to ask what the name of the beer was and she still didn't know. In the end I ordered the regular Sam Adams and got it in the bottle *sigh*. At this point I have let this error go and did not say anything. Next, we ordered food; my friend got the chicken parm sub and I asked for the philly cheese steak with no onions or peppers and tomatoes on the side. When the food came, Yazmine asked if the order was correct and that I wanted everything on the side: bread, steak, cheese, tomatoes. I told her no, I just wanted it with no pepper or onions and tomatoes on the side. She proceeded to tell me that she repeated the order to me when she took it and this is what I wanted but she'll go and fix it for me. Later we also asked for waters which came after we were already done with our meal. Working in the food and beverage industry myself, I have never come across someone so incompetent. How does a server not know what beers are on draft? And if you were unsure of the accuracy of the order why not just double check? I mean, who would order a sandwich with everything on the side in the first place? Seeing as Yazmine had no other tables whatsoever, there is no excuse for the simple mistakes that were made. 
The food was delicious so kudos to the chefs! This is the only reason I am adding 2 stars to this review.",bresa1Zzju0HPUC1uxfg2w,0,0,2,gnX62lIx3J7dRn-FJ2Wf0w

3727954,2016-02-17,1,7hXWFtmoJHz63SD8k56a_Q,"I've been to this location several times since I get my car serviced right next door.  It's been a while.  I remember it being just your typical local bar restaurant with tables/booths.

They have since changed so you walk into what looks more like pure bare with a few tables but big open space, dart boards, pool table and the very first thing with only 3 people in the place was smoke hitting you full force. 

I dropped my car off at lunch and figured I would grab a bite, relax and just wait.  The food situation is weird.  The kitchen is one company but everything else is another... or I think that's how it worked.  Two different servers.  Two different tabs.  Food was decent pub food and pizza.

Kitchen service was prompt.  Bar service could have been better.  I know when it's slow and you are working and have a friend to chat with it might be hard to remember to check with your 3 customers and see if they need anything but a glance over the shoulder every minute or two isn't terribly hard.

Overall, it was pretty disappointing.  Lack of adequate ventilation and surprisingly high level of smoke for so few people meant sinus problems for me for days.  (Usually I'm OK with casinos and other smoking areas even though I'm a non-smoker...so it really was pretty bad.)",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,3,0,1,Eu8FG0IBBvHVFvz7WB5Mow

Now, I only stop by when I take one of the cars in for servicing next door at Ted Wien auto service, which was the case during my most recent visit.

It's a nice place to hang out and have a few drinks while you kill time.  There are video poker machines on the bar, but since I don't gamble I hung out at one of the tables near the bar and surfed the web on my iPad.

The bartenders were very friendly and bored.....they'd talk to a rock if they could, so you should have some nice company too.

Overall, it's a pretty cool neighborhood bar.  They serve food, but I wasn't hungry the day I was there, so no food this trip.

So I swaggered on up to the bar and ordered a pint of Amber. The bar tender was right there and took my order right away. He showed me the same respect as he did to all of the obvious regulars which he knew all by name. The other server there was friendly too. She just sort of came up to me and asked how I was doing. She wasn't even there to take my order. Just being friendly.

A few sips into my beer I looked up to see what else was on tap and one in particular caught my eye. A seasonal brew from Shocktop called Shockolate Wheat. Interesting. I started talking about it with a friend over the phone. I told him I was at a PT's. My bad. This was most certainly a Putters and I felt bad about calling it by the wrong name. Anyhow, as I neared the end of my beer the bar tender came over amd asked if I wanted another. Then he mentioned the Shocktop and how I had been eyeing it. I was intrigued but not ready to try a full pint. So he poured me a sample. A lot of bars don't do that so I was pleased that he did. I was tempted to go for another round but by this time my pizza was ready. So I settled up at $4 for the Amber and I was on my way.

4484587,2010-12-18,0,7hXWFtmoJHz63SD8k56a_Q,"I read the few previous reviews for Putter's, so my expectations weren't high.  Our Friday Night Fearless Foursome drove there in the rain.  Instead of choosing to feel like royalty in the totally empty dining room, we opted to sit at one of the high tables in the bar area.  It wasn't crowded, and no one was eating, so my expectations for the food dropped a few notches lower.

Surprisingly, everything was very good.  Not fabulous, but there was nothing to complain about (after Sid, our waiter, swapped out our rocking table for a more stable one).  I had a glass of Piesporter Riesling, a good-sized pour that ended up costing only four bucks.  My husband had a Newcastle on tap.

Our quesadilla appetizer was big enough for the four of us to share.  My friend's club sandwich had very moist turkey.  I had the open-faced Monterrey Chicken sandwich, but instead of the sourdough, I ordered it on a French roll.  The bread was like all the other bread in Vegas - it sucked.  Well, that's harsh.  I guess it was okay unless you're not Vegas born and bred.  But the filling was very good, with a moist chicken breast, lots of avocado, tomato, cheese and onion.  Sandwiches come with fries, potato salad or cole slaw.  My friend had the fries, which were decent, and I had the cole slaw, and it was very good.  My husband had a bowl of chili - cheap, but everything but the chili is extra - a dollar for the bowl size, a dollar for cheese, and seventy-five cents for chopped onions.  Still cheap.  The last entree was the chicken fried steak dinner, and our friend said it was tasty.

All in all, our dinner at Putter's way exceeded our expectations.  I wouldn't give it a rave or travel very far for it, but if you're in the neighborhood and looking for some decent bar food, it satisfies,  it's reasonable, and it's also on restaurant.com.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,0,3,ChaJHPVjJtqyj-5dJFTwQw

They're within walking distance from my home, and whenever my wife and I go there, we walk.
They renovated the place a number of years ago, and the new look is much less dive-like than it used to be. 
Their breakfast is better than average, and very inexpensive
They have skillet breakfast and all other breakfast staples.
I like their lunches because they are large portions. The first time I ate lunch there, I ordered the 5 lb burger. It was one of the rare times that I needed a doggy-bag.
Their only downfall is that they don't have a complete wall separating the restaurant from the bar, so at times, you can smell the cigarette smoke, but if you eat there really early or really late, the smoke isn't an issue.
