If you are familiar with Chipotle, then you understand the set-up here: basically, a grown-up cafeteria where you pick the fillings for your burrito or tacos and they build it for you.  There's usually a high turn-over so things stay fresh.  Also, expect large portions at affordable prices.

I hadn't been to Qdoba in a while and couldn't remember why.  After a recent visit back, it all came back to me.

The food was pretty boring.

Not a lot of flavor- not from the rice, the beans, the salsas.  Not bad, just not exciting to eat.

I think I'm going to stick to Zaba's.

Bonus points for coupons, a frequent diner program, a clean store, and friendly employees.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,0,0,3,rPgDrONGcXcAfgZMs8ybrw

I had the 3 tacos, one chicken/steak/grilled pork/. The grilled pork, wasn't too great, but the steak and chicken were, they tasted fresh, and juicy, even 30 min before closing time.",3EKm38imhyCk3xcVVQbdZg,0,0,4,oYcziCRE-nTnWN7fW9HQiA
1555865,2011-10-31,0,Ufa7MJ3yDDIMFkYctnhT8Q,"Clean fast food restaurant but the food was horrible tasting and looking. The containers that held the food wasn't covered. So the variety of meat, beans and other toppings looked as if it hasn't been refilled, reheated, or at least stirred before we reached the counters.

I ordered three grilled chicken tacos and the tortillas were cold. Only had a nibble of chicken on the tacos so it would pretty much be a veggie taco lol.

Staff was ok, restaurant was very cool but I've definitely experienced better.",WX1k1QLhG6_kmbK-R2YQiQ,0,0,2,0f3jFNREPoanDsEazf78bA

We stopped by and got there, at the doors, at 9:50 (they close at 10:00pm), and the doors were locked, OPEN sign turned off, cleaning up. I knocked, and the lady signaled that they were closed! What?! I was like ""10!"" and put up all 10 fingers at her, and she just kept looking at me and shaking her head... So apparently, the managers and/or employees here care more about going home on time than the customers or keeping a job. Very short sighted. If they don't get customers, store closes, people lose jobs. They lost out on a nice sized check, and I can say with management like that, we're not going to support that business, and our money is going elsewhere. I suggest you do the same.",1NRA_FMPNhCdsG-cFi-yaw,0,0,1,Iv2Yb8DTOz3K8-Gc0ByduQ

Can't say anything amazing or awful, but there's nothing wrong with an A-OK ""fast"" food option that can also be healthy.",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,0,0,3,cp3U0J1To4nQCuBTAX3shQ
