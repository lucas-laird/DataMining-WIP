1040,2010-08-15,1,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Glazier's is pretty middle of the road for me. Let me start off by saying that the store has a very strong, strange odor that has lingered since they first opened (my husband says its tolerable, I find it hard to bear). The layout is nice and the store looks impressive compared to most regular grocery stores (Smiths, Vons, etc). They have a large produce selection at very affordable prices. Lots of exotic fruit, vegetables, and peppers that cannot be found at conventional grocers. However, their herbs and most greens are less than fresh and their selection of organic produce is lacking (and way too expensive when compared to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or even Vons). They have a great selection of ready made food, but few healthy options. Pizza, ice cream, sushi, pasta salads, pasta entrees, vegetable and starch sides, etc. Some of what I've tried has been good, including salmon stuffed with spinach and pesto, green beans almondine, mixed vegetable rice, broccoli with peppers, etc. They also have a nice looking coffee and tea bar and a good selection of gourmet bread (La Brea Bakery olive bread, jalapeno cheddar, pain rustic, organic whole grain, etc). They have a huge bakery with donuts, pastries, pies and cakes at shockingly low prices, but nothing even remotely health conscious. Salad bar is run of the mill and cant hold a candle to Whole Foods, but again the prices here are incredibly reasonable. They do have an organic/natural food section but they do not have organic eggs, meat, etc. 
I could not do my regular grocery shopping here, but this place is great for specialty items and anyone shopping on a budget. It is far better than a Walmart or Smart and Final and I like the fact that it's family owned. Their produce selection is worth a trip alone. I also find myself coming here when I get home late and don't want to cook- their ready made and pre-packaged food is available 'till they close at midnight. I wish they'd offer reusable bags, a discount card, and a juice bar among their ready made food stations. I also wish they'd refresh their magazines- I feel like I am in the twilight zone when I stand in line and see covers from weeks ago.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,2,0,3,rUoMvoXxdqTCxCmIL2CrpQ

20656,2014-03-17,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"I don't see what all the hype is over this store. I have visited twice thinking I should give it a second chance but this trip was as bad as the first. This store is really dark, makes me wonder what they don't want you to see. The classical music playing throughout the place is cheesy. The produce section that everyone raves about is just ok. The Organic area is small and the regular section was mostly picked over and empty. I actually put the produce I had selected back and will just head to Whole Foods tomorrow after work. The butchers didn't seem friendly and couldn't even make eye contact with me. Many of the items I looked at are priced just as high as other markets. Self checkouts are tacky and the lady running it seemed to think she was better than the job she was working. 

The one thing that really bothered me was the way the employees were starring at the black couple checking out, like they were trying to steal. They were so caught up in it that they didn't even see the rest of us customers watching them. Sad really. 

I will not shop here ever again, they don't deserve my money or the lame ""best of las vegas"" rating they plaster all over the front of the joint.",Vdlbnz9pCnVQTX_fpnOwSg,5,0,1,4aOPZ8-Z5QPvAjdt-HiYbQ
20789,2010-09-30,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Though not close to me, I always prefer to shop at Glazier's when I'm nearby. I have to thank Yelp for this since I wouldn't have known otherwise.

Glazier's is by far the cleanest grocery store I've seen. It has a nice selection of products and brands not always seen in most other stores. Many unique and interesting products, I even found some that I had considered ordering online since I couldn't find them elsewhere. They also have their own line of products which is pretty good. As others have said, they have a little of everything, and then a couple more you didn't know about and would like to try.

Their bakery section has some excellent pastries and breads, always fresh.
They even have sugar free pastries and treats.

Prices are about average, similar to what you'd pay at Smith's. They do have some excellent weekly deals though, for example if you buy 4lbs of pork chops you get soft drinks, mustard, buns etc for free..

Staff has always been polite and friendly.

Glazier's is the only grocery store (along with Trader Joe's) where I decided to buy something new that looked interesting/tasty and wasn't disappointed. 

If you happen to live near Glazier's there's no reason why you should shop elsewhere. Clean, friendly and not overpriced, with a variety of rare, interesting and fresh products.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,3,2,5,MoOmE8l5XRKyG160L1CGNA

My 1 star rating is for the inappropriate service I had from the checker. I have also found out they are non-union (no wonder their service is sub-par). I spoke to a manager who said that he was surprised that I got bad service because of all the compliments they get from others... He only apologized after I asked him why he wasn't sorry that I had a bad experience. There are too many grocery stores in the area to be bothered by bad service.,1prJgTrk4kH85h6mvDTL3A,0,0,1,1PXZmj441PFuewcJRghqjA

112116,2014-04-23,1,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"While I have been shopping with them for years, I recently have made the decision to no longer shop at Glaziers. Selection is alright, and while they do get some odd imported items here and there, Its not much to write home about. Produce selection can be hit and miss as other reviewers have stated, and the butcher is no better than any other supermarket (I would much rather go to The Butcher Block down the road). Pricing on items is also pretty standard some deals and some ripoffs. 

However, the one thing that has really made me decide to shop elsewhere is the ""Shopping Gestapo"" they keep posted at the front of the store. While some may refer to them as ""Greeters"" I find they do very little greeting at all and mostly just stand at the front looking intimidating, clearly there as loss prevention. Putting large orange stickers that read ""paid"" on any non bagged items so the Gestapo can verify that the item was indeed paid for.
Furthermore, they force you to leave any backpacks with them, now I ride a motorcycle and as such use a backpack to carry my items back home. I understand that for them allowing me too keep it on carries some risk but with cameras watching the isles and the relative difficulty to stash something in a bag on your back compared to say... a purse. I feel all these things are a bit much and it all shows of poor respect for your customers, as well as detracts from the shopping experience.

Granted, I can somewhat see why they may have started to enforce such a rule with there being a high school sort of near by, but this too is rather ageist don't you think? I know I look pretty young despite being an adult, but I'm holding a motorcycle helmet, I'm wearing protective gear. Would a teenager looking to shoplift have these things? Whats more, they say nothing about my helmet, one could hide something in there so much faster, while being much less assuming.

Anyway this is just my experience and will be taking my business elsewhere.",yj7VvHHI4E03dLMKkYgSvw,7,1,1,wtOREI5Jv7lOiKVPHvu7sQ

Thank you so much for hating retirement to the point of opening up the best grocery store in Las Vegas.  And a big thank you for when building said store that you were nice enought to build it less than two miles away from my house - that was very thoughtful of you!  Thank you also Mrs. G for not keeping your amazing recipies a secret and sharing the deliciousness with us!  Thank you for having friendly, helpful employees. You have my loyalty forever.

Warmest Regards,

234123,2016-11-29,1,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"For Thanksgiving we were flying in family and had planned a very special few days.  One of the highlights was to be the Turkey Day meal.  I order 2 pre-prepared meals 1. Butterball Turkey and 1. Prime Rib Roast.  What a total joke, the quality and preparation were not what you would expect for a market with Glazier's reputation.

The meats, the turkey was not nearly cooked enough, they say you need to heat for 1.5 to 2 hours, we cooked it for 3+ hours and it was still somewhat under cooked.  The prime rib, was to need 30 mins.  The meat was bloody rare, we had to cook this for 90+ mins. to get it to medium.  Neither meat was seasoned very well, nor were the side dishes.  Thankfully, there was a Smith's nearby and we were able to get what was needed to make the meal flavorful.

The sides were very disappointing and in some cases skimped.  Since we ordered 2 meals were got six sides.  The yams were barely cooked and contained huge non-mashed chunks of uncooked yam.  The stuffing was ok, but only one container, not nearly enough for the number of people the dinner claims to serve.  The green beans, they must be very cheap because the gave us a lot of green beans and they had zero flavor.  The mashed potatoes were ok as was the corn.  The rolls were great but then they were a packaged brand.

2 apple pies were provided and were really very poor quality flavor, texture and such.

All in all this was something I would have expected from a really bad restaurant.  I sent a note through their website, but big surprise, I got no response so I chose to let others know what not to do with their hard earned money.

We live in 2 different cities and all our food prep utensils were in Scottsdale.  We thought this would be a great alternative.  WRONG!",ll2UxyM3nfL4DOiR5cf6ew,3,0,1,bDfJJRjXkdNwkK0F2TnMkg

Of course you don't learn until you get to the checkstand that this does not include meat, dairy, etc. Of course I fell $20 short of the $150 required so no free turkey for me.

My daughter likes to hold a couple of balloons while we walk around the store and then we put them back when we are finished with our shopping. Today though when we were getting ready to leave my fiancé was getting the balloons from my daughter when an older man in a blue suit came up and ripped them out of my daughters hand. When my fiancé says I will put those back he just rudely replies no they are already messed up and will take over an hour to fix and then just walks away. Unfortunately I did not see this happen. So instead of getting more items we went to pay for what we had and when I told the cashier about the rude employee she said that he is the owner. Well any owner who can treat customers let alone a child like that really doesn't care about the people that keep him in business.

The prices here were fair, and I would say for the quality of the produce and meat products possibly on the lower end.  I really like that they have such a large hot food counter, it's like having 3 mini-restaurants inside the market.  I also like that at their deli counter, you can put in your order and come back and get it when you're done shopping so you don't have to stand around waiting.  I also got some of their shrimp and cooked them for dinner last night, and I'm really happy to say tat they were well cleaned and did not taste fishy or bad, which can happen all to often here in Vegas.

To put it succinctly, I'm really happy that Glazier's is now my local market.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,0,1,4,dVUTWBrQYSU7VFs0N5dnGQ
562245,2013-09-08,2,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"First thing is first, I only write a review if the service or the food was so bad that I 1. left the business fuming. 2. IT'S a VALID CONCERN

Yesterday was one of those days, I was fuming with Glazier's market!
Here's what happened:
I ordered a baby shower cake 2 days in advance. I knew there would be a problem...the person taking the order had no clue how to take it. I thought, I will call to be sure but I didn't. I paid, I left a phone number, gave the person my order, it's a half vanilla sheet cake, that says ""congrats...""in hot pink with gerber lillies. Main thing I paid, I gave them time, and easy instruction.

Day of the shower (two hours before), go in and there is NO CAKE. They never called, the asked me if I had a copy of what looked like an official form. I had no clue what they were talking about, I had a receipt with a bright orange sticker that said PAID. I guess this was not enough. 

Therefore, the cake for some reason, I never knew why was never made. So I picked one from the cold case (who by the way the person who took my order said, they often stay in there for up to 2 weeks because they forget to take them out...but nonetheless the young man said, ""they are still really good"") so now, I  pick a blue one out of the cold case...it has some pink in it (a shower for a GIRL)....and I am fuming! Another person comes out with 4 small packages, I thought they were happy meal toys and asked me if I wanted one. 'WTH are they?' I ask. These people don't talk. As a consumer, I have NO CLUE what is happening in this business transaction. Oh, well thank you....they are tiny baby shoes that can top the cake....that do not match, that look like they are from 1907. Thank you, thank you very much. My last comments are WHO IS THE MANAGER? The mute attendant (someone with a grey bob hair cut) says of course by pointing was the person who offered me the Happy Meal toys without telling me what they were but by just handing out 4 plastic whatevers...


I take the cake and go fuming out assuring them I WILL CALL MONDAY WHEN I HAVE TIME. 

Alas, I take the stupid mismatched cake (that could be two weeks old) to the car. I need to buy soft drink, wine (yes, wine!) and a $50 gift card for the party and don't want to take the cake while shopping. Heavens, hey may think I am stealing it even though I have official documentation.

I get 6 bottles of wine...I notice the 9.95...they are all 5 something...they have no idea where the gift cards are, They have no idea why the sales price isn't coming up. They are slow and confused. My blood is boiling, my heart is racing, I'm about to sweat and literally my always happy face has melted into a frown. 
I can't take it...I am done and I leave, bursting out the door.

Let me say not only did these people make me late for a baby shower I was hosting, they wasted MY TIME. All of the occurrences could have been avoided by 1. Training the kid who took my order properly 2. Called me when they had a question about my order 3. Spoke to me about why the order did not get made instead of just staring at me like I had a 3rd eye and I didn't have the right to be angry...especially when I had to  look the case alone looking for a similar cake flavor like the one I ordered. And no they didn't have it so I had to pick something else! 

Very disappointing since I just bought a new home by this place. Admittedly Vegas doesn't have much to offer in the way of fresh produce and a store that has decent pricing for the good quality such as Whole Foods. They also have a salad bar there which is great and that I ate from when I ordered my cake (THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME THERE). As well as I bought a scoop of gelatto (that was ok.....but I ate it). I am a family person who does not need reasonable pricing - that they do seem to have. In addition, I need time a feature many families can lack. I am mad that they wasted mine and didn't even flinch or respond or take ownership of THEIR FAULT.

I assure you people will continue to go there because they have some nice features to their store but I think it'll be the last they see of me.

Monday mornings, I am bestowed at my front door with fresh milk, a  produce box, and meats that is delivered by Winder Farms. THOSE PEOPLE ARE FANTASTIC and for this I AM LOYAL. Still. I do shopping when I need things but this WILL NOT be the place to do it....


You lost a fine customer Glaziers, you really did. You need more management and process training, communication skills and people who know how to WOW their customers not make them fume.

I wanted to try the angus beef rib eye steaks that were advertised over Labor Day weekend. The ones in the butcher case were very thin so we asked the butcher if we could get some with a thicker cut. We cooked them at home and they were so tough!  REALLY tough!  So glad we didn't stock up on them.,N6L5qZ-UUUfdD4MbcJ_zcQ,0,0,4,vsXlok7owiQjbJJF3FSxgQ

Twice in the last month or so: First time, i was being followed by an employee. At first I just thought we were going the same way, but then, after a few minutes I realized every time I stopped, they stopped. Every aisle I went down, they went down. I thought is was odd. Second time, an employee cut me off in the wine section, gets on a radio to another asking ""this one?"" while pointing at me, then walks past me slowly while glaring and looking into my cart.

599810,2013-12-25,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Very decent grocery market in southwest Vegas.  The store is a normal grocer with a lot of individual items not found at the larger chain stores.  Glaziers is not a chain store.  I've found a lot of East Coast based items here rarely found on the West Coast.  The store has an area for quick eats for take out, but does have a seating area for eating.  The deli area is impressive, promoting mostly Boars Head products.  There is an area at the end of the deli that packages pre-made meals and sides.  They do have an organic section, not any larger than most normal grocery stores.  They do have an aisle of Hawaiian goods also.

As another reviewer expressed, this is not a market like Whole Foods.  It's a normal grocery store with some perks.  There's only one in Vegas, if I lived closer I'd probably go more.  It is worth checking out.",tTdGu5W4DhYzrIAWeulHQg,1,0,4,TFBNeS3r1ZXUB8M1nHHniA

I've never had a steak dinner served to me at the neighborhood grocery and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. The atmosphere was commendable with the grand piano playing in the dining area and the steak was perfectly grilled how I ordered it. I upgraded from the New York strip to the bone-in porterhouse cooked medium. It was nicely sized and not over seasoned. Delicious! The steak comes with two sides and is brought to you with such stout service that it's easy to forget that you're at the grocery. I hope Glaziers keeps doing this excellent Friday night family event and it becomes a locals' tradition!,ql0mzE-9YVs42QIKgcemuw,0,0,4,r4jG613xCL4ispS14rEBnA

They carry items from the Eastern part of the US. (Drakes, Wise,...) The international food isle is better than Albertsons, Vons, Smiths. They have stuff that I usually pick up in San Diego, nice!  I don't usually go into this much detail, but this is warranted. Ok, let's go.
1. Produce: always fresh n good price

2. Mrs. G's Salad bar: fresh! The potato salad is the only potato salad I will buy in a grocery store.

3: Meat Dept: Huge selection! Always fresh and the carne asada is $2:00 cheaper than Albertsons and tastes better!

 4: Employees are always nice. There is always someone to greet you at the door.

5: Nice soda selection

6: Overall, clean, nice selection of East Coast items (for Vegas)

I pretty much split my grocery budget between Glazier's and Albertsons. Wal-Mart is only good for canned goods and tortillas.",rhH1Cqta8lb3n-t0fTRm5w,0,0,4,_uxhpRF-nxB2jSI53RYZ5g

There were about 6 people working behind the counter.  After a few minutes of being ignored someone finally came over and asked me what I wanted.  Not a ""good morning"" or ""welcome"" which goes a long way to customer satisfaction but ""do you need some help?""  Remember, it is 8:30 am and there can't be more than 5 customers in the entire store.  After previously looking at their packaged porterhouse steaks which were less and an inch think I asked the man behind the counter if I could get 2 porterhouse steaks cut an inch and a half thick.  He looked at me with somewhat of a bothered look and said yes but he could not charge me the sale price of $6.98/lb.  I asked what he would charge me and he said $9.98/lb.  

The two steaks would have probably been 3 lbs. total so he wanted to charge me $9.00 just to cut two steaks.  Isn't the sole job of a butcher to cut meat?  I guess not at Glazier's.  And isn't the job of any business to make their customers as happy and satisfied as possible?  I guess not at Glazier's.

They serve Boars Head cold cuts. These are the ONLY cold cuts to mess with...you will never buy slimy generic meats ever again. Coming from NY I appreciate any store that carries those fine products. The butcher has tons of prepared/marinated/no work for you meats to choose from, including shish kabobs that look awesome. 

The salad bar is fresh and packed with yummy toppings if you're looking to scarf something down either there in the cafe or at home in front of the TV. I can't even talk about the food court strip in the front of the store...SO wonderful, even if you have a basket of food that you fully intend to cook that night, something there will suck you in. Love the paninis. 

The aisles are wide and they have a great selection of brands, lots that you can't find normally out here. A good example is Ronzoni pasta, a back east fave. 

The staff is super friendly, almost to a fault, since you've now purchased so much food you just want to check out and speed home to eat it all. No rewards program yet though, what's up with that? Oh and by now if you've walked all around the store you've noticed the odd music, it makes me laugh. I've figured out that they play very dramatic instrumental versions of movie music, sometimes I feel like  breaking into interpretive dance. A bit overkill. 

Overall a great shopping experience. I'm so glad it's near my house!",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,1,1,4,JysGv3ja2wpvH9EXt-MQ5w

It's great that Glazier's is a mom-and-pop operation and that Mr. and Mrs. G. are hands-on and accessible. I appreciate their efforts to bring in many regional products and brands from the East Coast and Midwest to help those homesick transplants. They offer a large variety of foodstuffs for everyone, whether you cook from scratch or grab the fresh ready-made grub. The deli is very comprehensive and generally reliable with the Boar's Head line.

However, shopping there today requires much more effort. Produce is hit or miss with quality and availability. I've seen grapefruit and potatoes with mold. There are many expired items on the shelves in various departments (condiments and dairy being the worst). And not just recently expired--months ago expired. You really have to take the time to scrutinize everything you purchase. Some suction seal lids are popped up on jars, even though the plastic wrap is still intact.

I still have to shop here because there are products that I can't get elsewhere, but now it's a bigger chore to ensure that I don't bring home any duds.",MEhBmoVFiiv9LZVq5NTMGQ,6,0,3,OvOzUKeQBiUvdw6lUj4pyQ

As we continued walking, we noticed large party platters varied from like $29.99 up to about $54.99. They had pasta salads, fruits, veggies, meats and wings. The prices are definitely reasonable.

1057546,2013-05-07,1,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Glazier's addresses one of my big concerns with grocery stores in the Valley: variety. I loathe having only a few options when I shop. I know studies show that many people function better with limited choices. But I am not one of those people. I function better with MANY choices and Glazier's just gets that part of me. I like seeing 20 different bar-be-que sauce varieties on the shelf. It lets people make actual decisions about what products they want to bring into their home. Contrast that with the 8 varieties provided at many of the local chains around town (I'm talking to you Smith's and Vons). 

I avoided purchasing non-perishables, but there were tremendous options in every area of the store. And I always like seeing BUY ONE GET ONE offers around a store. I don't care if they are just trying to reel me in. Add to the BOGO offers the FREE tortilla chips with every $25 purchase. Winning! Frugal shoppers like me get excited about deals like that. 

Overall their prices were a bit high, but any specialty store will have to increase the price point a bit. So that did not bother me. I liked the layout of the store and the general organization. And being family owned matters to me. It should matter to everyone. If I am on that side of town, I would rather give my money to a professional family owned company than some of my other choices. 

I didn't see many perishable organic options, but doesn't seem to be what Glazier's is about. They are serving up variety and East Coast product options in a busy area of town.  Is Glazier's leading the way toward more diverse, well-organized, thoughtfully stocked, locally owned, neighborhood markets? I can only hope so.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,2,2,4,zGgUMkD8smohQH4EErvVXQ

I had purchased some fresh perch for dinner that looked very good when in the store.  Unfortunately I had to throw it out when I got home as it was spoiled and also had a slight smell of highly diluted bleach (an old butchers trick to mask off-odors).. . . .

I've hit Glazier's at least 10 times since they opened.  My basic recommendation  is when you walk into the store, stay to your left - the bakery, the deli and the seafood/meat sections are AWESOME .  

The deli meats are a little on the high side ...WORTH IT !

The seafood selection - great !  few weeks ago got 21-25 Shrimp for $4/pound -- GREAT ! 

I picked up lobsters ( for bisque ) and a prime rib roast for Christmas dinner - PERFECT !

Donuts ...60 cents each - NICE 

They make their own sausage - about 6-7 types to try - I'VE TRIED THEM ALL !

If you're already working and the register was opened what is the difficult part of counting $8. I absolutely dislike lazy employees. She did everything in her power to get rid of me as soon as possible.

So I go over to Wanda and ask for the same thing. Thankfully she took the time to count but sighed about 3 times in the process. I didn't ask you ladies to climb a mountain...

I grocery shop a little different now-a-days since it is just me, so I am not buying groceries for other people and buy food that I do not eat. What got me going in this store were the little assorted Italian cookies in the bakery cases that you can choose and put in white bags. It brought me back to my visits of Saint Louis 'The Hill' , which is an Italian area and buying these little gems from the bakery. Except at Glazier's I can pick and choose which ones on my own, rather than saying ""One handful"" and point at the little pistachio cookies. 

The cheese department does lack in refinement but it has your basics of non-imported brie and camembert but I have yet to find triple Crème Brie here. Occasionally, I do pick up truffled pate which is in the cheese case so that kind of makes up for the lack of cheese refinement. There is an extensive deli selection, prepared foods, generic sushi bar, pizza, etc . You can also buy some gelato and I assume eat it while you shop. I have never done that but I think that may be something I will try soon, it sounds like fun! 

Also, I can never leave without buying a bottle or two of booze. They are always giving samples to try and not just wine. I have sampled and bought HUG an Italian sparkling wine and Wild Tonic Kombucha. They tend to have great sales on wine which is excellent for single woman shopping. There have been times that I came home with bottles of Coppola wine because the prices were phenomenally lower than other markets or liquor stores. Please do not ask me about the beer selections because I do not do beer, so you will have to check it out yourself.

It is a smaller grocery store but it is bigger than Trader Joes, so if you are looking for something 'specific' you many not find it here but for basics of what I need (Pate and liquor) this is my spot... unless they open up a TJ's in my hood. ;)",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,10,7,4,eD4B0xHtWEz2vW4_a7yPyg

I discovered this grocery store when I lived near Jones and Robindale.  There are no ""healthy"" grocery stores in the area that carry a ton of organic items, except Whole Foods which is always pricey and inconveniently located at Town Square, so it's always crowded with long lines, etc.  When I found Glaziers I was excited to find Hawaiian food + a ton of organic and international items.  This grocery store is well-rounded, they have amazing customer service, and their pricing is so great!  I can usually buy a full week's groceries for about $100 which is amazing.  When I was shopping at other competing grocery stores in the area (Smiths, Albertsons, etc), my grocery bill was usually around $150 per week.

They have a fresh bakery and an awesome boars head deli counter as well.  You can order your deli meat through their app or on the computer system in front of the counter.  It's somewhat more convenient but it seems since they added that system of ordering the process actually takes longer than just asking the employee to make what you are requesting.  Not sure if it solved problems of time, but it definitely makes them more efficient as they will only make what is printed on the ticket.  No more errors...so that's good.

Their produce is always super fresh and if you ask an employee in the produce area for anything, they know the entire store and can assist you with any question or concern.  They are super helpful.  

You don't need a membership card or anything like that to shop at Glaziers.  If it's on sale, it's on sale.  The only thing I advise is that if you live in the area, check your mail.  Sometimes their mailers have great coupons and additional discounts to offer.",Te7_l78PIzdfiu9ki3Jrbg,8,2,5,4ZANL-C66ieum7dAUqIGyg

Glaziers has that neighborhood market feel, which I absolutely love!  However, the produce department has become basically the worst.  I dislike Vons and Albertsons and Smiths, yet there's no competition when it comes to fresh fruit.  Finding a somewhat ripe Avacado at Glaziers is IMPOSSIBLE.  Fresh raspberries, no ma'am.  Many times there's just completely out of basic things.  No cilantro, no basil, etc.   I hope they get this fixed as it sucks that I no longer go there.

I still believe the store is mostly overpriced. So when I shop, I stick to the outside perimeter of the store. I hit the fresh fruits, fresh salad bar, deli department, meat department, and dairy department. I pretty much skip the isles. 

They have the most amazing deli. Honestly, I go every Sunday now just to get their egg salad, cranberry chicken salad, and California tuna salad. It goes great with their fresh Hawaiian loaf of bread. I make these for lunches during the week! The other part of the deli has a great selection of deli meats. I like that I can place my order from a kiosk, then shop while it is being prepared to my thickness specifications on eat meat. They even text me when my order is ready. No more waiting at the deli counter for my lunch meats! When you have so little time, these things make a huge difference.

The meat department always has cool items, like stuffed crabmeat in crab shells and stuffed clams in clamshells. The last time I was there they had fresh frog legs. Really... who eats that? I like that there is something for everyone though.

This is where we should have said Nevermind. I have no problem with people using recipe books but I do have a problem when they don't know simple measurements. She takes an 18oz cup and proceeds to pick at the ice. She looked like she really feared the ice bucket. She finally gets a scoop of ice and then grabs a gallon of milk. She poured 17oz of milk in the cup! That's when I flipped and canceled the order. We ordered coffee, not iced milks. When I cancelled and explained that was too much milk she looked all bewildered like an abused teen in a Lifetime movie.

1527054,2012-08-18,2,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"When I found this store almost 3 years ago, this grocery store would have gotten well over 5 stars. in 2010, this WAS the grocery store of Las Vegas to check out due to the friendliness and quality items. The store is HUGE!

The chicken breasts are still the cheapest in town, the ground beef seems to be of good quality (no pink slime detected), and the produce seems to have good deals if you search through enough. Aisles and bathroom are always clean. The New York and Chicago products are well stocked.

In 2011, I even spent over $1000.00 in one shopping trip to pay for the high quality food at my own wedding. Glazier's used to be that great of a store.

Over the years, Glazier's has become the MOST EXPENSIVE grocery store in Vegas. I have personally shopped at Glazier's, and went to Whole Foods to find an ORGANIC version cheaper than what Glazier's offers at non-organic.

Prices are not the only thing that has changed.

 When walking in, a bouncer at the Dance Club-type greets you at the door. Immediately, you are to feel as though you are being watched. 

London Broil was on sale for $2.98/lb. I wanted it cut in half - so they charged me last week's price ($5.99/lb!) I did not even notice it until I got to the register, where I found it is ""new store policy"" if you make the butcher do anything other than hand you a piece of meat. Hope it worked out for them, since at the register I gave it back.

One other no-no here... I wanted to bag my own groceries.

I worked in a grocery store as a kid. I am well trained to keep perishables together, produce together, etc.  I've been bagging groceries for almost 25 years! I'm told by the cashier it is ""a safety hazard"" if I bag my own groceries. This is a new one to me. Never in my life I have been told I could hurt myself from bagging my own groceries. If it was a ""safety hazard"", would Fresh & Easy be out of business by now? Surely the Health Dept would have shut down Winco and Food 4 Less as well. I don't see people in these grocery stores on the ground, writhing in pain from bagging their own food. 

One other tidbit I noticed... sometimes I shop at 10pm. The donuts used to be 
25¢ each after 7pm. Not anymore. Five minutes before closing you pay the same as if they were just made. There is no law that says they have to mark it down... but just saying... one less reason I go there.
 
Naturally, since I did not get to bag my own groceries, I get home to find 3 items in the same bag... a cucumber, chicken breast, and dish soap. 

This was a good store. I drove 10 miles each way to visit. However, ""Mr G"" has over-extended himself with petty policies and procedures. He has squeezed people like ourselves from shopping there on a regular basis. Instead of Glazier's I would recommend Sunflower market (soon to be Sprouts). 

Glazier's, I will still shop with you 2 to 3 times a year when I get cravings for New York stuff. Otherwise, I have found other places to go.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,18,4,2,SIv2dF6kvjSa2QbvsOrkpw

I was intrigued but we didn't have time to stop. We mentally made a note to try it out sometime.  After breakfast at Cracked Egg, we made our way to that shopping center. 

I'd say we do about 85% of our grocery shopping at Fresh and Easy because of the prices but the selection isn't great. The other 15% is usually Smith's or Albertson's. Sometimes they have good sales but it's kind of hit or miss. The selection is decent.  I enjoy Whole Foods but the prices are usually too high and it's a bit out of the way for us. 

As a previous reviewer mentioned, ""Glazier's is Costco, Mariana's, Lee's, Whole Foods, and International Marketplace all rolled into one.""  Before I read that, I thought, ""Fresh and Easy and Whole Foods rolled into one.""

I LOVED the selection and the prices were decent. Some items were excellent, some I expected to be a little high (organic brands like Amy's).

The reason why I like Glazier's is because they have some really good deals and they do have a lot of variety that you can't find at Vons, Smith's or Albertson's. They have a Hawaiian section with Zippy's frozen chili and Portugee Sausage ;]

They have weekly specials and often rotate sales on produce. I've seen broccoli and cauliflower being sold for 98 cents each. And similiarly priced Roma Tomatos by the pound. They don't neccesarily have the best produce ALL the time but if you go every so often they have some really great deals. I've seen avocados the size of my hand for 98 cents each and I've also seen them super tiny for $1.98.

4. A select group of friends.

Thank God, because the first two on this list were something I grew to love while in Phoenix/Scottsdale.

For those that don't know...AJ's is a local high end chain in the Phoenix area (think Whole Foods but smaller and for the nose up crowd like myself)...and Sprouts is similar to Trader Joe's but the stores are much larger.

Ok, back to Glazier's.

As soon as you stroll in, you are greeted to a very pristine sales floor. Everything looks immaculate! The produce section is perfect, the prices are competitive, and the selection is great! 

The hot deli section has everything from knishes, to pizzas, crab cakes, and even Cincy-style chili. Boom.

The meat section...to die for. 

Everything else is laid out just like any other grocery store, but the rest is still just as clean, and perfect as the entrance.

I am so glad this store is close to my house. There is a location in Henderson if you live out there.

Well Glazier's is definitely a step up from Albertson's, Von's, and Smith's. There inventory, and variety of products is huge. You will find many items that can't be found elsewhere in Las Vegas.  Much cleaner, brighter, inviting, and great prices.

However, they are smack dab in the middle of Trader Joes, and Whole Foods. A step up from Trader Joe's, but missing the boat when compared to whole foods.

Glaziers is a large regular supermarket that has lots of different things, so I come here for certain specific items not found elsewhere. I will eat at there food court if I happen to be hungry when there. But wouldnt make a special trip there to eat. I prefer the food court at whole foods by leaps and bounds. Glazier's is Dunkin Donuts, and Whole Foods is Starbucks basically.

If you are big meat eater, or like a large variety of meats and seafood... Glazier's has a a great meat and seafood selection.

The prices are great and they have a fairly large selection of gluten free items. I usually have to head out to a few out of the way places when I'm in town to stock up on some goods. At Glazier's, they have quite a bit of the usual items I like to buy: soy sauce, Amy's and Cedar Lane frozen products. 

Produce:
Great prices. However, I think its hit or miss. I've seen better, but for the prices, just make sure you consume perhaps the day of. 

Gelato Counter:
Really, a gelato counter. Even on a cold day, its always nice to have a scoop of gelato to enjoy the trip

Deli Counter:
Tons of freshly prepared items and salads. Including sesame noodle salad and some East Coast favs white fish salad, chicken liver salad.
Boars Head deli meats.

Refrigerated Cases:
Tons of cheeses. Including some specialty cheeses like the drunken goat cheese. Then, it sections into cusines, tamales (looked great) to marinated olives to fresh pastas and sauces.

Rotisserie:
They were out of the flavor we wanted, but my friends go on and on about the lemon/garlic.

Wine:
Great selection. There was even someone sampling the wine.

1791202,2017-01-19,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"There are many parts of Glazier's Food Marketplace (cafe, bakery, grocery store, etc.), but this review is for their grocery store itself.

When I first moved into the area a year ago, Glazier's offered me a refreshing and exciting grocery shopping experience. The store is very clean, spacious, and offered a wide selection of ready-to-eat food and grocery items. Items were decently priced, and there were some really good deals throughout the store. But after months of shopping there, I came to realize that there's plenty that was missing in my shopping experience that caused me to go back to shopping at places such as Vons, Smith's, and Wal-Mart.

I did some price comparisons of items I bought at Glazier's to both Vons and Wal-Mart. Chances are, you'll save at least 15% if you shop at other stores. Don't get me wrong, Glazier's has some really great deals that you'll see every now and then, but when it comes to regular priced items, places such as Wal-Mart will have them beat by quite a margin.

There also seems to be a lot of items missing. Whether it's trying to find a selection of healthy bars or trying to make something from a recipe, you'll struggle plenty of times to find what you're looking for. Because of this, Glazier's isn't a one-stop shop and you'll most likely need to go-to another store anyways.

Last but not least, their customer service! Whenever someone does talk to me or greet me, it's always a friendly exchange. But that is... whenever someone does, which is almost never. If you ever need help, you'll probably have to speak to someone working at the deli or the cashier, which isn't ideal.

I still go-to Glazier's Food Marketplace every now and then, but it's not my ideal choice to do my grocery shopping.",ezIORV7xsOnbfyGAEaQCag,1,0,3,xF6zhyyn7720tqz6-mz7TQ

Both junk food staples of my youth. They have an entire section in the chips aisle dedicated to wise potatoe chips. They have an entire aisle dedicated to Hispanic foods like Goya, that reminded me of the old bodegas back home. The one thing that holds them back from getting 5 stars is their prices.

The fruit selection had always been great. You do have to pick through them but the quality for the price is awesome! I have yet to be disappointed especially as I love me some apples and the selection of apples they have is amazing!! 

I also love the pre-made items. I have tried many different types of their pre-made items and I have not been disappointed. Their Bolognese is yummy and their pasta could've been soggy sitting in the sauce but amazingly the pasta keeps it's texture and has a good chew. Their stuffed cabbage is very good and very meaty. They could've skimped on the meat but they didn't and the flavor of their tomato sauce is really balanced. The stuffed shells are also delicious. The ricotta filling is one of the best ricotta fillings I've had.  The Cincinnati chili on the other hand was a little disappointing. It was a little on the greasy side with not enough chili imho. Cheese tortellini was also only ok as well. 

And oh yeah they have my favorite bialys!!! They are a cross between a bagel and an English muffin... They are found in the freezer section and are so good as they are shipped frozen from NY. So yummy! I cannot find these anywhere else. 

And they are opened till midnight 7 days a week as well. I love their selection of raw meats and pre cooked items. They have a great deli area that uses boar's Head... You can get sandwiches or just buy the meat and they will slice it for you right there.

They also have a great selection of cheeses there, as well as a salad bar.

In addition to the standard grocery store fare, they also have a food counter with several different stations where you can get ice cream, freshly made pizza and fresh deli sandwiches.  There's one other station, but I can't remember what they serve there.

They also have great weekly specials, including some sort of family meal deal.  The deal is meant to feed about four people and usually includes some sort of meat (like a roast), enough veggies to make a side or two and some rolls (or something comparable).  It's usually a very good deal.

We are a Boars Head family. It is the only lunch meat we eat. And Glaziers has a really beautiful deli with a super easy & convenient kiosk for ordering. It's stocked with everything you could ever want. Except a staff that knows how to slice this superior product. My cheese is consistently dirty. Meaning you can see remnants of the last cheese they sliced all over my cheese--same thing has happened with my ham...remnants of roast beef all over it. The cheese is never nicely sliced or separated by wax, by the time I get home, all the slices are kinda just molded into one lump. Impossible to separate without it tearing. If I order something sliced thin or very thin, I shouldn't have a bag full of of thick slabs of meat. I've ordered 'very thin' salami and it's so thick that you would think it's a joke. It has happened so often that I just go to Smith's for my Boars Head. But every once in a while, I'll stop at Glaziers and give the deli another chance. And it always ends in total disappointment. I love their amazing bakery too, but sadly there is never anyone back there to slice my bread.

The good: Employees are generally sharp and helpful. There's a better buzz in the air than what you'll find at a typical chain store. Good prices on produce, and usually a great sale item or two. 

The bad: You have to remove your backpack when you enter (unless you're lucky enough to draw a security guard who doesn't notice). I don't know if it's the best loss prevention technique, because it sort of just admits that someone with a backpack could do a lot of damage. I'd prefer Glazier's take a more holistic approach and step up their camera game, or whatever tactic it may be, and allow us honest denizens to maintain possession of our personal items while we shop.

Typically I'll shop across the street at the major corporate conglomerate and just go to Glazier's when there's a particular item I need. I'd pick Glazier's every time if it wasn't for the backpack thing.

2200031,2014-05-24,11,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"I was so excited to find this market with the Best of Vegas banner outside. It's a very large market but almost everything is overpriced. The premade food available in the deli is as expensive as eating at a fast casual restaurant. Their seafood is about double the price than say WinCo and 3 to 4 times more than at an ethic market.

So if it was just an overpriced market I wouldn't spend the time to write a review, however their customer service really irked me. When we went to check out, we noticed the Jalapeno mustard got rung up the wrong price; $3.25 instead of $2.99. $0.26 you're thinking isn't a big deal right? But that mustard was the last one, meaning they sell out of it a lot, and how many times have they overcharged customers for that. How many other items are ringing up at the wrong prices? It all adds up.

We went back to the aisle to double check the price, and yup, it's $2.99. We tell the same cashier that checked us out what happened. She said she can't do anything and has to ask a manager. The manager could not be bothered; she said she was busy with something else. So the cashier flagged someone else down--the son (or son-in-law?) of the owner. He made the most annoyed face when the cashier told him to check the price. He came back and confirmed with the cashier, never acknowledging us or apologizing for the ""mistake"".

So I'm now expecting my $0.26 back. Instead the cashier rings it up and asks me for $2.99. I tell her I already paid for it and I need a refund. She then says, oh ok go over to self serve check out or customer service and they can help you. WTF? Why can't you just open your register and give me a quarter and you sort it out later?

Forget it, it's only $0.26 and now my time wasted on this BS was not worth it. She's telling me to go stand in another line now? So as we leave, she YELLS at us to go to customer service and they will help us.  Never did even ONE person there ever say sorry for the mix up.

Oh and when WinCo rings up an item at the wrong price, you know what they do? They give it to you FOR FREE.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,26,3,1,RAPMPZVpGsSzqZoCU-I-dg
2203587,2016-06-27,4,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"I stopped into Glaziers today after a brief work meeting craving their spicy shrimp salad. I saw an older Asian woman who assisted in scooping and packaging 1lb into a small plastic container. I told her I greatly appreciated it and continued on to the checkout line when I saw how awesome their strawberries looked! I did not have a basket because I was only expecting to grab my salad. As I was adjusting my hands to carry both items the salad slipped and the plastic container cracked down the side allowing maybe 3 shrimp to fall on the floor. 

I backpedaled to the salad section and said to the same Asian woman, ""I'm sorry this slipped from my hands..."" before I could get another word out the Asian woman's eyes darted to an older white woman with long grey hair gathered in a net who threw her arms into the air and shouted, ""Well, WHERE DID IT SPILL."" I continued on to tell her it was ""just over in the produce.."" she cut me off and said, ""Well is it  a lot or a little."" *again throwing her arms in the air* I told her it was very little. I have never seen someone so frustrated over a spilt salad! It was as if I had ruined her whole day!  

I did calmly tell her I wouldn't mind paying for it.

She continued on pointing to the baskets saying, ""why don't you go get one, they're right there, go get one."" Giving me directive as if she was my teacher in school reprimanding me for a perfect accident. 

At this point I even offered to clean up the spill to which she turned her back on me and SHOOK her head NO continuously as if I couldn't see her. I thought she was about to have a mental break. 

All this attitude over a spilt salad? I have never felt so unwelcome in a place of business. 

Who is this woman and why is she so miserable and sassy with customers.... Furthermore, why does she think it's okay to wear her inconveniences on her sleave?

Tossing her hands at me, shouting at me, reprimanding me, turning her back on me, shaking her head in disapproval at me. Who does she think she is? 

I smiled and was polite the entirety of the interaction. I understand it may suck you may have to pick up a few shrimp from the floor by why the sass? I EVEN offered to do it myself, or at least pay for it. 

.... The Asian woman finally handed me a new salad without a word and I continued to the check out where I did express that I had spilled a salad and again offered to clean it up. i also expressed my interaction with the woman to a supervisor who was very polite. I am not usually a person to speak with a manager but I was so thrown off by my experience and how someone could be so upset over a salad that I felt the need to. 

- - - - 

I do enjoy Glaziers for there extremely fresh produce, fish, and poultry. I also value the other workers in the store, they give great assistance and seem to be very cleanly. 

If you run into this woman, forget about getting yourself some fresh salad and keep it moving!",C690KeIEqm1K0U97MHVMWQ,10,0,1,L4Fisg58cSx3TkmfVnKQyQ
2208485,2011-11-20,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Okay, so I don't even know where to start with this one because this store really is that incredible. If you've lived in Las Vegas for awhile then I'm sure you've traveled or vacationed to other places only to return home and wonder to yourself: ""why don't we have any of those cool things they have in ____"", well now, we finally have one of those places!  

     Glazier's Food Marketplace, aside from how freakin' cool it is, is also one of those things this city has been in need of for quite some time. In the midst of all the typical chain grocery stores like Smith's, Albertsons, Vons, ther was never really anything that stood out before, which makes Glazier's a breath of fresh air.

     When you first walk in the door you can see rows of fresh produce directly in front of you, but turn to your left and you can immediately see what makes this store different. They have an open market-style feel with fresh pizza, deli, gelatto bar, fresh coffee, sushi and other fish. Turn to your right and there is a self-serve salad bar with a plethora of toppings. Walking towards the back there is a bakery to your left, a full service deli salad counter to your right, a huge sausage ad meats counter in the back with all kinds of fresh cuts. Next to that there is a seafood counter with a wide selection and they even steam your crab for free! Just before your make the last turn to the right to head to the grocery isles there is a deli meats and cheese counter and this is what tops the list. To order your sandwhich meats and cheeses you first walk up to a kisok, choose what you want as much as you like, touch the screen to submit your order and it prints you out a reciept to take along with an order number and you can choose to have it text you when your order is complete! If you decide to wait while they work, there are screens that tell you which of the four stations are working on your order and you can watch your meats sliced fresh! It's nice for busy people to not have to wait at the counter all night on someone that has no idea what they want, because the most time consuming part of the process is moved out to a kiosk. Best idea ever in a grocery store. That wraps up the open market syle area with classy neon signs along the walls and a seating area with a live piano playing while you have a bite to eat.

     As you go down the rest of the grocery isles, you can tell there is a much wider selection of things you wouldn't find in a typical grocery store. All kinds of specialty items so unique, and hard to find, like chocolate soda lol. The prices on some of these things are a little higher than other stores, but you cannot beat the prices they have on fresh food. Glazier's has rows and rows of fresh, in-house prepaired food for you to take home and use or finsh. Their pastries section is unrivaled in selection and price. The best part of all is when time came to check out, they had all 8 of their checklanes open and four more express self checkout lanes bringing the total to 12. How often do you see ANY store with 100% of their checklanes open? Yeah.

     I could literally ramble on all day about how amazing this grocery is, but all I can really say is to go check it out for yourself. When you do go, be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to wonder through the store. You are guranteed to find something you will love, but giver yourself the time to see it all. We didn't have enough time to take it all in, though I already can't wait to go back and check it out again. It's 24 miles from my house in Centennial Hills but plan on making the trip frequently as I know it will be worth it. This city is lucky to have such a wonderful, local store to shop for food. This is a very unique place and everyone in this city is missing out if you don't go.

2250554,2011-06-28,2,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"If you ever feel like Southern Nevada has become synonymous with Eastern California - and I'm not saying that like it's necessarily a bad thing, but you know... - a trip to Glazier's may be your ""back east"" antidote.

Glazier's is a neighbourhood grocery store stocking all of those items you expect to find at the big chains like Albertsons, Smith's, and Vons. One difference, though, is that Glazier's enthusiastically offers an ever-growing selection of seldom-see-round-here New York favourites. I don't remember all of the brands (expect Tastykakes), but I do know I've had to stop reading the food column in the newspaper. Half of the requests people make there could be fulfilled with just one trip to Glazier's. Almost every aisle has signs like ""Straight from the Bronx!"" and ""A New York classic!"" I'm so baptized in Big Appleness when I shop there that by the time I reach the checkout lane, I'm standing ""on"" line.

Also distinguishing Glazier's from the pack is a small food court with a gorgeous grand piano, but I don't feel like this area gets much use. Here you'll see the pretty lemonade (kind of weak the one time we tried it), the gelato/smoothies, the Boar's Head sandwiches (I may be a vegetarian, but these look heartily appetizing, like something from an extremely sanitary Renaissance fair), the rotisserie/sausages, and the (New York-style) pizza (always with a weekly special, but Grimaldi's is just down the road, so...), but most people seem to get stuff to go and the piano rarely plays. That's okay; having or not having a ""stay a spell"" culture in one corner of the store doesn't really affect how happy I am when selecting a plum.

Nearby is the salad bar (sold by the pound), the sushi section (items from the same place everyone else seems to get their sushi), and the bakery (baguettes, some artisan loaves that tend to be dense, and a few things not found elsewhere, like very thinly sliced French bread). Glazier's is the only store in town I know of that stocks ""both"" kinds of eclairs - the kind with the custardy filling and the kind with the whipped, sugary filling. If you've ever been in a ""no, THIS is a real eclair"" battle, then you appreciate what Glazier's is offering.

Across from the bakery are packaged dishes, like cheddar mashed potatoes, fettucini, corn relish, and so on. I can't say these have done much for me, and they seem to be more expensive than similar offerings at Fresh & Easy. I'm not the best person to judge, though, since rarely do I see anything I want. The deli case has all kinds of salads and even an electronic kiosk for pre-ordering, but again, nothing in there has really begged to come home with us. The lines at the counter would say ours is the less common experience, though. 

Glazier's usually has a cheese or two out for sampling, which is how I learned of the wonderful Kerrygold Dubliner as well as the Australian Boxing Cheddar. Also out for samples is usually some kind of doughnut. Glazier doughnuts become incredibly cheap after 7 p.m.. Tastewise I'd say they're fresher/more carefully prepared than Winchell's up the road, but not as flavourful as Dee's across the corner. (But, since Dee's always closes early, you can do worse than Glazier's fare.)

The vegetarian, organic/natural, and international selections are a little more varied than the usual chains. Hispanic items come down to the usual, with novena candles and maybe some spices you don't always see elsewhere. The Jewish section is very strong (at least to my shiksa eye).

The produce area may look small at first, but I've never been unable to find something. Last week they had the bonniest tomatillos I've probably ever seen in my life. 

As you enter the store (passing one of two Redboxes and a vending machine that stocks - fluttery heart! - Yoohoo), be sure to pick up a flyer. Every week Glaziers gives you two things for free with a purchase over $25, and it's usually something useful, like lettuce or aluminum foil. When you leave, you can go with traditional checkout or self-checkout. No loyalty cards required. *high-five to the sky*

Guess what I found out at Glazier's last week? I mean, other than the fact that locally made Joe's Cola will be back in stock ASAP. (Speaking of which, Glazier's is great about fulfilling requests. We've discovered several new products from ""as requested"" signs in the aisles, and of course now we don't have to go to Whole Foods for our Joe's.)

What I learned is that Glazier's donates ALL of its profits from the sale of pet products to help local abandoned animals. Yes, 100%. If you buy your Milkbones at Glazier's, you're helping Las Vegas critters. (Now I just need to ask Glazier's to start stocking Hartz hamster mix.)

There's no single grocery store in this city (country? world?) that has everything I want, but it feels good to shop at Glazier's. There's a ""customer-conscious"" vibe, spacious/quiet feel, and the price and selection is right. And let's not forget the pets. Woof!",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,5,4,4,d9GSAJHevoO0GODP7lpsKQ

After three years of stalling on coming to this place, I've finally bit the bullet. About damn time! Not sure why I've waited so long especially since they've won best grocery store for three years.

Loved how organized the store is. It's large but has that small town grocery feel. Three workers asked us if they could help us which was great. That never happens as smiths or albertsons. Time for change! 

Noticed lots of different food you can't get at other markets. Chips from Chicago, pizza flown in from Italy. Special food from Hawaii. It's nice to have such a variety. 

Prices are average to a little more expensive. I noticed on a couple items they were cheaper. Buy one get one free. Some fresh produce. Fresh baked items. I guess you just really need to pay attention to prices and their ad. 

Loved the pre made meals near the deli. S many options for lunches or quick dinners. Anywhere from mothers cooking, to Mexican, to salsas and hummus. 

They have a deli with good priced fresh subs made to order, a deli where they make fresh pizzas right in front of you where you pick the toppings and a gelato bar. So many options, to little time. I could spend some serious money in here if given the chance.

I'm a cab driver here in Las Vegas and I've been to just about every supermarket and specialty store as I love to cook.  The quality of the products here in Glazier's in amazing and while some of the prices may be just a little higher, if you check their weekly ad, you'll find more than enough things to balance out your shopping budget to splurge on really great items.

Glazier's has a weird habit of taking customer's recommendations and bring those items in (AWESOME right?).  You can tell which ones they are as they have tags showing that they are a new item which has been requested.  As I haven't yet found the need to request any particular item, I'm not quite sure how to go about doing this, but I'm sure the very helpful and attentive staff knows how.

They have a lot of items you can't generally find in other stores including UNOs frozen pizzas, a full assortment of Tastykake and Drake's snack cakes, a decent Hawaiian section as well as other things like frozen whole duck or a brick of Scrapple.

This is not your regular grocery store and even if it's out of the way, it's definitely worth going to.  I live almost 10 miles away and I'll make the drive at least once a week!",lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,2,3,5,YM8Dofwz74E1FSLPtMV8SQ

After getting a couple of produce items, I went into the dreaded deli section. My wife wanted some fresh salsa and picked up a pico del gallo and a salsa roja. Now at home, she opens the pico gallo and asks me if I opened it to check it. I said no, why? There was NO plastic seal under the lid and it looked dried out. Besides, without that protective seal, who knows what can happen if someone did open it and contaminated it. Then she opens the salsa Roja and it was just horrible! You call this quality food? It's not worth driving back across town to complain to management. We already know that they could care less. 
There was one comment about the baked goodies sold here. Well if you look closer at the ingredients, 95% of the oil used in their desserts have partially hydrogenated oil in it. Majority of the chocolate used has the clog-ur-artery oil in it at Glaziers.

Last week, it was a bunch of celery (something I actually needed), and this week, it was 6 Campbells Tomato or Chicken Noodle soups.

Firstly, I have been going to Glaziers since it first opened. There is an abundance of East Coast brands as well as foreign brands that I love. I appreciate the diversity of the food from lavash to cannolis. However, for the past 3 years I rarely go to Glaziers; actually I dread going there, but they offer some brands I can only find there, such as Herrs. 

Why? I am FREQUENTLY stereotyped as a shoplifter with my boyfriend. We are both young, 21 and 22 year old UNLV students, who typically spend more than $100 per shopping trip. Yet, we have been trailed by Glaziers workers as we shop, making us uncomfortable. Imagine shopping with people following your every move. My bf had bought in an Aquafina water bottle into the store (as its hot outside and we have to remain hydrated)  and one employee accused him of stealing it. I told him he could check the cameras and clearly see my bf walked in with the water bottle (disgusting). 

Additionally, the staff is rude at almost every counter. Today, an older woman working self checkout accused me of having a fake ID when purchasing alcohol. She said, ""why is the license picture this way"", referring to the vertical picture because she was ""used to seeing horizontal"" . I was so appalled, I told her to get in contact with the NV legislature and NV DMV if she is so concerned. I did not have time to explain the license renewal procedure to her, and that I recently turned 21. Honestly, the ignorance and attitude of their employees is offensive.

Prices seem to be on par or cheaper with Vons and Smith's but they have a wider variety of quality produce. I've got one gripe about the deli. At Smith's they'll ask you how you want your meat cut and give you the first slice to taste. Here, I asked the lady to slice it thin. She sliced off the amount I requested and stuck it in the bag w/out showing me. Got back to my place and saw that it wasn't sliced thin at all. Disappointing but not that big of a deal I guess. I was also looking for creme fraiche but they didn't have any so I had to head down to Fresh & Easy to pick some up. Still, they seem to have stuff that other big box stores (like Vons or Albertson's) don't have.

I read in the local paper (""The Southwest View"") that this place is a real mom-n-pop operation.

They have a different ""Family Meal Deal"" every week which is pretty cool.  For example: Buy 3 pounds of ground beef for $10, get buns, a bottle of water, a salad and a canned vegetable for free.

They also have store coupons for random free items with a $25 purchase; this week it was a large cantaloupe and a 64 ounce bottle of apple juice.

They have a pretty extensive ""ready-to-eat"" and hot food stations as well as a nice seating area so you can eat in the market.  Off the top of my head they had a coffee station, ice cream, pizza, deli sandwiches, fried seafood, bbq pork ribs and fried chicken.  I was kind of surprised to see that they were taping a food demo in the deli station and a little more surprised that the Chef doing the demo is kind of my boss (Executive Chef at my restaurant's sister restaurant).

This trip I specifically came for TastyKakes (I guess it's an east coast thing; think Hostess, but not as sweet.

Oh, and I received the 2 free items that week :)

Good grief LVRJ readers, just go to Glaziers, because every week the answers are usually the  same.. We found it at Glaziers.    Sometimes, I wonder if the readers of LVRJ are brain dead?  Well, yeah....any reader who submitted that the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas is Olive Garden...Can't be too smart. 

The rule of the thumb for Glaziers, always pick up a circular before walking into the store.   There usually a few specials on the front page, and you'll need those in-store coupons.   Glaziers food marketplace is one of the largest supermarket in Las Vegas, and has a wonderful deli area, and a pretty good selection of produce.   The saying goes for this place, if you can't find it at this market, you might not find it in Las Vegas.  To some degree that's a true statement.

Heads up, the Ahi Poki is very good at this supermarket :)    But why Glaziers have to be across town from Henderson.   Please open your store in Henderson soon.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,2,1,4,wsd68nhHUOUL7yKfgfuQcg
2901948,2010-08-19,8,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"This is my 3rd review for Glazier's.  Gee whiz, how do I find the time?  Actually, this time I'd like to focus on their prepared food items/pizza/salad bar/gelato.

I have tried the pepperoni roll-ups, swedish meatballs, and some other easy prep items from Mrs. G's prepared food area.  None of which was worth trying again.  I'm sadden to say this, really I am.  None of the items had any zip, taste, or verve.  

The fiancee and I recently purchased one of their 'new' pizzas.  It's not a NY style, not a deep dish, not a thin/crispy crust.  It's somewhere between a NY and a hmm.... no words to describe it.  The pizza chef/manager told us Glazier's recently (within the last 4 months) changed their pizza recipe.  I wonder why?  Was it not selling, too many complaints, or too many whiny commentors?  So, the new version we brought home was okay and definitely worth forgetting about.  The sauce on the pizza really was quite upsetting.  I personally don't enjoy munching on tomatoes; the pizza had huge chunks of them in their sauce!

Ahh the good ole salad bar.   How I love thee.  So fresh, so clean, so good.  My fingers want to keep piling vegetables in my to-go container when I'm around thee.  But at $6.88 per lb. I must  exercise restraint, for I have already created a 2 lb. + monster from your bed of greens.  

Remembering when Glazier's first opened, they had fresh dipped ice cream available by the scoop.  Ice cream is good but, I have to be in the mood for it.  However, recently there's been a change in the freezer to GELATO!  This stuff, gelato, yummy goodness, I'm always in the mood for!  COOKIES AND CREAM and MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP are my weaknesses.  Glazier's carries both!  WHY, damn it!  However, at $3.79 for 3 scoops I cannot cower at the price, I'd be willing to pay double or perhaps triple (and have paid 5x the amount for the same thing at the Forum Shops @ Caesar's).

Though Glazier's needs some work on the Mrs. G's prepared foods and pizza, they're doing a mighty fine job on their salad bar!  And whomever decided to replace the ice cream with authentic Italian  gelato, I'm coming over to give you a big kiss (j/k).",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,12,8,4,ernGqTl6MkiqIvGifgh7EQ

Produce is bruised and substandard. However they have a lot of specialty items you can't find elsewhere - NYC bagels, gnocchis, etc. The store is clean, but that's likely from people not shopping there.

It's almost like a Whole Foods as far as having the deli and different choices of food to order. But I can say one thing about their pizza. *Hard*. Thinking it being a New York style pizza, you'd think ""thin crust"". Not really. The dough is pretty tough, not flaky crispy. If I saved this pizza for leftovers, when it cools I'm going to play Frisbee golf. And the instructions you get on the pizza only states, ""Preheat oven to 350F"". That's it. It doesn't tell you how long to actually bake it for. The marinara sauce was alright. I would say that was the only good thing about the pizza. I got the cheese pizza because the pepperoni pizza only had maybe 10-12 pepperonis. It just didn't look like enough pepperoni. So got the pepperoni individually. So, as far as take and bake pizza goes, I wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather go to Costco.",aAbrmVEgX6NusJhVDEU3ZA,1,0,2,PVKK59zuPVHjuHuc4YXEow
3006350,2011-05-15,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Someone else said, ""Fresh and Easy meets Whole Foods."" I think that's pretty accurate. Glazier's has a great selection of produce and ethnic ingredients. They also have a super bakery, gelateria, coffee counter, deli, and meat/seafood section. In addition, there are a variety of prepared meals if you aren't the cooking type and just want to warm something up, but don't want Lean Cuisine or Hungryman again. The people who work there have always been really friendly and helpful. The ladies at the deli counter are particularly friendly and they have a station in front of the deli where you can enter your order and come back to pick it up after you're finished with the rest of your shopping rather than waiting.

Someone gave them a one star review because they wouldn't allow her to use her fiance's credit card. I think it's just good business practice to not accept cards when the person presenting them to you does not have his/her name on said card. Someone else said she was not allowed to take pictures. I've taken pictures there without incident so that seems suspect as well.

Overall, this is a great place to shop. I hear they're opening one in Green Valley soon too.",bWzl8y3rE_l9QdEOQMFvew,1,0,4,CHzK_NSPQNThe_7ohQW78g

Given, you'll find some gems along the way (I snagged a random knish from Chicago that was so damn good), but for the most part it was a let down for me.

What keeps me from giving Glazier's five stars is the fact that they are not a 24 hour store.  Also, I find their coupons tend to be hit or miss.

3203618,2010-09-10,26,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"I dream of strange things. Midgets with ponytails, a one armed man juggling Faberge eggs, and a sober Lindsay Lohan at a PTA meeting stroking  the head of her child who isn't retarded or born addicted to cocaine.  Strange dreams. Sometimes situations can affect your dreams. I once was asleep on a raft in the middle of the Indian ocean and on the third day I dreamed that I was taking a shower in stardust and soaping up Judith Light, not now Judith Light, but second season of Who's the Boss Judith Light...I am not that sick. When I was living in Pago Pago for a few months while on the run from Romanian VCR smugglers, I dreamed that I was being smothered by a giant coconut with a needle stuck in it...long story.  Lastly when I was...um...in college (for 11 years after good behavior deductions)...I dreamed of supermarkets. Standing in front of the commissary staring at Pall Mall, Marlboro and 2 kinds of spam your mind races, your heart yearns and  your bowels release at the thought of a fully stocked supermarket.

In Las Vegas the only time your bowels release is if you dare to eat the ""manager's special"" meats at Smith's...hell if you even touch it you feel a dribble...or leakage if you prefer. Smith's you don't dream of unless you hate humanity. Albertson's you don't dream of unless you dream of gouging humanity. Von's...maybe...if you dream low.  No, you dream of Glazier's Food Marketplace.  

The first thing that Glazier's is that it is clean. It is exceptionally clean. I would lick the floor, not that I wouldn't most places, but this one wouldn't send me to the hospital. It was strange being in Las Vegas and seeing such a clean store. It is Las Vegas. Las Vegas is either beautiful, clean, new and sexy...or dirty, disgusting, usually high on meth and on the verge of collapse...thankfully Glazier's is the former.  Glazier's is the sponsor to Smith's dirty disgusting, homeless drug addict. You have seen them in NA. Glazier's is all clean, reciting the steps, he has an inspirational story to tell. Smith's is eating flies off of their shirt and sweating profusely. 

Next thing you notice about Glazier's is that it is cheap. Not like Von's where the specials are cheap and the rest is very expensive. Glazier's special are great and their normal prices are excellent. It has the price point of Smith's without the chance of hepatitis or food poisoning. 

Now look around and see all of the different sections for you to peruse... Seafood section, deli, butcher, bakery, pizza place, fresh sushi, and on and on. The sushi is better than Whole Foods or Trader Joe's and a much better price. The fish is fresh and it tastes really great.  The baked breads are very good, the donuts are amazing and the pastries are great.  They also import baked breads, cheesecakes from Carnegie Deli and other great items from quality vendors.  They have a sausage factory...okay...read that again...SAUSAGE FACTORY. I am not talking about Cherry on a Saturday night...I am talking about real sausage. 

The fruit and vegetable selection is excellent, it is cheap and it is fresh. I bought vine ripened Beefsteak tomatoes for .88/lb. Outstanding. Bought some great oranges, mushrooms, and scallions.  

Lastly, for all of you have done time...I mean spent time...in the East cost you know that there is only one good sweet treat...and virtually no one has it in Las Vegas.  Tastycakes. Yes, dear reader...Tastycakes. They are the best desert a human being can buy. Glazier's has them because they have an east coast history.

If you like good food. If you like different foods. If you like good deals. If you like clean. If you like self respect. If you like Pilipino biker chicks...sorry...wrong review...then you will like Glazier's.  Just remember this dear readers...never ever stand on you cart and tell them that there is only one thing more beautiful than Glazier's Food Marketplace and pull down your pants.  No matter how right you are...they have to pretend like they don't like it. Damn Puritans...you ruined this country!",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,21,16,4,uNRU62wT_HLwvqb_51WGEg

I come to Glaziers quite often when there isn't anything in my fridge for dinner. Glaziers always saves me from my hunger pains. They have a cute little dining area with a self-playing grand piano that you can use after you paid for your meal. 

- Their salad bar is fantastic. It's a little pricey at almost $7/pound they give you a great selection. You can taste the freshness in all of the products as well. You can find your regular salad bar goodies like your lettuce, carrots, broccoli, etc. as well as pasta salads, marinated mushrooms, marinated artichokes, and a good array of other fancy salad dishes. 

- They sell yummy sandwiches, pastas and pizzas. In the day time there's a sushi guy there rolling up California and shrimp tempura rolls in addition to salmon and tuna sushi pieces. I personally like the sushi there, it's a good quick fix. 

- They have a wide selection of ready-made individual dinners. From lasagna to pasta to meat dishes, these are perfect to buy and eat later. The only thing is that I think it's a bit overpriced (i.e. small individual piece of lasagna is about $6)

Their fruits and vegetables looked very fresh to me and the prices were great.  They have pretty much everything as a vons or smiths does and their prices seem ""cheaper"". As I got to the front and was ready to pay my total came to $100 bucks.  With what I got I honestly feel like I could have gotten better deals at Vons or Smiths.

No where on the coupon does it say you cannot include Dairy or Alcohol in this purchase, and by this time you're checking out.  The cashier was eager to educate us and tell us it is the ""law"" not include those items.  I never heard of that law, but it would have been nice to be reminded of it on the ad before you go check out.  The cashier seemed very annoyed about the idea that we wanted to get this free turkey - that Glazier's used to lure you in the store to begin with.  The cashier was rude about it.  I hit $130 and grabbed other items around me to meet the goal of 150 after the eggs and wine was pulled off the equation.

The prices are extremely reasonable and their weekly deals are great.  Always pick up a coupon paper on your way in.  There are usually two free items when you purchase more than 25 dollars in groceries.  Anything from toothpaste to celery.  They also have great package deals where if you buy some meat you get a bunch of free stuff.  It's not high quality stuff, sprite, potatoes, onions, buns, etc...but it's free and great when you are on a budget.  I have had nothing but great interactions with the staff.  At the deli counter one of the ladies was actually cutting coupons for us so we were sure to get our discounts.  

I saw someone posted that the produce is just a day away from being rotten.  I have not found this to be the case.

I was on a mission to find some thin-mints for Grandma's X-Mas eve dinner. Knowing this is an east coast family run store, I figured they would have them being that my Grandmother is from New York and traditionally has had thin-mints at her table dating back to New York. Therefore, after playing hockey and going to the gym, I stopped by to see if they had any Thin-mints... you know the kind made by Zachary in the white box. 

After asking some various store clerks and checking the candy isle, I discovered they were not in-stock and left. I got in my car and drove towards TJMaxx when I saw four people, one upper manager, one supervisor, one security guard and the maintenance guy staring angrily at me and my vehicle as I drove by. Thinking they thought I may have stole something, I stopped and asked if there was an issue. They responded negatively and the maintenance guy shooed me along condescendingly. I felt very uncomfortable and degraded to say the least. 

Because I shop there often, I wanted to go back in and clear up any possible misconceptions. I was met with the same hostility as they told me they thought someone, supposedly other than me, had stolen something. The manager was still unapologetic and hostile in his approach and I was left still feeling they suspected me of wrong-doing. I felt this way because the maintenance guy weirdly was laughing at me and the managers where surrounding me nonchalantly attempting to look away but obviously there because of me. I felt I was on the verge of getting beat with the maintenance guys broomstick.

I understand shrinkage in retail is a big problem during the holidays but their approach was wrong and thuggish. I only hope someone else that leaves without purchasing does not get the same accusatory demeanor that I received today--not everyone is a suspect.

I hope Glazier's management team thinks about perception the next time a group of employees come running out the store angrily looking at a customer who is leaving only because he/she did not find the item they are looking for.",ifMA9gPDmG8t5pUl6XKjWg,3,0,1,DSSgDjDXk3G4Ds31mLvFhA

I'll start with the reasons I shouldn't love it...okay, yes, produce is hot or not.. Sometimes they have THE BEST looking everything, and sometimes things are on their last leg.

Sometimes their prices beat everyone in town. Sometimes things are priced high.

Sometimes the employees grumble and seem annoyed but mostly NOT. It seems the owner runs a tight ship, so some stress is understandable... the attention to detail is usually obvious.

I love that they are owned and operated by a family. I do most of my shopping here regardless of any negative aspects. They try to bring things in that people request. They carry Chicago products that no one else carries. They have, in my opinion, a really good pizza whether you take & bake or get already made.

I guess I like the vibe, when I first shopped here I didn't ""get it"" it seemed weird, the food court and the store. Now, I just like it. It's different and it's small business in a way that chain supermarkets are not. I think it would fall in the ""Locavore"" category. They even carry locally produced stuff, Pahrump Valley Coffee & CJ's Custard are 2 of my favorites.

I love that I can bring my grandmother here and she can argue with the owner about pineapples. ;)

I was really happy with the meat selection, variety of baked goods (including cannoli with the shells sold separately from the filling - a must), and overall treasure hunt feel because you never know what you're going to find. (A recent addition to our household has an inexplicable fondness for Shasta Tiki Punch, and they sell it here by the 12 pack for $2.50. Score!)
They had a lot of items on sale like oranges for 50 cents a pound, small artichokes 4 for a dollar, and boneless chicken breast for $1.44 a pound, Pretty good. But, if you come here seeking treats from the East like Drake's Cakes or Wise chips, they seemed hideously overpriced (especially since they recently had a flood of Wise chips on sale at my beloved 99 cent store).

And they have a pretty good stock of wine but check Lee's or Walmart first to make sure you're really getting a bargain.
Finally, we stopped at the counter for lunch on the way out and were pretty disappointed. The employees are nice enough but the reuben was a scrawny panini and the shrimp sandwich special was watery, bland and flavorless. 

I will probably go back because Babygirl loved the hot links I found there, Logilicious consumes Tiki Punch like the apocalypse is near, and I really want to try those cannolis.

When I got home and called them about it was their manager stubborn.No negotiation, no compromise, nothing. She claimed that in the fine print (very fine, I have a high power magnifying glass that I use to read it and it is on a different page) they claim not responsible for typographical errors. Have they ever heard of proofreading?  Do they care that a customer spends time and money to get to their store?   In the past they had a chicken leg special for 38 cents a pound. They did not put out sufficient quantities thus I could not get any and asked for a rain check. Those who gave me the rain check said they would call me when it came in but there was no guarantee on the price.I never got a call and it expires in 30 days anyway.Funny, other stores honor the prices on their rain checks.  Thus, their weekly flyer is only useful for l litter box liner.  Shop elsewhere, That is what I will do and advise all others to do the same. Avoid them.They could of honored the price and lost a little over the week.By limiting quantities (no one would of objected to that) their loss would be small but the customer retention would be high.

It is a bit pricier than other grocery chains, but it's family owned. Some weekends we can afford to come here, others not so much. Depends on what's on the list.

Meats:
They really do have the best seafood in town. My husband and I eat seafood most of the week. When they have a sale, which is at least once a month, we stock up!

Bakery:
Best doughnuts, not so much bakery. I think some cakes are okay, but it's hit or miss. The cookies are the same - hit or miss.

Grocery:
I like the fact they bring in local favorites from across the country. The buyer of this store /knows/ that Vegas is becoming a transplant city. I just wish they'd up the anti on tex-mex. ;) I also like their vegan and international selection. They do have more natural, international and vegan product selection than their competition.

Dairy/eggs/etc:
The coffee creamers are a bit over-priced. We usually avoid buying creamers here and buy at Walmart instead (3-4$ cheaper!). Never had an issue with the milk and cream selection. Usually I hate this part of the grocery shopping experience because spilled milk left on the grates spoils and the smell makes the nauseated. Glazier's does an EXCELLENT job of keeping those grates clean! Eggs... check your eggs before you put them in your cart (as with any grocery store). I just remember going through 8 cartons of eggs until I found one that didn't have a broken egg.

Checkout/Customer service:
I see Mr. Glazier himself walking the floor every now and then. Portly old white dude in a black suit. I've never spoken with him but he seems to have a good rapport with his staff and I gotta give him props for being on the floor instead of holing himself in his office.
Self check out is easy... unless you're waiting for a newbie, then it's painful. lol 
The cashier's are always friendly. There's always a front-end manager nearby. We bought salt for our salt water tank and the bag was leaking. It was the last bag and the front-end manager went and got duct tape to tape it for us. :)

Let me tell you, it's slightly less than pleasant. And by that I mean incredibly awkward and confusing.

If you've shopped here you know that Biaggio's pizza is inside and you can also just purchase a pizza ready to put in the oven to take home. 

When I was checking out on my last grocery trip here, I handed the cashier one of these big pizzas, as it didn't fit on the belt, and somehow that infuriated her to no end. She started with an audible ""ugh"" and eye-rolling, then started telling me, with more attitude than I've heard from a grown adult in my life, that they didn't have a scanner for the pizza and I would just have to wait. I was like - 'ok, cool' - because it was no biggie to me at all. Then she reiterated, but even more pissed off this time, that I ""would just have to wait"" for her and at this point it was clear she was starting to lose it - I've literally done nothing but stand there, not rushing her, or saying anything to her at all, not even in a hurry whatsoever. If you've seen the wide-eyed emoji, that was pretty much my face through this whole interaction. 
Somehow she scanned the pizza, and I honestly didn't know what she was talking about with regards to scanning a pizza to begin with, and moved on, until she had to ring up some wine. 
Apparently that was a trigger for her, too. She asks me for my ID and starts pretty quickly demanding it, rudely, while I try to pull it out of my wallet at what I would describe as a regular to faster-than-average pace, and I then just asked her what her deal was and why she was being so rude, because clearly something was going on here and I was not in on it.

This is when she started raising her voice even more and saying over and over that she wasn't being rude (in an extremely rude way at that lol) and accusing me of 'going on and on' about the pizza - and I reminded her of the fact that: all I did was hand her a pizza, because: all I did was hand her a pizza. My bad, I guess.

I wish I would have just left the groceries there and gone to Smith's or Albertson's because dealing with this unexplainable angry girl was not worth it. We all have bad days, I can understand that, but you've gotta be able to keep that crazy under wraps when you're dealing with innocent bystanders.

And I think it's needless to say, I'll never shop here again.

Wanted some wings and they were gonna take some time to cook.  Told him I would be back later.  Returned just as they finished cleaning and getting ready to close their area.  So sweet.

One of my favorite places to people-watch, thumb through a Las Vegas Weekly, and just chill 'til the next episode AKA until my lunch break is over. They also have a pretty great salad bar, pizza/deli if you don't like sushi. 

I've only shopped here a couple times, mostly for specialty items from Chicago. I did pick up a half a pound of their cookies from NY (self-service) for about $4 that I ate in secret.

They have a huge fresh made convenience (pre-made, packaged) food area. Nice size deli, slicing mostly Boar's Head meats and cheeses. A great bakery with all kinds of fresh breads, rolls, pastries, enough to make a diabetic go into sugar coma just walking by it.

Forgive me, I have not done my homework on the folks who own this place but there's a definite Northeast connection somewhere here. A lot of products that I've heard can only be found 'back east'. Well you can either go back east or stay right here in Vegas and get what you've been craving.

Produce is the main reason I come here. Not always the best looking stuff but you can't beat their prices. If you can stand carrots that are as crooked as a dogs hind leg or cilantro that looks a bit gangly, then try this out. Don't get me wrong, they have a lot of top quality stuff too, I love the hot pepper selection (and price).

Fresh (frozen) fish and meat area are decent, good selection, sometimes you can get good deals, other times not. 

Otherwise, as you migrate from left to right (as most people do) you'll find the occasional good deal here and there, but honestly I go to Smiths or Vons for the canned goods, dairy, breakfast foods, etc. price wise Glaziers can't quite compete there. As most smart shoppers, you have to compare prices and make your own choices.

You can regularly get two giant freshly cut chicken breasts from the meat department for less than $2.50. The place was featured on extreme couponing and recently had a BOGO on excellent already nicely priced cheeses that caused me to buy the max on consecutive days. Sh*ts cheap yo.

Also the produce here all appears to be sculpted out of wax. It's amazing. Most of the fruits and vegetables have cut open ""displays"" so you can see the grade of what you're buying. They have fruits here I've never seen before that make star fruits seem tame. Beyond this the meat department will custom order things happily for you if they don't already have it.

Their sale specials are what sets them apart from other stores like Smiths. You don't need to be a member or have a special card to receive these deals.

I've also picked up a Cajun chicken breast for $1.99 a breast which conclude a healthy, valued meal under $5 with veggies to spare for my NY Steak i selected at 11.99/lb.

I was checking my email after work and saw the new weekly specials for Glaziers - awesome! Scrolled through and saw their deal for Norbest turkey that was going for $0.57/lb if you spent $25, valid through 12/02. So off I went, in the lovely Vegas rain, to stock up on a ham and turkey for Christmas.

Turns out when I get there that the deal expired on 11/27, although it said in BLACK AND WHITE in TODAY'S email that it was good through 12/2. The cashier checks with the manager, who then claims to call THE OWNER who says he is not honoring it. Seriously?! It's on your WEBSITE, the printed circular I have in my hand, and in your email. Buddy, I hate to tell you but you're doing a fantastic job of practicing false advertising. My husband and I have been loyal supporters of your store since you opened but your questionable business practices and apparent disregard for your customer's time and, believe it or not, ability to read, means we won't be back.

I always see Mr. G and he says hello or if he is sitting upstairs in his office he will wave hi.  What can I say.  Bakery very good.  My favorite items are the Italian bread and NY style coffee cake.  You just got to try the cake once.  Donuts are also very good in the morning, not so great in the evening when they are now still full price versus half off several months ago.  Next is deli.  OMG, the selection is amazing.  From the deli meats, cheeses and other salads, no other store compares to prices and selection.  Next seafood.  When they have the live Maine lobsters which they will steam for you for free, I am in heaven.  Wide variety of fish, shellfish and very affordable prices.  Next meats.  Quality is far above Smith's or Albert sons, and I find the prices to be much less.  I particularly enjoy buying my chicken cutlets which are pounded and sliced very thin and are excellent, their NY steaks, boneless chicken breasts and found beef are all excellent quality.  Produce is always priced competitively especially on onions, garlic, tomatoes, potatoes and broccoli.  Their cheeses in the case  by the meat/seafood counters are outstanding.  Great prices on all.  Italian pastas and canned tomato products are very good.  Most usual grocery items prices seem better than Albertsons but maybe more expensive than Smiths.  But remember, this store has grocery products you yearn for which you will not find in your chain grocer, like Dr. Browns soda, Drakes bakery products, Vienna Beef products, NY & Chicago Italian products, Cincinnati chili products, and the list goes on.  I recommend not going there hungry because whenever my husband and I go hungry we tend to spend well over $200.00.  The only negative I will say is that the cashier's are very, very slow.  And on one occassion when I noticed I was overcharged on an item it took almost 10 minutes before the pricing error was verified and corrected.

Update:  As a regular customer who does not live so close I just phoned the store to see if they had an item in stock and the girl who answered the phone, Melissa, was sooooooo stupid, I wanted to pull my hair out.

-Largest selection of Boars Head (no fillers, high-quality) meat, cheese, & other deli products. Every week there is a special for one part meat and one part cheese, for a full pound, which is a great deal. 
-The bread department has some goodies: the pretzel sub rolls are yummy, Hubby loves the italian cookies (sold by the pound), and there are New York bagels (signs says it's made with New York water, haha) in the case. 
-I also like the imported Parmesan (in generic clear containers). Sometimes I will get a loaf of bread at $2.22 (sourdough is my favorite, showing my SF pride). 
-Our son for some odd reason wants to check out the fish department, just to look. I'm curious to try some items on special, but have not yet ventured there.
-We've gotten some wines here, too. Reasonable prices.
-This is the section of the store where we usually pick up items. 

In between the greeting cards and the wine is the Hawaiian Foods aisle, which is where we get our chip mixes (sour cream) for less than $3 a packet (we first saw them at Cost Plus, but then they got discontinued). I think that the Kosher department is located here too. 

There is a huge selection of chips (I opt for the unsalted kettle kind). In October, we tried the Winder Farms seasonal pumpkin egg nog (it was delish). I like the freezer section, because there are so many options for ice cream (Ben & Jerry's, Thrifty, Breyers, etc.), and they carry a local brand of gelatto (CJ's). I noticed the biggest variety of Pepperidge Farms freezer cakes (a childhood favorite). Also, a favorite of NY natives are the Tasty Cakes boxes of sweet goods. I also noticed a huge Jelly Belly aisle. 

Like all grocery stores, you have to know what is good to get here, 'cause some prices are a little higher on certain items. Being a bargain shopper, I pretty much know the usual price points. 

Checkout is pretty quick. The store is clean. And not many boxes out, unless you get here pretty late, towards the end of the night.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,5,NII9U41Ce_HTxIlh0wKcew

The poultry area has some stuff you can't find elsewhere, like cubed pancetta. And they have their in store Italian sausages, both spicy and regular.

Now, I normally hit up one or two or three stores in a week (Sunflower, Fresh & Easy and Smith's) so I wasn't  expecting to have everything I need in one store. This was also the case with Glazier's as they carried everything I was looking for except for organic fruit leather and Boca Bits...I can do without the fruit leather, but the Boca Bits are a staple in my household. And maybe next time I will find these items, as I tend to get overwhelmed in new grocery stores. I opted for the Morningstar Farms starters...but anyway...I like the convenience of Glazier's as their is a PetCo right next store. Typically in our house human food runs out at the same time pet food, so this makes me a happy. Second, you walk right into the produce section. At some stores, this isn't amazing, but a Glazier's I was wowed. The produce section was big, and everything looked good. I purchased a half dozen Gala apples and they looked better than any I've seen at any store. The prices were also very reasonable in that section. Third, the staff was very friendly. Just about everyone I saw said hi or asked if I needed help. Finally, the multitude of ready to eat counters that Misti talks about. I didn't cruise that section since I was trying to be quick. 
Overall, for a weeks worth of groceries, I spent about $30 less than I do with my Sunflower/F&E/Smith's routine. The only thing I noticed that was more expensive was the Healthy Choice Asian Potsticker frozen dinner. Weird, I know...but its my favorite frozen dinner ever.

Every week after I do my shopping, I stop at customer service to get a roll of quarters. Today, I was told by the lady behind the counter, ""We dont' normally do this, but I will do it for you today."" First of all, as an individual who earns my living developing customer service training programs, I was taken back to say the least. I asked to speak to the manager, and was presented with a lady named Flora, who only made matters worse. I told her that I had been a customer for years and that being told ""We normally don't do this."" outraged me. She only made excuses and NEVER ONCE apologized and offer to get me a roll of quarters right away. Glazier's owners should be incensed that this lack of customer service is being exhibited by front end management.

I informed Flora that I would not be shopping with Glazier's any longer and it didn't phase her in the least. I even gave her the groceries I had just purchased and asked for a refund.

I REFUSE to shop at an establishment that treats their customers in this manner.

They tout themselves to be ""family owned""... a ""mom and pop"" which is why I support them. I HATE BIG BOX RETAILERS, but am now forced to shop elsewhere due to the piss poor management they have entrusted with their store.

Shopping here is very interesting compared to the regular grocery store. I wish that when a co-worker told me about Glazier's two years ago that I had stopped in immediately. So much goodness I've been missing.

The store reminds me slightly of a conventional version of Whole Foods. They have so many extras over a regular grocery store. The coffee/tea bar, gelato, cakes, Italian cookies from NY, donuts, prepared foods, salad bar, and so much more. The prepared foods were items I'd really want to buy too. They had sides like green bean casserole! I like that they have an area of tables for those that want to enjoy breakfast or lunch at the store. 

Store offerings aren't limited to cool stuff, they have the usual grocery items too. A full produce section, dairy case, and aisles of shelf items. The fish and meat department was the largest I've ever seen at a store. The store seemed like a grocery store plus to me. They carry everything the regular grocery store carries plus more items. Every aisle had brands I recognize, but flavors and options I didn't even know existed. They even import homemade pasta from New York and a wide selection of it.

Aisles and cases are clean and well organized. Items are all well priced and fully stocked. The aisles are wide. Everything about this store from the selection to the presentation of the store is inviting.

When they first opened,  their produce section was a thing of beauty.

I recently wrapped my hand around a leaking, squishy rotted lemon. I never do the oooh look at that delicious fruit dance in the produce section anymore.
The bakeries prices have also sky rocketed.  We usef to get the cannolis fairly often, but they are way too expensive now. I also don't care for much of their cakes, and I love cake. But I no longer buy them at Glaziers,  as they aren't very good and too expensive not to be delicious.

They have a little of everything. The produce is as good as you would get at a fresh farmers market only cheaper. I get almost all my produce there. I love the fact that some of the fresh fruit tells you where it was from. Thier watermelon and some of thier apples this week come from a farm in sandy valley with the farmers name on it.

They have a real butcher!  One night I was in shopping and they were out of the steaks they had on sale and the butcher said oh wait let me cut you some before I leave and asked how thick I wanted them.Hamburger and chicken is almost always on sale. Normally 80% lean for under two dollars. Seafood section if great as well. Only complaint I would have is they don't always know how to cook some of the fish but I have only had that happen once. Never trying to cook flounder again. I haven't tried thier deli meat yet. 

Premade salads are very yummy as well. My favorite is the macaroni. Made fresh daily I think. You can try any of thier salads if you ask . I always attempt to try a new one when ever I go in. Only one i havent liked and gotten yet is the pesto salad. I am not a big pesto person but for pesto it wasn't bad. The olive bar and fresh salad bar are out standing. I get the salad or pizza for lunch all the time. If you like the pizza crispy they will throw it in the oven for a minute and crisp it up.For the most part thier prices are great. Some things are a bit much but over all  I have to say this is the best grocery store I have been to. Also thier baby food procedes and pet procedes go back to the comnuity to support rescues and shelters. I love the support of our local comminuty. 

Yes I know this is a bit long but if you shop here at all you could probably go on for ever about it. Oh one of thier best buys is the doughnut special after 7 pm. If they have any left its buy a dozen get on free.",Sv-fYxMxUtvX7h4rkKl-zg,4,2,5,TU6ldPLlMEiWylNhffZimg

4461630,2016-01-25,3,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Ok...I have been to this place twice....its nearby and never busy like Von's across the way. However, there is a reason for the lack of traffic in this place as I will go into. The first time I was there, I was just picking up some beer and my girlfriend asked if I could pick up some other items. I picked up some bread and some milk. Got home to find out that the bread had already EXPIRED and the milk was set to expire the NEXT DAY! WTH??? What kind of quality control do they have there?? 

The place inside does look a bit unkept and not as clean as one would expect and the employees are rather unfriendly and don't seem all too thrilled about being there. The 2nd time I was there, I just stopped in to get some wine and wanted to pick up some tomatoes also for a salad. First, 95% of the tomatoes they had out were on the verge of being rotten and the other 5% were way over-ripe and soft. It was really disgusting that the owners of this place allow this sort of situation to take place but if you read through some of the other reviews, you constantly see people advising to ""watch the expiration dates"" on anything you buy. 

My advice? Just FORGET this DIRTY, UNFRIENDLY and SLIMEY place and shop somewhere else....you will be glad you did, trust me!

P.S.Look at this article that KTNV NEWS did on this place!!!! Further proof!!!

It's also listed every week in the RJ Wednesday Food section as THE place to find all those goodies from ""back wherever you came from"" that you can't find in Vegas.

Warm Springs and Durango isn't anywhere near where I live, so we made it a day trip.  Yeah, it's big.  Much bigger than I expected.  The Minneola oranges were on sale for a very good price, right near the door where we entered.  Then I saw the Acme Smoked Whitefish Salad, and thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  And then...nothing.

Yes, there's a food court.  We tasted gelato.  Okay, but just.  We tasted tuna salad at the deli.  Okay, but Von's is better.  The New York potato salad - ghostly white and drowning in mayo - looked like the kind I wouldn't touch at Pathmark, before its recent well-deserved demise.  Away from the deli counter, it looked like most any other supermarket.  Prices were slightly lower on some things and higher on most others.  

I'm thinking that maybe when they have a good sale, you can really score here.  Maybe.  I only glanced at the meat counter, and that looked spectacular, but I rarely buy meat.

I did see a few items from back East that I know don't exist in the other local supermarket here, but they're not the stuff that my dreams are made of.  I will say that the employees were extremely friendly and solicitous, and they deserve big kudos.

I think I've been Wegmanized.  Wegman's, that fabulously unique supermarket chain that wended its way down from upstate New York to parts of NJ and PA, is like no other.  It's not close to me there either, but it's an outing that I look forward to when I'm back east.  I can't say the same for Glazier's.  That is, of course, unless I get an unexpected craving for Acme Smoked Whitefish.  But I'm too old to be pregnant.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,3,3,X5mbb9ksrIQ84dgk4a3FcA

4620456,2011-02-06,1,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"The beer selection at Glazier's is worth a review update alone. Last time I was there, I was surprised to see they had Ranger IPA for $7.99 - $1 less than Smith's regular price. Today, I was even more surprised that their beer selection has grown dramatically. Or maybe I just never noticed it before.

I picked up a 6-pack of Deschutes Black Butte Porter for $8.49. They also carry Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale and Inversion IPA. In addition, they have other brews from New Belgium and Stone, and they carry Dogfish Head 60-minute IPA (though that comes with a hoppier price tag of $10.99... IIRC).

Sure you could find an equal or better selection at Lee's or Total Wine. But this is a freakin' grocery store!

While I'm on review update mode, another great thing about Glazier's is their support of local products. On weekends, they have various vendors handing out samples à la Costco. One particular owner was selling a family recipe BBQ sauce. The label says ""Originated on Grandpappy's Cattle Drive. Henderson, Nevada.""

For the usual things on a grocery list like milk, juice, bread, and eggs, I still go to the grocery stores closest to my house because it's more convenient.

However, the reason I love Glazier's is because their loss leaders are the best in town. Whether it's chicken breasts, steaks, or any other type of meat, the advertised loss leader is an amazing value that can't be beat. Plus, I don't have to buy a 20 pound package to get savings like I would have to at a chain grocery store. Their portions are manageable so I don't have to defrost a foam tray with six days worth of rib eye. To me that's extremely important as I live alone.

I'm probably not the type of customer Glazier's prefers. They want shoppers to come for the loss leaders, then spend money on other profit making items. Admittedly, the variety of items at Glazier's is impressive and they carry a lot of unique things not found anywhere else. However, I'm a simple guy, so I stock up on the loss leader, check out, then go home. My wallet thanks you.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,0,0,5,uj7r6WY-TayMDMHd2sDkhQ
4686928,2012-03-29,0,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Seriously, Not Impressed. Here's why. 

The Good: 
Premade foods. They have lots and lots of choices. 
Lunchmeats and Cheeses: They carry Boar's Head. The full line of it. And when I say full line I can't do it justice. 
They do carry odds and ends you can't find anywhere else. You want a Vienna Beef Chicago Style Hotdog or Polish Sausage Dog? They got the real thing. 
International food: They carry a modest selection of things that I've seen elsewhere so if you live close by you can save some time by buying it here. 
Like Apples? They carry some varieties you don't see very often. 

The Bad:
When you look closer the product mix is weird. They have high end and ultra high end stuff mixed in with Western Family and Springfield generic lines. 
Good luck talking to anyone in the butcher shop, I tried twice. 
The premade salads right up front had the visual appeal of Purina puppy chow that got splashed into a dog's water bowl. Mushy, yucky, slimy, bleech. 
Produce: For a place that carries international food their produce section is downright small and limited. One type of eggplant for example, Albertsons carries more varieties. 
The piped in music lulls one to semi-consciousness so you don't notice the problems this store has.
They have a token beer and wine selection that barely warrants the floor space and cost of the liquor licenses they have to maintain for it. 

The Ugly: 
Pricing. Does anyone in Vegas comparison shop? If you were price conscious you would spot things right away. I didn't take the time to write down everything I saw but I could easily come up with a 30 item list where prices are 30 to 35 cents higher for the same items, some things were over $1 more, and I saw some items that I can get way cheaper elsewhere in Vegas saving $3 or more per item. And we're not even going to begin to compare them with Winco on basic items. 
Produce Quality: Overpriced, overripe avocados shows someone isn't paying attention to what's put on display as an example of several other quality problems this store has.

Friday night is steak night! Juicy steak with corn and potatoes on the side. They serve the meal deal from like 4-8. Get it while you can! I always come like 15 minutes before closing(still cooked fresh as I shop!!)

4884701,2010-09-26,2,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Glazier's is the best market that I've been to in Las Vegas.  It is somewhat like a toned-down Whole Foods.  They have a wide array of selections available to eat now, much like Whole Foods, but it won't cost you your Whole Paycheck (get it?).  The seafood selection is actually larger than Whole Foods, and the meat selection is very nice too.  

When you walk around Glazier's you will notice it is not much different than your neighborhood market, but it is the small details that make Glazier's different.  For example, walking by the back section, you see many exact brands you see at most market, but then you will see Chinese Sausage.  What a random, but ridiculously cool, thing to find in a supermarket.  

I usually spend about an hour in Glazier's because it takes me 30 minutes just to get the meat and fish I want.  I also really like the Family Meal Deal's they have.  The deals change weekly, but are usually something like: ""buy one of these 5# beef roasts and get a bag of potatoes, 6 pack of waters, 12 pack of bread rolls, package of lettuce, 1# bag of carrots, and BBQ sauce for free"".  They usually aren't quite as random as my example, but you get the point.  I usually only have to spend about $10 on a roast I may have bough either way, and I get a bunch of stuff for free.  Great deal.  

I live on the other side of town (east tropicana) and I still come here about once a week to do my grocery shopping.  It's definitely worth it!",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,5,1,5,O1kKwstHSrMwMR4YemWm4A

Its like a nicer version of Albertsons. Some prices are good, some are a bit much (about what I expected from a place with only one location).

Major plus is that they now sell Drakes Cakes (thanks Matt for finding this out). Drakes Cakes are like Little Debbies or Hostess for those of you unfamiliar.

They also carry lots of items I haven't seen elsewhere at fair prices. They have crazy good prices on produce (shop seasonally), and chicken can't be found cheaper anywhere else. They run frequent sales and specials and just all-around make my shopping experience that much more pleasant - if you shop mindfully and just following all their frequent specials you'll end up with a varied, thorough and bountiful cart of all kinds of useful and deliciuos stuff- every week. The staff are friendly and just look like they all feel they're one big family, with the head honcho Mr. Glazier himself sometimes browsing around with his shopping cart full of paperwork checking to see if everything is in order. Very reassuring.

BUT... This here love letter is about their DONUTS. Little known secret I think, which I'm about to blast wide open. These aren't your typical miniscule, Krispy Kreme puffed air sugar-coated morsels. These donuts have heft to them - and when I walk in at 0745 smelling the bakery goodness in the air I know they're warm, fresh and ready for presentation. 

Get them in the morning, and take a few for your coworkers too- they'll thank you. They're huge, covered in just enough glaze (depending on the type), lightly crisp on the outside but incredibly pillowy-soft inside with a texture that makes it a goddamn pleasure to sink your teeth into. Every person I've brought their donuts to immediately demands to know where I got them. But that's not all - they have awesome flavors too. Nowhere else have I found flavors like pineapple and blueberry fritters, red velvet cake donuts, maple and walnut fritters (a personal fave), blueberry jelly donuts. The maple-chocolate swirl is I could swear, more chocolatey and more maple-y than any other version I've tried, and with the bonus of their incredible doughnut dough supporting it all. If you're a fiend for the traditional apple fritter, this place carries a huge, crisp, delicious version. But try the pineapple one too, it'll rock your world. 

Bottom line: they carry lots of great stuff at great prices, but an unusual plus is their array of atypically delicious DONUTS. I'm eating one right now. Thought I'd share :-)",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,4,2,5,8gOefBPTjReFBGNDqVVgWQ

5199104,2010-03-22,4,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"Glazier's is a mom and pop grocery store on steroids--in a good way. One interesting Las Vegas business phenomenon is the back-in-business retirees, people who move to Las Vegas to retire but them become bored and reopen their business. Glazier's is one of these brilliant businesses. Helen and Bill Glazier owned several grocery stores in Pennsylvania before retiring in Las Vegas and subsequently opening up some grocery stores! 

I wish it were closer to my home so I could make it my regular shopping ground. The store is big, spacious and clean. The prices are affordable.  In every flier I have seen they have a family meal deal. For example, buy a 3lb package of pork chops and get 5lbs of potatoes, a can of green beans, a bag of salad, a dozen dinner rolls and a jar of applesauce for free!

The selection is vast. I always read about people finding products at Glazier's that they can't find anywhere else, especially east coast specialties. The store features several counters to order ready-to-eat food: pizza, fried shrimp, sandwiches, sushi, ice cream. Once you grab a meal, there is a little area with booths and a player piano--snazzy! The only thing that did not look appealing was the pre-made salad counter. Some of the salads look like they had been sitting there for a bit. They should just stir 'em up to prevent them from getting that filmy look. 

We left with some cheap, tasty sandwich buns and some bagels. The bagels were a little disappointing, but overall, I would be happy if Glazier's moved closer to my house!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,12,4,VK3KWb_4BgjACnnlQJMpEA

This weekend, for the 4th of July, my fella and I stopped in to take a look at their meat selection for a ""grill off"" competition we were participating in.  

First of all, what a selection in their seafood department!!  A huge slab of yellowtail Tuna (although I heard from another Yelper that this was not really good), HUGE shrimp that looked amazing, lobster tails, king crab clusters (not just the legs), and monkfish!  I've never seen monkfish anywhere, and at $7 a pound, we got 4 pieces and had a delightful lunch.

We also found veal chops, which my fella and I had never seen before.  The chops were about an inch thick, so we asked the guys behind the counter if they could do a custom cut (inch and a half) for us.  They were more than happy to, showing us the meat and where it would be cut prior to doing it.  

This right here is what makes me prefer Glazier's over Smith's.  At Smith's, the guys working the meat department are high school kids who don't know what a Cowboy cut is.  These guys actually KNOW what they are doing, and they know about the meat, the different cuts, etc.  

I am definitely thinking that we will start shopping here more frequently again.  

The produce looked great, and we picked up broccolini and endive, which I haven't seen in many other stores.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,1,4,zmkppGYSqZOrIi6CnBbOmw

My husband was so taken a back by all the beautiful meats he insisted we go get a grill - pronto. A sausage factory? 96% Lean ground beef under $3? I'm in heaven. I have only had one visit to this meat and seafood mecca, but for me that seems to be the highlight of this store.

Next impression - quite impressed with the bakery. The bread we bought was oh so soft and delicious. Great selection of cakes and baked goods for under $5. I know where to go next time I feel OK with consuming an extra 2000 cals in one sitting. 

So far I'm not overly impressed with the rest of the store. I do like that there is no membership card (I hate those!), but the selection of random things like shredded cheese, flavored creamer, and say crescent rolls wasn't nearly as good as Smith's (yup, I have a weird shopping list!). 

The low point for me was the wine selection. My Smith's has more wine , the price is better, AND I get a 10% discount for buying 6 wines at once. The selection was awful - all grocery store brands, nothing cool or independent. I expected some cool wine at such a huge store ! Prices on all my regular wines were $1-$2 more and then NO DISCOUNT.

Having thought to have exhausted The Valley's list of Doughnut shops over the past two years it was on the recommendation of a friend that Glazier's Food Marketplace was identified as another source of novel fried dough, and recalling that Donut Mania's owner had once suggested he originally helped establish the grocery store's program it was just after 7:00am on Saturday that a stop was made, the cabinets well stocked with most options still warm.

Advertising a whole new lineup, including four types of fritters to go along with the store's recently launched weekend brunch, it was admittedly with some surprise that Glazier's collection tallied more than two-dozen variations and ranging from cake to yeast and filled to frosted the 89-to-99 cent prices are a far cry from many other artisan purveyors, the results ranging from downright excellent to subpar grocery store stuff.

Holding off a moment before exploring the donuts, a total of eleven selected largely as a result of space  per cardboard box, one could not help but wonder how The 702s ""Best"" Supermarket would fare in terms of made-to-order options, and taking the easy way out by offering fake syrup and a cold pat of butter alongside pancakes so dry they literally crumbled fork pressure the answer can simply be summed up as ""horrible,"" an $8.57 waste of money with more than 3/4 deposited in the trash.

Onward to better things, payment at an automated checkout fairly simple before returning to a table to indulge, opening bites of raised options spoke to a brioche base similar to that of Donut Mania and Pinkbox with just a bit more tooth, the blueberry coconut a bit artificial in its flavor while cream-filled rings of coffee as well as chocolate fared far better, the espresso infused glaze particularly robust.

Unabashedly fond of fritters, a sentiment that many do not share, suffice it to say that those who cite oiliness as a reason for their displeasure need not fear as the ones at Glazier's are actually much 'lighter' than the average, yet although an attempt to raise the stakes with multiple flavors is indeed appreciated the substantial lack of whole fruit beneath a double-shellacking of sugary sweet glaze most certainly was not, the pineapple particularly affronting in its lack of flavor with the vast majority of each left in the box.

Rounding out the morning with a cocoa-rich red velvet cake that made me wish for more classics including an old fashioned or buttermilk bar amidst the group, it was perhaps with good fortune that two bars and a tangy Key Lime Pie complete with graham cracker crumble were saved for last, the lemon filling beneath white frosting and rainbow sprinkles impressive in its tartness while the shredded coconut and cream amidst dark chocolate reminisced of a Mounds Bar in all the right ways, the sliced-and-filled presentation assuring a perfect ratio of each ingredient throughout.

More modestly priced than other places offering novelty donuts, but at the same time not always executing on a level that shows the creativity to be matched by the quality of the staff, those planning to visit Glazier's for Donuts are encouraged to choose carefully while those looking for pancakes or fritters should steer clear and visit almost anywhere else.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,9,3,9eB7OjVKgNIm6hGvsX2lnA

Gosh I thought I reviewed this already... I'd be a jerk if I didn't mention that I got my first speeding ticket coming here... So please go 35 mph on this stretch of Warm Springs --- cops camp there all the time to make a quick buck (or $180 if you go 44 like I did). But anywho... 

Pastries? Cookies, every kind of muffin, breads, cakes, pies - Pastries here are big, bad and beautiful.

From the East Coast? Plenty of  brands here you thought you could only find at home.

On your lunch hour? Almost every lunch craving can be satisfied here if you walk in and go left.... You can even dine in and listen to some piano. 
They have a great salad bar, and options like pizza, sushi, chicken fingers, coffee, ice cream, and I even had fried shrimp a couple of times. Otherwise they have plenty of pre-made meals and sides you can bring home and heat up.

Their  breads, tamales, prepared meats, and fresh-made pastas & sauces are a hit in my house. In addition to finding specialty brands & items, you can easily find pre-made goodies that are a great substitute for cooking your family dinner after a long and arduous work day. There are plenty of options here that aren't available at the usual suspects of groceries. Think marinades and spices.

My gripe is obviously the cost -- while not completely outrageous... it's not cheap either. The staple items that may be on your regular grocery list will rarely be less than your chain-supermarket (Think cereal, and snack food). But seriously-- if you have the time to plan it out and make the time -- you could do both.  And then there's the produce... while extensive --- I'm not a fan-- I spend wayyyy too much time finding a good onion... I won't mention how long it took me to find a decent pear.

I would highly recommend stopping by for lunch. I would recommend checking it out on your next shopping trip.

5366842,2012-10-29,2,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"I shop at Glazier's regularly and have for about three years. I have had some fantastic experiences and some negative experiences here.

1. Their produce is usually good. They have good sales like peppers (red, yellow, orange and green) for .88/ cents a pound. They have 10 limes for a dollar. They have a package of small heirloom tomatoes for $1 (in the summer). Sometimes it is bad when they have a whole area of avocados and not one is ripe. Or the fact that their herbs arent very good.

2. Their deli and prepared meals section is fantastic. I really enjoy the fact that I can order with my phone or in the little kiosk. The problem is that the cheapest sliced meat they offer is $8.99/lb WOW. They have fantastic cheese and  they have almost anything you could want.

3. Meat area. They usually have a great variety of prepackaged meats at a reasonable price. The only problem with the meat section is the rude customer service. I ordered some bacon the other day and the guy behind the counter didn't say a single word to me. He was also preoccupied with staring at the front of the store/door area. It was strange. 

FYI I got food poisoning from here recently from the bacon!! I have also had a couple friends have food poisoning from their bacon and salad bar! Buyer/ eater beware!!

4. Customer service. This is where they lose a whole star for me. Usually they are super friendly. If you want them to carry a new item you go to customer service and ask for it and they 90% of the time will start to carry it (which is why they have such a large variety of food).

The negative is that there are a couple of girls who are completely rude. For example, I was buying forumla and had a manufactuer's coupon (which is NOT a check, it is a COUPON) it had my husband's name on it and the girl told me I will not take that. I asked her why and she said you are trying to cash a check with someone else's name on it and I will call the cops to have you arrested if you try again. UM WHAT! First of all, girl, you should have asked your manager for further clarification on what a manufactuer's coupon is.

This grocery store carries a good selection of ethnic goods and food stuff from the east coast. I am always trying to be a healthy eater and Glazier might be another step in the right direction.

I love the Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar drinks, but Glazier has took it a step further by carrying the pure solution for me to mix on my own. For $6, I can make 20+ drinks. That alone screams saving since a bottle of the premix drink cost $2.50. It might not sound so good at first, but it taste like a more tart apple cider. Just follow the instructions on the vinegar bottle.

We knew then, that food, our first love, would play a part in our relationship, and years later, we still have fun searching grocery store isles. 

Glazier's food marketplace is a very unique store, walking in seeing the hay stacked around the old truck you know that this isn't the usual grocer. Once you enter you are introduced to the freshest produce. There are boxes stacked with the brightest golden yellow, vivid red and emerald green bell peppers, or sometimes it fresh berry's. Your eyes are jumping around at all the baskets, the stacked boxes and barrels of vegetables and fruits. Finally, your eyes find the white sign placed before the object of delight and you see the price, you take a double take and then a moment of disbelief before you realize it's not a misprint. Prices are reasonable. 

If you veer off to the left of the entrance, you find the fresh food counters, there is gelato and sushi, drinks, and sandwiches, straight ahead is a baby grand piano, (have yet to see anyone playing it) and it's surrounded by tables and chairs for eating your fresh bought salad from the salad bar, or the fresh baked double chocolate cookies or donuts from the bakery. There is a large selection of fresh cheeses and sausages, I even found my beloved pimiento cheese spread (childhood memory, spread on toast, makes a great sandwich). 

As you make your way around to the back of the store, you find the meat counter, on display is fresh meats and fishes. If you want a food basket, they can make one up for you. They have a fairly decent wine selection, a comprehensive international area covering several isles, and the rest of the store is just like any other grocery store with the exception of Hawaii products, if you check the freezer isle, you find Zippi's chili, Redondo's Portuguese sausage and even siamin noodles. 

If you come regularly you can find some really good deals, and with the purchase of $25, you can pick up at least two free items, they change weekly, or the family meal deal. It is a bit off the beaten path for us (Warm Springs and Durango), we tend to stay more north of the 215 but since it's not too far from us, we try to make it in at least monthly.

I went back to the pizza counter.. waited another 10 minutes (going on 45 minutes now for food that should've been ready when I arrived) 
I look over and notice the woman from guest services and a heavyset man about 100 feet away just staring into my direction. I approach the man and woman and before I could begin speaking.. the heavyset man, leaning on a shopping cart he's using as a walker starts barking at me that he is THE OWNER and is ""watching"" his new employee and he is aware of the situation. He goes on to explain to me that pizza shops all over town are just as busy. 
I suggested he ask his employees to quote a longer wait time over the phone to avoid inconveniencing customers. 
I'm completely appalled by Mr. Glazier's ""doesn't give a shit"" attitude towards an inconvenienced customer and instead of helping his overworked employee.. Mr. Glazier would rather just stare down his employee and intimidate him instead of figure out a solution to helping out. 
I feel absolutely awful for anyone who works for that man.
Lastly, my pizzas were free (as they should have been)... so glad they were, because Little Caesar's makes a better pie.. and that's not saying much.",npjrtfGnYD05xOLqzzmbYw,1,0,1,dpeebBPHfoXWKTYf8QhA7Q

As far as the bakery. My daughter wanted all kinds of colors for her bday cake. The baker worked with my daughter and planned every inch of this cake.

From the prepared foods section, I got the most amazing poached salmon and a container of roasted squash, sliced paper-thin and delicious. Shrimp (cooked and frozen) from seafood dept was awesome too. No fishy smell around the seafood counter, a good sign of freshness.

It's true that some of the non-sale prices are on the high side (some, not all) but not priced as high as Whole Foods, and just as good quality. And again, lots of items on sale at really good prices.

My sister and her boyfriend went with me and said it had the weirdest vibe. It does. I don't really ""get"" this place. Is it supposed to be similar to a Whole Foods or what? Honestly, it reminds me of a less well let Super Mex grocery store because of the food court-like atmosphere at one end of the store and an Albertsons mixed with a fancy exterior.

The prices are strange. Some items are relatively cheap (wine) and others are astronomically overpriced (organic specialty items) compared with other grocery stores.

I ended up buying spices and what I incorrectly assumed to be olive oil. I should have known that despite the signage for 500 mL of olive oil for less than $5, that it would be too good to be true. Emblazoned across the bottle in large letters is olive oil. In tiny letters on the label it mentions it's a canola blend. UGH!

The store has just about everything you are looking for. A great vegetable section with standard grown and organic items. Bakery is huge with some special imported New York Bagels and cookies to specialty donuts and standard commercial company donuts. The New York Deli section seems almost endless in options and they always have two sections of deli where items/food can be purchased on the spot to go or eat within their food area. 

The meat/seafood areas are just the same with many options of fresh seafood and meats. They have an old style Butcher Shop where they actually cut the meats and package them as you wait. 
They also offer the standard packaged meats/seafood. 
There is a large area of alcohol which includes beer and wine and right next to this area is a specialty area of ethnic foods of different countries. 

The rest of the store is standard layout with its dairy, juices, frozen foods, cosmetics, shampoos, dog foods and toiletries. 

Overall the prices are just a tad higher than other stores but if you are a sales shopper you can certainly make a good budget shopping here, as I have done with meat and seafood times on sale. 

The overall vibe of this store is similar to a WholeFoods or Trader Joes and they are certainly on par with those types of supermarkets in offering quality items.

I've been coming here since November 2010 :))

When I first came here it was 6am on Thanksgiving day... I was looking for last minute items for my feast! :D I was soo hypnotized by the freezer section! I thought I was in ice cream heaven... bright lights and all the ice cream you could ever dream of! wow!

Love the prices, selection, and the staff is really friendly!
Parking is never a problem and I love their hours.

Things I love from Glaizer's:
- ahi shoyu poke
- Boar's products (fresh cuts of turkey, ham, cheese, chicken) make sure to stop by here and place your order then shop around while your order is in process! when they are busy, it may take up to 15-20 mins. until your order is ready to go.
- Their Hawaiian section! good stuff for us local folks...
- Stuffed chicken breast

I get everything here!
Veggies, fruits, poultry, meats, juices, can goods, bread, cereals...

I try to keep my visits under an hour because I can get carried away looking at everything! ha.

I try to come here once a week when I'm passing by the cut off to stock up my kitchen with Glazier goods since I live further north!... so it's all about timing!

My favorite grocery store in Vegas for sure!

I went there to purchase Salmon and again, this quality and selection are awesome.",osQ4bMibJLmMPAtovvEkJw,12,9,5,d2JT1XGTTTxW5YMkRpoYCA

I first went to a local chain grocery store and got screwed over with the selection of wings and the quantity, basically I got less for what I paid for. At the chain stores they either sold small packs of wings or huge packs and for two people I don't need 20 wings... So I went for the smaller pack and got screwed...I was able to call Glazers and get exactly what I wanted, they even stated that they would proportion the wings just to the amount I needed.. AMAZING oh and great pricing too. I should have tried this place first.",b1GeawOP3RAK2X6LW-uq5A,0,0,5,iUII1Ws0SSPOhv9DAXDYIw

The store inside is very neat and organized (big fan of that) and have a great, friendly staff. They have a wide variety of items, some things you can hardly find anywhere else in Vegas. 

The salad bar... Oh my goodness, the salad bar. I come here for the salad bar alone too often. So many options. So many toppings. Also, the deli and pizza place looks pretty dang good and I would be more than willing to give them a try, if I am ever not in the mood for their salad bar. (Just to be clear, I would never eat at any other grocery store's deli section. They're just that good)",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,3,1,4,q1xlp-6yP32Nb3HhKfiLCA

However, I grab two pounds of cookies today that I have not found here and Vegas and as I was driving home I was so eager to eat one only to find out it was stale.  I went to eat a different one and it too was stale. I was so disappointed and will no longer take the chance of buying baked goods there since i bought ovrr $15 worth of stale cookies:(",WcmMeT_3fnjJniILAg7jHA,1,0,3,uF31WLDiDsrTg9lfCStnaQ

They make their donuts fresh each morning if you like donuts. And they have reasonable prices on veggies and fruits.  Go check them out if you're in the area.

When I first started shopping at this market the produce was great and customer service was fabulous. Now, every time I go the produce department is always filled with produce that is just short of going bad. Among trying to find produce that is fresh I had purchased a bundle of mini cucumbers that literally went completely bad and rotted within one day. I also purchased a beauty product there and brought it back with a receipt and I was told I couldn't return the product. The manager was reluctant to help me and told me that I could not bring it back because of store policy however there is no section on the receipt stating that you can't bring back beauty products. I called the general manager to see what they could do for me and I had no return phone call. I used to like this place a lot before the produce department went to crap and the managers are not helpful. I only go to the store unless I absolutely have to.",xcdT5GxG7oGEWEBH4uM-Cw,1,0,2,fZxn7vNaj9qPovlvExiucQ

I have tried a number of their pastry items from coworkers who have brought goodies in for pot lucks and other special occasions so knew they had a lot to offer. We walked in and it instantly reminded me of an East coast supermarket. They have an extensive selection of East coast goodies, both cooked and uncooked, ethnic foods galore and lots of healthy and organic items. I look forward to coming back with a longer shopping list next time.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,6,4,LawKFYdQsmEJAY_Z_m_iRA

5995140,2017-07-22,2,JWDiG0nSsM7GQ9QFRTxU9w,"A very interesting type of grocery store. This isn't your conventional Smith's or even Von's. No, they carry popular brands with a mix of East coast that you can't get anywhere else. Shall me say, ""cheesecake from Junior's""? Now, you don't have to buy from their online store to experience a delicious New York cheesecake thanks to them. 

Everything here is marked pretty well with many items going to sale for your convenience. Of course, I am very happy to have this store near my place because it's quite different from the others. From the inside, they have a deli, ice cream store, pizza joint, and a sushi stand. They also have a giant wall of donuts to which you can help yourself and pay at the counter. 

The background music here is always with a touch of classical so you always feel like you're blending in with the rich folks :P especially when you're at the wine section! The ambiance could be better as it does feel a bit old. A renovation should happen pretty soon.

Overall, it's a wonderful restaurant for everyone to visit!",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,2,1,4,YSaVCh0kO17Dw_St_dVwxA
