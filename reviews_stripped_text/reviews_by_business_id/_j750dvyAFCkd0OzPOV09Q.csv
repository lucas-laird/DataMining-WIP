The wait wasn't  bad for a Sunday morning,  but after being shown to our table we didn't see our server for almost 20 minutes.  Got the attention of the hostess as she was sitting other customers and before we could even say what we wanted,  she tells us our server will be right with us.  She must have known!  Still took another 10 minutes for our server to ""appear"" only to put her finger up and tell us she'll be right with us.  I must've had a look on my face that said ""you've got to be kidding me"" so she DOES come and take our order.  We think GREAT,  now it will be ok. No such luck. When we get our coffee,  we need sugar but there isn't any on the table.  Rather than wait some more,  I ask other wait staff for sugar and they tell me to ask my server.  I tell them she's non existant. Finally someone sees me standing around and is nice enough to get me some.  Now we're waiting on our mimosas that we ordered.... about 40 minutes ago.... and also want more coffee.  When our food finally arrives,  we tell her we would like more coffee,  also need more creamer,  and would like butter for our breakfast breads since they were both dry.  Good luck on that!  How about one out of our three requests?????? Once again,  I ask other staff for butter and am told to ask my server.  Good lord, I've never been so aggravated at a breakfast restaurant.  And the sad thing is it wasn't just us.  All the other tables around us were experiencing the same thing.  That was the only thing we could chuckle about - listening to other customers around us and their moaning and grumbling!!! Oh, one more thing.  A serving tray stand feel onto the floor,  in the path of where everyone walks,  and the hostess STEPS over it as she's seating customers.  So does a busser!

1495779,2015-04-08,1,_j750dvyAFCkd0OzPOV09Q,"I was all about this Denny's location until my second visit. So I'm giving it 2 stars for the first visit & I will tackle both visits in my review.

The first visit was to redeem my free birthday grand slam (all you have to do is show your ID on your birthday!) The wait looked like it was going to be a long one but we were actually seated within 5 minutes - which was awesome. Our service was good considering how busy the place was. Our food came out as we expected - it's friggin Denny's... don't expect much, ha! The server left our receipt on the table and we paid the cashier without a problem. Nice & quick breakfast. 

Our second visit was another story. It took a while to be seated... but we figured it would. We had just hoped for a quick seating like the first visit. Our server eventually came over and took our order... which, he was nice but I believe had way too much going on to be attentive. When our food finally arrived (took a while) my plate didn't look exactly look like it had the day before. The potatoes weren't as crispy as I had liked, mostly. The pancake wasn't as fluffy either. Seemed like the cooks were in a rush. We ate anyhow - wasn't a table of complainers. It took a while for our server to acknowledge our empty drinks and by the time he did, it was time to drop the check. So there's that. We finally got to pay and get out.

Now, I've never really had food poisoning so I'm not entirely sure of the time frame but about 2 to 3 hours after eating here I got the worst stomach cramps and all the other symptoms  (according to google) or food poisoning. It ruined my day. Again, I've never experienced food poisoning before but something here during my 2nd visit didn't sit quite well in my stomach... so beware. I don't personally see myself returning.",CdJMYUdSAYu6ZjpgOenvnw,1,1,2,i4dFwABrPC0bXsDeEVDFLQ

2855394,2015-05-27,0,_j750dvyAFCkd0OzPOV09Q,"It was absolutely dreadful.

I have not seen or read anyone else's review but from my experience, I had my first terrible time at Denny's.

Service for me was really rude and unprofessional.

A group of friends and I decided to come here during the night, and we understood that it would be a little crowded; that did not bother us one bit. 

We were seated down and we asked for water, which came after asking for it twice. We were still nice about it as well.

Afterwards, we ordered and we pretty much waited the entire time. No one came to us even though we went to ask about our orders three times. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes for us to get up and leave. It was ridiculous; all the other tables got their food and some people that were served even came after us. 

Anyways, my friend and I decided to come the next day, and this time, it was 65% empty, yet they made us wait. There were so many open seats, and my friend and I were waiting there for a pretty long time already. There were also two other groups of 3 to 4 people who were waiting as well.

We decided to go ask the lady on the left because she was the only one we saw during then, and we were told to stay seated in a very irritated tone. Well, we weren't helped at all so we decided to leave again.

My advice? Don't come here at all unless you want terrible service. There is actually another Denny's nearby; go to that one. It's much better.",pMMAEtpyMe6W9lclK-NHzA,3,1,1,0FDh9z16bSN3O29RGvNtLg
