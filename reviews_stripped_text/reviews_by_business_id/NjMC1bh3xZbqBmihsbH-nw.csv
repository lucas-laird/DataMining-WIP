Ordered a happy hour drink and a pizza for dinner @ 645. When the drink came it was horrible, so I sent it back for a do over. They brought me another drink, just as horrible as the first, but I kept it, as I did not want to upset the bartender. Pizza comes and we enjoyed it, however the bill to follow charged me with 2 drinks. I explained to Bria(waitress), that I only had one drink and furthermore, the second was twice as expensive as the first. Bria told me that the ""do over drink"" was after Happy hours (7pm) so it was @ regular price. I explained that I did not drink the first and the second should not have been charged, esp at regular price. She said the bartender/ manager told her to charge me for 2, when she clearly knew I only had 2nd one, as she dumped the 1st one herself. I was a fan of having a local pub, but if this is how you do business, I will take my business elsewhere. Keep in mind we are only talking 6 bucks, but for me it's the principle. I paid the bill as I did not want to make a scene, but they lost a potential frequent customer.

4720981,2017-06-27,2,NjMC1bh3xZbqBmihsbH-nw,"I went here for their opening party last week and had a good time until a customer service nightmare at the end. I went out of town the next day and am just getting around to the review, and judging from what I'm reading in other reviews I'm not the only one that had issues with rude bartenders here.

First off, I love PTs bars and have been a regular at their PTs at Desert & Eastern and Vegas Valley & Nellis for years. What keeps me going to PTs is their great happy hour prices and great customer service (tonight being a glaring exception). Most of the bartenders that work for them are great!

My wife and I go to every opening because it's a cool party atmosphere and we often see friends that work for PTs that we know. Plus they have $50 match play, which is awesome for gamblers like me. We went to the opening of the new location on Martin just a week earlier and had a great time. The Manager there, Susan, is one of the best bartenders I've ever known.

Now this PTs on Silverado Ranch looks like most of their new locations, which is to say it's pretty nice inside with lots of HD tvs to watch sports on. As with every opening, the bar was packed and there was a waiting list for the machines. We walked in at 6pm and had to wait a little over half an hour for machines.

My hats off to the Manager (think the name was Amanda, sorry if I got it wrong), who was very friendly and did the best job of handling the wait list of any opening I have seen.

I had two large draft beers (one of which was their house red) before I was able to get a machine. I then played for about 1.5 to 2 hours, averaging over a dollar play the whole time. My wife played as well, and she doesn't drink and just had water. I had two more beers over the course of my play, and we started to say bye to everyone when a bartender reminded us we had a tab.

My bad on forgetting I bought those two beers before I started gambling. I had a good buzz going and am always gambling when I'm at a bar, so I'm used to not having a tab. I apologized and asked for my check. The bartender was a younger Caucasian woman with long black hair (I should have got her name) she hadn't seemed friendly but as busy as they were that's understandable.

So I get a check for over $40, when we didn't have food and I only should have had to pay for two drinks. She tells me I had five beers, and I tell her I had four, only two before I started playing. She then argues with me that it was five. I was buzzed, but not drunk enough to forget how many I'd had. My sober wife also saw how many I had, and even commented when I had my Fourth that she would definitely be driving now.

So she tells me she will only take two beers off for my play and hands me a check for $24. She was pure bad attitude with us and rude. I told her that even if I'd had five beers (which I hadn't) my wife and I had been playing for long enough to justify the comp, and she then told me we didn't have sufficient play. I was floored. The place was packed, and I didn't see the manager anywhere, so we paid and left as we wanted to go to a friends house who lives nearby.

It wasn't until after we left I realized that they were doing happy hour all day, so what's with the $8 a beer on that check? And why would you plan on charging someone for drinks when you saw them gambling consistently? I honestly think that she may have partially mixed me up with another customer since I did change machines at one point. But she was so condescending that I had no want to argue with here over a few dollars. 

If your slammed in an opening, you should be doing your best to make a good impression and realize you can make mistakes. I felt ripped off and will probably email their corporate office on this one. I only gave them a second star because of the nice Manager. Whoever the bartender is that has no customer service skills and ripped me off needs to go.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,5,0,2,oG8vMmciO0zih8vovxAXPQ

The grilled chicken sandwich had zero flavor with fries that were overloaded with salt.   The fish in the Fish n Chips was over-breaded and beyond salty.  I mean pucker your face salty.  The associated fries were too salty and not crisp. The chicken wings were the only bright spot.  They were crispy, hot and properly sauced.  Unfortunately, the fries accompanying the wings were too salty and not crisp.  

During our meal, the server/bartender ended shift and just left.  Not a word from the server or the replacement.  We were sitting there for 15 mins before we realized what happened.  We had to go get our own bill at the bar the new server on shift did not seem interested in much of anything. What a waste of 45 bucks and 90 minutes of our time.
