31867,2015-12-03,0,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,I usually go to the Zupa's in Henderson and always enjoy my experience. The food was good but not the service. I was asked at least twice if someone else's order was mine. They did not have the chocolate covered strawberry and were offering a chocolate covered oreo. I asked the one girl if I could have bread instead and she agreed. The cashier said you do not get bread with a sandwich and tossed my bread back into the basket and I tried to explain and she said there was a charge for bread. I passed. I think in the future I will just go to the one in Henderson.,EeVrJ1_CRHgnH6ZQC-43Ow,1,0,2,j5s1scFmDBVXWejaz6wy1g

We decided to give it a try.  When we arrived at around 1pm the place was packed. That is usually a good sign that the place is good. I couldn't believe the prices. They are very affordable. 7.99 for a sand and soup combo. I ordered the Thai chicken sand and the Wisconsin cauliflower soup. Both were amazing. I also ordered a creme brûlée for 2.99. Also very delicious. I was amazed with the service and the speed of the employees. And not one seemed to be irritated that they were working.

80822,2016-05-09,3,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"My co-workers rave about this place so I stopped in today for lunch. I got there a little before noon so the lunch crowd had not yet reared its ugly head. Still, it was loud in there, so much that I had a hard time ordering my food. The employees across the counter were either not speaking loud enough, or I'm going deaf. They also talked very quickly and I had to ask them to repeat things several times. Also, a small observation for the management. There was a Zupas employee standing at the entrance of the ordering line holding menus. We approached her and assumed she would give us a menu or answer questions. Instead, she instructed us to walk around her and did not offer a menu. There was no one else in line but she wanted us to walk thru the pylons that form the ordering line. It was odd because the employee served absolutely no purpose that I can determine.

After ordering, I went to the restroom and discovered that the low-water use faucet is prone to splash off the sink and got my crotch area nice and wet. So now I've got to walk out with looking like I peed myself a bit. 

I had a cobb salad with chicken that was pretty good and a cauliflower soup that was very good. The portions are decent, maybe a touch small for the price. I'll give Zupas another shot in a few weeks because I'm eager to try the sandwiches. Maybe the manager can ask the staff to talk louder and slower for those us that (apparently) are becoming hard-of-hearing.",NjYwlzI5liKbe6RZWyo96A,2,0,3,n8ss5BxomICDjuP0YZ0mbg

The one thing that turned off our experience was the CUSTOMER SERVICE,- okay let me just say that customer service is very important, if your customer service is poor, there is a risk in revenue for the company. With that being said, i was soooooo disappointed. One of the girls was very rude and i had to explain to each one (more than once) what i had ordered, the girl that was rude to begin with kept questioning what I ordered, as if i was making it up or something, ""are you suuure you ordered that and not this?"" once I had explained to her that ""yes, it was what I ordered"". I had to explain AGAIN what I ordered to the other girl.  I was irritated after that. 

Would I go there again? Maybe at a different time of the day with different workers and see how it goes. Its a shame because the food was terrific, but again the service was ridiculous.",L4HNtjBXRgHb9hJyiGNlUw,2,0,3,eKQzsKSS8XpSKEkQWekFwA

Again, the soup was so salty I couldn't finish it. I asked my husband to try it, thinking it must be me, but no. The chicken sandwich was ok, but the chicken was prepared like chicken salad and had way too much dressing. Finally, I tried the veggie sandwich and it was decent, but nothing interesting. The tortilla soup was another salt bomb, neither I nor a friend could eat it. Perhaps their salads are good but I won't be returning to find out.",uE4mw9Vz5ez0A6F7HguVew,2,0,2,6Q-fQat_I4onR5_m4MK_og

550437,2013-11-09,2,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"I've been here a few times. Once with my family, once with a friend, once alone and once with my sister. Every time I feel like I spent a bit too much. Also, I don't think I've ever left there feeling happy either. It's bright and noisy.  But then again, it is more of a family place. 

They do have their non-negotiable menu. It's simple, it's pretty and everything sounds good. They have their set up assembly line style. Ordering is easy. If you have any troubles, the employees in line will throw out a suggestion or two. I've tried the Crab Avocado Melt, the Turkey Bacon Avocado (I think you can tell that I like avocado) and the Asian BBQ Pork. The Crab and the Turkey were pretty good (they're paninis) but the Asian BBQ Pork is sticky and kind of a pain to eat. It is good, but I'm better off buying a Bahn Mi. Bahn Mis are usually cheaper too. I haven't tried their salads. They didn't seem interesting enough for me. Their soups are never hot, they're always this awkward warm temperature. I'm not sure if they could microwave them, but if I'm paying $7.99 for soup and a sandwich, I'd expect the food to be adequate. I've tried the Lobster Bisque which isn't bad. I've also had their Swiss Onion Soup that's a temporary item. It was good. Another thing is that their soup station was messy. I saw the assembly food line workers chatting amongst themselves, so I'm pretty sure they had time to at least wipe it down. 

With the $7.99 combo, it comes with a slice of cold bread loaf and a chocolate dipped strawberry. Sexy, huh?
Yeah, I guess it could be sexy... Unless you think fruit bugs and leaves are sexy. (Not judging if you are!)
The first issue I had with the strawberries is that there were leaves MELTED IN WITH THE CHOCOLATE. Honestly, how could you miss that?  How can you expect your customers to NOT notice it? Luckily that time, I brought it up and they switched it out. Easy. Done. I didn't even have to ask them to switch it out.
Tonight was another story. After my sister ate her strawberries, she started freaking out because a bug that crawled out of the bag. It was a tiny bug. Like the kinds you find with the berries you didn't wash yet. First, I brought the bag to the cashier. I asked if they wash the berries or if they even inspect them or whatever. She's like, ""Yeah, we wash them. Sorry about that."" in the most ""omg, it's late and I just want to get out of here. It's not my fault you have issues."" attitude ever.  Didn't offer if I want to talk to the manager or anything. That was a problem for me. I'm like, ""okay, thanks I guess.""  I waited for a bit and waited until a busser came by. I told her what happened and she brought out Joe, the manager. Joe explained to me that it's corporate policy that the berries come pre-washed. He said the chocolate wouldn't stick to it otherwise. He then said they would keep an extra eye out when they inspect it in the morning. He offered another dessert or another strawberry, which was nice. We didn't take it, we were a bit grossed out by the bug. 

Yeah, I can say (with a lot of confidence) that we won't be returning there. Ever. Not even if you paid for my meal. If I wanted soup or anything like what they have, Panera Bread is down the street and Sweet Tomatoes isn't far from there either.  If you do go, just watch out for bugs!",SQwzKHogENH6V13032Mikg,4,2,1,4Z-gNKsjjNVl30dQGBbVtw

I liked the selection of sandwiches and soups offered but the food was mediocre. I had the lobster bisque and crab avocado melt. The lobster bisque was 'meh'... a thick flour roux base reminiscent of what you would expect from clam chowder at a street vendor in San Franscisco. Not a huge lobster flavor and not refined by any means.  

The crab avacado melt had the potential to be very good, I mean crab and avacado how can you go wrong, but the bacon overpowered the delicate flavor of the crab. I love bacon, but this was not the time nor the place for bacon to bully it's way in. Other than that the sandwich was good for the price.

If you watch them place the lettuce in your bowl you will find that it is not pre portioned at all, it's just whatever amount of lettuce the server decided to put in your bowl. Prepare to be dissatisfied for paying for a $5 salad that looks like a ration. I've had great experiences at all Zupas up until this visit. Please decrease the price of your salads if you are going to ration the ingredients. And if you are going to ration and claim to give pre prepared amounts, consider actually using a measuring utensil so it is consistent rather than claiming you are giving the allowed amour when previous visits have been quite different.

906758,2017-06-10,6,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"First, I'll just get this out of the way before I go on my rant. The food there is a 6 out of 10. It's ok but nothing to go crazy about. 
Here's where I go crazy. I hate this place! The only reason I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times is because my 11 yr old daughter loves it. Why? I have no clue. Maybe it's because she doesn't have to deal with that complete cluster f**k of a mess when you try to order and the painful process of walking that line all the way to the register. 
So I order my sandwiches at the first stop, then stop 2 is salads and you either order salads or keep moving down the line to soups. Then I stop to give them my soup order and then I'm getting asked what I ordered! Why? You would think maybe so they can hook the correct soup with the correct sandwich. Nope! Not sure why they ask because they're just putting soup bowls on the tray. 
After that, you arrive at the register and they ask you for a 3rd time ""what did you order?"" At which point, I'm about to lose it and freak out on all of them. It's so unorganized and when someone like me orders for the entire family and I have to remember all 6 sandwiches, what soups go with what sandwiches and then I have to repeat it a total of 3 times? Not to mention they rush you and that doesn't help when you're trying to get through the process so you can just sit down and eat. 
You people need to get your act together! I can understand this happening the first couple days of grand opening but by this point, one would think that this place would have streamlined this process! Nope! It's gotten worse as time goes on. 
At this point, I'm willing to bribe my daughter with just about anything up to and including a car for her 16th birthday to prevent having to go to this place again!
If you dare go here after reading these reviews about what a cluster it is, make sure you come armed with Xannax or your medical marijuana cuz you'll need it 10 mins into this circus!
I'll get my soup and sandwiches elsewhere!",axPmaH0Q2yb1Mi5TAt_VgA,4,1,1,yy_gR5aUyIwm1ibJg504jg

975017,2013-07-22,7,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"I have found my new favorite spot!!!  A little over one week new to the area and the word is out!   I have read the great reviews from the one they opened in the Henderson area and was eager to try this place out.  

As we walked in everything was a little overwhelming at first.  Since it is new they had greeters at the front ready to explain their concept and how it all works.  Its all pretty simple - Salad, Soup and/or Sandwich.  A combo includes your choice of 2 for $7.99.  This is similar to the Chipotle style assembly line thing where you tell the servers what you want and they will assemble what you choose.  There is an assorted number of fresh toppings to choose from-meats, cheeses, veges, pastas, nuts, fruits, croutons etc. Better ingredients than any salad bar I've ever been to.  They had a wide range of dressings as well as many fat free and low fat choices which I thought was fantastic!  So you can opt for their salads choices or you can build your own.  If you build your own salad they give your choice of 6 ingredients. You can also choose to add toppings to your soup for $.59.  They have many sandwiches to choose from.  The Ciabatta bread they use is fresh, soft and airy.  

Here's a rundown of what we ordered:

*Asian BBQ Pork sandwich - Very flavorful - BBQ sauce was tasty
*Salad (create your own). Romaine with Sesame Ginger dressing (fat free & amazing flavor), chicken, ground cashews, feta, apples and croutons - this was my favorite overall
*The Italian sandwich - BF really liked the flavor and balsamic spread it had
*Roasted Red Pepper Lobster Bisque - was amazing with a little kick and lobster flakey chunks to compliment (I've been to steak houses that don't have this much lobster)

Each combo came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry.  The drink section has your choices of ""syrups"" to add to your soda.  Recommended recipes are written on the drink cups to give you an idea of how it works.  My BF did the ""rootbeer float"" mixture - 2 squirts of vanilla to your rootbeer.  It was very tasty and was exactly to be expected.  I forgot to mention that had some amazing looking desserts but it was already enough food.  Maybe desserts to-go next time.  BTW you can get any of the food to-go.

The customer service was great.  We were nicely greeted by everyone we came in contact with.  Since its new everyone was on their A game and happy to be there.  I hope that continues.  The place was very clean (new still) and you can tell they spent a lot of time and money on the bright and vibrant décor inside and out.  Its very modern and open with plenty of seating.  They have the recharge bar-but I have no idea what that was about yet.

As we were indulging in our new found favorite food stop we were already planning on coming back the next day.  So as we drove up on Sunday our hearts sank - CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.  Wah wah waahhh.  Sad face.  No worries.  I intend to be back ALOT just not on Sunday..",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,11,7,5,EmOEK-neHHa539tyR4PxiQ

1076527,2013-08-04,0,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"Fast food Panera.  We were lured here with the mailers and promise of 50% off the entire check.  We had the crab soup, clam chowder, and tomato soup.  All were spot-on with flavors and not overly salty or watered down.  The Asian pork sandwich was a winner.  It had a hint of heat and the cilantro really brightened up the sandwich.  The Thai sandwich and the crab avocado were adequate and not terribly special.  

We loved the idea of flavoring your own drinks with the syrups they had at the drink station but noticed you need a lot of squirts to really flavor the tea.  I like the option, though.  The ice-makers were having a hard time keeping up with the crowd, which, I assume, were just kinks from opening days of service.

The staff was efficient and the management must be given kudos for moving the crowd along fairly quickly.  I don't suppose they will keep that many staff on hand in the coming weeks and months, so I will be curious to see if they can keep up with busy service.  I like that they have placards on the tables imploring customers to not save a seat as the tables turn over quickly.  Once you're done getting your food, it makes it easier to find a table fast.

This place was slightly cheaper than Panera but without the comfort of one.  Still, I've been a little annoyed with paying Panera prices lately, so this is quite a decent alternative.  The food is comparable, and I will come back again soon.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,0,0,4,7g-UuVBJ7RwYFTyVZZFC1w

They offer three item-types: salads, sandwiches, and soups and you can buy each as an entree or buy 1/2 of 2 items to make a meal (e.g., 1/2 salad and 1/2 soup, 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich). They also offer truly delectable desserts.

The ingredients are fresh and the food good; the beverage bar is excellent. The bar includes all the regular soda fountain items and has Torani syrups you can add on your own. In addition, they offer several natural drink options like cucumber green tea and citrus-infused water. With every meal, you receive a piece of bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry. 

The place is always impeccably clean in the restaurant and bathroom. They bus the tables and regularly ask if you need anything (like boxes). 

The reason I don't like Zupas as much as other places is that the food does not fill me. Even when asking for extra lettuce on a salad (including if I pay extra for lettuce), there isn't much. I need lots of lettuce to fill me and even buying two full salads is barely enough. Instead, I go to Cafe Rio across the street because they will pile on the lettuce if you ask. Also, they do not offer bread bowls for their soups so I go to Panera down the street instead.

They offer syrups with the soda machine, but good luck making an italian soda because they won't give you half and half. I want to be clear, it's not that they don't have half and half, they do (I saw 6 gallons in the kitchen just from where I was standing in line) and they will not give it to you at any price. If they are unwilling to provide something so simple as a mere ounce of half and half when they have plenty, you can only imagine what else they won't do.

Their grand opening offer was good August 1st-3rd, however, the postcard didn't arrive until Saturday and since we were out for several hours, didn't get the mail until too late to use it.  Whoever they used for marketing screwed up.  Our office has ordered lunch a few times from the Eastern location and it was great in the beginning but the last salad did not seem fresh or flavorful.  Since I live near the new Lake Mead location, I was hoping to see if it might be better and would have loved to use the offer since it was a good one.  But doesn't do residents much good if not mailed timely.

The reason i gave them only 4 out of five is because YOU need to remember what you ordered and if its crazy or you have a large party it can get confusing. Theres a combo option which is less than 8 but make sure you get that size or your order will be more pricy. I also disliked that they are closed on Sundays...

I also got the Sea Salt Caramel Creme Brulee and, while it's not a true creme brulee, it's decadent.  I could only eat a small bit of that, though, due to the intense sweetness of the caramel.  Hubs didn't mind ;)

He got the Honey Cilantro Carnitas with Tomato Basil soup on the first visit and the Italian Club sandwich with a German Sausage soup on the 2nd.

As a vegan you would think a soup and salad place would be a good choice.  The portions are tiny and not very filling.  They have so many employees, it didn't seem efficient.  The portion scoops for your custom built salad yielded a serving size comparable to a teaspoon. When you ask for more they charge you or use another of your 6 inclusive toppings scoops. The prices were decent for the portions. Service wasn't memorable, which is to be expected at $10 a plate. Probly won't return, considering the all you can eat salad bar at sweet tomatoes is relatively commensurate as far as produce quality, yet boasts more options. The one vegan Soup was great, a little salty, but not unbearable. The wilted and soggy lettuce was a bit of a turn off, but too insignificant to warrant complaining.

My boyfriend choose the crab sandwich . He wasn't a fan of the intimation crab. ( we knew it wasn't going to be real crab , expectation wasn't high) Just wasn't his cup of tea. The soup he choose was the tomato soup. Which is highly recommended here. He wasn't a fan of that either. It has other veggies in it too. But he said there was just too many  flavors in it.

Two stars for lack of availability of nutritional information- from a widespread chain that should have this information readily available.

I'm on a health kick and have had this place bookmarked for a while. This location is close to my work, and I viewed their online menu to make my selections prior to going. I track calories and ran into extreme difficulty trying to get any info at all on this- none on their company website, a few dishes with info around the web, but all with unusually high numbers considering the dish descriptions.

Ultimately opted for the crab avocado melt sandwich combo with the cup of mushroom bisque- love how you can sample soups before ordering. Considering I got info that the particular sandwich was nearly 900 calories, I only ate half.
Appreciated the gesture of including a slice of bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry dessert with my combo, which was well-priced at under $9 with tax and did not ask for a tip on the receipt.

Food was tasty, but sandwich was underwhelming considering the calories I was lead to believe I was ""paying"" for it. Soup was damn delicious though. Would go back for a soup and salad combo.

Seriously though- make your nutritional information available online and in stores (even if it's a brochure behind the counter by request!). Given the number of food allergies and the healthy image projected here, this should be expected.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,1,3,weSLF0p2YDXNiVUPMW3MfA

Both paninis were fantastic, with a great mix of textures and flavors, blending crispy crust with chewy fillings, savory meat with sweet accents.

The Lobster Bisque I think suffers from too many chunks of ""stuff"" - carrots, tomatoes, celery, onion; it takes away from the lobster bisque as a whole, and I find the simplicity of the Roasted Red Pepper & Lobster Bisque to be superior.

The Chicken Enchilada Chili is very flavorful, but also very heavy. A bit too heavy, personally, but very hearty as a result.

I noticed the bill was MUCH higher than usual and noticed that for a bowl of soup that has bacon and cheese included in menu description (which I have purchased in past at standard price) now listed everything other than the soup as an add on. so it was 1.50 more per bowl. I had a panini and when I picked it up I noticed there was no bread on the bottom of the sandwich. it appeared that it stuck to the grill but they served it any way. The manager was too busy to discuss it so I argued with rude girl at counter glad when second location near me opens so don't have to go back here.,mJnu3URfIqmBqXi6NtfC3g,0,0,1,MTRdUFxaIoCQ57bBZmmsuA

2206258,2014-03-16,0,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"The Skinny: similar to Panera bread, this joint features overly sweet food and not that great bread (3) service: good, counter service, nothing special (3) value: it's okay, nothing special.

The hubs dragged me here to try out this joint.

We each ordered a combo - I ordered the Chinese chicken salad with tomato soup and the hubs ordered a half sammy with the cream of mushroom soup. Each combo comes with a huge hunk of generic tasting sourdough bread that is pretty unappetizing and stone cold. Oyster crackers are available for the soup. 

My Chinese chicken salad tasted alright - it wasn't anything special. They were really light on the amount of protein served in this chicken salad. I tried the tomato soup which was really really sweet. I don't think I would order that again.

The hubs ordered the Asian BBQ pork sandwich which was again too sweet and overly sauced. The filling is minimal and the bread is really nothing special. I kind of don't like the bread - the weird overly doughy firm bread is not to my taste. Call me crazy but I think I prefer the yoga-mat chemical laced Subway bread better than the bread they use here. It really isn't all that.

I think the chocolate strawberry was the best thing that came with our meals.

The cool thing that they do have here is the different Italian syrups in their beverage station so you can customize your drink into something new. That is really cool.

Given the quality of their product, I'm not sure if I need a repeat experience. I really wanted to love it, but their food is too sweet and I'm not really a fan of their bread. If there was no where else to go and I was in the middle of nowhere, yeah, I'd give this place another shot. However being located next to all these other great little eateries, I think I'll pass on this joint. 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,1,1,3,SLYaLEBrc14JXMbDEq1-jA

They have sandwiches, salads, soups, and desserts a la carte or you can opt for a combo which includes 2 of the following: whole sandwich, half soup, or half salad. I typically opt for a combo with a sandwich and salad, but it's always hard for me to decide because there's quite a laundry list of options. I've tried getting something different each time and so far my favorite salad is the BBQ chicken and all the sandwiches I've had are so good I wouldn't be able to choose a favorite...the turkey bacon avocado or ham bacon club are pretty tasty though.

No matter what you order every meal includes a chocolate dipped strawberry and slice of french bread on the side. They also have desserts including the chocolate dipped strawberries for sale a la carte. Service here is wonderful and we are always greeted before getting into line. The greeter will usually offer you a paper menu but you could always just look up at the menu board if you're close enough in line. Even when it gets packed here there seems to be plenty of seating.

2662712,2014-09-05,6,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"5 stars for the soups
3 stars for the sandwiches 

Whenever I eat here, the lobster bisque and the wild mushroom bisque are a must. The consistency of both soups are always perfect - thick, very luscious and creamy. They are also slightly sweet, richly decadent, packed with quality ingredients and incredible flavor.

On the other hand, I'm not too crazy about their sandwiches. I haven't found a sandwich that that blew away my tastebuds yet. Their sandwich options are unique, but they are also lacking the body of flavor and substance that would typically impress me - they are all so dry and bland.

SOUPS:
- Lobster Bisque - I am seriously addicted to this soup! Plus, I love the generous chunks of vegetables swimming in the soup, it makes for a satisfying and comforting meal in itself. 5/5
- Wild mushroom bisque - This is another winning soup. The wild mushroom flavor is extremely complex and savory. You can really taste the earthiness and nuttiness of the wild mushrooms in every sip. 5/5
- Tomato bisque - Slightly tart, slightly sweet and very comforting. This is a great choice with grilled cheese. 4/5

SANDWICHES: 
- Honey Cilantro Carnitas - the pulled pork was moist, but it is also pretty bland and not seasoned properly. Also, the honey cilantro glaze sounds amazing, but it didn't have a pleasant taste to it - it tasted like processed ingredients and chemicals (even though they advertised it to be ""house-made"") The sandwich filling: cabbage, non-existent pickled red onion and bread were also very dry and not memorable. 3/5
- BBQ Pulled Pork - they used the same pulled pork as in the carnitas sandwich above - so the meat was moist, but bland. I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce that they used. The sauce didn't have any bold, sweet, or tangy flavor - it was too basic and generic. The overall filling and flavor was very dry and boring. 2/5
- Pesto Chicken Panini - the pesto flavor was extremely weak and the chicken was very plain. The overall panini was dry and bland. 2/5
- Crab Avocado Melt Panini - my boyfriend enjoyed this one the most. The crab flavor isn't strong, possibly because they used imitation crab? But the avocado made the sandwich creamy and the bacon added a necessary saltiness. 3/5

This is a dependable lunch spot and I hope I find a sandwich I'm crazy about soon. I love that they stand out in a crowd of sandwich shops by giving away complimentary chocolate covered strawberries! A sweet treat is always appreciated at lunch.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,8,6,4,AaR2O76PBizo5DbEhM7x5A

The ambiance felt very much like a cafeteria or even like a food court in a mall. Really busy, but wasn't too distracting.

All they have on their menu is soups, salads, sandwiches & few desserts. All look really delicious and somewhat on the healthier side. If you wanted you can choose to get a full sandwich w/ soup, sandwich w/ salad, or salad w/ soup for about $8. Which is a pretty darn good deal.

I opted for the crab avocado panini with roasted red pepper lobster bisque. I love lobster & I love crab so I was one happy little girl! The meal was the perfect portion.

My favorite thing is the lobster bisque soup (mushrooms bisque is a runner up). If you are in the mood for something on a cold day or something to just warm the soul I would highly suggest it. All the sandwiches are good but the salads get a bit old and they can sometimes run out of things that are suppose to go in your salad. For instance I ordered the chicken chop salad but they ran out of tomatoes. What is a salad without tomatoes?! nonetheless it was still good. If you don't mind a packed cafe restaurant with a lot of hustle and bustle but good food highly recommend this place. Oh and did I mention affordability; my meals are always under $15 and it is a very filling hearty meal. Usually take home leftovers! Only suggestion is that they are quicker at clearing off and cleaning tables.

The mushroom soup, for example, is a bowl of cream. Perhaps if you are lucky they'll actually give you a single mushroom.

Everything was rapid fire but the answers to our questions generated crickets. The staff was absolutely ignorant on whether a salad dressing was vegan or not. They couldn't even suggest which dressings could be substituted.  

I asked for a sample of the roasted veggie soup which was vegan. It was so salty and overwhelmed the flavor of the soup. I asked the employee if they had a cup soup size. She took forever to answer me and was very vague mentioning a child size soup. There were other employees but she didn't ask them. I replied that it was just as well.

We were rushed through the line and they weren't busy. Perhaps the employees wanted more time to shoot the breeze? Hmmmm.......

We found a perfect place to eat after paying a whopping $29.00+. Zupas doesn't offer a military, student, senior discount,  etc.  It's what I deem true greed. I realize it's a business however they would still make a profit even if they offered a 10% discount. 

The meal- my Thai coconut tofu protein salad. Where is all my protein?! There was perhaps an infant's handful size of tofu, some edamene not much, lots of kale, quinoa, a few slices of English cucumber and too much dressing.  My husband's sandwich was good and his soup was ok. The cake was a good size but overpriced of course. The chocolate dipped strawberries were the best part.

Another irritating aspect of Zupas was the lack of calorie and nutritional information.  I asked for this info because I log my meals on my fitness pal. Some employee blithely answered that ""they might get that info in a few months."" This one employee provided a Greek chorus by apologizung for every little thing.  I say keep your info, keep your food and keep your apologies because we will be eating somewhere else.

On first glance it might seem just like Panera but as the folks at Cafe Zupas will tell you, everything made fresh, including the soups which are made from scratch on the premises daily. The food is a step up from the majority of fast-casual eateries. The Asian BBQ pork sandwich is reminiscent of a banh mi with its flavors and the size is great for the price ($7.99 for a whole sandwich and small soup combo). The lobster bisque was full of potatoes, vegetables, and other goodness but lacked lobster. I only counted two or three small chunks.

The kid's menu was disappointing. While my kid liked the chicken strips (2 per order), they were rather small and unimpressive looking. The kid's meal requires them to choose 2 of the four options (chicken strips, soup, grilled cheese, or fruit) but they're not allowed to double up on a single item (like 2 orders of chicken). My kid didn't like the texture of the bread for the grilled cheese and I knew he wouldn't touch the soup or fruit. So, on future visits it looks like he'll only eat half of what we pay for. 

Desserts were highlights of the meal. The chocolate cake was plenty rich and we loved the different layers and textures of cream, cake, fudge, and crust. The chocolate hazelnut creme brulee was more like a pudding with it's creamy texture, but was good nonetheless. Each meal also comes with a chocolate covered strawberry.

Prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly and informative.

- Half Soup
- Half Salad

The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a ""Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup"" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the ""Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake"" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,33,25,5,qfj71H7XGgoEKVJfAWuKXA

The food is good, I have never ordered anything that I didn't like and there is a good variety of choices for pescatarians and vegetarians. 

Don't be scared off by the long lines, they move very quickly. You order your food and pay, deli style, and it keeps everything moving. They have a good variety of drink options and flavored syrups to add to the sodas, as well.

It's a good place to go for lunch, with kids, that isn't the typical fast food place. My kids will take take the chocolate covered strawberries at Zupas over a happy meal toy, any day.",Wvox6LO8VKmSS9ym9PEazw,0,0,5,3Obo3UEM90tTyBKKv6q_0g

There was a line out the door for one reason-50% off your bill....WHAT!?!?!? Luckily the line moved swiftly and I was already in attack mode! Their system is quick, easy, and painless:

1) Order your salads and sandwiches
2) Order your soups(toppings are additional charge)
3)Order desserts and drinks....pay for your order

After you pay for your order, a worker is waiting at the end of the line offering to take your tray to your table for you!?!? Oh, and each order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry, so if you choose not to get a dessert, you still end your meal with something sweet....:)

Here's what we got:
Nuts About Berries Salad
Berry Mango Salad
BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich
Crab and Avocado Panini
Cauliflower Soup
Lobster Bisque
Rocky Road Brownie
Salted Caramel Crème Brulee

Everything was tasty, and the price for all this???? Just over $13 dollars!
Great for the kids too, and Zupas won't break the bank either. Another unheard of thing is that they DO NOT accept tips AND they will clean up after you too!

I ordered my usual a large create your own with mangos, strawberries, blueberries and a double serving of cinnamon almonds. I wasn't watching the guy make my salad but it looked a little light on the lettuce. The lettuce usually fills the 3 compartments of the to-go box. While I was asking for an extra mango dressing,  I couldn't get over the lack of lettuce, so I finally said that it looked a little light and could I please have more. 2 girls looked at each other then told him that I wanted more lettuce. He said that, THAT was the serving as he continued to wipe up around the lettuce container, but made no movement to add more. It gave me the feeling that he personally harvested that lettuce and he didn't want to part with it. Finally 1 of the girls put about 6 extra pieces of the shredded lettuce in my box.

I was so upset about the ridiculousness of it all, I didn't realize my 2nd dressing wasn't in there. While I was getting napkins, 1 of the girls from the line brought me a large dressing cup barely half filled. She told me they had ran out of the mango dressing, but ""here's what's left"". So you mean to tell me that at 1:30 in the afternoon they have COMPLETELY run out of dressing? After the lettuce fiasco, I feel that it's more likely that they wanted to be stingy with their dressing as well.

I'm glad that this isn't the 1st Cafe Zupas that I've visited. It would likely be the last time that i gave them my business. Do better 7521 Lake Mead location!",mSc9Mhe6ye6aHgGSaK2Bkw,1,0,1,fsi-g9lQdcPWoj9RdSpUQQ

A friendly greeter meets you at the door and since this was our first time eating here it was helpful to have some guidance.  She made some recommendations based on ""popular"" selections but we went our way.  My only complaint was that the dining room was freezing! It was warmer outside and it was 59 degrees that day! Turn the heat up during these chilly days please!

Honestly I'm not a fast-food soup person...I'm a total Soup-Snob. I've been to Sweet Tomatoes (bland) I've been to Panera (not impressed). I like my soup tasty hot and full of flavor. I prefer to have it at my favorite white linen tablecloth restaurant cafe or bistro. But, I have to say... I was pleasantly surprised with our order.

Trying to choose a combination lunch here was like trying to choose between chocolate covered strawberry's or creme brûlée...hmmm tough decision.  Oh, and by the way, both are served here for dessert.  And the strawberries come with the combo meal.  Yipee!  I told you this place was awesome.

We had a lunch combo which lets you order soup or sandwich or soup and salad.  I had the roasted red pepper lobster bisque with the mango berry salad- and the hubby ordered the cream of mushroom with fried onions and a avocado turkey bacon panini...oh my goodness, can you say a contender for my last meal on earth? Soup was hot spicy and fabulous.  Sandwich was warm, crispy and tasty. We shared every bite and I suggest you bring a few friends and do the same.

Upon arriving at the new Cafe Zupas location (next to that yummy Pinkbox Donuts), imagine my surprise...BUSY!  PACKED!  Line out the friggin' door and almost around the building.  Come on Zupas....thought that flyer was only meant for ME!?  Apparently not.  Half of Las Vegas was at Zupas on this lovely afternoon.  Probably waiting in anticipation for me to arrive.  But most likely not.  But...maybe.

Cafe Zupas serves house-made soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I do like me a good sandwich.  This Utah chain boasts good food at good prices.  I'm happy to say the prices for their eats are more reasonable than aforementioned places like Panera Bread (got I hate going there for the mere fact everything is overpriced), and the now closed Atlanta Bread Company (which I kinda liked).  You know me, if it's cheap then I'm down.  But it's gotta taste at least somewhat good.

The line for the day was long, but it went rather quickly.  Cafe Zupas is kinda like a cafeteria, order on down the line, pay at the end.  It was nice that everything looked fresh and not frozen, and your food wouldn't be made until you ordered it (unless it's a soup of course).  Very, very reasonable prices at Zupas, a large bowl of soup runs $6, a half order $4, sandwiches are $5 each, and salads run $7 for a large, a half for $5.  Desserts run for around $3 - $4 each, and there's a kid's meal combo for only $4.

But the best deal on the menu is probably the Try 2 Combo for $8, and you get two choices of soup & salad, salad & sandwich, or sandwich & soup.  Your selections can be from anything on the menu.  Very nice if this is your first time to Cafe Zupas, gives you some options to try a bit of everything.  This is what our family stuck with, four of the Try 2 Combos.  We had:

-New England Clam Chowder
-Nuts About Berries Salad
-MangoBerry Salad
-Shanghai Chicken Salad
-Crab Avocado Melt Panini
-Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich
-California Turkey Sandwich
-Italian Club Sandwich

Food?  Not bad for a healthy lunch!  Salads were full of fresh fruits and veggies, especially the berry salad.  The crab panini was very good, grilled and gooey.  The big surprise though was the Asian BBQ pork sandwich, it tasted like a bahn mi!  If it was on French bread it would have been killer!  That is my main gripe about Cafe Zupas - no choice of bread.  All they have are ciabatta buns.  I love ciabatta buns but it depends what kind of filling is in between.  Ciabatta goes great with the Italian Club, the bun just sops up the fat lovely from meats like salami.  If Zupas had another choice of bread it would be stellar.  Maybe a ciabatta OR a French roll?  But I know you gotta keep food costs down.  

Overall a great lunch.  Like how if you order soup you get a chunk of French bread for dipping, and with each order you get a chocolate covered strawberry.  Very chic, making me feel like I'm at some fancy bistro.  I did the corner of the vast array of hot sauces, I do enjoy a good kick!  I also like how Zupas serves Coca-Cola products!  Also very cool of them to have a section for Italian syrups so you can create your own Italian soda!  But guys, you need to have some cream or half & half on the side to complete this.

I got away super CHEAP for lunch on grand opening.  With the 50% off special, for our orders, drinks, and a little dessert, the tab was just over $20!  We had some leftovers for later too.  That's cheaper than going to the local Buffet @ Asia.  Just too bad the 50% off wasn't everyday!  Not a bad deal even at regular price for this type of food and atmosphere.  Workers were very friendly and helpful, even on a super busy grand opening day.

The amount of sugar that is in the homemade dressings have a ton of sugar in it like about 6 cups of sugar for one batch on dressing that is sick no dressing should have that much in it, also all the salt in the soup is a extensive amount  which is not necessary. I ate only half a small bowl and I got so dizzy I felt so sick and I am a healthy person. They also have no calorie chart to count your intake of calories in each dish. The manager that I tried to talk to at this location was dismissive when I asked why is the soup so watery her responses was it was made this morning when I got there 12:34 PM. so giving any kind of constructive criticism wasn't in the cards. The manager's name is Alisha she was not only rude but rolled her eyes when talking to her in line. The other 2 employee's that I spoke to apologized for her actions. I told them that was not necessary that it was not there fault for her actions. I asked some employee's if they ate here at Zupas they said they will never eat the food because of how much sugar and salt was in it! Shame! They also said the manager there is always dismissive often and they have to work with a person like that and they said again sorry for her actions. They told me to contact district manager for her being that way. His name is Lyle. The only high light was I got to meet a news anchor from channel 8.  So if you want to eat healthy this is not the place for you SUGAR SUGAR SUGAR PLUS SALT SALT AND MORE SALT. NO CALORIE COUNTER CHART! If you need a sugar salt rush and want to feel like you want to die for that day ha-ha go here. Hope this is helpful to the wise.

I'm generally a person who always orders the same thing anywhere I go. I like to stick with what I know I'll enjoy when I go out. Here at Zupas that's not the case, there's always 4 or 5 different things I want to try, so I'm usually trying something new or a new combination of something I like. Plus every meal comes with a chocolate covered strawberry which is a nice little treat.

All the salads are super yummy (although the dressing is a little heavy-handed sometimes), most of the soups are addicting (try their chunky lobster bisque or creamy, Wisconsin cauliflower), and I really love their ultimate grilled cheese or chicken pesto sandwiches (anything with pesto!).

I was very disappointed with the crab melt sandwich. To me, it was just gross, so I'd never get that again. Everything else I've had there is great, including the desserts. Gotta love the chocolate dipped strawberries that come with every meal.

My two-year-old loves their chicken strips that come with a little side of fruit and bread. He's not really into food, but when we go to Zupas, he digs right in! Great place for kids.",nIDJ59yXOj9I8qmfKuFzJQ,2,1,4,K9tOegBbzMMIrOz2SiCqgg
4312346,2017-07-05,6,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"I had high expectations for this place because of the review my cousin left for it, the fact that my aunt (who prefers homemade stick to your bones and thighs soul food to any other kind) loves this place, and my mom kept ranting and raving. And they delivered!

While large franchises are nice because of convenience in numerous locations, I truly appreciate the unique quality of smaller ones. Per the website, this restaurant operates in Arizona, Idaho, Minnesota, Nevada, and Utah. The ""coming soon"" locations do not detail any in California so I guess I just have to eat at this establishment when I go visit the family in Vegas...

Any place that lets me try ALL possible samples and doesn't make me feel like I am holding up the line or need to hurry is automatically ranked high in my book! The service I've received during each of my visits to this (or any) Cafe Zuppa's has been on point. I like that the bar has everything laid out for me to see so I can create extra special custom sammiches.

The vegetarian soup is really good! It was salty. Sista likes salt.

They give you a chocolate dipped strawberry with your order. That's okay, I guess. Many would call that a nice touch, but I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate strawberries so I would rather them not charge a fee for adding ANYthing, like onions. Like almost a dollar! Keep the strawberry and give me breath-stank! If I remember correctly, they charge almost a one dollar to add a very small amount of ""extra"" to any soup or sandwich. I'm not trying to put anyone out of business, but a dollar for onions? I add and pay for enough of all kinds of other stuff to pay four quarters for that, in my opinion.

BUT the food is yummy, is fresh, and there is no place like this near home I have found in Cali. So four stars, it is...

Ordering was a little overwhelming. I felt rushed and while it is lunch hour, I was frazzled with making quick decisions. Guacamole on your salad counts as TWO sides. But it's one tiny scoop. Disappoint. 

Anyway, ordered a Turkey Bacon Avocado Sandwich without bacon. (don't judge me.) and a create your own salad that I would've liked to add an egg to but like I said they're very rushed. 

So, ate my food. And I can't same I'm too impressed. The salad is a salad is a salad. Sandwich was soggy. And didn't taste as great as I had hoped. It was like eating sandwich meat from the grocery store. 

Chocolate covered strawberry was nice.  Bread was weird. Soft but dry and needing something.

The Try 2 combo for $8 is probably your best bet with a choice of a full sandwich, a full salad, or a bowl (not cup) of soup. They have a big menu of options, or you can build your own (at least for the salads - maybe not the sandwiches). I've had about four different sandwiches, two salads, and tried four or five soups. It's all CRAZY good, and filling.

Along with your order, you get a piece of french bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. LOVE IT. They have desserts, too, and they are also super good. The salted caramel creme brulee is my favorite, and it's good to combine with a brownie (ultimate fat kid status right here). Even the drink bar has flavored syrups to jazz up your soda or tea. 

On top of high quality, tasty food, the staff is really friendly. They're so nice, they make In & Out employees look like jerks, which says a lot. I've only been to the Lake Mead & Buffalo location (there's one also off Eastern), but with how good this place is, I'd imagine they're all on point.

During the week they close too early for us (9:00 p.m.), and on weekends I usually like a place with sit-down service and a bar.  But we were nearby when we started thinking about a quick dinner, and it was earlier than we usually eat.

I chose a combo, the turkey spinach artichoke panini, with a cherry balsamic half-salad, but I had them substitute cranberries for the dried cherries.  My +1 got a turkey avocado bacon, along with a large Yucatan chicken tortilla soup.  We took the tray to the back room, but the many available booths all had dirty tables, so we sat at a regular table.  

My husband's soup bowl was only half-full.  Oh, it had a lot of stuff in it, and way too many tortilla strips, but jeez, how much does the broth cost?  I suggested he go back and ask for more broth.  To their credit they didn't add to the bowl, but gave him an additional bowl that had almost as much as the first one, so I got to have some, too.  It had a lot of chicken, along with corn, onions, tomatoes, and a dollop of guacamole.  It could have used more spice and fewer tortilla strips, but was very tasty and a whole lot lighter than their cream soups.

We decided to share the sandwiches, and they were both very good, but I liked mine better.  Duh, that's why I ordered it, so what was I thinking??

By the time I finished the soup and my half-sandwich I was full, so I took the salad home, knowing that I'd be hungry later from having eaten too early and staying up too late.  The half-salad was enough to share between the two of us for a snack.  Fresh salad, grapes, goat cheese, and nuts - yum!  The balsamic dressing was very thick and too sweet, so I'd get a different dressing next time.

The chocolate-covered strawberry and the baguette slice are a nice additional touch, and both have been saved for future noshing.  Another nice touch is the availability of Italian soda flavorings for adding to fountain drinks.  We didn't partake, because all I ever drink is coffee and booze ;)  We never get soda at places like this.

I'll definitely return to Zupa's.  It's great for fresh food at decent prices, with quick service.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,0,3,RhcpIBUVzqOOcaBjLF2_Og

I really like the location. It is really close to the corner of Buffalo/Lake Mead and there is lots of shopping in that area. This will be a great lunch spot if you're in that area.

When you walk in, you grab a menu, and once you decide (they will give you samples if you need help) you jump in line and order. Think upscale cafeteria! There are lots of soups, salads, and sandwiches to choose from. I was surprised at the of the menu because I was expecting it to be a very plain Jane menu. It wasn't! We ordered a BBQ pulled pork, a turkey cranberry, and chicken enchilada chili. All were delicious. 

I really wanted dessert, but I resisted. They had amazing looking brownies and crème brulees! Every order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry!!

After you pay, you take your tray and seat yourself. They have an area with different syrups that you can add into your soda or ice tea, but I didn't try them. I thought it was a nice touch, though and it is free.

But, (and that's a big but)....I had a bad overall experience there tonight. We tried to take our family through the order line, but it was just too chaotic with all of the different options. They screwed up two out of the four kids meals and one had to wait for her food for nearly ten minutes after we had started eating. The staff seemed overwhelmed and let other people through the line in front of us. Also, the staff were getting after each other because there were a couple of other large groups all together and orders weren't being put together correctly. I hate to see this kind of stuff going on when I am out to dinner.

The Food: To me, most of the soups taste similarly....not like they are bad, but it really seems like they are all based on the same cream base with just a different theme. Also, the salads all seem very similar. Greens, berries, nuts, etc-just different nationalities assigned to each one. Not bad at all, but they are all just different green salads. Sandwiches: The first time I went there (sans kids) I got a pesto chicken panini and it was good-that's it.

There are a lot of problems with the ordering line. Just getting through the hassle of the line is bad enough, but my kids' food was not right (I think they actually screwed up my order about five different ways), they added some else's order to my bill and then some lady came up to the register and totally interrupted",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,4,0,1,ppstG6HTXAkVA7vUV6f7YA

My salad was great though, and I got both the soup and salad in a combo for just $7.99 and it included bread and a chocolate covered strawberry! You can't beat that price! 
The Cherry Coke wasn't working but they made up for it with a syrup bar where you can flavor your soda with whatever flavor you want, so that made up for not having Cherry Coke.

Being a vegetarian, sometimes it's hard to find good vegetarian food at restaurants and most of the time they don't have a vast selection, so most of the time if a food item isn't good, I just won't go back, because there will be nothing else to try. 
The veggie sandwich that they have set up on the menu is pretty gross to me, but my friend orders it with avocado + grilled on panini instead and it tasted like 200% better!(Seriously get it that way if you go there) 
I like the set up of this restaurant to where they can change up the way items are made fairly easy to accommodate everyone's tastes.

I also had some clam chowder. Salty and thin. When I think of clam chowder I think thick, creamy and nice pieces of clams. Barely any clams could be found and flavor was overly salty. Do not recommend it at all. 
Very disappointing.
Meal came with a piece of bread and chocolate strawberry. Only the front half of the strawberry was actually covered in chocolate but I mean of course it was good.
Decided to also try chocolate cake because it looks good. It looks good but wasn't good. The cake parts were ok but the ""mousse"" was hard. Didn't taste good at all, was kind of crumbly when I tried to get a bite on my fork.

I wasn't planning on going anywhere since my original plan for lunch fell through the cracks. I got kidnapped and got taken here and I'm glad I gave this place a try finally since my cousin has been raving about this place.  I could compare this experience with when I first discovered Forever 21 during my Ralph Lauren Big Pony and True Religion phase. Wait wait wati! You mean something good doesn't have to be expensive?!

We were walking in and we were greeted by Rae with her friendly smile. She asked us if it was our first time and she told us about the food and the ordering process which was very helpful. She said their best-sellers for soup are tomato basil, lobster bisque and chicken enchilada chili. Everyone at the counter taking our order, making our food and working the register were wonderful and friendly. 

Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich:
Roasted Pork with cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, chili-lime spread and Korean BBQ sauce. I honestly wanted to try this but was expecting to get disappointed. Well, I'm disappointed about not being disappointed! The pork and the sweet BBQ sauce reminds me of the sweet filling of a Chinese BBQ pork bun. The cucumber, carrots, cilantro and chili-lime spread gave this sandwich a Vietnamese hint. 5/5

Crab Avocado Melt:
Crab salad, bacon, avocado, red onions, tomatoes, celery and muenster cheese. It sounds like there's too much going on with the crab, avocado and bacon and I hate celery but it's actually pretty good. 5/5

Losbter Bisque:
We had to fight over who's going to order this. But we decided on sharing. This is not the best lobster bisque I've ever had but considering the price of the meal and where I'm getting it from, it's absolutely good. 5/5

Wild Mushroom Bisque:
Crimini, button and shiitake mushrooms. I LOVE mushrooms and mushroom soup is one of my favorite comfort foods. Great flavor, texture and consistency. Not too watery and not too thick...just right. 5/5

Chocolate-Dipped Strawberry:
The strawberry I got was tart...and I seriously love tart fruits. Must be my lucky  day! This was free and anything good tastes even better when free. 5/5

Salted Caramel Creme Brulee:
As the name implies: creme brulee with salted caramel (on top). The caramel is extremely sweet and thick. We tried finishing this but just couldn't. 2/5

Chocolate Hazelnut Creme Brulee:
Don't expect this to taste like Nutella. This creamy dessert tastes like chocolate with a very mild hint of hazelnut and has candied hazelnut bits on top. It's only $3 though. 3/5

I may have found my perfect spot for quick lunches.  $5 for a sandwich or half a salad, $3-10 for dessert, $8 for a combo (includes your choice of half a soup/ half a salad/ sandwich). You get a free chocolate-dipped strawberry if you order a salad/ sandwich. It's way better than fast-food burgers and whatever which I don't eat.

Several Cafe Zupas have popped up around town. After a night of Vegas debauchery, I decided to get something chock full of nutrients. 

Walking in the place was super clean, but really didn't have ambience or a theme. There was plenty of seating with multiple 4 person tables and a few booths.

Getting in line, I saw there was a pick 2 combo. There were selections of sandwiches, salads, and soups. I ordered the crab avocado panini and since it is getting cold out opted for some soup. There were so many soups to choose from, before I had to settle and pick one, I was given as many samples as I wanted. I fell in love, over and over, and decided on the chicken enchilada chili which was nothing like a traditional chili at all. It was divine and I need to get more of it in my life. The cauliflower soup was amazing as was the lobster bisque. 

I didn't order any, but they have a slew of fresh baked treats, a million dollar bar, s'mores brownies, cakes, and all sorts of treats that probably would have knocked my socks off. 

I paid for much lunch, then took the goods to go. Once I got hole, I saw that my order came with fresh baked bread and 2 chocolate covered strawberries. Nice AND delicious touch.


Zupas was a pleasant surprise. Fast, casual, friendly service and axon fly fresh, wholesome food. The atmosphere on the actually restaurant isn't anything special, it is similar to Panera Bread, but not quite. I can't see myself ever dining in. I will however be taking my order to go.

5390846,2013-12-07,2,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"Betrayed my beloved Panera for a visit to Zupas the other day.   It was tough to do because I enjoy the combos of soups, sandwiches, and salads so much at Panera that it was hard for me to picture anything being better.   Well that and the fact that if I greeted her with another cafe's breadcrumbs on my face and my odor being that of Wisconsin Cauliflower soup, well she might not ever take me back.

The decor and ambiance were pretty lacking here in my opinion, and it didn't scream warm and inviting in the least, but rather cold and factory like.  A helpful employee instructed myself and a coworker on the ordering process and we went down the assembly line making our choices.   I found it a little chaotic as a first-timer but I'm sure it would improve with each visit and especially once you find that sweet spot of your favorite order.  An example of the chaos was that by the time we reached the cashier, my friend was in front and only half his order was on his tray, while mine was behind his fully completed.  The staff did a great job in getting it all straightened out and perhaps there wasnt an issue to begin with, but I prefer a seamless ordering experience and felt this one was slightly rushed and not as anal as I might like.   Patient, warm and anal is perfection for me in a cafe.   Get your mind out the gutter.   

For food I went with the Tuscan White Bean and Veggie soup and the Thai Peanut Chicken sandwich.  I wasnt into the soup at all.   It just seemed flat and lifeless, though I should have probably realized that from the description on the website:  ""A light, vegetarian soup loaded with lots of vegetables & delicious white beans.""   Why did I even order this is a question I cannot answer at the moment.  It also wasn't as hot as I like my soup to be.   Would not recommend that.   The sandwich was good.  It had a nice balance of sweet and tangy from the Peanut and Chili sauces, and the chicken tasted fresh and had a nice flavor.  The crunch from the cucumbers and pickled carrots was also welcome and slowly helped me forget how bad the soup was.

Overall it was a decent experience and meal, especially considering the price $7.99 for the sandwich and a half soup/salad.   It's not enough to have me leave Panera permanently, which shouldn't come as a surprise, and after some thorough mouthwashing she was none  the wiser to my momentary indiscretion.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,0,0,3,h1zGEUEdeNQhnigoTM_JxA

(No, seriously. I LOVE a good soup and sandwich.)

The place is clean, fast, efficient, and modern.  I walked in and out feeling very impressed by how everything looked and was run.  Service was super nice and felt really welcoming.

I had some red pepper/lobster soup, and a crab/avocado (real crab, not ""krab"") sandwich.  Everything tasted really fresh, and for the ""half and half"" combo, the serving made for a very pleasant meal.  They even offer soup samples to get a few for their excellent choices. Everything tasted fresh.  Even the berry salad that the Missus got was really tasty.  There are also a few nice bonuses such as Italian soda syrup for your beverages, and a chocolate covered strawberry as an added part of the meal.

My only advice to this little place is simply: Don't change anything: The service, the quality, and food left me with a happy stomach on the way out, and I will gladly frequent here.  Even the price hovers around $10 a person, so I was happy.

I will have to try the other options on the menu, but for a first time out, this was a great experience.

They have soup, salad and sandwiches as their staple meals. You can do combos of the three, or just one. Every meal comes with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. Anyplace that hands out chocolate covered strawberries has my vote.

They have a soda bar, where you can be your own barista and pump different flavors into your soda/tea/water/whatever. They also have a nice selection of hot sauce. 

The veggie sandwich, panini style and toasted, is my favorite. I love their Wild Mushroom Bisque soup- so good! Their Berry Salad is also good, but not as good as the soup.

The Rocky Road Brownie is a bit heavy, but their layered chocolate cake is amazing and surprisingly light.

I love how they have one person for everything. It makes everything go so much faster  and each person can help personalize your plates.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,7,1,5,-RjKmzecPkiBBjoN44Owbg

5517548,2016-10-26,4,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"We were in the vicinity with a couple hours to kill. The husband was in a sandwich mood, while I was in the please do not drive any more further mood, which made Cafe Zupas our lunch spot. I've been wanting to come here for all the years we've had to pass it on a weekly basis. We entered and there was no line, hallelujuer. We took the time to stare at the menu, but didn't take too much time as we quickly knew were going to have their pick 2 combo. You choose 2 between their salads, sandwiches, and soups. We both opted for soup and a sandwich. 

I got the vegetarian sandwich when I really meant to order their chicken pesto, but I was torn and by the time i ordered...vegetarian sandwich just vomited out my mouth. Doh! I wasn't bummed or anything because the sandwich itself was as good as a sandwich with cucumbers, tomatoes, sprouts, greens, red peppers, muenster cheese, with red pepper hummus smeared inside could possibly be. No sarcasm, seriously. 

Lover man got the Cuban grilled pork panini. He took a bite and pointed at it as he chewed, nodded his head with the hell yeah that's good in silent film tone. I wouldn't know because I declined his offer to try. He couldn't finish the other half to his sandwich, so when the kids got home...they were fighting over it. Apparently it was pretty good. 

Nevermind the touchscreen charging station, or the spacious and clean dining area, rolling and working highchairs, extremely friendly and helpful staff, touchscreen coca cola drink machine thingy, the free chocolate covered strawberry you get with each meal and bread...but that cauliflower soup was my yumgasm of the day!

They ask if you want bacon and/or cheese topped onto your soup...i skip the bacon and opted for the cheese. The heat of the soup melted that cheese into a gooey compliment. Sure there were a time or two the cheese kinda got caught.up on my chin, snagged on my tonsils...but hey...nothing I couldn't handle. Lol. But, it was so good! I literally have tried recreating it at home two times since last week. If you don't find cauliflower purposeful so you don't bother consuming it...cauliflower has lots of vitamins in it so while the soup isn't the healthiest form to consume it, CONSUME IT! Dip that free bread all up in it is you want. I didnt, but if I didn't all ready have a sandwich I wouldve. The husband ordered their clam chowder. He didn't say anything. Probably because after tasting my soup it shut his clam chowder down. Lol.

I love that everything is house-made, and locally or sourced nearby. It really makes a difference. 8.99 for the pick2. You can easily spend the same.or less and get a plate lunch/dinner...so it really is up to you and your mood as to how you want to spend your 9 bucks. For the hubs and I, Cafe Zupas was just what we were in the mood for and it satisfied us. We had a great experience. Hopefully, it doesn't go downhill as we will certainly be returning.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!

5526851,2013-08-26,0,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"Cafe Zupas or Zupas as us Utahans call it, has been a favorite lunch spot of mine for years. I didn't even know there were any in Vegas until a few months ago. Neither of the locations here are close to my home, however I still manage to drop in whenever I'm in the area.

The set up here is easy once you get a feel for the menu. I always do a 'you pick two' combo. I like to do soup and salad, while the bf always orders soup and sandwiches. The ordering process is quick, with plenty of staff to move your order down the line. The staff here is friendly and always has a smile.

My favorite soups are the Tomato Basil, Wild Mushroom Bisque and the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla. I can never decide which one so I always ask for tastings (as if I didn't know what they tasted like...). For Salads I almost always get the Nuts About Berries which I think is called their Chicken Summer Salad at times as well. But I occasionally venture out of the norm and I have to say I've never had a salad here I didn't like.

As for the sandwiches, I often think they are lacking a bit of filling. I love paninis but theirs seem to be a little lacking on the meat. The Honey Bacon Club is probably my favorite.

Each order of soup comes with slice of french bread, and every order comes with a chocolate strawberry. YAY! I've yet to try any of their desserts, but I have to say they always look amazing, so I'm tempted every single time. It's the dang chocolate covered strawberry that plays to my sense of reason and talks me out of it.

The atmosphere at this and all the locations I've visited is just so so. It can often be loud during lunch hour. I like to take my food to go and they actually don't skimp you on the portion sizes when you do.

After pointing out that the food was still out she agreed to give us soup but that was all. After ringing us out she then proceeded to close down the salad bar. There were still about 10 people in the restaurant eating but we felt like we needed to leave immediately. It was rude and poor customer service.

It is really awkward the way they are set up behind the counter.  So please I beg you Zupas if you are listening, do something - anything - so that I do not have to repeatedly explain what I ordered or didn't order to several people every time.

Also drink prices are not listed, in fact after I got and paid for an apple juice I didn't even know they had a soda machine hidden behind the techy wall. Of course I have no idea what a small, medium or large would have cost me. Strange layout, almost need to have come before to understand it.

I opted for the ham bacon club, and a bowl of lobster bisque. Both were actually pretty tasty. I didn't taste much bacon on the club, but the honey mayo mustard sauce was good. The lobster bisque wasn't bad either considering, its not top quality restaurant good but decent enough. Overall, a tasty meal for $11.31.

All the people seem to genuinely enjoy working there.  From the people taking orders, to the people cleaning up, to the lady cleaning tables.  Even the girl at the front door explaining things to new customers 1000 times seemed liked she was having a blast.  For the overall experience, I think it is the best quick bite place in Vegas",ilq8Zjr_YLbyL-AhMRReZQ,0,0,5,bM67-4CShso5KuFK_FDkPw

I mean how could you not want to return. And may I just add the chocolate covered strawberry is just an icing to the cake. I've gone with numerous friends and even got my boyfriend turned on to them and I've never had anyone complain. If you are every in the area and in need of a healthy meal cause this place is surrounded by fast food joints, stop by and try their soup, salads and sandwiches. They even have a combo option which will leave your wallet full as well as your stomach.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,10,10,5,BqUmDOavNVMwjD0tdgbsYA
5969287,2015-01-02,1,zXBrfL_ohYMuBZWvF8EcSA,"One of my favorite quick places to eat that I've found in Vegas! I'm obsessed with the cauliflower soup and unique, homemade salad dressings-and the fact you get a free chocolate covered strawberry with your meal. Plus the portions are so big I usually get 2 meals out of it. My only complaint is the price for the build your own salad is a little too high for how they skimp on the ingredients. They charge you for every little thing, I guess to compensate for the free chocolate covered strawberry ha",1vMmzy_K5sdoK9P-mNFJXA,4,4,4,DDUn7cZvLVXlmfA9A5-KSA

Otherwise, this location runs out of ingredients often, which means I always have to substitute. They offer an entire fountain of diet soda, as if it's healthier; (it's not) and their ""Don't Save Your Seat"" signs are off-putting. I want to like this place more, but I think it would be better if I just got my food to go, since that's the only thing I like about it.",AfE9gOJCFceyHLbWE2UAPA,0,0,3,ntdSaMYUy9FlUhdpAfsdUQ

The soups make me weak in the knees. And when  I am looking for a great place to sit from the overwhelming flavor I always choose a spot on the outdoor patio.",xuvMypjj570HB-OOP1rwMg,1,1,5,A03u2qlqGyoNbS9-AEFEZg
