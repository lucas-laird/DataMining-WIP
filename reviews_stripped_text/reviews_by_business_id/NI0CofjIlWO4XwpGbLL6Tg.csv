Either it's getting late or the people there are just rude as hell.  Sorry for the fuss, but this place deserve 0 star if possible for what they did.

Because of rude services, we did not think they deserve any tip.  Ate and paid the bill with a credit card, left and have fun in Vegas as usual.  A few weeks later, my friend saw her credit card statement with a charge from Alan Albert's that was more than what was shown on the her bill/receipt.  Alan Albert's had charged extra on her card.

She called the credit card company, fax them the bill (always good to save your bill/receipt) and the credit card company disputed with the restaurant.  Credit card company was able to get back the extra amount that they have charged.

What kind of service was that?  If she didn't check her credit card statement, they could have gotten away with extra $$$ for being rude.",fLhYSMZD6uTbwODfWez7kA,0,0,1,i3MQA9T2Vszg4kvyqs4kZw

Anytime I'm up in Vegas, I make a reservation here and eat like a king... Depending on the season I either get the king crab legs or the prime rib.  To add to the perfection of this establishment, the wait staff is amazing!!!  This place is also PERFECT for special events ie birthdays or congratulatory dinners... the reason being, at the end of the meal, if you ask the waiter nicely, they'll roll out a cart with 1 or 2, 20 lbs lobster on it and allow you to hold it and take pictures with it for FREE!!! 

The Cesar salad is amazing, and doesn't wreak of the anchovies flavor of smell... and with freshly ground black pepper... can I say magnificent... If you elect not to get a salad, go with the crab cake... You won't be disappointed... I had many crab cakes in my travels to Maryland, and I still AA's is far more superior.  The prime rib is in a league of it's own... It's always tender and needs no additional seasoning added to it...  I even think dipping it to the au jus and horseradish ruins the perfectly season piece of meat... 

FYI, BEWARE... The portions are very large!!!  I warn you, even if your a buffet champion, you should either stick with a salad and entree or 1 appetizer and an entree... Your wallet and stomach will thank you...",h_y9QfNWJtzmLiMTF8ALSw,1,1,5,VeHIqbmxUj00OZ_Ef0T5Vg

Couple minutes later, I got a text from him.  It said ""closed.  signs are down too"".

My mind went blank, my heart almost stopped, and the first thought that went through my head was ""DON'T KILL THE MESSENGER""!!!

It's got the feel of an old school steakhouse and I don't know about you, but when I go to Vegas, I like to explore the history and at least dabble in the feelings of the days of old there. Sure all of the modern hoorahrah is great, but that place has history and at Alan Albert's you still feel a bit of it.

The waiters are dressed as steakhouse waiters should be, in nice white jackets and know their meats. They also have great sense of humors, since I imagine living in Vegas you'd have to. On one of my trips here last year. we got an old Irish man who rapped us the specials since clearly we exuded the 50-cent vibe, what? Yeah, it was random, but this is what I love about the place.

The food is awesome. Steaks are of course their signature dish, but the seafood fare is fantastic as well. Lobstas baby! And if you go, ask if they have the lobster bisque. Sometime they do, sometimes they don't, but G-D Damn is that some good stuff! Use the bread to clean the plate, mmmm mmmmm! Also, like any old school steakhouse, the sides are a la carte, so make sure to try the creamed spinach(if this spinach thing ever let's up) and definitely get the asparagus as their hollandaise sauce kicks the ass!

Wine list is also pretty good, but the martoonis are fantastic and they know how to do a dirrty one without tasting like you are stuck in an over-saturated ""olive"" garden.

So go check it out. Not cheap, but definitely a nice meal in a cool place with great service and no one will say ""You're money"" here. Also, it is kind of hidden. If you are taking a cab, the cab driver should know, but just know that it is on Las Vegas Blvd but kind of towards the back between two buildings. You'll see :) Enjoy!",B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg,10,4,4,z28c-u1amTtAEwud3YUWdg

I remember back in 2000 when I was 21, two friends and I headed out on our virgin experience to VEGAS!  This was also right around the peak of the movie Swingers, so in essence, we thought we were ""money"".  Trent, Mickey and Sue headed over to AA's and had one of the best meals we ever had.  The Beef Wellington was amazing, the lobster outstanding and the prime rib was moist/juicey and as big as your upper torso.  We were drinking martini's and feeling very cool.  I will miss you Alan Albert's.  We will always have our memories.",Rhc6XcSxAyuBKkLOJJacXA,1,1,4,0FFdeK5D4GAr-bPsreQ0Og

It was the best meal of my life- I am sure that it had a bit to do with it being my wedding day- but the food was excellent and the waiters and staff were AWESOME!  I have a hilarious picture where they had my new hubby and I both hold a gigantic 17 lb lobster.  We didn't eat him that night- but we did eat a few of his friends.  We had crab, shrimp, steak, lobster and just about everything else they offer.  We had a cake delivered from Freeds of course.  They were really cool about that too.  I can't wait to go back sometime!",XGSgx_n3OGEBCc7SBZvlDQ,1,0,5,G4fec0jC5tx968fwa6RNkg

I am 'devastated' that Alan Alberts is ""no more""  The last time I went there was in 2000 - The service 'superb' the food ""Excellent!""  the ambiance ""great'... I think maybe the location was the problem...It was my limo driver that told me about Alan Alberts !   ... now If any of the cooks, and waiters from AA should just move to San Diego and work at Bertrand's Mr's A's ... We need ""classy, efficient, restaurant staff members !!!!!!!!",nrgVGwfkkYZfz6GEzaXPsA,0,0,5,sZqe05weczAoXitPhsBW7g
