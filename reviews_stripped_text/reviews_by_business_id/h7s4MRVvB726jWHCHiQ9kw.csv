Everywhere we go, we usually get a steakhouse in there somewhere. Our experience in Texas de Brazil was phenomenal. The salad bar was really good.. but trust me, you go for the meat. My wife kept eating the beans (Feijoada) and she normally doesn't eat beans at all. The service was also really nice.. we had our luggage with us and they kept it aside while we were in the restaurant. Overall great experience. Not overpriced either.",PIG18Mo71iLyFHNyiRVqlw,0,0,5,TBBpU_Gm1uDfLhNRMXJ1eQ

The waitress was awesome I think her name was Paula...Probably one of the best waitresses Ive ever seen .She was really nice and checked on us frequently.

The meat was quick to come to the table and frequent .All the food was excellent.
            I guess im not as good an eater as I used to be. I don't think I can eat 65.00 worth of food any more.

And will they want to take their friends when they come to town next time? The answer is yes. And yes. This place has energy. The people working here have good chemistry. The wait for our table is acceptable even for a holiday weekend. The food smells good. The meat passed my chewing test. I didn't get tired chewing. Simple. Salt and sugar level is ok for me. Everyone has a different scale for that so you make up your own mind. Fresh ingredients at the salad bar. You will leave here with a full stomach. Your choice. The alcoholic cocktail drink is strong.

I came in tonight at 630 with a reservation. We were greeted promptly upon arrival by a hostess that I remember from my last visit. she's very nice and polite. Although the girl who seated us was lacking personality. Our server on the other hand was amazing! He made sure everything came to our table so my guests could sample everything I raved about! Their favorite was the garlic sirloin! I agree that's my favorite too! Definitely suggest making reservation because I heard them quoting 1 hour wait for no reservation. I'm glad I made mine! Will definitely come back again again again! 






I came in today for lunch 1/4/17. All you can eat for $32.99! I came in with a party of 3,immediately we were greeted by the sweetest hostess! She gave us an awesome piece of advice to not go over board at the salad area and save room for the meats! She was right! Although, they have an amazing salad bar with everything you can imagine, the meats are the star of the show! Our server was extremely attentive to our needs, she made sure we really enjoyed our experience. We were on or lunch break so we didn't stay for long but I'll definitely be back for dinner!

Very nice restaurant, meat was high quality, salad bar was amazing, service was excellence, and the atmosphere was great. So many good reviews to this restaurant and I agree with them 100%. The meat was delicious, juicy, tender and tasty. Even the chicken breast was so juicy. It's really easy to dry the chicken breast on the grill (in my opinion) but I was surprised how good they cooked the meat. $50 per head but they offer special price to children and discounts to military, veterans, firefighters, teachers, seniors etc. Don't forget to check out the web site and make reservation before going there.",v1KY9k-a8Bfxz9szI1be_Q,2,1,5,JwpOPyY3MB_qUPw0Llzowg

It is Buffet style, so we definitely got our moneys worth. Were from California so i was not expecting the meat to be served to us on giant sticks,fresh off the grill. They literally cut the piece of meat you would like onto your plate. It was an interesting type of buffet!

The filet mignon and house sirloin were definitely my favorites of the night! Also their grapes (covered in blue cheese and mayo) were surprisingly delicious! The only thing i was disappointed in was the chicken. I didnt really enjoy the flavor of the chicken. It tasted dry at times compared to the beef! I couldn't stop eating the red meat! Even when i was full-just eating for the taste!

712063,2017-11-08,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"CARNIVORE HEAVEN! Now before you get that opening wrong, let me be clear...I had one of the most romantic evenings of my adult life at this place.  The restaurant is nicely dim lit. Everyone is very well dressed if you come in the evening and the person that greeted us was immediately there to take care of us and get us seated.  To make sure we weren't going to have to wait I of course booked a table in advance ;-)!  So now let me continue by talking about what you really want to hear, ""the food"".  ""Hypnotizingly Delicious"" if you could put that into those words.  Any and all meats are brought fresh and hot individually systematically to your table, ""IF"" you flip your card up indicating the color green for ""more meat""; red means no more or, not now.  The salad bar as well was very fresh with great assortments to choose from.  And as if that wasn't enough, if you somehow managed to find a spot available inside your body cavity to consider desert, out comes the waiter with an assortment of deserts that will make you shed a tear.  The choices were so difficult we each chose two and took them home because we absolutely had no room to eat at that moment hahaha.  When shared one each later that evening they were exactly what expected from the beginning to the end of a magical and magnificent evening at Texas de Brazil.  One small note:  Gentlemen, if your significant other does not like spending money, do not let your partner see the bill as this place is a strong bit on the pricey end.  However, for an anniversary event or a rare, special occasion, I have to say it was worth every penny.  Not something I would do every month, but definitely once a year regardless of what my bank account holds.  Hope anyone that reads this finds this helpful.

This is an all you can eat meat place. They have this huge salad bar that consists of veggies, bread, cold meats, soup of the day, hot starch, and cheese. Our server was a very friendly lady, sorry forgot to ask her her name, who always made sure we were doing alright. The men that came around with the meat on the stick were really friendly, and even if we didn't have our card flipped they would ask us if we wanted more meat.  The meal includes bottomless nonalcoholic drinks and a dessert of your choosing.
Now let's talk about meat. I'm personally a girl who loves her salt, species, and rare to med rare meat. Also I've been to my share of steakhouses that for the most part don't impress me. But this meat actually met my standards. My favorites were the Brazilian picanha, brazilian alcatra, and lamb chops. These meats were tender, moist, tasty, and actually medium rare.
Overall I really like this place, and think the rest of my family would enjoy this too. Can't wait to eat here again when I visit Vegas next time!",szFbXlKmLnz3jqEnCVG5FQ,0,0,5,3U45DOO6c-XmdHwA1n8-9Q

When you flip the disk to green it's non stop meats!! My favorite cut was their house specialty! Melts in your mouth! Loan constantly checked on us and our drinks were never empty! She was so attentive and also very kind! 

For desserts we ended up getting one each. chocolate cake, creme brûlée and banana foster. The chocolate cake was delicious! They even wrote happy 17th birthday with a candle for my sister which made it so personable and nice!

Our server explained how the food was served, offered us some suggestions for food and drink, and before we knew it we had an amazing spread of meats, garlic mashed potatoes, and cheese bread rolls. They also brought us some fried bananas which were AMAZING.

I've never had food like this before, and I almost couldn't keep up with everything because there was just so much to choose from. 

The only (tiny) issue I had the whole night was that their sushi rolls were all crab, and I'm allergic. I was told they were delicious, either way.

The atmosphere is very nice (we've made the mistake of coming in wearing tee-shirts; nobody said anything, but I just felt a little under-dressed.  So I make sure to at least wear a decent shirt.)  One helpful tip - be careful of the Lobster Bisque.  The very first time we ate there, I had A LOT of it, as it was so creamy and delicious.  I paid for it later that night.  Now, normally if I had problems of that type, I probably wouldn't go back.  But that just goes to show how much we loved the place.  Upon return visits I just went easy on the Bisque, and no problems.  A few Vegas visits back we were comp'ed 2 dinners to a Brazilian BBQ in Planet Hollywood.  It was terrible.

The salad bar was also excellent, and it was nice to try different Brazilian sides and veggies. But don't make the mistake that I did and fill up on that salad bar.

1208965,2016-02-22,6,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"First timers and cannot wait to go back again! A Brazilian steakhouse with a Texas spin... Service was extremely attentive from the hostess, our server, to the meat carvers! Recommend for going for lunch on the weekend, as non-alcoholic drinks & dessert are included in the $49.99 price! Also, if you are military, you receive 20% off your bill for a party up to 8 people! You're given a circular card, green side up means bring me more while red side up means give me a break. Being first timers, our server named Meagan did an excellent job of explaining everything so thoroughly! That alone justified a 20% tip! 

The salad bar is quite extensive with 50 items. For $29.99 you can actually skip the meat and just fill up in the salad bar! But it's a steakhouse, so what's the point? Lol. It had a wide variety, including traditional salad items but also things like quinoa salad, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, mushroom salad -- basically a big range of different cold ones! Across from that, there is a warm selection of side dishes. The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which had a rich & tangy flavor. There were also potatoes au gratin, sautéed mushrooms (I got two servings of both of these! So good!), black beans, and white jasmine rice. The server also brings out a side dish of mashed potatoes, sweetened plantains and cheese filled knots of bread -- which I struggled not to fill up on! I had to keep reminding myself we were there to eat steak! 

We were seated at the entrance of the kitchen so service from the men walking around with giant skewers of meat with large carving knives was amazing. If our cards were flipped up green, we were swarmed by them offering us different types ranging beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and sausage. Every single thing was seasoned & cooked to perfection... many cooked with the option of medium rare or well done. I personally did not try any of the pork/sausage, so I cannot give an opinion. I particularly did not like the chicken, as I found them to be dry. The lamb was dry as well, but extremely flavorful that I did not mind! Our personal favorites were the beef brisket (OMG, to die for! So incredibly good!), filet mignon & flank steak. Delicious! 

Once we were finished, our server brought out a tray of desserts for us to choose from... but obviously we were stuffed & didn't leave room. She offered to box it up and let us take it home, which was very nice of her! We took home the double chocolate mousse & the banana foster. Both rich & perfectly sweet. And much more enjoyed since we didn't have to force ourselves to consume it before leaving. This seriously just adds to making this dining experience even better!

It had artichoke hearts, asparagus, couscous, tabouli, just to name a few items. Quality, first rate items. We had a good time tasting all the different selections of meat. My favorite was the lamb chops. Pace yourself; there is a lot to try. Don't get filled up on the salad bar if you can control yourself! The fried bananas were yummy.

The salad bar alone is amazing; I was worried about getting full before the meat started to arrive, with some great choices; just avoid the Tabbouleh; I do not know what a Lebanese salad is doing there but it is not close to the real thing. Everything else is great; it is a meat heaven for meat lovers with just about anything you can think of that can be served on a skewer. Place is very classy too, great for a date or even a business meeting; just make sure everybody shows up for the reservation because they will not seat you until the whole party is there, which is now understandable as they try to make use of every chair because of how busy they are, and it was on a Wednesday!",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,0,0,5,HI1vmZeYCB4GgbEDz7dPug

04/21/2016 / 7pm POOOOOR Management Service Adventure!

First: I was an often recurring guest. I'm a member of three VIP Dining Cards just know and I brought any time new guests to this restaurant. Also this time.

We were 6 Person. 4 of us had a VIP card with 50% Discount (we paid for this VIP cards: $180). The another two Persons (brand new guests) had no VIP Card. They had a 10% coupon direct from Texas de Brazil. 
The Manager don't accept the 10% discount for the another first coming brand new two guests. 

Declaration by the Manager: We can not combine two offers. 
My answer was: We don't combine two offers. 4 guests pay with the 50% VIP card and the another two new guest pay seperately with the 10% discount offer from your restaurant. Manager: No, you sit on the same table!

Result: We gave $0 Tip and this restaurant lost at this moment 2 brand new returning guests and we will eat no longer there also. We change the Brazilian Steak house here in Vegas to: ""Fogo de Chao"" with a better customer service. Congratulation Manager Jose Garcia for this success.

1393456,2015-07-23,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"One of my favourite restaurants! My boyfriend and I absolutely ADORE Texas De Brazil. 

We first came here for our anniversary after getting a recommendation from my older brother. A lot of our mutual friends agreed that this place was the bomb diggity. 

The wait staff is VERY attentive. They fold your napkins when you are away from the table and are SUPER on top of drinks. All the food is delicious and there really isn't anything to complain about. 

TIPS AND TRICKS: 

I would suggest going to lunch rather than dinner. Dinner price is 50 dollars and lunch is 30. The only difference is that lunch doesn't include sushi, heart of palm, and buffalo mozzarella at the salad bar. I love the heart of palm and mozzarella but I'd rather have a cheaper bill. 

Lunch is also a lot more laid back than dinner. Not that fancy is a bad thing! It's just what you are in the mood for that day, I suppose. 

My favourites include the fried bananas, lamb chops, and Brazilian sodas.  I would also suggest getting a dessert, specifically the cheesecake. While it's not included in the meal, it's definitely worth the extra charge. And if you get the lunch with a desert, it's still cheaper than the dinner charge! ;D

ALSO! MAKE A RESERVATION. THIS PLACE GETS PRETTY PACKED.",VFtQI1mODorJr_mHIglsCA,0,0,5,p3zjsIEJv8VnuL7PaTRwXw

Great meats, a great atmosphere, great sides, and a huge salad bar. I love coming here, I just wish I was rich so I could do it more often. Even though it's pricey, I still feel like I always get what I payed for. 

The salad bar, by the way, is not limited to just salads. It also contained smoked salmon, various cured meats, and sushi. It's extremely easy to fill up on just the salad bar -- if that's what you're into, or you just want to save money, they also offer a salad-bar-only menu option.

This Brazilian steakhouse is basically an all you can eat steakhouse so definitely come on an empty stomach! They have servers walking around with a variety of meat and all you have to do is flip your card either green or red side up for the servers; green for go, red for stop. Once the server is at your table, you'll have your meat sliced right in front of you. In addition to this delicious meal, they have a salad bar to balance out the meat. They have variety of food like soup, salad, bread, and vegetables. 

Another reason why I gave 5/5 stars is for their service. Our server gave an brief description of what we were about to get into and from time to time he would constantly ask if there is anything we need. Another pointer is that all of the servers would fold your napkin back into its original position so it's all nice and tidy when you come back to your table. 

Last but not least, all of their soft drinks, coffee, and desserts are included in your meal. Desserts are limited 1 per person but they have a wide range to choose from, from a slice of cake to a cup of crème brûlée. Nothing could have ended a filling meal other than a sweet dessert.",dN74SsnOxh-6QXfwKz2GNg,2,0,5,K0qeOnTGnlwmZsMvdy3f_Q

The salad bar has a huge tropical floral arrangement in the center.

You start at the salad bar and then move on to the meat! You get a small circle chip with green on one side meaning you want the carvers to come to the table and red on the other meaning you do not want any more meat. There are gentlemen who walk around the restaurant with different types and cuts of meats on a spit and they cut small pieces for you. The meat is cooked medium rare but it's so flavorful! 

The restaurant itself is quite large with a huge wine selection. The tables are smaller and intimate; the lighting dim. I would say typically you spend around 1-1.5 hours dining. This is a great place and I will keep coming back!",i6YHXZfcdtDzZSeEF9Wo3w,0,0,4,_70fhvIXxQ3fctc0OXwXKA

First of all, this Texas de Brazil is in a prime location: inside Town Square and minutes from the airport as well as the Strip. After a long day of shopping and/or taking in the sights, this would be a perfect option for dinner. 

The process is simple. You're given a small double sided card. Green means go and red means stop. There are many different servers throughout the restaurant that will bring you many different varieties of meat. There's an unlimited salad bar so you can have sides with your meat. You're also given a side of mashed potatoes. They also give you a side of plantains that serves as a palate cleanser in between meats, but they are also a perfect sweet snack to have after your meal.

The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was exciting. The food was delicious and the meats were all cooked to perfection. It's clear that these guys are pros in their game. The only downside is the hefty price tag, but it's worth every penny in my opinion. 

If you love meat or are looking for a unique take on a steak house, please do me a favor and try this place out. I will be back and I will be finding any reason to make up a special occasion to come here.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,2,2,5,P0vFGKrGcpWE2qaNJTGhYQ

They offer a salad bar with all types of items to choose from.. My favorites are the lobster bisque, mushrooms with the sauce, tomatoes, green beans, roasted garlic, and don't forget the chimichurri sauce!

   The salad bar has a great selection of sides ranging from seasoned cheeses to smoke salmon. It's always hard not to go a little overboard on the salad bar since they offer a great variety. Soups have always been good and they always offer between 4-5 kinds. On to the meats.
   If you are looking for a specific meat your waiter/waitress will ask if there is a meat your looking for. Just let them know and eventually one of the servers will come by. If you are a fast eater just let the servers know you would like another serving. Serving size seems small but you have to remember you are being served pork, chicken, beef, and lamb. I've always been happy with the meats they served, never finding them too salty and they have never arrived dry.

The only reason they did not get 5 stars was because in my reservations I specifically requested a quiet table nowhere near the salad bar and where did the sit us?  Yeah.... literally right next to the salad bar.

They did however make up for it by throwing the extras for my son as we were there celebrating his birthday.",NpdBHY6rGDMQljRWrRx6eg,2,1,4,Y7QUnYJg7mU2mnvrJRRnKw

The best is their house special which I think is a top sirloin. It is AMAZING. The other thing that really stood out was the filet.

My boyfriend and I celebrate special occasions (bdays, anniversary) here because we just love the food and service. Reservations are highly recommended. They have a plentiful salad bar with fresh cold meats, cheeses, olives, and salads for you to enjoy. They also serve hot items on the salad bar, including lobster bisque which is amazing and au gratin potatoes which are to die for. They are creamy and cheesy, and I prefer these over any of the hot sides they bring to the table. Hot sides usually consist of mashed potatoes, fried bananas and cheese bread.

The main star of the show is of course the meats. I love all the meats they have to offer. My favorite is the garlic Picanha. It is so flavorful. I also like the filet mignon. You can choose how done you want the meat too, anywhere from mooing, all the way to well done. Other meats they have are parmesan chicken and pork, bacon wrapped filet mignon, brazilian sausage, leg of lamb, beef and pork ribs, and flank steak. I found a few of the meats were a bit too salty, so I ended up drinking A LOT of water. Make sure to grab some Brazilian vinaigrette and Chimichurri at the salad bar.

The potatoes au gratin were nice and cheesy, and the garlic shrimp was also pretty good. I appreciated having some seafood options amidst all of the meat we were about to feast upon.

This was probably the first time I've been here that I didn't stuff myself silly. I was very strategic and didn't eat everything that came around, so I could really enjoy the things I did.

A long time ago I visited one of these in Texas and instantly fell in love.  All kinds of meat, cooked all kinds of ways, and a salad bar with sushi.

My favorites are the house special (I believe it is top sirloin) and the filet mignon.  I am also a huge fan of the Brazilian sausage.

I am also one of those people that will order, like, 6 dishes of sweet fried bananas.  Seriously, that's my favorite 'dessert' even though it's a side.

The past couple of times I've been the service has not been over-the-moon like my first few visits here.  I am not sure if it's just luck of the draw or if they're getting some new faces, but our last server, Marina, barely checked on our table and we had to hunt her down to get specific meats sent to our table.

This is definitely one of my favorite splurge spots in the valley.  While the price is a little steep ($50/person), you are paying for serious quality and (usually) great service.

They also had a VIP Card special this year: you pay $59.99 and receive a punch card with 12 punches.  Each of those punches equals 50% off the normal price, so you save ~$260.  Hopefully they do it again next year.

As much as I'd like to eat here weekly, I'm pretty sure I'd explode in a shower of meat and bananas, so it's a good thing that it's a special occasion spot.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,1,0,4,LReDNaCOicdKCYCxpq0U7Q

This was a first time for both my boyfriend and me, but he's been to a similar all you can eat Brazilian Steakhouse. And since we were in Las Vegas, why not try this popular place out! First off, I highly recommend making reservations like we did even for a party of two. It was definitely busy at around 6 PM, so make reservations so you don't wait long. 

Like I mentioned above, there is an unlimited buffet which included a variety of salads, cheese, salami, veggies, sushi, soups, breads, and other various foods to accompany your meat. Your table also automatically receives mashed potatoes, mini bread rolls, and plantains. If the soup of the day is the lobster bisque - get it! Nice way to start the service. I recommend not taking a lot good from the buffet area because it may make you full before you even try your meats!

And once you sit down you can start trying the various meats they have to offer! All come out steaming hot and there are servers who come around asking if you want a particular meat from different cuts of steak, chicken, sausage, lamb, etc. There's a small sign that you flip to green if you want meat and a red one to say no thanks. We absolutely loved the flank steak! It had a nice small fat layer to meat that made it super delicious! We had to keep asking for more! Wish we got to try every cut of meat, but our stomachs wouldn't allow us!

The waitress and service was spot on! She was always attentive and recommended drinks and buffet food to try out. Also, if you haven't seen a particular meat come out for a while, she can get the server to bring the meat around.

It would have been an amazing experience. My boyfriend talked highly of this place up until we came together recently for the first time. Most of the meats kind of fell a little short, some were dry and tough. Some were bland. The people going around with the sticks would ask everyone on the table if they wanted the meat because obviously just because one person doesn't want it doesn't mean the other one wouldn't either. They'd ask my boyfriend first and when he said no they wouldn't even bother to ask me and would just leave. 
I did like the mashed potatoes I guess, it was good. Servers should also always mention that desserts cost extra. I mean that could be our fault for not realizing but it should something to mention. 

The thing that really ruined the experience was that our tab said $87 but they took $102 off my boyfriend's card. I realized it's 20% so I'm guessing they automatically take the tip but it should always be written on the tab. It should say our total is $102 with the 20% tip instead of just $87. When we asked them about it they said it was a problem with our card company?? Like that doesn't even make sense. I tried to ask on yelp if they automatically take the tip off and my question got deleted because ""it was talking negatively"" about the restaurant.

We messed up and accidentally left our card on the tab the second time and when we asked our server, she just stared at us and kept cleaning. Everyone left the restaurant and we just stayed sitting there.  We were alone with the workers cleaning and still waiting until maybe 15 minutes later we ask her again and she finally got it.

We were able to experience so many types of meats, cuts and flavors. The filet mignon was extremely tender, lamb chops with mint sauce full of flavor, bacon wrapped chicken definite delight, pork sausage cooked just right and the variety of extra sides at the salad bar was an overload of goodness. 

Our server Amanda was amazing as well. She was attentive, personable and when we requested a certain meat she was quick to have it sent to our table. She was so polite, for instance she would ask permission to pour more sangria instead of just assuming we wanted more. She also used a splashguard while pouring. Now I know that's a standard in most restaurants but not followed all the time. Her recommendations were well taken.

Tip: get the menu with all of the meats and plan ahead. Don't accept whatever is offered. Pace yourself. Suggest you try the Brazilian picahna, filet with bacon, lamb chops and beef spare ribs.  Meat is all buttery soft and perfectly prepared. I love the picahna and the filets were tender and juicy. Food was hot (temperature not spice) which can be a risk when theyre walking around with it like that. The parmesian encrusted pork was a little dry for me, but the beauty of this place is that you can set it aside and go for something else.

We sat down and had the first round of meats then we didn't see anyone for 15 min, I mean NO ONE, not our waiter or any carvers! Our waiter came by and I told him the issue a few minutes later 2 carvers stopped by then nothing again for 15 min and this was a slow day according to our waiter and 2 carvers. The waiter apologized and mentioned it to the manager which I believe is the GM cause I remember him when it first opened up. I asked to speak to the manager since I had to wave down carvers and the manger didn't come to talk to me. The waiter apologized again and pointed him out to me to talk to him on the way out. We had the VIP card which is always returned to us by a manager once they stamp it and come thank you for being a regular VIP customer, again he avoided us and had the waiter bring us the card back. To top it off he has the nerve to look me in the eye and walk away into the kitchen area when he saw us walk toward him. I waited a few minutes and just left.

They had a lot of cheese and meat choices and a few different salads. It wasn't a huge selection, but it was more than enough to fill my plate, not leaving any room for when the guys with the meat came around. lol The filet mignon wrapped in bacon was one of the best options, in my opinion. The sausage was really good too. Good think about Brazilian steakhouses is that you get to try a big variety of different meats and usually can't go wrong with any of them. We tried some of the desserts after dinner, even though I don't think anybody really had room for them and they were ok. I got the cheesecake, but I wasn't really impressed. I kind of wish I would've gotten something different.
The problem I did have was the service. We had a private room with about 12 of us so we weren't a super large group, but every time I asked for something, I had to ask multiple times because he kept forgetting about me.

If you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, here's a quick guide:
1. Sit down and order something to drink
2. Go up to the salad bar as many times as you like
3. Flip your meat card from red to green until you can't eat anymore assortments of meat that are being walked around for you to choose from.
4. Once you can't eat another bite, flip your card to red and order dessert. 

If you're not a meat person, they do have the option for someone to just do the salad bar for half the price. 
I love this salad bar, it's worth coming here just for that, but I try to pace myself knowing the meats are next. The salad bar has a wide variety of different salads, vegetables, cheeses, sushi, salamis, etc.

The salad bar had a lot of options so it's hard to not stack up on that. You want to try everything but you also want to save room for all the meats. 

They also bring you fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese rolls. Fried bananas were amazing!!! Not like what we have had before. It's not rolled in dough, more so covered in sugar.

We also enjoy the plantains and cheese rolls that come out. The mashed potatoes are good too. Service has been nothing but great thus far. Wine options are very broad.

You would think that when you're paying 55 a person plus cost of drinks, that refills were included. We had a $1,000 bill from our table, and $100 of it was strictly refills. Seems a little extreme. It would have been nice if they would have let us know that those were extra every time they filled the glass. Seems kind of a dis honest move to get every little dollar.

The waiter we had was awesome the whole night, quick and attentive service and super friendly, helpful and informative with all his recommendations.

As for the dinner service, it was $50 a person. (Dessert not included) The salad bar was pretty standard self serve. My personal favorite option was the Lobster Bisque, tastes great. The meat selection was ridiculous in a good way. Every selection of the meats on the skewer swords looked mouth watering! I tried pretty much most of the meats offered for dinner. 
My personal favorites:
-Braised Beef Ribs
-Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon
-Brazilian Sausage 
-Flank Steak 
-Brazilian Picanha

Overall, the experience here at the Vegas location was a good one. High quality cuts and high quality tasting meats!

Our waiter was the only saving grace to this poor service experience. He was actually very good and prompt and extremely apologetic for the the service we had receive prior to his arrival. The food was good plenty of items on buffet/salad bar area. The food was fresh and constantly being put out and well displayed. The Brazilian BBQ was good with lots of meats always coming around. I'd say the leg of lamb was the best on the menu. Dessert was goods the chocolate cake was very well done. I was wasn't a fan of the cheesecake it was way too sweet.

On to the meat, don't waste your time with chicken. It's not because its not good, but seriously with that much freshly grilled steak flying your way, why waste time (and valuable stomach space)

Highlights were the sirloin, flank, and bacon wrapped filet. The sausages were surprisingly good and the pork ribs were extremely tender and delicious. Cooked to perfection.

You turn over a red circle to present a green circle which signals the servers walking around with meat to stop by you table and offer you some meat. Immediately when we turned our circle over, we were bombarded by servers. A bit shocked to be honest, but the house special sirloin was amazing. 
Some of the servers would come even when you circle was red, but it wasnt the end of the world. I would say the food itself was not enough for the price, but with the presentation and experience was definitely worth it.

My family and I had reservations here at 7:15pm on Father's Day and it was very jam packed in there. It's $50 a person and it's basically a buffet and there are servers walking around telling you what meat it is and how it's prepared (filet mignon medium rare). As you are seated each one of you are given a card which you can flip over. The green side of the card means you're ready for more meat so the servers will come to you, while the red side means you're not ready for more and so the servers won't come to you. There are also other servers that don't carve the meat but instead check up on you and will give you a new plate if they see your plate is getting messy or if you're done with it. Considering it was Father's Day I didn't expect such a great service and coordination from the workers, but they really worked as a team. I tried a majority of the meat they carved and my favorite had to be the filet mignon, but you can't go wrong with any of their meats. As for the buffet section I LOVED their mushrooms and their potato salad. However if you want to get your moneys worth don't be a fool like me and eat all the carb heavy foods like the potato salad, mashed potatoes, cheese bread, and fried bananas. They have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages but the only downside was that I ordered two Midori sours and it was about $15 which is quite expensive as I've been to other high end restaurants with Midori sours that were only a fraction of the cost. Overall this place really does deserve 5 stars because the whole restaurant works as a team, servers were very attentive even on Father's Day, and the meat and food was prepared perfectly. Definitely a great place for to go to for any holiday or an occasion like Father's Day which also happened to be my dads birthday.",hMwPqwbNQV94fWSBhM4QaQ,1,0,5,A5gv8930LPAL081jGws63A

They made some really great suggestions. I loved the beef ribs. When I couldn't find them anymore I was devastated. But to my rescue, my server was able to ask some fine gentlemen to bring some over for our table. That was fantastic!! I swear, those beef ribs are life changingly delicious. 

I couldn't imagine how in the world I was going to be able to consume my $50 worth of meat and sides but I noticed that if you sign up for their email based club online, before your visit, you will receive a $25 off coupon. I know, for a fact, that I would not be dining here too often if anytime real soon. So, I signed up and thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to use that voucher for my meal.

Located in the Town Square shopping center and across from Look Style Society, very easy to get to and has it's own parking spot.There was a bit of a wait, not too long, about 20 minutes on Friday, Labor Day Weekend so that's pretty good. But I made reservations earlier for 8pm, which I think is the best way to go.
Came here for Dinner at $49.99/person which included unlimited salad bar and unlimited meats! The salad bar had tons of options! My favorites were the Lobster Bisque of course, and the Potatoes Gratin. I also saw a variety of cheeses, deli meats, curried cauliflower, all types of salads with quinoa, beans, and your typical toppings with romaine lettuce, grilled veggies, mushrooms, smoked salmon, shrimp, breads, etc. Pretty amazing but don't get too filled up on all of that since at your table you get unlimited meats coming around!
If you've never been here, they have little coasters on the table, one per person, with one side green and one side red. If you want meat, you flip it to the green side, and if you need a little break or if you've decided to throw in the towel, you flip it to the red side! When it's green, they have servers that walk by your table, each with a large skewers of a different style of meat and you tell them how many pieces your want! The options from what I can remember were Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin (The infamous Picanha- the FAVE at our table), Lambs Chop, Parmesan Pork/Chicken, Bacon wrapped Filet, Pork Ribs, Flank Steak, and Brazilian Sausage! Phew! Tons of meat options!
Then if you're still not full, or if you suddenly get a second stomach like me right when dessert comes, they have a lot of great options as well! Brazilian Cheesecake, Crème Brûlée, Brazilian Flan, Chocolate Mousse Cake, Bananas Foster Pie, Key Lime Pie, Carrot Cake, Pecan Pie, Brazilian Papaya Cream, and Coconut Pie. They brought the dessert tray out and I wanted to try basically everything especially the Crème Brûlée, Flan, and Papaya Cream but decided to go with the Carrot since it's my dad's favorite. So this carrot cake is pretty amazing. It doesn't have raisins in it and it has a coconut element to it so just that makes it an A in my book but on top of that it was super fluffy and moist and wasn't too sweet. I mean it was sweet definitely but it wasn't that artificial, loaded with powdered sugar type of sweetness. Perfect way to end the meal! Even though I don't eat meat often nowadays, on meat days, this is a definite contender especially if it's a special occasion. Yum! I'll be back!

We hardly ate any of the meat they walk around and serve and we paid like $20 extra for that (which was fine because we wanted the whole experience). But the salad bar would fill anyone up. 

Patricia was our waitress and she was amazing, so sweet and on her game. Polite and made our experience one of a kind. I would like to personally thank her.

We had a $25 off for joining the club type thing they had online, and since it was our anniversary we got a free piece of cake! So we got $34 off our bill.

Don't forget the tasty sweet fried bananas and garlic mashed potatoes! There is so much meat that is constantly being offered, some of my favorites were filet mignon, lamb chops, and leg of lamb. I also enjoyed tasting the flank steak and beef ribs. They also offer pork and chicken, didn't bother tasting any since that is something I can eat anywhere.

It's my favorite, an ayce buffet. Everything was epic and can't wait to go back. 

Located on the edge of town square, which is on Las Vegas Blvd not a far drive from the strip. 

Make a reservation. You don't need to dress up major but it is a nice place and very busy. Worth the wait, the hype is real. 

I got a little bit of everything naturally and was very pleased with it all. Salad bar is very good quality with lots of options I enjoyed. Salmon, grapes, olives, cheeses, cucumbers, and so much more. The house vinaigrette was so good to top it all. Lobster bisque was nice, pineapple slices were so good, loved everything.

After dishing my salad we at and found they had already brought us bread, potatoes, and bananas. Soon after several meat carvers came around. You may have to wait to get seated but when you do the food comes fast and from every angle. So much fun. 

Simply flip this card over they give you and they will stop bringing meat, flip it back over when ready for more fresh meats.  This kept the meat carving service at the pace you want. 

Speaking of service it was absolutely amazing teamwork the whole time. The waiter and staff really impressed me with their attention to detail. Removing plates very quick. Refills often. Once noticing that I was little worried a piece of meat was too raw,  he instantly said if any meat is too raw for your liking just don't eat it and we'll bring another cooked just right. 

Impressed with the service and staff for sure and just loved the food. I'll be back very often. Thanks again to yelp friends for helping me find this place. My phone battery died but I knew this meal was going to be so epic I bought a new S9 just to get the best pictures possible. Haha. Thanks for reading and hope you enjoy your meal if you visit.

Up until my last experience, I loved this place and brought people every time they are in town! I have easily been here over 25 times. Many of my colleagues also frequent here.

The coffee was cold when it came to the table, not warm actually cold and our reservations were at 1230 which is only 30 minutes after they open. When my new coffee did come out no new creamer or sugar was brought to the table with it, which I do not recall ever having to ask to be done so I waited with my black coffee until the waiter made his way to us again. My hunny was never asked if he would like a refill on his drink the entire meal. It was just one thing after another on this visit and is so surprising for a place that is usually flawless. Next I informed our server I have a cinnamon allergy and asked for the fried bananas without cinnamon as I always do and this time they arrived soggy lacking the usual chefs integrity. Even when I told our server about my severe allergy he seemed scared to request them and emphasized that it would take quite some time because they just made a large batch of the ones with cinnamon. I informed him I was aware they would take some time which is why I ordered them early while we ordered the drinks. It was also the first time I had a cut of meat completely over done, I mean it was rubbery and charred which is also not the norm for this place. The ribs usually melt right off the bone and were tough this time too. Usually every different meat that comes around to your table here is perfection, but not so on this visit. 

Lastly, the manager actually noticed I had a comment card in my hand and made a point to walk my pace to time perfectly meeting me at the exit and receive my card. I was impressed! Until he failed to address the comment card. We actually were standing outside the establishment for about 15 minutes talking about our experience and planning our next place to go. And not so much as a  personal apology, phone call or email! Which lead me to believe he just chucked my comment card.

3157544,2017-04-13,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"Ok, so I have to say that Texas de Brazil have an awesome salad bar. They also have a good rodizio, yet it has a spicy cost. One of the things I like about Texas de Brazil is their picanha, but I don't like how you have to get the all you can eat ""rodizio"" to eat it. So, there are other places in town where you can get a certain type of meat, or plate a la cart! However, this is not the case of Texas de Brazil so it loses one start for it.

Another concern I have is in regards to their caipirinha! I'm sorry Texas de Brazil, but you have to step up and start using real sugar to make caipirinhas. As a Brazilian who goes constantly to steakhouses in Las Vegas (every week), I have to say that their caipirinha really sucks! It hurts me having to say that, but it's true. So it loses another star for claiming that they are making Caipirinhas correctly, while using fake sugar syrup to craft them. I even asked the server to use real sugar, but my request was denied and the drinks tasted weird and fake. Not to say that they still charged me for that so I have to take one star for it.

Alright, so besides the lack of options for dining and the bad caipirinhas Texas de Brazil has a beautiful dining room and lots of space for you to bring your whole family! Just remember to not bring your 100 years old grandma to eat there unless you want her to have a heart attack. As there's not an option for ala cart, you must be aware that every time you go there, you will end up spending at least 70 dollars per person with taxes and tip.

Texas de Brazil is used to having lots of tourists, so I feel like they left the locals behind and this is the reason why I have to rate it accordingly to my experience. I'm a local, and I will be updating my review as they improve. If they start to make Caipirinhas with real sugar and add some new options other than rodízio on your menu, then I'm willing to increase their rating.

Finally, my review is based on their competition, which have constantly been taking customers input and improving their menu, deals and drinks. So, nothing more fare than expecting the same from Texas de Brazil right? If they really care about their locals like me, then eventually they will reach out to me and listen to what me and others have to say regarding their menu and Caipirinhas. This is an important topic as Caipirinhas are our national Drinks and it should be made correctly. Cheating out on sugar won't help you improve our experience and their ratings.

Hence, I hope you find this review helpful as I have addressed the pros and cons of this large Brazilian steakhouse. If you are looking for an alternative restaurant where you can get ala cart items at a very discounted price, then you can try Via Brazil steakhouse that offers ala cart options, happy hour deals at a fraction of the regular price and real Caipirinhas (crafted with real sugar and lots of limes). Let me know what you think about those differences I've addressed.",J4sI9iOi0ZmB7Q1t1vSqPA,1,0,3,bm6RpCUWwOdroinpalviow

This was one of many lies that young lady would tell.  After standing around for 25 minutes I went to check on what was going on.  She seemed annoyed that i was bothering her.  She quickly said there were several others ahead of me and that my party would be coming up soon.  We were finally called at 7:20 and could have walked in without a reservation and got in at the same time.  the people behind me who got in at the same time as me did just that.
   So I was willing to accept that the food would be worth the wait.  I had heard nothing but good things about this place and the reviews were positive.  I will say the salad bar was nice and they had allot of things to choose from.  The meat was OK and not as good as i had expected.  From overcooked to just bland was the theme.  The lamb was the only thing that stood out as being special.  
    The service was slow and we waited for everything from the Waiter.  The Servers carrying the meat were nice but they became scarce after the first go around and we had to call them over several times to get the items we liked.

It's a great experience to bring your family or friends since it's different than most dining experiences. I have not been to another Brazilian steakhouse to compare this to but I'm afraid if I do I'll be disappointed from comparing it to this place. My favorite is the braised beef ribs. Also get the lobster bisque and have them put fresh black pepper on it and dip the cheese bread. Their top sirloin is my second favorite. I also enjoyed their Parmesan chicken it's very juicy. I'm not a big fan of lamb chops but they cook it just right to cook off the gamey flavor.

Their service matches the quality of their food. They are very attentive to you and take care of you. Fake or not they definitely fake it till they make it, these servers deserve respect and a nice tip.",1QDSU4NDpAuw1aYgrgcJWQ,1,0,5,IetW8yGB_PppXT7doEUmXQ

Flank steak was another winner.  And the house special sirloin is definitely the star of the show.

At your table they leave mashed potatoes, plantains, and little cheesy breads that are all you can eat. After you've finished they bring a dessert tray and you pick the dessert of your choice.

3394579,2017-05-04,1,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"Make sure you are hungry and you like to eat meat. The style of a Brazilian BBQ is to have servers roving around the dining floor with a variety of meats. They stop by your table and offer you some of the meat they are offering. These meats include filet mignon, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, sausage, Parmesan pork, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak, ribs, etc. You will be given a button to put on your table that indicates whether you want the servers to stop by or not. 

The meats are high quality and they also offer some side dishes in addition to full access to a large salad bar. The side dishes include mashed potatoes, cinnamon fried bananas, and Brazilian cheese bread. The salad bar has soups, salads, cheeses, vegetables, deli meats, and some other food items. 

It's basically a gourmet buffet with a twist. The service is attentive and if there is any meat you are looking for in particular, you can just ask. 

My only complaint would be the price, but for what you are getting and the experience, the price is actually very reasonable. It's a great place to celebrate a special occasion or dine out to. 

The inside area, while large, doesn't feel like you are in a large buffet dining hall. The lighting is dim and feels intimate even though there are lots of nearby tables. 

Make sure you get a reservation if you are dining with a large group, or be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes in peak times.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,1,1,5,v-NsYoDDYMbVs9bA_HYs0Q

This is honestly not only an amazing restaurant but also an amazing experience, something you must do at least once. 

Dinner runs about $50 a person but trust me you will eat much more the $50 worth. 

You start by being seated ( we had a 8pm reservation, showed up a bit early and was seated promptly at 8) they take your drink order water is free, everything else is extra. They have a extensive amazing drink menu with everything from cocktails to 5 pages of wine. Your then sent to get your plate and start off at the ""Salad Bar"" which feels wrong giving it such a basic name because not only does it have salad options you have amazing veggies options, cheese, salami, shrimp, salmon, over 50+ options. AND THE SOUP THE CRAB BISQUE do not forget to try it. I would go there just for the crab bisque.

You then head back to your table where you are in the greatest way bombarded by meat options from carver after carver. Every kind of meat you can imagine cooked and seasoned to perfection! Bring your fat pants because you will need them!

They then offer you a dessert menu which is all the desserts on all a platter (fake but they look real lol) and you take your choosing.

I even used a birthday $25 off two dinners coupon during this meal, so I don't know how much more obvious I could have been.

My little grudge aside, the interior of this Texas de Brazil, like all Texas de Brazil locations, is quite opulent. Service is attentive and they will come by to fold your table napkin when you are up getting food. 

Prices are standard, $50 for dinner for all-you-can-eat meats + salad bar. 

I think the meats here are on the saltier side (some cuts more than others), so I prefer the meat at Fogo de Chao better, though I strongly prefer the salad bar at Texas de Brazil. Plus, Texas de Brazil salad bar has lobster bisque!

Dinner: $49.99 per person. $24.99 if you only want the salad bar. 

I recently met with a group of friends here and a few of us had already written reviews for this place yet noticed they were gone. Strange. Hubby and I have been fans of this place for years. I just wish they'd open one closer to me! This place gets packed at night and especially on weekends. The menu says Texas de Brazil is a Brazilian-American Churrascaria that combines the cuisines of Southern Brazil with the generous spirit of Texas. 

The salad bar here is effing amazing. Probably designed to fill you up to eat less meat, but I could honestly come here fore the salad bar alone. The menu says 50-60 options and I'd have to agree. The grilled provolone is one of my favorites and there's a good amount of savory hot dishes as well. 

They give you a round card that you flip to green when you are ready for carvers to bring by some of that steak, lamb, chicken, pork and Brazilian sausage. The bacon wrapped chicken, sausage and garlic sirloin are my faves. The meal also comes with sides of mashes potatoes, sweet fried bananas and cheese rolls. The little cheese rolls are so good! I've never had room for dessert, but there is a dessert menu. The staff is very friendly and professional. Definitely a great spot for a variety of occasions. I'd recommend buying a VIP Dining Card when they are available for a limited time each year so you can save money on visits, just keep in mind they are only redeemable until the expiration date.

3634292,2017-08-30,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"If you've never been to Texas de Brazil, you're in for an experience unlike most others. Contrary to a typical dining experience where you order from the menu, at TdB you take a seat, order your beverage and the food is served on the spot. Your table will be approached continuously by numerous servers each offering a prepared selection of meat: bacon wrapped filet mignon, BBQ flank steak, beef rib, garlic sirloin, lamb chops, rotisserie chicken, sausage, pork loin and more. The flank steak stood out as the best of the bunch. If you've eaten too much, flip over a marker that informs the server you're full; they wont offer any more. Flip it over when you're hungry again and the meat keeps a comin'. 

A salad bar is available with a large selection of prepared salads, meats. cheeses and some salmon. You can build your own salad as well, but I found it to be lacking most of the basic ingredients of a typical salad: chopped tomato (Or cherry tomato), diced onion, cucumber, spinach, black olive and egg. Yes, they have bacon bits and croutons. You can however get creative and just top off the lettuce with some of the prepared salads and lay dressing over the top (Meh?). A prepared chick pea salad seemed to help. They offer sliced tomato, but it seems odd to lay it on top of a salad. It's meant to be tasted with fresh mozzarella and balsamic.

A hot-station has au gratin potatoes, fish, beans and a couple other options. Don't fill up on all these offerings however; you'll need room for the abundance of beef, pork. chicken and sausage. At this particular location, it was very busy and our service was sub-par. The people seated in the middle of the restaurant were getting flooded with meat offerings. We were set off to the side and spent several minutes waiting for someone to come over. The server offered me another glass of club soda. What he didn't tell me is that I'd be charged $3.50 for every glass. Most restaurants will charge you for the first glass and give refills for free. Not at TdB. I spent over $10 on three glasses of club soda: nice way to run up the bill mr server. When finished, we waited a long time for our plates to be cleared and for desert to be offered. 

For desert I ordered Creme Brulee and a glass of Chalk Hill Chardonnay ($13 for the wine...not bad). The Chardonnay however was served in a water glass shaped somewhat similar to a wine glass. This glass is not suitable for wine though. What happens when you order a 1995 Chateau Latour for $2500? Do they serve it in a water glass????

As this is unacceptable, I went to the bar in search of a wine glass (I wasn't willing to wait around for our server to return.) When I went to the bar, I expecting to see a fine collection of wine glasses (They have top-dollar bottles on that wine menu). Low and behold, there are none. I asked the bartender if they had a wine glass. She handed me a water glass. I informed her that this is a water glass and that I needed a wine glass. After some scrambling, she produced a Bordeaux glass. Ahhh.....they do have wine glasses, but only for those who spend the big bucks. On the table to our right, they ordered a bottle a wine. Yes, it was served in water glasses. I guess they didn't spend enough money.

The Creme Brulee was fine, but not above average. I should have ordered the cheese cake. Aside from banana cream pie, the other offerings wouldn't have paired up well with the wine (Chocolate cake?).

Many people have complained about TdB meats being too salty. I understand why this is a so. Many of the meats, but not all, are seasoned about as much as possible without it being over-seasoned. For some folks, this will come across as tasting like sea water on the palate. IMO, it was a touch on the salty side, but not to the point of error. Perhaps on some days they get a little carried away with the seasoning. They probably have seasoning shakers in the kitchen. If careless, it would be easy to ruin a good dish.

I think you should experience TdB. The experience is unique and everything is well prepared. That being said, it's clearly over-priced. Our meal was 50% off and I still spent $65 including tip: $25 for the meal, $13 for the wine, $10 for the club sodas and $9 for the desert. I don't care how you slice it; it was not a $95 meal. They served my wine in a water glass. LOL. TdB is much like a buffet, but instead of walking up to it, the buffet comes to you...and it's all meat. Try it one time and decide for yourself if you'll go back. Pay the $50 for the meal, buy a drink and skip the desert. I would go back, but order cautiously.

If you're thinking of taking a date here, think twice unless you are certain that person is a die-hard meat lover. Of course, you could pass on the meat and just order the salad bar.....$20.",k_ygij9GEqELTg3nYca_zw,0,0,3,YwzzXgcmWrJlmDDC6eec4g

This was my first time at any churrasco place, so it was definitely different than what I'm used to when it comes to AYCE. Servers go around with different meat that you can try, which is pretty cool. But if there's a certain meat you really like & want more of, you have to wait til they come back around to your table.

Meats were good & tasty. Some were too salty for my taste, but everything was really good. There's a buffet table with sides, salads, veggies, soups, etc. that you can go up to as frequently as you like. Their lobster bisque was really good.

One major downside is that dessert ISN'T included in the price! You'd think after paying $50/person for dinner would include dessert, unfortunately, that's not the case =/

It's obviously not a restaurant I'd go to frequently due to their price & amount of food one could consume, but it's definitely a good place to go to for special occasions.

Word of advice: 
- Don't eat too much sides as you'd want to get your money's worth on the meat.
- Eat each meat as you get them. If you wait (which sometimes takes them a while to get to your table), the quicker you'll get full.",Kq_Cg-INSv4i8wNo1kDF-w,0,0,4,Qi0Dezx7iItL_lcdNEW6iw

This place is a carnivores paradise and an ethical vegans worst nightmare. So much meat is paraded upon the floors of this place one could assume sacrifices to the meat gods were made here. This may be true...

The meat options are numerous. Filet Mignon, Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon, chicken, lamb chops, the list is impressively long. Your servers will be roaming the floors constantly with an infinite supply of skewered options so be on the lookout. Your meat will be prepared the way you want it and all you have to do is ask. An endless supply of delicious bread balls of happiness are sent to your table along with fried bananas and mash potatoes. Honorable mention also goes to the best salad bar potentially in Las Vegas. Lobster bisque, an assortment of cheeses and excellent couscous are just a small part of their master operation. Yes, even the palace of steaks caters to those that prefer lettuce. 

Desserts are beyond good. The Brazilian Cheesecake is an addiction made manifest. The Brazilian Papaya Creme is a good back up option and of course Creme Brulee if you must. During this Bazaar of Beef be sure to order a Brazilian soda purely because they exist and need to be consumed.

A solid five stars, teetering on the border of four and a half because I aspire for the rankings of Michael Kors, this establishment combines the diadem of service etiquette with an affluent diversity of cuisine, fulfilling both the hedonistic propensity of meat lovers and a conscience for the vegetarian diet. 

Let's talk about the controversial matter peppered with bon mots -- pricing is fifty for those who identify as Indominus and half for those who get asked ""if you were stranded on an island, would you eat coconut palms or a cow,"" as if an organism exists in such ecology. This is Las Vegas. If you're pooling sweat over these rates, you might want to get a refund for that three-step easy online degree in geography and start your career in anthropomorphic fur-suit construction. You have come to this city in a pre-mediated agenda: to market yourself as some uber-chic cliché, re-create the events of the Hangover through an arrangement of poorly taken Snapchats, or maybe to meet someone with silicon implants for the first time; but, most of all, to drop a wallet like Beyonce drops an album out of nowhere. So, yes, you can swipe your card with impunity. Don't act like you haven't fed the slot machines your latest paycheck. There's no judgement here.

Normally, I'm against the American restaurant normative that will slaughter anything that walks on at least two legs -- I'm sure you've read Upton Sinclair before -- but unlike your typical factory chain, Texas de Brazil stands proud with a classy ambiance and setting. A giant chandelier, seen in the Old Hollywood Silent Noir; the qualities of a wine-house combined with an exclusive air of upper-class; a secretive bathroom, whose sinks are the definition of pretentious -- they're like vases. It makes Olive Garden look like a pathetic hole in the wall, so this ambiance is part of the price you're paying. After all, I bet their electric bill has two commas. 

Now, I won't be shoving words into the mouthes of the carnivores because I know for a fact that they'll be shoving in slabs after slabs of thick, juicy meat. Talk about umami -- you can let it sit in your mouth and enjoy the flavor as the meat keeps coming and coming. For those who need a basic run-down of the protocol, I'll do you a solid: servers, with huge, thick, long, well-cooked, and lathered sticks of meat will walk by you and ask if you want a piece. Ooh la la. Swipe right on everything but the parmesan chicken -- I've heard it's salty in flavor, but to each their own taste, am I right? Now, if you're giving up after your second cut, the secret 411 is that some drone will abduct you and drop you off to a detox center where you'll realize how much money and meat you've wasted. After all, Area 51 is close by. The servers are relentless and will stop at nothing to make sure you've gotten your fill. To illustrate this phenomena, our large party of around twenty five followed the family tradition of prayer -- we have to be grateful, obvi. As I've learned in Screenwriting 101, sub-text is everything. And as we harmoniously prayed about the Lamb of God, servers brought freshly cooked lamb to the table.

To discuss the politics of omnivores yet evade vegetarians is offensive in every right. The coined term salad bar does not do justice to what is provided. Yes, there is salads -- in about three to four different variations; carbohydrates in all of their glory; seafood; and whatever else you want, they probably have it. Cool beans, right? A temperate ambiance, relative position to the Las Vegas scene, service, and the food combines to make a five star experience in Texas de Brazil.

Coming from someone who rarely eats red meat, it's delicious here! Totally worth the $50 a person. We went to eat here for my boyfriends birthday, when we got there the hostess asked if we were there for a birthday or anniversary and we said yes (since they asked I thought they were going to sing or something.. haha) once they sit you they explain everything.. which was still confusing! But you get up and go to the main dining room and get what you want, buffet style. Their sides, soups (lobster bisque in specific) mash potatoes, banana to cleanse your pallet between meats, papaya parfait are delicious! I tired so many different types of red meats, and chicken! The meat just melts in your mouth! The waitress wasn't too attentive but it wasn't a big deal. Overall, I would come here again!",nAcxTvKQ2OLJSVvHkVeR8Q,0,0,5,ONrat6t6aiYqgdBoU-igkA

The best salad bar ever & great quality food. Everything tasted fresh. The selection at the salad bar was exquisite. This is a great restaurant to bring family for a special occasion or for a romantic dinner. Great service & wonderful atmosphere.,Nx92PCdA8C5CMnswCz2Cqg,0,0,5,In9WH1Pyoz89dfrmW4NvEQ
3772867,2015-08-12,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"Why go:  
Because you love amazing Brazilian BBQ and aren't afraid to pay for it.  

What did I put in my mouth:
While there was great variety in the meats and cuts, I enjoyed the house special, Picanha, and Garlic Picanha.  The Alcatra was on par as well.  Sides are buffet style such as sauteed mushrooms, lobster bisque, salad bar, or jasmine rice.  Complimentary garlic mashed potatoes and cheese bread was equally tasty and welcome.  If it wasn't for Aria's buffet that we ate 6 hours earlier, I'm sure we would have put more of the meat down.  

What did it cost:
It's not Hometown Buffet so expect to pay some $$.  It was around $50 mark but for the quality and quantity of food, it is well worth it.  Play hard, eat hard.  

How was the service:
Lola was on point.  A hallmark of any good server is water never dips below half for too long and we are checked on if we are enjoying ourselves.  The servers with the meat skewers were fast to the table and variety abounds.  

This is one of those places that I say I would go to more if it were closer but that's all BS.  It's a special little spot that is reserved when I can make it to Vegas because it's not in California.  I love Fogo, but this place edges it out.  While the buffets in Vegas are great, there's really nothing quite like exceptional Rodizio.....trust me when I say you won't disappointed....",4Jr81-Bon3cYrVBEWd1i8w,3,1,5,SELveXQbm1E3XTKCtl0anw
3775923,2016-01-12,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"I gave this restaurant a 4 star review because of how great the service and the food was. My husband is Brazilian and we have spent a good deal of time in Brazil. This was very similar to steak houses in Brazil.

It was a little rushed with how quickly the meat kept coming out, but you have the green and red signals to let them know if they should stop at your table or not so you can pace yourself.

I ordered a mango caipirinha and that was the only aspect of the food/drink I was disappointed with. I generally don't order caipirinhas in the states because they don't come with muddled fruit, but the menu said it was made that way so I took a chance. They actually muddle lime (which I thought was strange since it was a fruit caipirinha) and then they put the fruit juice on top of it. That was the only thing I wouldn't recommend here.

The reason I am rating this restaurant lower than a five and considered a three was the level of noise. There was a big group in the back that was cheering and screaming for the majority of our meal. It was a little bit like having dinner in a noisy Chuck E Cheese. I could tell we weren't the only table disappointed that we were not able to hear anything except the big party. My disappointment wasn't as much with the fact the party was being disruptive, but that no one came around to apologize and it didn't seem like anything was being done to make sure the rest of the guests were still able to enjoy their meals.",XP-w46ubFjuLp1XXpp82Lg,2,0,4,qb26KE24TThCJHozilPWsw
3783598,2016-12-04,1,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"Amazing food and service. Our waiter Wesley was very attentive and made sure our experience was great. 

My friend had made a reservation for 5:30PM and we arrived a little bit earlier and only waited for about 5 minutes. Since it was my first time here, Wesley took the time to explain to me how everything works. You have a small double-sided card that is colored red on one side and green on the other. Red means no more meats, green means give me more. The meat servers are constantly walking around checking each table.

There is also a salad bar which consist of their daily soup, which was lobster bisque that night, a ton of sides, and a giant cheese wheel of grand padano (my favorite cheese :D) they also had some dried meats like salami and prosciutto.

Now for the meats! They are generally served medium rare but if you have a preference you can just tell them and they will make it for you. My favorite had to be the beef ribs. Pretty much anything that was beef lol. I couldn't remember the specific names of the other meats but the beef rib was very memorable Oh my gosh it literally melted in my mouth, I think I was like drooling oil from it lol. I also really enjoyed the sausage and parmesan crusted chicken! Everything was just so delicious. Also, they give you some cheese-filled bread balls, garlic mashed potatoes and fried plantains to clean your palate so you can taste everything better. I think I was the only one among our group who destroyed those garlic mashed potatoes.

They have the best steak in town and the smartest set up around.

The salad bar is a free for all and has such things as cheesy potatoes, sushi, a bacon bowl, rice, veggies, etc.

We were promptly seated and our waiter was there quickly to fill our water glasses. Each person is given a button with a green side and a red side. Green means more food and red means stop. 

The wine list leaves much to be desired. After looking at the choices I couldn't find anything remotely sweet (even a white zin would have done, I didn't need moscato or anything). I was told Pinot Grigio was the sweetest they had?! 

The decor and atmosphere felt very upscale and classy. 
After giving a drink order you can get up and go to the ""salad bar"". So this salad bar is not merely a salad bar. It had various soups, meats, cheeses, and stuff that I couldn't even guess on what it was. I stuck with a romaine lettuce salad with ranch (can't go wrong there) and some deli meat, grilled provOlone, and crackers. All of which were very fresh and tasty. 

After returning to the table, the meats start coming around. And they KEEP coming around. The meats were all very good but some were chewy and less tender than I'd expect from a place like this. The filet was absolutely delicious as was the garlic sirloin!

Also at times the waiters came by so quickly that there was no way you could have stopped them for the meat if you wanted to. This became frustrating as it could be a while before that meat came around again. 

For dessert I ordered the cheesecake per our waiter's recommendation and OH MY GOODNESS. It was the best cheesecake I've ever had. Definitely recommend!

I used to eat here at least twice a month. It's ALWAYS busy every time I go. However, week nights are not as busy compared to weekends. Make sure you call to reserve a table ahead of time! Or you can go online to make reservations.

In the salad bar, my favorites are the cucumber/onion salad and the au gratin potatoes. Tip: don't fill up on the salad bar if you plan on trying/eating a lot of the meats!

The servers bring each table a basket of cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and caramelized bananas. The cheese bread is good. So good, in fact, that my boyfriend wanted to go here JUST to fill up on the cheese bread. The potatoes were good as well, but it doesn't beat the au gratin potatoes that are offered at the salad bar. And the bananas are to be eaten in between meats because it's said to clear the taste pallet, so you're not mixing the tastes of the meats. But I just eat them up because they're really tasty.

There are a variety of meats (beef, lamb, pork, chicken, sausage, etc) and it's easy to get overwhelmed when you get offered half a dozen meats in a matter of minutes. My favorite will always be the house special: the picahna. It has some fat around the edges, which is my favorite part because it's PACKED with flavor. I always ask if they can cut multiple slices for me.

If you actually have room for dessert, I recommend the creme brulee. It's easily the BEST creme brulee I've ever had in my life.

My favorite part about Texas de Brazil is that the servers come around the tables and ask if there's a specific meat request you have. Within a few minutes, you'll have someone with that meat right at your table. 

It is about $50 a person, but it is definitely worth every penny for the amount you eat, all the delicious flavors you experience, and the amazing service you receive.",2j1LhP97p3CtaA11oP5X4w,2,0,5,rw3vAB8YcOHyVM9gq2gVDg

Service: Amazing how consistent the service has been considering it's always packed at just about every visit.
They get you started quickly with the bread, garlic mashed potatoes and fried sweet bananas within 7 minutes of sitting down.  Waters are filled, drink orders are taken and you're off.  You don't have to worry about

Food: Consistently on point!

Salad Bar: The creamy lobster bisque, doesn't actually have lobster in it.  BUT I love it, I start each visit with the bisque and end it with the bisque when I'm full af. Yes, that's weird.  Slabs of goat cheese, jalapenos and asparagus tips is what I throw down with the meats.  It amazes me how everything here is always high quality and fresh.

Meats: The presentation of the waiters bringing around the slabs of meat is always fun to me, like Disneyland.  Some meats have better days than others, but these are my favs.
Filet Mignon - Medium rare is the only way I roll.
House Sirloin - Usually get this 3 times if they have it.
Lamb Chops - Lamb can be messed up quickly if not prepared right, always good here.
Pork Ribs - Always juicy, with too much fat sometimes.  Which I actually like, ugh. lol
Flank Steak - Seems to always be the first meat on the plate? I don't mind
Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin - If not careful, this can come out dry. But so good when it's not!

Value: $49.99 (dinner) for AYCE meat brings me pretty good value imo.  Coupled with the amazing salad bar, totally gets us home.

Ambiance: High quality utensils and plates are utilized as you're cutting meat all day.  Tables, are packed tight but not to hinder travel throughout the restaurant.  It's going to be noisy because it's always packed but still a great place for a date to have conversation.  Classy atmosphere that puts you in a good mood to eat massively =)

Summary: I usually save this place to bring visiting guests who don't have a texas de brazil or haven't experienced this type of dining.  At the same time, it's great place to just get down when you're looking to get your alpha carnivore on.",AyjqBovADgbskmLrIBOMlQ,3,0,4,iR1IuiwyE3KxTxz2-oML-w

Once we arrived I was excited to dig and enjoy some  great food, unfortunately my son fell sick and started throwing up before I could eat anything, as a concerned mother my focus was to get my child to urgent care. I told my husband to pay the bill while I took our child to the car, well they still charged for me even though I didn't eat anything. I called back the following week explained the situation and if just for me since I was not able to eat that I could get a voucher for me to come back. the manager said they would have to get back to me because they needed to talk to the waiter, i never received a call back. I then had to call back the next day to be told that the manager i spoke to was gone for the day. I called back again had to explain my story to another manager just to be told that I should have talked to a manager the night every thing happened and the best they could do is give me 20 percent off. Like hellloo my child was sick, did you really expect me to wait for a manager to show up while my child kept throwing. And on top of that when we were seated it took 20 minutes before our waiter came, and that was after someone had to go find him and let him know he had a table. overall it was a bad experience during the dinner and bad customer service addressing my complaint after.",EXNxtzBvVFdRq_0dyq6LQg,0,0,1,io7EMgAB7Hl14Tqa2MlNKw

Lobster bisque was alright, nothing to brag about.  You want lobster bisque go to Joes Stone at Caesars, they make it at your table.  Cheeses and cold cuts were very good, mash potatoes good. The meats:  lucky filet wrapped in bacon was our first try. Filet was good but bacon was all fat.  Lamb and their signature sirloin for both tough and tough to cut / chew.  We stuck with Filet which was very good but all their meats are on salty side.  Other Brazilian places include seafood or shrimps but not here.  Desert is not included either.

This was our first time in.  My wife eats no meat and still Texas de Brazil's salad bar full of  delightful cheeses, shrimp salad, tabbouleh,  lobster bisque, a variety of roasted and grilled vegetables, sushi, smoked salmon and other salad items kept her happy and contented.  Additional sides, like potatoes au gratin, yucca, rice, and sautéed mushrooms are available in, yes you guessed it, an endless supply.

As you return to your table and begin to dine on your salad bar choices, you enjoy not one waiter, but many as the ""Passadors"" who are constantly walking the restaurant with giant skewers of meat brought to your table and carved table side continually ask if you would care for whatever they are carrying.  The endless supply of meats include Parmesan encrusted chicken, pork tenderloin, barbecue ribs, a spicy chicken breast, lamb chops, venison, sausages, plain or bacon wrapped filet mignon, chicken drumsticks and bacon wrapped chicken.   The passadors come often and with delicious varieties of meats, seasoned to perfection and done to whatever temperature you might desire.

The meal includes select drinks and dessert if you have any room left.  Service is fast and impeccable.  The environment is upscale and casual offering very comfortable seating.

First, let me say the attitude and the service of the staff is very good, and would merit 4 stars.
The server was constantly checking on the table and made sure that all would be enjoying the meats of their choice, prepared as requested. But there is more to it than great service when judging a Brasilian Style churrascaria.

Sad to say that more isn't always better. I found the meat to be inferior in quality, portion, and preparation. Since a Churrascaria is ""all you can eat"", expect to find very average buffet quality meats. Don't expect you are going to enjoy the same quality of Steak Place, such as Morton's, The Palm, or Del Frisco's. 

Think of the experience at Texas de Brasil, as dining at ""rich man's"" Golden Corral. 

I give the food 2 Stars. Therefore, 4 star service and 2 star food, average out to be a 3, and considering dinner is about $50 per person, that 3 is a generous rating.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,3,1,3,gU-D3-kU0zuGUu3vhzlDyw

My first tip is to eat here for lunch or brunch on a weekend. It's cheaper than dinner and having been here for dinner I can't find a difference in the foods offered. 

The salad bar is good enough to make a meal. That is coming from a meat fan. The salad bar has much more than the average salad bar. It includes smoked salmon, assorted cheeses, several veggie salads, fruit salads, lobster bisque, and sushi. I also find it hard to resist filling up on just the salad bar. 

Before the meal the server will bring out plantains, mashed potatoes, and cheddar biscuits. All of the above are delicious and yet another temptation I have to resist before the meat arrives. The plantains are my favorite! 

The first time I came here I thought that the meat would be abundant, but mediocre quality. I was completely wrong. The meats are actually delicious and well seasoned. The variety should please all tastes too. They offer parmesan chicken, several cuts of steak, lamb, and sausage. The steaks are my favorite meats. 

The service is very attentive. Someone is always at the table offering meat or refilling drinks. The servers are always really good about getting certain meats to the table if you have a preference. On one visit my husband ordered a cocktail that he didn't care for, nothing was wrong with the drink. Our waitress noticed he didn't drink it and insisted on taking the drink off of the bill. We never expected this or asked her to do this, but that to me is great service.

The salad bar was good. I loved the peppers and prosciutto.   The green pea dish was great.  I also liked the spicy peppers but careful they are very hot.

Definitely try the lobster bisque so smooth and velvety. I didn't eat anything else off the hot bar but the mashed potatoes on the table were also very smooth.

The food is 4 star but the reason for my 3 was my table. They wedged me in a table right at the front 5 feet from checkin it was like dining in the lobby and it was pretty rude.  I'm not sure I will go back if that is how they're going to treat guests that aren't the large parties they seem to cater to.",ldSocJvfHDBX5491WNcjVg,0,0,3,JQDfdzqsvpt6OaluAToVew

We didn't try the salad bar because, well, why would we? . I'm there for MEAT!!!!  We did, however, leave room for dessert. We selected a beautiful citrus vanilla Creme brûlée. Oh my...it was heaven. Definitely will visit again. We will at least try the one that's about 1 1/2 hours from our home.

The full dinner price is around $50 +tax and I think it's cheap for the unlimited meat you get!! The service is great except for the hostess... she couldn't smile not once. I asked her a simple question and she was a little rude. And I guess she tried to ""make up"" for it when she told me one dish had lobster (which is the soup). Also, she briefly explained the cocktail menu and asked if we have been here before. We said yes. Then she asked my boyfriend if he needed an explanation of the menu. He said no because we know how it works and she goes, ""Well Im going to explain it anyway."" Excuse you??? And I thought maybe she wasn't having it at the time she sat us, but she sat a party behind us and even gave them attitude. Hostess is an important job. You are the first face of the restaurant and that means first impression. I would seriously give this place 3 stars because of her!! I am BIG on customer service. If the service is trash, I wouldn't come back no matter how great the food is. BUT! Our server Jay (his name was more difficult and he told us to call him Jay) was SOOOO nice and kind. He was attentive and I liked that. He smiled the whole time he was explaining things to us. He was just amazing really. He will make this experience great!

The salad bar has variety of different veggies and side dishes to choose from. There's even rice and soup off to the side of the bar. I haven't tried the soup but their salami and grape salad is great! The cheese is rich in flavor and overall a good taste. But save room for the meat that goes around! It's kind of entertaining to watch these people walk around with the huge stick with meat on it! They offer meats such as: lamb, different steaks, & chicken. And the size portions aren't too large so you can try different things! Pretty decent place & i would definitely come back!!",0wWhRqX2UC1qFp5sFJm48A,1,0,4,S0BDg00vm0VKb3SX4whU7Q

You have to request the House Picana (Sirloin) and Beef Rib served on a silver platter for sure and often. Everything on the menu for me is tasty and prepared to your likings (rare to well done), and don't be afraid to let the waiters know, and your meal and experience will be well worth the price! The desserts especially the chocolate layer mouse cake is very good also. Make sure you take the time to make a reservation because this place will get packed really fast!

The salad bar is packed with tasty sides to go with your meal. My favorites are the grilled pineapple , shrimp, quinoa, potato salad, tabbouleh, lobster bisque, and marinated mushrooms. I'll usually pair the pineapple with the shrimp so I can get the sweet and savory taste. They also place these fresh tiny pieces of bread that taste like cheez its on the table.

Every drink I ordered took about 15 mins to come out and I had to ask to for my water to be refilled. We also didn't get to have nearly as many meats come around nor did anyone explain to us that we could request specific cuts to come around. There also was supposed to be strict drink ordering options of wine, beer or wells, but other tables were offered anything they wanted. At least keep it uniform across the whole room. 

As for the food I was only able to dine at the salad bar being a pescatarian, but there were quite a few decent options. I enjoyed the Cesar salad, smoked salmon, goat cheese and the roasted mushrooms.

Since it was a Monday there wasn't much of a wait.  By the time I returned from using the restroom our table was ready.  I didn't particularly like the seating as it was right behind the host station but for being seated that quickly (and being very hungry) I let it slide.  Next time I'll ask for a seat in the back. The only real negative I have us that the entry/exit doors are extremely heavy.  If that's the worst thing about a place in my book that's easily 5 stars.  

We started out with the salad bar and a few of my favorite things were the goat cheese,  green beans and au gratin potatoes.  I also really enjoyed the potato salad which is not something I'm usually fond of.  

The meats!  Oh the meats!  I tried chicken wrapped in bacon,  chicken parmesian, filet wrapped in bacon,  sirloin steak,  flank steak and sausage.  Everything was delicious.  The sausage has a slight kick to it which was a nice change of pace. The filet wrapped in bacon was a little on the salty side but that didn't stop me from finishing it.  The flank steak and sirloin steak were melt in your mouth delicious.  The chicken options were good but I'm more of a red meat person so they don't really stand out as I'm writing this. 

We were stuffed full and asking for the check when our server Sue gave us comment cards and mentioned future discounts (of course we took the bait). I found this practice slightly odd for what seemed to be an upscale place.  I asked if we were able to get any discounts this time because we were celebrating our engagement anniversary and she offered us the cheesecake and even wrapped it to go for us.

The beef rib and the picante were the best.  My friends had the lamb and lamb chop, and the lamb chop was over cooked.  We stuff to the beef.  More choices came out as we were finished with our meal.

Also, the salad and hot bar station had some interesting stuff like lobster bisque and some kind of Brazilian fish stew, etc.

Come prepared to eat because there is just so much food. 

Service is ok. It's just so crowded in here that it's hard to hear and they come around so fast with the meat that you barely have time to make a decision.

4726152,2016-04-19,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"This was my 2nd time at this restaurant! My 1st time was for a birthday party for a friend and there were about 15 of us! 
Prices - $49 per person or $25 for salad/soup bar only
Drinks - we had a beer $6 and a glass of wine $11

The food at the salad/soup bar area is always very fresh and very good! The service our 1st time here was amazing but I'm thinking that's because a lot of people were ordering drinks and tipping very well! 

The reason for my 3 stars is because of our 2nd time here, which was a date night for the hubby and myself that we had made prior reservations for and when we arrived we were told that it would be a minute for our table... A minute turned into about 20 minutes and then when we were brought to our table we were basically shoved into a back corner on a tiny table against a wall where we sat facing each other! I could not even get out of my chair without bumping into the people at the table beside ours! It also was a little frustrating because there was very little plate space, which each person gets 2 (one for the salad bar & one for your meats). Definitely was not enough room for 4 plates, our 2 drinks, the appetizer bananas and mashed potatoes they bring you... Along with a basket of rolls. 
Also, we kept getting skipped by the meat servers bc I honestly don't think they could even see us. 
I feel the servers cater more to the larger parties.

As far as price, it is a great price for the amount and quality of food as long as you can eat a lot! For someone like myself who can only eat a salad, a side or 2, and one steak filet... I could go to a fine restaurant and get just the same thing if not a little better for less. My husband loves it though, he can eat much more, so the fact that he can have steak, chicken, pork, lamb, etc in the same sitting is great!

I do recommend this restaurant for the quality of food and the experience of you have never been somewhere like this. Just be sure to come with an appetite.
I do not recommend this for a party of only 2... It was very uncomfortable!",VCrpOdCjkLZkgoW_CNli2g,1,1,3,a1XP9l4krSKeUNHK8PM8_Q

I normally dine in whenever I come here.  But now that i have a rambunctious 1 year old that can't sit still and climbs out of his high chair every second he gets a chance, it makes it so hard to enjoy a meal. 

So I decided to try take out.  I ordered a pound of garlic  picanha & a pound of the flank steak.  

I was highly disappointed.  Both cuts of meat tasted so bland, no flavor just the beefy taste.  Not at all like what they should taste like when you dine in.  For $18 dollars a pound i could have grilled up some steak on my grill at home and probably get a better result.

4822124,2015-07-26,3,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"The two star is for the horrible seating arrangements we keep getting, AND the pitiful apologies that the ""managers"" give.  The food has always been an easy 5 star.  This opening mirrors my Jan 2015 review, and as you can see seating still sucks.  This time though, in addition to the small seating arrangements, we had a ""party"" going on next to us.  The unfortunate thing is that we were already half way through our meals, and to move just would have been too inconvenient.  

Now we are all for a good time, but these inconsiderate hyenas were just awful.  They were a table of 8 with one girl who just had a LOUD, echoing, irritating laugh that would fill the whole back area.  I mean every table around us just kept looking over at them like, ""REALLY?!""  At one point, I complained to the waitress who said she would tell a manager.  Well whether that happened or not, the hyenas just kept on like they were at a beer bust.  Why the manager did not go over (as I'm sure there were other complaints) is beyond me.  But that's what continues to bring on ratings such as mine.  The only other complaint is that I never got my bacon wrapped filet after asking 4 times!  Whatever.  

We have been coming here for years.  We also bring our clients and their families several times a month.  Our parties would range from 8-16 every time.  As the years have gone by, the accommodating service has gone to the wayside.  My chief complaint is that they always try to seat more people than the table setting can handle.  For instance, 8 people on a 6 people setting with 2 people seated to the outside.  Well anyone that has eaten here knows that there is NO ROOM for people to eat like that.  I mean it is very uncomfortable and crowded once food starts coming.  Each time I explain this to the managers, I get the same excuse that they are booked and that's all that they have.  On one occasion, I  asked that they add a table and was told that they couldn't do that.  As I started to take my party out to leave, the manager came over and said that they would just add a table.  Really?  It take that to accommodate your patrons?

Sadly, we will no longer bring our clients to enjoy your food.  My family will still come because the food is awesome.  We will just crunch together and be uncomfortable.",0krIXTM-fNED7ozGt11UmQ,5,3,2,Wp4pnUeWS9ITJAvp_7pxrg

No better way to celebrate a birthday than stuffing yourself silly with mouth watering meats and everything in between. TDB is a carnivore's paradise, from filet mignon to flank steak to lamb chops and leg of lamb the list goes on and on but I have to say the top sirloin steak is my favorite. The salad bar and sides alone are worth coming for but of course the meats are the stars of the show. There's nothing much to add to what's already been uttered again and again about this place being good, it's one of those places you just have to try for yourself at least once. 

For me personally, I never get my moneys worth at AYCE places so for next time, Friday lunch (they're only open Fri-Sun for lunch) at about $33 would probably be my best bet. According to our server Adam (who by the way was awesome!!!) There's only a few item difference in the salad bar area between lunch and dinner, but as far as the meat goes it's the same line up. Food, ambiance and service was all on point which makes it a 5 star experience.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,8,4,5,uvJYenHGEJ9mMGt3WdPQJA

My wife is a vegetarian so she ate from their salad bar. She has been vomiting every hour or so since midnight. I ate mostly from the cooked meat selections and I am fine but she is VERY sick. Think twice about eating anything there that is with cream/mayonnaise (potato salad, lobster bisque, etc.) I would stick with vegetables and meat only. This is no reflection on then wait staff (our waitress Paula for instance is awesome). VERY disappointed, we won't be returning.

Update #1: I called the restaurant on 4/6/17 and spoke to the general manager. He was 100% unfazed that we are VIP card carrying customers nor that we are regular customers. They are going to ""conduct an internal investigation"" and they have refused any sort of compensation for our $100+ dinner.

Great way to treat loyal customers, don't you think?

Update #2: My wife is running a temperature of 101 now.

Update #3: ""Tim"" (no last name) from Texas De Brazil's corporate office called me and said because no one else has reported an illness yet, this is an isolated incident and oh, yeah, I hope your wife feels better.",d44mCiCiv41bCYLSkHBqlw,1,0,1,IHdIhvSmLKaqt_bnZMkokA

This place has good service it has great food and an amazing ambiance.

My friends and I came here just for a normal dinner. Starting from the beginning of our dinner until the end, the waiters and meat carvers were professional and courteous. Whenever we requested for anything they always followed through. There wasn't a single instance where we asked for a meat to come and it didn't come. We also had special requests such as rare filet mignon or rare lamb and it always came!

As for their food, the meats were cooked to perfection! Their cuts were always juicy and flavorful. My personal favorite was the house social and the one that comes on a big plate. My friends really enjoyed their rare filet mignon. The salad bar was well stocked with both warm foods and cold salads. I fell in love with their potatoes au gratin.

When he saw we were choosing a bottle of wine he gave great suggestions and let us know they had a special with 50% off a second bottle which was a great deal! They had a good range of options ranging from $35 on up, very reasonable prices.

Of course the meat was the star and fantastic as always. So many choices! All very well cooked. And the salad bar was terrific too. Definitely try the lobster bisque if it's available.

As a final nice touch the waiter offered the desserts and they do a little extra for birthdays. I chose an amazing cheesecake with chocolate on the bottom, caramel on top and they had the plate nicely decorated with happy birthday written in chocolate.

This place is wonderful to host a dinner a party, because everyone can find something they love; between the salad bar, the soup bar, the meats, and dessert this place is surely a crowd pleasure. 

However, I will say that this place can become very crowded and you must submit the exact number of people in your party, because if you must add an additional person at the last minute, this restaurant is not willing to accommodate the change. Lastly, if you are celebrating a special event, make sure you keep any birthday cakes, balloons, rings, or any special celebration enhancements with you as they will charge you a $15.00 holding fee (which I have never heard of before in my life), but they do.

He said how about the carmelize raw sugar from Brazil, my reply bring out the Brazilian dancers and that'll really sweeten the dessert.  He and his other female co-workers just started busting up.

The meat choices were endless and I loved the top sirloin and everything that was bacon wrapped! Try everything that comes around even if you think your full.

The meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. By far the best meat of any churrascaria. The salad bar had excellent cheese, meats, vegetables, soups, and salads as expected. The popover-like rolls and plantains were good. The only disappointment were the mashed potatoes.
Service was very good, and the servers passed as soon as we turned over our cards and asked if we wanted a specific meat. It's impressive when service is good when we opt to not order beverages.",t3Ojr4p6suHxc5A3Yx4hWA,1,0,5,SAMZpocKz-1wheNUAjaWgQ

I don't like it dripping blood, so I tell the server I like it medium and he will come back with medium. supposedly there are 17 kinds of meats, I am not sure I've seen all 17, but we have our favorites. picahna, garlic sirloin, flank steak, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb chops that tops our lists, oh and the sausage! always have to have one of those!

There is a huge salad bar that you could easily fill up on, and if you aren't a meat eater, it will be your meal. A friend who dined with us  once said, that only amateurs fill their plates with salad, because you will have no room for meat.  it's true, but who can resist? I love the bacon pieces they have on the bar. I'll usually get some romaine with blue cheese dressing and bacon pieces. mind you, they aren't bits! I also like to eat them with the cheese bread that comes on the table with mashed potatoes and fried bananas. those fried bananas are another favorite.  we sometimes forgo dessert for another plate of bananas. on the occasion that we can get a dessert for free, we usually get creme brulee  (hubby) key lime (me) and cheesecake or bananas foster pie just depends on the mood.

The best deal about this place used to be the BOGO if you had a birthday or anniversary.  you'd have to sign up for the eclub. but they stopped doing that for couple years now  now they have the dining card for 12 half price meals for $59.99. money goes to charity and they usually come out in March and you have until September to use it up. We've gotten one for the last few years and it's such a great deal. we always say maybe we need to buy 2, but that never happens because sometimes we aren't home for the summer months at a time, and so we end up having to eat there once a week, which is ALOT of meat!",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,0,0,5,OJwTFfPAfMK9Yshwxj3e0w

We were gonna be in town for several days for a bachelor party and I had called to reserve a table for 10. I signed up for their online newsletter and it alerted me to them having private rooms available. I inquired about that and Natasha said we could have that room for our party as it was not reserved yet. I called about 2 months prior to our weekend in Vegas. I even asked Natasha if the room would be able to handle a couple of more people as our party number might fluctuate closer to the date. She assured me that the room is spacious enough to hold up to 50 and it was all ours. Awesome! Well, the weekend came around and on the day of our dinner reservation I got a call to confirm. I called back and did so. No word of any issues, so I didnt worry... Problem was when I got there, I was told by the hostess and later by the manager that the private room wasnt available as it had been booked already but Natasha wasnt aware. Hmmm... Really?? Now you tell me?... Sounds fishy. Sounds like you booked a bigger party in that room and bumped us. I wasnt told that but I'm not a fool. All they needed to do was ask me and I wouldve given up that room to the bigger party. No problem. Instead I was given a lame excuse that I wasnt buying. A nice establishment like this, and they dont have all their reservations synched?? C'mon now! Anyways, that was not cool... And I had to tell the story. The manager was apologetic and promised to give us a table kind of off to the side and we kinda did. It was whatever by then...We were hungry and we were seated.

The food was great. All the cuts of meat we had were delicious. The various cuts of beef, chicken & pork were great. I really liked the bacon wrapped filet.The brazilian sausage was delish. Pork ribs I missed out on but I heard they were great. Bacon wrapped chicken was also good. Parmesan crusted pork loin was tasty. Flank steak was delicious.The herb-marinated pork loin was also good. Meat wasted for sure. The salad and sides bar was good. I liked the charcuterie. The prosciutto was good with bread and cheese. The string beans and garlic mash was great. But the true star was the LOBSTER BISQUE. I had heard about this greatness for a while and it lived up to the hype. So good. You will want to have bowl and bowls of it. Yumm.

Service was attentive. They were always around offering us the different cuts of beef, clearing our dishes and refilling our drinks. The only issue was with our reservation. Had to deduct a star for that. I considered deducting more but the experience otherwise was great. Like I said, I signed up for their online newsletter and timing was with us as I got an email giving parties of up to 10 to be given $10 off each person making it $40 instead of $50 for dinner. (Mon-Thurs). Cool beans. We were there on a Thursday night so it was perfect. I suggest signing up. 

I plan on eating there again the next time we're in town. I will make reservations again. I hope that aspect is far improved on the next trip. Lobster bisque!!",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,5,3,4,hJNunzYLJgFqm9-d4S2qeg

First let me say the food is good. Meats are cooked to perfection and the salad bar is extensive and refreshing. The salads, cheeses, and lobster bisque are all of high quality, and seasoned perfectly. 

However, the last time we went to Texas de Brazil I was greeted by a rude hostess who had no interest in accommodating a simple request (a table on the side of the Restaraunt so my children did not interrupt anyone else's meal). So when the waiter came around, I asked to be moved and the gracious waitstaff accommodated us. I simply want to be courteous to other diners and not interrupt someone else's good time if my children get restless.

The food was excellent, and so was the service. Our waiter was attentive and provided every special request of meat that we asked for. I was not expecting what came next...

Prices: I was expecting $45 a plate for adults, $5 for my 10 year old, and no charge for my 6 and 2 year olds, just as the snotty hostess told us. What I got when I looked at the receipt was $50 a plate for the adults, $25 for my 10 year old, and $5 each for my 6 and 2 year olds. That is not including drinks or dessert. I asked the waiter why the tab was so off, and he stated the prices had been raised. I was not advised of this, and the hostess specifically gave me different numbers. 

I paid and left. I didn't even want to both with speaking to management because I was so disgusted with the hostesses attitude and lack of knowledge which cost me an additional $45. The food is good. The overall experience is good, but Fogo de Chao gets an additional 2 stars for at least having competent, professional, and POLITE staff.",ShPNNs-sbMvrjTT0BuPvcA,1,1,3,1_doANt4qfdcDvXDjODERQ

Service: 10/10
Price: 7/10
Atmosphere: 8/10

Texas de Brazil is simply amazing. It is a Brazilian Steakhouse  meaning that you have about 7-10 selections of meat to pick from in various styles (rare-well-done). The meat is carried on skewers and hand cut from the skewer right to your plate. 

The food is awesome. The selections include beef, lamb, chicken and pork. There are also additional items that get added on every few months. But lets be honest you are really going for the steak, which is perfect because you literally have every part of the cow to choose from. I would recommend the garlic sirloin, flank steak, and of course the top sirloin. If you don't like meat don't worry, there is also a salad bar with options ranging from salad to soup to sushi. I usually don't deal with that area too much (gotta save room for the meat lol) but I've only heard good things.

The waiters/ waitresses are awesome and take really good care of you while you're there, providing excellent suggestions as well as giving you information about the whole experience. (RACHEL IS THE BEST!!) The gauchos are super nice and will even ask if you have any special requests once they see that your aren't selecting the meats that have come by. If you say yes, you are the first to receive the meat and it is cooked in whichever style you prefer. 

Finally, the biggest knock on Texas de Brazil is the price. Yes, it is $50 per person but you do get unlimited meat and unlimited salad bar access for as long as you wish so it really pays for itself. The experience, food, and service are well worth it and you definitely wouldn't regret spending a family/date night at Texas de Brazil",k_V-E5TksMJDvqnr1VfACA,2,1,5,usdh6pwJrb1GKU6_tqb3lQ
5674753,2015-07-09,2,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"I really enjoyed the selection of proteins at Texas De Brazil. The sirloin, skirt steak, and filet mignon were exceptionally moist and tender. However, they were over seasoned with salt so you couldn't taste the quality of the meat. The lamb chops, chicken, and pork were presented as an understatement, however they were some of the best I've had. I wish there was a vegetarian option like tofu and grilled veggies for vegetarians, vegans, etc. 
     The side dishes were mediocre. The cinnamon and sugar plantains didn't marry with the rest of the meal. In fact, it tasted like an overly sweet Starbucks frappiccinno compared to the fatty meat. The mashed potatoes were extremely creamy and buttery, which complemented the lean chicken breast. The bread was a traditional Brazilian bread with cheese. However, it tasted like an boring roll with string cheese from the school cafeteria. 
     For dessert, I ordered the creme brûlée, which I was impatiently waiting for. It tasted intensely of orange (which is never a bad thing) and weirdly enough, MAYO? It also had the texture of chunky sausage gravy. I recommend that the chef whisk more air bubbles into the custard mix, so it becomes more creamy and airy. Even though there were some things wrong with the meal that was served to me today, I will always enjoy the ambience and party scene of Texas De Brazil!",H4maWgOBeeW7xSYu_cYhcg,2,2,2,ZFqa3zGRyrumfZpwgM9qHg

I've been here many times and tried many Brazilian rodizio steakhouses in Vegas and Texas De Brazil ranks near the top.  Great salad bar selection which stays consistent for the most part as I always tend to chose the same sides but not too much since I'm all about the different meats they serve.  The meats are all flavorful and juicy but definitely require many glasses of water due to the salt element of cooking.  Must haves include the picanha, filet mignon, garlic steak, sausage, flank steak and beef ribs served only at dinner and cut from the slab which melts like butter to the cut.  Service is usually pretty good but I did run into one night of mediocre service where I had to tell the server a few times for one type of meat and it still never showed up so I just gave up and was too full anyways.

Last night we had a party of 6 and we are all regulars here. 

Someone in the kitchen went way too heavy with the salt. All of the sides were OVERLY SALTED. my brother is a well to do chef in Las Vegas and I a chef in my own right. He is a lover of salt and me I like my salt just right and even he The Salt king said wow way too salty. The cous cous , the Brazilian bread balls everything but the meat. 

The meat which is usually seasoned so amazingly well went like this salty exterior and unseasoned on the inside. Usually it's a good balance of it all. 

Our server tho very sweet was not as attentive as we would like but we didn't get mad because we saw he had a huge section of tables to cover and in no sequence he was all over the restaurant. 

Why not give servers a specific section so they can maintain our waters. The food was so salty we were dying of thirst. I mean lord. I've never been so unwilling to fork out over $400 at Texas de Brazil hell I've spent well over $2k there for our company. 

Get it together we don't pay a good amount of money to have someone in YOUR KITCHEN who does not know what they are doing. I mean even the Lobster Bisque was inedible because of the levels of salt.",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,4,1,2,awuNznK0h1gCmZKu5j-6gg

I'm glad we weren't too early because I could have went through a few of those, really good.

We got situated at our table. Service was great start to finish. We began with the salad bar. Salad bar is more of a generic description of it. There are so many yummy selections to choose from. Maybe mini buffet is a better description. Here is where the challenge lies though. You're in a Brazilian churrascaria, which means you're there for meat, and do they have the meat. You also want to get your moneys worth. The dinner and drinks add up quickly.

If you make the mistake of trying everything the mini buffet has to offer, then the house wins and you won't be able to get your carnivorous ways on very much, nor your moneys worth. Resist the temptation of sampling a lot of that stuff and get your fill of meat.

A truly world-class meaty experience.  Perfect for a special occasion or date! 

Visited on Saturday 9-24-16 at 6PM.  The wait was about an hour so we hung out in the bar and had some drinks.  The bartender that night was *extremely* generous with his pours.  I'm not much of a drinker and I was soused after 2 drinks.  

Pro tip: If you go to Sam's Club they have a $100 gift card for this place for only $80 bucks.  They have a pretty sweet military discount of 20% off as well so we ended up eating here for like $66.  DEAL! 

After you're seated and order your drinks you're invited to partake in the salad bar.  This ain't no ordinary salad bar...there are many tempting options such as charcuterie meats and cheeses, salads, olives, grilled pineapples, fresh parmesean cheese, sushi, smoked salmon, asparagus, black beans, rice, lobster bisque, cheesy potatoes, mushrooms, and much, much, more.  It's really temping but don't fill up because....

...After you sit down and flip your card over to green the rodizio guys will start parading their meat around for you.  They have lamb, chicken, pork, and every cut of beef that you can think of at any done-ness level.  My personal favorite is the beef ribs...good lord...they are fall-off-the-bone tender.  

I've never had dessert here because I usually gorge myself but I'm sure they're delicious.

I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, so I was excited at the chance to check this place out. We got there before they opened, but they still let us come inside and wait in the A/C until they were ready to go. There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, but we still got to our table quickly and our servers were very patient and friendly as we waited for the rest of our group to get there. One of them offered us some recommendations on the drink menu, and educated us about some of the food items we would be offered as well.
Once everyone arrived, we walked over to the salad bar which had a ton of great options! There were many different vegetables, soups, salads, and other sides. Among the options, some of the things I chose were lobster bisque, asparagus, mushroom salad, roasted peppers, shrimp, smoked salmon, quinoa and squash. I got very small samples of the sides, knowing that there was still a lot of food to come. After we sat back down at the table, we were told to flip our cards over to green whenever we were ready for the different meats. Once you do that, there is a parade of large skewers being brought around by various servers that have some of the best steak, chicken, and pork that you'll ever find in one place! I had bacon wrapped filet, top sirloin, tenderloin, and garlic steak. Every single one was so flavorful and tender. What I also love, is that they bring different steak temperatures around and ask you if you'd like that, or let you know that they'll be bringing around one that is your preferred temperature soon. If they only have something in medium rare, for example, you can also request that it be cooked longer. There were some of the meats that we really enjoyed at our table, and when we asked for extra slices or larger portions, our server did not hold back! He was very generous and happy to come back frequently to bring anything we needed. We got so much food, and it was definitely worth the price!

Super nice customer service.

I will be brief as I see all the 5 Star reviews and I wish I had one to submit. But, unfortunately I can only offer 3 Stars. Here is why.
Yes, the salad bar is nice. Where is the lobster in the supposedly famous lobster bisque soup? There was not a piece of lobster in there, just the creamy base(boo). The meats that are being brought around on big skewers is not very good. Every piece of red meat that I had was very tough to chew. (I will not swallow a piece of meat if it doesn't dissolve in my mouth after 20-30 chews) I had to spit a lot of tough meat out(yuck). Than I decided to try the bacon wrapped chicken..it was dry, and I only ate it after I soaked it up with the mashed potatoes.
So, not to burst the bubble, I just didn't care for it

Will I go back? Sadly no.",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,17,10,3,xT4p-AXGOvbJpQ4RqF2HfA

We go to the buffet area and it just lacks in quality and selection. It is literally a salad bar. If you've ever been to Tucanos Brazilian steakhouse you would know that their buffet has a wide variety. Tucano's has salad, sushi, bread, pastas, and fruit. Texas de brazil just has lettuce and bacon. Then the meat that they served just SUCKED. They barely brought us any steaks! They mostly brought around the lamb, chicken, and sausage...SAUSAGE?! I mean really?! $50 per head and they give me sausage...wtfreak. The steak that they did bring around was either salty or tasted like armpits (or at least what I imagined what it would taste like). Now here's the real kicker...during weekends your meal is supposed to include drink refills and dessert. YES, dessert is included. Did the waitress mention this? NO!!! She straight up left the check on our table and said have a good day!!! Wtheck right?! So we asked if the dessert came with the meal just to make sure and she said yes. Just blows my mind that we have to even ask! Another big problem was the wait. We got there at 1 and didn't leave till 4!! Not because the food was great but because it was so SLOW! Even after we asked to see the dessert menu the waitress went to the table behind us and showed them first! Once we got our order in it literally took 30 mins to get it! Another thing that annoyed me was their bathroom. Can somebody explain to me why a place like this can't fix their restrooms? The doors DID NOT lock!! There was NO toilet seat covers! One sink was broken, the other had no soap, and only one sink worked! Sorry but this place is one big scam!

5822742,2018-02-08,1,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"Ok we came here with a large party to celebrate my niece's 21st birthday while we were in Vegas. My sister chose this place because my niece used to work at Brazilian BBQ restaurant in Portland so I think she picked it. It is just South of the Strip in an outdoor strip mall.

When you walk in, it's definitely a site to behold. Beautiful interior, open space and clean. It's a bit of a different concept, one that I was not used to and was slightly confusing, if I'm being totally honest. You each have a little circular card that has a green side and a red side. You are supposed to put the green side up if you want people to come and offer you some kind of meat, and put the red side up if you need a break. It seemed a bit overwhelming when people kept swooping in and asking if you want Filet Mignon, or Brazilian sausage, or chicken, or whatever else they offered. They keep the meat on a vertical skewer and slice it fresh for you onto your plate. But I kept saying yes. Partly because I wanted to try everything, and partly because I knew if I passed on something, I wouldn't get another opportunity to try it. They didn't come back with that dish. I felt like I never really got to sit and enjoy or savor anything because the next option was standing there waiting for you to say yes or no.

Then they also advise you to go get a plate of what I would call ""sides."" This was also kind of  confusing for me. I filled up more than one plate on a bunch of side dishes, which was a mistake. But I felt that it wasn't explained well beforehand so I wasn't sure what to do. They have cheeses, sautéed onions, grilled vegetables, soups, etc. Lots of stuff to pile on your plate that you're never going to actually eat.

Don't get me wrong. The food was flavorful. It was mostly all good and I enjoyed it. The prices were high. Everything. But I suppose that's normal for Vegas. To me though, I'm not sure it warranted the expense. You basically pay an AYCE fee ($50 per adult, if I recall correctly), plus drinks. And that was with a 20% discount. They were extremely reasonable with the kids though. It was so little, I don't even recall the amount. But then again, how much is your 2 year old gonna eat? In the end, it was a cool experience but I don't think I'd rush to come back. If someone else picked it again, I wouldn't balk, but I'd probably rather eat at a regular steakhouse.",qZyyXZEMzm4pr7xMmVx7gA,1,1,3,fkFobkzZUsq-NNfGoeEn6Q

5878507,2016-02-21,0,h7s4MRVvB726jWHCHiQ9kw,"Located in town-square, this is a pretty easy restaurant to spot, as it faces the street.  We bought our gift cards from Costco, you save 20% or $20 off the bill.  

Regularly, $100 for 2 people to dine here.  If you're not familiar with churrascaria, the meats are either cooked over coals, barbecue, or could even be roasted.  

I found out that they're really into soy bean oil and that goes for both their salad bar and their meats.  If you're allergic to soy, they'll run through the selection for you, but I wish they had it on the menu or something.  

Based on your preference really, you can decide on which cuts of meat you think is the best of them all.  The all-you-can-eat meat comes to you, rather having to cook it yourself or plate it yourself.  The leg of lamb along with the lamb chops were great and the top choice was the Brazilian Picanha.  The braised beef ribs and pork ribs were way over seasoned with salt.  Aside from it all, nothing else worth mentioning in my book. 

As for the salad bar, the roasted beets, thin hearts of palms and tabbouleh were the ones I went back for seconds.  

Service was hit or miss.  We had to ask for lamb chops and the ribs 2-3 times before they decided to make one round in our area.  And when the ribs did come by, they keep passing us by and gesture they'll be back.  The server at the table is nice, cordial, but he can only do so much.  

The appetizer bananas was completely covered in sugar and baked, not torched to brown the sugar.  Already pre-made, I couldn't get one without the sugar.

I did expect a little more from my experience, which was not overly salted meat, but that's what we got.  

3 stars and I definitely did not stuff myself.  If you want the experience, try going for their cheaper lunch option and still get the same type of food.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,5,2,3,NSSpM9PR1a7bFhlwja92gA

It is very expensive but similar for higher end all you can eat buffet style restuarants in Vegas. I tend to enjoy other styles of all I can eat places like Korean but each have their own flavors so it is nice to go on occasion. I recommend going in small groups and not larger parties for the dining experience. All the meat that is brought tableside is cooked excellent and you are offered it cooked in the temperature that you want. Also, you can ask your waiter to have any meat brought over to you.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,4,bks3ltdQvIIKZ-vAa6Xy1g

Each visit has been excellent. We are always served by very courteous and friendly waiters. The meats are cooked to our liking and come around often. If there's a particular cut or meat we want, the server is quick to get the meat dude to us.

Salad bar area is fully stocked with delicious offerings. I have learned to not eat it all because you will NOT have room for the meats! The grape salad is so delicious. I always save room for that. Onion ceviche is a must when eating the rich meats.

Chimichurri is really good. I rarely eat the mashed potatoes, but when I do, man. Buttery fat inducing goodness. The lil cheese breads are as good as any other place I've been to. I wish I had more room in my stomach to hold them all.

I look forward to coming to the restaurant each time. I dare say I am a bit of an addict.

Highly recommended to my friends and definitely think you should check this place out if you're into churrascaria!",s_rK7Dda29Gy6clJ1TFNmQ,1,2,4,Q7LVALQtantzUgiZySKDLg

It's located in a quiet place near Flemings Steak House. My husband in fact said, "" Babe, are you sure you don't want to go to Flemings? "" I replied, ""No babe, I'd like to try something new"" and it was! My husband later said, "" I'm so glad you didn't cave in when I brought up Flemings! This place was AWESOME!

The staff are always so attentive and ready to order any specific types of meat you may desire. The variety of meat is really terrific, but I always have my favorites: the lamb chops and the beef ribs. The salad bar is also one of the best. I recently wrote a review on Open Table stating that most of the meat is always a little salty. My last visit, all of the meat was perfectly seasoned. Thanks for listening. Texas de Brazil is always a wonderful dining experience. Even if the meat is sometimes a little salty, the servers are always spot on.",ZBhlKw9Sjah1AchcL5RplQ,0,0,5,mEpxGQtzK7TDEX81-loNlg

What's the rush here guys? On top of all that, you wonderful salad bar is ruined by the poor complete embarrassing customer service this whole establishment had to offer. My server wasn't completely  busy enough to not fill my water as I seen her around the corner on her phone. Not one refill until asked for after the second person.

He always had a smile on his face, thank you Pedro. Pedro gets a $30 tip. Be like Pedro.

The salad bar is phenomenal. I especially loved their jasmine rice and sushi. Everything is fresh and delicious.

The meat were all very tasty. Tender, juicy and just so mouthwatering (orgasm in my mouth type of deal) I fasted all day just for this. The leg of lamb was a bit rare for me, but everything else was delectable and outstanding. 

We had a little room for desert, as for chocolate lovers we had the chocolate mouse, it was dark but not too dark it was perfect.

I have enjoyed every one of my visits here. Thank you for making my husbands first time here enjoyable and making our date night memorable. Spending the money in this was so worth it.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,3,3,5,U41fszWL5EPDBoAwOd52kg

If you've ever been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, then you know that they have a salad bar matched with people walking around with meat.  Be sure to ""flip over"" your table card from RED to GREEN so the meat can begin!  My favorite cuts were the flank steak and House Special Top Sirlion both rare to medium rare.  The top sirlion is the one that kind of looks like it's heart shaped once they cut through it. I can just taste the fat! You can't miss it.  The chicken cuts were okay. Some of the other cuts were too salty.  I do remember the sausage being a tasty as well.  

The salad bar did have cuts of cheese, some sushi, but I didn't spend too much time there. 

Thankfully we got some gift cards as gifts otherwise this place is really pricey.

You can reserve a table online!

NEGATIVES:  
- It was Saturday night dinner time when we were there.  The service, everytime they did come, they were great but with so many tables I felt like we barely saw our server.
- LOUD! It was difficult to hear our conversations across the table.  Maybe it was because it was full but be prepared.",wwnNyes9c0YwTUWjyirdmA,0,0,4,BJ7OnZpXxUiqX2ofPTMc7w

You can't beat the atmosphere and chimmichuri sauce. The other bartender was sweet as well. Didn't catch her name. Will be back. Thank you!,lxQpXbwYm7nok_dDlJd_Ug,0,0,5,yZH07wxp94ATsrAHdptPjw

We cut our meal short because it was so bad.  It says a lot when you leave an AYCE spot early with room in your stomach.
