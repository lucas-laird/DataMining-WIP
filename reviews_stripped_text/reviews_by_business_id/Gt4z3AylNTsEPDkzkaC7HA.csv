The young girl who claims to be the manager, wears booty shorts, because that's professional. Maybe if the turnover wasn't so crazy, you could actually have a consistent experience at this place. This last time will be the last. No coffee refills, no smiles, nobody every checked on us, had to ask for the bill, and the food presentation which has always been excellent, was seriously lacking.

All seems really good...but we wanted something quick and easy.  We always passed by The Griddle, but never got a chance to eat there till last week.  

They have a seating for outside and a decent size inside.  The two individuals that gave us drinks and refilled them were really nice.  I ordered the red velvet pancakes and my husband got the griddle platter.  He loved it; and mentioned it was not greasy at all.  I also loved my red velvet pancakes...they were really moist.  I liked how it had powered sugar and chocolate syrup.  I wished I was able to just used the chocolate syrup instead of the pancake syrup.

It took some time to get our bill.  I guess because there was only 1 server.  I believe he was the owner?  He took the orders, caculated the bill and took the payments.  He probably needed 2 servers to get that place to turnover people really quick.  There was a line at one point to get people seated and to pay for their checks.

Overall, it was a good place, and we will return.",4b4tZehvmY1rOfXYXxjNnw,1,0,4,m3k2weS43Mhy7bRH2auNdQ

The server was more interested in having a conversation with his friend at the table next to us. Wish the food tasted just as well as it smelled however my stomach requested that I stop eating and go chew on dirt to remove their taste from my mouth. Food is over priced. I also watched several servers load toast in the toaster and butter it w/o washing their hands first.,uqClOaTJDTlwrajeuZPMOA,1,0,2,QDkAqmqDJaxWPRLWa5JUsg

Walking in, the establishment is small, but clean. Sadly, the air is heavy with the smell of grease. I was there for only an hour and my hair and clothes stink like it now. There was a huge lip smudge on husband's glass. Looked like the cup had not been washed at all. 
We ordered french toast, biscuits and gravy, and some sort of chicken, mushroom, potato, and feta sauté that came with eggs and pita. The French toast was less than thrilling. Stereotypical Texas toast with hardly any egg even coating the outside of it, and was very dry. It came drowned in cinnamon and powdered sugar. I hate powdered sugar. There was so much I wondered what they had to hide under it. Also, the French toast had been carelessly cooked over what looked like drops of someone else's red velvet pancake batter. 
The biscuits were from a mix. Hard and dry like a desert.  The gravy was from a mix and hadn't even been made properly to hide the fact. It had no flavor beyond flour and msg.
The sautéed thing was burned in many places. Spinach over cooked, mushrooms rubbery, and the chicken pieces were smaller than a dime. The chicken tasted like it came preseasoned from a package  and didn't match the seasoning from the rest of the dish. Pita bread was over cooked on one side and doughy on the other. 
I love supporting small businesses, but this place was such a let down with the food and greasy smell that I honestly don't plan to even try it a second time. However, I wish the employees only good things because they were very good people.",BR2FZ8wDqJUuFHztVLUoUQ,0,0,2,PYwGdrvGYBvajnHd2maSQA

  The restaurant was extremely busy, so waiting was not a problem and expected since it was NOON on a Sunday.  It took 10  minutes for a table, the table was cleaned up quickly however not thoroughly (still sticky in area's and when you serve pancakes you must be more careful to wipe with a clean hot towel), when the table was wiped all the crumbs fell on the chairs which were left there for us to shake off.  It took 20 minutes to put in our order, the food took over 40 minutes to prepare (It may have taken longer had I not asked about it after 30 minutes of waiting).  The staff were kind & helpful after getting their attention, so I excused the slow service to the volume knowing how you can get a major rush from time to time since I use to be in the restraint business for 13 years.  However the servers lacked the skills of acknowledgement & communication to us ""their customers"" which is especially crucial when you are busy & people are waiting a long time.   Leaving people wondering & hanging is the worst thing you can do!!  
 After 1 hour + the food was delivered.  The pancakes the kids ordered all looked great, my mom's food looked comsi comsa.  I ordered the Chef's special Corned beef hash (which is my favorite & it's one of the most expensive things on the menu and the menu, the description made it sound sensational.  Presentation was 1 out of 5 and when I tried to cut into the golf ball sized corned beef chunks I realized it was all fatty & grisly (not little cube pieces as normal), so I got the attention of manager came over and offered to exchange it for something else and he did.  I went with the chorizo egg special which was very tasty (yet only had traces of chorizo...3 or 4 very small penny size pieces).  The only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 was that the 2nd order received literally was prepared in 2 minutes (all breakfast cafe's should be able to provide quick table turnover because volume is everything).  Unfortunately this was the 1st & last time I will dine here.  If I am ever in the southwest part of town again.........Egg Works will be my choice since they provides a consistent quality & great service every time I have gone.  I am taking the time to write this, not to bash them (in fact this is amongst one of my only negative reviews & experiences dining out in years).  Hopefully help Stacks & Yolks will take this feedback to improve their service & food quality for all their future clientele & to keep their existing customers happy.",LTcZTenm-5ODdPQ-T5S_DQ,1,0,2,Rs-kXIW2axejZKIk7Q17vw

It was the WORST red velvet pancake I ever had. It was big,hard, and touch to swallow. The environment had a weird vibe and The only thing that was quick was Sam picking up the her tip. The reason for the 1 Star is when we told the busboy about how Disappointed we were in the pancakes he laughed and said I know,  I heard they taste like rubber now. 

It was funny in the moment but then I started thinking about paying full price for something that they are very aware of that's not good. So I'm saying NO to the Stacks and YES to the Yolks",3lTlgrNb-BcjrQrzQv2sDw,2,2,1,xhD88aDQrxi7S7AfFZwLLg

I ordered a short stack (2 huge cakes) and made it a combo ( 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage) for $2.99 more.

It was packed but the service didn't reflect that - everyone was friendly and our coffee cups and water were refilled without having to ask.

Our pancakes came up about 15 minutes later.  They were huge and fluffy with the perfect amount of lemon and fresh blueberries.  They were so good they didn't even need syrup or butter.  Perfectly cooked eggs over easy and two strips of crisp bacon were served separately.  In hindsight I should have only ordered the pancakes.  I could only eat half of them.

The person who we assume was the manager on duty, was unapologetic and less than pleasant to his waitstaff. While we were seated quickly, we waited quite a while for our order to be taken. Once it was, it was around 45 more minutes whilst we waited for our food (we're talking pancakes here). In that time, we had five different servers, did not receive the water we requested until the third time, and were notified about 40 minutes in that what our daughter ordered was not available today (not that they just ran out, but our first server neglected to tell us). Finally, we were all served, and it was delicious. However, while we did not ask for a comp, some sort of gesture would have been nice. When we went to pay, we overheard our server approaching the person we assumed was the manager to ask to provide an orange juice to another family that had similar waiting issues. He indicated, ""No, we don't do comps...they have to pay if they want anything,"" then told her to go check on her tables in a dismissive way. I think we found the problem.

The waitress said the special of the day was loco moco and that it was very good, hamburger patty over white sticky rice and few eggs on top. Being a regular white sticky rice eater this sounded pretty good to me.

When the food runner brought my order it was a carne asada skillet and I said that wasn't what I ordered, he said ""YOU must have been confused because this is the special."" I explained to him that, no I wasn't confused and he needs to check with the one who took the order. They took it back and started on my order. By the time she brought my order, my family was finished  eating. 

Was pretty hungry at this point and just glad to get the food. That excitement quickly ended when I took my first bite. Scrambled egg on top was ok, it's hard to mess that up, hamburger patty was decent but gravy was bland. However the rice, which to me is the main part of this dish because everything is on top of it, was just bad. Sticky rice doesn't mean it should be like mash potatoes, too much water and no taste. My daily white rice eaters would agree. After a few bites I couldn't even eat it. Just wanted the check so we could get leave. 

When I got the check, I see that this hamburger patty/egg over white rice was more than anything on their menu, even more than the steak. How is that? And this is the special? Now I knew why the waitress was so eager to say it was so good. 

I would have gave it one star but my son liked his happy face pancake. 

I still tipped because I'm in the hospitality business but very disappointed in service and taste.  After all, you only get one chance to make a first impression. It's too bad because it's by the house and we really wanted to like it.",OKXBFnKS_qKaVG-xSWUyZQ,0,0,2,AA0ro75V9ZP2G4MP5troFw

I should say we have tried almost all within 3-4 mile range and Original HOP is still a champ with Mr. Mamas coming in second.

Stacks and Yolks... neither your Stacks nor Yolks were good enough to get a good rating. 

Yolks: ordered scrambled med/soft and sunny side up... both came out done wrong.
Scrambled was all browned up (which is immediate turn off) and sunny side was fried hard on a bottom. I understand that we all want our food fast but it still has to be cooked right and I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes for that

Stacks: ordered french toast which turned out to be rather dry and chewy - not good.
Pancakes were OK... but honestly they could make them smaller there is no need to waste so much food. 

Bacon... looked like a post-nuclear strike atrocity. 

Overall: not going back, unless they give food for free. Service was spotty, drinks were only refilled after waving and asking. Dining area is cramped and it is difficult to get in between tables.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,2,0,2,CMujKUT8xUkR9gowh8sPvg

I ordered the lemon blueberry pancake with scrambled eggs and bacon. My husband had an omelet with turkey sausage, tomato and cheese.
The pancake was fluffy with a good amount of blueberries and lemon flavor. Would get again. Eggs were well cooked, not over done. Bacon crispy. Hubby said the omelet was good. 
I would have given them 5 stars but the food was only a little warm. They seems to have plenty of servers so I don't understand how the food didn't get to us still hot.

After we flagged someone down to take our order it took about 45 mins to get our food, all I ordered was bacon and eggs and my partner ordered the chorizo scramble, we thought that they forgot to put our order in so we flagged another wait staff down and asked about it, they went back to check but never came back to update us, our food came out about 10 mins later and I asked for some Cholula hot sauce. I waited and waited for that wait staffer to bring it while my eggs got cold and finally had to flag down one of the 4 wait staffer standing in the aisle chatting with each other to ask for it again.

The hostess is outside and before seating us at the closest table, she went in to see if there was a table further in the back so we wouldn't have to be near the door getting cold every time it was opened. That was nice of her. Overall, it is fairly small inside; you have to wait for servers to grab food at the bar and take it to the table before you can walk past, and we were close enough to the table next to us that we could bump elbows with the other patrons. This is the reason for 4 stars. Our server was not as personable as another waitress, but that doesn't bother me. She was quick to take our orders. OJ is fresh squeezed and contains plenty of pulp.

485221,2016-08-21,0,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"So today we made our first visit to Stacks and Yolks.  A lot of action for a small space,  but it was Sunday and very busy. 

The food is good,  but the real asset to this place are its employees.  Awesome service with smiles and attentiveness.  

That being said... We ordered gluten free pancakes for an extra $2,  which we are used to.  The gluten issue is an allergy,  not a preference. The pancakes came out looking incredible.  Big,  fluffy and delicious.  

Here's the kicker... No gluten free options to put on the pancakes.  No syrup,  no butter,  no honey.  The regular syrup and honey has gluten in it.  So the pancakes had to be boxed and taken home. 

Initially I was going to give them a 3 star.  Who makes gluten free objects,  but fails to augment that dish with gluten free sides? 

Well,  the manager or owner rushed over to our table and tried every thing to find a gluten free option for the pancakes.  He listened attentively as we explained how the syrup he has in the restaurant has gluten in it.  He seemed very surprised and promised to get a gluten free syrup. He was very kind and apologetic. 

So all you prospective managers out there,  learn from this guy at Stacks and Yolks.  Simply because of good communication between him and a customer,  I bumped it up to a  4 star. 

We will return in a week or so to see if they added a gluten free syrup.",nlr38qPc8aeCMz4RdB1DPA,0,0,4,8nb-KHYXGkET5QxxoB_OLQ

It's a small, cute place to grab some good grub.  We arrived around 1130 am and the place was full but not packed.  We seated ourselves and were promptly waited on.

My husband got the fried chicken and vanilla waffle and thought it was MUCH better than Hash House.  He said the fried chicken was the best he'd had on the west coast (he's a southern gentleman).  He likes the chicken to shine through and not be overwhelmed by seasoning and he thought that The Griddle nailed their fried chicken.  I did take a bite of his waffle and it was literally the best waffle I've ever had.  Now, i'm not a waffle expert or anything...but it was light and deeeelish!

I ordered the french toast combo and again, I was super pleased with the taste.  The french toast was thick and had a hint of cinnamon.  I ordered my eggs over-medium and they were cooked to perfection!  The bacon was done nicely, crispy but not charred.

My daughter had the kids smiley face pancake and it was ENORMOUS.  We ended up taking 3/4 of it home. 

The orange juice was freshly squeezed and very tasty and the coffee was good for diner coffee.

He tells us about all the different pancakes that he's come up with....like cranberry orange, chocolate chip, red velvet....ect. There was also a marinated beef tip special that he had as well. He made everything sound SO delicious that we all closed our menus and decided to share. We ordered the red velvet pancakes, cran orange pancakes, side of bacon, sausage and the beef tips. 
Once we got our food we devoured everything! There wasn't one thing left! The pancakes were moist and full of flavor. The beef tips were perfectly marinated and juicy!

My boyfriends food was ok, my pancakes however were completely uncooked after cutting into them. They offered to remake them, fine. After watching multiple tables get served food and 30 more mins of waiting, still no pancakes. You would think they would have made my breakfast a priority considering we have been there for a long time already. The server even handed us the bill before the pancakes were even served. We ended up asking them to take it off the bill because my boyfriend was already done and I was already frustrated.

Especially since we called our order in and they forgot to put part of our orders in the bag. Drove home to our hungry out of town guests, but had to drive back to get the rest of our orders. 

Luckily for us, we had leftovers in the  fridge and the kids ate that, because they didn't enjoy their food. Honestly the things we ordered, we can whip up at home and I wish we did. Sad to say my pops left on his last day of vacay here in VEGAS having had this terrible breakfast. 

The red velvet pancake was far from yummy and we also had the philly skillet, which also wasn't great either and the great gobbler tasted like any meal you could throw together yourself at home. If we weren't pressed for time, we would have just made breakfast in our own. When your toddler doesn't even want to eat the meals, what does that say to you?

I know your in business to make a buck but do you have to up your profit margin so high that you cheat your customers of decent quality?  Service: UMM......who is my waiter?  Several people running around but I can't figure out who does what?!  I think the big guy was my waiter, but I'm not sure.  I saw him once when he took my order and then he never graced me with his presence again during my visit-oh wait, he did take my money but really didn't care that I seemed a little miffed at being ignored.

I usually stick to the basic egg, canadian bacon duo but I did a combo on my last visit due to a severe pancake craving. All good! The choices of pancake flavors are plentiful! The coffee is also pretty great quality for a place that churns it out nonstop, not watery or lukewarm. The people next to us got a skillet and MAN it smelled amazing. Lunch lovers they take care of you as well with assorted wraps and sandwiches.

First, they are way understaffed. The restaurant is always busy, but they don't have the staff to accomodate. The food is slow to come out, the waiters are running around telling guests that they are busy, and the check takes forever even if you go up to the registered.

Second, the quality of the food has gone down tremendously. Their recipe was perfection but the cooks have ruin them. My food was cold, my eggs were not cooked how I want them, and their food doesn't taste great anymore.

Third, this is more of a personal issue, but I found a large piece of glove.....in my food! IT WAS GROSS! When I brought it up to the staff, they were annoyed at me. I'M SORRY YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMER'S HEALTH. In addition, they charged me for the food and did not bring me a new plate of food. So I had to ask the waiter to take my meal off the bill.

The flavor was good but it was over cooked on one side and you couldn't cut through it with a fork alone. These pancakes require a fork and knife. I had a hankering for biscuits and gravy and they were extra disappointing. Neither were homemade. Rather than light flaky biscuits these are heavy and doughy.

- The floor looks like is hasn't been mopped in weeks!
- The encrusted, nasty ketchup bottles are a total health hazard.
- There NEVER seems to be sugar for your coffee.
- There's visible dust and dirt on the stainless counter under the kitchen window
- Kitchen storage looks unsanitary!

The food was lackluster. You're better off going to Denny's or an IHOP because its clearly a step up from this place. Service is extremely slow and they honestly don't seem to care.

I ordered the single stack meat lovers with only bacon with strawberries . But I make it a combo with eggs n sausage .So good keeps me coming back every time . They also make their own ok so good . They have a good variety of breakfast food from a big variety of pancakes with great toppings to skillets freshly made. I love it here n will be back,TWjMEPa_E5anUSMEnCP_fw,0,0,4,S72VVTjX-2bgwsZyHGd9FQ

We were seated right away and our drink order was taken.  When our server came over she said, ""you guys ready to order?""  No ""hi,"" ""how are you?"" or anything of the sort.  A little strange.

I ordered the french toast and added bacon, eggs, and toast.  Obviously I ate with my eyes.  It was okay.  There was way too much cinnamon on the french toast, even on the butter.  The eggs and bacon were just okay.  And my toast was forgotten about.  When our server brought over our food she said ""i'll be right back with your toast.""  After a couple minutes of waiting I started looking around and saw it just sitting in the toaster.  The manager came over and asked what I needed, I told him my toast was just sitting there.  Obviously it was cold and hard when I got it.  My boyfriend liked his chicken and waffles.  I had a bite of his waffle and wished I'd ordered that instead.

Our server didn't check up on us,  just started clearing our plates.  

I wanted to like this place.  It gave off a cute family-owned feel.  Not sure if it is family owned, but it was a bunch of very young girls working and ""family"" signs on the walls.  Their checks are old-school, they write it all out, which was pretty neat. 

The lack of greeting/communication, forgotten toast, no check-up, and mediocre food earns this place two stars.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  Not sure if I will return.",FWYjGKHmbjxrkXROctTGYA,3,0,2,mCYxGXXNvVOm-LBGz8nsug

1352503,2018-05-03,0,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"Came here for breakfast/brunch on Saturday after attending an Autism walk in Town Square. Located just south of 215/Durango, it is in the same plaza as Firehouse Subs, Volcano Grille, etc. Parking was a mild pain but we all got lucky and got enough spots for all our cars upon arrival. Lol 

Apparently, they are ""CASH ONLY"" According to my friends who's been here before, its been cash only for quite a while, and have yet to fix their system. My theory is, they trying to drag it as long as possible and take cash like some asian places LOL .... 

Also according to friends, the menu has been updated and changed a bit. Prices compared to menu's posted on yelp from late last year seemed to have up'ed a dollar, on average. 

To be honest, i'm not much of a breakfast person, but to have once in a while, im not against. And when there's a good one (like another place i had recently with a friend), i dont mind having again. mmm Lol unfortunately not this place Lol... 

After long consideration, decided to go for a simple breakfast. 

Corned Beef Hash w/ over easy eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit. Flat top grilled/cooked corned beef hash created a nice amount of crispy bits. Eggs were mildly under 'over easy' as some of the white hasn't set yet. Hash browns, were hash browns. XD Biscuit was good but quite small. Amount of food in my order seemed less than what you would get from a skillet, but then again, i may have been overly hungry. XD 

My friend had ordered canadian bacon, as she was craving it for some odd reason. It was quite thickly cut. Because it was so thick, it reminded us of ham. XD 

Two other friends had ordered philly skillet and carne asada skillet. Both piled quite high and looked pretty decent actually. Lol 

Luckily i didn't get the toast. It looked kind of sad and hard. awkwardly sized too. Didn't seem like a normal sized slice of bread 

I didn't see the mentioned poor service or dirtiness some other people have mentioned. We were served fairly well in a consistent fashion. Seated promptly. Yeah they didn't refill my water without asking but eh. We had a mess up with our ""bread"" orders and my friend had ate my biscuit thinking it was his english muffin. We recalled the waitress calling it an english biscuit when she brought the food. My mind/ears turned off when she said 'english' and i ignored it. Later realized it was my biscuit when his english muffin came later. She brought another biscuit, even after my friend said to put the new biscuit on his bill, but we weren't charged for it. When the waitress first brought our food, she asked us what hot sauce we wanted. I asked for Tobasco. Later my friend has for Cholula. Some how a 2nd bottle of Tobasco showed up too. Haha ! 

Maybe ordered the wrong things but this is like a normal breakfast place. Nothing that stands out, but nothing bad. A-ok XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,3,5sEUsTWq39h2bOx67iDVdQ

They actually bring the breakfast skillet to you the way it should be, still sizzling and popping on the actual skillet. We got a stack of buttermilk pancakes to share that were fluffy and delicious, oh and HUGE. FYI one pancake is the size of a large plate, so if you just want a few bites you can probably go with a single pancake. Service is also on point, really friendly and fast wait staff.

The red velvet stack (""the Lips"") was like eating a rubber disc. When I went to cut it it pulled back and was ""tough"" to eat, literally. The eggs and sausage were fine so maybe this place is better suited for its skillets and omelette's. Also, the bus boy came by and asked how the food was and I mentioned the pancakes weren't that good and he said, ""they're like rubber huh?"" WTF??

First she brought out my breakfast before my sister who was with me got her meal which was a soggy chicken melt that she didn't eat much of. Marisa apparently didn't hear me the three times I said extra crispy hash browns when I ordered and brought me home fries. About 30 minutes later she brought me back non crispy hash brown and what looked like dried out shrunken eggs. When she asked if that was ok I asked her for a percentage off the bill for such inconveniences because I wasn't going to wait again for her and the cook to get it right. She said she was alone so she didn't know what she could do. At that point I gave my plate back and told her to forget it. She took the plate with nothing else being said and walked away. When I asked her name she said ""they left me alone and I had to restock.""  I almost forgot to mention that she forgot to bring me my tea and I had to ask her again for it.

I met a friend here during the week hoping it wouldn't be too busy.  For a Wednesday brunch time, it was still pretty full and I was lucky to get a table.  Having a table near the open kitchen area, I was eyeing up all of the delicious food being prepared.  Our waitress was fairly attentive throughout our meal.  My coffee cup never went empty which is always a bonus in my book.

My friend and I decided to split the Crab Cake Benedict breakfast as well as the Always November Stack.  The crab cakes had a light breading topped with perfectly poached eggs.  The yolk just oozed onto the plate satisfying to the eyes.  The taste did not disappoint with a savory and fulfilling flavor. It wasn't overly sauced with hollandaise so you could enjoy the flavors that create this benedict.  

On to the sweet stuff: Ordering the 'Always November' stack will prepare you for fall with the pumpkin batter pancakes stopped with whip, cinnamon and drizzled with a cream cheese frosting.  The pancake size are a larger size which made me happy we only went with the short stack (2).  

Our breakfast was filling and delightful.  Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day you might as well stop into Stacks & Yolks for a happy morning!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,4,2,4,Ra2D6SzjLdZhM4q5BVN9Hg

Service was horrendous. I waited another 15 minutes to order, requested a coffee refill 3 times before someone brought coffee, and it took about 20 minutes to get my overcooked meal.

We arrived on a Sunday at 2pm and this place closes at 3pm so we were very surprised to see a line and we ended up waiting about 15 mins in the rain so I was really hoping the food would be outstanding. 

The small restaurant is very colorful and has a fun vibe so things started off well. We both ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and it was fantastic with the perfect amount of pulp. Next came our egg breakfasts, mine with bacon and his with ham. The portions are huge here and both plates were very delicious, no complaints and we would definitely order them again. 

Now to the disappointments. I ordered a single stack of the lemon & blueberry pancake and it was very dense, no fluffiness, no moisture and no lemon flavor. The portion was huge but I didn't want it :(
Next came the single portion of the French toast which again was dense and covered in cinnamon which wasn't pleasing. Both sweets left us regretting we ordered them. 

The service was fantastic and our waiter was a funny one which I always love.

I was excited to try it out especially since they have gluten free options but after today's visit, I think it's necessary. The whole experience was frustrating and I was disappointed that none of the staff seemed aware to how poorly they were doing. Here are my major complaints:

1) We stood ""in line"" to be seated at the makeshift hostess stand (out front)for about 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. At that time another 2 top had also walked up and was hovering a bit closer to the HS. She immediately greeted them and when my husband mentioned we had been waiting awhile before them she responded with an ""Oh"" and just took our name.  

2) We were told the wait was 15 minutes... We waited 45. This could have been somewhat avoided too. I noticed several un-bussed tables that sat unattended for a good 10-15 minutes.  

3) Once we were seated everything went relatively smoothly. Greeted quickly. Drinks came out in phases but relatively quick. Staff was a bit stand off-ish and obviously confused about quite a bit. I have dietary restrictions (allergies) so I feel like I'm playing Russian roulette when servers seem confused by my questions. 

4) This isn't really related to us but I find it disgusting... The table next to us sat dirty for nearly our entire meal and the ""hostess"" kept piling other dishes from different tables onto it. Both unprofessional and gross. 

Food was ok, not my favorite and was definitely not played to be appetizing to look at. The check was dropped off without a thank you or any real acknowledgement.

1988365,2015-05-12,1,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"At one point I heard several radio commercials saying how Stacks & Yolks was the go to spot for the best breakfast. I looked up their menu and saw they had a lemon blueberry pancake batter and I was sold from there.

I got to Stacks and Yolks at about 1pm on a Saturday. They have a random table placed outside and what looks like a hostess station. There was no one manning the hostess station and after an awkward 3 minutes of just standing in front of it I decided to go inside. I approached an employee at a cash register and told him no one was outside, the hostess comes up behind us and seats us right away. The table was very small for me and my friend, so small that I had to place my keys and wallet on the floor. 

The waitress comes over to take our order. I told her I would like the lemon......... And before I could finish saying blueberry she cuts me off and says WE'RE OUT....... No apology or even the common courtesy to let me finish my sentence. I end up deciding on a red velvet pancake and my friend orders an orange flavored pancake and we decide to share a chicken melt. 

The red velvet pancake looks great visually. It's drizzled with chocolate and strawberry syrup. The chocolate however was very bitter and the strawberry sauce was very tart so I ate my pancake the entire with a face like I just sucked on a lemon. The chicken melt comes and also looks very good. The chicken inside the bread had to be about 2 to 3 inches thick so taking a bite and having that much meat in my mouth was very unappetizing. The fries that came with the sandwich were very good and the pancakes
did have a yummy tangy whipped cream. Also it took a solid 45 minutes to receive any of this haphazard food. 

Overall was very disappointed after hearing all the hype. I recommend The Cracked Egg. If you're trying to make a better breakfast choice.",gnRJLFH4rmB1DTu985Thzg,0,0,2,k4ia6AJyeVw5vkDxn-BxHg

I ordered the chicken fried steak, and that was a mistake. Both the eggs & the steak were overcooked, rubbery, and absolutely had no taste. The tastiest thing on the plate was the gravy, and that was mediocre at best. The prices seem to be a bit steep for the amount of food they give you, as well as the quality of the food. 

The waitress seemed friendly enough at first. However, as the meal went out, the service went down horribly. My friend had to go get utensils for the table, because none were provided for us. Nor were they very good about giving us refills for our coffee. 

Overall, it was a bad experience. I wouldn't suggest going here. There are far better breakfast places to eat at in Las Vegas.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,4,1,2,4DVGOYqQObxvM7pB1ZaRlg

Well then coming from someone who knows F&B get your stuff together and communicate with your host staff who's seating so your service doesn't completely suck! He just had excuse after excuse and not one apology. FYI server guy dont be an absolute jerk when your PAYING, repeat patrons are upset that you basically just shafted them and just said you dont matter to their face!!

I had read reviews that the service has gone down a lot and the staff is rude but being a repeat customer for years I didnt really believe them.

Breakfast food makes some of the best recovery meals for triathlete or getting your sweat on. The interior decor got admit made great first impression really like the modern look with the oversize part menu on one side, and almost jenga building block different colors and sizes on another wall. The main logo has lot of personality and think its cool. I like the open kitchen look and no shortage of tables all bunched together that for sure...

On to the good stuff FOOD. I might have ordered the wrong stuff that not the rave. The pancakes had some buzz so had to get one of those. I love pancakes of any flavor for recovery meal. I settled on the Red Velvet Pancakes. In general love pancakes but if see Red Velvet am all over it. I only got single stack since wanted too try more of the menu. Thankfully ordered single stack. Talk about huge pancake. I would almost venture on size just as big as one had at The Griddle Cafe. But unlike not only The Griddle Cafe but Babystacks. The pancakes here was ok at best even then being nice. I felt like the pancake was too dense, no fluff in them, not nice moist full pancake filling with every bite, and the raspberry sauce they put on top OVERKILL for me. I think those two flavors don't mix. Lets be honest good pancake should stand out by itself! It never worked for me.

Turkey Melt was another nothing really stood out for me. All the components was blah. The turkey meat nothing special just ordinary deli slices, the cheese, and the chili. I did like the bread and the fact cooked it right. The sandwich had nice golden crust and the inside filling was hot with all cheese melted spilling out with every bite. The fries that came with it was another blah. The seasoning on them not figure out was not very good. 

The service was spot on five stars. It more like 3.5 star. The service needs shout out. They were friendly from time walked in, never had empty glass, and explained any questions had since first time perfect.

So I would have to say service was lacking. 
When the food came, it was alright - I ordered the minty pancakes and they were kind of dry. The scrambled eggs lacked any salt, but bacon was good ( who can mess up on bacon haha ).

I also heard him talking business strategies with the owner who has ties to UFC fighting. 
My brother went to school with this celebrity and I'm a big fan of the show he hosts so it's fun to talk with him when he recognizes me. Other members of the MTV show have worked at this location as servers off and on since it opened.

I love breakfast so this is a pretty big deal. When we moved to the southwest part of town, we took a shot on the place we had heard about a couple times. My fiancé and I were lucky enough to have the same days off at the time so it became a weekly tradition. While she has stuck to the pancakes for the most part, I have tried to work my way around the menu. I'm a sucker for their skillets though and can't seem to get past them. The hobo being my favorite, I haven't been disappointed with any of them. The steak tips marinated in unicorn tears is also a crowd pleaser.

They run some specials you can find on the whiteboard and I have never been disappointed with those either. The orange juice I believe is fresh pressed.

They ran a fundraiser not to long ago to support some fallen police  officers. The turn out was amazing and it was awesome to seem them do that.

While waiting, a woman said she was also told the exact same thing - that the wait time for a table would be 25 minutes. She was already waiting 45 minutes when we arrived. WHAT?! It's either the food is really good OR she had a lot of time to waste and wasn't really hungry. We had a group of seven hungry people, including 2 kids. 
What really pissed me off (and apparently 6 other people waiting longer than us) is when the manager decided it was ok to seat a group of 12 that just walked in AFTER my group. When I spoke to the hostess, she said that the manager said to seat the 12 top. She was just doing what she was told. WTF?! What about everyone else that was waiting?! 
That shows me that they don't give a rats ass about their customers. Note to the manager working the shift today - Yeah, the food may be good (I wouldn't know), but that won't keep your customers.

I had to try one of their skillets on this visit.  I was torn between the ""Great Gobbler"" and the ""Philly"".  Both ingredient combinations looked appetizing as did the others.  I decided on the ""Philly"" with thin steak grilled peppers and onions with provolone cheese melted over a king size bed of thick cut american fries and topped with 3 eggs over easy.  Wow! the portions are huge.  I couldn't believe they were topping these skillets with 3 eggs  while most places give 2. The iron skillet came out sizzling hot like the sound of fajitas at a Mexican joint.  Also the huge amount of potatoes underneath all the toppings will definitely be a challenge to finish.  I think they should cut the potatoes a little smaller to cook a little more evenly and crunchier but they were still awesome.  This was an excellent dish.  My friend chose the ""Gobbler and he said it was delicious and filling as well.  Another in the group had the traditional eggs benedict and that was also demolished.  

Overall visit was good, food was made with quality ingredients and the portions were very filling and prices reasonable.  I cannot wait to go back however this location is pretty far from my home and will have to be a destination location.  Stacks and Yolks does have a location closer to me in the north on Jones Blvd so I might have to do a comparison between the two.  This restaurants claim to fame is its pancakes claiming over 10 different batters.  So if you like to start your day with sweets you might fancy this concept.

Food is good but not worth the dead atmosphere. Few hardworking staff seems to carry the rest. Management/ Owners! Step in and change something, make it so your staff is happy to be there and you guests will be happy to be there .

It took me 10 years to find a breakfast spot with that home town feel, and food you can count on!! Now that I've found it, this is an every Monday AM spot with friends. The owner greets you with a smile, and that welcome  feeling you only get from a ""locals"" spot. He knows us when we walk in, as does the staff. Nothing beats that feeling of being comfortable and at home. 

The food and coffee are spot on, and the OJ is killer. The girl who put down the gluten free stuff, needs to check herself. They have two kinds, one of which is Paleo friendly, which a big deal to a Paleo girl like myself. The almond meal batter allows me to savor a pancake, without risking major back lash from my body for eating a rice flour version of GF. I look forward to my Paleo pancake every single week! My friends who is GF prefers the other type, which they happily make for her. The griddle platter or the Portuguese (linguisa) sausage and eggs are what I get on the regular with my epic pancake. The syrup is hot, the coffee is smooth, they actually have tapatio for my eggs, and the food is something we all crave in our group that show up every single Monday. The owners truly care about the place, and it is clean every time I've been there. I honestly have nothing bad to say about Stacks & Yolks.

They're busy to arrive early if you need them to set up if you are bringing friends, and don't always expect to be seated right away.  I've noticed that they tend to get busy on the hour every hour.  I might recommend that you get there at 9:45 am instead of at 10 am, if you want an easier time sitting.

The day we went, we have a party of ten, but came a few minutes before ten, and were promptly seated.  Seating itself is pretty tight.  My party are all fairly fit people, who were easy to squeeze into small places, but I would think a larger person might find this setting uncomfortable.  A lot of people apparently agree this place is amazing, so they are always trying to get in and eat.  The servers are prompt and attentive, and I always have a pleasant time without needing to wait to long to order anything.

So me and the best friend like to eat breakfast, I however do not wake up in time. We usually grab something from a place about to close but on this day I was up before noon. So we ventured to a new and exciting place down the street from my place. Stacks and Yolks is in the northeast corner of Warm Springs and Durango. They have a hostess stand outside and you have to wait to be seated and I understand why. It's so cramped inside. The table we sat at was right by the register so everyone was walking by and standing near us. They servers even had to sneak behind each other. We sat and looked through the menu and I was all about the pancakes. I order a single stack of red velvet and a single of lemon blueberry. I thought, ""Oh, a single stack is small."" Just kidding. They are the size of the plate. I only ate half of both. They were both delicious but i preferred the lemon blueberry. The red velvet has some sauces on it that weren't the bomb. Otherwise they come with a huge scoop of better and they didn't need much syrup. Overall a good first experience.

The menu seems roughly the same as before, with a bunch of customizable pancakes, waffles and egg scrambles available. I had the Chorizo scramble and the french waffles with buffalo wings. The interior is new and doesn't have that 'grandma' feel like in some breakfast restaurants.

It took a good 30 minutes for the food to come out but it was a full house. Fortunately the wait was well worth it. The portions are pretty big and we ordered just enough to feed two people. The price is more than fair at around $10 bucks a plate. Service is excellent and friendly.

I'm glad boyfriend and I decided to stop in and give it a try. When we went, it was closer to closing and there were not many people in there. The food arrived very quickly after we ordered and the staff was very attentive. 

Here's what we tried: 

Goblet skillet - Turkey Sausage, Spinach, Roasted Red Pepper over Home Fries with Cheese. Not the deep fried kind, but the delicious kind fried atop a commercial flat-top stove. The skillet came with a side of your choice of 1 biscuit and gravy or toast. Of course, I went with the biscuit and gravy. The skillet came in a hearty portion that I was unable to finish. 

Griddle platter - Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread. This was also a scrumptious meal served in a large portion. Just the right amount of feta cheese rounded out the flavors. I liked the goblet skillet way better. 

Now, it took me a long time to figure out what I wanted because everything on the menu looked so good. Next time, I'm going to try the marinated steak tips because, as the menu says, it is ""marinated 18 hrs in Unicorn tears, served with 3 Eggs, Home Fries, Biscuit & Gravy."" UNICORN TEARS.

I should've followed my cardinal rule that day, but decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  The floor had old coffee goo, shoe prints everywhere, and food stains.  I was concerned, but starving, so Darryl and I ordered food and waited.  

Grilled cheese: not only could I see the oil between the cheese, but it was dripping out.  I never experienced greasy grilled cheese before, but apparently it's possible.  Darryl had something that was terribly greasy as well, so we ate what we were going to pay for and prayed for no diarrhea in the end.

We also were able to enjoy a hot coffee when we were first seated AND a cold coffee after a few patrons arrived or departed. As other Yelpers have stated, service was a bit slow so refills to try to keep the coffee at least warm were almost non existent. Tip to the servers: Everyone should have a responsibility in keeping all customers happy. If you see a table that is not assigned to you with a near empty coffee cup and you are bringing coffee for your assigned table, why not just do a quick fill up as you pass by the table that is not yours? It is really a courtesy to the customer more that your coworker.

The pancake options are cool but if you don't have a good base, what you build on it seems to just try to disguise the fact that the base is lacking in flavor and texture.

It's okay if it's pricey & the food is top notch but that was unacceptable service. They shooed us out the door for their mix ups. I thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasn't busy. Very disappointed. At least if you're going to have LONG wait times,  give out public wifi.

 We're sitting down at The Cracked Egg on Sunset & Rainbow.  I waited 10 minutes & our food was up. They are reasonably priced for the huge portions. We've gotten coupons in the mail for our loyalty.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,10,0,1,cAMjF_ux_tHWM9R7rodJtQ

The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the coffee is a little darker tasting (bitter) than I prefer and they use breakfast potatoes instead of hash-browns. It is a personal thing but I think breakfast potatoes are lazy.

I didn't think I would find a breakfast place that I would enjoy as much as BabyStacks, but I enjoy Stacks and Yolks just as much. The menu has entrees that are more Americanized than that of BabyStacks, which is more along the lines of Hawaiian and Filipino, and you can see the difference in the demographic of those that eat at the two places just based on the menu. The entrees here give a good amount of good for the price that you pay, and everything that I have had were delicious. Their pancakes here compared to that of BabyStacks are bigger per pancake, but you're probably paying for the same amount of food for a full stack of each, with one Stacks and Yolks pancakes are about equal to two of that at BabyStacks. The pancakes here are really fluffy, which is a major bonus to me! I really love the food here and love coming here for it. 

The only downside to this place for me is the service. They have a lot of young kids working here, as food runners I believe, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but these kids need to learn about how to cater to customers. I didn't know they didn't carry Cholula, but I didn't know it when I asked. When I asked one of the kids if they had Cholula, all he told me was ""No."" He didn't give me any alternative options to me and there was an awkward silence until I looked over to see what they had and I just asked for the Tobasco. The waters of my party weren't adequately filled when we has empty cups, the kids just walked by without any regard to our cups. An attentive server was the one to fill our waters up for us minutes later, but it shouldn't have come down to waiter if there were plenty of others that could have done it a lot earlier.

I had the carne asada skillet (special that day) and a red velvet pancake and my sister had a coconut pancake....so big and so good (did I mention she hates pancakes and she loved this one). My husband had the corn beef hash....he said it was great but the portion could have been a little bigger (he is a big guy).
Only thing is they don't serve alcohol so have your mimosa or bloody mary before you get there.....

  I ordered the mint chocolate chip, paid extra for whip on top... so excited to try this out and well.... not amazing,  not great just ok. The pancakes are huge and two was way to much food.

Here's what I can't understand, sitting for 20 mins without having a single waiter come over for food orders or even drinks. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her if we had a waiter assigned. 5 tables that came in after us were served and got their food before us! I was told by the waitress that finally came over that our waiter got backed up and that's why he didn't come over so she was now helping us without any apologies.

They seem to be famous for pancakes and waffles...rightfully so, but I'm more of a skillet girl. Hubby and I tried Philly skillet which was great. Comes with a home made biscuit and gravy. Excellent, but I had to order more gravy. 

Mom had buckwheat short stack and said it reminded her of her childhood. Dad had hash and said it was great. Kiddo had red velvet pancakes with strawberries and blueberries (Micky mouse shape of course) which came with bacon.

All in all, the staff was friendly and the food was good. The home fries tasted like potatoes, and I mean that as in they need more salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter. 

So, why the 3 stars and not a hire rating? This place is good, not great. I love the mom and pop atmosphere, and like I said, the staff was friendly.

We got to the restaurant at about 1 pm so the Saturday brunch was busy. Those that chose to sit outside that came after us, didn't have their orders taken until after my husband and I were seated in the restaurant, which was a good 10-minute wait for them.  My husband and I waited just as long for our orders to be taken as well. 

My husband ordered the corn beef skillet special while I ordered the stack patty melt. Unfortunately, our main dishes came out but the sides that came with the orders, didn't come until another 10-minutes later. My stack patty melt was missing the eggs. So they gave me the eggs separately. I wasn't sure if the egg was supposed to go in the sandwich or on top, so I did one of each.  The hamburger had no taste.

Because of the wait time to put in our order, we rushed it and forgot to order a short stack. So we waited another couple of minutes because I needed my sweets. We ended up taking to go but my husband and I wanted a little taste. When we took it out of the bag, there was no syrup! UGH! The restaurant was starting to clear out by that time so the syrup was delivered rather quickly. Pancakes, fluffy good.

I had no expectations for The Griddle BUT figured it was probably alright since its been open for years (not many businesses can say that yeah?)

The daily special during my visit was the corn beef hash (made from REAL brisket) and was delicious! It was served with biscuits and gravy (meh), eggs, and maybe something else. HOWEVER it was $14, holysht, probably would not order again unless my wallet was overflowing with money. That is a lot of money for an off strip, eggs and hash brown joint. 

French Toast and the Red Velvet pancake was also ordered. The prices for each at $2.99 was a bit of a steal considering its large proportions, could easily get satisfied with one pancake. The Red Velvet pancake was sub par though, it felt more like a small cake rather than a huge pancake with chocolate syrup. 

Skip the coffee, unless you enjoy black water. 

Overall it cost $40 for 2 entrees, 1 pancake, 1 french toast, and a coffee. A bit steep, but mostly contributed from the corn beef hash. Service was friendly, the waiter was nice and communicated well.

I LOVE pancakes some would say obsessed with them and when I went hunting for a new place to feed my addiction I set my sights upon this magical place. Reading the reviews on yokes it gave off a meh appeal to anyone who hasn't been here but we went on a whim and went for it. We arrived around 1030 in the morning and the place had a medium level crowd and we were able to sit right away, from there our waitress took our drink orders and then dissappeared for the rest of the stay I think we were served by everyone on staff because at one point another server came by took our food orders and I believe the chef came by and dropped the food off as well as gave drink refills. 

Food wise the selection is exciting, you can make your own pancake with a choice of making it a combo (eggs and bacon)  for around 10 bucks. I ordered mint batter with nutella on top because why not and went ham on it. The wait was around 20 minutes which is not as bad as the other ratings were and the wait was worth it because ooo man were these things huge. You can pretty much just order the cakes on their own and they would feed you for at least the rest of the day. The  eggs were good but the bacon was actually legit thick bacon, I am not talking about the regular thin wimpy  bacon I'm talking wow this actually came from a pig bacon that was actually crispy and not limp.( that's what she said) The cakes  were great, not dry or lacking in flavour just awesomness all around. 

So, would I recommend? Yes I would, the food alone is great. The only thing that was annoying was the service as it took the owner actually coming over to deliver the food to get my coffe refilled. So if you want some monster cakes this is the place but if you want great food as well as better service maybe look elsewhere.",Di-G1U5EZPBvAMZYOXFk6w,0,0,4,v9ec6WGkdR6PTSMxwrjIHw

But it was the food that had me itching to come back. Then I did and my second visit was just disappointing. It was so bad I haven't gone back, though I think I might one day.

My first trip I got the philly cheese steak skillet and I subbed the mushrooms for fresh jalapeños. It was wonderful: perfectly cooked eggs, tender beef, fluffy potatoes, flavorful melted cheese, all kept screaming hot by the skillet throughout my meal.

It was one of the first meals I've had in awhile that compelled me to come back to the same restaurant in a week.  

The second time I came in nothing was the same. Our server wasn't as nice, the atmosphere was louder and uncomfortable. Worst of all, the food was awful. I ordered the same breakfast, cooked the same way and received something completely different. My eggs weren't cooked right, the jalapeños were barely cooked at all, and the there was considerably less beef on the plate.  Yes plate! They served my skillet breakfast on a regular plate this time, which killed the presentation, didn't keep the food warm (much less hot), and altogether defeated the purpose of ordering a skillet. Such a big let down.

Like I said, I'll probably go back one day since it's so close to my house, I'm just not ready to yet.  It's worth checking out if you're looking for a nearby breakfast place that's decent, just don't expect consistency.",zFvW-hvtKJ7AAj_kZNXsBw,1,0,3,cGyh2sEQU98cGEOEn3tMBA

Although there was many people waiting to be seated; our smiling hostess seated within 10 mins of arrival. This was probably the only positive. One employee took our drink order and almost immediately brought it. The utensils were dirty and thrown together on our table. Then, another employee, supposedly our waitress, took our order. I requested to have a high chair for my child and was never given it until I asked again. But that was when we finally received our food. Food presentation was unacceptable and the high chair was down right dirty. Throughout most of our meal we were never checked on. Also, I finished one cup of coffee and it was never filled again until I asked. The employee I asked looked at me and said she will get it in a few minutes. She then turned around and proceeded to set up silverware. It could've taken her 2 mins to turn around walk three steps to the coffee and fill but still she proceeded to set up her silverware. Another employee who was working another section is the only person who came over to ask if we needed anything. When I requested the coffee she immediately went to get it. But the other waitress came and filled my cup only half way. 
Now it normally takes a lot for me to write a review, but I hope that this establishment improves. I can guarantee that I'm not the only one who had an unfortunate experience on Mother's Day.

I had the Eggs Benedict Crab cake.  I took 1/2 of it home and it tasted just as good reheated.  Everyone loved their food.  The hot chocolate was to die for, came with a huge mound of whipped cream with chocolate sauce and sprinkled with cinnamon.

I got the orange cranberry pancakes with whipped cream cheese and whipped cream at the suggestion of Rudy. Boy, was he on the money.

My family of four visited Stacks and Yolks today. My husband ordered the lumberjack with banana pancakes. He liked his meal and they had Cholula :-) My oldest ordered blueberry and chocolate chip pancakes. She really liked the combination! She made it a combo with bacon and eggs. My youngest ordered the gluten free pancakes with chocolate chips. Now these pancakes are huge and she ate 1 2/3rds! Plus bacon and eggs as well. She really liked them.
Now, for me. I tried to order the clubhouse sandwich but they were out of turkey. Next I tried to order the Veggie Melt, but they were out of eggplant. So I settled on a BLT on wheat. The bread was over-toasted - almost black in some places. There wasnt much bacon but what there was had crispiness to it. I ordered a side salad instead of fries. The bleu cheese tasted like ranch :-( 
But the worst part of our meal was the flies and heat. The front door was WIDE open so two flies joined us and we left sweaty.

I loved the fact that they gave us lots of hollandaise sauce. One disappointment was the eggs were overpoached. Eggs benedict should be runny, but the yolk almost cooked all the way through.

There are hiccups in service & then there are flat out belches. We got a bit of both here. From getting a cute plate of sausage patties delivered instead of the patty melt I ordered, to my friend's waffle coming out 20 minutes after his eggs & potatoes did, this was becoming wayyy too much and too little in record time! I also got fries instead of the breakfast potatoes I ordered, which was also a fun bonus. 

While it did take forever for all of our correct food to appear, it was all actually very good (praise the Lordt).

The place has very cute decor. I love the way that they've set up the restaurant, the logo is clever and they even have well designed merch for purchase. I looked up at the wall in front of me and noticed a big advertisement to vote for them in Best of Las Vegas. They seemed to be doing everything right (which is why I gave them 3 instead of 2 stars). 

My brother and I both ordered a short stack of red velvet pancakes with whipped cream. They came out looking beautiful--great presentation. When I took a bite though I was very happy to be facing away from the man working there because I made an obvious face of disgust. The pancakes were downright gross. They were dense and gummy and the only thing that indicated that they were red velvet was the bright color. They were topped with raspberry (not the best choice) and chocolate drizzle over very cheap whipped cream (which I paid a dollar extra for). My brother couldn't even finish half of his.

Nearly one hour after being seated to get our food at a place like this? Yikes. Servers never proactively filled our drinks either - we had to ask every time.

The food was ok not sure why the wait or the people  who kept walking up talking about how amazing the place is. Considering there are 3 breakfast spots i am aware of in the area within a short drive i am not sure why people wait.

The breakfast was ready quickly and it was delivered hot.  The lemon flavor along with the blueberries in the batter made for a nice combination.  I did not make a combo of my breakfast.  For $2.99 more, you can get two eggs and bacon or sausage.  That would have been too much breakfast for me.

I read the reviews on Yelp before going here and a few mention cleanliness.  That's something that's apparently not a problem anymore.  The floor was spotless except for some foot prints at the door and the tables were clean.

3992316,2015-09-19,0,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"I've tried this place twice. And there will be no more attempts.  The first time the boyfriend and i came in around 9:00AM on a Tuesday. Wasn't  busy, and were sat right away. Waiter seemed pleasant, order was taken abruptly. We only had water to drink. He ordered a meat omelet,  and i (being vegetarian and not a huge fan of breakfast food) ordered a veggie burger. After waiting about 10 minutes, the waiter comes over to inform me that they were out of veggie burgers. However,  from where i was sitting i could see the cook, and because it was slow,  saw him physically leaning over the counter as if he were tired or just plain lazy; i had a sneaking suspicion that he just didn't want to go to the ""effort"" of preparing the veggie burger.  Ended up ordering a vegetable omelet. Food was decent,  nothing special,  but still edible. 

Second time: came by myself on a weekday (mainly because it's right across the street) waitress took about 10 minutes to come over.  Restaurant was full,  but not on a wait.  Waitress was very disinterested and cold. (However she seemed to really warm up when she was tending to her male tables) 

I ordered water and the veggie burger AGAIN. At least 15 minutes went by and she came by to inform me they are out of veggie burgers. AGAIN. She asks me if i want something else, but doesn't bring me a menu. I guess she assumes i know the ENTIRE menu by heart. I ask for a menu,  which she returns with 5 minutes later. They don't have a huge vegetarian selection,  so i was ready to order relatively quickly. I waited about 10 minutes for her to come back but she never did.  I finally asked  another server to get her for me. Another 5 or so minutes go by,  and she returns.  I order a veggie omelet,  adding feta cheese.  A good 20 minutes goes by.  No food.  Empty water glass. 15 more minutes go by.  No food. No water. Waitress comes over with the check and says flatly, ""I'll take it when you're ready"". She must have noticed my pissed off and confused look and asked if i needed something. I said ""yes. A refill and my food"". She looked confused; which i don't understand, seeing as how a perfectly clean, folded napkin and clean silverware were sitting on the table. She doesn't say a word,  just walks away. 10 more minutes go by,  and as I'm about to walk out,  the food comes. Without feta. I ask about the cheese,  and annoyed,  she leaves to bring me a very small side of cold,  feta cheese. Food was the same mediocre omelet i had the first time,  with less than an ounce of cheese. Fortunately, i had worked the night before so i had cash on me; I didn't want to wait another 15 minutes for her to run my debit card and scowl at me. NEVER.

They've updated the interior decor which is rustic and cool. There's MORE seating outside to accompany the long lines with a hostess stand. The hot chocolate was piled high with whipped cream, cinnamon and cho sauce and I regretted not ordering one. 

I did try the marinated beef tips which were marinated for 18hours in unicorn tears. LOL literally. The tips were too overdone for me but my husband loved the dish. It came with a biscuit and gravy which was FANTASTIC. I would add some sausage chunks to this though. We also got the chicken and waffles and that was tender and perfect. The orange juice has a lot of pulp, just the way I like it! 

I think we would become regulars again based on today's experience.",XdLQep9R3V7EHwW2fjgK-g,2,1,4,FZAKxTOksssx8jAzygtiew

It had mushrooms in it and I requested to have them taken out and add ham. Well they did at a high cost. $1.00 to remove the mushrooms and $4.00 to add ham (not very much either). While I understand charging to add things I don't understand charging to remove. Wouldn't have had a huge problem with it (maybe the $4 for ham) had they mentioned it prior to handing us the bill.

4200189,2015-05-05,0,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"I had all the hope in the world for this cute restaurant.

I originally came here for the first time with a friend about two months ago. The service was terrible (the way of being seated, our waitress, and not getting our bill and check back after we paid) but the food was stellar (french toast, sausage, and cheesy scrambled eggs). Since the food was stellar, I decided to give this cute breakfast place another chance. What a mistake. The way of being seated, which consists of waiting outside where there is no greeter, but instead a waiter or waitress who happens to be outside, makes no sense to me. Thank goodness a waiter happened to be outside or we would've been standing out on a humid day for awhile. The restaurant was practically empty. We chose one of the two booths in the back of the restaurant, which was freezing compared to the rest of the restaurant. I ordered a hot tea, and my cup still had a ring of coffee or tea from the last person who drank from the cup.. Absolutely repulsive. The waitress nonchalantly gave me another cup as if the fact the cup was dirty wasn't that big of a deal. I ordered the french toast again that I had last time, while my friend ordered chicken fingers. My friend said her chicken tenders tasted rubbery and she wasn't even sure if it was chicken. My french toast wasn't close to the quality it was the first time I visited this restaurant. 

I gave this restaurant that has rave reviews on Yelp two chances and was unsatisfied both times, I definitely won't be back for lucky number three. I'll go to SkinnyFats instead.",V5qFWVv9lC7HBwnqilmDtQ,0,0,1,ZE3gPvFcPIhq7cmMxYu4Qw

First I ordered their ""marinated in unicorn tears"" steak. Hmm... I didn't think unicorn tears tasted like pure garlic! WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC FOR BREAKFAST! It came with breakfast potatoes and A biscuit and gravy. Again the potatoes were horrible. They were burnt on one side and under cooked on the other and very greasy. Last was the biscuit and gravy. Again very bad. The biscuit tasted like it was stale and microwaved. The gravy taste kind of like soap. I did not want to send it back because I don't like doing that but the waitress was really friendly and she wanted to give the cook a second chance. 
So, I ordered the buttermilk pancakes. How bad could their pancakes be? Name of the place is stacks and yolks... It was very bad! I I could barely cut it with the knife they gave me. Is very tough and it didn't taste good. It was absolutely covered in powdered sugar so much that it poured off and got all over the table. I hope they weren't trying to hide something in the powdered sugar. That's why I hate sending things back.

You are not only won over by the taste and smell of the food but also by the exceptional customer service. Regardless of if its your waitress or not they are all attentive and take the time ask if you need anything.

I thought she was kidding as every table was taken including the ones outside and more people came in behind me but she said that there was always a constant line. In the 45 mins that I have been here I see what  she meant. I have seen kids, seniors, and young adults. Business people and people just enjoying the morning. The ambiance is very friendly and almost as if u were at a friends house dinner party. 

The fact that I asked Juanis to make me whatever she wanted, and without even blink asked how I liked my eggs and if I wanted pancakes, was pretty cool. She then proceeded to go consult with another waitress and came back to say "" okay it will be out shortly."" Next thing I knew I was brought three plates, one biscuit and gravy (that was amazingly and perfectly flavored) one philly steak skillet, and one side of a red velvet pancake with cream cheese and strawberries on top (not usually a fan of red velvet anything but after trying this pancakes I'm tempted to come here and just order this pancakes. They were moist, not very sweet, and the strawberries tasted fresh.) 
And the whole time my cup of coffee was kept full and fresh. Now being Colombian, its hard for me to find a coffee that I enjoy drinking black, this coffee is definitely the exception. I've had 3 cups and still continue to drink it black as its that good. 
 The philly was... Omg delicious. Seasoned to perfection, just the right amount of potatoes, steak, onion, and eggs.

But hey no biggie, perhaps there was a hostess inside that would come to our service. Wrong, it was more of like a hello please wait there.....kind of leaves no point of having a greeting table outside with no one there to greet you. Ok, on to the next issue. This place seemed a little crammed for seating. We literally sat right next to the cash register with a bit of traffic movement. You have waiters and people paying constantly, it's kind of hard to enjoy a meal if you're constantly being bothered by other guests. But hey, it's a family style breakfast joint so whatever. 

On to the menu, I already knew what to get at this point so I waited patiently for my server. After taking my order, 10 mins later I am notified that the crab egg benedict was out for the day. I kind of scratched my head in confusion since the store just opened literally an hour ago. Ok, no biggie I revised my order and get a regular eggs benedict with bacon as a side. My bf got the marinated steak tips, which was kind of pricy but hey we live a little and splurged. 

After ordering, our food was delivered in 15 mins which was quite fast. I was honestly disappointed in my food, the eggs Benedict was greasy and the bacon was burnt. My bf said his steak tasted like an underrated Filipino BBQ stick that you could get at seafood city lol. Yes, he can be brutal.

So we went to The Griddle down the street.

We were welcomed and seated right away and no 40 minute wait. 

I obviously ordered the Short Stack Red Velvet Pancakes with (2) over medium eggs and (2) patty sausages combo. I ended up getting 3 eggs and 1 patty sausage, but considering I didn't finish everything, it didn't bother me.  They offered me several different meat options (bacon, link sausage, patty sausage and Portuguese sausage)  and the menu only listed link sausage and bacon. I have never had Red Velvet pancakes, so I have nothing to compare them to, but I was a fan. But you can't go wrong with fresh strawberries, chocolate sauce and red velvet.
The boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers plate or something, it wasn't really a omelette or a skillet. He said it was really good, and it had his favorite biscuits and gravy. He made a blissed out face when I asked him if they were good or not, which I take as a yes. 

We had 3 different staff members help us, the hostess and drink taker seemed like the mother of the owner, a younger guy who was our waiter and another guy who joked around and brought us our food who I think was the owner. 'Mom' seemed sad that I ordered cranberry juice and not the fresh squeezed orange juice - I hope she hadn't been squeezing oranges all morning in the back! 

I saw some grimy kid fingers on the painting behind us, but other than that it was clean. I wasn't offended by anything, and nothing but the grimy hand prints (that only can be seen from certain angles) stuck out at me,",P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,1,0,4,UxecvAQU4Xz27DFkMtenbQ

I stopped in for a weekend breakfast while I was running errands.  The help was fine, but the place was filthy and I'm not a neat freak. There were enough crumbs on the seat of the booth to make a piece of toast.  We were wedged between the bathroom and a cart that was so overflowing with dirty dishes they were falling on the floor and it wasn't even busy.

 I ordered a waffle.  One would thing that's pretty basic.  It was so tough and rubbery it was  inedible.  It was topped with a handful of MARGARINE.  The Iced Tea tasted like it was instant..  I asked for the eggs soft and they were literally raw.  The sausage was thin, tough and almost burnt.  The person I was with got one of their ""specialties"".  It ended up being worse than a microwaved burrito from Rebel!

The entire restaurant was full of unhappy people and the manager/owner was walking around completely oblivious.  The table next to us hit the nail on the head.  ""They must of called this place The Griddle because  ""The Microwave"" was already taken.

There are so many great breakfast places in town (Sunrise Cafe and Cracked Egg to name 2) please don't ever patronize this dump.  Great restaurants are one's that take pride in what they do.

4 stars for service, prompt, attentive, and most of all friendly. From the host, servers and the busers.
Minus 1 star for seating arrangement. We were quite close to the ordering station where there was a lot of foot traffic, but that really didn't bother us, but it could for those who are ""claustrophobic"". Just saying. 
For my first time I wanted pancakes.
BTW... If you're a light eater 1 stack is seriously just enough just add ur eggs n bacon.
Build your own: 1 stack (3.99) ur choice of batter, I chose Buttermilk for simplicity. Added toppings ur choice, I chose Blueberries for antioxidants and anti aging ;) (1.00)
I upgraded my order with 2 eggs and 2 bacon (2.99) 
All worth it!

Always November had a delicious cream cheese whip on top but pancake itself was a little underdone and lacked the flavor punch I seek. My mother-in-law didn't care much for the gluten-free pancakes, she said they had an overwhelming almond flavor.

Inside, they have packed their sitting so it's so cramped. When it's crowded good luck trying to move around. You literally feel like you are sitting with strangers and having breakfast.

Service was horrible. Each person that came to our table said it was their first week so they apologized for their service not being up to par.

First we were quoted 20 mins and ended up waiting 25-30 mins, no big deal. 
Second we waited 10mins+ from the time we were sat till our initial greet from a very friendly man named AJ. He got our drinks (which came out at different times) and got us started and Also apologize for our wait, which was nice. 
Third our server who never introduced her self approached our table and said ""are yalls ready to order."" My friend asked her what her name was which it was JESSICA and also told her that it was our firsts time blasé blasé. Then we proceed to order. After we order we waited for our food which didn't take to long which was great. 
This is where all the real problems start.
Fourth my friends biscuit was dry and gross which they replaced with a fresh one. Our pancakes on the other hand were TERRIBLE. I had a party of 3 and all of our HATED it. We each barely took two bites each. (It was a double stack)
we would of or could of told our server but she never came by to Check on us until she dropped our check. Which she didn't even have the courtesy to ask us for boxes nor did she noticed our pancakes were barely UNTOUCHED. 
We asked this gentleman for a manager and waited five mins and asked another server for a Manager and she came back and said that she was taking a order and she be right over. 
That's when JESSICA came over asked us what was wrong we told her we already asked for a manager she proceed to ask is what's wrong we told her we didn't like the pancakes and she told us ""well they're cooked right so i don't know what to tell you"" that when I said this is exactly why we asked for a MANAGER. Then this lady named Mariah came over and introduce her self has Mariah and not the manager. We told her we didn't like the pancakes she apologized and said there was nothing she could do. I was shocked. I offered to pay for the partial pancake we did try but I was not going to pay for something I Believed to be wrong/gross. Mariah told me that she wasn't the manager and wasn't authorized to take anything off my bill and that there was no manager on site to help me and that if I came back she could give me some free pancakes next time. Excuse me if I didn't like the pancakes why the HELL would I come back for more pancake. So as I'm talking with Mariah ,JESSICA came to the table and said there's nothing wrong with the pancakes we've been serving them all day and that they were fine and no one has complained all day  then walked away. 

JESSICA was so rude and unprofessional that even Mariah noticed and after JESSICA Walked away Mariah apologize for JESSICA behavior and told us to hold on and she was gonna be right back. She came back with our bill and took the pancakes off and gave us some French toasts. At this point I was so fed up that o asked for the owners number which she gave me. She told me that he was just in the building but was to busy to talk with me and had to leave and that I should just call him. My bill was over 53 dollars after the pancakes where takin off so money was never an issue its the fucking service. They never even offer to remake them for us or get us something different instead the wanted to argue with me gang up on me at the table and proceed to tell me that they can not and will not help me.  I Called the owner twice the first time he said he'll call me back with the hour, two hours later nothing. I called again he said he'll call me back in 30 mins. Six hours went by NOTHING. At about 8:45 Bahador Emamzadeh the owner called me back. He was very upset I was calling his phone on his day off and that I had no right to call him so many time cause he was with his kids. I  informed him that maybe he should have a business card with his personal sale phone and title that says owner of he doesn't want to handle owner situations!!! And how am I supposed to know your busy you never TOLD me that. Any ways I told him how upset I was and my horrible experience and told him I didn't want free food or anything but I felt like he needs to know how his restaurant is ran when he's not there.

It's a cute little breakfast place, but the food was a bit overpriced. 


I came here because a couple girlfriends came here a few weeks ago on their Vegas vacation. Their schedule was booked so I met them at the griddle. (I already are breakfast but one girlfriend insisted I take her leftover for my daughter)
So I didn't get to try the food fresh when it was ordered, since I came at the end of their meal. 
It had apple slices and cinnamon which was amazing. The pancakes were so thick and it was as big as the plate! So it was hard fitting it in the to-go box. 

Weeks passed, I passed by it on my daily drive when it finally hit me...gotta eat here one day. 

I came for breakfast yesterday, it was good. 

Walking in was kinda weird. You're not sure if you seat yourself or get seated by the host. She was a quirky tall blonde chick who had the attention span of a squirrel. 
It was hard to get accommodated with our drinks and menus in a timely manner. And as we were reviewing the menu, she tells us there's an additional menu up at the front on the wall. 

My boyfriend mentioned it was our first time, then out of nowhere we had a server switch. The ""owners best friend"" as he told us, was friendly. 
He told us to not try the pancakes and explore the menu. He hooked it up with mini pancakes. 
We noticed the chicken and waffles and our server said they were better than roscoes. 
I asked if he's tried roscoes and he didnt which got me thinking ""how can you say these are better than roscoes if you haven't tried them either?!""
The waffle was very poorly made. It was flavorless and the corners were uncooked and soggy batter gushed out, which just means they were trying to rush my order.
My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict which was also 9.99 in my opinion a bit over priced.
he had the crab cake which had a corner of it still frozen. Just the fact of having frozen food served to you is a big turn-off.
My boyfriend ended up eating a piece and gave the rest to the dog. 


I shouldn't have listened to the server, but I guess we all were happy with the fact that he was  going to give us free pancakes.

I might go back if a group of friends wants to meet up, other than that I probably wont be back for awhile.

Getting served bad coffee in dirty coffee mugs and having to ask to be served coffee as opposed to being asked if i would like more coffee on a constant basis is not my idea of good service. Food presentation and taste was good aside from the large egg shell in my Californian Eggs Benedict. It did get it replaced along with a small apology and an unprofessional explanation of how the server reprimanded the cook, in my opinion not necessary to let me know.

I can always expect there to be a wait at Stacks & Yolks. During my recent visit, my boyfriend called to ask how long the wait was. It was 20 min. & they put our name down for a table so by the time we got there, we could get seated.

As usual, it was packed. The weather is nice so they had their outdoor seating, which doesn't look very organized as the set-up of the restaurant isn't meant for outdoor seating. That point was proven because a table managed to dine & dash. With tables hidden behind pillars & many people standing around waiting for a table, no one noticed a family with kids got up & left without paying. There was a waiter who was getting angry about it, blaming his other co-workers & cursing in front of everyone outside.

We got seated by the door inside. The waiter just cleaned it as they sat us down & left it very sticky. It's Spring now, but DO NOT sit by the door when it's Winter. The door opens & closes giving you a gush of cold air every time.

I dropped something on the ground & when I picked it up, I noticed how dirty everything was. My boyfriend went to the bathroom & said it was horrible.

I was not happy with my order of ""Crab Cake Benedict,"" but my boyfriend's ""Lemon Blueberry Pancakes with Whipped Cream Cheese"" were delicious. I never not order pancakes here so I know now to just stick with pancakes.

Call me crazy, but I always thought waffles were served in their solid state?

Try #2, eggs over medium.  They came to me not even over easy (still had all the clear goo all over them).  I ate them because I didn't want to get berated for not ordering correctly again.

Arrived at 7:30 this morning for try #3 (we've given them a year to figure things out since our last visit) and we had to wait for silverware because they were ""waiting for clean silverware to come out."" At 7:30am?? Maybe they only have 6 forks or something?

Once I got my order I headed home and to find my order of pancakes were completely wrong and to find my chicken fried steak was so small. I know it was bit my fault I didnt check the order before I left. I assumed that the order was simple enough. I did try to call them again to let them know in a chance they could start creating the correct set of pancakes for my daughter and have it ready when I arrived. Again no answer so I didn't attempt to even go back. I just wont be back. If you are looking for breakfast just drive down or order from IHOP.

I always get a skillet and a pancake when I come but over the years, I've come less and less and after today's visit... it's most definitely the last. The pancake batter had too much flour, which gave it a rubbery texture and only one side of the pancake was cooked while the other remained uncooked. I wanted to tell our server to replace it with a different batter but she was too busy ignoring us. My skillet consisted of maybe half a turkey sausage patty and they were stingy with the potatoes. The only reason I'm being harsh is because this place used to always deliver in quality AND quantity. It's just no good anymore unfortunately.

5016644,2015-02-20,5,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"Omg where do I start! This place is a hot mess! 

Joel and I were on this side of town for his job and we hadn't eaten breakfast. Since it was a Monday other places in the area were closed. So Stacks & Yolks it was. 

Right away when you walk in there is confusion. It's not a lack of staff either. There are plenty of people just total unorganization. When we were finally seated. (There was a hostess stand outside, but no hostess.) We weren't even given menus. We had to sit there for a while until we finally could flag someone down. They took our drink orders and came back to take our order. I had decided on the Crab Cake Benedict and Joel had the regular Corn Beef Hash with a side of sourdough toast. While waiting for our food I had to practically beg for a refill on my coffee and a water. Also, while we were waiting our waiter came over and asked if we had ordered something that we had not. Then he went around to all the other tables asking who's order it was. Wow. That was not a good sign.
Our food came out and I was ready to dig in. The waiter not the original waiter asked what kind of toast Joel had wanted and he repeated Sourdough. The waiter said it would be right out. My Crab Cake Benedict looked kinda sad. The Crab Cake itself was crisp and tasty, but the Hollandaise sauce was clearly old cause it wasn't runny, but congealed. The potatoes had no flavor and tasted like something they threw on the flat top for 1 minute and pulled off. Well, after 10 minutes Joel finally got his toast. It wasn't Sourdough however, but Wheat. It was so dry and cold that the fake butter wasn't even melting. It was some seriously sad toast. Talk about sad was Joel's Corn Beef Hash. We were both assuming it would be freshly made in house. We were very wrong. It came out of a can and was gross. I really felt we could have made it better at home. He asked for his eggs to be poached. Which they were, but  they were served in a little bowl that still had some water in it. Why not put them dried on the hash itself?  

So we are done with our meal and I ask for the check. The waiter said he'd bring it over. 15 more minutes roll by and no check. Meanwhile, people were standing outside glaring at us because they are waiting to sit down and eat! The waiter comes back and asks ""have we gotten our check?"" I respond with a ""no."" He walked away. I was hoping to get the check!! By this time my debit card is out and I'm annoyed. Finally, some other guy brings us our check. I didn't even look at it. I just handed him my card and the response I got was a fist bump. Normally I'm down for fist bumps, but a fist bump is not an acceptable form of apology for bad service and bad food. Just sayin! 

I will never again return here. It was a total waste of my money and my time. Believe me heed my warnings and steer clear!! Run, run now!!!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,8,3,1,r3V3RxiKzsmvWurkrTUj8w

I believe any item worthy of being put on a menu should be great no matter the feature. This cobb salad was not a cobb at all. I don't know what the heck this salad was but it didn't even come close. First of all, a cobb has iceberg lettuce, not arugula. Secondly, where were all the traditional toppings of the cobb? Some bacon bits, tomatoes, blue cheese, and packaged turkey meat just don't cut it. How in the heck can a restaurant be successful if you cannot even get the most popular salad in the world right?

Previously called Griddlecakes, a meal in April 2015 at the location on North Jones Boulevard so unmemorable that the connection did not become evident until viewing aged Social Media posts, it was as part of breakfast on Friday that a visit was made to Stacks & Yolks on South Durango Drive, a new name and updated menu from the same ownership seeing the place fare better despite a new set of faults.

Tucked away in a plaza also featuring fast food, foot spas and firearms suppliers, a fairly typical situation for many family-owned Restaurants spread across The Valley, those frequenting the area will likely know the space thanks to bold yellow signage visible from the street and with a large parking lot available those deciding to stop in will find the theme replicated many-fold on the inside where early morning remains fairly quiet save for weekends.

Once known for a fairly typical collection of Eggs, Hashes and Griddles but since going for gusto by way of oversized plates and Pancakes featuring a dozen different Batter flavors plus at least ten Toppings daily, it was immediately upon entry just prior to eight o'clock that guests were greeted and invited to ""sit anywhere you like"" by a lone young server prone to calling everyone ""boss"" or ""my man"" before knocking on tables as if by habit.

No doubt an all-ages environment, two men in suits discussing business at one table while two women, an infant and pre-school aged child occupied a four-top across the way, it was as current Pop staples played overhead that selections were made from a sizable collection, the ability to customize great for those who are picky or with allergies and the prices mostly on par with other independently owned Breakfast places.

Eventually settling on three individual plates priced $5.99 to $8.99, the ""10-Pancakes and 10-Eggs in under an hour"" challenge saved for another day, it was perhaps fifteen minutes before all three items were delivered in succession, the warm pseudo-Syrup quickly set aside in favor of the good stuff brought from home and first bites of the Churro-style 'Short Stack' immediately proving worthwhile as the fried Bread thickly coated in Cinnamon and Sugar offered a great crunch that quickly gave way to a soft custard-soaked center.

Moving next to the Pancakes, two $5.99 specialty singles requested and both barely visible beneath a mountain of toppings, it is surprisingly in their signature item that Stacks & Yolks comes up short as a result of flavors that simply taste 'off,' the use of syrups or concentrates likely at fault as the Peanut Butter's faint taste was almost imperceptible while the Chocolate tasted mostly like Hot Cocoa Mix, though in both cases the combination of Whipped Cream and all the rest were enough to make them mostly enjoyable.

***In a city with no lack of Breakfast joints, both chains and independently owned, Stacks & Yolks falls somewhere towards the middle of the pack in terms of everything from price to service to the food itself.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,5,3,PiovURUQmnhY8rEg2P6pfg

Came on a Sunday afternoon, dined al fresco because the weather was beautiful and my party was starving and it meant we would be sat right away. Server came over quickly, teas and coffees arrived, menus were perused, then orders placed...ENTER THE VOID!

Servers disappeared, bussers kept glasses full, but nothing... Our server was MIA and 20 minutes later a table that sat way before we did got food. Ours arrived about 20 minutes after that. I am all fine and dandy waiting for something to be cooked fresh (45 minute waits for Chicago pies is half the adventure), but what arrived came out lackluster, underwhelming, and just gross. 

I got my eggs poached. They were served to me in a bowl and hadn't been drained. One of the eggs was cracked and it was like poached egg soup. What the gross! My friend stated that her meat had no seasonings. The biscuits and gravy were meh (how is there no sausage in the gravy?!). If you order something called huevos Mexicanos, you'd expect it to pack some heat! Not at Sucks and Yucks. Bland and subpar are it's speciality. Home fries which had nothing home-y about them. Not even a sprinkle of salt. Are y'all afraid of the spice rack or some shit? It was just bad, bad, bad. The ONLY redeeming thing about this visit was the pumpkin pancake I ordered. That ish was the bizzzz-ness!

WORST. BREAKFAST. EXPERIENCE. IN. LAS. VEGAS. I could have had 2x the food and it been more palatable at Denny's or IHOP! This is a mom & pop that makes you remember why you HATE going home for the holidays. So much potential down the drain.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,9,2,2,pT2qNyQkKbAbfIUyna_z5Q

Then I waited around for someone to take my food order for maybe 10 mins? I wanted to try the pumpkin pancakes on the specials board, it noted what it came with whipped cream cheese, whipped cream, and cinnamon. Only I didn't want all that whipped nastiness on my pancakes so I asked for it on the side just so I can try A LITTLE bit, I know most places pack that shit on pancakes like crazy haha. I also ordered a side of eggs over easy and some breakfast potatoes, hoping they'd be seasoned. Food came out maybe 20 mins after that.... Whatever, it's a busy, mom + pops breakfast kind of place, don't really expect muuuuch organization haha. My potatoes were bland and I felt dumb for even ordering them haha. Pancakes were good, but no cinnamon.... Not even on the side! I just said whipped cream + cheese on side, I was hoping they'd sprinkle the cinnamon! So I asked my server for it and he brought it out as I'm finishing up my meal haha. Thanks dude. He was pretty slooooow! And the side whipped stuff was waaaay too much, I shouldn't have even wasted it because apparently it's a $1/ea. I was surprised that was on my bill, I thought it came WITH the pancakes that's why I asked for it on the side. That's kind of dumb that they jack you like that, making it seem like it comes with your pancakes. I didn't even finish them, I ordered two and only had half. Should've only ordered one!!! I was happy the manager or owner or whoever the cashier was at least took off the $2 of the whipped toppings because had I known, I obv wouldn't have wasted them. Servers should advise guests when they order those upsells, especially on the side because they're prob doing it to be a liiiittle health conscious haha.

I felt like I saw quite a lot smaller tables fill up that came after us-that had she figured it out, could've sat our party a little sooner. It wasn't that big of a deal, just something I noticed. 

On to the service and food. The OJ was fresh, which was nice. I hate bottled fake OJ. I definitely recommend trying at least one of their delicious & different pancake batters. I tried the peanut butter pancake and added chocolate chips to it...SO GOOD. I made it a combo, because I usually just eat eggs. The single stack is HUGE, and great to try with others. My husband had the corned beef skillet-one is fresh, and one is canned. He chose the fresh one. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food. We had 4 children, and they all enjoyed their food. The waiter was very good, and very nice. It was a bit warm in the rest, but it was super cold out today, so it was actually kind of nice to take sweaters off.

We have come here many times, and everything was always perfect. Today we came and we noticed right off the bat the place was half empty, and there was still a 10 minute wait. People were visibly upset outside, having waited forever for their bills. But we still sat. Bad idea. 

Firstly there were three tables that were seated after we ordered that received their food before we did. Then half of my husbands order didn't show. Or so we thought. Turns out I had my husbands food, and when I took a bite I nearly died because jalapeño and I don't mix and it was not regular bacon like I had ordered. 

Finally the waitress came by and when I said I didn't have my food, and there was a mix up, she didn't know what to do. She immediately put the blame on the kitchen, which ok. But then she made no effort to even get my food. 

Then my husbands pancake, and my daughters were mixed up. Like, this isn't hard. One has sprinkles baked into it and the other doesn't. 

So now we finally ask for the manager because honestly, this is unacceptable. There isn't even a manager, but the owner happened to be there. The man had the nerve to walk out of his own restaurant with a kid and a bunch of to go bags. Couldn't be bothered to even apologize for the mix up or anything. 

And the topping is he told the waitress to give us 20% off MY FOOD THAT I DIDNT EVEN HAVE. Not the bill, my non existent food. 

So yeah. Fuck this guy and fuck this place. Never getting my business again since he fired his whole staff that knew what they were doing to probably save his cheap ass a couple of bucks.",1JYMsM3kFNCFqI10JXATcQ,3,0,1,RMX1SYL-fzkGV7maHKGHkQ

Unfortunately, it's not the yolks. I ordered a skillet breakfast with over easy eggs. Three eggs come with the skillet, and one was over easy, the second over medium, and the third over hard. :/  I really expect more from a breakfast joint; even Denny's gets my eggs right.
Hubs ordered the Alabama Slamma pancakes, and those were tasty. The biscuits and gravy side was meh, too. The gravy has very little sausage flavor. Stick to their stacks and skip the yolks.
All in all, we are unlikely to return. There are just to many better options in this area.
Pros: wide menu selection, good service for coffee refills (our mugs were never empty), cute decor
Cons: Eggs not prepared as ordered, our server never returned to check on us (so I couldn't even say anything to her), half the restaurant gets blasted with outside air every time door opens.

We dined on Christmas Day and was pleasantly happy to know this restaurant was open. The decor was great and the staff was super friendly. We were offered the booth in the back and happily followed the server to our dining spot. 

Things started out terrific, ordered a cup of coffee  and tried to figure out what yumminess I will partake as my entree this morning. Well, it was early and I need as much coffee as I can physically engulf in one sitting... I finished my first cup and it took forever to get a refill (and equally a while for someone to take our order.) I had to ask someone for a refill but it still took a while for them to fill my cup, I ask my brother if he would be mad if I just got up and filled up myself, I mean the coffee pot was only a few steps away, but finally someone came by and filled my cup... (They may of heard me talking about really needing a refill... don't mess with someone who needs coffee to function early in the morning) It's a simple request and don't know why it took so long? I may of been more annoyed seeing everyone else get a refill or getting beverage while I waited for a while? Or maybe the restaurant started filling up? Or maybe the orders for food all started to pile up... It's dumb I know, but it was kinda annoying... Either have bigger cups or keep the caffeine flowing when you obviously see an empty cup at the end of a table. Just sayin'

Anyways, moving on the the important stuff, THE FOOD! I ordered the cranberry orange pancakes and a single order of French toast... My bro got the steak and eggs and my niece got a single blueberry lemon pancake... Well here's the deal. I pretty much hate pancakes (with a small exception, ahem - mister mcalpine)  many pancakes I taste have a weird starchy taste to them that is unappealing to me... Since this place has such a plethora of options of flavored, I thought why not... Well I had a small portion of nieces lemon blueberry pancake (she's 3 and since the lotions were bigger than MY head I felt obliged to help her out) well, HOLY SMOKES!!! YUM! Very flavorful, fresh and yummy!!! No weird starchy taste!! By far my most fave pancake today... My orange cranberry was good, the orange flavor was subtle but equally d'lish... It was filled with cranberries and a glaze that was simply fantastic! 

I think once the staff got things back in order everything went back to normal and they were attentive and helpful....

I am pretty sure churro styled french toast, along with the 1/2 lb of butter AND the maple syrup and the egg whites (gotta watch the cholesterol) with bacon, that meal was easily 3000 calories of goodness.

After three bites I felt like my mouth had been transported to a place that had unicorns making love to dolphins surfing a rainbow to the leprechauns gold. After a few hours though, I did notice a rather strong reaction starting to rise in my body. No matter what pain I suffered afterwards... just those moments where my tastebuds were transported to the land of make believe, it was worth it.

I love the hearty breakfast they serve along with the good service they provide. The environment is like an old friends house and you can sit for hours talking and laughing with your friends. Their menu is big and offers a pretty wide variety on what you can order and they specialize in unique pancakes and skillets. I don't think you can go wrong on anything you order as I only see smiling faces chowing down at this restaurant. The portions are also pretty big so you leave feeling fat and happy! You need to get here at an early hour though as this place does fill up fast on the weekends. They also have two locations. I prefer the one on Durango as closer to where I live but there is another one in the northwest part of town.

I am pretty standard on what I order which is usually bacon, eggs, sourdough toast and an OJ or hot chocolate depending on what time of year it is. On this occasion I was doing with one of my besties. She ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and we shared a delicious pancake. The pancake was fluffy and not heavy like pancakes can be at times.

Hopes were high even though yelp showed up with 3.5 stars (ehhh. Whatcha gonna do?). We showed up and were greeted and sat immediately (early morning before the rush) and given drinks. Once we ordered though, it was all downhill from there. The service went from friendly to nonexistent, the food took a considerably long time to come out and drinks often times ended up drier than the desert dunes across the road before a refill was even conceived. My order came out incorrect but there wasn't anyone to let know about this (as they were off doing their own thing without concern) and frankly it would have taken twice as long to get it corrected - not worth it. The waitress eventually came by and asked if we wanted the check, which we gratefully requested so we could get out of there, though we asked for more water - you'd have thought I sold her firstborn to the gypsies. She took our card, I asked again about water and she decided not to acknowledge or respond. I was happy to eventually get my card back after 5-7 minutes (I don't care to have someone else keep my card laying around on the counter for that long) and then leave.

I knew when I saw how busy it was we should've left. We were sitting at our table, when we were asked to get up because the table had been cleared by mistake. There's no waiting room inside, so we had to then wait outside for something to open up. I'm pretty easy going so no problem. 
We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant, where it seemed we were forgotten. We got water after 10min or so. Then another 10min later we got some of the worst coffee ever. Eventually we saw out actual server who took our order and apologized for the wait. 
So then we waited and waited for food and new coffee. The server brought food to the table....but it wasn't anything that we ordered. So it went back and we waited again. 
We got our food. My son was happy with his smiley face pancake. Hubby said the formerly awesome breakfast burrito was just ok and had to be drowned in cholula for flavor. I got the Country Combo. Scrambled eggs, bland potatoes, and a biscuit with a single sausage patty laying on top with some packet style ""country "" gravy. It was so sad. All that trouble for a less than mediocre breakfast. I had the Country Combo before and it was amazing. Sorry Stacks. I like to support local business, but you have lots of competition out there that blows you away. If I get a hankering for a specialty pancake, I might be back.

The restaurant is a little small and its also fairly popular so be prepared to wait if you hit it during peak hours but that's okay because the food is great and worth it.

The Red Velvet Pancakes are awesome! of course the Yolks are made basically anyway you can think of with options of getting Egg Whites only. They do serve lunch items, salads, burgers, fries, wraps, and sandwich's but I have only eaten breakfast here.

This day I had the red velvet pancakes and the Griddle Platter and it was super great, how can you go wrong with Chicken, Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Cheese over Home Fries with 3 Eggs any style. Served with Pita Bread! 

Coffee is pretty standard with no fancy selections here. They do offer a Gluten Free Menu for those that need no gluten although there is only about 6 items on it but certainly enough to satisfy. 

Parking is in a shared lot with other business so that could be a challenge depending on the time of day you go.

I'm always on a hunt for red velvet pancakes!

Came here the other day with my boys Supercr3w/Jabbawockeez for Rainen's birthday breakfast. They are good friends with the owner Baja. Baja is super friendly and took really good care of us.

This is a hard review because the owner was amazing nice... but the red velvet pancakes... didn't pass my approval!

I ordered the red velvet pancakes... with egg whites, chicken sausage and potatoes. I didn't care for their version of red velvet pancakes! I was bummed out and only ate a quarter of it. Something was missing in their recipe... I had better. My friends cousin also didn't like her order of red velvet pancakes... and only took a bite of it. The rest of my breakfast was doable... hard to mess up right?!

I won't be back unless it's with the boys... if so I'll have to try the chocolate pancakes and update my review.

Can't complain... I only paid... tip... Baja took care of us.

The omelette was made of egg whites and we pretty much topped it with everything...onions, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, sausage, ham, and bacon. It was huuuuge and really yummy! Hot and fresh.

5928815,2016-11-22,3,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"I have been to Stacks & Yolks several times now, but am not in love with the food or service. We started eating here because my husband is a fan of their Bacon from Heaven. Unfortunately, the last 4 times we have been here, it wasn't available and they did not even bother to tell us until 10 minutes after we placed our order. I mean seriously, if you are not going to serve it, take it off the menu or at least let the employees know so that they can tell customers right away!

The best dish I had from here was the Chicken Breast and Waffle. Unlike other breakfast restaurants, the waffle here is pretty thick, and the chicken was juicy and tasty. Here are the others that I have tried:

-Always November (single stack): This pancake had a good pumpkin flavor, but the cream cheese was too thick for my liking. The single stack was huge - I was only able to eat half of it.
-Smitty (single stack): This pancake was just way too dry, but the mint flavor was not overwhelming. 
-Biscuit and Gravy: The biscuits were not warm and the gravy was tasteless and horrible!

Service is a hit or miss. Usually, its not good at all - most of the servers do not care to check up on you or refill drinks. However, there are 2 servers that I remember who was very friendly and attentive. This restaurant is also very small and crowded. The tables by the kitchen counter are the worst because of the traffic and you feel uncomfortable eating when so many people are walking by and bumping into you. 

Not recommended. There are other breakfast restaurants that are so much better in this city, so do not waste your time!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,4,2,ER-eVaBwKLw_sC7ySH2kfw

This is perfect though if you have kids and also if you are on an ""Atkins"" or other low-carb diet plan. It is cheap, it is quick, the service is good, it is more like a ""diner"" and it really has great food for the money.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,5,_mRon6vDWvLH75P5_V-eqQ

I decided to try this place again was because they had an ""A"" Grade now.

My remarks:
Walked in and was greeted by owner, we chose a table and the place was not busy a total of 5 people. 

Owner came over after waiting several minutes and we placed our order, the order felt rushed as he was looking around constantly.

Order arrived fairly quick but it was cold and not as ordered. Fast does not mean good! The waiter (owner) did not check back to see if we needed anything. The guy who got us the drinks came back and I told him my eggs were undercooked, not as ordered. He took them right away and said o.k. I waited for 15 minutes no eggs returned. The guy then returned after 20 minutes and I said did you forget about the eggs and he said no and by then my boyfriend was almost completely done with his plate of food. He runs back gets the eggs and they arrive less cooked than last time, eggs were running all over the plate. I took the plate up to the owner who happens to be our waiter and told him to take them off the check. 

He apologized when we were leaving, but the food was not worth the price!",kOqcNFcpDl3h8vFNJ7FwWA,1,0,1,JJ_CemZhsgRvL7Hyrxd-dA
5954442,2016-05-30,7,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"I had very high hopes for this place, but it was okay at most. I ordered the marinated steak tips and it was okay. It was cooked well done so it was difficult to chew on. For something that is supposed to be marinated, it lacked flavor. The A1 sauce saved it. The potatoes were tasty, not the best texture because they were not crisp on the outside, plus they are much larger cuts of potatoes. The service was kind of odd. I did not have one server but maybe 6? One took our order. Someone else brought our food. Someone asked us if everything is okay. Three others came by too. I felt rushed the whole time. The check was dropped off a couple minutes after the food. Plus the servers kept asking if we were done with our plate, mid-bite! O.O Can't you tell that I am still eating? I would definitely come back to maybe try some stacks or yolks, cause that is what it should be famous for right?",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,9,5,2,NngMegwQaBPAU93EzyZmKQ
5959342,2014-11-29,2,Gt4z3AylNTsEPDkzkaC7HA,"My fella was craving eggs benedict and I'm always up for trying a new place. 

We arrived around 11 and the place was pretty crowded, but we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The table was cramped but we made do. 

I ordered the lumber jack with scrambled eggs, sausage links, home fries and upgraded my pancakes to the lemon blueberry so I could share them with the table. My fella ordered the eggs benedict.

Service was friendly and attentive. They were on the slower side because they were so busy, but when our food did eventually come out it was delicious. The home fries and the lemon blueberry pancakes were my favorites. The pancakes are probably some of my favorite that I've tried in vegas, perfectly cooked, the blueberries were flavorful and ripe and the hint of lemon complemented the flavors perfectly.

I am definitely a fan of Stacks & Yolks and look forward to coming back again soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,2,4,FVfGtZLr-cYaFWdAERvi7A

They also kept moving us for a ""big party"" that was coming in. Despite that, the food is always great. I always get the birthday cake pancakes with extra whipped cream and a side of Nutella. So delicious and of course I can only eat about one pancake but who cares! They also have freshly squeezed oj that is yummy!",RXSFT4K09Ta6oTdrvFGmCA,1,0,3,G_IwpoJOJQy3T6bys86uXA
