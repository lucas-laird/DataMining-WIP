OK, so since my family is all about take-out lately, I can't review the restaurant's atmosphere, or wait service, but strictly reviewing the food it was a little plate of heaven. Well, make that a big plate.

I ordered the Chicken Sag and Spinach Nan (Yeah, I'm a big spinach fan). The Sag had the wonderfully creamy, soothing taste I was hoping for. That dish is my comfort food. The Nan was freshly baked and piping hot. My husband had the Lamb Vindaloo and Aloo Paratha. The Aloo was slightly underseasoned for me, and my husband always orders things ""hot,"" so the Vindaloo was good, but too pungent for my taste. Not for the faint of heart. The flavor was right on, though.

All the food had the complex and earthy Indian spice combination that I've never been able to recreate at home, but love so much. I'm so jazzed about this place. They're a little out of the way. I would have driven right by them if I hadn't known that they're set back off of the road behind another business (sorry can't recall which one). If you like Indian cuisine definitely go give Mantra Masala a try. Let's keep these guys in business!",PkZcF10Nqrqo74w9NWQFEg,0,0,5,FZrp7Cmi_HFc8ZdDvy6cXg

I  really like the chicken tika masala and the malai kofta ; I had some of the appetizers as well and they are all fried and doesn't go very well with my healthy diet.  

I would recommend  Mantra Masla if you are in the area and craving some Indian food but I think there are much better restaurants in town such as Mount. Everest.  Hope this review helps.",Ns138gV1CUF8ZF01hiJu_A,1,0,3,hVDfNs9Vmbro_XA8AD4Rlw

We had ordered kulfi and kheer. What was served was vanilla ice cream and  something which resembled and tasted like reheated porridge.
When we spoke to server he insisted that what he had served was kulfi. When I told him that I had taken kulfi dessert throughout my life and that I would recognize kulfi when presented to me he backed down and accepted that what he served was not kulfi but vanilla ice cream and that he was not being truthful.
 After this lie, I did not want to speak with him about reheated porridge like item served as kheer.
Not only did he not apologize but also billed both deserts.
The lie was conduct unbecoming.  If we were naive, unsuspecting clients, he would have taken us for a ride.

1. Gorgeous decorum- nothing kitch or subpar here; private dining booths are the most romantic in the ornately woodworked dining area.
2. Impeccable service. We have been here four times so far and have had the same server, he provides an upscale dining experience with a level of class and respect that took us aback at first. Casual attire and highly affordable, this place makes you feel valued every time.
3. Awesome food! Always cooked to perfection; we usually order Samosas and Pagdi Chat ( sort if a citrus, fresh and healthy take on nachos is the only way we've come to describe it to people), Garlic and spinach naan, Chicken Tikka Masala and Sag Paneer. Portions are excellent! you see a relatively small dish initially but soon find that it feels never ending. 
4. extensive wine selection accompanied by a proper presentation always puts the icing on our healthy and flavorful meals.
5. Spice range is well explained and the raita is a great balancer.

Ordered off the lunch special & got the Chicken Tikka & Dewane Handi as it came as a combination meal that also had a soup, naan & basmati rice with it. The basmati rice was dry & stuck together in a way that it would seem that it was quite possibly rice from the day before. The Chicken Tikka was ok but needed more sauce on it. Only 3 small pieces of chicken on the plate which was a bit disappointing. The Dewane Handi was just ok. I had to put more salt on it to get the flavor to pop a bit. Naan was just ok.

6.  Dewane Handi - this spinach dish did not impress me much, and nor did I even remember eating it!  haha! 

Out of everything, the sea bass was my least favorite, and my favorites were between the tender lamb and the fluffy yet crusty nan bread!  So good!  From what I've experience, Indian food is always pricier than other foods, but I had such a good experience, I guess the price was fine to me.  

Conclusion:  I'm sorry that Brenda L did not have as good of an experience as I did, but I was a happy camper!  Going back for more.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,2,2,4,NHCYdWJJ9BGFw7N9LgewXA

One thing that really surprised me was the price of everything. Sucks when you're a penny pinching college student who's hungry as hell. Regardless i asked for a chicken tandoori. The cook was handling my order and recommended i get the day's special instead which was only 13.95. Being hungry i didn't care and the faster i can pay results in the faster my food arrived.

Chicken...Special (13.95)
I'd never thought i'd be using this word to describe Indian food but here it goes, This dish was a bit bland at first. Not bland as in lacking flavor, it had plenty of that. A few heavy pinches of kosher salt fixed it right up. No clue what it was called but it was hardy with a rich flavorful sauce, large cuts of tomatoes, onions, and the deboned chicken. 

Garlic Nan
Very strong garlic presence. nice and coarse hunks of garlic on top of the nan. Could have been crispier. It was a bit soggy but could have been from the to go bag.

Overall this place is pretty good and with it's close location it can easily become a regular for me. From 11am - 2pm is their lunch specials and dishes are advertised at or around 6 dollars.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,4,GsHe3abEvW4qEgbWUXFA9Q

Just seemed like it was made with as cheap of chicken as possible. I'm not knocking dark meat, I love me some chicken thighs and there may have been some white meat in there but there was so much fat on it that it was difficult to eat and tell.  Such a bummer because my wife and I love Indian food but this is the only one in this area. Sucks because we ordered delivery via stub hub so that I didn't have to leave the house tonight, but instead I have to put my outside clothes to go get something else and we wasted 50 bucks.  To put this review into perspective, I felt compelled to do so under the assumption that posting on Yelp is the dorkiest thing I could possibly do and I hope the restaurant owner takes this feedback as an opportunity to adjust his selection of chicken used to appeal more to the masses instead of those looking for something more authentic.

- Ordering was a chore
- The food smelled old

- Don't go here

Hers my long review...

I didn't know Mantra Masala existed so I was stoked to find an Indian restaurant so close to where I live. 

I called to place a pick up order and the guy taking my order seemed like he was on another planet. It wasn't a language barrier issue either. 

He got my name wrong at least ten times. I knew I was really in for it when I started ordering the food. I asked how many samosas were in one order and he said ""one"", so I said I will have four samosas thinking I would get four samosas with my order. I got home and opened the carton to see eight samosas. There are two samosa per order so I spent loads of money on some vegetables wrapped in fried dough.

Then I ordered a paneer dish a curry dish and onion kulcha bread. It literally took this guy five minutes to figure out what I wanted. I could hear him flipping through the menu trying to figure out what I was ordering. After a while, I heard another guy rip the phone out of the first guys hands to get my order in properly. 

I skeptically drove to pick up the order. It was ready for me and I paid. Thankfully there was no issue with picking up the food or paying. 

I got home, opened up my order and everything looked good, but the contents smelled musty. You know, like an epically old crazy lady's home smell? Yeah, like that. 

The samosas were huge. They tasted ok. My paneer and curry dishes were bland. How can that could happen with Indian food??? How can Indian food be bland???!!!

The rice was dry and yellow. This was the first Indian place where I was served yellow rice. It's usually white rice. 

The onion kulcha? Well, let's not even talk about that. *barf*

The food sucked and I had double the amount of samosa that I ordered. The only things I liked were the chutneys that came with the samosa. 

I literally threw everything out but the samosa because I was so friggin hungry. 

Do yourself a favor. Drive the extra few miles and eat the delicious Indian food at Curry Leaf Flavors of India on Ft. Apache Rd.  The food there is fantastic! The service is on point too. 

Sorry, Mantra Masala. I thought I found a gem, but I didn't. I found a crazy old lady's musty smelling couch in a bag with eight samosas

2250586,2012-01-18,6,hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw,"Mantra Masala is proof that I'm a bad girl and someone wants to punish me.

This is the only Indian option on my (southwest) side of town, and it's surely just about the only Indian restaurant without a buffet. The cruelty!

(They had a buffet for about five minutes a few summers ago. Eight dishes, heavy on the okra, heavy on the management's voiced opinion that it wasn't cost effective to run a buffet.) 

For a long time I thought the lack of Indian buffet in my stretch of the valley was just meanness on the universe's part, even though the taste of Mantra Masala's food - be it dine-in or carry-out - was never really above three stars. I know they market themselves as ""healthy"" cuisine, and I suppose it shows.

But we finally called it quits on our frequent take-aways after paneer portions became more and more skimpy, naan often ended up kind of burned or tasteless, and we realized that there was a lot of ""miss"" and not really a single ""hit"" to justify being *that* lazy. Sometimes you just have to shrug and order a pizza instead.

I don't know how Mantra Masala has managed to survive - maybe they do because they're the only option out here - but if they're looking for more customers (and if the parking lot is any indication, surely they are), I beg them to consider the following:

1. Drop the healthy angle. It tastes weird. 

2. Become a copycat of the successful Indian restaurants elsewhere in Las Vegas. I can't believe I'm advocating unoriginality, but at this point I just want to be able to get some solid, good Indian food near home. Being a copycat includes copying the proportions - no more skimping on paneer cubes!

3. Do a lunch buffet with some interesting angle. (This is where you should get creative.) Maybe a really wide range of desserts? No one else seems to play that up. Live music? Dance? Yeah, I know the old lunch buffet didn't work, and maybe it's because the population is more sparse out here, but it also was a boring buffet of limited items. (We looked over every dish, apologized, and left.) Maybe not every day, but at least run a buffet on weekends.

4. Cooking classes. DO THEM NOW. I have begged Indian restaurants across the valley to offer these and everyone just laughs politely and nothing happens. Here's a way to sell the buffet, too - as in, come for the buffet and get X amount off the cooking class immediately afterward. I know so many people who've expressed interest in learning how to cook Indian food, and at best we get the odd demo here and there. No one is doing this. 

Offer hands-on classes on Saturday afternoons, just after the buffet, and change the topic every week. Gulab jamun class? I'm there. Naan in a home-oven class? Enrolled. Buttery paneer for the gringo soul? Let me BE the valedictorian!

(Note: Um, but you need to do steps 1 and 2 first, okay? I don't want to learn how to cook what you currently have going on.)

5. Explore the hipster space. Chutney tasting hour with matched cocktails? Bollywood pajama parties? Loaner saris at the door for those who want to get in the spirit?

6. Update your website. Turmeric has been the ""Spice of the Moment"" for, literally, years, and you don't even serve the kind of food where people are happy to walk away with turmeric-stained fingers. How about online ordering for take-away?

Mantra Masala, I'm sharing these ideas because I want some tasty Indian near my home. Right now you're providing meh food at ambitious prices. Please fix this. I want to cheer for the home team. RAH RAH RAH! GIMME KOR-MA!",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,10,5,2,9IjJHejiUVortDk1AcNeww

Also, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.  But I always have to add salt to the entrees.

Pricing is a kinda high and they charge you a lot for every little thing - rice, raita, mango pickle.",ybcBGlRG0qYHI9DbXjfznA,6,5,1,gs2bupHiniDqeUyKEW0b4Q

This place has never been our favourite Indian option as far as flavour goes, but for a local place where we can get some takeout it more than fit the bill.

Unfortunately, on our last couple of visits the naan has been extremely rubbery and we've felt like they have really skimped on the content of our dishes that we ordered. Our Shahi Paneer on the most recent occasion contained a mere FIVE chunks of paneer in a sea of sauce. Sorry guys, but when you're charging slightly higher prices than average for your entree portions already, I expect more than 5 cubes of cheese for my money. On our previous visit we fared a little better, with seven bits, but it's still not very much is it?

The Naan was the saving grace of their lunch special. Soft, chewy (in a good way) and the only thing we could scoop up our gravies with (since the rice was not fit to eat).

I've had better... in fact...  I've only had better than this, and it has always been much cheaper.  This is like... the Panda Express of Indian food with a really nice atmosphere (this should have been my first warning).  The total bill for two people came out to about $50.  A few weeks ago I was in a pretty shady looking Indian restaurant (most of the best ones are shady looking) in San Francisco and we ordered a LOT more, it tasted better, and the bill didn't even make it to $30.

If you're totally clueless about Indian food and your idea of travel is driving down to Mesquite, then this place is probably perfect for you.  Unfortunately, I didn't come to have American food with an Indian theme, I was looking for something that had the rich, deep, and complex flavors that I'm used to.  The lowdown:

Naan - Ahhh... the king of breads, naan bread usually whisks my senses away at the very first bite.  I'm a bread lover, and naan is easily one of the best types of bread in the world... usually...  This one was... good.  Not great, certainly not amazing like it should be... just good.

Garlic naan - I have to give them kudos on their garlic naan.  It had a better flavor than many of the others I've had.  Garlic naan usually doesn't stack up against regular naan, but this one was actually better than their plain naan.  That's not the best compliment, but it's the only one they're going to get today!

Chicken Tikka Masala - Hmm... Like naan, it is one of the dishes that I judge an Indian restaurant on...  Usually, rich, creamy, and surprisingly complex... this one was decent.  But a bit bland, with none of the richness and depth that I'm used to.  It was more like Chicken Campbell's-tomato-soup Masala.

Chicken Mantra - It tasted.... thin...  Like a watered down version of what it was meant to be.  The flavor was actually decent, but once again lacked richness and depth.  

The rice was a disappointment, and a previous Yelper's comment about it being a ""mouse sized portion"" wasn't too far off the mark.  A big mouse, to be certain.... but still a mouse.

My experience is based on growing up eating at NYC's Curry Row (6th St B'twn 1st and 2nd Ave) then the few years in my late 20's living in Dirty Jersey I was exposed to a ton of great Indo-Paki restaurants. So, Why the background information? Simply put I'm cynical and spoiled and didn't expect the desert to have such BOMBay (ha-ha) Indian restaurants... But we do!
Okay, If Indian cuisine was bad Karaoke (metaphorically speaking.) and there was a contest like...American Idol; and I was on a panel with Simon, Paula, and Randy I know we would unanimously vote Mantra Masala-Healthy Cuisine from India, to be the next American Idol.
 There's never a wait and the prices are fair. (Dinner price-appetizer, variety of Nan, main course and drink 20-30$ per plate.) The service is prompt and extremely friendly. Tonight we brought a newbie to Indian cuisine and the owner (I think she was the owner?) She was nice enough to explain what's what to our friend. 
 Tonight I had the Chicken Vindaloo and I'm still thinking about how awesome it was. The Nan & Onion Culcha is made on site, piping hot and oh so good. The Samosa mixed appetizer is one you can't go wrong with. I gauge my restaurant on the Chicken Tikka Masla and Mantra Masala passes with flying colors. The Tikka & Tandoori is spiced perfectly and always juicy. The Mango Lassi and their Taj Beer are excellent (probably not together.) This place is extremely Vegetarian friendly.
 I'm psyched they are getting ready to start a lunch buffet next week. The place has doubled in size within the last couple of months. It's a clean place with a dark and cozy atmosphere. The decor is a lot more modern then any other place I've been.

Pros
Very close
nice decor

Cons
food
-Mantra mixed appetizer which includes the samosa, onion bhaji, and chicken pakora
-----samosa:  filled with lentils, I am used to the potatoes filling, so didn't like this one
-----onion bhaji:  just taste like fried batter to me
-----chicken pakora: dipped in the tamarind chutney...what do you get?  Sweet and sour chicken!!!!  My piece of chicken fell out of the thick cold batter. 
-Mantra Mixed Grill (They are tiny portion, like others have mentioned, but it's all good since it's the quality that I want to try out at this place)
-----Barah Kabob:  the part that was super grilled was ok, but the middle part tasted kinda mushed in a way
-----Chicken tandori/chicken bazari:  I don't know..I tried other pieces that are not chicken tikka, and it tasted kinda grainey, so I stuck to the chicken tikka
-----Chicken Tikka:  this taste the most familiar. But...I have not seen such a small piece. 
-----Masala chai tea:  it kinda taste like the bigelow spiced chai tea that I could easily steep at home, office, anywhere.

After a few search from fellow yelpers I decided that Mantra Masala is exactly where I need to be.  Luckily I managed to kidnap 2 buddies of mine to help me ""experiment"" a little bit more since this was my second time ever having Indian food. 

Both my friends were new to Indian food as well I figured I'd order the Mantra's Mixed Grill which consist of most of their specialties for everyone to share; Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka, Bazari Chicken, and Barah Kabab (lamb).  All of which were pretty tender and spiced really well.  

Our server looked at us if like that wasn't enough, so I asked him to recommend us another dish to which he concluded that we should try the Chicken Tikka Masala. OMGggg this stuff was amazing!!  I didn't know this, but this is exactly what i've been looking for!! Not Curry! Spiced, boneless chicken roasted in clay oven, cooked in creamy tomato sauce.  I wanted to call my mom and cry because it was so darn good! ;(
There were plenty of sauce left that we dipped our Garlic Nan (leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic) into it, poured some over rice, and also dipped some of the Mantra's Mixed Grilled stuff into it as well :X

I could see why he wanted us to order the 2nd dishes because the portion were not that big at all.  Just enough which is perfect because we don't need to stuff ourselves with too much goodness.  A tad bit pricier, BUT over at Mantra Masala it's clear that they implement the philosophy's ""quality over quantity.""

It was a little slow, my water ran out a couple times (spicy food + small water glasses = water refills for me), and one of the employees (family-owned I'm assuming) had a phone that kept ringing which was a little annoying. However, I'd say if you order an appetizer, you'd be fine.

I ordered the chicken tikka masala and lamb korma with garlic naan. The food was very bland and a weird texture. The rice tasted like it was made in a rice maker the day before and was very mushy. The naan was hard and lacked in garlic flavor. Save your money and go somewhere else. Waste of $45!,LgsQRPydkTeOl2s1ItgfOw,0,0,1,hOT_MWXWIyRzoVe0JsXicw
4620605,2011-03-31,1,hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw,"In a word: yummy! Indian food tends toward the expensive side, so I appreciate Mantra Masala's lunch special menu. I went with ""Lunch Two"" featuring Chicken Tikka Masala. It comes with a side of Dewane Handi (spinach puree with assorted vegetables), some seasoned Basmati Rice, and a decently sized piece of Naan.

To be real, it's not a whole lot of food for $7.95 + tax. But Mantra preaches healthy food. With that in mind, it's a good portion and definitely satiated my appetite without making me overly full. And most importantly, everything was delicious. I prefer the flavor of Mantra's Chicken Tikka Masala over Mint Indian Bistro's. The Naan was cooked perfectly and the Dewane Handi was surprisingly good (I've never had it before).

I haven't eaten dinner at Mantra. Looking at the dinner menu prices, I probably wouldn't want to. For lunch, however, it presents a nice option. It is a bit far from work, but it's a quick zip up the 215. I'll definitely get lunch there again some day.

Note: A sign outside advertizes lunch specials under $6. This is misleading. One lunch dish is $5.95. The rest are $7.95 or higher.

The Husband and I shared:

* Lamb Biryani ""Baked casserole of basmati rice and lamb richly flavored with saffron."" ($16.95) - The Husband has a special liking to biryani and immediately looked through the menu for this item.  He ordered it spicy and definitely enjoyed it, more so with the leftovers the next day.

* Malai Kofta ""Mixed vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce."" ($12.95) - I'm all about any kind of creamy sauce and there are very few I don't like in Indian cuisine.  Their version was super tasty and really good with the garlic nan bread.  Yum!  I chose medium for my spice.  It also came with rice.  The dumplings were just okay though.

* Garlic Nan ""Leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic in the tandoor."" ($2.95) - When going nan, garlic is the only way to go.  So good, I could only wish for more.

Overall, the food was pretty good.  Our waiter was definitely attentive, until he got stuck on the phone with a to go order.

We all grabbed a Lunch #2: Chicken Tikka, Dwane Handi, seasoned rice, naan and tomato soup. It was good, but not the best. Chiken tikka was juicy, but the tikka sauce seemed less complex than others. Dwane Handi is good, tomato soup was pretty standard, naan was okay. The portions aren't that big, but it did the trick. I just was more sad about the tiny dollop of rice. I mean isn't that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauces and flavors of the dishes? By the end I was just taking spoonfuls of the dishes since I was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesty. This Asian has to have rice!!! 

$7.95 isn't bad for a lunch, but with a lot of Indian places offering a buffet for $9-11 it isn't necessarily value when compared, but good value for being the only Indian in the SW and few places with lunch specials there.

Service wasn't really personable. We didn't get any drink refills and when ordering drinks he took mine and the BFs drink order and turned around without asking our friend if they want a drink. No drink for you!

I've been to another Indian restaurant called Tamba before, and I wanted to see how Mantra Masala was like in comparision to my experience at Tamba.  I went to Mantra Masala recently for dinner with some friends.  This restaurant is small and hidden away, so we almost missed it.  The restaurant was smaller than I expected, and the lighting was quite dim, with ethnic music playing quietly in the background.

All four of us also had the Garlic Nan and Spinach Nan.  The Chicken Biryani was a bit mushy and not that remarkable.  My friend liked her Vegetable Samosa, but she didn't like her Lamb Vindaloo that much.  I tasted the Lamb Vindaloo, and I actually liked the potatoes in the dish, and the lamb was pretty tender.  The Lamb Mantra was pretty good, nice and spicy, and we also liked the Spinach Nan dipped in the yogurt they gave us.

(On a side note, I think M Resort does modern with more grace than Aria.) I had wanted to try Mantra Masala because it is featured on lvvegan.com (great resource for you Las Vegan vegans), and because it was on the way, we stopped in. 

My theory is that Mantra is hoping that there are some Indian-food lovers within a 3-mile radius who don't want to venture far. If that were me, then I would be pleased with the offerings. We had dal, dewane handi and naan. The dal was more tomato-y than varieties I have experienced, but the flavors and spice levels were solid. (We asked for hotter than ""white people hot"", and they interpreted that nicely.)

The naan was fine, not spectacular. 

However, the real disappointment were the prices, especially given the mouse-sized portion of rice that comes with an entree. While $30 for 2 is not an expensive dinner, when you are staring at an entree, a side, a peck of rice and a basket of naan, you start to fantasize about the $19 for 2 spread you could be noshing on at the Namaste buffet. 

And, although we were not there for lunch, they gave us a lunch special menu to look over. There was one under $6, but it is only rice and one entree. No buffet. No deal. I truly wonder how an Indian restaurant can neglect the beauty of a lunch buffet. It is the only buffet I will eat.

In closing, if you are within walking distance to Mantra Masala, it is probably the best food you could walk to, which might sound like an insult, but I mean it is a 3-star compliment.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,7,1,3,8hzHnxhiqt6iLNzAhib-ow

5827697,2015-04-24,4,hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw,"Oh boy. A rare bad review. Let me state clearly that I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt. At first I thought ""Maybe it's because I'm here on (insert any day of the week but Monday)"", or maybe because ""I'm here (alone/with a date/with colleagues)"" . a half-dozen ""benefits of the doubt"". No more! I'm never going back.

No cocktails, no beer, only wine. ""Lunch Specials"" are advertised, but apparently no lunch buffet. In no way could this restaurant be considered competitive. Not in the West End of London (by far!), not in Silicon Valley, not in Washington D.C. ,  and not even in the desert wasteland of Indian Cuisine that is The Southwest Neighborhood of Las Vegas. Even in a field of 1, this restaurant doesn't rate.  

Unless you live in the Southwest Neighborhood, you would never know this place exists except for listing conglomerators with apps in the app store. And that's probably just as well . Service is consistently slow, though courteous. This is truly the only Indian restaurant west of Decatur but you would never know it. Ask for a booth or table right next to the telephone...so you can listen to the chirping of the ringer ring of the hook the -entire- length of your dinner. This is a classic example of a poorly-run restaurant that gives Las Vegas restaurants a bad name.  Why is the phone ringing off the hook? Because everybody from a 10-mile radius is ordering from one of those UHAUL-style food delivery places and this is the only Indian-cuisine restaurant in the area. Is the food authentic? Is the food fairly priced? Is the wine list good? I  think the answers to these questions is ""probably, yes"", but really what is ""authentic Indian cuisine""? If you read the original owner's numerous publicly-available print-media articles you would conclude there is no more  ""authentic Indian cuisine"" than this restaurant. I  don't think most people who are frequent customers choose to eat here because of this restaurant's value, authenticity, or wine list...and really couldn't care less about the poor service. I  think most frequent customers of this restaurant eat here because they work in the nearby Dignity Heath San Martin hospital complex, they live in the traffic-jam-central nearby housing developments of  Mountain's Edge or Rhodes Ranch (both developments notoriously crammed to the gills with more residential units than can be supported by the surrounding businesses causing huge infrastructure problems... ) or any of the mega-complex apartment villages that plague the Southwest Neighborhood. This restaurant will never attract a sufficient level of tourist traffic because of its location, and there is no alternative restaurant of this ethnic specialty within any reasonable amount of driving time, and the residents of the aforementioned housing developments and local employers like the hospital are totally accustomed to poor quality and poor service, so this business will always remain. 

The ambience of the restaurant holds no value for a romantic liaison, a business conversation, or even a large gathering like a UYE. Only those with a LOT of time on their hands come here at night. Like only retirees and families with multiple children bother coming here at night (which describes the predominant makeup of those who live in this neighbourhood). 

I  doubt anybody but the management of this restaurant and Yelpers who will never have the chance to visit this restaurant will ever read this review. That being said, I offer one piece of advice, and I  bet you can't guess what it is.... Is it ""Try the Lamb Vindaloo"" or ""Save room for a Mango Lassi""? No. It is simple: Bring a bottle of water in your purse when you come here for dinner. Better yet, just go next door to Teriyaki Madness and save your money.

(Why is this restaurant's ambience poor? The telephone ringing constantly, for starters. Secondly, the interior design seems like it was designed in some computer game like ""The Sims"" or by midgets with vengeance against tall people. Also, the second booth has cloth so thread bare the stuffing is poking out. The booths are placed so close together you have to be a little person to fit into them without feeling like the table is poking you in the stomach and I am by far certainly not a candidate for weight loss! The ""mantra"" here should be ""if you have time to lean you have time to clean"" but it is, sadly, not.)",bP1-iaqAuy4tEoviQaxJrA,10,5,2,S2903i4LCSjC-GUhbLQGag

Nice small place.",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,0,0,3,W85-FqkE3fG6R7qlrvnkRA
