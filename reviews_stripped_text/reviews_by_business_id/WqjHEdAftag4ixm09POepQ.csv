The line was only about 8 people long API figured it would be quick, ended up waiting for 45 minutes. Figured it might be pretty good pizza for this long of a wait.

Wouldn't go out of my way for it, but its awesomely convenient at the end of the night when staying in Flamingo. If you are getting the slice, make sure to check out whats available and what looks freshest before ordering. A ""slice"" is really a quarter of a pizza and they will cut in half when serving it, so if you are just wanting a quick small bit its good to share. Its a thicker type crust pizza which some have noted they don't like, but if you do its quite soft and delicious. pretty cheap at around $6 for a slice.",oYgI-4jEZzuz8hCYKXaHTw,0,0,3,Ghx4bFB1czk8aa1HSSXTqA

I would really only go to this place if I was staying at the Flamingo hotel and I was desperate for food (either due to laziness or time constraints).  And upon both of those circumstances (it was 1 AM and we were deathly lazy) did we pop into this Pizza Joint.

At something like $5 a slice or $18 for the whole pizza, we opted for the whole for cost efficiency.  There was only one worker and it took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out, post-ordering!

We take it back to our room and munch on the soggy slices with tough crusts.  I think we each ate one piece before giving up on the dream.  However, the dream began to take a small form of life when we discovered that we had cold pizza upon waking up with a late-morning Vegas hangover.  I think that cold pizza hit the spot more that morning than it did the night before, piping hot.

I was okay with that, but she needs a lesson in customer service. For the cheap price, it was good, but it would have been way better if the pizza was served hot.

3112232,2015-11-13,2,WqjHEdAftag4ixm09POepQ,"This was one of the first surprises that I received at the Flamingo hotel & casino. Upon arriving late and making your way through the casino and past all of the carnival barkers wanting to sell you a timeshare, the Pizza Joint was a welcome sight to get some form of decent food in my system prior to passing out. Not only that, the quantity size of the pizza for the price was unexpected. 

Pizza usually starts at $4.50 for one topping. You think that you are getting one slice, right? In actually, you are getting two slices, which I thought was pretty cool considering that most places in a casino resort are expensive. I honestly thought that I had someone else's order when the lady called me up to receive my orders, which looked like double portions. With her big Cheshire cat grin, she assured me that the orders were indeed mine. 

The Pizza Joint has several tables directly across from it, unless you want to sit at the bar area. While at the tables, you can observe the natural wildlife that is part of the Flamingo's outdoor resort area. The pizza itself is typical New York style crust and cheese, yet for $4.50? I'm not complaining. In addition, the venue serves breakfast pizza and other assortments in the morning if you want something quick.",0sl4I8R7znWXp_K4A0nZ_w,3,2,4,KvDOVKXJebqyKAZX3ECFnQ

A slice cost $5, and a whole pie was $20. I was with my sister so it was worth it to get a whole pizza. You have to eat this pizza fresh though, like when they give it to you. I had a slice only because I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel  and I'm glad I did. While hot, it was good. I planned on eating another slice or two when I got to my room, but by the time I got there the pizza was cold. Usually, pizza made not even half an hour ago would still be good.

Holy s**t bro, these slices are huge! I liked the Sausage (3 1/2 stars) better than the Pepperoni (3 stars), but both of them needed to spend a few more minutes in the oven because the crust wasn't fully cooked.

The pizza was good, I ordered a pepperoni and I had enough to cut it down the middle split it with my wife.  

Now I didn't give this five stars because of two different reasons.  When you buy a soda it is a fountain soda and you don't get any refills and its pretty small.

First, some background: I had just gotten off the High Roller and spent some time at the Polaroid Foto Bar. It was too late to hit up Guy Fieri's place, so we decided to drive back home and maybe hit up a Denny's along the way but then this place appeared. The line was pretty along, but it was moving fairly quickly as they had a ton of pizzas in the oven moving along pretty good. 

Now, on to the good stuff. I ordered to pizza and soda combos, which came out to about $22 (strip prices!). My friend ordered a pepperoni and I ordered the Hawaiian, which were served to us in like 2 minutes. Man, the pizzas were absolutely perfect. The cheese and both pizzas were perfectly melty and stretchy and gooey and, at least on my pizza, it was seasoned perfectly. I thought the crust was really good for being a basic crust (not seasoned like other places) and perfectly chewy. As for the amount of food you get, it's a bigger serving. They're more like Sbarro slices than Domino's slices. 

All in all, it was a really good pizza. Like I'd go back for more if it weren't on the strip. I guess you might be wondering then why this place is only getting four stars from me and not five? I'll tell you: I've only been there once. I now feel reluctant to give a place a perfect score if I've only been there once because I cannot speak to the consistency of their product or service.

I suppose it doesn't help that the Flamingo hotel in which the Pizza Joint resides in doesn't have fridges in their room. (Go figure.) If you're dying of starvation, sure, get a slice.",-n0yPHQVgIEejxfmtzezDw,0,0,1,EiBLOnRQauEmsP3sism78Q

Needless to say when I stumbled back to The Flamingo at some god forsaken hour like 6:30 am, it was time for me to get some pizza myself. They were JUST opening (thank god), so I enjoyed a doughnut while I waited and ordered a ""slice"" of sausage pizza. I say ""slice"" because they actually serve you TWO ENORMOUS pieces of pizza. I f-cking loved the crust. Seriously, it was delicious. I would eat there again. And again. It's good pizza. 

...even if you're sober. :)",-AGLoncQKBFVYCkfe59Hmg,0,2,5,7A-MYvDtDvHp4Sd6ECvDcg

Let me begin by saying I will NEVER EVER come here again! Terrible, terrible service is an extreme understatement. Emilio, the awesome (yes, I'm being sarcastic) pizza chef felt very empowered the evening we were there and demonstrated that by shoving a pizza in my cousin's face after she questioned why it was taking 35 minutes for a pizza and seeing countless people who came after her walk away with their orders. He was confrontational after that and rambled on and on for another 5 minutes before he tossed a pizza in a box and literally rimmed it in her face, mind you she caught this on camera. 

What followed was even more unbelievable. After a manager was summoned to ""fix"" the problem, we waited for 30 minutes, gave a thorough explanation of the events to this ""manager"" when he arrived - all while he retorted with very sarcastic comebacks, then he responded by saying there was nothing he could do or would do because this was the ""only pizza chef"" he had and wasn't about to lose him. Unbelieveable!!  Both the managers that responded to the complaint were RUDE and I could not believe the way they handled things, especially considering my friend attempted to play the video back and they refused to acknowledge what was clearly documented.

Because the management refused to do anything, she proceeded to file an incident report with security. It was terrible and the lack of professionalism altogether may have been enough to keep me away from the Flamingo all together. All these months later, I'm still in disbelief. I sure hope F & B stepped up their game and got rid of those 2 clowns!!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,1,0,1,LDRo67nBP79AMzBsjjTLDQ
