My mom and I are on a more healthy diet and coming here kind of threw us off but you know it would have been longer going home and preparing something ourselves. 

I don't always have my mom pay for my food but without her saying anything I had a feeling she wanted to do it because I had bought breakfast, lunch and dinner for her several times within the last few weeks (all spaced out of course). It was a great night because I got to spend some quality time with just my mom.

Then I remembered I was a vegetarian for 3 of the 4 years I lived in Las Vegas. No problem, the off -menu grilled cheese (FYI, I had heard that they used to avoid cross contamination, but I believe they now have to make the grilled cheese on the same griddle as the meat - so keep that in mind if you're hard-core) is always a good simulacrum of In-n-Out goodness for vegetarians. The oozing melted cheese slices fondling the intricate crevasse created by the folds of the crisp lettuce and a layer of fresh piquant onions with that freshly sliced tomato and special sauce. Mmmmmm.......

Agreed. This is hands down one of the best fast food chain burger joints out there with everything made fresh to order. This ain't no Mickey D's!

Avoid this place during the lunch rush - esp. when UNLV's in session. Otherwise, it's best when you arrive a bit earlier (11am) or later in the afternoon (after 2pm). Also good after you've been trolling down Maryland Pkwy and the local bars across the street and just need something to soak up the ethanol (C&A, Freaking Frog, Yayo's, etc.)!",v2C4S11PHzLEXKeF5kvTJA,0,0,4,8bBOpp39g4EK9peQt8EIGA

The quality control here should be studied by all other businesses. By my calculations, I have eaten In N Out over 700 times. They have forgotten something on my order ONCE, and were extremely apologetic about it.

The food is always immensely satisfying. Few places scratch the itch like In N Out does.

Nothing about the burger technically is that different from other chains but the quality of the ingredients and the simple menu is what elevates it above other places.  I like how the bun is not a cheap tasteless dry pre-packaged product but works well to round out the burger.

Nach dem obligaten Shoppen war uns nach einer guten, amerikanischen Mahlzeit. Sie fragte uns, ob wir In-n-out Burger kennen würden. Wir verneinten und meinten, Burger Läden gäbe es doch genug. Wir haben später verstanden warum wir da extra hingefahren sind:
Es ist eine kleine Fast Food Kette die nur in Kalifornien, Nevada, Utah und Arizona auftritt. Alles in privater Hand, kein Franchising. Es gibt eigentlich nur Cheeseburger und Hamburger - auch als Doppeldecker, dazu Pommes und ein kleine Auswahl an Shakes und Softdrinks. Das war's. Allerdings wird alles frisch gemacht: die Fritten werden aus Kartoffeln vor Ort geschnitten, der Salat vor Ort portioniert, das Fleisch vor Ort aus frischem (nicht gefrorenem) Fleisch durchgedreht usw. Jeder Burger wird frisch gemacht. Und wenn man drei Scheiben Gurke aber keine Tomate und drei Tropefen von einer speziellen Soße haben möchte machen sie das auch. Und wenn man keine Brötchen mag, dann packen sie den Burger in Eisbergsalat Blätter ein und nennen es Animal Style - Burger. Die Variationen sind schier unmöglich. Nach kurzer Wartezeit wird dann die Kassenzettel Nummer aufgerufen und das köstliche Fast Food kann am Counter abheolt werden.
Selbst hartnäckige Fast Food Verweigerer werden hier weich - es schmeckt einfach göttlich amerikanisch burgermässig. Probiert es aus! Preise normal - Bedienung hart aber herzlich, dafür schnell.",sIYSICJxD0ro0cmNi5fMqw,0,0,5,hz5pqg2e1mB1lRFFxWu5xQ

Had it here twice, super busy at Lunch Time.. but honestly it wasn't what I remembered. The burger was just okay. I actually didn't mind not finishing it when I had to leave quickly. Which is pretty rare for me. The food I do like I will frequent and give good business to, but after having it here twice I don't really have any desire to try it again. 

Burger seemed over cooked, and too much iceberg lettuce for my liking. Personally, on a burger I think it should be either alot of romaine lettuce or spinach, or just a little bit of iceberg. I find that when you have too much Iceberg lettuce( which has very little taste and adds nothing special to the burger) that is makes the burger have less taste, flavor, and overall makes the burger lack anything special or memorable.

Shakes are decent, but nothing to write home about, just a really basic shake with no whipped cream or any other quality touch to set it apart. It was honestly such a Meh experience. 

My Sonic burger on Sahara near the dealerships is by far much better. They make their Cheeseburgers and double cheeseburgers super good. Not alot of iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, finely chopped onions, on a soft bun and a nicely done patty. Worth the slight wait at the drive thru.

I go and get one at Sonic whenever I crave a good burger, also for their shakes that are half off, which is a good deal for a quality shake with so many flavors to choose from.

 Sonic is surprisingly superior to In N Out for their burgers, and I'm not sure if its known for that, but I highly recommend if you want a good quality burger that's big, juicy, and tastes fresh.",tfkUeoQyyqjs28q2mtba5g,1,0,2,4f4l__OihNJEr0UJBLfEoQ

From the cheap food to friendly service who wouldn't be?

You have two options when ordering, either drive-thru or order and sit down inside. The lines can get pretty outrageous especially during the lunch hour, so just beware. Although the line does move fairly quick, at least through the drive thru.

My first meal here, I came with a friend who used to be a local in Vegas. So lets just say he knew what he was talking about. 
I ordered a regular cheeseburger with everything on it. It was roughly $2.50. It was the perfect size and absolutely delicious. Great for a cheap lunch or dinner.

Next, my friend recommended I get the meal and upgrade the drink to a milkshake. Now, it doesn't say on the menu but you can get a neopolitan shake which is chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry mixed. I fell in love with this milkshake. A must try! 

The meal comes with fries also. Now the fries are awesome because they don't add salt automatically for you. They put packets inside the bag for you to use if you want it added. In my personal opinion I like the fries unsalted, you can actually taste the potato rather than the sodium.

I had to go to In-N-Out Burger as my final meal in Vegas. I got into my cab and told him ""The closest In-N-Out Burger to the airport please."" His reaction was less than enthusiastic but I am the customer and I get what I want (within reason of course). 

I walked in with suitcase and carry-on in arm, went straight up to the cashier and ordered my college favorite:

Cheeseburger Animal Style WITH whole grilled onions, fries and a chocolate milkshake.

(Which is about... what, probably one million calories? To quote almost every rapper out there, ""I don't give a ____!"")

I don't care how long I've lived in NYC for, I still love my In-N-Out so much. The fries are just so fresh. Onions grilled and caramelized. Animal sauce dripping everywhere. Shake so thick that it's really hard to suck out through my straw.... uh hem. All of this quality I can taste and it only came out to $6.38... TAKE THAT SHAKE SHACK.

Fifteen minutes of foodgasms later and I was ready to leave for the airport. 

Till next time In-N-Out, I love you and miss you already.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
My personal side story:


If you are a visiting out of towner, do not do what I did. I honestly thought I was going to miss my flight because I had a cab drop me off here so I could enjoy my burger in peace. Unbeknownst to me that unlike NYC, Vegas cabs are not allowed to be hailed on the side of the road... So here I  am waiting at an In-N-Out for a cab that I called in because I could not for the life of me get any of the cabs driving by to pull over on this random road.

15 minutes passes... nothing.

I call the cab company and they said they have NO record of my request so I resubmit it.

Then another 15 minutes...

Then another 30 minutes...

At this point I have been waiting for a cab for an hour, my flight is in an hour and I am freaking the f*** out!!!

Luckily one man dropping off someone else earlier saw me and actually came back to get me. Thank you taxi man!!! Ironically enough my flight ended up being delayed TWO HOURS because of the one thunderstorm that happens once a summer in Vegas... so everything was fine.

So there, that was my full In-N-Out Burger story from Vegas. Enjoy.",AtZ5hAERArUCN-9L6SnoPA,11,9,5,pOUtB_-FC1QQG2DzLPjWIw

Being right next to UNLV I'm certain during the day and during semesters the place is slammed. But if you go during semester breaks, or later at night (the lobby is open until 1AM every night) crowds and wait times are actually surprisingly minimal. Usually no line and you get your food in only a few minutes. 

And I don't know if this is just at this location, or the chain has stepped up their game, but the fries seem considerably less crappy and burnt. Still not among the best fries out there but good enough to round out the meal.",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,2,3,4,kemAI_MsXy-KQZRxbPJ8zg

My favorite order is a cheeseburger, animal style, with extra chiles. Animal style just means grilled onions and thousand island dressing, but it definitely dresses up their plain burger. The various locations throughout the valley can get really crowded depending on what time you go, so that's worth considering. 

The menu is small, but that keeps the prices low! It's cheaper to get a meal for my boyfriend and I here than at any of the other fast food places. The employees are also quite friendly.

As Joyce W. knows, I've been living under a rock for some time now apparently, because I have never been to an In-N-Out Burger before. So while in Vegas traveling with a bunch of crazy cousins, we came here for lunch on the second to the last day of my vacation.

I got a Double Double which is basically a double cheeseburger with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and ketchup. I also got the Animal Style Fries that people have told me is a ""must try"". It had melted cheese, carmelized onions, and what I think is, Thousand Island dressing on it. Nothing worth ordering a second time.

The fries, by the way, suck. With or without all the stuff on it, they weren't crispy and it was boring and lame. My cousin said that I should have asked for it ""well done"". Why? To me, just make it one way. With a nice amount of crispiness on the outside. 

Lastly, the burger was a little too salty for my liking, but I guess for about four bucks, I really can't complain. This location is right next to UNLV, so if you're a student on a budget, this place is for you.

If you're a fan of In-N-Out Burger, great! It's inexpensive eats. But as for me? I'm glad I tried it, but I'm in no hurry to go back.",Blh5dkdcPRvPT9D8fMpl1A,63,53,3,cj0ABiUlgAK36JnXoAX7OA

What I mean by that is I didn't see any workers talking to one another while serving customers, or taking the occasional cigarette break in the middle of their shift. The cashier also repeated my order to make sure it was totally correct, thank you! I even had a happy employee when giving my food and upon asking for more spread :)

Facility: bathrooms=CLEAN. Finally a place that knows that toilet paper isn't an item that belongs all over the floor. Tables were also cleaned up and washed down immediately after customers left. The soda fountain station was also cleaned up many times as I was sitting waiting for my to go order.

We got there at Lunch Rush... and this location is right next to UNLV.

Be forewarned.  

The place was packed in like sardines, with people oozing everywhere.

So.  We ordered.  Animal Burgers.  Animal Fries.  

Waited about 15-20 minutes for our food.  (Seriously??)

I actually watched our burgers ""sit"" on the counter (there are no heat lamps here, people) while our fried were prepared.  For a good 3-4 minutes they sat there.  

Suffice it to say this place could use some serious expo-of-food-organization help.

Anyway.  The food, for what is is ($7.50) was fine fast food fare, as it was the first time we tried In-n-Out.  The fries this time were hot, though, and tasted better under their onslaught of melted processed cheese slice, cooked onions, and thousand islan... Uh, I mean ""Spread.""

Other than that?  It's a Fast Food Place.  They may rave about their ""Fresh Cut"" fries and their ""Never Frozen Beef""... but I still wouldn't eat one of their patties on its' own, without the helping hand of a LOT of cheese, bun, and ""spread.""

I will say this; it's the best chain fast food burger you can get in America. Now, you must remember, it is still just a burger.

Imagine the $150 burger at Daniel; will the taste stand up to the anticipation?  At some point in the continuum, no experience can possibly meet the high expectations. I was past that point, but that doesn't mean that I can't recognize this fantasticness.

What really got me was the grease.  

The grease dripping from the burger wasn't the solid grease you get from a burger at every other fast-food chain, it was probably 75% water/25% grease.  Since the patties were created with fresh, never frozen beef, you get this product.  That wasn't the only mark of quality I hung on to.

The tomatoes were more crisp than the lettuce most places, and the lettuce crunched like a potato chip.  As the pickles protruded from the sides of the sandwich, I began to ponder what I would have received if I'd ordered extra pickles.  The cheese was deli style; thick, substantive. 

I ordered the fries well-done; my mistake.  They came out like potato sticks.  Not terrible, but just stick to the regular fries.

The Neapolitan Shake - I received it before my meal was ready and drank it in seconds.  Without question, the shake was the highlight of the meal.  More dense than the McDonald's and BK shakes, thinner than a Frosty; vanilla, chocolate and strawberry never combined to create such a simple taste sensation.

All in all, a wonderful place.  For the money, it is tough to beat.  But, does it beat Ben's Chili Bowl?  A Fenway Sausage?  No.

The burgers and fries were okay, but this was not an ""OMG, BEST BURGERS EVER"" kind of experience.  Yes, they do a better job than Burger King, McDonalds, and the like, but that's not saying much, is it?  

What I liked:  The toasted buns, the burger's flavor, and the fries (like McDonald's but more potatoey)
What I didn't like:  The unbelievable busy-ness of the place, the lack of anyone cleaning tables as people left.

Located on Maryland Parkway and Tropicana Ava right by UNLV campus, this location is surely an ideal spot for anyone. The parking lot is really small for all the people that come here though. I guess it's a good thing that a lot of the people that come here are college students and they just walk or bike over to this spot. 

I've always just come here at opening for lunch so as to miss most of the lunch rush. By the time I leave though, it's packed. 

Their menu is basic, which I like. I always come in here knowing what I want as I always get the same thing. I always get the Cheeseburger combo, that comes with fries and a drink. Sometimes I get my fries ""Animal style"", which is fries topped with grilled onions and special sauce. I always ask for extra onions on my burger as well. 

Never have to wait long for my food to come out, maybe 3-5 minutes. I love how you can see how your food is made from the counter, so you always know that your food is actually fresh and made right when you order it. I love how the burger is thin as I'm not a big meat person. I want to be able to taste the other ingredients and not only meat. Fries are always nice and crispy when you get them. You can ask for extra crispy as well. 

As for my drink, I always get lemonade. Nothing special about it, but it's still good. I put in extra lemon pieces to make it more tangy.

With as many people that come through here, I am very impressed at how well they keep tables cleaned, trays picked up, napkin holders filled, floors sweep, and overall just keeping everything moving along smoothly.

the fries had kind of a stale recooked taste to them but weren't completely inedible with them being animal style i suppose.

there wasn't much business even with it being close to where one of the election's debates was being held. however, even with them having almost no traffic through their drive-thru and looking like they had little to no business inside, they were pretty slow at giving us our food.

I had perused the ""secret"" menu before coming here, so I knew what I wanted -- cheeseburger, animal style. The cashier suggested a ""combo"" so I ordered that. It came with fries and a medium drink.

Considering that everything is cooked up fresh, the wait wasn't too long. The cheeseburger was wonderful to look at - fresh, bright and tempting. One bite and I was in heaven~  The fries on the other hand were just so-so.

Things you would think would be expected of most places that serve burgers, but often these goals aren't met - except for Inn n Out. Quality burgers. All the time.

4459220,2016-06-10,7,tro-hrljuY1cUAVFYauTlQ,"Adapted from an earlier review of this place:

I teetered between giving this place 3 or 4 stars.

I like that they have a very limited menu. You have 4 options: burger, fries, soda and/or shakes. That limited menu allows for food to be made fresh and people too be served quickly.  I guess that is why they named the place in and out burger.  

You can tell they are using quality meat, and not filler meats like other places.  You also can tell that they use fresh produce.  It was cool watching the guy peel potatoes for their fries.

I have to admit one thing though, the burger is too small for my liking. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 cheese burger, a.k.a. the double-double, and actually had room for another burger.  Fries are average. You will not see this restaurant's fries in your grocery freezer like some other places has it for themselves!  Shakes are decent but small as well. 

Finally got around to trying the lemonade, and nothing special about it.

Two things make this a 4 star experience for me.  This first thing is them starting, to my knowledge, the secret menu!  I like ordering things animal style and doing the different variations that comes about from the secret menu.  Try eating a 4X4 burger...I enjoyed that all by itself!  The second thing is there is not an In-N-Out Burger franchise anywhere in Louisiana nor Houston.  Rarity gets them that extra star over a normal fast food chain.",5O0ejMUB7XHzyTf1rLu2zQ,11,7,4,j1UXkkMANU-XVnv9xEln9Q

In the Student Union alone there are a few solid options (Metro Pizza, Panda Express, Subway...), plus the options within a block of campus (Jimmy John's, Aloha Kitchen, Chipotle...). Still, given all those tasty options, In N Out is the place to go. 

In N Out has the perfect combination of factors that I look for in a place to grab food: the wait is relatively short, the food is great, and prices are reasonable. Plus, they're consistently good - unlike some of the other places nearby where you sometimes get a great meal and sometimes don't (cough Chipotle cough). 

Now, let me get into what you should order in case you don't already know: Double Double, fries (animal style) and a shake. Sure, it's like 1500 calories altogether... but man you won't regret it at all. The burgers are really, really good, the cheese is perfectly melty, the onions and lettuce and tomatoes are perfect, and the bun is great, too. It's awesome. The fries, too, are probably the best fries you're gonna get. You can watch them cut and fry them, so you know how fresh they are.

I'm happy to say that In-n-Out was worth the time I've spent listening to the countless tales of its ultra-juicy, delicious, ""best burgers ever"" and I can confirm that it lives up to its title.

We were staying at Mandalay Bay and ended up getting on the bus headed the wrong way. Lucky for us though, we realized it right away so we were planning to get off and hitch the bus going the other way, when we saw a giant sign that said In-n-Out burgers 1/2 mile down Maryland. Somehow our slight detour fared better for us because I've heard about how busy the Dean Martin one is and the one we went to by UNLV only had a few people there. Score!

I had been practicing what I was going to order from the Secret Menu so I didn't go in there looking like a newbie. I had it down pat. Two double doubles, animal style and an order of well done animal style fries. BOOM! It looked like I'd done this before. I'd read a lot of reviews about how the fries were nasty, but they were pretty good smothered in thousand island, onions and cheese AND cooked extra crispy. Not bad at all. 

The burgers were the true winner though. I want to overnight ship about 100 of those back home so everyone I know can experience this. This may sound dumb, but the cheese they use on their burgers is not the traditional Kraft cheese. Oh no, this was some extra tasty cheese-- no offense, Kraft. The burger, well you could tell that it was fresh and not frozen. It was very melt-in-your-mouth good.

The food is still decent, especially at its price point, but its not something I'm
looking forward to on future trips.

The bun tasted stale. What happened to that buttery toasty yet soft carb pillow from before? The tomatoes tasted old like they were overripen ...from a few days ago. I could barely taste the burger as if there was no seasoning and the meat wasn't fresh - did my taste buds not make it through customs? The fries were soggy, stale, and lacked seasoning. The ONLY redeeming thing about the food was the animal style. If I could order a burger and fries animal-style hold the burger and fries, I would.

We walked in and they were busy. So we had to wait a bit. It wasn't a ridiculous wait though, it just wasn't quick. We all ordered burgers in a meal, so three burgers, three fries, and three drinks. It was kind of cool to look back in the kitchen and see an employee hand cutting the potatoes for the fries. 

My brother ordered our fries to be extra crispy, which is how I always like mine. Well.. these were definitely crispy. They weren't burnt, and they get props for that. But they were actually too crispy for my taste. I didn't know that was possible. But it took away any sort of taste to them and just turned them into crispy cardboard. I wasn't a fan. But that's OK. I wish I hadn't let him order mine that crispy, so I could taste how they are normally. That would be my one regret. 

Customer service was good. I had no complaints there, our orders were correct, served with a smile, and not ridiculous in price. The restaurant had obviously just had a rush, so things needed to be cleaned, but I did see employees go out to clean as things started to settle down. 

Would I return? Probably. I mean, I don't find IN-N-Out nearly as spectacular as some people do, but that's just me. I'm always entertained by those who rave about it. But I had no complaints.
