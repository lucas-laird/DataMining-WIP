139831,2010-04-18,0,_TpHX3oQ_ZXdYiDDhFA3YQ,"Went here for a date. We showed up around 5:30 on a Friday and the place was empty. Nothing wrong with that I guess. People slowly wandered in until it was about half full around 7:00. 

We sat at a booth in the bar area in order to get happy hour priced drinks with our meal. (Apparently their happy hour drink prices are good opening to close as long as you are in the bar). I had a few beers and a caipirinha that was definitely high octane! 

The meal includes a salad but not a salad bar like you'll find at other Brazilian restaurants. That's okay, I didn't come here to eat a bunch of salad anyway. The meats were good although nothing really stood out. One I could do without was the ribs. They seemed sort of St. Louis style almost, not my favorite. The bacon wrapped turkey was good, although a dog turd wrapped in bacon would probably also be good! 

For desert we had some sort of Snickers ice cream thing, that disappeared pretty fast, yum! 

I was enticed into this place with the $29.99 per meal cost but after drinks, desert, tax, tip, etc I still wound up over a hundy, oh well we had a good time and I thought the service was great. Not too pushy at all, but they didn't forget about us either. We'll be back!",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,1,4,mKibjtK9gXiaOj64xRIe1g

OH MY GOD it was a totally different experience.  The waiter was actually scary: he seemed rude, he was totally sweaty, and he got very irritate by any questions we had about the menu.  The food took forever to come out.  It seemed like we had nothing on our plates to eat for most of the 2+ hours we were there.  We were excited about the pineapple and the filet, and after two hours of being there and asking when it was coming out, we were about to leave and it came to the table.  One of the top sirloins that was presented to us was so rare as the server sliced it, that HE told us not to eat it and took it back to the kitchen!  Another table of four was arguing with the manager about how they spent two hours there and were not served enough food for a meal!  We felt the same.  We would never go back there again for fear of a repeat of that experience.  The cost of dinner is way too high there for such crappy service and such little food.  I doubt they will succeed and stay in business with how unhappy all the customers looked last night.
I can not recommend this place.",6A1KvY0sqirf-8zyjNbHzg,1,0,1,SBkJH5jjcXX9GarSlYej1Q
390065,2010-05-06,1,_TpHX3oQ_ZXdYiDDhFA3YQ,"Dropped in last night after several hours of chasing down a uniform my nephew needed for a recital, it was around 8pm. The restaurant was quiet with a few tables open so we were quickly seated. 

Once we were seated, our server Julia tended to us, we opted for the ""All You Can Eat"" which boasted a list of about 10 different meats and the house salad. I wasn't very pleased with the house salad, however, my friends enjoyed it tremendously, the greens were fresh as if they just picked it from the garden.

We were not served the entire list of meats unfortunately that is why my rating is lower than a 4 or 5. We did however receive a few options including; tri-tip, top sirloin, sausage, turkey, parmesian chicken, pineapple - all were quite good.

Price-wise the All You Can Eat was 29.95 per person, which is not on the menu and reasonable  (if you were given all the choices.) - the wait staff was excellent - meats were really tasty and the side dishes were a winner as well. If you're opting for one of the Brazilian Cocktails - try the Ipanema - I enjoyed that a great deal. 

I highly recommend Brazilian Group for friends and family - preferably of the famished variety!",ErVFHMNR7k1pLPM4DEjjMw,2,2,3,Zc5zw8ngUz5yARQleen7SQ
721312,2010-02-07,4,_TpHX3oQ_ZXdYiDDhFA3YQ,"For what ever reason or another, this place is now called Brazilian Grill (was called Brazil Brazil).  I went there for the first time last year when it was Brazil Brazil (the first day it opened if I remember correctly--it's in my neighborhood) and the experience was FANTASTIC.  Our first experience consisted of good service, excellent side dishes served at the table, and meats cooked to perfection leaving a great impression on me wanting more and more. I raved about this place to all my friends and encouraged them to go there.  My latest experience on the other hand was a fast curve ball in a direction that left so much to be desired.  In short, I will not be going back.  If you're familiar with Brazilian churrascarias I strongly suggest you go elsewhere -- you WILL be disappointed.  This is sadly a wannabe trendy Brazilian rodizio joint that fails to grasp the true essence of what makes a great Brazilian churrascaria.  

This is a tough review for me because I really liked the place the first time I went there.  Brazil Brazil had closed down for some time, and as soon as I saw that it reopened as Brazilian Grill I didn't waste any time to get back.  My friend was in town (who happens to be half Brazilian, whom I had traveled to Brazil with in the past) so I thought, why not, I'll take him there.  

It was about 7pm on a Friday night, the restaurant half full, not busy by any means -- which is perfectly fine by us.  We were seated and I immediately noticed they were trying to 'fancy up' the restaurant in a way that was so peculiar and completely unnecessary.  We start with a choice of soup or a 'fancy' salad, neither concoctions of which were Brazilian in origin.  We were in a party of three, and our server brings two salads, and didn't return with our third salad for at least 5 minutes.  We were a little irritated at this point (and puzzled) but no worries, we let it pass as we anticipated the parade of meats that were to follow.  We wait, and we wait.  Finally a server (a passador) comes out with roasted pork.  The pork was OK.  We wait for another several minutes, and there comes some grilled chicken.  OK... the chicken was also average.  We wait another five minutes.  Here comes another guy, ""Portuguese sausage anyone?""  I expected Brazilian linguica but I took one anyway.  Finally our server comes out with some mashed potatoes, rice and black beans, farofa, mushy fried bananas and some dipping sauces we've never seen in a Brazilian churrascaria.  Ten minutes pass by, and comes the filet mignon.  Ok here we go!  Um...it's COLD in the middle, and the garlic was so strong it was more like wasabi.  Another ten minutes go by as we wait and wait, munching on some rice.  Here comes a guy with CHICKEN again.  ""No thank you.""  We wait for another ten minutes, comes PORK again.  ""Uh..no thanks.""  We ask for some Picanha (signature top sirloin).  ""Picanha..? Ok lemme go check...I think it's almost done.""  My friend asks for some Fraldinha (bottom sirloin).  ""Oh, I'm sorry, we don't have fraldinha.""  What??  Ok, how about Beef Ancho (ribeye)?  ""No, we don't have that either.""  Thoroughly disappointed at this point, my friend asks for some grilled chicken hearts.  Not my favorite, but hey, he's Brazilian.  ""Uh.. let me go check that too.""  Then, finally, comes the Picanha.  It's way too over-cooked.  We take several slices and ask for a more rarer piece.  Here comes the guy with the grilled PORK again.  After several minutes comes again the filet mignon -- which looks a little more cooked this time.   Here comes a guy with the Alcatra (top sirloin).  Finally, something that tastes decent.  After a while the Picanha comes out, rarer, the way it should be cooked.  It tasted OK at best.  We ask for it again and filled our plates with it as much as we could so we don't have to wait forever for another serving.  Here comes another guy.  ""Pork anyone?""  Uh.. no.  

I could ramble on and on about this less than mediocre experience.  One thing that was blatantly obvious to us aside from their horrible service was that the meats weren't cooked right at all and had NO FLAVOR.  We constantly found ourselves with the salt shaker throughout our meal, which is the kiss of death for a Brazilian churrasco.  Only one server we found (passador) was actually Brazilian, and the rest -- clueless.  The tall white guy with the goatee, mr. forgetful, who seemed to be the leader among the servers had such a cocky attitude it was a total turn-off.  He had absolutely no idea about Brazilian cuisine.  

I spoke briefly with the owner and I think he's Hawaiian.  With no disrespect, he's got a lot of work to do if he wants to keep this restaurant afloat.  My friend said on the way home, ""It's too bad they don't understand that Brazilian churrascos don't have to be fancy.  Flavorful meats cooked to perfection, and fast, attentive and excellent service is what great Brazilian churrascarias are all about.""  I completely agree.",YkWlehjcpSyo2ceTVBtr-g,5,3,1,GTnL5ilBC4fqVpPlzaxYtw
1957745,2010-05-20,2,_TpHX3oQ_ZXdYiDDhFA3YQ,"We tried to eat here last night. My husband has a milk and cheese allergy so we thought a meat based restaurant would be fine. 

Umm, no it wasn't. 

After sitting down we explained to the server his allergy. There were very few sides he could eat, no bread he could eat and no substitutions that could be made. 

We left. It just didn't seem worth paying for a meal he couldn't eat more than 1/2 of. 

Ironically we left and went to Roma, an Italian restaurant (land of milk & cheese),  in the same shopping center. They gave him plenty of options and brought him bread he could eat.",qnoXQsDOTOFwJEYXSCnHEQ,1,0,1,8JwgUi-6wpwrVG9JtJAp6w

4184591,2010-04-18,4,_TpHX3oQ_ZXdYiDDhFA3YQ,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

I strongly recommend you have a meal here with friends.  Great environment for eating, drinking and talking; great looking dining room, great service, good food, very attractive service staff (passadores, you know who you are), and most importantly, a surprisingly strong value.  Ask for Nicholas; he will be sure to take good care of you.

THE DETAILS:

My first instinct was to write a review of the previous reviewer's review, which seemed to be fairly dominated by how Brazilian Grill didn't meet his personal expectations for what the restaurant should have been.  This restaurant and I live in Las Vegas, a town that's cherished as often as it is whipped for its inauthenticity.  So setting that aside, let me tell you what I thought about the place.

1) Great Value.  The owner stepped up the game with an attractive dining room that felt upscale, but not self-conscious.  Basic, tasteful design elements, not overdone, but combined with the very attentive service staff, when we got the check for our party of seven, that was less than HALF what I expected to have paid for the experience, (including tasty adult beverages) you can imagine I was pretty pleased.

2) Good Presentation.  I guess you could ring up the place for doing MORE than is expected if you want to.  A nice presentation of sauces (that you could choose to take, leave or hurl to the ground if it offend thee), the solid design aesthetic of the dining room (which could have been weaker at the cost per cover, but they did it anyway), and frankly, the attractive wait staff.  Hey, I never said I was a saint; good looking staffers are a meaningful part of the experience.

3) Good Food.  A solid delivery of both product and production talent.  My friends and I were so pleased by the experience, we kept trying to find ways to upsell ourselves to increase the ticket.  Was it the greatest barbeque I've ever had?  No.  Did it need to be?  No.  Did the entire experience exceed my expectations by a mile?  Absolutely.

I strongly recommend you have a meal with friends at this restaurant.

BONUS COMMENTARY:

Our table's server was Nicholas; the ""tall white guy with the goatee"".  Let me advocate on his behalf; he was excellent, as was the rest of our table service staff, and the guy at the bar.  One man's cocky is another man's funny and helpful, so let me say that while our party of seven were under Nicholas' care, we wanted for nothing.  Was he as good looking as the passadores?  No.  But still, 2 of 7 people at our table were willing to rate him, ""adorable"", and I'm pretty sure that 28% is a passing score in the CCSD these days.  I think.",utXt0sSPm9FDlL0dQR2Alw,4,2,4,0LJguEMZN_m7ucOCbiHKKg

Salads and side dishes were marginal, but certainly satisfactory.  Wait staff and gauchos were very friendly, helpful, and courteous.  I would definitely return to this restaurant.",3xbEPGZlDIlgmWOFmadibw,1,1,4,0SCWOc2WowkRiqizzMiY8A
