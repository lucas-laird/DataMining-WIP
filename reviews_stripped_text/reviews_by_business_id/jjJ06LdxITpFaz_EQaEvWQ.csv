Will definitely not be back to this place.",4FApgKbpJUiRw7RpmTv6kA,1,0,1,EP07B0xjvfpvJElK8NOdoQ

Great food, friendly staff and good prices. This place was recently purchased by a new owner who will be doing alcoholic Boba, awesome! Can't wait to try! Check this place out!",uSacjoomHWM_OgM2iInCpA,0,0,5,i4djJF57qThI215fKMBquA
