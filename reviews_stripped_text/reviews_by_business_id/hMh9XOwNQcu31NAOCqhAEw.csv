For starters, I am an avid Indian food lover and travel to India quite often as I have friends that have family out there. I love the culture and the plethora of cuisine that different regions of India have to offer. Out of the MANY Indian places I have tried throughout Las Vegas, Taste of India is THE WORST facility I have ever tried. There are many reasons why.

First and foremost, the food. 
As I entered the place, it was almost completely empty, with only one other table occupied. (they were family of the business). As I chose a table, I walked over to scan the ""buffet"" quickly and was very surprised at what I saw. There was one isle of food, not a great selection to choose from, but just the basics such as chicken korma, tikka masala, jeera rice, etc. All the food I saw looked incredibly unappetizing. I should have left right then and there, but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt. BIG MISTAKE.
I noticed the food that almost no one has touched, literally caked on the sides of the metal bins that they were sitting in. All the food was above the temperature basin therefore it had dried out from it sitting there most likely for HOURS. All the condiments were sitting in melted ice and looked like they were just thrown in their bin. There were also a couple of flies sitting in them. I was utterly disgusted. 
At this point I really wanted to feed my insatiable need for Indian food and personally would feel quite bad If I just left this new business. It was a stupid choice that I made.
I decided to get the tikka masala and the palak paneer and some rice. 
I cannot even describe how bad this excuse for Indian food was. First, all the food that I tried was UNDER PROPER TEMPERATURE. The chicken tikka masala tasted like they mixed canned tomatoes with chicken. It was horrible and room temperature. The palak paneer was not even melted properly and the spinach almost separated from the unknown sauce that it consisted of. What was this?! 
The rice was flavorless and mushy but clumping together. This means that chances are that this rice is RECYCLED. It was by no means, fresh. Everything tasted so very bland.
I ordered naan, garlic and plain. It looked very fresh when the guy brought it out, but then I noticed that it was still very doughy. It was not even done baking all the way!
I started to become very weary of the food that was in front of me, slowly scooping up bite minutes apart and then just giving up. Not even a half hour later I started to feel the effects of FOOD POISONING. Sure enough, it was. I got really sick throughout the day and was vomiting profusely. I was very ill for the next few days unfortunately. 

Overall, the food here was a horrible selection of Indian food. The quality is by far a sorry excuse for representing Indian cuisine and these people are INDIAN! I could make a better Indian dish at home and I'm Italian! I am surprised that the health department has not shut down this place for improper food temperatures. People should not be eating here for that reason alone. 
I could go on and on about this horrible restaurant, but I feel that people should be aware of places like this who care more about money than the quality of their food and misrepresenting what Indian cuisine is all about. This place is a shame. I will never go there again.",8nAchwrSfEKafmFnAehCGg,5,1,1,5_dLMLSkdwH0t_Yo94ssng

When 40 minutes past our estimated delivery time had past, we called the restaurant. They seemed to have no idea why our food was not there and said they would check into it.  10 minutes later with no response, I called back, there was no answer the next three times. I was on the phone with grub hub, now an hour past delivery time , when the delivery showed up. I was informed they were confused because they've never delivered here before. We paid and collected our food. The food arrived luke warm and mediocre. I specified in the instructions that we would like the dishes extra spicy. They were actually really bland which is disappointing considering how much my husband and I love Indian food. The portions were small and the rice that I paid extra for was almost non existent and flavorless. First time I've ever received disappointing  white rice. I'm extremely upset , and considering the cost, which is expected when ordering Indian cuisine, not worth it. Will never order again.",EFbzfusd2XnDNozW6fyRng,0,0,1,M-kpHWYYZeq088QbDN4Zbw

We have been Las Vegas locals in the past so we are familar with other well-known offerings in the area (e..g Gandhi, India Oven etc). The food here is as good as or better than the other places that offer indian food. Besides i am originally from India so i can speak to the quality and authenticity of their offerings.

Ok, not sure of how yelp is figuring out recommended reviews since there are lots of good reviews of this place but not in the recommended ones which is what most people read.  When trying a new Indian restaurant (before I get to taste the food which really makes the quality decision), it is a real plus to see Indian customers. I have often seen tables of them here eating which implies to the authenticity of the food. 
I love Indian food, my go to style (along with Thai) while traveling & in the many cities we've lived in. We were going to 2 of the Flamingo restaurants often, until we found this place. I've only checked in 14 times, but have been there more, just sometimes too much in a rush to start savoring some goodies that I forget to grab the phone & checkin. 
Usually we come to the lunch buffet - with our appetites it's definitely the most cost effective time. Being vegan & gluten-free there are still enough choices for me to fill my plate 3 (or more) times. 
For those that like their food spicy or made to order, this is where they shine. Knowing I like spicy, when I ordered the aloo gobi the best explanation was ""total mouth orgasm"". It was so amazingly perfectly spiced. I was actually annoyed when he took a bite & also liked it so much that the ""wow that's really good"" was followed by stealing more bites. I wanted to take more home than the little bit of sauce that was left. But even that sauce which did come home cuz there was no way I was wasting it, made another awesome dish when baked with some green beans. 
So obviously I recommend this dish - tell them your spiciness happy point is. 
Also if you like your uttapam crispy like I do, let them know. They are willing to make the dishes to your preferences (unlike a certain Encino Calif restaurant I won't name here). 
I was told that there are more South Indian dishes available on weekends in addition to what is on the menu.  Which means I really need to try & work a weekend visit in so I can try new dishes since I love to try new tastes - if I can force myself not to order the aloo gobi every non-buffet visit. Granted it is sometimes on the buffet, but since few people enjoy my preferred spice level, it would be more tame. 
Ok, this review is ending now because I am obsessing about a dish I now crave but can't get to tonight. Of course I could call them for delivery.....",vMYKQeuuC9py7VkRCdAquQ,4,4,5,_h4CVcI8ahLqDGrirzseFA

2443473,2014-03-27,0,hMh9XOwNQcu31NAOCqhAEw,"Let me start by saying that I really enjoy Indian food. I've tried places throughout New York and all over Vegas and I cook a wide variety of North and South dishes at home. With Taste of India being open for 3 months now, I wanted to have high expectations for this place. It does seem like a ""hole-in-the-wall"" place given the semi-bad area but anyway, let me start.  My group and I walked in for the Indian Buffet. The place had no customers so we were the only ones. The place looked completely empty and had a rather ""cold"" feeling with little to no decor. We sat down and a couple minutes later were given water with no ice. 
We were asked what kind of naan bread we wanted then we got up over to the buffet line. While perusing the buffet line, the food didn't really look that appetizing. I got a plate full of few things like jeera rice, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and mutton korma. 

Within two minutes of eating, I quickly began to lose my appetite and here's why. The rice was extremely overcooked and possibly not made that day. It was very clumpy and soggy and had little to no flavor. Ten minutes later we received our naan (which was undercooked and very doughy) and I began dipping it into the Chicken Tikka Masala. The masala tasted like Campbell's tomato soup (I kid you not). I couldn't eat another bite of it. Everything on my plate was under temperature so my group and I started to worry whether or not we would get sick. Anything from 42-140 degree F is a temperature danger zone. Nothing was hot and the paneer cheese was very cold once bitten into. The tandoori chicken looked ""sad"" sitting there and had no flavor and reminded me of the chicken thighs I used to eat for those horrible school lunches in elementary school. There is nothing genuine about this place and frankly, it's rather sad. I don't know about you but everything about this place needs help. From the lack of decor to the most important part--the food, there is nothing welcoming about this place, it's not traditional, and it's very empty. I honestly felt like I was in that buffet scene in Vegas Vacation.  Indian food is supposed to be fresh and screaming with flavor and I do not know what this place is trying to do. I left with cramping in my stomach and felt horrible for most of the day after this. Maybe it was the combination of the food, or the temp of the food, but it is now not worth going back. 

Another bad part of this experience was we learned that they delivered.  We saw the guy with take-out containers loading them with food from the buffet line. He kept on looking over at our group. Not sure if he didn't want us to see what he was doing? Someone from my group asked if it was for delivery and he said it's for his ""friends."" Uhhh, what? 

 Please consider this review. I highly do not recommend coming here.",2LXlZrxzAyotCst00AwHeA,4,2,1,94agbO26BlyIQPvRo8wJrQ

3757679,2014-08-02,0,hMh9XOwNQcu31NAOCqhAEw,"My coworkers and I came here during our lunch hour. We arrived at 12:15 and saw that the place was empty, it was a bit dark inside, and part of the restaurant smelled like sewage. 
We were greeted by this friendly man who told us that there is no buffet since they were preparing for inspection. We got put off by the ""no buffet"" thing and started to walk out. The man then told us he would give us 10% off for the inconvenience if we ate there. So, ok, we agreed to stay and they seated us. There were 5 of us but they only gave us 4 menus. I asked if they had more, but they said those were the only ones they had... ok... so I waited for my turn at one of the menus. 
Five minutes later, he took our orders. He said that it will take 15 minutes for us to get our food. We were ok with that since it was around 12:25 and we had time to eat quick and go back to work.... we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food, so at 12:55 we asked one of our waiters to just pack up our food and we'll just take it to go since we had to get back to work. The waiter started arguing with us and told us we should eat there. What??? He refused to give us to go boxes and insisted we eat there. It took another 15 minutes of us trying to convince this rude guy to give us to go boxes and when we went to pay, they didn't give us the 10% discount that they promised. We ended up late and starving after this incident. We should walked out sooner than that, but we didn't want to be rude.

The sad part is that the food was actually good. I ordered Chiken Bharta. Their food doesn't come with rice so you have to order rice and naan separate. But it was delicious. But we couldn't even enjoy it because we were treated so badly.",cLYHWleoY6eVUVr-MIZe4Q,0,0,1,oMkIPAf2-HnjyMFujg0DGw
