The staff is super friendly and always pleasant to talk to while I'm waiting for... you guessed it Fresh fried Catfish, yams and greens.

I ordered for my husband, son and myself what I wanted they didn't have (Gumbo & Banana Pudding) they were out , so I ordered oxtails and asked if they had any other desert (they were out) it was such a bummer . BUT my whole order ended up being Smothered Chops w/Rice, Cabbage, Cheesy Mac and Corn Bread - Smothered Chops w/Rice, Cheesy Mac, Greens and Corn Bread, and a kids meal of Catfish & Fries . and it was delish ! I got what I paid for & more . They weren't stingy with the portions I actually couldn't finish and came back to my plate hours later . My son liked it aswell (more so the kool-aid) and this is my Husbands second time ordering, so that says enough . Hopefully next time I can get my Gumbo and pudding .

1559496,2017-03-05,15,zcpfOE1tBET_5YUjq8y11g,"Pretty solid soul food, saw the same kitchen staff as previous incarnation as Southern Style Eatery, not sure what the name change was about. Maybe management changed, because the food and service are a lot tighter now.

I order takeout here from work every so often, and it's usually ready within a few minutes of when they say. The smothered porkchop is a huge portion, but I didn't care for their gravy and that's what makes or breaks the dish for me. Guess it's a preference thing. I hear friends rave about their fried chicken, but I'm not a huge fan and haven't tried it here.

I tend to stick to their seafood selections, and they've been consistently fresh and well-seasoned. The shrimp and catfish poboys are good choices. Sides of mac, greens, and fries are pretty standard.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,20,4,JvZp1Npdau0aNB0iPlKP2w

The food is well seasoned. (Maybe a little too well. Could use a little less salt)
The service is wonderful. The employees are welcoming. 
Menu is short and straight to the point.
Reasonably priced! Especially for Soul Food.
The location is extremely convenient.

Well, I'm glad I went in! I ordered a Shrimp Po Boy which actually amazed me how tasty it was, shrimp was well seasoned and the order of frys were great had seasoning and were perfectly cooked. My only complain is the quantity of shrimp on my sandwich! Only 5 shirmp on a $9 sandwich! I hope they increase the portion!

4840136,2017-01-07,3,zcpfOE1tBET_5YUjq8y11g,"I drink the broth from the collard greens. I search for the cornmeal crumbs from the catfish. I will dip my finger into the tarter sauce without hesitation or shame. I get a pang of sadness when I realize my plate is empty, but I still smile and feel sense of satisfaction. There is just something so gratifying about eating a meal from this place. From the very first bite of whatever is on your plate, you will understand why I woke up this morning and felt compelled to write a review. 

I walked into Tastys, keeping my fingers crossed that I'd be able to place a take out order. The last few times I went to this location, that was not the case. It's been a few months, and I saw that it was under new management, so I was feeling hopeful. Sure enough, a pleasant young lady greeted my boyfriend and I with a warm smile and my order was placed. Previous visits resulted in me walking out and saying "" that lady was rude AF, but the food is good"" or ""do they ONLY cater parties these days?!"" The kitchen was almost ALWAYS closed when I tried to go last year. This time was different. This time, the energy was good, and the food was out of this world!

This is food that makes you want to hug the chef. If the catfish doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you may want to check your pulse. There's no way you could be alive. Juicy, zesty, perfect crunch, perfect flavor, perfect cut, prefect size. Just...perfect!",5xGO2SXrxv5_sYDrwXvh2g,5,1,5,ge-_Ev-VBDCkbEKBFTbwvQ
4894118,2016-10-05,0,zcpfOE1tBET_5YUjq8y11g,"Hey now!

This is a new crew and a new look for the former Southern Style Eatery.  The menu is essentially the same and I can confirm that the catfish is still outstanding! (Much, much better than the place nearby on Charleston.) After talking with a couple of the new folks to get the scoop, I feel good about the new direction for this place. Hey, who doesn't want great food in your neighborhood, right?

I placed my order for a catfish poboy just after they'd started a call in order for lots of fried chicken, so it took about fifteen minutes. That's fair. It gave me a chance to chat with them. They offered me a free drink while I waited and apologized several times for the wait. it wasn't a problem because I know how long it takes to cook fried chicken.

Both of the lovely ladies told me how important it was to them to take care of their customers and that they were looking into a loyalty program. That's a big difference from when we finally gave up on the former operation.

The PoBoy was fantastic. They're definitely back on our radar!",yExLpVbCfVqVixYwzMaeZw,6,2,4,K8Xb1ebB3n0W2Amj_N_q0Q
