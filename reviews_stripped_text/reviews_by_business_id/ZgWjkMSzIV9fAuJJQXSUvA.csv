74727,2012-01-31,0,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"I stopped by here for a quick lunch on a Sunday. When you walk in you will find the menu on the wall on the left side. I was greeted by a friendly server at the cash register. I went with the Chicken gyro platter & drink which was $14.40. The price seems expensive to me for what you get with the meal. I thought the chicken gyro was a little short on the chicken and had too much lettuce. I'm used to going to places where there is so much chicken in the gyro that it is constantly falling out while eating your meal. The taste of the gyro was very good but disappointing from the lack of chicken. The platter includes a side Greek salad and rice. I especially liked the added touch of small pieces of grape leaves mixed into the rice. The drink fountain has several choices of sodas and two different freshly made iced tea options.
The restaurant was very clean. There was a constant stream of friendly employees walking to by your table to make sure everything was okay.
I would recommend this place for a quick meal. I'll give it another shot in the future to see if there is other meals that offer better value.",xOjtlIjWS0djtoYhjBDgxA,0,1,3,s2pk0HOJJzRH0Nnz6Ib39Q

336665,2016-06-12,0,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"This restaurant has a fair amount of positive reviews, so I have to wonder if folks in Vegas haven't had an opportunity to experience high quality Greek food.  

We started off with the saganaki and the greek salad.  The saganaki portion was on the smallish side for the ten dollar price point.  It was a fairly standard saganaki - tasted fine.  The greek salad, however, was a huge disappointment.  The salad was terribly stingy on the feta cheese and the vinaigrette had a strange flavor.  It was homemade, but they overpowered it with dried herbs (thyme and basil) instead of using fresh herbs.  Perhaps we just had a poorly made batch, but the flavor was unpleasant.

Our entrees were a gyro and a meatball ""pizza"" made on a pita.  The pizza thing was a stupid choice - I had the lowest of expectations yet I was still disappointed.  It reminded me of something you would receive as the hot lunch selection in a grade school cafeteria.  It's inexplicable why this is on their menu.  

The gyro was mediocre at best.  The pita was soft, the cucumber sauce had nice flavor, but the meat was dry and unappetizing.  They also didn't slice the robust portion of gyro meat I'm accustomed to receiving at most Greek restaurants.    

To be honest, the best thing we ordered was the grilled chicken breast and french fries for our three year old.  The fries were hot and crisp and the chicken breast was moist and well cooked.  

The service was excellent.  Everyone was pleasant and attentive.  The ambiance in the restaurant was fairly typical for a Greek restaurant, however not as tacky as some.  Fair to say it has a nice atmosphere.  

As we were presented our check, we showed a ten dollar off coupon we had on our phone.  Our server told us they would not accept it because we hadn't printed it out.  Seriously?  They really need the paper print out?  It was the perfect capper to a very disappointing experience.",7jFoW90fQ4zR_3Dkz2W4nw,0,0,2,ivGnODpVVwDw0m9LD1YEfA

I ordered the filet skewer, which was about 12 dollars, and a drink, and the total came to about 15 bucks.  I also asked if I can have the yogurt sauce, thinking it would come with the food, as it's a Greek place and all.  I guess I was wrong, since they charged me fifty cents for it.  The food was delivered to my table fairly quickly, by a charming young man who definitely improves the experience here.  Anyhow, I took a bite of my potatoes and immediately, my face turned blue.  The flavoring was so off, and salty and sour, I was sure the potatoes were stuffed with sour patch kids.  So I shifted my attention to the beef that was on my plate, and it too was again, too salty and sour.  C'mon guys, lemons are pricey these days, quit squeezing five lemons on top of every plate!

They have 2 locations, one on Lake Mead and one in Centennial I believe, but the the Lake Mead location is more convienant for us. 
The place seems more family oriented, with a very friendly staff coming by to chat and make sure everything is perfect.
Upon arriving we were greeted immediately. For lunch you need to order at the register and it's seat yourself. I believe the first time I went was for lunch and I was seated immediately and handed a menu. A server came over and took our orders then. Anyways, besides the point. 
I ordered the traditional gyro platter with the dill yogurt sauce. The platter came with a Greek salad, pita bread, hummus and rice. More than enough for me! 
My boyfriend ordered the lamb kabob platter, which came with a Greek salad, pita bread, and rice.
The salads came out almost immediately. They were your typical Greek salads. A salad is a salad to me. 
I love a good gyro and I enjoyed this just as much as any other. They packed in a good amount of meat, which I pulled out maybe half and ate later with the rice & pita bread. The dill yogurt sauce was very subtle, not too sour or overpowering. 
My boyfriend enjoyed his lamb kabobs, found them to be very tender and a good amount of food for him. 
At the end of the meal our server came over to make sure everything was to our liking and boxed up my leftover and we were on our way.
Unfortunately, we left no room for dessert but the baklava with added ice cream and the tiramisu had caught our eye. I guess we will save that for next time.

The meat in the gyro seems like a very poor version of pressed lamb and beef. You are probably better of picking up frozen gyro meat from the local grocery store and making your own.

I'm used to gyros being served with tzatziki sauce, here it's served with a ""yogurt dill"" sauce which is a nice twist, it just doesn't make up for the poor quality of meat. 

My wife got the pomegranate chicken, and I have to admit, it seemed like it had been marinated and poached in POM juice. It was overly sweet without any depth or any presence of seasoning.   

Pros: Friendly staff, reasonable prices
Cons: Poor quality meat, not alot of flavor, hummus was just blah.

Each time I come here I try something new.  Which is about once a month.  I have had lamb, gyros, many varieties available, Greek iced coffee, which hits the spot.  For the lamb kabob that I got I thought it was very good however the portion for dinner and for the price I would think two kabob sticks would be more appropriate.  The staff is super friendly and helpful with making a choice for your meal.  So I see on this app for Market Grille something about %20 off your entire bill after you write something?

There is a lot of variation in Mediterranean cuisine, even if the general items are the same. I found this place to be as described (Greek), which is not always the case for Mediterranean restaurants.
I got their gyro. Very good. My girlfriend got the Spanankopita, which she loved. She tried their pumpkin soup, and loved that as well. 
Their hummus tends to the garlicky side, which I like. I was not too impressed with the flavor and texture of the pita wedges that come with the hummus. I prefer the bread to be in larger pieces and less grilled.

954981,2013-01-27,0,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"Market Grille Cafe is the reason I fell in love with Mediterranean/Greek food. The food is consistently delicious and truly represents a restaurant that serves its customers in the same way I imagine they would serve food to their family.  

Here is a list of some of my favorite eats at MGC:
Combination Appetizer Platter: Includes hummus, pita bread, mediterranean salad, dolmades, satziki, tabouli, and babaganoush. Can be ordered as appetizer to share and commonly ordered as a meal for individuals. It's hearty, diverse in flavor and texture, and just delicious. 

Dolmades: Stuffed grape leaves. I have yet to find any other Greek/Mediterranean joint that makes them as excellent as MGC does. Here you have a choice of vegetarian or with meat. Both are fantastic.

Falafels: This is yet another thing that MGC cooks extraordinarily well that has yet to be matched in quality by any other place. Crispy on the outside yet moist and bready on the inside - it's like a Greek hush puppy but better. An excellent meaty substitute for non-meat eaters. 

Also not to miss: Mousaka, Stuffed Tomatoes, Stuffed Green Peppers, all of their grilled skewers (my personal favorite is the salmon). 

Still making my way through their entire menu but unfortunately for me, MGC is clear across town. Nonetheless, we still make the trek when the craving for Greek food arises. We met one of the owners by chance during one visit, and pleaded with her and her husband to open another location in the South Las Vegas/Henderson area. In a town that offers every possible type of food and hosts a number of world-renowned culinary venues, Market Grille Cafe easily sits in the top 5 of my list of favorite Las Vegas restaurants.",FUEzQlJXJSpnXQNtrMcjww,0,0,5,9-EEWpDvUljCTJ6RT4nV2w

Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.  

I started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.  

The Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.  

I am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.  

I urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.

1162047,2011-01-25,0,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"I ended up eating at this place by chance.  It happened to be located in the same small plaza as a couple of my other favorite eateries: Panera and Chipotle.  I pulled into the parking lot with the intention of eating at Panera, but because of the small concentration of popular establishments, there was no parking available directly in front of Panera.  So I found myself parked in front of a place called the Market Grille Cafe, advertising Greek and Mediterranean food.  Mmmm, I thought, that sounds good.  And in I went.

It's a similar style eatery as Panera.  You order and pay at the counter, and then you take a number and find your own table and sit down to wait for someone to bring you the food.  I liked the fact that Greek music was playing over the speakers.  It provided an authentic feel.

If I had not been determined to stick to my vegetarian and fish diet, I would have ordered the herb roasted chicken and potatoes, because that sounds truly awesome, but instead I ordered a veg-a-nini ($6.95) and a small village greek salad ($5.95). The veg-a-nini was served and cut like a miniature pizza on pita bread.  The toppings included spinach-basil pesto, chopped kalamata olives, grilled red onions, and crumbled feta cheese.  It was light and flavorful.

The only difference between the regular greek salad and the village greek salad is that the village greek salad contains no romaine lettuce.  I have nothing against romaine lettuce (in fact, I love it), but authentic greek salads don't contain any lettuce, and I thought this would be a rare opportunity to enjoy an authentic greek salad.  Alas, while the ingredients were authentic, the cucumber and tomatoes were served diced rather than sliced and in wedges.  The feta was also crumbled rather than served in chunks or in a large slice atop the salad.  Unfortunately, the way the ingredients are prepared and served changes the experience of the flavors and taste of the dish.  It still tasted good, but not as delicious as an authentic presentation would have been.  If I had known that the tomatoes and cucumber would be diced, I would have ordered the regular greek salad with the romaine lettuce for the same price, although I fear the romaine lettuce might be served shredded.

Before I left, I ordered baklava to go.  A generous portion of this sweet nutty dessert is $4.75.  I enjoyed it.

Based on the overall menu and my expectations, I really wanted to give this place four stars.  Based on my experience, I can only give it three.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,1,1,3,ltMpjQM4IpeSAfdr2RoEFQ
1170754,2013-07-07,4,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"Here's the problem: the meal was tasty, the staff and service nice as well. But my wife and got got wicked sick from the food. My bathroom time for the next 3 days was as liquified as the hummus and looked just like the babaganoug. I hate to spend time and money on food that makes me unable to eat anything for days after!

I liked the cafe style setup. Why not? Order at the front, get your cup and wait for the food to be delivered. The staff was helpful, the ambiance kitchy but it is a greek place so I should have expected crappy murals of the Parthenon and fake grapevines.

We ordered the mezza platter and the traditional gyro. The platter came with hummus, baba, romaine salad, falafel and grape leaves (we ordered 2 hot with lamb and 1 gold veggie.) All in all the apps were ok. I make way better hummus at home. Their's was VERY loose. Too much water, overpowered by garlic as well. The babaganoug lacked any smokiness. I wonder if they grilled the eggplant? it almost tasted canned.
The rest was ok. Salad was sloppy, the grapeleaves good and the falafel nice and crispy. The toasted pita tasted fresh too.

The gyro was an inyourface suckerpunch of greek flavors. Very high in sodium, but went down well with a side of extra tzaziki. I like gyros but often get tired of too much going on in the meat. it was bordering on over seasoned/oversalted. Maybe it's just me.

The manager and staff came by to offer refills, check on the food, and clear the plates. They were all very nice.

Then the thunder struck. Both of us got hit hard at the same time in 2 separate locations. Poor Sarie was at WORK when she felt the bubble guts! I at least was at home and could sit on the pot for an hour. The next three days were very sketchy for me on my motorcycle. Lets just say there were more than a few unscheduled stops on my routes to look for a bathroom.

I'm gonna take a while before I try this place again. Maybe next time get everything cooked extra well done and stay away from the cold apps and fresh veggies/fruit.",Gu-rR-zYcWo3mPPkUHXUrA,5,3,1,1FUATC1JFeFxUpNFVxhAWg

The service was great! Friendly and professional. Our server explained what some of the dishes were and also gave us recommendations. We started out with pita bread slices and a flaming cheese appetizer. Excellent! For our entrees, my husband had the pomegranate chicken and I had the traditional gyro platter. Everything was delicious but I know exactly what I'm ordering next time: Pomegranate chicken salad. OMG! That has to be the BEST chicken I've EVER had!

We ended up getting desserts to go after we got through with our meals. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with baklava crust and my husband got the cannoli. The cost of our meal was pretty reasonable -- less than $50 (before tip). That included two soft drinks, an appetizer (happy hour price), two entrees (salads included), and two desserts.

I woke up today craving something healthy.

Spanakopota ... cheesy spinach flaky pastry
Pastitsio ... macaroni, beef and cheese pie
Mousaka ... beef, eggplant w/ cheese dish

This entree was served with Greek salad,
Basmati herb rice, hummus & pita bread.
This really satisfied my hunger.  It's good.

I ordered (4) Yia Yia's cookies for dessert,
butter cookies with powdered sugar. (yay)

Chicken was very dry, and the main reason I got the gyro over the wrap was the addition of Feta- of which there was so little it didn't really matter.
Fries were seasoned well, and paired with a spicy yogurt sauce. Fries were tastier without the sauce, but it wasn't bad.

Order was takeout, and staff present was just okay- walked in and wasn't addressed for a while, was helped by the manager who eventually asked if I was ready while other employees ignored me. I seemed to be interrupting their closing duties and conversation, my bad.

The spanakopita and avgolemeno soup sound tasty, but I'll likely try another location.

1451377,2015-08-17,7,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"This Mediterranean restaurant has great food. I especially love their homemade soups!

The downside:

There is no table service (i.e., no wait staff). You order and pay with the cashier, take a number, and wait for your food to be brought to you by a food runner. You also help yourself to the beverages at the beverage station. Some people may not mind that there isn't table service. For me, it just feels a little like I should be in a fast food restaurant.

The cost is not proportionate for the size of the food order. Quality is not an issue. The food tastes great. I had a small bowl of homemade Pumpkin Mushroom soup for $6.00. The soup was fantastic - all 5-6 spoonfuls of it! He had a small Pomegranate Chicken Spinach Salad for $10.50 that is served on a small 7"" plate. The salad was a very good, high priced appetizer. I had the Lamb Roast Cabernet, which was heavenly for $13.00. He had the Lamb Souvlaki, which is a grilled lamb skewer for $12.00. It does not come with enough lamb to be worthy of the price. Entree's come with a miniature greek salad, rice, hummus & pita bread.

Why?  Well, for starters it has a very nice, relaxed atmosphere.  The inside gives you a definite, casual mediterranean atmosphere.  Gentle, clear white lights, like large Christmas bulbs, are strung across the ceiling.  The decor definitely feeling like a sidewalk cafe in Greece or Italy.  They do have some outside cafe tables as well and overhead misting to keep you cool.

The staff is very friendly, attentive, and helpful.  You realize quickly that this is not only family owned and run, but that they treat you as family too!  They take the time to explain any menu items (since some terms may be Greek to you, LOL!) and also make suggestions based on what's popular, your dietary needs, and of course what their signature dishes are.

Although everything was unique, flavorful, and perfectly prepared, from the appetizers to the desserts, the most amazing, most unique, most original, most flavorful dish is their 

POMEGRANATE CHICKEN IS TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cannot overstate how incredible this dish is!  Its what has won them awards and its no wonder why.  Even if you're not sure you like pomegranate, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!!!!  Remember how you felt after you first, well, you know?  THAT'S what this is like from the first bite!  OOH! AAH! OMG! YES! YES! YES!!!  Seriously, its that new, that refreshing, that new, that unbelievable, leaving you a bit dazed and confused at first, but soon finding yourself desiring more, more, MORE!!!

Yes, I really do think their Pomegranate Chicken is THAT good!  I even told the artist/creator/chef son that he should go on TV against Bobby Flay.  Pomegranate Chicken would knock Bobby out for certain!

We also liked that the owners came out to chat with their guests, both about the food and as friends/family.  It was easy to forget we were customers.

I could go on and on (obviously, lol), but let me just say once again that this was our BEST DINING & FOOD experience in Las Vegas after 6 months here!  The quality of the food is impeccable, original FAMILY secret recipes, relaxed vacation atmosphere, yet a strong, warm feeling of family, community and togetherness thanks to the owners and staff.

The moment you walk into MGC, you enter a world that seems very similar to ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" or the Mad Greek Cafe in Baker. Lots of Greek decor, and no shortage of Greek music. A great place to be a Greek Geek.

Having said all that, this place is a fun spot to grab a nice, delicious dinner with your pals. You order from a counter, and food is brought to your table.

Lots of items for those with varied palates. Plenty of vegetarian items, white meat, red meat, seafood, etc. 

I recommend the appetizer combo (usually the kiss of death at most restaurants due to fried disgusting nothingness). Pita bread, hummus, tabouli, salad, falafel and dolmades (stuffed grape leaves). Share it with friends. Don't be that guy (or girl).

Service is good, bathrooms are clean. All these things are important. 

This place is worth a second, third or fourth visit. Maybe more.

Writing this is making me hungry for these dishes right now!

You can pick the perfectly cooked basmati rice or the lemon herb potatoes which are phenomenal. The Greek salads are always fresh and served with a tangy dressing. The soups here are also packed with flavor. I haven't had any that I didn't enjoy. From the avgolemono which is a traditional creamy lemon, chicken & rice soup to the pumpkin or creamy cauliflower ones! All very tasty!

Best gyro I ever had. My wife's pomegranate chicken was excellent.

The wait staff is well-trained and highly motivated.  

The young woman who served our table was beautiful with a highly cute personality.  You would attack Troy for her.  She was much better on the eyes than was Aphrodite's cheesecake.

The dinner salad not so good. The Sarma, aka dolmadas/stuffed grape leaves, really salty. The gyros - what kind of tasteless, funky meat is that? Cat?

2002525,2010-12-03,0,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"This establishment took the property in the Lake Mead Plaza that used to be Pei Wei.  They kept the skeleton of the previous restaurant and almost like waving a magic wand, made everything that was formerly Asian... the menu, decor, font... and made it Greek.  

Friendly staff.  Clean Bathrooms.  Good food.  Reasonable prices.  The owner is friendly and approachable.

The format: Head in, choose off the menu, order, get your number, grab your drink, display the number, and your food arrives shortly.  

Make sure you give them a heads up if you'd like your appetizer prior to your main entree as it sometimes arrives all at once.

When I visit, I usually drop in and have a Gyro around lunchtime... traditional, with hummus served on it.  Veggies are fresh, the meat slices are nice and hot.  For dinner I enjoy the Greek Trio Platter.  I enjoy the Greek dinner dishes with pasta and the like but sometimes it can be a lot of one flavor.  The Greek Trio platter is a sample of three of their main dishes with a bit of salad.  I also recommend the pomegranate chicken salad, my roommate's favorite on the menu.

The saganaki is pretty good, too.  It's not the best I've had, but it's not drowning in oil or greasy.  Love to eat it drenched on pitas.

The stuffed grape leaves and the pumpkin soup are also notable as delicious appetizers that I consistently enjoy.

I'm honestly not a huge fan of their hummus.  I think it could do with a pinch more flavoring and it's a little too smooth for me.  It works well as a complimentary taste on the pita but solo, not so much.

I recognize a few of the songs that they play in the background from My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  See if you notice which ones!  :)",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,1,1,4,V1vXMxWmMP4NWTMwO8D00w

It's a pretty popular lunch place from what I've seen and they offer a nice lunch menu. My friend and I go and usually split something off that and get the hummus appetizer to go with it. 

I came her for lunch on my birthday a couple months back and the owner happened to be there. She is awesome and so kind. She gave us discount cards for the first timers in the group to come again. She also gave me a slice of their Athena cheesecake. It is cheesecake with a baklava crust. It was good but not my favorite. I am very picky with cheesecake though because my own father makes a killer one from scratch. The baklava crust was lost on me and the others trying it. It just tasted like filo dough and was a bit tough. I'll take my cheesecake and baklava separate and possibly still at the same time. 

The hummus is good, great texture and comes in a few different flavors. You can get one or an order of three. We usually just go with the one because it's two of us, but it's plenty. The Greek salad is made with fresh ingredients and is solid, but nothing stands out. They have a pomegranate chicken that is pretty delicious and worth getting if you like that or want to try something new. 

The staff are always very friendly and efficient. They are clearing plates immediately and serving your food to the table as soon as it's ready. The kitchen is open so you can what's going on back there if you care to.

The Market Grill has a ton of good/safe options.  I come here regularly for lunch, and there are so many items that I can order and be content with.

I avoid the hummus here, but regularly take part in Gyros, Salads, Wraps, and Combo Plates.  I would give out 3 or 3.5 stars just on the food.  The service is always on though, they are accommodating here, and it is always clean...even during the lunch rush...so I settle at 4 stars.

It's been awhile since I've visited Market Grille. I was so excited today because I was on the west side (since moving to Henderson in 2010) and I could go to Market Grille. I've always enjoyed their food. However, they have apparently gotten too big for their britches. I received 1 skewer of dime sized chunks of lamb and 1 skewer of tomatoes and onions. For the $13.00 price tag I usually get at least double the meat at my favorite Greek spot in Henderson (Greek Bistro) and it tastes just as good if not better. The service there is better as well, as I see the owner and her children every time I go there and not some random ""doesn't care"" cashier. Market Grille, in my opinion, has fallen off from what they used to be. Give your customers what they pay for. Good food, good portions, and Great service.

After much consideration, my boyfriend and I chose the Gyros, which have: lettuce, chopped red onions, tomatoes, cucumber, feta stuffed into a warm pita bread and topped with the choice of yogurt dill sauce or hummus.

My boyfriend went with the Traditional (beef/lamb) beef gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.75 - The meat was more-so on the salty side, but the yogurt dill sauce helped cut the saltiness nicely. The size of this gyro was huge - there was more than enough food for him to become full and satisfied. 

I went with the Pomegranate chicken gyro (with yogurt dill sauce) $7.95 - The Pomegranate chicken had a pleasant, slight sweetness to it, but I could barely taste or make out any distinct ""pomegranate"" flavor. It was also charred black on some pieces, overcooked, tough and dry. This gyro was also a generous size - definitely big enough to stuff me silly. Although it was dry, I would most likely dabble in this gyro again.

For an additional $3.50, I turned my Gyro into a ""Gyro Platter"" which came with: 
- Greek salad - the zesty dressing was very vinegary and they barely gave any feta cheese. Also, the olives tasted great, but they only give you 3 tiny baby olives. 
- Basmati herb rice - the rice was very salty and the grains were extremely dried out. 
- Hummus & pita - the ratio of hummus to pita was un-proportional. The hummus wasn't bad, but they only gave us the tiniest container of it - it's not even substantial enough to comment on. The pita was cut up into 4 tiny points and tasted average. 

For a total of $11+ to turn the gyro into a platter, it wasn't worth it - the extras were not memorable. Just get the gyro, it's more than enough food to get filled up with. 

The yogurt dill sauce is what made the gyros enjoyable. It was refreshing and creamy. Whatever you do, get that sauce and drench the dry pomegranate chicken or the salty gyro meat in it - you will love it!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,3,3,YtnvS80me3THluQTogTKFA

I haven't had time to get it repaired, and between training, filling out paper works, and driving all over to get errands done, I was doing the Ace Ventura and driving with my head out the window to get some air!

I ended up going a full 24 hours without eating, being very dehydrated, overheated, and sore from training. Not a good idea in retrospect, but such is life. After finally getting a gallon of water in me, I decided to come here for lunch. I welcomed the cold A/C and was sat down right away. The waiter was quick and to the point, and I get my order in right away. 

For starters, I had the falafel, that came out with hummus. First thing I tasted was the hummus, and it wasn't good. It was more pasty than creamy, and a jar of sabra hummus was way better than this, which isn't a good sign. The falafel was also doughy on the inside, and had a weird taste to it. Not horrible, but not good.

Next was a greek salad. This was good. Fresh and seasoned just right away. Was a welcome relief from the starter.

For my main, I had the pomegranate chicken entree. This was good too. The chicken was tender and flavorful. Nothing out of this world, but a good dish for sure. The rice that came with it was also good. The pita and hummus where a miss here too, and I just left them.

Finally, I had the aphrodite cheesecake. The idea of a baklava cheesecake was very intriguing, as I love baklava. Unfortunately, this was not a good rendition. The cheesecake was just a standard, run of the mill cheesecake. The baklava crust left a lot to be desired.

Overall, this was okay. But considering that I was starving, my taste buds should have magnified the flavor significantly. Instead, I was very underwhelmed. I won't be coming back. I may have been spoiled by Cleo, which U know is not a fair comparison to a place like this, but this is just too far below to justify coming.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,0,0,3,978aD-0_BOR5jSv0yOPM-A

Saganaki: it's literally flamming cheese! They bring it out on an iron skillet and light in on fire table side. Awesome presentation and even more awesome flavors. You eat the cheese with toasted pita bread and it was so delicious!! It's a great appetizer. 

Pomegrante Chicken: I love it in the Gyros because I can eat it like a sandwich or over-sized taco. The chicken was very juicy and fresh. I couldn't taste the pomegrante flavor very much, but the dill dressing gave it a nice touch. 

Pumpkin Baklava Cheesecake: can I say AMAZING!?!? If you love cheesecake and if you love anything Pumpkin, this is the perfect dessert for you! The crust is a baklava crust, which basically means it's flakey like a pie crust instead of crumbly like a normal cheesecake crust. So good!

Pumpkin fans have to try the pumpkin mushroom soup. Perfect for the cold weather, the smooth, creamy soup has a pronounced pumpkin flavor in this vegetable-based soup. The Greek salad that accompanied my entree was perfect for sharing. The chicken skewer entree comes with one skewer full of moist, well seasoned cubes of chicken and a veggie skewer with red and green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The Greek trio entree was perfect for sampling the spanakopita, moussaka, and pastitsio. The spanakopita was excellent with its flaky layers of pastry covering gooey cheese and spinach.

After the gym one of my friends said this place was really good so we decided to eat here. 

You order your food and then you sit down and they'll bring your food to you. I decided on the lunch special (around $8). There's a list of food you can choose from for the lunch special. I got a chicken gyro with avgolemono soup. It doesn't come with a drink so you have to order that separately. 

Chicken gyro- chicken was kind of dry. The yogurt sauce that go with the gyro is usually my favorite part. But their yogurt sauce was a bit on the sour side so it wasn't the taste I was used to. The portion is pretty big though. 

Avgolemono soup- it's a creamy lemon soup with chicken and rice. Oh I did not like that at all! It was way too sour for me.

I go to this area often but for some reason I always thought this place was a grocey store but my boyfriend's brother suggested to go during the break between soccer games and let me know it was actually a Greek food place.
Their menu consists of gyros, salads, entrees with rice, kabobs, appetizers and desserts. Their baklava looked really fresh and thick so I'll probably try that next time. You order at the counter and then you choose a table and they bring it to you.
I ordered the pomegranate chicken with basmati rice lunch special for $7.50 and my boyfriend ordered the traditional (lamb & beef) gyro with fries lunch special for also $7.50. Even with the lunch special, they let us use the 20% off your entire bill from checking in! Great deal!
Both were really flavorful! The pomegranate chicken tasted as if they marinated the chicken in sweet fruity horchata lmao and I don't mean that in a bad way lol it was also moist. Basmati was also good.
The traditional gyro was moist and flavorful and I liked that the meat was sliced a little thinner but they still gave a lot of meat. The sauce was good and tangy as well. Fries were fresh and came with a good sauce.
The workers were friendly, food was quick and atmosphere was fresh and clean with nice decor. I'll definitely be back!",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,5,4,4,RyHW1vLx0C95M2-QldToZg
2988411,2018-01-24,3,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED OR BELITTLED. 
This was my first and last time coming here. I was so upset that I had to take a week before writing this review, so that I could be calm and honest about my experience.
I came here with Ben S. on the evening of January 17th 2018 at around 7pm. As we walked in we were greeted by the hostess which took us to our table. Our waitress came and offered us drinks, I ordered a hot tea because I was sick and Ben a soda. She asked if we were ready to order, we were not since it was our first time and she didn't seem happy that we were still looking over the menu. It's ok, I didn't mind, we all have bad days, I still smiled and asked for her to come back. Soon a booth over to our right freed up and we asked the hostess if we could move to the booth because I was sick and the cold air from outside was hitting me. A booth would have provided a block from the cold and she was so kind in saying we could move. She helped me move my utensils and my tea over to the booth and we sat down again. Ben and I started talking and within what felt like 10 seconds a woman came charging at us and yelling from half way across the restaurant. ""You guys can't sit here, we were cleaning this table up for someone else!"" I wish I was exaggerating when I say that she came over yelling from half way across the restaurant. I wish I was making it up that she was making us get up and move our stuff to the first table we were at. I wish I could tell you that the tables around us weren't all staring at us as we were forced to walk back to our table. We didn't say anything, maybe because we were in shock as to how we were being treated, we quietly went back to our table and we sat down again. The hostess came over and deeply apologized because she didn't know they were cleaning the table for someone else, someone who had just walked in. Ben looked at her and told her ""Weren't we here first?"" she agreed but it was out of her hands and clearly she was intimidated by the woman who had come over and yelled at us. Soon our waitress came back to take our order, Ben asked her for the woman's name who had yelled at us and we were told it was Shelly. I don't know if it was her real name or not but she was an older caucasian woman with blonde hair who was over by the bar most of the time. Ben then proceeded to ask for the check for our drinks instead of placing a food order. Our waitress said ok without hesitating and came back with the bill. We paid for our drinks and left, on our way out catching a glance at a couple that were nodding their heads in disbelief. What they didn't know was that just two days prior we had experienced a loss in our family and this was the first time we had left the house. It took everything in me not to cry as I got up and left from the utter humiliation and disbelief. So many things went wrong here and nothing was done about it. No one on staff cared that we left except maybe the hostess who was very kind the entire visit. NEVER, EVER is it acceptable to treat a paying customer or any human being for that matter in this way. We were humiliated, sad, angry, and every other feeling you can feel when you are belittled in front of dozens of people. I understand when sometimes a restaurant needs to move people, it's happened to me before but they handled it much differently. By first coming over quietly, then asking if it is ok that we move, then offering something for the trouble. I don't even care they they offer a free dessert or not, it they just ask nicely I will gladly move, but that's just an example of what other places have done.

3023635,2016-06-16,1,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"Really cute restaurant with great customer service and amazing food! 

Came here with 3 friends during lunch time and the place was pretty busy. There's a large menu on the wall when you walk in and once you decide what you want, you can order at the cash register. They have AMAZING lunch specials for only $8.50... gyro, Mediterranean wraps, chicken & veggie kabob with a drink and your choice of sides: rice, fries, greek salad... If you check in on yelp you'll get 20% off which will bring your total to around $7.50 after tax. 

The food comes out very quickly. I ordered the traditional gyro (beef and lamb) with the yogurt dill sauce & a greek salad. The pita bread that they use to wrap everything in was so soft. I've been to other places where the pita bread was very chewy and hard. They do give A LOT of meat and I had a hard time eating the gyro so I eventually dumped everything out on top of my salad. All the ingredients were super fresh and the dressing for the greek salad wasn't overwhelming. 

My friend got the Mediterranean wrap with a spinach tortilla and pomegranate chicken. She got it with fries that came with a really good dipping sauce. The fries were crispy but not burnt and perfectly seasoned. 

We also shared cannolis. I've only had cannolis twice before and didn't really like them. The cannoli here had a creamy cinnamon filling and a crunchy shell. I couldn't get enough of the filling!

The food... Well it was really just okay. Nothing over the top fabulous, but not terrible. I would highly recommend the lentil soup. It was hearty and delicious...Full of flavor! Please note to all my fellow vegans: THE HUMMUS IS NOT VEGAN. It contains Greek yogurt. Huge disappointment for me. I ordered the veggie skewer meal. It came with a small salad, rice, two small skewers, and about 3table spoons of tabbouleh. They were very accommodating and made sure everything that came out was prepared vegan. The skewers were cooked well and seasoned properly. However, they were mainly just red yellow and green peppers and two mushrooms on each skewer...Lacking vegetables and variety... 
The rice was okay, large portion. I left full with left overs, but not satisfied. 

The service was okay as well. She was pretty knowledgable about the food items which was a perk for me and my dietary needs. She did forget an entire meal for our table, but none of us really said anything since it didn't make the bill. The appetizer was enough for our friend. 

We ordered a bottle of the pomegranate wine. It was sweet and delicious. We finished it easily between the four of us. My boyfriend said his food was okay and my friends didn't take their left overs home... So I'm not sure if that meant it was bad or not. However, they do have a good happy hour I would check out, and for a fast quick semi healthy bite, it really wasn't all that bad.

My daughter ordered the Greek Trio, ""a selection of (their) most popular spanakopita, mousaka, and pastitsio""; and my wife ordered Lamb Souvlaki, skewered cubes of lamb meat with rice.

Their traditional gyro is very interesting.  Their sauce is made with dill, not cucumber.  That's good, because I HATE cucumber.  But I love gyros so much, I will tolerate it in the gyro sauce.  Don't have to worry about that here.  Only problem with their gyro is that the meat is always very dry.  The only thing I can figure is that not enough people order the gyro, so the meat dries out on the rotisserie, maybe?  But hey, slather enough sauce on it, and everything's OK.  :)

My sweetie ordered a small gyro salad and I ordered a traditional gyro.

Not true, and I can be brutally honest when needs be.  I just so happen to be frequenting some really delish joints as of late.  Love the ambiance of Market Grille Cafe.  Not too hoity-toity, yet not ultra casual either.  The woman taking my order was engaging and I asked her why the business had not ventured to the other side of town.  She reassured me that there was something in the works (hold tight East-siders!).  I ordered the Lunch Special Traditional Gyro which comes with a bottle of water or fountain drink for $7.50.  I never thought I would experience a gyro which was comparable to the gyros in my college town.  Call it college town elitism, but their gyros were seriously sensational.  I think those gyros have finally met their match.  The lamb meat mixture at Market Grille wasn't overly salty which I have found to be the case at Gyro Time.  The tzatziki sauce, oh the tzatziki sauce (they don't actually refer to their sauce as tzatziki but rather yogurt dill), was perfectly seasoned, just the right amount of dill as to not overpower the flavor of the lamb.  The gyro featured vegetables such as onions, cucumber, and lettuce.  They don't skimp on the meat and one gyro is enough for lunch.  I appreciated the less than 10 minute wait for my food considering how ravenous I was.  Can't wait for them to open a restaurant closer to home.  Thanks for a great meal!

I ended up getting veggie skewers in a meal served over rice and with a Greek salad, hummus, and cucumber slices. The veggies were really great, actually, but the portions were pretty small for the price.

The temperature in here is always either too hot or abnormally cold. Last time was the latter. Caught a funky smell near the drink machines one day too, which kinda threw me.

The good part is the food. Slightly above average mediterranean with decent bang for the buck. Nice daily specials, too. I'm a fan of the chicken kotanini and pumpkin cheesecake, but opted for the chicken skewer this time. Very filling with the salad, veggies, rice, hummus, and pita.

I wandered into this restaurant after seeing their sign on my way to chipotle. I figured I eat at chipotle enough, so maybe I should try something new.

For 7.50 you can get your choice of traditional or chicken gyro, pomegranate chicken salad, or falafel appetizer with a soda. I sprung for the traditional gyro and soda.

It was pretty good. The meat was yummy, but wasn't browned at all. It was as if they sliced it right off the spit and put it on my pita. Still good though. I loved their hummus  and their pitas were very tasty and fresh as well.

Small plain hummus served with pita
Small babaganoush with pita
Side falafel
Side gyro meat with pita bread
Greek trio à la carte

The hummus was good but was surpassed by the babaganoush.  I liked the thickness of the babaganoush.  I thought the pita was mediocre.

The side of gyro meat was my other favorite of the night--not counting dessert.  There was a $.50 charge for the pita that we ordered with the meat.  The  meat was tender and flavored nicely.  The Greek trio was good with the mousaka being the stand out.

Both desserts were very good.  I liked that the baklava was not drenched in honey and nuts as many places do and the rice pudding was quite good.  Prices were good for the meal.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,13,3,JyMrAtrkEYa0_i2sIIIcCA

Market Grille Cafe is located in a plaza on Rockspring Rd. and can easily be found with their humongous signage. Dine-in, take-out and catering available. 

I ordered based on my friendly server's suggestion and got their Traditional Gyro (beef and lamb). Also picked up a soup since my starving friend is a huge soup connoisseur.  

Their traditional gyro comes in 7-inch pita bread and is packed with loads of beef and lamb. They offer a choice of hummus or yogurt dill sauce but my server was kind enough to include both sauce on the side. Gyro itself is a big portion but this can also be made in a combo platter which comes with Greek salad, basmati rice, pita bread and hummus for additional charge of $4. Meaty, filling, and packed with flavor. Highly recommend. 

The soup I picked up is called Avgolemono and is also known as lemon, chicken and rice soup. This soup is similar to porridge and it is very lemon sour. You can get this in small ($4) or large ($6). 

Easily my top favorite place for gyro. Must try for any Mediterranean food lovers. And if you do decide to stop by, make sure to check-in on yelp for 20% off your order.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,6,6,4,TDrn4mCkaLWwT-Pjzw3erw

Pumpkin Mushroom Soup, 
Lemon Rice Soup and a 
Moussaka platter-TO GO

Lots of flavor.  The Pumpkin Mushroom soup was  almost the consistency of baby food so not sure if it's suppose to be like this but nonetheless all the flavors of fall.

Lemon Rice Soup one of my favorites-you can order it in a 8oz size (cup) or a larger size.  Small size is only $3.50 and packed with a lemony tangy punch. Perfect for my little one battling a cold.

Moussaka Platter came with a Greek side salad and dressing, warm pita triangles and fabulous hummus which was very tasty, basmati flavorful rice and a ""slice"" of Mousakka which is potato, ground beef and eggplant.  Almost like a cross between a Shephards pie a lasagna.  It was very good.  Just had a corner piece so it was a little crunchy, would have liked a moister center piece instead.

I have been to the Market Grille before (at the location up North) so this was my first time here.  Parking reserved for take-out orders so that was nice.  Friendly service.

Hummus, Greek salad and lemon soup were the standouts!

But between the two locations they both have in common are the menus and some employees!  I was surprised to see the same person work at both locations on different days.  But kinda cool because they remembered what I ordered the previous day.  

I always get the first soup they have on the menu, I can't remember the name of it but it's the one with the rice in it!  I've tried numerous entree's too but always end up with the pomegranate chicken as the most flavorful.  The baklahva tastes the way it should, so much sugar and butter.  And I always love the hummus!  

This place is clean, the hostesses are nice and hardworking.  When you walk in you'll be surprised at their giant menu and visual menu on the tv screens!  But you can always go up to the cashiers and ask what they recommend!",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,0,0,4,jEvKS6qwIYKBnY0vLYxG0Q
4014328,2015-07-23,1,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"Ended up for lunch at Market Grille Café one day to get my Greek on.  It's OK!

Ordered off the 'Build Your Own' lunch menu for $7.50.  Comes with your choice of a main:

-Gyro (traditional beef & lamb, chicken, or veggie)
-Pomegranate Chicken
-Mediterranean Wrap (chicken, gyro, falafel, or veggie)

And choice of a side:
-Fries (Greek seasoned)
-Basmati Rice
-Salad (spinach or Greek)

I ordered the traditional Gyro and a side of fries.  Didn't take long for our order to come to our table, maybe about 10 minutes.  I admit, it looked pretty darn good.  Serving size was alright.  I could have used a few more fries on my plate, those things were yummy!  Fresh, hot, and covered in Greek seasoning (which I think has some paprika) & fresh herbs.  The Gyro was good as well, lots of meat (little aftertaste of laaaaammmmmbbbbb), fresh tomatoes, a nice tangy tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, chopped parsley, and a load of red onions!  Like, lots of them!  Luckily, I like onions.  Others may have been a bit put off by them.  But what's Greek food without red onions?  Less stinky LOL.

My big gripe about this lunch menu?  Why doesn't this combo come with a damn drink??  For that much moolah you should get at least a small soda!  What am I gonna drink with all those onions?  I did ask for a water cup, which I was happily obliged.  But still, did it drown out my lovely onion breath?  Hell no!  Eh, and I resort to an Altoid.

Overall the Gyro was pretty tasty.  The lamb/beef meat combo was flavorful and not dry, but that freshness from the tzatziki sauce and parsley took it home.  The pita was supple and airy, but with enough heft to hold up all the ingredients.  I managed to finish my lunch up nicely.

I'd be back to Market Grill Café more if the price for a Gyro was a bit more reasonable.  I like Greek and Mediterranean food, but me being a cheapy eater leaves me with no qualms going to Chipotle a few doors down for a lower priced fatty burrito (believe me, I often break tortillas with fillings), or In N Out right across the street.

4049746,2013-02-18,2,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"I don't quiet understand all the good reviews for this place. If I could divide this review into two different categories of service and food, I would. I would give 4 stars to service. I went there for the first time and didn't know the menu. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helped me pick something out of the menu. They had a lunch special but somehow we ended up paying way too much for just lunch. And that brings us to the second category: Food. 

I'm not sure if this place is listed as Greek/ Mediterranean food; but if you have ever had authentic Mediterranean food, you would know that the tzatziki is a Greek yogurt sauce with tons of garlic. They call theirs ""dill sauce"" and it was yogurt with dill, no spices, no garlic, no flavor. Hubby and  I ordered the gyros, which was also too dry and without any flavor. Last but not least, the desert... We ordered a baklava. 

First of all, the piece they sell you is huge and they charge about $5. There is no way anyone would be able to finish that piece by themselves and if they could, well, then they should reconsider their dietary choices. Second of all, if you have ever had baklava before then you would know that it shouldn't taste like you are licking cinnamon's butt hole. Excuse my language but there was so much cinnamon and sugar in that piece of baklava that hubby and I both almost chocked on our first and the only bite. 

My recommendation: This place needs a serious revision of the menu. They should either stick with the Greek/ Mediterranean theme and learn how to make those dishes, or change their menu completely. Also, if you are looking for a more authentic taste of the Mediterranean cuisine, you might want to try Stephanos' or Baladie Cafe (my favorite).",akEFRm7rqlxIANKyTlaTOg,5,2,2,nx2k-eMJNZX7iH1oyL3_dA

The cafe itself is so cutely decorated and homey feeling. The menu is quite diverse and seems to have everything I have ever heard of in Greek food. I had a traditional gyro and was quite pleased. You can ask for the yogurt and hummus on the side, so you can try both options. Both are yummy and I don't think I could decide which was better, so the option to get both is great!  My daughter got the cheesy pita and ate almost the whole thing. This is a big deal because she usually eats one bite and is done. So I think that is another point for this place. 

I also felt very welcomed here as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. The manager stopped by my table several times to check on us, as well as chat a bit.

Shame on me. But I did make it in the other day when a group of us from the office made the drive up the 95 for lunch. I must say I was impressed. The restaurant is small like a cafe as the name would suggest. But it is decorated well. It feels almost like somebody's backyard garden. The Greek music playing adds to the atmosphere.

For my lunch I ordered a traditional gyro with a Greek salad. The gyro was stuffed full of meat, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and onion all topped with a yogurt dill sauce. It was delicious and filling. All the stuff that fell out mixed well with the salad which had much of the same stuff. But it also had fetta cheese and olives. I can't not love that. It was a good solid meal. And the price was fair given the portions. No complaints in that department. I can't really complain about much of anything honestly. Sevice was good too. Friendly and quick the way it should be. It bothers me to pay for a bottle of water when most places have free water cups but whatever. I'm not going to hate on them over that.

4211691,2014-05-16,1,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"There was a time when I really liked this place, at least this location anyway. But that changed after my last visit. Word to the wise: it doesn't pay to be a Frequent Diner Card holder, at least where the lunch specials are concerned.

I ordered off the lunch specials menu as I have done in the past and when the total came, I remembered that I had my Frequent Diner Card. I pulled it out and noticed I had all 10 punches, so yay me, free lunch, well give or take $1 and some change for the remaining balance. So the cashier called her manager over to get it squared away. The manager came over and after a few seconds of examination, she notified me that I couldn't use the $10 off card because I was ordering off the lunch specials menu which she mumbled something about it being already ""discounted"" and that I needed to use it on an entree instead. I think I gave her a death look and instead of immediately questioning the ridiculousness that she just stated which was NOWHERE WRITTEN ON THE LUNCH SPECIALS MENU NOR IN THE FINE PRINT OF MY FREQUENT DINER CARD, I grabbed my useless card from the manager and paid for my meal. I'm not a complete douchebag after all. It was lunch time, the lines were long, I was hungry, I'm sure the people behind me were hungry so there.  

Yet, the more I thought about it, the more irritated I became. I re-read the card just to make sure I didn't miss something. About the only thing I think that would apply is the ""Management reserves all rights"" part. Perhaps her reservation with me being able to use that card, even toward the ""discounted"" lunch specials is that I wasn't paying for more than one lunch special. Then I got to thinking, the last time I came into this place, I ordered off the lunch specials menu and got the10th punch on my card. The card clearly states that you get one puch for every $10 purchase and even after ordering those ""discounted"" lunch specials, with a drink and tax, it comes out to a little over $10. So what's their policy again about using the card toward the lunch specials? Oh right. They don't really have one, do they??

I wanted to say something to the manager who denied me the $10 off but she was nowhere to be found after I was done with my meal and I had to get back to work. I decided to visit the website which is a wealth of information if one is looking to book them for their next event. Unfortunately, there is no comments section, just a card to fill out for catering purposes. But interestingly enough, I found the lunch specials are listed on the website at $7.50 and they are supposed to include a beverage. Why is it at this location (Lake Mead), the $7.50 does not include a beverage? I have always been charged for a drink. So basically, my ""discounted"" lunch special of $7.50 plus $2.25 for a drink plus tax came out to $11.08 for my lunch. Had I been able to use my $10 off card, I would've paid my remaining balance and left the cashier a nice fat tip which would've elicited a bell ringing followed by a hearty ""OPA!"" from the kitchen, as I've always done whenever I have visited. But that was not to be and at this point, it's doubtful I will ever return, at least to this location. 

I must add, the quality of their food has also gone downhill. When I first started coming here, I really liked the Greek salad. But I noticed during my last couple of visits, the salad is completely bland with very few vegetables, olives, feta and the lettuce is always wilted as if it's a week old.  They're overcharging ""discounted"" specials that are supposed to include drinks, not honoring the frequent diner card and their food is mediocre fast food at best. That's a damn shame.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,1,0,2,X0cbAKlpLIa5-E-70V1n8A

Started with the appetizer sampler plate.  Falafel, greek salad, baba ganoush, hummus, and dolmades. The stuffed grape leaves were good.  The inside had so much flavor. The hummus was kinda runny and wasn't that great.  The salad is a salad, not much to say there.  The falafel and the baba ganoush were fantastic.  The falafel was so good.  Not dry whatsoever.  The baba ganoush had a lot of flavor as well.  Great eggplant flavor. 

My wife ordered the lamb souvlaki entree. It came with rice and a vegetable skewer.  The rice was okay. The vegetable skewer had a great char on it and a great marinade.  The lamb was excellent.  So flavorful and had a nice lamb taste.  I ordered the entree sampler with spanakopita, moussaka, and a macaroni pie.  The pie was forgettable, but still had some flavor.  The moussaka was very cheesy and the eggplant and tomato sauce was fantastic.  The spanakopita was the best part of the meal.

Try telling your mom to modify her family recipe to match a store brand. Psh!

As soon as we sat down our server asked if we wanted any drinks and at the time we just ordered waters. After she left we realized they had a special that night for $2 off beers. So of course we were going to take advantage of that! We ordered to blue moons and they were on tap so they tasted sooo good.
Everything on the menu sounded so good, but in the end I decided to get a lamb gyro platter, my boyfriend decided on the pasta angelo and we got platos potatoes to share. 
The platos potatoes were really good, they're basic fries but the seasoning that was on them made them stand out. We couldn't stop eating them! 
The lamb gyro platter was huge. It comes with the gyro, side of rice, side of pita bread and a side salad. They served the salad way ahead of the rest of the platter which was nice, it gave me time to eat it before the rest of my food came. The lamb gyro was AMAZING. The lamb was so tender and juicy, had a good amount of lettuce, tomato and sauce. It was exactly what I wanted! The rice was really good too. Nicely seasoned. The pita bread they gave me was plain jane but they gave me hummus to go with it so that was really nice too. 
The pasta angelo plate seemed like it didn't come with a lot, but my boyfriend couldn't finish the dish it was so filling! He was pleasantly surprised. He loved the flavors, the pasta had spinach, mushrooms, tarragon and a nice buttery sauce. 
All in all, this place is really good. It's a perfect place for a little date night, or if you're just really craving greek food. The service is nice, the food is great and filling. The portions here are huge so you definitely get what you pay for! I will be coming here more often for sure.",wD5cNaaNSyVorLtn0Dx_GA,0,1,5,Cul6g14nQFXVA0JevwsESw
4484446,2016-04-11,7,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"If I had wanted fast food, I'd have gone to my local burger takeout joint.  But I didn't; I wanted to enjoy a leisurely dinner with my +1, having just returned home after a solo month on the east coast.

I hadn't been to Market Grille since shortly after they'd opened.  My husband had gone one time after with a friend and wasn't crazy about it, but we were both up for Greek food, so he agreed.  We were seated quickly; I ordered my customary Riesling (very stingy pour for $8.50) and hubby had a glass of Sangria, full of tasteless fruit and missing the kick of additional spirits.  We chose Pomegranate Chicken for me, and Moussaka for him.  He also ordered a bowl of Avgolemono soup.  

Salads, which came with the meal, were delivered right away, with small cups of dressing on the side.  The two cups looked like Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Twins.""  One was a clear golden color, i.e. straight oil.  The other, dark and full of seasonings.  Strike one.  But they changed the pale twin.  It didn't help much - still bland.

Not 20 seconds after the salads hit the table, the soup was delivered.  And right behind that, without missing a beat, came the entrees.  Needless to say, we protested.  And the dishes returned from whence they came, probably to sit under a heat lamp.

The small salad was okay, but quite ordinary, except for the addition of a tiny bit of feta.  The soup had shredded chicken that seemed dry.  Avgolemono should be served with bread, and at every Greek restaurant I've ever eaten in a basket of pita is served at the beginning.  Not here.  The only pita in sight came as three tiny triangles on the entree plate which, if the serving pace had been correct, would have come AFTER the soup was finished.  Chintzy, for sure.

My Pomegranate Chicken looked pretty sitting on that white plate.  It was tender, but strangely tender, since it was also somewhat dry.  A big mound of rice and small cup of okay hummus came with it, along with those three pita bites.  They didn't bother to reheat the rice before re-serving my dish.  Growing up in New York and living in New Jersey, I'm no stranger to Greek, having cut my eyeteeth on Greek diners.  I've had moussaka in Astoria, Queens and in Greece.  And I've never seen a portion as tiny as the one served at Market Grille:  a single half-height layer, and half the width of any portion of moussaka in the free world.  Did hubby mistakenly order a kid's meal?

To make up for the woeful experience, the manager ""graciously"" offered to comp the soup and take 20% off the bill.  But really, it was just the soup that would be adjusted, since anyone checking in on Yelp can get that 20% discount.

Next time I need my Greek/Mediterranean fix, I'll go back to my beloved Crazy Pita, where I can get fresh veggies along with couscous, salad, hummus, and lot more pita for less cash.  And a staff that truly values my business.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,9,4,2,alK2SBPLY1_iX2cje4BI8w

My friend really enjoyed the pumpkin-mushroom soup. My favorite is the spanakopita. If you get the entree size it is a lot of food because it comes with some greek salad, basmati herb rice, hummus and pita bread for about $11. The pomegranate chicken is really good, whether you get it alone, in a salad, or in a wrap. The traditional gyro is also really good, and very large. You can get it with yogurt dill sauce (which I recommend) or hummus. The salmon wrap is excellent, and you can choose a spinach or tomato basil wrap (both great). They sell greek beer and wine, but their soda selection isn't that fantastic. I really wish they would get coke zero (they have diet coke). The desserts are gigantic, and the yia yia's cookies are enough to take back to your office or home to share. The pumpkin baklava cheesecake is to die for! Enough for 2. The service is great, you stand in line to order and it's usually short, and then they bring you your food. The staff is very friendly. If you go on their website there is a coupon for 2 glasses of house wine with a $25 purchase!

Was eating alone so I decided to order to go and just chill at home to try out the food. Now I know most people are going to tell me this effects my dinning experience but whatever.. we are talking about the food here.

Ordered a Falafel wrap with a side Greek salad. I got it with the Tomato Basil wrap and their yogurt dill sauce. When I got home and started chowing down I was highly disappointed. The salad came with Balsamic dressing, yuck. The lettuce seemed grainy like it wasn't washed, and there was barley any feta cheese. The falafel was ok.

Now after all this and being mad that I didn't go somewhere else I still want to go back and try the Combination Platter, and maybe something else. It's a strange reaction but my stomach needs to find a a near by Greek place that reminds of the places back in New York.

The prices are also pretty ballsy considering its a step up from a fast food joint. I felt really ripped off by the end of the meal.

No pita with the soup, salad and appetizer. (Why?) We had a lovely feta cheese appetizer that we just stared at until our meals showed up. When the pita finally made an appearance at the table, it was four tiny wedges on the plate with the entree. 

The avgolemono soup was pretty good; lots of chicken, not a lot of rice. The salad that comes with the entrees is also fine, just a little heavy on the dressing. Unfortunately, the starters were the highlights of the meal. 

 I actually had to spit out my one bite of spanakopita, it was THAT GROSS. It tasted as though it had been made days ago and had surprise inner layers of mushy phyllo. Stale and inedible; I'd have sent it back if my husband hadn't eaten it (I don't think he liked it either, but he's a 'clean your plate' type). 

The hummus and tzatziki were disappointing. Both had an off taste and didn't seem fresh. The filet skewers were pretty rare, rarer than I would have liked if they'd bothered to ask. The rareness wouldn't have fazed me if the meat had been fresh and of good quality, but, like much of what we ordered, it seemed as though it had been sitting around a few days. They're also selling what amounts to a lunch portion at other places at a dinner price. If you're going to overcharge for three bites of meat, it'd better be delicious, you know? I skipped dessert; they'd gotten enough of our money already. 

I may or may not come back here. I'm willing to believe they were having an off night and try ordering something else (never again for the spanakopita though, I'm nauseated just thinking about it), maybe a lunch special.

The pomegranate chicken was a 10! The Saganaki was a 10! The lemon chicken and rice soup was a 10! The salad was a 10! The pumpkin cheesecake was a 10! The homey elegant Greek ambiance was a 10! Heck, even the ice water was a 10! *(filtered unlike some other places.) We will definitely be back and I am still feeling good vibes from this place even though I'm stuffed.

Pomegranate chicken plate is the usual. I rarely get chicken breast anything because it's usually so dry and blah at places. It's juicy and lightly done up with a slightly sweet sauce. 

I'm surprised this location doesnt get as good reviews as Centennial on the food consistency. So far, we havent had anything off yet, but we normally don't go to this one.  We like how this one has booths which are more comfy than the small setup in the Centennial location. 

Is it the most authentic food around? Well, no....it's kinda light on the spices that generally I come to expect  distinctively present in Mediterranean fare. It's good food- just not what I come to associate when I want Greek home cooking but what I associate with light and fresh choices if that makes sense.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,5,4,ISVxhWMu_-Up-e6zI3iXfw

Customer service was great. The establishment is super clean and you can even watch them make your food if you'd like. They had gluten free, dairy free, nut and egg free options available. Good thing, because T Money was with us. Husband got a gyro of course, with a house salad. Looked great with a lot of meat. He ate it all. T and I ordered the chicken skewer. I ordered with a side salad and he got his usual fries. The chicks skewers were fantastic. And our food was brought out very quickly, which is always appreciated when you have a youngin' with you. 

I took off a star (and a half) because the allergy friendly options are really, really limited. The different hummus options sounded great, but they all had dairy in them.

5198952,2010-08-27,6,ZgWjkMSzIV9fAuJJQXSUvA,"Market Grill is like an Outkast song: so fresh and so clean. However, don't expect them to actually be bumpin' Big Boi and Dre on their subs. First, I don't think they have subs, and second, their speakers are reserved for Greek tunes. The opa tunes add to a festive, comfortable, complete atmosphere. By complete, I mean that every little detail here is oozing Greekness. From the moment you walk in, you know that the owner takes their business seriously. I like it.

Before placing your order at the counter, you can peruse the giant menus. On these super-sized menus I discovered one of my all time favorite things to order at a Mediterranean restaurant: a combination platter! Yes, I know: very authentic. It is prefect for indecisive me, as I don't know whether I want hummus, falafel, tabouleh, baba ganoush, dolmades, or a Greek salad. Well, I do know, that I don't want dolmades, but the nice lady let me get more falafel instead. At $10 and change, it was less expensive than the other place in town where I had seen a similar offering, so I decided to go for it!

Everything was fresh, and I really enjoyed the baba ganoush and hearty lentil soup (not part of combo platter, but part of husband's order). The pita was warm and soft. The other items were good, but not amazing. The falafel were a bit salty, but tasty. However, they were odd. They seemed almost as if they had been baked, not fried, and they were a little small. I enjoyed the flavor, but not necessarily the texture.

Little bonus items include filtered water, clearly marked Gluten-free and vegetarian options, and a frequent diner card. Get punches for each $10 you spend, and after 10 punches, get $10 off. 

All in all I think the complete package is a keeper. I might not rush back for falafel, but it is the kind of place I would be happy to take my Southern mom to order some flaming cheese.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,8,5,3,UfiITX-pWmNtbfo8YB2BvA

They make their hummus and baba ganoush with yogurt. Instant turn off.

Despite this I decide to give the place a chance and I order a vegetable skewer and plato's potatoes. Turn's out plato's potatoes is just french fries with another name.

One of two locations for a restaurant frequently named Best Greek Food by a notable local publication, Market Grille Café on West Lake Meade Boulevard was a spontaneous selection for Friday dinner after alternative plans fell through for unrelated reasons, the space whose name has fooled more than one into assuming it some sort of grocery store serving up a great dinner for three at a price far lower than much of its competition.

Located in the same shopping center as Panera, The Cupcakery and several other stores, entry to Market Grille Café sees patrons greeted by an open kitchen and homey confines as the menu spins Mediterranean by way of Greece and Italy, a smaller lunch variety and happy hour specials offered for those dining earlier in the day while more substantial options are reserved for full table service later in the evening.

Certainly more Athenian than Roman, though the similarities between dishes like Mousaka and Lasagna should seem fairly obvious to most, it was with an in-training server that the evening got under way as Iced Tea and Water were served to those at the table, the place fairly busy for 7:00 on a Saturday evening with all sorts of ages, genders and races represented in the crowd.

Encouraged to order in courses, most everything but the warmed Pita reportedly made in-house, it was with $5.50 small orders of Hummus next to creamy Eggplant puree with Garlic that the meal got started, the former a bit thinner than most of those previously tasted but at the same time full of flavor while the Babaganoush was far more chunky with a slight bit of smokiness left to linger in the mouth.

Not particularly wanting to over-order, the low prices actually quite deceiving for large plates when compared to the likes of Hummus Factory or Mykonos in Sun City, entrees were limited to just a trio of Greek favorites plus a few 'sides' including tender Gyro Meat and a quartet of ""Greek Meatballs"" (as described on the menu,) the Golfball sized Falafel our meal's only dud as ground Chickpea Fritters lacked any particular flavor on their own, save for that of the Oil.

Impressed by both the layered eggplant Mousaka with rich Beef Ragu, Spanakopita also quite nice with sheets of Phyllo interspersed by Spinach and springy Cheese, Pastitsio unfortunately seemed to be a bit overwhelmed with Cinnamon that completely overwhelmed both the Noodles and the other ingredients, far better bites found in two desserts including a generous slice of Baklava with plenty of Nuts and Honey plus a bowl of chilled Rice Pudding that embraced the grains texture rather than acting to completely hide it.

**** One of the more traditional Mediterranean menus in town, the limited Italian options seemingly just there because they are easy to make from ingredients commonly used in Greek cuisine, Market Grille Café offers good food at a fair price with plenty of vegetarian or more healthful options in an atmosphere that family friendly, but still nice enough to qualify for date night.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,4,GVeZIcRGr64raB4FQKBRew

My favorite here is always the Traditional gyro or platter. I like that they have a lunch special which includes a gyro or wrap and your choice of filling, traditional , chicken, falafel or veggie. choice of salad, fries or basmati rice, and a drink all for $9.95

I've been here for dinner and had the trio with the Moussaka, Pastitsio, and spanakopita, the servings were smaller than I expected, as I was sharing this meal between the 3 of us so that we could have a taste and that's basically what we had  each was a bite. Although we did order a greek salad and an appetizer of hummus and pita. 

The aphrodite's  cheesecake was good. Basically we were watching the video on the screen which showed how they were making it and on the recommendation of the worker we ordered it. It was very interesting to have the baklava crust. I would get it again if I have  any room that is. 

staff is always friendly here, you get greeted when you arrive and when you leave and they shout ""Opa!"" when the food order is up.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,2,1,4,DCbULafoyWMFxWfipJ68BA

Maybe I'm spoiled by having already tasted the best gyro in the world (from Cleveland's West Side Market), but I expected a full flavor experience here.  I think I was fooled by the care that went into the design of the restaurant, which gives it a faux-cultural flare. Unfortunately, there was not even faux flare in my gyro.

But the thing I absolutely have to review is their Saganaki appetizer. Their description is: ""greek imported cheese, simmered with lemon & brandy. Served tableside on a ""flaming"" iron skillet"". But what they should have said is: ""heaven in your mouth"".

This dish is such an explosion of flavor. It's a savory and a little tangy, and absolutely perfect. I could NOT stop commenting how wonderful it was with every bite. Even while I was eating, I was worried that soon the dish was going to be done. There is no way I can possibly describe this dish to it's full potential, so I highly recommend everyone to just go try it for themselves!

I was so happy I randomly ordered this dish. After I tried it the first time, I had to go back with a friend only ONE WEEK later to make them try it too! Happily, she also really enjoyed it.

The saganaki (fire fried cheese) was too wet and not fire burnt.  The fire woudln't light.

My chicken tasted fine, but was too dry. My wife's Mousaka was ok-but not as good as she has had elsewhere.  She has been eating at Greek restaurants for years.

We decided to give Market Grille Cafe a try, based on the reviews and proximity to our house. The decor isn't exactly inviting or particularly Greek or Mediterranean, which should have been our first clue. The flow is a little weird; you order at the registers and they bring your food to your table for you. There isn't a ton of space in the register area and it gets congested quite easily. I did appreciate the Yelp check in offer, which I had no problem redeeming with the cashier. My husband and I had trouble locating a menu, but one of the girls eventually brought us a little brochure and we both decided on the Greek Gyro and an order of their seasoned fries. The cashier asked if we wanted yogurt sauce on our gyros, strike two! Gyros should always come with tzatziki sauce! I then ventured over to the corner to get some water from the fountain, there was a sign on the Soda Machine saying that Soda was not free. Seriously? I'm sure this is a minor issue in all restaurants, people saying that they would like water and then filling their cup with soda, but the soda costs virtually nothing. I have never seen this sign anywhere else and it was slightly offensive, let's not patronize our customers OK? When the food arrived it was lackluster at best. The gyro meat was cold and the yogurt sauce was just yogurt and dill. The fries were covered in Paprika and were served with a side of yogurt sauce with hot sauce mixed in, not good.
