I ate here with my bf on a Friday night and I have to say that I was a bit impressed since I love sushi. That being said they have a variety of rolls (all sound so yummy), a huge AYCE menu, and I didn't have to wait to be seated. Of course I did the AYCE since I love getting my grub on. 

Now to the food... 
Cajun Albacore (Good, but too much rice) 
Octopus (I love octopus and that's that, too much rice though) 
Red Bull Roll (half order, loaded with flavor and has a kick to it) 
Popcorn Lobster (one of my favorite rolls, yes it's that good) 
Screamin O (must try) 
Tempura Green tea Ice cream 

I'd definitely come back to this place and totally recommend this spot to the sushi lovers. Prices are good, service was good, and food was delicious.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,3,2,4,gy0VlXlrhcPqsqESOrAIjg

169549,2010-12-14,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"It saddens me to write this review - it really does...

Hubby and I went here for date night recently and we were so disappointed I almost wanted to cry..  A little history first...

We stumbled into this establishment within a week of opening back in 2005 and instantly fell in love with the owners - still beyond friendly to this day  - and the teppanyaki room.  No matter when we went, you know whichever chef was working was going to give a great show with delicious food made with high quality ingredients...

We moved quite some distance away and our visits became less frequent but we still always looked forward to visiting whenever possible.  We went earlier this year and their standards definitely dropped but I just thought it was a bad night - nothing bad enough to give a bad yelp review for.  Unfortunately that was not the case...

Well, on our most recent visit when I saw no one in the room at 6:45ish on a Friday night - that should have been Clue #1 that it was going to be bad.  Clue #2 should have been that their grills were cold and it took a half hour to heat up - who know when the last time they were used.  Clue # 3 was when I asked if I could have grilled shrimp instead of chicken with my ribeye and was told no - that has never been an issue before in 5 years.

Got the soup and it changed from before - no more amazing miso broth with delicate mushrooms and onion slivers - it was hard chunks of tofu in a indescriable in not a good way cloudy broth that tasted rancid.  Then onto the salad - what used to be a nice mix of microgreens is now iceburg lettuce salad in a bag - and a teaspoon (if that) of bottled past its prime dressing - yippee (not)!  When you are paying over $30 a piece for dinner - please at least make an effort to make it less ""bag-like"".

Now onto dinner ... after waiting forever for the grill to warm up - we were starving and looking foward to the ""show""...  The chef (you could tell he did not do this very often) - couldn't even get his matches lit - after a while he gave up and started cooking the veggies (he put them in a very big dice and they were barely warm - they were tough and rubbery - not fresh at all).  He then made the rice and it had zero flavor and barely any veggies or egg in it.  It just didn't taste good at all. Then he placed the ribeye (which I asked for medium rare), chicken and shrimp on the grill all together - he burned the shrimp, and the steak was so tough, well done and tasted off - I couldn't eat it.  His flair skills were horrible too and we did not have a good time.  At that point we just wanted the check and wanted to go home.  

We never left hungry from Nagoya before and we were both very disappointed and I felt sick to my stomach.  The only reason this is getting a two star rating is because the owner and the servers are still beyond friendly and nice and were very happy to see us.  I  noticed this place has mainly turned into an AYCE sushi place - unfortunately it was at the expense of what we felt was the best teppanyaki place in Vegas.  I know the owner is trying to keep two restaurants afloat in this horrific economy - but maybe shutter one of them and bring the quality back to the one remaining.  We won't be back :(",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,5,1,2,rGW1OxPKUUxHZDSVH68cbQ

We both did get the AYCE as it is for the entire menu. I really should have read the entire menu. Down in the lower corner where it states no leftovers. I honestly did not know. Never have encountered such a thing before. 
Not once while we were ordering did the server mention the leftover rule. We did not go overboard by any means. my husband did leave some sushi as he did not like one of the rolls. 
The food was ok. For me the best was the egg roll and the fried rice. My husband did enjoy the other two rolls he ordered. One was crab. 
At the end of our meal the server came over and then went on to tell us about the leftover rule. I had to ask her to repeat it as I was not understanding. We both felt like we were being scolded. She went on to tell us she will not charge us this time as it was our first time here. 
We paid our check and left. We both felt so uncomfortable. Honestly we did not have a lot of food left. We did not even order alot. We did not order dessert.

1896151,2011-05-06,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"This place might have the worst sushi I've ever tasted.  The rolls I had lacked flavor and were heavy handed on the rice. The ingredients were very low quality and hard to distinguish amongst all the rice.  Their accompanying sauces were terrible as well and noticeably store bought and not made in house. I'm truly amazed that this place is still in business because it is just fowl. AYCE is probably keeping them afloat, but even that isn't a great deal because it's all you can eat shit! Albertsons seriously makes better sushi; my grandma who doesn't know/never had sushi could make better rolls. Understand my point? Their rolls are like going to McDonald's ordering a 1/4lb with cheese and receiving a 1/16lb with cheese and extra bun. I thought Kaizen was half-assed, but they look like Bar Masa compared to Nagoya. So this review isn't entirely negative, I thought I should mention that their Asahi beer was quite tasty.

It's small-ish with sushi bar seating and then a few tables around the room.

The menu was lengthy. There were a lot of rolls to choose from, which I appreciated. And you can order half sizes of the rolls, so you can try out more types.

Everything was alright. Nothing was bad. Nothing was great. It was average and mediocre. Not the greatest quality, but not bad quality either. This is a very middle of the road establishment.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,1,3,dkrTz17myXsu66FTJSS7TQ

2138377,2010-06-19,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"Honestly, if you love GOOD sushi don't do the All You Can Eat here.  At first I thought it was novel that the restaurant would make everything to order (and it is) however getting whole rolls limits you because you can really only eat so much. The rolls were really just average at best. There were no ""stand outs"".  But just an example of one disappointment - I ordered a roll that sounded good with soft shell crab in it, I think it was called the Red Bull. I have been eating sushi for over 20 years and softshell crabs for over 35 years. I know it when I see it. There was simply nothing more than minced crab stick in the roll.. When I asked about it the lady ""assured"" me that it was soft crab but the chef chops it up for the roll. Huh? It was not good at all. out of 4 rolls I ordered only one was really any good. Not to mention their rules that you have to eat all of what you order - no wasting the rice or you will be surcharged. Their sushi pieces had way too much rice (which is obviously their goal to fill you with rice).

Honestly... don't do it. If you know good sushi you will be soarly disappointed. 

In all honesty I can't speak for the rest of the options on the AYCE menu, why fill-up on noodles when you can order sushi.",3XJ7La2VWbDaeMbS2Olhlw,1,0,2,Q9NNRa-pstMjyD4vQZTI0Q

3592459,2012-04-17,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"When sushi is your favorite food in the world, you would expect that trying to find a new favorite sushi bar (because the old one broke your heart) would be exciting - right? First of all, it's supposed to be hard to find ""bad"" sushi. After all, if the fish is fresh the only factor left should be the rice - or so at least that was my perception until recently. 

As it turns out, bad sushi has little to do with the freshness of the fish. Bad sushi is a product of bad management.

Nagoya is good example of ""bad"" sushi, simply due to the fact that management has decided that several of the factors that make up a good sushi bar are too expensive to offer. I understand that offering AYCE can be a financial concern, so I expect that some types of sushi are going to be offered on a ""one per visit"" or ""dinner price only"" basis, as many places around town will do. But what I cannot forgive, is not stocking those items at all.

During my visit to Nagoya, there were several of my favorite sushi offerings that were simply not available; some are not even stocked on a regular basis. So even though I was willing to pay extra for the sea urchin, there was none to be had. 

And to add insult to injury, the salmon roe was not fresh (it was actually very nasty) AND they do not carry quail eggs - what?. The chef said they do not carry quail eggs (which are an essential compliment to the salmon roe and sea urchin) because they do not get enough call for it. Well I've been to the 168 market and I know that a dozen quail eggs is extremely cheap - so I say that's a crappy excuse, but one I expect from a crappy sushi bar.

Just to note: the sushi chef was actually great. It's just too bad he has so little to work with.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,1,1,2,YNhG34xYVaiEzNSuk6d-qA

The moment we walk through the door, the owners always approach us to say hi and even give all of us a hug! So sweet!

Food is good! This was the first place that I had my first Screaming Orgasm, the sushi not literally. Shredded radish with Tuna sitting on top and some kinda spicy sauce. It was my favorite then I moved onto the spicy scallop roll, yep, I heart it. After having their Spicy Scallop at this location, I now judge other places on their version lol. Another one of my all time favorites is Garlic Tuna, which is so difficult to mess up, and theirs is so YUMMY. If you order a lot, they put them on these large sail boats, it's real nice presentation!

If sushi, raw or cooked is not your thing, they do have a full menu of other non-sushi items like Chicken Teriyaki, Udon Soup, etc. Another option is their Teppanyaki. It's pretty good! MUCH, MUCH better than Bennihana and isn't as expensive! 

Restaurant is very cute. You can sit at the sushi bar, tables or if you're having Teppanyaki, where you can also order sushi, it's in a separate room.

4658013,2013-02-13,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"Even though this is the closest AYCE sushi restaurant to my office, I really need to stop coming here. Once every 6 months or so I mistakenly forget how bad the rolls are and decide to eat lunch at Nagoya. I did it again today. Hopefully this review will remind me next time. Never again.

I begin with shrimp tempura and calamari tempura appetizers. Too much breading. Almost more breading than seafood. My next order was salmon and eel nigiri. Not bad. Next was a baked roll (volcano roll) and a deep fried roll (can't remember). Both terrible. I conclude with tuna and spicy tuna nigiri. Again, not bad. The decent nigiri saves Nagoya from the dreaded one star rating.

Final verdict: 2 stars",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,0,0,2,h0yOfB84LVJYx9syIJQ0Mw

We ordered a couple kinds of rolls, some with fish some without, both were excellent - they put some kind of sweet sauce on the crab rolls and it was exceptional! We also had some vegetarian tempura and that too was really, really good. Beyond that, the service was excellent, the waitress even noticed our inability to use chopsticks so she doctored them up with a rubber band to make them fool proof and it worked! I will absolutely go there from now on when I need a sushi fix!",EuJB31aGryLpR7nME2jXvQ,0,0,5,XPeaSdOV8BBvpuJkKtmJ8A

When I first started going they didn't have AYCE. But in the last couple years they started doing that. I'm never disappointed and always very full and happy by  the end. 

Order the RED n RED if you like garlic ponzu
The Baked Green Mussels 
Volcano Roll

Those are my favorites!",FHfW8VVagiHQL-nWKk_1Qw,1,0,4,5YTHdEXXE9NpG93m5eO2Lw
4986631,2013-01-11,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"Whenever I eat at Nagoya, there are 3 items that I am sure to order first: The Screaming Orgasm (Seriously delish), Tiger Roll (which is good almost everywhere) and the Red & Red roll (which is similar to Tiger Roll, except it's regular tuna on top but with a spicy ponzu rather than sweet eel sauce) These are my top 3. After I've had my fix, I'll start to explore the menu for other yummy things. 

Now, although not everything I have ordered from Nagoya was good (there are a few rolls I am not a fan of) for the most part, I know what my taste buds enjoy, and try to stick to what is in the range of that. For instance, ordered a Nato roll once. That was a huge mistake, and I really think it was Nagoya's fault, I should have known I would not like fermented beans. My mistake. I had a burrito roll (not sure if that's the real name) but I found out I don't like deep fried rolls (too much rice). Now, anywhere I visit for sushi, I don't order things like that. 

Over the years, I have noticed that, with sushi becoming more popular and more sushi places opening up around town and stepping their game up, Nagoya has been less busy than when I first started going there.  Sometimes I would go in for dinner, and be the only table in the place, however, it's always satisfying. The price is reasonable as well.

Went there just recently, and I am not sure if it was because there was a new sushi chef or what, but I was a little disappointed with the quality of the sushi (especially my screaming o) It just didn't do it for me; I've noticed the difference the past couple of times we ate here.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,0,3,Bi9_lqsbGWkiV7mdzfpraw
5070904,2012-03-23,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"So I want to update this review. This is my 3rd time here.  1st time was well over a year ago for AYCE, then a few weeks ago for a lunch take out special (which was horrible) But I figured maybe I mis judged them and I should try the AYCE again.  
So.... I walked in and there were about 8 other people there (not too busy). Hell I was surprised to even see that many actually.  They have 2 chef's behind the counter and I'm waiting patiently and I finally place my order. They typically stuff their rolls FULL of too much rice, so my first order was small just in case.  To my surprise it was a normal amount. I was beginning to think that they may have changed their ways.  The sushi chefs were a bit slow and I caught on pretty quickly that this was going to be a problem, because a saw a party of 4 walk in, then a few other small parties and a few people also sat down at the sushi bar.  For most places, this is great and I'm always glad to see that people are coming in, but the sushi chefs here were already so slow, now what are they going to do.  Well it took forever to get my next few orders and I started to see why. They were very detailed with some of the orders and I don't mind that, but ONLY if you can do that and do it quickly.  Other orders were SOOOO skimpy.  I enjoyed their sex on the beach roll but it's topped with slices of salmon.  The salmon slice didn't even cover the top of each piece of sushi, it was also incredibly thin, and part of the roll wasn't even cut into pieces. 

All in all their quality was fairly good and I enjoyed my handrolls very much but I somehow knew this was gonna happen as it often happens at mediocre places like this.. I order my uni and sweet shrimp ""oh I'm sorry we're out""  I WAS PISSED!!!!
and it was on a Wednesday TOO.  (I happen to know that Tuesday and Wednesday are the best days for sushi because of the fish markets in asia, so there was NO reason to be out of it) once again they most likely didn't want to serve it as part of the all you can eat.

What's sad is this place has GREAT potential, and you can easily see that from the menu, the variety of rolls and even the sushi chefs. At one point I wanted to stand up and shout out how easily they are making this a bad place and it doesn't have to be.

All they have to do is work faster MAYBE put a 3rd sushi chef on, and don't be so skimpy with their fish. I understand cost and not over doing it either but don't be skimpy. There are PLENTY of other great AYCE sushi places that don't skimp at all.

This place is very very borderline  about coming back for a return visit.  I typically eat in 45 min I was there approx 1 hr 20 min.  That is just TOO long for just goin by myself.  

Work on your speed Nagoya. Guests were comin in the door to give you a chance and you're blowing it and yet you have great potential.",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,0,2,Pp2SOZ3xYTDTdJMK2uwyVA

The sushi is very good and fresh and we have yet to see a crowd.   You can also get everything else on the menu.  The staff is very friendly.  Our only complaint is the lack of variety in the sushi specials.  Although there are three columns of special rolls they are all very similar except for a few with strange sauces.  We have tried nearly everything and only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the items have received repeat performances. There are the usual rules about sharing and leftovers but they don't appear too strict here. We get the AYCE because we can share and try more items for less money. They will make half rolls on request.  We try to go here about once a month since our 7 year old loves her some sushi.  Our search for the perfect sushi place continues but until we find it, Nagoya will keep us fat and happy.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,1,0,3,RJRBWd8qu90lTW8d_y752Q

5915218,2012-01-13,0,mbOkgswPkYbbIUflogSC9A,"Once again another bootleg Japanese restaurant.. 
Being new to the spring valley area, I decided to try some new local digs; Boy was I disappointed with this stop... 

I am 0 for 2 with Japanese joints on Ft. Apache
Geisha House and now here....

On the surface, it looked like a good spot; nice ambiance, decor and location however that's where the compliments stop.

I ordered a chicken katsu & teriyaki dinner box. There were only a few people in the joint,( maybe 3 or 4) so I figured that the food would come out pretty quick. It took them 20plus minutes for them to bring my food out. Worst part about the wait  was it was cold! 
AND THEN!!!
The katsu was so thin it looked like they breaded luncheon meat. The teri beef tasted like it was sitting old meat rolled in kikkoman teri glaze. 

The only thing that was worth eating was the few pieces of California roll that came with the box . This is the only reason why I didn't give this a 1* rating. Based off of that, I would think that the AYCE sushi might be tolerable. BUT since this is a Korean sushi joint they would scrutinize you for not cleaning your plate and try to charge you for any leftovers. 


The only thing that came fast was the check and that didnt even come fast enough. 
With so many choices on Ft. Apache, I would suggest you go somewhere else...",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,2,0,2,DgSVmntzU29XV04gO9GKSg
