161541,2014-01-28,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"The space is quite large considering I've never seen too many people at once in any venue within their shopping mall. There is a bar at the outside corner with about 8 stools inside and a counter facing out for take away beverages, plus a number of 2- and 4-top tables throughout and another high top long table with 10 seats. Ordering is a bit confusing; there were a few iPads at the front on a stand in a self-ordering section, but they weren't working the day of my visit so I was guided to one of the registers alongside them. The drink station is way in the back corner of the restaurant next to a large rack of their unlabeled generic hamburger buns and cases of beer. The menu features quite a selection of pre-designed burgers, dogs, virgin and spiked shakes as well as several types of fries. Also, for a place with the word 'ketchup' in its name, you'd expect a larger selection than the four that I was able to choose from, with one being generic ketchup flavor.

Trying to keep my burger fairly simple to sample what they're capable of, I went with the mushroom Swiss burger: Angus beef patty, grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, Swiss cheese and mayo. Upon first bite I was able to identify a completely generic beef patty; it was cooked ok but tasted like something you'd get at a ballpark and not what you'd expect for a 'premium' burger bar. The onions completely overpowered most of the flavors, and were a bit undercooked for my taste. The bun looked overdone, but was actually fresh and pretty good considering its generic presence. The half-melted cheese didn't have a great presence, and the mushrooms were probably less noticeable than the mayo. Overall there was nothing good about this burger.

The fries were of the slightly thick cut, definitely generic frozen variety. They were seasoned with your typical fry seasoning and totally undercooked. Also the oil flavor was possibly a little foul even considering this was fairly early in the day. Not only was the burger and fries not great, but this meal with a drink came to a whopping $16.19! I don't remember being told what my total was at the time of ordering, and wasn't even given a receipt after my purchase. I usually come at these meals ready to spend whatever it takes to do my review, but when I logged into my account later to see the amount I was shocked based on what I was given. Evaluating this meal on that price is bad enough, but when you consider that BurGR is just down the hall in the casino, I could not recommend that you buy a burger here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,0,1,zOn3ZiZn1mhukBXBbLcgug

Ordered a standard cheese burger with fries.  Burger was way over cooked and was obviously a pre-frozen hockey puck.  The bun was not bread as much as it was styrofoam.  Ate half of it.  Fries were actually quite good.  Cooked crispy and salty and fresh.  The wide selection of ketchup was also a nice touch.

563920,2015-04-13,2,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"Here are just the FACTS about burger joints on the Las Vegas strip from somebody who has been going to Vegas regularly for the last 15 years.
#1 for the price has got to be Bobby Flays burger place. Never been disappointed yet and the price is even cheaper than Johnny Rockets.
Biggest Rip-off: Guy Fieri's place. Wow, is this place expensive.....two burger, two beers, two orders of sweet potato fries $55 after tax and tip. And folks, let me tell you, Guy Fieri is a great guy to watch on t.v. but his burger is nothing special (the fries were very good though, again, $$$$).
Ketchup falls somewhere in between. With a groupon offer this place is absolutely worth it, without a deep discount I'd skip the joint and, again, head over to Bobby Flays.

984448,2014-06-19,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"Good: 
- Good size burgers and sides (fries, onion rings, etc.) and pretty tasty ;)
- Opens until 2AM!!! (we were surprised to find how few restaurants and eateries actually open past 10 or 11pm in Vegas.)
- Those choose your own flavor sodas machines - you know, the ones with like 17 buttons that you can make your own grape flavored Sprite or something. this one even has diet Barq's! ;)
- Two for One Draft or fountain drink for HaPpy HouR - good for beer, but if you're just getting a fountain drink, just use the ""make it a meal"" option, which makes your drink essentially free with your fries.

Fair:
- My sweet potato fries were good - for the half that were actually properly cooked. the other half should've stayed in the fryer longer :( The gals there were nice enough that if I asked, they'd probably make a new batch for me. But it was a lot of food, and I didn't really need more.

If it's hard to see the prices on the pictures, here's the gist of it that's not on their website - prices:

- BURGERS are about $9 for a hamburger to $13 fancy schmancy. 
- Sandwiches, Salads, Chicken Tenders $6-7
- Fancy-named hot dogs $6-8

- ADD cheese for $1 (a bit steep, but considering i was adding it to a $9 burger, it wasn't too bad), bacon or chili for $1.50, jalapeno, grilled mushroom, or caramelized onion for $0.75

- Milkshakes $7, SPIKED shakes $9

- Sides: 
    @ fries $3.99 (add fries and soda to meal $4.49
    @ sweet potato fries $4.99 (add it AND soda to meal still $4.99 - no joke. that's how i ordered it. sweet ;) right?)
    @ ""panko crusted"" onion rings (didn't taste that different from regular onion rings, sorry!) $ 5.99

I didn't come across any prob with service. It was ordered at the counter, put your number on the table, they bring you food, they later clear your food as you finish, but you refill your own fountain drinks - type of thing.

Pros:
-food is decent and the price isn't too bad
-offers more than just a burger, they also offer chilli cheese fries 
-corner lot and very comfortable atmosphere
-numerous TVs and simple menu

Cons:
I'm huge on service. It's a make or break for me. This is where the the restaurant quickly lost two stars. The person who took my order wasn't very helpful, she didn't even smile, she seemed impatient, and she even said "" you should have ordered at the bar, but I'll help you."" Being that myself, amongst many only vacationers who probably visit this restaurant ONCE to determine whether it's worth while or not, wouldn't know that so why not just help us and at least pretend you are there to help serve the customer. 
-the bartender was very unaware of her surroundings. She looked at my tag that I needed a beer, said she'll be right with me, helped 2 customers, made only one of my two beers that were already paid for, and helped the next customer. It wasn't until 2 customers later that I said, ""sorry I need two...."" I shouldn't have to remind someone nor feel like it's up to me to make sure they do their job.... 
-food: the food was decent, they forgot my jalepenos on my chilli fries. The only positive to this was one of the ladies, blonde, who helped me, was extremely friendly and went out of her way to help me.

The people who work here are quite accommodating. I came here wanting to try a burger and not just any burger on the menu. I want a chicken burger. The good thing is they can make a special custom order. So I chose the Hawaiian Burger with pineapple, chicken, mac n cheese. If I had a name for it, I would call it a ""Hula Chick-n-Mac."" It's an unusual combination but that's how I like it. When it was prepared on my first visit, it was a juicy, tender chicken breast with a good amount of mac n cheese, and it was delicious! But on my second visit, I ordered the same thing and I was a bit disappointed. There was less mac n cheese, and instead of having the lettuce place on the bottom of my burger bun (like the first visit) they had the lettuce on top, which cause the sauce to soak on the bottom bun and it was messy to eat.

The fries were well seasoned and crispy and the chili cheese fries option offered enough for two ppl.

The taste and cook of the burger was delicious however both times we went here the egg was not fried it was fully cooked which kind of ruined the purpose of having a fried egg on your burger. I went here with two friends who did not eat but they ordered shakes instead. We waited thirty five minutes for my burger (not packed inside) and they did not bring the shakes out. We waited fifteen more minutes and finally my friends decided to walk up to the counter to see if they had forgotten about the shakes, even though they said they didn't. I decided to just eat and finish my meal and even after demolishing my burger and fries their shakes STILL were not out yet. Finally after going to the counter again they finally brought out the shakes which were terrible. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEIR SHAKES. I'm not over exaggerating it was literally like water blended with ice and a dab of chocolate syrup. So overpriced for the super low quality shake you get. We could've just saved money and gone to a fast food restaurant for a better quality. Other than terrible food and service, the place didn't run smoothly.

SERVICE: It's a walk-up and order joint with dining available at the bar. I guess the bartender isn't familiar with how to take food orders, because placing my order was much more complicated than it needed to be. He didn't know about the promotion, then didn't know how to ring it up, got frustrated and short with me until a manager came over to help out, then he never said another word to me. I don't know why I tipped him, his bad attitude made me feel guilty for inconveniencing him to serve me.

FOOD: Wanted a mushroom swiss burger, added mushrooms and garlic aioli, and switched out the cheese on the classic, and added a side of fried pickle spears, to make a purchase to offset the freebie.  Received a plain burger with swiss cheese, out three minutes after it was rung up and was room temperature.  Bartender brought it over and didn't even notice the missing ingredients. Went to counter to get assistance, manager stepped in again and had mushrooms brought out to me and comped the pickles. Burger was cooked well done, super dry. The garlic aioli was a smear the size of my thumb. Mushrooms had no flavor. Pickle spears were long and skinny like fries, and served sans any sort of dipping sauce, which I found odd. No flavor other than salty. Didn't finish burger or side. Mad that I wasted the calories on the poor quality I ate. Free or not, I've had better burgers from a drive-thru window.

TL;DR: It's pretty bad to have to complain about something that's already discounted. Staff other than management doesn't seem to care. Appreciated the manager helping out and trying to make things right- but he wouldn't have to comp anything if employees simply did their (very basic) jobs.

We skipped the burgers and got a chili cheese hot dog (with bacon added), poutine fries, and regular fries (so we could try all the different ketchups). The hot dog was alright. Nothing near as good as say Pink's (which is also located in Planet Hollywood). It was big and thick and loaded with all the toppings. The chili was meh. The poutine fries were edible, but far from even qualifying as good. The regular fries were just frankly icky. The variety of ketchups was great and the maple bacon ketchup and hickory ketchup were standouts.

It's located in the Miracle Mile Shops. If you park in the shops parking garage, this is one of the first places you will see when you enter the shops.

You order at the counter, receive a number, and then take a seat of your choosing.

There's also a small bar area if you want to get an over-priced beer ($7 for a Stella).

The counter staffer was incredibly less than pleasant. She looked like she had just rolled out of bed and would rather be anywhere but there. 

We arrived just before the dinner time rush. And with just one staffer to place and bring out orders, we could see our order sitting in the window for way too long. We finally went and got it ourselves. Not cool.

And then a woman who I presume was a manager came out and started helping deliver the orders by yelling out the numbers instead of finding them. Not disruptive at all.

And the music was definitely way too loud.

Amazon  Local had a deal for it so I  thought I would take advantage while  my wife and Kids were out of town.  I had $22 to spend so I was sat at the bar (of course).  Cheryl was the bartender and very enthusiastic.  She recommended the burger and beer deal for $10.  Sounded good to me (although I had to add bacon to it).  So I have only spend $10 of $22 at this point so I am doing great.  Added on $3 fries. $13.  I still have $9.  Cocktail I say.  Whiskey Sour please.  Cheryl says that is $10 or $10 with a souvenir cup same quantity of booze.  But I can bring it back and get a drink in it for $5.  Deal.  Ok so I am at $23 bucks not bad.  1/2 way through the experience I show her my Amazon deal.  She says that due to the Burger and Beer Deal I can't get that discounted.  Oh crap I should have mentioned this when I first sat down.  My fault.  Ended up using the $10 to get 2 32oz PBR's.

Service- The cashier was friendly and patient with the 5 of us, as we all had coupons and he had to ring each order up separately. The coupon was for a free order of fries and soda with the purchase of a burger. The food was done really quick which is a good and a bad thing. Good because we were hungry, but bad because if food is coming out that quick it must be sitting on a grill or in a warmer.

Ketchup- Along the side wall there was is a self serve area that includes a ketchup bar with 6 different sauce pumps, 4 of them were ketchup flavors. They had sriracha, balsamic, hickory and regular ketchup as well as buffalo and fry sauces. I thought they were all okay but preferred the fry sauce best. They also have the Freestyle Coke machine.

Food-  I ordered the Mac Attack burger ($12+)  described on the menu as ""angus patty, fried macaroni and cheese patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, garlic aioli."" They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked and it came out almost well done. This leads me to believe my theory of food sitting on the grill/warmer is correct. Luckily the toppings made the burger edible. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese patty because it was melty and cheesy and added some really good flavor. The garlic aioli was minimal but tasty and worked well with the other toppings. And of course the bacon was good but I would have preferred it to be more crispy.

Ketchup is always one of my first stops when I arrive in Vegas and this most recent trip was no exception. I can't really speak to the food but the spiked milkshakes are great and are why I go. They have a variety of amazingly delicious spiked milkshakes that will get your Vegas vacation off on a great foot. My personal favorites are the Strawberry Shortcake and the Dirty Pretzel.

Located inside The Miracle Mile, the vibe at Ketchup is very diner-esque. You order at the counter and have your food brought to you. You can also sit at the bar and order, which we generally do so we can order drinks. The staff is great - I've had great service every time I've dined there.",HFWckxypPmpvmWMURRo1rA,3,1,4,UTOdZDf5qBcyhG7eL4i0CQ

1. The food is really not worth the price. I mean i get that its vegas and things Are just pricier in general but i mean $20 for a burger n fries n drink is pretty steep
 
2. Its sort of a fast food joint so paying $40 for a couple i felt like i paid restaurant prices at a in n out. 

3. They charge for everything!!!! I spent $40 got 5 different things then asked for ranch and they said its $.50... Are u kidding me!!?? 

4. The cashier didnt really care about what he was doing.. Didnt help us with anything.. He had our food sitting under the hear lamps for so long i went up and asked to get them... My chili cheese fries were so cold i asked them to mKe new ones. So i put a little onion on top to mark it to see if it'll be there when they brought it back and sure enough it was there!!!

My fiance said her Hawaiian Burger (with Chicken substitution) was mediocre. Not the greatest and not the worst, but nothing to remember or return for. 

Ketchup has a premium location and great for people watching along the miracle mile. The onion rings and alcohol-milkshakes both looked intriguing and might tempt me next time I pass by.",Da5A6BUpmmnJy1xByobYNA,2,1,2,WvVJcCL3QM7r4AiQzQLrbw

2491256,2016-01-20,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"Taste-wise, the burgers at Ketchup are great as far as fast food burgers go. The only problem is that it's almost the same price as a some of the gourmet burger spots around town. 

I ordered the Big Bleu Burger ($12) and my girlfriend ordered the Morning Glory ($12). Both burgers were satisfying. The meat quality was above most fast food chains, and the ingredients tasted fresh. Aptly, Ketchup has a variety of different ketchups that you can choose from. I'd highly recommend the balsamic ketchup or the hickory ketchup.

But Ketchup burgers are far from gourmet--although they want to be so badly. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes great, but it's not worth $12 a burger (and that's without fries or a drink). We had a Groupon, so we thought we'd try it out. But honestly, I'd rather pay an extra $2 per person and get a true gourmet burger at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, which is literally in the same building.

I could have easily given this place 2 stars, but as a standalone burger joint, I couldn't complain about any of the food. 

This place is great if you want to spend the same amount on a fast food burger as you do on a gourmet burger. But honestly, Carl's Jr. has the same type of burgers for half the price. I get that it's Las Vegas, and this place also has a full bar attached to it, but part of eating on a budget is being wise when choosing a place to eat. Heck, even if you're not on a budget, it just makes sense to go to a better burger spot for the same price. Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is not a wise decision in either situation.

When the burger arrived it wasn't the right one and we had to send it back. The waitress was pleasant and got the right one out very quickly after the mistake.

Well my Boyfriend and I came and ordered our food it was probably around 6- 6:30 pm, and I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and he ordered some kind of Teryaki Hawaiian Burger, we split a fry and he got a drink. 

It didn't take long to come to our table.

The maple bacon one, the hickory, and so on.

After being redirected to the bar, the bartender then said the place was backed up and we had to wait at least 30 mins for our food. There were people at the bar drinking, but only some tables were occupied for dining.

3107601,2014-04-17,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"F.A.S.T. Review:

Food: I really wanted to try one of their burgers, especially one with an egg, but by the time we dropped by I was too full from a previous meal and just wanted to try the poutine. I was super excited because I don't know many places that serve poutine (although now it's becoming a popular dish). When we finally received our order (see SERVICE) I was sadly disappointed. The gravy was lukewarm and didn't have much flavor to it. There was also barely any cheese curds so the whole dish was pretty bland to me. I had to dip the fries in ketchup which really defeats the purpose of poutine. 

Ambiance: Cute concept, down to the Heinz ketchup garbage cans. Diner like restaurant where you order at the counter before sitting down. 

Service: We were greeted right away and we ordered before a huge line formed behind us. After ordering we killed time by stocking up on the different ketchups and I even looked through the options at the soda machine. 45 minutes later I was wondering what happened to our order. We ordered one item and although the kitchen was pretty backed up, it wasn't like they were cooking a burger or anything. Frustrated, we went back to the counter after we noticed that everyone else had already received their order. Apparently, they had lost our ticket. Big no no. 

Tips: Overall it seemed just like your average burger place on the strip. Nothing really memorable except for the different types of ketchup.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,5,2,2,n_Fpf4M2-UBJ1de5ijJo3A

I sat for 4 minutes before the bartender acknowledged me. Then he came over and dropped a menu and then proceeded to help other people. He got their drinks and order in before he even gave me the time of day and I was there first. 

Told the bartender I was allergic to tomatoes and he proceeded to give me a cup to go get my own ketchup.................let that sink in

I saw him pouring the company liquor into his own drink cup. Yes guests can see and notice these things.

I ordered a Hot Mess which was a cheeseburger topped with a bunch of chili, jalapenos, and guacamole. It was a hot mess too! I needed a bunch of napkins lol The first bite was so full of flavor. All the ingredients come together nice in that 1st bite. But as the burger cooled down, I noticed the chili wasn't special. It was like regular ol' canned chili. Once my burger got too cool, I didnt even want the rest. It turned from a Hot Mess to a mess. But I blame my woman and I having a good time partly. I didn't just scarf down my mess of a burger.

My woman ordered a Western burger which is just a cheesburger w/an onion ring, 2 pieces of bacon, and hickory ketchup. And she liked almost every bite of her burger, but I ate the rest of her burger once my burger stopped satisfying my tastebuds! We both wondered why there were only two pieces of bacon on a $12 burger... But the Western was an awesome choice.

The KETCHUP was so good. I loved the flare to the chipotle ketchup. I'd go back there just to order a beer at the bar with a fry and that hickory ketchup. That hickory ketchup is the best ketchup I've ever had in my life! Is ""the best ketchup ever"" a thing?

Both my daughter and husband are obsessed with ketchup and this place, with at least 6 different varieties of it, doesn't disappoint.
My favs were the fry sauce and the garlic ketchup.
Their parmesan garlic fries were very tasty.
I had the Western burger, which is similar to the one you can get at Carl's Jr, but with a better brioche bun and higher quality meat.
Daughter had the corn dog, which was good but pretty standard.
Can't remember which burger husband got, but remember he was pleased with the quality.
Prices are standard for Vegas ($12 burgers $6 fries).
They had shakes and boozy alcoholic shakes but we avoided those (too much sugar!)

3356957,2017-01-24,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"Geez where to start. I really have nothing good to say about this place. I failed to read the reviews before stepping in, my fail, lesson learned! Read the Yelp reviews people!

So this place has a Heinz them with branded trash cans, logos and other borrowed details but it seems they use the name but not the product, bate and switch seems to be a consistent theme, read on...

I order a $17 double bacon cheese burger, the double priced premium hand battered Zuccinni and a soft drink.

Lets start with the staff; no hello, no smile, no thank you for your order. Instead of service I get a flat toned, mumbling and annoyed stiff that seemed put out that she had to talk to me and who offered nothing in the way of help or friendliness. 

Dismayed, I take my number and turn the corner to see a row of flavored ketchups, including Fry sauce which I had to try as everyone in my family likes it. I also grabbed a sample of balsamic ketchup, it tasted like dark colored ketchup nothing special. Fry sauce was bland but tasted sort of what I expected. 

Next up soft drinks: mostly standard, the only diet choice was diet coke, this is a Las Vegas problem as Coke seems to have the town under it's thumb and only diet coke is offered in many places. I always find that odd for a place that prides itself on broad choices and variety. I visit many small, backwood, nowhere towns that have far more variety in soda choices but this is really not Ketchup's fault I guess just a Vegas thing.

I did not try the bar, but since it only had one patron the whole time I was there it did not make me think it was anything to get excited about. 

My food came out after a few minutes and the burger looked good and it was large (see picture) but the pluses stop there. The burger was bland and tasteless, worse they did not even get it right. I was specific about what I wanted on it (or did not want) and they seemed to reverse it. Maybe the annoyed and disinterested order taker could not be bothered to get it right or maybe today was opposite day. The meat was hard, over worked and over cooked with no taste. It was like the taste of fatty grocery store beef it you browned it and tasted it before seasoning. It was just cheap over worked meat not even grilled for broiled. There was a lot of it but so what more does not equal better. Bacon had a decent smoky flavor but undercooked, wet, and fatty. I could not finish it, not because it was too big but because it simply gaged me, it was terrible. I would have been happier with Sonic, Burger King or the local gas station heat lamp burger.

Now onto the premium, hand-breaded zucchini. Staying consistent these were ridiculously bad. Think generic grocery store, frozen, fried zucchini. Tasteless, heavy, poorly battered, clearly machine processed and not fresh at all. They should be embarrassed to call these premium. I did not eat much of them either before feeling sick and regretting my meal. I left feeling bloated and a little sick to my stomach.

So there you have it, stolen branding or bait and switch on the Heinz theme, terrible ingredients on the burger and poorly prepared, and frozen, cheapo, generic grocery store fried zuccini. What a terrible deal but at least they charged me $27 plus tax! 

I'll never be back, if you come upon this place, divert your eyes, keep walking, make the kids look away and run for the nearest exits. Save your wallet save your stomach.

Even if you're really craving a burger and don't have the patience to stand in line for an hour at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, which is also located in PH, I wouldn't suggest this be an alternative dining spot.

Mushroom Swiss Burger: I ordered this with no mayo and I thought it was fine. The one thing I didn't like about this was how large the buns were and how significantly small the patty was. 

There's an assortment of ketchup, like garlic and Sriracha. The garlic ketchup looked and tasted watered down, and the Sriracha ketchup was just...well, Sriracha and ketchup mixed together.

I live in Vegas, have seen this hamburger place but have never tried it so my husband and I decided to give it a shot. The place is very nice and clean, more of a ""fast food"" type restaurant than sit down and and be waited on restaurant. There aren't any prices on their website so I was a bit surprised when I got there and it was $11.99 for a hamburger and an extra $4.99 for fries and a drink. Seems pretty standard for a burger place on the strip BUT most are worth the money.

The guy who took our order was very nice, gave us smaller menus to look at. Took our order and we paid. Had no problems using the Groupon. Now the Groupon said something to the extent of don't forget to tip at the FULL price, not the discounted price so we ended up paying $23 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks.

The thing that really annoyed me was they asked for a tip and then right after told us where the SELF SERVING STATION was. So I just gave someone a generous tip to basically take our order and bring it to us. We got our own drinks, own condiments, found our own seat, etc. I like to tip generously for SERVICE and this wasn't a service. I felt that was a little arrogant.

Onto the food. Meh is all I have to say. The fries were awesome, hot and crunchy. The burger was meh. Flavorless, dry and nothing special. I had the western burger which had very little sauce and my husband had the hot mess which he said was also flavorless and dry.

All and all, I probably wouldn't go back unless there was another Groupon and someone in town visiting really wanted to try it.

The place is not cheap, but they offer a variety of burgers with clever names, including the Big Blue, with bleu cheese, that I had, onion rings, fries of different varieties including Buffalo fries (fries with Buffalo wing sauce - aka Frank's Red Hot sauce), and the Philly cheese fries, which came with cheese and thinly-sliced steak, onions, and peppers. I got the Philly fries. You can also get shakes, but I thought that would be overkill with the already heart-attack-risking meal I was eating there.  

The soda fountain is ""do it yourself,"" and they have pumps for ketchup, Buffalo wing sauce, and other sauces (BBQ, probably - I didn't look that closely). It's a little confusing, since the counter setup makes it look like customers shouldn't go there, and you should wait for an employee, but it quickly became clear to me that I was supposed to get my own drink (and I later saw a ""self service"" sign, and the employees all saw me getting my own drinks, etc.)..

I had a Groupon for $20 worth of food for $11 or $12, so the huge meal set me back about $7, including a $2-and-whatever-change tip, or $18 or $19, if you count the cost of the Groupon. The place would be a reasonably fair deal without the Groupon, but it's definitely better to look for a Groupon or other deal (Entertainment book, maybe?) before eating here.

The staff was friendly, and oh yeah, you can get ""dirty"" or ""wicked"" or whatever- they-called-them shakes with alcohol in them, and there's a full bar (No, that's not self-serve).  The alcoholic shakes all had clever names - the ""Dirty Sanchez"" on the menu stood out, since I was a little grossed out at the idea of something called that being in my mouth, not to mention the reference to a stupid young teenage boy myth/joke. But hey - it's Vegas - it's supposed to be ""edgy.""",jeggKHNp7TUEqTJYKiZycw,0,0,4,9MAhcVqkhghW3sdhwzEIIg

We ended up sitting at the bar and the turn time was pretty good. I ordered the morning glory burger and it was really good. Good size and didn't even need fries to get full. Had a tall beer that was a great compliment.

The price was a little high for the burger alone, but the taste was very good. The lady at the bar was super friendly and attentive (like you would expect for a bartender wanting a tip) there were a ton of different ketchup sauces to use for your burger.. Very creative and tasty. So of you are looking for a quick not too busy place to get a bite to eat this place fit the bill pretty well.",-F-XN_Vmg3DCKwSeRoxQcg,2,0,4,4W8fgFTLILyBsweRhaRpow

3860820,2015-03-16,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"I've been getting down at Ketchup regularly since I discovered it. Here you order and seat yourself until your food is delivered. I like that because I don't have to wait on a waitress to go back and forth from my drink to order and I don't have to get up to grab my food once I'm situated in my seat. They have a pretty good selection of burgers. They offer all sorts of substitution options including a vegetarian patty. Even with odd demands they've gotten them all correct so far so pat on the back to the cooks. I've tried a few different burgers so far and enjoyed them all. Their fries are pretty good too. They have those new touch screen soda fountains with more drink variants than I could mention but for starts all the classic soda, diet soda, and juice type drinks you could possibly need are available at the push of a button. I gotta say the cost to upgrade your burger, which does not include fries and drink, to a meal that does is a bit absurd. My will to eat there unfortunately cannot be supported by my ability to afford it as often as I'd like. I don't expect them to be inexpensive but for the price they are charging for these burgers I would hope fries on the side would be included. Between the food and the price the defining return factor is the customer service. I've been greeted by nothing but smiles and ""Welcome""s by counter staff and the lovely lady at the bar. I say they're on the right track to staying in business but I hope they make some small changes to their menu prices.",qRU7nYMJIV05lpKQq4jVjw,0,0,4,cX5u_us1M_09hLuuZlpQgw

I got the regular ketchup burger and it was okay at best. Along with it ordered onion rings and those weren't good. The dough from the onion rings wasn't crunchy all the way through, the parts closer to the interior tasted very bready which made the onion rings a lot less palatable. They come with a variety of different ketchup flavors but after a while they all started tasting like bad BBQ sauce.

This is just one of those places where I go in, and I know it's probably not going to be that great, but when I actually have it it ends up being worst than I imagined and overpriced to boot.",Iec0Qou1MH6zk7I4y_4nrA,4,0,2,IxzsD0d8gCHShDkqEq2EsA

The western burger was very bland barley had any bbq sauce in it. My wife crunchy Dog was the opposite it was very salty .

3974397,2014-07-06,11,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"The only thing premium about this place is the price they charge for their food.  I opted to go here to use a Groupon and because its location in the Miracle Mile Shops makes it an easy walk from the garage elevators to the restaurant for my wife.

I ordered two burgers--a mushroom and Swiss and a Western.  The mushroom and Swiss was supposed to be medium and the Western was to be rare.  With them, I ordered the soda/fries combo.  All that for a mere $36 including the $20 Groupon.

I went to the self serve area and got three flavors of ketchup.  I tried the balsamic ketchup, the maple bacon ketchup, and the fry sauce.  I also got our two iced teas and napkins.

The orders were brought and the mushroom Swiss was correct by burger was the wrong one so she took it back and eventually brought out a Western.  That's when my disappointment set it.  The burgers were larger and flatter than a hockey puck, but they were really lacking much flavor from the toppings.  They were also very, very dry.  I am a person who very rarely uses ketchup. I think it's a bastard food item meant to hide the taste of things on which it's spread.   When I put some on a burger, you know it's awfully dry and it needs something to make it taste better.  No luck.  It wasn't so dry, but the taste, oh it never was there.  The bacon on my Western was odd.  It was very tough although it had been cooked throughly.

There were a few things that made the experience tolerable.  I liked the women in their short shorts.  They looked quite fine.  The free wifi (well, I guess with the prices you should never refer to it as free wifi) worked well and was zippy.  Ask someone who works there for the password.  The wait for the burger was not long.  How did they overcook the meat that quickly to the point of desert dryness?  It's a puzzlement!  One more thing, the fries were good.

I realize I now have two rules for buying Groupons.  Rule #1:  Always check the Yelp reviews before buying.  Rule #2:  Don't forget Rule #1.  I guess I got to Rule #2 and didn't follow Rule #2.  Fool me once!

There are so many good burger places along the Strip, don't waste your time and money here.  It simply is not worth it.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,9,1,x8RxWH0ZR0GZk3WX7KaJ4g

I want to give this place higher than a 2-stars because the food wasn't bad but the service is awfully slow... someone help this one-man show working at the bar, please. It's not his fault, the place just wasn't adequately staffed. We placed our order at the bar. Everyone else working were cooks inside the kitchen, no one else tending the registers. Mind you, the place wasn't that full. We were supposed to grab a quick bite... it was nothing but. Maybe the slow service was just that day... hopefully it's not like that everyday! 

When we finally got to the counter we still had to wait till we can actually place our order. We already knew what we wanted since we had to wait awhile. We had more than enough time to look at the menu over and over. We decided on a Mushroom Swiss and Fries. The burger was delicious, fresh and juicy! Lots of grilled mushrooms and caramelized onions on top of certified angus beef patty, melted Swiss cheese and mayo. 

This burger joint is conveniently located inside the Miracle Mile Shops. As soon as you enter the mall from the parking garage structure it is immediately to your right. The prices are fair and they currently have a Groupon running which we used. The bar has 3 of 4 flat screen TV's. They have regular shakes and spiked ones too.

First and foremost, the evening staff SUCKS! It's as if everyone hates their job here, including the crappy manager, who I respectfully asked if they can replace the garlic ketchup. 

His response ""we only make enough ketchup to last the day"" 

How is your company named ""Ketchup PREMIUM Burger Bar"" but I have yet to see the premium, and the ketchup bar is 50% empty. Come on, quit your job if you can't provide good customer service. 

To the owner: you should expect a vast amount of foot traffic being at the entrance to the parking garage on a Friday night, but I see exactly why people go to the BURGR joint at the casino, who will wait in line for the extensive customer service. You should witness the staff for yourself and see why you're losing easy money in a hotel that's full of local and tourist shoppers. 

Waiter just walked up to me and gave me honesty by saying ""the girls in the back are very backed up but they can work on making more ketchup in a bit, I will let you know when they do"" 

I'll take honesty over a bull sh!t excuse that they only make enough sauce to last a day, on a flipping Friday dude. Come on. Lamest excuse ever from a MANAGER. 

AND THATS JUST A REVIEW FOR SERVICE.

The food: 
I got the loco moco. I love egg on my burgers, but even my wife agrees with her ketchup class burger that the food tastes rushed. I would rather have a nice drive thru burger from Wendy's than this joke.

Service was disappointing for numerous reasons. The girls who take your order not welcoming (it's your job whether you like it or not the least you could do is welcome your customers with a smile), they delivered the wrong order to our table three times, saw at least three of the servers do this to other tables as well (know what your customers order especially when there is only a handful), this blond server had the worst attitude tossed our fried pickles and rolled her eyes when I stated, ""No, I ordered the ketchup classic"" I gave her no attitude not sure why she felt it necessary to roll her eyes and walk away instead of apologizing.

The attire worn by the servers was unacceptable. I would not allow it in my establishment. The server had on shorts that looked like old worn out pajama shorts that clearly showed she had nothing under. Hooters should be their attire standard just so they have some sort of guideline. Those girls tend to have the appropriate coverage and much neater shorts.  

Enough about experience...

Food was bland. Buns, patty and fried pickles nothing special and not worth the $, although the ketchup was tasty I will not be returning. Fried pickles way better than the burger I'd give them a 6/10 still not enough to bring me back. Food looks great but the taste was overall disappointing.

We had just been at the Elite Event at Koi and were still hungry, so we decided to split a burger and some fries to finish the evening.  We split the Big Bleu, a burger with bacon, bleu cheese, and caramelized onions.  The bun was soft, but the patty was very overcooked.  No pink at all.  I pointed this out, noting that it was overcooked but it was fine, we'd eat it.  The bartender got us another burger without us asking for it.  She just had the kitchen wrap it up to take it home with us, which we appreciated.  

We also split the poutine, the rich French fry dish topped with brown gravy and cheese curds.  The gravy was solid in taste, but a little thin.  Had some issues adhering to the fries.  Also, I could have used more cheese curds.  In other versions of this dish there is a lot more cheese.  That being said, the salty fries went great with the brown gravy and cheese.  I'd get this again.

Of the flavored ketchups, my favorites were the hickory and the balsamic.  You could bottle that balsamic and I'd gladly pay for it.  These were interesting additions, and frankly, it's something I'm surprised more places haven't tried.  Maybe I'm just going to the wrong places...

Burger does not come with fries.
We got 2 burgers, 
Gordon Blue Burger: 12.05-w/out fries.
Buffalo chicken sandwich-12.30. 
(Comes with 2 piece of chicken tender on a bun, along with feta cheese, buffalo sauce, lettuce, & tomato)
I did not like the feta cheese!! -I'm not sure if this is a mistake? It doesn't go well together! 
I paid 4.00 more to make it a combo. 
The fries were small portions!! 
Over-all our burger was mediocre!!
The prices you pay for burger is not worth the price!! 

The 2 reason that I enjoy most about this place:
1. The soda machine, I call it the iPad soda machine, it's pretty cool dispensing the drinks. Just press the category and the type of drinks you would like and your drink will be ready. I got a Fanta Orange with sprite drink.
2. I like the concept of ketchup, this is why the place is called ketchup-premium. I like that there are many different flavored ketchup. Ex. Spiracha ketchup, hickory ketchup, buffalo ketchup.

I called the restaurant several times and they would promise to look into it and clear it up/refund any overcharge. However they blew us off, i stopped calling after my 3rd call to them.

It was easier to find than I thought. After you park the car and enter from the back, it's the first thing you see to your right.

We got there pretty late, around 8 or 9pm. There were two other tables being occupied, so it was dead. We walked up to the counter and put in our orders. There was a young teenage boy working the cashier and he was helpful. I asked about the different burgers and he explained them to me.

I chose the Big Bleu Burger and upgraded to a meal for $4.39 more, which came with fries and a drink. The hubby had the Ketchup Classic and subbed the beef patty for the chicken breast. My Big Bleu was so delicious! It was an angus beef patty, topped with bleu cheese, bacon, caramelized onion, and garlic aioli. I was going to put one of their fancy ketchups on it, but I didn't have to. It was perfect on its own.

The reason I wanted to try this place was because of all their different ketchups, hence the name. They have four ketchups to be exact with two sauces: buffalo sauce, fry sauce, hickory ketchup, balsamic ketchup, original ketchup, and sriracha ketchup.

The hickory ketchup had a burnt taste to it. The balsamic was sweet and the siriracha was spicy. My two favorites were the balsamic and the fry sauce. The fry sauce went great with the fries. It was like the Thousand Island dressing with a hint of sweetness to it.",sPbKpor4w91rp5Dw2EhIbw,16,10,4,4BL_n7fFiiI7j2LsemQRtw

5278333,2014-06-04,0,WEeMwRLhgCyO1b4kikVcuQ,"Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops and immediately accessible when arriving through the entrance from the parking garage. I bought a Groupon and ended up paying about $16 total for two people, so kuddos to the Ketchup Bar for letting me and the hubby enjoy an affordable dinner on the Strip. The Ketchup Premium Burger Bar is a casual burger fast food restaurant/sports bar. You walk right up to the front counter and place your order, then are handed a number and seat yourself. 

The food took longer than expected, but we amused ourselves in the meantime by watching highlights of the recent Heats game. When the food arrived, we were all disappointed to learn that our burgers did not come with cheese. I ordered the Veggie Burger ($11.99) and my husband ordered the Ketchup Burger (8.99). For those prices, I think we were justified in assuming the burgers would come with cheese. I really liked my burger- it was crisp on the outside and appeared to be made of a medley of veggies, a refreshing change from the usual black bean or Boca burgers. My husband and the other couple we were with, however, were not impressed with their burgers. They complained that it lacked flavor and was dry. Everyone agreed that the fries were awesome, though. The interesting ketchup flavors, like siracha and balsamic, made the fries even better. 

The customer service is minimal but agreeable. The only interaction you really have with employees is the cashier who takes your order. The cashier was super friendly. She waited patiently while I struggled to pull up my Groupon on my phone. When I told her the Internet service was being horrendously slow, she gave me the WiFi password and instantly fixed the problem.  

I would come back for a veggie burger, but my favorable opinion of the Ketchup Bar was overruled by the 3 other people I was with. Unless you have the Groupon deal, the steep prices are hard to justify. The pricey burgers do not come with fries or a drink, but to be fair everything is overpriced on the Strip.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,1,0,3,S-F2L82gLXEVM7S8AhCFUg

The poutine the worst I have ever had.
Fries, gravy and cheddar, where are the cheese curds? And I am missing the meat, they were lackluster gravy fries, still good, just by now means poutine.
Knowing that would be a meal in itself I went with a salad and added a veggie burger patty instead of getting the veggie burger itself.
Descent size salad, pretty good veggie patty, thick and loaded with veggies, fried nicely, though comes in frozen, not made in house.
The mac and cheese burger, huge and the best thing here. My husband had the hangover burger which he also enjoyed as well as the philly fries which were again not that great in quality.

That day came this weekend when we saw a sign at the sport's memorabilia shop across from Ketchup that said Mike Tyson was doing a meet a greet. We got there a bit early to scope it out, and since there was no lines, we looked for places to eat for lunch. Ketchup was the closest.

We ordered the LA Dog and Ketchup Classic Burger. For being a self proclaimed ""premium burger bar"", I was surprised they didn't ask how I wanted my burger cooked. I guess well done it is. 

Didn't get to try my bf's hotdog (he said it's fine), but my burger was surprising OK! They have a selection of flavored ketchups by the counter, and my burger went well with the garlic ketchup. Burgers were a good size for a quick lunch, but were pricey for foodcourt-like ambiance.

Service at the cashier was abysmal. The girl looked like she hated her job or we did something to offend her. We ordered in, and she didn't give us a number for our order (everyone else had one). I asked if we needed one and she gave me some random one off the counter with the blankest look on her face. OK? My apologies for trying to make your jobs easier.

Also, Mike Tyson was a no show for the meet and greet across from Ketchup. Just the cherry we needed to top off our mediocre experience at the Miracle Mile that day.

I've been here twice now and despite its excellent location just inside the main Miracle Mile Shops on the 3rd floor, each visit left me underwhelmed.

The fries came out almost right away, but the burger took about 15 minutes to get to me...even though I could see it sitting there, growing cold and lonely at the window behind the cash wrap.

To their credit, the guy felt awful for forgetting it and offered me a free item from the menu for the wait, but the burger was so off-putting (so much bread...) that I didn't even want to take him up on his offer. In fact, I actually felt nauseous for several hours after eating it. It just wasn't...good.

1. The pricing for the burgers do not include fries and a drink. However, you can upgrade any meal for an additional $3.99.

2. At the time of writing this review, they had a deal for $10.00 for a draft beer and their most basic burger.

3. There are MANY different types of ketchup (hence the name!). We tried every single type and we found that we really liked the Garlic ketchup.

4. The drinks that are served here used the new aged drink machines that offer many different choices!

5. The patties cannot be cooked to medium rare!

This place is located very close to the parking lot near the back of Planet Hollywood. I had no idea how very new this place was. A few of my friends and I were walking down and through the Miracle Mile shops and saw this place and decided to give it a try.

My girlfriend and I tried the Western Burger. It was basically a burger with bacon, cheese, and barbecue sauce. For the burger, we felt that the meat didn't seem to be seasoned enough. In fact, the barbecue sauce seemed to be very overpowering. The bacon was standard bacon that you could probably find in most restaurant burgers.

We also ordered the combo fries meal. The fries were pretty standard stuff, nothing really extraordinary. Just normal fries. The portion were good for sharing with another person. I think the star though is their different types of ketchup. We tried garlic ketchup, sriracha ketchup, hickory ketchup and, balsamic ketchup. They also offered Ranch as well as Fries sauce. By far, our favorite was the garlic ketchup. The rest of the different ketchups seem to not really vary in taste. What I mean is that the ketchup doesn't seem to add or subtract from the extra ingredient--sriracha ketchup tastes like sriracha, but a tiny bit sweeter.

The best part of the combo was the drink selection. They have the new coke machines with the multiple combinations. I tried peach flavored sprite! As for service, you order at the counter and then they bring you your food, not really much but they were pretty friendly.

All in all, the only problem I have with this place is that it seems pretty forgettable. When you have one of the best sandwich spots in Vegas just a few short minutes away (Earl's Sandwich), then you got to make your food really memorable. Still it is relatively cheap when compared to other Vegas options, and the lines are not out the door.

Still, I hope you try this new business out and let them know what you think!",Ao2X4BBYO8ibQE8_5Me6_g,1,1,3,_Zs7_hTr_0MAuUf4MSSiPA

Ketchup is a burger place that is good, but potentially could be great. First time I went, I had the breakfast burger. Patty was good, not top shelf and for a bacon connoisseur like me, they certainly could've stepped up their bacon game. Overall good, but a little lacking. 
I also recently discovered that they have a BOGO on hot dogs on Tuesday so I decided to give that a whirl one day. I had the crunch dog and the Vegas dog. The Vegas dog was basically a Costco hot dog with all the toppings, so good but  definitely not worth 7.50 but the crunch dog was a step up. It comes with bacon and onion crunch. As noted earlier, the bacon game needs to step up. This might sound weird but the onion crunch was too crunchy I don't know whether it's pre made or if the chef fries it but it was waaaay too crunchy. Less is more folks. 
Two things this place has going for it: location is perfect. It's right by the parking garage when you enter so they'll always have foot traffic. It's actually why I even tried them in the first place: I was heading home and hungry so I decided to try them out. 
The second thing they have going for them is their ketchup. I haven't even had the whole spectrum but I had the sriracha ketchup and the hickory ketchup and I loved them. That's something that I give them major props for that. 
Where I think they can improve is customer service. The staff always gives the impression of basically sleepwalking anytime I go there, maybe i just have bad luck. 
Another area of improvement would be to promote all the ketchup. Literally nobody that works there ever told me about them; I only discovered it accidentally when I wanted to get some ketchup for my friends fries. It would've been great to have been told about it, or possibly even given the option to have swapped out the regular ketchup for one of those on my hot dogs. It would've made a world of difference 
Overall, I think its ok but I'm not really in any rush to go back",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,3,1,3,YU-aWFgnNl0gikCLxm4Fsw

We just came into town, it was about 800F outside and we ran into the Tervis store to pick something up.  We bit the bullet and ate here.  I thought "" Oh, I'll get a salad"".  10.00 for lettuce, a few slices of onion and croutons with a very salty chicken breast.  It was like a salt lick, so, so bad.  I sent it back and got a grilled cheese.  2 slices of white bread with processed cheese slices.  Ate half, gave the rest to a homeless dude.  Onion rings were ok, kinda greasy.  Wife got a hotdog for 7.00.  This is Sysco food, straight off the truck.  Never again( and I mean it this time).",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,1,1,1,uauyXSAv1G4P-GaWo1pdvw

We did not have the correct answer to the troll-like cashiers riddle as she was just grumpy and like a lump on a log, she should definitely work somewhere without customer interaction. The man that delivered the food had a peppy personality and seemed like he actually worked there - small Saving grace for the place
Soda machine somehow broke while eating
Even with the slight buzz from the tasty strong spiked shake, the food was still dry and hard to choke down. Blue burger wasn't very ""blue""- luckily I was able to sneak the blue cheese of the hubs buffalo fries 
Hubs morning burger was -in his words- edible. Fries were crispy
Several ketchup flavors but nothing to ever bring us back. 
$60 for two to eat at an order yourself burger place?....I'll certainly keep walking by next time
Thanks groupon!",c5oYE9tK0Rb0lSUREw1lxQ,1,1,3,uczC-CO984Z7JODaosE6FQ

It was DELISH!  They had a bunch of choices from burgers to fries to the ketchup!  Different flavors, the hickory flavored one was our favorite!  The burgers were huge and juicy.  The onion rings were to die for!  Cooked perfectly!  The service was OK, the girl behind the bar was more interested in talking with her friend then serving us.  We will def be back here at some point!",B0KreC9vUrCaDVTm0KYm3Q,0,0,5,OkdOuxxoQP_COHebzxK5Kw
