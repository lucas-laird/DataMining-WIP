An employee, even a manager, I can forgive for such abysmal customer service, but I expect more from an owner. Imagine how he talks to his own employees!

I called to ask a simple question about my card being charged multiple times and he completely dismissed any wrongdoing at his end and COMMANDED me to call my bank. Well, I had already spoke with my credit card company and I also have experience working with credit card companies so I know he can call with his merchant id to take the hold off. Sure, he could have declined to call them because of laziness or whatnot and I would have totally accepted that and continued to frequent his establishment. BUT, I have never been spoken to so rudely by anyone... ever, and that is why I will never return and inform all my friends and family what a horrible man owns this franchise.

He actually tried to pick a fight with me over the phone. I am a very polite person and his yelling at me in a tone normally reserved for dogs and children had me so flustered that at one point I said meekly "" I can't believe you're being so..."" (The statement slipped out in surprise and I did not finish it because its not my manner to insult people). He yelled back ""I'm being so WHAT WHAT!"" I said ""you're being rude."" Then he started ranting at me with things like ""Me? Rude!?"" Finally, I had to just hang up on him as opposed to being verbally assaulted by a crazy man.

So my advice- stay as far as possible away from the owner of this place and the only way to assure that you will never have to interact with this incredibly unpleasant and unprofessional person is to NOT ORDER HERE.",EqfQNnhlBFAp3eamjnm0YQ,1,0,1,QVilX3nK5OxxB4PIhF8OSQ

Feeds up to 4 people. We have 3 adults in our household and we have leftover CheezyBread. PERFECT to kill the spicy pepperoni burn.

The cashier who rung up the order was a bit dry as far as conversation went and just very like I don't know tired or something? Anyways she told me briefly after I asked about the pizza sizes and the type that they offer with these particular coupons I had. After figuring out that the large pepperoni pizza with the cheesy bread for $15.99 seemed like a deal I went for it. Maybe 10-15 minutes later I went back inside to inquire about it and it was done! Score! I always check my pizza before leaving because you know who wants to eat burnt pizza or not have enough toppings. From what I saw everything checked out to look just fine.

The meat in the chicken and ground beef pizza met my standards: which is that they are juicy and taste good.  Both pizzas were not dry, but not overly wet as well.  It fell perfectly in the middle.

The ground beef pizza, AKA hamburger pizza, was a pleasant surprise.  I usually wouldn't order that kind of pizza but my wife got it knowing the children's taste buds.  I snuck a piece and it was delicious!

The grilled chicken pizza was very memorable.  I know for sure that if we're getting pizza from Marco's, one of them is going to be grilled chicken.

I know its a weird thing to complain about but I really think it would be nice to have a choice if you are going to sit down to eat there that you would be able to get some water that wasn't 25% of your meal price. 

Just for perspective the largest bill I had for a dinner was $780 at Del Friscos and the water was $0. 0% of my bill. The least expensive was 2 ramen noodle (creamy chicken flavor of course) packages with 2 eggs at a total cost of 47 cents.

4048065,2010-11-22,4,hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg,"I woke up early this morning craving some Zah and instead of waking and baking...I mean, taking a bio break upon waking, I got on Yelp to plan out my Pizza hunt strategy....(please note, I don't smoke the green, just trying to be funny here...)..

After some seriously focused review of research from our Yelpers I finalized my selection to Rosati's on Durango and Warm Springs but decided to wait until I got there to determine whether it was going to be deep dish or thin crust.  It's 7 AM and my day off so I had a protein shake to stave off the hunger driving my salty, chewy, crunchy, spicy desires and did my laundry....

After the final fold, I drove to Rosati's salivating at the prospect of satisfying my carnal urges...sorry, I mean, culinary desires.  I parked and pulled the keys out of the ignition in giddy anticipation of the flavor feast about to ensue in my mouth, dancing with my tongue, and filling my belly, but then, when I pulled the door handle at 1115 AM, it didn't budge.  LOCKED!?  The door was LOCKED!!!  WHAT!?!?!  The tinted glass prohibited my seeing that the store was EMPTY!!!   OH MAANNNN!!!  There was NOTHING in there.  The business was either doing a deep cleaning or didn't make it.  The fantasy dwindles and shrivels as I wondered where to go and what to do.  The only other Pizza palace I like is Rocco's but that's WAYYYY over on the other side of town from here.  I decided pizza could wait for another day and settled on sushi at Sumo's right around the corner on Warm Springs.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed Marco's, pulled out the Droid Incredible and opened up the Yelp app. Found Marco had four reviews and they weren't bad so I saddled up and gave them a go and ho, ho, ho, I'm so happy I did.  Whoa!

As the old saying goes, do not judge this book by it's cover.  Small with three table, I was wondering if the reviews were written by friends of the establishment, but I journeyed forth and stood resolute with the acceptance that this place may let me down like so many others had.   I was the only customer on site as I stepped up to the counter, uncertain as to what I should order.  A nice young lady jogged up to the counter to great me and just as she finished, the phone rang.  She excused herself, answered the phone in a professional manner and asked the person on the phone to hold.  Since I was clueless, I asked her to help the person on the phone.  Whoever was on the phone made a HUGE order of two large, three topping pies, a 20 Wing order, plus two liters of soda.  Things are looking up now.  I ordered the large Deluxe Uno...Chewy melted cheese, peppery pepperoni, savory sausage, REAL mushrooms, great green peppers, crunchy onions and extra cheese...I added green olives and jalapeños, plus I asked them to add the tomatoes and onions raw after the masterpiece has completed it's cooking process.

20 minutes later I was in the car driving home with a 10 pound mound of a fantastic looking pizza.  Hungry as a skinny dog outside a butcher shop, I opened the box and pulled out a slice.  It was hot and heavy!    Misti, I know you have a preference for pizza with a lot of ""stuff"" on it, well Miss, I dare to say, I thought of you while biting into this incredibly satisfying slice.  Perfectly warm, explosive flavors from the tomato sauce, pepperoni, sausage where you taste the anise, the crunch of fresh chopped onions, the chill and texture of ripe tomatoes and the CRUST!!!  Wow, that crust is good.  I don't usually eat the crust without putting some hot sauce on it, but this was good just plain.  Nice crust!

If I were with a group of friends and we wanted pizza, I'd highly suggest Marco's for take out.

On a side note, the bathroom was clean, the driver I encountered said hello to me on his way in and when he left, he said, ""Driver out"" and they responded, ""drive safe!"".  It was cool.

Just there wasn't a code of enter in the free cheesy bread so when I went to go pick up and to make another order.  The guy was cool about it but the girl snapped and said I can't combine discount.  She handled the flyer back to me and I said, I guess I won't be able to ever use that.  I told her she can toss it out. 
In my mind, I won't be coming back here.  Technically it's not combine, if it's a new order I'm placing in store.  Come on now, I just paid $29 for 2 pies.  Give me the dang free cheesy bread that's $5.

5304188,2016-12-10,0,hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg,"I have ordered pizzas from this place for several years, rebought our house in 2007 and I'm certain I found Marcos not that long after,or it feels that way at least.  I have always loved this place and rated it at 41/2 stars in my mind. However lately it's slipped a little, one lady on the phone was rude and I was put off by her approach. The pizzas seem to be more expensive now then when I used to order.  I wanted a Xl thin crust but was told they don't offer one so I asked what they would suggest and was told to order two large thin crust to equate to ordering a xl thin.  Made sense to me but the price was crazy.  I thought well Lesson learned never do that again.   My past few orders have had mistakes or missing the extra sauce or parmesan cheese. 
It just doesn't have that same service and value anymore.  I will say that all their drivers are super polite.   Always just very outgoing.",Ahdo2T-uQ-qO-6FM88M4mg,1,1,3,g3rBYtMdHiNkpev2gbzatA

My 5 yr old was about to partake when I found 3 hard black pieces of plastic that I bit into! I can't believe that my kids could have bit into this or swallow it. We ordered a few items but were so disgusted that we just returned everything!  My husband left to return the items because I don't want to be accused of consuming the items and not returning it all...we wouldn't want to eat anything else anyway. Such a disappointment and ruining of dinner and appetites! We will def NOT be ordering from here again...once is enough! Terrible!,zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,3,0,1,NWc33uy3Xe96sqxLJH2t8A

5653930,2018-04-13,0,hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg,"Oh my goodness I've never before experienced such lack of care in a business as I have with Marco's. 

The first pizza we ordered took over an hour to arrive and then when it did the driver brought the wrong order so he had to go back and get ours. In return for such a horrible experience they gifted us with free breadsticks with our next order. 

Fast forward to tonight...I have a sick toddler and needed dinner for my husband and I was in a bind with dinner for him & I so I told him to order Marcos and use the free bread stick coupon we had. 

He couldn't use the code online for the breadsticks...whatever no big deal. We still ordered the pizza. 

Our pizza was taking forever to come again and he called and a woman he spoke with over the phone said the driver would be there any minute now. 20 minutes pass and he calls again and speaks with someone else and that person said we had no order in the system but my husband had an order confirmation number from his online order. The person he spoke with didn't try to rectify the mess and only asked if we wanted to order the pizza. No apology for anything. Uhh the part that get my blood boiling is the woman he spoke with previously lied about the status of our order just to save face. 

Seriously, order from here if you want to be throughly disappointed and still have to go find pizza from somewhere else.",WnheFaHC4RyDNTf6scisyg,2,0,1,Dn77p9f_OQlgIBe2BdyzoQ

5790045,2014-04-21,0,hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg,"We have ordered delivery from Marco's a few times now,  and their pizza as well as customer service is fantastic.  The food is always consistent and the quality is spot on, especially for a chain establishment.  I didn't know until today's order,  You could have the crust seasoned.  We opted for both parmesan & garlic crust topping (offered at NO CHARGE! ) The delivery times are always before quoted. For instance,  today estimated time was 35 minutes.  24 minutes after ordering,  our doorbell rang,  and our professional pizza driver brings our complete order (I always order extra sauces, and Hut & game pieces never bring them,  excuses,  and I've already paid on card..., let's get back to Marco's) The pizzas had ample toppings,  no big bubbles, perfect crust and was piping hot!  Our family chef salad had tons of high quality meats & cheeses and crisp well seasoned house made croutons. We usually order the family deal,  instead of wings (our usual choice) we went with the chicken dippers. Those were small,  my kiddos liked them,  but for 10 quarter to half dollar size chicken nuggets,  I would suggest sticking to the wings. We are very happy with Marco's pizza and we'll continue to order from them. The pizza tastes fresh and are made with good ingredients and the dough is fresh and made in house.  Definitely look up a coupon,  there are plenty to be had. The people working the phones are polite and knowledgeable and are patient when you blank out or change your order.  Marco's,  keep up the quality & the great pizza!

Today's order was done through the online ordering system and again,  showed up perfect,  as ordered.  Since we had a coupon and knew exactly what we wanted, we tried out the online ordering system and again 5!",0TOEmw5vVKEx3lz-3AAaVQ,0,0,5,pgBHqizZkI1ZAwjo0dm9KA

5864011,2010-07-29,0,hrNIDao4XnOhrv7aaFehTg,"Received a coupon for a free 12"" 1 topping pizza in a mail flier.  So why not?  I ordered mine with Italian Sausage.

With a min $10 for delivery I guess I'll be picking up.  They are just a couple blocks away, so not a problem.  While they have 'Dining in', I'd advise against it.  It's a very small shop with just a couple tables and chairs.  Clearly not their preferred service.

The pizza looks good.  Pretty simple.  (It is just sausage.)  Not overly cheesy and the crust has a nice golden hue.  Not overly cooked nor under cooked.  So far so good.  The sausage isn't something I'd call home about.  Pretty simple.  Maybe they could add some Spicy Sausage to their menu?  The cheese is good.  No piles of oil forming over the pizza.  The sauce is really good.  I nice bit of flavor and spread thin.  This keeps the dough from getting soggy and limp.  A big plus there.  As for the dough.  Not bad, not bad at all.  I'm a big bread lover.  So it's important that the crust is good enough to eat.  And Marco's delivered here.  No need for crust enhancements here.

All in all I'd recommend Marco's for a quick pizza pick up.",wfx2G50lMeSK_kqcQqP0lw,2,0,4,VTM1WDW38hu1NqO9_xWeWQ

They immediately fixed it and even brought us an extra pizza, above and beyond considering it wasn't even their fault. I would give you guys 10 stars if I could.
