Perhaps it's because I'm from Boston, so I'm spoiled when it comes to fresh seafood, but I found it difficult to find any appetizing seafood here.
I started with the crab legs, which weren't bad, but were a bit stringy. I moved onto the cajan shrimp and calamari.. The shrimp wasn't edible, beyond fishy(YUCK!), the calamari was passable. Finally I made it to the lobster tails... ummm... I've had lobster countless times, I wouldn't call these lobster tails. They had a greyish tint, tasted like rubber, and left a very unsettling feeling in my stomach. 
Again, perhaps I'm spoiled by the fresh seafood of the east coast, or perhaps I was perturbed to have paid for a buffet of buffet pass, and paid an additional $15 for this seafood travesty, but I will not be back.",cwmozH0btTWP1a84TLoSJQ,5,1,2,YrFQk7ZNu0rYwBFkolj2BA

The selection was mediocre.  The crab legs were small, not that I would expect much more.  The overall selection of seafood was poor.  I would have liked to see more ""main stream"" dishes.  Their was not a lot of fish to choose from.  Halibut but no other white fish.  Shrimp were very small, like you could get at any other buffet in Vegas.  The lobster bisque tasted like it was made at a truck stop in Nebraska!

I was extremely disappointed. I was one of the first few people in line, so I was one of the first to get food and my first bite set the bar for the rest of the evening at this buffet. Everything I bit into was COLD. It tasted as if they saved the food from the night, hell the week before. After a few times around the Buffet and trying to find something decent of which there was nothing. I gave up and had some dessert which was probably the only food that was good. Even the shrimp still had that nasty brown line running down it and you know what that is. I honestly felt as if I was going to be sick. I worried about it for a few hours. My advice to anyone that enjoys to eat. Drive right on by this place and go directly to Caesars. I'm not trying to give them the business and they have some issues as well but for the $$ spent it's a way better deal and the food is really fresh and warm.",sFIrThbS_cABS6sN7Np8cw,0,0,1,9bnJOQmJekdtb0eBn-snCQ

Wynn & Carnival buffet is cheaper and also has seafood selection such as crab legs. The first time I ate there, it was amazing, king crab legs & decent size lobster. But this was three years ago, it's changed since that first experience. Another time we went to Vegas, my main objective was to go back to this buffet, but was a little disappointed. It was still good, crab legs delicious, but the lobster shrunk & the other variety of food was just okay. Just recently went back again 2 weeks ago and after eating felt it was just way too much money for the quality. Crab legs were delicious again but the line just to get to them was ridiculous. They should have two separate lines offering crab legs to minimize the long wait. Also, the lobster they offer is mixed with what looks like a bunch of leftovers from shrimp pieces & was not great. Rest of the selection was good but not great. For $45 a person, I expected better quality & seafood galore, but it just doesn't seem they are living up to the title of 'seafood buffet.'

this experience was even better than the 
last time.

My brother-in-law is a Diamond Club Member so we sat in the VIP section near  the gaming floor.

We were seated by the restaurant manager
Peter, who was very courteous and knowledgeable.  He suggested some special
order items and they were off the charts!

We had cut king crab legs with a special seasoning-excellent.

Jumbo prawns lightly breaded-excellent.

Crawfish with sweet and tender tails-excellent.

Mini scallops on a half shell, tasty and refined-excellent.

And at the end of our meal, after eating many fresh seafood items, we ended with seared ahi tuna that was beyond excellent.

Kudos to the chef.

So I would like to say a big THANK YOU to Peter for suggesting these special order items, to the chef for making them and to our server Brad for bringing them out to us and making us feel like VIP'S for the night.

67614,2015-05-13,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"OK, a couple things: I'm not a big fan of seafood and it wasn't my idea to come here; but, I do consider myself to be a connoisseur of Vegas buffets. I've been to nearly all of them, on and off the Strip. Village Buffet was one of the few I hadn't tried and I'm glad I got talked into trying it.

More disclosure: we're Diamond members of Total Rewards which makes almost any experience at one of Caesar's properties even more enjoyable. So, we entered through the VIP line and were seated right away in the Diamond/Seven Stars section of the dining room. 

We were greeted at our table straight away and offered beverages before we had a chance to get up and peruse the buffet line. Having taken care of that, I approached the offerings with some apprehension. As I said, I'm not a huge fan of seafood.

But, I was pleasantly surprised! First, the seafood selections are huge. Anyone can find something there. I do love the fried scallops and clam strips, as well as fried shrimp. All were excellent. Also, they have this BBQ chicken that's amazing--just the perfect mix of spicy and sweet. I did go back for more of that. At the other end, there's a selection of Asian choices. Those were wonderful, too. 

The service was delightful. Our server, Brad, kept the drinks full and brought us a selection of lobster tails (the other half loved that!). After dinner, we were offered coffee--an old-school, but classy touch. Usually, once we're done with dinner, we're ready to go. But, it had been such a nice dinner that we partook. Even the coffee was excellent. 

Village Seafood Buffet is priced similar to Bacchanal at Caesar's and The Buffet at Bellagio. And, I would say that it ranks right up there with those two (both are favorites). Will we be back? Definitely! I know Rio might be a bit out of the way, especially if you're staying on Las Vegas Blvd. But, it's worth the short trip over, especially if you love seafood and are looking for an outstanding dinner and awesome service.",lqwxk2ZGG1Q4YOvXz-XlGw,2,1,5,Rtq26kxzrLKiLNcnoh25xg
75718,2008-05-16,1,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"After deciding this would be my 1 buffet experience in Vegas, I determined I should go right before my drive home, since I'd likely be in a food-induced coma and unable to move for a few hours and take any touristy Vegas pictures without looking 8 months pregnant.  Good decision? Yes.

We got there at 3:45 - the buffet opens at 4, and there was already a line.  Luckily it moved fairly quickly, although it was pure torture to watch others digging into the mounds and mounds of cholesterolly goodness. Of course we copied everybody else and went straight for the crab legs, intent on filling ourselves up on these along with the other most expensive items in order to get our $ worth. Seriously, why pay $40 to eat rice or salad? WASTE OF STOMACH SPACE!! Well, the crab legs were delicious as expected, but honestly i ate a lot less than originally anticipated, bc they're a lot more time consuming to eat than the other dishes. We got coupons from some street guy for fresh steamed lobsters, which made up for about half the buffet cost in themselves. Other than that, they had these AMAZING things called 'lobster slipper tails' that sort of look and taste like jumbo shrimp, but with a hint of lobster. Accompanied by approximately 5 gallons of hot melted butter, I couldn't think of a better way to end my trip to Vegas! The dessert bar looked good, and the gelato was fair, but I only partook of them in moderation, since I actually had to drive home, instead of my boyfriend who could just sit in the passenger seat in a half-dazed state and b*tch about feeling morbidly obese for 3.5 hours.

Overall, I would definitely return w/ family or close friends, or a long term boyfriend, but not with anybody you're worried about making a good impression on. We were there for about 2 hours and spent about 1/3 of that time getting food, and 2/3 stuffing our pieholes.

...I kinda hate this place. Considering this buffet is known as THE SEAFOOD buffet, they should have came correct. I come to buffets TO EAT. The crab legs were tiny.  I didn't come to the Seafood Buffet for tiny crab legs that, mind you, AREN'T EVEN SPLIT OPEN.  On top of that, I had to ask my waitress for the tools that I could see everyone else around me using. It was a lot of work for a lil' crab meat. The lobster section looked like they took lobster tails and chopped them up in a dozen pieces. The shrimp was either deep fried or cocktail, hard to mess up. The sushi was amateur sushi...aka California Roll Heaven. They had lots of oysters. I will give them credit there.  Unfortunately, I'm not big on oysters. They had deep fried scallops, but unfortunately they didn't taste at all like scallops.

My two favorite things here:  
1)They had salmon nigiri...a ton of it.  I love raw salmon...to me, it tastes like butter! 
2)In the dessert area was a gelato section. I walked away double-fisting cups of PISTACHIO GELATO.  Victory was mine.

Yes they do have plenty of seafood as advertised. The steamed snow crab legs were great but the cold were just okay.  Crawfish were jokes, very watery taste with not much flavor, having a feeling they use frozen crawdads.  The garlic mussels were great but the garlic lobsters were very mushy.

Service was way sub par.  There were no server stopped by for about 15 minutes until a server(Kimberly) from another section came over to greet me.  Too bad Kimberly was not my server and I already prepaid 25% gratuity on top of dinner.

The staff was friendly, well trained and attentive. The food, however, was simply mediocre.

The headings posted above each station made little or no sense and only served as a source of amusement. The dishes in the ""Latin American"" section, for example, had absolutely nothing to do with Latin America. Having spent several years living in Chile and Argentina, and being married into a Chilean family, I'd like to think that I know a little something about cuisine from that part of the world. Sorry Village people...not even close! Chicken wings on a skewer don't make it a Brazilian churrascaria.
 
My real issue with this place is not the way they organize their spread or classify the fare; it is the lack of what Gordon Ramsey calls ""simple honest food"". Every fish dish was some sort of stewed or poached jumble. I was hoping to find a station where I could get an uncomplicated grilled piece of salmon or swordfish. No such luck, not a grill in sight. Everything was swimming in oil or had been boiled to death. Although I'm far from a pretentious LA foodie, I am no great fan of mushy Mahi Mahi.

The three varieties of crab legs (cold, steamed, and stir-fried) were little more than adequate. Of course that did not stop me from stoking my cholesterol count. The cold crab legs were split with few claws around. This, I'm willing to concede, might not be the restaurant's fault. Sometimes it is just the luck of the draw as to whom you get behind (cue the Guoyue music).  Seriously, after you Google it, don't get mad at that last statement. You know it's true. I'm just trying to be factual and objective here...but I digress. The steamed legs were of decent size, but not particularly tasty. The Chinese sweet and spicy wok-stirred crabs were the best. At least they had some flavor infused into them.

As for some of the other dishes, I'm sorry to report the pale elfin lobster was past its prime, completely over-cooked, and diminutive. By good fortune I remembered to bring my reading glasses. The Asian section made Panda Express look yummy.  And, the beef dishes were...well, let's just say, I think the cows died of old age. More than likely Village Seafood purchased the roast beef that the Palace Station and Circus Circus passed up as being too cheap and tough even for their customers.

I cannot comment on the oysters, clams, and other assortment of crustaceans that I didn't try other than to say that most in my family seemed to enjoy them very much and left a rather large debris field behind them as proof.

The highlights, aside from the excellent service, were, the sourdough rolls and the deserts. Several of the deserts were quite good, but the best of the best would have to be the gelato. I'm told they're homemade. They had about 10 different flavors. We sampled three of them at our table and each one was delightful.
 
Overall, none of us hated it...but the night is young. Hopefully I won't have to amend this review in the morning!",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,5,1,2,E4Z_UwyuqP60f0sp19fdXA

As for the food, I tried the following items:

 - Grilled Tuna: It was very dry and the sauce wasn't so fresh. 
 - Trout: It has hard to separate the meat from the skin and it was also dry. I suspect this was left over or made many, many hours earlier.
- Blacked Tilapia: This was one of the better items. It was spicy and cooked properly, if a little too dry for my taste.
- Crab Legs: Mostly low quality, hard to separate, flavorless
- Stuffed Clams - These were crusted over, as if they had been made a few days ago and then oven-heated. A bit dried out.
- Coca-Cola BBQ Ribs - I had to say, this was the best thing I tried at the seafood buffet. Slightly sweet, and very tender.

There isn't much as far as the seafood here that  I'd recommend. Overall, everything was very dry. However, the dessert options were a bright spot. The Green Tea Cheesecake was delightful and the Carrot Cakes were phenomenal. The Gelato assortment was also impressive.

The loster tails were insanely small, which made them look like some giant insects.  

Crab legs were not that fresh either, with the meat sticking to the shells, and some were tasteless while some were too salty.

Generally, everything was good. I hear the oysters were gross though and that was spat out immediately after trying to consume it. The service was good - the server was very diligent in clearing the table when the bucket was full of shells or trash, plates cleared readily, and was on top of refilling our drinks with all of the appropriate amenities (plenty of lemon for ice tea or range of sugar and cream for coffee drinkers). I appreciated his quick notice of my 1/2 cup of hot water that got luke warm and he quickly went and got me a new piping hot cup. :) I was a very content cookie. Speaking of dessert, the gelato (I tried the cookies and cream, pistachio, vanilla and I believe it was coffee, I couldn't tell) were not good. The mini souffle was cute, rich and pretty good. 

They didn't have KetelOne but had Grey Goose. 

Here's a tip! If you want lobster, you're not required to formally wait behind everyone who's waiting to fill their plate at the other stations. If it's clear, step on in to get your dibs on whatever it is you want.

I was not impressed by the desert section, and did not see a salad section, but I was only here for seafood.   Its about $40 pp if you have a rewards card, which I might add was not increased due to the fact we ate here on NYE 2012, which is cool, and was not overly busy which I don't like fighting through crowds.  Coming here on a very empty stomach after leaving the Bellagio after finding their power went out in the kitchen all afternoon on NYE 2012, the entire buffet was closed all day until evening (really, wow).   However, I was glad to find that this buffet had a great variety of seafood, rock lobster (or whatever the small ones are called), which are extremely easy to eat as the tails are cut in half.  They had snow, king, and stone crab.   I should add a day before I had Joe's stone crab, which for $42 you get 6 pieces of medium sized claws.   Well...  this night I had at least 20 claws!   Stone crab for me is rather rare, so I was very happy about this, although I still think snow crab is sweeter and is much easier to access.   Also the sashimi I had was outstanding.   No comment on desert or other stations, I didn't reserve stomach space for such things.   However, they were limited.  The coffee was quite good actually I do remember this.   Thanks for being OPEN and not loosing power like the bellagio during prime time lunch buffet.   If anyone complains that $40 is too expensive for a seafood buffet with various types of seafood, do you have any fkn idea how much stone crab costs to bring in?   Its generally brought in from Florida and even super wholesale will run $6 or more dockside, delivered to vegas you can bet at least $8-10 per pound.

The crab legs are the most popular thing here based on the number of bloated patrons with heaps of crab on their plates.  They use Snow Crab which is Opilio for you Deadliest Catch fans.  It's OK, but far from yummy like Red King or Bairdi.  They're served on ice or hot, but the ones on ice are watery and bland and the hot ones are a little tastier, but dry from sitting under a heat lamp.  A disappointing thumbs down!

Aside from crab, they have buffet staples like fried shrimp and clams,  a bevy of regionally inspired dishes (Mediterranean, Asia, Southwest, etc.), raw oysters, sushi, a meat station and a desert station with a wheel of ice cream and various mini-treats.  Sadly, none of it was any good and I found myself picking at everything as opposed to finding something I really liked.  Also, they do serve ""lobster"", but it's not what you think.  It's squat lobster which kind of looks like a miniature lobster in shape, but that's where the comparison ends.  It's not very tasty and why you find these critters in pasta or stir fried to make them appetizing...don't let the name fool you!

Anyway, for $45 it was a real let down that night.  I really wanted to like VSB, but there was honestly nothing there that was worth what they were charging.

I am usually the one that forces my party to go there, but, that wont be the case in the future. 

These were my reasons for disappointment:

Its seafood so I will expect FRESHNESS!

The fresh oysters on the half shell were tiny and did NOT taste fresh. The sashimi looked great, but it was WARM...ewwww gross...and flavorless. The TINY lobster tails looked like crawfish, were rubbery and salty. The crab legs were tiny as well, and they were also salty and too much trouble for what they were worth.

Ok, they do have a few good things--non seafood items--but they are things you can get at ANY other buffet in Vegas for half the price. They have decent prime rib. And, their desserts are good.

I really appreciated how there were corn dogs for the kids and grilled cheese sandwiches. Even though I don't have kids, it shows that they are considering all age ranges, not just adults. 

The deserts were also delicious. (However, Harrah's buffet was better. That is based on the fact that they made in-house blue and pink cotton candy though.) There was also 5 types of gelato. 

There was plenty of seating. I tried dishes I had never even heard of before and the drinks were included. I got to drink pure, grapefruit juice. A definite plus!

They also had happy hour specials every half hour at the bar!

My boyfriend and I arrived at 3:30, the buffet was priced at $22. However, right before that, we joined the player's club, so we got $3 off each. They also gave us $5 in free slot play which I did not get at any other casino. So we each got into the buffet for $19, and dinner started at 4:00, when the crab legs came out.

Good things:
Service was great - very friendly people and drinks refilled constantly.
Lots to pick from
Dessert - wow!!! their new york cheesecake and creme brulee was devine!
Lobster mac & cheese - delicious
Lobster bisque & clam chowder - both were really good

Biggest complaints: 
there were NO lobster tails - Not sure if they only put them out on certain nights, but bummed that there weren't any when we were there, yet other yelp reviews have people raving about them.  The only actual 'lobster' that was out was what they called a lobster medley with small pieces of lobster in the shell.  These tasted ok, but were supposed to be warm, but were barely lukewarm, making it a bit odd.

crab legs weren't good. they were cold, which was fine, but seemed as if they'd been soaked in water for a long time so the crab itself was completely mushy.  I've had better crab at red lobster if that's any indication

And what I mean seafood is fresh seafood with the taste of the actual food with either zero or minimum extra sauce to distract their true flavors.  So when I go to a seafood buffet I am comparing the experience to a Todai seafood buffet or even something that is experienced in Taiwan.

This is the very first buffet in Vegas that I went on this trip, Spring 2010.  I read about Belagio being the best but Rio has the best seafood, so I went.  

First this is dinner only buffet, I believe.  I arrived around 4 on the Easter Sunday and got in after a couple people in front of us.  We, two of us, would love to have a big table, like one for 4.  They did not give us one, saying that there is no waiter till 5 pm.  Then we were moved to a small one near the entrance, and finally we requested to move again and got to seat away from the entrance but still a small table.  This is probably a typical Vegas arrangement but we were not happy not getting a big table.  

I have high expectation of this place, and things were not going as well as we like already.

Next Do NOT order hot green tea for drink.  We received hot water in a cup with a tea bag.  This is not up to the standard of any quality green tea.  So I ordered the wrong drink in this western restaurant.

We started with some salad.  Right, we do not come to a seafood restaurant to have salad but I still expect the salad to be fresh and of good quality.  Well, no.  We tried some Ceasar and Spinach salad and I would say they were not up to standard.  Some of the spinach leaves were so bad looking we did not eat them.

The selection was good.  The sushi selection was weak.  If you expect Todai selection, go to Todai.  

The snow crab leg was good.  There were at least two types of oysters there.  I would say visually they did not look fresh, meaning shiny.. but they actually tasted good.  
  
There are other dishes that are decent but not extraordinary.  Desserts were good.

The atmosphere was more like a fast food American restaurant with top 40, classic rock, generally fast party music but not for food enjoyment.

For overall value, and enjoyment I would say the place is overrated and I would not go back again for the $38 dinner.  If you love and know seafood, I would recommend Todai.  If you think seafood is something exotic and want to sample different types of seafood around the globe, perhaps you would enjoy Rio's seafood buffet.

I would recommend getting the Oysters and Scallops - fresh and delicious! My favorite things on the bar. Sashimi was always constantly being refilled and was fresh - just random uneven cuts though. (Probably need a better sushi chef). Everything else was really good to meh.

A quick run down: 
- Smaller sized oysters that get refilled often! 
- Smaller crab legs than other places - still pretty good in my opinion. 
- Lots of crawfish selection from cold to Cajun to sweet & spicy (Cajun was the best) 
- Small lobster tails mixed in with prawns & another time of lobster? Shrimp? People would only pick out the red lobster tails and leave the rest.
- I really liked their dumplings, eggrolls & what not. A nice surprise! Plus the sesame seed balls. 
- Dessert!! Smaller dessert section but the creme brûlée, tiramisu, & gelato are delicious. 
- Soups were just ok.

But before I continue, do yourselves a favor and always sort Yelp reviews by date so you can see what the latest and greatest word is at a restaurant. With that being said, you will notice I am not the only one that has noticed the tumbling quality of this restaurant recently.

Living in central CA, this restaurant used to be the reason my wife and I visited Vegas. All-you-can-eat lobster: so awesome! But wait, they're not really lobsters, they're langostinos: a different breed and much smaller. Despite that, my wife and I still got behind this restaurant as we still enjoyed the taste of them. But in my most recent visit, I can no longer say this. Before I get to that, it is worth mentioning that the one serving station for these morsels is now mixed in with jumbo prawn shrimp (which, sadly, tasted better), so there's less of it to go around. Anyway, when I began to eat a couple of these mini tails, I had to immediately spit them out. They tasted like they were old and rancid, plus the texture was mushier than some of the other tails that tasted OK. And I am no picky eater by a mile! How can a restaurant get away with serving this? And on a Saturday evening? Wow.

Sure, there are other items that taste alright like the prime rib, snow crab legs, and dessert, but if you're coming here for those items, save yourself the trouble and go to the Bacchanal at Caesar's instead, where at least the crab legs are already split in half to save you the trouble of cracking through the shell.

Like most people, I was drawn here by the promise of lobster and crab on a buffet. There's a lot of other good food on the Village roster, but if you're going for the crab and lobster, you should know that the lobster are some kind of mini lobster I'm guessing caught by the Keebler elves on a fishing trip.  Sorry. Actually, i didn't mind that they were small. There was at least one good sized bite of lobster in each split tail and they were easy to remove meat from shell. The lobster didn't have a good flavor at all. Many were over cooked. It almost felt like they prepared them to be good enough to taste somewhat like lobster, but not so good that people would want to eat tons. If your passion is lobster, you'll be disappointed i think. 

If you love crab, like I love crab, you should be very happy. It's snow crab, so you'll have to work for it, but the flavor was great. i would have come just for the crab. I would go back for more. The desserts were also very good. A full Gelato bar, etc. 
I gave them a 3 because i think if you're going to offer something, that you know will be a primary draw, you should make the effort to make sure it's at least passable in quality. Still loved the crab. What a magical beast they are!

A side note about ""All you can eat venues"": Every time I eat ""all i can eat"" I end up eating exactly that; all that I can humanly eat. Never all that I should eat, but all that I can.

As our car pulled up to the restaurant, my mouth would start watering in anticipation of the fresh oysters and clams along with steamed lobster served with drawn butter that I would soon be enjoying. Sadly, as most restaurants do, it eventually went out of business.

Twenty years later, I found myself in Rio in a line presumably filled with other seafood lovers.  Childhood memories of glorious seafood feasts past went racing through my head as we approached the cashier.  I eagerly counted out forty-one one dollar bills and we were soon led to our table.  I ordered a beer and raced to the line and plucked up a plate full of crab legs,oysters, and clams.

Alas, the good times ended right there.  As soon as I put the first clam into my mouth, I noticed that it lacked any discernable taste.  The second and third ones didn't taste any better.  I then tried the oysters and discovered they tasted no better than the ones that come in supermarket jars.  The crab legs were decent but it was pretty obvious that most of the so-called fresh seafood had previously been frozen.  

When you factor in the price, which is similar to the superior Wynn Buffet, along with the tacky decor, you will probably come to the conclusion that the Village Seafood Buffet is definitely overrated.  I realize that quality of food served at buffets is usually not up to par with that of traditional restaurants but still I expected a lot more from VSF in terms of quality.

I really think they are langostinos. They are split and the meat is about the size of your thumb. Aside from that, they were mealy and overcooked. I only had the initial 2 and didn't go back. Fried shrimp/oysters/calimari/scallops. Sounds good, but all over breaded and over fried. Fried oysters should not be crunchy. All of the fish dishes suffered the same overcookedness. Love crawdads. Theirs were small about the size of a pencil eraser.

I was excited to see steamed clams. My favorite. Problem is that the steam trays are two rows deep, and there are heat lamps under the guards, so every time you try and reach something in the back row, it's blazing hot and hard to reach. I almost had to stick my head in and under the guard to get to them and only got a few. Too hot. They were absolutely tasteless. I didn't think that was possible.

I will say that my husband and I have no problem paying $50 per person if the food is worth it (we would be paying more if we went to a high end steak house) but I feel they are letting the quality & selection of their seafood slip a bit.

The 1st time we went to this buffet my husband LITERALLY ate about 5 plates of crab legs and lobster tails.  They tasted so fresh he could not get enough.  The last time we went (about a week ago) he only ate 1 plate of crab legs (he didn't even finish them) because he said they were cold and seemed like they had been sitting for awhile, and 1 plate of lobster tails.  He said the lobster tasted fresher than the crab legs but just wasn't as good as he remembered.

The selection also has changed.  There used to be about 5 different types of crab legs & lobster tails to pick from, now there are only 2.  You would think with less to choose from that they would stay hot and fresh but they are not.  Maybe it's the time of day we went (around 4pm) but they seemed to be busy.

I will say they added some type of Chinese noodles to their buffet and my husband and I both enjoyed those.  Their fried clam strips were perfect and their gelato was scrumptious.

Oh and as for the ""lobsters"" they are those tiny ones you see a lot in buffets, which I don't think it really qualifies as lobsters but it tastes good haha.  What are they anyways?  

Most of the other seafood items are either grilled or fried, and with the majority of that fried.  They have a lot of other items such as Asian, Italian, or Mexican.  It's not expertly done but it gets the job done.

Dessert selection isn't bad and I'm a sucker for creme brulee so if they have it, then it's a plus haha.  Delicious gelato as well, and it is just fun to watch them spin the machine to the right flavors so they can serve you.

I probably wouldn't pay the $40ish to come here since I think there are better buffets around but for seafood lovers, it's a good spot.",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,1,1,3,1i6j7-1JKE2KU4zrdaYesQ

The crab legs were absolutely nothing to write home about-- i've had better at seafood dive bars in chicago.  The crab meat was small, and sour/juicy. Not sweet and succulent  AT ALL.  Huge disappointment.

On the hunt for the lobster tails, all we found was this concocted stew-like mix of mystery seafood meat. Brownish, bland, and not very flavorful filled with shrimp, lobster tails, and i couldn't tell you what else. But the lobster tails were EXTREMELY overcooked. Chewy, inedible, and oversalted. I've never done this in my life. I felt wrong to do it. But it was so bad, I wasted 2 or 3 lobster tails.  I mean really. If you're gonna kill everything that's good in a lobster, just freakin steam it and serve it with some butter and call it a day.

Everything else there was just forgettable. Even the raw oysters were small, meager, and tasteless.

Had it not been for the buffet of buffet pass we had, i couldn't imagine dishing $40 for this place.

1208700,2009-07-16,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"This was a splurge night choice of a restaurant. It won't be a slurge again, mainly because I don't think I'll be able to convince my husband to go again. 

We went at 5:30pm last Saturday. This was the perfect time to go because there was no line yet. Turns out the line begins to form around 6:30ish. Anyway, I digress...

My experience: I had no problem finding things to try and eat. Nothing was really amazing or shouted out ""I want more!"". The food was just okay, although there was this spinach/feta/mushroom salad that was good. The dessert selection looked good but only the mini cheesecake was really good. The gelato was too icey for gelato if that makes any sense and not really that good. Believe me- I know gelato after living in Italy for 3 years. All said- it was just okay. 

My husband's experience:  ""Horrible & Never again"" to use his words. Main reason for this complaint... my husband loves his shrimp cocktail. He had to wait in long lines to get to this shrimp (and other shell fish). It grossed him out because there would be people in line waiting as well, eating off their plates. Also, both times he went back to get refills on the shrimp, the shrimp itself was still too frozen to eat. 

Here is what's wrong with buffet...the stations are set up wrong. The main attraction for this restaurant is the shelled fish (shrimp, mussels, clams, crab legs). The locations (there are two) of these stations is not very convenient nor well set up for traffic flow. Long lines form because the stations are in cramped areas in between larger stations that most people skip anyway to go to the shelled fish. 

People end up waiting in the long lines for the shelled fish and in the end, might not be worth the wait. Imagine waiting 10 minutes in line only get finally get to the station and then having to wait another 5 minutes while they replenish the food. Also, just imagine other people standing in line, eating off their plates, while along side other food stations. Not very clean (nor good manners). 

Suggestion: make the bar smaller since most people drink either soda or water, move the meat station (which is really nothing more than roasted beef and sausage) to a smaller station. Move the shelled fish to the larger more open stations. 

The good note: our ""server"" was very attentive about refilling our drinks and clearing our basket as it filled with the shells.",KBrv0-tU2YlDJPOD_BTjcw,0,0,2,lvOHMoXn-7UWn3wfAPavzQ

The second time we went, we found out a little secret. If you get their player's card and have a Nevada I.D. you get a $25% discount. It only cost us around $65, so if you are a local, take advantage of the discount.

My wife loves crab legs and they have tons of them. They serve both hot and cold crab legs. I'm not a fan of crab legs because the shells get in my way and I don't think the work is worth the reward, but that's just me.

1312077,2009-01-12,3,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"Admittedly, I'm nearing the end of maximum buffet capacity as I age into my mid-30's, meaning the appeal of impersonating a human version of a foie gras force fed goose is quickly waning faster than a 68 year old man's erection. That, and my proficiency for converting large amounts of food into rude amounts of byproduct is normally deterrent enough to prevent any gluttonous inclinations. 

EXCEPT when I find myself in Las Vegas, where I seemingly always find myself reenacting Michael Corleone's sentiment: ""Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in! ""

In comparison to my last foray into the realm of gastronomic excess known as the Las Vegas buffet, the Village Seafood Buffet is a more humble option to the Bellagio's all you can eat spread that I last conquered in Conan-esque fashion (3 plates with not one ounce of vegetable matter, not surprisingly horrifying my vegetarian girlfriend when I ate my age in BBQ ribs years back). Rio's Village Seafood Buffet promises heaping piles of King Crab legs, raw oysters, various sushi, cooked shrimp, alongside others dishes that span the global flavours of the Middle East, to Mexico, to China/Japan and occasionally even into the skimpy-attired borders of Hooters-ville (the land where all good food is fried food).

Avoiding the pitfalls of typical all-you-can eat deals, the King Crab legs and rock crab claws were surprisingly flavourful and mostly devoid of the excess salinity that mars most buffets; if you particularly like these seafood choices and are capable of eating several plates of these aquatic arachnid parts, you might find the buffet worth the money. In fact, I spied a notable amount of the dining room's patrons with plates singularly piled with only crab appendages, communicating the quality of the particular offering. On the other hand the raw oysters reminded me of a real life autopsy of a human being's eyeball offered on a half shell; a gray, flaccid, watery mass that didn't do much to excite the taste buds and worried me enough to limit my intake to a single slurp followed by an immediate return to the belief in the power of prayer. The worst though were the overcooked, tough and slightly unappetizing looking (because squished eyeballs weren't bad enough) slipper lobster tails; possibly cooked by  H.R. Geiger himself, this culinary crime against nature is stacked en masse in a broth with a strong resemblance to used laundry water...yet I ate two in sheer stubborn stupidity hoping I'd get over the yuck factor and love the taste of laundry water. Skip the slipper lobster tails unless you're looking for a chew toy that looks like the underside of a pillbug and tastes no better.

Laid out neatly, sushi rolls and nigiri are standard buffet fair and easy to devour in multitudes (which I did), but it was really the hot food options in the Chinese food section, notably their steamed dumplings, noodles and braised Chinese string beans that I enjoyed the most.  At the same time the rubbery sliced steak station might be a good way to loosen a tooth if you have a child looking to cash in with the Tooth Fairy, characterized with a taste that can only be described as ""interesting"". Overall, besides the ethnic tinged dishes, the overwhelming characteristic of this buffet is a blandness that is neither notably offensive nor memorable.

Leave yourself room for a creme brulee, a slice of chocolate mousse cake and some gelato/ice cream which is dispensed from a contraption that looks like an angled wheel of lactose misfortune manned by an octarian who scoops the most miniscule amounts of chilled sweets. They're not bad at all, if markedly more flavourful than the entrees that preceded them during our hour stay. Also, be sure to download the free upgrade coupon from the Rio Casino website; you'll be rewarded with a silver dollar sized filet mignon Oscar with grilled shrimp and asparagus true to its ""petite"" advertisement.

Seafood lover's heaven? Perhaps if your expectations land somewhere near the realm of Red Lobster territory. Otherwise at best, Village Seafood Buffet doesn't seem any better than the multitude of all-you-can eat seafood buffets in any metropolitan city bigger than Bakerfield. Because of the price and the limited selection of actual seafood worth eating in vast quantities (or eating at all), you'd be better off using that money at one of the finer dining establishments in LV that promotes quality over quantity or wandering over to the roulette table and always betting on black like that wise tax-evading sage once professed.",qYIOL0vFSIgRLzgyJ1VSwg,3,2,2,azmRXWQYqFQNMMtu11n4IQ

I only have 2 complaints about our dinning. First, Im not sure if that was actually lobster.... It looked and tasted a lot like jumbo shrimp.... I was able to tell by the color, taste, size, and the tail. Second, there was a little girl (probably around 10) who had at least over 50 pieces of ""lobster"" on her plate with no adult with her. The lady in front of me asked her if she was really gonna eat all that and she said yes. I know at buffets they don't have limits on how much you can get, but c'mon a 10 yr old girl is really gonna eat that much!? AND she knew exactly how to pick them and literally emptied out the tray. Later my hubby saw she had gotten them for her family and all the adults were eating them. We suspected they probably sent her to get all those because they wont say anything to a child.

they've remodeled in the past couple of years, and it looks brighter and nicer.

for seafood buffets, it's kind of hit or miss.  We went in mid-late October, and the seafood was awesome.

the crab legs (they look like snow crab legs) were sweet and meaty.  sometimes snow crabs at buffets are dried out and flavorless, but not the case here.

they also had crab claws which were also very sweet (i've had my share of horrible crab claws).  the ""er"" months (september, october, november, december) are traditionally known as crab season, so maybe we hit the right time.

To keep it brief, the seafood should be the star of the show here, but I found it hardly better in quality than my local AYCE Asian food restaurant. The sashimi/sushi was nothing to rave about--some pieces were not even fresh. The oysters were so small in size, it felt like I had to eat about 5 to get a decent size worth. Add to that they tasted very poor in quality. Nothing special. Most people were lining up for the crab legs (which I think you can get pretty much anywhere at LV buffets these days) and the lobster tails (which again, seemed a bit off in quality). The lobster was mixed in with all these other seafoods I think to detract your attention from how sucky the lobster really were.

The line to get into the restaurant is ridiculous and even after you get in, you'll have to wait in another outrageous line to get food. They don't have great food to accompany your seafood at all either. If I had gone here for my first ever seafood experience, I would definitely be turned off by seafood. By dessert time, I wasn't even impressed with the selection. My gelato tasted like peach lotion. 

I really didn't get my money's worth. To pay for the cab to get to this buffet and back + the actual cost does not add up to the experience I actually had. On top of that, the first thing I did when I got back to my room was use the restroom and sleep right after (mind you it was only 11:00 pm in VEGAS).

Since their  recent remodel, they've increased the cost, but there are some $10 off coupons floating around, so you can still pay about $30.  I'm a huge fan of seafood, and love crab legs, lobster, and oysters, and this buffet has ALL of it.  They also have sushi and other non-seafood dishes for those that don't really like seafood.  Although, if you really don't like seafood, I don't recommend this buffet since you're paying an awful lot of money for regular food.  Their double fudge brownies are to DIE for and they have a prety good selection of gelato.

Love was undeniably in the air as there were at least three newly wed couples and accompanying wedding parties scarfing down crab with their little bibs on. And that same love in the air gave me superhuman strength to consume more food than I've ever eaten in one sitting, I think. Nothing comes between me and food. Not a thing.

Our motto for the meal was ""let's eat crab until we shit GREEN!"" If you really want to know, it never happened, but damn, even I was surprised. I ate, ate and ate, until my chest felt heavy and I struggled to breathe.

But really, this a fun buffet for the sometimes necessary cheesy VEGAS careless indulgence/ridiculous consumption binge where you can pig out on not only seafood (chilled and steamed crab legs, mini lobster tails, shrimp cocktail, crawfish, clams, paella, etc.), but also dim sum, Italian-American and Chinese-American dishes, sushi, carved meats and normal buffet faire such as salad, rolls, soup, pasta, steamed veggies and dessert. I think we cleared out 8 plates of crab legs and a plate of shrimp cocktail each individually, so you know you'll get your moneys worth if you have an appetite cooked up. Honestly, I'm sure it could be missed since there are so many other buffet options in Vegas, however the Rio is kind of corny and fun with the Chippendales Show (tempting) right upstairs and the regular Mardi Gras float shows around the casino.",4pzr6KuS85859EICMI7MDw,1,1,3,AIOoK2SD8aFzWrTthQlSqQ

I am a seafood snob. Hailing from Florida and living in San Diego, seafood is a way of life. Las Vegas, NV...well since it's shipped into the desert it just isn't the same. It's not quite fresh. It doesn't taste great and when you can't even crack the crabs open to retrieve the meat, it ain't because you don't know how to use a crab cracker. The shrimp were small and unimpressive. The cocktail sauce was runny and this place is just getting by on a gimmick. 

Yes, there is quite a selection, however, the food is a bit bland, for instance the prime rib. Just not impressive. The sushi was so-so. I did add a star for the dessert and gelato area. The desserts and gelato were quite good, and that was the best part of the meal.

Also, they told us that for our party members who showed late they either had to sit in another section of the restaurant or we'd have to pay a mandatory 15% gratuity on our bill. Ummmm, they screwed themselves since we would've paid 20% either way, but definitely not cool. (We weren't a group. We paid separately on our way in rather than 12 people on one ticket which comprises a group and a mandatory 15% gratuitity. We just sat together.

1902126,2015-09-10,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"The Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio is one of the premier seafood buffets on or near the strip.  However, it tops the price chart and fails to deliver in a few key areas.

First of all, the buffet is very conveniently located and part of a much bigger casino property that you could nearly spend an entire weekend exploring and eating at.

That said, the cost of entry to the Village buffet is just shy of $50 per person!  Some discounts are available via coupons or players club affiliations, but it's a pricey eating venture regardless.  I have experienced subjectively better buffets at much better prices at other parts of the strip and also just off the strip.

Now, to be fair, you do get a lot for your money.  There is a wide variety of both seafood and non-seafood items available and the buffet is laid out in different stations with each station having a specific theme or style of cuisine.

You can find fresh baked crab legs, creole shrimp, clam chowder, fried fish, cajun crawdads, baja shrimp tacos and much, much more.

There is also a salad and desert bar portion, but you probably won't feel like either of those if you're doing this buffet ""right"" :)

My biggest complaints were in the preparations of the food.  I found that many times the baked and fried fish dishes were terribly dry and wouldn't release from the skin.  Their filleted shrimp skewers were also severely overcooked and impossible to chew because they were so tough.  The ""tamales"" were dried out and gross and the enchiladas from the Baja section were pretty much just tortillas smothered in cheese sauce like you'd put on your movie theater nachos.  Elements like that sort of ""cheapened"" the experienced for me.  

Some of the ""hot"" items could used to have been kept warmer and some of the ""cold"" items colder, as well.

All in all, however, you are sure to get your fill one way or another at the Village Seafood Buffet!

- sushi/sashimi station, the rolls were nothing special, but i wasn't expecting much.  The sashimi was surprisingly good considering the buffet format, i suspect because it's so popular they cut it and turn it over quite quickly.

- price!  $40 is too much for this buffet, for good crab legs i could definitely find something on the strip for $10 or more cheaper.
- calamari, not sure how they found squid so small, these were very tiny and not very good.
- cheesecake bottom layer was his sicky sweet syrup that ruined the flavour of the cheesecake.

If you're looking to shell out $40 on a buffet I think the Wynn is a better option, and if you're looking to save a few bucks try out the regular rio (non-seafood) buffet.

My boyfriend said he enjoyed the fish but I thought the shrimp dishes were seriously lacking. I even thought I ate a bad shrimp and got sick immediately after leaving. There was a small selection of Chinese food but the lomain was way too greasy and the fried foods were overcooked. I was sad I wasn't feeling well because the dessert portion looked pretty good. I did have one bite of gelato and that was delicious but I just couldn't eat anything really after that one bad shrimp.

Why give it a two star buffet when you should have known what to expect when you came in.  Anyway, back to my review.  The lobster, although small are excellent.  The crab legs were perfect.

The first thing I had was the sushi. I'm not even really complaining here. Sushi at a buffet, you get what you get. Not overly fresh tasting, but a decent variety to choose from. I always tell people I didn't even realize they had anything other than crab legs and lobster tails. I did look around, and there is a good variety of food. I still stuck with the crab and lobster though.
The crab leg were VERY salty, too salty in my opinion. Another feature of the crab legs that really upset me was that they scored each piece with a saw. I realize this made it easier to break apart, bit it also cut the meat and made it more difficult to extract from the shell. I was not happy about this.
Now on to the lobster tails. There were various sizes to choose from. They were all in a big pan. Some were split in half down the middle, these were the larger ones. They smaller tails had their shell sliced down the middle, making it easier to open. There were some of the tails that were mushy. It was rather nasty. The drawn butter was nice. They had plain butter, garlic butter, and chipolte butter. All very good. 
The desserts were decent. I only had the creme brulee, which was good.

Oysters meeeehhh... I wish they would have restocked it because the oysters they had out there were a bit gross looking... and mutulated. Hahaha I love oysters, but the one I had was so-so :(
The lobster I had was cut in half and fried with a bunch of other stuff, it was okkkkk. The lobster was overcooked, very tough and dry, but that hot butter made it alllll better ;)

I was so happy this buffet had chocolate mousse and creme brulee! My two favorite desserts in the same place!! I think they had a gelato/sorbetto station too, but I didn't get a chance to try that out.

The non-seafood dishes are actually pretty good. The prime rib and dim sum stations in particular stick out. They probably don't go through as much of those as seafood so they don't have to cut corners. 

As far as the seafood goes, it seems to change seasonally. Each time I have been there, they have had snow crab and stone crab legs. They have never had king crab when I was there. They had crawfish on this trip as well. One of the attractions is the ""lobster"". I say ""lobster"" in quotations because they are langostinos, which are more closely related to the hermit crab than a lobster or shrimp. These are what you get when you order Lobster Bites at Long John Silver. It's funny seeing how many people line up for the ""lobster"". Some people take their sweet time picking out the biggest ones. They used to have two areas to get them, but now there is only one and it is in the middle of the seafood station, leading to unnecessarily huge lines.

Perhaps I was asking for it because I went around 8:45 - the person at the front assured me that they will continue to bring out food until 9:30.  They did continue to bring out food, but the less popular dishes just sat there, and sat there.

I don't understand why people come here.

All you can eat lobster?  NOT FOUND.  I think I may have found it, but thought it was crawfish.
All you can eat oysters?  NOT FRESH!  Avoid not fresh oyster at all costs.  They say oysters are an afrodisiac but there's nothing sexy in watching someone puke.
All you can eat king crab legs?  NOT FOUND.  Seriously, where was this?  I only found snow crab legs.  No king crab found.
All you can eat seafood?  Yes, but again not fresh.  I found the seafood was more fresh at the Bachannal buffet at Caesars, although the variety was not as good as here.  But why pay more to eat such crap food?  If you're here strictly for quantity or you're someone who likes to puke after eating a ton of food, I can kind of understand..

Even if I didn't get sick, I would not suggest coming here.  Spend the extra to go to Bachannal at Caesars - it's so much better and has enough seafood options to keep you satisfied.  If you did the Buffet of Buffets promotion, it's definitely not worth the extra fee to eat here.

So after I became ill, someone suggest that I contact customer service.  I sent them an email telling them that I got food poisoning from their buffet and they replied asking me to call some risk management team and they will open up an investigation.  I would have preferred if they just refunded the extra money I paid as part of their Buffet of Buffets deal.  But calling their number and speaking with them for a mere $10 is not worth the effort.

Yes the buffet is a little less in terms of certain things compared to previous years, especially lobster (oh how I long for the days of mounds of slip lobster tails). 

But all and all...seafood everywhere, great food, with a little land kind of foods like prime rib. More than enough and then some, I got my fill of mostly shellfish in a nice leisurely environment.

The other thing that stood out compared to previous years, and maybe this is a Caesars Entertainment theme, is the incredibly customer-centric and friendly service.

As fast as these delicacy are snatched from hungry hunter gatherer type homo-sapiens we call humans...they are quickly re-filled piping hot, with the natural season-less steamy vapors of aroma filling the air.  A plate or two will already pay for your entrance fee, but be careful to walk it off as these are dangerous cholesterol  non-friendly little devils.  But boy are they mouth watering delish and so conveniently ready to plop into your mouth.  Asides from this, there are plenty of ice cold, freshly sliced sashimi, with color so flamboyant and tantalizing it calls your name by your salivating glands.  When it comes to the cooked fish, they have everything from steamed sword fish to baked salmon, fried fish and chips to blackened pepper tilapia. South American to Asian to American ethnic flavors can tickle your fancy as well.  

For the non-seafood lovers, I wouldn't really recommend coming here,but if you happen to be with a group you cannot say no to...they have something for you as well.  You will find Peruvian Rice, Prime Rib (which actually is cooked a little more than most buffets - doesn't give you a raw type look) they also have a Brazilian Chicken that is pretty tantalizing.  They also have made to order Bar for your Margarita needs and what not. 

Lastly they have an amazing Gelato machine in a circular gizmo that makes you think ""Spin the Gelato Wheel of Flavor"" & where it lands that is what you get, or not, or TRY IT ALL!...that you must save room for that will fulfill your fullness.  If you are looking for an experience this is one of those buffets to check out.  I actually find this buffet more worth it than that of Caesar's Palace new Bacchanal Buffet.  Be sure to check it out, especially if you are a seafood lover! 

ENJOY & BON APPETIT~!",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,3,0,5,feWa8HLvfIdkfwFbyBypLg

The lobsters are small. They probably more resemble large crawfish. Taste isn't the most fresh in the world but they are lobsters! The tray does get refilled an adequate amount in my opinion.
Standard average fare for the seafood but they are truly stacked in terms of seafood. You can get a lot of different types of seafood.

The price is steep considering the price only.  But if you like seafood and don't waste stomach space on the unnecessary offerings such as pasta, rice and other meaningless carbohydrates then you fill up on seafood and it's totally worth it.

I don't really like the crab legs that every Las Vegas buffet has, don't get me wrong, crab is good, but after years and years of eating those every Vegas trip I crave lobster.  

It's interesting that their lobsters are so small, I always thought it was illegal to fish them out that young because they want them to have a chance to reproduce first. By the flavor and texture of them, I know these were fresh lobsters, but the way they cooked it could've been better....just adding a bit more salt would make a difference. 

Some people lack common decency in this world I was in a line of maybe 15-20 people waiting to get the lobster, this guy had 2 plates and was filling it high up. Luckily there was still plenty in the pan (this tells you how small they were. They are literally the size of a large shrimp (posted a picture).

As for their other food, it's not too bad, but I think majority of the people who come to this buffet do it for the lobster many of their other dishes are not as popular and gets dried up by the heat lamps. 

Price is rather expensive at $45. So don't come here if you are not a lobster fan. I am so I'll be back just for that. most likely eating by myself since everyone I know like those ""better"" places. I'll come here mainly for the tiny lobsters.",O70j6FC1Bq09T0xkVNsstA,3,2,3,Jwy_a_k9UAGj_4A3_ltNpQ
2332091,2015-03-07,5,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"I like the RIO Village Seafood Buffet, on a weekday for dinner it's $44.99 (and if you sign up for or have a gambler's tracking card, you get $1 off).

It's a grand buffet, with lots of options.  I think the non-seafood buffet at The Rio is about $10 cheaper and is in a different location than the Seafood Buffet.

The Seafood is okay.  Typical snow crab legs, fishes, shrimp and other stuff.  The Lobster wasn't very good, it was I think what's called ""Mexican Slipper"" lobster which is smaller and not as tasty.  I'd have preferred also to have ""Dungeness Crab"" a favorite for those from the North in San Francisco or Portland or ""Alaskan King Crab"" which is a higher quality to the ""Snow Crab"" which you can get at any Asian Buffet and has become a common run of the mill menu item for all buffets in general.

The prime rib roast beef as good, but I know can be hit/miss depending what cut they roast and if it's overcooked or done to a medium rare perfection.  The 1st slice I had rivaled what you'd pay $20-30 for at a restaurant, very juicy and flavorful.  The 2nd slice I went to try later on was a bit of the tougher and drier style and tasted like a different lower quality cut of meat than the 1st.

They have international cuisine, Chinese Asian (featuring Roast Duck too), Mexican, Italian and American standard fare.  They have ice cream as well.  Not a robust salad bar, nor soup options or deserts to brag about.

It's always a balancing act of decision making when deciding whether to dine at a buffet VS non-buffet standard dining.  You factor in 1) Price; 2) Service Convenience; 3) Location Convenience; 4) Appetite; 5) Quality.

So, for roughly $55 (after you tip 'em and pay your tax too) the question is.. Can you get a better meal where you just order an entree elsewhere? 

For those who can't eat $50+ worth of food, maybe the answer is ""no"" 

For those who can eat a lot, who also enjoys tasty diverse flavors (so, if you went to a restaurant and ordered a prime rib with snow crab legs and then added in appetizer and desert with a drink, you'd pay more than $50 at most places), this is a good place.

There are other buffet options in Vegas too, some cheaper, some slightly more expensive ('tho $50 is generally the higher end), and all varying in quality of food and diversity of selection.  I generally like the Wynn's Buffet which is the same price.  I like the Rio's better than TI's buffet and may other places 'tho.

I think this is an okay deal at $50 (and for you gamblers out there who flippantly peel out $100's betting the cards, dice or slots, only to lose in mere minutes... treat yourself to a good meal and you should never be cheap eating when you're gambling the same or more money seemingly recklessly... get your priorities  straight and eat well n' enjoy!)

If this were priced at $30 or below that would be right sized and perfect in my opinion however.

2365416,2015-06-24,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"This was honestly a waste of $50. First off, the price. The price for this quality of food should be $15-$25, not $50.

I had the tomato and mozzarella salad, couscous salad, snow crab legs, and the macaroons.

The mozzarella in the salad was a bit on the grainy side and the tomatoes were going bad. They were dented and had a weird mouth feel to them. The couscous salad was overcooked. It was overly dressed and all of the vegetables were all from a can. The snow crab legs were okay. The only bad part of them was that they were kept in a water bath which caused some of the legs to become awfully soggy. Also they cut the legs in half which for me, really doesn't make any sense. If I'm gonna take two legs, I'm gonna take two legs not four halves. Cutting them in half was also a factor of the soggy-ness, allowing the water to reach more of the meat. The macaroons didn't taste fresh and I think they could all have a better filling. They all had a very dense, greasy buttercream filling which could all be replaced for a jam, dulce de leche, or a nut butter.

The room felt very dark and dingy. It was very hard to see.

If you are going to Vegas, I would not recommend going here. There are plenty of more places that are cheaper, have a higher quality, and a better space.",uObrQgJBf4ZTyTy7bDEvPQ,0,0,2,3l85oRpsKRgrf15i11Qjrg

As for the food, you must remember that this is a buffet. The food is made in giant batches and left under a sneeze-guard until it runs out. You shouldn't be expecting a gourmet extravaganza. With that in mind, the food is tasty! I learned about halfway through my first visit that the crab legs are a waste of time. The sushi is actually decent here, although very basic. Every time I've gone, the fish has been fresh. I generally hit the sushi hard, interspersing the million other small things they offer.

After about a 30 minute wait in line, we paid our $29.99 (thanks to a $10 off coupon that one of our group received when he check in at Ballys) and we were seated. We lucked out and got a high table with bar stools.

We specifically picked this buffet because we wanted seafood and we were not disappointed.  So much seafood!  And the majority of it was pretty good.  Well worth the wait and the money.

The little lobster tails thingies were tasty and they were always filled with fresh servings. I really enjoyed the chinese style crab legs more than the steamed ones. Nice and messy and flavorful.  The only disappointment was the crawdads, they were on ice. I would have much preferred hot one to dip in my melted butter. 

Even though we went just for the seafood, I had to fill a little of my stomach with some meat and the prime rib was quite good. Got a nice rare piece too. Yummers.

Dessert was good too. I loved the Wheel of Gelato...thought the 90 year old chinese guy serving it was quite grumpy and only mumbled if you asked him what the flavors were that didn't have a sign on them.

We left stuffed and satisfied.  And though it was a Saturday night at 10:30pm when we left, my belly was so full I decided to just go back to the hotel room and lay on the bed like a beached whale instead of going out to the wee hours of the morning.",VZaHap-cbY_QpeDq6zPIHQ,0,0,4,NpsEoOI6H5yQnP2_X6JQWA

Very expensive, about $40 a person so you better come here with an appetite to make it worth it. I won't write about anything other than the seafood and dessert because let's be honest who comes here for the other stuff anyway.

Mini-lobster: Eh...so my cousin was raving about the lobster, but I felt a little cheated because they were mini and frankly not that good. Not too much flavor and since people get greedy and pile their plates full of this stuff I was left with the soggy dregs of lobster on the bottom. I had a few of these but didn't come back for more. 

Crab Legs: I must be fascinated with the art of digging out the crab meat from those long spindly shells, because I kept coming back for more. I like my seafood simple so steamed crab legs, warm or cold is right up my alley. Dip it in a little clarified butter, Delish!

Dessert: They had Gelato which is always a good bet. The cakes and such come in mini servings which is great for someone as indecisive as me when it comes to sweets. Try everything!",GmcM2fqMfdlEXB0eAvYYPA,1,1,4,RrCML6-Ombrnn07bmCwh9g

2513239,2012-01-14,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"In one word: inconsistent

I had read so many other reviews of this buffet, and they were very mixed.  Still, there seemed to be some recent reviews that were highly rated, so we decided to fork over $86.46 including tax for two people with our Total Rewards card.  My wife and I started by sampling a bite of each of perhaps 20 items to see what was good.  I was shocked about how some of my favorite buffet items didn't interest me at all this trip, and others were done better than even the ultimate Todai buffet had been.

Sushi Rolls - I found rice to be a bit more dry than a good sushi place would have, but not dry enough for me not to eat.  All buffet places have dry rice since it is sitting out.  Because I did see a good volume of sushi going out here, it wasn't old, and hence not dry.  The sashimi (just the fish) was split.  White fish was simply nasty.  Tuna was on-par with other buffets, and the salmon was simply excellent.  Needless to say I probably ate way more salmon than I should have.
Crab Legs - Surprisingly good (hot) although they don't steam them fresh like Aria does.
Lobster Tails - small, and a friend reported of three he ate, one was good, two bad.  My wife seemed to enjoy hers though.
Prime Rib - decent and cooked well, but a little on the fatty side.
Crayfish - decent
Fried shrimp - excellent, crispy, delicious
Fried squid/calimari - very small, mostly batter, but tender inside
Paella - disgraceful.  More like rice with seafood and tomato.  If you want to know paella, DO NOT JUDGE based on this tomato rice dish.
Shrimp, peel and eat - okay size, but tasted like they needed a good wash.
Gelato - okay, but not as good as what you can find in the Pelazzo, which also isn't as good as in Rome.  But it's still better than ice cream.

And finally, what really did it in for me:
Cheesecake - Let me start by saying that I love cheesecake.  You can totally screw up cheesecake and I will still not only eat it, but simply devour and enjoy it.  The cheesecake here made me want to scream and leave.  I said it tasted like the bottom of a barrel of rotten seafood.  My wife, not believing me, took a bite.  She said it tasted like rotten chicken.  Needless to say, this didn't...leave a good taste in our mouths.

Yes, there is some good stuff here, but also some very bad.  Why should you chance it and pay so much?  Please save your money and go to Aria or another buffet with less selection, but higher quality.",LUFXkp-G7uGbal44qq-NEw,0,0,2,JYnG8eUHil0A_Ls4ImYrVA

Purchased the total rewards 24 hour pass priced at 49.99. 

With an extra 16.44 including tax per visit at this buffet it was well worth it. 

There was no wait, we roughly came between 6:00 - 6:30pm and stayed for 2 and half hours. 

I'm going to jump straight to the reason why I failed to give this review the perfect 10! The one and sole reason was for the service. As we were seated, my party left to get their food as I waited to give our drink orders. Soon after our server came, asked for the drink orders. I had never felt so uncomfortable in my life! His eyes were directly at my chest area! No a glance, not a quick look but a complete stare. I struggled a tad but giving the orders because it was hard to look at him and see his eyes were fixated elsewhere! I was in total shock that I just let it go, and tried to cover up more. After that, he was very scatter brained. He rarely came to check if drinks needed refills, we had to grab the attention of another server a couple times. I believe we truly had just the one bad server, because I noticed another server who was serving another table was quite pleasant. 

Now moving on to the food! 

If you are anything like I am! I am an absolute seafood lover! This buffet specifically catering to a good variety of seafood was just heaven.

If my memory serves me right, the buffet was split into 5 different sections.   
 From far left to right, we had dessert which included up 12 different gelato flavors, pies, creme brûlée, cakes, ect then fruits, melons, pineapple, and grapes. Then we have the section in which serves the lobster tails that are so famously advertised. The lobster tails are cooked with colossal shrimps, this was the highly sought out thing at the buffet. Because many people were expecting full sized lobster tails, many frequently asked where they were. There were 2 types of lobster. Squat lobster which were quite small, it didn't quite strike an ohh factor, but there was also a a good, I'd say midsize red tail lobster that was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked. The colossal shrimps were cooked perfectly as well! 

Moving onto the next section there was sushi and and sashimi available. I'm an epic sushi lover, but I have to admit, I'm more a sashimi lover! The rolls available were decent. The sashimi available was ahi tuna and salmon. The salmon was really good. 

Now to the next section where I spent a good amount of my time in. The crustacean section. From chilled crab legs to oysters and scallops! I definitely enjoyed it so much, it tasted so fresh. This section was probably the second most busiest area. It was frequently refilled with more or each. I'm lost for words because I can not think of what I could say how much enjoyed it. 

As you continue though the buffet, some other dishes available are sauté scallops, prime rib, mussels, jambalaya, ""boiling crab like shrimp"", stuffed crab, stuffed potatoes. And other dishes I found to be really good!

However I have to agree that the variety is huge and you should walk around the whole chain first before you start getting food. My boyfriend and I was trying to get a little bit of everything but failed because we were focusing on the first half too much.

Long lines to get in and plenty of choices to choose from when getting to the seafood choices.  This time, no line to get in at 7pm on a Saturday night!  

One thing I love is getting a butter shrimped scampi or cleaned peeled shrimp with cocktail sauce. What did I see?  Cleaned but unpeeled shrimp!  Come on!  I'm on vacation!  You want me to peel shrimp?  

Having been here a couple of times, I had noticed that the ""seafood"" in seafood buffet has dwindled a bit.  When I took a look at what they offered, I can see that maybe 55-60% of the buffet was seafood with the remaining part offering meat or other cuisines that offered meat dishes or seafood dishes.  The shrimp dumpling that they had wasn't so great...I've had better.Their baja included fajitas and things didn't impress me.  However their pork spareribs were unexpectedly awesome.

There are so many ways to prepare seafood dishes.  For example, I'd love to see if they could had made something inspired from the South or maybe something done Asian style like with miso.  Instead we got a couple of baked seafood items and the usual array of deep fried calamari, clam strips, and shrimps.

I made sure to not forget about dessert.  The gelato selection that they have over there is excellent!  I had the blueberry cheesecake gelato and it rocked my world.  They also had the Elvis, peanut butter/jelly/banana!  No thanks...I'm not ready to channel Elvis after a full meal like that.

For $48, I hoped to have the same experience as before.  They really need to change things up a bit.  During my meal, I was having one of those cravings for a Red Lobster like cheesy biscuit.

But I felt it was better than both the Wynn and Bellagio buffet!

Yes I just said that. 

Don't get me wrong the Wynn and Bellagio buffet are top notch as well. They have a much nicer/luxrious atmosphere compared to the Village Seafood buffet. 

But I came for the food. Perhaps it was because prior to eating at the Wynn and Bellagio, there was A LOT of hype behind them. My expectations were super high from all the reviews that after my experience it was, ""yea it was good but that was it?---  that was supposedly the best buffets""

I went into Village Seafood not expecting much at all, just heard it was good as well, but no hype or high expections.

The decor and atmosphere are well below that of the Wynn and Bellagio. The buffet sections were not as spread out as the aforementioned places, it did make it look more like a dense amount of choices. So it depends how you perceive it.

They don't call it the ""Seafood"" buffet for no reason. They definitely had more choices in seafood compared to the others. Of course its a trade-off wit other items. But I'm not that much of a pig to argue that they were missing other items, because it made up for it with more seafood.

All the food tasted great, I went straight to the lobster and crab of course. There is sushi, and they were not bad, but not good either, but no buffet (even the wynn and bellagio) produce a ""good"" sushi. 

What really shines is the desserts. The gelato wheel is awesome! The flavors all taste great and refreshing. The other dessert items are absolutely superb as well.

The staff that cleans up after your plates are attentive and we had no problems.

A line does form as well, but not as much and not as long as the more popular Wynn and Bellagio. 

I would definitely go here, and after you experience the hype that is of Wynn and Bellagio buffets, give this a shot.",Qv0xMxEs9XHEqI_9zb8vcQ,2,1,5,-eGnSzAWo6mNHYU1BGfGiA

Their best items were the cooked ones. Don't go after the enticing raw oysters. Just don't. Stuffed crab shells, yes. Oh, and the crab legs. I guess you can't mess up steaming some crab legs.

They have a whole range of other foods grouped by ethnicity. You can check them out, but they all seem kind of the same after a few rounds. All just bland below average foods with some random seafood thrown in them.

We'd heard some pretty good things about the place from friends and family so decided to try it for our first meal in Vegas. For $50 a person we expected better. Maybe we were disappointed because we got our hopes up or because it was a weekday? But then again, we were there on New Years so the food should've been at it's best. 

They had a lot of selections which included things like king crab, oysters, and lobster. Too bad the quality of the food wasn't good. The oysters weren't all that fresh and the king crab was just like any other king crab at any other buffet. The lobster was small tails mixed in with some shrimp and they were very bland and overcooked. Actually, most of the food was overcooked.

Our first buffet in Vegas and we were disappointed. All and all it was ok, not great. Definitely not worth the $50. For the quality of food we had that night it's probably worth around $30 a person. If it was cheaper, then it'd be worth a go and probably warrant another star. But my suggestion is pay less and go to the Buffet at the Bellagio for better food. It's not all seafood but they have a decent amount of good quality seafood (fresh tuna, Chilean sea bass, king crab, etc.) I don't know about others, but for me, it's about quality, not quantity.

As the race day neared, I thought more and more about the obscene quantity of seafood I would consume once I finished my marathon. After all, one of the perks of running 26.2 miles is that you get to eat whatever you want before and after the race without feeling an ounce of guilt (at least in theory).

Thus, to my mild disappointment, the seafood buffet never really lived up to what I expected it to be. Surprising, because I've been here before--Oh how I've been here before... 

I'd say this was my 6th or so visit to the seafood buffet, and in all honesty, I don't know why I keep coming back. At $39.99 + tax and tip, it's hardly a bargain. I mean, if their seafood was the best I've ever had, I might not mind, but it's ""good"" at best...not even ""great"".

This place is one of the most expensive buffet in Vegas, $44.99 when I was there Sat night. On the Rio's website, they are promoting an all-seafood buffet. You would think with this price, there are big lobster tails, fresh oysters, abalone salad, big crab legs, 4-5 kind of fishes, etc. Am I expecting too much?

Guess what? Not only this is not an all -seafood buffet, this is one of the worst (if not the worst) buffter in Vegas!

First of all, only less than half of the dishes contain seafood. The seafood they serve is the ordinary cheap stuff: medium size shrimp with shells, medium size crab legs, small clams and mussels. Oysters? dry and ugly. I would not eat them raw.

Thinking about lobster tail? There is none. There are extra small crawfish (small as your thumb), and medium size crawfish tails cooked Chinese style (chopped in half vertically). I am very sure these so called ""lobster tails"" are crawfish as it is illegal to catch lobster in such small size.

Interestingly, there is no tag on any dish indicating what it is. Does it indicate something?

About 1/6 of the counter space is for Mexican food, actually looked OK, except nobody is there. Another 1/6 is dedicated to Italian with only shrimp as seafood. The Italian station looks so bad that no one is hardly there.

The Chinese station? Oh man, the food looks like from the night before and no seafood there either. Some roast duck/chicken and some pork buns. Looks very dry due to ""aging"".

Besids cold seafood (clams, mussel and oyster), most cooked seafood are havey breaded shrimp and  mussel. Nowhere near the quality from Bellagio's buffet.

The prim rib? Looks extremely low quality and has funny looking color. No one was taking it on Saturday night. I was hoping enough people would take that prim rib so that I can see what the next piece would look like. No luck after an hour.

They did not even have whole chicken or turkey in the carve station. Only fat chicken wings!

The only bright spot is the grilled octopus. They are big and good. The source is also pretty tasty.

The salad station is extremely small, next to the fruit station. The desert station is OK, with home made ice cream.

In summary, this is a buffet which should be priced no more than $20. Their child pricing is only up to 8 yrs old ($25), which is strange also.

My guess is their marketing trick is to lure you in just for once. This is first and last time I am in Rio.

There are really only 3 buffet worthy to try in Vegas on the strip: (1) Bellagio's: cheaper at $36.99 on Sat, extremely high quality food, also very very good coffee; (2) Mandalay Bay's: about $30, quality is consistent, main stream stuff; (3) Wynn's: usually long lines and expensive, but food is in high quality.",3eR-AAcrpPXwVzrhBJFSZw,0,0,1,NkkcBSytrk1-IoQPjQhMCg

Well, that is what happened to me at this fine buffet restaurant. It was awkward to say the least, but I managed through with grace and dignity that my folks would be proud of.

The food here is pretty good for a buffet. Large variety and the man was very happy as he loves seafood and sushi. The crab legs were watered down a bit, the shrimp still had shells and the crab in the sushi was krab, but those were the only negatives. The prime rib and fried shrimp were a deliciously fattening combination, that I particularly enjoyed but what made this buffet the best was the dessert bar with tons of flavors of gelato (really good gelato I might add) and some interesting cupcakes with different toppings and fillings.

As a seafood LOVER, I cannot get over the fact of how Freakishly delicious the crab claws (both regular + rock crabs were available!!!!), the snow crab legs, and the oysters and shrimp all tasted at a buffet.

My group also spent 2 hours here as we did with the Wynn Buffet. We spent the first hour just devouring plate after plate after plate of the crab claws and oysters and shrimp. I would say it was close to being as good as sex (and very very few things get that close), just based solely on the freshness and sweetness of the crab, oysters, and shrimp alone. I apologize to all the surrounding people who were scarred for life after watching the monstrosity of a scene of the slurping, mumbling, and violent merciless cracking that my friends and I created during this time. The waiter was very nice and laughed as he switched out each of the 9 or 10 baskets of empty seafood carcasses that had been laid to waste by our ravenous appetite. 

We spent the 2nd hour trying all the different regional dishes and all turned out ok, nothing spectacular but enough to satisfy many different palettes. The dessert and gelato station was alright, but similar to other buffet dessert stations. I remember the sea bass and tilapia fillet dishes both being quite tasty, herby, and fresh. The sashimi selection were surprisingly good as well, the salmon was quite silky and buttery smooth.

If you love crab claws, legs, shrimp, raw oysters, and seafood... It Is Worth the $40. If not look elsewhere with more selection like the Wynn or the Bellagio. I have no idea how they could've profited from the amount that my friends and I shoved down our bellies.

Known only as ""The Silent Hunter"" by family and friends, my demeanor morphs from free spirit into a wily predator about to viciously attack his prey when at a buffet such as this.

Here are my tips for a successful buffet outing at Rio's Seafood Buffet: 

*  On the day of the buffet, no lunch or unnecessary snacking

At the buffet:

*   No salads, breads, or any other useless filler foods. Their conspicuous 
     presence near the crab legs and shrimp could throw you off your game.
     Don't fall for it.

*  Your table waiter will take your drink order. Be prepared for its arrival in a large
    red plastic cup roughly the same size as one of those Big Gulps, another clever 
    ruse designed to slow your eating stride. Too much liquid, forget it.

*  The shrimp. Oldest trick in the book! It's still in the shell, not good. Time is your 
    biggest opponent here  Eating slowly will cut your consumption rate by almost 
    half. (I have no empirical data to support this, just a guess)  I know it's tempting 
    but don't bother with the shrimp, not now at least. We'll come back to that in a
    a moment.

And this brings us to the piece de resistance ; the crab. A couple of problems however. Let's walk through them shall we?
  
First, its still in the shell and cold, sitting on an ice bed since God knows when.
Second, its snow crab, not much yield for the effort.

Here's what you do.
Bring a pair of gloves with you to the restaurant. White gloves, with which you'll inform your server of their concealing a rare medical condition; ""I've got leprosy"", you inform her, ""Unless you want a rotting-skin, shit-show on your hands, you'll need to remove the shells from my crab. You'll also need to heat it up for me...my gums are sensitive to cold. Oh, and bring some clarified butter, and maybe a pound o' shrimp while you're at it, peeled of course.""

Now eat my friend.
Eat until you mightily swell like a blue tick, or, until the manager asks you to leave, or, you explode, whichever comes first.
Now go and enjoy.",9sldtsoM9MFEyPEss0L9kA,5,3,5,fF_Oh468hHwj-4xn-42CqQ

Luckily, SO is a VIP member(please dont ask me how much one has to gamble to earn that status :-/) so we walked right up to the front as there was no one in that line. The lady sent us back to the info desk because his card was expired. We got a new card, went back and the lady was ringing up some others so the manager took it upon himself to seat us. 
The main reason i was there was to eat as much shrimp cocktail as possible with enough cocktail sauce to drown it. Started with the cold items, had some lobster and crab legs and then finished with the dessert. The shrimp cocktail was yummy because it was de-veined. Yes, there are many restaurants that do not de-vein shrimp. GROCE. Sushi was good, the crab legs and lobster were just okay(i didnt like whatever seasoning they used) while the desserts were amazing especially the creme brulee!!! It was so good, i went to get two more. I was already full at this point but i seriously stuffed my face with that creme brulee omg. 

Would I go back? Maybe for takeout of the creme brulee and shrimp cocktail but im not sure if thats allowed. Our waitress was very attentive and there was a lady hanging out roses to mom's. She never came to our table because i didnt have a happy mother's day at our table. 

It was an overall good experience and i would have given 3 stars if we had to stand in that long ass line. For both of us it was $80 and change..... Thats a lot imo but if you love buffets and have a HUGE appetite, it might be worth it for you.",-knxg3ZwObc77tEKnNdL7Q,2,1,4,hQ2zAoX30C7Zi2kXWh5tlg

If the buffet was as good as last time it would be well worth it. Unfortunately the quality of the buffet has slid from great to above pitiful. The King crab legs were only the smaller legs and there was Snow crab mixed in. Which is fine for $15-20 buffets no problem. But they want in excess of $45 here. Unacceptable and the lobster tails look like cheap Sea of Cortez lobsters cut in half and my GF got one that was rancid smelled like a Tijuana whorehouse and the rest were chewy. This was supposed to be a special birthday dinner. There were some great food items but we came for the crab legs and Lobster and they dropped the ball bigtime on this one.

3096768,2010-04-03,5,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"WOW! Village Seafood Buffet you had me at Sea... Why would you need a Seafood Buffet, when every buffet in Las Vegas has Seafood?  If you are like me sometimes you go to the buffet JUST for the seafood. If you skip all the other dishes and head straight to the seafood, Village Seafood Buffet located in the Rio Hotel is for you! 

My first time staying at Rio.. I was getting ready to go to the Carnival World Buffet (which is Las Vegas largest buffet), but I read about the Seafood Buffet AYCE Seafood, lobster, king crap, and oysters. WHATT???!!! Oysters and Lobster! That's a first! Every Buffet has king crap and shrimp, but raw oysters? YUM! At around $38 dollar per person, this buffet easily rivals Wynn Buffet for the most expensive buffet in Vegas. After checking in to the hotel I received a coupon book with $10 bucks off. How could I say no? 

When you first enter the buffet it looks sorta like Todai (YUCK don't ever go there!!), but a lot better. I highly recommend going for the Oysters and King crab first. Also, another great strategy would be eat the raw foods first and go for the cooked seafood later. I would not recommend using the same fork for raw and cooked food, maybe you can wipe it off with a napkin. Keep you stomach happy and you will be a true AYCE specialist. 

Oysters were awesome! No fishy taste or smell means they are fresh! King crab legs and claws with butter and I'm in heaven. The cocktail shrimp was pretty normal. I was hoping they would be jumbo shrimp like Wynn and pre-peeled. The lobster tail did not blow me away. I expected something like Boston lobster or at least lobster tail with butter, but instead I received chopped up lobster tail with pieces of shrimp. If it weren't for the shells, most people would not be able to tell the difference between mini lobster tails and shrimp. This did not look like the images on the TV outside of the buffet. Keep it simple don't fry my lobster! This method dries out the lobster at that point you might as well just cock shrimp, its cheaper. Just broil it and give me some lemons and butter. 

There are other items like steak and some Asian cuisine, but I recommend skipping those items completely and focus at the task at hand which is concur the seafood! The other items are delicious, but save it for another day another buffet. Man vs. SEAFOOD Only please! Get your 40 dollars worth. Stock up for all the days you wanted seafood and couldn't have it. Another side note... the desserts were very disappointing. I think I have more options of dessert in the frozen section of a grocery store. No pies or cakes just mini tart things and by mini I mean MINI. The gelato or ice cream what ever it is. Didn't taste like gelato, ice cream, or frozen yogurt so I'm not sure what it was exactly. The coffee ""gelato"" did not taste like coffee. It taste more like a sbucks frappuccino after the ice melts and its just cream and ice water. Next time I will skip the dessert and just eat the seafood. *Small disappointment.. where the Cajun/ creole food?? I want some gumbo, jambalaya or at least some Lobster bisque. The service was great! Servers constantly empty the shell baskets and refilled my delicious ice tea and coffee.

Highly recommend for seafood ONLY. Get ready to get your hands dirty and enjoy the freshest seafood you have ever tasted in the middle of the desert. Bring a friend and coupon. Enjoy.",tHjAg9Fy3TUB564rKBn0bw,6,5,4,Av3zFDO58U1GGr6e_OVI7Q

I was on a time crunch because we had to catch a show at 8pm at the Riviera so dessert was rushed for some of us. 
I LOVE their mini lobster tail things (I still have no idea what crustaceon that is) all you have to do is stick your fork in it, pull the meat out and dip it in lemon butter. Easy, breezy, and fatty. This is all I usually eat plus some shrimp and a little prime rib. I don't mess with crab legs because I HATE to peel those apart...if we had the time I might have eaten a few. I sampled some of the other choices...stayed away from the mexican food(nothing looked that great there and I don't want to waste stomach space for tacos), tried some asian noodles and duck. The duck was actually really moist and the noodles very tasty. The prime rib was bomb diggity...very tender and flavorful. At the dessert station..yummy was the caramel pecan tarts(take off the big chocolate thing on top) and the creme brulee. There is a LONG line to wait for dessert because of the italian gelato. It's hand scooped and not all flavors are labeled so people are asking what flavor is that? What is that? Can I taste first so I don't have to wait another 10 minutes in this friggin line for another scoop? ugh..my suggestion..skip the tiny sample scoop of ice cream and just stick to the baked goods. 
My only other disappointment with this buffet is their sushi..I always get the sashimi but why cut it like you took a steak knife and hacked it up? They need real sushi chefs to prepare their raw bar because the sushi looks crappy and what..NO spicy tuna rolls??? shoot..the sushi selection is better at Todai.
The seafood buffet here is starting to decline for me. I used to be all giddy about coming here but it seems their standards are starting to fall because they have so many people willing to shell out 38 dollars and wait 2 hours. Be willing to pay $25 for kids ages5 and up. If your kids can pass for 4 and under, lie. My daughter is 10 but she is small and half way through her crab and butter, she fell asleep. There went $25 bucks!
So overall, they need to step it up and keep this buffet at the highest quality of food like they USED to. They used to not serve anything but seafood and prime rib here.

The hotel is located off of the 15 Freeway and Flamingo Boulevard. There is ample parking all around the property, but the best is the parking structure right off of Flamingo. It has a sky bridge from the structure right to the Masquerade Village area. Take the escalator down to the casino floor and you'll see the Village Seafood Buffet on your right. Check the Rio's website for buffet times as they change periodically. It is also wise to arrive before it opens or might be waiting for a while (bring comfortable shoes for standing if you don't get there early). 

The décor was recently updated. It originally had the décor of a fishing port - seafood crates, ropes, old cannery box labels, etc. Now, it's more chic with a more upscale feel. The dining room is very open and showcases the wonderful seafood the way it should be.

This is a seafood lover's dream and won't disappoint. It is one of the pricier buffets in Vegas so if you don't like seafood, you can sit this one out. The Carnival World Buffet might be better suited for you on the other side of Rio's property. Well, let's get started with the showcase.

Chilled on ice, you will find peel and eat shrimp (all that your heart desires), crawfish (AKA nawlins mug bugs), freshly steamed and chilled mussels and snow crab legs, and oysters on the half shell. Remember, don't be shy to smell your seafood before you eat it, especially when it comes to raw shell fish. They should smell like fresh sea water. If you're not quite sure, put it down and try another one. The Rio has the highest quality of seafood, but it is always beneficial to make sure yourself.

On the steam table, they have tons of choices from hot, steamed crab legs with drawn butter, clams, and other seafood delicacies. They also have the best carved prime rib in town with au jus and horseradish. So you can have some Turf with your Surf (emphasizing Surf in a big way).

They also have a sushi bar. If you are a sushi newbie, this is the best way to try and not feel bad about not eating it. Grab a plate, pour yourself a side cup of shoyu (soy sauce) and a glob of wasabi (Japanese horseradish) and start choosing your pieces - they have sashimi (raw salmon, tuna, red snapper cuts) to intricate rolls like spicy tuna. If you're not sure, ask one of the sushi chefs behind the counter. They are always happy to answer your questions.

They call it the Seven Seas so you can take a trip around the world from the Mediterranean, Pacific Rim, Baja, and South America. Go light on these areas as they have a lot of pasta, breaded, and starchy items that may fill you up too quickly. And you really want to at least sample something from every section.

Last, but not least, the desserts bar. The Rio has the best desserts from pies to cakes to cookies to gelato. Spin the wheel of gelato with flavors like pineapple coconut, chocolate, strawberry, tiramisu, and Elvis. I'm not going to spoil this surprise so you'll just have to visit the buffet to find out what the Elvis flavor has in it for yourself. They also make mini versions of decadent desserts you'll find in fine dining restaurants - crème brulee, chocolate covered strawberries, cannolis, and much more.

If you're feeling lucky, take a drive out to Vegas. You'll definitely get a triple 7 at the Village Seafood Buffet.",aGUZKSRPA-MHHj6b8GhOww,5,0,5,MjK98sCB1RCfKdh1bkuYpA

Vegas has an infinite amount of dining options so we narrowed it down by choosing seafood. It was a no-brainer decision to come to Village Seafood because of the great reviews and the all-you-can-eat buffet featuring a wide variety of items. 

The cost is around $50.00 per person and I think they give a small discount if you present your Total Rewards member card. Also if you happen to be a Neveda resident, you can get an extreme discount which makes it even more worth while. 

We arrived early and had to wait for Village Seafood Buffet to open at 3:30pm. As stated previously, they offer a wide selection of seafood including, shrimp, tiny lobsters, craw fish, a variety of fish and crab legs. All of the food was very fresh and good. If I had one small complaint, I will forewarn you that much of the boiled seafood is heavily salted. This obviously poses a problem for guests, but it also seems strategic for curbing the appetites of hungry customers. Our server was attentive and made sure that we never had an empty drink. All you can drink wine can be added on to the buffet for an additional cost per guest. There is also a bar inside of the buffet. 

Full disclosure... I am so not a buffet kind of girl, but this place exceeds typical buffets with flying colors, especially if you are a seafood fan.",dtNxBCxtp_8HuJY_eoU7EQ,9,2,4,jPWeKglbTSW9yyCPRaDpiQ

When we got there, we were told that only have dinner served on Sundays, which was fine because we wanted to try a lot of different foods. While we were there they had a special on drinks for two people that came in two large margarita glasses that you can keep when you're done.  Our server was a major doll! She was so friendly and personable, really attentive with all the tables she was taking care of, and definitely goes out of her way for people. When we were done with our large drinks, she took our glasses, cleaned them, and returned them to us.

Back to the food: There were different sections for different types of food and there were so many choices that there was no way to eat it all! Just as you would expect from Vegas, each dish was served as they should: anything fried was crispy and hot and cold dishes were served appropriately. Above all, the dishes were fresh and tasty. I'll definitely be back here again for more delicious food... and the great service!

Note: By the end of our meal, a line was formed outside to get in. I'm not sure how long they waited, but it did get pretty packed for an early dinner. Might be good to come here early to make sure you can get in.",FoBIr2-anCEyT9Ajp-oWtA,2,2,4,D3XE4XVS2mVvcJGD_K0-fA

The service was really fast here. Our waiter was always one step ahead of us and dumped our shells faster than we could crack them. That's always a plus. 

Desert bar was really good, they have a really nice section of gelato! All you can eat gelato, and it's $5 for a scoop on the strip alone. 

A lot of people mentioned the long wait. I came right at 4pm where they open and there was only a ten minute wait.

My family recently went and the food as someone put it was just ok, what we got to eat that is. The biggest issue was that cooked in the center of my brothers third bite of a fish dish was a wad of clam bag netting. Now my brother is very sensitive to finding netting in his meal and he was so grossed out and discussed that he could not take another bite of anything. I was not at the table when this happened, by the time I returned my brother's wife had already given it to the waitress who casually said, ""Oh, it is just some clam bag netting"".  When I realized that my brother, who enjoys seafood was not eating and I found out what had occurred I casually found the manager and mentioned what had happened. My brother didn't want to make a scene and to be honest just wanted to get the hello out of there. Well, the manager did finally come over and tried explaining that there was nothing to worry about that it was just a bite of netting from the clam bag. WE KNOW WHAT IT IS. But did it belong in a cooked entree??? The manager never said sorry and then began to walk away. As you can see I am much more out spoken than my brother, who by the way is a huge tough guy, I said excuse me, that's it? He took three bites of his meal on this buffet and you just explain what the netting is, I would like a refund for his meal, the manager said, well the best I can do is charge you a kids price or something so I think he credited my buddies card $25.00. I could see that my brother was bothered by all of this, so I dropped it, but WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD RIO'S BUFFET that we LOVED for years?

     The cashier was very nice and allowed us to walk around, view the area, and food that was already place out. We were pleased to see crawfish, snowcrabs, baby lobster, shrimp, already steamed and seasoned waiting for us. We then went on to pay for our buffet which was about $44.00 with our $5.00 discount via the Rio card. 
     Once it was officially open, we were seated and drink orders were taken by our server, Henry. We went straight for the snow crabs, crawfish, shrimp, and lobster that was steamed. The crawfish an shrimp had a great flavor hence I'm from New Orleans and a lot of places lack seasoning. They even had smoke sausage that had a nice kick to it which made the meal even better. 

Sn: the Rio had some interesting drama. The police came and removed a man from his table that had apparently found an iPhone 5 and didn't turn it in. They had surrounded his table and took the iPhone only to return 10 minute later to remove him.

500 items and 9 kitchens seem like I would be happy, right? Again, no lobster!

When it comes down to the perfect food, 9 people out of ten will say,  lobster (and the tenth has no taste!).

That being said, the Village seafood buffet has plenty of, yes, you guessed it, lobster! Tender, juicy, succulent lobster! If you want more lobster, all you have to do is get up and get some!

I love the people who pick through and find the few they want to eat, too funny really. Its all you can eat. Take a shovel and pile it on your plate!

My plate refilled 5 times, it was amazing! 

Started with Miso soup and crab as well. At the end, the lobster won!

When I couldn't shove another lobster tail into my mouth I had to finally admit defeat. Damn!

So let's say I had ten, half tails per plate (conservative estimate). That would mean I had 25 slipper lobsters for dinner! Pretty amazing for free! Did I say free!?! Why yes,  I did!!!

Last time I ate here was Thanksgiving week 2014; missed it on my previous Vegas visit Feb. 15-17, but not on this trip. Every time I go to Vegas I enjoy the fresh seafood and prime rib here at the Rio Seafood Buffet. Lobster was again more rock lobster than Canadian red lobster, but I won't get too picky as I enjoyed both. Though, I think they used ab Old Bay type seafood seasoning. On all my previous visits I really can taste the sweetness of the Canadian lobster tails. Also, I say ""Canadian"" as that's how they described it in Nov. 2014, but I believe these are Maine or American lobster from the East Coast (Homarus americanus). I give it 5 stars because the food, service, ambiance has always been top-notch THROUGH THE YEARS. 

Rice-based dishes were also exceptional, as in the jambalaya and the Mexican paella type dish. Just brimming with salinity and brine. Clams, fish, squid, all in a pleasing mix; the only thing that could top it would be if you were by the seashore. 

Prime rib as good as it can be: I always have a good slice here. Just right in seasoning, you could have it rare or medium rare. Dessert never disappint in quality and quantity. The gelato bar is one of the highlights of this buffet.

The cold crab legs near the cold seafood was a little salty. The lobster tails were small and slightly rubbery. But everything tastes better drowned in garlic butter.

The best part of this whole buffet was the desserts. The green tea cheesecake was nice and light. The creme brulee was just enough sweet and creamy to end a dinner. The bread pudding or whatever that was with the vanilla spice sauce was excellent.  The red velvet cupcakes were dry and tasted horrible.

Go somewhere else for the buffet. This one is very over rated.

For those with kids, it's not a very kid friendly place. The seating is a little tight. So, if you have anything larger than an umbrella stroller, it can be a hassle.

3437197,2014-04-18,3,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"After reading the plethora of reviews about this place I first called the buffet to see if there was any food that ran out. Nope. So that's a good sign. Then I decided that the ONLY way to find out whether this place is worth the 50 bucks or not is to try it for myself. When it comes to buffets it is a hit or miss. And with the myriad of buffets that is popping all over vegas, I can only trust my own palate. So in this review I will include info that sometimes is missing which may matter a great deal for you when you have to make a choice.

First we went there on a Wednesday night at around 8 PM.  There were only 2 parties ahead of us and we were seated fairly quickly.  They place a bowl at each table so you can put the shells and any food you don't really want and they will clean out that bowl when it gets almost full.  They do have plenty of people busing the table and our drinks came quickly.  I went straight to the Crustacean section and loaded up on snow crab and king crab.  Note for crab lovers: NEVER get the legs that have been cut in half. They get dry.  Always get the fully shelled ones. A bit of extra work but it is worth it. Yum!  I also got some crawfish.  Too overcooked on most of them.  So I left those alone after a while.  I also got the oysters!  Yum!  Sweet!  Put some of that cocktail sauce and lemon you're good to go!  Then I got some of the turf foods.  Not bad.  Beef was good.  Then I got some lobster.  There was a dude in front of me who picked through the lobster section for the red lobsters and got a plateful.  They have another type of lobster which I was unfamiliar with (kind of a tan-striped color).  I managed to pick through and got three of the red lobsters. The lady behind me was upset at the guy in front of me and asked the server behind the counter for more red lobsters. LOL.  Anyway, just be sure to make a beeline for whichever you like best like I did for the crabs.  The lines weren't long at all, if there was any line at all.  The stations are all connected but at this time I didn't stay in line for a long time at all (five minutes tops).  My friend tried more variety of food (surf and turf).  I tried the jumbo shrimp and it tasted great!  I was surprised.  But I love crab too much so I stuffed myself with crab. LOL  I honestly didn't care for anything else.

Our server was on point. He kept coming back to check on our shell bow, whisked away our plates, and refilled our drinks.  I saw plenty of servers that evening.  Tons of people around us were seafood lovers and compared to them, I was such a newbie.  Oh they also have a gelato station so I used the mango sorbette as my ""palate cleanser"". LOL  It actually worked pretty well as I transitioned to my turf foods.  :)  Their creme brulee was pretty good, but their ""cream puff"" had no cream. I think someone forgot the cream. LOL.  Other than that, everyone else was spot on about the review of the desserts.  Small station, but hey, with gelato section who cares!  I'd rather have that any day over mass made dessert cakes you can buy from food for less (though I have to say food for less actually has really good desserts....so maybe I should say smart and final or something).

  So all in all I was happy with this place.  Do I recommend it? Sure.  But I do because I was able to have a non-crowded experience.  I think during the weekends you're bound to get a lot of more problems b/c of the large amount of people going through.  So use your judgement when you decide to go in terms of the time.  I went and had a good time, but it was during the middle of the week.  :)  Happy shelling!",0WggYoVzoTHgmP8BR00x1w,5,2,4,eJwLqexx7Dfkhmx1pdr0rA

They also have the biggest shrimp I have ever seen at a buffet!! 

They have all different types of seafood... hot, cold, and in different flavors: american, asian, etc. I tried them all, except the cold. I'll admit, the crab legs were a bit dry... but I loaded up on lobster tail, which I'm sure was more then $40 worth. 

I did this place as a last stop on my buffet of buffets gluttony quest... for a $10 add-on, I think this place is way MORE worth it as an add-on compared to the Caesar's buffet add-on cost!

You name it...they had it...lobster tails, cocktail shrimps, pasta and shrimp, dungeness crabs, snow crabs, oysters, clams, scallops all cooked in so many different styles.  Plus they had a pretty amazing dessert bar as well. Some of my favorites were the shrimp pasta, mac and cheese lobster and clam chowder soup.

3478277,2013-03-14,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"In anticipation to my first trip to Vegas, I looked up best seafood buffets in Vegas on the internet, and in addition to Bellagio, this one one came up as well.  During my trip I didn't get to go to the Bellagio, but I did get to come here.

As a seafood lover, this restaurant was absolute heaven for me.  All you can eat seafood for $50 is probably the best deal ever and even though I got full quicker than I would have liked, I still think I got my money's worth.  

I tried many different types of food, but the ones I remember most was the seafood.  I had lobster, clams, oysters, and crab legs.  While some of the seafood found at this restaurant can be found at other Vegas hotels, this was the only place that I visited that had such a wide selection of seafood and the only place that I visited that had lobster.  There were other types of food as well, but that was not the reason I came here.  The lobsters were kind of small, but this being all you can eat, you can go back for 2nds if you desire.

I enjoyed most of the seafood, but some crab legs they had weren't very good.  I think it was Japanese crab legs and they looked a little different from what I am used to, so instead of loading up my plate with them, I got one small cluster to avoid wasting too much food in case I didn't like it; which I didn't.  

The waitstaff was excellent, always kept our drinks full and was always around taking empty shells and finished plates from your table as well as providing more paper towels whenever needed.

My only complaint was not with the restaurant itself, but with greedy customers.  While I was waiting patiently in line to get a few clams, the person in front of me, one by one, piled literally half of the whole pan of clams that were just brought out onto his plate to the point they were falling off.  This was completely unnecessary, greedy and rude, as nothing was stopping him from coming back to get some more later on if he wanted.  I wanted to say something but I went to Vegas to have a good time not get into a confrontation with someone who was so self centered to think that he was the only person in the restaurant who liked clams.  Even though it wasn't the restaurant's fault, I wish there was an employee around that could have told him to move on as other people were waiting on clams as well.  

There was also the issue of so many patrons here wasting food; piling up their plates and not even eating a third of the stuff they got, but having no problem going back and piling their plates with more food that they won't eat either.  This is a pet peeve of mine at any buffet, so it is not a knock on this restaurant at all but instead an observation that buffets do tend to bring out the worst in people especially when it comes to greed.  This type of wastefulness is not only disrespectful, it ultimately ends up raising the prices for everyone.  There are some buffets in other cities that will kick you out if you waste too much food, maybe this restaurant should consider doing the same.

Surprisingly there weren't many kids here when I came here and even the kids who were here were well behaved and didn't run around the place, cut in line or pile up their plates with food they never planned to eat.  In fact, they were better behaved than some of the adult customers here which was a surprise.

Overall I really enjoyed eating here.  Even though I think I got my money's worth, there were some foods I missed out on because I was simply too full. I also wish I would have gotten one of the margarita's in that huge glass. However, I plan on coming back here during my next trip to Vegas and trying the things I didn't get to try last time.  

Fifty plus dollars per person is very steep compared to other buffets in Vegas, so come hungry so you can get your money's worth; and if you love seafood you should have no problem in doing so.  Keep in mind however, that while there are many foods here that are not seafood, if you aren't a seafood lover than it may not be worth it to come here as many of the other foods at this place can be found at other buffets that charge way less than here.",zUI2aJeqsRH0HSOqCMGmVA,0,0,4,0gu-BMRgucWRTWhyBiiaSw

The Food:
* The seafood variety is really huge, and the dessert options are top!  Many pastries, cakes, and ice cream.  It's a fat man's dream.  There is something for everybody.
* I can't believe that the sushi sucked, it was a huge let down.  It wasn't cut properly, and there wasn't much variety of sushi.
* The lobster tail and crab leg quality met my buffet expectations: 3/5 stars.
* Alcohol is available at additional cost.

They had a decent array of choices - from Asian to Cajun, crustaceans to barbecue.  My favorites were - of course - the crab legs and shrimp.  Those two alone made me a very happy camper.

The lobster tails were tiny, but they weren't dry or tasteless.  The fried crab legs in a spicy sauce were also very tasty as they were cooked in some kinf of Chinese five spice and the meat was not dry.

More good stuff - the clams and mussels in garlic sauce were tasty, shrimp tempura and CA rolls were good.  The grilled chicken was very tender and not over-seasoned.  Yay, they had good white RICE!

My husband and I paid $115, that was including tips. I wish I can give them zero stars. I'm a buffet fanatic and my husband is not a fan of buffets but he goes because he knows I love the variety. 

Our first round we got shrimp cocktail, oysters, clams, mussel, crawfish, crab legs, sausages

The only edible items were the shrimp, sausages and crab legs. Clams and mussels were bland, over cooked and dumped on ice. Oysters were also tasteless. The disappointing thing with the shrimp cocktails was that they are not big shrimp or peeled. For the price of the buffet that should be a given. Just like all the other premium seafood buffets. 

Their was seriously only about 20 different food options and that's not an exaggerated number. Disappointing when they charge $45 per person. All in all most of everything was overcooked and bland. I couldn't use enough cocktail sauce or Tabasco for some flavors.  

I didn't think it's possible to leave a buffet feeling hungry but I did tonight. What a waste of money! Never again will I eat here again. My husband said that we could've paid a little bit more for bacchanal at least they have more food to choose from!!! If you have any doubts about trying this place save  your money and go somewhere else. We felt so robbed leaving the place. Not sure if the people giving this 4 or 5 stars have ever eaten seafood when it's cooked correctly. Shame on you Rio!",ntT065DN9CIuhl8gGW2AAQ,0,0,1,Uq98BnmS2eADDRJTKWXgqg

Then went for prime rib and it was way overcooked. Had some crab legs that were small and you can get at any cheap buffet in town. And Ate some sashimi which was good.

But the rest of the buffet itself was very disappointing and should only receive 1 star based on cost and the expectations based on their advertisement.

My suggestion is to come early (4pm-5pm) to beat the crowd.

My recommendations:
- Prime rib: The meat was so delicious. I can compare this to prime rib restaurants.
- King crab legs: I believe this is a big hit for all the buffet goers. Although I don't like it as much as other people, and I did go a bit overboard with dipping the crab into the butter, I can see why people might like it.
- Tilapia: This fish was so delicious with the tomato sauce they served this in.

I wish I would have just gone here in that whole time slot we had.  It's seriously the best buffet I've been to in Vegas.  The crab legs were so juicy and meaty that how much I ate of that alone got me my wristband's money's worth.

The gelato desserts were my favorite and the service was up to par.  Our server was so attentive, we did not need to ask her for a thing.  She even gave us those shell crackers as soon as she saw our crab legs on the table.  I swear at one point, I was getting ready to put my finished plate down and she came out of no where and grabbed it before it even hit the table.  

I highly recommend coming here when visiting Vegas and you might as well get that wrist band to make your meals worth it because you can eat here probably an extra 2 more times for $45 versus a one time sitting for $30 with out the band.

I'd say, it's comparable to the other buffets. Plus being a seafood buffet should mean good quality and tasting seafood. I'd say, not to par.

Seafood to skip: raw oysters (not fresh; looked frozen and thawed), raw clams (sand), crab legs (mushy), lobster tails (non-existent), any cooked fish (overcooked and tough)

Seafood to get: Cold mussels, cooked mussels, cooked clams, scallops, shrimp creole

The seafood made up of less than 1/4 of the food available. Therefore, it was very misleading to be called a seafood buffet. But once I got past the whole seafood ordeal, the rest was enjoyable. The sashimi was pretty good for a buffet. And their meats and pasta were tasty as well. Best of all was their dessert area. I felt like a kid in a candy store! My eyes widened at all the trays of neatly placed desserts. And can someone please get me that gelato machine?!

$38 for a seafood buffet didn't seem bad. But after the meal, that price felt a bit steep.

Village Seafood Buffet came on high recommendation from several people, including Vegas natives, so I had to try it. It seemed like people had widely varying opinions of every single Strip buffet, so I eventually had to just give one a shot. Now, I'll be the first to tell you that while I love seafood, I'm not an expert. There were a couple things that weren't good, and I'm sure those crummy things rotate depending on the night. Today it was the Cajun Heads-On Shrimp. Super mushy. Not good. Otherwise, the selection was great, and the flavor was quite good. 
A few things I tried to find out and couldn't with reviews:
They offer lobster and several kinds of crab legs on weekdays as well. I don't know if anything changes on the weekends, but the selection didn't feel lacking on a Wednesday night. 
There is plenty of chilled crab legs, oysters, shrimp, etc. but there are also warm legs, which I personally prefer. 
The lobster is small, but hey, have as many as you want. They're just out there for the taking. 
A couple other learnings:
Don't tip ahead of time upon entry. No incentive to perform. The service from our waiter was poor, and the tip I'd already paid was not even close to being earned. We're not drinkers, and as soon as he found out we weren't, we hardly saw him again, even when we needed someone to fill our glasses or remove our empty plates. When he did finally come by, he wasn't friendly or personable. Sorry Jose, you lost Rio a star on this one. 
Finally, I suggest learning or reviewing how to eat crawfish beforehand. Still not sure how to properly eat those strange red insects.

Rio claims this to be the only seafood buffet in Vegas and even though it might be, I am not sure the amount of extra seafood selections can justify its 50 dollar price tag. On the other end, if you are local and have a total reward car (free), it is only $35 and that makes it a lot more attractive. 

They usually have snow crab legs, boiled mussels, Sushi/Sashimi (yellow tail, Salmon and Tuna WITHOUT RICE), craw-fish, lobster (big and small), shrimp (sucks i hate peeling them even if it was very easy), oysters, prime rib, and many other stuff that buffet lovers won't even touch. They are usually very fresh and there are times when their seafood are left out for too long. It shouldn't be a major concern since I go here almost once a month and I probably only had it once and they were replaced with fresh ones after I told the server. 

Everything else there is boring and sucks. Desert section is absolutely sucks compare to Wynn ($36) Bellagio ($36) and M Resort.

I love seafood!  This helps to fix a seafood craving but won't give you the tantalizing taste you are looking for due to the quality of the buffet food.

1 star = for the variety.  All kinds of seafood, cooked all kinds of ways.

2 stars = for the shorter wait than any other buffet in town; probably because it's also one of the most expensive

3 stars = for having other things besides seafood in case you get seafood sick.  They have fried goods, ribs, and other meats.

Lacks the 4th and 5th star due to the quality.  It's a hit or miss with the crab legs.  Some of them were big and juicy, and some were small and dry.  The sashimi is good,but the sushi selection isn't that great.

4011599,2014-05-14,1,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"This is the first time I visited this buffet hoping for good crab legs or decent crab legs and few others. This is probably the worst buffet for sea food from my standard.  We paid $97.27 for two people and I feel like I did something terrible.  I will break it down.

Food Quality: It's low high quality food. Crab legs were dry and hard to get the meat as they were smooching on the shell.  Lobster medley had one bad one that has gone bad which gave me the vinegary vile taste which I regret swallowing. 

Food Selections: They had Fried Seafood section, Cold seafood section,  Seafood soup section, Sushi and Sashimi, Baja Mexican(which was a joke), and Chinese Seafood(Had nice Crabs but once I finished the crabs they never brought it out again) and Desserts.  

Service: There is nothing to say about buffet service.  As long as they take your plates and drinks when you asked them.  They were pretty good about it during our visit.

Overall Opinion: It is important to know what to expect and what you are getting for the price you pay.  In my honest opinion, they are too expensive for the quality and selection they offer.  If you are not a foodie and don't care about the quality as long as there are selection and willing to pay almost $50 per person plus tip.  This is the place for you.  IF you are looking for decent and acceptable seafood selection I would recommend local Louisiana Crawfish and Crab places.  They don't have a lot of selection but you eat what you want to eat and you can average $30-60 per person by your choice of seafood.  

Suggestions if you want to Visit:  If you want to go I think you should go on the weekend when they have high food rotation so you can get fresh cooked seafood and hot crab legs. When Buffet is slow, you are going consume food that's been sitting there since the opening business hour.

If you see me checking into a buffet, it's usually due to friends/family are in town, it's comped, or I am desperately hungry. Having said all this, I've been to this specific buffet at least 50 times in the last 10 years.  Each time it's gotten worse and worse.  

When it comes to selection, there's plenty for everyone.  When it comes to taste and satisfaction, good luck with that.  I remember years ago where this was one of the better buffets.  Times have changed or my taste has change.  Either way, I don't see myself going out of the way to eat here.  Only reason we stopped here recently was because I had a friend from out of town with me, there wasn't a line, and we were both hungry.  

Rio's buffet doesn't compare to M.  I haven't been to Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, but I assume Rio doesn't compare to them either.  What made my most recent visit even worse was that my local discount didn't work on NYE.  

4 stars for cleanliness, no wait, and price was better than everyone else on NYE.  2 stars for quality.  Overall, 3 stars for Rio's Casino Seafood Buffet.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,2,3,X5HcwRhkBzUGjIN-3rxCVA

Crawfish, crab legs (both cold and warm... and they're different styles ex. tossed in an asian sauce), fish galore (ones in a chunky tomato sauce, shrimp tempura, mediterranian style, etc.  I will say, some had a fishy taste to it so after a while I just stuck to eating my ginormous plate of crab legs), hush puppies, sushi, seafood soup (2 types, a cajun style and another one I forget), you can make tacos, eat stir fried noodles with chicken and shrimp, they of course have shrimp cocktail, and mussels, clams, and oysters.

They have all kinds of seafood at their ""raw"" section: salmon and tuna sashimi, sushi, king crab legs, raw oysters, raw clams.  They were all very fresh and being from SF, I know what fresh seafood tastes like and this place was close enough because it had to be frozen shipped from other places.  It is hard to find this large of a selection of seafood at other buffets on the strip.

So why was this buffet not 5 stars??  Other than the seafood, the other selection was not as good. The meats and other stuff were mediocre and the dessert station had a lot of variety (such as the cool spinning gelato selector) but lacked something.

Soo bad for me, but mmmmmm -- I couldn't justify turning away trying these, b/c I didn't know when else I'd ever have available to me all these desserts which were seriously worthy of being listed separately on a menu, not just the crap desserts that get put out on buffets.

The fourth plate I did crab legs and threw some cheesy pasta shells in there because dang, sometimes I like to eat that too! 
I know they have other food there, like some mexican section and an asian section. There is a teeny produce section if you want a salad. And the mini-desserts were good too! 

Too bad the most recent reviews of this place are not so stellar because I did have a good experience. I may not make it back but only due to a personal preference - I had enough lobster on the same plate as the crab to have formed the opinion that I actually prefer crab to lobster, at least these small lobster tails, and I don't have to have both on the same plate again. I have done it once.

The infamous seafood buffet that I had heard so much about. All you can lobster, you can't go wrong, right?

It took me 5 minutes to find the lobster because nothing is labeled, so you don't really know what you're eating. I did a double take as someone showed me the lobster. It was fine, despite its size. I was just hoping for nicely cooked lobster that I could dip in butter. Silly me. The other dishes were okay, but nothing that sticks to my memory.

(There's only one other one that is pretty good and is off the Strip- Sam's Town.) When this buffet first opened, the lines were ridiculous.  If you weren't waiting in line by 4 pm, you'd be waiting for a very long time- seriously. I hadn't been in a while, until within the last few years with my husband- it's going to be an anniversary tradition.

The selection is amazing- broken into region types- Mediterranean, Pacific Rim, South America, North America. Langostino lobster (delicious), snow crab legs (a little salty at times but very good), dungeness crab (mmmm), oysters, peel and eat shrimp (with lemon and cocktail sauce- just like at the resident buffet, very good), crawfish (not a fan), sushi (I'll pass- sushi has to be eaten at a real sushi place), and soups (like chowder), just to name a few. The quality of many of the dishes is very good. 

The dessert station is not as big or impressive as the other resident buffet, but by that time, one has eaten enough, right? Ha-ha, just kidding. I usually save room for dessert. And given the choice, it's almost always ice cream or gelato, in this case. 

The last time we ate here, there was a wedding party of about 20 people. Seating is mostly chairs and tables, with some booth seating. The ambiance is much nicer at this buffet compared to the regular resident buffet, with artwork is cheeky- fish, but it's cute. The paint colors are warm neutrals, browns. It's not so crowded anymore, maybe could be due to the price. The service is pretty good- drinks refilled and the dirty plates are taken away. The food stations are clean and maintained/refilled. 

Yes, it can be pricey, but I think that this seafood buffet is actually worth it and not many seafood buffets in casinos are true seafood buffets, either. It seems like these casinos have shrimp and slap on a name, Seafood Buffet, but it's simply false advertising, in my opinion.

I had to take away a star for the following:
1. I like oysters, but their oysters were a. Frozen b. Looked like they were shucked weeks prior and c. Did not look appetizing at all

2. They're lobsters that used to be a LOT bigger are now the size of XL cocktail shrimp. Tastes like lobster, look like shrimp. Thought it was interesting.

3. Crab legs are my FAVORITIST thing in the world when it comes to buffets. VS Buffet, you completely disappointed me with OVERCOOKING them. It was so much work to eat them. Though the flavor was amazing, I just gave up after my 2nd batch, when I usually go for 3 or 4 batches of legs. *sad face*

- Poor food quality: frozen oysters, miniature lobster tails, anorexic crab legs, and super dry prime rib 
- Little variety: pretty standard stuff, nothing you can't find at other buffets 
- Unlabeled food: NOTHING was labeled - I had to guess what I was eating
- Messy buffet stations and awful presentation of food.
- Blunt taste
- Disappointing desserts: very little choice and taste was meh EXCEPT for the peach cobbler (i think that's what it was ... it wasn't labeled so I can't exactly tell you)

On the upside, the waitress (Cindy) was very helpful and nice. 5 stars for her and that peach cobbler! Everything else was poopy.

I was excited to try this place because of the all-you-can-eat crab legs and lobster tails. Not to mention all the other seafood delights. It was decently fresh for the most part. I'd compare it to what you might find at your local grocer. The steamed crab legs were good, nothing more. The lobster tails were little. I expected at least 4 or 5 oz. tails, but the ones they serve are probably 1, maybe 2 oz. if you're lucky. The flavor wasn't all that great on them either.
It was cool to see that they offered crawdads, scallops, different types of fish and shrimp all prepared in styles from around the globe. They had a Mediterranean section, Latin section, Asian section so that you could try seafood in many different styles and flavors.
The dessert bar was OK. The best offering it has is the gelateria - I got a cookies and cream gelato that was really yummy.
Overall Id' give it 3 1/2 stars for the good selection and decent tasting food. But for the price ($40/person) I'd just as soon have other Vegas buffets that are cheaper yet still offer pretty much everything the Rio does, except for the lobster, for $10 cheaper.",pgDVHBNHWkCV84j8PvJ0LQ,1,0,3,8iNpuCyYPgF5xURbC7Mzpw

It costs $39.95 per person. If the line is really long, you can pay $49.95, or ten dollars more, and get in the express VIP line and get in with little wait. 
This is what I did, because I was meeting some friends who were here 15 minutes before me because I was running late.

The buffet has a huge selection to choose from, and of course a lot of it is seafood. Their are king crab legs, several types of fish in various styles, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, clam chowders (New England and Manhattan), sushi, sashimi, etc. 

Of course, there are offerings that are not seafood, so the meat lover can get something to fill his/her tummy.

A lot os desserts or course, of all sorts. 

I would caution that you be careful with the shellfish,  as it is sitting under hot lights and if they don't move fast, well, you could get some uncomfortable gurgling deep in your gastro-intestinal tract.  The sushi seemed to move faster, so it seemed ok.

Sashimi station only had 3-4 kinds of fish and some sushi rolls, everyone seems to crowd around the crustacean line. For the cold stuff they had clams, mussels, snow crab legs, oysters, shrimps and scallops. The crab legs were SO salty I couldn't eat them. The cooked seafood were not done well at all. Either under seasoned or badly seasoned. The lobsters? If you expect Maine lobsters you won't find them here. I don't know what kind but they're tiny. Not helping that they nuke the crap out of the ""lobster"" rendered them tastless and rubbery. Some kind of cooked stone crabs with ok tasting sauce but you can tell the crab was not fresh because they were mushy. The Asian/Chinese section were disappointing as well. Dimsum? Oh my rubbery dumplings... The best thing were the raw scallops and  prime ribs. Scallops were good because they didn't cook it. Prime ribs was actually tender and juicy but then I can get it from Texas Roadhouse for half the buffet price and be twice as happy. Dessert selection was unimpressive. The only reason I even give them a star was our waiter.  He was attentive, efficient and worked really hard.  This place is seriously overpriced and under delivered. When you're paying close to $50 per person for a buffet your expectation naturally is higher. Their food isn't even comparable to my local Chinese seafood buffet which by the way costs less than half of the Village's buffet price.

This is mainly a seafood restaurant consisting of crab legs, mussels, shrimp, clams, craw fish and oysters. 

They have a fried section of seafood which include fried fish, clams, OYSTERS and shrimp. I loved the fried oysters because it's hard to find. Although I didn't mind, I wish they used a panko batter instead of the thicker southern style batter.

There's conventional buffet food like prime rib, fried chicken, veggies, but be warned there's not much! This buffet is tailored for seafood lovers and seafood lovers only. So if you don't like seafood, go elsewhere otherwise be expecting to pay a hefty price and not eating much.

Our parents like to act as if one plate is all you get, so don't get mad if you see those little Asian ladies stacking it up yay high on a single plate. The chefs will pile on more of it soon.

The line into this buffet can be long but what legit buffet entrance line in Vegas isn't? If you got the diamond or platinum rewards player's card, then hop in that VIP line. Muchhhhh faster. Seafood buffet dinner was about $40/head.

The service was really good. Our two ladies, one with the tag from Thailand, the other was Chinese were very very nice and prompt. They had a lot on their hands considering I brought the clan that day, a table of 13. So I give them mad props for making our time enjoyable even though it's a self served buffet.

In my opinion, the food is pretty good but it has slightly shifted downwards from when I first experienced it. They use to have lobster but even Vegas suffers when the rest of the nation is. Cut out some losses and X out some expensive shelfish off the menu is their answer. Still, plenty of different seafood to go around. Their prime rib is not too shabby either. Au jous sauce is slightly salty but the meat is tender fo sho.

I don't care if I'm at a seafood buffet, I love fried chicken. I gave it a shot. To my surprise, they were darn good. All was missing was some Texas style hot sauce.

Lastly, desserts... All I have to say is pistachio gelato. That's it. That's all you need. Two orders, maybe one for the road. I promise you, if you like pistachio, you'll thank me.

This place was pretty impressive! I was totally surprised. I usually don't give much credit to buffets (even in Vegas). I mean, you never know how long that stuff has been sitting there. 

They had all the seafood you could imagine... snow crab legs, crawfish, mussels, clams, RAW oysters, LOBSTER?? Craziness. I was a little scared of the oysters, worrying that I would get sick. So I picked the smallest, best looking oyster to try. AND... it was actually... GREAT! =O *gasp* I didn't take my chances at eating anymore than that. The other ones didn't look up to par. But I TOTALLY filled up on the mini lobster tails. I'm pretty sure my cholesterol took a good hit...

Shellfish + Melted Butter = Heart Attack

Another surprising goodie they had was their sashimi! Ive never had a really good experience with sashimi and sushi at buffets, but the fish here was really fresh! The sushi rice is a little hard, so it's best to just stick to the raw stuff. I really liked the salmon sashimi. =)

And of course, they have your basic carving station. The prime rib was REALLY good. And it was cooked a PERFECT medium rare. I totally loved it. And of course, they had Au Jus to go with it! They also had THICK, fall off the bone ribs, chicken wings, deep fried clam strips and shrimps... way too much food for my stomach to handle. 

And THEN... THERE WAS THE DESSERT BAR... O... M... G... I've never tasted a dessert bar like this one. I was prepared for dry cake, overly sweet frosting and chocolate covered everything. But no, no, no... THIS WAS THE BEST DESSERT BAR EVER! I loved their mini beignets. I tried everything... black forrest cake, chocolate mousse, creme brulee, carrot cake, fudge brownie cake... ALL FABULOUS. And they have a WHEEL of gelato! Coffee, mango, strawberry... you can choose from about 10 flavors. All were droolworthy. 

Another thing to mention, the service here is fantastic. All the waitress were super friendly and very prompt. They all had some personality rather than just picking up plates and running off.

Thus, my expectations for what Rio calls ""the only seafood buffet in Vegas"" is for it to be a spectacular and intense party in my mouth.  Did Rio meet my expectations?  Hell yeah... but it does miss its mark by just a bit.  (3.5 stars for this buffet)

This joint is one of two buffets at the Rio, and is arguably the more famous one.  When my sexy lady friends (including Angela Y. and Tiffany D.) told me about it, I was expecting it to be only seafood inside, but luckily there's more to it.  For $40 and a fifteen minute wait before seating, you get a large variety of foods that will be sure to hit any taste buds.

On the right side of the buffet, there are a lot of hot foods including pastas and even Chinese food (such as dim sum).  In the center masterpiece, you get all of the seafood options you'd expect from a Vegas buffet (grilled, steamed, fried, and of course- raw) along with prime rib.  Finally on the very left side, there is a large dessert area to end your meal on the sweeter side.

Tiffany D. and I became eating buddies, so we tackled the seafood first, and here were some hi-lights and low points:

[Cold Options]
1. Alaskan King Crab Legs - Decent... they were a bit small in my opinion, and took a long time for the workers to refill them afterward.
2. Sashimi - Tuna was rubbery!  Blech... the only decent option was salmon, and it's hard to get that one wrong.
3. Oysters - I piled all of these on my plate all at once.  They were a bit small for me, but weren't bad at all.

[Hot Options]
1. Fried Calamari - Not bad at all!  Although  the pieces of squid seemed a bit small for me, I was enjoying these small bites.
2. Lobster Tail in Sauce - I'll admit that none of the other buffets have this option.  The lobster tails were very flavorful and not too strong, however, there wasn't enough to go around during the evening.
3. Baked Salmon - Good flavors all around.  The herbs that cooked with it gave it an extra kick.

After plates of seafood and a slice of prime rib, it was time to dive into desserts.  The gelato here was incredible!  I haven't had much in my life, but these topped it.  The strawberry and coconut flavors were epic, and I remember tasting them again later in the evening after I had burped.  A must try!

So for the food I can give it a solid 4 stars (with a few exceptions), however, the service our night was horrendous!  Our waiter was terrible- we had to call him out after he passed us multiple times for our drink orders (non-alcoholic), and I swore that our plates of crab shells were uncomfortably piling up!  I've served before, and can understand when it is busy you can get caught up, but we felt extremely neglected the whole night there, even when it was not busy.

The Rio is definitely a must try, but my favorite Vegas buffet awards still go to The Wynn or the Buffet at the M Resort (off the strip).  Parking at the Rio was tough that evening, so be prepared to hunt down a parking space if you come.",mphvb6MRmPgnIT8pmU-x0w,5,2,4,WfBscoE1GcCtL7WM48zwtQ

There are truly many options to this buffet, but the price makes me ill just thinking about it!  Too much for even unlimited.  I realized too late that I was crazy.  For a few dollars more, I should have opted for the 24 hour, 6 buffet option.  This buffet is included in the list.  Had I purchased that, I could have eaten at this buffet at night, rested, ate at another buffet in the morning, did some afternoon activities, then ate at another buffet that afternoon, then rounded off my night with another buffet for hour number 23!  Run-on sentence, yes, but very logical still, frugal glee yes!  You live and you learn.  

The food on the buffet is decent enough to do the meal deal.  I don't understand gelato, but there is multiple flavors of that, along with many types of desserts to round off your meal.",5O0ejMUB7XHzyTf1rLu2zQ,12,5,3,8zjQLs6_2Zoo8CKsrjIRUA

So, my taste buds and moods were off.  I was running a fever that night, but I didn't wan to be a spoil sport.

This was really expensive as my mom treated our 4 families to this place.  There was a lot of seafood.  Debbie the server was SUPER great.  I give her a 10 star out of 5 stars.  She was perfect and had a super great attitude.  Jeannie was also the other server for our table of a party of 16.  She did her job and sort of had a bad attitude.  I give her a 2 star.  

As for the food, lots of variety of seafood.  But I was disappointed there were no soups, which is what I was wanting.  The lobster tails were so small, that I don't think they were like real tails or maybe on miniature lobsters.  I don't know.  A lot of seafood does not require a lot of cooking, so as they sit under the heat lamps, they further cook, thus making it hard or super chewy.  

Seriously, I think Red Lobster is way better.  I don't know how much my mom paid, but probably close near to $45/person for 12+ years old.  Some of the turn over of the food wasn't real quick.  Presentation of some of the stuff was fine, but maybe because I wasn't feeling well, nothing tasted good to me.

Some foods were really salty, while some had no taste and were super bland.  For as much as you pay for this buffet per person, one would expect it would be much better.  I was really disappointed and I will never come back.

The only saving grace was that Debbie was an awesome server with such a fantastic attitude and my mom's generosity to treat us kids and our families.  The wait to get into this place was quite long, but once we got up to the cash register to pay, they found us a table in less than 10 minutes for our party of 16.",53JHz4dbMg9JfuzakOZK4A,0,0,2,_C7Lb9RJqPXcg28lSoD3kA

We only pay $30 because we're locals. To the tourists who got sucked into paying $50; dunno what to tell you other than, sucks to be you, I guess. 

When we got there the first time, there was no line, but in times since, we've waited maybe 15 minutes, at most, and I've waited that long at an Olive Garden before, so in the grand scheme of things, not that bad. 

You can get soda or water, or for an upcharge you can get bottomless wine or beer.  They boast of lobster tails, and they are quite nice, but to be fair, they are not standard sized lobster tails, they're mini, but still good. In regard to the people complaining of the lobster, I've never been there when they were ""mushy"" or ""stale,"" and they refill the trays with new batches fairly often.   As for the other treats I enjoyed, they had an amazing salmon dish with a creamy cheese sauce, crab legs, oysters, sushi, shrimp, crab, and a slew of other items. 

The four plate max was more than enough, as I am uncomfortably full whenever we leave this place. My fiance and I are on a low carb diet so we come here to treat ourselves without getting out of control. 

I don't give it 5 stars because I still think it's a tad pricey, although we're locals and the food is good, I can get the same, or better quality fish for $25 at an all you can eat sushi restaurant.

2. The lobster tails were so small if you were not looking close for them you would pass them up. Funny but True.....

They do have tons of food, plenty of the small crab legs and everything tasted good to me, I guess I was just expecting more. I read a few reviews that they had King crab legs, but I guess they were not available when we went. (Bummer #1)

RIGHT NOW ITS 25% off FOR LOCALS WITH REWARDS CARD. SO it was $32.62 after tax!! Way better then the $45 it usually is right?? 

They do this buffet right small portions of hot food for easy turnover. Then the big portions are left for the good stuff like shrimp, crab, and lobster. I can't review the oysters, mussels, or clams because I usually will only eat those if I'm watching them be shucked. I don't wanna sign a deal with my toilet mmmkay.

They also had this linguine in white sauce with asparagus that I loved! 

The desserts are pretty good here, I had creme brulee, tres leches, raspberry coconut thingie, and GELATO the Elvis is by far one of the tastier gelatos I've had! Its banana, peanut butter, and strawberry jelly. SOOOOO good! My hubby who hates peanut butter even liked it! 

Our server last night whose name I don't know because he never told it to us was not excellent.

I only needed a spoon last night and the manager was right there so I asked and you know what I had no idea what to reply when he said who is your server, I told him the tall gentleman with the mustache.

The desserts were not good. There was a limited selection, and my sister, who was eating at the Carnival World buffet, saw them wheeling the fruit tarts from the Carnival buffet to the Seafood buffet. The fruit tarts were covered with FLIES. Ew. And I ate one too!

I can't say I know what everyone is referring to when they call this the best.  I certainly didn't think so.

YES, there was a variety of seafood -- crab legs, clams, mussels, oysters, sashimi (tuna and some other fish that was taken out of a air-sealed package marked from Taiwan - how fresh can that really be?!), shrimp, stone crab claws, crawfish, and tiny tiny lobster tails in a stir-fry dish.

NO, there was not much in the realm of quality! It was at average, at most!  A lot of dishes were overcooked.  Shrimp were mushy, some oysters had sand.  I tried a Cha Xiu Bao, and it was hard as a rock.  Tuna sashimi was stringy.  

The prime rib was good though.

Did I mention a meal here comes to about $45 per person? I thought Wynn was pricy!  But this was about the same.  Yes, there was tons of seafood options, but when it comes to seafood, I need good quality!

There was a great variety of desserts.  The gelato bar was awesome for buffet style quality - pistachio, dark chocolate, strawberry, melon, elvis (peanut butter), and moree!

Our server was very nice and attentive.  He kept on getting us drinks and emptying our garbage in the middle of our table.

This is the best seafood buffet I have ever been to in Las Vegas, hands down. I thoroughly enjoyed the jumbo prawns doused in a spicy, citrus glaze. The savory sauce blending with the melted butter, the succulence of the prawns, the beauty of the butterflied masterpieces... I could go on and on about those prawns. 

Some the other highlights; this is the only seafood buffet in Las Vegas that I've been to that serves lobster and it is surprisingly delicious. I also enjoyed the cooked crab legs, yes, they are not all on ice as some have stated. And lastly, the sushi was not half bad either, very enjoyable. Don't get me started on the margaritas. I skipped ordering one the first time and the second time I ordered one and wished I had not passed on it the first time. My buddy recommends it on the rocks, and I must concur.

All in all, this place is awesome with a worthwhile discount for locals. I expected this buffet to be okay, but after the first bite I was pleased. After a second and third bite I knew this was much better than store bought, let alone much cheaper, and was enthralled by that fact.

The worst mistake the Rio has ever done was to combine their seafood with their Carnival Buffet. I guess they realized Carnival was down on popularity and to add $$ to the cost they added a special section for seafood. Now don't get all happy now about heading to Carnival and expecting great seafood. 

The Seafood Village was reduced to a tinny section in the back of the Carnival that now offers nothing special to include cold fishes since no one is willing to pay the extra and they sit there all day. And why should you pay extra? The Carnival has crab legs now. The ""Seafood Buffet"" as it is now called, after they stamp your hand with a black light lobster and a lady checks your hand before letting you in, only offers shashimi, oysters, raw scallops and bread and other hot but cold things you can also get outside this VIP seafood area and through out the rest of the buffet.

The snow crab legs are a must and you HAVE to dip it in their garlic butter! Their regular crab legs are amazing as well, once again dip it in their garlic butter! If you come here, be prepared to eat many crab legs because it's so good that you don't want to stop. 

Besides crab legs, they serve sashimi and sushi and surprisingly, the quality of the sashimi is not bad for a buffet. They had an assortment of salmon, tuna, and tilapia. The tilapia sashimi was interesting since I never tried it raw but the salmon was delicious. The sushi chef could have cut it in equal sizes since they were of different sizes and the size of the sashimi does depend on how it tastes. Nonetheless, it was still delicious! As for sushi, they had spicy tuna roll, salmon maki, shrimp maki, kimbap (Korean sushi), and shrimp tempura roll. 

They also had raw oysters and scallops but definitely skip the oysters because they were not good when I went. The scallops, however, were pretty good. They had fried clam strips (MUST GET), fried scallops, fried calamari (tasted like mozzarella sticks, meh), and fries. Their grilled squid is AMAZING! It's so soft and flavorful, it melts in your mouth. Next to it, they have their prime rib which is hella good for a seafood buffet! 

Lastly, for dessert, their mini fruit tart is held together in chocolate and sweet cream, and it's so good! They also have yummy gelato in this cool looking freezer and  they have so many flavors to choose from (Thai tea, green tea, cookies and cream, etc.) The dessert section was definitely not lacking and was a wonderful completion to a delicious meal. 

Their service is also very friendly and attentive, our server continuously cleared out our waste bin and filled our waters. 

If you are ever in Vegas, you definitely have to come here for dinner or as a late lunch since they open at 3:30.

I was hesitant to pay almost $50 per person, but I told myself that if I ate 4 plates of food, I would get my money worth.  There just wasn't enough of a variety for ME to want to eat 4 full plates worth of anything. 

I went specifically for the crab legs and was turned off when the crab legs were frozen with ice, literally.  And had zero taste.  I then proceeded to get the hot, crab legs and they were flavored with something that tasted like terriyaki, but I would like to think that they would know better than to mess up crab legs with some terriyaki sauce.  So I will assume it was some unknown seasoning that was used.  Nonetheless, I didn't like it! Yucko!

Plate number three was dessert.  The most interesting thing for dessert was the gelato.  Which I discovered, I hate gelato!! All the other desserts weren't appealing to the eye so I stuck with a sugar cookie.  Boring, I know.

My fourth plate was full of random food that didn't even fill me.   Save your money!

I tried a little bit of everything. The duck was very good. and so was the fish. The cocktail shrimp was ok. The deep fried fish didn't taste like fish. A lady asked where the lobster was and when I saw it... I was surprised.. it looked like craw fish but a little bigger and a little bland. Definitely not the same as you think it would be when you think of lobster. Was ok but nothing rave about. The prime rib was ok but awfully salty. The dessert variety was good.

We were there on a Wednesday night-- a WEDNESDAY night- with some friends and there was still a long ass line!! I guess that should say something about the place right? 

Now what buffet doesn't serve endless amounts of crab legs these days? The question here is-- HOW FRESH is it??  Man oh man-- these Rio buffet people know how to do fresh seafood.  And much to my surprise--their lobsters (yes, I said lobster!) were super fresh along with everything else.  You almost forget that there are other food selections to choose from.

Remember in my review I said I found a long leg? Yeah, it wasn't a deformed one and it bothered me. Yeah I know this was a review months ago but I HAD TO figure it out as little shit bothers me. I'm very sad to know they did the switcharoo on us and giving us the cheaper stuff. 

Yeah looked at lobster fishing laws and yeah, I was right about them not being able to harvest lobsters of a certain size so it got me delving further......and so did more research and the lobsters they serve here are NOT the usual ""true""(american or spiny) lobster that we all are thinking of (they used to but not anymore). Look at the pale color and the fact that the flat shaped heads or legs are no where to be found which gives it away as a faux lobster or another suspicion is that it is flown in already ""prepped"" and possibly fresh frozen since the tails all had different consistencies- one okay one, one dry, on mushy, one chewy...wtf and then I stopped after that.

  Its a SQUAT LOBSTER.....a Squat is also called a ""langostino"". It normally is used in very heavy ""yum yum"" sauced sushi rolls and as a base to make soups and minced meat seafood products and are rarely used in pure tail form as its flavor and consistency is not as great as it's cousins. I also asked a fisherman who said I was correct in my research. 

Just thought to put that FYI out there incase people were psyched about All you can eat American/Spiny Lobsters. It's kinda a lobster still, but miles different.

I've been wanting to eat here for a long time and finally got my chance in Feb when I did the buffet of Buffets. It's $45 per person and you can eat at 7 different buffets within 24hrs. $15 Extra per person if you want to eat here. Great deal if you have the stomach and metabolism. 

They had alot of fish in many ways from Baja, Italian, Mediterranean, Ect...It was all good but for the price of the buffet you would have thunk they could debone fish right. I don't know how many times I almost spit out the fish so I wouldnt choke or have to be rushed to the emergency room. thats probably the only complaint I had.

They had tons of Crab legs, Shrimp and Mussels to choose from. Lox Galore too ;)

The ""Supposive"" lobster tail they had was good but they sure were small, plus they even cut them in half. They more looked like these huge prawns i can get in San Felipe, Mexico. But I loaded up on them anyways. It was mixed with regular shrimp too.

The sushi station was great. Tons of Tuna, Salmon and Halibut Sashimi ;) Can't forget the Kimchi.

The Gelato Station was AWESOME!!! I could have gone back there for hours. It was all great tasting. If you like Creme Brulee, you have to try theres. Very good. There desserts are way better than alot of the hotels in Vegas.

So overall I was pleased with my expierence but dont know if I would go out of my way to come back.",SS-fhzVj5nrfwAKm6iF-eA,8,5,3,5RodJl9VL4S9vFMrdhlDrA

I liked the fact they had salmon and tuna sashimi. The sashimi salad looked terrible, but it tasted better than it looked. Why did they have kim chi at a sushi bar? I do not know.  I tend to stay away from sushi at a buffet because they always prove to suck. 

The clam chowder was pretty good, but I didn't want to fill up on soup so I went for the other seafood dishes, but none really popped out to be outstanding. Tried the regular non seafood items and the roast beef was up to my standards and the bbq ribs was okay. Finally, I went for the warm crab legs and they were good as the usual. If time permitted, I would have sat there all night eating crab legs to get my moneys worth because everything else was so so or not great at all.

I hated the raw oysters, the stir fried baby octopus (too dry),  the clams were tiny and not that satisfying. I hate cold crawfish and the shrimps are do-able.

For dessert, they had an array of cute items. Most looked better than how they tasted. I like the raspberry mousse, crème brûlée, and the sorbets.

We planned to eat for 40 minutes and leave for our flight.. ended up staying for an hour and I wanted more because I felt bad we didn't finish all the food. I'm not a waster even at a buffet! 

They are only open for dinners and it's $40 per person. We were excited to see raw oysters but they were shucked and thrown together in the platter so there were bits and pieces of shells and the pile didn't look appetizing. We still plated a few that looked nice and they were okay. I really liked how they separated the cocktail sauce and the horseradish since I love a zing and my bf doesn't but in this case, he liked my sauce better. Like it hot don't you? Muhaha. 

My boyfriend got tons of king crab legs and those were both of our favorites. Very easy to break apart since they crack it for you beforehand. We got a few of stone crab legs and they were more difficult to get the meat out since the shell is like the name implies, like stone! Even though the shells were a little cracked, it still took a some elbow grease to get the meat out. Then we had to remove the cartilage before consuming the overcooked and sadly bland stone crabs.

I really liked a white pasta shell dish they made. It was covered with baked cheese and there was a little tuna and peas inside. Really lovely. I went back for another helping I enjoyed it so much. Near the pasta is a green bean, squash and broccoli dish that was delicious because it was mixed in butter. Way to be healthy right? Eat greens drowned in butter. Oh yeah!

DO NOT get the raw clams. I don't think people usually get them so they sat out on ice for a long time.. smelled a little rancid like dirty butt which is never a good sign.

Got a slice of the prime rib and I asked for medium rare. I usually get rare but this time, it looked too raw for me.. seriously too raw and I like it red! The medium rare was surprisingly tender and juicy. I quite enjoyed myself eating it! 

The desserts were really good. They have a strawberry shortcake that I love love loved and a great helping of fresh fruit. The eclair was a little too egg-ie and the custard a little too firm for my liking.. actually I noticed the other Rio Buffet had the same problem with their eclairs too. They probably make desserts at one location and send it to the other buffet to save time. Way to be efficient!

Overall, we enjoyed ourselves but the price was a little steep. If we weren't pressed for time, I would have enjoyed myself much more and not eaten like a pig while checking the clock. Sorry to the people who saw us eating!",ihqfOa0RpyhsU8zXOJpC_A,1,0,3,7YysST8ZUohC-jcBSIPMxQ

Take a hint from them, crab legs are awesome and the one thing that  gives this place 4 stars because man was this expensive. Still, probably one of the best buffets in Las Vegas, just be ready for a long line if you're there at lunch or dinner. 

Try their desserts, specifically the little cakes they have - much better than their version of sorbet although having  a server there made it a pleasant experience.",RuO6MMvKlcFG6h6WV4dUOA,0,0,4,E62dIHnJHETMvBzbiDnU0A

The rest of the buffet items were not that great. I felt bad for loading up little samples of every station of the buffet, taking only a bite and leaving it all out in the dust. Sorry for being a food waster!

The snow crab legs, clams, mussels, oysters, and many other sea creatures are prepared in various ways from simply raw to stir-fried to deep-fried. Each station has a theme representing different cuisines from all over the world. Stay away from the sushi rolls! The rice was dry and tasted like it was a day-old. And if you're not a fan of seafood, there are plenty of other land animals you can feast on like beef ribs, sausages, and prime rib.

And you can't leave the table without having some dessert! I FREAKIN' LOVE THE GELATO CAROUSEL!! Very whimsical and I felt like being a kid again screaming for excitement at an ice cream parlor. Again, I loaded up on some dessert goodies and only sampled a bite (eclair, tiramisu roll), but I polished the two mini cups of gelato (pistachio and cookies and cream). I love gelato! Our server also gave us a cup of coffee with our desserts, which made the dessert round 1000x better. The coffee was not too strong and very smooth. Bellissimo!

To recap:

5 stars on the sashimi, gelato, and coffee!
2 stars on the rest of the buffet items.

They are not lobsters.  I think what they are serving is langostino, and, after I brought a couple of them to my table, I could not eat them.  They were mushy and tasteless.  Do not believe the hype that they serve lobster, because they do not.  They did offer very large crawfish, which would have been terrific for this Louisiana native; however, someone (please!) needs to teach the chef how to cook them.  They had no seasoning and were bland and again nearly tasteless.  The crab legs were skinny sticks, and there were NO oysters.  All in all, the food was not EVEN mediocre, and the service was awful.  We originally added a 20% tip when we paid for the buffet, but we cancelled the tip and left a few dollars.  Casinos are raking in a lot of money.  They could at least offer decent buffets.

Mounds of king crab legs, slipper lobster, cold and fried shrimp, cold and steamed clams, raw oysters on the half, green and black mussels, a sushi bar with fresh sashimi, loads of desserts and although there is no frozen yogurt machine as one reviewer pointed out, there is a homemade ice cream bar. There is also a selection of hot favorites, including: prime rib, chinese food dishes and stew/jambalaya/gumbo dishes. 

The only downside is the line, both inside and out. You can count on waiting at least 30-45 minutes to get in and then once you begin your feasting, you will notice that the actual buffet lines begin to get deeper. Sometimes you can wait in the food line for close to 20 minutes.

Desserts: Creme Brulee was better than most buffet's creme brulee. 

Sashimi: tilapia smelled a tad fishy, tuna was EXCELLENT in flavor, smell, appearance (a lot fresher than tilapia). The rolls weren't that great .

5255924,2014-12-21,1,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"Decent, but not worth the price paid. Didnt hate it but wouldn't come back. Lobster tails were actually langostinos. False advertising and a real let down, but there were some good points.

Pros:
- lobster bisque is really good. More cheesy textured and sharp flavored than most but that's how I like it
- salmon sashimi was excellent
- in the Mediterranean section they had a seafood bouillabaisse of some sort that was spicy and flavorful and was my favorite. I don't usually eat pasta at these but I made an exception because it was that good
- big crab legs cut in half for you for easy eating. Not dry, they're actually quite flavorful and good.
-cold scallops are buttery smooth

Cons:
- expensive for what you're getting. We joined the card club and saved a whopping 2 bucks on a $100 tab. Woo hoo.
- most of the sushi was icky, salmon was good but tempura shrimp was rubbery, hamachi was too tough to eat and came in a vacuum sealed pouch that looked more like tilapia, and the tuna had all these tendons in it. Stick with salmon and California rolls.
-gelato was more like shave ice in texture, not my favorite 
- most of the fried things were too salty and rubbery
- the biggest con of all, the false advertising of the ""lobster""s. they were langoustines. I'm seeing photos here and nothing even remotely like that was available when I went, it was an inch and a half long at biggest. I kept seeing advertisements saying lobster lobster lobster. Asked staff ""where's the lobster?"" And sent us to a vat of tiny shrimp sized tails swimming in a misc. butter sauce.

If you want to just power down the crab legs, go for it, but I still don't think even then it would be worth $45/person. I guess that's Vegas for you.",1CtHuzZDw13yZfl_CpJCrg,4,0,3,InbY_QeG9B0raB5KC84VRw

Long story short, the crab legs had no flavor and were cold (supposed to be the hot ones). The mini lobster tails were just as bad and didn't even taste like lobster. The shrimp was bland and could have been cooked a little longer.

I mean how many other places give you all you can eat oysters, small lobsters and the such. Everytime we go now, either with my folks, my GF or my friends, we always try to stop by and eat there. The last two times I went to Vegas, back in Feb 08 and Dec 07, the place was closed for renovations, sadly sadly we had to leave bootiful LV without exepriencing the spot.

We went to LV in mid August, and one of the places we were looking forward to goto was this buffet. We got there really early around 4:30 or 5ish the reason being is that we had a show to catch around 7:00 at the Wynn and we had a very light breakfast. I remember the last few times we went, the line was always long as heck after 6:00, about an hour or so wait. But this being 4:30-5ish, there wasnt a line at all. There were already people within the place eating and such.

The place isnt cheap let me tell you, $40 or so, not including tip. We sat down all excited about the oh so delicious food we were about to eat. Let's just say that we werent dissapointed, but we were raving about it so much so after we left. They still have the same basic staples that they have had forever, raw oysters, small lobster tails, fried everything, prime rib, etc etc. 

The place just didnt seem like it offered the same quality as before. They did do a remodel of the place but it was nothing worth noting. The selection seems to have shrank, there is more ""filler"" food than before now. In the asian section they used to do the small lobster tails with a slightly tangy spciy sauce, but no more. Now it was just reg. chinese buffet food you can find anywhere. 

The service was fantastic! The waiter we had was on top of things, such as clearing plates, drink refills, etc etc. Let me tell you, i can consume a whole lot of liquids throughout the course of a meal, maybe about 7-8 cups worth, no exagerration, just its always been that way for me. He was always making sure that my cup wasnt empty and that everything was taken care of. i think that is what brought this place to 3 stars.

The food quality has gone down a bit, the selection has drastically gotten smaller and smaller. I guess we just wont be going to this place anymore, might as well spend the $100 at one of the Oyster Bars i have seen other Yelpers talk about here. 

The one highlight at the end of the meal was the ice cream, if you like pistachio as much as i do, oh boy will you enjoy the ice cream!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYl2MEs5bjI

The Village Seafood Buffet is located at the other end of the casino floor. 

The lines could get very long between 7 and 8pm. 

As for me, I got there around 7:30 on a Thursday evening and waited about 20 minutes. The price for dinner was $45, so about $15 more than Carnival World Buffet.

There were a lot of seafood options to choose from as you can see from my video.

To be honest, I really went there for the AYCE lobster, I was hugely disappointed that it was so freaking tiny (see video). They didn't serve Maine lobster instead they served Rock lobster. If you guys don't know, Rock lobsters come from the Pacific ocean and has no claws, whereas Maine Lobsters come from the East coast with claws. Anyways, I still ate a whole bunch of tiny-halved lobster tails to ensure that I got my money worth.

They serve a lot of clams, mussels, and crawfish that are not served at Carnival World Buffet.

Overall the food was good not great. I believe this is the only place in Vegas that serve AYCE lobster.

His woeful monologue went like this: 

""They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib --
magnificent meat, beautifully  marbled.. Then they started
throwing it in these big  cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
I looked in, an' it was turning  gray. I couldn't f**king believe
that one.""

In my case, it wasn't just the prime rib, but the crab, mussels, shrimp, oysters, fish, scallops, etc. Either way, I couldn't believe it either, Chef....couldn't effing believe it. 

I can't help but feel that the chefs here must feel the exact same way, bearing witness to the defilement of gorgeous seafood. Much of it tastes as if it has been over-boiled, over-frozen, and over-neglected, rendering 99% of it inedible, useless rubber.

When this buffet first came out, I was willing to stand in line for an hour just to eat here. Now, even with the locals 25% off special, I doubt I'd ever come back. The lobster tails went from big and juicy to small and dry. Speaking of dry, that word could be used to describe most of the seafood. A lot of the pictures are a little old and show the buffet at its prime. If you're thinking about eating here, I'd suggest going in and seeing the selection for what it is now.

**Notes**
       - Lobster Tails - With the exception of the sterling brunch at Bally's, this is the only buffet I know that serves lobster tails.
       - Before - When this place first opened the lobster tails looked like this: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=QHfhDsVRRPcvMzfGDCoBqg
       - Now - Now the lobster tails look like this tiny thing between the clam strips and the scallops: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=AmMOM91RYw_ALKAux1l0AA
       - Crab Legs - They have both hot and cold crab legs. They are definitely larger than the crab legs at the Carnival World Buffet. However, the hot crab legs were dry and the cold crab legs...well, are cold.
       - Oysters - I grabbed two oysters and I could only eat one. They tasted like they'd gone bad.
       - Crawfish - Dry and not fresh.
       - Sashimi - They have salmon, white fish, and tuna. The only fresh seafood item I could find (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw?select=T4iokj7Ei9oH2fJ1YpzUdA).
       - Prime Rib - I actually never had this here, but it's there.
       - Desserts - The desserts are really good. They have a spinning gelato wheel and some of the higher end desserts you'd expect like creme brule.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place at its current condition. If they bring back the quality they use to have, I'd easily pay $50. However, I doubt they will.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,10,0,1,41n_jGV37VWh3S1I6Lb21A

Negatives are that the raw oysters are covered in ice and most are half frozen with chunks of ice within the shell. Clams are just cheap bottleneck clams and muscles are generic. People say that they offer lobster tails but don't be fooled they are the cheapest and smallest tails that I have ever had. The total meat on one tail is about the size of your thumb. You can get as many as you want however they don't have a succulent taste that is expected with lobster tails. The prime rib was pretty good but the two pieces I had were fairly fatty. 
Positives are the sushi bar is made fresh and they have large pieces of fresh tuna and other whitefish. Soup is really good with jambalaya, chowder, and bisque. Also the salmon was very tasty. The desert section was fairly good but the gelato bar had sub par gelato quality. 
If you are in the rio the world buffet is a better choice unless you love seafood and want to try all they have. I in fact love seafood but many buffets like the Wynn, and Bellagio offer better lobster and overall better quality dishes for the same price.

the good:
*  lots of selection and broken out by cuisine style
*  clean
*  good customer service
*  the desserts
*  reasonable price for a seafood buffet ($42 after tax)

the bad:
*  the raw fish (sushi, sashimi, some of the ceviches, and oysters) was just plain poor quality.  like, C- grade seafood.  ugh, especially the tuna.  
*  the fried fish (calamari, shrimp, catfish) was mushy.  not overfried, but like it wasn't cold enough before being put in a fryer.  weird texture.
*  the steamed crab legs were overcooked.  crab legs are delicious, so the taste was still good, but again, the texture was bizarre.

the mediocre:
*  everything else.  

like i said, there were a lot of things to select from at this buffet.  interestingly, the duck was really effin' good.  but, it definitely did not live up to the ranting and raving i'd heard about it.  yes, there are seemingly limitless amounts of some of the finer things in life, like lobster, crab legs, and other delicacies... but just because they are plentiful does not ensure that they are good.  that was my experience.  

the desserts were spectacular for it not being a dessert place.  i mostly highly recommend the mini strawberry shortcakes and mini chocolate cannoli.",hWmvod0Ypt6GpoYqARxRaA,0,0,2,iP7iF_Zj-I4pqSXbuNoqCQ

Over the years, the buffet has remained relatively the same. Some changes I've noticed in the last few visits include: the elimination of nigiri at the sushi station and replacing it with just sashimi, street style tacos in the Mexican section, and the addition of one or two types of ceviche.

Prime rib, sushi, peel and eat shrimp, and crab legs are a must for me. The oysters on ice are all roided out but I don't touch them because they usually don't look too good and I don't feel like rolling the dice. Other than that there is plenty of selection for the seafood lover.

Wow, a very diverse range of reviews for this place here on Yelp.

Honestly, it's as good as a Seafood buffet can get. Seriously.

Think about it. It's impossible to have the best cuts of sashimi, the finest lobster tails, the sweetest shrimp, the tastiest oysters, etc. for a buffet that people pay $30 to enter. If you're expecting Nobu-quality fish or fresh-from-Maine lobster tails at a buffet, you deserve a punch in the face.

For what you pay, the food is more than adequate. Much more in fact.

There is definitely a difference between the oysters here vs. all the other LV buffets. They are fresher & also 95% detached, enough so that a light nudge with your fork fully detaches them, ready for enjoyment. The sushi/sashimi is a cut above (pun intended). Essentially I found most everything was very good & compared favorably with the various and numerous competing LV buffets.

Quick tip: there's a marinated steamed shellfish mix towards the outer ends of each side; there are mini lobster tails in this melange of shellfish. Easy pickings, and grabbing 4-5 of these tails is basically your $30 back.

Do NOT forget the ""Elvis"" gelato for dessert. Thank me later.",eXEyNOp2H_itIXUoX4tldQ,0,0,4,Aeo_pLcVclfvVoMlb7wQWQ

I love lobster but the last time I ate here it was overcooked.  The time before that it was cold.  The vultures eating there are pigs and often spill the drawn butter or make a mess of the lobster area.  Also, often times you have to wait for more to come out.

I will say that other than the lobster, the rest of the seafood usually tastes great but the bottom line is, if I am going to pay that much for buffet food, it better be darn good. Otherwise, I could just go to Joe's seafood or something similar and get my lobster prepared much better.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,7,4,3,OBamYv9K_so-n7pdLExSZg

The shrimp part was true, the crab legs were skinny minnies, and there was a tray of cooked little lobster tails (looked more like big shrimp than anything).

Food: It's ok and can do the job if you know what you're picking at.  I got the prime rib and had him cut thin slices for me and it was a perfect medium rare.  The crab legs should be easier to eat and cut for you, but it's not.  The wonton noodles were garbage.  There is definitely a huge variety, but like I said, you gotta pick and choose wisely!

5606402,2008-11-17,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"Okay, here is the only review you need.  I have been going to this buffet for more than a decade, possibly since its inception when the cost was $16.99, and also hold platinum membership at the Rio.  At that time the lobster and crab legs alone made this place for worth the cost. Then the cost went to $19.99, $24.99, 29.99, and $34.99.  All the while the quality increased at least in proportion with the cost. They added clams, an entire sushi bar, and always had high quality, fresh seafood no matter the preparation.  So, I recently visited once again in March 2008 to find that the buffet was under construction. I was disappointed since this is one of the reasons for my travel to the Rio. However I understood it was probably going to be a nice upgrade so anticipated a subsequent visit. I traveled to this RIo, stayed in an upgrade suite, and went to the buffet that night of arrival. Good night! MAJOR DOWNGRADE. Sushi bar cut in half as to selection, and freshness gone. Lobster - absolute disappointment! They were as small as crawdads and my company mentioned that they were in fact crawdads, and NO I did not mix them up with the crawdad section. Crab legs? Smaller than average and dirt and grime all over the shells, like they were just caught out of filthy infested waters. They upgraded the furniture like some sort of modern city joint - not the nice homely place it was. So to sum this up the buffet is worth $24.99 - not a dime more! Poor quality and lower than average. Better food at Todai, or Onami - franchise type seafood buffets. Side note - rooms poor quality, so overall perhaps this was recessionary effect.",J9f_yKNkjfl3MYSLmIExuw,1,0,1,Um0dZ15czuiq1jpcbO9mhg

Lauryn Hill said it best in her song...U might win some but U just lost one is dang right.  

I used to rave about the seafood buffet at the Rio but last night's mediocre dinner and unprofessional staff proved how much the Village Seafood Buffet has FALLEN OFF.  They changed the interior design to make it look nicer but for the first time ever - NO LONG LINE!  For a Sunday night it was empty.

Even though the decor LOOKED updated  the taste of cuisine quality sank low.  The steamed crab leg was still delicious but everything else was CRAP.  Mediocre sushi, dried out rice/noodle dishes, salty salty fried food....Hometown Buffet quality food for $49 was a slap in the face.  What happened?  =(    It's sad.   Don't they know that with all the new buffets at the Wynn, Cosmo and others brand new spots they have to do MORE and be BETTER than ever?!?!  I spent $100 for 2 dinners that was horrible.

The desserts here used to be really good but it tasted different.  My favorite chocolate cup with vanilla custard and fruits was bland.  The creme brulee was grainy and mushy.  WOMP WOMP WOMP =(  FAIL.

I even had to complain to the Manager about their staff.  The girls working behind the dessert bar straight YAWNED in our faces and blatantly ignored us when we tried to get their attention.  The prime rib station guy was missing all night and kept going to the back to chat with the other workers.  The Manager didn't do anything for us (didn't expect it not surprised) but thanked me for my comments.  Note to the manager:  you should always offer a discount or rain check for another visit when you have an unhappy customer.  We're only trying to help.

first off... who cares if its $40, it's definitely worth every penny. Although I probably don't eat 40 bucks worth of food, its yummy :D the last two times I've been in Vegas I've eaten here. Their seafood is fresh and delicious! You know how sometimes you eat seafood (particularly crab legs) and they are salty as hell? the crab here is sweet and oh so good! I actually stick to the crab claws only. @#$% the rest of it xD jk. but honestly 90% of what I eat here is just the crab claw. I think I might be psycho but I don't eat them with butter ;[ I find that nasty... so I just eat them by themselves.

The desserts here are so cute and pretty! Tasty as well. I think they also have a gelato machine thingy here. 

ps: skip the chinese food part of the buffet. you can eat panda express another time :3 go for the seafood

oh I forgot to mention. If you are hungry... get in line about an hour before you think you will be hungry because that's how long the wait is. but in the mean time they have that weird show in the rio where they fly around in floaties and throw beads at you lol. also the customer service is is superb! the waiters always come around and refill your drinks as well as toss the waste basket thing for your crab shells, etc",6PTAAhsFt64ycG5oGmEJBA,0,0,5,Tj6-BYPujBEq3sPsKwx7fg

From the oysters, to the shrimp, to the sashimi, to the crab legs to everything else...all good. Except for the mini lobster tails which were over-cooked and rubbery but hey, dip that summamabitch in some melted butter and lemon and it's on.

Prior to that, we stopped by one of those ""Half Price"" booths (the one by Ross on the strip) and only paid $28 for our seafood buffet. If you've read my review on Barona's buffet, you'll know I'm here for the seafood and dessert only. I limit my carbs to a minimum at these places as I need to save precious stomach space for the good stuff.

The shrimp was delicious as were the fresh steamed crab legs. I laughed out loud when the greedy bastard in front of me hogged the not-so-empty tray with a smug smile on his face, only to have them bring out a fresh new tray for me and the folks behind. He had that ""aaaw maan"" look on his face and ran to the back of the line for more since I refused to relinquish the serving tongs. Dude, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet so relax, they'll bring out more. 

Hubby always laughs at me because I don't ""eat-as-I-go"" but instead create a big pile of of crabmeat as to eat without interruption. The waiter almost took away my plate since I got up to get more lemon, but stopped when I said, ""wait, I just put in about 7 minutes of labor getting that crabmeat out of their shells!"" much to his amusement. 

We finished off our meal with creme brulee, gelato and other confections that were almost too pretty to eat. Afterwards, dance off your gut at Voodoo Lounge. That's only IF you can fit into your clubbing clothes afterwards.

Our group of seven arrived at about 8pm and it was nice to see a pretty well-known buffet that didn't have a ridiculous line to get in. The buffet seemed smaller than I expected, and the seating area is not as vast as the others, but I LOVED this buffet! 

I am a huge fan of the oysters on half shell, crab legs (both chilled and steamed), the crab claws, shrimp - sooo easy to peel and delicious! The day we were there the oysters seemed to be replaced and refilled relatively often, so to me that was a good sign. Yum yum yum! They keep the raw stuff pretty chilled so no worries on that! 

For those non-raw fans, there is a pretty decent amount of food that is cooked including prime rib (tasty!), grilled fish, among others. 

GELATO bar and pretty decent selection of dessert. However, when we wanted more crembrulee there was NO MORE!! Very disappointed :( So if you're a fan, grab your crembrulee earlier in the evening!

Sadly, I was very disappointed by the quality and selection of seafood.  My friend and I got the Buffet of Buffets card and did the $15 upgrade to get into this place.  Honestly, if I had to do this over again, I would ONLY go there if I had the Buffet of Buffets card and paid the extra $15.  It's definitely NOT worth the $40 or so they charge.  If I'm going to pay that much for a seafood or buffet by itself, I would go to the Bellagio or Wynn hotel instead and pay the extra $10 or so more it costs there for the better quality.

We got there at 8 pm on a Friday night, and we waited about 10 minutes in line, and then another 10 minutes or so to be seated.  Overall, it wasn't a long wait.

Once we got in, I did a scope of the entire place and went directly to the hot seafood.  There, I found very small halves of lobster tails (about 3 inches long, 1/2 inch wide) each.  Of course, we grabbed a bunch of it.  The redeeming factor was that there were large, plump and crispy (which means they were fresh) shrimp in that mix of lobster tails.  There weren't many, but I picked out a lot of the ones I saw.

Then, I went on and got some oysters.  To my sad disappointment, they were frozen and thawing.  I could tell, because they had ice on them, and when I ate one, they were partially frozen.  They were okay, considering this is the only buffet I went to on this trip (along w/ Paris and PH) that even had oysters.  Once thawed, it smelled and tasted clean, though nothing very exciting.

Honestly, those were the only seafood worthy things I ate.  The crab claws and long crab legs were just okay.  You can tell seafood isn't good because it's mushy.  Fresh seafood is plump, crispy (for shrimp and lobster), and juicy.  The only fresh thing I ate was the shrimp in the lobster tail mix.  Other cold shrimp elsewhere were pretty small and didn't look appetizing to me.  I don't like seafood cold, honestly.

Anyway, the only other redeeming thing about this place was the variety of desserts.  But even then, they were good, but not great.  

If you're okay with just getting small lobster tails, a few plump shrimp (there weren't many in that mix), and some once frozen oysters, then this place would be worth your extra $15 to add to your Buffet of Buffets card.  But by itself, it's not worth it.  Most buffets offer the cold crab legs, if you want that.

but if you are just wanting crab legs and oysters... this place would be fine! i dont remember the price difference but this one is way less packed than carnival.... so if you want to avoid massive amounts of people on a busy vegas weekend... come here instead... its just on the other side of the casino.

also... try the gelato with any of ur favorite toppings... its to die for!

So here is my take.
It is listed as one of the top buffets for seafood. At 45usd a person it's pricey. It advertises lobster, which they do have. They are tiny and are 1/2 tail portions of what I think are warm water lobsters. They were soggy, cold, and very few, I found, to be appetizing. This was a disappointment. 
The crab legs at the beginning were old, soggy, and not very good. Finally more were made and the quality vastly improved. 
The other food areas had a nice assortment of fish and pastas. 
Was it worth 45 bucks? I'm going to say no. I think it was way over priced for the quality. Was it good, yes, overall I did enjoy it.",XmTe9ZVkfR34G_9FySEJqg,4,0,3,OxEO1W4YsV5wBghC81pC0Q

I usually get a plate of them, then fork out of the meat before enjoying the meat. I'm allergic to the crab legs, but my friend had a fest with them. 

Parking: The Rio hotel has plenty and they have shuttle from their other hotels on the strip. 

Price: $39..$41.something after tax and comes with non alcoholic drinks.

I did however love the selection of oysters and mussels, green mussels being my favorite and loved the freshness of the nigiri at the sushi bar, particularly the salmon which is one of my absolute favorites.  It was cut nice and thick, was fresh and yummy.  

They also had a very good cold calamari salad and some good pasta dishes.

The dessert bar however, was AWESOME. Loved everything, especially the Elvis Gelato (PB&J +Banana).

So my parents had 2 free passes, free makes the experience even better.

DO's

I hate crab legs because it's so much work for a tiny piece of meat. So I'll only eat 1 or 2 drenched in butter sauce. But if crab legs are your thing, it's fresh here.

Go for the lobster tails! I ate like a pound of those. Easy to peel and eat.

Being a big fish fan, there's so many kinds of fish here. Swordfish, salmon, tilapia, etc. I went fishing and enjoyed it all. Baked, steamed, fried. 

Shrimp cocktail is excellent

Spinning gelato bar is awesome. Gelato selection and quality is great. Pistachio is my favorite. The cantaloupe one tastes like smushed fresh cantaloupe.

DON'T

The sushi is typical buffet sushi. It's been sitting there and the rice is dry.

The Chinese dim sum is dry. However the pork buns are pretty good.

The utensils were also dirty or have very heavy water stains, which were still nicely wrapped in a napkin.  If you want real lobsters, you will have to have a coupon or pay extra for it. The tiny lobster and shrimp dish was good, but overly salted.

The Chinese food, were not very good (dim sum station's steamed shrimp dumpling had really thick doughy skin; the food looks like it has been hot-held for hours or just overcooked). The Japanese sushi station had just the low end selection of tuna, salmon, California rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls and a few other, but definitely nothing fancy or higher end). The prime rib and tri-tip station is hit and miss, depending on if you got there when they have the left overs or new roasts.

The dessert station had a fair selection of sweet treats, but due to understaffing, the guests soon empty the dessert selections and it was a long wait to individually order desserts from the staff manning the pastry station.

I do like the decor and the spacious design of the dining area, although it is relatively small compared to the buffet at the Wynn or Bellagio.

In my opinion there are far better values at other Strip buffets. So it is cool to try once and check it off of your Vegas To-Do list, but I doubt I will vote to go here again in the future.

I am not sure if my expectations were too high but I was underwhelmed by the experience. The sushimi was very good, as well as the lobster pieces. The oysters were immersed in ice and chunks and pieces ruined them. The crap legs were nice and butter warm. 
We opted to pay the extra for unlimited wine - worth it!  
Overall enjoyable but I am unlikely to return.",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,2,2,3,hkRPcpWQbt7McGXUq1KRqQ

They also have different cuisines. Not too much but just enough. They also have unlimited lobster tail, oysters, jumbo shrimps...ugh..too full. They're desserts were also delish. A large variety of macaroons! Our waitress Debbie was also very sweet and remember everything I had asked for. Will definitely recommend for those looking for a buffet in Vegas!",gfrJ-ZpC1Gg0vX6sNLZRfw,0,0,4,DTmKw2_F-lvr5ozWKgmWqw

Nothing was fresh, the crab legs were dry/aged/rubbery. The service was good, and I don't want to discredit their work and service but the food was garbage. Now I am full, but still feeling hungry because none of my taste buds were satisfied.",OT29Nj0_xMCU33QV4ok9-w,1,0,1,SSU7wWNAFAJUZ8Abp6W0TA
5982207,2009-06-23,0,rvnTFEq7R2ZHg0_CYbBNFw,"This place used to be my favorite buffet spot in Vegas cos they have Alaskan King Crab, too bad they only serve snow crab now. 
I love seafood and sashimi, so $38 is a good deal for me to have all you can eat crab leg, oyster, clams, baby lobster tail and sashimi. 

They have craving table and some other hot food, but I never have room for that.

I'm not a dessert people, but you got to save room for the flan and gelato. yum yum. 

Plus you can always enjoy the free sky show before or after your meal.",8OdNA17IEmZca7sNvyh0Gw,0,0,4,f7LIps_vSGbw6HTdWE6SNw

We had $5 off (Diamond status) and yet it still was nearly 90 bucks BEFORE gratuity. In my book, that's just a little too extravagant for a buffet. I mean really, who can eat $44.50 worth of any type of food? Not me, that's for sure! They have a wide selection of seafood, meat and poultry as well as shashimi and a gelateria. If ""money be damned"" is your personal motto than by all means, go for it. Otherwise save your cash for gambling and try BK's Burger Bar.

I was told this was the best buffet for the money. I disagree.
