Twice now, Victoria has said fewer than 3 words to us, looked at our empty drinks for 30 minuets, and gave us that ""you're not good enough"" vibe. Comp'd nothing after a fair amount into the machine. We'll come back, just gotta choose your nights unfortunately.",6Djopjpy_KAp3RtSnC4Kkw,3,0,3,OKsQa5NGJzNPv9B5ugz-dw

1839328,2017-12-10,0,k_luboaCkZRUo5KL7phVvQ,"It just opened two weeks ago near our neighborhood.  The wife and I decided to have Saturday morning breakfast.  Once we walked in we were welcomed by the staff with a good morning greeting.  The place was spotless.  Our waitress was DeAun, she was very friendly greeted us, told us of the breakfast specials, told us how to join their Reward Club called Beer & Bites, all types of ways to win money, prizes, drink and food specials.  WE ordered, the wife had a stack of pancakes and me, steak and eggs, the food arrived quickly, steak cooked to perfection and the pancakes were stacked high, pretty enough to take a picture and delicious, coffee was good and hot and we never worried about refills, DeAun made sure our cups were full. We loved the food.  DeAun the waitress was a hit with us, very friendly and personable.  She really was easy to chat with and she made it a point to get to know us, she answered any and all questions we had and during our stay we found out a little about her.
We will definitely be return customers, I'm a sports fan they have plenty of TV's add to that a friendly staff and good food and drinks plus it's less than 5 minutes from our residence.  PT's Gold is a hit.",ePmANGkTI2ikdmLuSrQUwQ,0,0,5,2uYSRxHAR2bF3OSrR0cp4Q

I ordered the Club wrap, my husband ordered the Cheese Steak and we ordered chili cheese tots. My wrap was disgustingly salty and the mayo was warm and gross. I was sadly and extremely disappointed. My husband opened his Cheese steak and let's just say the sight of it threw us off. He said the cheese steak was ok, but he was upset that he paid extra for onion rings and only received 6, yes 6 onion rings.

The chili cheese tots were the best and that's not saying much. All of the chili and cheese was on one side and there wasn't very much to begin with. 

Ps, I had my husband taste my wrap just in case my tastebuds were out of whack since I am 30 weeks pregnant and he confirmed that it indeed was.

The bartender yelled from across the room saying that he/she were the only persons their and that we needed to sit at the bar or place an order with them. The last time I was there the bartender was visibly upset do to the lack of staff. There should be more focus on customer service, staffing. On many occasions that I have been to this bar the Male bartenders are fixated on having conversations with female customer's  and do not check up on others in a timely manner, I have also seen customers walk out because they are not tended to. The happy hour menu at all PT's is limited and is too short. I would recommend that PT's stop trying to dominate all neighborhoods and fix these problems before it becomes a failure. I have been to various PT's around town to visit with friends or family and they all seem to be on a decline. I wouldn't recommend coming to this particular PT's due to the experience I have had in the past few visits",0Yp9lemtkveZMiYh6sW1RA,0,0,3,TgLbGN7glv3xc2yVwFB86Q
2783728,2017-12-28,0,k_luboaCkZRUo5KL7phVvQ,"Had to update my review based on our Christmas Day experience here. We were looking forward to coming here to watch the Warriors game. Unfortunately, as soon as we arrived the rude bartender yelled that there were no servers, so he told us to sit at the bar. We sat in a booth and walked up to the bar and ordered. The guy had a real bad attitude, was short with everyone and was just plain rude. He acted like everything was a bother, and that he was crazy busy. At this time there were about 7 people in the bar. We couldn't watch the game with sound and the ventilation in this brand new building is poor. There were only a few people smoking, but the smoke was strong. We stayed because there was no where else to go within walking distance. Later a female bartender came in, she was pleasant and brought our drinks to the table. I'm guessing someone must have said something to the rude guy, because later he suddenly had a personality transplant and started being real polite.

We've been here several times since it opened. We've had one great experience, several average and one bad, which was the above. The only reason I will come back because this place is close to home. I wouldn't come here to eat great food, because the food like all PT's Gold is not that good. However, I like the TVs and a nice new bar within walking distance of my house. I will just pick my nights.",KMyARv0J3NZpHH5Vbx0pLg,4,0,1,YckOKVF1Ok5QUt4lPxNBQA

Drinks surpass the food- but we admittedly just had appetizers. Minimal smoke tonight, so we got lucky- I wouldn't peg this as a craft beer location, but the happy hour and proximity to where I live are ideal! Good TV location- I'd come back for football games!

3581388,2018-04-01,0,k_luboaCkZRUo5KL7phVvQ,"Disappointing. I am newer to Las Vegas and I see these place everywhere and I was curious to try one out. They just built one super close to where my house is so I thought I would give it a try. 

Location is great and I saw it get built from the ground up. The interior is beautiful. For some reason it gave me a a coyote ugly vibe. They also played alternative rock music from the early 2000's that was fun. Where they lost me was the food. I ordered burger sliders which were not bad but they lost me at the crappy $20 frozen pizza. Not exaggerating but the crust tasted like cardboard.......yup, thats the best way to describe it. The sausage tasted like that cheap sausage you get from those frozen microwavable pizzas. I could have just gone to grimaldi's if i knew thats how awful the pizza would be considering the price. How is it that bowling alleys have tasty pizza but a place that has a full service kitchen can't produce a decent pizza. They probably have better things on the menu but their stuff was not super cheap to begin with so I most likely wont be coming back. I really wanted this to be a spot for my husband and I but if we are getting drinks we want some decent food to go with it.",TCXHYNo1LWLszdGwrFhvJg,0,1,2,t0gtrHQA1VHdthkVJtTb6Q

We tried to call PT'S to see if by any chance we could take our one year old since they do have a dining area.  No one picked up the call, so I actually went on yelp and it stated that it was kid friendly we took our chances and went. (It's literally right behind our house). When we walked in we saw a sign and it stated must be 21 or older to enter. We still went in and an employee starts shouting ""oh no, no . no! You can't come in I don't know if yall read that big sign when you walked in saying 21 or over?""  I shouted back yes I did read & see it but wanted to know if we were allowed to eat by the dining area, I told him he didn't have to be rude. That I had looked up if it was kid friendly told him they should go on sites and update or confirm their info. Please keep in mind this guy (bartender or whatever his job title may be) is yelling/shouting by the end of the bar and we are at the entrance. There was a gentleman drinking by the bar and another couple at the left hand side on a table. I understand it's a bar I totally get it, but why couldn't this person walk up to us and say ""hey sorry but unfortunately no kids are allowed"" how hard can that be? There was no need for everyone in that building to know we were getting kicked out or for him to cause a big scene. FYI I been to bars where they have sections where you can bring your family to eat. I guess I learned the hard and embarrassing way that pts is not family orientated. They need to learn how to give good customer service.",zGB0N2cfWng0SxrYvAgYew,0,0,2,iSQCp507LKiD6XNb2yGrTg
4813966,2018-04-13,2,k_luboaCkZRUo5KL7phVvQ,"I had the most ridiculous experience I EVER had at a PT's. The service is horrible.

My friends & I went to PT's only because the original bar we went to was packed for the Golden Knights game.

It was before happy hour was over at 6:57 p.m. & I went straight up to a server, Kristian, to put an order in. I wanted two Midori Sours & a Gilroy pizza. Our conversation went: ""Okay. What's a Midori Sour?"" ""The green drink."" ""What's in it so I can put that in the order? Like what alcohol is in it?"" With a confused look, I said ""... Midori."" I was trying to order quickly so I just settled for a different drink. I asked what drinks can I order & she said, ""they have everything."" Okay?! I need to know the ingredients in order to order one?! I settled for a Jameson & Ginger Ale, while my friend I was with got a Jack & Coke, & another Gilroy pizza. Yes, this was all by 7 p.m.

As my friends started coming in, they put in their drink orders. My friend ordered a Snakebite. She asked him the same question of what was in it & he stated that it was 1/2 Cider & 1/2 Beer. I was so confused to why she needed to know what was in drink as if the bartender doesn't know that. All my friends who came after I ordered got their drinks before I did. My friend who ordered the Snakebite only got the ""bite"" as he says because his drink was all Cider so he had to fix his order at the bar. When I got my Gilroy pizza, my friend who also put in an order for one didn't get his & she said she only put in one. He passed on getting one.

She didn't do well with keeping up with our drink orders so people went to the bar if necessary. Then when we got our checks & I told her how to split it, I noticed my check wasn't given happy hour prices. I asked her why & she said it was because we came after 7 p.m. I stated no, we were here just before 7 p.m. & I ordered just in time for happy hour. She said when she put the order in, it was after 7 p.m. & she shares a register with another server so it could have taken time. That made no sense to me because how is that my fault. I was so over her at that point that I said whatever & paid my check.

It was my first & last time at this location. PT's raised their prices as well. It's just not a go-to place anymore.",QSMsF78PxVYiAwwwHeZ7xA,7,0,1,is6cMmKIXiiHXI4BvPOsMA

Turns out its all great in the positive aspect. So the bar is very nice with TV screens all around the main bar and many on the sides of the outsides walls, so no matter where you sit, you have a TV view. 
Beer was on tap and pouring lively! Food was the standard PT's menu you will see at all the other PT's locations and Sierra Gold Locations. I was there at Happy Hour which is 50% off Pizza and Beer, great deal.

Smoke factor was very low and there was a decent amount of people inside the bar area. The decor is all fresh new chairs and couches and the small sitting areas are pretty nice if you have a small group. 

Bartenders and waitress were very nice and kept checking to see if we needed anything, which is a good thing when your dining. 

Parking is a small private lot. Some motorcycles parked up near the door. 
Noise level was average or standard for a bar establishment. 

Since this is a local and close location I will certainly return!",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,2,0,4,gWVPkiubulyKyVUYtDUnZg

The food was mediocre.. but as I said the staff was awesome. I sunk nearly $2,000 into two different games and barely had one winning combination. The bartender was nice enough to let me know that somebody else had spent over $2,000 in another game on Keno... So I went to that game and I spent nearly $1,000 on that game. I am not a degenerate gambler. I do have a lot of disposable income, and I have played enough to understand how the games play when they are set at a reasonable percentage payout. This place is trying to pay for it's new construction and opening by setting their games to the absolute lowest payout. If you want some good Association, that is from the staff and not the other patrons, (half of them seemed as though they were human traffickers)... Lol, then this would be a good place to go. If you are looking to go someplace where the gaming is on a fair level playing field, then definitely go someplace else.
