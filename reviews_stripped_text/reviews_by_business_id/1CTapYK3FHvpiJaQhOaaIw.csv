177850,2010-08-18,2,1CTapYK3FHvpiJaQhOaaIw,"Honestly... when I am in Hawaii or even when I lived there... I never ate at L&L. Maybe once in a blue moon.. but never regularly.

Since moving up to Las Vegas, I did find myself eating here more often than not. I like the fact that they have lau lau and kalua pig as a regular menu item where Island Sushi has it only as a special.. but that is pretty much all I ever get when I visit L&L. In Hawaii, I'd get their beef stew or curry, but I can easily make that myself now.. whereas lau lau is a little harder.

I like that fact that you can choose to have cabbage or no cabbage with you kalua pig. Depending on I feel, I will order one or the other. Their other menu items like their mahi mahi is okay.. nothing special. I once felt like getting breakfast for dinner -- Portuguese sausage, eggs and rice.. but I could have easily made that at home for waaaay cheaper!

The location is convenient. But since finding out about Island Sushi, I have been choosing them over L&L as of late. If an Aloha Kitchen was closer, I'd go there as well over L&L. 

I guess because I'm so used to crappy L&L in Hawaii, that I find it is overrated.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,0,1,3,IoDbqo6PYtntL08ebFvXkQ

The food is delicious, but they will definitely nickel and dime you. We were ordering for my father in law, and he decided he wanted an extra Katsu sauce. Typically it is a .25 charge, which is definitely not a lot, but when we already waited 20 min for our food, I think it's a bit ridiculous to ring that up. I know they have a business to run, but show a little appreciation for the $$ we just dropped and the time we waited for an establishment that is supposed to provide food in a minimal amount of time. We'll just remember to have an extra quarter in our pocket in case anyone has last minute requests, so our card doesn't have to be charged again.",zLfJTSNAXTS-rJ6zrG7i9g,0,0,3,RfCINcpsIjNzZh4dAVDFUw

I usually get the Super Low Carb Plate that comes with a variety of meats as well as eggs, prepared the style of your choice.

The rest of the family typically goes for the BBQ Chicken platter. Also generously portioned as well as delicious.

I went a few days ago to meet a friend and had the kalua and lau lau meal. The cashier asked if I wanted cabbage with it. I said yes, of course. That was a fantastic meal to grub on. My son isn't into too much hawaiian food, like I am, so he just ate part of my steamed rice. I am only giving them a three star, because I am picky about what I eat, and only been to this one once.

I asked if I could get the super low carb plate and get ""more short rib and less chicken"" as the chicken has more carbs and less fat.  

My register attendant asked the lady to her right at the other register and she said ""no we can't subsitute short ribs for chicken, we can only do the reverse"". Her tone was rude as well.

She offered no alternative.  It was as if. she had already made up her mind to not give me what I want.

Tried this place today for the first time. I gotta say I really enjoyed it! 

This location is right next to the Wienerschnitzel on Serene, roadside in front of Home Depot and WalMart.

Service was friendly and there was just a 5 minute wait as they cooked the food. I got the BBQ chicken bowl(4.95) while my friend got the Chicken Katsu bowl (also 4.95). We both agreed that mine was the better of the two, but for 5 bucks a bowl, you can't go wrong!

I came to this place a little before noon one day while waiting for a job interview. The place was empty, and the girl working the register was herself eating some teriyaki chicken. It looked good, so I ordered myself the same thing!

When I FINALLY got my order (it seemed to take too long considering I was the only one there) and started to chow down, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was good, but it wasn't as piping hot as I expected it would be. Plus, there wasn't a lot of sauce like I was expecting. The only thing that seemed to be really good was the rice, which, admittedly, isn't the hardest thing to make. 

As I was eating, a guy came in to order some food. He ordered something, and was out a few minutes later. I think they hadn't fired up the grill until I got there, so the second order was quicker than mine. 

The food here was passable, and didn't seem to expensive, either. It's just that, when compared to Aloha Kitchen, this place fails. It's not as good, as fast, or even as cheap.

4654815,2016-03-17,7,1CTapYK3FHvpiJaQhOaaIw,"I don't like L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. I LOVE L&L Hawaiian Barbecue. Dining and reviewing restaurants in Las Vegas is fun because Las Vegas is the Ninth Island and kind of the sixth borough. 

   Recently, when I working in the vicinity of the Serene Avenue L&L Barbecue, sometimes after a rough day of work, I'd treat myself to a plate lunch. Over time I would explore the menu by trying the chicken katsu, garlic basa, barbecue chicken, seafood combo, and so on. Everything I ordered has been outstanding. 

   In my opinion, L&L is one of the best restaurant deals around. The majority of the mini combos with a medium Pepsi come out to less than $10. The servings are gargantuan. Forget about the regular portion. I order the mini and it is a grand serving. The mini includes a scoop of rice and macaroni salad. Whether I order the barbecue chicken or fish; I'd save the best for last: the macaroni salad. Hitherto now, these taste buds have yet to sample macaroni salad as delicious as L&L. After trying different items from the menu; I would usually return to the barbecue chicken and garlic basil. Usually I will add hieracha sauce to add additional flavor to the chicken and soy sauce to add flavor to the white rice. 

   L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is a self-serve concept. The format is similar to fast food restaurants. When you walk in, there is a menu above the counter. Once you pay, they give you a receipt with the order number and cup for the Pepsi beverage. L&L differentiates itself from the fast food restaurants in the time it takes from order to table. The wait time is customarily between 10 to 15 minutes. It appears that the cooks are making the food fresh. The majority of the tables overlook the Walmart parking lot. There aren't many Hawaii decorations or pictures inside. 

   From my experience L&L is a gateway restaurant. What I mean by Gateway restaurant is a restaurant chain that introduces people to a certain cuisine or style of food. In my case, L&L planted a seed in my mind that grew into an adventure tree out to expand its branches into new Hawaiin restaurants. L&L introduced me to the plate lunch. In recent times, I explored quite a few Hawaiin Barbecue restaurants. The upshot is that even though L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is a chain, I am still fond of it. 

    As I write this review, L&L Hawaiian Barbecue is serving more and more people it's delicious Hawaiin Barbecue as they open new restaurants. For example, just recently they opened a new restaurant off Boulder Highway in Henderson. Whether it's Boulder City or North Las Vegas, I would like to visit an L&L Hawaiian Barbecue to relive the delectable plate lunches that this location has served me.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,12,4,E0mtyIlFwYOHBh6q-r8ILg

I either get Chicken Katsu ""Mini"" (Quote unquote because mini is still a big portion) or seafood combo. Chicken Katsu mini comes with a lot of chcken katsu (chicken katsu is fried chicken breasts), one scoop of rice, and macaroni salad which is bomb. The sauce for chicken katsu is great, as I've tried to make it at home myself but have failed miserably.

I can't remember exactly what comes in seafood combo, but i believe it was chicken katsu, two fried shrimps, and a piece of fried mahi mahi with two scoops of rice and a whole lot more macaroni salad. All their fried stuffs are very crispy, not too crispy, but little over just the right amount and I like it this way.

I've also gotten their musubi and saimin before. I'm not a huge fan of their saimin. The soup was good, but the noodles were too sticky for my taste. Musubi on the other hand, soo great.

a. Location - This one is near the Walmart / Sams Club on Serene just west of Eastern.  Easy location and parking.

b.  Service - Is, not great, but not mediocre. It is just okay. They do not attempt to make a difference or to make it a great experience.

c.  Food - Great overall selection.  We ordered the Katsu and the Beef plate.  The Katsu was quite good and they give you a ton of food. The Mac Salad was just right.  Where they get seriously dinged on the stars is the beef.  Can you remove the fatty tendons that is all over the beef?  You cannot eat this properly because so much sinewy fat is in this beef. It is tough, rough and downright a pain in the but to cut away with a plastic fork and plastic knife in a styrofoam plate.  This is evident to the quality of beef they are using and I would say that all their salty flavorings are covering up the poor meet taste.  However, the texture totally reeks of poor quality.

d.  The bathroom - Why do lock it?  What a pain where your hands are totally greasy from trying to pick apart the fat from the meat. Then we cannot just push our way into the restroom, we have to pick up a key on a long stick, work the lock and get in.  I just want to wash my hands and now I have to wash first to pick up the keys..... Yucky.

Overall, the taste of the flavoring is good, the katsu good, but the beef and the inconvenience of this place overall causes me to give this a 3 star at best.

I've been to this location at least 3 times in the past week! My excuse is, I've been busy moving, so it's great that I can stop in and order a plate lunch after a couple long and exhausting days of moving, without having to search through boxes of stuff for pans and food to cook. 

I like this location A LOT better than the Stephanie location! This is my new go-to spot for L&L. In this review, I'm comparing the Stephanie & Serene locations b/c it's the only Vegas L&Ls I've been to more than once. The Serene location: It's cleaner, the customer service is friendlier (Aloha-style), the food taste fresh and well cooked, the ambiance feels like I'm back home, in the islands. And I'm bound to run into someone I know, which is nice, sometimes ;). The experience I get at this location is what mainland L&L should be, it will not compare to the original Hawai'i L&L, but this location (in my opinion) is up to par. Also, the obvious fact that this location has more people flowing in and out says something. 

I use to go to the Stephanie location a lot but over the pass few years the Stephanie location is not what it use to be. Not a lot of people go to that location anymore since they've built several L&Ls around the Vegas Valley. Here at the Serene location, the staff has good customer service, the location is a perfect spot, the food (especially the BBQ Chicken) taste better here, the food is definitely well cooked and consistent at the Serene location.

I've had almost everything on the L&L menu but at this location I've had the BBQ chicken plate and the Garlic Fish plate.  Both are onoliscious and cooked to perfection.  Mmmm... I'm craving both right now. 

The Garlic Fish is my new personal favorite. A few days ago, was my first time having it at L&L, but it was delicious!! I'm not sure what type of fish it is (see my photo) but I'll ask next time I stop in. The Garlic Fish is grilled with fresh garlic and green onions and comes with slices of lemon to drizzle over when you're ready to scarf in down. ONOLISCIOUS! 

Everything on the menu is drool worthy but If you can't decide what to get.... get the Chicken Katsu, L&L is most famous for their Chicken Katsu (don't forget the Katsu sauce), the BBQ plates (Chicken, Beef, Short Ribs), or my new personal favorite, the Garlic Fish. Each regular plate comes with 2 scoops rice & 1 scoop mac salad. Get the regular plate not mini it's two meals in one (for me it is) and you'll want some leftovers for later. If that's not enough, order an extra plate for later.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,5,3,5,1cdEaqal3AEMXM13TdaBYw

Then when I asked for a menu item that I ALWAYS get, they gave me a weird look and silence. Then I asked again, and they explained that they where the corporate store and all are different. Then I asked them if they had they're signature BBQ sauce and they gave me that awkward look AGAIN. So not a good feeling. We walked right out. I love L&L, but this place was very negative.",qrTT1lueHlQjF2bgw2uhFQ,0,0,2,qfqtntH2QbZp5UlSD1_QEQ

They do have to get your food prepped and maybe...if you were a tad bit considerate, they might have other orders ahead of you, including phone orders. People complain too much for their own good. Please get yourself to the nearest fast food joint if you expect your food in less than five minutes. Anyway, I always get exceptional customer service from the hardworking staff. People need to think of how they portray themselves and maybe have a little ""aloha"" in their lives. I'm from Hawaii and the food is bomb! Thank you L&L for satisfying my cravings! Don't let any of these negative comments fool you.",0Md3sO3sRR3GE4eQLtqZbw,2,2,5,ADlvGQuE0lJvIUsEYvaYIg

I was right across the shopping center. I made a quick call on my way back to my car and placed my order. I figure by the time I unload and drive over there, the food will be ready! Now thats being efficient!

I order the Loco Moco, Hawaiian BBQ Chicken, and two pieces of Spam Musubi. The total cost came out to around $21. The food is very consistent with the other L&L's I've been to. Never a complaint from me. Would I come here again? Definitely. Would I recommend what I ordered? Definitely! You really cant go wrong here.",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,5,4,3,xoGISm_u97mf3G8HGC9Syg

I usually get the Chicken Katsu plate and my boyfriend gets the BBQ Mix plate. Both are quite good and we always get full after eating it. I've ordered their Seafood Mix plate once and I did not like it, I thought it was too salty.

We call ahead and order and it's always ready when we get there, but even if you walk in and order, the wait is never longer than 10 minutes.

They also serve pork buns but a little pricey, imo!",dOFyIGbyfB69VB4pnoKqQA,6,6,4,PPiT8rnGBbBIGPAFMF93zw
5500516,2011-04-06,8,1CTapYK3FHvpiJaQhOaaIw,"L&L is like the McDonald's of Hawaiian BBQ you see them everywhere and you just drive right by, we had them in Northern Cali and once we moved here I did not see this one until we went to get groceries at Sams Club with an empty stomach. Instead of getting our groceries and going home to throw down like Bobby Flay we went to L&L for some Katsu Chicken and guess what..... It was exactly like the Cali Locations. 

The staff was friendly and the food was very fast to hit our table. One of the things that L&L does consistently is fill that Styrofoam box to this brim and they do it for cheap. I have never been to Hawaii and I don't walk around saying Maholo to every person that I think has any Hawaiian features or characteristics so I can't write that this meal reminded me of my wild Hawaiian nights when we dug up a pig and broke pineapples on each others chests but I will say that if ""real"" Hawaiian food tastes as good if not better than L&L I may become an Island local someday. 

Back to the portions they give you; first of all, if that is one chicken breast in that tray I would love to see the guy that wrestled that beast to its death  just to be able to cook it up and lay it on the Huge scoops of white rice paired with a side of delicious macaroni salad. To top off this pile of scrumptiousness they have the absolute best teriyaki/BBQ sauce I have ever tasted, as many times as I have tried to buy my own teriyaki sauce it is never like the sauce at L&L it is not too sweet and that is the golden ticket for me. 

Overall this place is great and definitely perfect when you are hungry and in a hurry to get a great meal, and oddly enough when you leave there you may even feel like an honorary Hawaiian and feel the need to say maholo to someone on your way out.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,4,3,4,EG4dj1fht8qsH5VsNdcFJw

When they do I make sure to get a full plate with the sauce on the side because I don't like the chicken to lose its crunch. The chicken which is a boneless thigh with the skin is deep fried and perfectly crispy! The macaroni salad is also good. I enjoy some of the different items on the menu too but my favorite dish is the garlic chicken. I do wish they offered lemon chicken like they do back in Hawaii... I'd be ordering that too!

I'd say the food is... it's fine. Nothing to write home about. I'm a huge fan of the beef at these places and not so much the chicken (not Katsu.) The ribs were on par here as with other Hawaiian take out I've had.

Location seems to have waves of people coming through because it's walking distance from 1. a high school 2. a private school 3. a Sam's Club 4. Wal-Mart 5. Home Depot 6. Ross. It's like... every place that has tons of people trucking through is near this L & L.

Chicken Katsu - dark meat chicken, deep fried... and possibly deep fried again.. served with a side of mayonnaise drenched macaroni salad. The one thing I did like was the sauce they serve you with the chicken. Sweet and sour type with a thick consistency 

Hawaiian short ribs - oh.... well.. what animal did this come from?? This was pretty scary looking to me and I don't think that piece of meat was meant to be eaten.. maybe better to flavor a soup. 

As said before, my friends love this place... Want deep fried crunchiness?? You have come to the right place. For myself, I will stay away.",xvtBlzl5ZPgrGiWLA97bGQ,0,0,1,phBNYk6t4xZDbQd905Hyuw

5798594,2012-08-26,0,1CTapYK3FHvpiJaQhOaaIw,"huh..... Not the L&L I'm use to in Cali or Phoenix. Maybe it was because of the conditions the employees were in (sadly, their A/C went out) that made their food not quite as good as I expect all L&L places to be. Ordered the same: Kalbi and chicken katsu. Took it to go, obviously hehe. You really cant mess up chicken katsu, which they didnt, phew. Kalbi was not as flavorful nor well done to my desire. Macaroni salad was not as garlicy but yummy nonetheless. Ordered Spam Musubi and there was only one and the spam was more thinly sliced than what I'm use to.They didn't even have the thick teriyaki sauce :( nor the garlic chili sriracha/simbal. Sad to say, I brought my wife to this L&L, her first hawaiian bbq experience and she was not impressed :(",ehgLycOK6qKj-CT9B36_oQ,0,0,2,jvqmHQSUNDp3ydEF1RP2zg
