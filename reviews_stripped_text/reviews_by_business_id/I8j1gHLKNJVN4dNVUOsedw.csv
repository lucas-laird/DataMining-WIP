6746,2016-11-09,0,I8j1gHLKNJVN4dNVUOsedw,Vicky's diner is a hidden gem you definitely get everything that you see in the pictures that are posted to the yelp site. The breakfast food was definitely what we expected and needed although the orange shoes was not fresh squeezed it help with my hangover that I was having at the time. I will definitely frequent this location when I come back to Vegas the service was pleasant.,wYvehWUxiXETOSNu5Kd6Cg,0,0,4,t87PjIZcbxX05WT9VPwUFA
47181,2016-02-07,1,I8j1gHLKNJVN4dNVUOsedw,"Well we came here years ago and it was a typical diner so we decided to try it again since they had a mini make over. It was horrible. The iced tea was disgusting, I can't even explain the taste. I can't believe the way that they have this place set up. Bacon once cooked it tossed between 2 white towels, toast sat on plates for 10 minutes or not even under a warmer. Complete disorganization, serves running circles around each other. Way to expensive for the quality of the food. We both had pancakes, no taste and rubber like. They serve it with a buttery spread not even real butter. The hash browns lacked seasoning. Will never go back. Do not waste your money.",F-eBGfQ_UOa-XVbpm3eQjQ,2,0,1,M0sA60F3ulGMUbi9DP5SjA

It is always best to order the bacon traditional or as i say ""greasy"", they are health conscious and dry the bacon off as some restaurants do. To get a full flavor order it ""greasy"" it is best to dry it off yourself if it needs to be dried off at all. After all why ruin a perfectly good piece of bacon by trying to make it healthy.

My friend and I were at Circus Circus and I looked on Yelp for the nearest diner. I found that Vickie's Diner had great reviews. At first we couldn't find it and it was in a sketchy area. Then we turned the corner and there it was!

We went inside and the decor was like a diner you see in the movies. I loved it!

I ordered a cheeseburger deluxe and the breakfast special. All I have to say is... it was delicious. 

The service was fast and friendly.

They're open 24/7 and it truly is a hidden gem of Vegas.

One can easily see how the staff is grilling the meat or making pancakes. Now, I am enjoying a generous portion of steak dinner and a pumpkin pie for desserts. Quality and juicy food. But It took them more than 15 minutes to prepare and to serve it! My only mark to Vicky's could be faster service. However, waiting for my portion was fully worthy and my impatience to try the pumpkin pie was fully repaid. 
Prices are average, for this part of the town. If you include drink refill, the final bill could be for sure considered as cheap. The nightshift staff is showing a really polite manner to customers and a buddy style approach.",DaD7v2SOa41zprUR9Z91AA,0,0,4,9MJkPmAZ33TrKSrxEOuAIA

Walking distance from our hotel, we found this spot in an area we weren't expecting. If it weren't for the painting on the outside walls of this diner, I would have thought it was any other abandoned place covered in graffiti. 

I didn't have such a big appetite that morning, and felt like I could only do something small. After looking through the menu for a few minutes, I decided to order a mixed fruit bowl. When I told the waitress that's what I wanted, she told me that it ""comes with everything"" and asked me if that's okay. I said yes. I didn't think to ask her what ""everything"" was until she had walked away with our orders. So we wait a well amount of time and breakfast is on the table. I was shocked. 

When I see ""mixed fruit"" on a menu, I imagine something like strawberries, bananas, melon, grapes, ect. I couldn't believe what was brought to my table. I almost thought it was a joke. 
My bowl of mixed fruit that I had ordered was diced peaches straight out of the can with a sliced banana on top. Yep. I would have never paid over $4 if I knew that's what I'd be getting. If that was the case, I could have bought my own can of fruit and banana and still spend less than that! All I'm saying is, mixed fruit off a menu should be FRESH and MIXED fruit!  
I ended up eating potatoes off my boyfriend's plate instead.

-Not greeted at all, employees were apathetic
-Waited 30 minutes to order food, despite only 3 other tables occupied.
-both of our burgers came on dry, old buns
-the tomatoes were old
-I asked for mayonnaise and there was a huge frozen banana chunk in it
-We had almost no interaction with our server and the whole experience and the less than amazing food really made it a truly miserable meal.

When my partner tried to complain, he was interrupted and the issues were side-stepped.

Would not recommend. We would have left because of the long wait to place our orders but we had been travelling all day and had been almost 12 hours without food. We were starving and desperate. Even considering that, this was bad all around. I made a yelp account just to leave this review.

The corned beef was so tender and the wedge of Cabbage was perfect. None of it was too salty and I rolled out of there. The boy had three Pork chops n eggs. You can have one or three Pork chops lol!  We will be back while here this week.

  Day 2 came in again for breakfast. I thought sat morning would be packed but it was a perfect constant flow of people. We did sit up at the bar cause booths were full. But doing this we got breakfast AND a show! The line cook was awesome. He has been here 40 yrs they said! Heard the story that Vickis Uncle had owned it owner Before last and now she has it back!! Don't see her today, must be her day off. He orchestrated the hash browns in the back with constant perfection. The meats front right ,several slices of bacon and sausage patty's alternating. He patted the grease off with his special meat towel as they waited to be plated. Thick pieces of French toast and huge pancakes front left were also flipped with precision. Everything g looked sooo good. I wanted to try it all. 
  I ordered trout n eggs. It was the best I've ever had. It was a full trout split open, deboned and crispy with skin and tail on!! Perfect seasoning, side of two lemons and tarter if you like, accompanied by potatoes( whew... too many), & 3 eggs! Oh with toast too! It was so good I even ate the fish chip (tail)!!! 
  Bf had the Vicki Burger and wowee that's a huge burger. He truley enjoyed the heck out of it. Cooked med rare just like he wanted it too. He even couldn't eat the hash browns lol. So hope to come tomorrow afternoon one more time if we can!

Wow I wasn't sure I could eat 1/2 lb burger... but I did. I tackled it by cutting it in half and ate two halves! Lol. As usual so many potatoes but they didn't get wasted. 
  Bf had Greek salad with Gyro meat on it. It was equally good. Unfortunately he was still hungry and I ate all my burger. So he ordered a side of burger patty for $5 and ate the rest of my potatoes ! Hahahahaha waste not want not. 
    So I have to say this place is a gem and open 24/7 and always seating. If you don't try this place you are losing out on good cooking!! Till next time in town thanx Vickis!!",INJeBb5oMnS54FpUv894qw,1,0,5,gbSgZTEcDrFX_GfqJRf8OQ

Parking was easy, service was relaxed, patrons mostly seemed like local regulars who kept to themselves. Our waitress had professional service and was kind enough to ask how we wanted our checks split before we ordered which was helpful. I ordered a BLT on toasted sourdough with mashed potatoes & gravy. My SO ordered a steak dinner with peas & mashed potatoes with gravy. His brother ordered a Paul Bunyun no pickles or onions with fries and his girlfriend ordered home style potatoes with her three egg breakfast with wheat toast. Our son had chicken tenders with fries (he normally has an organic breakie of fresh fruit & veggie juice in the morning w/egg, vitamins & 1/4 whole wheat bread but we're on vacation so this is what he gets). 

Gravy was okay, peas were canned, the steak was actually a large ground beef patty to my SO's disappointment but everything else was delicious and I loved my BLT.

Stepping across the threshold is like stepping into the 1950's. The decor and seating is very much like an old fashioned drive in diner. It's also much larger on the inside than it appears from the outside, so don't be afraid to bring friends. 

The waitresses are so freaking nice and hospitable. It felt like sitting down to breakfast with my extended family cooking and checking in on me. 

The food was super good. I got the bacon and 3 egg breakfast with wheat toast and home fries. The eggs were over a little too easy for my liking, but still very good when you soak up the runniness with some buttered toast. The bacon was perfectly crispy, salty, and savory. I also got an extra piece, so my Vegas luck cashed in at the perfect time. The home fries were really good.

Homey.
Not necessarily inciting but a good local joint. 
Sort of inside a liquor store 
will almost miss it if aren't looking for white cross market 

Went at 4 pm with DH, ordered Tiffany burger and Fries - asked to have bacon and cheese on top of the fries AND grilled cheese on sourdough & fries - also with cheese and bacon on top.

The burger was cooked medium well perfectly ! 3.5/4 out of 5 for the burger . The fries that came on the side did not have cheese or bacon on them -- oversight of waitstaff - though she was incredibly pleasant. 

The grilled cheese was buttery and melty as expected -- 4 out of 5 for that.
Fries came topped with cheese and bacon. BUT when the server Asked the cook (named D) to put these toppings on the fries on the grill, what should have been simple turned into a complicated scenario! Ultimately, the server popped 2 slices of thick cheddar cheese and crispy, almost tasteless bacon on top of fries and put them in the microwave for a few seconds. Then we received this plate with half melted cheese and super crunchy bacon on top. Not what we were looking for on the side of this tasty grilled cheese.

Bottomless coffee and water paired with these meals were good.

Service is friendly, and if you're in there early enough your server also cooks your food. It's not fussy. Your omelette will have American cheese and your toast might be a little burnt.

4453363,2016-11-28,2,I8j1gHLKNJVN4dNVUOsedw,"What a colossal waste of time.

While staying on strip (at the SLS), I always like to find a local breakfast joint away from the hotels. Yelp usually puts me on hidden gems that few know about. 

When I saw that there was a 50's diner for breakfast nearby, I was jazzed. We show up but couldn't readily find it--although it was right in front of us. The old strip-mall that it sits in was all but vacant of any businesses. The whole corner looked dead and depressed.

We see the diner and we went in hoping for the best. It was far from being great. 

Pros:
1) Simple food at an OK price
2) Great parking

CONS:
1) Biscuits (gravy and biscuits) are warmed in front of you in a MICROWAVE
2) The staff lacked any vitality
3) The coffee sucked--badly (think hotel room instant packs)
4) Food was darn near fast food quality, but it couldn't get that high
5) A cook dropped a fork and it went under one of the greasy fryers. He retrieved it, with his bare hands and went back to frying. 
6) Sausage patties were as cheap and greasy as you could get them (awful)


Will never go there again.

There was only one or two guys behind the counter prepping the food and taking orders and whatnot but there were also only like 3 people in there. Needless to say, my friend ordered a steak rare, got it medium rare; she ordered her eggs over easy, got them over medium; she ordered a coffee, got it with our request for the check after waiting for 30+ minutes.

I'd recommend the the Paul Bunyan burger or the chili burger(definitely a ""fork and knife"" burger, it comes smothered in chili!), both are very scrumptious.

I had my maps on and would have missed the place! It blends right in with the building. As we pull up we both looked at each other and I read a review that headlined, ""Don't let the outside fool you. There is a hidden gem."" So we shrugged our shoulders and in we went. 

We walked into an old fashioned diner with pink booths, surrounded old time memorabilia and smiling faces as they greeted us. Not to mention no hour long wait. Although I could see there being one.

I ordered the Manhattan burger which is a 1/2 lb patty with American cheese and bacon that comes on sourdough with fries all for $8.95.   The bread was toasted to perfection on the grill and the burger was cooked just the way I ordered medium well.  Extremely filling meal the French fries were great as well. Only thing missing was a beer to wash it all down.  I ended up with a fountain drink perhaps next time I'll try a milkshake.  

Staff was polite and super busy but made sure to refill my drink and check during the meal.  I have already recommended this place to my friends and will be back for a breakfast, lunch or the occasional after midnight meal.

5194816,2016-02-11,1,I8j1gHLKNJVN4dNVUOsedw,"There's no reason to ever go to IHop or Denny's with Vickie's Diner. 

The staff is always super friendly and accommodating, day or night. This is the local spot to go,

The food is a bit better than the standard greasy spoon fare- nothing that will win awards, but it's always consistently as good as you expect it to be, or better. (I've eaten here dozens of times). And if it's not, they will happily correct it immediately. 

Smaller, cozier place. I wouldn't go with more than 6 people, and that's pushing it, as it's narrow.

Servers tend to be more mature, 50+ locals, which I like. It's reflected in their attentiveness and professionalism. 

Great place to have some late night coffee talk too. 

My only complaint -might- be that it's VERY BRIGHT. So if you're looking for grub after a late night of drinking, you might want to wear shades coming in here.

Support local businesses. This is not corporate owned or even a fanchise. It's a mom & pop, and a great one. Possibly the last good, 24hr greasy spoon left in Vegas.",YyvxDo3ztGYQhMiRXEfd3w,2,0,5,W9yEzKfRUOsFwD506ewqOg

A man came up to use and gave us more menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I had to repeat myself a few times so he could understand me but he got my order down eventually. The cook came up to us and ask what we wanted to eat. He was wearing cotton gloves with the fingertips cut off. Food safety isn't a big deal here. When our food arrived we were surprised. HUGE portions which is good. They only checked up on us once so we didn't really get great customer service. At the end of the night it was only $29 for 3 people. Not too bad.

5680418,2016-09-29,1,I8j1gHLKNJVN4dNVUOsedw,"While on the strip with an out of town visitor, we were looking for a diner for breakfast. Vickie's came up on Yelp with excellent reviews and we decided to check it out. On the outside, this place looks sketchy as hell and maybe if you're a snob, the inside isn't the fanciest, but Vickie's is awesome. We were instantly seated at the counter in hot pink diner swivel chairs and given menus and had our drink orders taken. 

I got one of their breakfast combos with eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes. It was A LOT of food. I couldn't finish it all, or even come close to be honest. I got my eggs scrambled with cheese and my only complaint was that they melted the cheese on top rather than scrambling it in with the eggs. But whatever, everywhere does it differently and that's no big deal. Like any great diner, the food was greasy, the menu was somewhat limited, and the kitchen is open for you to watch them do everything. 

Don't come here expecting fancy. If you want a diner that's got less personality to it, go to the Denny's next door. But if you want a good meal with a ton of food at a very reasonable price, check out Vickie's!",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,1,1,4,q1uOFLY5uQYwVW4MmN7cPw
