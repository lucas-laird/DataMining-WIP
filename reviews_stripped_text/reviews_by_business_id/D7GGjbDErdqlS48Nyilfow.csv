I make my own at home and use the unsweetened acai packets, so when I ran out of ingredients I was excited to know there's a new acai place super close to me. Unfortunately, these acai bowls are just too sweet. Sweetened acai, sweetened coconut, super sweet granola, and honey, makes this yummy treat a dessert and not a good meal replacement. Perhaps consider having an option for unsweetened acai available!",C4oqtVKdmS19fkMZo9fe9w,4,0,2,5vu-rAbemuco4P_93iAnYQ

1607920,2017-07-24,4,D7GGjbDErdqlS48Nyilfow,"I unfortunately have to update my review and take away stars solely based on the service received during our recent visit.  

Good service is key, I mean why would anyone want to settle for less?  The service at this location on this occasion was the reason for this update.   So robotic no service with a smile.  I really wish I would have gotten her name but if you come here you will probably know, it doesn't seem like she ever smiles (except when it's probably time to clock out). She gave the same service to the next 2 patrons after us.  She was the only one here at the time I ordered, but it was not busy. 

So she takes my order tells me the amount, I pay, and then she gives me a receipt without saying a word.  She then proceeds to walk towards the back to start on the order.  I waited there thinking is she coming back? I looked at my husband in disbelief and walked away to wait for my order.   A few minutes later she calls out my name and the items are just handed over without another single word.  

Now, I know everyone knows bad services from good, even the rudest of people would know if they were receiving bad service.  No excuse!!  This needs to be reiterated here.  Their product is great but still without the good service to complete the experience and plenty of other options around the valley, you may not have such a high return rate on customers.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,9,7,3,WZUufLz6oiJ9WqFBhTGfOQ

I'm originally from O'ahu, Hawaii so of course I know what a real acai bowl should taste like and I'm extremely picky. I've tried a variety of acai up here in Vegas and it's depressing that these people up here think they know a good acai bowl. I finally decided to try Bowlology and I'm pretty happy about it. The fruit isn't exactly fresh, the strawberries have a weird artificial taste to it.... BUT, the ""berry good"" acai tastes the closest to a HIcravings bowl. I really enjoyed their granola! It's not the best acai bowl I've had but the best in Vegas for sure (so far).

The downfall part was that they didn't have any spicy tuna ready for a bowl. After I completed my order, they informed me that their tuna was still frozen. Kind of weird considering it's Saturday night and I would imagine you'd be a little more prepared for a Saturday night rush. It's alright though, upon reading the rest of the reviews about how terrible the poké bowls are... it's probably best I didn't get one.

I got the Mango smoothie. It was pretty good, but a little on the tart side. I woukd have expected a Mango flavored drink the be a litt sweeter or at least be something I could consume.

Minuses were that I don't know but my peanut butter pitaya bowl just didn't taste ""fresh"". It was lacking in sweetness as far as the pitaya went, and the ratio of toppings to pitaya was way off. I had about 1/4 of pitaya, and over 1/2 of toppings which did not balance out well. The biggest minus was that my son pulled a long hair out of his bowl after a few bites in ugh! Although the girl in the back did remake us a new bowl, she didn't offer a sorry or seem apologetic in any way or take any responsibility. We showed her the hair and asked for a new bowl and she simply said ""ok"". I know these things can happen but it was not a good first impression for our first time here.

Smoothies, fruit bowls, and they even have lunch/dinner bowls! Their menu does change every now and then. I usually get the ocean bowl, with açaí. You can get pitaya, which is dragon fruit as a base if you don't like açaí ! It is pretty tasty, especially in the summer time because it is nice and refreshing! The tartness really wakes you up in my opinion. You can also change fruit on top if you don't like the toppings.

I also like the fact that they have a stamp card, for every 10 bowls you purchase you get a free regular bowl, because the amount you pay for a bowl or smoothie is a little pricey. Which is why my review has 3 and if I could add a half I would, so 3 and a half stars! Also if you work in the plaza they give you a 10% discount, because ya know. A dollar is a dollar! They also do call ahead orders, so you can call and order your bowl before work if you work around the plaza and you just go in, pay, and pick up!

I discovered bowlology back in early July when I started working in Northwest Vegas. I was working in the 110 degree heat 12 hours a day, seven days a week to elect Hillary Clinton. Naturally, that meant I had little time to chat with my coworkers. So one of them said, ""Alec, let's get lunch."" I was excited but then I felt worried that she could not find a place to eat because she was vegan. 

I was wrong. 

She introduced me to bowlology. I am an Italian food person, a Chinese food person, a sushi person, a beer person, a pizza person, a steak person and a fruit person but I never saw myself as a fruit bowl person. 

Then I had the hula bowl at bowlology. Then I realized again that I was wrong 

Also, the staff member recognized me the 2nd time I came here. That is a large plus, a very big plus. Then I came back, then I came back again, and I stopped by here at 15-20 times (maybe even more). The staff kept recognizing me, I kept enjoying my hula, I enjoyed how healthy it was compared to other options in the area.

I opted for the large. i waited about 5-7 minutes and was handed a mason jar of juice with a lid. I asked the person if this was the same amount of juice as a large as it appeared much smaller. He advised it was the same. He said that if I brought back the mason jar for a refill i get 10% off my next drink. Now Im sure some people would appreciate the mason jar as it is cute. But for me, it was not practical and not really what I had ordered. So try to put a mason jar in your car holder for drinks. Yea that wasn't happening.

5258692,2016-04-27,0,D7GGjbDErdqlS48Nyilfow,"I find myself driving by this place a little too often and I always tell myself that I should stop on by one of these days. Well that day was today, I stopped by with my Great Dane whom is a licensed service dog and it was far from pleasant. Not only does the place lack personality and it could use some more furniture, but truthfully I can't even comprehend why anyone would want to stay and eat there since the customer service is beyond dissapointing. 
As I was asking the lady at the cashier some questions she had some slight attitude and after I ordered and paid for a Hula Acai bowl she said, ""due to the health department regulations you can't have your dog in here so you can wait outside with him and I'll bring out your bowl"". Not only did her comment and the tone  infuriate me but it also made me feel belittled, obviously my dog is a service dog which you can identify by the tag and his behavior as he just sat still next to me the whole time I stood there. I went ahead and just waited outside anyway because at that point I didn't even want to see her, so after 10 minutes she comes outside and brings me my bowl, with no lid on it, honey was dripped all over the side and I was not given a bag. If you make a customer wait outside for the food they ordered the least you can do is bring them a lid and a bag.

If I would have known that it was an issue to ask a question I would have not gone to buy a $9 bowl. It seemed as tho I was a bother to the young lady. Upon leaving I asked if they had a yelp and she laughed and said yea are you going to put a good review. I said nothing and the other girl laughed and said oh no hahhahaa she didn't say anything so that means no !! Then they both started to laugh loud and obnoxiously. I will return but I will speak to Corp first. Awesome first experience,nNyMXdDtHieKCt3-36ew7Q,2,1,1,FEExzUuzaZJZflhJ_xANSw
5312750,2016-05-15,0,D7GGjbDErdqlS48Nyilfow,"The Hula acai bowl was really good. All the other reviews say they're kinda pricey, but I wouldn't know, I've never had an acai bowl at any other place before lol. Their smoothie prices were pretty high though, and by the description of what's in their smoothies, they didn't seem anything out of the ordinary. 
I went in when it was pretty busy, I guess. It took 30 minutes for us to get our bowls. Everyone who was there before us apparently were waiting for a long time as well. There were only 2 people working; 1 stayed in the back making the orders and the second worker was back and forth, taking orders and making them.
I thought it was weird that when we ordered at the counter, he asked for our names and wrote them on the bowls, but when he was calling out the completed orders through the window to be picked up, he called them out by what the bowls were and not by the names of the customers. So every time he said ""Hula Acai bowl"", everyone that was waiting kinda just looked at each other because how the hell are we supposed to know who that bowl belongs to lol. So that caused a LOT of confusion and 1 angry customer (not me lol). 
I think this was just an off business day for them. But aside from the service, the bowls were very good and I'll definitely be back.",AWt-4_RGNqz9u2T8XfOy9g,1,1,4,qLqJxFKwmAqITrl2CzO2SQ

And I'm a proud stamp card holder racking up points to get free bowls...just to clarify my level of obsession with this place, I have a punch card and talk to my boss about it haha They have both fruit and sushi bowls, but I stick to the açaí ones cause it's basically a healthy dessert. It's better for you than smoothies (less sugar and they use real fruit), and when you get one with some chocolate in it, it's a dessert you can validate eating easier than cake heehee ;) I can't tell you which bowl is my favorite, that'd be like picking a favorite child.

The toppings are minimal and the flavor for the PB is beyond over powering . The peanut butter is all you can taste the acai is non existent.

I would've chosen for some more of the fruits to have been toppings instead of blended in, that could be improved the overall taste. It took half an hour to wait for my bowl and the other bowl we ordered. Nice that there's another acai place close to home.
