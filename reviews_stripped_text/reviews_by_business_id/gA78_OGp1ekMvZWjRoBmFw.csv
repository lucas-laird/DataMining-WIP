2019839,2018-05-27,0,gA78_OGp1ekMvZWjRoBmFw,"So...real highs, and some mediocres here. I will say that the Kalua pig (Pulled pork) and cabbage was way above average for Las Vegas. The meat was tender, well-seasoned, and cooked well. Lately in Vegas, one can expect this dish from Hawaiian establishments to be to overly salty, with chunks of meat and bland flavoring. But here, you get a very flavorful dish that is a real stand-out. The rice was good (read not mushy) and the portion generous enough. A solid dish.

On the down side, you get thin slabs of pre-frozen Mahi Mahi that is under seasoned and not cooked very well. They had areas were the heat didn't get to them evenly. It would be no surprise if they just reheated them in a microwave. Couldn't tell that they weren't. And they had chewy bits to both the fish and the fry. If you were expecting big chunky flakes of dolphin fish- you won't find them here. And the free egg rolls were nothing special. Thanks for the free item though.

Overall, the seating is okay. The people were friendly. The seaweed salad is the same you get everywhere. And the drinks were the same ones you can get for less than half price at the International Market. I found the prices to be rather high for quick, simple food. But, all Hawaiian places in town have that same problem. If I come back- it would only be for the Kalua Pig.",TgW-w80-ketnwdUsjsAaNw,5,2,3,rC0vIW7xFCG9kp7baT7YDg

3107928,2018-05-09,0,gA78_OGp1ekMvZWjRoBmFw,"Ordered fried mahimahi. Unfortunately made with another cheap white fish, probably basa. Not a good impression for grand opening. Either owners substituting for cheaper fish or fish monger selling to them is deceitful. They did offer a replacement order but i politely declined. With so many other food options in area, I probably won't go back.",hpfnDKHQySApsONV5rF9QQ,0,0,1,V9Fi8rGHeMPUfsTWK7urdA

3482856,2018-04-23,0,gA78_OGp1ekMvZWjRoBmFw,"When it comes to Hawaiian barbecue, typically it invokes memories of extraordinarily sweet meat paired with sticky rice and mac salad...and that's exactly what you should expect from Hawaiian Barbecue!

One difference is that the short ribs are not as sweet as you'd might expect from other Hawaiian barbecue spots, but it's actually a good thing; you get to enjoy all of the Hawaiian flavors without having your palette being overwhelmed with sweetness (unless you're into that). 

The rice was perfect, the mac salad was good, this place didn't blow me away, but it's good food for a good price.",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,3,1,4,UaSZD7_D74NlmnUZWDSwFQ

4913736,2018-04-29,0,gA78_OGp1ekMvZWjRoBmFw,Nice little place to get a wide range of Hawaiian eats. Food is well-prepared and service is good.  I forgot that the Hawaiians like their sauces on the sweet side so I simply used the Sriracha and soy sauce provided at the table to season my seafood and chicken.  There were some other goodies that I'll need to try in the future.,8YaFdh5fGg-M6KPIHv7ivw,0,0,4,msKm2cpd-j-Uw3DKj9L1vg
