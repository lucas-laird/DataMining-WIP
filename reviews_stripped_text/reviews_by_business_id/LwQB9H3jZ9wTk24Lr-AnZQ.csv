As we were only in Vegas for a few nights we wanted to make sure we got to experience as much as possible - including the dining. After doing the usual hunt on Yelp we decided to try out Spago and it was a great suggestion.

When we arrived the waiter asked if we wanted sit inside or out and we opted to go outside - best choice! To be honest I thought the blue ceiling was tacky at first but after a while it really started to trick you that you were outside!

I couldn't even wipe the crud and thumbprint off with my napkin. They acted like as it's normal, however. If I were eating at a roadside diner, maybe so, but that's not acceptable to me when you dress up for the prices they're charging. If the dishwasher doesn't catch that, then the waiter should when he sets the table. My gf got the tasting menu, about $100, but when I indicated that I wanted to peruse the menu, the waiter really pushed the tasting menu. As I don't like sashimi or lamb, I wasn't going to taste them but I got the sense that he wanted me to have the same menu as 1) it made his life easier to bring the same dishes out at the same time - isn't a waiter's job to bring the food you order? and 2) it was more expensive than anything else on the menu. I ended up ordering the crab cakes appetizer and duck breast. They were ok, but ok's not what you're supposed to get at a posh restaurant.

We also had the seafood platter full of fresh oysters, shrimp, crab & lobster.  If that is a special don't pass it up!

Service: 3.5/5
Cleanliness:  4/5
Price: $$$

You can find the restaurant within minutes of entering the Forum Shops from the Caesars Palace casino entrance. The restaurant is relatively easy to spot because it has a bright neon sign that says Wolfgang Puck's Spago. We arrived to the restaurant with no reservation around 3pm for a late lunch. 

We were seated in their casual cafe dining area because it was lunch time. The dining room is only open for dinner starting at 5:30pm. There is also a nice bar available for casual drinks throughout the entire day starting at 11:30am.

All dining tables were very clean with comfortable seats, crisp linen table cloths and napkins. We were seated immediately upon arriving because the restaurant wasn't too busy at that time of hour. When seated, one of the waiters welcomed us with the menus and served us with the water of our choice.

We ordered three things for ourselves:
(1) Truffled potato chips with maytag blue cheese fondue
(2) Garlic & Herb marinated roasted free range chicken (hubby)
(3) Housemade bucatini carbonara with parmesan and crispy prosciutto (me).

Our appetizer arrived sometime later after we ordered, and at first, we weren't too excited about how the potato chips tasted. It didn't WOW either of us, but we both agreed that it was getting addicting as we ate through our plate of chips. The blue cheese fondue was delicious, but we couldn't really taste the truffle in the chips. Topped with some fresh parsley on top, the appetizer was worth trying but it's not something we'd order again. We will try something else next time!

Hubby's roasted chicken was delicious. There was no extra side served with the chicken, which hubby actually appreciated because he wanted to eat a little more healthy (ie. no carbs?) for lunch that day. The chicken was full of flavour; it was well marinated and the marinade itself was quite tasty! It was sweet, tangy, and savoury all at the same time, making you reach for seconds and thirds. Hubby loved his dish, and I enjoyed it as well when I tried it; the dish was well balanced in terms of flavour! I'd order a side though to go along with the chicken.

It was my first time trying bucatini, a thick pasta noodle that has a hole running through its centre. The portion of my carbonara was smaller than I expected, but together with the potato chips, it actually made me so full that I wasn't able to order any dessert. :D Overall, my carbonara was good but not great. The prosciutto on its own was too salty for my taste, but it was balanced when eaten together with the bucatini. The pasta was some what bland without the prosciutto as well. Maybe it was because I had a lot of the blue cheese fondue from my appetizer, but I ended up not really feeling the carbonara. When I ordered it, I was so excited, but after a few bites of my carbonara, I wasn't content with my dish like my hubby was with his chicken. I finished my pasta because I don't like leaving food behind, but the carbonara wasn't anything memorable in my opinion.

All in all, our lunch at Spago café was great but nothing incredible. Then again, Spago is more well known for its dining room and dinner service than anything else, so we may give the restaurant another try one day for its dinner. Another reason to visit Las Vegas and the west coast again! :D

The restaurant is casually recommended, but it's not a must-go in our opinion so far. This may change at one point when we grab dinner at their dining room one day. If you're looking for a casual place to eat for lunch though, Spago would be a great fit overall. It will provide you with good food, great service, and enough energy to get you going on that shopping spree!",u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,2,0,3,sikKjsQog_u3uE5moqa02g

Seriously, we joked about fantasies of filling up the tub in our hotel room with the soup and bathing in it.

While we're talking about soup, let me sell you on the mushroom soup. If you aren't a mushroom lover, don't bother. The flavor of mushroom is strong, balanced by the dollop of creme fraiche and scallions. I struggled to get through half of this creamy bowl of deliciousness, as the portions at Spago are certainly large enough for even the heartiest appetite.  

As others mentioned, the service is extraordinary-- even for our group of 7 teetotalers who probably only spent 50-75% of other tables of our size.

Service as mentioned above, was professional but lacked sincerity and did not come around much. Overall, I would not recommend it. It was pricey and food not worth the price.

I had the Indian Notion cocktail--really light and summery with some cucumber and basil simple syrup. 

To eat, the tuna sashimi and tartare was a small serving but pretty delicious. I really enjoyed the tartare with the wonton wrappers. The single piece of sashimi served with it was just okay however. Also enjoyed the Caesar salad which was classic and simple just how it should be.

Went here for dinner; it was crowded, but we had a reservation.. phew. Selection was not bad, but I didn't know what to choose. I ended up with the grilled salmon. I was really scared that it would end up really disgustingly gross like the salmon I had at Vert (in Hollywood.. also a Wolfgang Puck place), but I was quite surprised. It was similar to the salmon I had at the Venetian, but this one was grilled a little longer. Not perfect, but went great with my wine (a chardonnay). The crab cake appetizer was good too, and according to others in my party, the paella got a little salty in the end. The choices of bread given before your meal were quite tasty, foccaccia, some flat bread thing, walnut bread, and a raisin type bread. I really liked the flat bread thing; it had some nice zing to its taste.

As for the atmosphere, it was definitely loud (we were a party of 7, and near us were parties of 10 and 5), the decor was a little too contemporary/modern for my taste. Fair amount of younger people, probably eating before heading to Pure.

Our server was not bad, a little difficult to find when we were actually ready to order. They gave us two glasses of sprite when we ordered one, but luckily they didn't charge for that. We really had minimal interaction with our waiter, but at least he was nice when he came by (that's what waiters are supposed to be anyway right).

Overall.. not too bad.. but now that I think about it, kind of overrated. 3 1/2 stars in my book.",arY2V-MtKksRAoqd-dVYOQ,0,1,3,Re89M5NVAUEV-EfLx33jfg

You could tell everything was freshly prepared that wasn't the issue, I just think the food just sat too long before it was carried out.  We also had a very long time between our appetizers and meal (almost 40 minutes) which was a little odd. Luckily we enjoyed wonderful drinks and conversation so we weren't upset, just surprised.

307757,2010-07-14,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Spagos is the best. That is all you need to know. 

Seriously though... the interior, food, staff, price, bread - all top notch stuff. We went there twice on a recent jaunt to LV in July and both times were wonderful! Being vegetarians, it can be quite hard to find ""tasty"" food in Las Vegas, but at Spagos there is no fear for the non meat-eaters! The first night I had hand cut fetuccini with wild mushrooms, arugula, peas etc..honestly it was an example of simple food done perfectly. A truly beautiful meal. 
The second night, I had a funghi pizza with caramelised onions and porcini mushrooms- definition of NOM. I also tried the BGT pasta, another veggie option of spaghetti in a beautiful tomato and garlic sauce- another spectacular dish. 

Just a warning for future diners, eating outside and eating inside are different experiences. Etating outside, watching people strolling by, (I think!?) is meant to be the café experience, and you get a bread basket to begin with, with a delectable tray of sea salt, rosemary infused olive oil, and rich butter. Inside however, a bit more formal, means you get an amuse-bouche (we had an exquisite leek and potato soup with chive cream drizzle - that stuff was so good, I would have ordered a whole bowl (or trough if they offered) if I could have. ) And instead of a bread basket, a waiter comes round offering bread - making you a bit more aware of looking gluttonous when you ask for more (although the waiters are more than happy to let you indulge!)

Oh the bread...the bread! Scrumptious sourdough, ahhh-mazing cherry walnut, flat bread and fresh focaccia - the best carb-fest you could ever have. And dipped into the little accompaniments ..sheer perfection. 

OOOOOOH and the desserts! For a dessert lover like me, they were mind-blowing. Earl grey ice cream with chocolate sugar frosted old school dougnuts, served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauce? Or perhaps a trio of creme brulee, mint frozen yoghurt and some other caramel heavenly creamy stuff? mmmmmmmmmmm

Finally, the staff are the epitome of what good waiters and servers should be. The first night (unfortunately, I don't remember the guy's name..I do apologise...he was tall, bald slender, handsome and everso charming!) was the best man that I have ever been waited on. He was funny, charming, made sure everything was okay (but not in that annoying ""lets hover by your table while you eat"",) and he wasn't fishing for tips - a rare thing in many restaurants! Ultimately he made the dining experice, and I am ever so grateful to have had the pleasure of meeting him!
The second night, our server was just as polite and courteous, whilst cracking a joke or two, and the bread server was the cutest guy ever ...
cute guy + scrummy bread = heaven? everyone does their job to the best of their ability, and it does not go unnoticed!

All hail Spagos, with it's wonderful cuisine, friendly staff and all at a price that cannot be rivalled. :)",6wSOQmBuqcdu6Z8M8hzTXQ,0,0,5,9hC-BxcV78qLBb_1zEN5Ug

Honestly it was so tough I could hardly cut it with the knife they gave me. And I could not chew it at all. It honestly was the toughest piece of meat I have ever eaten, or I should say tried to eat. It wasn't a 4.00 dollar piece of meat but I paid 41.00 dollars for it. We didn't order a bottle of wine because we decided to eat so early, and honestly from that moment we were treated like homeless people begging for leftovers. Very disappointed. We won't be back.

We had heard that Executive Chef Eric Klein, from Alsace, ""creates a daily changing menu featuring a variety of fresh, innovative dishes,"" so we went for the eight course tasting menu complete with wine pairings.  Chef Eric sent out an amuse bouche of green juice with lime foam, compressed cantaloupe melon and a new signature cocktail made with Pimm's, Pavan (a liqueur made from the Muscat grape and a touch of orange blossom in the South of France) and cucumber bitters topped with a cucumber garnish -- YUM!   If the goal was to amuse the mouth and invigorate the palate, it worked!  Next came a medley of tuna sashimi on homemade rice paper with a seaweed salad and Padron pepper, perfectly prepared and presented -- served with a Sauvignon Blanc from Canterbury, New Zealand.  Next came a whimsical beet dish served on homemade yoghurt and paired with a Gruner Veltliner, Wolfgang's favorite wine from Austria.  Mike, our most excellent waiter, told us that the next dish was ""surf and turf"" -- special extra extra thick bacon and jumbo prawn on a whisky reduction sauce.  The absolute BOMB!  This was paired with a Dr. Thanisch Bernkasteler Doctor Riesling Kabinett, the saltiness of the bacon and the subtle sweetness of the wine went well together.  Next we had the house made pasta (spaghetti) with New Zealand truffles, that are in season now, and imported butter accompanied by a Chris Blanchard made Chardonnay.  The pairing was spot on, as were the others!  Next we were served the red snapper served on a sea of vegetables with the Irony Pinot Noir from Monterrey!  That dish was off the charts perfect, with hot moist fish, crunchy vegetables in a perfect mix of flavor and textures.  Most people would have served a white wine with the fish, but the Pinot Noir worked!  For the protein course we were served slices of duck with a crispy outside and soft inside, cooked medium, served on pureed sweet corn and accompanied by a glass of Rioja Reserva (Tempranillo).  At this point they brought the most amazing intermezzo:  house made pana cotta with fresh berries and lemon sorbet. That was the creamiest panna cotta I have ever tasted.  Dessert consisted of a chocolate beignet, homemade cherry ice cream made with dark sweet cherries from Oregon, homemade marshmallows and one of those fancy French macaroons paired with Taylor Fladgate Port.  Lukas, the General Manager, checked in from time to time to be sure that everything was up to standards and it was over-the-top for us, above and beyond any expectation that we had before we experienced it.  Outstanding service was provided by Mike and Eduardo and the rest of the team.  Each course was presented and described to a tee.  Any questions that we had, and there were many, were answered fully.   What I remember of the descriptions after a three-hour feast, are what I have shared here.   I do not have a menu to consult for the names and descriptions of each, but you get the idea.  Everything is SPOT ON in this restaurant:  the ambiance, the service, the food, the wine, the serving temperature of the wine,  the seating, the music -- they get everything right.  And the price suits the quality of the experience!  When you're in Vegas, be sure to plan a stop at Spago, you will love it too!

So you can tell, I was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. Enough about me, more about Spago. Note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). We sat in the dining room. 

Group of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a Thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in Vegas!). We sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. Awesome. They have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so I got a gin martini. Almost lost some points since the waiter asked if I wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). But whatevs. The martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. It was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in Vegas.  

I had the most elegantly presented heirloom tomato soup in the entire world.  The waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. Stunning. And the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. Very very well done here.

Since I was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a Flay joint), I got the kobe flat iron steak. It was also exceptional. The steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. It was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. I'm only sorry I was too full for dessert.  

They brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and I was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. After I made a tough choice for the bread I had selected, the waiter asked if I wanted something else. It was perfect - I was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. He also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. Also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. Its weird, I've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. Its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. Also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.

The dining area is perfectly decorated. Its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. The decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. Its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. Its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. You are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but I'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.

Its one of those rare 5 star places. Well done sir Puck.",Byo0hbnRlg0pRTUpZDYJfQ,1,1,5,rAUBc616lXiDWDJDxTdDUw

Surprising for a WP restaurant and not very creative.  I also had the salmon salad for an entree.  It was alright but for a dish trying to be asian fusion, it fell short on the Asian part.  It really tasted like a white chef trying his hardest to make an Asian dish though he has no idea what he's doing.  Service was satisfactory but my server could have been a little less intrusive of my conversations and more attentive to filling my water glass which was ridiculously small (even for desert conservation standards).  For a Strip joint of WP caliber, I would expect a manager presence and a table touch even for a slow afternoon, but didn't see any.

For the first time, my friends and I decided that it's time to go eat somewhere nice for once instead of Mc D's and Chipotle everyday meal.  We originally were split into two tables since they told us they can only accommodate 8 ppl max per table.  When we arrived they were able to put both of our tables together.  One thing I didn't like about this idea was that dealing with the check would be a hassle.  BUT thankfully the waitress was able to split our table's check into two.  MAJOR BROWNIE pts!  

Now to the food.  I don't know what my friends ordered, but I'm sure they were delicious.

I ordered:

TRIO OF TUNA
Sashimi, Avocado, Daikon Radish, Scallion and Yuzu-Wasabi
Crispy Rice Cake, Marinated Cucumber & Hearts of Palm with Soy Ceviche-Ginger Vinaigrette
Tartare, Sesame Tuile ""Taco"" with Chili Mayo and Masago Caviar

This dish was served to perfection!  Each small taster was amazingly delicious.  The tuna sashimi was paired perfectly with the daikon radish, scallion and Yuzu-wasabi.  The crispy rice cake was awwwesome!  I mean the fish was good, but fried rice cake...MmMMm!  The Tartare had a spicy kick to it, but not enough to make you scream to death.

COLORADO RACK OF LAMB
Green Garbanzo Falafel, English Pea Hummus, Marinated Heirloom Tomato Fattoush,
Mint-Cilantro Tzatziki and Zhatar

Yum!  The lamb was cooked perfectly.  It was slightly pink in the middle, but not bloody.  The falafel was delicious!  I swear these taste like meat, but not. haha

My friend ordered:

PAN SEARED BREAST OF DUCK
Semolina Fondue, Morel Mushrooms, Cipollini Onions, Carrots, Peas,
Glazed Cherries and Sauce à L'Orange

What more can I ask for?  Normally when I go to a nice restaurant I usually choose the duck or the lamb.  Tonight I had the experience to try both.  It was sure mouth watering!  Really moist and succulent.  Just delicious! MMmMMm I can go for some right now!

Dessert:

Since this was for my birthday...they gave me a free dessert.  A cheese cake with mixed berries on top and a raspberry sorbet on the side.  It was very cheesy and tart.  I'm not a dessert kind of guy, but a free dessert is always yummy.

It was supposed to be grilled...I was expecting a bit of char with tender meat to the bite. Instead it was chewy, had no indication of it being grilled and did not have much taste. Its only saving grace was the white bean ragu it sat over which was delicious.

I'm a huge fan of octopus and love to try it at any place that dares to prepare this very difficult dish to master. The only folks who get it right are the Spaniards (in Galicia, Spain where Octopus is a signature dish) and Greeks, who know how to grill it just right.

Everyone else just can't seem to get it right. It's a shame too, because most Americans have never had it and if their first introduction to it is through a less-than-stellar experience they will be turned off and conclude it's not very good.

Octopus is amazing!",oIvTpmlpzQXdqB2hQXh4HQ,0,0,3,2xTP8z7Q9TyxBZakSvEFsA

489956,2012-01-31,1,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"I've always wanted to try dishes by the famous Wolfgang Puck. Thanks to a recommendation from a fellow Yelper (Pauline Le), I decided to come here while exploring The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. I've read how pricey dinner can be here, so I came for lunch at their cafe around opening. It wasn't too packed yet since a lot of the shops were just starting to open up, but even when the mall and Spago were starting to get crowded after noon, it didn't hinder the excellent service by the Spago staff. The food here is truly something special. Everything you would normally know to be true of a certain dish is twisted up into something deliciously creative. The total bill came out to be about $65 (without tip), but it's well worth the price!

Complementary Bread
Spago serves you a variety of breads, playing with different textures and flavors, with 3 different items for you to dip the bread in (sea salt, butter, and olive oil). The olive oil is possibly my favorite of the 3 dips because it was infused with a few herb leaves (I know it's either rosemary or thyme, but I can't remember). I liked that none of these breads were overpowering in flavor and not so filling to the point where I couldn't enjoy my appetizers and entrees. I had never had a restaurant serve me in this style before, so I loved having the selection and variety of textures and dips to mix and taste together!

Parsley and Cauliflower Soup
This twist on the typical cream of broccoli soup left my boyfriend and me wanting more. It wasn't so hot that we couldn't eat it immediately, but stayed warm throughout the meal until we could devour it all. The consistency of the soup was just perfect: thick but not too thick to the point of clumpiness. It had enough of the vegetables to be filling but not overwhelm your appetite. It might only be a seasonal soup, but if it's still around when you visit, it's a must-try!

Crab Cakes
This is the only dish that I had where I'd say it's closer to the standard crab cakes that you can find at other upscale restaurants, but I would nevertheless recommend trying it if you crave it. This is truly crab cakes done right: thin, crunchy crust with fresh crab inside on a bed of bright tasty greens drizzled with a light vinaigrette. It's a lovely classic that's a perfect starter to your meal.

Turkey French Dip
I've only had roast beef french dips in the past, and me not being a big beef eater, I was ecstatic to see a meat that I love in this dish. I was already getting somewhat full after eating bread, soup, and crab cakes, but the minute that I took a bite of this sandwich, I couldn't stop eating it! It's amazing how one dish made me hungry to eat more after just one bite! The turkey meat was cooked perfectly; it wasn't dry, it was cut very thin, and it had little to no fat. I couldn't believe how incredibly tender and juicy it was; it was only more amazing in conjunction with the french dip. I can't emphasize enough how this dish is a must-try!

Mushroom Pizza
This pizza had no tomato sauce, which I appreciated because I wish my pizzas would always come this way. It was very thin and had only cheese and 1 mushroom on each slice, but wow was the mushroom cooked to perfection. It was so tender and juicy and harmonized beautifully with the rest of the cheese pizza. It wasn't my entree and I only had 1 slice of it, but I wish I had enough stomach space to have eaten more!",8twzupHtIu7kWKA6_Vyeog,2,1,5,fFD3vQGPCQpAc_NaVfmYOw

When talking about Spago itself, there are several things i enjoy, the decoration and the music suit my tastes very well and make for a nice si down dinner. The bar is solid, i love being able to walk in without a reservation, sit down, and order a great pizza or dish of mussels for a very fair price.  Great people watching too, Vegas brings in every type of person from every type of country, and that's as good a show as anything i have paid to see!.

Go to Spago when you want to try something new. I have read reviews here of people being dissappointed about pasta dishes and other common every day fare. My memorable dishes have been tuna tartar in a crispy wanton shell, lobster salad served on an Asian soup spoon, pan fried sardine over a citrus vinaigrette slaw ( which was mind blowing!) Some awesome mains i have had have been duck breast with cauliflower puree and root veg, where the fat was rendered off and made the meat ridiculously delicious and the skin crispy and perfect.

Pros - totally awesome decor and ambiance.  Loved the feel of the place.  The food was phenomenal, at least the food I ate.  I ordered this apple, fennel salad that came with prosciutto, mozzarella and goat cheeses and lightly drizzled with some sort of vinegarette (*spelling) sauce.  I was impressed with the presentation and, of course, with the taste.   Portion-wise it was perfect for me!  I ate it all and left satisfied; I did NOT feel bloated or full. 

However, my friend, the birthday boy, didn't stomach the pepperoni pizza and had some complications the next day.  So I guess... don't order the pizza.   My husband got the pasta bolognese - I had several bites and it was just as spectacular as the pizza.  

Cons - Floor was waxed too much... and the bathroom is on the second floor.  So if you have to use the restroom, don't hold it in too long.  Also,  I saw three women on different occasions walk down the slick steps from the bathroom and they ate it hard, especially with those heels they were rocking!  Anyway, they should consider putting in non-slip pads on the floor if they are gonna shine the floors like that.

The dover sole was so-so, served over their version of potatoes Lyonaise, which were also just OK. tiny piece of fish that had no flavor. The white sauce was watery thin.

With completely transparent giant blocks of ice (no white showing), the drinks in those glasses just looked magically elegant. It really stood out to me.

Second when she told us the today's special, she told us about the clams with garlic butter which she said was delicious so we ordered it. When our meals came what we got were mussels in garlic butter sauce and I asked the waitress, "" I thought you said that it was clams with garlic butter."" She looked at the mussels and told me yea that is clams. The person who placed the food down said no that is mussels. The waitress never apologized and just walked away.

The sommelier suggested an amazing red wine from Santa Rita Hills: Gypsy Canyon... And I thought I was done with Pinot Noirs, but this wine was atypical for a Pinot Noir. It wasn't light, but more medium body and fruit forward. It paired beautifully with everything we ate. So I can't recall the order of what was presented to us... Tuna sashimi, amazingly fresh scallop, flavorful fennel soup... I admit I should have written this last week, because I can't recall each & every dish.

Although unnerving while watching you dine, the wait staff does a great job of answering questions and clearing dishes from the table.  The pizzas are highly recommended but be willing to shell out some money for the drinks, cocktails and wines being the most unreasonably priced.

I went to Spago on New Year's Eve with my girlfriend.  Fortunately I made reservations the week before.  Our reservation was for 7:15 but I showed up a little early and was seated by 7:05.  There are two menus you can choose from; the cafe menu of the dining room menu.  The dining room menu has your meats and fine dining while the cafe menu has brick oven pizzas ad the like.  We opted for the cafe menu and ordered drinks, an appetizer, and our main meal all at once.  Unfortunately they all came out at the same time (very quickly, about 20 minutes after ordering) so our pizzas got cool while we ate our calamari.

The cafe, although mostly open to the Forum Shops street mall, was not as loud as you might expect.  Conversation was easily audible.  The wait staff was friendly and had no trouble answering any of the questions I had about the menu.  It is a little unnerving however since the wait staff lines along the side wall when they are not helping diners, observing the dining room and seeing if any diners need them.  They just stand there...looking...watching....constantly vigilant.  That aside, they do great at being Johnny on the spot for clearing dishes and helping with questing.

The calamari served with their sweet chili sauce was fantastic.  The chicken sausage pizza was equally fantastic and was a fairly large portion that I almost did not finish because it made me full.  The drink prices were the most unreasonable and unpleasant thing I encountered at Spago.  Soda is $4.50 and the cocktails range from $10-17.

However the food was underwhelming to say the least.   If I was eating in a airport cafe or a 3 star hotel lobby, the food would be decent.   It was plain boring and lacked any intensity.

Since we didn't want to melt outside in the 40 degree heat, we opted to stay in Caesars and enjoy as much of the air-con as we could. We glanced at the menus for a number of places, but Spago's Cafe menu really jumped out at us. We asked for a reservation for 12 people at 6pm, but they told us 6:15 would be better. Fine by me. We sauntered back at the specified time, but had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to be ready. I also had to cut back the number since we couldn't pry all of the ladies away from shopping and the pool. 

I am so glad they have round tables! For larger groups, I love round tables, easier to talk, easier to see people... We were given the dinner menu, but since they are so nice, they allowed us to order from the cafe menu. Phewf... because I based all my choices on the cafe menu. Plus, the other ladies all ordered pizza and pastas. I opted for the wedge salad and the crab cakes.

They start to place our napkins on our laps... yikes, this is a fancy place. Then, they bring a plate with salt, butter and oil for our bread. Wait, where's our bread plate? Our server comes around with a huge bread plate to serve us. I was tempted to tell him to leave the whole plate. Too ashamed to ask, but we each asked for at least three slices of the different breads. I got the sourdough, the onion foccacia and some cracker-y bit. All good, better if there was more.

All the food comes at the same time. Our table is overloaded with food... my salad is in front of me, but my crab cakes need to be placed in front of my neighbour because on the other side, her fresh oysters and pizza are taking up all my space. The salad is pretty good and big... is it $14 good? Well, it's a decent wedge salad made spicy by the pepperoncinis around the wedges. It's hard to eat this dainty as I am not. I try to cut each bite before I put it in my mouth, but I get lazy and just slice the whole bit and pick at it. I know, I ordered it that way... but again... lazy. The crab cakes were really good though. They were tiny, but good. The outsides were crisp and the insides were jammed with tons of crab and almost no filler... there weren't huge lumps of crab, but nice shreads.

Since I am stuffed to the gills with lettuce, I opt not to get dessert. Neither does anyone else. Since I made the reservation saying we were celebrating, they send over some beautiful chocolates with raspberry filling. Those were wonderful.

It gets incredibly busy at Spago, so you're always better off calling ahead for a reservation. Otherwise, your best bet is to find a seat at the bar (same food menu). The location in Caesar's Forum shops is ideal, especially if you're there for a show at the coliseum.

we also had two pizza's that were both excellent. thin, wood burning over, toped with the right amount of cheese, toppings etc.....doesnt get better then that...or very rarely does.(about $15 each)

being that this was also a famous chefs restaurant (wolfgang pack) and its location in the ceaser shops i would say this is a great place to eat, food was very good, service was great.

I vaguely remember going to Spago in Beverly Hills as a youngster with my parents and recall how food forward and posh it was 30 years ago, so I figured that going to Spago as an adult in Las Vegas was going to hold its own.  I was sorely mistaken.

I was staying at the Aria and had reservations to see Absinthe (which was AMAZING!), so I chose to go to Spago because of the proximity and it's reputation.  We got there about 10 minutes late due to traffic, but they were very accomodating up front and sat us promply.  The restaurant was relatively uncrowded at the time (I believe it just opened for the evening), but they sat us in a table that was in the corner and right next to the doorway that the waiters use constantly between the kitchen and dining room.   I immediately noticed that this wasn't the seat for us, so we asked to be moved and they accomodated us, but I still wasn't sure why they chose this poorly placed table even though there were many tables open.  

The waiter was very pleasant and informative and I quickly told him that we had a show at 8pm and apologized for being late, but stressed that we wanted to be on time for the show.  He said that it would not be a problem at all to make the show on time and that we shouldn't worry at all.  Then he preceded to show us the wine/drink list and handed us an IPAD????  I thought this was very tacky for a ""high end"" restaurant.    We then were handed the menu, which had a nice assortment of dishes, but I didn't feel that the dishes were all that ""food forward"" and it didn't have many options for my vegetarian wife.  I asked him what are some of the ""signature"" dishes that he recommends and he said that it is a little cliche' to answer that question, but he reluctantly made a few recommendations.  He then gave the option to my wife of a vegetarian entree that the chef puts together himself and spoke of how wonderful that dish is and that he often recommends it to non-vegetarian diners.  I thought he was blowing a little smoke about that and the rest of his recommendations, but we made our order (3 courses as recommended) and kept our fingers crossed that we will have enough time to make the show.  They came with the bread plate options (which they claim were voted the best in Vegas), which were good, but nothing special. I liked that they continually came to the table and offered us more bread throughout the meal.  The waiters who filled your water was also very attentive, but borderline too attentive.  I would take a sip and he would quickly refill my water before I put the glass down.

My first course was the lobster salad....it was not good at all.  Minimal amounts of lobster (come on, this is VEGAS!!...I expected practically a whole tail for that price) and it was a very small dish and the flavors just didn't mesh.  It had the obligatory dots of sauce and a variety of ""fancy"" items on the plate, but I was underwhelmed.  My wife had the arugula salad, which she claims was the best part of the meal, but I still thought the price was too much.  Then there was a 15-20 minute gap between our first course and the second and I started to get a little nervous about the show and I thought the gap was just not timed right for the meal.  A large party then entered and I didn't see our waiter practically at all for the rest of the meal.  I found another waiter and stressed again that we are running a little late for the show and he talked to the kitchen to speed things up.  My second course was the seafood risotto which was not bad.  I then found our original waiter and asked for a diet coke, which he then forgot about and I didn't receive.  Another gap between our courses again and my wife and I started to get pretty disappointed that the kitchen wasn't being attentive at all to our situation.  Finally the main course came and I had the duck, which was also nothing special, a little fatty.  My wife's vegetarian dish just felt like an afterthought and we quickly had to scarf down our main dish to make the show.  My diet coke finally came after I asked another waiter and he said claimed that the soda dispenser was just being repaired which I felt was a lie.  I had to find yet another waiter to ask for the check and we quickly signed it so that we could make the show.  I would have loved dessert, but that was not in the cards anymore.

All in all, Spago in Las Vegas is completely underwhelming and not worth all the hype.  It was just as good as any other restaurant in a mall and I wouldn't waste my time going to this restaurant when there are so many other great ones in Vegas.  I'm still fuming that I could have made so many other quality choices.",GePYjVMZTY9y-vJMQS0mrA,0,0,2,pOSZc9J_HF5KW0vLVdRCyQ

They have a great, more inexpensive cafe menu for lunchtime and if you eat on their 'patio' overlooking the Forum Shoppes at Caesars. Such a fan.",5DhIf6kNjIejyrIwl5CvUA,1,1,5,UCUN6Ji6AWvJFGe2zCS6aQ

977227,2014-09-24,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"To be honest... I have been here a few times before I wrote this review. This review is relevant to my last visit and every previous one as well. 

Sat on a Tuesday in the dining room and enjoyed the tasting menu with three other people. Warm welcome as I came in from two managers and the hostess. Tip: If you like tastings, this one is $120 ... Tell them that is what you want to do up front. You get VIP treatment from the beginning (kinda like booking bottle service in the club). Anyways, awesome greet. 

Upon seating everything is really easy. You can do wine pairing or just order to your liking. We chose to do cocktails and order to everyone's likes, but the wine list looked awesome... Maybe next time. 

Food was spectacular, my favorites being the tomato salad and sea bass. Presentation of every dish was original and with a purpose. Artistic enough to cause conversation every course. The flavors that ensued caused all conversation to cease immediately. Only smiles and moans ensued. 

Service was top notch. Everyone who approached the table ( easily 10 different people spread out over two hours) knew their role and executed properly and with no pretentiousness and the perfect amount of personal. Mickel was our point guy and was awesome the whole time. The executive chef even came by our table a few times to check on us... This really made the night special because you can tell he is super humble and appreciative of everybody who enjoys his food. He makes you feel like he prepares the dishes just for you and his only goal is to make you leave with a smile. 

The entire meal was amazing and I can't wait to go back.",qc7S2BfPk8hAJcmcLsJshA,1,0,5,f38U34tMiw7esSSGgGZ0WQ
981245,2012-01-30,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Let's start with the best server, hands down, in Vegas.  And this time I got his name: James.  If you're coming here for lunch, make sure you ask for one of his tables.  As I've said before, he is a consummate professional and represents everything a server should be: engaged and informed and really interested in making your meal (even at lunch!) a memorable experience.  He will go out of his way to make great suggestions and accommodate requests.  I still think he should get some kind of award!

Now to the food: the goulash is back.  Unless it seems too heavy for you, this is not to be missed!  It's got a ton of meat (beef) in it, of very good quality and the sauce really has a nice kick.  A 1/2 chopped salad was a great starter and the Baked Alaska was a good follow-up as a relatively light dessert.

My only caveat is that they are not shy about using salt, and while I don't find anything over-salted, it is the predominant seasoning in many of their dishes.  I think if it works, it's totally legit, and it does.  But if you're not a fan of salt, you might mention that they go easy on it when you order.

Also, the iced tea remains the best anyplace, ever...!  (I don't think I've ever given a shout-out to the iced tea before!)",F_N4NyoMJWzBYFspeYfH3A,0,0,5,CtTBjNs2CWrWF92PiOzRuQ

My friend's Simple Salad had a beautiful presentation.  She said it tasted really good too.

I ordered the Hand Cut Spaghettini TBG.   I had seen another customer with it and it looked really good, but I was hesitant to order it because it was vegetarian.  I'm glad I did though.  It was absolutely amazing!  I didn't miss the protein for even one second.  This was clearly one of the best pastas I've ever had in a restaurant.

We have been to many others and wanted to try the original. The service was excellent and the food was yummy. We got a variety of things to share. The waiter was fine with sharing. 

The articholk soup was amazing!  We got the shrimp and crab risotto. My friend doesn't eat crab and they were very accommodating and made it without crab. It was very good. The house salad was nicely dressed with a citrus dressing. We all shared the chicken with mashed potatoes and the steak entre with seasoned potatoes. 

We shared 2 desserts, a chocolate creme and a pana cotta. The chocolate dessert was very rich and delicious. The pana cotta was the only thing I didn't care for. I expected it to be smooth and creamy and the texture didn't appeal to me.

Extremely amazing service.  Everybody was very attentive and accommodating.  We brought our little boy here because we were invited by a good friend and some of his coworkers since we were all at the same conference that weekend. Very thoughtful of them.  Anyway, the staff was extra attentive to our son and really took the time to attend to his needs even though it was really hopping that night.  

For example, when he was a little fussy and I had to take him outside to walk around a bit, they gladly kept my food under a warmer for the few minutes that I was outside.  

The food was amazing as expected.  I will reel off a quick list of what we had.

Iced Oysters on the Half Shell  with Ginger-Rhubarb Mignonette - Fresh and tasty like the sea.   I believe they were Kumamoto Oysters.

Wild Pacific Blue Shrimp - No preservatives here.  Fresh fresh fresh.

Symphony of Tuna - Can't explain all the ways but yum, yum, yum.  

Chilled Maryland Blue Crab Salad - A spoonful of goodness. A bit of avocado, grapefruit segments and a lemon vinaigrette along with the crab served in a Ramen type soup spoon.  Wow.

Grilled French Sea Bass Loup De Mer - Crispy skin and cooked perfectly.  The mousseline was nice.

Pan Roasted Bone-In Veal Costoletta - Sorry Veal Haters :(  This was very well cooked and despite being under the heat lamp for longer than the chef would have liked I'm sure (read above) it still was cooked very well and was tender as can be.  The risotto was oh so savory.

From the words of my party, the Salmon was the best that they have ever had, the Halibut was so good that it resulted in a clean plate, and the Filet was just ridiculous and served with the WGP signature bone marrow.

I love good food and WGP never disappoints.  Many thanks to our good friends for a great meal and next meal is on us.",n3JHodOofpXO3wtSYdbOsg,2,2,5,Y8c83bWlVWs6rPq-6J7XbQ

I don't mind paying a lot for a really great meal, but this was not so great.

White asparagus salad was tasty but tiny portion.  Didn't live up to the waiter's raves.  

The beet salad was pretty good but again, a tiny portion and too much yogurt everywhere.  Also, shavings of beets are not very appealing.  

Also had the grilled octopus.  This was a big disappointment.  I have had some amazing warm grilled octopus served with raddichio and balsamic vinaigrette elsewhere.  But this had no interesting flavor combinations, just kinda blah and not even a very impressive octopus.

The risotto with crab and shrimp was actually very good.  But if we're being fussy, the shrimp was overbroiled to the point of being very tough.

This was just not a meal that remotely warranted the price (about $250 for 2).",5lesN5-BTHun0_LkdMbYHQ,0,0,1,J5vThUkns7Sy76-G2q_aSg

I say that because, after we had our salad and tasted the pizza, we were apprehensive about whatever would emerge next from the kitchen.
The value in fine dining comes from the value-added by the chef. This means flavor and creativity. But, what I found here was simply an assemblage of ingredients with no discernible contribution from the restaurant. We make goat cheese and beet salad at home with an orange vinaigrette dressing that IMHumbleO is fantastic. But, Spago apparently is too sophisticated to put leaves or dressing on their salad, opting instead for a DROP (literally) of olive oil and b. vinegar with a few pulverized specks of walnuts on top - not even candied, or maybe they were but there was too little to even taste.

The lamb pizza wasn't very good. It was dry and flavorless. The lamb had no taste - I almost thought it was pepperoni, except that that might have tasted like something.

The bread was cold and dry, served alongside cold butter.

The service? Well, I mentioned that the waiter completely forgot my order. It was the handcut fettuccine. He even asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp on it, and still forgot all about it.

Entrees for both consisted of the FARMERS' MARKET WHITE CORN AGNOLOTTI - Sweet & fresh off the cob caramelized Corn, Celery Leaves and Locatelli Pecorino Romano in this little, itty, bitty cheese filled pasta......both sis & I were literally mopping up ALL the left over sauce w/ our bread. Would probably have licked the plates had the room not been completely packed & there was a need for a modicum of decorum.  Also - be sure to pair your pasta w/ their Merlot......it was fruity & light & not only completely complimented the Corn, but enhanced the flavor in the bestest way!

Dessert was the perfect topping to this most scrumptious meal - Assorted Cookies for sis & Pear Cobbler for me. Cookies were warm & gooey - freshly baked to the point we squeezed a cookie & schmoousche, out comes a globby bloop of chocolate.

I went there for my birthday and ordered the Pad Thai.  Yes I ordered the Pad Thai at Spago and it ended up being the best I ever had.  Coming in I had high expectations. 

To start off, I thought the restaurant is reasonably priced, especially in Vegas.  When we got there it was relatively empty and so we got a table of our choice.  I definitely recommend sitting in the open area so you can watch all the people walk by and it's not as stuffy as the inside.  

We ordered corn soup, grilled octopus, halibut, and steak.  My friend said the steak was very good and so was my halibut.  The soup and the grilled octopus were also delicious but I think I've had better grilled octopus in other places.  The one downside of the octopus was it had too many beans.  It was mixed in a bed of beans and since I'm not a fan of beans, it all went to waste.  Because the restaurant was relatively empty, the food came out as fast as mickey d's which I wasn't too thrilled about.  When you're having a business dinner and want to be able to chat for as long as possible, it's probably not a good idea to send the food out so quickly.  Also for the price of the restaurant, I thought they would have paced themselves however that didn't happen.  We skipped dessert since we were full so I can't give any comments on it.

First of all, we were bad and decided to sleep all day. This meant that we waited until 11 pm to eat dinner. One would think that this would not be a problem in Las Vegas. I clearly remember a wilder youth when this was not a problem. However, that wilder youth had much lower standards and we looked far too nice to settle for the cheap crap at O' Shea's. After several closed doors and unsympathetic hosts throughout Ceasar's, we found this place still open in the mall. They had a limited menu, but we didn't care.

Our adorable, brunette waitress whose name I sadly forgot was stellar. Super friendly and attentive. Ten stars. No question.

The food was ok. My non-Italian father could make better pasta. And I didn't like his pasta when I was growing up. However, the pizza was pretty good. Not incredible. But pretty good. Even the New Yorker tolerated it.

The drinks were terrible. Both my manhattan and his martini were undrinkable. 

The bathrooms were a disaster. Absolute disaster. They looked more like the bathrooms after the 7th inning of an A's game rather than those of a nice restaurant in Vegas. I know it was midnight when I went, but come on. I should not have only one choice of stalls to go into because the others were dirty, strewn with paper products, unflushed, or had menstral blood dripping across them. Have some pride and clean your %$#@ing bathrooms. And while on the topic, seriously ladies?!?!?!?!? How drunk and tore up are you that you can't flush a toilet or wipe up your own period? Cleaning bathrooms is gross enough without your careless antics. Nasty skanks!

So, get the pizza, order drinks they cannot screw up, and use the casino restroom instead.",iovWFbA1UtMGDJ4C8hbhYA,13,10,3,IM0CzORKblnfQo3fxYPmYA

The calamari was served with a side bed of marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm in coriander vinaigrette and with garlic aioli and sweet chili dipping sauces. The skin wasn't too thick, but it didn't taste like anything special. The garlic aioli wasn't really my style, but at least the sweet chili dipping sauce was good. (Although it could have used more kick to it as there was virtually none.)

The unagi glazed scottish salmon salad over romaine lettuce, daikon radish, shiso, avocado, celeric remoulade, steamed jasmine rice, and Japanese vinaigrette was probably my favorite dish. Really!

The disappointment of the afternoon (other than not eating at my first choice, Mesa Grill) was the wood fired mushroom pizza. It was covered with roasted portabella mushrooms, caramelized white onions, Italian parsley, and parmesan cheese. The mushroom flavor was strictly confined to the bites with mushroom directly on it, which I understand, but I expected the flavor to extend beyond just a little bit. Maybe it was having the parmesan cheese melted as the one and only cheese, but it just wasn't my style. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ?select=sx7d_nf9JyNQXQDILFchbA

I have never had octopus that basically melted in my mouth like that before. 

I had the seafood pasta and that was equally as delicious. It wasn't too creamy and didn't sit heavy which is hard to find with cream-based pastas. Others in my party ordered steak and they described it as one of the best steaks they've had. Wolfgang Puck sure knows his shit.

Started with the fried calamari and a caesar salad. The calamari was so light and fluffy and not greasy at all (I'm guessing it was tempura batter?) and the caesar was fresh with real anchovies on it. We then split the oxtail gnocchi which is hand-made. I usually don't order gnocchi because it reminds me of dumplings and are dense, but these literally melted in our mouths. The oxtail is braised for 24 hours (per our server) and man-oh-man was it tender. We also split an Italian meat pizza which you can't go wrong with.

The hostess was nice enough to offer a multitude of seating, but we could have cared less. I blame the tourists for making the host so unsure of their selection. They always say ""we want that seat"", no "" we want that seat"". In any other town what the host picks, the guests gets. It was given to you for a reason you may understand only when your food takes forever or your service starts lacking, but I digress.

The restaurant is beautiful on the inside without all the gaudiness of MIX or the thumping of the club restaurants. I ordered the open faced meatball sub which was made with chicken and my friend ordered the bolognaise (their spelling, not mine). Perhaps, they got tired of ppl mis-pronouncing it.

It's odd when you go to a restaurant and expect nothing. You become instantly happier. I didn't ask if there was a side with the sandwich. At the least,  I just expected it to be a sandwich on a plate. I got that and much more. An overly tasty, perfectly portioned and seasoned salad with a saucy chicken meatball sub with gooey melted mozzarella cheese. The pesto sauce didn't hurt either. The bolognaise looked like the best bolognese I've seen in quite some time. Saucy, meaty, rich and it smelled wonderful.

The server was pretty cool in that he left us alone. I guess two guys eating alone don't need as much attention as a married couple, old people, or two people who have never eaten out before.

This pizza tasted just like pizzas I have had at California Pizza Kitchen except theirs were better.  My pizza at Spago had onions on it- the description on the menu did not say it came with onions.  Quite frankly, the combination just did not work.  The onions and olives overpowered the flavor of the sausage, which was pretty tasty once it was off the pizza.  The reggiano cheese also did not work for me.

When I am paying over $15 for a pizza, I expect better.  This is the second time I've been disappointed with a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to skip his restaurants.",B2oMf4iy4rnwT1a7cdzcpw,0,0,2,88IFxJy30c0-Mpd-jsl0QA

Margarita pizza - mediocre. Simple in flavor.

Caesar salad - great dressing and a good size portion for one. They ran out of anchovies so I didn't get to taste that.

For those not familiar with the restaurant scene in Vegas, Spago created the casual dining/fine dining and celebrity chef boom in Las Vegas.  Prior to Spago, nearly every hotel boasted about it's all you can eat prime rib and shrimp buffets.  Spago, when it opened in 91 or 92 (can't remember) transitioned Vegas from a quantity to a quality town.  So for those of you that have eaten at Joel Robuchon, Alex, Picasso, or any other casual/fine dining establishment, thank Spago.

Okay, onto the actual review.

My mom and I started off with fried calamari.  The calamari rings were fried to perfection, no greasiness whatsoever.  The rings were crunchy on the outside, yet moist and tender within.

For my entree, the I had the braised beef short ribs, and my mom had the seafood risotto.  Both entrees were excellent, the short ribs I had were tender as expected and extremely flavorful.  My mom's risotto was also delicious.  It had the starchy consistency you'd expect from a risotto, yet the rice was still a perfect al dente.  There was also a medley of seafood to accompany her dish, too, which she thoroughly enjoyed.

There are many restaurants in Cesar's Palace and I must say this is the best!

I started with the Cesar Salad which was great the lettuce was crispy and cold. The dressing was not to lite nor too soggy just perfect. The dressing did have the fresh hint of anchovies (so if your not into aroma of anchovies skip this).

Next was the two pasta dishes...

I had the Wild Mushroom Ravioli first was mushroom ravioli with english peas, garlic, caramelized shallots and reggiano cheese. This dish was the highlight of my night! I would give this dish 10/10 amazing amazing! The pasta was soo moist and fresh and if you ever tasted fresh made pasta you know what it tastes like. The dish was just soo fresh and lite overall the sauce was a very light mushroom sauce that went great with the pasta because the pasta was soo fresh and you wouldn't want to have a heavy sauce go with fresh pasta (cause thats a no no).

The Mushroom Ravioli blew me away so I wanted to try another pasta dish...

Next came the Hand Cut Spaghttini T.B.G.

Very simple yet very delicious!  Tomatoes, basil and  garlic (hence the T.B.G.) in a Pistou sauce or a cold sauce made from cloves of garlic, fresh basil, and olive oil. Amazing the dish was soo homemade and yet it had this kind of sophistication and technique that blew my mind.

The place was not crowded, actually almost empty for a Saturday night (7PM) and I  do prefer the buzz of a filled restaurant so it was a bit of a let down. 
Hubby ordered a bloody mary which was NOTHING LIKE THE ONES WE'VE HAD HERE BEFORE.  This time they served a plain old bloody mary.   The ones we had BEFORE even had a pickled green bean in it but more importantly, this one had almost no vodka in it.  You expect a good strong drink at a place with this price point. The skimping is truly unnecessary.    
The bread basket which preceded our meals was very good, especially the cranberry bread.  
The lamb dish was good although the faro served with it was not too tasty.  They decorated the plate with a border of sour cream all around the plate despite the fact that hubby can't have dairy.  We didn't expect it to be there because it wasn't described on the menu.  We wiped it off and didn't complain about it. 
The chinese chicken salad which was always my favorite was delicious although I found it over-dressed this time.  Still, I ate every bit of it.

I ordered the pepperoni pizza ($17) and it was delicious!! I was seriously probably one of the best I've ever had. The size is between a small/medium so you can easily share it if you order an appetizer, but it can also be enjoyed by one person.

The waiter was friendly and service was fast. Since I was on my lunch break and dining alone, I enjoyed people watching to pass time while I waited for my food. Coming here for lunch gives you the nice atmosphere of fine dining, but it was more laid back and a lot faster.

I believe they give you a discount for having a Total Rewards card. Maybe 10%?

My only complaint, paying $4.50 for a coke. Woflgang Puck didn't make the coke...so why so much? I guess it's better than paying for each refill...",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,0,0,5,u99xnOzQsLy202hJo8a2Dg

Food has always been good here. Really, everything I've ever tried has been good. Their cheesy flat breads / mixed breads that they bring before your food are ridiculously good! When I used to live in Vegas, I used to drop in every once in a while just to get a drink and grab a couple of those crunchy cheesy flatbreads!

After all the hype this restaurant seemed to have, I really had high hopes for a fabulous meal... unfortunately, this was not the experience we had.

First off, the service was awful.  We ALMOST got up and left because it took 15 minutes for our waiter to greet us and ask for our drink order.  By that time it was close to 9PM and we were starving.  Once we finally ordered, we waited a really long time to get our food.  I'm not sure if it was just what we selected, but I really wasn't happy with my meal.  We had the lamb pizza and the fettuccine.  The pasta was OK, nothing to write home about and the pizza was awful in my opinion.  The crust tasted funny as did the sauce.  I really was disappointed.

Mushroom fettuccine - Really like this dish. I thought the pasta was just right and the mushroom was really good. The sauce was perfect. Everything just blended well together.

Tuna Sashimi -Crispy Rice Cake, Marinated Cucumbers, Hearts of Palm with WasabiGinger Vinaigrette. Best sushi I have EVER had IN MY LIFE! The sashimi melted in your mouth while the rice cake added just enough crisp to give it a little zing. The sauces complemented the flavors perfectly! 

And since we weren't too hungry, we split the Wood-fired Mushroom pizza which consisted of Roasted Portabellas, Caramelized White Onions, Italian Parsley and Parmesan. I don't even really like portabellas and this was the best pizza ever. The cheese was great but not too cheesy, the pizza felt light and tasty, and the crust was perfectly baked and crunchy. I have died and gone to food heaven.

I recently attended a wedding reception in Spago's private room on the second floor and it was an amazing experience. We were treated to a four-course meal as well as several trays of appetizers and an open bar. 

While the room doesn't have much in the way of decor, it was spacious and provided a quiet spot away from the hustle of Vegas to mix and mingle with the 40 to 50 guests of the wedding. 

I'm a self-proclaimed picky eater and skipped the passed appetizers, which included spring rolls, crab cakes, lamb, mushroom and goat cheese flatbread and calamari and shrimp flatbread, but my boyfriend liked the mushroom flatbread. Honestly though, it's a good thing that the appetizer selection didn't appeal to me because I was stuffed after the four-course dinner. 

Just a reminder, all of our food was selected off the private dining/catering menu and not the regular restaurant menu. 

First, we started with a Green Goddess Salad, which included butter lettuce with avocado and green goddess dressing. I'm not sure what green goddess dressing is exactly but it's delicious and I may have to look for a similar type of dressing to use at home. So good! 

Our second course was gnocchetti with beef bolognese sauce. While I'm not typically a fan of ground beef in my sauce, I was able to push the larger chunks aside and the gnocchi was wonderful. My boyfriend, who is a vegetarian, was able to get a non-meat sauce with his. If I had been thinking more clearly, which alas I was not due to the open bar, I would have requested the same. 

The main course offered a choice of scallops or New York steak. I chose the steak and boy was that a great decision! The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had great flavor. The little potatoes that it's served with were also wonderful and I was very appreciative that the waiter was able to serve my plate without bacon as I haven't eaten pork since I was 10 years old. 

Finally, we ended the meal with a caramel cheesecake, topped with a scoop of coffee ice cream. I'm strange, I know, but I can't stand the taste of coffee and the ice cream ruined the cheesecake for me. But I was already so full that I wouldn't have had room for it anyway. 

All in all, despite my fancy food reservations, it was a great night filled with great food and service and I'd recommend giving Spago a chance for your next big event. I looked it up online and they have quite an extensive list of choices for the courses so you can make your own menu,",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,8,7,5,36fOOr3Gwh3An4zbN22wig

Once upon a time, in a Vegas far far away (in 1992, actually) ... Puck's Spago ushered-in the concept of 5-star, celebrity-chef Vegas dining venues. And, for many years, Spago was a significant draw contributing to The Forum Shops' customer traffic ... not only due to its chef-branding, but due to the glitterati that could often be glimpsed dining on its patio.

But Caesars' management wanted to gouge him on the rent. So that's the end of that. Caesars' executives sure know how to teach someone a lesson when he doesn't wanna play ball, what by forcing him to set up shop in The Bellagio and all.

This ain't the only high-ender to vacate The Forum in its more recent history. Quickest to come to my mind: An Escada storefront ... and Truefitt & Hill, Britain's barber to the Royal Court and seller of exquisite & upscale men's grooming product. But there's been plenty of others.

Caesars' management will likely have to bust up the floor space and parcel it out ... in order to get the higher price it wants. So be on the lookout for Sbarro, White Castle and Panda Express franchises soon enough.

I often eat alone, being single and hungry tends to make that happen, and prefer to sit at the bar.  It was a late dinner--around 9pm on a Thursday, and the bar was relatively empty, so I sat right away and was greeted by the bartender, Amalia (sp?) promptly and ordered a glass of their house Sauvignon blanc.  I always ask my server/bartender what they recommend, with an idea of what I want, partially because I'm indecisive and also because I figure they know best.  I was debating between the crab cake or tuna tartar appetizer and Amalia suggested the tuna.  The plan to order a pizza as my main course was diverted when my neighbor at the bar received his plate of duck and I looked at it longingly.  So the tuna tartar and duck it was. 

The tuna tartar was yummy although your basic chopped tuna with avocado. The crisps that came with the tuna were a nice vehicle to stack the tuna on.  Overall, fresh and a good amount for the price, but not crazy out of this world amazing.  The duck with roasted corn and creamy polenta (if my memory serves correctly) was delicious.  I take my duck medium and it was cooked perfectly, with crispy skin and great seasoning.  I love corn and it was fresh with a nice slightly charred taste from the roasting that I enjoyed.

We had a fairly big group (9 people) but we didn't have to wait at all (we had a reservation) and our service was impeccable throughout the entire dinner.  The food was fantastic as well! I got the filet mignon and nibbled on the truffle spaghetti. The truffle spaghetti was soooo good. I loooooved the flavor and wish I had got that myself. I also nibbled on the sea bass and that was perfectly cooked and really good. The majority of my group got the special of the night, which was a spicy tomato sauce pasta with lobster and seafood. Everyone said it was delicious and practically were licking their plates. We also ordered the seafood platter as an appetizer and another appetizer I can't recall. For dessert we had the apple cobbler and salted caramel soufflé and both were great. 

My only complaint is that I ordered the filet medium and it practically came out alive that's how rare it was. For $60 a steak I was expecting it to be perfect so I had them cook it longer and when they sent it back it it came back still a little less than medium rare, which I just can't eat. So I sent it back again hoping third times the charm. This time it came back medium but by the time it came back everyone in my group had already finished their food. I'm a slow eater so I felt a little anxious and tried to eat as fast as possible. However, they comped my meal, that's how amazing the service was! And when the steak was cooked medium it was really good. Not as good as Mastro's but still good. 

This is a great restaurant if you'd like something a little upscale while in Vegas. It's perfect to eat here if you are watching a show at Caesars. The food and service can't be beat!",_v73c6e9bo8D5TyIa8V0WQ,1,0,5,znXbwSCGgrY-LJVBqxcKdQ

Unfortunately, we forgot to make a reservation and the wait was too long for us to go there and the concert we wanted to see that night. So my boyfriend and I consulted Yelp and OpenTable and discovered that Spago was supposed to be tasty AND had seating available immediately. We scurried over to the Forum Shops.

We were seated quickly, but our waiter decided to ignore us initially. The manager came by and started to take our wine order when the waiter finally decided to come by. Our service was just fine after that, so props to the manager. 

After checking out the menu, we decided on two different pizzas: the lamb chorizo and the Greek. We chose the former because everyone seems to rave about it in their reviews, and the latter because, well, I heart Greek-style pizzas like nobody's business. We chose a tasty glass of albarino to go with our meal.

The pizzas were great, especially for the price (yeah, $15 for a pizza, but it's Vegas!). Honestly, we could have shared one and been plenty full, but it was nice to be able to taste both types. The lamb chorizo was hearty, meaty, and delicious, but the Greek pizza was my favorite. So many awesome, fresh, flavors. It made me happy. 

We were so temped by the desserts (particularly the Smores thing; that sounded amazing) but we weren't even able to finish our pizzas, so we decided dessert was a bad idea. 

In summary, we were not expecting to dine at Spago that fine Thursday evening, but we did, and it made us happy.",Wo_ASbM3pzJ4r1Qf6CcNOA,2,1,4,YM1q8IAP4VDJI4_RDYeIbQ

Originally the steak was supposed to come with pommes frites, but I substituted the potato purée for no additional charge.

The clams were fantastic, and it's something that my friends and I still talk about to this day.

- Asparagus salad (white/green).  Served soft & cold.  Very different from what we expected but it was GOOD!
- Pan seared duck breast.  Once I took my first bite, it was over.  I didn't want to talk to my husband, and I just wanted to keep eating.  If you looked at my plate you probably would've thought I licked it clean!  Not an ounce of anything was left.. their duck is really comparable to some Chinese restaurants if not better!
- Braised beef short ribs.  Not an ounce of fat on them!  Two juicy big lump pieces came delivered to our table and I look at my husband, and I already knew he was thinking 'that's it? that wont be enough' .. but he couldn't even finish his meal!
- Bread pudding.  Wow, the bread pudding here was better than some places we had it at in N'awlins!

Our salad came split for sharing, its like they already knew!  AWESOME!
Another server came with a plate of fresh bread for us to choose from.. he gave us one of everything! All of it was really good, the sourdough, pretzel, and cranberry walnut were our favorite!

Service is top notch here!  Servers cover your glass while pouring so it doesn't splatter all over the place, they brought my wine with an extra decanter, and they even scraped the crumbs off our table with crumbers..

The night we went, the managers were on the floor making sure everything was perfect - ABSOLUTELY perfect. He stalked the waiters every move & when something wasn't right, he would scold them right in front of us and made us KNOW that he was making it right. Now, I'm all for good service.... but I definitely felt the tension as a guest. I knew they were being closely watched and it ruined the personable experience and relationship I could have gained with the staff because everything seemed way too forced and faked just to make the manager happy - not the guests.
 I also know that they've had some bad reviews on service in the past so it's probably the manager trying to whoop the staffs asses into shape, however it would probably be best to leave the ""scolding"" to a more private area where the guest can't see or hear what's going on. Definitely a tense atmosphere. 

HOWEVER, I can't deny that the service WAS perfect and so was the food.

I knew Spago was going to be pricy, but every dish was about $10 more than I was expecting still. A dish I expected (based on similar surrounding restaurants) to be about $35 was $45 and this was true across the menu. Because of that, we had to skip our appetizers. 
I had the short rib and my friend had the lamb chops. My short ribs were good, but didn't live up to the expectations I had (which were admittedly high). The flavor was great but they were the fattiest short ribs I've ever had so I had to cut large sections out. 
My friend's lamb chops were fantastic but they came with risotto. This is when things went downhill. The risotto was forgotten at first. They then admitted the mistake and brought some risotto. However, the risotto they brought after they forgot it was undercooked - noticeably undercooked. We complained and they took it back and brought some new risotto. it seemed to be the same risotto but a helluva lot hotter. Maybe they just undercooked a large batch of risotto and scooped out some more undercooked risotto or maybe they just zapped it in a micro. We gave up on the risotto.

The service was another issue. The chef came out briefly and said how was our meal. He said this before we had gotten any food so he just turned and walked away. Very awkward. And we never had the same waiter. It was someone different doing everything so when we had the issue with the risotto it was very difficult to correct it.

Maybe it was an off night, everyone I talk to seems to love it, and the food wasn't bad, just nowhere near as good as expected. But for that price, you shouldn't have an off night like that.",4HvIzTHB9o-aI6M8IO3SPQ,0,0,3,75kXXnqF_Q9TqILwYKaRKQ

2. Never smiled 
3. Checked on us only once during the meal
4. Everyone in the restaurant received their amuse bouche except us (our bill even listed it came with the meal but we never received it)
5. Our food took a long time and she never once came by during the time we waited to reassure us it was coming out or was apologetic.
6. No smile, I didn't feel welcomed


On to the food. We ordered the braised short ribs and the veal. The short ribs were excellent, came with knocchi on the bottom, very well portions. With the veal, I would skip it. Maybe I'm not a veal eater but it reminds me of pork chops. Overall, I think the wattress really left a bad taste in my mouth so my appetite was not well.",1Pq3DI2Hh3wazBwiM13XFA,0,1,2,9f6N0GZhQcyUEQqiEsEA6A
1897495,2018-01-14,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,Went here with some friends on a vacation to Las Vegas. While the food was good it came in rather small portions. So much so that my friends were still hungry after dining here. The music they had playing in the restaurant was rather loud and we had difficulty  hearing each other when we talked. Service from the waiter could of been a bit better as well. Over all it wasn't entirely bad I got to eat food I hadn't tried before and the experience was a good one. But for the prices they charged for the food the portions could of been a bit bigger. While I am a fan of rock music and liked the music the restaurant had playing  they shouldn't have it blaring to the point you can't hear people speak to you at the table. TURN IT DOWN  SOME. Also at these prices the waiter could of been more attentive. Went to Planet Hollywood after eating here and got food that was good with larger portions. Would I recommend this place yes. But only for the experience of trying food you may not of tried before and if your willing to pay a bit for it. And also if your not very hungry.,biHf21MGH7AfrXnuCF309w,0,0,3,n3RM8jRAC9bPP26e5HaoFA

The prices are high here $30-50 per entree but definitely worth it. I got the short ribs and it came real quick and was absolutely incredible... The ribs were amazingly tender and just melted in my mouth. The sauce on top of the ribs matched them perfectly and the gnocchi that came with it was well cooked and very chewy.

The food wasn't even the best part of the visit... Definitely thought the best part was the service. It seemed like our waiter was always RUNNING EVERYWHERE and when my glass was even slightly full, it quickly got refilled. In fact, there was a moment when the waiter actually bumped another customer because he was walking so fast. There was never a moment in which we felt neglected. 

Awesome place! Probably won't come here regularly because of the prices but I'd definitely come again for a special occasion!",1Q5Nf077W0g3GTRgrSraug,2,1,5,PhYz46ZPyQ07qopAtOVt9Q

Heard amazing things about the smoked salmon pizza. I mean, I've had urth's smoked salmon pizza but this blows it out of the water. It's really the pinnacle 5/5
The crispy rice with tuna tartare was also quite delicious. The crispy rice was in a thin cone. It was slightly sweet and was thin enough that it didn't get stuck in your teeth like a lot of crispy Rice's do 4/5
Another surprising appetizer for me was the dumplings. It definitely tasted like homemade dough and the filling seems authentic. It was not too thick, not too thin and was surprisingly tasty. 5/5
I got the sea bass entree. The skin was crispy, the fish was well cooked and well seasoned. No complaints here 3/5
The desserts were really what took this meal to the next level.
The salted caramel souffle. Amazed. However you have to eat this quickly or the texture does change from the beginning to the end of the dish. It went from tasting like a fluffy flan to a dense marshmallow 5/5
Pot de Creme came in the shape of a brick. But it was still that same fudgy, dense chocolate 4/5
Caramel apple crisp came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and had a nice homey feel. On the verge of being a little too sweet but I found myself keep going back for more. I like desserts like this 3/5",4jfZjMs9AUqJS-1kF24o5w,0,0,4,9VeU998sdI1vGYUneAF6Mw

Service is always great here and today was no exception. They offer half portions for lunch and I opted for a half portion of spaghettini arrabiatta while the wife chose the Atlantic salmon. Everything was great and the wife could not remember when she had a better salmon dish. 

The prices are a little high, but you can get a 10% discount by showing your total rewards card. All in all, Spago offers great food from pizzas to pastas, fish and everything else in between.

They have 2 menus - one for fine dining and the other for pizza, pasta and lighter fares.  We waited 30mins to get seated for the latter.  Our table was right by the opened area where we could people watch, especially the young women decked out with their skin tight mini skirts while struggling to walk in 4-5 inch heels. (it was the nite before NY eve)  You can tell the heel pros from the intermittent heelers, they wobble more.  
Our waiter was really nice and after looking at Jr. Yelpers Giants hat, told him that Pablo Sandoval sat in the table behind us only 1 wk ago.  
We shared a 10 inch chicken sausage pizza with slices of sausage on top, sweet bell peppers scattered around.  It was savory with a hint of sweet.
I had a delish handmade fettuccine with mushrooms from Oregon state, $20.
Jr. Yelper and hubby had the steak, i came sliced up with mashed potatoes or fries.
It was quite filling and we had to decline on dessert.  I'd recommend this place if you're looking for food in the Forum Shops.  Good food and nice wait staff.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,2,2,4,4ZfOgsc7n8ErgOZr1xHzrg

We ordered the halibut, short-ribs, salmon, and their signature smoked salmon pizza, and not one of them was even remotely impressive. If anything they were below average. The salmon pizza had too much lox on it, and looked more like a smoked salmon party platter for bagel day at work. The salmon was a little burnt and completely smothered with some kind of teriyaki sauce. The short ribs I didn't try, but from the others who did try it, it definitely wasn't a winner either. My halibut was decent, but presentation sucked. When it came out everyone started laughing at my dish because it looked like the fish was sitting in a pool of foamy soap.

The food was mediocre, nothing special, but nothing bad. I started out with a special salad and had the halibut for my main.

We put our names down(without reservation, and on am evening, I can understand that there can be a wait). The hostess said we'd only wait 20 minutes, so we walked around the Forum. After, we came back but our table still wasn't ready. We went to the bar and had overpriced, weak, and too sweet mojitos. My dad kept trying to nicely ask the hostess if she knew when our table would be ready, as we saw many open tables and other groups being promptly seated (he didn't mention that, though, because he isn't rude). However, she was very short with him and would keep making a point to not walk near us. 

Also, I went to the bathroom at some point, and the other hostess who came in opened the door quite briskly and almost hit me hard. She kept walking by me without any apology or acknowledgement. Overall, the hostesses seemed much more stuck-up than they needed to be. 

Our waiter was really nice, but the busboys were rude. One poured water without thinking and spilled water on our Canon camera. He also took away my mom's drink when she was only halfway done with it. We did mention this to our waiter who felt terrible and got her a new one for free.

Again, the saving grace here was the food. The pizza is out of this world. The Chinese chicken salad was incredible - huge portion but maybe could have used more greens. The pasta sauces were flavorful. Even the bread loaf given to us was fresh.

However, I really wasn't comfortable due to the service. We may have been tourists, but we weren't obnoxious or tacky. We were dressed quite nicely too. We spent good money there and could have been treated better.",dvWnOPjPjNOr3IiXte-jog,1,0,3,jIXF1jheNxD5T_5BIdoqjg

Having High Expectations of this place, I came with an open mind or more like an open mouth and empty stomach. I've actually had both lunch and dinner here. 

Greek Pizza: Fresh, ""Zesty"" (had a ""Zing"" to it) and bursts flavors from the Greek Isle

Mesquite Grilled Prime Filet Mignon: The Filet itself did not exceed my expectations but rather just satisfied my urge for Filet. The zucchini, onions and tomatoes were worthy. The Potaotes were alright, not all that great. The Bone Marrow was the Superstar on the plate! I love that tiny scooping spoon that they expect you to use.. The marrow was rich, slippery, fatty, oilyand had a concentrated beefy broth flavor!Oh So Delicious!! Forget the dessert give me another one of these, Please! (Careful, if your worried about your figure or if you don't work out.. Eat it Easy..)

Spago Pancetta - Wrapped  Meatloaf: Not bad, not bad at all.. Now this was a dish that had some thought put into it. The Meatloaf  had a mild but complex flavor that didn't remind me of a traditional home cooked meatloaf, rather an Excellently Executed Gourmet Meatloaf. Every bite with the potato, loaf, gravy and sauce was Absolutely Mesmerizing! Now, this is what I'm talking about!

Spaghettini T.B.G: Sometimes Little is More.. Tomatoes, Basil, Garlic, extra virgin olive oil and pistou (garlic, fresh basil and olive oil) = Simply Perfect!

Anyways, I loved the onion foccacia bread, and the goat cheese spread was good at complimenting the 4 breads they had to offer.   We tried the chicken lollipops.  Those were actually pretty good. although the drumsticks were really really tiny.

Winston M. tried the pepperoni pizza, because the waitress had mentioned that Wolfgang Puck was more known for his pizza's, and I remember him fully enjoying it.  I had another friend try out the Kobe Beef burger.  It tasted pretty good, although I probably wouldn't have gotten it well done like my friend.  Well done to me takes out the juices and flavors.

The biggest change in the Vegas restaurant scene in the last 5 years is the proliferation of Name/Celebrity Restaurants.  The trend that Wolfgang Puck and Emeril started 25 years ago has exploded with very mixed results.  Prices have gone through the roof, quality has diminished and many of the new 'name"" restaurants treat you as though they are doing you a favor by allowing you to eat there.  Not so at Spago.  Some how they have been able to keep the same creativity, commitment to excellent food and outstanding service that they brought to Vegas a quarter of a century ago.  Perhaps it is because the General Manager, Carlos, is an ever present force.  Keep an eye on him; he is at the check in desk, behind the bar, in the kitchen,  at your table or seeing you off as you leave.  Nothing happens at the Spago without him being aware.  Contrast this with the snooty teenagers who have become the face of far too many expensive restaurants.  Spago is not cheap...but it is not expensive either.  Expect to pay about $40 per person on the patio (which is still the best people watching spot in Vegas) or about $65 per person inside.  But after far too many $250 a person meals, that are many times less than mediocre, when deciding where we want to go for a special occasion we often choose Spago.",sW0Am6XyqKqQnY3m1lX7-A,1,0,5,GlBZCnRCaitAbCAehhN-Uw

In fact, in a lot of ways, it's pretty much an entirely different restaurant - food quality, menu, atmosphere, decor, etc. However, that said, Spago Vegas is still a great place. (Just don't think you've been to THE Spago because you went to Spago Vegas.)

For me, I prefer Spago Vegas as a lunch spot and like to sit on the patio or at the bar, as opposed to in the main dining room.

Oddly enough, my favorite thing here is actually the wings. Yep, the wings. They're these little drummettes that are just absolutely heavenly. Just the right amount of spice and vinegar. And a scrumptious blue cheese sauce for dipping.

Ok, and the pizzas, pastas, and salads are great too. And ok, pretty much everything else is good too. And the cocktails are excellent. I am big fan of the pineapple mojito.

My boyfriend decided to take me here for our one month anniversary. I was really excited to try this place out, since I heard so many good reviews about his food.
The food, service, and ambiance was perfect. I wouldn't have it any other way.
We started our dinner with half a dozen of fresh oysters (Beausoleil Oysters). I am extremely picky with my seafood, especially if they are oysters. I absolutely can't stand oysters that aren't fresh! I'm the type of person who usually never sends back food unless it is raw or not fresh. 
Their oysters were so fresh and I couldn't stop eating it. If you have chance you should try out their sauces. I typically only eat my oysters with a squeeze of lemon, but I decided to be spontaneous and tried their  red wine mignonette. It was so refreshing and interesting to try something different.
For entrees we got the spicy linguine and wild mushroom pappardelle.
I highly recommend trying both if you're craving for pasta. The amount of shrimp was perfectly proportional, usually places like to serve you three to four shrimps per pasta, but Spago doesn't play. The wild mushroom was super creamy and well seasoned. The mushroom was cooked to the right texture, not too hard or spongy.
The only reason why I didn't give five stars was the wait time between appetizer and entree was fairly long. It took 20 minutes to get both of entrees out when the restaurant was pretty slow.
Regardless, I can't wait to come back here to try his other dishes. I highly recommend that you check this place out if you happen to be near Caesar's Palace.",B7e7gS9fPqKJ0o8hhhwG8Q,1,1,4,6AMgOov8JLnD_E0cUJ60GQ

My GM knows the GM here so we were treated to some extra personal service. We just let the staff pick whatever and bring it to us. I think the three course dinner ended up being a 7 courser.

The service was exceptional. The waiter knew his stuff and was able to make quality recommendations. He returned at all the right times, without us feeling like we were being stalked.

The food was just as exceptional. I had the half chicken with roasted vegetables and potatoes. The chicken was seasoned very nicely and the potatoes were mashed and creamed just right. I really enjoyed the various bread options. I was actually a big fan of the cheddar and bacon bread. It is definitely worth trying. And dessert...we had the grasshopper cheesecake. I was amazed how light it was!

I will say that when we first arrived, I wasn't sure what to expect. The restaurant is actually two different restaurants in one, with two different menus. In the front, with seating leading out into the mall, is the cafe. This is a much more casual (and cheaper) option than the back of the restaurant. However, as we walked to our seats in the back, I was impressed with how seamlessly the two different restaurants blended together. An interesting concept that was well executed.

When I return to Vegas, I would definitely consider another visit to Spago.",ovGcSqLo0rqYMgnM6ejfVQ,1,0,5,IgujR6TytHWrHJpq8FTTiA

Our server mentioned asking for chocolate chip mint ice cream with the peanut butter soufflé is another good way to go.

you can almost anticipate the outcome of your meal from the bread basket alone. parmesan crisps, onion focaccia, and raisin bread, all wonderfully fragrant and fresh. when paired with the rosemary infused extra virgin olive oil, the flavors collide and explode.

special soup of the day was green garlic soup. surprise chunks of portabello mushrooms and tender spears of asparagus heads lay hidden in the velvety rich soup. the garlic was not overpowering, but perfectly spicy. a ring of creme fraiche and some toasted mini croutons round out a perfectly hearty and generous portion.

the calamari fritti with garlic aioli and asian sweet and sour sauce. a side of asian cucumber salad. i must say, it was probably the best calamari i've had to date. crispy and tender, the calamari went extraordinarily well with the smooth garlic aioli. the sweet and sour sauce and the cucumber salad added the asian flare with a kick.

the pasta special was seafood and angel hair cooked in a white wine sauce. the seafood was extremely fresh and the pasta cooked al dente. the sauce was light and appetizing.

hand cut fettucini with mushrooms, fresh arugula, and english peas in a cream sauce. buttery noodles gently caressed in a delicate cream, accentuated with savory mushrooms, peppery arugula, and sweet peas. if it was not hazardous to my health, i wouldn't mind having a large plate of these noodles every night.",4PIcs3X-Ro_KoczDJ3y4ZQ,4,3,4,-ufNYljn9VGEx6k0xXnclw

It was more of a salad than anything-  the shrimp was very plump and juicy, the other veg. was fresh and crisp- and the dressing was bright, tangy and refreshing.

The chef came out and introduced himself prior to it as well. We decided to split a salad to start, with arugula, prosciutto San Daniele, and burrata cheese. We then each had a pasta and split it. I tried the spaghettini with truffles, she had the gnocchi. The spaghettini was al dente just how it needs to be, and the truffles.... I'm salivating! Lastly, scallops and duck breast. The texture of the scallops was perfect! Even the bread was awesome. Everything was so amazing. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

It took awhile to get our drinks and we never received any bread.

I ordered the Chicken Sausage pizza and Gnoochi, my date a pear and apple salad.

The pizza was ok, the Gnoochi serving was small, and without bread, not filling. It wasn't creamy/rich enough for my liking, but would have made a perfect appetizer. 

The pear and apple salad was very good! Great combination of flavors!

I came hungry (as usual) and was surprised to see how packed the place was considering it was a Tuesday night.  I can't really say much about the appearance of the restaurant except that the dining room reminded me of a modern-style cafeteria.  

I started with ordering a peach bellini made with prosecco.  It was just your standard Bellini, but I did get a sip of my friend's Cosmo, which was sweet and good.  The bread platter arrived shortly after receiving our cocktails.  Breads offered were a cherry walnut, parmesan crisp, sourdough, and caramelized onion foccacia.  I opted for the parmesan crisp and the focaccia.  The foccacia was soft and doughy, it didn't even need any butter!  According to those who had a taste of the cherry walnut, it too was yummy.

Our waiter took a while to take our order, but eventually I was able to get my request in for the English Pea Soup with lemon cream, the duck (split), and halibut (split).  Before our appetizers came out, we were served an amuse of a rich, creamy soup spiced with fennel and lemon.

Next up was our appetizers.  My pea soup tasted like fresh spring peas with a touch of lemon and cream.  Very good.  Also note that all the Wolfgang Puck restaurants serve organic fare whenever possible, definitely a plus.

Our entrees took a while after our appetizers were cleared, which was a little lame since we were starving.  But finally they arrived!  The duck was awesome, done rare served with a L'orange rhubarb sauce, semolina fondue, ciopollini, trumpet mushrooms, peas and turnips.  The halibut, with sauce rouille, was a little overdone and lacked flavor, but the seafood risotto on which it was served on was really good.  

Lastly dessert.  We split the creme brulee and the chocolate dessert.  The brulee was not the usual (served in a ramekin and torched).  Instead it consisted of a custard atop a layer of phyllo dough and a sugar crisp.  Kudos for the attempt to deconstruct creme brulee, but I think I would have rather had a more traditional version.  The chocolate desert was served with a chocolate espresso ice cream which was melted by the time we were served, however it was still pretty good.  I didn't care too much for the moussey chocolate desert, but my friend ate it all, so I guess to each their own.

All in all, Spago has pretty good food.  The reason for my 3 stars?  Service and timing was off.  Also some of the dishes could have been executed a little better.  Not too shabby though.

Important:  Beware of the first and last step respectively to and from the bathroom.  I think I may have seen about 5 people eat concrete on the steps within the two hour time period I was there.",hyIGLrzgG3Bbe1ue73ZM_w,0,0,3,EzdyOVTXeRHxN3s-Eig_ow

No worries though because it all came down to taste. This is hands down the absolute best corn soup I have ever had in my life. I decided to share my soup experience with my friends and everyone was shocked as well. The soup is not too heavy but very fulfilling. The tuna sashimi was also delicious and refreshing.

We ordered...
Tuna Tartare - The fish was fresh but there seemed to be Orange zest or oil which made it taste odd.
Truffle chips - The sauce was drizzled on it.  Some of the chips were drenched while others had nothing on it.  I wish the sauce was on the side or drizzled in 2 sections (bottom/top layer)

Having eaten there before for lunch, we decided to try  it for dinner. After looking at the menu, we decided to share most courses, starting with Calimari, then a Caesar salad, and finally, the italian sausage pizza and a bowl of gnocci.

The food was good; my only complaint about the food that that the gnocci was $21 and the portion was small. 

The reason for my 3-star rating was the service. Saying it was ""attentive"" would be an understatement. I like attentive service just as much as the next person, but the waitress and her assistants acted like they were in a Keystone Cops' movie where all of the action is accelerated. I no sooner put down my fork then the next course came and had not finished my glass of wine before the bus person whisked it off the table. It was very obvious she wanted to turn the table for the next diners, but honestly, for a check that totaled $95 before tip, Spago should let its diners relax a bit.

The bread is outstanding! A server walks to your table and shows you a tray of bread. Wow.. it's a bread galore for carb lovers. I ended up getting one of everything since I wanted to try it all! I love the flatbread since it is so crispy. 

For the appetizer, we ordered the Trio of Tuna. This dish is highly recommended if you love sashimi! Wow! The tuna was extremely fresh and each one had a great flavor. YUM! I could have ordered two of these appetizers. You can easily share this appetizer with another person as each type of tuna came with two pieces.

I took a liking to Luis (they call him Lulu, as apparently there are many Luis's there), as he used a napkin to refill water to avoid splashing on the guests. I commented on this to him and he was flattered. But what I was really impressed with is that at one point, my 80 y/o mom and sister went to the bathroom mid-meal, which was upstairs. Lulu noticed that my mom was intimidated by the stairs, so he offered his arm to personally accompany her to the elevator. My mother was most impressed!

We were stranded on the expansive grounds at Caesar's Palace and figured the wisest choice was to check out the restaurants inside the hotel. 

That being said, we headed straight for the forum shops!
A quick stroll lead us to Wolfgang Puck's world famous Spago!

Having dined previously at the iconic Beverly Hills location, I came with an expectation of good quality food and great service. 

We were running late so we wanted a quick but tasty meal. With the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating. Within moments, we were seated and began perusing the menu. 

For appetizers, we enjoyed the oysters on a half shell. Let me tell ya, these lil' guys were fresh, plump and with the addictively tangy cocktail sauce, it was a virtual party in my mouth! Foodgasm guaranteed!

Now onto the entrees:

Spaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - I've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when I had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, I was instantly sold!  There's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! If you haven't had it fresh I strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. It's phenomenal! Each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. The richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.
And the chicken? Tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that I devoured in a flash!

Lamb Chorizo Pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  Now this was my kinda pizza pie! It was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. The lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. The chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! 

Service was prompt and friendly. Our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. We enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!

Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying I'd  definitely come back.  Hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.

Until then,

However, it was always a little pricier than it should have been but given its location and our family tradition, we were willing to forego this consideration.

The menu had been revamped and our familiar casual choices were gone.  The bread basket was replaced with an offer of one piece of bread per person. Moreover, the $20-$30 entree range had been replaced with most entrees in the $30 to $50, with one beef entree over $70.  We ordered a range of things and most choices were still pretty good (although the crab spaghettini was dry and crab seemed right out of the can) but portions were small and so the meal seemed disproportionate to prices.

I enjoyed that the atmosphere of this place it is classy yet accessible.

As soon as I was seated, I was asked what I would like to drink.  This time my water was kept on a silver platter on my table.  Nice touch, but I would have preferred it kept on ice. (I know. I'm spoiled.)  In fact, they weren't too on top of the ""let me refill it for you"" thing.  When my waiter made his way to my table, I asked him if they had a Thanksgiving special.  They did, and he gave me a very informative description of the courses.  I told him I would take it.  He offered it a la cart instead of the full menu.  I had to assure him that I wanted the full menu.

The Butternut Quash Soup with Cranberry Quince-Apple Chutney, Candied Walnuts,Cardamom Cream and Pumpkin Seed Oil  was amazing.  Never have had that dish before, but it really did taste like Thanksgiving.  The bread course was certainly one of the best that I've had.  The main course was Roasted Free Range Turkey Roulade with Pretzel Bread Stuffing Knodel, Green Bean Casserole, Sweet Potato Puree with Brown Sugar, Yellowfin Mash Potato, Cranberry-Apple Chutney, Bay-Leave and Clove Turkey Au Jus.  I cleared my plate.  In fact my waiter came back by and saw it, smiled, and said, ""Wow. Good Job.""  It really made me feel a whole lot better... then I began to think that this was one of the best dinners I have had.  I was thankful that even though it was impossible to go home to family, it was not impossible to enjoy a wonderful dinner.  I had espresso and perused the dessert menu but nothing caught my eye.

All in all, this was one of the best dining experiences I have had in Vegas... I really wish that there was something remotely comparable off of the Strip.  In fact, I plan on returning to see if this was a fluke or if this place is the real deal.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,1,1,5,rD-aILqhVV3ezZbLf0bPtA

This is the kind of food I love to eat. Fresh, clean flavors, where you don't leave feeling like you inhaled grease for two hours. The service is impeccable, and the entire waitstaff is knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient. The wine list is superb, and we were never dissatisfied with our waiter-recommended wine selections.

Throughout the two dinners we ate here, we tried the artichoke soup, the variation of beets, the chilled maine lobster salad, the raviolo, roasted chicken, sea bass, dover sole, filet, lamb, and the duck. Can you tell we loved the food? Everything was perfection. There wasn't one single dish that met with a mediocre response from anyone. The artichoke soup was absolutely to die for and was perfectly creamy without being too decadent. The beets were out of this world as well, and I could eat them every day. I had the sole and sea bass, and they were both delicate and melt-in-your-mouth with just the perfect amount of crunchy, silky vegetables underneath.

For dessert, we tried the chocolate cremieux, the peanut butter soufflé, and one of the special desserts on evening, a strawberry consommé with fresh pound cake and lemon sorbet. Everything was outstanding, and even though were stuffed both nights, we managed a few bites of dessert each time.

I am most certain that I will go back to Spago each and every time I am in Vegas in the  future. It is just that good.",xsZ4s7a4MaBIh48MdMkkPw,1,0,5,LAYEWyQEsYJxODeuR60nMQ

The host was very polite and they should endorse the 20 % which showed on the Yelp website but she went to get a final confirmation, which is fine. All a sudden there was a man came up to me and asked what I need. Firstly, he didn't greet at all and went straight to me what I need. Alright then I told him my question and then he asked me how many in parties. I told him 7 and then he said no WE DO NOT DO 20 % for holiday weekend. If that case, you should have told me at the beginning not right after asking how many in my party. Wolfgangpuck should be a very well organized restaurant chain and should have a better customer service. This man who gave me the non sense was the manager Carlos Perez, even your host took another step to answer my concern but what you have done. Judge how many people in my party then decide the discount. I am not going there cause the discount but since there is a promotion on YELP then why not? 


I do hope Jeff Evan the GM of this worldwide restaurant chain store can really have a better communication with your team or clear the miscommunication with YELP.

The famous Spago's restaurant was always talked about and seemed to be the rage amongst all the experts.  Well after all the times I've been to Vegas, i think it's about time I tried it.  It didn't disappoint either.

The Vegas restaurant has two sides to it, the dining section and the cafe.  Cafe side as you can imagine is of lesser fare and more wallet friendly.  However the dining section is where the true meals are at.

The Mozzarella appetizer was perfect to whet our appetites even more for the main courses.  It was seasoned perfectly with fresh tomatoes and wasn't too heavy on the oil, vinegar, or the basil.  Plus the presentation was good as well.

The main courses were equally as good.  The grilled ahi was seasoned with the right amount of sesame, and the outer edge was seared just right to give it a hearty meaty texture.  The freshness of the raw part was really enhanced because of this.  The lamb chop I had was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a wonderful marble glaze on it that didn't require me to have any mint jelly with it.  The gaminess and wild flavor of the lamb wasn't over powering as well and fused with the glaze and seasonings to give a burst of flavor with every bite.

We were quite please with our experience here as the service was very attentive and pleasant.  Reservation are recommended for the dining room section, although you might get lucky and get someones canceled table if you do a drop in.",e03iPZLuSJ5_3LY4TOp2iQ,1,1,4,d89IkwYVASSyF7jrWEAzAA

I've been here several times now, and I've never had a bad meal here. I love that you have the option of sitting in the 'patio area' and enjoying their more casual 'cafe' menu or sitting in the dining room and enjoying the regular Spago restaurant. Both are great options with their own pros.

The patio area is FANTASTIC for people watching. The menu is always changing, and the food is always great. The wood fire pizzas are always a great choice. They're perfect for sharing between 2 people. The fried calamari is also very delicious. The service is wonderful., and they also have one of the yummiest bread baskets ever! 

The menu for the dining room is pricier and fancier. The food and ambiance is great.  It is much quieter than the patio; perfect for special occasions! The dishes are very innovative and delicious. This menu changes daily. I haven't seen the same menu twice. I believe they also offer a tasting menu in the dining room for the foodies who want to thoroughly experience all that Spago has to offer.

The desserts here are WONDERFUL. Kudos to the pastry chef! Definitely save room for dessert when dining at Spago. Last time I was there I had the Lemon-Blueberry baked Alaska. It was amazing! I loved the flavors!  Also, while all the dishes on the regular menu are prepared with peanut oil, many of the dessert menus are not.

So you can come with kids and still have great food and a great place for a great price! Aside from the rowdy crowd who trickled in later in the evening it was a good experience.  They only lose 1 star for the limited beer/drink options.  But have a long wine list so if that's your cup of tea check it out.,OWNs70BTeodatibzRl_reg,0,0,4,tEL4BtUTFJUBqd7v3knnEg

We started with the minestrone soup ($12.00) the vegetables were not over-cooked (I love that), and kale salad ($13.00) - light dressing, like a Greek salad but with kale - black olives, cheese, tomatoes, very fresh.

Ended with a vegetarian (primavera) pizza for $14.00, cooked perfectly. The problem was not in the food it was the service, took a while to order our drinks, brought the wrong ones, could nit get refills, the first course finally came, them they did not clear our plates for 25 minutes, finally the pizza came, after we reminded them, and asked a third time for refills. 

Then had to ask another sever to get our bill be cayuse our server disappeared (for 10 minutes), he came back into view and took an order for a party of 10. We realize things can get crazy but there are others that can help out. Stay out of the middle tables, they seem to be the ""runway"" to others and we were forgotten along with the table next to us.

Spago is in a great location. You can sit in the ""patio"" section and watch everyone go by. The restaurant decor didn't leave an impression on me, but the waiter definitely made the meal more enjoyable. 

Since everyone raved about the panchetta-wrapped meatloaf, I ordered it. It was like no meatloaf I'd had before, NOT that I eat meatloaf that much. 

It had a great consistency and flavor, and the crisped panchetta was a good touch, especially since it was served with another soft item, mashed potatoes which, BTW, are really good on their own. Another crunchy item was the onion rings that topped the meatloaf tower. They were pretty standard, but you could tell they were hand made and were fried to a really good crisp without being greasy. I had about half of it because it's quite a large portion. 

If I'm ever in the area again, I'd try their wood-fired pizza, which is what my lunch companion had. I can tell you she was very happy with her Italian sausage one.",bUDWJ7EwOYCSIKvcUCHpWA,0,0,3,tpoe6aK5WJUj0HQ-7pAFiQ

My fiancé, myself and two friends were seated in the dining section, by reservation, and our waiter was Michael. Michael explained the menu very well, though I was not happy with he menu. There are 3-5year old photos on Yelp, and most of hat food I did not see on the menu. Honestly, I still don't understand there menus. I saw burgers being brought out to other tables, but it was not on the menu. I am not used to eating at such fancy restaurants, so I did feel a little out of place. I'm really not sure what happened, but after we order, Michael our waiter stopped coming by our table. Our theory is he wanted to get a bigger tip from the large tables coming in. By the end of the night, I wasn't sure who was waiting on our table anymore, there were so many different people coming to and from or table. Also, I ordered a second round of mojitos when our meals came out, and they didn't come out until after we finished eating. We did get the mojitos on the house but were not happy with no drink during my meal.

Overall, I was not happy. The bill for four came to almost $270. That included 4 of the prime New York Steak and potatoes, for $48 each.

Aiming to try a celebrity chef owned restaurant in Vegas (isn't Vegas all about names and brand?), four of us stumbled upon Spago, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, after being rejected by Mesa on a Saturday night.  

The setting is fairly minimalist and modern.  I particularly liked one corner where a giant white chandelier hangs against a simple dark brown wall.  

The service was really really slow and the waitress was aware of that.  I saw other tables waiting for food for quite a while too, so it wasn't just us. 

Food: well, the walnut cherry bread was good which we gnawed on for quite a while waiting for our food to arrive.  We each had 2 oysters.  One I had was really fishy, but the other was okay. 

I had the Hong Kong style bass for entree.  I wasn't expecting an authentic piece of fish flying out of a hot wok or anything, but I did hope for something tender and juicy like the name suggests, and there was nothing ""Hong Kong"" about it.  Fish was overdone, and there wasn't much of the umami aroma associated with Hong Kong style steamed fish.  The rice on the side was perhaps better than your average americanized steamed rice, but pretty bad for this price. 

maybe I just didn't order the right thing, since this isn't a Chinese restaurant afterall.  However, the others didn't love their dishes either.  I don't remember much other than they were a duck dish, a pasta dish and a lamb dish.

The service was superb, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was elegant in the dining room. My mom kept commenting on how there were more waiters then customers for a Saturday night, but we did originally get there around 5:45pm and the dining room eventually filled up and was almost full when we left two hours later (we ate leisurely and had coffee with dessert after our entrees).

Before our entrees came out, we were given a plate of olive oil, sea salt, pepper, and butter for some artisan breads that were served by a waiter (whose only job it seemed was to serve bread). The selection was quite diverse with an onion foccacia, an herb & cheese lavash, sourdough, cherry walnut bread, and pretzel bread. I tried one of everything and would have eaten more if I didn't know were were going to get our appetizer and entrees soon.

Speaking of entrees, I ordered the New England Diver Sea Scallops with three giant scallops that were perfectly cooked. It was topped with a mascarpone foam that was pretty to look at and fun on the plate, but had little taste. However, the flavors of the rest of the dish definitely made up for that. My brother had a taste and mentioned that he would have eaten 10 of those scallops instead of his entree. The appetizer we ordered was a special one not on the menu, and I am so happy with our choice. We got persimmon and prosciutto flatbread with fromage blanc... it was heaven. I don't know how they made the crust so light, crisp, and airy, but I would go back just for that.

My brother ordered the Choucroute Garnie Royal that comes with mustard, sauerkraut, blood sausage, regular sausage, chicken sausage, and pork belly. He couldn't stomach the blood sausage (and neither could I) but the rest of the sausages were decent. Edible, but not amazing. My brother wishes he would have tried the duck... I do too because it sounded great on the menu!

My mom ordered the Grilled French Sea Bass Loup de Mer, and it was amazing! The portion was very generous and the grilled onions and artichoke under the fish itself complemented very well with the dish. She loved her dish so much, she didn't even want to try any of our food.

My dad ordered the Chilled Maryland Blue Crab Salad because he was still semi full from an earlier meal. I'm SO glad he was full because he would have ordered chicken or steak and we would have missed out on this yummy dish! Each bite of crab, avocado, and grapefruit was like a party in my mouth. The flavor combo is not one I would have ever put together, but it was on point!

For dessert, we had the chocolate souffle with ice cream. The ice cream was delicious, but the souffle was not my favorite.

Oh, I almost forgot... the best part about the dining experience at Spago was the little things they did to set them apart from other restaurants. First, my glass of water was never half filled, it was always full. Second, they gave us complimentary parsnip soup with truffle oil. Third, around the time the bill came, the waiter produced a mini plate of chocolate petit fours.",dtkZeEeOcgsJTmka9_b7Ig,1,1,4,8Sao26A11JdonDdnGiZFNg

He gave me a ""what do you want ME to do about it "" look.  He was very sarcastic and rude...this kind of service was very unexpected in an upscale place like this. I emailed 2 GM's about this experience the same night and one of them wrote back to me immediately, which I appreciated. Assistant general manager, Brad,seemed like he knew what customer service means in an upscale restaurant.

Food came out late. My husband got his food when the rest of the party was almost done with our food because the server claimed that they found a piece of hair on our food and they had to recook the meal. I thought that this was a sorry excuse for forgetting to put in our order in the first place. Overall, HORRIBLE experience. There are plenty of places to eat. Don't eat here. We sure aren't going back.

The pizza from the table next to us smelled good but I stuck to our plan and  ordered the chopped salad which had so many ingredients in it such as carrots, green beans, celery and the dressing was just perfect. It wasn't under or over dressed (which is hard to find at a restaurant). It was definitely one of the best salads I've ever eaten! My boyfriend ordered the salmon salad and said the salmon was cooked perfectly and the pickled ginger on the side was a nice touch. He really enjoyed my salad more because he said it was more flavorful.

We decided to come here for Father's Day lunch.  I was disappointed to say the least.

The service was shoddy and the food was crap (considering what we paid). 

We started with the Chicken Lollipops and Calamari.  The lollipops were cute, but bland and served with a watered down bleu cheese dressing.  The calamari was not as disappointing, but I have had better.

I ordered the Pancetta-wrapped meatloaf... dry and under-seasoned.
He had the Kobe Burger... greasy, overdone, and extremely crumbly.  I had a bite and half the burger broke off and fell into a greasy pile on the plate.

My daughter's chicken fingers were probably the best tasting item on our table that afternoon... and i should hope so at $15 for a lunch time kid's meal.

Dessert was a disaster.
We ordered the Pineapple abomination; their take on Pineapple Upside-Down Cake a la mode, I suppose.  It was a square of dry, crumbly yellow cake topped with 3 preparations of pineapple, all sitting a top a pile of mint and mystery nut ""pesto"".  The best part was likely the lime-coconut sorbet.

I wish I remembered the servers name so that I could rip him a new one in this forum.  The hostess sat us in a corner (probably due to our 2 1/2 year old? i dunno) where we were ignored/forgotten for maybe ten minutes. After our order was taken we were ignored for the remainder of our meal.  No server stopped to see how everything was or if everything tasted OK.  He didn't even offer us dessert, he just assumed we wanted the check.  It wasn't until the end of the meal that he struck up a conversation, ""Hey, where are you guys visiting from?""  I told him we lived here and my companion cut me off and carried on the conversation knowing some smart-ass comment was bubbling up inside of me.  As soon as the guy found out where we worked he was our best friend! ""OMG! That would be my dream job! Let me take the dessert off! I didnt know you were locals!"" 

Not the type to be patronized I politely declined and we were on our way.

I actually wish I would have eaten here more each time. This past occasion we were debating not going to Spago just because we had eaten here last time and there are so many places we just didn't get to try. However, someone made the brilliant decision that we were going to Spago again and I'm thankful because this was once again my FAVORITE meal in Vegas.
 
To start off I have to mention the awesome bread basket, so delicious, the flat bread, the sweet bread, the sourdough ahh my mouth is watering as I write this. The accompanying sea salt, butter and olive oil is also amazing.

On this trip to Spago we sat ""outside"" and were able to order off of the cafe menu and the dinner menu. 

Last time we ordered the oysters and we remember how amazing they truly were by ordering them again. Spago's oysters are the best and freshest in Las Vegas, if you eat oysters or just want to try them get them here.

This time there were 7 of us so we got to try a lot of menu items. 

There were two orders of the special salad that night which was Caprese Salad with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzerella. It was fantastic. I ordered the Olsen Farm's Baby Arugula Salad, Farmers' Market Pear & Fig, Shaved Fennel, Burrata Cheese, Prosciutto San Daniele, Ice Wine Vinegar and Olive Oil. I had them put the Proscuitto on the side and someone else ate it. The salad was intense. The creamy Burrata accompanied with the fresh fig and pears, so good. Get this if you have a chance. 

I also ordered the Farmer's Market White Corn Soup, Trumpet Royale Mushrooms, Caramelized Cipollini Onions, Fava Beans, Cherry Tomatoes, Arugula and Basil Oil. This was the all-star of the night for everyone who tasted it. It was so fresh and savory I would have licked the bowl if it would have been appropriate.

For Entree's we had 3 orders of the Hand Cut Fettuccini, Wild Oregon Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots, Parmesan-Reggiano. This was a popular dish the last time we ate here so one of us ordered it again and two others joined along. It was as delicious as we remembered.

2 orders of the Caserecci Pasta a la Bolognaise,Braised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, House Made Ricotta Cheese. Both people who ordered this loved it. 

Unagi Glazed Scottish Salmon Salad, Romaine Lettuce, Daikon Radish, Shiso, Avocado, Carrot Rémoulade , Steamed Jasmine Rice, Japanese Vinaigrette. It looked beautiful.

Spago Pancetta-wrapped Meatloaf, Russet Potato Purée, Mushroom Gravy, Port Wine Sauce, Onion Rings. My friend who ordered this jokingly said his was better, which he says about all food items but he thoroughly enjoyed it. 

To top it off we had another birthday here and this time they brought us out an assortment of cookies. We were all completely stuffed but we some how made some room for these cookies. 

Last but not least, for the quality of the food the pricing is on point. There are a ton of place in Vegas that take your hard earned money while you sit back and wonder if it was really worth it. This is not one of them.

Thank you Spago, when I return to Vegas I will visit, more than once this time.",6VnuHqma4FWdda9MIg6G0A,2,1,5,VRNoDHQa_k5WbmRVmAAdvg

First on that night you couldn't beat the prices, we ordered two of the salmon pizzas for the tables, entrees and dessert.  If the prices were always this low I'd give it 5-stars easily!

I didn't see anything which jumped out on the menu so I asked the waiter who recommended the sea bass.  I'm normally not the type of person to order seafood unless I'm at a strictly seafood place but I decided to trust the server.

The sea bass was really good, crispy and cooked to perfection.  I was very satisfied with my decision and it's given me a little more faith to try something new on a menu!  The salmon pizza I could tell was very fresh, underneath was a sort of tarter sauce which I could have done without.  I'm not a huge salmon fan so I'm surprised I ate 2 slices.

For dessert I had the souffle which I think is one of the over the top presentations for a dessert.  I've had this before at the former MGM Grand Detroit location so I knew what to expect, but it was still amazing as always.

2975723,2014-12-07,4,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Came here for lunch last Sunday with a reservation just because it is a smaller location. It was alright but for the pricing, it wasn't anything crazy good. Unless you're coming here for pizza, I'd rather go to Mesa Grill or Cheesecake Factory. Also one thing I really hated, was the fact that it wasn't too busy but everything took FOREVER! A quick lunch ended up being 2 1/2 hours! We would have ordered dessert but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for that.
For appetizer we had the Prime Beef Sliders. The flavor was really delicious and the beef was really tender but oh my goodness, these are the smallest sliders I've had in my life. Their height was the length of my thumb and was as big around as a silver dollar. Also, their baby portion of fries was good but again, the portion was hilarious. I think these were about $16? Not worth it.
My boyfriend had the chicken sausage pizza and sure the portion was great but that's because it's a pizza. The flavor was good, but you could get the same at Settebello or CPK. They also served it with Pasilla peppers on top.
I had the Atlantic Salmon. Salmon was cooked perfectly but their pairing with the curried califlower didn't match in my opinion. Nothing memorable for this dish either and I believe the pricing was about $28.
Honestly, if everything had been about $5 cheaper, they would maybe get 4 stars because nothing was really wrong with anything we ate but everything we tried, we could get somewhere else with better flavor, more reasonable pricing, and it wouldn't have taken 2 1/2 hours. Sorry Spago, this one was a miss for me. I would defintiely recommend Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill for a lunch option at Caesar's instead.",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,7,3,3,hqsX-wT9VCCG46k4mWu9YA

It was served on a bed of rice (jasmine, I believe) with some vegetables on the side. I didn't get any drinks from the bar but someone else got a glass of white wine and they were pleased with it.

I am so mad that it took me this long to eat at a place like Spago, because this was literally one of the best meals I have ever had. 
I use to bartend at Casears, I thought Sapgo was a fine dining, too fancy for my lunch break type of thing! WOW, I was so wrong. You could totally go have lunch in jeans, and not be out of place! 
Two friends and I sat at the bar. We were greeted immediately and offered drinks. Not only offered, but also offered a Vodka sample tasting to see which Vodka we wanted in our drinks. NICE. I went with an extra dirty martini and I was told by the bartender that he hand stuffed the olives that day. As well as hand cut the big ice chunks. No cutting corners here. 
Let me just tell you that this martini was literally the best I ever had. I usually drink Belvedere but with the tasting, I went with Stoli Elite. Between the high quality Vodka, and cheese, I was in heaven!  
Our three dishes included salmon, rigatoni Bolognese, and shrimp scampi. The pasta was fresh. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was a better quality than the average. The shrimp were huge. I would order every single dish again. Not to mention the service was so on point! I love when places educate their staff. They know why they use the ice chunks instead of cubes. They know where the salmon came from. They know the answer to just about any question you may have. Including history of the establishment. 
I can't wait to dine here again. They have now set a standard. I look forward to seeing if they hold the bar this high at all times.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,4,3,5,avhFhMvU3bcQTcAZQ5rreQ

Ambiance was nice.  Verry classy place to have dinner at Ceasar's.  Our group of girls were very unique  for this restaurant because everyone else was older and less Asian.  Our waitress was MIA the entire time.  I saw her once when she took our order and once when we paid the bill.  In between there were many others that served and checked up on us. It also took a VERY long time for our food to come out, which surprises me for a restaurant like this.  

Food was pretty good.  I ordered the duck breast (medium...didn't know you could order it like that) and tried many of the other dishes.  They fill you up on bread, but don't waste your space on any other bread besides the focaccia.

Duck breast-  I really like duck but was not impressed with the duck breast.  It was not bad, but not fantastic.
Filet mignon-  I don't think you can go wrong with steak.  It was pretty good but also just typical tasting.  
Braised beef short rib-  Extremely tender!!! Many of the girls liked this dish the best, but personally I do not like the texture of very soft beef.  If that's your style, then get this!
Lamb chops-  I am not a huge fan of lamb, but surprisingly this was my favorite dish.  The seasoning complemented the lamb very well and the meat itself was not too gamey.  

All in all a really nice dinner.  I would come again for the food but would appreciate the food to come out faster and more attention from our waitress (vs the other waiters/servers) in such a snazzy place.",Ud8tcgnxp0w0qBtXt_DKOg,0,0,3,g_o3bSdvYGHRNwAj_yYAFw

The margherita pizza.... yes, simple item, I know.... is the best I have ever had.

I have compared all pizzas to this, talked about this pizza to anyone who would listen and have dreamed about this pizza many a times.
I am now drooling after visiting the webpage and reading the ingredients over again.

We saved some for the next day and not only was it good as a cold breakfast because we were hung over but because cold or hot it IS THE BEST pizza ever! 

It is not too saucy, too cheesy...well yes, it is very cheesy but its all delicious, contrast cheeses that melt in your mouth making you want to go without water in order to savor the flavor just a bit longer in your mouth.

The next time I go to Vegas I must get my hands on a slice, or two... oh heck, the whole pie to myself and I am not sharing. 


The service was great, we were late for our reservation and I called them to tell them about our idiot cab driver and they simply responded ""we will save your table for you""
Glad they did... there was a show going on so the place was super busy. Server was attentive and friendly.

Even the busboy was friendly and always kept our water glasses full. Everyone was on point here. No lapses in service at all.

As for the food.... man, it was good! Hubby had a BLT burger and he said it was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had a Caprese salad and it was so delicate, with both the slabs of heirloom tomatoes and the small halved cherry tomatoes on the side were at the exact perfect nano-second of ripeness. I'm not sure if they reduced the balsamic and oil or what they did, but the drizzle of dressing was the finest of any Caprese salad I've ever had (and I've had plenty). It was not in the least harsh or acidic; it was faintly sweet and even appeared different, with a greenish hue. It was divine.

The cherry pie was good, but not excellent.  The shell was a little dry, and so were the cherries.  Not enough of that juicy, cherry goodness.

Yes, a penny machine that STOLE my money.  I still wanted a decent meal and stumbled upon Spago, just about 175 yards or so away from that stupid Goldfish game.  I looked at what I could afford on the menu and we decided on pizza.   It was a really decent price and everything else on the menu was so much more expensive.

First of all, the bread we chose from the bread basket being handed to us had foccacia and flat bread so I ate both.   The flat bread was excellent.   I already had high hopes.  Plus the servers were really nice to us too.  

Anyway, I ordered the mushroom pizza with roasted portabellas and some kind of taste that I've never tasted in a pizza before.  It couldn't have been just the parmesan.  These were really thin-crust pizzas which I normally don't get, but this was just melt-in-my-mouth fantastic.

Not over powering on the dressing it has a hint of tart flavor which I find blend well with the salty cheese. I ate half of his salad it was that good. I was hesitant to order Gnocchi with mushrooms and spinach. In the past at another restaurant I recalled their gnocchi was chewy and gummy. But decided to give it a try at Spago was i surprised! It's yummy soft deliciousness. Hubby had pork chops and potatoes, it cooked to perfection tender and flavored really well with the purée pear.  Desserts red velvet cake with cream cheese ice cream topped with granola and fruit orange slice. The cake layered with cream   filling. Red velvet was dense too sweet for my taste.

OMG... I dream of that free range chicken, oh so delectably juicy and wonderful as you chew it in your mouth, with a hint of goat cheese that was carefully tucked under the crispy skin of that oh so yummy poultry meat... Accompanied wonderfully with that dreamy chicken, was potatoes... with it smoothly mashed to melting consistency, and  root veggies all crisped perfectly and not a bland or undercooked bite at all , and the natural jus..the sauce that was so warm and perfect and provided a flavorful blanket for all the above. I have to say it was a heavenly dish....it didn't make me feel weighed down or like I had too much to eat..I smiled every time I took a bite...

Now for dessert...i had the chocolate flour-less cake with pralines..it's a very skinny slice of cake but boy oh boy was it a gigantic awesome burst of flavor in your mouth! It was also very delicious and didn't taste too sweet or wasn't overburdened with sauce or icing. It came with a little scoop of hazlenut ice cream and it was the PERFECT ending to one of the best meals in my life..seriously... 

Oh and to add to my experience, the group I was with had the tasting menu ( I didn't because I had a little too many mojitos the night before at the V bar and the night ended with me bowing to the porcelin god). I tasted a tiny bit from my sister's plate of everything she got and I'll say that everything was awesome...The wait staff was also VERY accommodating  and they did an excellent job.

We also got the complimentary bread but it was so hard I actually cut the roof of my mouth from the crust! The Margharita (drink) I got tasted so nasty I swear it was well and not the kind the menu said they used. I know I was not in the minority about the taste of the food as some of my dinner companions had something they did not like about their plate.

However, this last visit was short of extraordinary. But, still the food was yummy.

We came for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and were seated outside in the patio. Our waitress came over to get our drink orders within 10 minutes. BF had a Riesling and I got the Prosecco. I was feeling bubbly.

The busboy dropped off a basket of bread which had some pretzel style crackers, square onion bread, and some other stuff. The onion bread was my favorite, but unfortunately, they only gave us ONE of those in the entire basket.. WTF.

So, we asked the waitress for more of that bread. She came back 5 minutes later with a basket of bread that had everything BUT the onion bread. Stupid.

Anyway, whatever, moving on.

We got our entrees. I had my usual hand cut fettucine with Wild Oregon Mushrooms, English Peas, Arugula, Glazed Shallots and Parmesan-Reggiano. Delicious as always! Big portion too, took me a while to finish it. 

BF had the PAPPARDELLE PASTA À LA BOLOGNAISE
Braised Beef, Roasted Double Blanched Garlic, Plum Tomatoes, House Made Ricotta Cheese and Italian Parsley. I think he always get this dish too. We must be creatures of habit. He cleaned off his plate in 10 minutes, so yeah, he liked it. 

Our waitress seemed to be missing most of the meal. We had a hard time flagging her down to get a second round of drinks.. I'm not sure why that was. Spago is usually great with service. 

But, it's all good! I got buzzed off 2 glasses of Prosecco. I ain't complainin'. 

Lunch was around $100 before tip. I'll still go back, just hope for more attentive service next time.

3256081,2012-03-04,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Spago by Wolfgang Puck, his signature restaurant in Las Vegas

The decor is modern with warm oranges and red color schemes.  The restaurant is expansive, with a second floor, a bar area and an ""outdoor"" seating area so you can people watch as shoppers walk by.  We were seated on the first floor in a little raised area where we were the first diners of the night to sit there yet still had amazing service.

Wolfgang Puck is known for his amazing modern American cuisine and as a treat for ourselves, we went for the Chef's Tasting Menu.  Officially 6 courses, we ended up with what seemed to be 8 courses.  For $95, you get a lot of food while you could end up paying somewhere in the $30s for an entree.  Chef Eric Klein did not disappoint with small portions of his most popular menu items for tasting with some items that weren't available for order on any menu at Spago, lunch or dinner.   

Bread: As many reviewers have noted, Spago's bread platter is well known for very good reason.  With four choices that night, sourdough, cranberry walnut, flat bread and foccacia, you could not go wrong with any.  Dipping platter:  Olive oil infused with rosemary, salt, pepper and butter.  The bread was very good as advertised, something that I tried to pace myself with knowing that I had the tasting menu to come.

Amuse Bouche: Duo of AMERICAN KOBE BEEF ""SLIDERS"" Brioche Buns, Bread-Butter Pickles, Red Onions, Smoked Gouda, House Made Ketchup, CHILLED MARYLAND BLUE CRAB SALAD Fragrant Herbs, Avocado, Grapefruit Segments, Lemon Vinaigrette and Basil Pistou
-Melt in your mouth Kobe beef, a perfect bite with the pickles providing just enough tang but the Crab Salad was what stole the show.  The Grapefruit and lemon vinaigrette was unbeatable in cutting through the richness of the crab salad.  Amazing bite

First Course: MARGARITA FLAMBE: Mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, Goat Cheese with Garden Tomatoes and Basil
-Crispy and flaky crust with an intense tomato flavor.  the flambe was good, something that didn't stand out too much at the end of the dinner, great contrast between the crust and the flavor of the toppings

Second Course: DUO of Yellowfin Tuna Sashimi: Watercress Salad, Lychee, Chive and Aji Limon and Avocado, Daikon Radish, Scallion and Yuzu-Wasabi
-Served in a perfect ice sculpture, the presentation was dramatic.  Each sashimi bite had incredibly fresh seafood, the tuna being highlighted by the lychee and  by the yuzu, very yummy flavorful punches

Third Course: Soup/Salad: FARMERS' MARKET CAULIFLOWER SOUP
Trumpet Royale Mushrooms, Arugula and Basil Oil OLSEN FARM'S BABY ARUGULA SALAD Farmers' Market Apple, Shaved Fennel, Burrata Cheese, Prosciutto San Daniele, Ice Wine Vinegar and Olive Oil
-The soup was very creamy, had hints of potato but was made with pureed cauliflower, the arugula and basil oil was a great way to cut through the creaminess, very yummy with a great balanced salad.  The apple, fennel and cheese were complimented by the ice wine.  Overall, great course

Fourth Course: Hand Rolled, ricotta Gnocchi with porrcini mushrooms, black truffle butter, cheese foam,
THE BEST COURSE OF THE NIGHT! There is no way to describe the pillowy, fluffy gnocchi, this course is not available anywhere on the menu day or night, it can only be had through the tasting menu.  The heartiness of the mushrooms with the black truffle butter, was insanely delicious, I could eat this dish every day for a long time

Fifth Course: GRILLED FRENCH SEA BASS LOUP DE MER: Artichokes, Baby Carrots, Haricot Vert, Cipollini, Arugula, Fennel Purée, Artichokes Barigoule Broth Au Pistou
-Perfectly cooked fish, flaky with a crispy crust.  The broth was something that could've been drunk without any accompaniment, very tasty and the accompanying vegetables were great for the fish.

Sixth Course: MESQUITE GRILLED PRIME FILET MIGNON: Sweet & Sour Red Onions, Celery, Watercress, Bone Marrow Crushed Fingerling Potatoes and Armagnac Peppercorn Sauce PISTACHIO CRUSTED COLORADO LAMB CHOPS
Cheese on top of the lamb, pickled beets and onions with balsamic reduction
-The lamb was tender, with the peppercorn flavor coming right through and the filet mignon was tender and tasty.  After all the big bold flavors in the past courses, the meat course was a little lacking but still very tasty if I had just had that course.  I was still hooked on that gnocchi.

Palate Cleanser: Blood Orange and Passionfruit Sorbet over blueberries
-Yummy sorbet that had a touch of bitterness that did its job, cleanse your palate after that long meal.  I ate the whole thing, def not just a palate cleanser

Desert: CREPE: Dark Chocolate, hazelnut, creme fraiche with orange glaze
-Great crepe, with just enough body in the crepe to balance the hazelnute and dark chocolate

Overall, great attentive service, great food, was greeted by Eric Klein himself, would do it again in a heartbeat if I had unlimited funds, well worth the money",aR7CwQR6c3QFnLcdWPq71g,2,0,5,WFZu4sIUI9gzoxFisYsBIA

It was deceivingly simple: cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, sesames, cashews, pea shoots, radicchio, chicken...none of the ingredients were out of this world but somehow with the magic that is Wolfgang Puck and his powerhouse of restaurant awesomeness I found myself wanting to lick the bowl clean. Why? Because the chicken wasn't just chicken - it was so perfectly cooked: tender, moist, delicious. The cashews had a delightful crispiness with a spicy seasoning. All the veggies were cut so beautifully so that I could get a forkful of everything all combining with the perfect textures and flavors. And the dressing...oh that dressing....can I bathe in it? Would that be unsanitary? Because honestly, dress me up and down in that ginger vinaigrette and call me dirty. I'll be ok with that. 

Aside from the salad we also shared the lamb chorizo pizza and skirt steak quesadilla. No words. The pizza was beautiful - nice light crust with a slight char on it to give it that smoky flavor. All combined with a tangy goat cheese, sweet sundried tomatoes and...oh dear...here comes another wave of tingling tastebuds....

Suffice to say it was all delicious.If you want to see their current menu:

And yes, as others have said, the breadbasket was yum. My favorite was the cherry/nut bread! We actually asked for a second bread basket with just that bread!

Also - if you can help it - come at lunch! You won't have to wait...We came at lunch, got seated immediately and had the best service.  They knew before I knew that our soda had to get refilled bringing out a fresh glass of soda to replace the dwindling one. 

All in all - yes yes yes!! And side note - for $2 you can go to Tix4Tonight (several locations throughout the strip) to get a discount (something like 10% off your meal). It didn't make a huge dent in our bill (saved us something like $5) but if you're doing dinner or a big lunch then definitely get that.

However, our entrees were quite a letdown. My husband and I both got their filet mignon and have to say that the meat was not flavorful at all. We tried adding salt and pepper, but it did nothing.

The bartenders were great, suggesting different drinks and wine parings for things on the menu.  My husband ordered some saki and a Sapporo and the bartender gave us some tips on different saki's and other Japanese beers.  

We went to our table by the friendly host and were immediately greeted by our server.  He gave us a rundown of the menu and what some of his favorites were.  We decided on doing the tasting menu prepared by the chef, specific for that night.  That was the best idea because we were able to try a bunch of things that were on the menu and a few others that were not.  We were stuffed by the time we got to the 4th course and we still had 2 more to go!  The first course was flat bread with cheese, prosciutto, balsamic vinaigrette, and something sweet (amazing!).  The next course was a sushi plate - one of the pieces was a piece of tuna on a rice cake with some sort of sauce.  Very yummy!!!  Next was pasta - gnocci with a cream, pepper sauce.  BEST GNOCCI I've ever had.  The fish course was a halibut with jasmine rice, a honey flavored sauce, veggies, and huckleberries.  The halibut was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The meat course was duck, which made me nervous, but it was cooked perfect with a DELISHIOUS sauce.  The flat bread pizza, gnocchi, and halibut were by far my favorite courses.  The dessert was TO DIE FOR - homemade cheese cake with grapefruit sorbet and on the other side of the plate was bananas with cream fresh, pistachio nuts, drizzled with Nuttella.

The restaurant itself offers two types of dining experiences: high end and casual.  Upon seating they give you two menus.  One is a casual menu that offers more of a laid back, typical meal, with large portions and less thought.  The other menu is more expensive, with smaller portions, but offering more creative dishes and chef specialties.  We went with the casual menu, but even that is priced at a high end point.  We had a spaghetti dish with mushroom and a chicken and mashed potato dish.  I can't complain about either.  Both were delicious (maybe not worth the price point) and filling.

Spago's is a great place to have a date with that special someone or spend some quality time with a good friend. The cuisine is expertly prepared and the staff could not be more accommodating. We both enjoyed the Lobster salad as our first course. It was delicious, small, beautifully prepared. Remember, you aren't supposed to get full on the first course. We continued our agreeable appetite by both indulging in the Saffron Risotto for our second course, which was our first experience tasting Risotto. It was very well prepared and tasty. She had the filet for her third course and I had the lamb for my third course. We were both very well pleased with our choices. My wife was saving room for desert, so I got to a decent amount of her filet, so I know it was delicious. My lamb was excellent and cooked exactly to my liking. We shared an order of crab legs, which as you know are hard to beat with some well prepared beef. We shared a slice of cheese cake for desert and left very full and even more satisfied. 

The atmosphere at Spago's is very relaxed. It is not stuffy and people varied immensely in their attire. Some were very casual while others dressed for the occasion. If you get to Vegas be sure to have a special evening set aside for Spago's.",tyYz_5r6-VJEd1SHdvnK2w,0,0,4,YFJrS4GUgQdZsgE1vUYg3Q

Was walking around the Caesars Palace Forum shops and saw Spago - looked nice and you can have a seat and watch people walk by so we decided to have lunch here off the Spago Cafe menu.

Service was excellent and friendly. Our waiter came by frequently to make sure we were okay and refill our drinks without asking. The breads were very good, especially the flatbread which I liked a lot. 

The shirmp bisque was fantastic and so tasty. Just a perfect balance of flavor and creaminess. On the other hand the chilled tomato gazpacho with avocado cream just tasted like a big soup bowl of lightly flavored salsa with finely chopped tomatoes. Granted I am not a tomato gazpacho expert but I certainly could not imagine anyone finding this delicious. My Chinese chicken salad was fresh and reasonably tasty but not memorable. I would guess Chinese chicken salad is not their signature dish so I'd be willing to come back and try something else next time.

Bottom line: for great service, atmosphere, people watching in the Caesar shops area, this can be a great place. Food is potentially good but inconsistent across dishes (but do try the shrimp bisque!).",6mMk9hO_RAbdGMEGeg3oWQ,1,0,4,OHyDXU1ar5cAghgd9G4tJg

I would rather go to an Olive Garden than have to sit through that service and food at Spago again. Le Cirque wins hands down.

We got more attention from our busser than our waiter. We saw the couple next to us send back not one, but two of their dishes (one of them was a flattened soufflé).  For us, firstly, we were supposed to have bread come around with butter and the waiter said he would send someone shortly. They ended up not coming at all. We finally calling the bread person over when we spotted him giving bread to another table. Secondly my boyfriends pasta was luke warm. It was a carbonara which traditionally is topped with pepper but there was no pepper server or pepper shake at all on the tables. Creamy pastas are usually piping hot but this one was almost on the verge of cold. Because of the pepper thing I had to ask our waiter for pepper and he said he would be right back.. never came back. So we asked our busser for one. He also said he would get it.. never came back!!

Meh.

Thing is, when I am out of my San Francisco element, my obsession with trying something new, the latest and greatest, just....disappears. I'm out of my routine (i.e. gym), so I want to keep things simple. Which usually means a sandwich. If it's not in SF, I don't really care.

But I didn't have much choice. It was a business lunch, and everyone else was dying to go. Can't say much about the space other than it was relatively empty and cavernous, but I did enjoy my meal. The chopped veggie salad was a healthy eaters dream: carrots, celery, corn, green beans, and tomatos. Hold the cheese, and add the super expensive ($10) chicken. Even without dressing, there seemed to be some oil or something coating the veggies. Didn't need that, but it was minimal.

Service was flawless and intuitive. For example, suggesting to a co-worker steamed veggies when he didn't want potatoes. Nicely done. And don't miss the flatbread they bring out, or at least a piece.

Not bad, kind of a stale environment, but dinner might have a better energy. And definitely go when you are not paying. As much as I liked my salad, were I paying $25 for it, not sure I'd be giving three stars.",WecuAsHBDZGj7Z6_sJcQAw,3,3,3,pDSwVQwVSfTS4t0qPk24ZA

There are two different menu options: casual and fine dining. Casual dining is ""outside"" seating; whereas, fine dining is inside the restaurant. My friend and I chose the casual menu and were seated outside of the restaurant where we had a view of the shops, drunken tourists with yard longs, and the faux sky ceiling above us -- typical Vegas scenery. Dining within the outside area can get a little noisy, but not to the point where you can't carry on a conversation.

We ordered an appetizer and dessert to split and entrees of our own. 

Appetizer - Maryland Crab Cakes: We received two crab cakes made from fresh crab meat and paired with heirloom tomatoes. I never thought crab meat and tomatoes together would taste good, but they do in this case. 

Entree - Hand Cut Fettuccini: This was delectable. You really can't go wrong with freshly made pasta, arugula, and wild mushrooms. Shrimp and chicken can also be added, but for an additional cost (go for the add-on!).

Valrhona Chocolate Cremeux: A small, rich and decadent block of chocolate garnished with raspberries and edible gold-colored dust. A good dessert to finish off dinner.

Tea: I don't remember the name of the tea that I ordered, other than it was Japanese and its description mentioned ""fresh cut grass"" and ""ocean mist."" It sounded intriguing, but it tastes and smells like ordinary green tea. *womp womp*

Overall: The ambiance is more casual than my first Spago dining experience, but the food is just as superb and memorable (except for that tea..).",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,7,6,4,BQHGyKdTA6rwcIzoMiFCzA

One thing that I loved was the bread service. They offer soft butter topped with sea salt to accompany the various breads. That was so good. I liked the cherry walnut bread best.

Took my gf here for our 1 year anniversary dinner.  Was seated promptly, our server was great, he made sure everything was okay. Got the lobster salad, clean and crisp. My miso glazed halibut was SO good, fish was tender, there was this rice square thing I cant quite understand but with the fish it made the texture of everything go really well. When our creme brule dessert came out it said happy anniversary on it with a sparkler in it. I had made reservations on through the website and left a little note saying that it was going to be our anniversary, and it was great that the staff actually took the time to make us feel very welcomed.

I ordered a glass of Gruner Veltliner and the waiter looked at me like I was speaking Chinese.  I had to point the wine out to him on the menu.  My wife and daughter got their sodas and the waiter said the wine was coming right out.  He totally forgot about it and I had to remind him about it 15 minutes later.

The food is very mediocre.  I had the Caserecci pasta a bolognaise with braised beef and house made ricotta cheese and it reminded me of Chef Boyardee.  It was mushy and the sauce had the same taste as the canned stuff.  I can't believe Wolfgang allows such poor service and food some from one of his restaurants.

3648303,2015-10-02,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Spago was a dream.  A very happy dream that will have me leaving Vegas with very fond memories.   It was our last night in Vegas and we wanted to try one of the very good restaurants since we hadn't spent much money at all on food that week (the convention provided most of what we needed).  So we went for the full Spago Experience.  (Kids, don't try this at home).

So let me start with the food.   Every morsel of food that entered my mouth was stunning.  Nothing lacked seasoning.  Everything was exciting and brilliant in flavor.   We obediently listened to our lovely waitress and went with their ""1/2/3"" concept - the idea being that you choose one offering from each of the 3 sections on the menu - the first being a very small plate, the 2nd slightly larger  and the 3rd - the entree.    I chose:  1. Prime Beef Tartare w/
Capers, Quail Egg, Dijon Aioli, Horseradish,  2. Raviolo w/ House Made Ricotta, Organic Egg, Hazelnut-Brown Butter ,  3. Pan Seared Sonoma Duck Breast w/ Semolina Fondue, Breakfast Radish, Heirloom Carrots, Maitake Mushrooms, Honey Gastrique.  We also ordered a bottle of Sangiovese from Spago's excellent wine list.  One of those wine lists that simply does not have a bad choice on it.  

Beef Tartare - Total umami bomb.  Perfectly seasoned.  Very fresh.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of it and left the place happy.  Was served with paper thin slices of their excellent house-made baguette, lightly toasted.  This dish was an amazing start. 
Bread - They brought bread to the table and asked which of the 5 types of house-made bread we'd like.  I couldn't decide, so he gave me two (and even more later, argh!)  in the end, between my colleague and I  - we were able to split and taste all the breads they had to offer.  There was a black wheat bread with cranberries, their excellent baguette, an olive/rosemary dinner roll, some kind of lightly cheesed focacia...and the last, I fail to recall.  But wow.  When he came back later and asked if we wanted more (with a conspiratorial wink), neither of us could refused even thought we knew it would result in our being overstuffed when we left the place (it did!).
Raviolo - So simple, so perfectly executed, so warm.....one big perfect pillow of house made pasta filled with ricotta and a gorgeous , unbroken (bright orange!) egg yolk that burst when you cut into the raviolo and ran all over the plate.  Then add that simple hazelnut beurre noisette...I'll be dreaming of this dish for weeks to come.
Duck - Perfectly seared. Medium rare as requested.  Gorgeous vegetables and that gastrique - made with honey and plum wedges - was just right.   I could have laid right down on the floor of Spago at that moment, slept a painless sleep with marvelous dreams - but dessert awaited...
The coffee was rich and robust.   The apple crisp with house made vanilla bean ice cream was warm, with marvelous granola-like crunchy bits.  Just enough to tip me over the edge and realize that I had, indeed, over-indulged with no regrets.  And after we requested the check - another small plate was delivered with a pair of truffles for each of us.  Marvelous.  And yes, we ate them.

The Service was what I had always striven for, in my personal pursuits as a waiter back in the day.  Friendly, warm, helpful, elegant (but never stuffy) and with an almost undetectable emphasis on selling.  You never felt pressured, never felt uncomfortable.  You always felt well attended to and special.  We were visited by the Maitre De on at least 4 occasions and he was charming, helpful (to both us and the wait staff, who was very busy that night) and very accommodating.  He opened and served our wine with the polish of a seasoned sommelier and made it clear that he was there for us for the long haul.  Whatever we needed, we need only ask.   Our head waitress treated us like family - she was like that favorite cousin that you don't get to see often enough - friendly, fun, smart, articulate and engaging.  She always spent just enough time at the table and had perfect command of the menu and specials.  We literally missed her when she left.   The rest of the staff - from the guy who served the bread and replaced your sliverware to the guy pouring water and kitchen waiters delivering the food - everyone did so with perfect polish, friendly smiles and a willingness to help further as needed.   This sfaff SPARKLED!    Yes, I'm gushing, but they were *that* good.  Even the chef stopped by.

So - in the end, I have no complaints.   No regrets whatsoever.   But I would like to point out that the price range in yelp is by no means accurate.   Granted, we did get a bottle of wine ($40) and dessert ($12-ish).  But if you go with the Spago 1/2/3 concept (and you should!), you're already far beyond the listed $31-60 price range.   If you chose the 3 least expensive items in each section, you'll be paying approximately $60 each on food alone.  Yelp needs to update.  Still - no regrets.  :)  Well worth the $$$$ spent.",D3fYmuQwtzOXz1usTkyQTg,0,0,5,nbdPo5CZ9TMVeIp5jAnJpQ
3649398,2012-08-02,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Anyone who rates this Spago less than 5 Stars clearly did not have the tasting menu.  We made reservations early for a Thursday night and asked the maitre d if they could do a tasting menu for a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian at the same time.  He laughed and said it wouldn't be a problem if the chef was in a good mood.

When we arrived, I asked our server if the chef was in a good mood and he responded ""Yes, and we love vegetarians!""  In fact, he told me that they can accomodate people of all allergies, sensitivities and preferences including vegan or gluten free.

The reason Stefan D did not get a written tasting menu is because the chef makes it up as he goes along (which we learned from the chef two years ago when we came to the same location for the tasting menu and he came out to visit with us toward the end of our meal).  Although each course is not a great deal of food, you will be absolutely stuffed by the end.  The most spectacular part of the meal for me was these enormous ice teardrops that were hollow and contained two spoons of different delicious dishes.  (My nonvegetarian husband asked me three times to tell him what the house made lychee beads were he loved them so much).

As expected, most of the dishes for me were vegetarian versions of the meat dishes - I got a portobello burger instead of Kobe beef, but I'm not a big fan of portobello normally and I LOVED it.

The service was also excellent.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this Spago.  It was an experience you don't want to miss.  One word of caution, if you get the wine pairings with the tasting menu, make sure you are not driving afterwards.",Rbc6uS59yQh8wS_dLEHuxg,0,0,5,qA_XGnCEQlyAQSqkhlsDzw

SPOTLESS. 
We were seated inside. It was quiet, clean, cozy; everything i wanted that night. Somewhere to enjoy a good meal and have a long chat, away from the rush. 
Service: our server was the best, and probably the best server I have ever had. At first i thought he was a little too friendly, but soon my opinion changed. He kept trying to establish a conversation with us and although i appreciate the interest and the will to be nice, my ideal meal is not chatting with the server. Oh was i mistaken. That was only right at the beginning; once he had loaded with helpful info about the dishes he gave us our time. He was very knowledgeable and his answers were not - oh yes, thats great-. He knew how the food was cooked, the ingredients, their texture, flavors... everything.(and he knew the right words too). As well, the rest of the staff was 5/5. Everyone willing to make the evening just perfect. 
Food: nothing was less than a 5. The saffron risotto came out sizzling hot. The aroma was strong, crab meat was juicy and fresh; the lemon butter had the perfect citrusy/richness ratio; neat presentation; last but not least: the risotto had that perfect ""onda""  italians aim for when cooking it. 
The asian salmon was bigger than i anticipated; i ended up taking some home. Flaky, fresh, smooth and very very flavorful. One of the best i have had. It was accompanied by jasmine rice( rice that was covered with the same sauce used on the salmon). 
My bf asked for the braised short ribs. Our server told us they would fall apart from looking at them long enough and he was right. The were so tender. We were in vegas for 5 days; we ate at different celebrity chefs' restaurants ( gordon Ramsay, Wolfgang puck, todd english, julian Serrano among others) and that was my bf's favorite dish. Wolfgang puck got his heart and his wallet lol. The ribs came with roasted root veggies but these were not your typical ones; the spices and herbs were very special. 
For dessert we went with the pineapple soufflé;  everything you want in a soufflé.  We could smell it whilst it was arriving to our table. Airy, strong pineapple flavor and accompanied by a rich brown sugar ice cream.
Listen, if you are in Vegas, please give this place a try you wont regret it. 
I almost forgot, the bread they bring to the table at the beginning was also delicious and if you ask them for some olive oil then even better. When i saw how green it was i knew it would be good. Very fruity olive oil; i was told it is sold in some stores( Wolfgang puck olive oil id think) so i'll be buying it if i see it at home. 
Last day in vegas I thought of going back to Spago but my bf and I decided we should dine at Bellagio to enjoy the fountains and try a new place hence,we did
so. I ended up regretting it ( our hundredths $$$ did not deliver 
 as expected that time)  ; if it had been earlier i think id have gone to Spago even after our dinner and order some  food to go(almost). 
Without a doubt a place we will be back at when we visit Vegas again.

Spago is where Wolfgang puck, and his second wife Barbara Lazaroff, started their amazing food Dynasty. He now has some 20-30 restaurants 

And while it is but a mere shadow of it's past grandeur Spago still serves very good food.

Spago is a great place for a group of diners that have  diverse tastes (vegetarians, kids,....picky eaters).

We ordered the following:

Margherita: fresh mozzarella, san marzano tomatoes, basil

Roasted Mushroom: sweet garlic, provolone cheese, cipollini onions, taleggio.

Fantastic crust, exceptional toppings, and perfect bake. Pizzas are still absolutely stunning....GET IT!

Caesar Salad: parmesan, ciabatta croutons, white anchovy. It is a small and disappointing salad...especially for the price. PASS

Maryland Crab Cakes: basil aioli, tomato relish, local petite greens. Very small portion for the price but the flavor is fantastic. If you got the coin GO  FOR IT!!

Rigatoni: housemade bolognese sauce, ricotta, parsley. In a word Stunning. The pasta is perfectly aldente, the sauce incredibly flavorful, the ricotta is unlike anything I have had before! GET THIS!

My Niece had the Angel hair with butter and the pasta was fantastic...basic but all ingredients were wonderful!

We also had several desserts:

Valrhona Chocolate Soufflé chocolate sauce, caramel ice cream. Light and fluffy Souffle with great accompanying condiments. GET IT!

Seasonal Cookie Plate. In a word Underwhelming....PASS

Banana Caramel chocolate lava cake, banana coulis, salted caramel ice cream: Beautiful to look at and great to eat....small portion but every bite was packed with explosions of flavor. GET IT

Service is pleasant but scattered (somewhat unprofessional) : We had to ask for utensils and plates several times. The timing of service was awkward and plates were stacked on the table..not very appealing.

Great wine list.

I must point out that Spago will be moving to the Belagio in less than a year.  Moving from a 20,000 square foot space to a smaller 12,000 foot place.

I also like how the food is something you'd get at an upscale restaurant (hello hand made fresh pasta) but since you're kinda sitting off to the side of a mall like area, it doesn't feel like a stuffy and snotty high end place.  That's a win win for me.  The hubby got the pepperoni pizza while I got the spaghetti with fresh marinara sauce.  Oh, we also got the crab cakes for any appetizer.  The grab cakes were amazing.  Definitely the best we've ever had, ever!  The crab meat was extremely fresh and who would've thought to put a sprig of celery leaf on top.  Seriously, that made all the difference in the world.  Must find recipe to try at home!  The pizza was amazing as well and might I add, quite large.  The pasta was just okay in my opinion.  The fresh pasta is a very nice touch but it just doesn't quite have the texture that I love so much from the dried pasta.  It actually reminded me a lot of chinese noodles which is probably why it threw me off a bit swimming in marinara sauce.  Now the sauce was incredible.  I would drink that straight out of a cup.

I ended up deserting my pizza to eat half of his entree. The chicken was so moist and paired well with the roasted potatoes. I highly recommend this entree. I ordered the Chicken Sausage Pizza.

We were greeted by GeoffF (with 3 f's!), service was prompt and personable. Geoff was able to come and go just at the rights times. Commented on his personal experiences and was super funny. Food was a bit slow to come out but we didn't mind since the food was super amazing. 

They started us off with a basket of bread. There were some Parmesan crisps and a variety of other cuts from different loafs. 

We ordered the octopus and the tuna tartare, I honestly can't believe how amazing both these dishes were. Portions were a bit tiny but all 5 of us girls were able to get a bite of everything on the plate. 

I ordered the filet mignon (rare), the meat was sooo tender. I wish there was a bit more bearanaise but the steal was seasoned so well that it really didn't need much. The potato was also seasoned very well. Obsessed with how aromatic everything was. The spinach was perfect, no extra oil/water. Again, you guessed it. Seasoned to perfection. 

Grabbed some dessert thereafter; Panacotta and the chocolate sphere. The Panacotta was great. Lots of textures. Some crunch, crisp and creaminess. Rhubarb is my favourite so this was def my top thus far. The chocolate sphere was decadent but not sweet at all. Caramel ice cream and dark chocolate to pair. Too much chocolate for me. Geoff did warn us it a bit small but we went for it anyways. 

Mentioned to Geoff we had two birthdays and they were able to get us two creme brulees. Such a sweet and awesome gesture. We would definitely be coming back. Casual but fine dining experience.

We're starving from a long day of work and walking the strip when we happen to yelp this place last minute. It had wonderful reviews and we were close by, so we shot on over. We noticed it was semi late and asked one of the men resetting a table if they were closed and he let us know that they were open and hour longer. No big deal since we're the ""get in and get out"" type. We then make our way to the hostess we ask to be seated. This woman, with short black hair, gives us the up and down look and explains that they will not take us due to some last minute seating policy arrangement. The entire back room was empty and ready for customers. She just thought we weren't dressed well enough for the establishment. I have never had such judgement passed on me. I mean I can't eat at your fancy place because of what I look like. Talk about shallow. I understand there are dresscodes for such things but mind you were weren't wearing anything horrific. I was wearing a floor length vintage gown and my guy some slacks and button down. Surely good enough to spend money right? 

Anyway, I was abhorred with their customer service and I made it a point to yelp them when I had the time.

3758548,2015-01-26,6,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Let's go back to 2007.  I just got out of finishing school and I wasn't really much a foodie then and yelp wasn't even on my mind.  Well that was also the last time I visited Spago.  It was for lunch on their ""outdoor"" patio cafe.  To me, at the time, that was one of the most lavish lunches I ever had but it didn't really WOW me.  I always thought I'd always go back to visit Spago, but I'm almost surprised that it took me 7 years to finally go back.

It was just my luck that Spago was celebrating their 22nd anniversary the week when I was visiting Vegas (http://bit.ly/1z636WC).  For the occasion, they were offering the same original dining room menu with same pricing when first opened (http://bit.ly/1v1CW0P).  I knew I was in for something special since I've never dined inside the main dining room before.

I decided on starting with their Chopped Vegetable Salad, the famous Smoked Salmon Pizza (sans Caviar) for my appetizer, and Wolfgang's Beef Goulash for my Main Course.

Chopped Vegetable Salad --  http://bit.ly/1v1D8x4
w/ Balsamic Vinaigrette and Parmesan
This was a good salad to start with.  Well plated, and had a lot of different textures and flavor.  

Smoked Salmon Pizza --  http://bit.ly/1z6t4Ju
w/ Dill Creme Fraiche & Chives
I know this is supposed to be their signature pizza, but to me it was just one oversized lox bagel.  Maybe it would've been more better with the caviar which could be added for $10 more.  it was still good, but I should've listened to my server as she advised that this was really meant as shared plate and not for one.  I was already getting full after eating half the pizza, plus I still had my Beef Goulash on the way.  I had the other half boxed up and luckily the nice couple sitting next to me were fans of the pizza, so I gave it to them to take home and enjoy.

Wolfgang's Beef Goulash --  http://bit.ly/1z6t9wS
w/ Sauteed Spatzle, Parsley, Marjoram, Creme Fraiche
OMFGYUM!  This Beef Goulash was so good!!  I'm so glad I didn't finish that pizza because I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  The Beef was so tender that you really didn't need knife to cut into it.  It just broke off like butter with my fork  And it was packed with flavor!  I would definitely come back to have this again if they bring it back on their menu.

After all that, I was really too full for dessert.  No matter though, overall it was a very solid dining experience.  And with the retro pricing, it was a great deal!  It definitely feels like I've come full circle with Spago, now that I got to experience the dining room side to realize what the big fuss was that I missed back in 2007.  I will definitely come back and a lot sooner than 7 years.",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,7,8,4,AdxgpOvwq3gd6HAyjFa-pw

-Crispy Calamari with their Garlic dipping sauce

PRETTY GOOD: Wood fired Kobe beef burger

OK: Organic Oven Roasted Chicken 
-Their Fries

Details: I'm a big bread fan, I really appreciate it when they have good breadbaskets. It also came w. a mini trio of sea salt, butter, and olive oil on a cute tray separated into divisions. 

The calamari was AMAZING. We order calamari at almost every restaurant we go to, and it was definitely to die for. I loved the crispiness and freshness of the calamari, and the garlic dipping sauce that it came with.  

Entrees wise, I ordered the organic oven roasted chicken and the wood fired kobe beef burger. The chicken was a little bit on the dry side. I've had better at my university which is surprising. The kobe beef burger was good but the bun was a bit too much. The fries were also mediocre. 

Service - our waiter was great. I tried ordering the duck that everybody on yelp raved about but He informed me that not only was it only really offered at dinner, but  he also said that in the future I could call in and order it before I arrived for lunch and they'd have it ready for me. ""Anything you want, we can do for you."" he repeated twice and I really do believe that! Really really great service.

Sit outside so you can people watch while you eat. Lunch time is usually filled with a few business men, not too much tourists, so take advantage of lunch time. We were seated also right on the spot even though we didn't have reservations. 

Highly recommended for calamari and hopefully in the future I'll be able to try the duck as well.

When we arrived (wife and myself), we noticed 2 seats at the bar close to the kitchen, being a chef, restaurant owner, and just all around foodie, I opted for the bar and view of the kitchen. Bartender asked if we were having dinner and I said yes, we got a couple of drinks, and after what seemed like a tad too long we were finally asked about our food order, only after reading other reviews on this place do I now realize that "" the awesome bread basket"" was never offered to us. So we settle in and wait, sipping our drinks and munching on nothing, oblivious to the availability of ""awesome bread"" but at this point we are still happily anticipating the tasty food that is about to come from the chef that says something like ""more chef and less celebrity"" about his operation. Well, out come the oysters, their nice and the ginger rhubarb mignonette sauce is flavorful. Now on to the baby arugula salad, it's some really wilted greens on this slimy lump of tasteless goo called burrata cheese and on top of the goo lump is a lonely slice of prosciutto made inedible by the pile of overdressed ""salad"" placed on top of it. Yech
I'm still not unhappy though, because my pizza is coming next, yum Wolfgang Puck pizza! I ordered the pepperoni and asked for anchovies on it too. Well, too much cheese and too much pepperoni and not enough time in the oven, along with being placed on a glass plate with no tissue underneath make for a very limp soggy pizza, then to top it off, the anchovies they used were the marinated white variety, delicious for eating as antipasti, but have NO place on a pizza. So now I'm fairly well disappointed and decide against trying anything else on the menu, oh did I mention that none of the dirty dishes were ever removed from the bar, we had to slide em out of the way to make room. I ask for the check and for some reason I looked it over a bit more than usual and notice a misc food charge of 5.00 and realize that's what they wanted for adding maybe 2 fillets of the wrong kind of anchovy to my pizza, keep in mind the whole pizza was 16.00, so this charge of almost 35 percent of the whole pie seems excessive. Now I'm kinda pissed, and I'm not a cheap POS, it just seems wrong so I ask for the manager and explain my concern, I can tell by the way he's looking and reacting to me that he could care less and told him so, all the while getting the ""knee"" from my wife, now it starts getting ugly, I can feel people looking at me causing a scene, and I'm trying to get the manager to just take off the anchovy and add the beer that was mistakenly left off the check which would actually increase my tab by 3.00. Now the manager says he won't accept any money, and this makes me even more angry because I wasn't looking for a damn discount or a comp. So wife's foot is jabbing me harder now and I'm getting really pissed, because now I look like that cheap POS trying to get something for nothing, all I can do is walk out with my tail between my legs as a cheap POS that DID get something for nothing and embarrassed as hell. Lesson learned from this, quit trying "" celebrity chef restaurants"" and so help me I will NEVER make a comment to an owner or manager, I just won't patronize their establishment again.

Regardless, on to the food. Started off with a glass of Cab - wish I could remember which one, and the beet salad. the salad was good (see pic), but definitley not as good as some I've had.

let me explain. this was our first stop. i had lack of sleep. we had a heck of a time finding this place bc we kept going around in circles. and i wanted something greasy, meaty, but familiar, but not TOO pricey. hence, the italian sausage pizza. 

mind you, it wasn't what i expected. There were circles of italian sausage strewn over the pizza and it looked like slightly thicker and less red versions of pepperoni. Taste: nothing special. plenty greasy though. 

The person next to me got the kobe burger. and proceeded to demolish it with sounds of delight and words of joy. And thats when the regret poured in. 

But enough about my regrets. The oysters looked delicious. (3 for $10, 6 for $20) and the Thai salad my friend got was fresh, crisp, and light. My friend swore by the 'chicken wing lolipops""...which i thought were just good, but pretty similar to just regular chicken wings.

All in all, it was a great first stop because i love the Forum Shops and walking around.  the interior was very pretty. And the assortment of breads they give you at the beginning was superb!

The smoked salmon pizza was the perfect breakfast/lunch combo. Absolutely delicious pizza with fresh smoked salmon, caviar and creme fraiche.

We had been walking through the Forum Shops for most of the afternoon and by the time we got to the end, we were somewhat hungry and I think it was either here or Trevi. We chose this place I guess because at least we knew of Wolfgang Puck's other restaurant in LA. 

The restaurant is kind of divided into two dining areas, with the patio serving cafe style food and with the main dining room serving more fine dining cuisine. Both areas are nice, but I think I prefer the cafe because it's kind of like sitting outdoors because of the changing sky colors outside. Upstairs they have huge plasma televisions and more dining space that goes unused. The coolest thing was that in the men's bathroom they have these padded urinals with splash guard. If you're a guy, you know that sometimes when you pee, you get splash (come on, we've all had that happen because of the damn porcelain). Well this anti-splash guard absorbs all the droplets of urine, and I've never seen that before so that was cool (see how fancy Spago can be?) 

Anyway, their bread is pretty good. They have three different kinds: this Parmesan bread, olive bread and this flat cracker bread. It comes with cream goat cheese spread (but the goat cheese isn't very strong at all so it was quite good). We started off with an appetizer of Skirt Steak Quesadilla with Sour Cream, Guacamole, and Pico de Gallo. The waitress said we would never taste anything like this in a quesadilla and she was right. It was probably the best quesadilla I've ever had because the skirt steak was just like eating buttery steak. But after that, everything else was just average. I had a chicken sandwich on walnut bread and also tried some of the duck from the dinner menu and some type of pasta. Anyway, everything tasted overpriced.

My husband and I visited Las Vegas last month and had been meaning to give Spago a try.  We stopped in for drinks and appetizers and we were not disappointed!
The service is TOP NOTCH!!!  From the hostess, to the waiters, to the busboy, and the manager.  Everyone was very attentive to all of our needs.  I love when a waiter or waitress anticipates your needs.  Water is low, appetizer is close to done, beer is almost gone... at Spago, they are on it!  Our water was never low, one appetizers was brought as another was finishing up, and our beer didn't get below half before someone asked if we need another.
A delicious variety bread basket was brought to our table prior to our appetizers coming out.  A dish with olive oil, butter, and sea salt accompanied the bread.
We ordered the Kobe sliders and the crab cakes as appetizers.  Oh my gosh, really!?!  They were so delicious!!!  The beef sliders came on the cutest tiny buns.  The flavor was robust and savory.  The sliders were served with a delicious aioli and some micro greens.  Perfection. 
The crab cakes were AMAZING!!!!  The filler of the crab cake was... well, crab.  A thick, juicy succulent crab cake adorned with a delicious lemon aioli.  Simple and delicious!  A MUST try!!

Signature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad
I never would have ordered this but it was delicious.

House Smoked Sturgeon, Crisp Potato Galette, Horseradish Cream - $12
It was like a spicy latke with fish on top.  Really good.


""Chinois Style"" Colorado Lamb Chops, Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette, Sweet & Sour Eggplant - $33
Tender and delicious even without the sauce.  Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!

Cantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20
Huge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share.  Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.

The hostess offered us the option of sitting in the cafe or dining area with one set of menus, so I didn't think they were any different. But perhaps I did make the wrong decision by saying ""cafe."" (It was completely full while the dining area had not a single soul...I decided to follow the crowd on this one.)

I had to ask for the bread basket everyone talks about (they now say it's only given upon request) and it didn't even come with the olive oil.

We ordered a mushroom pizza and a pasta dish which were overpriced and mediocre at best in flavor. Everyone around me had ordered a pizza, but no one dared finish the crust. Just like I like the buns on my burger more than the patty, I think a pizza is best when the dough is great...this was inedible. I'm sad that I made my plate look disgusting with a whole bunch of crust pieces...how un-elegant of me at this supposed elegant restaurant.

We ordered a salad with pomegranates that was quite delish, the only thing memorable. But c'mon, it's a salad. How can that be messed up?

This salad was actually the reason we decided to dine at Spago. My mom recalled how much she savored this dish during her previous trip to Vegas several years ago, and she wanted the rest of us to taste it too. It did not disappoint!

Despite the expensive price, the amount of salmon on this pizza was very generous. It was my favorite order of the afternoon.

Let me preface this review with a positive statement. Spago's server assistants are top notch. Ok, on to the rest. 

Wish I could keep my review at around 5 stars, but here's the thing:
1. The margherita pizza that my lady friends ordered didn't come with any basil! For some reason, I totally tuned out what they were eating, until I took a bite of the last piece of their pizza. Yes, to a server, this sounds like a typical, ""We ate the whole thing, but didn't notice until the last piece"" - rip-the-waiter-off scenario. But sadly, IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT WAY. When I brought it up to our server Tony, and told him that the ladies had been too nice to bring it up, he gave me the ""you're trying to rip us off punk"" look, and said, I'll bring it up with the manager. When the bill came, nothing had happened, no apologies, nothing. We paid for a bland cheese pizza with tomatoes on it! Hey Tony, next time, just err on the side of trust and take off the damn pizza from the check that my friends had to endure...bless their hearts. As a server at at a fine dining restaurant, YOU are responsible for making sure every ingredient is on the dish BEFORE it hits the table. I'm sure T is a great guy, but management, I don't want him as my server next time. Thank you. :) (I'm still trying to forgive myself for choosing to pay for it...)

2. The last time I had the Pancetta Wrapped Meat Loaf, it had more beef and less of whatever they put in it this time. This time it was essentially a Sausage Loaf. The gravy and sauces were a bit off this time. I think the gravy turned out to be more of a watered down version of salsa verde, and the port wine sauce kind of got lost in the mix. The redeeming value of the dish? The potato/sweet potato puree and spinach. SOOOOOO good. 

3. The crispy calamari was just that. Crispy breading and tasty rings of squid. But all of us agreed that the marinated cucumbers and hearts of palm with coriander vinaigrette was the highlight of the dish. 

In the end, my recommendation is sit at the bar, your service will be phenomenal. 

PS: Is it not a requirement in Vegas anymore that servers have to have a nametag? I had to specifically ask Tony his name when he came to the table. No nametag...",RJrGgtBXkpX2oEHM4hSqXg,1,1,3,ecPNOwBCBl6Ss9q0-dpRyQ

No, we did not, but we did not mind sitting at the bar. Big mistake! One bartender to take care of the entire bar-- and everyone at the bar was ordering drinks and food! 

Our bartender did the best he could, but I feel like this is poor business practice (especially for a restaurant of this caliber) and leaves a negative impression on guests. My husband ordered a simple glass of Chianti--- definitely not a complicated drink order. His glass of wine did not arrive until after we finished our salad, right before our dinner came out. If I'm going to drop a couple hundred bucks on dinner, the service better be top notch! Sadly, we probably won't be back.",OH93UQIpOSHdYH86UEflhw,4,0,2,_EKvcQqYU92WlKQScxwN-g

It was a bomb--note, not the bomb, but a bomb. The ambiance is weird--it's in the Forum shops and the front opens to a patio to the shops. So, as you go in, you feel like you are going into any mall restaurant anywhere in America. As you go back into the restaurant, you never lose that mall feel.

The food did not save it. While the amuse was good (a taste of tomato soup), it then took 40 minutes for my chicken to come out. The waiter made various excuses, but since there was no note on the menu saying the chicken takes forever, I am guessing there was some mistake made in the kitchen or by the expediter. When it did come out, it was undercooked--and I mean the kind of undercooked that is plainly visible under dark dinner lighting. So, Picky had to send it back. It took another 10 minutes to finish cooking it (a testament to how under-cooked it was the first time and how badly the kitchen was running). Mind you, the restaurant was not packed; there were plenty of open tables, tons of front of house staff, etc. so I have no idea what was taking so long in the back of the house.

When I did get a food-safety approved plate, it was average. For $40 and 50 minutes, I would have liked a really good piece of chicken. I will give kudos to the vegetable prep cook--those were darn good, but it was hard to save the meal at that point.

So, Wolfgang, I think you need to check in on your Las Vegas digs. It's not living up to the Spago brand.",kBp_ERN-jzAmz5GnG1KK-A,0,0,2,Fjs9BO2VZfwWbejwizWIPw

3971651,2013-08-05,3,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"I went to Spago last night before the Rod Stewart concert and it was superb in every way, the room, the food, and the service!  I asked about the 6 course tasting menu and my server described the courses.  When he knew I had a show at 7:30, he thought I might not have enough time for the meal.  The he said, ""We'll make it happen.  We'll move things along.""  The meat course was the only course in which I had a choice.  You could choose either a filet or a lamb chop. 

In a few minutes, Michael brought a tray with four kinds of bread--cheese dusted lavash, cheddar bacon rolls, mini baguettes, and a cherry walnut bread.  I asked for some lavash and the bacon cheddar roll.  I didn't want to fill up on bread.  Note:  with the bread, they serve butter with ground salt on top (hooray!)

The first course was a seafood course.  There were four compartments on the dish and each one had a small portion of a different fish.  The small spoon had crab, to the right there was some tuna, above on the right was a carpaccio of octopus and to the upper left was albacore tataki.  Each had seasonings including an avocado purée on one, a small piece of melon with another and so on.  Great presentation.  Wonderful flavors!

Course 2 was the salad course.  There were two parts to this.  One was a small cup of warm tomato soup that was superb.  I asked Michael if it was on the menu, but it's not.  It really was tasty.  Along with the soup was a salad consisting of a wedge of yellow and red tomato.  It's been a long time since I had tomatoes with so much flesh and almost no seed.  There were 3 or 4 green beans lying diagonally across the tomatoes and there were some small cherry tomatoes and some more avocado purée.  Very light and lots of summer flavor.

Course 3 was the first fish course.  A bottom layer had a polenta flan.  On this was the grilled eel and on top of the eel was a fried quail egg.  The dish was decorated with some tasty cheese tuile.  The eel was moist and soft and fell apart with just a touch.  It was perfectly cooked!

Course 4 was the pasta course.  It consisted of agnolotti that was topped with pieces of lobster meat and there was some basil olive oil drizzled around the base of the pasta.  This was excellent also!

Course 5 was a second fish course--sea bass.  The bass was placed on a layer of what appeared to be thin pasta.  After delving deeper, I found that they were extremely thin, narrow slices of yellow and green squash that could have easily been mistaken for pasta until you tasted them.  Very clever execution and very tasty sea bass.  There was also a piece of melon and a grilled cherry tomato.  You can see how the chef likes to mix contrasting flavors.

Course 6 was the meat course and I chose the lamb chop (rare).  It was an herb crusted chop that had been removed from the chop with the bone left there to chew on when the main part was gone. There was some pea purée and some more basil oil.  It was truly superb!

For dessert, I first got a plate with three sorbets--blackberry, mango, and raspberry--and there was an extremely thin piece of white chocolate placed in the mango.  It was so delicate it almost melted when I picked it up.  Then I was brought a pretty plate with grasshopper cheesecake and some house made mint ice cream with chocolate flecked throughout.  There were also some chocolate decorations, a loop and a rod that were very good.  Last, I was brought 2 mignardises.  One was a watermelon jelly candy and the other one I think was marshmallow but I may be wrong.

Huge thanks to a great serving crew--Michael, my server, a young woman who was a busser in my area and had a wonderful personality, and the runners from the kitchen who explained each course beautifully.  It's too bad it wasn't recorded so I got more things correct in this review.

Michael took my credit card as time got short and I left the restaurant about 10 minutes before the start of Rod Stewart.  They did an outstanding job of moving the courses along and I was in my seat with 5 minutes to spare.

I have to come back in another season when the dishes are different and do the tasting again and take more time to savor each course.  I don't know why I overlooked Spago for so long!!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,6,5,CcAkVQT70RFCgGCvZRZ-lQ

Everyone enjoyed their food.  I had the short ribs which were pretty good.  The service was a bit slow.

It was a nice gesture for them to comp the dessert because it was my parents anniversary.

When I think of Las Vegas, I think of Spago and vice versa. We make it a point to eat here each time we go to Vegas, whether we win or lose, stay at The Flamingo, Planet Hollywood, Bellagio or Caesars. We have to. And the best part is that the menu is ever-evolving. 

During our last visit we had 
1. Oven roasted day boat Alaskan halibut
2. Grilled Virginian line caught striped bass
3. Creme Brulee 
4. Peach Tea

For our most recent visit, it was just as good. We had:
1. Mediterranean sea bass
2. California roll
3. Stir fried shanghai style egg noodles.

I loved my Alaskan halibut my last visit so i asked the waiter what was similar to it and he pointed me to the Mediterranean sea bass. it was not as soft/flaky as Chilean sea bass, but still good. It was served over a celery apple puree with celery hearts and huckleberry. It gave it an interesting, almost sweet flavor, but not what you would expect when hearing ""apple"" And I love how they prepare it in such a unique way that I know I won't likely find a dish like it anywhere else. 

The California roll was excellent as well - nothing like any of the other California rolls I've tasted - for this, the authentic crab meat was marinated in a lemon vinaigrette. 

My wife was quite pleased with her noodles, but was a little disappointed that it contained pork. After picking those pieces out though, it was delicious but a bit on the spicy side. 

What I failed to mention in my last review was the bread. We always look forward to it. A waiter comes by with a basket of four different kinds and a dish with butter, pepper, olive oil and salt. If you go, definitely try the cherry walnut bread - so good and just the right amount of sweet. The honey focaccia was tasty as well.  

Each time I go there, I'm confident that whatever the chef puts on the menu is delicious. I'll continue going here as long as it's around and like I said before, if I could give it six or seven stars, I would.

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I had the beet salad off the summer menu, which was super good. Though, I expected there would be more beets. I tasted more tomatoes than beets. For my entree, I went with the special: lobster risotto. This was to die for! It wasn't drenched in cheese. There were large chunks of lobster! Real lobster! I just wish they served a larger portion. I devoured my meal. Unfortunately, I was still hungry. They do give you bread to start, which comes with a tasty olive oil. However, I avoid the bread at the table at all restaurants.  

My girlfriends went with the pork belly appetizer and the salmon for the entree. They also enjoyed their meals but were still hungry afterwards. We were really hungry because we had not eaten all day, and just came back from a hiking trip. Perhaps this wasn't the place we should have picked for our first meal. We were trying to go to the buffet, but we couldn't wait 2 more hours to eat. We were already HANGRY! 

The service here good for the most part, however, it was a little slow. But when you're hungry, anything feels like forever. They also allowed us to dine here in our workout clothing.

Our server definitely anticipated our every need and was great. My little sister is a vegetarian and we were scared they didn't have any options for her but they were able to put together a meal that was superb for her! They gave her 4 dishes of the sides that they usually make for each of their four top selling dishes. The chef also sent out a complementary tasting of the lobster bisque. If I didn't already order at the time, I would have gotten that for my meal. 

The cherry walnut bread was the best of all the breads! Our table loved it so much that the bread staff came by and kept refilling our plates without us even asking! I started off the dinner with the lobster salad. I thought it was going to be a lot of salad and not a lot of lobster but the ratio was really good. They portioned it out enough that I was able to get a piece of grapefruit, avocado, lobster, and greens in every bite. The flavors worked so well together that I was amazed. for my entree I had the scallops which were perfectly cooked. I love scallops but never have I had them so sweet and not overcooked. My boyfriend had the mushroom pizza which was also very delicious. If I were to go back, I think I would order what my older sister ordered. She got the sea bass. 

For dessert since it was my sister's birthday they wrote happy birthday on the apple dessert. The honey mascarpone cream was to die for! 

The best part was that before the dinner they asked us if we were on a time schedule which we were. We had to make a show after dinner and they were very quick with everything from the food to the check that it gave us plenty of time to enjoy our dinner and to make the show on time.

I know liking or not like dill is a personal preference, but if it had just been listed on the menu I could have easily just ordered it without it. The lettuce was also a cheap iceberg and lots of just the spines which is really tacky and a big peeve of mine.

I've noticed some of the reviews stated the service wasn't all that great.  I can tell you from our dining experience, it was fantastic. From start to finish the staff were great... no issues... and very informative. 

The food...

If you haven't been to Spago, they have two menus. One is for fine dining, the other is for casual dining.  We went the fine dining route. 

I had the beef tar tare (a first for me) and it was delicious. My wife tried it and loved it as well. She had the white asparagus special.  Another winner of a dish.

Main course...

I had the American Wagyu steak, it was served on a bed of spinach and mushrooms. The side dish was a semolina fondue with black truffle.

The steak... it was sous vide @135 degrees for 72 hours.  It's hard to describe how amazing the steak was. It melted in your mouth like pork belly but with a great steak flavor. I was able to cut it with my fork. The texture and how it melts in your mouth is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend you order this steak. Best steak I've had to date. 

My wife had the roasted chicken with goat cheese which was on mashed potatoes and brown gravy. Comfort food galore! I tried it... loved it... she loved the meal as well. 

Deserts... 
I had chocolate bread pudding which also had passion fruit. This is where 1/2 a star was deducted. I thought the desert was tiny and the passion fruit didn't go well with the rest of the dish. 

My wife had a peanut butter souffle. Another great dish... well worth ordering. 


All in all we had a fantastic dinner with great food and great service. I would highly recommend you give this place a try. Do order the steak I mentioned... it's simply fantastic.

The dish arrived to the table shortly after and looked delicious. A first bite confirmed that it tasted delicious, too. I especially enjoyed the way that the plentiful pork carnitas got crispy on the bottom of the skillet.

Shauna!  What kind of dentist do you have?

Well, he's the significant other of a good friend's best friend, er, something like that.  

So one night in Vegas, all of us decided to go to dinner.  This was during the time I was easily dazzled by such places as Spago.  We arrived via limo and it was such a great start to the night.  

I loved the oysters we had that night.  Service was impeccable. 

And then my main course came.  I ordered halibut.

And got a fish bone stuck in my throat.  Now, I'm a very careful fish eater.  I've had my fair share of incidents in the past and though I love seafood, I rarely order bony fish.  But I love halibut and don't consider it that bony.  Unfortunately, the fish bested me that night.

I was wildly waving my arms in the air.  Pointing at my throat.  Gagging.  All of that usual ""help me, I'm choking!"" business.  But no one noticed.  

My dentist was having a good time as were my other friends drinking expensive wine.  

And the server and wait staff suddenly disappeared.

Finally, I managed to gag and get that fish bone down but I think I pierced my throat internally and was bleeding.  

Yeah, the moral of the story is you can never be too careful.

My husband ordered the filet mignon cooked medium and it was delicious-tender with the outside slightly crisp. We topped it off with the decadent and light chocolate soufflé. Pure bliss!

I went here this past weekend while I was in Vegas with my boyfriend and his friends. We were worried we were dressed too casual, but it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal. Also, we went in around 8-9ish and we were seated without having to wait.

The bread basket they give you is so good! They give you raisin bread, a cheesy/onion bread, and parmesan cracker crisps. The parmesan cracker crisps were DIVINE - I could eat a million of them, really.

For appetizers, my boyfriend ordered their crab cakes. YUM! Lots of sweet crab meat, slightly crispy on the edges, and a beautiful presentation with fresh flowers. Another friend ordered their oysters on the half shell, which I didn't try because I'm not that big of a fan of oysters, but everyone who tried it said they were SUPER fresh and delicious.

I ended up ordering their Pan Seared Duck Breast since one of my boyfriend's friends recommended it. It was really good! I loved the sweet sauce they put around the duck and the slightly crispy texture was great, as well. The duck was very moist and pretty much melts in your mouth. Definitely recommend it!

I tried my boyfriend's Kobe Ribeye. SO GOOD! It's the most expensive entree on the menu, but well worth it because the quality and quantity is incredible. So juicy, lots of flavor, and the pomme aligot, which is like cheese melted into mashed potatoes, was amazing with the meat! Although I'd probably regret it later, I could eat that pomme aligot with a spoon. A tip for the Kobe Ribeye is that they cook it differently than other restaurants. My boyfriend ordered it medium well, but it actually looked more like medium rare. Another friend at the table who ordered the same thing asked for it medium rare and it was pretty bloody.

Service is very attentive, as well, which I would expect from such a nice restaurant. Overall, good experience there, but it's definitely not an every day type of eating place. We'll probably only be going back if we win in blackjack again, lol.",AnPTGX5DBVgwt5wKopzjlg,0,0,4,4f_P6I958P_czNoMbVN5rw

We usually try to eat at the Spago cafe in the ""outside"" patio as opposed to the more formal and expensive main restaurant area. I found out on my last visit though that the lunch menu is the same for both areas but if you want a more casual and less pricey dinner, I would stick with the cafe. You will still get a great experience and a fantastic meal either way. 
Many of the dishes here rotate seasonally but some of the best stay on the menu year round. Make sure to sample the bread basket, I love that crispy cracker thing they serve. My husband says the free range chicken here is just about the best chicken he's had. I always get the gazpacho here when they have it but unfortunately, that only seems to be a few months a year. However, their soups are amazing here. On my last visit, I had a cream of mushroom soup that came with a fancy grilled cheese sandwich and it was mouthwatering. One of the best soups I can remember having. Some of the other dishes I've tried that I've enjoyed were the pappardele (although it is a bit on the heavy side) as well as the chicken salad sandwich. Spago is known for their pizzas but it's been a long time since I've ordered that here so I really can't comment on that. 
All in all I love the food here and I love what this restaurant represents to Vegas.

It was a great balance of crisp, savory and salty and the portion was huge.  Of course we received a complimentary treat of squash stew, which was also a delicious start.  The layered beet and goat cheese Napoleon was perfect in execution and flavor...just a hint of acid from the beet and dressing.  We then received another unexpected treat from the chef of the lamb in lettuce wrap.  I have to admit that as I read the description it did not call out to me, but it was a great slightly spicy morsel, perfectly offset by the crisp buttercup lettuce.  We also tried the squash agnolotti with hazel nuts....perfect!  My wife ordered the yellow tail and being from Hawaii we are fussy about this dish.  It had a great sear, and was appropriately raw in the middle....as good as I have had anywhere, and nicely seasoned.  I had the lobster and spinach fettucini with black bean sauce.

I'm big on italian food so I was trying to decide between either the pizza or pasta and ended up choosing the ""pasta a la bolognaise"" which was a huge mistake.

1. Recently married couple in a booth near us drinking champagne and eating crazy amounts of good food.

2. A gentlemanly waiter with a calm, professional demeanor.

3. An older couple in a booth drinking tons of wine.

4. Us, just wandered in after making a last minute Yelp reservation via Open Table.

I was not expecting this level of quality food from a Wolfgang restaurant because we had been to a bunch of other WG restaurants in Vegas and we were not disappointed, but we weren't wow'ed that's for sure.

This Spago in the Forum Shops is a real gem.  My boyfriend ordered from the fancy menu and I ordered from the outside cafe menu.  The waiter was cool with it even though he did mention they don't often do it.  Oh, I guess I'm special? (insert funny face emoji).  

The best thing we ate was a special.  It was a super thin crust pizza.  I can't even begin to describe how amazing it was--but it must have been the triple cream (cre-em) cheese--however that's pronounced.

Suffice it to say, the atmosphere, the nearby diners, the service, and food were all winnahs!

4241264,2015-10-05,13,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"We have this place to thank for starting the whole foodie scene in Vegas. I once had the chance to tour the kitchen here, and it was un-fucking-believeable: a walk-in full of fresh organic veggies from the local Farmer's Market, another walk-in full of house-made pasta in every shape and size, and a third full of freshly glistening dissected animal parts, patiently waiting all plump and juicy and pink. Staff sweated intently throughout, and one guy was hunched over a plate, patiently de-tangling strands of corn silk with two forks, as intent as if he were performing brain surgery...all to garnish the plate of some Botox-faced Newport Beach poseur who was probably just gonna puke it up in the bathroom after one too many daiquiris at the Celine Dion show anyway. 

Since it's been around forEVER, Spago doesn't get much hype any more...but the fact is, it's BOMB-ASS, farm-fresh, expertly prepared food of exceptional quality with an ever-changing menu featuring stuff that's actually in season, depending on the time of year. 

Anything I've ever had here has been excellent -- both in the cafe out front, and in the fine dining area in the back. On my last visit we sampled some of the house-made sausages, which were amazing, along with some lobster salad, pear salad with house-made yogurt sauce and pear butter (YUM!!) and a sort of garden salad made with tomatoes and arugula fresh from the local farmer's market that very morning. Even the bread basket was exceptional, with an assortment of truly adventurous breads (and no fucking pretzel bread -- which I consider the sign of an amateur).

But the BEST part about Spago is the people watching! If you sit in the cafe area (and order off the cafe menu), you are treated to the best spectacle this side of Fremont Street: the Forum Shops! You can sit sipping a glass of wine, watching the parade of tragic fashion slaves and aspirational bourgeoisie strutting past, arms laden with bagsful of ill-financed luxury purchases. You'll see few members of the genuine gentry, but plenty of poseurs: makeup-caked Mexican trophy wives, haughty ex-whore girlfriends of Russian oligarchs, shop-happy Japanese, etc. It's the greatest show on Earth!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,11,13,5,ZgOIIjQoV5RsbU43xVyNzg

The location, to some, is ideal if you're perusing around the Forum Shops & want a delightful meal, but for me, it's a pain in the rear to get there unless you're already inside Caesars.  And it's rather noisy since it's open to the Forum Shops.

The staff is always friendly!  I always go for lunch, (sit at the bar for the fastest service).  My fave is the chopped salad, all organic, fresh ingredients and the iced tea. I'm a picky tea snob and their passion flavored variety is deeeeeeeeeelish!!  It's a little pricey but worth it, I always get a to-go cup, they're happy to oblige.  They serve a bread basket upon seating and it's great, there's this one that has I think a cranberry in it, it's like crack. I normally end up requesting one more :)

4245983,2008-10-14,1,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"I absolutely loved this place. One of my best meal experiences. 

That said, I will begin with the truth. I had my doubts. I only knew a handful of things about Wolfgang Puck: (1) he's a celebrity chef, (2) he haz an accent, and (3) he cooks for the Oscars. S'it. 

This could have gone either way. It could be amazing because, well, he cooks for ze movie stars and he wouldn't be world famous if his food was awful. Or, it could all just be hype.  

Well, Wolfgang Puck is amazing, and he is famous for a reason. Because his talent is delicious. 

THE FOOD: We totally conquered. 

The white peach bellini was one of or probably the best bellini I ever had. Each sip was like biting into a crisp, juicy, succulent white peach. Even though it didn't seem like very much in the glass, I got a nice little buzz from it. That must be quality champagne. 

The bread waiters came and offered you as much as you wanted from a bountiful basket. We got to choose from a sourdough, a cherry walnut, an olive loaf, a cracker (with seeds, herbs, and things - since I don't like crackers, this was my least favorite), and an onion focaccia. The soft, slightly sweet, buttery cube of onion focaccia was clearly the favorite of the night. Dipped in their quality olive oil, it was a great meal starter. 

The amuse bouche was a cappuccino sized cup of cold, creamy pea soup. It tasted so fresh. As if you plucked the peas yourself, eating them while still standing in a garden, with your toes in the cool dirt. However, since I'm not a cold soup fan, I didn't like it that much. 

We ordered several appetizers to share. The crab cakes, the heirloom tomato soup, the warm wild mushroom salad, and the octopus salad. 

The heirloom tomato soup was probably my favorite dish of the entire night, and that's saying something since my meal and the warm wild mushroom salad were both incredible. I mean, sooo many wins here. The soup was large, came in a clay-pot sized, white porcelain bowl complete with cute hat, and a crostini that was spread with a creamy white cheese and then piled high with fluffy parmesan. On top of the soup was a thin design of balsamic vinegar that complimented the soup like jelly compliments peanut butter. Spooning up a mouthful and letting the fresh tomato, sweet balsamic, exotic herbs, and delicate cream dance in my mouth was a little piece of Heaven. 

The warm mushroom salad was layered with mushrooms I can't name, but they were each delicious. Some of the mushrooms were delicate, while others were slightly crunchy and ""meaty"" (like portobellos). The salad was tossed warm with arguala and pomegranate seeds and was a heart warming, unique salad that was perfect for a Fall day (in windy Las Vegas). 

I ordered the special because I couldn't resist the following words: truffle-cream + Alaskan king crab. Other words like mushroom, onion, and fettucine were in there as well. It was, of course, awesome. I mean, it had truffle oil in it. Truffle oil makes everything better! 

My mom ordered the seafood paella and it was very tasty, though a tad undercooked, IMO. The scallops and shrimp were huuuge! The bf ordered what I deemed the ""pig plate"" which consisted of pork belly, pork loin, and 3 kinds of sausage including blood - very neat concept. Overall, every single person was over-the-moon pleased with their dinner. 

Unfortunately (very very), I was over-ruled when it came to dessert. Everybody else was too full, so we didn't try any. I bet they're fantastic though. Next time... 

ATMOSPHERE: Ending with looks and folks. Spago is hard, clean lines, it's modern art, mirrors, and black walls. Too noisy for an intimate dinner, but fun for a family or group. Service was polite, friendly, and extremely accomodating, but I didn't feel all warm and fuzzy like I did at Alexander's. It was quite nice when they saw us pouring our own wine and decided to swoop in and do it themselves. Nice catch. Prices were SURPRISINGLY reasonable! You can spend $50 to $150 a person, your choice.

What is more important to the Vegas culinary scene than Wolfgang Puck's eponymous Spago? I mean, he paved the way for chefs who were skeptical about opening restaurants in Las Vegas. We owe this man everything; Las Vegas would not be a culinary destination if not for him.

Spago is THE restaurant to go to, really for any occasion, you can't go wrong. I have been here for both lunch and dinner and each experience was top-notch, although in the evening in the formal dining area it is more private and romantic. 

I have tried multiple items on the menus over the years, steaks, chicken, fish pastas, etc. and everything was wonderful. You cannot go wrong with the menu, everything is delicious. All of the desserts are great too. Almost each time I've gone I've gotten free dessert since I am a local, score! In fact, I once went for lunch with four other friends, and although I was the only local, they brought out 3-4 desserts for free anyway.  

As you can imagine, the service is impeccable. The waiters describe the food in such a manner that you literally drool. They are super knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients and on top of that everybody is very friendly. 

Whenever out-of-towners ask me for a recommendation on where to eat; Spago is always on my top five list, regardless of the occasion. It is great for lunch to people watch and at dinner the ambiance is just spectacular. And on top of that the food is great!

We had come in late the evening before and after a full day of pool and sun we were ready for some proper food.

I'm so glad we decided to give it a try. Our server was knowledgeable with the wine selection and the food choices. Like I said we were hungry so for appetizer we had a Margherita Pizza and each of us had a pasta meal. Can't recall the names but mine was crab meat with fettuccine in a spicy sauce. Utterly amazing.

I was dinning here with a large group for a business dinner with clients. I have an egg allergy which makes going out to eat difficult sometimes. To avoid the humiliation of asking the server a million questions in front of clients I had called ahead to see what was available to me to eat on the menu. 

The hostess was very polite and then said she would direct me to the kitchen, she put me through to the head chef...at 5pm....on a Saturday, already amazing and unheard of service. He was one of the most caring strangers I have spoken with on the phone and told me he would accommodate anything I wanted to order to my allergy.

We arrived for dinner and the server was already informed of my allergy. I ordered an amaze balls Moscow mule and then the Chilean sea bass where the server carefully adjusted the entree to cater to my allergy needs. The food came out and everyone's entrees were stunning, and made for awesome conversation at the table. My bass was perfectly spiced, and honestly just perfect all around. 

We got dessert and I had a bowl of fresh fruit, at this point the head chef actually came out of the kitchen to make sure everything was okay. He explained his wife has allergies so it always hits home for him. It was the best service I have ever experienced, and I think this type of gesture is unheard of and truly a rarity.

Tuna tartare: small portion, but so so worth it. The tuna was fresh and wen't perfect with the aioli, avocado and rice cracker. They warned us it was a little spicy, but my wimpy self thought it was fine. 
Crab Tagliatelle: A must order. Cheapest thing on the menu turned out to be the best. It was a little on the salty side, but the chunks of crab were huge and the lemon-y sauce went perfectly with the noodles. Ask to have them split the plates so you can share! 
Jidori Chicken: so soft, so juicy. Huge portion of chicken with mashed potatoes. Ordering chicken at a fancy restaurant seems like a waste, but I enjoyed it. The other meats didn't catch my eye as much! I loved the tagliatelle a loooot more.

I was worried that this restaurant would be more hype than substance given it's LA location's reputation.  That couldn't have been further from the truth.

We were in Vegas to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday and the 21st birthday of her friend.

The dinner started with an introduction of the waitstaff.  He wanted to know if we were in a hurry or wanted a leisurely dinner.  Since we didn't have show tickets we requested a leisurely dinner.

The wine list was notable and the waitstaff were very familiar with the items on the list.  Our first bottle was an older vintage so the waiter aerated and strained it to take the sediment out.  He was very nice and explained what he was doing to the young drinkers at the table.

We started with the shrimp cocktail, Pumpkin Agnolotti (Mascarpone, Parmesan Reggiano, French Burgundy Truffles) and Porcini ""Bacon & Eggs"" (Pecorino Romano, Semolina, Confit Egg, Pancetta).  The ""Bacon & Eggs"" is the house specialty.

The shrimp were huge and wonderfully tasty.  The agnolotti was the crowd pleaser with a great holiday flavor profile.  The Bacon & Eggs was my personal favorite.  The use of the semolina with the confit egg and pancetta was delightful.

Three of us had duck and my husband had the shoulder of lamb.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The side items were as flavorful and inviting as the entree.  We had a good time trying to identify the purees, etc and when we asked for a menu to determine if we were correct, it was unnecessary because the waiter, Jeremy, was fully versed in each item and could answer all our questions.

The birthday girls ordered the chocolate cremieux with raspberry coulis.  They both said it was the best chocolate dessert they had ever eaten.

We were gifted with the petit four sampler which was a passion fruit marshmallow and a Chinese five spice chocolate.  None of us like marshmallows but we all liked these.  They were moist and flavorful.

At one point during the dinner the waiter asked the chef to drop by our table.  I don't know if he was caught off guard or just doesn't like this aspect of his job because he basically said hello and walked off.  In this world of celebrity chefs, etc. he may want to work on his table side manner or stay in the kitchen.

The service overall was outstanding!  They made a 3-hour meal fly by.  I did think the constant hovering of the management staff was a little bit of overkill given the superb service by the waitstaff but since it is working, who am I to judge.

I will definitely return to this restaurant and keep my eye on Chef Klein.",9lhZd8oHmdpHI-narT6pOA,0,0,5,ZNEUTbgnpOyHPBE8wSt4Nw

To start off, I ordered the Sam Smith Nut Brown Ale and my buddy ordered a corona.  They were both poured for us into a very tall glass that was narrow at the bottom and then wider towards the top.  My friend said it was far too nice a glass for a corona ;)  Anyway, I highly recommend the Nut Brown Ale, wherever you can find it.  

Before the food came out, we sampled their bread.  The Parmesan variety was ""the best restaurant bread"" my buddy had ever had.  The bread fixings included a four-way divided plate full with salt, pepper, olive oil and butter, very nice touch. 

On the to the food.  I ordered the Nebraska Corn-feed Skirt Steak Hunan style.  Wow! It was so good that I twittered about it and was prompted to write this review.  I made a joke that the meat was so good that the cow must have been pampered with a burberry scarf when it was raised.  I had just gone in the burberry store before we were seated (it is next door and no I didn't buy anything - wayyyyy overpriced).  The steak was medium-well and seasoned to perfection.  My plate was adorned with green beans and they were also savory.  Overall this plate almost made me http://www.hulu.com/watch/47604/saturday-night-live-snl-digital-short-j-in-my-pants

Last time I was here, I had the free range organic chicken and it was great. If you've never had free range chicken, you are missing out on the best poultry you can eat. Cooked to perfection, flavourful, and juicy. It's a little ""tougher"" than regular chicken which gives it a wonderful texture. 

The sole fish special was also spectacular, though a bit on the small side (actually, it's exactly what a single serving should be). A cut of fresh sole wrapped with ham and breaded. They cook or marinade it in a slightly sweet sauce that I can only describe as heavenly. 

The short ribs were tender, juicy, and succulent. They don't even bother asking you how you want it cooked like amateurs... they just bring it out, cooked to perfection. 

The service was outstanding. We had a show at 7PM and the wait staff made sure we waited for nothing. Everything came out fast, nothing was left unattended for more than a minute, and yet we never felt rushed by the staff. 

I usually make it a rule--when on a trip (business or pleasure), never eat at the same place twice. Life's too short for reruns... but Spago is one of the few exceptions.",Qxm1plYx7mU5yd5gsJJvBA,1,1,5,0GxsqI1Ws_CshSt-NC14xw

Food (4.5/5): Every dish is made with only the best ingredients and presented beautifully! You'll find something for everyone on their classic menu. Steaks, seafood and pastas. 

Ambiance (5/5): Very open plan with a lovely view of the Roman themed Caesar's Palace shops. Up and downstairs dining areas with private and semi-private rooms to reserve. 

Service (6/5): For my party of 15, we were given the semi-private dining room and at least 5 servers. They checked on us constantly and gave us lots of attention. Would definitely recommend Spago for a large party!

Price: $$$

One of the places listed was Wolfgang Puck's Spago. We agreed that this was the place we wanted to go, and the coupon made it even better!

Out of all the times I have been to Vegas, I had never really done anything but look around the forum shops at Caesar's Palace. When I saw that Spago was located in there, I was excited to eat for my first time in Caesar's. I loved that there is ""outdoor"" seating, meaning that you can eat on the patio of the restaurant under the blue sky ceiling of the forum shops. Makes you feel like your on a patio in Europe. We had a very nice waitress. I ordered and cosmo - my standard, and then a glass of pinto grigio with dinner. We had the hand cut fettuccini and chicken sausage pizza - both were amazing!

We showed up on time for our reservation and were sat promptly.  The hostess was very friendly.  We were immediately approached by one of our servers.  Everyone who spoke to us, including the manager were great.

We started with the Olsen Farm's Baby Arugula Salad.  The salad comes with Bartlett Pears, burrata, prosciuitto, vinegar and olive oil.  The flavors combined nicely.  It was a nice start to the meal.

Next we ordered the Pumpkin Agnolotti.  I am not a huge pumpkin fan, but the flavors together were very good.  Mascarpone comes on the side and the agnolotti comes with with parmesan and truffles.  The textures also blend well together.

For my meal I ordered the Grilled Prime Beef Filet.  The filet was prepared perfectly.  It comes with carmelized red onions, watercress, celery, fingerling potatoes, bone marrow persillade and peppercorn sauce.  While the filet is clearly the focus, the other components add even more to the meal.  The filet is seasoned lightly.

For dessert we chose the Peanut Butter Souffle.  It takes about ten minutes for them to prepare it, but it is well worth that short wait.  It is so fluffy, and filled with rich peanut butter flavor.  The lemon ice cream on the side seemed out to me, but they went quite well together.  Our server recommended we add a shot of chocolate liquor to the bottom of the plate for even more flavor.  It stepped up the flavor even more.

4451802,2014-06-20,1,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Spago has been around for awhile. It is certainly a staple of the Forum Shops. And, it has to be a Vegas must-try, especially if you're a local. You can't live here and not eat here at least once. I support this mostly because it has been around for so long and has not been transformed into another eatery.

Wolfgang Puck is doing a good job here. It isn't a home-run, but it is damn close. 

My friend and I dined on a Wednesday night at about 6 PM. We chose to sit ""outside"" versus inside of the restaurant. Each place has its own menu. Dining inside means paying more money, basically.

Being outside is fine though, and boasts a menu with many great options. 

The beginning of the meal is what draws the most ire for me. They presented some bread, which is fine, but the bread was boring and the butter was hard as a rock. If the bread had been warm, the butter being cold wouldn't have been such an issue, but with both the bread and butter being cold, it was hard to spread. I know, am I a whiny brat, or what? *cringes at my own hoity-toity-ness*

We started with the Maryland crab cakes, topped with heirloom tomatoes, aioli, and herbs. The cakes were small, but fresh. Fresh taste = good for me. Tomatoes were a nice acidic addition.

My main course was the braised beef short ribs. Spectacular. Moist and mouth-watering. Falls apart under your fork. A bit of fattiness (to be expected). But this dish starts cooking in the early morning and by the time you are having it at 6:30 PM at night - perfection! Came with asparagus and gnochi. Gnochi was only okay. It was a bit over-cooked. Minor detail.

Lastly, we had the Valrhona Chocolate Cremeux. A lovely little dessert, incredibly rich, with fresh raspberries and an almond-crunch center. My friend also partook of some tea, which they boast quite a menu full of numerous varieties with interesting descriptions. For instance, my friend's tea was described as ""Fresh Cut Grass/Ocean Mist"". I thought it tasted like green tea, but smelt a bit like my front yard in the Summer.

I'm glad I tried Spago. I think it is doing well and holding its own. There's no reason I would not go back.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,4,hx4hrIpekrtz1wSmUnacsQ

More: Pancetta-wrapped meatloaf & hand-cut fettuccini are the dishes we sampled here.  They both tasted good but lacked a ""wow"" factor or even an ""oh nice"".  It was simply, ""not bad"".

Never saw the pancetta wrapped around the meatloaf, we wonder if it is made wrapped then unwrapped when served.  It was moist, flavorful but ultimately forgettable.

The fettuccini was also good, a bit bland but tasty.  Just a hint of salt brought out good flavor.  We had to add chicken to this dish for a protein, which is $10 so a single pasta dish amounts to $30 at this point.  Portions are modest which is common in upscale dining.

Bread basket is a nice treat here. Trio of dips, sea salt, butter & olive oil was nice.  Variety of breads and crisps to snack on while we wait for our meals, which came out rather quickly.

Service was great which is expected in this type of establishment.  We enjoyed our lunch but Spago did not give me any hook to return if faced with a choice of Grand Lux or even In N Out if I haven't had that for a while.",eVNLEqQatmzpmsuK-K4Z8w,0,0,3,fnMeCX9y6jfJLnBBHGt6Gg

While waiting for Celine's show, my fiance & I decided to grab dinner before the show.  We didn't have time to order an appetizer, but the assortment of breads were quite fresh and enough to hold us over until our entrees arrived.
My entree was the Red Wine Braised Beef Short Ribs, and it was honestly out of this world.  It isn't a dish that I normally covet, but this was an amazing attempt to remake a normally plain American dish.  The beef was so tender that I didn't even need a knife for it, and the sauce complimented it so well that every bite I took renewed my appreciation of great food; definitely recommend it to all, definitely 5+ stars.
Our other entree was the Pan Seared Duck Breast which was also pretty savory.  The meat was quite tender and it came in an orange sauce with mushrooms that complimented it very well.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but still pretty darn good, 4 stars.

I was initially inclined to give this restaurant 4 stars because the menu seems pretty basic (in terms of options, NOT skill or flavor).  But, when I requested an iced tea and  all they offered was something I can't drink, the waiter (Scott) offered a non-menu tea & threw it on ice.

I was by myself so I sat at the bar, my bartender was very friendly and despite thinking I wasn't going to drink I ended up having a cocktail and a beer.

The atmosphere at Spago is nice but casual, you can see everyone walking by in the forum shops and it does seem like a nice spot to come to for lunch, the place wasn't particularly crowded and along the bar there were only about two or three other patrons.

I opted to try the Thai Chicken Salad and the Meatloaf.

The salad was a good starter, nice and flavorful, satisfying but not overly filling. I got the half portion which was a nice start and I probably could have shared that with someone. 

The bread came nicely presented with three sides of salt, butter, and olive oil with a touch of rosemary. Can't remember the three types of bread off the top of my head, one was a crispy pita-like bread, the other had cranberries in it I believe, and there was one more could have been sourdough but I can't remember.

Finally the meatloaf, which is one of their most popular dishes apparently, was interesting, the mashed potatoes were cooked and seasoned nicely, for me the meatloaf was just alright -- It was good but I've definitely had better as well.

The name on the restaurant  = expectations.
Wolfgang Puck... you did not disappoint.

I went in without much expectation. I actually expected it to be a little overrated.
Boy, was I wrong.

I will start with the service.
As soon as we walked in the manager greeted us and made small talk.
At such a big-name restaurant, it was unexpected. 
Then, we were led to a table in the smack middle of the restaurant (the manager said that it was the best seat in the house.. maybe he was exaggerating, but it made us feel so loved!!! lol) 

From their wine selection to choices in entree, I appreciated the variety. 

Here is a list of foods I've tried and their ratings.
-Blue crab salad: fresh and refreshing
-hongkong style salmon: a little too salty, but the fish was not dry-at all.
-ahi tuna: cooked to perfection!

Appetizer, pasta dish, sashimi dish, pasta dish, fish/seafood dish, beef dish, and dessert.

The food is incredibly tasty and unique, and the portions is of ""tasting"" size.   My friends and I were struggling to finish.  Also, the menu changes everyday so every time you have the tasting menu it should always be different in some way. 

I will have to honestly say that I think the overall value of the six course meal should really be in the neighborhood of $60-$75, for $100 I was expecting better.   The fish and beef courses wasn't anything to sing home about, I thought they were both overcooked in both instances.  The beef wasn't even if high grade (shoulder or round).

The girl ordered some sushi platter, which consisted of maybe 7 or 8 slices of sushi for 25 bucks or so.  The sushi was fresh and tasty, but that's to be expected from a high end restaurant bearing Wolfgang Puck's name...so to me, that's not nearly enough to merit a high rating.

I, on the other hand, ordered a ""Schnitzel,"" or something.  I was expecting something along the lines of a gourmet sausage, but when it came it looked like a flattened piece of lean Tonkatsu.  However, I was mildly intoxicated which usually gives just about anything an upgrade in the taste department.  This however, just oozed average in about every aspect.  

The portions were generous for a fancy place like Spago, but I was just so unimpressed by the meat.  One of the signature dishes I make in my home kitchen is Tonkatsu, and I would take mine over the ""Schnitzel"" any day of the week, even if it was competitively priced at $8.95 plus tax for an identical meal.

The food is yummy...who doesn't like Wolfgang Puck?  We came here for the last night of my bachelorette party and everyone ordered a couple plates and shared. My sister and I ordered the asparagus salad and a veggie pizza.Both were delicious.

Our waiter knew it was a bachelorette party because the bride wore a crown and sash on, so he gave us a plate of yummy truffles and chocolate brought to our table to end the meal.

The view is fun...great place for people watching and what trip to Vegas is complete without visiting the Forum  Shops at Cesar's?  Love this place!

After doing a little last minute shopping in Caesar's we got hungry and decided to try Spago. We all shared the Chicken Sausage Pizza, their handcut fettuccini with shrimp, a burger, and a plate of their calamari. The prices here were actually pretty decent for Vegas, as were the portion sizes. The pizza was very warm and crispy, but a bit too thin for my liking, as I usually prefer pizzas that are thicker and heavier. I think my favorite dishes of our meal had to be the fettuccini and calamari. The calamari was breaded nicely and chewy like how calamari should be. However, the crowd favorite was definitely the handcut fettuccini. The fettuccini came with 3 fresh pieces of jumbo shrimp served on top a nice warm bed of noodle-like pasta. I say ""noodle-like"" because unlike most pastas, Spago's fettuccini had a texture that was more like the texture of Asian egg noodles.

The only complaint I had was that in contrary to the what others mentioned in their reviews, my family was not at all offered bread and had to ask both our waiter, and the woman who seemed to be the head waitress, twice for a plate of bread. Not only that, but they didn't serve the bread to us until the rest of our food was out as well.",83ivu6_UjSUaBnR5jD27rw,4,2,4,TCitFilWbTQSmY8S9e5bOg

I opted for the Oysters on the Half Shell ($22 for half dozen). The selection was Pickling Pass Oysters served with Red Wine Ginger Mignonette. The oysters and mignonette were great, but unfortunately had broken-off shell bits everywhere.

We also shared the Cheese Plate ($25):
Flora Nelle Organic Blue Cheese: Organic cows milk, aged 6 months
Tête de Moine: Triple cream cow's milk, aged 2 weeks; Burgundy, France
Brillat Savarin: Semi-soft part skim cheese; AOC, Switzerland 
Chimay à la Biére Trappiste: Pasteurized cow's milk, semi-soft, washed with beer; Belgium

Pineapple mojito - quite delicious

Some stirred drink with cucumber - SO GOOD! It tasted like sweetened cucumber juice. I was so surprised! It was really refreshing and yumm.

6 oysters on the half shell - ($22, 5 stars) - I forgot the name of the oysters they had that day, but they said it was a larger version of Kunamoto oysters (my fav!). They paired really well with the rhubarb mignonette. 

Sauteed Maryland crab cake - ($16, 5 stars) - They were just how I like them - lump crab meat, lightly breaded, and served with a lemon garlic aioli.

Pan seared duck breast - ($37, 4 stars) - I LOVED the mushrooms, stewed cabbage, and mashed white corn they paired it with, but the duck breast itself was OK. I thought it had a cured taste to it, instead of the usual gamey flavor, but the boy thought it tasted like bacon.

I had the brussel sprouts side and the squash agnolotti as recommended (between Truffles w/spaghettini and agnolotti). Both were meh. The brussel sprouts were described as miso and yuzu flavored - aside from a brief note of citrus, these just tasted like slightly salty brussel sprouts. The agnolotti, though beautiful, tasted exactly like any other squash ravioli with butter and sage I've ever had.

I had asked for the dessert menu up front so I could strategize and it didn't impress me enough, which is why I decided on the brussel sprouts instead.

Portions can be small, but it seems to vary depending on what you order. The housemade ravioli, was seriously a single 5-inch ravioli on the plate. I quickly decided against it when it came to the diners next to me.

We shared a Caesar salad, and this was probably the best part of our meal. I would order this again as I thought it was a pretty good salad, with real anchovy! Probably full of sodium though...

I have to say that although their wine menu is a good one, it doesn't coincide with the menu. The prices seem outrageous compared to menu prices, and we purchased bottles at 5 star places all weekend. They are just missing this here. 

I had the Hand Cut Fettuccine. It seemed like the pasta was straight out of your grocer's refrigerated section. The mushrooms were the best part.

The Mushroom Soup was the most impressive of the three dishes. I loved the fluffy wild mushrooms atop the delicious lightly creamy soup.
Our saffron Risotto dish with scallop, crab, and chorizo sounded amazing on the menu but didn't quite deliver. The scallop was plopped in the middle of creamy risotto, but the risotto itself tasted plain and did not encompass the flavors of the seafood and meat.

What We Ordered:

Sonoma Duck Breast cooked Medium: This dish was recommended by the server as one of his personal favorites. This was the dish that ordered. This is one of the best Duck dishes that I have ever received. It was cooked to perfection with the skin nice a crispy. The vegetables and sauces complemented the dish so well. I would come back again to order this dish.

Pork Chop the Day's Special cooked Medium: The pork was cooked perfect and juicy. Nicely flavored. The boyfriend ordered this dish, and his plate looked like it was locked clean, nothing left but the bone. 

French Seabass: This was the second dish the server recommended. The fish was season perfectly with a hint of lemon. The fish itself was not dry, and the skin was so crispy (which I love).

I would recommended these dishes as listed above. 

My Favorite Dessert: Out of the 3 we ordered, my favorite was the Salted Caramel Souffle with Figi Apple Sorbet. This was extraordinarily good! Each element separately was amazing, together they were mind blowing. 

We Did Have a Slight Issue: the Duck I had ordered originally came to me overdone. From reviewing my photos, the dish also looked like it was originally incomplete. I don't usually send back food, but everyone at the table said I should, as the dish was expensive and should be prepared to my specifications. After letting one of our servers know, a new dish came out 15 minutes later served to me by the manager and several staff. They were sincerely sorry and wished me Happy Birthday. Due to the slight hiccup my dish was on the house, as well as the desserts we ordered.

Overall: Even with the hiccup, the experience was great. The staff tried their best to make sure that my birthday wasn't ruined.

Spago is located in the Forum Shops and is a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  The decor inside is elegant, service was tremendous, and to food was amazing.  My boyfriend's Beef Tenderloin was huge and juicy.  My seabass was moist and buttery, just how I like it.  The calamari was standard.  All in all, a great dining experience but a little tough on the wallet!

Followed that with sauteed scallops, which were perfectly caramelized on both sides. And because I just couldn't get enough, I had to have the chocolate layered cake. 

Service was top-notch. Executive Chef Eric Klein was a regular on the floor and chatting with patrons. You could tell he really cared about the diners. He sent along a free butternut squash soup amuse bouche my way and ended the meal with a petit four, also gratis. 

Honestly, it was a meal that could've gone on forever. I didn't want it to end!",P48T12xNI3lNNw9qeM_y5A,0,0,5,a2HOePdXtgo0XP0ipDXF1Q
4864963,2014-11-25,1,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"We stopped by here prior to going to a Cirque show on our first night in Vegas.  I made reservations for 5 so I expected to have a table ready at that time.  Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...

We were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this ""Spago"" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  

Now, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? 

I wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either. This is just not worth your time OR MONEY...there are better restaurants out there for competitive prices.  Nothing to see at this establishment but they are clearly enjoying the benefit of being inside the Forum Shops.  Don't say you weren't warned...",7YOVtML-Ghzc69Ww2BptDw,3,0,1,_RNESCad9ZJeztYV6rLJUw

But this year, we wanted to do something special for our Fifth Anniversary. We had a big health scare, and...wanted to do something special. Screw Price. So we opted for the tasting menu at Spago. After reading previous yelp reviews, we expected a good night, 5 courses, some tasty cocktails...

We had NINE COURSES. For $100/person + drinks. Nine. I'm pretty sure we had like, 3 deserts? The lemon sorbet...the blackberry sorbet topped ricotta and graham cracker cheesecake, and then the candy tasting plate....yeah. That's 3. We had an amazing Sashimi that was served on a bed of seaweed with dry ice making the salt smell...oh yeah....

sorry I had a moment. 

Mustard and cantaloupe...those shouldnt go together, I can't stop thinking about it. It was with the sashimi....


Sorry. Moment. 

Then there was a cold soup soup/salad that redifined tomato for me forever....and then crab salad, and risotto with truffle and parmesan, and then halibut and peppers with a carrot puree, and then lamb with a different carrot puree.....and...oi...Did I mention this was October 10th? I remember what I ate down to the texture of each berry slice.

Food came at a perfect pace, we had enough time to eat slowly and savor an unusual meal, without feeling like ""man, where is the next course!?"" Everything was presented so elegantly and with such grace I almost felt too plebian to be eating this food...but the staff was so warm and welcoming, I also felt like I was almost a regular. They clearly knew the night was special for us, and god, it felt like it. 

I forgot about the money, I forgot about what we were doing after, I forgot about brain scans, and scary doctor visits, and I just thought about how most amazing the tomatoes were -even in comparison to heirlooms straight out of my grandma's garden---I wonder if I brought the chef some unnamed heirlooms from my grandma's garden if he'd cook them---and how spectacular this moment was with my husband...For that alone, 11 stars. 30. Thank you, Spago. For one night of just indulging in flavor and texture and taste....

On the way to the parking ramp, after rambling about how awesome everything was, my husband remarked ""You know, for that meal, for 9 courses, $100 seems ridiculously affordable."" And you know what? I agree.

Dining alone, I was offered a seat at the very outer rail affording great people watching.  The wait was very brief which was a surprise as the restaurant was very busy and I did not have a reservation; welcoming staff that even went as far as to correct my disheveled lapel.

On the patio, the seating is a bit crowded for egress and passage, but ample for movement.  I chose the Soup du Jour and Cascerecci Pasta à la Bolognaise as an entrée.  The soup texture was rather thick, and hot but very, very flavorful; spicy a bit.  I do not recommend this to everyone, yet those that enjoy a bit of ""heat"" and a flavor reminiscent of Jambalaya will be very satisfied.  The Cascerecci Pasta à la Bolognaise was very good - not outstanding, but very good.  The sauce didn't bore or excite and the pasta was cooked just right, but didn't ""wow.""  I didn't catch the Garlic, I did however, enjoy the Braised Beef - and the Ricotta Cheese was most pronounced and flavorful of all with each mouthful.

I'm very satisfied with dinner and actually can think of no detractions.  I suppose it's rare to dine and the venue hit a mark where you are without comment beyond a great meal without incident.  I must say the view, a meal that meets exact expectations, and a dialed in professional staff is a surprise.

What you will get here is slightly imaginative food -- they serve olive oil and a selection of salts with the bread, for example.  But in the end, a pizza is a pizza, and these are good but not great.

The ambiance, however, is way above average, and thus the fourth star.  See my picture for the view you get when dining on their patio.

Hint:  There are two restaurants here.  The fancy one to the right as you come in and the more casual one to the left.

Spago is a casual restaurant with a luxurious feel to it.  Service and quality far exceeds the price (which is rare at restaurants). We ordered fried calamari and the lamb chorizo pizza.

The sauce made all the difference.  The pizza was great too. It had thin slices of lamb, goat cheese and small pieces of orange on it.  It tasted very unique and flavorful. They also had a large variety of bread to choose from along with a blend of goat cheese and sour cream to go along with it.

I will never return.
I know Vegas is Vegas and everything is a tourist trap and astronomically over priced.. I get it.
But, there has to be some redeeming quality to help 'justify' being taken advantage of.
Not here.
The waiter attempted to be high class, however his use of ""this is my personal favorite"" on about 10 different items, completely lost his credibility.  The only goal was to increase the tab without a doubt.
$55 for a tiny filet that was sliced, yes sliced into a few pieces!!!  Come on, give the the whole filet at least.  Then not prepared properly.  But the worst part was the menu description of Bernaise Espuma was the worst attempt at Bernaise sauce I've ever had.  Nothing near Berniase sauce, except maybe that was the Espuma means ""not really Berniase""  I automatically order filet with Bernaise every time I see it and have enjoyed this combination for many years at some very very fine restaurants all around the world, so I am confident I understand what it is supposed to be like
A table of 8 of us, and I did not get any bread as I was last to get the dish.  Just the cracker like strips. Not once were we asked if we wanted more bread?  More?  I just wanted some!
A small glob of spinach on the side was useless and tasteless.
Sides of brussel sprouts and mushrooms, oh, by the way, the waiter's ""personal favorites"" were uneventful and overpriced.

Atmosphere - Spago is deceptive. On the outside it looks very cafe-ish but once you enter it is sophisticated and trendy and overall has a feel which is elegant enough for an important date while being relaxed and hip enough for a group of friends having dinner. 

Service - The service was good but not great. On our initial drink order the waiter skipped a few of the people who weren't paying attention to him. Now, I understand it isn't polite to miss the waiter when he comes around but it wouldn't have ruined his life to tap the guys on the shoulder or just say ""excuse me"".

We ordered the potstickers for our appetizer, the cilantro pesto fettuccini pasta with shrimp, and the mushroom pizza. The potstickers were AWESOME, but I don't know if I would pay $15 for them (which we did).

* Tagliatelle with Black Truffles - 1.5 stars: VERY disappointing noodles. Bland, boring sauce. Barely any truffles / truffle flavor.

Atmosphere: Inside the Forum Shops. It looks pretty normal from the outside, but it's actually quite fancy and dim on the inside. Nice, large booths and tables. It's pretty.

Food: Ordered the Free Range Organic Chicken. The meat fell off the bone and the accompaniment of the Yukon Gold Potatoes and the mushrooms made the meal all the more satisfying. It was one of the better prepared chicken dishes I've had. My mother ordered the ""Hong Kong Style"" Salmon, which had a nice spice to it. My sister got a special that had shrimp and pasta, but she wasn't as much of a fan of her food as we were of ours.

A definite bonus is all the complimentary stuff they give you. Aside from the delicious assortment of bread and dipping sauces (sea salt!!!!), we were given complimentary split pea puree soup, which was surprisingly tasty, and complimentary truffles for dessert. Prices are above average ($20-35ish dollars a plate), but they also have a cafe menu with cheaper options that look just as good.

Drinks: Had a mojito that tasted great, with just the right amount of mint. My mom got the martini and it was really, REALLY strong. 

Service: Our waiter (who happened to also be a sommelier!) was awesome. He was always attentive and made great conversation. He wasn't overbearing and you can tell he genuinely cared about whether or not we enjoyed our food.

He's a Celebrity Chef dinosaur now, and when you consider how far divorced its creator is from his sensational fame,  it's a bit strange that this Spago has survived in Vegas as long as it has -- whole casinos have risen and fallen during its life.

This is not true if you actually dine here.  This is _not_  a Wolfgang Puck Bistro/Express/Coffee shop, as other Strip properties (and shopping malls from Oxnard to Peoria) sometimes host.  It's an approximation of Spago, which was once one of the hottest tickets in LA.  

The food was once pioneering stuff, and so over the years Puck's many imitators have surpassed him, but it doesn't mean the food here is any less solid.  The menus are not huge, vary (somewhat) by season, and are fairly devoid of clunkers.   You may not rave about it after, some 25 years after Spago was chic, but you probably won't leave disappointed.

Like many simulated al fresco dining options in Casinos, this Spago has a dynamite location, near one of the Forum's fountains.  For that extra je ne sais quoi of kitsch value, try to wrangle the ""Showgirls"" table ""outside,"" the very site of Cristal and Nomi bonding over their shared redneck past and the fine flavor of dog food.",nfzdme1_TjrCHkQu3wV3lA,2,2,3,h82Btx-UmcuqPoV5SgZotw

- Off the Retro Menu: Had the $9 stir fried lamb lettuce cups appetizer and the $17 oven roasted salmon entree; both were excellent.  Portions were on the small size but with the free bread (5 types to choose from), I was full by the end of the meal.
- To save money I planned on not getting a drink (just their free ""ice water"") then I noticed a Bud Light was $6 but the house-made Sangria was $7, so I ordered a tasty Sangria.
- My server (Charlotte?) was attentive and so were the free bread server & ice water refiller.
- That night (11 Dec) Wolfgang Puck was there to receive praise/speeches from Caesars(?) executives & receive a key to the city/slot machines (I think that was the joke the mayor was making) from Mayor Carolyn Goodman.  He also took photos with interested patrons/diners.  Seems like a great, affable guy.

Really, Wolfgang?? Really??
There was a strand of hair in the table bread. 'Nuff said. If you would like to know what my experience with Spago was that night, read on.

My date and I were staying at Caesars and he wanted dinner so we went downstairs to the Forum Shops. He asked 2 random employees in the mall if they could pick a restaurant to have the most delicious dinner ever, here inside the Forum Shops, which restaurant would it be. Spago was a unanimous decision. 
We were promptly seated by a lovely waitress. I don't remember her name but she was Caucasian, had brown/auburn wavy hair, and wore glasses. My date told our waitress we wanted a 4 course meal and for her to pick nothing but the best for us and to keep it a secret until it is served. He paid our waitress her tip ($50) right then and there entrusting her judgement. She leaves after taking our drink orders (Bombay sapphire martini with 3 olives and a cup of coffee) and my date tells me he sure hopes our waitress knows he wants both soup and salad so I tell him he should let her know just in case. When he tells her about wanting both soup and salad, she says the soup of the day is white bean and she doesnt think we would enjoy it. Good call!! This was perhaps the highlight of my meal.
A basket of bread came out consisting of cracker thin bread with Parmesan and other herbs baked ontop, sliced raisin bread, and our favorite, focaccia w onions ontop. We finished most of the bread and asked for another basket before our appetizer of crab cakes came out from our server. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious and our waitress comes by to check up on us. She was absolutely fantastic. Our server comes by with the second basket of bread. My date and I were both enjoying the focaccia until he finds a strand of HAIR in his. He motions the server to come over and we show him the bread. At first he doesn't see it because it was still a little bit baked inside of the bread so I pull on the strand until he sees it. He told us, ""sorry, I will bring you a new basket."" At this point, we were too disgusted with not only eating more of their bread, we completely lost our appetites. My date and I tell our waitress we are ""done"" and she apologizes countless times. Her boss is there (petite and blonde) and asks our waitress if she could look at our bill. The manager decides that we don't owe them anything for our dinner. I found this notion a little insulting. We had just been disgusted by finding a strand of HAIR in the food they served us! Besides, we only had a basket of bread, crab cakes, and we didn't even finish our drinks! Our waitress gave us the $50 tip we gave her in advance apologizing at the same time. My date gave her back $25 because she deserved it and had she known, she would've handled the situation better.

I expected a lot more from a Wolfgang Puck establishment. This has got to be one of the worst dining experience I ever had. But I sure wish I could remember the name of our waitress because I'd like to give credit where credit is due.

The service was amazing! Friendly, energetic, and positive bartenders who are 110% on top of things. This makes all the difference and coupled with the fresh ingredients and quality food, make this spot a great stop for anyone.

Price will be $18-$25 range on dishes and that's pretty reasonable considering the quality and experience.

It was a very white tablecloth, fancy place, though for lunch, people dressed very casually.

We started with an array of bread, crunchy soft, different butters.  I munched on the parmesan crispy bread.  I ordered the spaghettini and added shrimp.  They bring out this huge portion of spaghetti cooked perfectly, tossed with a basil, tomato sauce that tasted it was just started that morning and cooked all day.  And I got 3 huge grilled shrimp on the side.  The pasta was so flavorful I was already thinking about what to order there the next time we're in Vegas.  

He got the Thai chicken salad.  The half portion was plenty for lunch.  Only the best chicken pieces were used.  He said it was wonderful.  It was topped with a nice ginger vinaigrette and absolutely the best value for $9 and he was full with a few pieces of bread.

This was one of the best lunches we've had in Vegas, and if you go to Spago for lunch, you are still getting the great quality you expect for dinner for a lot less.",HKxcc61WX6ZqW5Khx7NWGA,0,0,4,_jMpfFKdFivx52sWca5N4w

Luckily I was there with family so I didn't have to pay.  :P  We had a reservation for ten people, including a two-year old and a seven-month old. Spago isn't exactly where you'd plan to take kids, but we didn't have a babysitter, so they had to come with us. We ate in the dining room, not the cafe, and the space was large and loud so the kids' noise didn't disrupt other diners. It was so loud, though, that us adults couldn't really talk to each other. We were seated at a large round table that forced us to yell at each other over all the noise. I was excited to see a Vegetarian Tasting platter on the menu, which I ordered. It came with four small dishes - all very pretty - and I was 75% happy with my meal. There was one dish, some sort of couscous, that tasted exactly like salt and nothing else. I was surprised and a little disappointed that a nice place like this would release such a tasteless dish from the kitchen, but  the rest of the dishes were awesome so they made up for it. The others were an eggplant timbale, portobello carpaccio, and artichoke canneloni. 

One note - though it's not the most kid-friendly place, they did do a good job with the toddler in our party. He ordered a pizza, and they brought out a cheese pizza in the shape of Mickey Mouse! Very cute.

The service was great - very attentive wait staff and we had our water glasses refilled whenever necessary, without having to ask. My dad had told the server when we arrived that we needed to be out of there by 8pm (giving us two hours), because some of our party needed to head to the airport. The server did a great job of moving things along. 

I definitely recommend Spago, but I'd say it's better for smaller groups because of the noise level. Also, I liked that it's a nice restaurant but you don't feel like you have to get totally dolled up in your finest Vegas outfit - some people wore jeans.

The bartender was very slow to initially even speak to me when I arrived - it was not very busy just not a very attentive bartender.

The waiter we had was very attentive, actually too attentive that it because a bit annoying - in my opinion good service is not that they are asking if you need anything over and over... it's the wait staff that keeps an eye on you and can ""feel"" when you might need something and then ""poof"" they are right there when you need them.  This comes with an experienced staff which I think they lack.

5253401,2012-07-30,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Fine (but not exciting) food hampered by mediocre and inattentive service. That would be the best way to describe my dining experience at Spago this past weekend. 

We had originally intended to order their 6 course Tasting Menu ($95) so we asked the waiter to see a copy. Inexplicably he said there was no printed copy of the menu in the restaurant and he did not volunteer the information as to what was on it. When we pressed him to describe the menu to us, he mumbled in generalities and could not tell us what the individual selections were for the various courses. He also seemed annoyed that we were questioning him and was visibly relieved (for some reason) when we declined the offer of the Tasting Menu. To be fair, the dishes on offer that he could remember (courses 1 and 2) were lifted right from the informal ""lunch/cafe"" menu and could hardly be described as exciting or worth the extra cost. Unfortunately the rest of the service followed that of the waiter. The man charged with bringing bread regularly to the table did so only once (for some reason, a bread basket is served in the cafe area but not in the dinner section of the restaurant) and we twice had dishes incorrectly delivered to us that were ordered by a neighboring table. Our drinks also took more than 15 minutes to prepare which would have been understandable since it was a busy Saturday night but not when we clearly saw that the table next to us which came later got their drinks delivered immediately. Finally, for the first half of our dinner the restaurant played overly loud techno-style music which detracted from the ambiance until it was changed later to a more suitable, jazz-y soundtrack. 

After all this criticism, I should turn to the food which was quite good without being in any way extraordinary. I had the grilled octopus salad (18), the Filet Mignon (49), and the raspberry baked Alaska (10-12 and the highlight of the meal) while my companion ordered the symphony of tuna (24), the bone-in veal (45), and the key lime desert (10-12). The bone-in-veal was served with a delicious mushroom risotto which I probably would have ordered as a meal unto itself. All in all I can't fault the food but I'm inclined to think that I overpaid slightly and could probably have found a better meal at a lower price. However Spago was right next to the Coliseum theater and as we needed a post-show dinner it proved very convenient. I can't speak for the cafe menu but I did notice that the cafe section was crowded and very energetic and offered the opportunity for good people watching in the Forum shops. The cafe menu is noticeably cheaper than the dinner menu so Spago might be a good place to stop by for lunch.",IOf-UvT_gfpP1c7s3HYx3Q,0,0,3,GFfMXyy9uUc2PA1bqm08Qg

5279552,2015-10-12,8,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Still holding the original Spago as one of those seminal fine dining experiences, a family meal at lunch in 2008 at that time one of the more refined with both service and food showing the sort of quality not found near my Northwest Ohio home, it was finally on the invite of a friend that dinner was served in the Las Vegas location, a nine course and fourteen plate feast showing similarly skilled waitstaff and Chef Eric Klein to be one of the city's most under-discussed talents in the kitchen.

Admitting up front that although the ingredients served to us were of the same peerless quality as those offered to the rest of the room, it was in to a carte blanche tasting of small-plates that our table was treated with a few crafted 'a la minuit' while the majority at least bore some resemblance to the sizable appetizers and entrees offered on the proper menu.

Particularly impressed by the herbal cocktail at CUT a week prior it was with a similarly infused Indian Notion that the meal commenced, and with Klein now offering his bread at the Downtown Summerlin Farmers Market the rumors of one of the most delicious complimentary offerings in Las Vegas immediately put me on notice that a stop would soon be imminent, the fruit and nut slices as well as the cheese and mustard rolls each amongst the city's very best.

Constrained in time, at least a little, due to a concert beginning at nine it was with a slower-than-usual roll out of lighter items that the tasting got underway, a strong start of off-menu corn custard crowned in caviar alongside a particularly buttery oyster opening the palate to three seafood-centered bites to follow, a freshly shucked urchin as perfect in taste as it was in presentation while the Maine lobster salad was a little lost in all the citrus, the two ribbons of tuna paired to apples and fennel a far more dynamic and balanced pair.

No doubt benefited by working with Puck's purveyors and his own ties forged at the locals farmer's markets, course four saw Klein sent forth a beautiful heirloom tomato salad deftly tinged with acid and yet as good as the composition was its flavor was quickly supplanted in my memory by the late-season corn soup, a rich and creamy potage finding levity in light froth with topnotes tinged in onions and herbs.

Showing off a bit in the penultimate pair of savories it was with a tableside shaving of black Perigord truffles followed by the season's first from Alba that the meal marched on, the handmade gnocchi each dainty beneath smoked cheese while the semolina pudding somehow managed to outperform even the aforementioned soup, the egg yolk delivering the white truffle essence in an bold, slowly residing wave. 

At this point turning away a forth (or 8th) round of bread for fear of falling asleep at the show, a makeshift ""Surf & Turf"" duo was sent forth from the kitchen, the beef quality readily apparent in a ruby red cut of rib cap while firm yet moist halibut compared favorably to any served in Sin City, the crispy squash blossom replicating the texture of skin an innovative bit of flare.

Never shy to request additional sweets, especially with the name Kamel Guechida attached to the carte, it was to much amusement that a second table was positioned in the aisle to accommodate each of a half-dozen offerings, only my personal distaste for passionfruit denying absolute delightment as everything  from simple cookies and fruit crisp to an elegant souffle and cheesecake were perfectly executed, the orange curd infused beignets a 'best-of-the-genre' sort of dish that would have been just as good at any time of day.

****Truly the ""Grand Dame"" of reinventing Las Vegas dining from AYCE Buffets and Prime Rib Specials to what it is today, the food and service at Spago in The Forum Shops remains destination worthy under the guidance of Eric Klein, my only gripe being a bit of ingredient redundancy in terms of the use of tomatoes as well as corn, obviously both seasonally appropriate and delicious but all-told a bit too pervasive with the appearance of one or the other in more than 50% of the savories served...a first world problem to say the least.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,4,Sj2CO9lvhlA5MFfNZJvnnA

Now I know it's not fair to rate Spago 3 stars based on a limited-time menu. However, half of the items on the tasting menu was listed on the regular menu (according to its description), and if that's the case, then the overall dishes were very disappointing. 

1st course: A smoked salmon blini. The blini was topped with creme fraiche, chives and sturgeon caviar. This was one of the good-tasting dishes. The creme fraiche was tart and fresh. The generous portion of caviar was savory. The overall combination of citrus and ocean was very unique and tasty. 

2nd course: A chilled heirloom tomato gazpacho with poached gulf shrimp, drizzled with basil oil. One of my girlfriends hated the sharp taste of this dish so much that she couldn't finish it. Personally, I didn't mind the chilled soup, but it's definitely an acquired taste. You have to like the acidic flavor of raw tomatoes to enjoy it. The gulf shrimp, however, was extremely firm and sweet. That was the best part of this dish.

3rd course: A kampachi sashimi ""tiradito"". It had specs of fresno and piquillo pepper sauce, sprinkled with crispy rice. While I appreciate the freshness of the kampachi, the dish was severely lacking some type of citrus flavor. Without the tartness, it just tasted like eating raw fish dipped in Sriracha chili. 

4th course: Corn agnolotti with black trufle butter. This was by far the best course of the whole meal, and probably one of the best pastas I've ever eaten in my life. The rich corn agnolotti filling melts in your mouth right when you bite into it. The truffles added a nice touch of musky aroma to the dish. Overall, it was a great combination of sweetness, cream and earthy flavors. I'd definitely go back just to order this full size. 

Main course: Grilled prime NY steak. This was the biggest disappointment. First, the server never asked us how we wanted our steaks cooked so the steaks all came out mid-well. Second, it was extremely dry and drizzled in a sauce that resembled a less sour version of Heinz 57. I think the worse part of the dish was the shelling beans and salsa verde greens. It had no flavors other than the taste of the raw ingredients itself. I was very disappointed in the meat quality and taste of this dish, especially the sauces in both the greens and steak. 

6th course: Dessert lemon pavlova. A nice olive oil cake shell that melts into your mouth like butter. Inside was a creme fraiche ice cream that tasted slightly tart. It was very delicious with combinations of sweet and tangy flavors. 

In the end, I would say that our experience was mediocre. The restaurant itself is beautiful and located right on the busy walkway of the Forum Shops. It was fun to people watch on the patio, but that was probably the best part of the whole experience. The serving staff was attentive and courteous, however, I believe our server might've skipped a course due to us being one of the last tables in the restaurant. On the prix fixe menu, it listed mignardises (after dessert pastries) as the last course. However, we did not receive this course after dessert, but instead the check. While I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure we were short on a final course. 

Overall, will I recommend? Sure, but don't get the steak. While it won't be on the top of my list any time soon, I wouldn't mind coming back again in the future to try something else. Hopefully, I'll have a better tasting experience the second time around. If I do, I definitely wouldn't mind updating my review.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,0,0,3,J2065TZhg0QAxF5CzVfxww

Thus, i didnt know how fancy this place was. So I come in with my American Apparel sweatshirt, brown cords, and my backpack into this very modern looking place.

Luckily, they were laid back about it. I don't think there was a dress code and I didnt get any dirty looks from the staff or anything, so I actually felt pretty comfortable being there even though every one else was dressed to impress. 

Anyways, the staff was awesome and helpful. There was a choice of breads we could choose from to start, so I was already impressed. Then, I went to spread some butter on the bread and thought it tasted funny. That's because it was goat cheese!! Wow!! I'm actually a fan of goat cheese, so more points for that.

I ordered the paella without chorizo (pescatarian) and it was very, very good. It was one of the best paellas i ever had, not necessarily the most authentic, but taste-wise it was beyond good. My friend actually got the paella with chorizo and we concluded it actually tastes better without it.

That meal set me back $40, but hey it's vegas and I'm on vacation, so whatevs. I'd rather spend my money on fancy things than lose it all playing roulette. (I did lose some money in roulette. damn you circling white ball.)

Kerry was our server and she is impeccable as always. Her standard of service is top notch from the way she works the table to how personable she got with all of us. A group of 14 of us came in to dine and large parties are not easy to work, but her team worked flawlessly well together. 

The food is more than enough to satisfy even the most hungry. I came in with an empty stomach and was ready to roll on out.

On April 12, 2015, my wife, sister and brother-in-law went to Spago for lunch around 2:00 pm.  We had a good meal, paid with my charge card and left.  Upon returning home my wife's habit is to go on-line and check our accounts.  She noticed $700 purchases at Best Buy in Chicago had been charged to our account.  We called the bank and they reversed the charges (and air miles ) and arranged to have new cards sent to us.  We called my sister to tell her to watch her account.  A few days later they noticed charges in Maine appearing on their card.  We had used a charge card, they had used a debit card.  The connection to this review is that the only place they had used their debit card was at Spago.

I called Spago and was told that the managers were in a meeting and would return my call in 15 minutes.  Two hours later I re-called and got to speak to a manager.  The manager was terrific on the phone.  He communicated sincerity and concern.  I was able to tell him the time, date and section we ate in. He promised to investigate and get back to me promptly.  That conversation was over a week ago.  I have heard nothing since.

What I was thinking was, ""YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE"" and I've always wanted to eat at this fine dining restaurant, so, Spago it was!

Spago means, ""String"" in English. So, I assumed they picked the word because it sounded classy in America. But anyways, the restaurant wasn't busy at that time, so I was able to grab a seat at the patio right next to the kitchen where I can hear cursing and insults from the chefs and staff.

I was presented with a complimentary bread basket (Sourdough, Wheat, Rye, and Pretzel) with 3 different dips (Olive Oil, Butter, and Sea Salt). They tasted so delicious and I enjoyed the variety of dips with the warm fresh bread baked right from their oven. For my entree, I ordered the Shittake Mushroom Pizza, all for myself!!

My friend ate all his pizza before I got my duck. (But it did give me an excuse to steal some of his pizza yay!) The manager apologized immediately and comped whatever desert we wanted. My friend had the coconut creme brulee which was not in a cup. It was more like a slice of cake, then toasted. tasty, but not amazing. I had the PB and J beignets.

-Margherita - crust was a bit undercooked, and overall I would call this a pretty average Margherita pizza
-Proscuitto - this was the best of the 3 - the Proscuitto and Fromage blanc worked perfectly together.  With a great crust this pizza would have mind blowing potential.

I felt very unclassy :( My friend and I came back the next day for late lunch/early dinner, on the more suitably-priced-for-college-students cafe side.

-Tuna Sashimi: AMAZING. 4 bites of beautiful red tuna on top of a crispy rice cake and some magically delicious sauce that my unrefined palate cannot even begin to name. (Just looked it up, the menu says ""Wasabi-Ginger Vinaigrette"") We needed about 4 more pieces though. Each.

-Margherita wood fire pizza: Lovely thin crispy pizza. The tomatoes were fresh and sweet and the cheeses strong. We each ate 3 slices and ended up full.

-Dranks: Tangerine-something mojito for me, ginger-something for the roomie. Both strong, delicious, well-priced for Vegas standards. The mojito was very refreshing :)

Total came out to $35 per person, including tip. I would definitely recommend the cafe as a nice classy lunch/dinner stop in the middle of shopping the forums. The atmosphere was chill and we didn't have to yell to be heard. Our waiter always seemed in a rush, but had a great sense of humor (even after the roomie dropped her knife and caused him to drop and break a plate).

We did not have reservations so we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks for about 15 minutes before our table was ready. The bar tender was quick to get us our drinks and was very attentive.

We were sat outside in the mall area. The boyfriend and I are major people watchers and I guess it was prom night for some local high school. We watched countless girls no older than 17 parade around looking like whores. Needless to say we had a good amount of laughs. 

The bread basket was enough food that we didn't need to order appetizers. For two people, it was seriously bread overkill. What I did appreciate was UNSALTED butter offered with a side of coarse sea salt on the side. This is exactly what I do at home. I'm a butter snob and I refuse to touch salted butter unless there are no other available options.

I ordered the spaghettini, which was delicious. Very simple, but done the from-scratch way, therefore perfection.

My boyfriend ordered the half roasted chicken on mashed potatoes. His was very simple but also delicious. 

I love restaurants like Spago, that offer some really classic and simple dishes but made with high quality ingredients with very high standards. The potions were large as well and well priced.

After being seated in the back (opt'ed for ""fine dining"" which apparently has a different menu than those sitting up front on the patio), our server brought an iPad with drink options and the first thing he asked was if we had any time constraints. Told him that we had to make a 10:00 show (our reservation was at 8:00pm, and seated around 8:05), and he said ""oh that's not a problem"". Showed us the drink menu, and left. Came back about 10 minutes later to take a drink order, but we still didn't even have menus. Ordered drinks and eventually got a food menu which he took a very long time to explain (which was verbatim to what the menu said). I'll just say right now that he had no more than 3 tables to serve, 2 of them were only 2 people/each, and our table had 4.

Left us for another 10 or 15 minutes, before coming back. We ordered appetizers and entrees at the same time (at his recommendation to avoid any delays in the kitchen). He said that he'd be right back with some bread to munch on. About 15 minutes later, we flagged down his assistant because we'd been there for 45 minutes and had nothing to eat - his assistant immediately came back with a massive bread platter which everything was amazing on.  

Beef Tartare, Oysters and a Fig Burrata salad. All were good, but the fig salad was pretty small on the portion size. All were consumed quickly, and we had to flag the assistant down again to order some more drinks and have him bring the bread back. Looking at the time, it's 9:30 and we don't even have our entrees? Guess he didn't want us to try dessert. Our server comes over and says ""your entrees will be out shortly"". Seriously? After we reminded him that we had a place to be at, he said he would ""push the kitchen"". A few minutes later, he returned with our food. Entrees were good, although the portion size was a little light for the price. I've spent the same amount of money (or even less) at places like STK or Lavo and gotten twice the food. Didn't have a lot of time to enjoy the food, and had to flag down our server's assistant (I wish we could have tipped him, because he was about 100x more attentive to us than our actual server was) for the check. Of course, Miguel made an appearance to take our money and bring us a couple dessert bites. Literally ran through the casino to make it to our show on time.

The salad had good flavor but was very, very, very small for the price. I actually left the restaurant so hungry, I had to get food 30 minutes later. I cannot remember a time that has ever happened to me, and it was incredibly irritating given how much I had just spent for dinner.

Try the cheesy Margarita flat bread if you are hungry and don't think it will fill you up before dinner.  Boy I love bread.

I tuna for my main entree and it was cooked perfectly.  Nothing out of this world, but a fantastic meal.

I have to say it was DELICIOUS!!! The menu that is on the site is very different then what was presented at the table (I'm thinking maybe because it is summer time and menu selections change depending on the season and chef?). Speaking of Chefs, Erik (the chef that evening) came out and offered to make a special dish for a few people at our table. They ordered a fabulous medium rare meat dish that was prepared in the brick oven. It looked almost like a prime rib (without the bone). I ordered the flank steak that had a wonderful butter garlic sauce over it. Everything from the grilled fish to the pasta dish looked very appetizing! We started with the calamari appetizer, sashimi, and this other prosciutto dish that had a creamy white cheese spread, very similar to a melted mozzarella.

Valet your car at the mall, and take the elevator up and you are at the front entrance.  Convenience is a small plus compared to the always delightful menu selections.

We loaded up on some appetizers as they all sounded good.  Soup of the day was delicious, perhaps because it was loaded with cream.  My wifes salad was great too.  The crabcakes were well prepared and loaded with tasty crab.  

I got the kobe beef sliders for my kids, and they were more well done than I would have done for that quality of beef.  Pretty good none the less based on the tiny bite I was able to trade them for.

This trip I had a pizza.  Spago's style of pizza I do enjoy.  The woodfired pizza has fresh tasty ingredients and a great mix of flavors.

We ordered the Asian Chicken Salad (has a dif name but i cant think of it at the moment), the meatloaf, and 2 desserts. 
All portions were big enough to split among 2 or maybe even 3, depending on your appetite. 
The salad didn't have too much dressing and had this crunch that I always enjoy in a salad so that was a great start. 
As for the meatloaf, I normally don't even consider eating meatloaf (for personal reasons) but my aunt recommended it and I can see why. Very well balanced and probably one of the best I've had (but then again I haven't had much so...)
As for dessert, we ordered Key Lime, light yet satisfying.

I don't think I'd ever been to a ""Wolfgang Puck"" restaurant before, and I'm generally pretty cynical about anyone putting his name on multiple places in big tourist stops, but this stuff was good.  We ordered a calamari appetizer and a margherita pizza to share. Both were wonderful, with the calamari coming with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. 

Also they give you an assortment of bread before your meal comes out, and it's not just that wimpy little bread and butter crap. This was some fancy shiz. There were three different types with their own sauces, including sweet bread, with raisins or cranberry baked into it and topped with butter. Also a different type topped with olive oil, etc. Good stuff.

The pizza was delicious as well, with nice sharp cheeses and plenty to go around. The crust wasn't amazing but I was far from complaining.

Somehow we managed to get out of here for $35 bucks. 

I would give 5 stars but didnt' try enough of the dishes, and like I said the pizza wasn't exactly perfect, but seriously i doubt you could do much better at Caesars for the price.

I've been to a few Wolfgang Puck Express locations, and I never remembered a bad experience. So, you can say this was my first fine-dining excursion by the celebrity chef.

I'll skip right to the food. The complimentary amuse bouche of potato and cauliflower soup (in a teeny cup) was a nice touch to start things off. The selection of complimentary bread was great -- they provided some olive oil, salt, and pepper for dipping too.

Grilled octopus salad (4 stars) - chunks of octopus were incredibly tender. The little bit of citrus from the preserved lemon really brought out the flavors. The white bean ragout provided a nice, starchy contrast to the protein of the octopus.

New England diver sea scallops (3 stars) - three big-sized scallops that were all nicely cooked. It was topped with a foam that barely had any flavor. On the menu, it said it was a white corn-mascarpone emulsion and basil oil. The downer for this dish -- my wife ate the last scallop and it had a really awful-tasting, charred aftertaste. It was probably from the burnt part of the pan, or from reusing a dirty pan instead of a clean one. Her palette was destroyed after that one.

Red wine braised short ribs (3 stars) - nice presentation, with all of the ingredients put together. The short ribs were tender, melt-in-your-mouth, and full of flavor. Overall, I thought the flavors were a bit monotone. Plus, it desperately needed some crunchy texture in the dish. Between the ricotta gnocchi and the meat, it was sort of like eating baby food -- just really, expensive baby food.

Service was slow and indifferent throughout the night. It was apparent that they didn't place a high priority on service. For the amount of money they charge here, that's unacceptable. We told them about the bad scallop, and the manager was nice enough to take the entire scallop entree off the bill. That was almost $40. They did earn brownie points for that, but overall I don't see us returning with so many other Vegas restaurants on the bookmark list.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,8,7,3,vqKY4vdEM2lejkpx4dC8zQ

I'll just post another one. I've written 150 reviews to this point, and I've only given three 1 star reviews ever. So when I saw on my distribution graph that number went down to two, it was easy to figure out who removed one of them.

Let's just keep this short and simple:
-This was one of the top 3 worst dining experiences of my life.
-You quoted us 45 min wait time for a party of 7, and we ended up waiting 2.5 hours.
-When you finally sat us, you sat us at a circular table that was meant for two. This meant that when our food came, we let the girls crowd their plates onto the table, while the guys ate their food with their plates in their lap.
-Luckily my plate wasn't very heavy, because I ordered the ravioli, and I only got like 4 pieces of ravioli. 
-The service was horrendously slow, and they just didn't seem to care. I think the whole dining experience took around 4 hours, so basically I was getting 1 piece of ravioli an hour for my experience.
-This place wasn't cheap, and I can't figure out what I was paying for. It wasn't the service, it wasn't the food, and it wasn't the atmosphere.

Fast forward, we expected more traffic but got right in so we were pretty early, no problem though it was really slow. Let me brag on the hostess - she was super sweet and talkative coming in and when we were leaving, she's the best part about this whole experience.  

Our server got our drink and food orders after about 10 minutes, and that was about the extent of our conversations with her, she stopped by a couple times and just said ""are you doing okay"" but the server assistant got and refilled drinks and brought bread.  The extra plates were never cleared from the table until we were about to leave. 

I ordered a flat iron steak - medium - it was RARE, and covered in salt - so much so that my lips blistered up (still are the next day) and I could only eat 2 of the slices. On top of the salt was ""cracked pepper""  that wasn't really cracked, I bit into one and started choking, i'm not a wuss for heat by any means but nobody wants to bite into a pepper ball.  The salt and pepper were far too strong for a steak that has a sauce on it, I could not even taste the sauce.  

My husband said his NY strip was okay, but again tons of salt and pepper which takes from the value of the steak. His mashed potatoes looked runny. 
My daughter had the spaghettini, the sauce tasted like chef Boyardee, it was better than mine but I wouldn't order it again and highly disappointing after looking at the pictures before going.  I took the steak in a box so I can hopefully rinse the salt off and finish cooking it.   We weren't offered dessert so we left, far from full and stopped somewhere else for dessert.

The Los Angeles iteration of this restaurant is very upscale, long considered a Hollywood hotspot.  While the Las Vegas version features an upscale option, it is a little less stuffy than LA's Spago.  Being by myself, I opted to sit at the bar, which was the right move.

The bartender was fantastic: fast, friendly and serving ambrosial drinks.  I loved that the drink menu was visible on an iPad, making the convenience of selecting a drink that looked delectable a simple endeavor.  The drink itself was delicious, one of the best I had in Las Vegas and in the past few months period.  Topping that off, it was cheaper than the average mixed drink at even a casino bar, and of much higher quality.  For my meal, I ordered a Pasta Carbonara with added chicken.

Both specials were raw in the middle.  We showed the raw fish to the waiter and he asked if we wanted the kitchen to heat up our half eaten fish (?) or get us new orders.  We asked for new orders be made, then we got the half eaten fish back with fresh garnish and the plates were switched.  Who would expect a nice restaurant to do something like that AT ALL?!  The general manager discounted the bill which was appreciated, but that is not the point - four orders were all prepared incorrectly, and waiter's attitude was nonchalant.  Perhaps this restaurant is under new management but I don't think I'll be back any time soon.",fNO4FReV0b0dypxqdPGyzg,0,0,2,KLf000R4EXQssFUjkeyc-Q

went here with a friend who's very particular on what she eats (vegan) so being italian food i figured this would be a good spot. Didn't know this was owned by wolfgang but anyways im 100% carnivore. Got oysters on the half shell kumumotos i believe which where good and fresh. Next was the greek salad and margarita pizza, salad was refreshing, good amount of dressing, doesn't make the salad soggy which is key. Now the pizza was good but im not a fan of the crust, too much doe but the pizza was good very simple to mess up. Overall this place is good, maybe for a date in vegas but nothing special just another high end restaurant checked off on the list next please",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,1,0,3,iph0FkSSYB4myE9RAvhfcg

Keep in mind I generally don't write reviews unless I am really compelled to do so, hence this is only my second review on here.

Before our drive out to Vegas with about 15 friends, we contemplated on where we should eat. As you know, the strip has no shortage of restaurants and to be honest, we always go food hunting in Vegas with two notions in mind, any decent restaurant is pricey and the food is not the greatest. After all, you are in the middle of the desert, right?

A friend highly recommended Spago so we decided to give them a call and make the reservation. Upon arrival, we literally stepped one foot into the restaurant and headed straight to our seats. This wouldn't be a big deal normally but the restaurant was packed and normally you wait forever in Vegas. The table was immaculate and our servers were very quick to ask us what beverages we would like. Alcohol of course, easy on the rocks.

They bring around a bread tray for you to select from four different types of breads, all very soft and flavorful, along with a plate with four spread/dipping options. Very nice attention to detail. We ordered some appetizers to begin with, the oysters were fabulous and so was the sweet fig flat bread, wow!

Now on to the main courses. There is an entree on this menu for every palette. If you like slow cooked beef that melts in your mouth, go with the Red Wine Braised Boneless Short Rib Beef. The Filet Mignon also looked hearty and tasty. Being that it is a Wolfgang restaurant, a buddy of mine couldn't help but to order their sausage plate which he ""killed"" and cleared the plate. They also offer spaghetti and some asian fusion dishes, which I tried the bean curd noodles and they were money! 

The servers were very attentive, the food came out nice and hot, and on time. The General Manager, Michael Schwarz came by and made sure our needs were all met, in which case we did not hesitate to thank him for such a great time. He really has that place running smooth and we won't hesitate to go back or recommend this place to all of our friends. 

Thank you Michael and the crew!",7Ezo9XtIQ4jg47awWG564g,0,0,5,fzp_6BXMQOXj5Q6lGE0KWA

When I moved to Vegas, this was the first up-scale place I visited. Two and a half years later, I returned on Xmas eve with my family. Spago is consistently good with great service and even better food. 

Be aware, other than no flip flops, tank tops and mullets, there is no dress code so everyone is extremely casual. Also, it is family friendly so occasionally you get to see spoiled brats being a pain in the butt. it doesn't get too bad, thou. Dining with significant other is possible although it wouldn't be my first option for a romantic evening.  

I really don't remember my order the first time here. I just recall having a GREAT salmon with risotto. Nonetheless, last Xmas eve I had the symphony of tuna as appetizer (it is as good as it ""sounds""), and steamed salmon Hong Kong Style. For dessert I ordered the apple crumble. Everything was fantastic!

I left happy and my family -not from town- had a great Vegas experience.

I must add that Spago is not as expensive as competitors, which is definitely a plus.",2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg,2,1,5,frg6uF3fwDVk6KZLBifi7g

We had a Thai salad and a regular house salad and a fish. None of the items were even remotely boring(as per server's tip). The food was delicious. The way they make their salads makes me wanna eat salad every day. Precise cuts of vegetables with unique seasonings, herbs or sauces melt my salad heart and crunchy nuts or noodles make it want to jump. I try to deconstruct the flavors every single time, thinking I will make the same thing at home. Their textures are crunchy and delicious. The fish was soft and buttery.

Service- amazing, funny and helpful lady server, and a sweet, gallant bus boy.

I've tried many different things from their menu and never really had anything that I did not like!! 

I always start with the fried calamari. I love it!! It is delicious. The sweet chili sauce it comes with is delicious and the cucumber salad that it comes with is delicious!! Though I get it every time, there is one thing I would change about it. I would use seasoned breadcrumbs!! If the breadcrumbs they use are seasoned, you really cannot tell at all. I know the sauce is supposed to provide the flavor but the calamari just needs a little kick. 

Other items that I have tried that are very good are the black truffle fettucine, roasted organic chicken, spaghetti, chicken parm sandwich, asian chicken salad - they were all good and I would recommend any of those items!!

And my favorite thing - the olive oil that they give in addition to sea salt and butter for the bread bowl. This olive oil is amazing!! It's very potent and has an intense flavor that I can't really describe but I end up dipping my chicken in it, french fries, calamari, potatoes, i will put that olive oil on anything!!!

The ambiance of this place is average. It's considered high end dining but I find it to be extremely casual. My boyfriend goes there in a hat and sneakers and they don't mind. I like it though - great food and not a stuffy place at all. The servers are always really cool too!!",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,2,1,4,eeFITdHLpLgkxYqM-wD8MA

5935914,2011-12-19,0,LwQB9H3jZ9wTk24Lr-AnZQ,"Pricyyyyyyyy :( But the service is excellent; the waiters were around constantly making sure we were all right and that our cups were filled! I have only ever gone here for lunch, which was pretty good with decent prices, but for dinner:

Seafood appetizer special: Very pricy...there was four of everything (oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail, and a spoonful of crab salad). Not worth the $ in my opinion, but the food was indeed fresh and quite delish.

Hong Kong style salmon: Being of hong kong descent, it didn't really taste ""Hong Kong"" to me...had a weird twang from the soy sauce. Salmon was very soft and cooked just right though. Vegetables had the same weird twang, but was still edible.

Sea bass: Yum! I got mine gluten free (yes, gluten allergy sucks!) And the waiter reassured my terrified little brain that they dealt with allergies of all kinds all the time and that they would be sure to keep my gluten allergy in mind. So my meal is a bit different from the usual...it really consisted of an excellently cooked sea bass with a bunch of buttery chopped greens on the bottom. Pretty good.

Diver scallops: Came with this cool foam on top. Scallops I felt could be cooked to a more golden tone, but it was still good. I kept biting in some sand or something though.

The meals were way too pricey for the amount we got, but I guess in classier restaurants, that's just the way it is! Presentation was amazing and everything was cooked to perfection. Employees were very professional and friendly...I'd come here again, but maybe for lunch so my wallet won't implode.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,3,0,4,S27NXOSqxDcnjPlEmWfvvA

So, when Absinthe ended this past Sunday night, and we were hungry for pizza (and knowing the Trump shuttle where we were staying shows up right below Spago), we stopped in for a pizza.  We were very clear to the Hostess that that was all we wanted, and admirably we didn't feel discriminated upon for only wanting such a small Spago experience.  We were led to a table for two in the back.  I ordered a $9 Cabernet and husband ordered tea.  We agreed on a pizza which was described as such: 

ITALIAN SAUSAGE-Roasted Fennel, Tuscan Black Olives, Reggiano Cheese and Thyme 

  We were brought out a divided dish of olive oil, butter, salt and pepper.  And baskets were brought around with foccacia, sourdough and flatbread.  Nice, but one can only do so much bread, ya know?  Then came the pizza and sadly it was disappointing!  Honestly, both of us agreed that it tasted like the crust had been pre-frozen.   We got better pizza at the Wicked Spoon buffet the next day.  Toppings were nice, but the crust was very disappointing.  

  It was not bad.  But it wasn't (imho) up to what we had experienced via Wolfgang in the past.  (nobody on the planet could be a bigger fan than me of his butternut squash soup that I would (and have) killed for),

when we got there I was looking forward to the Spago experience but only then we were told that ordering off the regular menu was not possible. Thanks for letting me know then.   By that time it was too late to go elsewhere (believe me I checked) and we were hungry. 

Our waiter was very nice and informed us that the main kitchen was still turning out dishes and he asked the manager if we could order off the menus. The answer was no!  

The secondary menu and food was way way sub par!!! Had we been properly informed I would have said thank you but we will be back next time when the kitchen is open properly.

Bread was so so, never offered a bread basket just given a plate of sliced bread (after we had to ask for it), chicken was not very moist (had to watch table Next to me get their chicken from the main menu as we were waiting for our second class chicken) bass was way over cooked, vegetable salad was very good (maybe it was left over from the main kitchen).
