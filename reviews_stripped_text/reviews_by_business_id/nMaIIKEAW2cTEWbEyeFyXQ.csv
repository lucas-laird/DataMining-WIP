20827,2011-01-04,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"I love Thai food and Surang just might be the best one in Vegas!!!  I was a regular at Archi's but decided to try somewhere new and success!!!  

Tucked away in a strip mall, I'd never expect this place to be so good!!  Walking in, the boyfriend and I were immediately impressed with how delicious the place smelled.  We ordered the tom yum goon (hot and sour soup with shrimp), papaya salad, Thai beef jerky, pad kapow (minced chicken and basil), and basil fried rice.  Everything came out piping hot (which I'm really picky about).  Flavor-wise, definitely at least a 9 out of 10.  Only thing is that we wished it was spicier.  We ordered an 8 spicy (out of 10) on everything but it was medium spicy at most.  At least our mouths weren't melting off.  

We are Thai food frequents so we will definitely be coming back.  This actually might be our new regular, go to take out spot.  Horray to finding a new delicious, authentic Thai restaurant!!",EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,3,0,4,8IkxrfWEHk3XCkrdBULUag

Their spices and textures are just right. Basil chicken and satay are my favorites. My husband loves the pineapple fried rice and Panang beef. I do believe one of the chefs used to work at Archies(our 2nd fav), but this one pays more attention to the quality of the dishes. I notice there are so many good reviews, so I guess it's no longer our best kept secret! It's everybody's!

Like Alma mentioned I also prefer Surangs to Archis.  I've been coming to Surangs for almost 6 months and haven't been back to Archi's once in that time. 

The service here is always great, as soon as I sit down they know my order (maybe I sign I come here too often).  I usually get a pad thai with chicken or a spicy basil with chicken lunch special with 4 on spice and its got just the right amount of spice without taking away from the dish.  Besides the standard food you'd see at every Thai restaurant they also have a crispy pork dish which is fantastic.  It is either saute'd with zucchini or chinese broccoli.  I'd highly recommend the crispy pork and this restaurant to anyone in the mood for Thai food!!!",NzqJBFA6QdOKBv1dIkTLDA,0,0,5,7rDfmgoB46oKIpcLayUWbA

165397,2010-12-06,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"When we pulled into the shopping strip Surang's was located in, it was dark and I felt like we were heading into a trap from a horror movie. And then I saw the open sign which made me feel a lot safer. It is located in a small venue, which had a very clean, simple and relaxing atmosphere.

We started with some appetizers and I would recommend getting the shrimp cakes, these things were so good I was tempted to just order that all night.

There were four of us and we ordered a Beef Panang (level 8 spiciness), chicken pad see-ew (no spiciness), basil crispy pork and chicken/beef pad Thai (level 8 spiciness).

I'll start off by saying the curry and rice were the best together, the curry was spicy and it had a sweet tinge to it. The beef was soft and easily chewable. I just wish the green beans served would have been softer, I feel like they were undercooked. Other than that, the dish was excellent and highly recommended.

The pork was decent, reminded me of filipino liempo but the skin was sometimes unchewable. It was my first time having it so maybe it'd be worth another try.

The pad see ew was the spiciest, I could tell my nose was starting to feel it and it took two plates of pad thai to take away the burning sensation. I'd recommend going lower if you're not a fan of spice.

The pad thai was excellent and I'd recommend getting it. This is probably one of the stable Thai food all around, it never fails anywhere you go. In my opinion, the beef/chicken mix is great with any of these dishes.

Next time I go here, I'd order the shrimp cakes, pad thai and curry. That right there would be an excellent meal for lunch or dinner.

The service was good and very tentative. It may have not been so busy but you get better service when tables in restaurants aren't full. They also offer take out, which is a definite plus for when you're in a hurry or want to eat at home.

Altogether, I'd take family or friends here. It's a great place to fill up your stomach and fill that Thai craving we all seem to have.",XyDLSwfbkySPxLFoszyvpA,1,2,5,nBxV9Vaw_ffNkqODD1xmWw

Cute little place in a non-descript strip mall. Have not dined-in yet, have  only done take-out (now multiple times).  But take-out service has consistently been superb. Stated wait time has never been longer than 10 minutes and food has always been ready by the time I've arrived. 

Have only had the pad thai chicken, but I think it's the best I've had in Vegas so far (over Archi's, Thai Noodle Kitchen, Panna Thai, and Pin Kaow). The spiciness level is a little higher than my baseline - I always get a zero (on 1 to 10 scale) and it was still a little spicy. My husband got a 2 and found it too much for him to fully enjoy.

The first time we went there, he had 5 spicy, but he now orders 10 spicy, adding extra jalapenos & red chili pepper flakes they offer.  His eyes are red and watery while he's eating, but they usually are back to normal by the time we get back to our car LOL.  All lunch specials come with a won ton, a spring roll and green salad with a nice dressing.  Yummy.

One great thing is that they ask you to define your hot/spicy level from 1-10 so that it allows customers the ability to choose how hot they want their food, as Thai food can get very spicy.  The portions are extra generous and it is a great buy (and tasty too) for a quick lunch.

While ordering, I asked if my address was in their free delivery range. I was assured that it was (and it is). My bill, upon delivery, however, was $22.00! Now, I know it's ""just"" a few dollars, but I found it kind of shady ($9.95+7.95+tax does not equal a round $22.00). At least tell me you're tacking on the delivery fee when I'm ordering! 

The food, however, was fantastic, so I'm not totally turned off. The Chinese broccoli and crispy pork is my new, favorite Surang's dish. Sooo good and flavorful. But, if you like it hot, I'd suggest ordering at least a nine or ten. I ordered an eight and barely felt a sting.

Ok. I have been to many Thai restaurants in Vegas and so far Surang's Thai Kitchen became top of the list. I am even more happy that this is right down the street from me - Score! They even deliver!! 

I was thinking what would be good for dinner for the familia and I. 
I did not dine in. Ordered to go - that way I can eat in my pj's! (: 
Ambiance was small and cozy. The staff were sweet and friendly. 
I skimmed through the prices to see how much they are going to rob me for some din din. Surprisingly, there prices are reasonable! Everything on the menu was nothing more than $10. Double score! 

I ordered the Beef Pad See-Ew and Spicy Basil (chicken) and they asked me HOW SPICY?? I told them that I've been to other Thai places and would do #10 because theirs wasn't that spicy. She then looks at me like I'm crazy. They asked me again with this look ""so 10?"" I hesitated, thinking maybe this place is no joke. So i went for an 8. OHHH MYYY GAHHH!!! I am so glad I did not say 10. LOL. My mouth was on fiyyaaahh!! But it was sooo gooood!!! so flavorful!!! so..so...Surangy!!!?! haha I just made that up.

Hubby picked up take out from this place. Still havent found a good Thai place in Vegas and I'm skeptical every time I try a new spot so we always start off with the basic dishes.
He ordered the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew. I mean you could never go wrong with the two, at least that's what I've always thought until now.
The two dishes were unpleasant and annoying to taste each bite. My 10 year old son even said he can probably make it better.  They were both dry and lacked flavor. The pad thai tasted off.  The pad see ew was just oily and yuuckk. 
Sorry to even have to write this.  What's even more annoying is the service. They charge a $1 fee for any credit card charges under $15. LMFAO! How ridiculous is that?! They don't make money on their service so they have to find other means to make money of their paying customers. I'm surprise their bathroom doesn't have a coin deposit.  
So my husband asks for some peanut sauce and the lady wants to charge him $1 for a half filled 8 oz container. Do the math. Poor management. Then again it's Vegas! Where can you find decent service and yummy food off the strip?

I'll begin by stating that I've never been at all disappointed with the quality of food.  Always fresh ingredients and tasty dishes.  In fact, I had planned on giving them a 4 star review several times now, but never got around to it.

Unfortunately, that extra star fell off today.  Our regular lunch party of 4 was in attendance, and we all love Thai food.  Each of us ordered something different from the menu, and all 4 meals, although not all lunch specials, were accompanied by a complementary cup of soup.  The broth was lukewarm, and the centers of the tofu pieces were still cold.  Not very appetizing.

The meals came...and I can't understand why in some restaurants the cooks can't plate the meals to be delivered together.  2 of the dishes came out a good 5 minutes before the other 2.  Thankfully, we're all casual enough to discard table mannerisms and begin eating before everyone is served.  This may have been awkward in a business luncheon or dinner with other acquaintances.

The 3 who ordered lunch specials all commented on how the food was fine, but the plates were ice cold, which cooled the dish down significantly before they were 1/2 way through.  I ordered larb salad, which was delicious, but the ground meat was also barely warm.  As if they cooked it, then used refrigerated sauce.  I know it's not supposed to be a hot dish, but the contrast in temperatures between the ground seasoned meat and sauce, vs. the cold crisp lettuce or cabbage, makes the dish so much more enjoyable.  Again, tasty, but leaving me someone dissatisfied.

Overall, service was as expected, flavors were above average, but little things like timing and temperature deducted from the score.  There are at least 3 other Thai restaurants within the mile or 2 radius that get that extra star, and likely our future business.",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,0,0,3,hoEYOJLCGWS4NAumC4RWhg

About the hair. it happens, I get it. However, the ""handling"" (or lack there of) was not great. They removed the soup right away and brought another soup. They did not take anything off his bill, or send the manager over to apologize, nada. So I didn't feel that was a superb way to handle it.

I enjoyed my Chicken Tom Kah soup, although a bit too much lemongrass which caused the soup to be a bit sour and unbalanced.

To start, service was SLOW and there was only 1 other family dining. I asked for peanut sauce with my egg roll. I was given plum sauce and the woman said they were out of peanut sauce. 5 minutes later, our chicken satay arrives and guess what... low and behold, there was peanut sauce... I stated, I thought you were out of peanut sauce. I caught her off guard and she came back with ""this was the last of the peanut sauce."" Maybe they were but I found it odd. 

Ok then for my wife's bowl of chicken soup. There was cleaning agent on the rim of the bowl. So at least they are cleaning the dishes, just not rinsing it.

Bottom line, eat at your own risk. I would rather eat at Thai Noodle house 2 or Panni. Great and friendly staff at Noodle House 2 and great peanut sauce at Panni.

2118784,2011-07-05,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"It's been almost a year since I found this a gem during my last trip to Vegas. On my last trip in August of last year I relied on Yelp to help me find a great Thai restaurant here in Vegas. As usual, Yelp did not let me down. If you are a frequent Yelper you know that it is rare to find a restaurant with a 4.5 star rating with a significant number of reviews. As soon as I saw that Surang's managed to accomplish this rare feat I knew I was in for a great meal. Surang's is  a good distance from the strip but it is definitely worth the drive. It seems to be in a decent part of town also, so no need to worry about your safety while roaming away from the strip. 

We ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Yellow Chicken Curry (my absolute favorite Thai dish), Orange Chicken, Broccoli Chicken,and Spring Rolls. Every single item was great. We loved the food and ate until we were all stuffed. The owners and servers were very nice and it appears to be a family run operation which is a plus to me. The place was very modern and very clean as well. Not really a fancy place and it is more suited for a family meal than a romantic dinner. It wasn't the cheapest Thai restaurant I have been to and it wasn't the most expensive either. I think it is fairly priced and a great value when you factor in the quality of the meal. 

So you may be wondering what took me so long to write a review. Well i am back in Vegas and had to look up the location of this place so we can go later today. I figured since I was back on the page and enjoyed the food so much that I owed Surang a review. Since it has been a year, I promise to come back with an update to confirm if this place is holding the quality that I expect.",4Cxej6j5OZYWzlKPY0x0mQ,2,0,5,1Qh3NCo8WXr7KbREfbb2ug

Our waitress was very friendly, but lacked a bit on the service. She was the only one there and there was another big party that had arrived a few minutes before us. So, I gave her some slack. But, maybe the establishment should ensure having more than one waitress around, especially during dinner time. 

I had the curry fried rice, something I hadn't tried before. I liked it as it was flavorful and had lots of the chicken in it. Most places I get fried rice, only have small bits and pieces of meat here and there. The rest of the table ordered Beef Pad See Ewe and Pineapple curry. Both were good. The pad see ewe wasn't at all oily, a problem I run into at other restaurants. The flavor of the curry was good as well, but I was a bit disappointed as the only thing that made it a pineapple curry was a handful of pineapple fruit tossed it. But, the actually curry itself was great, so no biggie. 

It's a small place, so it might not be great for big parties. But a great place for a small gathering. I'm definitely looking forward to trying out their lunch specials.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,3,1,5,3Hr_MdCAG_fwmNIgOPO7yA

2333583,2011-08-26,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"Yummy. There is no better way to end a record hot Vegas day then eating some good spicy Thai curry. It's a nice place to eat, not fancy but clean and a good environment, playing some California dreaming. 

Ordered a few dishes one to eat there and a couple to go. First up Panang Curry with pork at level 5 spiciness medium heat. Really tasty dish only thing i didn't like about it was the green beans weren't cooked enough. Picked out and ate all of the green beans first and enjoyed the rest. The sauce thick, creamy, and full of the right amount of heat for me. $7.95 

The Masaman Curry with chicken was next. The sauce wasn't as thick as the Panang Curry and maybe a bit too watery for me, but there was no under cooked green beans to pick out. Everything about this dish was delightful to me except that I was already full and just sampling the rest. $7.95 

The Basil Crispy Pork was last. Really liked the crispy pork pieces, fatty and tender meat with crunchy skin. The sauce was also tasty. $9.95 

Their lunch special is a pretty good deal. Starting at $6.95 they have 12 different dishes from pad Thai to curry or noodles, each served with soup, fried egg roll, and fried wonton. 

Drinks aren't refillable except for the regular ice tea @ $1.50. There's other flavored ice teas or Thai iced coffee for $2.50-$3.00. 

My server was real nice and friendly and was always checking on me, not too much to be bothering, but enough to feel welcomed and important. I was glad that she brought me a peppermint candy at the end because my mouth was heating up.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,0,0,4,XH1q-MY1MU9ytN1O_nSNJQ

The cashier/hostess/waitress had a very bad attitude & I was simply doing takeout. I shook it off & decided to try it again but dine in. I had the panang curry. Two things wrong with this: 1st she brought out a bowl of rice for the entire table to share, strike one. 2nd she brought the curry out on a plate so I had to scrape the little that I did have onto my shared portion of rice. On top of that the same hostess was walking around with the same stank attitude. Clearly, it's time for her to find another job. Oh & the curry was maybe a 5 at best.

2594045,2010-10-10,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"I had to work work Saturday this weekend (don't get into IT), so I thought we'd try a new Thai place.  Surang's is small, but well lit and inviting.  We ordered the crab rangoon, tom kha (kai), red curry with beef, mixed vegetables with pork.

The Thai tea was huge, but lots if crushed ice.  Quite deceiving!  I needed a refill though because it was good.  It was lightly sweet and creamy, slightly watery, but that made it a little less filling and refreshing.

The crab rangoon was good, but I have had better.  There was lots of filling, and a lot of it was imitation crab, combined with the usual cream cheese, which made it unique.  The sweet and sour was pretty good.  The only complaint I had was that the shell was a little thin, giving it a ""candy"" sort of taste.  I prefer a thicker shell.

The red curry with beef was a little disappointing.  It was watery, which I prefer, but the taste was also a little bit watery.  We ordered it medium, which was a perfect heat level, but the flavor could have been a little more bold.  The cool thing was that the waitress wanted our feedback, and when I told her this, she said thank you, and next time they can make it better.

The mixed veggies with pork were a little bland as far as the sauce went, but the veggies were nice and fresh.  With a little chili powder on it, it really wasn't bad.  The pork was extremely well prepared; not at all greasy or salty, and very tender.  This was a nice side to the curry.  

The tom kha kai was pretty decent.  There were a lot of spices and herbs, and nice mushrooms.  It also could have been a little more sour, and a little creamier, but I did enjoy it the most out of our meal.  I would recommend trying it.  

Overall I enjoyed my visit to Surang's.  I think they do a good job trying to stay authentic.  They could use a bit more boldness in their food, in my opinion, but perhaps it is just right for the average customer.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,1,0,3,VzxWJexH-gtuMykpXL1EMg

There weren't any customers in the restaurant, but that's probably because we got there the second they opened. The place is very clean and nicely decorated.  We were told to sit wherever we want, which is always nice. 

Since we had to spend $35 in order for our certificate to be valid, we splurged and ordered Thai Tea, Thai Coffee, Garlic Pepper Beef, Combination pad thai, panang curry, and thai egg rolls just for the two of us. 

Everything came right away. The drinks tasted as they should, the egg rolls were tasty with the plum sauce, the garlic pepper beef was savory and had a very nice presentation surrounded by the broccoli. The panang curry was delish, I kept pouring it over my rice and pad thai! The pad thai was BOMB of course. I don't usually get combo pad thai since it's like 2 bucks more, so boy was it a treat!

It's a small little joint, probably fits about 40 people? Or maybe less. I don't know. It's just a small, cozy little joint. Doesn't get packed but there is always people there. 

The service was excellent. Waitress was on point. Making sure to tend to our needs and always will a smile on her face.

Food was delightful. It made me so DELIGHTED. Because again, the food was delightful. Had the usual thai fare on there but there was one dish on there I had to try that I had never recognized before: CATFISH DELIGHT. And my first bite into this dish, I was truly delighted. (ENOUGH WITH THE DELIGHTS) Imagine morsels of catfish fillets fried and covered with a red curry paste accented with basil. The fillets didn't lose it's crunch.. A bit of it was taken away from the paste but there was the ever so slight crunch that made this dish perfect for me!!

The curry was typical to other thai curries I had but the Pad See Ew was bomb-tastic. We ordered extra egg on it, such a wise decision friends. They cooked the egg in water (like in egg drop soup) and sprinkled it on top of the perfectly cooked rice noodles. SO ONO! 

I heard they have amazing lunch specials. So try those for me folks, and let me know how it goes. If it's anything like my dinner experience, then the lunch specials will be top notch!",SiC0D4xwdaSSE-BPobASog,3,2,4,oixKvA6HIhB9RV2neoHR-A

I had a quick look at the lunch menu and at the very top, Pad Thai, listing its ingredients and right there first on the list was tamarind juice -- an ingredient missing a lot of times I think from the many of the so-called Pad Thai dishes here in Las Vegas. I just had to try it.

This place is very cute and small hole in the wall. The plaza that it is in i would have never thought that there was a resteraunt. 
The cashier/server was super friendly and welcoming and they had really soothing cover songs playing by a certain artist. 

I got a PAD THAI here which is one of my favorite dishes for a Thai place. It was good but was a little dry and i ordered a level 9 and it really didn't seem very spicy at all

Also ordered some sticky rice and it was not very good at all.... it was not very sticky and more on the dried out side...

One thing I loveee about this place is that they have AWSOME THAI TEA!! and they have the pickled SERRANO THAI CHILI which totally helped the pad thai reach a certain level of spice for me.

What can I say? The service and food is consistent between dine in and take out!  I have a few friends that live literally down the street from Surang's and they talk about how good the other place down the street is good.

I was a bit hungry and I wanted to get a taste of Surang's so I naturally headed down to to order out some Yellow Curry with Chicken.

It took about five minutes for my three orders of Yellow Curry with Chicken to come out.  In the mean time, even though I was sitting down waiting for the order, they still brought us out water, which I thought was very nice.

I got back to my friends and it the food did not disappoint.  It was delicious!

We did a pick up since it was so close by to the pad. Ordered over the phone. Guy was nice.

Ordered panang chicken really mild. Don't like it to hot. It was really good. Beef Pad see ew was good but it wasn't like wow to me. It needed more sauce mixture. And last is Chinese broccoli with crispy pork. It was OK not how like LA makes their crispy pork. It didn't have the skin. It seemed just like a big thick bacon.  It's not bad here. They also deliver with a $15. Minimum

They have now raised their price significantly and their yellow curry with chicken is now over $10.  What do you get?  Only about 5-6 pieces of chicken meat and 3 pieces of potato.  The rest is just liquid curry.  I expected the curry to be thicker with some substance to it, but it wasn't.  It was like watered down curry. Not at all what it should be like. It wasn't until I was about to throw away the styrofoam container that it came in that I saw that the container had deteriorated.  I think the curry sauce or liquid was actually eating away at the container.  They use very cheap containers and now I remember why I stopped coming here.  The curry I ordered last time was funny tasting because of the same issue.  The container had melted away into the curry sauce.  I remember bringing this issue up with them last time and obviously nothing was done about it.  NOT GOOD!!

I have to agree with everything she has written.  The Tom Kha Soup was indeed creamy and full of flavor.  I can taste the combination of the lemon grass, cilantro, kaffir lime leaves in every sip.  From a scale of 1-10 spiciness, I chose 6.  This heat greatly intensify the soup.

We had an order of spring rolls with tamarind sauce that was excellent.  My wife had the Spicy Basil with ground chicken and I had the Pad Prik King with chicken.  Her spiciness was 0 and mine was 6.  Both dishes were very tasty.

A note on their spiciness--I think their 6 is more a 7 or 8 at other Thai restaurants so choose the number with care.  I didn't need any more spice even though I usually order a level of 8 at other places.

I had the Thai coffee which I liked a lot.  The only thing that detracted from dinner was that the dishes were a bit heavy with salt.  That's unusual for me to say, because I am a serial salter.

Service was excellent!  The waitress was very helpful, cheerful, and she was a pleasure to talk with.  She gave us coupons for a return visit just in case we didn't get another Restaurant.com certificate.  

While it is out of the way for us, I won't hesitate to return and I'm going to suggest our hiking group stop there for lunch the next time we decide to treat ourselves.  The lunch specials are priced well and sound great!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,2,4,Ya9dT_ctWhOBJD4Ny3xqGQ

1 star = for the quick service.   All of the plates came less than 10 minutes after ordering.

2 stars = for the cleanliness of the place.  I wasn't afraid to eat off their plates, and in their clean environment.  People don't normally Yelp about this, but this place was clean man!

3 stars = for the Pad See Ew, best I have ever tasted; they are not shady with the Chinese broccoli so it made it all the better!  and the amount of egg, generous!

4 stars = Catfish delight.   Catfish isn't for the luxurious type, but i love fish and all kinds, and it's the best I've ever tasted at any Thai restaurant in Vegas

5 stars = for the combination seafood green curry.  Like, what other Thai restaurant has this option? No where else!

It's down the street from us, in a not-so-busy strip mall so parking hasn't been a hassle on each of our visits. She's a smaller restaurant, not what I expected. I noticed a lot of people coming in for take-out. 

THE EATS: Papaya Salad, Basil with ground chicken and Tom Yum with Shrimp. I mean, it's really hard to mess these up and unfortunately I have been to places where they have messed it up, but this place had these dishes spot on. I also like the fact that they do not bring out the soup in one of those fire bowls LOL, I always feel like my accident prone self will light my hair on fire or something silly as such.

Their lunch specials are pretty good, $6.95-$7.95 and the portions are pretty big for what you pay for.

Prices are a little cheaper than Basil 'n' Thyme and considering that Surang's is closer to us, looks like we've got a new Thai restaurant to add to our favorites list!",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,2,1,4,-U85strfqgU7S4WypJl_FQ

4669010,2016-10-18,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"I ordered Surang for delivery via UberEAts. Surang's is one of the few Thai places that delivers to me so I was excited to try something new.  We ordered the fresh spring rolls, a noodle dish (Pad Kee Mow), and country curry (the one without the coconut milk).

The food was dropped off in a relatively timely manner, even though the delivery driver got lost on the way here. (Of course, that has nothing to do with the restaurant since we ordered through UberEats.)  Here's how everything stacked up:

Fresh spring rolls: 1 out of 5.  They wrapped them in saran wrap, which made the rice paper slimy and sticky.  The contents slid right out when you tried to bite into it.  Also, some ingredients were warm, which messed up the texture of the cold ingredients.

Pad kee mow: 4 out of 5. The dish wasn't overly oily, and there was no aftermath, so that's a good sign.  Flavor was good, not mind-blowing. 

Country curry: 3?? out of 5. I don't know. There wasn't a ton of flavor and it was more soupy than the country curries I've had in the past.  

The rice was excellent though - 5 out 5. 

The weird thing was that when you ordered, they never asked how spicy you want the food. I don't know if that's an issue with UberEats or this restaurant, but I'd have loved to have the option for spicier food.",ABrS2sgtZA1hSH3YTmNFPA,1,1,3,YAFdmubpYBk6fcI0c40Dgg

I used to come here on a regular basis five and plus years ago. I stopped coming here because they were lacking the consistency. I came in couple days out of convenience. Here's what I've tried. 

Pad kee mao (5/5): this was one of my favorite item from this place and still is! This rice noodle dish seems to be very easy to made, but many Thai places in town can't get the flavor right. 

Tom yum noodle soup (3/5): a decent noodle soup with ground pork, fish balls and tofu. I wish it's more sour though. 

Thai beef salad (1/5): I have gotten this before and it was decent in my memory. I had to send it back to the kitchen because the beef was very tough and didn't even taste like beef. It was not edible at all.

Chicken tom yum - this was nice since it was cold outside! The base tamarind, lemongrass and keffir was bold which I appreciated. I don't like mild tom yums so this was happy indeed. 

Crispy pancake w/ mussels - I've never had a Thai pancake but love all forms of savory. The batter that holds it is chewy in like a mochi like texture and the outside is crispy and eggy. It's served with a sweet and sour type sauce which was good with it. 

Country curry with tofu - I've never had country curry and neither did they so we figured why not? It wasn't like any curry with sauce, it was a broth. It was plentiful with veggies and tofu but this dish wasn't memorable at all. We also already have a soup and it felt like we had two and this curry broth/sauce wasn't very strong at all. Pass on this. 

Crispy pork - oh noms! I love crispy pork and the garlicky sauce is great with it and zucchini slices. It's thin sliced and then fried so all the surface is crispy. It's great for fans of crispy pata, chicaron, or any other crispy pork bits. I like a tiny bit with vinegared chilis which kicks it up for me. 

Service was quiet, but decent and filled out waters and our hot tea. 

It's pretty obvious I love Thai food and am not normally in this area, but have been meaning to try it. I think it's rather solid and would say to give it a try.

First, the service and atmosphere are thairrific. The waitress who greeted and served me was smiling with laughter in her voice from the moment I entered. Plus, the restaurant is new and clean.

I went with the red curry lunch special, which includes soup, a fried spring roll, and a fried wonton. At many places, the lunch special soup is a flavorless concoction that includes snow peas, but here it was a cucumber chicken soup, a clear broth with a savory flavor. I slurped it up. The curry was complex, good enough to drink filled with fresh veggies. It was a thin curry. (I used to prefer a thicker curry, but now I think a thin curry is better for you and retains more of the flavors.) 

Everything came out piping hot and looked like it was prepared with love. Even the spring roll appeared homemade with layers of flakiness and a scrumptious veggie filling. I don't usually eat an entire roll, but I definitely finished this one. If it were closer, Surang's would definitely make my regular rotation.

5372699,2013-01-18,0,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"The Yelp party never stops. A long day of drinking and rocking out at a UYE left a few of us stragglers to fend for ourselves. 8 hours after leaving brunch, we were finally sober and starving. Some of our first choices were closed and this area of town boasts a large selection of Thai restaurants.

Anthony M. had suggested trying this place, so Jade W. and I filed suit. In Yelp fashion, we got a selection to share, took pictures of it all, and made mental notes on it all.

Chicken Tom Yum: Possesses a strong tamarin flavor. It was what we all needed on a cold day.

Mussels Crispy Pancake: I won't compare it to a Korean pancake, but it has its similarity. The edges are browned to perfection. The dipping sauce adds so many dimensions to the dish.

Country Curry with Tofu: My least favorite dish. It is not like any curry I have ever had. It is more loose and had the consistency closer to a soup or broth. The vegetable components within were nice, but I could have passed on this.

Crispy Pork: That was everything it had promised to be. Every open surface of the meat was seared to perfection. It did not matter how long it was sitting in the sauce, it was going to stay crispy. It reminded me of Korean pork belly or crispy patas. I would order it again in a heartbeat. Just hoping my heartbeat doesn't stop from how much I would consume.

5390396,2012-12-08,1,nMaIIKEAW2cTEWbEyeFyXQ,"Very nice first showing for Surang's.  It's a little far for me to go to from home or work, but I was in the area getting a haircut and didn't hesitate to add another Thai restaurant review to my rapidly expanding ""Thai so good you'll Chrai"" list.  

To be honest I've been a little disappointed in branching out to try new Thai joints lately, so maybe as a result of lowered expectations I was very pleased with their offerings.  I ordered my usual, a Basil Lunch Special with Chicken, spiced at level 7.  I was early showing up to pick it up but it didn't take long to get my food.  The restaurant itself seemed nice inside, though I wasn't a fan of the layout as there are some tables on either side of the front of the counter where I paid.  I felt like I was invading someone's private space while I waited.  Service was very friendly and I was in and out in about 4 minutes.

Getting back to the office the first think I noticed which was a change from the norm was instead of coming with an egg-roll it had one of those triangular wonton things.  Yes I was embarrassed even typing that as I don't know their proper name.  It also had a crab rangoon!  The ! is because I've never seen a lunch special that included one, and given that I really shouldn't eat cream cheese with my lactose intolerance, I threw caution to the wind and enjoyed every bite of it.  The Chicken Basil itself was also very good.  It was of the ground up variety, and it was ground up very well.  Anyone who has followed my Thai reviews knows I don't like it when it's only semi ground up, or when there are fatty pieces, so seeing a finely ground version brings a smile to my face.   It actually was very reminiscent of Archi's version, which is a good thing in my book.  If anything I might give it the slightest of edges because it seemed less oily.  The spice level I thought was nearly perfect.  If anything it might not have been spicy enough for my liking of a 7, but it was close.

They do offer brown rice for $1 I believe, but naturally I completely forgot to order it so I ended up with normal sticky white rice.  

When all is said and done I thoroughly enjoyed Surang's, and I'm sure I'll end up there again during a future haircut (knock on wood that I still have hair for the foreseeable future)",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,0,4,gw2DSHDxuwYharJfoY1BqA

As with most asian menus, I let my husband select and the choices he made were excellent.  We started off with chicken curry , spicy eggplant and tofu, beef massaman and pad thai noodles.  I will say, the curry was a little watery, but had good coconut flavor, the eggplant was spot on and the beef was hardy.  The pad thai was good for me, but my partner thought it to be too sweat.

It's seems that ""Mama"" was in the kitchen doing the cooking, I don't know for sure this was mama but it was an elderly women, and while we ate, I kept hearing birds chirping, I guess that's part of the atmosphere.

The wifey ordered the Pad Kee Mow (beef) and it was excellent and the same as always. I ordered the red curry with beef and I got home to find the curry container half empty. I thought if it had plenty of veggies and beef that I wouldn't sweat it and we'd call it a day. However, there were about 3 tiny pieces of beef in my 1/2 order of curry and I wasn't pleased.

I called the restaurant to explain the problem and was told that they measured everything out and it was the correct amount. After telling them I'd ordered it at least 20 times before and it wasn't correct she insisted it was. Well, I guess we'll be headed back down the street to Panna Thai from now on.

Here's a big hint for the owners of restaurants. When a repeat customer calls and complains about an easily resolved issue you might want to try to make them happy otherwise they go to the competition which is what we'll be doing from now on.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,2,2,2,YP0IUKHMgAw5FPun2pFzdA

Eek. With that said, if there's something that keeps us going to a business to the point where they know one of our names...there's certainly something yummy worth going. Considering the options in that area, they're a pretty solid and authentic Thai restaurant. 

I ALWAYS order a Pad Prik Pow. Too lazy to explain but if you head to their website, you can browse their menu. When they ask you how spicy, make sure you lowball a bit because a spicy level of 6 could easily be a spicy level of 8 in comparison to other places. BUT! I'm not a super duper spicy eating pro, so you don't have to completely take my word for it. 

It is always clean in there, service is prompt, never neglected, or yawning waiting for the tab. It's not a big dining area so getting up to pay isn't difficult to do in the event you have such luck. Their price is pretty fair and comparable to other like establishments and worthed. 

In fairness, we haven't been there in awhile so if things have changed, whoops. However, I have had pad Prik pow at other Thai establishments and nothing has compared to the one at Surangs. Dang, I think we are due. 

Anyway, definitely recommend! You don't have to cross the desert for it, but if you are in the vicinity with Thai on the tastebuds or feel like going on a drive for Thai...this may be your spot. Kid friendly and a stroller can fit its way in there if you must.

Called in our lunch order and they were really friendly over the phone and made sure what spicy level we wanted our food. About 15 minutes later, we went to pick it up. When we got there, the food was already bagged and ready to go. 

I ordered the mixed vegetables meal (the dinner portion, not the lunch special. Lunch special comes with stuff that I can't/don't eat and menu states ""No Substitutions"") with chicken and requested a level 5 spiciness. So we get back to the office and I open my meal. The veggies and chicken looked great and the side of rice they gave me was HUGE. But, the rice was hard. Not all of it, but a large portion of it was hard. The dish itself was good. It was spicy but it was almost as if it was spiced just for the sake of being spiced, because I think if I hadn't asked for a level 5 of spicy, it'd be bland as h3ll. 

One of my coworkers ordered the yellow curry, which was super watery rather than the thicker curry both her and I are used to.

The service is a whole other five star worthy experience. The staff is always very friendly, and they recognize me every time I come in! The owner is so sweet, and I commend her for being a knowledgeable businesswoman. 

An added bonus is their Thai tea. They consistently make it perfect! Not too much creamer. I've been to a couple of places and have found that their Thai teas always either have too much or not close to enough creamer.

Now, the problem lies in the fact that our usual place, Ping Pong is too far south, so we had to make a hard decision and figure out where we could order delivery.  After much deliberation, we settled on Surang's Thai, and let me tell you, it was the best choice!!  I think I may have found a new fav!!

So this is what we ordered:

Shrimp rolls
Tom Yum (shrimp version, spicy level 3/4, plenty spicy too!)
Chicken Panang (spicy level 5, mouth watering hot, but good!)
Chicken Pad Thai (spicy level 3, a little bland, but pretty tasty otherwise)

We devoured the shrimp rolls, which weren't oily, hate that(!),  and I ended up stealing a bit of his Panang, while I refused to share my yummy Tom Yum.  The Tom Yum was not  too sweet, nor too sour, it was a perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and sour and there were plenty of shrimps, and not chewy at all.  The head chef I met in Phuket (Thailand) told me that when a soup tastes a bit too sweet or sour and is chilled, it means it's not fresh, so I can always tell when Tom Yum has been sitting out for a while and then reheated. The curry was a little too spicy for me, but when mixed with rice, it toned down, and the hubby was thrilled the chicken wasn't drowning in sauce.  The Pad Thai was saved for the next day as the soup was filling especially after mixing with a bit of rice.  The delivery was quick as well, which meant all the food was still pretty warm, and the soup was actually a bit hot as well.  Winning!",N7IW50jr40YocM-Z55hvFQ,0,0,5,FPZ8nqc7uKmPS92s1sQZaA

After my disappointing visit to Benjarong, I gave up my quest for a great Thai restaurant within a 2 mile radius of my neighborhood. But literally a few days later, driving home from work famished, I noticed this unusually placed restaurant with a bright neon red sign as I was driving by. I almost shrugged it off, until I realized I didn't register the word ""Thai Kitchen"". I immediately crossed two lanes and busted a biznatch. 

When I went in, there was only a single party of two in the middle of their dinner. I took a peek and the food looked and smelled good. The waitress/host quickly and cheerfully greeted me and provided me with a menu after I told her I was taking-out. She was very genuine and even asked me if I needed anything to drink while I was waiting. 

Got home. W-o-w. I haven't had such a fine tasting Styrofoam-plated meal in my life. Everything I ordered (Which I'll list below, because I've been to this place about 5-6 times after my initial visit) was piping hot, vibrantly flavorful and most importantly, satisfyingly spicy. Which, on second thought, might be sweat-inducing for most other people. I usually get a 10.. hey, I was raised on Kimchi and Sriracha sauce.

Must-haves: Beef Pad Kapow (Spicy Basil Dish), Chicken Pad Thai, Pork Pad Kea Mow, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang Curry

Overall, this is a ""cute"" little place, that serves excellent Thai food, amongst the best I've had, at a reasonable price and served with a smile. Only downside that I can even think of is that the restaurant can fit 40 people at best.

Curry is supposed to be a little thicker. I would rather have a small concentrated version of what I got. I had to just drown my rice with the curry, but it still didn't have as much flavor as I wanted it to have. I didn't get a chance to try the pad thai because my boyfriend was the one eating it, but he said it wasn't very good and that he wishes for me to order else where next time.

I'm picky when it comes to how my food is made but they never disappoint. I respect consistency, and with many places in town not always being good, I will continue to frequent Surang's.",zmMhcNY6vNw5vaU0O-Evrg,0,0,5,ioEI0B3ppVlIaM_7hy0cKg

The lunch specials are on point and definitely enough food for some take home biznazz. 

One of my fave aspects of this restaurant...they make it hot. Yes, I know I'm a white trash kinda girl but I can handle the heat. Bring it. When I ask for an 8 at other Thai spots, weak sauce. Here, they give me an 8 and it's perfect. Hey, I've dated enough Mexicans, so we know mama can handle the heat...",fcb3NvbGr9qaPPLUlSnk6A,0,1,5,-wMBGdkzOJ9zv95SROkDIQ
