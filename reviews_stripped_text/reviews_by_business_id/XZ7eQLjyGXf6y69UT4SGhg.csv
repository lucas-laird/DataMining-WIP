Great croissants.
Really good quiche.
Coffee is fresh and tastes like the beans are not old and stale.
Almond croissants are notably good.  No icky goo in the middle like some places.
Great ambience.  While the decor is sparse, the feeling is very comfortable and relaxing while you enjoy your treat here.

301418,2017-01-22,0,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"As others have mentioned, one of the founders of this new French cafe is a former chef at Wynn.  And you can see from the pastry selections that he has brought that high-end gourmet feel to this quaint off-strip cafe.  The interior is plain and simple -- doesn't really look like what you might think a french cafe would look like.  But that's not so important because the food offerings are exactly what you would expect.  Other reviewers have already praised the cinnamon roll...and there are plenty of other intriguing delicacies beyond the usual french cafe fare (nutella brioche anyone?).  The cafe also has a small selection of macaroons although I'll wait until I see the more unusual flavors I prefer to eat such as bubble gum and cotton candy (hopefully they will be adding more over time).  But what has kept me coming back to this little cafe are the crepes.   While the crepe menu is a little on the limited side, the taste and texture of the crepe is exactly what you would expect to experience in a french cafe.  Have had the classic nutella and whip cream, nutella and pineapple, caramel and butter, and the vanilla and pineapple (with coconut ice cream).  The presentation (which is a little different than other crepe places) is to fold the round sides of the crepe over so that the entire crepe is more of a square with the sauce sprayed on the top (along with fruit if you order one with fruit) and then the whipped cream sprayed on top in a line (and it is real whip cream too...not Redi-whip).  While the cafe's location near Ft. Apache and Spring Mountain is a little unusual (not where you would expect such a cafe to be located), it's more convenient for me than to go to the strip (especially with every casino beginning to charge locals parking :(   Overall, I would recommend Cafe Briezh to anybody I know who craves authentic, gourmet french pastries and crepes.",4BN6fq_Glvkgx6Su8dUiAQ,0,0,5,a9B0dG7k3gaBd1RYKXb49w

734411,2017-03-11,0,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"My foodie husband, two growing sons (13 and 12), and I love Cafe Breizh!  Frenchmen Chef Pierre and Chef Jerome and their delightful Café Breizh are a welcome addition to the Summerlin-area.  Chef Pierre, a former Executive Pastry Chef at the Wynn and Encore resort hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, has brought his culinary passion to the suburbs.  The ethnically-diverse, surrounding neighborhoods and nearby Summerlin villages provide a steady stream of loyal customers such as my family.  Since the French cafe's opening, we have thoroughly enjoyed as follows (the quality has been consistent): every type of quiche offered and accompanying side salad; the traditional galette; ham and cheese croissant; croissant; pain chocolate; nutella brioche; cinnamon roll; tiramisu; every flavor of macaron; chocolate chip cookie; oatmeal raisin cookie; coffee by La Colombe; and hot chocolate.  I'll be getting a crepe next time I go there.  For that upcoming special occasion, I plan to order one of their custom-made, elegant cakes.  Before having kids, my husband and I backpacked in Europe to include France.  Café Breizh's food and beverage is as good as it gets, if not better -- simply excellent.  My boys thoroughly enjoy watching Chef Jerome make galettes and crepes for customers.  This small, non-chain business has earned my family's support so much that we have highly recommended our family and friends to pay a visit to the café.",NsUv_PzTpGw8grSmiUap0g,0,0,5,G51hBmqrhjz1u_5ArPDCvQ

I was waiting for the lady in front of me to finish her transaction and then 3 asian ladies came in at this moment. They were greeted with a hello and a smile. So it was at this moment I felt a little jaded. Also those three asian ladies didn't consider I was in line and walked past me to the register to get the man's attention. The man looks at me and I nod at him to get his attention because I wanted to just eat some quiche, man! They ladies talk before he walks over to me and he starts taking their order first. 

So, I'll try Cafe Breizh another time. Perhaps.

1555162,2016-12-14,1,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"Café Breizh is home to America's best authentic French croissant. And thanks to Pierre and Jérôme, the genial young Brittany natives who own this wonderful bakery and make every delicacy themselves by hand, Café Breizh offers the finest pastries in Las Vegas, as well. French butter is used for their superb creations, and even the crepes--a Breton specialty--are made with a proper French griddle.

It is clear that Pierre and Jérôme have professional integrity. Dedicated to traditional methods of fabrication, they use time-honored artisanal techniques and understand that the finest ingredients yield noble results. Pastries at Café Breizh are at once light, delicate and deeply satisfying, the best I have eaten in the States. But their croissant is most impressive of all. So often this ubiquitous crescent roll translates into a lump of vaguely stratified dough...: at Café Breizh genuine French croissant is an absolute poem; dozens of light, flaky layers with a rich buttery smell in perfectly browned crackly shells, works of extraordinary skill that only a true French master baker could generate.

My husband and I learned of this new ""patisserie"" from our friend Jacques, a charming French fellow who knows how to live well. Jacques explained that Pierre and Jérôme had been employed at the luxurious Wynn Resort, before deciding to take control of their own destiny. Finally, to valorize the architecturally beautiful pastries neatly arranged under a glass-top counter, Café Breizh is tastefully decorated in fresh, clean whites, which act as a frame for the elegant display.

As soon as you enter you are greeted with the warm sweet and savory aromas this cute place has to offer.  

Do try their Ham and Cheese Croissant, the Apple Turnover, Chocolate Ganache topped Brownie, Cinnamon Roll, and Crepes.  They have a great variety of savory and sweet.  You can also ask to have your pastries warmed up in the oven!  Oh and don't forget a cup of their delicious coffee or cappuccino.  

I want so badly to give them 5+ stars but my only objection is the service and the seating.  we have been coming here since they opened and the experience has since change.  We would order and sit down and your order would be brought out to your table.  Now the only thing they deliver are specialty dishes.   So they call out for coffees, teas and pastries, well the problem with this is there are no names taken so if 5 different tables ordered similar items guess what kind of confusion this causes.  And they also don't tell you they will call out your order so probably not the best system for newcomers.  I have a feeling it's a staffing issue but there are still ways around this, perhaps ask for a name to call out.   The seating is another novelty in this place so be prepared to wait and wait or enjoy your items standing up.

Things I didn't like: This place epitomizes unpretentiousness as there's NO decor whatsoever! The few tables and chairs are arranged haphazardly. The beige walls lack decorations, theme, art, etc. consequently there is no ambiance or anything to look at. Additionally the bare walls, ceiling material and flooring all reflect sound. The place is noisy! All conversations reverberate annoyingly.

All that being said, the emporium has huge potential!",fwStqPnr2ks06nwFbZv0zw,3,1,4,A4K8irisnw54EDQDt-OlCA

1976647,2017-01-28,12,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"I have surprised myself by becoming a regular here! I'm not big on sweet pastries but Cafe Breizh has me hooked. From the much-hyped cinnamon roll to the made-to-order crepes and galettes, CB caters to those who eat with their eyes first ...and/or post their food on social media.

SAVORY: The ham and cheese croissant is a treasure, and one I've happily shared with a couple of friends. The salmon and broccoli quiche is a favorite to take and bake at home for later consumption with a salad. The galettes are perfectly cooked and I prefer the mushroom-goat cheese over the salmon-veggie version. 

SWEET: Their tarts are beautiful, but the lemon ones are especially tart so it went unfinished at our table. The chocolate chip cookies are perfection with melty chips and a perfect just-baked finish! The cinnamon roll is a take on your traditional flavors but with different ratio of crunchy and spongy bits. 

The quality is quickly evident on a visit, but there are a few areas upon which I hope to see improvement as they settle in: the dine-in service can at times be forgetful, but they're wonderful at following up once they're aware of an issue and the interior is a bit plain and cold but they seem to be adding to it bit by bit. I also wish their coffee was a bit better, as I've found it weak on more than one visit.

Sure enough, she selected - and later devoured - a beautiful pan au chocolat. 

My husband ordered a slice of cheesecake; repeating his choice from our first visit. 

I intended to have another one of those glorious chocolate chip cookies. And I did order one. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that there were still almond croissants in the case. So I got one of those, too. And a plain croissant. And a lemon tart. 

Yes, I know. I can't control myself. I'm like Ash Ketchum in a Pokemon store when it comes to pastry cases.

Surprise (not really): everyone loved everything. All three croissants were excellent, even considering they were purchased mid-day. The layers, flakiness, and crunch were exceptional. While the almond croissant was definitely one of the best I've had in town, I always seek more almond flavor. 

The chocolate chip cookie didn't have as much chocolate as the first one, but it was still, texture-wise, right up my alley.

To be specific I went to Cafe Breizh with two friends and was the first to order, although I was first I was given my food last. Usually this doesn't bother me but it did this time because what I ordered was exactly similar to what my friends had ordered and there was no explanation given as to why this happened. In order to make up for this disservice I was given a free pastry but I am still heavily disappointed and I don't feel a free pastry completely makes up for this as it should have been avoided in the first place.

I love going there for breakfast/lunch. I have been stuck on the same thing each time I've been because it's THAT good, but my companions have branched out and have never been disappointed. So here's what we've had:
Croque Madame- grilled ham and cheese that's been dunked in béchamel prior to grilling and then some how there's a perfect magical egg on top. Oh and more cheese. LEGIT.
Norwegian Galette- buckwheat crepe with roasted veggies, AMAZING smoked salmon, lemon, and the most delicious herb chive cream. SO EFFIN AMAZING.
Peanut Butter Banana Crepe- the crepes are laid flat and then the filling ( in this case delicious peanut butter, gorgeous scallops of banana, and the tastiest crunchy candied peanuts) is laid out beautifully and the round edges folded up to make almost a picture frame.
I always take pastries and a baguette when I leave, and they have all been phenomenal.
Also the staff is very sweet and attentive.

It was perfectly sweet, which for me was not nearly as sweet as it looked. The Croque Madame took longer to cook up, but when it came it was warm with browned, gooey Gruyere cheese all over it.

The owner is a Top chef but even though he is new at having his own business he's already doing things right. You can tell the pastries are beautifully crafted and the flavors are amazing. I've been waiting for a place like this for so long and finally it's here right in the neighborhood!! Apparently there will be a nice expansion to the menu once they are comfortable that the system is running smoothly. I like owner operated businesses because you know the quality and consistency won't decline and things will keep getting better. I'm looking forward to many more lunches here. I recommend the #1 galette it's my favorite. I like them all but find myself returning to the #1 most of the time. All the pastries are excellent and every person that I've brought here was impressed. I've noticed some reviews people complained that the place was cold looking well it's a modern style place. When your going for a lunch and spending 10-12 bucks  don't judge the place like your going to a steak house spending 50 per head. Some people have no empathy and never had a business they just don't understand that Rome wasn't built in a day.

The space itself is sparse and feels a bit cold. Despite passing by here regularly, it also took me a minute to find because their sign inexplicably is not lit at night and they do not have any clear open sign. The first time I finally found it was in the evening and I ended up not going in because they did appear to be open despite the lights inside being on (no one was visible inside). Same story the next time I went by, but decided to check and the person running it immediately came out from the back when I walked in the door.

On two subsequent visits during the day, I received less the positive customer service and ended up walking out both times without making my intended purchases. Both times I was not acknowledge at all when I first walked in. The first time there were two people working and both were busy doing things despite the place not being very busy. After standing around for a bit, one of the employees said he would be with me in a second as he walked by. Once I saw him starting to work on building some espresso drink after passing me repeatedly, I finally just left. The second time that same employee was clearly grabbing good to deliver to a table, so I waited until he had delivered the food thinking he would assist me when done. Instead he again kept walking past me and said be with you in a second during one of the passes as I had experienced the first time. When additional customers came in, it still did not seem to prompt any interest in stopping to assist me. In this visit, they must have had a very busy day as well since they only had a fraction of the normal options. Realizing I still was not going to be served again, I left. 

I desperately want to give this place a chance because everything looks tasty, but it's hard we I have been barely acknowledged as a customer twice.",kYzcmzwXRLkPgfnX5EMK3Q,2,0,3,oXIiWitWIwxb5GUU8pY3zQ

She also asked if we wanted a salad with the crock monsieur. I asked if it came with it and she said no, by its only $1.50, so I said sure. We went and sat outside and waited there... my husband finally went it to see if we could just grab the coffee and it was just sitting on the counter, along with our ""warm"" croissant. Well, our coffee was not hot and the croissant was not warm. Anyways, my husband goes back in to ask for 2 forks so we could share our croissant. She only gave him one set of utensils and said she would bring the other with the crock monsieur... why?! I don't know. She brings out our salad and crock monsieur with the other set of utensils. The salad is literally romaine lettuce with some type of mayo dressing.

I treated my mother out to a coffee and some sweets because I'm a good son (jk). I ordered the #3 gallete (sp?) had asked if I could get it with any other cheese because I really don't like goat cheese after the cashier ran back 3 times to ask the chef he allowed it and it was literally amazing. There's something about gruyere and not many places using it that really makes it so good when you get it, 

My mother ordered a macchiato and to her dismay she received a real macchiato and not what Starbucks brands as a sugary death trap. She was a little upset until I explained to her it was correct and she should have asked if it was American style. But she really enjoyed the flavor and just wished there was more beverage. I told her next time to get a cappuccino dry. She also got the ham and cheese croissant and it made up for all the issues with her drink. 

The only cons I noticed were the tables being kind of on top of each other so if it was actually packed you would have no privacy.  The other major con was they have no real cups that we saw. I hate drinking out of paper and plastic if I'm staying. It's not classy and it's actually cheaper to rewash cups. 

All in all I have my eyes on that tiramisu.   Someone tell me if it's as good as it looks. 

Update: the blueberry muffin looked a lot better than it tasted. It was too mushy on the inside and the blueberries were too sour. It's like they didn't get good ones.

We ordered a plain croissant and the La Norvegienne Galette. After placing the order at the counter we received a number and seated ourselves. Seating comfort could be improved with cushioned chairs. 
The Gallette was delivered after a short wait but not the croissant which I thought was strange since the Galette was made to order and the croissant was off the shelf and not even warmed up. After several minutes I returned to the counter and asked about the croissant and was told it would be right out. I don't if they forgot or what? 
The croissant was good but nothing special. However, the Galette with smoked salmon, sauteed vegetables (carrots, onions and celery) topped with creme chive was delicious. The salmon was juicy and nicely smoked and the vegetables were tender.

I tried both the sweet and savory ones. My wife got the traditional galette with egg, ham, and cheese. The presentation was unbelievable! It almost looked like a starfish from the ventral point of view (sorry for that biology remark). It has a really strong taste to it. I don't know if it's the ham or the cheese or a combination of both, but even my wife said it reminded her of cat food (not that she's ever tasted cat food lol but in reference to its smell). I got the nutella crepe with strawberries. It was, hands down, the best crepe I've ever had. I liked how it wasn't too soft/soggy, and it had a nice touch of crispy to it. And drizzled with nutella, how can you go wrong? 

We also tried their blueberry muffin and chocolate chip cookie. The muffin was shaped like a mushroom with a ridiculously large head, but I liked how crisp it was. The cookie was also really tasty. I enjoyed the generous amount of dark chocolate chunks and just how soft it was. 

I've never really been a huge fan of crepes but thank you to my wife for bringing me here and introducing me to this place. Will definitely be back!",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,14,13,4,dW-0TGOOc4rBzCaD9aKNLg

I chose Vanilla.

The crepes and quiches are also worth a visit.  The croque monsieur is my favorite of the savory items.  As far as drinks, they brew La Colombe coffee & espresso here.  Their coffee is excellent-- Cafe Breizh is a solid coffee destination.

The small space is really bright, warm, and inviting.  There is a little patio space in addition to the dining room area.

My one complaint is the service.  The cashiers here are unpolished and can be unprofessional at times.  For example, today I had to repeat my order three times to the cashier and then a fourth time several minutes later to the person who boxed up my pastries.

It was delicious; but I probably wouldn't order it again -  mostly because crepes are pretty fattening & I would rather have them for dessert. 

Dessert crêpe was scrumptious- caramel, an ice cream to die for, whipped cream, apples! YUM! Their coffee latte is delicious and they do have almond milk as an option, which I appreciate. I had an almond croissant and honestly I took one bite and didn't want anymore - it wasn't great. My friend liked it- I have tasted way better.

It is definitely a place worth trying out for the pastries and desserts. They have quiche, which my friend said was great - I try not to eat eggs - for the terrible way that we treat chickens at farms. 

I asked for lemon for my water and they almost didn't give it to me (saying we don't do that here) and then bringing me very paper thin slices even though my friend got big wedges of lemon for her fish. Not a great customer service moment- the food isn't cheap!

I was ready to order and got out two words when the young woman taking my order interrupted and said she was sorry but she'd be right back.It took her five minutes--perhaps longer--before she came back to the take my order.  During the time, she was packing take out boxes and I waited.  I ordered a galette, the Chevrotine and a cappuccino for eating there and a Nutella brioche to take out.  She gave me a table sign with a number so they would know where to bring the breakfast.

Then I waited.  It was between 20 and 25 minutes before my galette was brought to the table.  By then I was a bit irritated for the wait.  There were a number of staff there but they just couldn't do the take out orders and the in house orders in a timely fashion.  

The galette arrived and I still had not received my coffee.  Then I realized it was get your own from the counter when they placed it on the glass and call your name.  You need to develop a teacher's voice so people can hear you.  I retrieved my cappuccino and was finally ready to begin what turned into a frustrating breakfast.

The galette was made with mushrooms, bacon, and goat cheese.  It was OK.  I would have preferred the bacon to be in smaller pieces than whole slices but it was OK.  I brought the Nutella brioche home and had it later.

This was a one and done experience for me.  The service is so slow and the price point for the three items was high.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,11,3,fNT9c8sBT6fRXex4vtOLPA

Upon walking it to this small establishment, you are greeted with white walls, white table and chairs and a bright interior.  
We ordered coffee and each had a pastry.  The pastry was very good as was the coffee.  
As we sat at the table, we quickly noticed that every white chair, including those that we were sitting on was filthy!  The tile floor looked like it's never been cleaned since this place opened, one year ago.  It had huge amounts of food on the floor including wet food that fell off of the diners plates.  It was truly disgusting!  I then noticed that every empty table top was clearly dirty and each had its own scattered food debris.  The clothing of the cashier and other visible worker, once white, was clearly in need of washing.  The white walls were totally scuffed and very dirty both at the counter as well as the entire interior of this filthy, poorly managed and poorly maintained food establishment. Even the counter where you pick up your food had coffee rings on it and was not clean.  The place was not busy and the help, if propertly trained, should have been cleaning and maintaining the business.  It shows that they are not interesed or caring about keeping the place clean.
They have a small outside dining area; yes, this too was filthy and shows lack of total cleanliness throughout.
This is too bad because the food is very good but the disgusting filth will make sure I won't return.  I'm surprised that the Board of Health has not shut this place down!
Can't wait to see them featured on ""Dirty Dining"". It's just a matter of time.
This is a clear example of an excellent chef and baker that does not have a clue or propertly trained staff, as to how to operate a restaurant!
If this is the filth that the customer can see in the front of the house, I can't imagine the disaster in the kitchen.  I don't want to know.  I won't be back to find out.",jk_jaNf4FEkh51mQWdGQrQ,0,0,1,NgpWbKc_gse9_yGMJrPDXw

-Croissant with egg, ham and cheese

-lemon tarte
-caesar salad
-passion fruit ice tea
-hot mocha
Total came out to be $35


We chose this place because it is literally in walking distance from my house. There is free wifi and a patio as well. This place is very nice both exterior and interior. It is usually pretty empty so it's perfect for a study date as well. There are plenty of seats but they are more of couple seats than a big table. Im sure you can move the tables around. Im sure it is also pet-friendly since there is a patio. Everything is freshly made as well. 


The croissant was delicious. I've never had such delicious and fluffy egg. It had a nice crunch to it as well and super soft on the inside. 

The salad was very fresh. I'm not a fan of salad but I enjoyed taking a bite into their salad. 

Hands down, I think this place has won me with macarons. The macarons are not incredibly sweet at all. It has the perfect amount of sugar to it. The salted caramel is my favorite! Reminds me of my favorite beverly hills macarons all the way in California. I only wish they had more variety of flavors. I believe there's only 5 or 6 right now. Hopefully this business picks up and gets busier so that they can start expanding their menu. 

Lemon tarte was my least favorite. I actually think it was just too sour for me and I a couldn't handle it. I wish it was just a little bit more sugary or a lot less sour. Who knows? Maybe I am just not use to the taste of lemon tarte? 

The hot mocha wasn't for me but mybrother said he loved it! I tried it but it was too bitter. Im not a coffee fan though. 


The passion fruit was also just an okay drink. I thought it was going to taste like starbucks or coffeebean passion fruit. Its actually just passionfruit tea with no sugar or anything different to make it taste different. I would still order it when I'm thirsty since it does taste fresh and not made 10 days ago like most places. 

There's also a water station in the back for those who don't want to spend on drinks. 

Overall, I rate this place 5/5. It's very quiet and relax. Perfect for study dates. Perfect for brunch or breakfast as well. The food is amazing although some stuff still need improvement.

And to think that I didn't even grab one on my first visit... 

Cafe Breizh is a new French cafe open from breakfast until early at night. Initial rave reviews had me excited about both their savory delights and their sweet treats. Although I would've otherwise had to drive clear across town from Henderson for them, I was getting carb-wasted at another place already and decided to drop by. They're in a relatively empty plaza on Fort Apache closer to small side street Cherokee than to large cross street Spring Mountain. I ended up making a return trip later in the week to pick up a couple more items, which are all mentioned below.

The interior is very spacious, with a simple glass display running in a straight line from the wall to the register. You can watch them make crepes and galettes behind another glass barrier on the other side of the register, or you can just find a table in the relatively modest seating area, which will doubtless become crowded when they get more popular.

La Traditional Galette ($9) - first bite, owing to Nelson Q's review. First and last impression: the buckwheat batter was a bit too salty. Still, it's a crispy crepe with just a little bit of chewiness inside. I'm sure I've been sheltered in terms of ham, but the thinly sliced meat on this galette had great flavor and was textured like actual meat. The cheese was delicious, and the only fault with the egg yolk in the center is that it was a little small.

Ham and Cheese Croissant ($4) - indeed the earthly delight that others have raved about. Delicious, flaky croissant topped with a truly crunchy crust of cheese, and an air pocket inside that holds the same delightful ham as in the galette. It was a struggle to force myself not to eat the second half. I ended up briefly popping the remainder in the oven, and while the flavor didn't change, the warmth was very welcome.

Quiche ($5.50) - huge slices of savory egg custard heaven. Both varieties have a thick layer of silky, eggy deliciousness crowned by a beautiful golden-brown top, and the crumbly crust gives the perfect textural counterpoint. The Lorraine has a bottom layer of cheese and cubes of their excellent ham, and the Salmon & Broccoli has smoky flaky salmon with soft broccoli florets. These are more satisfying to me than the Ham and Cheese Croissants - just make sure they're heated up if they've just come out of the cold display case. (Yes, I actually ate some cold quiche at first.)

Croissant ($3) - a taller but not-so-long form that also contains an airy interior. I've seen this shape but once before, so at least you can enjoy the visual novelty. It has a great buttery crust, but the flavor wasn't as memorable as the best in town. Perhaps I'll have to taste it again on a completely empty stomach.

Almond Croissant ($3.75) - almond paste is similar to what you'll find in almond croissants, but because they decided to load the interior with wet almond paste, the bottom of the croissant becomes unusually wet. Otherwise, the flavor is fine and the non-moist bits of croissant are nicely crispy.

Apple Turnover ($3.50) - one of the best turnovers that I've had, but not one of the best apple pastries. I loved the buttery, flaky pastry that seems to have had a sweet glaze brushed on top to help achieve sweet, deep golden-brown crust. However, although the apple interior had great flavor, but too much of it was pureed almost to the point of being apple sauce. I want large chunks of juicy apple.

Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25) - generous amount of darker chocolate embedded throughout the cookie. Better than the chocolate chip cookie that I had at another French bakery (which might not even be offered there anymore). However, I'm not a fan of this style in general. I strongly prefer the ones with that distinctive flavor that I assume comes baking it until brown (but still keeping the interior soft).

Blueberry Muffin ($3.50) - tons of blueberries in the base, which is actually the minority of the pastry. The muffin top is absurdly huge, and it's a crispy and crumbly treat that doesn't feel too heavy like Costco muffins do. A great option overall.

Cinnamon Roll ($3.50) - the star of this place in terms of sweets, with an addictively sweet crunchy caramelized crust giving way to a spongy interior and great cinnamon flavor throughout. I did bill it as perfect, but I actually want even more of that crust. Maybe cutting the roll instead of simply pulling the spiral apart would help to even out the crust distribution. This ain't your run-of-the-mill grocery store or mall cinnamon roll.

Cafe Breizh is an excellent place for savories and offers at least one superstar sweet pastry. I look forward to trying their tarts and freshly cooked sweet crepes the next time that I make the cross-town trek. Minor disappointments aside, this is a great new French bakery that neighborhood locals should feel very happy to have.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,12,5,LEYmZHxXnbz2vqfxj6GyRQ

4215404,2016-12-05,6,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"I heard of this place from a friend a few days ago, as they just opened at the start of this month. Cafe Breizh's menu is comprised of pastries, savory/sweet crepes, and an array of beverages (that range from coffees, teas, and even hot chocolate)!

They claim to have an authentic taste of Brittany, France in all its crispy glory. I say this because a lot of their inventory that I've tried tends to have a soft but crispy aftertaste. I can understand the idea though, since Brittany (or Bretagne, if you want to be French-y) specializes in crêperie restaurants. 

I ordered their La Norvegienne savory crepe, tiramisu, and cinnamon roll. My friend ordered La Chevrotine savory crepe and an apple turnover. The crepes were minimalistic, soft but crispy; I liked how buttery the smoked salmon was as well as their sautéed veggies in the center blended well with the cream chive (even the onions were subtle in taste). I definitely recommend the La Norvegienne as its consistent in taste on my second visit there! 

I also ordered their hot chocolate, which was very light in flavor, but wasn't overtly sweet. Their cinnamon roll was crunchy, but the interior was soft and slightly fluffy. The tiramisu was creamy and was nonetheless a light eat. 

Most of their sweets I noticed thus far weren't sickeningly sweet, which I liked. I also bought their macarons (raspberry & pistachio) to bring with me to work, and even hours after the flavors were still intact, neither sweet nor too nutty but soft and tasty in every bite!

Please note that they are open from 7am-7pm daily, tucked away near the middle of the plaza at the corner of Fort Apache & Spring Mountain.",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,6,7,5,A61IvrhZAh6E5p8RhNvXVw

On January 2nd, I pre-ordered a Galette des Rois after doing some Yelp research for French bakeries. Cafe Breizh was the only one! So I emailed Pierre and put in an order for 1 Galette des Rois!

It cost me 30$ but it was enough for 6 people. It was flaky, buttery, and almond-y goodness :) I enjoyed every bite and was happy to see how they included a gold paper crown for the lucky person who found the feve (a little donkey). Very high quality galette and I would order it again. 

When I went to pick up the cake, the place was empty so I didn't have to worry about waiting in line. The place is very clean, bright, spacious, and modestly decorated. There is a long glass display where their pastries entice you. The man who helped me with my order was kind and polite.

The star here is the chef and his passion for making serious brunch goodness. First off, if you could resist the jewelry display of freshly made French pastries you can treat yourself to ( what I recommend ) La Traditional Galette. You could pick ham or turkey and I picked turkey. Honestly, I just figured these were savory crepe options, but what came.out were like pieces of art! The portion was huge and I opted for a side salad which was neatly placed to the corner of the Galette. The salad was perfectly dressed with a light dressing and provided a nice crunch element with the soft and warm turkey cheese crepe. They offer coffee, espresso, cappuccino, and latte, but the canned latte in a fridge off to the left caught my eye. It was a draft latte, which was explained to me do not shake the can and the foam will rise to the top like a latte. Chef even gave me a chilled glass with ice to pour over to fully enjoy this canned latte. How thoughtful! The place had a lot of people picking up pastries and coffee to go as well as prepped salads the chef just put in the fridge. He was cooking, prepping, greeting people, and even cleaning up the tables. He had one girl at the register who helped out too, but he was not too good to roll up his sleeves and help keep the place tidy and running smooth. Wow! I was surprisingly full after my meal and really wanted to try the chocolate brioche and the Napoleon, but I know I will be back even though it is out my way. This place is worth the drive and the prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food. Highly recommend!",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,9,7,5,RiSRdcRLdj_dmWq5CapDBg
4702427,2017-05-27,4,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"One of my absolute favorite eateries are French cafes. I love its casual chic environment and they have all of my favorite foods! Every one is a little different and what I love about Cafe Breizh is their strong offerings of galettes, quiches, and phenomenal pastries. 

I've had their Croissant, Almond Croissant, Pain au Chocolat, Ham and Cheese Croissant, Strawberry Tart, and Nutella Brioche. The croissants are A M A Z I N G. Flaky, buttery, heavenly goodness. All of the pastries are great, however, I did not care for the Nutella Brioche; the bread was a tad dry and its overall flavor was shrug-worthy. 

The Galettes ($9-$12) are fabulous as well! I've really enjoyed La Norvgienne (salmon with beautiful sautéed vegetables and crème) and La Chevrotine (crispy bacon, goat cheese, and mushroom). 

I tried the Salmon and Broccoli Quiche on my first visit and it was just okay. The eggs weren't very creamy and it had very little flavor. However, the Mushroom Spinach Gouda Quiche was phenomenal on my most recent trip! The eggs were custard-y and the flavor was wonderful. Quiches: $5.50.

A new addition to the savory menu is the Croque Monsieur and Croque Madame ($11). We opted for the egg version (Madame) and were very pleased with the dish. Delicious!!

An update since my first visit in March is the salad (chopped Romaine lettuce tossed in housemade vinaigrette) is no longer included with their savory dishes; it is an extra $1.50 per dish. Boo!

I came in and the employee said I would need to wait 10 min for the missing items which was fine I just walked in early. The owner gave a confused and irritated look to the super sweet counter employee. Then the owner stood up straight while puffing up his chest and said ""he's just an employee"" (like a pompous jerky to make his employee feel small) ""I'm the owner you can order anything you want"". It made me upset for the employee, I was embarrassed for this poor kid. The owner deserved a karate chop to the neck it was in such bad taste. 

I made my order the super nice kid went to back to retrieve the items from the back and the tough guy owner comes out saying it's not ready. I couldn't hold back and said ""but you're the owner you just said I can order anything and this nice employee was wrong, you're the owner right, you don't know.""

I also told him to give his employees wind beneath their wings and loving nudges instead. Then I left, I couldn't give him any money.

Opened just this month I can say, having been to quite a few in country, that this is the real deal. They're galettes and crepês are simply to die for. And their pastries are the work of a true connoisseur. Located in a otherwise nondescript strip mall on S Fort Apache this place is certain to become a favorite on anyone's list who appreciates the fine arts of French baking. The dining room is simple but small though they have poured a patio stretching out into the parking lot which will no doubt be packed come spring/summer. A must for pastry hounds...

Update: today I tried the Briezh crepe with caramel butter and apple. Extraordinary! Also had my first pain chocolate here. I've had these all over France but without question this one was the lightest, most flaky and crisp one ever. Oh, and scrumptiously chocolaty.

4974856,2017-11-30,5,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"Quiche. 

I have either been eating bad quiche my whole life or everyone else is doing it wrong because their version is to die for.  It is just SO good.  Oh my gawd, orgasm in the mouth-worthy good!  It's ridiculous smooth, silky and rich...and just plain delicious!! I now crave quiche...well, at least their version only!  They have three kinds - Lorraine (Gruyere and ham); Mushroom, Spinach and Gouda; and Salmon and Broccoli.  My favorite of the three is the Lorraine, but I'll be more than happy to eat the other two should my first choice be sold out.  (I always call ahead because they do tend to sell out of these yummy things!)

Their galettes are also something to also write home about.  First off, their galette is a Breton galette, from the Brittany region of France.  So, it's actually more like a crepe or pancake made from buckwheat flour.  There is something just delicious about the actual batter they use!  I love it.  They have four variations - La Tradition (egg, cheese, ham or turkey); La Vegetarienne (celery, carrot, turnip, and tomato reduction; La Chevrotine (mushroom, goat cheese and bacon); and La Norvgienne (sautéed vegetables, salmon, and cream chive).  My favorite is the La Norvgienne.  Their sweet crepes are also yummy too.

They have a lot of various pastries displayed and are popular, but I come only for the quiche and galettes.

The few downsides would be there isn't a whole lot of seating.  There are some tables outside if you can bear the heat.  Service can be great, depending on which waitress you get.  (The water containers always need to be refilled.)  Usually the staff brings the food to our table.  However, I noticed with coffees and pastries, some will just call out your order and hope you eventually come to the counter and get it yourself. Nonetheless, these will not deter me from getting the most delicious quiches and galettes in town.

They don't acknowledge more than one customer at a time (not even a be with you in a moment) and ordering takes forever.

Small little cafe, but they had a large assortment of pastries and crepes. And these crepe like things called galattes, which i guess  could be compared to an omelette pancake. Staff was friendly and the pricing isn't too bad.

Opened at the onset of December and featuring the work of Strip-veteran Pierre Gatel plus his partner Jerome Marchand, Café Breizh adds one more French Bakery to the growing half-dozen in the West Valley with longer hours than most and a some unexpected surprises including Coffee from La Colombe plus the offering of French Crepes.

Located on South Fort Apache, the interior featuring sleek design and clean white lines though the area surrounding it seems most well-known for a Dollar Store and Little Caesars, patrons of Café Breizh are invited to dine on a wide diversity of items both sweet and savory at one of the restaurant's indoor tables or a soon-to-be-built patio while the ramp-up process in the kitchen is already underway.

Said to have been a longtime dream for Chef Gatel, his birth and training both in Northern France before bringing his skills overseas where classic recipes were featured at Wynn and Encore for over a decade, it is with wide eyes that most will take in the beautiful creations stored behind glass as more items bake in the kitchen to replete daily choices from seven in the morning until seven in the evening.

Eventually opting for a half-dozen plus one pastries, Pierre tacking on an Americano plus one more after a visit to the kitchen that is still a bit disorganized but assuredly up-and-running with plenty of room to grow, first bites of a Ham and Cheese Croissant glistening beneath a shattering shell of Cheddar quickly gave notice that the team knows its stuff, the separated layers soft and delicate despite being filled with sliced Pork and easily one of Las Vegas best savory breakfast items, on-Strip or off.

Moving on to sweeter things, even the Chef's already-known description of a 'traditional' Almond Croissant not enough to convince me that the one at Café Breizh isn't soggy and overly slathered with Frangipane - though my 9-year old dining companion admittedly liked it a lot - far better textures were found in a tightly wound Cinnamon Roll only rivaled by CRAFTkitchen locally for balance of crunch and springy center without rendering the edges dried-out.

Serving an admirable Blueberry Muffin, the shallow-welled baking pan making it almost 80% 'top' with fresh Blueberries throughout, Pierre's Raspberry Tart offers a lot of good Fruit atop a Shortbread-style crust though the filling beneath is a little underwhelming, his Turnover far better as a result of making the inside from freshly sliced Fuji Apples without too much sugar and just a hint of salt.

Rounding out the morning with two Cookies, the better of the two a toss-up as each features a crisp rim and nearly Pudding-soft center, Chef Gatel states that the secret to his Chocolate Chip is allowing the chunks of Dark Chocolate to melt slightly before mixing them into the batter while the Oatmeal is just a matter of using good ingredients, something that a look at his walk-in and prep-table makes quite evident for all of his creations.

****Already off to a good start and a welcome addition to an area that certainly needs it, Café Breizh is the sort of place that will be interesting to watch and revisit over time, Chef Gatel and his partner clearly possessing a lot of skill as well as passion with a kitchen more than capable of doing more should the community demand it.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,4,r4iPKTQfiKfXYv0edr4MoQ

From the moment you walk into this spacious and modern French cafe. Your greeted by a wonderful staff. It was a pleasure to have the Chefs serve us and made sure that everything was good. We notice that a good portion of the customers were speaking French and it reminded me the many cafes that I frequent when I visited Paris in 2012. It assured us that this place is going to be very popular.

Onto the delicious pastries, everything we had was simply amazing! From the fresh croissants to the apple turnover and the pumpkin cheesecake was wonderful. Another favorite is the Almond croissant and Cinnamon roll, were on point along with the French macaroons. However, I didn't get the chance to try any of their Crepes and Galettes. We did a get chance to enjoy the delicious Salmon & Broccoli Quiche. Highly recommend, it was full of flavor and not bland or salty. The quiche was consistent and the flaky crust was delicious.

The staff is always kind and knowledgeable of the items available that day. They're always great at recommending pairings for savory and sweet if you can't quite decide what you want.

5503765,2017-07-11,0,XZ7eQLjyGXf6y69UT4SGhg,"This place is a perfect example of everything that is great about Yelp. After spending a few days eating at chains and not-so-great Vegas dining establishments I really wanted to try something different: Fresh, clean, and local. A French Creperie/Bakery? I'm so there! With over 100 reviews and four and a half stars you're almost guaranteed to love it.

My friends and I arrived shortly after they opened on a Wednesday (The Fourth of July, in fact!). They had a glorious assortment of pastries and desserts on display. GLORIOUS. Fruit tarts, macarons, plain and almond croissants, pain au chocolat, Nutella brioche, apple turnovers, cinnamon rolls, tiramisu, brownies, cookies, etc etc. They also had some savory items: quiches, chicken salad croissants, and beautiful golden crusty baguettes. 

We all stood in awe for a moment before getting down to business. First, we wanted to try the galettes (basically savory crepes made with buckwheat batter), and through some terrible error we managed to order the same one (terrible only because I would have liked to try the others): La Chevrotine with mushroom, goat cheese, and bacon. After ordering the owner and chef came out and made them in front of us! He is truly from France which just added to the charm of the whole experience. He talked to us a bit, and was even kind enough to offer to delay making our sweet crepe until after we'd finished our galettes (we declined because we were impatient, and stuffing our faces with all the food needed to happen immediately). Both the galettes and crepes look large, and they are quite filling, but the batter is very thin, and the toppings are not overwhelming, so unless you're not very hungry don't do yourself the disservice of sharing with someone. La Chevrotine was fantastic. The goat cheese was excellent quality, mild, but still tasty, and the mushrooms were perfectly sautéed. I opted to include the side salad which they serve on top of your galette (it did get a little warm on the bottom, which would be my only complaint about anything, but it was still wonderful). The salad consists of chopped romaine, and is lightly dressed with a simple vinaigrette. I would definitely recommend including the salad as it is a nice balance to the richness of the galette (although make no mistake, they are not too heavy). We shared the Nutella crepe with strawberries. The strawberry slices were arranged so beautifully, the whipped cream was freshly made, and the sprinkle of chocolate crunchies was the perfect touch. 

We then ordered several items to take home. Descriptions in brief:
Tiramisu: They taped it down in the box to prevent it from spilling, and it was a fabulous tiramisu. I especially loved the marscapone layers. Instead of ladyfingers it featured thin round cookies.
Apple turnover: Possibly the flakiest pastry I've ever had. Filling was excellent and not too sweet. I reheated it in the oven at 360 degrees for a few minutes, and it was so perfect.
Cinnamon roll: Reheated as above. Firm dough, but not tough. Not too cinnamon-ey either!
Nutella Brioche: Brioche is one of my favorite types of bread. This was soooo soft, rich and flavorful (and huge!). It just had a thin layer of nutella over the top, so if you don't want anything terribly sweet this would be a good choice
Brownie: It included walnuts, was very moist, and was stunningly frosted with a thick chocolate ganache. The chocolate was rich and of high quality.

The girl working the cash register was lovely. Very patient and friendly, and while they have self-serve water available in a dispenser, she offered us ice without our asking. Prices are reasonable: Averaging about $10 for galettes, $8 for crepes, and maybe $3 for pastries.

The interior is open, light, and bright, with windows spanning the entire front. There is seating for about fifteen inside, and also a small dining area outside.

They are about 15 minutes away from the Strip. We were on our way home, so it was no biggie, but I would encourage anyone in Vegas to visit, even if it is a bit out of their way. My friends and I all agreed that we will make a point of dining here whenever we are in the area.",a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g,3,1,5,qp003n28FMcR1xy5MMTD7A

This hot and new business instantly became a bookmark after reading other Yelp reviews that mentioned the cinnamon roll.  I love cinnamon anything, but put it in a roll and I have to check it out.  
Walking in, you are greeted with a view of the glass cases that show off the lovely pastries offered here, including the cinnamon rolls.  One of the chefs was making a crépe so the smells wafting through the air were delicious.  A friendly staff member took our order and we grabbed seats at a table for two.  Seating was almost all taken with customers enjoying their food.  One couple informed us that they are regulars, the husband from France and his wife from Brazil, I think.  She told us that her husband loves this place and that it's authentic French food, so we knew that this stamp of approval was a sign of good things to come.
Sure enough, our order of the cinnamon roll, apple turnover, the nutella with strawberries and banana crépe, and the La Chevrotine galette with bacon, mushrooms, and goat cheese arrived and everything was beautiful not to mention delectable!

I arrived and there was just three people inside including myself which gave me the opportunity to interact with Chef Pierre. He recommended I try one of the Buckwheat Galette and I am so glad I did. I chose the vegetarian version which included celery, carrots and turnips. I had the pleasure of watching him create this artistic dish. When it was ready, he walked it over and served me. I was very impressed with his personal service and the care he took in making my dish. The Galette tasted fresh and the vegetables had the right amount of crunch. I enjoyed a cup of green tea and  enjoyed each bite! 

As I sat there looking around, I noticed the simplistic and clean interior which I just loved. Minimal decor in the dining area and the showcases are not crammed full of pastries. There are just the right amount and it is looks classy. The location of the cafe is in a strip mall but stands out from the surrounding businesses. 

A few moments after I begun to eat, the place filled up fast. I noticed croissants being served along with a very mouth watering quiche that I plan to try next time.

Hands down the best crepe spot in Vegas. I love the texture and the flavor of their sweet crepe batter. I've had the nutella twice, and also the apple brown sugar. I'm a chocolate fan, so of course I am going to keep going back for the nutella.

That muffin tho. Just take one look, and you know it's legit. Muffin top action is to the max, just how I like it. IT's ALLLLL TOP, BABY!!!!

I'm a huge croissant fan, and it wasn't my favorite. I have yet to try their almond croissant. That one's also a HEAD TURNER.

We were on the hunt for pain chocolat and we were told this was the best place to get it.  Unfortunately they were sold out of pain chocolat at 1pm on Saturday, but I still walked out with an almond croissant which was delicious.  We came back the next day at noon and successfully purchased the pain chocolat!  The staff very helpfully wrote the reheating instructions on our takeout bag and the recommendations were spot on. 

Next two times we came back for french baguettes.  We also got a napoleon which was also yummy with a delicious burnt sugar crunch.  A testament of how much better the baguettes are here is that I was ""forced"" due to time to get a baguette from the local Sprouts, I couldn't finish the baguette. 

I only wish these guys were closer!  Highly recommended.",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,1,0,5,GHGmoNqGeZPoZ3Kae62JhA

4) ALL WILL BE WELL WORTH!

This little gem of a place is exquisite and all so divine. I've been here twice and I'm never disappointed. 
The butter is imported from France and the ingredients are all high quality. If you're like me and you love sweets but can't have them due to the discomfort after eating them this is your place.
It reminds me of being in Europe where the pastries melt in your mouth. 
I certainly will return.

They have crepes, pastries, quiches, breakfast and lunch sandwiches. I can appreciate the hard work that goes into this place because you can see it. 

Personally, I didn't like the choice of cheese for the cheesecake. It was not enjoyable and I rarely meet a cheesecake I don't like. Or maybe I didn't enjoy it because there was a short, brown hair baked into my slice (my hair is black). C'est la vie!",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,4,3,4,6RI5AHhNWkn1w1lYqbpOcw

Espresso was smooth and even a little chocolately flavored (maybe?). While I was in a woman returned complaining about her to-go coffee. Not sure what her issue was...maybe she's used to Starbucks?
