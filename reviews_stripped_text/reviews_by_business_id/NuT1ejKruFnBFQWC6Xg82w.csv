The girl who helped me (I think her name was Tani) was really helpful. Being my first time there she helped me order and explained the differences in the pizzas. What really shocked me was when she asked ""Do you want help to the car?"" after my pizza was ready. I'm a pretty good sized guy and could easily carry the items, so really she really was being polite. It was impressive service.

As they're making our pizza, the Cowboy, they then inform us that they are out of mushrooms. It would have been nice to know that they were out when we ordered and before we paid. We could have gotten a different pizza or gone to the one off Tropicana if we had known before hand. They offered us a different option of topping as long as it wasn't meat. We said no. They didn't offer us compensation for the inconvenience which was irritating. Pizza is still good, but make sure to ask them if they have all their toppings first before you pay since they apparently won't tell you beforehand. Maybe they need a sign that says when they're out of a topping that's on almost all of their pizzas.",rqf-FkRjUrMpNxQCcc2VOg,0,0,2,9YunEeJWI-jPo4j31fTGzg

I believe her name is Talice.  She wasn't wearing her name tag so I had to ask another girl that was working for her name.  She didn't seem happy to be there and was not very pleasant either.  She seemed irritated and did not have any customer service skills.  I asked what the popular item was as it was my first experience and she seemed irritated from my question.  Not really someone I want to deal with again.  Must have been an off day as previous reviews says that the staff is awesome.  The girl that prepared my pizza was ok.  Her name was CJ.

The service was excellent. The girls were super friendly, informative and attentive. I love the fridge full of their specials too. They have some good deals in there.  The food, however, was just okay. 

First we got the salad. Nothing special. Just a salad and the lettuce was a little old. So on to the pizza. I didn't care for the pizza either. Their sauce just lacks substance. Something was just missing. Plus their crust was just okay. I would say it's equivalent to a Digiorno pizza but I guess just fresher ingredients.
