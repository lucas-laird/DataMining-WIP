The waiter's knowledge of the menu and wine pairing was impressive. He told us it was their first night being open and this was their soft opening. He said they jumped through hoops to make sure they didn't have any of those newly opened errors/hiccups. The service, food and whole dining experience was outstanding. 

My husband had the filet and I had the braised short ribs. We shared the sautéed mushroom side. We were stuffed but had to try the sticky toffee pudding at the advice of the waiter. He said that it was Chef Ramsey's signature dessert. Sold!

Pleasant surprise was Gordon Ramsay was there and greeted guests and took pictures with them too. Nice guy... Food was great! Met our high expectations and pleased our palettes and stomachs! 

Stand outs were Cian, one of the hostesses and Eric, a food runner. Cian greeted us, as well as other guests with a smile and a warm, welcoming demeanor. It was such a pleasant reception. She made us feel so welcomed and it started off a great dinner experience for us! Then Eric not only brought us our food but was so attentive and caring. I came back from using the restroom and all of a sudden Eric was there pulling out my chair for me to sit back down! A real gentleman. Unexpected and completely a wonderful touch!

840683,2018-01-24,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I'm a huge fan of Chef Ramsay. Enjoy his shows, his plain talk, his commitment to excellent, fresh and well-cooked food. Visited his new restaurant, Hell's Kitchen, last night in Vegas. 

As a marketing professional I spent a great deal of time admiring his branding; signage, video loop featuring Ramsay as you walk in, logo merchandise, embroidered napkins...even the tiny logo ""brand"" on the orange peel in my drink. I had high expectations.

But the food and the service were both somewhat bizarre and I'd emphatically state that there was more flash than substance to the new restaurant.

It took 15 minutes to get our waiter to acknowledge us and another 15 to get a glass of water. Odd beginning. When asked about food allergies, our friend stated that he was allergic to garlic. The waiter (Michael) promptly stated that there would be little or nothing our dining companion could eat in the restaurant. An argument ensued about the quality of the chef who could not prepare a dish without garlic. So in this lovely setting, our guest ate quinoa salad. That was all the kitchen could accommodate.

The scallops were great. My smoked beet salad was good. My husband's chicken was very over cooked and as Ramsay would say, ""My nana could do better and she's f***ing dead!"". Caesar salad was underwhelming. When all was said and done, we skipped dessert and called it a night.

I wanted this to be a great experience for many reasons. To say the least, we were underwhelmed. I'm giving it 3 stars mostly because of the branding. Straight food review and service would be 2 at most.",NkoU6YpqfcXKTGWSkRM9Sw,0,0,3,WAHuOCYLNV1Y2s00g-wjbQ

When I walked out of Caesar's Palace and saw the famous logo, I just had to enter to have a look. Without a reservation or plan I did not have my hopes high but, the place looked really nice and friendly. There was no line for the bar so I decided to take my chances although there were no free seats.

Finally a space opened up, I set down and I did not regret it. The food was great: the tuna tartar was fresh, tasty and a very generous portion; personally I would have preferred it a bit more spicy than sweet. The wild mushroom pizza with onions afterwards was quiet large and delicious as well.

But the one truly amazing thing was the service - I don't want to exaggerate but I have to really think hard to remember an instance when I was ever treated better, friendlier or more politely; all in a genuine way! For fun, I asked whether Gordon ever comes in and screams at them - the response was that that is all show for TV and that he is actually really nice!

The bar is beautifully appointed with all of the best liquors which is expected.  Pitchfork chandeliers through out the restaurant and of course the famous red and blue kitchen.   The night started off with some cocktails (notes from Gordon and a whiskey drink that comes smoked to the table).

1001689,2018-02-05,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"We arrived with a party of three as part of a family reunion. We each ordered the prix fixe meal consisting of scallops, beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding. I added the wine pairing which I count as the single most ridiculous way of losing $50, and that's including slot machine play. The first course scallops were incredible, but unfortunately, they were the only part of the meal that tasted as though they were prepared by professional chefs. Our waiter asked if he should bring my second glass of wine (for $50, I would expect what I consider 3 full glasses of wine, all three glasses here equaled the equivalent of what I consider one glass of wine). I told him he could bring the wine, not realizing it would be another 40 minutes until our second course arrived. Our beef wellington was overwhelmed by overcooked phyllo dough and really quite bland. The surrounding vegetables were flavorless, hard knobs. One of us had an order of scalloped potatoes and they were completely under-seasoned. I left most of my second dish untouched. The sticky toffee pudding was exceedingly rich, I had a few bites and pushed it aside. Our waiter then brought out my third wine pairing (seems he forgot about us) and explained that this would be only a 2 oz dessert wine pairing. Overall, we were incredibly disappointed by this meal and we spent over $400 between the three of us (and I was the only one who added alcohol to the meal). We would absolutely not return.

The waygu meatball appetizer is amazing with great bursting flavor of Italia. Great job! 

I felt the grilled chicken sandwich was good but needed a small bit of chile spice in the sandwich. The reason I say this is because the avocado seems to take over the flavor.

The service staff was wonderful but the food and cocktails had issues. The most glaring was the desert- how is it possible that his signature sticky toffee pudding was mundane here and yet the next night, at his Pub and Grill on the same hotel property, it was spectacular (as expected)? The HK pudding was dry - a 5 our if 10. The Pub's pudding was moist and perfect- 10 out of 10!! Other food issues- the lobster risotto wasn't warm. And the beef Wellington was under seasoned. I have done Gordon's recipe for it at home and was expecting the restaurant to at least make it as well as I did. Someone was clearly not following instructions to Season every layer. The last ding is on the bar staff - two of our party ordered the same cocktail. One was perfect the other was a sugary sludgy mess. (Which the waitress immediately replaced).

1066550,2018-02-03,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"What a beautiful space! Our service that night was great! Our server was courteous, attentive and knowledgeable. 10/10 for service!
We decided to go with one set menu (Scallops, Wellington, Sticky Toffee Pudding), and a la carte items: Seafood Tower, Rack of Lamb, Chocolate cake. 
There was a very noticeable flavor/quality difference between the set menu and a la carte options.

Starters:
- Seafood tower presentation is stunning! Red lights illuminate the ice that cradles the seafood on 3 different perches. Fresh. Briney. No hint of fishy or rubbery seafood. One of the lobster tails however had no meat in it. 8/10

- Scallops - 5 scallop halves (not full scallops) were a bit disappointing. I'd rather have two full scallops (seared on the outside, velvety on the inside) than a plate that is meant to look plentiful by cutting them in half. But that's just me. Flavor was good but nothing worth raving about. 5/10

Mains:
- Rack of Lamb - perfectly cooked! Medium Rare. An absolute flavor explosion. The seasoning was not overpowering the delicate lamb and the whip that it was served on is a highlight on its own. 10/10

- Wellington - such a disappointment! Admittedly, along with the scallops, these two dishes are the highlight of any Gordon Ramsey feature. Don't dare get these wrong. But they did in every way, at least for us. The fact that he's so adamant about his Wellingtons really raises the bar on expectation and, in turn, just highlighted its flaws, all the more! When it arrived it was overcooked (medium/well, but more well than medium), although we ordered medium/rare. Secondly it tasted completely unseasoned. No hint of the mustard/salt/pepper around the meat. The Parma ham was practically non-existent and flavorless. The pastry did not have any hint of salt sprinkling or flavor. Although the presentation was beautiful, the flavor was so disappointing. 2/10

Desserts:
Both desserts were delicious. The warm sticky toffee did not taste microwaved, as you find with many restaurants. But beware, it's filling and you will want to finish it! So save some room for it. The chocolate cake had a red chocolate pitchfork that was a nice tie in to the overall theme of the restaurant. 8/10

Last, but certainly not least - Cocktails!
These were the highlight (alongside the seafood tower presentation and rack of lamb). 

- The Roman Spritz is not just delicious and beautifully presented, but it was perfectly balanced. Presented with two large olives & a rosemary sprig. So good, I wish it were bigger. 9/10

- Smoke on the Blvd is a showstopper. Served in a whiskey glass with a Hell's Kitchen branded orange rind, it's served in a glass box that is filled with cherrywood smoke. Presented tableside, the server opens the box and the table is quickly enveloped in the aromatic smoke. Great flavor and aromatics! Definitely worth ordering. 10/10

- Notes from Gordon adds a bit of Gordon humor. The drink itself is mild on the palate and tastes more like a lemonade - perfect for those who do not fancy a strong alcohol punch in their drink. The drink is served with a rolled up note, that has an iconic Gordon Ramsey quote/insult on it. That night the quote served with the drink was: ""This food is so frozen it just started singing 'Let It Go'"". Lol. Love it. 8/10

Overall, I would certainly recommend to experience it at least once. The open kitchen with Red/Blue team chefs and design add a gorgeous flair.

We had an Innes & Gunn, couple of glasses of wine and our evening was crowned by a visit of Chef Gordon Ramsay!!!!!! He was there for hours, checking on everything, taking pictures with every single guest. Great guy, thank you for taking the time Chef!!!

We will definitely be back, lots of dishes on the menu we didn't get to try.",-DutPylQSrRPyaCyXWFinA,4,1,5,89ruEPxZUaWKLyy_1YQtIg

I came to Hells Kitchen with the expectation of having s similar experience to what I see on the television show (I've watched every episode). I ordered the Lobster Risotto and the disappointment started with the presentation. It looked nothing like it looks on television when Gordon serves it. They serve a small portion on a flat plate as opposed to a bowl on the show (diners next to us had a similar reaction to the presentation).  It went downhill from there. The risotto was under cooked and the lobster was over cooked. The risotto has the same texture as undercooked rice to give it some context.  Lobster was chewy.  I also ordered the Beef Wellington. The filet was cooked well, however the stuffing they use in there was salty and overbearing. The reason I gave two stars is that the server did a fine job. If they are OK with churning and Burning customers then the are ok. I don't see customers returning for a second visit.",LF4zIjhFPRV6QHUrNzJfRg,0,0,2,oZbCmwFYnHaerO72XTvK7Q

We were seated right away when we arrived. However, waiter was not informed we were celebrating a birthday when we specifically noted that in our reservation. We were seated on high bar seats which seemed kind of odd since we had reservations. Seems like we were just stuffed in a corner.  
The scallop appetizer arrived at 10:15pm and was absolutely delicious but after that,  we waited so long for the rest of our food I lost my appetite. The entrees arrived around 11:15pm and were kind of cold.  Salmon and beef Wellington were good but chicken was super dry. I was so upset with how long the dinner was taking I decided to pay the bill and left after the entree Leaving my brother and his girlfriend to finish all our desserts that was part of the prefixed menu. Birthday dinner ruined.  Such a disappointment!

The restaurant overall is extremely noisy & more casual than I expected. We had a view of the open kitchen but if you can't see that the seats by the windows are right on the strip. 

This seasons winner Chef Michelle was there working the pass training for her new position. She was very willing to talk to people & take pictures.  Very nice. 

As for the food, we ordered Pumpkin soup, lLobster Risotto, Short ribs, and Brussel sprouts. They started us with an amuse bouche  that I can't recall what it was. Just ok nothing special. 

Soup: silky & decadent 

Risotto: with sage & butternut squash you can't go wrong. Delicious! Definitely an appetizer size portion, literally just a few bites of risotto. I really wish it was offered as an entree instead of an appetizer. 

Short ribs: served with some Brussel sprouts , pearl onion, tomatoes & polenta. Very good 

Brussel sprouts: roasted & topped with chilies and I'm pretty sure some type of soy sauce. Good but would have liked a little more heat from the chilies and after eating a few they got a little salty. The  portion was much larger than the risotto. Easily shareable. 

Overall we enjoyed our dinner. However, for me this is a place that I can say been there, done that & probably won't return unless I have out of town guests visiting that are fans of the show.",8Ox2EA8A7FVSzVEM3TRn7Q,0,0,4,q1GdMtqgNvzgUYL9L01zVQ

Cocktails were creative and tasty but all were a bit too tart and needed a touch more simple syrup for balance.

Date and I ordered the lobster risotto to start and the short rib and salmon for entrees. At $24 the lobster risotto appetizer was the worst thing ordered all night. The risotto was bland with bad texture and the small diced butternut squash mixed in was undercooked. The lobster was also underseasoned and overcooked and chewy.

The short rib and jus were very tasty and cooked well but I was not impressed with the sides of the dish. The polenta was nice and creamy with good texture but was also underseasoned. The vegetables were terrible that came with it. Basically steamed vegetables - 1.5 brussel sprouts with a few carrot balls and pearl onions. The was the only dish that I really thought justified the price tag ($34).

The salmon itself was good but the sides were also nothing to write home about. The mac and cheese sides was very creamy and cheesy and worth ordering. The brussel sprouts were also very good (but spicy).

The sticky toffee pudding was definitely the highlight of the meal and had a large portion that we could all share. Chocolate mousse cake tasted like something you could buy at the grocery store. 

The service was wonderful though, perhaps even a little too attentive (ex. asked multiple times to clear our plates when we still weren't finished). You could tell they have been trained well and everyone was very friendly.

Ambience was great as well to mimic the show - I guess that's what you are paying for.",kWSSQLU-zcr2rBX4Bbulag,0,0,3,yqiqM5dHdUKJTilOYBK1Tw

Let me first start off by complimenting the staff from the hostess to the server...BRILLIANT as Chef Ramsay would say ha! I came to Vegas on a Monday last week with my fiancée and stayed until Thursday, I knew I wanted to check this place out because I love the show and have tried his other restaurants in Vegas which is a MUST to check out as well. I messaged the business through Yelp and didn't really expect a response but got one from a World class man by the name of Louie which is the manager. He responded right away and we exchanged messages in a timely manner and asked if I wanted him to put me and my fiancée names down for a reservation. I wasn't really sure what day I wanted cause I wanted to surprise her. Well let's just say I lagged a little and when I tried to book through the website it was full. I was sad but thanks to Louie he actually put me down on the last day before we were leaving Vegas. My fiancée was so excited and when we got there sure enough we were on the list! We got sat right away by the lovely hostess. That's the kind of manager that can make a difference and keep customers coming back. He didn't have to do any of that even if it was a small gesture it meant the WORLD to me and my fiancée and is SO appreciated. I won't forget to mention OTT (yeah you know me)! If you have the good fortune to get this man wait your table then consider yourself a winner in Vegas even if you don't gamble. From the moment we sat down this guy was nothing but class and it felt like I was on a culinary experience tour. He answered all of our questions and educated us on every part of our meal. The food doesn't need any reviewing because let's face it your eating at Gordon Ramsays and EVERYTHING that I've had coming from the brilliance of this man has been nothing less than DELICIOUS. I wanted this review to be about my experience with the staff because without people like them then it wouldn't be so memorable and they deserve praise for what they do on a daily basis. It's not easy working with the public in high volume and ESPECIALLY when they're hungry. Oh and shot out to my Chefs' who made our DELICIOUS food!

Made our reservation, arrived that night, upon entering your basically inside a store where u can purchase Hell's Kitchen souvenirs, waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. First up the staff are great from the hostesses to the food runners to the waiters, simply fantastic. Our waiter Michael R thoroughly went over the entire menu which is not that big. Seating was horrible, it reminded of Lawry's with the open cafeteria feel which i hate unless its a buffet, not appropriate for an upscale expensive restaurant. Tables so close your chair is constantly being hit or you're ducking to accommadate the servers passing by. Now most of the food was delicious, what there was of it. We tried to order a variety so we could get a taste of everything and share. Dinner for 3.
Appetizers
Lobster risotto $24- lobster was over cooked and tough. And was served in the most shallow bowl i have ever seen, it was about 5 spoonfuls.
 Scallops, came with my prixe fix $69 beef wellington dinner-dont be fooled by the pics where it looks like u get 5, they are cut in half so u only get 2 and a half, im so glad our waiter told us this so we could order more apps.
3 sodas $15
Beef wellington only comes 1 way, medium rare, they do not take request, i was hesitant when our waiter informed us of this since that was my main reason for coming, and i dont like my meat bloody. I ordered it anyway it didnt look good because it was so red but it was delicious thanx to the seasoning of the duxelle.
Rack of lamb $39- only 3 pieces but tender and juicy but no flavor.
Braised short ribs $34- this dish was the best for the money, hearty and full of flavor.
Sticky toffee pudding came with my meal-for some reason it was huge, to me this is where they couldve held back it was so big we couldnt even finish it
This is a place with no salt & pepper at the table and the food was soooo lacking in flavor i wish i were one of those ppl that carried seasoning in my purse lol.

Entree - we had the beef Wellington and crispy skin salmon. Wellington was great as ever (we've eaten at GR steak in Paris a number of times, and it's definitely comparable to the ones there). However, the crispy salmon was a disappointment on two levels: 1) the first time it was overcooked, like pretty noticeably overcooked, so I sent it back. 2) the second plate they brought me was cooked fine, but the fish itself had no seasoning. No salt, no pepper, so the fattiness of the fish got to me really quickly. I didn't send the second plate back because the sauce (which was a bit acidic) helped cut through the fattiness of the salmon and gave it flavor, but it still made for a disappointing salmon experience.

Dessert - Ott was super thoughtful and gave us a sticky toffee pudding on the house for my husband's birthday! We weren't expecting it and we're quite delighted, both by the gesture and by the pudding itself. I'm not a fan of toffee, but the toffee pudding was incredible. It's a sweet dessert, but you don't really feel it bc everything just goes so well together.

Wine - both our wines (roscato and Jordan Cab Sauv) were quite good.

If I could give half stars, I would, but since I can't I'm rounding down for the salmon situation. 

Would still come back, and maybe the chefs will be able to catch and fix that issue for the future :]",e0Y5KdL8Yb9fyNQBIXYDlg,0,0,4,pE8anPA2SNBSxMkgzOFBXw

The service was impeccable. Everyone from the hostesses to the wait staff were incredibly nice and very professional. The winner of the most recent season was also on hand to take photos with patrons. We didn't do that, but people were regularly going up to her for pics and she didn't bat an eye.

I had the steak and it was a bit overcooked. I think the steak was something around $35-$45, plus sides are extra (on some dishes). So you would expect darn near perfection - it wasn't. It was dry. But let's face it, you aren't really here for the food, per se. You're here for the experience, and that was pretty fun...even at 3:45.",8rpUyNaiP2gE6p0Zqd1HgA,0,0,4,T_SVAJi7HdXEx_91ehs8aA

1383706,2018-06-07,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My 400th review has got to go to homeboy GR and his newest restaurant on the Las Vegas strip!

Hell's Kitchen has taken the place of where Serendipity used to be outside of Caesar's Palace. The place has been renovated into a super modern and classy looking joint, in true Gordon Ramsay style. When you first walk in, you're greeted by a virtual Chef Ramsay, and you can also see photos of all of the past Hell's Kitchen winners.

The next thing to catch your eye is the open kitchen with chefs dressed in blue and red -- but no, there's no competition happening here. But there was a humble Chef Michelle Tribble -- last season's winner -- doing photo ops with excited diners in between orders.

The food here is exceptional as anyone has come to expect in any GR restaurant. There are his classic staples like beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding as well as a handful of novelties.

Pan seared scallops. Oh my gosh. These are seriously melt-in-your-mouth good. Deliciously charred on the outside and pure nom on the inside.

Beef Wellington. You can't go wrong with this in any of his restaurants. Perfectly cooked medium rare steak wrapped in a thin layer of puff pastry. It's a staple for a reason.

Pineapple Carpaccio. This is worth it just for the 'gram. Sweet and tart pineapple slices come out on a giant tray smoking with dry ice. The coconut sorbet pairs so well and makes this the perfect light and refreshing end to a meal.

Sticky toffee pudding. Each of GR's restaurants has a different take on this classic English dessert. What makes this one special? Speculoos ice cream instead of vanilla. Oh yes. You read that. Speculoos. Like the stuff that your cookie butter dreams are made of. The texture of this pudding is similar to what you would find at his pub inside Caesar's. I do miss the satisfaction of pouring my own sticky toffee sauce all over the pudding though.

HK is the perfect in-between if you don't want a super fancy meal but also don't want something casual. Make a reservation if you can to avoid the lines.",Ok4JzVqlcGmQ0ZzoIld8aA,7,2,5,40d7WZsZDz_Ldci5dahCuQ

We like our steak medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The roasted cauliflower was sprinkled with chili lime gremolata and the potato puree literally melted in your mouth. Our waiter, Charles was exceptional and he made us feel like we were the most important people in the restaurant. The staff's attention to detail was admirable, and they treated all guests with respect. I would highly recommended trying this restaurant out, but be advised that you should try to make a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance. Be prepared to splurge a little especially if you're one of those people who wants to have the full Gordon Ramsey experience.

It was a goal to try as many things as we could to make a fair assessment.  I started with a fruit drink that contained ginger beer, and other additions.  Such a unique taste that I now crave that taste.  A golden beet salad for my wife.  She said it beat every beet salad to date.  I had the red quinoa salad for me.  Again it added to the total meal. Also had the prawns that they flame at the table. Video moment. Then Beef Wellington for my wife.  I also tried it and we both agreed it was beyond belief. Tender, tasty, mushroom infused puff pastry covered prime cut of beef! NY cut steak was so tasty and flavorful cooked beautifully.  Potato puree and cheesy mac just kept adding to the experience. Had to end with a dessert that is not on the menu.  It was shaved pineapple with sorbet and passion fruit foam.  It was the perfecting ending.  Of course coffee was all that.  After photos of the exciting interior and open kitchen.  Meeting the Executive Chef topped it all off.  At least this night, it was a home run.  And not to forget Casey out waiter. Such an asset to Hell's kitchen. Casey explained every item with knowledge of each.  Not pushy, right there when you needed him, as good as a waiter can be. Also thanks to each staff member.

On our 1st time visit, it was less then stellar. The price you pay for food, we expect to have a great experience. It was very medicore. Louie got in touch with me over my review and encouraged us to give them one more shot. We agreed and it was worth it.
We check in with the hostess and you can see a big difference already from our 1st visit. They were more happy and very energetic. We get seated and we get greeted by our server right away. Sadly, I can't remember his name but he was awesome. The busser was also on point and kept our water filled. Skeptical to order the same things, we all tried something new. My father in law got the short rib, my mother in law got the seafood appetizer, my wife got the crispy skin salmon and a casear salad, and I got the Steak and decided to give the fries another shot. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Special Brew from Stone and it was awesome. The short rib was perfect. So flavorful and tender it just melt in your mouth. My father in law was blown away. I don't like seafood so I didn't try my mother in law seafood tower but she was so impressed. She said it was some of the best seafood shes had in Vegas. Flavor and freshness was key. My wife loved her crispy skin salmon. The other things that went with it, really rounded out the meal and balanced the fish. I did take a bite of it and it was really good. Just a bit fishy for me, but I didn't order it. My steak was perfect. I asked for well done and got it the way I wanted. It had nice crisp outside, yet juicy inside. Seasoned perfectly. The demi glaze and wild mushrooms were incredible. The fries did come out crispy but yet again, no seasoning. Maybe they might need a new recipe for their fries. They do seem like maybe they are frozen fries. The busser did run quickly to get me salt and ketchup. Something that I didn't get last visit. Other then the fries, the food was so much better. It was the quality and taste we were hoping for the 1st visit. We ended the meal with 2 desserts to share. The famous toffee pudding with speculous ice cream and the chocolate raspberry mousse torte. WOW!! Awesome and we had the toffee pudding last time and is a rock star. The cool thing this time, we saw managers out on the floor and checking on guests. That was great to see.

I honestly could not find a single fault with tonight's dinner, the service was excellent, the food perfectly cooked, seasoned and plated and the overall atmosphere of the establishment was comfortable and interesting.",o4zLV6H1k_O3bHGi1vFzjw,0,0,5,YA659kKf8Kp-T7zKIXsUtg

This is the best way to describe this place. 

Dear, Chef Ramsey I was very happy to be able to try Hell's Kitchen staple foods (lobster risotto, beef Wellington and the sticky toffee pudding). Everything was excellent!!!!

We had the HK lunch menu with wine pairing and an extra order of lobster risotto. Everything I had was excellent, beautiful presentation and pallet pleasing. 
Staff was very organized and attentive, the bar offers a nice variety of wines, beer and spirits.

I came here for my birthday with my boyfriend. Service was attentive, but it took awhile to order. When you get seated at the table, the server explains the whole menu to you. It was appreciated, but kind of overwhelming. So we had to wait awhile, while our server did the same thing to other tables.

He ordered the prefix menu while I ordered the lobster risotto and the pan seared scallops.

I tried bits of my boyfriend's food. Everything was tasty. The artichoke soup tasted like potato soup to me, but it was flavorful. I like my meat well done. Yeah, what's wrong with me, but I just do. I loved his beef wellington though. It was so soft, and the crust melts in your mouth.

I enjoyed my food, but I didn't love it. The scallops were too overcooked, making it chewy. I did enjoy the sauce that came with it, and gave it a tangy flavor. The risotto was whatever, but the lobster... That was one juicy lobster that melted in my mouth. No butter needed.

My boyfriend mentioned to the server that it was my birthday. She was kind enough to bring out my own toffee pudding, with a candle in it. When I first tried it, I had no words. It was so warm and gooey, with the ice-cream melting in your mouth. I don't even need to try the food. All I need is the toffee pudding, and that's it.

We have been major fans of the show Hell's Kitchen, a fans of Gordon Ramsey and his other Dinning establishments (including his fish n chip take away at the Linq) here in Las Vegas.

We waited a month to get in and we were so excited  to finally eat here. But we won't be back.

Our server was rude and unprofessional, he actually lectured one of our party about how busy they were and we needed to hurry up. Very poor service, the worst we have ever had in a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We have fined at all the Las Vegas locations and the Savoy in London and have enjoyed them all exempt this one.

We ordered menu items made famous on the show.
Our Lobster Risotto was OK at best ( we have had better on cruise ships. 
Our Scallops were over cooked and rubbery, which was surprising because how perfectly cooked scallops is such s big part of the show.
My Beef Wellington was very disappointing considering all the positive reviews the dish has on yelp. 
My wife's strip steak was below par as well. If you have steak on your menu in Vegas it better be great. Especially if you operate a steak house across the street. Like Gordon'sSteak house in Paris casino.
The best part of dinner was the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was great!

We will not be back considering we dropped $500 for a party of four ( without drinks) and could have gone to a chain steakhouse like Outback and gotten a better meal and better service for less than $125.

Very disappointed because we are such big fans of the show, we are locals and won't be back and probably wont watch the show next season because it will remained us of how we wasted $500 on dinner.",JFX7Xxl7mAUSmPALEyEOyQ,1,0,1,dKy5y9P5-UJOhtyaX9z1qQ

So moist and on the cusp of being over sweet but never passing that line. We are Vegas locals so I would love to return and try the rest of the menu. 

The only flaw to our evening that did stand out immensely to both me and my husband was that I let the hostess know when confirming my reservation that we were celebrating a birthday and not one time during the entire evening did anyone acknowledge it.

I have to say that whilst the meal was pretty good, I was slightly disappointed. (A picture & tweet was sent to Gordon Ramsay) - For having a reservation, our wait to be seated was essentially nonexistent. It probably helped that we came slightly early. 

MOMENT OF TRUTH: So as it turns out, after being seated and having a really, really wonderful host & server, putting in our orders, it takes 45+mins for appetizers to even come out. Good thing we ordered drinks. Eventually, the food did start coming out. *** seared scallops, beef wellington, and dessert were part of the pre-fixe menu. 

Drinks: 
Fear & Loathing: A nice sweet smokey drink with Mezcal & various citrus fruits. 
Note from Gordon: A really good drink to have on a hot summer day btw, made with gin, tea, lemongrass, peach & lemon. It's like an adult's lemonade. Also comes with a ""note from Gordon"" which is a nice touch.

Food: 
-Tuna Tartare: It honestly was eaten so fast after I had taken a photo due to a table of 6 very hungry adults - I didn't get to eat ANY. :( I heard it was good though. 
-Pan Seared Scallops: Plated around the plate were the scallops on top of a celery root puree, topped with chives - they were good, not overcooked and chewy which definitely lives up to the restaurant's rep. Middle of the plate were the bacon lardons & pickled granny smith apples - which again, I didn't get to eat because it was all gone right after the picture. 
-Seared Foie Gras: Unfortunately, the foie gras wasn't just seared. It was cooked for so long it lost it's flavor. The outside was definitely overdone & hard whereas the inside with whatever moisture left in it kept it from feeling like biting into crispy bacon. I was looking forward to this A LOT. 
-Beef Wellington: The pastry on the outside was crispy and had a crunch when bitten into while the meat on the inside was perfectly cooked and moist. It was tender and juicy. The potato puree & vegetables with the red wine glace helped cut the meal. It didn't feel too heavy - instead it was a good amount to still be able to walk out and continue the night!
-Braised Short Rib -x2!: within 6 people, we ordered 2 orders & mine with sauteed spinach (I just can't eat the creamy polenta). It was a little bit more on the salty side which I assume the creamy polenta would help since the spinach was basically drowning in it. I'd still order it again - I just love trying different braised short ribs. 
-Roasted Rack of Lamb: I normally don't eat lamb due to fear of excessive gaminess but I have to say that it was not like that here. Yes, there is gaminess but not to the point where I'd need to switch seats at the table (and yes, that has happened before). 


** Overall, food was okay! Not something I'd praise and tell people to go try. I'll definitely try other restaurants of Gordon's in the future but overall it was not a memorable experience.",w7zxiLxFpv7ZhIhdJVdRrQ,2,2,3,XsUEq4yMHZjTzD0WmJjcfg

The open kitchen concept is a great way to see the chefs behind the scenes.  The service from our waitress, Megan, surpassed the standard.  She was pleasant and attentive.  Kudos to Megan!

We started with sharing the Caesar Salad and Pan Seared Scallops Appetizer.  The salad was very large and I'm glad we were sharing it.  The fresh ingredients with a hint of citrus set off the tastebuds.  The scallops were perfectly prepared.  The beautiful presentation of the appetizer enhanced these mouth watering gems.

5 stars for the restaurant itself, it is incredibly beautiful and the tables are comfortable. 

5+ stars for the food. It was incredible. I had seared scallops (amazing), tuna tartare (amazing), and the crispy skin salmon (amazing). The scallops are the best I've ever had and probably ever will have, the tartare was flavorful, and the salmon had crispy skin and was cooked perfectly.  

5 stars for the 'idea' of the service. Let me explain. Our waitress was amazing, she was attentive, helpful, and paid very close attention to us. She asked us if we had plans after dinner that we needed to leave in time for and she was very attentive to my gluten and dairy allergies. Everyone else that we came into contact with at the restaurant was on the same level. Our drinks were never less than half full. 

2 stars for the execution of the service. This is not a knock on the politeness of our waitress or the other staff. Like I previously stated, the staff was great. However, the execution of some of the idea was not great. I ordered all of my dishes without dairy, while the staff was very attentive to this, my appetizer came with a dairy puree that I specifically took off. Of course they replaced it right away, but it was still inconvenient. One server set entrees down on our table that were pretty close to what we ordered but realized it wasn't for us and took them away and placed them on the table next to us. It was strange and seemed hygienically off. Lastly, although our waitress asked when we needed to leave, we hadn't had our dessert or gotten the check and had to ask for both 5-10 minutes before we had to leave. 

Overall, it was a great dinner. There are some service issues that they need to workout before the full launch at the end of the month.",Jnd9Vaj5GI_y8PdiyvhmtQ,4,0,4,jTX7dGXlnVgjoQrfRpX9CA

We had a reservation (a must around here) and were seated within a few moments at a wonderful table for two near the windows. The giant windows facing the strip give a natural light to the place that makes everything feel fresh and cheery. Our waiter David was kind, patient and did a great job keeping the food coming at just the right moments. 

After some mixed reviews on the wellington, we decided to go another route and we were NOT disappointed. The food could have been served on a paper plate and it would have still been incredible.
We planned to keep room for dessert, but the Red Quinoa Salad, Roasted Cauliflower and Chicken were all so filling - and we shared each dish! 
The Red Quinoa Salad was light, refreshing, and so filling. My mom thought it was a dessert at first sight. 
I'm not a huge fan of chicken, but this dish may have just changed my mind! The sauce, potatoes and mushrooms, oh my! They were tasty accompaniments to the perfectly broiled chicken. The chicken was not dry in the least, it was juicy and flavorful! 
The Roasted Cauliflower with lime zest was good, but not my favorite. It was a little to raw for my taste, but it was still good.
We intended to come back for the Sticky Toffee Pudding, but just didn't make it on this trip - one more reason to come back!!
We accompanied our meal with a glass of Clean Slate Riesling and Achaval Malbec, both good and decent pours.

Finally, let me make a few things clear, and maybe this will help you decipher other reviews as well.
1. You need a reservation! But even still you may wait a few moments after arriving, reservations and dining are not an exact science.
2. Everyone has a bad day, give the hostess and waitstaff a break. Could you keep a smile and joyful attitude all day while serving high expectation, (maybe) entitled & in a rush diners?",xvPKsTGO5GljzRTGc9VC_g,0,1,5,UG06i96pol5IrOm4lLrGOA

The other plus, was the beef wellington as well as the scallops.  Both were excellent. Now for the down side. Price was definitely on the high side compared to many other upscale restaurants in the area, but what you would expect on the strip. Speaking of prices, was the price of wines. No bottle of wine was less than $50, in addition was the price of wine by the glass. We decided to each have a glass of Melbac for $17 each. I don't mind playing that knowing where I was, but when our waitress poured our wine from the bottle, it was only at 3 ounces at best. When I mentioned that I didn't think that was an adequate pour, she mentioned our method of pouring was two quick pours in the glass .Really?? Definitely would have been better to get a bottle than by the glass. The Lobster Risotto was too salty as other people around us noted the same thing. As for clientele, many were tourist of course, but it would be nice if they dressed accordingly. It was a mixed bag, as most were in shorts and jeans.

Our orders & reviews: 1) lobster risotto: delicious; portion was a little small (but only because we all wanted to try some); braised short ribs: a perfectly portioned, mouthwatering dish; peanut butter fudge cheesecake: although this dessert appeared a little small we realized it was small because it packed such a punch and didn't need to be big 2) caesars salad: a perfectly prepared classic; filet mignon: prepared to a perfect medium, as requested, and delicious 3) shrimp cocktail: delicious; New York strip: one of the best I've ever eaten 4) prix fixe menu (2 of us ordered): scallops: size was small but taste was HUGE; beef wellington: now we know why the scallop portion was small--the beef wellington was easily one of the best dishes either of us have ever eaten. This was the same sentiment shared by everyone at the table! And then there was the sticky toffee pudding. I don't think I can come up with appropriate words to describe this decadence!

My wife and I are fans of the show. I called the day they opened and reserved a table for Friday March 23rd for our anniversary dinner. It was our 'main event' for going to vegas.

When we arrived we were so excited to see the beauty of the layout and we peeked around the corner and got giddy when we saw Michelle working.

We were less than excited that despite our early booking, we were put at a table in the back of the house, where we couldn't see the kitchen.

The napkins are beautiful (we stole one) and decor is top notch, suited for high end crowds. The crowds, however, are typically noisy and underdressed. 

The female wait staff wears beautiful elegant red dresses, and are friendly. Our waiter, nick, was great at first.

Lobster risotto and scallop appetizers started us off strong. Loved them. Great flavor and texture. Wish we could've had more. My cocktail was too strong but its vegas.

I ordered the Wellington and my wife ordered the NY Strip. This is where it went sour. Her ny strip was good, but not great. Like what I cook at home. You can taste the grill, like it wasn't cleaned well.

The beef Wellington looks amazing but is lacking major key ingredients. I'm sure to the less knowledgeable it's passable but: there was no mustard on the filet, there was BARELY any ham/prosciutto, and the amount of mushroom duxelle was pathetic. When I took my first bite I could tell there was no flavor, and when I opened it up it made me so disappointed. 

When I asked the waiter, nick, of this he waived it off as normal and that's how they're made. No... I've made ramsay's Wellington recipe. It's not this.

It seems like the food they cook is more for presentation and profit, but they rely on their guests to be ignorant of actual flavor. If chef Ramsay reads this, take that recipe and SHUT IT DOWN.

We ordered brussel sprouts with it. They were good but overcooked. We ate 1/3 and quit.

Now, back to nick... after I voiced my concern, he virtually disappeared. Our wait times between menus were epic. We even had to flag a busser for more water.

I typically tip over 20% but this time I struggled to give 10% sorry to all the hard working staff sharing tips but nick needs retraining. 

At the end we got our guts together and interrupted Michelle hard at work for a picture. She is so gracious and kind to comply. Thank you Michelle :)

1813361,2018-02-11,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I have always enjoyed Chef Ramsey's shows. After going to Chicken Pharm ( a play on word since for 100 years it was a family owned Pharmacy) in Petaluma, I said to my husband ""Where is Chef Ramsey when we need him !""  Petaluma, known as the Butter and Egg Capitol for years was  finally opening a Chicken restaurant ! Everyone was definitely excited ! Well, a tragedy is an understatement... On yelp it has four pages of reviews - maybe 2 or 3 comments are good, the rest are terrible - sad but true ! Fried chicken cooked way too long - dark on the outside, dry on the inside.. yikes!  Everything is ala carte and cooked too long or just unpalatable.  I could only wish Chef Ramsey would help the poor owners get on their feet - it has only been open for 5 or so months but not improved at all.

We arrived a little early for our reservation and they told us it would be about 15 minutes. People keep coming in and getting seats almost instantly without reservations. I ask why and I got a little attitude from the girls working at the front who told me they would seat us at our reservation time. They could have said that before we waited more than 30 minutes. 

Drink orders arrived and were wrong at first, then the beer took forever and a day to come out. 

Ok enough of the negative because the food is where all the positives were. Also, the restaurant is set up so you can see everything going on in the kitchen. So cool! 

Margherita Pizza And a side of fries- my daughter and I split this. It was so so so good! The pizza crust was so perfectly salty and garlicky and just the right amount of cheese and tomatoes. The fries were a perfect crisp and my daughter, the ketchup lover, didn't even need ketchup they were so good. 

Salmon- my husband got the salmon and said it was cooked just right. Seasoned flawlessly with a nice salad to compliment. 

Sticky toffee pudding- we ordered 2 cuz we don't like to share and it's one of the main reasons we came. So amazing! I liked the one at his Steak restaurant but this seemed even better. So moist, very nice with the ice cream.",YfcXpAQtz0n84aqw_CtNvw,0,0,4,3ejDwCVKfeRzYD9HDAxnkQ

1828435,2018-05-22,4,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"It's no secret that I'm a huge fan Chef Ramsay. Throughout the years, I've followed Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares. When I planned my trip to Vegas, Hell's Kitchen was at the top of my list. HK is located at Caesar's Palace and can be seen from The Strip. As you walk towards the front, you're greeted by the HK and pitchfork fire display and that's definitely a place you want to take a picture. As you enter the restaurant, there's a large TV screen, about the size of door, and Chef Ramsay is there to greet you and it's quite amusing. The walls are decorated with the portraits of all the Hell's Kitchen winners. 

Let's get to the food! The menu is quite simple, there's a few options for every course. We began with the Scampi Prawn Flambe and it was beyond amazing. The prawns are brought out and they flambe the dish at the table so you get a little show before you dig in. The prawns are seasoned in a garlic white wine sauce and butter. I would recommend getting two of these because one is just not enough! 

For the entrees, my father ordered the famous Beef Wellington and I had the Filet. The Beef Wellington is truly the signature dish at HK. The chefs will only cook it medium rare because this type of beef needs to be tender in order to bring out the flavor of the meat. I had half of the Wellington and it was way more flavorful than my Filet. There was issues with my filet and unfortunately I had to send it back. I always order my steaks medium rare but when it arrived at the table, it was well done. I was also not impressed with the thickness and size of the filet. I looked at the table next to ours and their filet was double the size so I did make it known to our server. When it came back, it was cooked more to a medium but I was starving and I didn't want to send it back again. My advice, stick to the Beef Wellington!

For dessert, we ordered a Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Pineapple Carpaccio. I have never seen a dessert like the pineapple carpaccio, it is one of the most original presentations I have ever seen. They bring out the fruit on a glass dish and they pour dry ice into the bowl beneath the dish and it creates a cloud of what looks like liquid nitrogen. The fruit is sliced thinly and it's a must have! The stick toffee pudding was rich and sponge-like. After a heavy meal, both desserts hit the spot.

In terms of service, it was a bit spotty. Our server, John, was nervous but he apologized multiple times for the confusion with the entrees. He was very nice and attentive and I don't blame him for the problems in the kitchen. The kitchen is open so you get to see what's going on in both red and blue kitchens. When I made the reservation, I mentioned it was my dad's 85th birthday and no one said anything nor did they compliment my dad and that was disappointing. Service for me is just as important as food quality so that's why I deducted a star. Prices are what you would expect, expensive! Be prepared to dish out at least $200 for two people. If you're not a fan of Hell's Kitchen, then as Chef Ramsay would say...Fuck off you donkey!",29LapB2kzCj0dwGjJ_aX6g,7,5,4,djMGzMeiGeXx7FCwmuZQJA

Gordon Ramsay would say about his own staff serving cold food, ""IT'S COLD YOU ARSE!"" (slams plate on the floor or smashes it against the chef's chest).  This is primarily what I remember along with SERVING APPETIZERS BEFORE THE ENTREE!!!!  I can hear Gordon now, ""GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN YOU FOOL!  GET OUT NOW!   WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING THERE?!  Beef Wellington was ok with the exception of it being COLD!  Crispy skinned salmon was prepared well, nicely seasoned and moist.  Too bad it was cold.  The only thing that was not cold because the chefs probably waited until it was done, was the charcuterie pizza.  Nice and crispy crust with lots of meat and a full onslaught of prosciutto on top.  By far the hottest entree, if you will.

OK, now on to the appetizers. Yes you are not misreading this...the appetizers came out after the entrees were served!  Pan seared scallops would have been delectable if they weren't COLD!  Lobster risotto was very good with lots of lobster laid on top of the risotto was, I imagine, fantastic with the exception of being....C.O.L.D.  

Moving on to desserts.  Sticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream.  Delicious cake like...and it's hot!  

Gordon, if you are reading these reviews, tell your staff to get it together or GET OUT! If you are paying your chef $250,000, they need to do better. If you're in hell, everything has got to be hot!  This time NOT!  Red team fail, blue team fail, at Hell's Kitchen.",hfebkPlF25jZUqsuyZZfbg,0,0,3,72D95HtC0fmPyNAE2ND_Xw

2003300,2018-02-28,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"At first, I wasn't impressed. Obviously, the restaurant was made for the fans of the show. My wife being a fan wanted to try the foods that the chefs on the show are demanded to make.
The exterior, just like the show, you are welcomed by a huge HK and pitchfork (photo op). Once you enter you are then greeted by a whole bunch HK merch and video playback of Chef Ramsay welcoming you to the restaurant. 
So far I feel like I'm waiting in line for theme park restaurant for mediocre food. Because the whole atmosphere is geared to seek the pleasure of the audience and begging for their attention - look at me or buy me and a group of hostesses looking pretty, but not too friendly like the cashiers at The Varsity (a fast food place in Atlanta, Ga famous for their unfriendly service).

However, after being seated we were impressed. The interior was pretty grand. Low lighting in the dining area and spotlight on display of the open kitchen, as if you were there for a show. The chefs were already assigned to their groups, either red or blue. It wasn't a competition - they were just cooking. You can also observe the executive chef keeping quality control over whatever dishes came out. And along the side of the kitchen counter, there were servers lined up to carry out approved dishes to their customers.   

That night my wife and I had the pleasure of ordering, HK signature prix fixe menu ($69) and an entree roasted rack of lamb ($39). 
The prix fixe menu consists of three courses. 
First - choice of pan seared scallops or caesar salad 
Second (main course) - beef wellington
Third (dessert) - sticky toffee pudding

Dinner, food - finally! Wow is what I'd like to say. I believe the hype now and why Chef Ramsay makes such a big deal over his foods. I mean we already knew how seriously he took his foods when we had the pleasure of dining at his 3 Michelin Star restaurant in London (Restaurant Gordon Ramsay) and watching his shows, however, I didn't expect it for a show/ commercial kitchen. 

Scallops seared and seasoned perfectly. Yes, the scallops were not sent back for being raw!

The beef wellington perfect medium rare with the flaky outer crust. The first bite melts in your mouth with the sensational collage of taste of truffles and mustard. 

The rack of lamb, also perfect medium rare with the savory taste from the lamb jus. And if you're afraid of trying lamb because of the gamey taste ... fear not. This lamb does not taste like so. 

Finally, the dessert - the sticky toffee pudding. Damn ... this was it. I feel like cursing because it was that good. My wife and I aren't dessert people. We don't really eat sweets but for the sake of the dining experience, we do from time to time. But man! This toffee pudding was damn good. One bite we had to sit back and take in what we just ate. 

If I were to describe the taste I would say it is the perfect blend of sweet and savory in a spongy smooth blend of bread and toffee. The dessert was warm and moist to the last bite. 

Throughout the night my cousin who works at the Caesar Palace restaurants (Director of Wine ... don't know the official title) greeted us and brought us a bottle of champagne and briefly talked and ran to a meeting. 

Overall, dinner experience - spectacular. 

We would definitely come back when we are back in Vegas.",l_oIwrcTxhE4kQv5Z8sMGw,4,5,5,xezx8hAEg0JS129UCsiTzw
2005312,2018-04-08,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My friend, Trina told me about this restaurant before the trip and I was down to try it. So before booking our trip to Vegas. I make reservation with the yelp app and got us reservation on Saturday at 10:45pm. I know. I know. Too close to closing but that is the only reservation they had left and we had to book it. 


We parked our car at Bellagio's (free parking if your hotel is in any of the MGM businesses) only a couple of minutes to walk over to the restaurant. Upon arriving a little bit early, we decided to head in and check in with the host (we got there at 10:17pm) and I told the hostess my name and the party number, but I also told her it's okay if the table isn't ready; we can wait until our RVSP time. She was totally okay with it and said that they would call us when it's ready. Within a couple of minutes, the table was ready and we were good to go. (Great customer services by the way) 


Trina, Michelle and I, didn't want to order three of the fix menu since that would be too much food for us so we order one appetizer (Lobster Risotto $24), one fix menu which was seared scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding and we order another dessert peanut butter cheesecake.

2009915,2018-02-28,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"MY 100th REVIEW!! 
4-4.5 stars overall. Being a fan of the show, it wasn't necessarily what I was expecting, but I wasn't necessarily disappointed either. 

3/5 for host service. With four hostesses on the floor for a lunch service, I felt the check in process was a little awkward and passive. Our request for a window table, or at least table in the room overlooking the strip was not accommodated, which was disappointing on top of the fact that we waited roughly an additional 10 mins past our reservation time. When our name was called we could barely hear the hostess because she wouldn't elevate her voice in a crowded lobby. I maybe understood a quarter of what she said as she walked us to the table highlighting features of the restaurant because she was facing away from us and speaking towards the loud, full dining room. Not a great first impression. 

As the host/hostess, lobby and facility appearance/upkeep loosely falls under your job in my opinion. When I went to the restroom, the floors were wet and both trash bins were overflowed with trash on the ground. Cleanliness wise, it was on par with fast food restrooms. While it may not be directly their job to correct it, I would think the host staff would make a point to check more frequently. I did inform the hostesses and they did seem concerned so hopefully it was just a one time slip up. 

6/5 for dining room service. Our server, Dion, was wonderful. Much more informative on the restaurant and menu recommendations. His perfect service acumen is one thing; I would expect that from any server in the restaurant, but his warmth and passion for his role in the guest experience is exemplary. He was so understanding and helpful when I had to step away from the table, then genuinely followed up with me after returning. He made a point to connect with us on a personal level and you could tell he values his guests.

5/5 for food and drinks. I mean, did you expect anything else from a Ramsay establishment? Since it was lunch, we went simple with burgers and they were amazing. I had the spicy burger; it had just the right heat level to keep any spice lover diving back in for another bite without being overwhelming. The fries are also beyond reproach. Perfect size, perfect crispness, perfect seasoning. The menu features several of the offerings from the original restaurant. I will definitely be back to try the lobster risotto! 

After a long party weekend, I didn't sample any of the cocktails but did have their fresh brewed iced tea served with house made agave syrup on the side to flavor to your taste- a very nice detail which speaks to the quality of everything produced in the bar or kitchen. 

4/5 for ambiance. It is a unique dining room, obviously designed to show off the kitchen, but the view is pretty obstructed unless you're sitting at the front tables. The space is bright, clean, and masculine. The seating was also very nice and comfortable. The only negative is it's very loud and has terrible acoustics which is what unfortunately left the biggest impression.",PVB0ggrspa1wWUECI7BN6w,9,10,4,I6eJVvDLhC1ypI_WIIPGlw

2021485,2018-06-29,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"You know the story about the emperor has no clothing... let me be that kid and tell you how it really went for us and as you read below,  this isn't our case but a anyones who is not considered an mvp (there are many tables like it so this can be very relevant to you)

We went to the restaurant for the experience of Hells Kitchen,  not just the food. The food was ok (lunch tome) but if you wanted for example the famous beef welington,  you had to order a full meal. 
I cant recall what it cost, it wasn't cheap but I was annoyed on how it was forced as part of a larger meal I didn't want to have. 
But I admit that at that point I was already very  annoyed due to the seating arrangement. 

 So let's get back to that, we went for family celebrations , to enjoy the experience.  The place looks great, just like on TV. 
There were plenty of tables in front of the kitchen   the main decor and attraction of the restaurant.  The host took us through all those empty tables but never stopped till we got all the way to the back, behind a wall that abscur the entire view, with dozen of other guests. 
I was surprised so I asked the host why she took us all the way to the back and not give us proper seat? ... I was blown away by the answer ""we keep those tables for VIPs "" - I was pissed. This place is expensive,  it charge for the name and experience yet somehow they decided we, common people, don't deserve to experience it. 
Even airlines treat thier passengers  more fairly.  

I have to say that rude answer ruined the experience for me.
So my tip/warning to you: don't buy into those beautiful pictures of the kitchen.  You might be seated behind a wall and see nothing. I should have taken a picture of the wall but you know ... a wall is a wall, you don't need to go to help kitchen to see how that looks. 
Btw: I did share my feedback with the restaurant and didn't bother to care. After all... I am not an mvp",ZZnPZjNGJFaZEJlxgvb2bQ,0,0,2,V1O2QkwdaMVEaMtbXob2kw

however, I was a bit disappointed with the lobster rissoto and the braised short ribs. The rissoto was cooked well, however it was lacking in flavor and the lobster was a bit rubbery, and the short ribs were too dry, and lacked flavor as well.

The interior is roomy and bright, love seating next to the big windows and people watch, but downside is that photo taking is challenging with a bright background. 

We didn't try the tasting menu as the items seemed not too creative for a whole $60, but you'll miss trying their beef wellington.  We ordered seafood tower, lobster risotto and charcuterie pizza instead.  The seafood tower looks nice with custom made HK's holder.  The seafood contains 2 shrimps, 2 oysters, 2 clams, 2 pieces of crab legs and 2 pieces of lobster (a tail and a claw). For $49 bucks, I think it's average.  The seafood didn't taste particularly fresh or juicy, so just average.  

The lobster risotto has good cooking on the lobster, just wish the rice is a bit softer.  

The pizza is ok, loaded with varieties of meat and cheese, but again, you can't go wrong with a pizza, so average.

It is different than other Ramsay Las Vegas restaurants. Do not kid yourself, the purpose of this one is to make money........I know all of them have this purpose but this one it screams at you even before you walk in. ** Met Michelle Tribble the HK season 17 winner. Took a picture with her and she signed a Ramsay HK cookbook for us. She was very nice / professional. She is a teeny tiny person which from seeing her on the show surprised me. I didn't think she was 6'5"" and 250 but she is really tiny.
So we are big fans of all of Ramsay's TV shows and his personality knowing it is all an act for sensationalizing and promoting ratings. We know. We have eaten at all 5 of his Vegas restaurants multiple times. So, we go to HK. 8:45 pm and it is packed as expected. We get seated and order our beverages and food. Lobster Risotto and Scallops for appetizers. Both good. Scallops were small I think they cut them in half and they are not  the big jumbo sea scallops but smaller. Dinner entrees were Beef Wellington and Short Ribs. Both were excellent. Side Mac and cheese was so so and Brussels sprouts were good. 4 1/2 stars not 5 because of  we did not order alcohol but it was heavily pushed on us multiple times. (money?). Bill was 240.00 with tip....very reasonable by Vegas standards. THE BIG DEDUCTION for me is the same as Gordon Ramsay Steak. TURN DOWN THE DAMN MUSIC. IT IS OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD AND VERY ANNOYING. IT IS WAY OVER THE THRESHOLD OF ACCEPTABLE. There must be some market research that has been done about this showing loud music and peoples dining habits with it.

One of the nice things is they didn't pack in the tables like they could have so there was good spacing between the seating. We had a nice gentleman, by the name of Alexander that took great care of us. Amongst a party of three we had the quinoa salad, lobster risotto, the Beef Wellington, potato gratin, roasted cauliflower and sticky toffee pudding desert. The Beef Wellington was pretty incredible - we were told they will only serve it medium rare - the filet was prepared perfectly - very tender with the nice flakey crust. The lobster risotto was a very nice dish - for the sides the potatoes were nothing special but the cauliflower was good. Side dishes are good for max 3 people. We were impressed with the quinoa salad and of course the sticky toffee pudding was a yummy conclusion to a nice meal. Pricing I thought wasn't bad for a restaurant 'on the Strip' the Wellington was about $49 and was shared by two people - a good sized filet - I would say maybe 8oz? Side dishes were $9 and pudding $12 - so pretty reasonable in my opinion. Chef Michelle from the tv show is there and many people were taking photos.

Though the service wasn't all that quick it gives diners the opportunity to enjoy the atmosphere. The few items on the menu are served beautifully with sizzling taste. The shrimp cocktail was delicious and I ordered the bricked pressed chicken and it was the perfect texture! And if you're wanting to add some extra flavor go for the baked mac and cheese! The ideal comfort food meal! The most current  season's winner is here as well for the next year!

2132705,2018-03-25,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I am a big fan of the Hell's Kitchen so when I found out an actual restaurant was opening up, I was all over it. I figured dining at the actual restaurant would be the closest I get to being a diner on the show. Believe, I have been trying to get on the show for years. Gordon, please help me out! Lol

Our reservation was at 8, so we arrived a little early. Hell's Kitchen was popping as I expected. We were seated at a table in the center dining room in front the kitchen. I highly recommend that when you make a reservation, you ask to be seated in the area. It is part of the experience. Also, be aware that the noise level is high as well. Not really conducive for conversation, but part of the experience.

The menu is simple. Pretty much what was cooked on the show is cooked and served here. There is also a prix fix menu, but I recommend staying away from that. You don't get to experience all that Hell's Kitchen has to offer unless you order off the regular menu. Since there was 4 people in my party, that allowed for multiple things to be ordered and shared. 

For starters, we ordered 2 lobster risottos, 1 steak tartare, 1 foie gras. For our mains, we had 2 Wellingtons, and two racks of lamb. Truth be told, probably the best meal of my life. I went in to this dining experience at Hell's Kitchen with no expectations and was blown away. 

The detail that the wait staff and host staff puts into there work is incredible. The detail that is paid to just setting the table is incredible. I commend them for their hard work and dedication. 

As a side note, getting to Hell's Kitchen is an adventure. Try to park at the main hotel valet....if you can. All I will tell you is the valet may be full, but cash is still king in Vegas. I think you know what I mean. Hell's Kitchen is a short walk from the main valet. It is right off The Strip as well. 

I don't go to Vegas very often, but when I do, I am definitely going back to Hell's Kitchen.",hdha6G3od9ZFd6x1SLwxhw,4,0,5,dDJeDli3K5tRr6DmoDQPQw

My friend had his concierge from his AMEX book the Resturant for a party of 8, due to someone else's cancellation. We were really hoping to see Gordon Ramsey there, the staff said he was just there a day earlier presenting his motivational  speech. It would've been a nice birthday to be able to meet Gordon Ramsey, but overall we had an awesome experience. Service was great.

We ordered 4 prefix to share for our party, some sides, and drinks. 

Seared Scallops- 5 scallops on the plate, perfectly seared, and certainly can tell the scallops were fresh. 

Ceasar Salad- not over dressed. Lightly mixed in. 

Beef Wellington-heard this was their specialty, glad to have half of this and was able to try the rest. The meat was perfectly cooked not too hot but warm made it nice to just take a bite right away. Pastry was nicely thin and crisp hugging the juicy beef. Just perfect. 

Sticky Toffee Pudding- ice cream was nicely paired with the pudding cake, we were already stuffed and couldn't finish this, it was super delicious. 

Baked Macaroni and Cheese- can go wrong with this, small portion but enough to share for small bites. 

Brussels Sprouts- nicely crisp like Pringles chip. 

Potato Gratin- small portion but didn't finish this, glad we ordered just one to share for our party, everything was delicious. 

Wagyu Meatballs- had two orders of this highly recommend. Came with 5 marinated meatballs. 

Lobster Risotto- Amazing, never had a whole lobster risotto like that before. Lobster itself was delicious alone and fresh, and the risotto extended the lobster high. Great for seafood lovers. 

Scampi Prawn Flambé- presentation was amazing. 
Prawns were exceptionally delicious and fresh. Came with 3 large prawns on fire. 

Overall experience was wonderful, we were able to take pictures with the chef, and also a little birthday dessert was added towards the end.",Rpd_62-E8IffzX8ig-26Ew,14,14,5,RY8yc6D0V7HAtAc_Al-11g

I had to get the Smoke On The BLVD because of the way they bring it out to you. (See attached video) The taste was exceptional! I would go back to HK just for this drink.

On to the food. We shared 2 appetizers, the Lobster rissotto and the wagyu meatballs. The rissotto is like heaven in your mouth. For dinner, I went with the prix fixe menu. First course you can choose either a ceasar salad or pan seared scallops. I got the scallops and they were delish! For the main course you'll get the beef wellington. I was soo full by this time that I only ate half and took the rest to-go. And for dessert the sticky toffee pudding. Our server Carlos was great.

2159737,2018-02-14,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"First of all, reservations are very hard to come by here, so plan ahead. I heard they're pretty booked through June.  There are random times that are available and you may get lucky checking day of for a spot that opened up. They also have seating at the bar which was completely full when we arrived at 5:30, but we found a couple of spots when we came back later for drinks at 9:30. 

We were fortunate to get a reservation at 5:30 on Sunday, but did have a little trouble finding the way to the entrance. We had our Uber driver drop us off at Caesars and then we cut across the circle driveway towards Hells kitchen, but didn't see a pathway. There is a pathway to the left of the fountains or you can walk along the outside of Caesars heading south and walking past Absinthe to get in the front door. That seems to be the most direct route. Just don't try a short cut like we did!

We were seated right away and given the choice of two tables. There are some tables with strip or fountain views, so you may want to request to reserve those. The space is open and modern. We had a tabletop right by a pillar and there was. I other table right next to us, so it felt a little private. 

Dana was our server and she was excellent. She went over the menu with us and made recommendations and suggested alternatives when needed (the Wellington sounded great, but I don't like my meat rare). I could see her working a lot of tables, but she was on top of the service and friendly. 

We started with cocktails:  Smoke on the Boulevard (such a cool presentation...everyone around us was checking it out) and Notes from Gordon and enjoyed both. 

For appetizers, we did the smoked beets (unique presentation) and lobster risotto. Our entrees were the Beef Wellington and Short Rib. We ordered a side of Mac and Cheese, but the entrees came with small sides and we ended up stuffed. All of the food was so delicious!  I honestly didn't think we'd be able to eat one more bite, but Dana told us we couldn't miss the sticky toffee pudding and there's always room for dessert. She was right!  Don't skip that!  

We had to leave by 7:15 for a show, but we enjoyed our experience so much that we came back for another drink at the bar after the show. Another Smoked Boulevard and Chef's Stew which caught my attention when I saw it earlier. Love a cool presentation!

2166248,2018-02-20,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Gordon Ramsay and was so excited to eat at his restaurant on my trip to Vegas this weekend! The hostesses were so pleasant and very helpful. We got stuck in really bad traffic and were running late, but they made sure that we still got to dine at the restaurant and were really nice to us. 

We finally got seated and introduced to our waiter...not sure if he was having a bad day or if this is just how he always is, but we all felt like he was annoyed at us. Whenever we would ask a question he'd talk to us in the most condescending tone and it was extremely uncomfortable. All other servers that helped us (the server who filled our water glasses, the ones that brought us our food, etc.) were so nice and attentive to our questions. They never made us feel incompetent, but unfortunately our waiter did. It wasn't until the end that he was all smiles with us and trying to joke around, which just doesn't look good for a waiter to do. It really felt like he was trying so hard to be nice so that we'd leave a good tip. I am so disappointed. Part of the dining experience at any restaurant is the service. I expected EXCELLENT service being that I was dining at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and that is not what I received. 

The food was really good. We ordered from the prix fixe menu which came with Scallops, Beef Wellington, and Sticky Toffee Pudding. The scallops were to die for!! The Beef Wellington was flavored perfectly, but we were expecting the shell to be more crispy and flaky. It was too doughy for our liking. The sticky toffee pudding perfect. So delicious and satisfying! We also ordered the mac & cheese as a side. It was good, but nothing to write home about. 

Overall, I wish the waiter had been nicer to us. It really put a dent in our experience. I feel that we didn't get to enjoy it as much as we would have if we'd had a different waiter.",x-RAoXQb5cZjWuWX1wMRJw,0,0,3,gkC_ecstM33md-JcItUutw

2176449,2018-01-29,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I'm a huge foodie and was so excited to try this out. We had reservations for Sunday lunch as this was a busy weekend and we couldn't get in at night. This is a hot and new restaurant so we couldn't wait to see what all the buzz was about.

Our server Barbara was excellent. Very attentive. She had a helper and food runners so she was free to attend to her tables. Excellent service from her. 

They were out of the ingredients for the drink my husband ordered so he just had water. 

I wanted to try the Wellington but we've eaten so much steak over the weekend and we were getting ready to fly out so we opted for lighter fare. Based on other reviews, I see now this was a big mistake. The burgers and Wellington have rave reviews. 

We ordered the seafood tower, scallops, and Caesar salad and sticky toffee pudding.

I'm assuming that they use their green romaine for the burgers and all hearts of romaine for Caesar. If you're looking for a green Caesar, this salad is not for you. The Parmesan wedges are lemony perfection.

After our salad, we waited and waited and waited. Seafood has such a short Cook time and the clams and oysters are served in the shell so we were surprised it took well over 30 minutes to get our food. When they did bring it out, we were so excited to see it coming but they delivered it to our neighbors table. The manager was so proud to deliver the food and apologized to our neighboring table. They said it wasn't their food and he was very confused. We motioned that it was ours, so he grabbed it from their table and placed it on ours with no apology. With the recent flu outbreak and so much brouhaha over our dish, I was a little grossed out. But we were starving and needed to get to the airport shortly. We didn't have another half hour to wait on fresh and properly cooked seafood.

It is a beautiful presentation. Handcrafted boat. By the way, the tableware and linens are lovely except for the dishes which remind me of a bathtub that needs reglazing. They seem to be porous which caused me to wonder about sanitation. 

The lobster was over cooked and couldn't be cut with a knife. Very hard to chew.
The king crab was over cooked and very mealy. 
The shrimp were very large and steamed/boiled perfectly. They were the star of the show. We are from Louisiana via Boston and we KNOW how Seafood is supposed to be served. This dish did not make the mark. Far too expensive to gamble on. 

The scallops were thin and over cooked. The sauce and bacon/apple accoutrement was excellent but not sufficient to revive the dead scallops.

We finished with sticky toffee pudding which was the star of the show. Highly recommend. The ice cream to sponge ratio was a little off -needed a wee bit more ice cream but the flavor and texture was remarkable. 

There's so much good food in Las Vegas for less money. You shouldn't have to pay $$$$ for average and over cooked food. 

We're happy to say we tried it and can check it off our list.

2191488,2018-03-02,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Let me start off by saying that, i was totally and utterly impressed. 
Been a Hells Kitchen superfan ever since the show began back in 2005 and this was a TRUE HELLS KITCHEN EXPERIENCE ...
well.. minus Chef Ramsay not being onsite on the date we visited 2/18 but thats okay! 

My husband and i had the pleasure of being sat right upfront and center facing the kitchen. Definitely a plus and in huge thanks to extremely accomodating manager, Manny.

We had an appetizer, entree, and dessert each! not too mention also having very unique and creative libations. They are as follows:

APPETIZERS
1) Scampi Prawn Flambe: They put a fire show on your place that is quite the show! if that wasnt enough, dip the prawns into the garlic white wine sauce and drawn butter and this dish melts in your mouth! 
Hands down one of the best appetizers we had EVER had. 
As a side note: i do not like seafood at all but i loved this dish ! 

2) Wagyu Meatballs: Very filling,and the mixture of roasted tomato sauce, polenta croutons, parmesan cheese, and basil make this dish a very well rounded dish. 
side note: i dont recommend this dish ONLY if you are choosing the beef wellington as an entree. You will have no space for dessert or maybe you can take a chance like me! 

ENTREES
1) Beef Wellington: Cooked to perfection (at a medium rare cook) but that is the way Chef Ramsay wants it cooked and that is the way i had it. 
The red wine demi glaze potato puree make this all time favorite... OUTSTANDING!
A true Hells Kitchen Classic! 

2) Lobster Risotto: Another Hells Kitchen classic that DOES...NOT disappoint. Each bite with compliments of the butternut squash and sage is HEAVENLY. The lobster just falls apart and it is just SAVORY and unlike any other. I highly suggest pairing this dish with a pinot noir or a cebernet sauvignon 

DESSERT
1) Sticky Toffee Pudding: Just talking about this dessert as i am writing this review makes my mouth water. It is brought out very warm and this dish is complimented by speculoos ice cream. Cut into this dessert, have a bite, and you will know what dessert Heaven has tasted like. 
Truly a favorite and the best dessert i have ever had !

LIBATIONS
1)Notes from Gordon. Deliciously refreshing and it comes with its very own Chef Ramsays note. it's something to look forward to and perhaps souvenir. 

2) Rum Donkey. Cruzan single barrel rum with ginger beer and brown sugar, the mixture of rum and ginger is very odd but is divine! and lets not forget that this drink comes on with a small fire show too of torched passion fruit! 

3) Smoke on the BLVD. It comes to you in a wooden glass box and your server opens it up for you. As this happens, smoke comes out and behold.. SMOKE ON THE BLVD. very, very unique. This is hands down my favorite drink on the blvd. It is very strong but it is very worth it  you've...been ...warned!

I am extremely grateful for the opening of this restaurant, have nothing but respect for Chef Gordon Ramsay and would love to thank Manager Manny and our server who provided us with amazing customer service on an unforgettable night!

2196208,2018-04-06,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Solid 5 stars for service service service!!!
David S was our server both times we dined here and he is outstanding. 
He is knowledgeable about food, wine, and cocktails. 
He's friendly, attentive, and kind. 
The rest of the service staff was also outstanding, from the food runners to the bussers, we never had to ask for a single thing. 

As for the food, I would give it 4 stars for now. 
Let's start with the great...
The smoked golden beets is outstanding. 
As is the quinoa salad, and Wagyu meatballs. 
These starters are musts and are so extremely delicious. 
The tomahawk, and lamb chops are delicious entrees, prepared perfectly. 

And for the not so great...
I hate to say it but I've had the same dishes elsewhere that were much better than how they do it here. 
The Wellington, for example, was not amazing. 
The quality of the meat tasted less than choice, the pastry was not crisp, and when cutting into it, the meat slipped out of the crust. 
The short ribs were not fall off the bone. 
Actually a bit on the tough side. 
The brussel sprouts were extremely salty the first time we dined there but were much better the 2nd time. 
Just needed a spot of acid to cut through the salt. 
The side dishes need some work. 
Mac n cheese is a little soggy, cauliflower over cooked, brussel sprouts a tad bit salty. 
Lastly, the music they pipe through the restaurant is definitely too loud. 
It causes the diners to speak loudly and makes it a bit difficult to hear the service staff unless they speak above a normal decibel level. 

But, once again, the service was beyond stellar so I'm happy to give 5 stars if the food matched the service. I think the expectations here are high and justified. Hell's Kitchen is a commercial success on television. The amount of traffic that they see here is a challenge for sure and it's a lot to live up to but I have confidence that they can do it!

The place looks so cool, awesome design etc. We had an 8:30 reservation and it was for my birthday (which we put in the reservation and also I was told happy birthday when I arrived) we sat down, and since I have both a dairy and gluten allergy I started asking obvious questions- the waiter had a list that needed some updating but we figured out that I could eat something other than steak. We both ordered a glass of wine, and the pours were super small, but the wine was good. Moving on, my husband for beef Wellington which he said was delicious. Half way though he realized he would like some extra sauce for his meal.... we also asked for a wine list. The waiter then looked at us and said ok just so your aware the sauce is $5........ 
soooooo we were a bit shocked bc Jesus Christ, this isn't like a cheap place-- they can't afford a little extra sauce !? But we said ok, since he wasn't going to sacrifice his meal for the lack of sauce. 15 mins later a guy comes over with the sauce and we look at him like UM- take it back we don't need this now, even the worlds slowest eater couldn't have taken That long to eat what was left. Also- the waiter was obsessed with taking my wine glass!!!! Like as if I was going to steal it. It was sooooo weird. The ""assistant"" Dina was awesome, she should have been our waitress bc it would have been a better experience.

The name Gordon Ramsay is a heads up that you've come to the right place. I'd made a reservation just two weeks before our vacation. It was the only time available right after we landed in Vegas. So it was perfect! We got there and the atmosphere just grabs you and pulls you in. Moderate conversation filling the air, dim lightening, and a fun server. After a few minutes of looking over the menu. We decided on a few dishes to order. The Mac and cheese was cheesy, evenly seasoned, and surprisingly a generous portion for the size. Which everything was perfect for me, except two things. One was the complimentary dish. I can't remember the name. But a cube of watermelon, a creamy cheese, pepper, and a garnish. Although it did a great job covering many different flavors at once. Sweet, bitter, tangy, etc. It just wasn't something I could see myself eating again. Although I didn't like it, someone somewhere will come here and love it. The second thing was the Caesar salad. It just tasted of lemons, not a zest, everything tasted like a lemon. This may just be because I ordered without meat, who knows. But I just let the server know and they removed the dish from my bill. My friends enjoyed the Lobster Risotto, Jidori chicken scallopini, and a few drinks! Everything else was perfect, especially the water! I'm not really into buying pop, tea, or juice.

I literally booked a one night Vegas trip just to eat here! When we came that night, they told us they were not taking any walk ins because they were fully booked for the next three days. I didn't have a reservation! But luckily, the seating at the bar was first come, first serve, so we waited til someone left. 

Our experience here was 5 stars across. 

Our bartender/waiter was awesome. We ordered the pre fixe that came with the scallops, beef Wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. In addition to that, we also ordered the lobster risotto and the dry aged ny strip.

The scallops - O.M.G. They were amazzzzinngg. The sear was beautiful and the flavor was spot on. The only disappointing thing is they split the scallops in half, and really, were getting 2 and a half scallops. But it's sooo good, that it's still worth the $$$$$$$$. 

The lobster risotto - another O.M.G. Amazing and def worth the $$$$$$. It would be nice if this came as an entree. It is just not enough as an appetizer! 

The beef Wellington - I have always been curious about this dish for as long as I've watched Hell's Kitchen. This dish was a 4/5 for me. It was tasty and so, so tender, but wasn't as crazy as I was for the first two dishes. 

The dry aged ny strip - 4/5. Very tasty. It came out a little salty, but nonetheless, it was flavorful and tender. 

The sticky toffee pudding - very good. Although, I wish I had more ice cream for every bite with the pudding. But this dessert is so unique and quite a surprise!

I have been to every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Las Vegas and am happy to say that I have checked this one off of my bucket list.  However, I do have some issues that I must bring up.  First of all, my reservation was for 6:30 yet when I checked in the hostess was rather on the rude side.  I am not sure if she was tired or just having a bad day, but she was definitely not welcoming at all.  When I checked in she basically said ""Ok, we will call you when ready""  I then asked her where I should wait or will I get a pager or anything like that.  She just said that ""she will find me"".  Ok...fine.  We waited and waited and waited, took photos and waited some some more.  There was a friendlier hostess that tried to sell us some over priced T-Shirts while we waited.....finally we got called to our table.  We were handed a drink menu and waited....then finally the waitress took our drink orders and we received our drinks rather promptly.  Then our food orders were taken and this is where the real wait began.  Very simple order.  Beef Wellington with brick chicken...that was it!  We waited 45 minutes for our order to arrive.  I know this place was busy, but seriously...45 minutes!  Finally our order came and it was very good, but I was still shaken by the rudeness of the hostess coupled with rather long wait time.  It was my birthday so they brought me out a sticky toffee pudding, which was very good.  This could have been a very special and unique experience but you seriously need to train your hostesses better on customer service.  They can break your business if you don't watch out.  Our waitress was  pleasant but overworked since she had some rather large and ""needy"" tables to take care besides our own and unfortunately, we got the short end of the stick when it came to her service.  Piece of advice.  When you have larger tables (10 or more people) that reserve commonly, you should have dedicated wait staff for those tables and let other wait staff take care of smaller tables.  Otherwise the small tables will get lost in the shuffle, which is what I believe happened in our case.  I will be returning to Hell's Kitchen in the future, but I must admit that Gordon Ramsay's Steak in the Paris Hotel has their act much more together.
Final thought - $15 for a Cesar Salad is a little excessive...it's just lettuce, cheese, croutons, and dressing.",WiuEot2HGKqOupqxrUQTgQ,0,0,4,7HMxw7Rb_u1MFgkRb7sLfA

We have all watched the show and was super excited to try the famous scallops, lobster risotto, and beef wellington.  We also had the opportunity to try the pumpkin soup, caesar salad, Hell's Kitchen burger, and the sticky toffee pudding.

The scallops were not memorable but compared to everything else, it was definitely not the worst.

The lobster risotto came out raw and it felt like we were eating a mouthful of sand.  Luckily our server, Nick, was able to grab us a new plate which was MUCH better but still a tad bit under cooked.

The beef wellingtons came out pink but cold.  Kind of disappointed considering we had high hopes, especially for what we presume to be the star dish.

The pumpkin soup and caesar salad was pretty good.  The burger was spicy and probably the best main dish we had.

The star of our meal was definitely the sticky toffee pudding.

Our waiter genuinely was just as passionate as we were to be there. He wanted our experience to be perfect and he did everything in his power to exceed our expectations and make fantastic recommendations. He went above and beyond to make our lunch an unforgettable experience.

Food was fantastic. We got the seafood tower for one, which was a very generous serving and presented beautifully. Of course, we needed to get the scallops, which were just as perfect as we expected in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The potato puree underneath the scallop was delicate, buttery and delicious. We definitely could have had many more orders of that.

My husband got the burger as an entree, which he was disappointed. He felt that the meat was under-seasoned and lacking in flavor. He did enjoy the toppings on the burger though. Definitely lacking a little salt and pepper.

I got the truffle gouda pizza, which was delicious. Very rich and satisfying. 

Let's not forget about the cocktails as that was our favorite part. Our waiter recommended a smoked bourbon that came presented in a smoky chamber that you opened to be presented with a smoky, delicious drink. Might have gone down a little too smooth. Our waiter was just as excited to present the cocktail to us as we  were to receive the drink.

Lastly, we ended with a delicious pineapple dessert that also came presented with a cold smoke and foam with this delicious coconut cream.

For the ensuing two days, I continued to receive compliments such as ""Best dinner ever"" from colleagues and clients alike.  After the meal was over, I learned that we were the largest party the restaurant had hosted yet.  I have to offer my sincere thanks to Brian Murzyn, Hell's Kitchen Manager, and Sandra Bailey, Caesar's Senior Sales Manager, for helping make it a truly magical evening.

We started with the Wagyu Meatballs, Dungeness Crabcakes and Truffle Arancini as appetizers, all of which were incredible.  We then moved onto a Caesar Salad, unlike any Caesar I had had before, with a hint of lemon zest giving it a wonderful citrus zing and perfectly toasted croutons.  From there, guests were offered a choice of Crispy Skin Salmon, Filet Mignon or Vegetable Risotto.  I had the Filet and it was perfectly Medium Rare and excellently seasoned with no need whatsoever for salt and pepper (in fact they were not even on the table).  We finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which was rich yet light and fluffy with a dollop of ice cream on top.  I'm drooling now thinking about it.

The Service was second to none and Brian's team kept the meal moving perfectly.  We were seated at fourteen 6 person tables right at the window overlooking the strip - it was beautiful.  Finally, we never felt rushed to move on even after the meals were complete, which was important as we were entertaining clients.

We arrived at the restaurant at 9:30 but they were super busy so they made us wait until 9:50 to get seated. 

The decor of the restaraunt was phenomenal. The seating, the cutlery, the napkins, the atmosphere were all amazing. It felt more like an experience than a restaraunt.

I ordered two entrées and a dessert. 

First I ordered the crispy skinned salmon. My friends told me it was amazing, but I thought it was very average. I am not sure what made this salmon so special. Second I ordered the braised beef rib. Again, the ribs were mediocre. Nothing was special about it.  Both my entrées were average... Which is a big disappointment when I was prepared to be blown away.

Then I started to try my Co workers food. I had the Mac and cheese... It was the best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. It was a perfect blend of gouda cheese, macaroni and whatever else that was in it. It was mind browning.

I then tried the beef Wellington. I was only able to get one bite, but that one bite was much better than both my entrées combined!

We then ordered the desert. We ordered the chocolate mousse cake and the toffee pudding. The mousse cake wad pretty bad. The raspberry overpowered the chocolate taste which was extremely disappointing. The toffee pudding however was just epic. It was this weird taste and texture which I cannot even explain. However, that pudding has to go down as my top 5 desserts ever.

In conclusion, the restaraunt has some epic dishes and some very average dishes. I'd recommend to just go with their prix fixe menu as the most popular items are on it.",jkBOSB5CBB_omGWIHKCIpg,1,0,4,ezc18fxK6roi0XjAb3YMHQ

Hostess service was not great as we arrived 20 minutes prior to our reservation and I understand we were early and I had no problem waiting but still went up to the girls just to alert them of my parties arrival (all 4 of us were there). The girl said ok we will seat you closer to your reservation, thats it not another word. 
So we wait and I am observing what it going on. I see people going up to them then i see most being ushered over to a line where there is a red rope. So I am assuming maybe these people don't have reservations. Then I see them starting to be seated. Ok now I am confused and now it is 2:35 and my reservation was at 2:30. I move closer to hear what people are being told. I hear a woman go up and also say she had a reservation the girl tells her to stand in the line. Now i am really confused so I go up and ask about our table and she picks up a paper and says I have you next. I said ok am I supposed to be standing in that line or what am I supposed to be doing, waiting for my name to be called as it is now close to 15 min after my reservation, right then the girl who seats people comes up and asks if I am Shirley to which I reply yes, she then proceeds to take us to our table, super nice girl and I ask her how does this reservation/walking thing work and what is the line? She explains to me that the girl was supposed to take my name and have me stand in that line. I told her that perhaps they need to tell the girls to be more specific so people aren't walking around or sitting there confused as I was. She was very nice and apologetic. So that part ended there as I didn't want that to ruin my experience:) 

Now we sit down, within second waiter is there and we had awesome service! 
The whole atmosphere was exceptional. 
We had the following dishes: 

1) Grilled chicken sandwich
2) Hells Kitchen Burger
3) And I of course had the 3 course Beef Wellington meal and it was the best cut of meat I have ever had! Melts in your mouth and cooked to perfection. Perfect portion of starch and vegetables to go along with it! 
The chorizo pumpkin soup another dish I am just speechless about. The crunch of the few pieces of chorizo in the soup give it the perfect kick of spice! 
The toffee steamed pudding type dessert with this mocha flavored ice cream is just to die for! I highly recommend that you try this $60 three course meal if you go there, it would be crazy to go and not have the beef wellington!! Oh and it is $90 if you choose the wine pairing option:) 
I did have one glass of riesling which was also better than average, perfect sweetness, perfectly chilled and no bitter after taste! Highly recommend!!

4) Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail! A must have...fresh jumbo shrimp full of flavor as it is tossed in a spicy type seasoning and accompanied by a very flavorful cocktail Sauce!! 

The burger and chicken sandwiches consumed by others in my party I am told were very good! They also raved about the sauces which accompanied each sandwich! 

All in all what a great experience, I cannot wait to get back to Vegas and go again! By far the best meal I have had in Vegas!!!! And saved me lots of money away from gambling

2351800,2018-05-16,4,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My daughter took me here for my birthday in April.  First off, we must have sat there at least 10 minutes before anyone came over to wait on us, which was funny because the girl who waited on us sure found time to sit and chit chat with her co-workers instead of waiting on the clientele. For some reason, after she gave us our water, we ended up with a different server and he was very good.

Decided to try the 3-course meal that included a scallop appetizer, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding.  The scallop entree was fine - nothing to write home about. The portion of beef wellington was quite generous and I could hardly finish it.  It was good, not mind blowing. I honestly wasn't wowed until they served the sticky toffee pudding.  Excellent - yum.  Now I've had sticky toffee pudding before and never understood why people raved about it, but now I do.  It was a generous portion and you can bet I ate the whole thing.  I didn't care that I was stuffed to the gills, I was going to finish every crumb.  

The girl who won Hell's Kitchen served us our entrees, I think because they knew it was my birthday.  Didn't matter to me who served my meal because I didn't watch this season of Hell's Kitchen.

Funny thing was we had walked there in sneakers and changed to shoes in the bathroom.  After dinner we went back in the bathroom to change back into our sneakers and realized my daughter's were missing.  She must have forgotten to give them to me when we left the bathroom initially.  I went up to the front counter, and asked if someone had found them.  They had thrown them out behind the bar, fished them out of the garbage and gave them to me (they were wet).  I thought it was funny, and wasn't upset about this at all, just grateful they were retrieved.  They really should have put them in lost and found.",QgCT8TI6BNvLrkAbRhjpPQ,0,1,3,xXflEcadUvM7rahAzKEL6A

Some complained about portion size, but very reasonable for appetizer quantity weighed against quality. Crispy salmon - the flavours were nice, but I found the fish slightly overdone. Beef Wellington - I'm not a big meat-eater, but it was perfectly cooked, tender, and delicious. I wouldn't say that either meal was ""extraordinary"" though. The sticky toffee pudding is a must-try - fantastic - very heavy, so save room. The pineapple carpaccio was also another popular dessert amongst other reviews - the dry ice was cool, but not enough to mask the sour pineapple. Citrus foam made it more sour - almost an assault to the taste buds. The coconut sorbet offset the tartness of the pineapple, but there wasn't enough on the plate.

If you love the show, you will find familiar dishes on the menu. If you come and eat them, you'll be pleasantly surprised! The staff was great and passionate about the restaurant. They tell you all the connections with the show. So if you're into the TV show make sure to listen when you walk in. 

I started with the red quinoa salad, which had apples, celery, goat cheese, feta, and dried apricots (hope I'm not missing anything); all perfectly mixed together with lots of flavor. I would recommend it to anyone. I decided to get the scallops for my entree, since I had a late breakfast and didn't want anything heavy. Even though the beef Wellington (the Hell's Kitchen classic) sounded good, too. The scallops are so tasty I could eat them every day!! 

Our group shared the pineapple dessert (a fun surprise when it comes to your table), and the famed sticky toffee pudding which was on par with the other Gordon restaurants. Both beautifully presented and tastes as good as it looks. 

I can't forget to mention the drinks, which were another surprise. I ordered the Notes From Gordon beverage from the bar. It's refreshing and by far one of the best drinks ever!! Not only was I surprised by the drink, it comes with a 'note' from Gordon on the garnish with one of his sayings from the show. Hilarious! Especially when you have someone read it out to you with a British accent like my husband tried to do. At the end of our meal, we got their coffee, which is by Intelligencia (a third wave coffee- a new term I just learned but this brand has been doing it for decades. Look it up.) A perfect end to a perfect meal.

Hint: come hungry and get the pre fixe with the Wellington. Looks like the best deal, and you get the best of the restaurant. I'll need to come back to get that next time.

Meet your Maker $15: I was planning to order the Fear and Loathing cocktail because I thought it'd be fruity, but our server Robin gave me a heads up that mezcal can be a required taste for some people, and recommended this drink instead. I'm glad he did! It was lovely and refreshing. 

I wanted to try the Beef Wellington and potato puree, but the beef wasn't listed as a solo entree, and I didn't want to pay $9 for a side of potato. So I opted for the 3 course lunch for $60. 

First course: Pumpkin soup. Considering I'm not a huge pumpkin fan, this wasn't bad! The bowl just has the chorizo and pumpkin seeds in it, and they poured the soup over it at the table. The chorizo gave it a nice kick. I personally didn't like having the seeds in the soup. The bowl was also flat so it cooled pretty quickly, and I prefer my soups hot. 

Main course: Beef Wellington. So when it came out, I thought it looked small. But I ended up getting full still. It was delicious! The sauce complimented it well, and I also enjoyed the potato puree. It wasn't the most light and airy I've ever had, but still pretty good. 

Dessert: Sticky toffee pudding. I definitely recommend sharing this because it was so sweet! We still couldn't finish it between 2 people. Though it was good to try, it's not something I'd find myself craving again.

I highly recommend the $69 three course meal which comes with a choice of caesar salad or scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. If you are dining with a partner, I recommend only one person getting the fixed price meal since the entree and dessert are the same. The other can order a different appetizer and entree, that way more delicious foods can be tasted! The dessert can definitely be shared since it's a rather large portion. I did the three course meal while my boyfriend ordered the 18 day aged New York strip along with some brussels sprouts. If you're into beer, the Hell's Kitchen IPA from Stone Brewing is  great!

Scallops (5/5)
They were delicious! The scallops were sweet, perfectly cooked,  and paired with an amazing BBQ like sauce. One of the best scallop dishes I have ever had!

Beef Welllington (4/5)
When at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, beef wellington is a must! I've never had it before, so I was really excited to finally try it. It was buttery, flaky and melt in your mouth.

18 Day Dry Aged New York (5/5)
Neither of us has tried dry aged beef before and it was everything we thought it would be. The beef had such a strong flavor that is quite indescribable. If I had to pick between the wellington and the dry aged steak, I would pick the steak! 

Brussels Sprouts (5/5)
What a game changer! We couldn't decide which side to get, and our waiter recommended the brussels sprouts and I am so glad he did. Hands down the best brussels sprouts ever! Do yourself a favor and order them!

Sticky Toffee Pudding (5/5)
I'm not a sweets person and this was great!! 100% recommend ending your meal with this. The ice cream paired with the warm cake is amazing.

Overall, I had an amazing experience and it became even better when Christina, Michelle, and Gordon were all there. All three were super friendly and took pictures with fans.

I asked his thoughts on the type of drinks such as cocktails wine etc. that would go well with the food. His suggestions were taken and the choices were excellent and complimented the food I ordered. Joanna kept our water glasses filled and the way she poured the water was splendid. She covered the opposite side of the glass so that no water splashed. She cleared the table as I finished each course. During my visit I observed Omar with other guests and he showed his professionalism as did Joanna. The only thing I missed out on was meeting Chef Christina as she was not available and that would have been over-the-top to have met her and possibly get a picture of her or Gordon Ramsay himself. After consuming a Mimosa with my scallops and red wine with my braised short rib grilled cheese sandwich and chips, I had the famous sticky toffee pudding and cocktail called pitchfork and chef stew which was amazing. On Monday, January 15, 2018 I arrived hoping to see Chef Christina with no luck but was greeted by Tim Baer who served me a cocktail called notes from Gordon with an actual note from Gordon and another chef's stew. I complimented those drinks with the lobster risotto which again was fabulous. My visit far exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend this place. I also was able to meet Chef Murphy. She was a nice person and very pleasant to talk to. She listened and cared what I had to say. She was also attentive to all the chefs cooking in the kitchen. Great experience So book your reservations quick because it's my understanding that they are now booked for the next two months.",R_64J13UB2UEvLsOi_KP8g,0,0,5,546epmMtItxWHQAfsXxhJA

I felt like I needed to get the Chef's special menu. When at Hell's Kitchen, order what Gordon Ramsay would serve! Perfectly cooked scallops, perfectly cooked beef Wellington, and a perfectly cooked sticky toffee pudding. I ordered the wine pairings, which included 3 wines, a white, a red and a dessert wine. The red was a 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon, which probably changes but it was one of the best tasting wines I've ever had.
Everyone enjoyed their meal. The table tried the Mac and Cheese, the Steak, the Braised Ribs, and the Meatballs. Everything was just as good as one would expect.
My suggestion however, is to put yourself in Ramsay's hands, and get the chefs special selection.",IWmItwtBjykpr1VN-4EhBA,3,2,5,Wkeb5ae8J3uyqiUbTO_bng

Our meal and our experience were AMAZING. We sat down and were so intrigued by the many  design details that kept us looking around the room in interest - pitchforks in the light fixtures,  video-walls of flickering flames, gorgeous patterned-marble floors,  an open kitchen tiled half in red and half in blue, napkins with HK's great logo. Even my orange juice  was interesting -- it was adorned with an orange slice  propped atop my glass via a pitchfork toothpick (I wiped it down for a great souvenir!). The food was just incredible and came lighting fast, almost impossibly fast. I had a spicy egg dish with sourdough bread that left my stomach feeling warm and happy. My 12-year-old had a braised short rib off the bone, with polenta, which just melted in his mouth and was so tender that he didn't need a knife.  His unsweetened iced tea was served with a side of agave and he loved it. My husband had seared salmon with lentils. He's picky, and he loved it. Seriously the three of us enjoyed a wonderful meal that was much more than a meal...it was an experience that we will remember. If only every dining-out experience could be like this one! Brittany was our wonderfully helpful & knowledgeable server and put up with a lot of our questions and requests, including our final request to take our pic in front of the open kitchen. She did us one better and asked if we'd like a pic with  the 2018 winner of Hell's Kitchen, chef Michelle Tribble, so we got it.

This is a popular place so reservations are a must! When hubby and I came in... they weren't even taking walk-in's since they had so many reservations booked. I booked a month in advance for our anniversary dinner. 

For apps we ordered the pan seared scallops and lobster risotto. I don't think the scallops are the same ones they serve on the show. Nonetheless they were perfectly cooked and all the components worked. The lobster risotto was amazing! The flavor was incredible and the lobster definitely melt in your mouth. Wish the portion was bigger since it was so gooood. 

Hubby ordered the crispy skin salmon and loved his dish. He loves seafood and he enjoyed that this was a lighter dish. I ordered the beef wellington and my goodness it was one of the best things I ate in Vegas. The meat was so tender! I almost wanted to lick my plate clean! We ended our dinner with the sticky toffee cake and it was just enough sweetness. We could barely finish our dessert.

First, unlike Gordon Ramsey's STEAK (of which I actually like), the prices are higher and you do not receive any complimentary bread.

The only good:

The pumpkin soup with roasted chorizo and peanuts was actually delicious. Whoever thought pumpkin soup can have such synergy with Spanish pork? 

Bad:

It goes all downhill from there. Ordered the famous beef Wellington and it was incredibly dry and the pastry fell off the beef immediately. My waiter convinced me to try this as it differs from the beef Wellington at Steak. In fact he told me every chef Gordon Ramsey restaurant has their own take on it.

He was right. This take was quite terrible. The mashed potatoes tasted to quote Ramsey himself 'bland' and felt like it was whipped with little to no butter.

Over fifty dollars for this. Bloody hell Ramsey! 

Oh btw hella kitchen is a famous song by dream theater! Why haven't they sued for trademark infringement is beyond me.

Scallops had great flavor but the order is five halves (so basically 2 1/2 scallops), which was a bit disappointing. I'm a big fan of the show and I would think that Chef Ramsey's standards would not approve of the scallops being sliced in half (butterfly) after they have been seared.  But the pickled apple salad was really good.  3/5

Lobster risotto was a little too al dente but, the butter poached lobster was deliciously sweet. 4/5

Hell's Kitchen Burger was very good! The bacon had a nice smoked flavor, burger was juicy, and the aoli had a nice spicy kick. Overall, excellent food! 5/5",HQYkx4RfVBFa9dcq9IOGIA,0,0,4,7vkSz4j8_d9n9a1xzhNIqw

The hostess wasn't very personable and was quick to dismiss me for whatever reason. Only until my boyfriend inquired did she suggest waiting for a seat at the bar which was first come first serve. At first, our bartender seemed like she'd be great. She suggested 'Notes from Gordon' for a drink and I really enjoyed it. It was only until I got home days later that I realized there was an actual note from Gordon Ramsay. She definitely could've told me as I would've liked to read it for fun, but not a big deal. For my meal I ordered the braised short rib. It was delicious but it didn't stand out as anything different from any other American restaurant. 

My boyfriend ordered a medium rare steak. It came out rare. We asked the steak to be cooked to medium rare but when it came back it was medium well and now it was dry with no juice left.

The wagyu meatballs were also good, but the scallops were not worth it for the price and you only get 2 1/2 as they split it into halves.

We started with the wagyu meatballs and lobster risotto (lobster was amazing) for appetizers and for the entrees we ordered filet mignon and the ny strip.  Both steaks were prepared beautifully.  For sides we ordered potato purée and roasted cauliflower (normally I love roasted cauliflower but something was a little off on this one).  On of our friends ordered the salmon and our other friend ordered the pre-fixe menu which came with scallops for the appetizers, beef Wellington for the entree and sticky toffee pudding for desert.  Just wish I could have ate more and ordered the pumpkin soup and dessert :) . The manager came over at the end of the meal to make sure everything was good, and it was!  Everything was amazing and we had a great time.  Thanks to our server, Brenda and the rest of the staff.  Can't wait to come back.",7FGaox4G5LG361eZkx4o_Q,1,1,5,hx8_9DbnXEfzVWoqXUR-MQ

My boyfriend and I made a reservation for his birthday and were delighted to have been seated within minutes of arriving. We did reserve later in the evening and appreciated the intimate mood setting.

We decided against the Pre-Fixe menu and ordered the following:

Appetizers:
Pan seared scallops (of course)
Lobster Risotto

Entree:
Brick Pressed Chicken (with a side of Brussels sprouts)
Crispy Skin Salmon (with a side of baked Mac & cheese)

Dessert
(The signature) Sticky Toffee Pudding

The food was delectable and downright fulfilling. From the presentation, the dish ware, eating utensils, and everything in between, Hell's Kitchen did not let us down. The flavor between all of the dishes were so incredible and cooked perfectly. The chicken was juicy and the sauce was to die for. The salmon skin was so perfectly crispy that I, someone who doesn't like salmon, want to eat even more of it. Also, if you've ever wanted baked Mac and cheese but never the too creamy, almost sickeningly heaviness of it, then order a bunch of Mac and cheese sides at HK. There's a great balance of lightness and creaminess to it that I'm probably going to dream about it until I go back.

Our server, Miguel, was pleasant, kind, and not overwhelming in any way like most other restaurants. He was knowledgeable, personable, and I couldn't have hoped for a better person. 

If you're a fan of the show and of Gordan Ramsay himself, you have to indulge in this experience. That includes saving room for the Sticky Toffee Pudding with speculoos ice cream.

2704431,2018-02-20,2,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I have been dreaming about eating here for YEARS since Gordan's show premiered. I would watch the show and admire how amazing and delicious his food looked and could only hope to eat there one day! I knew I was going to go to Las Vegas in February and heard that this restaurant was opening right around that time, once reservations became open I booked it IMMEDIATELY, probably around November. 

When we arrived the hostesses were great, the atmosphere, decor, music, everything was lovely. I really thought I was in for the best food experience of my life. 

When we got sat down, it took around 10-15 minutes to even be introduced to our waiter and we finally got our menus. It took another 15 minutes to get asked for our order. 

We decided to order an expensive bottle of champagne, only for it to be served HOT. I'm talking like very very very warm, not even room temperature. It took around 40 minutes for it to be chilled in ice and water. It took so long that we ended up ordering beers while waiting for our bottle to be ""chilled"". 

After that, my little brother had ordered Mac and cheese, only for it to be served to us EXTREMELY cold, not even warm but freezing like it had been made hours ago. It was thick and dry as well. They immediately made him a new one which was great and definitely up to par with our expectations. 

Finally when the adults got served their food, we immediately had to return one entree, the short rib. It was dry, burnt, and had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever. I had ordered a beef Wellington, which I had at Gordon Ramsey steak months before (which was the most amazing thing I had ever had)... and it was NO WHERE NEAR as good. It was tasteless honestly. No seasoning, no flavor, not even near as good as it was at his steak restaurant in Paris Las Vegas. I also ordered mashed potatoes as a side dish, only for it to be extremely watery and thin, not creamy. I left the entire thing.

Overall..... this was the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced in my life when it comes to a restaurant. I had the highest expectations, only to be served outback steak quality for the price tag of triple of that. It was honestly horrible and I am so upset about my experience here. I wish Gordon could have been in town so he could've screamed at the food they were serving and probably fired everyone that took part in making it for even letting it out of the kitchen. This is DEFINITELY not to Gordan's expectations and I hope that he realizes that soon before his reputation is impacted. 

Worst part is we had all these terrible experiences and did not get credited one thing.... we ended up spending over 500 on the most mediocre and horrible food. Definitely will not be returning and I definitely don't think this place is worth your money whatsoever,go to Gordan Ramsey steak across the street.",V8XoBbLgJtVpaKCJG0Bdnw,4,0,1,21hvsFnFNlHLRZyCpgPXkg

We had been looking forward to coming here for a couple of months after my son picked this place to celebrate his 10th grade promotion. We have previously eaten at Gordon Ramsay Burger place, but we were disappointed and had tried to convince my son to go elsewhere, he wouldn't budge. We arrived 5 min before our reservation ( highly recommended, since it's on the strip) and checked it. The host checked us in and asked the we wait to get our table ready. We maybe waited, if that, 3 min before we were walked over to our table.

The Food: SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD! We ordered the wagyu meatballs as a starter. They were amazing! There are 5 meatballs served per dish. My husband and I ordered the Tomahawk steak for 2. The menu on Cesar's Palace website shows this entree being served with 2 side dishes, however, this is not the case. According to the server, they stopped including the side dishes 2 weeks ago. Each side is $9. We ended up choosing the baked Mac n Cheese and the Potato Purée. My son chose the Crispy Skin Salmon with an added side of Potato Gratin. The food is served in a satisfying portion, enough to leave room for dessert. You can't skip dessert here....at all! There are no other words to describe the Pineapple Carpaccio than phenomenal. It's thinly sliced pineapple with coconut sorbet drizzled with passion fruit sauce. 

Service lived up to the expectations. Tony and Jason were constantly checking in on us and giving us the status of our food. We ordered our steak medium well and he told us from the beginning that it was going to take a little longer than normal. I appreciate knowing that way I'm not just sitting there wondering what's going on. 

The place itself is nice. They have the pitchfork decor and the cooks are divided into the red and blue teams. There are TV's around the restaurant that show clips from the show and they even sell Hell's Kitchen merchandise. 

We had a fantastic time and we would come back again. I would like to maybe see more dinner choices, but who knows what could happen.",U28VstjRdxyoTp423t5JcA,1,1,5,m6PXavxTD7HHO8pH18oigg

Well, last night was a COMPLETE disappointment!  It was such a complete let down, waiting months to eat here.  The food was NOT up to par.  If Gordon was there himself, he would NOT have served the food we received.  
I ordered the lobster risotto.  It was good, but not great.  My husband ordered the New York steak and I ordered the pre fixe menu.  The seared scallops was pathetic.  They looked so flat and dry, as if they had been sitting underneath lamp too long.  They were salty and tasted old, not fresh or tasty at all!  When our main course arrived, my beef wellington was rare, not medium rare.  I asked the server to cook it to the right temperature and she said they don't do that.  That's how it comes.  Both of our entrees were lukewarm warm.  How is this possible if it was just made?!?  I only ate 1/2 of the beef wellington because I was hungry.  The texture and taste of eating rare, warm bland meat was not appetizing one bit!  The meat didn't agree with me afterwards, as I was nauseous for a couple hours after leaving.  Our server didn't come back to check on us and ignored us.  Didn't even refill water till glasses were empty.

Clearly Gordon Ramsay isn't just all about screaming the F word at people and giving mental breakdowns. After you eat his food, you think, ""Hey, maybe...just maybe, those people deserved those mental breakdowns."" 

The restaurant is like a Hell's Kitchen theme park. They've got the trademark HK sign that's on fire. There's a life-sized portrait of Gordon Ramsay talking to you. There's a hallway with his face staring menacingly, as if you've just been eliminated from a high-stakes competition. TVs playing HK highlights on repeat. And of course, merch, merch, merch! 

But as silly as all of this is, it's definitely got the trademark Gordon swagger. Every detail is perfect, from the beautiful red hostess dresses, to the mini pitchfork ceiling decor. The service was absolutely impeccable and we were waited on by not one, but two amazing servers. Keeping your water filled was just the minimum; they were quick, efficient, and wonderful conversationalists. 

Now, the food. Absolutely exquisite. It's pricey, but the quality AND quantity were great value in my opinion. The $72 Beef Wellington prix fixe is a must-order. It comes with either salad or scallops (definitely get the scallops), the Wellington (originally $59 so the prix fixe is a steal), and sticky toffee pudding. Between 3 people, we got that, plus another order of scallops, a foie gras app, lobster risotto, lamb, and a side of potato gratin. 

Everything tasted as good as it looked. It was an absolute dream. From the pea puree at the bottom of the perfect scallops, to the last drop of smoky caramel in the toffee pudding. The foie gras was seared, fatty goodness. The lobster tasted like it was just in the ocean that morning. The lamb came in, surprisingly, 3 beautiful large pieces, which again, is really quite a good value. I can't even pick a favourite. Everything was memorable. Even the potato gratin side dish kept me going back. 

Guys, that angry British man knows what he's yelling about. You're not going to have anyone screaming ""IT'S RAWWW!"" here. Get your butt into that restaurant and experience a TV gimmick at its finest.

Service was great! Although I don't recall my waiters name, he was very informative of the menu, very friendly, brought everything out to us in a timely manner, and checked on us several times. We made sure to leave him a nice tip.

In terms of parking, we parked in Caesar's self-parking towards the back near the forums and it's a decent walk from there to the front of Caesar's where Hell's Kitchen is. Keep in mind, Caesar's does not have free parking for locals.

2802698,2018-02-11,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay.  I'm not talking about the screaming font of clever vulgarity (though that is f%#$ing entertaining), but the Gordon Ramsay you find in his cookbooks and recipe videos, the more genteel and encouraging teacher of the culinary arts.  But as big of a fan as I am, I'd never had the chance to dine at one of his restaurants.  You can imagine my excitement when we were lucky enough to score a table at his newest Vegas venture, Hell's Kitchen at Caesar's Palace.

Hell's Kitchen is in a stand-alone building right on Las Vegas Boulevard, with a large metallic pitchfork bearing the restaurant's logo out front, and deep red signage.

Upon entering, you're greeted to a spacious interior, replete with pitchfork fixtures and an open kitchen split into red and blue halves, the crew on each side dressed in matching smocks and bandannas.  The flaming mosaic work above the kitchen follows this motif.  It's quite a nice place to look at, the only misfire being the video screen right inside the door with Ramsay walking off and on camera to deliver some PG-rated quotes about the place.  

The dining room is wide open, with tables spaced liberally throughout.  The service is impeccable, with friendly and knowledgeable staff who strike the right balance between check-ins, banter, and leaving you alone to enjoy your food.

The cocktails are all very good, offering takes on a Pimm's cup, fruity quaffables with dry ice, and even a  drink delivered in a smoking box.  

The menu reads like a Ramsay's Greatest Hits, with scallops, Beef Wellington, and toffee pudding, the three actually comprising the pre fixe menus, which is the best deal on the menu.  We did try a seafood tower which was, well, a seafood tower.  Nothing exceedingly special, but a nice selection of seafood.  My special ladyfriend had the quinoa salad.  Never would I have imagined that it'd be one of the best things on the menu, but it is legitimately good, and I was more than happy to help her finish it off.

The special ladyfriend had the chicken, and it is transiently spicy and very good, with a bed of hearty hash that has a sweet crunch to it.

The rest of us had the Beef Wellington.  One thing I've always taken issue with is Ramsay's affection for the filet, which I think is the most overrated cut of beef out there.  The thing has no marbling, uniform texture.  It's just not as interesting as the ribeye in my book.  But, then again, I'd never had filet Ramsay style.  The delicate pastry crust, the savory mushroom pate, a perfectly-cooked rare filet... this isn't just the best thing I ate last night... it was arguably the best thing I have ever eaten.

It's clear that the kitchen has extreme confidence in the Wellington, because they don't even bother to equip you with anything more than the butter knife that is already on the table.  And that knife slices through it like it were a razor blade.

Hell's Kitchen is not excessively pricey for Las Vegas, which makes it all the easier to recommend.  Without a doubt, if you're fortunate enough to find an open reservation slot, take it.  Absolutely superb, and highly recommended.",ivHlD7Mp7J6JtzGHXSZLiw,0,1,5,5y1dzO2Vc_HynCQVy1V4DQ

When we arrived we were promptly seated. They were kindly congratulating my bday and adding credits to my card.
We decided on dishes and ordered the Prix Fixe menu and the crsipy skin salmon at 11:20am.
The appy came at 11:30am (asparagus soup). Presentation of soup was excellent - simple and elagant. The soup is very rich and creamy (reminds me of cream of mushroom soup) and a very generous amount of soup.
The mains came at 11:40am. The beef Wellington was done to perfection. The quality of their beef is top notch. The medium rare beef just melts in your mouth. The mash potatoes and roots veggies goes very well with the dish. The salmon had a crispy skin as promised. 
It was very odd to have them provide me my husband's dessert with a candle stuck there for me. As if it is meant for us to share. I find that presumption odd as it is my husband's dessert - not mine.

Pro: buzzy people going to a hype restaurant, food I would not have normally ordered. 
Con: parking, (I'm a local), not quite impressed with the fare. 

So, went for a four course prixe fixe meeting/meal.  FYI, if no one has ever told you, you don't go there very hungry.  The portions are just right for keeping your weight down...hint.. 

The intro beet salad with something or other...meh. 
The lobster risotto - hit.  I'd order a vat of that for sure if I won some big dollah jackpot. 
The iron chicken.  glad I had some water to counter the DRY white breast.  That was it, just a breast, no wing.  My date ordered the beef wellington, and liked that one, but it sure wasn't big enough to share..or she didn't like me enough to share - one or the other.  ha
The sides: mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes.  I must be used to Kraft or Velveeta, cuz the cheese in these dishes was just ok.  Filler sides, as I had about three servings to cover my appetite.  Yes, it will stop you up.  
The chocolate molten pile was so rich none of the 12 people at our table could finish their serving.  That serving was too big - contrary to the protein.  

So, I've realized that we have a lot of celeb chef places in close proximity, so this would not be a repeat if I had to pay.

If you are looking for nonalcoholic options try the aqua fresca watermelon, it is quite delicious the next thing I remember is the beef Wellington and also the scallop appetizers.

2904833,2018-01-24,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"We have never been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant before so were excited to visit the newly opened Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas. 

The décor is very contemporary and clean, though the hostesses a little tarty in their cleavage-revealing short dresses. 

We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive.  The food took a little longer than expected (40 minutes from seating to appetisers) but was well worth it.  We had the set menu (scallops, Wellington, sticky pudding) and everything was truly exceptional - perfectly seasoned and hot.  The portions were reasonable but not terribly generous, with the exception of the sticky toffee pudding, which was quite large (absolutely delicious - I wanted to lick my plate ). 

I was disappointed with their ""tap"" water as it was warm and unfiltered. C'mon Gordon, get a Britta.  LV water is not the best and (pun intended) left a bad taste in my mouth. 

I also indicated on my reservation that we were celebrating my birthday, but no mention was made of it during our visit. 

This is not a casual eatery (our meals were $69 each + $13 glasses of wine) but it is well worth it for a treat.  My actual rating is a 4.5.",vUp57gankMbEmbmu1vfQ2w,0,0,4,kyX9kUGwbAmgQvJKz1_atA

The service was friendly, attentive, not stuffy, and very welcoming. When they learned it was my birthday, they offered a second dessert in addition to the one that came with my meal. 

If you go, get the hell's kitchen prix menu, the Caesar salad was a meal unto itself, the Wellington was beyond perfect, and the sticky toffee pudding - I barely had any hunger left to get through it but it was too good to waste.

2917347,2018-02-15,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My wife and I recently took my mother-in-law to Hells Kitchen for lunch as she is a big-time fan of Gordon Ramsay. Reservations were at 1:00, but because of no traffic we arrived nearly 30 minutes early, so we were told to wait in line.

We were seated about the time of our original reservation, not in the main room of the restaurant, but in the back, with views of Caesar's Palace and the Strip, not the kitchen, so my mother-in-law was disappointed.

I began my meal with the Smoked Golden Beets Salad, and it was superb. It seemed to be the perfect temperature, cool, but not cold. The beets were flavorful and cooked to perfection, and the pistachio granola provided a welcome crunch. Everything tasted FRESH.

For my main I think l made a mistake by trying the Margherita Pizza, so as to compare it with my favorite pizza restaurant. While everything was again fresh, and looked beautiful, the crust was not very flavorful, and the tomatoes were mostly tasteless as well. It is February, and I guess decent tomatoes are hard to come by. 

I tried the Hells Kitchen IPA by Stone Brewing to go along with my pizza and enjoyed it.

Dessert was divine. I think it was called Pineapple Carpaccio. The dry ice provided quite the show, but the thin ribbons of cool sliced pineapple and coconut sorbet were the star, and not too sweet. 

I tasted the Pan Seared Scallops and Lobster Risotto my dining companions ordered and both were delicious. I would like to add that I think the lunch menu is different from the dinner menu.

When we left the restaurant at 2:00 on a weekday afternoon there was no line to get in.

 As my mother-in-law uses a walker we parked at Caesars valet. From there it was a short walk to the restaurant. Otherwise parking in the hotel garage is more of a schlep.

I would expect nothing but the best food from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and except for the pizza I tried, that is what I got.

One last word: the music is a tad loud and makes it difficult to hear your server or engage in conversation with your fellow diners. But that is typical of restaurants these days.",wtLrFTEqYIlAWEIilOYtYA,0,0,4,hAtaM9mPtZpZ3W3Lgkb9ug

2920036,2018-03-06,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"We decided to surprise our daughters as part of a late Christmas gift. Our reservation was for 8:30 pm and they definitely held to the reservation time. The place was packed! Immediately upon walking up to the restaurant, that familiar ""HK"" greeted us. My only complaint is that it was not on fire like it is in the show. 

Walking into the restaurant, you are greeted by a life-sized Gordon Ramsay on a video screen. Fashioned almost like a news clip reel, he steps out and welcomes you, then walks off screen. Later, he shows up and provides some of his all-time best quotes from the show. This area is a decent sized lobby where you can also look at merchandise to purchase while you wait. Because we had our kids with us, we opted to not wait in the bar area. While waiting, you can enjoy the photo wall of all of the past winners of Hell's Kitchen.

At 8:30 we were seated, about 3/4 of the way back, yet centered. Although not an exact replica of the HK television restaurant, they definitely nailed this one! The two kitchens in their famous red and blue colors stood out, as did the chefs, donning the well-known red and blue jackets, who were working behind the pass. Executive chef and Season 17 Winner, Michelle Tribble was sporting the white jacket and running the pass.

The plates on the table had classy grey napkins with the Hell's Kitchen logo stitched on them. Every detail in the restaurant was well-planned and executed.

My girlfriend and I ordered the Prix Fixe menu, starring the pan seared scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. This is, by far, the best deal when ordering. The kids ordered the brick-pressed chicken, a caesar salad, and mac and cheese. Just to be the awesome dad, I ordered the lobster risotto and shrimp scampi flambe.

To start with, the lobster risotto was amazing! The lobster was so sweet and moist. The flavor and texture of the risotto was perfect! The only complaint I had was that the risotto was definitely not the same size as the appetizers on the show. It was more like a thin coating on the plate, with a perfect lobster tail set on top.

Honestly, I only ordered the shrimp so the girls could see their first flambe. I was so wrong to order them for that reason. They were cooked to perfection and the flavor....I did not even need to worry about the drawn butter that accompanied them. Utter perfection. I only wish there was more than three. Those little suckers cost $8.00 a piece!

Next came the scallops. They were seared perfectly and the sauce that accompanied them was delicious. Because of the way they were cut, they were easy to share around the table as samples for all of us.

You simply cannot come to Hell's Kitchen and NOT order the beef wellington. This is the first time I have ever had wellington and I was always skeptical. My girlfriend has had it several times and loves it. The meat was cooked perfectly! The demi-glace added a subtle, yet noticeable touch. The puree and root vegetables were seasoned well and a perfect addition to the plate. (again, I just wish there was more).

My girls loved, loved, loved, the brick-pressed chicken. I was able to sample it and was very impressed. It is very easy to dry out a chicken breast. This was so tender, moist, and well-seasoned I almost wished that I had ordered it. I was glared by one of the kids at as I sampled the mac and cheese appetizer. Everything from the cheese and pasta, to the seasoning and crust was amazing.

I know I am over-using the word amazing, but it just was. Now, admittedly, I am a huge fan of the show and walking into this place automatically creates a bias. Have we had better food? Sure. However, this was extremely good and a well-thought-out menu. Here, the food coupled with the experience are what makes it so special. The vibe in the place is absolutely electric and the server was personable, attentive, and entertaining. For the amount of customers and the fast-paced ambiance of the restaurant, we never felt rushed and almost seemed encouraged to take our time.

I don't get to Vegas often, but I will make sure and return to Hell's Kitchen when I go there again. It is expensive and loud and.... I loved every minute. Well done!",KkAahAtl4fu9wWoJXSRw_A,0,2,5,K3MA4EJY-Ro72hL9D0xnzA

The winners of each season are also featured on the wall. 

Once seated, we had a great view of the open prep area where, if you're familiar with the TV show, there are red and blue teams prepping your food. There are runners waiting for items to be ready on each side. 

We started with soup and flambeed shrimp. The presentation of the shrimp was really fun! The soup was fabulous. There were 3 of us for dinner and 1 person in our party had the price fixe menu. Her appetizer was the scallops. The entree course was the salmon and the appetizer scallops as well as a side of the most delectable cauliflower I've ever eaten.

2936081,2018-03-08,10,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Opening weekend for Hell's Kitchen...I definitely wasn't missing out on this. The restaurant was completely booked for almost all time slots but thankfully I was able to get an early slot for 11:15am on a Sunday. Lunch before hopping on the freeway back to LA sounded good to me. Even if it didn't, it was my only option so I had role with it or go home.

The decor is nice with the bar just behind the hostess booth near the entrance, the kitchen to the right of the hostess booth and the main dining area in the center. There's also indoor patio seating with a good view of Las Vegas Blvd pointing south of the strip from Caesars Palace on down.

As always beers were the kick off. After glancing over the menu a few times my heart was set on the prefixed lunch which included a Caesar salad or pumpkin soup, a beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding for $60. I've heard great things prior about Ramsay's beef wellington. Since on the subject of hearing great things, the same can be said for his pan seared scallops so an order was put in for an appetizer. For other plates a Dry aged New York strip and eggs in purgatory were ordered. 

Our server was on top of his game! Very attentive, knowledgeable about the dishes and even took the time to stop by for a few laughs. Shortly after placing our orders the plates began to role out.

The hype surrounding the pan seared scallops is well deserved. I loved the layer of seasonings on top that sort of served as a crust. The pickled Granny Smith apples that came with the scallops are pretty sour by themselves but eating them with the braised bacon lardons balances the tartness. I didn't get a chance to taste the eggs in purgatory but judging how fast my friend ate them, it had to be good haha.

The pumpkin soup was decent, not much to really write home about. However the chorizo and toasted pepitas in the soup were tasty. The beef wellington was absolutely delicious. From the crust all the way down to the center. The Dry aged NY strip was as equally good and loved the shishito pepper combination. At first I thought there wasn't enough demi-glacé with the NY strip but after asking for more on the side the amount on the plate was perfect. The demi-glacé alone is pungent and can overpower the steak if too much is poured. Just an FYI if you choose to ask for more. 

The sticky toffee pudding tasted exactly the same as the sticky toffee pudding from Ramsay's other restaurant Pub & Grill but is topped with speculoos ice cream rather than sweat cream ice cream. This was expected since both are his recipe. Hot, soft and delicious. I thought using speculoos for a flavor of ice cream was an interesting choice. It tasted just like the cookie as well. 

I really enjoyed the meal, my only gripe is the portion for some plates. My beef wellington was pretty small and the same can be said for the scallops. They're too delicious and costly to be served small LOL. That's not to say there aren't heftier items on the menu. All of the burgers I saw passing our table were decent in size and looked mouthwatering. So did a few other plates I saw being delivered to other tables. 

If you're a fan of Gordon Ramsay, Gordon Ramsay's cooking, a fan of the Hell's Kitchen show, or are just curious about the food...I recommend giving it a shot. I plan to make many returns but for much more special occasions.

2942478,2018-03-10,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen is located on the Las Vegas Strip in a building that is in-front of Caesar's (where the ice-cream place used to be). This is sort of a novelty restaurant with a Hell's Kitchen TV Show theme to it and a sort of Hell's Kitchen kind of menu. You walk in and it almost looks like Gordon Ramsay is there to sort of greet you. As you walk past the hostess desk you see an open kitchen. The winning contestant of the last Hell's Kitchen Cooking Competition TV Show was there working on the line on my visit. You also see light fixtures hanging from the ceiling with pitchforks like from Hell's Kitchen. 

From my seat I got kind of excited when I saw someone that looked like Gordon Ramsay come out of the kitchen in Chef Whites. It looked like from my seat that Gordon Ramsay was checking on the line. I don't know if they pay someone to look like Gordon Ramsay or if one of the chefs that work there just happen to resemble him???

Now what to order.

I noticed the wine list and it runs very expensive. Your cheapest bottle runs about $70. and it goes up up UP with many bottles running a little under $200..... So we went with cocktails. My husband got maybe the most interesting cocktail. It was called a Smoke on the Blvd. It was presented in a box filled with applewood smoke. It was a very impressive presentation and the drink was indeed smoky!

We started with two salads that we shared. The Caesar and the Red Quinoa. We both favored the Red Quinoa. It was interesting and different with a little apple, dried apricots, hazelnuts and goat cheese. It was tasty. The Caesar wasn't bad but it was slightly disappointing because it wasn't perfect. The flavors in the dressing were very unbalanced and were mostly lemon. We couldn't taste the garlic, anchovy, black pepper and other flavors it's suppose to have. We told our waiter and he just nodded (not a big-gy).

For Dinner I was hoping for the John Dory........Don't they always call for a John Dory on the TV Show???? I settled for a Crispy Skin Salmon. The Salmon Skin indeed was CRISPY and seasoned just so and the fish was prepared to a perfect medium. The lentils were seasoned well and the salad was tasty.

My husband had the Wellington and it came in a crispy pastry and the filet was a perfect medium rare.

I never had Toffee Pudding before or the unusual German Flavored Ice cream before. The Toffee Pudding is like Wet Soaked Cake that is sort of like Molasses flavored. It really wet and very moist and not too sweet. The ice-cream on top is creamy and slightly spiced.

For the most part everything we tried was prepared reasonably well. I enjoyed the novelty of the restaurant. It was kind of fun. The Smoke on the Blvd Cocktail was impressive. Food wasn't cutting edge but was good.",V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ,8,7,4,29iXqNVxg7JUm16Wegt59A

We ordered the hot wings and meatballs for appetizers (which came out with our main course meal unfortunately) and really loved the flavors of these options.

The servce was pleasant and efficient. Mohammed made many good menu recommendations thus we opted for the HK express three-course Lunch menu as well as the wine tasting for $95 per person.  There was a high waitstaff to table ratio for the lunch service so Mohammed and his colleagues were able to check in on our table often and top off our wine/water. 

First course:
Pumkin soup with spicy chorizo, creme fraiche, and toasted pepitas paired with 2016 Tahbilk Marsanne. 

The soup was enjoyable had the chewy chorizo bits added texture that you don't really get in other soups.  The wine pairing for this course was unmemorable; glad I ordered T? Nant mineral water as an alternative. 

Second course: 
Beef Wellington along with potato puree (not a sizable portion more of a decoration), glazed root vegetables, red wine demi-glace paired with 2014 Foley Johnson Cabernet Sauvignon. 

The half portion of Beef Wellington was cooked well and the wine pairing was spot on. I haven't fully developed my palate to enjoy many Cabs but the 2014 Foley Johnson was such a good match I had no issue. 

Third course:
Sticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream paired with 10 year old Foneseca Tawny Port. The sticky toffee pudding was delicious but too rich for me to finish. The Foneseca was also another great selection to pair with this dessert.

I would definitely dine here again. Especially for the proximity to the hotel check in area it is one of the best nearby lunch options for me when flying in early afternoon to Las Vegas. 

For those with early arrivals** into Las Vegas but 4pm check-in times I would leave my bags with the bell desk, and have lunch at Hells Kitchen whilst waiting for your room. If you finish lunch and still waiting gram a roman ritual pass at Qua and use the spa facilities (the pass is discounted if you are a guest of a Caesars property $50-$60 and even more if staying at Caesars or Nobu $25-$35).

My Autistic son was turning 27 and he loved watching Hell's Kitchen. He has been a long time fan of the series. We wanted to do something special for his birthday. I made reservations for 10 people even before the restaurant was open. I explained the situation to the host via phone and asked her if there would be anyway the head chef (season 10 winner) could come by our table to say ""hi"" to our son.

2969105,2018-05-11,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Made a reservation 1 month in advance.  The spots fill up really quickly! Being such a hot new restaurant, everybody wants to try.

We got there in time for our reservation at 6:45pm.  Checked in with the hostess, and stood to the side while we waited for our names to be called.  There were a lot of people standing and waiting to be called.
We ended up getting seated around 7:00pm, there were a lot of empty tables when we were finally seated.

The service was very good and quick.  Waters were topped up often, dishes were recommended.

Got a complementary palate cleanser to start.  It was watermelon cube with some pepper, it was very a nice small refreshing bite.

Our party of 4 ordered a variety.  One ordered the 3 course meal (scallops, beef wellington, sticky toffee pudding), another ordered crispy skin salmon, a rack of lamb and lastly another order of beef wellington.

The scallops were nicely cooked, but were cut very thinly.  So what looked like 5 pieces were perhaps only 2.5 scallops.

The main course came very quickly, and it was nice to watch all the chefs doing their own thing to get the plates out in a timely fashion.

The beef wellington looked perfect.  Crispy top, perfect medium rare.  But having 2 pieces is very filling.  It might not look like a lot, but once you eat it, it starts to accumulate on you.
The crispy skin salmon was good.  Nice crispy skin, and salmon that was slightly over cooked.  Wanted something more moist on the inside.

The rack of lamb was beautiful.  Medium rare, thick slices, and very meaty.
This came with greens (not sure if it was spinach), but it was EXTREMELY salty.  To the point it was bitter, like they accidentally salted this twice.  We explained this to the busboy that came to pick up my plate at the end of dinner.  He turned around and explained it to our waitress.  
But....the waitress didn't do anything or acknowledge.  I didn't want to say anything (usually i say everything is fine when they ask), but thought I'd proactively give feedback so they could better their business.  But nope...nothing.  Then she just handed us the bill.

I had to flag her down and ask her if we still had a dessert for the 3 course menu.  And she looked at the bill, then apologized and took the bill back.

The dessert was really good!  Just like the one at Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse!  The ice cream melted on the toffee cake, it was nicely paired with sauce.  not too sweet and overpowering.

Great dessert!

The restaurant was nice, way too loud, perhaps with how it's set up (one big open box) and all the talking echoing, we had to literally shout to each other.  
The service was quick.

But really, i think this place is over hyped.  It's been open a few months already, but i think they're still overwhelmed by the number of customers.",4hetE9pQKPXesVF4KB2c8A,1,0,3,j6jNX_p_CrO4gWsSrF77CQ

The croutons in the Caesar salad is made from fresh bread, yum!

The lobster risotto is creamy and buttery. The lobster is sliced and just falls off tenderly. The first bite is buttery like fresh sourdough, then it gets creamy and sweet. Love the crispy sage and the chew to the rice. Nice layers of flavour notes!

The beef wellington has a sweet pastry very similar to the triangular chinese bbq pork puff pastry. The beef in the middle is more like a brisket than a steak.

The sticky toffee pudding is the best part and made me forget about everything else. It's to die for! The idea of sticky toffee doesn't appeal to me at first and I thought it would be sticky and too sweet, but it's not at all! It's a fluffy chocolate cake with toffee sauce seeped in at the sides and topped with cold Speculoos (a shortcrust cookie) ice cream. Every bite is so good and you must eat the cake with the ice cream together for the full flavour profile.

The white asparagus soup with a phyllo-Parmesan crisp was delicious. I liked mixing the salty crunchy roll with the soup's creaminess.

As for the beef Wellington, the steak was lean and perfectly cooked. The mushroom paste layer did a good job of enhancing the steak while the red sauce made sure I wasn't overwhelmed by the starchiness of the ingredients.

The desert was good. The mix of cold ice cream and hot sticky toffee pudding was interesting. The weather outside was hot so I would have preferred to ditch the pudding and just eat the ice cream.

This restaurant has the added benefit of being themed after The television show ""Hell's Kitchen"".  We went for lunch so understand my review is based on that visit. 

This restaurant had a surprisingly casual atmosphere for lunch. It looked like a dinner it would be more formal. We liked the casual atmosphere and the service was really good.

The food was excellent. We had the beef Wellington a fillet a few of the appetizers and a few of the sides. We also had every different dessert they sell.  All really good. It is a little expensive and for my family of five we spent $400 on lunch.

The only complaint we had was when we went to say hello to the celebrity chef Michelle.  As longtime fans of the show we were excited to meet her.  The waiter asked if we wanted to meet her and we were really happy to do it.  When we walked over to be introduced she was clearly frustrated.  We tried to make small talk and it was clear that she was not having a good day.  The interaction was so bad that it dropped my review from five stars to four and almost three.   If the food was not so good we would have given it a three.  

Overall I would recommend this restaurant as a onetime visit if you are a fan of the show.  It is great if you are staying at ceasears. It is really convenient and I bet it would be a great high end dinner.  I just hope that Michelle is having a better day.",uch01q0I89VjLtfHXR5r-A,0,0,4,ymPiJp9aaQ7tKrqkxv9dAA

My good friend and I came in 20 minutes early to check in. From our initial 8:45 PM reservation, we got seated at 9 because there were no tables available. The hostess walked us through the entire dining area to find a table but the empty tables were yet to be bussed. We had to wait back in line until she called for us but finally got seated in the middle of the dining area. The view of the open kitchen with the red and blue teams was just spectacular. 

Our server was pleasant and explained so many things on the menu for us. He was great! The only downside was that the music was uncomfortably loud mixed with other diners' conversations. I could not hear half the things he was saying... I just kind of nodded to everything. 

Now onto the food! 
The crispy skin salmon- I was speechless. I mean I cannot compare it to anything else but it was just wonderful.

The brick pressed chicken- The sweet potato hash complimented the chicken so well. Other than that, my friend inhaled the whole thing. Need I say more?

For sides we both ordered the baked macaroni & cheese. We could have ordered one to share but go hard or go home! The smoked Gouda was amazing. Oh my gosh. 

Lastly, we had the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The server highly recommended it and now I highly recommend it. The pudding was so warm and gooey. That speculoo's ice cream chucked me into some paradigmatic state where I had to reconsider whether they laced the dessert with something. If someone were to ask me my most favorite dessert as of now, it would be the sticky toffee pudding.

Overall, a bit disorganized and some miscommunications but the food overshadowed everything else. Hell's Kitchen is definitely impressive.",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,22,20,4,9UzBFIbcmwN12MFxdGlR9A

The food and service was excellent but the portions were pittifully minuscule.  The ""lunch portion"" of the Wellington was only 1 /2 a portion, literally a dinner portion cut in half.  My particular half had almost no beef.  The lunch portion was $60 while the dinner would have cost $69.  Not only that, but the lunch portion only comes with salad while the dinner portion includes a real appetizer.

The scallop appetizer consisted of 8 slices of scallop about 1/8 inch thick.  Ok..i know scallops are expensive but for $22 we expected to get more the one scallop.

The lobster risotto had a less then 3 oz lobster with undercooked 2 oz of risotto.

The birthday dessert was the best part of the meal.  Nice volcano pineapple, but could not fill the void.

The prix fixe had 3 items. First came a choice of pan seared scallops or caesar salad. Then came beef wellington as the entree. Dessert consisted of sticky toffee pudding w/ice cream.

The pan seared scallops seemed well-seared and not overcooked. The puree garnish added contrast to the scallop sear's texture. The braised lardons and pickled apples made for an interesting palette; the contrast between the smoky richness of the lardons and the tangy pickling playfully juxtaposed each other, allowing neither to dominate the palette.

The beef wellington arrived textbook rare. The fillet remained consistently tender, and the pastry's buttery flavor enhanced, rather than overpowered the fillet. The potato puree had all the flavor of a freshly mashed potato without the overbearing richness.

For the sides, the roasted cauliflower could have done without the crumbs (personal preference). The chili lime brightened the cauliflower significantly. The wild mushrooms oozed umami; I wanted an entire bowl. The baked mac 'n cheese, while good, seemed lackluster in comparison to the other items.

The dessert, however, stole the limelight of the night. The pudding itself, reminiscent of cantonese rice pudding/???, possessed a subdued savory sweetness. The coffee?-flavored ice cream and the toffee syrup turned the pudding into a symphony of chocolate coffee richness. Had I had the stomach capacity, I would have downed the entire dessert. Alas, I had but one stomach to give that night, so I managed only to finish half.",dnNXirfyr8xcUS6E56oRIg,0,0,5,UDjkYGJePDmUbagAW4TZbw

Loberster risotto: 4/10.  Lobster was over cooked.  Risotto wasnt super great. My friends comment that trader Joe's lobster risotto was better is true.. I agree that a bagged risotto is better. Wow. How can be saying that. But true

Seared scallops.  6/10 Came out over done. Pretty good flavor composition with them

Beef Wellington 6.5/10 . (The most famous dish)  dish was cooked just fine. Just super bland. Regular unflavored mashed potatoes and few steamed carrot. Really? Didnt get much blander. Keep in mind this dish is 49$ regularly.  

Coffee ice cream brownie dessert. 7.5/10. This actually was pretty good. 

Service was really good. 

Overall I would never come back and actually pay for a meal here. Super sad we wasted our 180 comp on this place.",9Tpj9NIj38zp9BiG_kDL6g,1,0,3,Hs3iCRrwQZTWytoPzIkdoA

$60 for three courses:


First:  caesar salad or pumpkin soup. 
There were two of us so we tried each one, and both were excellent. 
The caesar salad was crisp and bright with delicious parmesean cheese frico. 
The flavor of the soup was amazing, with just enough of the spicy chorizo, creme fraiche and toasted pepitas!

Main: beef wellington - it was absolutely perfect 

Dessert: Sticky Toffee Pudding with a scoop of speculoos ice cream - it was delicious and a must try, even if you don't typically ""do desserts"" (like me).

The timing of the food delivery was very good. Our server was excellent and the assistant servers (who brought our items and kept our beverages filled) were also perfect.
We made a lunch reservation for 11:45am and arrived shortly after 11:30am. When we arrived, the restaurant was about 70% full and they were able to seat us after a few minute wait. By the time we left the restaurant an hour or so later, all tables were full and there was a line of people waiting to be seated. 
TIP:  MAKE A RESERVATION FOR LUNCH OR DINNER
There is additional seating at the bar, and about 6-8 high top tables in the bar area. The bar area was completely full as well, and I can only imagine how packed it must be during the dinner/cocktail hour.

I wouldn't spend $50 to eat there because I love food so much I'd rather drop $500 elsewhere. I'm giving two stars for stellar service but the food was absolutely terrible.

I know it's been open for 2 weeks so they need little more time to improve... but it's Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. 

when we sat, table wasn't balanced, asked them to fix it but still the same. We had to hold the table during our meal. ""Bad!!""

Ordered Lobster risotto... good, well balanced. Really liked a lot. ""But small portion""

Scallop... terrible, over cooked and very thin sliced cut.. ""over priced""

Fillet mignon $47.
ordered mid rare. 
First one came little over mid, dried, very salty seasoned. Worst fillet ever in my life. 
Asked for make another one... 
New fillet mignon, it looks mid rare but really dried in & out. I could buy meat at the whole food and could make better than this. No juicy at all. Taste ""dried"" and hard to swallow, ""salty"" as hell!!!

Dry aged steak ny strip $49.
Ordered mid. 
Came out well done. 
We had to Asked for another one because it was too ""tough to chew"".
New steak, came in perfectly. This one would be my best dish here. Steak and shishito pepper are perfectly balanced each other! It was really good.

Dessert, pineapple carpaccio... ""tasty""!

We never send back our dish and this was our first time. Feel bad but we had some expectation from Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Plus we were not the only one who sent the dish on that day. Saw few more.

Service... good. Polite and friendly. Our server tried to make it up for kitchen's mistake 

We visited Gordon Ramsey's steak, burger and finally Hells Kitchen. So we had little expectation from those two.

Burger... 5 star. Good
Hell's Kitchen... 1 star food 5 star service

Quickly seated to our table, drinks were ordered and delivered. David was great at explaining the menu and describing food and drinks - truly a professional!

Even the rest of the team were right there always anticipating our needs! Drinks & waters were ways being refilled without any of us having to ask.

Since it was everyone's first time here, we did our best to order many of the menu items so we could all sample the food.

Ah. Mazing!

Seafood Tower: everyone loved it! (I don't eat seafood) the lobster tails were pretty buds and so were the shrimp prawns. The presentation on a three tiered ice tray was an impressive display.

Foies Gras: This was simply delicious! Seared perfect with a nice soft buttery inside and the carrot cake was a great contrast of sweet & salty!

Wagyu meatballs: not only were the meatballs cooked perfectly, the sauce is bright and vibrant - just perfect!

Seared Scallops: a perfect hit with everyone, all I heard was, ""omg!"" Or ""mmmm"" - it was almost musical...

Entrees: 

Beef Wellington: I like it so much, I want to learn to make it for myself! The pastry dough was just nice and flaky with the meat cooked medium well.

Filet Mignon: Cooked just right!

Tomohawk Steak: This was what I ordered and I will be honest, I think I could eat this whole thing - I'll try it when I come back again!

The Rack Of Lamb: oh, I took a bite and it was just a good party in my mouth! I'll have to order that for myself in the future!

Pineapple Carpaccio with Coconut Sorbet: I did not expect the dry ice presentation but this dish is awesome visually but it also tastes amazing! As an island boy from Hawaii, I would so eat this all the time during a hot summer day!

Sticky Toffee Pudding: Ultimate dessert! I highly recommend that everyone try this buttery, melt in your mouth pudding! It's truly, as my mom would say, ""orgasmic""!

Special shout out to our amazing friends: Gil & David! These two serve up the Best Customer Experience, I hope you get the pleasure of meeting them!

I think everyone should go to Hell....'s Kitchen!

Happy people = happy customers!

As a huge fan of the show, I was excited to get inside and snap pics and view the menu. The waitstaff was dressed elegantly and the inside looked like the set of the TV show with the red and blue jackets and bandannas on the chefs. There was a wall of each winner of each season of Hell's Kitchen. I had the jidori chicken scallopini and I finished every morsel. The iced tea came with a shot glass of simple syrup and lemon slice and was promptly refilled.  I can't wait to go back and try more food.",P83RXjZlSzJzj3coR2lkew,1,0,5,SwGTDwb7tTnaJC16c1VTjA
3247915,2018-06-07,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I came here expecting it to wow me in every way, since it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. My experience did not even match up to what I thought the restaurant would give me...

I ordered from the lunch set menu since he is known for his Beef Wellington. I had the Caesar Salad for the appetizer and it was the best dish for the entire meal! I love the large portion and the handmade croutons and baked cheese. It was quite delicious for just a salad. I was expecting all of Gordon's Ramsay's dishes to be just like this one. I also ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. This dish was cold when it came to my table and there was TOO MUCH peas on it. The pea paste that was below the scallop piece overpowered the scallop, since it taste like I was eating bland baby food. 

The Beef Wellington was a disappointment. It was SO BLAND. Everyone at my table agreed they could've at least seasoned the steak with salt and pepper. There was such a thin puff pastry layer that was not flaky or crispy at all when I had my first bite. It was quite soggy. It would be better off ordering just the steak by itself without the puff pastry around it. I would have enjoyed that better because of the butter knives the restaurant gives you. I mean steak is suppose to be cooked right so you can cut it like butter, but come on why are there still BUTTER KNIVES USED AS STEAK KNIVES. I had a hard time cutting through that cold thick slab of meat with a butter knife. Come on, Gordon Ramsay! Can't you afford steak knives for everyone??? The whole entire dish was cold when it came to me. I guess they want to present all the entrees at once for each table, but that made all the dishes cold by the time it got to you. 

The dessert was Sticky Toffee Pudding with a scoop of Speculoos Cookie Butter Ice Cream on top. I like the large portion they give you because most places give you tiny desserts. I'm a big fan of cookie butter, so I loved the ice cream! I wish they gave me ice cream then since a small scoop. The Sticky Toffee Pudding taste good like every other one I've had before. 

I had the drink Rum Donkey which is their version of a Moscow Mule. It was delicious and it was cool how they had a little shell on top of the drink to light a flame. I like the cup that it was served in also. 

Service was alright here. I feel like they need to train their staff a bit more. I asked for a straw and it took like 15 minutes to receive....I watched my waiter walk the entire restaurant and even get stopped by others and to grab drinks TWICE before I even got my straw. I don't understand....he wasn't very responsive either. He didn't ask if we were finished with our plate before removing them or even respond with an okay when we asked for something. I couldn't tell if he was listening and got the order, so it was like a waiting game to see if he did hear us.",qZYxWYTMfbFBklcbXvpp_w,2,0,3,gG1LS6IJ870CqykE8I0LQg

3255846,2018-04-14,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I ordered the 3 course beef Wellington during lunch. My boyfriend ordered a standard cheeseburger and meatballs for appetizer. Service started off efficient and quick, but began slowing down tremendously as the meal progressed. My pumpkin soup which was delicious was initially brought out with no chorizo, must've confused my order with another. My boyfriend's burger was also wrong, they brought out a Hell's kitchen burger (with the ghost pepper) instead of what was ordered. They corrected it for us and when the server came by she apologized for the mix up and said she would come back to see how his hamburger was. However, she never asked but if she had, we would've told her that the bottom bun was pretty soggy.... a tad disappointing. Ok.... My beef Wellington was SUPERB! I'm still thinking about it months later. I'm usually a ribeye girl but WOW. You have to try it. Meatball appetizer was fine. The sticky toffee dessert was good but not extraordinary, and it's large enough for 3 people to share. Honestly, the service was wonderful aside from all the waiting between dishes. Oh and it didn't help that the table next to us was receiving their food before us when they came and ordered after us, they were also a party of 2.... Not a huge deal but i did notice this. I still give Chef Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen 4 stars because I LOVE him almost as much as his beef Wellington. :)",wMKnJoxbKs4zGkhfdIxPnA,1,1,4,67XBD9_j-k87J-IILMin1g

It's a separate building on the Caesars property and had the usual HK markings. Inside there is a que for waiting to be seated. We only waited about 10 minutes before we were seated. The main dining room and open kitchen are very similar to the tv show and that was expected. 

Our waiter was friendly and knew the menu. We chose the 3 course tasting menu and started with the scallops. This was followed by the beef Wellington and then dessert. I was impressed with the quality of the food, especially the beef. It is a very old school French dish that was done perfectly. Clearly the cooks know how to prepare this. The price of $72/pp was actually a great value. The wines were impressive too and we found Orin Swift Abstract at a reasonable price. 

I am not a fan of the show at all and as a chef know my way around a kitchen. I would return again. I did take a star off because the ambiance was kind of tacky as far as merchandising, but the food is legit!",QVfL4FZI4Iwd0Kaoeo-K1A,1,0,4,deFHk4dL06-39woO_nfS9A

Me and my girlfriend both ordered the beef wellington (saw it on tv and had to try it, and I wanted my own plate...so we ordered two haha). 
Anyway, the entree' was amazing..and so was the dessert - I highly recommend you try the sticky toffee pudding - very tasty indeed.

So yes the food was amazing - BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, me and my GF recieved a level of service that we dare say ""was near if not completely perfect""... from the time we walked through the doors, we were greeted with A+++ service.

But once we were seated, our waitress, Britney haris, (or britney harry, sorry if im spelling it wrong) gave us the type of royal service that you only see at prestigious country clubs which we frequent throughout the year. She was speedy, exceptionally professional, friendly, and her smile made us feel welcomed. In fact, i very rarely write yelp reviews, but Britney's overzealous approach towards serving us left me feeling compelled to write this review. More servers should study her craft, a nice smile, and an upbeat attitude can go a long way. And it especially made us feel the need to return.

We have eaten there twice, at night, and have asked for her specifically, unfortunately she wasn't there. (The second time we primarily returned due to the service we recieved from britney the first time). Hopefully she works dinner more often, Hell's kitchen may just become our ""go to for date night"".

3352491,2018-06-09,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I think this is too hyped up of a place!  Went here last night to see what the fuss is all about and why it's fully booked for dinner for months. We sat at the bar as it's open seating there. Got there around 7.30 and had to wait close to half an hour before a couple seats became available.

We started with some cocktails. I tried the Scottish kiss and my friend tried notes from gordon. Both drinks were done well and the notes from Gordon came with a little message in a rolled union jack paper. Kind of like a fortune cookie, except the message contained some joke lol.

We didn't order any entree as the selections offered were not that interesting. I've had Ramsay's beef wellington before at his steakhouse inside Paris hotel & casino. The only other entree on the menu I would consider trying was the rack of lamb, but I was more interested in trying out the different appetizers, so we ended up sharing lobster risotto, scampi prawn flambe, tuna tartare, and a dozen of oysters. All of them tasted good, but not wow good if you know what I mean. I liked the tuna tartare the best out of all the dishes we tried, but you can get tasty tuna tartare at other places. Nothing really stood out here. I do have to say that the prawns were impressively presented with flaming fire and all, so that was pretty entertaining to watch.

We closed our dinners with the sticky toffee pudding, which I've also had at Ramsay's pub and it's still one darn good dessert.

My overall impression is that this restaurant does great presentation with its food (maybe put too much importance on it, instead of focusing on more important thing when it comes to food, namely flavor), but it comes across as quite showy and gimmicky with no great taste and flavor backing the food. Out of his 3 restaurants I've tried here in Vegas, I think the pub is the best one.

We had great service at the bar and they offer full menu there, so might as well sit there if you don't want to wait for months to get in for dinner. Our bartender, Tim was awesome, so props to him!",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,5,0,3,nzQtgdH_KmR4Af_j8LUgig

They didn't have openings here for dinner so we reserved a time for lunch.  It was faster to walk here from our hotel (Venetian) than drive because of all the traffic and dealing with parking.  I love the decor of the place and the outfits of the servers.  Our server had great recommendations and was super sweet.  She remembered that we had two birthdays in our party of seven so she sent us another free sticky toffee pudding.

They only serve HALF the beef wellington at lunch time and it comes in a set with salad or soup and sticky toffee pudding for $60.  Not really worth the money if you ask me, since you get a full sized beef wellington at dinner for a similar price.  

What's funny is that the pumpkin soup and sticky toffee pudding wowed me more than the beef wellington.  I really enjoyed the pumpkin soup and the chorizo in it was very unique.  I didn't know they would be pouring the pumpkin soup at the table, so I was wondering why they were serving me a nearly empty plate with some chorizo bits in it.  The sticky toffee pudding was liked by everyone in our group of seven.  We all just wished the ice cream to pudding ratio was more equal.  I wouldn't have minded more ice cream and less pudding.

The Hell's Kitchen Burger was HUGE and delicious - just wish there was a bit more avocado.  It packed a little kick because of the ghost pepper jack cheese.  The fries that came with it were perfect.

I would love to come back in the future to try the lobster risotto which is another popular dish on their show.  I watched the YouTube video on how they make it and was drooling, but there's no way I could recreate that masterpiece so I'll have to come back.",XP6wvJpisEXtz_co02CXXw,0,0,4,xS1YyLh7p1X6h1aTlJ2O5g

Each of those visits were memorable, I just couldn't wait to come to Hell's Kitchen and see if it could top it all.

Made a reservation with AMEX Concierge since everywhere else is harder. The strange thing is that it was very easy to change the original reservation from 2 to 4 a few days before, then a last minute change to 7. Some tables were empty at 5:20pm on this Saturday so I suppose it really isn't as bad now as it was when they inaugurated. 

1- Wagyu Meatballs $18. Nothing especial about this except it was too salty and heavy to be an appetizer. Too cheesy and greasy for my liking and the wagyu part, couldn't tell.

2- Lobster Risotto $24. The lobster was great, fresh and slightly raw inside which made it taste like sashimi. The rice was not as flavorful as expected. It was almost like a pile of yellow congee.

3- Beef Wellington $49. Much better than the beef wellington at Gordon Ramsay Steak. The pastry wasn't mushy and the beef tender to an impossible tenderness. Unfortunately it was a tad too salty and it needed much more sauce to accompany each cut. 

4- Wild Mushrooms $9. Terrible. Oily and flavorless. I am pretty sure they forgot to season this. 

5- Sticky Toffee Pudding $9. Incredible! even better than GR Steaks' which is a little different. We couldn't have enough of this perfectly sweet, warm bread pudding. The speculoos ice cream was possibly the best pairing i've ever seen in the world of desserts! I wish I could have this every day.

I also tried the Tomahawk $195 but It was just okay. I don't know why but the food here was not impressive as a whole and I will not be coming back here. Definitely will be going to GR Steak though. Very nice service albeit too fake.",wClUV2KsLWNZwOw5nlw6UQ,4,0,3,HjNkf77VcdmpmUs8vs3tmQ

Full disclosure - I have watched nearly every season of Hell's Kitchen. In fact, I've watched pretty much everything Gordon Ramsay has put on TV. As soon as I heard this restaurant was opening, I knew I needed to make a trip.

Finally, the time was right for my family and I to get to Vegas. We immediately booked reservations, and I anxiously counted down the days.

From the moment you step in the door, you get the true Hell's Kitchen vibe. Gordon yells at you on a TV screen at the door, and the decor is spot on. The kitchen looks like it is split into the red and blue kitchen, just like TV. There is lots of natural light, and it's spacious. 

Our waiter took us to our seats and gave us the menu. It was a no-brainer for me. The price fixe menu, at $72, was what I had to go for. I ordered all of Gordon's essential Hell's Kitchen dishes: the scallops, the beef wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding.

All of these were exactly what I was hoping for. The beef wellington, in particular, is a must-try here. I can't imagine going to Hell's Kitchen and ordering any other entree, honestly. The beef was cooked perfectly, and it was moist and tender. The pastry shell was browned, and the duxelles  added a great flavor. It was so good.

And do I need to even write about the scallops and pudding? Absolutely  great. It's not a true Michelin Star restaurant by any means, but the food is definitely up to Gordon Ramsay's standards. I also got to meet the head chef, who won Hell's Kitchen All Stars. It was absolutely a fantastic dining experience. 

Overall, please try this place if you're a fan of the show, and even if you're not. You will not be disappointed.",4G67W-x27pgzIi_mm4WZWg,1,0,5,DxDLpX-tdBqhDTwL40sbDw

I wanted to give Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen five stars because i think he really is a fantastic chef and person but we ordered a chicken dish and it came out raw which left a bad taste in my mouth for this trendy restaurant.  I stand by my three star rating and I feel generous giving that because of the oversight with the chicken dish... hopefully they will work their kinks out or get rid of some of the chefs in the kitchen because well you know the saying...

The wine list was mediocre but they charged an arm and a leg.  The food was ok.  We got the Wellington, lamb, risotto, scallops and some starters.  Nothing was great enough to rave about.

All you need to know for your first experience at Hell's Kitchen is the 3 course lunch menu.  Seriously, this is prob my favorite commercialized spot in Vegas at this point in time.  Cmon...what do they always cook on every single episode of Hell's Kitchen?  Beef wellington, of course!!!  

First though, you get a choice between caesar salad or white asparagus soup.  I was able to try both and have zero complaints.  Beef wellington...DELISH.  Perfectly cooked, served with delicious garnishes...I could taste every single ingredient.  It was everything I thought it would be.  Lastly, the sticky toffee pudding.  This dessert is huge...and probably one of the best, if not the best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had.

Our server also had a fantastic personality and kept the meal lighthearted.  At the end, we asked if we could take a photo with Michelle, head chef and last season's winner.

When we first walked in I was not greated by the hostess. I then asked her to help me locate our party. She rudely responded  ""We don't do that here ,you have to go look for them your self"". I had never been in the restaurant so I felt so awkward walking around people who were eatting. 

After finding my friends there was long wait between shift change of servers. Causing a huge delay between my entrees and my friends entrees coming out. The new server was this creepy, overly tan, John Stamos Homeless looking man. Who made the most uncomfortable comments to me and my friends. For example he dropped my spoon and picked it up and said "" I needs to lay off the crack"" . Then returned with the new one and proceeded to touch my friend's hair to see what her tattoo on her back looked like, It was aweful. Not to mention the silverware was spotty with food still attached to it. The glasswear had hard water stains, yucky.

As far as our food went I ordered the beef wellington which was amazing! Just like I always dreamed it would be on the show. They also have a rice pudding dessert. I'm not sure why they don't call it spotted dick, I almost passed not recognizing the traditional British name. But it so delicious!

But on our way out we had four male servers lineup and checked me and the group of girls out as we walk past, make it weird again.

I have to say how impressed I was with level of service along with food.  We were a little early for our reservation so after we checked in, we ordered a couple of drinks from the bar.  While we were waiting we stood over need the cook's line and watched the show from the open kitchen designed like the show with two sides.  One of the food runners was very kind to walk us through the highlights of the menu and how everything works both in front and back of the house.  He was very kind and informative.  He even suggested and encouraged us to talk a picture of with the winner of last season, Michelle.  She took the time to take our picture even thought she was busy expediting the food.

We were sat along the window overlooking the strip, so if we couldn't see the action for the kitchen we say the action on the street.  Our server was very attentive and walked us through the choices of the regular menu and the prefixed menu.

We decided to order off the menu.  We started off with the Caesar salad and the Lobster Risotto.  Both were very good and had nice flavor.  I like the amount of lemon in the salad.

We then had the Beef Wellington...of course and the lamb chops.  The Wellington was prepared perfectly and I loved the flavor.  The Lamb Chops can not warm at all, and once it came back from being improved it was very good.  We also had the macaroni and cheese and Brussel Sprouts.  Both were very good.  We ended with the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was good also.

The first was a bit disappointing, with a soggy pastry and a non-existent duxelles layer. Or was there supposed to be any? I'm not quite sure, but I suppose the prix fixe is menu was worth a try. The pumpkin soup was flavorful with the spicy chorizo (which I swear has star anise in it), though the chorizo was a little too burnt. The beef wellington, as I mentioned above, was disappointing. I think the fillet was a bit undercooked, along with the puff pastry that was just plain soggy. I would not say it was made the Gordon way. The mash potatoes were also just whatever, but at least the presentation was nice. The eggs in purgatory were surprisingly delicious, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like tomatoes. The spicy tomato sauce (with mint?) was surprisingly flavorful and left me wanting more. Too bad it's such an expensive dish for what it is. On the other hand, the lobster risotto was undercooked (hard rice grains = big no no), and the medium burger was well done. The sticky toffee pudding was, however, amazing, and despite how sweet (and a good portion) it was, we finished it between two people. It was warm, moist, and just the right amount of toffee. It was not as ""sticky"" as I had imagined, like other versions, but it was oooh ooh delicious! I highly recommend trying the sticky toffee pudding, if nothing else. They were also generous and gave us a complimentary one for our birthday lady.

I love the art deco and modern ambience at this restaurant, with big windows looking out onto the strip, along with the suspender uniforms that their servers wear. I did not, however, like the over 30 minute wait for our food... Maybe it's because they haven't gotten a good system down because it's a new restaurant, but they really need to get on their service and even their cooking.

Ambiance/ atmosphere: 
Really packed, and extremely busy. The overall interior design and views are great. Gives off a nice initial vibe. 

Food:
Came with a party of 3, and ordered 2 set meals (scallops/ beef wellington/ toffee pudding), and a crispy skin salmon with mac and cheese side. 

The meal started out with complimentary hummus bites. Really delicious! Though, too little to be savoured. 

Scallop appetisers. These were great, as I had expected nothing less. (Picture attached. Was missing one scallop, couldn't help myself). 

Beef Wellington: 
It looked much better than it tasted. While the meat was cooked medium rare, it was a bit more cooked than preferred. I always think it's better to cook a bit under, than over. (You can always re-fire an under done wellington, but will always need to dump an overdone one). (Picture attached) 

Crispy salmon with mac and cheese side: 
Salmon tasted great, but not rave worthy. The mac and cheese side really gave the scallops a run for it's money. While some may dislike it, as it was swimming in cheese, I think thats the only way to serve it. 

Sticky Toffee pudding: 
A dish I've actually attempted at making myself. To much surprise, it wasn't very sweet at all. It was leaning towards a more fluffy, unflavoured birthday cake. Probably the least favourite of all.

Service: 
Service was a real toss-up between poor and great. Our main server seemed very unorganised and walked around a lot. When we were not served our second pudding, we had to flag down our server, as they walked past us. It was very rare that they came by, asking how we were doing. When we let them know about our situation, they were completely oblivious. 

However, one of the busser's provided us with some of the best service i've seen. They took some time to talk with my group, stop by frequently to see how we were, help us with water refills, and even spent a little bit of time thanking us for dining at HK. They should be the ones that deserve the tips. 

Overall impressions:

3550337,2018-05-13,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Apps- Lobster Risotto (my husband has been raving about it for years and it was his number one had to get item) I'm not a fan of the show yet he is and he said the serving was about half what he sees on the show.  Hardly enough for the both of us to share (so we got another app).  Didn't have much flavor and I honestly think rice a roni is better.  To have so much hype and it not even be 'good' was very disappointing, even for my husband.  Said the pre-made risotto cake we get from fresh market is better.  
Scallops- delicious yet tiny.  Looks like they were cut in half.  5 of then for $22, and they were probably 1-1.5 inches in diameter.  Great presentation with pea purée but again, so not worth the money.
Husband had the filet- very tender, but not much else going for it.  Bland, a little dry.  About $50 and didn't even come with a side.  
I had a burger, though a lot of sandwiches sounded good so it was hard to choose.  Probably the best value for the money on the menu, but again had little flavor.  Even the fries were just okay, although they were crispy which I like.  
Total bill for 2 people with a beer and 2 teas was over $120 without tip.  
Service was excellent, very nice and professional, constantly coming to fill drinks and remove empty dishes.  Ambience was nice, surprised most people were wearing very casual clothes.

Treason and deception! We arrived in Las Vegas could not miss it... Gordon Ramsay opened 7 weeks ago & we had to go. The master of culinary experience, some still call him the king of food, food was fair. $120 (without wine or dessert) for 2 for lunch - did not impress us. We had reservations but waited 20 minutes to be seated at the worse table of the restaurant (bad luck), table was next to order station & hostess choose to seat my wife facing the waiters & valet of waiters coming in and out of the kitchen - instead of the view of window which was nice. I recuested another table & hostess response was those are for VIP's - she hesitated after I insisted& when I asked ""how do I become a VIP "" she had no clue. I didn't know there were 2 sets of clients when you reserve? She finally went to ask & returned by seating us at another table. She didn't tell the waiter we were there & when we complained about a smelly glass, the waiter said he was not inhormed we were there. He changed the glass- threw away the full glass of sparkling water we paid for & when my wife called him on it, he said I will get you another bottle. The food was good but not like ""wow"" with a limited menu. Then we ordered espresso that was really horrible - tasted like dirt- and they forgot the spoon and the sugar -- after all what Gordon promotes on his show about quality of service and perfection - a real disappointing experience. & I would not recommend Hells Kitchen in Las Vegas !",bMfqef4yzGMNn5CAJuqaNA,0,0,2,l4IrZz-soYK4KaQT9wZOjg

My husband and I got the following things:

Lobster Risotto - Pretty good although definitely on the smaller side. 

Beef Wellington - I was hesitant to order this but since it's the signature I thought I'd try it. I generally like my meat medium so I think I was a little underwhelmed. If you like your meet medium rare you'll probably enjoy this more. 

Crispy Skin Salmon - I wasn't crazy about this. The skin was really good but the salmon was just okay. The capers were decent but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. 

Mac and Cheese - ordered this on a whim because of the table next to us and it was REALLY GOOD. Pasta was nice and soft. Very cheesy. If you're a fan of Mac and cheese this is definitely worth getting. If you're so-so I'd just pass because this probably won't change your mind. 

Sticky Toffee Pudding - Pretty good. Not to sweet and a good way to end the meal.

I asked and she said it was really dry. I looked around for the server again, but didn't see her  when she came back, we told the server about the chicken and asked for more sauce. She brought some au jus. The brussel sprouts we're flavorless except for the pickled peppers that were mixed in. I was my mom's bday. We ordered the cheesecake. It was a long, short, narrow, sliver. It was super dense, but the flavor was ok. You could tell it had been sitting in a cooler with the toppings already on it. It had a candle, but no ""Happy Birthday"" written on it.

While planning the celebration of my husband's birth WEEK, I happened to read about Chef Gordon Ramsay's upcoming opening of his latest restaurant in Las Vegas, Hell's Kitchen.  I took note that the Grand Opening celebration would be during the same week we'd be staying in Las Vegas and looked into making dining reservations.  I luckily snagged a reservation for lunch as we ""squeezed"" this dine into our vacation.

This restaurant can be found on S Las Vegas Blvd on the same grounds as Caesar's Palace.  This building formerly housed Serendipity 3 and the Stripside Café.  There is parking in the Caesar's Palace parking lots or valet parking in front of the hotel's entrance.  However, it's very accessible to foot traffic along S Las Vegas Boulevard.

Upon entry to Hell's Kitchen, you're greeted by a video image of Chef Ramsay as he invites you in.  You're surrounded by a Hell's Kitchen Gift Shop and met by the ""Wall of Winners (Hell's Kitchen)"".  Winner of season 16 was in house but whoever wins Season 17 will have the contract as the head chef of this kitchen.  As the hostess leads you to your seat, you'll undoubtedly take notice of the ""competition kitchen"" featuring Red and Blue Teams.  The high ceilings reveal chandeliers made up of Devil's Pitchforks.  Comfortable and masculine looking grey leather upholstered chairs, booths or banquettes fill the dining area without being overly crowded.

LUNCH:  The lunch menu was straight-forward and as expected, fiery chili sauces or condiments were on the menu.  The beverage menu featured a variety of wines (red, white & rosé) by the glass, draught selections, cocktails and non-alcoholic aka mocktails.

-hell's kitchen burger:  bacon, avocado, Fresno chili jam, crispy onion, ghost pepper cheese, and seasoned fries.  The burger doneness appeared to be medium-rare rather than medium-well as my husband requested.  But, nonetheless, my husband didn't complain and still enjoyed the flavorful burger. $22

-short rib grilled cheese:  sourdough bread, caramelized onions, white cheddar cheese and fingerling potato chips.  Thankfully, this succulently-cooked boneless short rib sandwich wasn't a huge portion.  Its rich beefy flavor and tender bite worked well with the soft caramelized onions.  The melted white cheddar in this sandwich added a slight sharpness and the filling was slightly reminiscent of French Onion Soup.  The grilled sourdough bread held the tender filling in with each bite as some of the filling ""threatened"" to ooze out with each bite.  A cup of fingerling potato chips complemented this scrumptious sandwich.  $19

We didn't want to overeat on this day as we had plans to ride the High Roller, do some gambling and dine at Yardbird Southern Kitchen & Bar.  However, as our vacation was coming to an end,  we did have thoughts of returning for dinner but we just chalked it up to saying ""we'll be back"".

NOTE:  In addition to the Hell's Kitchen Wall of Winners, there is also a Wall of Losers located toward the back of the restaurant.  Also, the pitchfork motif adorns the restrooms.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,24,23,4,dri-wXafpK9RxfL0z17vUw

3670481,2018-06-01,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Dinner here was the highlight of my whole vegas trip last weekend for Memorial Day weekend. We had Sunday night reservations here and promptly seated about 10-15 minutes after we got there -- they had originally seated us in the back area but we requested to be seated in the front area near the kitchen so they accommodated us. Our server was extremely helpful and provided stellar service; I don't remember his name but he was the best. We ordered the pre-fixe menu which included the scallops appetizer, the beef Wellington, and a sticky toffee pudding. We also added on an additional order of the lobster risotto. I was tempted to order the crispy skin salmon as well but luckily I didn't because we were pretty full after all the food we got, but I'm definitely going to be trying that next time. All the food was delicious; the scallops were perfectly seared, the risotto was slightly different from the usual, it was a saffron tomato risotto which is a recipe created by chef Michelle, the winner on HK season 17 who also happened to be working there that night. We also ordered 2 cocktails -- one of them came in a box with steam coming out of it and the other one contained a note from gordon Ramsay (one of his quotes lol). I don't usually like desserts as much but the sticky toffee pudding was probably my favorite dish; it was extremely delicious. At the end, we were even able to take a picture with Michelle! Definitely recommended -- the food was really good, the service was excellent, and overall it was a pretty good & memorable experience.",3TCjUW662RHizV8ED4CrRQ,0,0,5,CWbZ2CRXiNNuE0urngUWbA
3672180,2018-02-12,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I'm still dreaming of beef wellington. That pretty much sums up my visit here. I have always wanted to try Gordon Ramsay's famous beef wellington and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. I thought the ambiance here would be a little more formal but you could wear more casual clothing. Maybe because went early in the day (around 230). The kitchen is full view and set up like the show.  You have your red and blue jackets cooking away this amazing beef wellington, or whatever else you have ordered.
I had the Prix fixe menu which came with seared scallops or Cesar salad, I chose the salad, beef wellington, and a sticky toffee pudding. In hindsight, I should've had the scallops. The salad was just an average salad. It was good but nothing spectacular. Then comes the highlight of the meal. The beef wellington. Served with root vegetables and potato puree. Cooked medium, it was so tender and melt in your mouth. Flaky puff pastry that is so buttery, and crispy. I'm drooling.
The sticky pudding was also to die for. Served a la mode with speculoos ice cream. Yummy. For a cocktail I had the Notes from Gordon. It's a gin cocktail that comes with a snarky note in true Gordon fashion. This was also delicious. I would definitely be back here if I'm in Vegas again.",CjybI82gUq0VzRcH3qJqew,1,1,5,hVSgWS-yMv7UlDBAASdBmw
3673995,2018-04-14,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I've watched the show, and I've been waiting for this moment for quite a while now. I finally got a dinner reservation here this past week (granted we booked it a month in advance). 

When we arrived, we were lead through the busy dining area to a small table in the back of the restaurant in the overflow area. From our view, we didn't have the iconic Hells Kitchen open kitchen view, but we did have a nice view of the Vegas Strip. 

We ordered a few appetizers to start, the Shrimp Flambe, Foie Gras, Scallops, and Lobster Risotto. The Shrimp Flambe was presented with a nice flame broiled effect, but did only come with 3 pieces of shrimp. The Lobster Risotto and Scallops were good, but on the smaller side. The best of these was the Foie Gras, which had a super tasty umami flavor and had a perfect cook on it. If you are hungry or on more of a budget, go for the Macaroni and Cheese since it's by far the most filling and still is yummy. 
Nothing about the veggies were phenomenal. I tried the potato gratin, the cauliflower, and the brussel sprouts (which were my favorite). 

My favorite entree was by far the Lamb!! It came with a good sized portion and had the rich lamb savory lamb flavor that I love. The salmon had a good pan sear on it, but I wish it was packed with more seasoning or flavor. I also tried the Beef Wellington, and it was the first time ever having it before so I really couldn't compare it to any others.

The star of the night was by far the Sticky Toffee Pudding!! You need to try this if you come for anything at all. The cake was so moist, packed with a rich caramel flavor but not too sweet, and a salty caramel ice cream. I devoured it so quickly, and I was tempted to buy another. Yum! I'm still dreaming about it. We also had the pineapple carpaccio, which comes in 

This place is a tourist attraction, and you pay for the Gordon Ramsey name and the fame behind HK. Overall, for the priciness of the meal, I would have liked a more intimate setting and an overall more outstanding food experience. I probably would not go back for dinner, but I would definitely like to try lunch since I've heard great things about the burger!",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,1,2,4,zb5rXN9dzshs6j2BvMNlVw

3697805,2018-04-14,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Hell's Kitchen opened up in Las Vegas and I was so very excited to try it.  Open kitchen, yelling in the kitchen perhaps (didn't happen) and all my favorite items that I've been checking out on the show for years (season 1 fan till now) but I guess the reality didn't quite match up to my expectations.  We went there for lunch service and I walked into an entrance that features all the hell's kitchen winners. Even with a reservation we waited in a line with people who had reservations and walk ins but there were enough tables so not a big deal.  The actual restaurant itself was well decorated but isn't very intimate as you can hear what is being said all around you.  The kitchen was broken up into the red and blue but you could see that they were all collectively working on tickets.  It would have been nice to see some of the winners there helping the restaurant and as a fan of the show it would have made the experience so much more exciting.  Not a lot of the times that are featured were available for the lunch crowd but at least I got my lobster risotto.  

The risotto was delicious but I think the portion compared to what I was expecting from the show was rather small.  I wish I could have ordered that as my main and I would have loved it.  The appetizer oysters were also really good and the melt in your mouth kind of oysters.  They were raw so not much prep required but you could tell that they were of good quality.  They were out of Gordon's drink with a personal note so that was a fail for me.  When you open and are new how do you run out of an item that is featured.  The mains were ok ...my chicken as you can see was rather dry and there wasn't a lot of flavor or moisture.  I couldn't even finish it because it was dry and chewy ...I even tried using the delicious mashed potato side to try and make it tolerable but that didn't work.  

The overall experience while fun because I'm such a huge fan will not be repeated because at the end of the day the food wasn't what I expected from a signature type of restaurant.",abcHXT-6HatHmKmBdwkgyg,0,0,3,6QhC-_A6PT85Of8YPyn2ig

I looked up the list of places and I had no idea that this restaurant existed!  I was super excited and booked reservations right away!

This place was everything I hoped it would be and more!
The decor made you feel like you were on the set!
I had reservations for lunch on May 12 at 12:15pm and was seated right away!  The menu made it hard to choose what to get because everything sounded amazing!  I decided to get the Three-Course Lunch menu with the wine pairing which included a White Asparagus Soup, Beef Wellington, and Sticky Toffee Pudding to get a well rounded experience across the menu.  (I also got the Lobster Risotto because it always looks good on the show, haha). The White Asparagus Soup was served with micro greens and a tart/wafer/crunchy tube.  It was light and refreshing and it was presented well, being poured at your table, made it feel fancy!  Of course the white wine complemented the soup really well!  (Forgot to write down the names of the wines). The Beef Wellington was superb cooked medium-rare with a potato purée and red wine demi-glace that looked beautiful on the plate and was a delight to eat! The Cabernet Sauvignon pared with it was my favorite of the wines, pared very well!  Okay, the Sticky Toffee Pudding was out of this world!  It was warm with a delicious scoop of speculoos ice cream on top.  Huge portion for one person, but it was amazing! I'll be dreaming of that dessert for a while!  Paired really nice with the port wine as well!

We got the lobster risotto, scallops, and a short rib grilled cheese. The food is the reason I would go back. There were a couple issues I thought about. One was that service was veryyyy slow. I wished there was a bread or cracker they would give you in between. If not, I atleast wished they would check on you and update you on your meal. The other issue was that, for the short rib grilled cheese. It came to our table with no meat or onions. What was odd is that you could see small bits of meat so you could tell it was on the sandwich and then they took it off.  We had to send it back and get it remade. When we did, they said that the kitchen read our order that specified no pork in our meals as no meat so he took it off. My huge concern with that is that if I did have a meat allergy, intolerance, or preference, the kitchen tried to serve me a sandwich with meat bits on it without remaking one. This was bad kitchen etiquette and I know Chef Ramsay would never allow that. Thankfully it was delicious.  

The atmosphere was great and I loved that there was a red and blue kitchen like the show.

Highlights:
1. The Crispy Salmon: I'm literally still dreaming about this. The perfect crispy skin and an amazing citrusy sauce with capers and onions and I just can't deal with how good it was :D
2. Foie Gras (hoping I spelled that right): Not at all what I expected, but perfectly prepared. A great mix of flavors in little bites of happiness. 
3. The Sticky Toffee Pudding: I mean commmeee oonnnnnnnn ... it was moist and decadent, yet not too heavy. Served with ice cream (b/c obviously) and the perfect way to end the meal. 
4. The Presentation: They take their presentation seriously here, as well they should with the GR name attached. Everything from the drinks to the desserts was amazingly presented. Best presentation of all was the ""smoke on the blvd"" cocktail... order it, just trust me. 
5. The Staff: Very rarely have I met a staff that was so professional and still very down to earth and cool. They were on top of it every step of the way. 

Honestly I can't really find much to say that's a negative here. I will definitely point out that it is pricey $$$ and that reservations are hard to get, but those shouldn't come as a surprise for one of Vegas's hottest new restaurant.

And now, the food. Average, rather bland ceasar salad. Good, but by no means outstanding. The others at the table with steak and lamb had similar impressions. 

Overall very noisy. Not the dining experience we were expecting. We made it reservations within days off the restaurant opening and we're looking forward to a great experience but sadly leave disappointed. Minimal effort for service recovery with free drinks but we already had decided to cut our financial losses and drink water. Free drinks basically costs the restaurant nothing.

I'm delighted to say that our expectations were surpassed in every way. We were very fortunate to get a table right in the middle and up close to the open kitchen (people should know that there is a ""back room"" that doesn't give you as good of a view of the kitchen if that is important to you.) Our waiter was fabulous and helped us with our order. We, of course, ordered the Wellington, lamb, scallops and salmon. The presentations were all on point, just as we would expect. Then we dug in (sharing all the dishes). Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the taste-- just WOW!!
And the toffee caramel sponge cake dessert-- words will never do it justice!!

Go in if you care, avoid if you want service. Even the hostess stand doesn't care. Ramsey needs to focus on the complete service package, not just the chef side. Maybe one day he will understand what it is like to run a successful & pleasurable dining experience rather than just the ""best"" food.

SERVICE: 95 / 100
David was amazing in service tonight! Very knowledgeable of the menu and guided us in choosing the menu classics and secrets here at HK; quick to respond to our requests. Overall, a kind, funny, and very approachable person. If you ever get the chance to come here, ask for David as your server!

FOOD: 97.5 / 100
Pan-seared Scallops: Lovely sear on the outside, yet tender and al dente on the inside. The bacon garnish in the center of the plate complemented the scallops's lightly sweet flavor, which were further accented by the sauces. A classic Ramsay dish that I would love to experience again!

Wild Mushrooms: A perfect compliment to any beef dish, simple as that! It has an earthiness to it that runs well with the smoothness of the Beef Wellington.

Beef Wellington: Another Gordon Ramsay classic, one that is the hallmark of a Ramsay dining experience! The puff pastry is a shiny golden brown which has an amazing flakiness to it. The beef was a tender medium-rare, which, with the potato puree and demi-glacé, provided a party of flavors in my mouth! Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this!

Sticky Toffee Pudding: Wow. The portion size is quite large, so be prepared to share it with others at your table! The toffee pudding was very sweet, so I'd recommend enjoying this slowly, so as not to be overwhelmed by that flavor. The ice cream is a reasonable scoop, and the creaminess of that works well with the light pudding. Trust me, this is a dessert that you won't forget!

Wagyu Meatballs: Before talking about the meatballs, let's talk about the polenta croutons! I'd never had polenta before, and after trying it, I have to say that I'm a massive fan! It has a light crunch to it that reminds me of a potato tot -- a tater tot, as it's more commonly known -- which is complemented by the smoothness of the inside of the polenta croutons. As for the meatballs themselves...truly splendid! A firm meatball, as it didn't disintegrate in the lovely marinara sauce, with a punch of flavor that one should come to expect from a meatball! The cheese was an added touch, but felt unnecessary. I'd recommend this appetizer to anyone, second to the pan-seared scallop!

Virgin Manche Whisperer: Whatever the name of this non-alcoholic cocktail is, David sure knows that this is a well-kept secret here. Naturally sweet, nothing that overpowers the other in this fruity concoction! Rolls right off the taste buds and pairs well with any of the dishes on the menu!

VALUE: 90 / 100
For a party of four, $305 seems overpriced and doesn't provide the best ""bang-for-your-buck"" compared to other dining options on the Strip. However, given the attached baggage that are Gordon Ramsay and the Hell's Kitchen brands, the asking price is justifiable.

OVERALL SCORE: 94.2 / 100

----------

TL;DR: If you're looking for a dining experience on the Strip that is unforgettable, you can't go wrong with HK! From the pan-seared scallops to the beef wellington, the lobster risotto to the various selection of desserts and drinks, Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen is an unforgettable dining experience that one has to experience if they are unable to head out to Ramsay's three-Michelin-star restaurant in London!",cv5t03qvJkvdRYqh418qIg,0,0,5,N3GSe81SHv7Zuziy_N1kMg

The food here is very good but the service time is a bit too long. I can almost hear Gordon Ramsey start yelling at the staff for taking such a long time.

For that, I would give this place a 3.5 but I'll round up since the servers (Britney) were excellent and the food was amazing. I just wished they came quicker (lobster risotto took over 35 mins!) that is probably unacceptable on the show. 

I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was very tasty. I usually don't like bacon in my burger but it wasn't super overpowering. It was a bit on the saltier side but I can live with it. Was a bit spicy but didn't bother me.

Trust me, this is so true!!

I was hangry & the BF was just praying that we could eat soon so I wouldn't snap. *Angelic smile*

Welcome to HELL...

Ahhh yes, Chef Gordon Ramsay is infamous for his foul mouth & critical tongue when it comes to critiquing many dishes.

Chef Ramsay plays the diabolical angry chef on Hell's Kitchen & he takes that persona to a new level with HK.

The entire restaurant, including the restrooms, all have the ""pitchfork motif"".

From the restrooms to the kitchen, where he keeps the Red Team & Blue Team concept made famous in the show, the pitchforks are emblazoned on the ceiling, walls, & even the napkins!!

I had always wanted to try Chef Ramsay's burgers but for some reason or another never got to do so.

When this opportunity came about, I was ready to take on Hell!!

My friend was so gracious to make reservations for us & we were lucky to get in!!

HK just recently opened on the grounds of Caesar's Palace & the wait can be excruciatingly long if u don't have reservations.

For the first time in history, I was ready to order before our server even showed up!!

The lunch menu differs from the dinner menu, so I'm glad we came for lunch as I really wanted to try a burger.

I ordered the following:

Hell's Kitchen Burger. (3.5 stars).

Thick cuts of bacon. What's not to like about that?? The bacon was loaded with flavor but not terribly crispy.

Ghost pepper jack cheese... wow, that's unique!

Avocado anyone? Yes please! I love how a fresh avocado gives a cool, creamy, satisfying texture to any burger.

The HK burger is accompanied by house fries which were tasty but not terribly crispy.

The fresno pepper jam & jalapeños with the spicy aioli had a slow but evident heat that crept up on me. 

Good thing I love spicy food because after adding the jalapeños & aioli to my burger, it had a wicked kick!!

The brioche bun was soft & fluffy.

My burger was moist & seasoned perfectly. Thankfully the burger wasn't too juicy otherwise my bread would have fallen apart.

***

The BF ordered the charcuterie pizza which comes with tomato sauce, pepperoni, capicola, salami, prosciutto, & mozzarella.

I liked the name of the pizza as it sounded so intriguing. I had slice of capicola which was salty, in a delectable way, & delicious!

The BF ate the whole pizza, so one can only infer that he enjoyed it... Shocking... NOT!

***

Service was friendly but I felt like our server spoke at the speed of light?!

I had a hard time trying to process all the things she was saying & I felt myself leaning in as if that was going to help my slow brain understand her better. For the record, it did not.

Our food came out relatively quickly & we devoured our meal in no time!

I really loved the decor & the whimsical theme.

Note: if ur easily offended by the word HELL or pitchforks, this might not be the place for u. I say this because a couple that was at the bar complained about people using the word Hell & feeling like the devil was present. Strange that they would come here to eat... For me, I felt right at home!

Chef Ramsay is known for his beef wellington which has been featured on every single season of HK. Maybe next time I'll try it, but if not, I'm A-OK with having another one of his burgers!!",Z67zFhSzaTDiIMKtVcuFFw,23,20,4,3fzKdgyyyMFloL8sh0OgZg

I couldn't have had a better experience.my friend ordered the specialty : Gordon's Beef Wellington while I ordered the short rib. The beef Wellington was good, but the short rib.... oh my the short rib! It literally was like butter. No knife necessary! It had such a savory umami flavor. I would definitely order it again and again! Some neighbors at the bar ordered a smoky drink. It was so fun to watch. The bartenders and our neighbors were all so friendly. The atmosphere was definitely upscale, but it also found like a local hangout because everyone was so friendly! I highly recommend A visit!!",RVi0ztE14xb49Ur40HYL_Q,1,0,5,cqzR5KS_nHZrz7MM__2vfw
3763116,2018-01-23,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Lucky to score an 8pm reservation for last Saturday night; we were very excited to enjoy something we've waited over a year for. Being Hell's Kitchen show fanatics, watching all seasons and episodes; our expectations for a fun and experience filled evening awaited us. After being seated we were greeted by our friendly server, who explained the menu in depth and told us about Gordon himself. She asked if anyone had any food allergies, impressive and responsible...thanks for that! I asked if Gordon was in the house, but she sadly informed us that he was not; as he was a busy man tending to his 50 other restaurants and to his wife and kids. I mean really? Who instructs employees to say shit like this! Moving on, we ordered drinks next. The Notes From Gordon was flavorful and refreshing, although the note was not hand-written nor personal; and felt like it had come off of the printing press. The Innis and Gunn beer was delicious as well. We began to place our dinner order, all of us initially decided to get the pre-fixe; that is until the waitress mentioned that the Beef Wellington is served medium-rare. Two of us stated that we preferred medium instead, at which time she stated that it simply was not possible. She indicated that the chef would not even consider such a request. So now we had to stop the ordering process; to re-review what two of us would now be ordering. I decided on the Short Rib, and the my partner switched to a Filet Mignon medium-well. The other party at our table ordered the Wellington, Caesar Salad, Lobster Risotto. We also ordered mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes. Caesar salad and Lobster Risotto came out right away. The Caesar was underwhelming at best; but I did enjoy the touch of vinegar in the dressing. The risotto was a tiny portion (think one small scoop of porridge); Lobster was fresh and delicious, and risotto flavorful but sadly luke-warm. After eating the appetizers, it then took 55 minutes until dinner arrived. By this point we were thinking, how the heck is this place going to survive turning tables after 3 hours from start to finish? Dinner arrives finally at which point my friends Filet Mignon came out medium-rare (what a rude snub); to initially suggest that while the Wellington temperature could not be changed, and to then indicate that steaks could be ordered any way. Also, before anyone even began to eat, we were still waiting on one of our parties entrees; in addition to the Filet having to be sent back. So now two of us began to eat, while Filet Mignon was sent back. My shortrib entree was luke-warm, stringy, overcooked and had absolutely no depth of flavor. In fact, everyone had a bite and said it was really missing flavor at all. It kind of tasted like stringy brisket lol...YUCK! The Wellington was the star of the show, as we all had a bite and found it delicious. About 10 mins later the botched Filet Mignon comes out, now a new thinner cut of meat (1/2 the size of the original steak); and low and behold it is also medium rare. We were completely over this amateur hour blunder; and the manager that came to our table nor our waitress gave a crap. They both just rushed off after dropping the steak back at the table, what a joke at this point. The Filet they brought back was basically a big F U from the chef; otherwise it would have been corrected to perfection with a sincere apology. Sticky toffee pudding was excellent, Specaloos cookie butter ice cream not a very good flavor match to the amazing pudding. The cookie beneath the ice cream is not in fact a cookie, but a flavorless Bisquick flatbread. The pudding however was stupendous. Overall we all expected so much more from the experience. We thought that there actually would have been a true Hell's Kitchen on stage experience. The music in the restaurant was very loud, and had no reflection of Hell's Kitchen theming. There needs to be yelling and screaming in the kitchen; even if it is totally an act on the part of the chefs. People want to feel as if they are in a true Hell's Kitchen reinactment! Do NOT come here expecting any such experience, as it simply does not exist at this time. Note to Gordon - Please get your bum into this establishment more often than not! You need to put your personal TV touch into the embodiment of your employees and restaurant. You have a lot of future potential customers to woo and to wow. Why not let them leave Hell's Kitchen feeling like they just got off the TV set themselves. After all I assume that you desire a long term success, and future expansion from such. Gordon, please put yourself in your customers shoes, and let their experiences in this establishment; leave their jaws on the floor from the excitement and the flavors of the kitchen.",rGjpP9NYkBiEHGB9oJJafw,1,0,2,E2xuZMjc5lPTduguYKX9mQ

3775844,2018-03-30,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,Got a reservation for 345pm. The decor is so much like the show.  It is very loud in there.  There is the main dining area where you can see the red and blue kitchen cooking. Hells kitchen winner Michelle was working nice to see her if you are a fan of the show.  I was seated on the tables that were by the windows not in the main dining area. Beautiful view. My server was Omar. I ordered the beef wellington which I was told was cooked med rare.   When it arrived it seemed to be cooked med well. I mentioned this to my server and he told me that it was the lightning. Mind you i was by a floor to ceiling glass window and it was sunny. He agreed to take it back and have another done for me. A couple of minutes later he arrived at my table and told me to follow him. He walked me through the entire main dining area to the front pass to PROVE to me that my food under different lighting looked different. What the hell!!  I was mortified especially bring a solo diner it was totally embarrassing.  The chef at the pass said we will gladly refire another one.  I daid i have no idea why he paraded me up here and it was not worth the embarrassment or worth this lengthy discussion.  I then had to walk all the way back to my table though the main dining area to my table completely embarrassed.  Another server brought out my dinner and apologized profusely.  Wellington was delicious!! My waiter Omar then came to see if I would like desert. It was very noisy and he started to explain the desserts. He mentioned the sticky toffee pudding and then said something else which I could not hear over the loud noise. I agreed to which i thought was sticky toffee pudding.  Another server brought my dessert and it was something totally different. I mentioned to her that I thought it was sticky toffee pudding and she said I will gladly change it right away.  While she was gone to get my dessert the waiter Omar came to my table and decided it was a good idea to belittle me by reciting our dessert conversation back to me 3 times. I said it's not worth arguing over and it must have been a miscommunication. He left my table another server brought my sticky toffee pudding and apologized to me and it wasnt even her fault. Dessert was so delicious!!  When I was finished he walked up to my table dropped the bill and never said a word to me. I have been to all of Gordon Ramseys vegas restaurants and loved every minute of them. This one the food was wonderful but the waiter was HORRENDOUS!!! I have never complained about a restaurant in my 50+ years but by the same token I have never been belittled by a wait person ever. My bill for one was almost 90$ and i dhould have been treated with respect. If it were not for the outstanding food I would have gave it a 0.,Y_77sgxg6R51t0UQqO98wA,0,0,2,MtLLbKukwSYlJecfgpXgGQ

My husband went with the pre-fix Hell's Kitchen menu that included Pan Seared Scallops, Beef Wellington and the Toffee Pudding for dessert. 
I chose the Lobster Risotto, NY Strip Steak and the Mac 'N' Cheese.
We first had the Scallops, they were delicious but a little cold, not hot out of the pan like you'd think from watching the show. 
Next we had the Lobster Risotto, I was most excited to try this because I see it all the time on the show and I love lobster and risotto. This was a little disappointing, the was all mush with no texture, very much like eating baby food and it was $24!
The mac n cheese was heavenly!
Beef Wellington was so good and just how I expected it to be. 
The NY Strip was melt in your mouth good and the best thing I had! These dishes will never be the same again!
I didn't give this a 5 stars because we requested to sit in the kitchen area but were told they didnt have any tables available. Our reservation was at 10:45PM and when we were seated there were numerous open tables that were never filled... BOOO.",aQYygrgQ4SOZzB8tmF6I1A,0,0,4,YMvu2MOCWx-dCC9I9NT65g

They even brought in the Hell's Kitchen sign from LA.  Our waiter Robin was very informative.   They where taught about the show and talked on how the restaurant was ran.   Well the food on the other hand was not one of Gordon better restaurant.   Ordered a New York steak med rare to rare and came out almost med.   had a touch of pink.  We informed our waiter and he offered to replace it but we didn't really want to waste a steak. It was still ok.  I wish I would of went with the filet tho.  Risotto was real good .  We loved the Hell's Kitchen experience and glad we did it but I recommend Gordon Ramsey steak house at the Paris.  Hell's Kitchen is a tourist restaurant and enjoyed our experience but probably be a one time thing for us.

3779267,2018-03-13,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Where do I begin....I love Gordon Ramsey...I love watching Hell's Kitchen. I was so excited when I saw that Gordon opened this place up. It was the main thing I looked forward to on this trip. I made my reservations on open table 2 to 3 weeks before our arrival. We were a party of 4. Seating was on time so a good start right? ...no not so much. We were seated in a back area of the restaurant..couldnt see the kichen..red blue teams...the music was loud..customer talking louder so everyone could hear the other..We were put at a round table for 6 people or may be 8 ...this is where things instantly take a very bad turn for me. I say to the hostess that they are wasting a 6 to 8 top when we only need a 4 top..she was saying we would have more room. Okay no problem. We sit and then realize that this table is very wobbly and actually the top turns some... like the table is just thrown together at a park outing. Like maybe it was just thrown in there for additional seating. If you put your arms on the table it rocked.  I showed the bus boy who was the waitresses assistant. He said he would mention it to someone. Our server was Brittany..a very pleasant upbeat young lady. When she came to take our drink order I showed Brittany..she said she would see if it could be fixed. None came to fix it. When Brittany took our food order I was still upset  about the whole table issue. I explained to her that we are not difficult people but this experience started off very badly and I am very disappointed...as I was about to spend 300.00 to 500.00 on dinner for 4...a dinner I added I had looked forward to for several weeks. I explained I felt like I was at a table that was just thrown in for extra seating.  To be fair she did then offer to move us to a four top but the damage was done.  She did say she mentioned the table issue to her manager...who never came over. Dinner was good we has Lobster risotto, which really had no ghee  butter flavor at all, the risotto was very good though. 2 of us had  Beef Wellington,no real seasoning..had Vetter at the Paris Eiffel tower, my husband had the beef short ribs, he felt they were dried out and slightly burnt...he said if Gordon was here they would never had made it out of the kitchen. Our family friend is a vegetarian and it was mentioned upon ordering. She ordered the lobster risotto with no lobster..and the quinoa salad at the server suggestion. We shared desserts. When I got the bill I saw I was charged for 4 lobster risotto...ok?? Charged the same for a risotto that had no lobster..? Seriously??? I asked the server about it so she took it to her manager..who again didn't even bother to come over. He took the risotto off the bill and then made a gesture of good will and comped our dessert and coffee. I didn't want that...it was far too late to fix this whole dining experience. It was a total bomb for me. I WOULD NEVER GO BACK. Dinner for 4 was 320.00 including tip.  I expected so much more from this place. I have dined at the Paris Eiffel tower and had a wonderful dinner and an epic experience...tasteful with quality service from beginning to end. Dining is an experience people...start by turning the music down slightly...this is not a night club. Get a manager that gives a damn about the customers. Fix the freaking table or don't seat it. Maybe there are some things that need to be worked out over time, but there shouldn't be unhappy casualties in the mean time..Not sure why I even gave 2 stars...save your money people..go somewhere that your dining experience will be a happy memory and you will be treated like you actually matter. I'm still so upset and disappointed and it is the day after my experience. I still took care of Brittany after all it wasn't her fault..she should not suffer for bad management with horrible customer service issues. A manager that thinks if they take some money off the bill it will change your whole experience. Listen I didn't need money taken off..money is not an issue. I needed my dining experience to be top of the line..I needed it to be an experience Gordon Ramsey himself would expect..",V6vjkjzjw9dLDxnkkRIuiA,0,0,2,XCh3pHQzP6ug3m6n9bmR5A

The Beef Wellington was everything I dreamed and only needed a butter knife to cut.  The scallops and sticky toffee pudding were delicious and service was amazing!  The only negative was they were out of the amuse bouche at 5:15 in the evening?!  After waiting so long and coming from so far, I felt cheated watching others get the entire experience.

I'm honestly surprised it took 17 seasons of the show to finally open a restaurant of the same name.  This is still soft opening so hopefully they'll get the kinks worked out.  Went in on Tuesday 1/16 and no tables available so I sat at the bar.  Erin was my bartender and she is fantastic, recommended a drink called Smoke on the Blvd and it was great with a really cool presentation.  She and the drinks ultimately made this 4 stars.

This is where things started to go awry.  I ordered the scallops for an app and was really disappointed For $22, it's 5 halves, so basically 2.5 scallops...wow.  They tasted great and I knew I'd be paying a decent amount for dinner but it just seemed tacky and kind of like something a chain restaurant would do to cut corners.  

For the entree, I ordered the filet medium and a side of Brussels sprouts.  The filet came out way over cooked and even the bartender noticed that pretty quick and kindly sent it back for me.  They replaced it quickly but honestly, it was just ok.  I've had other filets that have been more flavorful and prepared better.  Sprouts were good, wish the peppers on top would have had a little spice.

The best part of the meal was dessert.  Definitely recommend the sticky pudding, he's famous for it and it was absolutely delicious!",sCRu_TSEXuxhJSL1tfKHIA,1,1,4,TNIi27HTKN8oZQkj9oXexA

The highlight was the seared fois gras over spiced carrot cake and candied pecans. Enjoyed the unusual and delicious speculoos ice cream with sticky toffee pudding, lobster risotto and individual elements like potato puree. Mistimed service saw many plates being delivered at once so they couldn't all be eaten while fresh and hot, in one case a sauce had seized into unscrapable hardness. Servers took a long time to bring water and kept trying to remove plates before they were tasted.

The seafood tower is so fresh and amazing! The vinaigrette sauce that came with it made it even better. This is def one of my top and most fresh seafood towers I've had, it could be because they just opened so hopefully they maintain the quality. 

The lobster risotto and the scallops are SO good! The potion size is tiny but its so worth it. Can't get over how fresh and good the lobster is. The apple and bacon bits that goes with scallop makes it perfect!

We were seated shortly and given our menus. The menu is fairly small but a decent amount of choices to choose from. We all ordered our own so my boyfriend and I decided to share a few entrees and an appetizer.

We opted for:

New York strip steak, medium rare - good but definitely not as good as the beef Wellington (we tried a piece from our group)

Lobster risotto - definitely order! This was probably my favorite dish - make sure you eat it when it comes out while it's still warm

Wagyu meatball - very underwhelming. I wasn't impressed with this dish and probably wouldn't order it again

For dessert, they gave us the bread pudding - yummy and extremely sweet so if you don't have too much of a sweet tooth, I wouldn't dip the syrup at the bottom of the bowl!

Well, my wonderful boyfriend made lunch reservations for us for today and helped me realize one of my #goals. 

And, yes, reservations are the way to go here. We would have dined for dinner if we could, but they are fully booked for days. Reserve a table as far in advance as possible!

The exterior and interior are true to the show, and I love it. From the HK sign on the outside to the pictures of past show winners on the walls, you really feel like you're visiting the actual set. The chefs are even split up into two groups in the open kitchen, dressed in either blue or red to resemble competing teams. If you want some branded show apparel, there are a dozen options by the front doors. 

The menu has several signature ""Hell's Kitchen"" items, such as the beef wellington and lobster risotto. There's a good amount of other options, like avocado toast and oysters on the half shell. There's a fixed lunch set for $60, too -- soup or salad, beef wellington, and  the classic sticky toffee pudding. 

We went with the lobster risotto as an appetizer, split the Hell's Kitchen Burger and fries, and finished with the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Everything was easily 5 out of 5 stars. The risotto was small, but oh so flavorful. The lobster was tender and tasted fresh. The burger was huge and the fries were well-seasoned. The sticky toffee pudding, interestingly enough, doesn't use any chocolate. Nope -- it uses dates(!). I didn't think I'd like it... but I did. I loved it.

3876000,2018-03-15,7,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I used to love watching Hell's Kitchen for Chef Ramsay's potty-mouth antics. It was amazing to see the former space of Serendipity transformed into the reimagined Hell's Kitchen. I loved that they kept with the theme of an open kitchen with a blue and red team. The dining space is huge and it's really nice for lunch service with the large windows illuminating the natural lighting from the Strip. Since it just opened a little over a month ago, reservations are harder to snag, but my friend managed to get one for Sunday lunch service.

Walking in, there were several menu items that I have been dying to try. The first was the lobster risotto. How many times have I watched Ramsay scream about the risotto? Countless. This time, he would have been proud. The lobster risotto was my favorite dish of the day. The butternut squash was so creamy. You got an entire lobster tail, cut up into individual bite-sized pieces. It was sweet, savory, and everything in-between; a must-try for any guest. Another favorite was the wagyu meatballs, which had a very beefy flavor. 

I ended up getting the three-course express lunch menu, which featured a choice of caesar's salad or pumpkin soup, the beef Wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding. I chose the pumpkin soup, which was beautifully plated and served and poured table-side. I enjoyed the crunchy toasted pepitas. As for chef's signature dish, the beef Wellington did not disappointed. I was amazed by how well-cooked and tender the filet was. The mustard, prosciutto, and duxelles was masterfully incorporated. 

For dessert, the sticky toffee was another amazing dish. Served with speculoos ice cream, it was so soft, buttery, and left you wanting more.

Now for the bad and the ugly:
Since we went for lunch, the all day breakfast part of the menu featured eggs in purgatory. I don't know if it was some kind of sick joke, but the eggs were one of the worst dishes I've had of any breakfast menu ever. I guess those are the eggs they serve in hell. The spicy tomato sauce was so salty, it made the eggs and everything else inedible. If chef was there, he would've probably thrown the eggs across the kitchen followed with ""Who made these eggs?!?"" Yea, that bad. 

The experience was fun, the servers were great, but the actual speed of the service was quite slow. There were highlights and lowlights, much of what was to be expected from a restaurant opened by a celebrity chef in Las Vegas.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,15,9,4,7yo_1Lm0TJeF-fA8TN_W5A

3897129,2018-03-07,4,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I can see why it's getting rave reviews in their 1st two months of being open. The food is fantastic. In fact, they already raised the prix fix dinner $3 to $72. However, the service, while friendly, is off timing-wise. We had to wait 20 minutes for water and a glass of sparkling wine. They did apologize and it was a Saturday night, but it's apparent they are a tad short staffed.

Fortunately we had a reservation and I think that got us a table in a quieter section of the restaurant because it's definitely loud with music pounding. This is not the place to go for a romantic dinner in Vegas...more of a party atmosphere to go with friends. 

I did the prix fix three courses and chose the scallops with the beef wellington. I had tried the wellington at Gordon's restaurant in Paris and it had disappointed. I wanted to give it another chance based on the rave reviews. I must say, this filet was superior. It was a large portion expertly prepared and melted in your mouth. I have decided that I don't really need my beef wrapped in pastry. It's just added calories and probably just isn't my thing. I ordered it though for the mushrooms which I do love. 

Executive Chef Michelle Tribble was the winner of HK and we dined during her 2nd official shift according to our server. Her win seems well deserved. For appetizers we tried the famous scallops and they were delicious. The caesar salad was just how I like it prepared...anchovies, lemon and parmesan in a light mayo style dressing. 

But the absolute star of the show were the lamb chops in a light curry sauce. I am not generally a lamb fan but I wanted to grab my husband's chops and gnaw them to the bone!!! Sticky toffee pudding was also fabulous. I definitely would return to try their lunch menu and check out the ambience by day.",ae7zi8F0B6l_JCITh1mXDg,9,6,4,1_hkGNU8Mt4x0U7j1pfS6Q

The rum donkey is a must and it Comes on fire. Tried the sticky toffee pudding dessert and it Comes with some ice cream. I would say it's a little too sweet for me but it's good.

Carlos our server was the MOST caring and professional server you could ask for on the strip. He was more concerned about our experience rather than just put food on the table. 

Now to the experience. We strongly recommend the Beef Welllington experience with the paired wine. While it is a cost conscious choice it truly was an experience all the way to the overwhelming finish of desert. Each wine paired so magnificently with its dish. The Beef Wellington is all the hype lives up for.

If you make it to desert the port paired with the carmelized bread pudding puts you over the top and I ask isn't that why you came to Vegas, then Hell's Kitchen? 


Hands down best experience we have had in our life and while the food was exquisite, that can be ruined by the service which was definitely willing to go above and beyond the call of duty.

We had a 9:15pm reservation and were seated within a few minutes of our reservation time. The hostesses were very friendly. Our waiter, Derek, was great. Very attentive and funny. His assistant (I didn't get his name but shout out to Derek's assistant on Saturday 2/10/18!) was very good as well, very prompt in refilling our waters and taking away plates we were finished with. The food came out promptly and evenly spaced between courses. One slight negative, our drinks took a bit, but as it was a very busy Saturday night and the bar was packed, this could be forgiven. On to the specifics on the food! 

Appetizers - My girlfriend had the Caesar Salad. It was okay overall, the dressing wasn't as strong as a Caesar typically is but the lettuce was very crisp and fresh, the croutons were good and the pieces of fried cheese were a nice touch. I had the pan seared scallops and they were very good. Cooked very well and very flavorful. Would definitely recommend. 

Main course - My girlfriend had the Braised Short rib. It was delicious. It was so perfectly cooked and the meat was melt in your mouth good. Outstanding. I had the Beef Wellington and oh my, I can see why this is Gordon's famous dish. It was perfect. Beef was perfectly mid rare. The pastry shell was perfectly cooked. The mushroom pate was even good and I typically don't like mushrooms. We also had the Mac and Cheese side and it was so delicious! If you like Mac and Cheese you will not regret ordering it. 

Dessert - We shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Amazing! Best part of the meal for sure. It was so delicious and the Speculoos ice cream on top was an excellent twist on this famous British dessert. 

Overall we had an outstanding time at Gordon's newest restaurant and would definitely recommend for not only people who are fans of Gordon but for anyone who wants an outstanding meal. We also got out for under $200 which is pretty outstanding for dinner and drinks at a nicer restaurant in Vegas!",awUqba7rvhUETOGam7646Q,0,0,5,Iza1CWxA4wN7c0cNpS4tWA

After years of watching the show I had to try the lobster risotto which was amazing due to its creamy texture without the heaviness as other creams and sauces.  The risotto was cooked to perfection with a tenderness but not over cooked or mushy, while the lobster was a good portion and the flavors not overwhelming.  
I also had the beef Wellington which I was shocked to have one of the most tender filet mignon I've ever had while still wrapped in the pastry.  The flavors blended well together and was cooked a perfect medium rare.

I asked for bread and the server took a while to go to the kitchen and then return to tell me they don't have any available.

I asked why and he said it was a hard steak to cook right.  Even more shocked he said that, this coming from a so called prestigious restaurant.  As I mentioned earlier I cook them amazing myself.

So I settled for the next best thing a so called 30 day dry aged ribeye for 2 to split with my wife. 

As time went on still never got water, eventually came, then they left without asking if we want beer or cocktails. I flagged a bus boy walking by to order us drinks which came late later.  Everyone was very nice though, I believe understaffed and lack of attention to detail.

We all got lots of appetizers to share was all good but very unflaver full, looked nice but didn't match the looks.

Ok no big deal I'm here for the dry aged steak but settled for the other cut (because they can't cook a porterhouse) as the waiter said.

The steak finally came I ordered it rare as you should with any good steak.  The presentation was great I was excited.  The moment of truth took a bite and was very plane no flaverfull taste or nice marbling as you would get with any 30 day DRY AGED steak.

Shocked I asked the waiter are you sure this is dry aged?  He said yes.  I don't know what they consider dry aged, I think it was 30 days WET AGED.  As had no flavor black angus has a better tasting steak being it's not dry aged and a 5th the price.

I asked for him to bring salt and pepper.  He said only they can add pepper for me said fine.  Then he gave me a minute bowl of salt to add.  Was eatable after that.

Then the size was not for 2 people but 1.  The weight of the long bone was most of it.  Even with sides and I am a small person.  

Then he came by and said the salt is strong as to not add much like I never ate a steak in my life he did so politely being French.

We got the desert and that was the only item that stood out as worth it at a classy restaurant and I hate sweets.

Overall it is a scam just to charge for the name if the food matched it by all means, if I had the capitol I would smoke him at steaks being as they canceled the best steak on earth due to lack of skill.

Go for the photos and desert only. My opinion.",5wsc9QzzGK33CkiqhhojhA,2,0,2,MYp8MSC5IaXxnmqUtsplUQ
4106768,2018-06-05,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Overall the experience was kind of a letdown.

I'm a big fan of the show, and I realized in my visit that the thing I like about the show (the high standards and the yelling) made me have higher than reasonable expectations.

I went with the Prix Fixe menu, and my girlfriend got the lamb. We also had wagyu meatballs, Mac and cheese and the peanut butter cheesecake.

Scallops - a standard item on the show and featured on the Prix Fixe menu. The bottoms of mine were not seared at all, the tops had a nice crust, and because of the thikness difference, some we're overcooked. They were OK overall, but I have most definitely had better scallops.

Wagyu Meatballs - these were honestly the best thing we ordered. They are delicy and I'd eat them again, no problem. Some house bread to eat the sauce with would have made for a better meal than the lamb.

Lamb - We ordered the lamb medium well (my girlfriend does not like rare meats) it came very rare - more rare than even I like generally. The text was not great as the fat wasn't rendered and by the time it got to us it wasnt hot so it was mostly unpleasant to eat. 1 of the chops was cooked more, and it tasted ok, but again, nothing really to write home about.

Beef Wellington - Another show feature. The cook on this was better, and it was tender. The puff pastry wasn't very puffy and was soggy in some places, but overall it did taste good.

Mac and Cheese - SUPER rich. It tastes delicious but I couldn't eat more than two bites without being overwhelmed by it, so I just packed it up to take home.

Toffee Pudding - this was pretty good. The outer portions of the cake that got carmelized in the oven taste fantastic, the center was a bit dense, but overall a very good dessert.

Peanut butter cheesecake - nothing to write home about. It wasn't BAD, but tasted like just about any other cheesecake on the world. 

Service was also a bit slow. We had a late reservation, and time to get drink or app orders was slow, then something got messed up in the kitchen so time between apps and entrees was VERY long. Our server was nice, and we got one dessert for free as an apology for the errors.

Overall, the food was OK, and it was a neat experience, but I'm unlikely to go back as the food quality is just a bit below what is required for the price.",_LF2eG3ZHQeKH8KKmguRHA,1,1,3,PfxkIfFCHZvyDvw0jBrsSA

The waiting area is at the entrance which is also a very oddly positioned gift shop.

I was quite impressed with the food, the quality and the flavours. The staff were top notch and they were very responsive. The presentation of food was lovely and entertaining. I liked the area I was seated in as it was next to a drape which made it more intimate.

4127398,2018-04-27,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Food was a solid 4. On the table was: a couple of beef Wellingtons, a few orders of scallops, salmons, short rib, lamb rack, a filet, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, a lobster risotto, and tuna tartare. 

I ordered the tuna tartare as an app, salmon as an entree with Brussel sprouts as my side. I didn't enjoy the tuna tartare at all. It made it really spicy. And I didn't like his ""Asian"" twist on it. I'm sure it was a sweet chili sauce. It just didn't go well with ahi tuna. So then, the salmon. It was really really good! The crispy skin made the dish exceptionally good as well as the lemon beurre bland. The Brussels sprouts were also a favorite. It was seasoned really well! And the mushrooms were really good and plentiful, I had a few spoonful of my cousins and she still had a lot to share with the group. The Wellington was a little bland. But I've never had a beef Wellington before so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like. The lamb rack was amazing. Seasoned well, cooked to perfection. I'm not a fan of short rib, but the person who ordered it had nothing but good things to say. And the sticky toffee pudding was really good! I was only able to get a few bites in as it was really sweet. 

SO the reason for the 3 stars was the service! It was a 2-3 stars in service. I get it, were a group of 9 who weren't all going to spend 100s of dollars for the table because none of us really wanted to drink and only half of us got appetizers, BUT that's still not an excuse to be rude. Two of the members of the party had prior obligations and so they were only going to order sides because they had already eaten, but still wanted to celebrate with us... and the server told them, if they weren't going to order entrees, that's why they have a bar. As a server, part of your job is hospitality and that is no way to treat someone who is going to give you money at the end of the day. There definitely could've been a better way to relay that information.  And so that couple ended up ordering a steak and scallops, but he doubled up their scallops to equate to an entree??? Okay.

Then two of the members left early but I still had their money for the bill, so I asked if we can split the bill, which 4 ways max, very reasonable. But I asked for a bill for the two who left early so I can give the guy an itemized receipt with whatever left over money he had, to which he rudely asked we'll where are they? Uhhhm. Okay.

Their reservation system is also pretty whack. You check in for a table, then stand in a line for another thirty minutes. I don't understand the point of time slots for reservations if they're going to sit us 20-30 minutes late. 

All in all, I wouldn't come back nor recommend. I was just very turned off by the servers demeanor towards the party. Which we don't make reservations months in advance to celebrate a birthday just to be treated badly.",IzKc0jBJnmEbmOA9F5VyDA,4,1,3,6aIpPA9gCzJ3UYzLs1spmw

I had a cocktail Jade recommended ""A Note From Gordon"" and it did not disappoint even thought I'm not a huge drinker. We started with the Wagyu Meatballs and I can't say enough good things about them! Meatballs were tender, sauce was delicious and I loved the little cheese things (i forgot what they were called) they put me in the mind of cheese filled polenta! I ordered the 3-course meal. It came with your choice of a Caesar salad or asparagus soup. I chose the salad and it was delicious. I do like my salads with a little more dressing, but that's just my preference. It was really fresh and the toasted parmesan was delicious . Next I had the Beef Wellington, it was absolutely delicious! All the ingredients went so well together. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection. I finished it off with The Sticky Toffee pudding and we also ordered a Pinapple Carpaccio for the table that had such a  cool presentation! However, flavor wise I definitely recommend the Sticky Toffee Pudding hands down! My Mom ordered the Short Rib grilled cheese and was in Heaven and our friend ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger.

I started off with the smoke on the boulevard drink which comes with a presentation you have to see,
Moving on to the appetizers which was a dozen oysters and the Waygu meatballs were unbelievable!
We also got the baked macaroni and cheese with Gouda  
We ordered the rack of lamb, also flawless cuts like butter with the butter knife, the sweet potato hash on the bottom will leave you wanting more and the lamb sauce is a bit thick sweet and savory hard to describe but like a béarnaise gravy sauce
then moving onto the fixe course menu the scallops were amazing and way better than I could've ever imagined with the cold sweet apple celery ham hash in the middle the scallops it's literally a must try and the Beef Wellington is out of this world it's like an amazing roast encrusted in the most perfect texture of bread, crunchy yet soft but not soggy literally have nothing  bad to say about this place  it's a must try!",-4lKXA8s0idXAII5v0mVOA,0,0,5,7Mj_PMt0k3ZqHkQ-aT5A9Q

Service was friendly, professional. We were seated immediately. The interior is big, spacious, decorated attractively. The winner of one of the latest seasons was there as the head chef, so many people were taking photos with her (including me). Table setting was attractive, nice flatware and napkins.

We had the beef wellington, salmon, scallops (get these, they're delicious), cauliflower side (delicious) mac and cheese (also quite good, and the sticky toffee pudding (amazing). Everything tasted wonderful and was obviously presented beautifully. As someone who cooks salmon weekly, I was not too impressed with the salmon dish as far as taste, but it was prepared nicely with the crispy skin on top. It just lacked flavor to me. I had it with the cauliflower, which was a good combination though as far as taste.

We arrived at 8:45 PM and was seated closer to 9PM. I understand they're busy. You can literally see the chefs working and hustling behind the counter from your table.

We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, it was AMAZING. The type of burger that was juicy and flavorful but not so juicy that the bun falls apart and you feel like you need a drop cloth to keep from getting it all over you. We are from a rather snobby town when it comes to burgers in the Midwest (I think travel magazine gave us the best burgers in the US last year) but I can honestly say this is a contender for the best I've ever had.

4200203,2018-04-13,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"WOW is exactly my response to my experience at Hell's Kitchen.  I felt a bit of a poser going in because the restaurant is obviously influenced by the TV show, which I've never watched in my life.  I obviously know who Gordon Ramsey is and have watched some of his cooking videos, but I wasn't the huge fan of the show that a lot of people in the restaurant were.  When you walk in, you're greeted by a large HK sculpture with the appropriate flames emblazoning the sign, a virtual life-size Gordon Ramsey speaking to you, and a wall of all the Hell's Kitchen past winners.  I guess the prize for the most recent show was not only a cash prize, but also a 1 year contract as head chef at Hell's Kitchen.  There were so many people taking pictures with the kitchen (a replica of the TV show I assume) and the head chef, Michelle.  The restaurant is appropriately hell-themed, with pitchfork designs and flames everywhere you turn.

My sister and I ordered the 3 course lunch meal which includes an appetizer, meal, and dessert all for $60!  We started with the pumpkin soup, Caesar's salad, and lobster risotto.  The pumpkin soup was unique, in that the waitress brought out an empty bowl with the chorizo, pumpkin seeds, and other additions present on the bottom, and poured the soup into the bowl after she placed it in front of me.  The chorizo bits were small but SO juicy and flavorful.  The lobster risotto was actually my least favorite dish.  Maybe I don't love seafood enough to appreciate lobster, but I felt that the rice in the risotto was a bit undercooked.

For the main meals, my sister and I got the beef wellington, my mom got the short rib grilled cheese, and my dad got the crispy skin salmon.  The beef wellington completely met my expectations!  It's a very aesthetic dish, but also very difficult to cut.  If you don't know, beef wellington is a cut of filet mignon wrapped with prosciutto, mushrooms, and a puff pastry.  The beef was SO tender and all it's layers paired nicely with the vinegarette/ wine reduction and mashed potatoes.  The crispy skin salmon was also a great option with the salmon being so perfectly tender and balanced with a nice crunch from the skin.  The short rib grilled cheese was pretty greasy and not a favorite due to the horseradish that was inside.

As for dessert, my sister and I got the sticky toffee pudding, which was my absolute FAVORITE part of the meal.  It was a sweet toffee drizzled moist, warm bread topped with cookie butter ice cream.  I thought I was pretty hungry after my fine dining experience, but the dessert put me at just the right amount of full.  The waiter highly recommended the Pineapple Carpaccio so our parents ordered that.  It's really attractive because of the show that is presented with the dessert.  The thinly sliced pineapple with passionfruit foam is placed on a glass plate that surrounds dry ice.  The waiter brings out the dish and pours in liquid nitrogen into the dry ice so that you get a smoky show right at your table.  The dessert was pretty simple, but the pineapple with the sour passionfruit foam paired really nicely.

I recommend Hell's Kitchen for a nice meal in Vegas.  Since it opened recently, it's pretty difficult to book reservations, so make sure to book in advance!",ESF-d6-9wYCjKInxsJpy1w,2,2,5,Pn5BtBQvrOvZWHwlr28G0w

We got there earlier than our reservation time but it wasn't an issue. They were able to get us seated next to the window overlooking the strip (best seat in the house)! The lobster risotto was recommended by our server so we decided to get that as an appetizer. We also ordered the asparagus soup and it came with a Parmesan crisp which really accentuated the flavors. I got the combo with the beef Wellington and my brother got a burger. The appetizer and the soup arrived in a timely manner but after the soup we waited..and waited and waited some more to the point that people that arrived and got seated after us already paid and left. If it wasn't for the time stamp on my Snapchat photos, nobody would've believed that we waited 30 minutes between our soups and entrees. It was disappointing considering everything started out so great. It also didn't help that our server didn't update us with what was happening. He just did a quick driveby the table to ask us how we were doing without actually hearing our responses. When our entrees arrived, the beef Wellington was actually really good. Unfortunately, my brothers burger and fries was already cold and it was no longer appetizing. We're understanding people so I wished there was better communication between the kitchen, server and us. We were left out in the dark and not really sure as to what was happening. The manager apologized and ended up comping the burger but as a visitor, it's not like we were really able to warm it up somewhere to enjoy it so the meal went to waste.

Unfortunately it was a disappointing experience and I've had better service at no name restaurants.",wl_s_374ul42LHJGygk8IA,2,0,2,sDAgvW1ND0IfKkVpGW9V6g
4241870,2018-04-13,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Great food and service, although sort of odd ambiance.  

I feel a bit guilty because I'd never even heard of the TV show and only really know of Gordon Ramsey as ""one of the English celebrity chefs, a bit abrasive but also a solid chef"".  However, I saw great reviews of this place and I'm staying at Caesars so I got a reservation via OpenTable.  It is still pretty full all the time, so I'd definitely recommend reservations -- a lot easier during the day than for dinner.

Seated immediately based on my reservation time.  Menu explained by my waitress, and I ordered immediately -- the prix fixe lunch deal for $60, plus an extra signature appetizer (lobster risotto), espresso, and sparkling water.  Total came out to $4.50 ($104.50 minus my annual $100 annual Caesars Total Rewards Diamond dinner voucher), and because I'm not an animal, I tipped based on the full amount (which surprised the waitress, which makes me fear for humanity).  So, not an inexpensive place, but great food.

Lobster risotto ($24) was possibly my favorite dish.  Perfect risotto, butternut squash, and maybe 4oz of perfectly prepared lobster on top.  Apparently this is a signature dish which is always on the TV show -- I can see why, because it is technically challenging to prepare.

Pumpkin soup -- great soup, with some pepper oil and various ""bits"" in the bowl, with the soup poured over tableside.

Beef Wellington: surprisingly good. Also, I think this is $49 on the menu solo, or $60 in the prix fixe, so I would always order in the set.  I'd only ever had badly executed Beef Wellington on cruise ships and event food; this was an entirely different dish.

Sticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream -- decent, but not my favorite style of dessert, with too much focus on sweetness and not much complexity.  But, this does seem to be popular, and was good.

Overall, a good restaurant, although definitely on the pricier end, and hard to get a table, in a town full of great restaurants (including a bunch by Gordon Ramsay himself). The dining room is large and open and thus a bit loud, and while there is a somewhat open kitchen, it seems like they dialed back the ""two competitive teams preparing custom menus"" to ""popular dishes from the show"".  I'd  recommend trying the place if you have a chance.",pEvhyxL7YAGrYsKB29VJvg,2,1,5,RhVtZFzGqrBXEQvWTyavHQ
4249253,2018-02-27,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My husband and I were so excited to get reservations to this restaurant while we were in town. We were able to get reservation at 4:30pm on February 15th. We arrived 15 minute early and waited in line to be seated. 2 ladies arrived 10 minutes after us who were 30 minute late got seated before us. When we got seated, we were told our server would be with us shortly. No menu, no water or anything was given to us. We waited, waited, and waited but no server. It was 15 minutes before another server came and gave us menus and said our server would be with us shortly... Guess someone was late for their shift that cause us to wait for him. No happy about that!!!

We order basically everything, like we saw on tv and the scallops and lobster risotto were the best. Just wish we got great service...

From the well trained staff to the standards they all follow. 

Started off with a great beer selection and delicious menu to look through. HK has a brew from Stone was very tasty.

Scallops , oysters and lobster risotto!!!! ALL GREAT DISHES TO SHARE!! Very good. Each one was presented out so well.. 

We also shared the Short Rib plate!  Very good sauce and the rib was delicious. Love the polenta and veggies on the bottom!! Dessert was the stick toffee pudding. SOOOO GOOD! 

Definitely lived up to all the expectations and hype of the famous Gordon Ramsey. Decor is very beautiful and so much thought and detail .

I heard Hell's Kitchen was coming to Caesars Palace and why not go check it out? I love the show and I was looking forward to trying the food. When you get there you check in with the hostess and then stand in line against the wall. The line was not too bad to be seated and we got an awesome table near the window where we can see people walking the strip. What really was cool to me is that they have the kitchen open where you can see the blue and red team making entrees. 

The lunch menu looked good! I ordered the three course meal so I can get the beef Wellington since it isn't on the lunch menu to order. I started with the pumpkin soup. Wow! The mix of chorizo on the bottom and the soup they poured on top of it was very good. Be sure to stir it up so you can mix the flavors. We tried the Wagyu meatballs as an appetizer. Wow!!! The meat was very tasty! The meatballs were pretty filling, but glad we tried it! When my beef Wellington came out, all I can think about is Hell's Kitchen Season 4 episode 7 where Ben was just getting the heat from Gordon with his Beef Wellingtons.

The vegetables were cooked perfectly as well. I enjoyed the entire plate. When dessert came out, I was so stuffed. I definitely made room for the sticky toffee pudding. Amazing texture and flavors.

You are walked by the dueling red and blue open kitchens on your way to the table. The hostesses have these fire red dresses and the pitchfork motif is noticeable throughout.  

The food is mostly elevated casual fare from burgers to fuller entrees. Of course I had to try the signature beef Wellington. I opted for the course menu at lunch time. I had the Cesar salad which was typical but good and quite a large portion. The pumpkin soup was very tasty with a bit of unexpected heat. My entree, the Wellington, disappointingly was only a half portion. I suppose all those years of build up in my mind of watching it being made on the show gave me a preconceived notion of how it would taste. The filet was perfectly tender and fork cut-able, nicely medium rare. I think it just didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would and the pastry dough was not as crisp or flaky as I hoped. If more of the sauce/demi glacé was on the plate the dish might have been more enjoyable for me. Lastly the toffee pudding with a speculos ice cream was moist but too sweet for me. I couldn't eat the whole thing, it was a good portion. I think if it had less drizzled syrup or whatever it was that made the cake very moist, it would have been less sweet and perfect. 

Our waiter was very attentive. I thought the overall experience was well timed. Just the food was perhaps overpriced, although with it's location in the Cesar and link to the popular show, perhaps it is justified for many.

4352912,2018-02-13,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I'm going to get grief for having the unpopular opinion, but oh well.

We went here at my daughter's request for her 17th birthday. She is not a HUGE fan of the show, but she likes Gordon Ramsay; she thinks he's funny, so I made reservations not really knowing too much about it.

We initially ordered the prawn flambe appetizer, but our waiter (thankfully) had informed me that there were only 3 prawns, so we changed it to the scallops at my son's request. There were six scallops for $22. I'm not cheap but seriously, to me that's nuts. To us, the scallops were OK. 

There were four of us, my daughter ordered the salmon, my husband ordered the rack of lamb, my son ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the braised short rib. The presentation for all of them was nice. The speed at which we received our orders was efficient. Temperature was great. The food servers in grey got confused with two of our orders. Two of them with two plates in hand, first both approached our table, gave us two orders and the other girl wandered around the restaurant with the other two plates and then ended up back where she started. Don't know what happened there, but no big deal - just thought it was weird.

My son loved his filet mignon - medium rare. I tried it and it was perfect. Perfect size too. I would definitely recommend it. My braised short rib was perfect in terms of portion and the flavors were perfect. The texture was just too mushy for me. My husband's rack of lamb was cooked perfectly, and I thought it went perfectly dipped in the sauce from my short rib ;) My daughter's salmon was perfectly crispy and cooked well, nothing exceptional there though. I would definitely say the preparation, quality and flavoring of the food was wonderful. The value was sufficient as well. Except for the damn appetizer lol. Now that I think about it, maybe if the scallops were presented in a different way, it might have been more appealing to me, just thinking out loud here.

The things I thought were a little odd (and I say this as a Hell's Kitchen ""outsider"") is that there is a kitchen that is supposedly a replica of the kitchen in the show. We got a really good seat right in front of the open kitchen...but, it almost felt like we were waiting for something to happen and nothing happened. It was just a regular functioning kitchen, nothing to see here. So it was kind of weird. Maybe it was just us, but the way it was set up, I almost felt like there was something that was worth watching and there wasn't.

I have to point out our server Miguel was very nice and very helpful with the appetizer recommendations. The girls in red however (the hostesses?), need to be consistently friendly. I watched their interactions with people since we waited quite a long time to be seated, and also I was interested to see if it was just us they were cold towards. They are the types of girls that are only nice to certain people, so good luck with that. I can't tell you WHAT kind lol - just that they were not nice to everyone...not cool!

I almost forgot one more very important oversight (in my opinion) and that is, there is NO SEATING in the lobby...none! Standing room only, not good. We waited about 45 minutes and reading some of these reviews, that wait time seems to be the average.

It was good for my daughter to experience for her birthday and I'm very glad we went - she even got to see Gordon Ramsay himself that day, I thought that was a nice surprise for her :) And of course we had to buy her a $30 tshirt (insert eye roll here lol).

I don't plan on coming back as here in Vegas we are so lucky and spoiled to have so many amazing dining options and this was just ok to me. But I think for a group visiting from out of town, or a celebration of some sort for people that are huge fans of the show, it's probably much cooler of an experience.

One last thing that I felt important to mention. I made this reservation via Open Table and in the special requests section I had asked if they could bring out the sticky toffee pudding at the end of the meal for my daughter's birthday and they did :) Without discussing it in person with anyone, so that was really nice. And even though I'm a strictly chocolate dessert lover (for the most part) that dessert lived up to the hype!",Tr-dCb5zhOEPJ1LGYFTXIw,0,1,2,5mGDG595VKOteo_SgQ0fsg

1 - scallop was delicious and lobster risotto was incredible!
2 - beef Wellington was quite salty.. it had me chugging down water afterwards.. I was a bit disappointed with this main dish.. my boyfriend had the rack of lambs and that was yummy..

scallops (appetizer) - tasty but it seemed like they took one huge scallop and cut it up into 4 slices

Salmon - great overall but the accompaniments were not desirable 

Potatoes purée - really delicious

Filet mignonette - not worth it. The meat was chewy, not cooked to medium but medium rare (I ordered medium), the mustard sauce was not my cup of tea

With reservations it wasn't long before we were seated. Our waitress was over shortly after and went over the menu with us. She was friendly and attentive. She was also enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu. 

The Fear and Loathing cocktail was calling my name. It was a great drink with a smoky liquor and a few fresh juices to balance out the flavor. I'd definitely order this again. For food we started with Scallops and a Caesar Salad. Both were some of the best I've ever had. The scallops were perfectly prepared with a delicious sauce that paired well. The Caesar Salad was a large portion with the best flavor. The cheese on the salad had a bold flavor that really kicked the flavor up a notch without overpowering the other flavors.

For the main course we shared the signature Beef Wellington and the Crispy Skin Salmon. The Beef Wellington lived up to the hype, perfectly tender meat and a delicious pastry on the outside. The potato puree and sauce were amazing as well. The Crispy Skin Salmon was also perfectly prepared. The skin was definitely the highlight, somehow perfectly crispy without being overcooked. The salmon also came with a delicious sauce and side of lentils that I enjoyed. 

It was only fitting that we ended the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. This also lived up to the hype for me. The pudding was so delicate and well flavored. The flavor of the ice cream on top perfectly paired with the pudding. The dessert was a nice serving and was perfect for sharing.

I loved the crispy skin on the salmon which was also lightly seasoned with salt which was just enough! We also started off our lunch with the Waygu meatballs which were tender and packed with nice Italian flavors. 

The star of the show was definitely the sticky toffee pudding, the best way to end a meal! We were blown away by the flavor combination of the toffee pudding and the cookie butter ice cream. The dessert itself wasn't overly sweet and definitely the perfect shareable size!

4519760,2018-03-21,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"As our first time in Las Vegas, I wanted a trip to remember. I was excited to find out that this restaurant recently just opened a couple of months ago. Like I usually do, I scope restaurants through yelp and one by one I check out their menu. Their menu was not extensive and it was not extremely pricy as well. 

Made a reservation on a Thursday night, as I assume it would be a popular spot to go because 1. it's new and 2. because it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We got there half hour early before our reservation. There was a line to check in. When it was our turn, the hostess could not find my reservation. She asked me for my last name and the time I reserved a table. Nothing. She asked me for a confirmation number, I showed her on my phone. Little did I know, I had accidentally reserved a table a week later. I had a mini panic attack in disbelief I made a mistake for like a minute (that felt like forever.) Especially that we have a show to go to right after dinner. Anyway, I asked the hostess politely if there is any way we can still grab a table, she looked through her computer and said she only has a high top. (in my head, ""shoot even if it's the bar area, we'll take it"") I was delighted that we were still able to sit and have dinner.

Our server was nice and I feel like she would have been more attentive if it was not a busy night. All the other food runners and servers that touched our table was also very pleasant. It is such a big deal for us to feel comfortable at a restaurant because we are a lesbian couple. (trust me, you would think people would be more accepting of us now. However the mere act of holding hands while walking down a block captures so many pair of eyes and glances smh. Sorry got sidetracked)
So overall the tone was friendly. The restaurant was slightly dimmed designed with pitchforks hanging from the ceiling. I also really liked the idea of the kitchen. It's as if you're in the actual show. Their staff is more than happy to take a picture for you in front of the kitchen.

My girlfriend and I each got our own cocktails. I must say their cocktails are good and strong. You get what you paid for. They have a short list of house cocktails with funny names. Then they also have the extensive cocktail list and wine list. 

Now the food, the food was not the greatest. It wasn't bad either. We ordered the Prawn scampi that was flambéed on our table. (That was cool but the shrimp was salty) then the girlfriend ordered the Wellington and I had the Filet. Both steaks were perfectly cooked medium rare as we requested. The filet was delicious, the wellington was ok (slightly disappointing as it was one of the highlights). We also ordered mushrooms and brussels sprouts as our sides. The side portions were perfect, not too much not too little. They paired well with our steaks. 

Now when we ordered we informed our server that we have a show to go to right after. Our food was well timed starting from when the first course came. However on my reservation I had put that it's my girlfriend's birthday, also discreetly mentioned it to our server. I was at least expecting a small ice cream or even just a greeting but maybe it was forgotten. It wasn't a big deal. It just would have been nice if a little something was done with the information in hand. Anyway we finished our meal with still an hour to spare before our show. We left happily and full. Would we go back? Sure why not, we would like to try something else on the menu and hopefully I reserve the right date next time.",DTyjEnt1pC7gIVi5Md6wRQ,0,0,4,wiOdSG7kz6zHe4g-00U6mw
4520155,2018-01-21,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"This place is great. It creates a unique atmosphere that feels very much separate from the Vegas strip, and yet it totally fits in with any trip you make to the Vegas strip. 

The waitstaff is attentive and kind. 

Dress code: we had a lunch reservation and 85 to 90% of the people were dressed casually (jeans, tshirts). I would imagine more people dress up for dinner. But, it's on the strip--so people are on vacation and dressed accordingly and I didn't notice the staff being anything other than welcoming to everyone. 

The most important part of any restaurant: the food. It was excellent. Our table ordered Beef Wellington and Eggs in Purgatory. The Beef Wellington looked great, but I didn't try it myself. However, the person who ordered it told me I need to get it next time we go. I had Eggs in Purgatory. It was great, and I would recommend it.  We finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Don't be crazy--if you are at this restaurant order the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Honestly it is so rich, and they give you such a big serving, that two people can split one order of that desert. 

This place books up fast! So if you are coming to Vegas, plan ahead. I think they are booking out as much as two or three months in advance. 

The only negative, and it is so slight, is the check-in process. You have to wait in a long line to let them know you arrived, then you are just sent out anywhere. Literally. There is no where for you that you are not blocking the door or something for sale (this is also due to crowd size). Then as your time draws closer, you go back and wait in another line for them to call you. The staff is patient. But there are so many people that it can be hard to hear and some people walk in and try skipping the line. So that part can be a bit of a wait (plan to arrive 20 minutes before your reservation and you should be seated within 10 minutes of the reservation).",Bg0vuJD7xZE_HhZzzqWGMg,0,0,5,G0hBgGC2SA32leYjXffX2g

We had a reservation for 2:30 PM and they couldn't take any more walk-ins because they had so many reservations. So make sure if you want to try this place, make a reservation!!

The hostess asked if we wanted to sit near the fountain view or the kitchen view. They recommended the kitchen if we were fans of the show. I'm glad they did because they really made the interior look exactly like the set. It was beautiful! You're allowed to take many pictures in front of the kitchen including pictures with one of the winners who is the chef at Hell's Kitchen. 

Our waiter was very polite and nice and even connected with us on a personal level. 

The food was very good. I loved the baked pancake, short rib grilled cheese (that had to be my favorite), lobster risotto (which we had to send back because it had no flavor and tasted like rice in water although the lobster was good), and mushroom pizza. We also had to get the infamous sticky toffee pudding which was SUPER delicious. There isn't too much of an overwhelming nutty/toffee flavor, but more of a soft perfectly balanced blend of sweet and savory. Every bite had me and my friends smiling from ear to ear because the cake was so moist and flavorful. The ice cream was a perfect pairing to the cake. 

Besides the botched lobster risotto, the food was delicious, the experience was fun, and Hell's Kitchen was afforable and just an all around really cool experience.

The restaurant definitely has a lot of things based off of the show, like red and blue, a wall with pictures of the winners, a gift shop area, pictures of Gordon Ramsey, and a blue and red kitchen area. 

While this was during the ""soft opening"" it sure seemed like everyone knew what they were doing and everything was absolutely amazing. 

After we ordered, before our food came, they brought us a complementary little appetizer. It was some sort of little pastry with garlic hummus. It was good if you like that kind of thing! 

I ordered off of the pre fixe menu. For $69 you get either Caesar salad or the scallops, beef Wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding. For the price, I felt like this was a great deal!

The scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly and had excellent flavor. The beef Wellington was perfection, and the sticky toffee pudding was the best dessert I've ever had. It was really cool to try these dishes because they are made on the show so often.

4547524,2018-05-04,3,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I'm going to admit that I've never seen an episode of the show.  The main catalyst for us even being here was because one of our birthday celebrants (our dear friend who definitely IS a fan of the show) really wanted to try this place.  Lucky for her (as well as the rest of us) that this ended up being a fantastic idea.

Upon walking towards the entrance, one might say it is like a futuristic gateway to hell itself.  I bet that was what they were trying to go for.  And that's only the beginning of what we see from the decor.  They have a wall of past winners as well as merchandise for sale.

The place is huge and seems to seat many people.  And yet, it gets filled seemingly to capacity at prime time.  Even later at night, guests continue to be seated when tables are freed up and prepared.

Even with a reservation, we still had to wait for a while, which didn't exactly surprise me since the place is ridiculously popular.

The kitchen is in clear sight and open for all to see.  It is not an actual show, but it is modeled after it.  Blue on one side, red on the other.  Bandanas worn on their respective sides of the kitchen.  They're not competing against each other, but they're preparing everything as fast and as fine in quality, presentation, and taste as possible.

I also had a couple of their featured cocktails.  I originally wanted a Manhattan, but for another $1, I royally upgraded to an even more delicious Manhattan that came out of a smokey glass case.

For food, I went with the 3-course meal featuring the beloved Beef Wellington, which I had never had before.  What a way to be introduced to it for the first time.

Here is a list of all the items we shared and tried:

Pan Seared Scallops with Celery root, braised bacon lardons, and pickled Granny Smith apples. $19
Scampi prawn flambé with Garlic white wine sauce and drawn butter. $24
Beef Wellington with potato puree, glazed root vegetables, and red wine demi-glace. $49
Herb crusted rack of lamb with vadouvan carrots, bloomsdale spinach, and harissa lamb jus. $39
Potato gratin with fresh herbs and parmesan cheese. $9
Sticky toffee pudding
Pineapple carpaccio (which was a special and not on the menu).

Our server was so amazing that I had to give him credit, even over the head chef!

FYI:

- As with many places in the area, get ready to spend, spend, spend.
- If you're going to get a Manhattan anyways, you're better off getting the special one that comes out of a smokey glass box for $1 more.  It's definitely worth the attention from everybody around you.  Plus, it tastes better.
- The imported sparking water probably goes for as much as Voss, and it's totally worth it.  We went back to drinking regular water, and it was a rough transition.

I personally enjoyed coming here for dinner.  It was a nice treat, and it definitely highlighted the great experiences I've had in this area.  Unfortunately, I only speak for myself as I keep seeing comments on other reviews that the food was mediocre or just not good.  I simply don't agree, but hey, the only good those comments might do for you if you are deterred from trying this restaurant is the fact that you'll save some money.  Besides, I don't think they're exactly hurting for business, and any possible criticisms don't seem significant enough to generate pure hatred.  Not a crazy thought considering it is the kitchen FROM HELL.  

When my bank account regenerates one day, I'll probably be back.

Have mercy on all your wretched souls, and hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!",1tenbBbCUONAtbC0k5rdmw,3,4,5,KxoSeXzDTrDDd-UofInsmQ

We had a 6PM reservation on 2/17 and were excited to eat here before our Elton John show. We are huge fans of the show and the proximity to the venue made this the perfect choice. 

Upon arrival we had to wait 40 mins. I even arrived 30 minutes early and was told not to bother waiting and to come back at 6. I'm a Diamond member and typically get speedy service for Total Rewards restaurants but considering this place had only been open for a month I waited patiently. 

When we were finally seated we were sat in some back area with no view of the kitchen. We were put at some huge wobbly table for 8 even though we were a party of 3. It was so awkward with our party so far apart from each other with the wobbly ass table and no view of hella kitchen. I could have order take out and had the same experience. 

Our server then tells us based on the time we were seated and the time we had to go to the concert that we wouldn't have time for appetizers and entrees, basically pick one or the other. We ordered 2 filets, and a New York with some potato's au gratin. They were cooked perfectly but not any better than BLT at Bally's which provides a far superior service and experience for their diners. 

Based on how Gordon says service should be on all his shows we were left very disappointed and thinking that Gordon talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk.

Service: the staff were all friendly. Our waiter really tried to make our experience enjoyable. I did feel like the food took a while to arrive, but that seems to parallel the tardiness of the kitchen in the show. I saw Christina from the show there! Except we couldn't take a picture with her :( 

Food and drinks: they have a large wine list and many cocktails. I had Gordon Ramsay's signature drink with his famous sayings. It was okay, good but tasted like a vodka sprite. 
As for the food, the scallops, steak, salmon and beef Wellington were truly cooked to perfection. It tasted exactly like you would imagine it to taste. But the sides were even better than you would imagine. 

Although I thought this restaurant was a great dining experience, the food is quite expensive. I felt like it was quite pricy for the simplicity of the food.

4617614,2018-02-09,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"While visiting Las Vegas between February 3 to February 7th, 2018 me and a party of 4 total decided to try the bar at recently opened Hell's Kitchen on the strip.  Because it had just opened a few weeks ago this restaurant was on the local news as so far taking in about 100k reservations already and is fully booked for a few months.

I have been a huge fan of the show since day 1 and watched the first 11 seasons religiously.  I was not aware that this place had opened in Las Vegas and only thought it opened recently in Los Angeles.  

We decided to hit the bar and see if we could wiggle into 4 bar stools and dine in at some point.  We got to the bar at around 9pm and had a few drinks to start.  At around 9:30pm we all sat down at the bar next to each other and were able to order dinner. 

For starters i ordered the Smoke on the Blvd cocktail.  This consists of ""Woodford Rye, Aperol, Amoro Averna, sweet Vermouth, smoked with cherry wood""  The drink is made and then placed into a glass smoker which smokes the drink right in front of you.  This drink was perhaps one of the best drinks i have had in quite some time.  

I ordered off of the tasting menu with wine pairing on the menu which went for $120.00.  I was thinking to myself for $120.00, I probably wont be getting that much food and was preparing myself to be leaving the restaurant still hungry.  I was wrong. 

The first course i got was scallops, which were cooked ""spot on.""  The scallops were cut in half and cooked which of course made them a pretty light app, but they hit the spot.  The wine pairing for this course was a 2016 Marsanne Tahbilk, Nagambie Lakes Central Victoria.  It was a perfect match and great start to the meal. 

For dinner the beef wellington was great and cooked perfectly with a small side of mashed potatoes puree and vegetable medley.  It was paired with a 2013 Jordan Cab (one of my top 3 favorite reds) so this meal was an instant winner.  

For dessert the sticky toffee pudding was AMAZING.  But the star of this show was the dessert wine.  A 2011 Castellare, San niccole, vin santo del chianti classico.  It was tremendous.  The service was amazing.  I also tried my friends lobster risotto and it was delicious.  5 stars, and I will definitely be back.  Before leaving I was able to meet Hell's Kitchen season 10 winner Chef Christina Wilson (who is the executive chef at that location)  and was able to get a photo with her and funny enough, we had a great, pretty lengthy talk about NFL football rather than food, as we are both from the East Coast and follow the East Coast teams.  An all around phenomenal experience, especially if you are a fan of the show.  The kitchen is set up like the TV Show complete with the actual chefs of the place dressed like the TV Show contestant. (in red and blue jackets).  I will 100% be back and can't wait for my next visit here.",NUjtjJd5Pex6uODSDOHaKA,1,1,5,pbFdVFN4YZfD-LrSETg56A

4640192,2018-01-16,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Having watched this show since the beginning, it was exciting to see a Hell's Kitchen restaurant was opening when we going to be in Vegas. We had thought it was supposed to open on Tuesday, which we were leaving & thinking we would miss it. We saw it late Saturday night & found it to be open, but closing for the night. Timbaer the bartender told us to come in the morning as they opened at 11. We showed up about 10 minutes early, waited a few & were the first to be seated that morning 
Great table in front of the kitchen, so had a great view of the red & blue chefs preparing meals. 
Omar was our server & was fantastic. Very attentive & knowledgeable of the menu. This helped a lot in making a decision, both food & drink. Joanna kept our water glasses filled  (uniquely holding a napkin to prevent splashing) & our table cleared. 
Oh yeah, the food. We had the scallops & oysters for an appetizer. All I can say is wow. The scallops were over the top & exceeded expectations. Would have been nice to have whole & not halved, but the flavor more than made up for it. The oysters came with a cocktail sauce & a tasty ginger sauce. They both complimented the oysters very well.
For lunch we had the Hell's Kitchen Burger & the Short Rib Grilled Cheese as recommended by one of the bartenders from the night before. 
The burger was juicy & the ghost pepper jack cheese provided a great zing to it. The short ribs were braised to perfection. The cheese was a great compliment to the tender pieces of meat.  It was a toss up to which was better, but it was one of the best burgers I've had. 
Dessert was the sticky toffee pudding as (as recommended by another diner) & the chocolate mousse. The mousse was good, but not real exciting. The sticky toffee pudding was a different story. Simply wonderful!  Moist cake & great ice cream made for a dessert to die for!
Had to try some of the specialty cocktails. One was the Pitchfork, a bourbon-based cocktail cocktail topped with whipped egg whites & the signature HK logo. Second cocktail was the Chef's Stew. A gin-based cocktail with fruit juices & served in small steel pot. The fun part was the piece of dry ice added to make it bubble. It was two-fold; fun & very tasty. 
We were so satisfied we went back about dinner time Monday night, a quick seat at the bar where Timbaer again was great. Omar saw us & remembered us so we told him again we appreciated his wonderful service. 
For our light dinner, we just ordered the lobster risotto.  The lobster was juicy & sweet & paired with risotto perfectly. It was like every bite elicited a wow. We had the Chef's Stew & Pitchfork again, but added The Smoke on the Blvd. This was made with Woodford Rye & actually smoked in a small glass smoker on the bar. Highly recommend. 
All in all, this visit exceed our expectations 150%  Omar, Joanna & Timbaer were attentative & helpful. They seemed to enjoy working at HK. Only drawback is we didn't get to meet Chef Christina, who we heard is now the general manager of the Ramsay restaurants in Vegas.

When entering the restaurant, you are greeted immediately by a few employees & the hostess. Upon greeting, the hostess asked if we were celebrating a birthday, which in fact we were! Due to it being a mock service soft opening, our party was split into groups of four. 

We were greeted by another hostess that walked us through the restaurant to our table. The hostess provided us some fun facts about the restaurant and how it relates to the television show. It was really cute how all the employees were wearing hints of blue or red team, including the chefs! The kitchen area was open where the chefs worked so you were able to see the chef action!

We were seated at our table and our server immediately greeted us and introduced the menu, providing a first hand experience of each item and her personal favorites. My personal favorite dish at the restaurant was the Quinoa Salad. The Pineapple Carpaccio has a really fun and interesting presentation using dry ice - definitely made it feel like I was part of the show!

My wife's lobster risotto was dry and very tiny for 24.00. They bill the lobster as being poached in butter, it was not.

We were greeted by the server right away and explained the menu to us. A couple people in our group had an obligation prior so they ate with a couple of friends but still wanted to celebrate with us. Came and sat down and just wanted to order appetizers. When we all ordered and it was their turn, the sever, Michael (with an accent), rudely told them that if they were only gonna order appetizers, they can go ahead and go to the bar instead! I feel that that information could have been communicated differently and not in a rude manner. ESPECIALLY to a group of people who work in the industry. We very well know how we should have been treated. On top of that, two of the people in our group had to catch a show so they left us with cash to pay for their bill. When it was time to ask for their bills,and we wanted to split it, the server was so rude and said ""WHERE ARE THE TWO?!"" In a tone where he's suspecting them to have left without paying. 
We don't come to fine dining or high class known restaurants just for the good food, we expect to also be treated AT LEAST decently. 
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE NOR WILL I BE GOING BACK TO THEM. Everyone saw the picture and asked us how the restaurant was and I couldn't help but to warn others about this experience. 
Today, I  wanted to talk to the manager to relay the experience to prevent it from happening to others. When the hostess, Habica, answered and asked what it was for... I told her it was about a past experience. She told me to hold on but hung up the line. When I called back, she put me on a really long hold. I begun to get the feeling that they don't wanna let me reach any manager.
For a new restaurant & especially a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I expected more respect. We often go to the Burger one in planet Hollywood. But obviously, this place needs more training with customer service or just talking to people in a respectful manner. When I called back after getting hung up, the hostess Habica didn't even apologize and said ""it was probably an accident"" 
ALSO, the server was so persistent with EVERYONE wanting to order entree that he doubled my friends' appetizers. We even called and asked if it was okay that a couple of people just ordered appetizers and the hostess clearly informed us that it shouldn't be a problem",M4tyqwsqBRXKAasRrFAD7w,9,2,2,2ULMX3W20qLptj9HQsjcNQ

4684748,2018-06-29,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My husband and I came here with very high expectations. I had made reservations for dinner WAY in advance and was able to score a prime time dinner spot. The reviews on yelp were also very high. 

Before we got to the restaurant, we knew exactly what we were going to order. We arrived almost 20 minutes early, but got seated right away. I was a bit disappointed because our seats did not have a view of the open kitchen. 

Our servers were also very amazing! Drinks were refilled before the drink was finished and plates were cleaned right away. They really have a good system going on here. 

I decided to get the 'notes from gordon' cocktail. It was recommended by our server. The drink is $14, but it comes in a pretty large glass. I could barely taste the alcohol, but the drink was overall very tasty. 

As far as food, we decided to share two dishes. 
-Lobster Risotto: This is highly recommended. It's a pretty small dish to share among a group of people, but was a good amount to share for two. There is a very generous amount of lobster, and the risotto itself was SO flavorful. 

-Beef Wellington: We couldn't leave without trying Ramsey's signature dish. We were both excited to try this for the first time, and it was very.... underwhelming! Don't get me wrong. It was a tasty dish, but I expected to be blown away after reading the reviews on this dish. The beef was very tender, but I found that it was a little bland overall. 

-Toffee Pudding: Save your appetite for this one! My husband and I first tried this dessert at The Pub and we LOVED it so much. That's why we made sure not to order so much food so we can enjoy the dessert. This has got to be one of my favorite desserts of all time. Don't leave Vegas without trying this!! 

I don't watch Hell's Kitchen, but it seems like there are some chefs who work here who have been on this show.",T4rXSHtNUOA47GXS63S6mg,0,0,4,T7CzfNPFomuWuHxVHxD30w

It's located in front of Caesars Palace in a stand alone building. It's spacious, new and modern. Best to make a reservation otherwise you'll be turned away. I was alone and got seated at the bar within a few minutes. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and restaurant. 

The scallops were tender and cooked to perfection. They are one of my favorites and seeing them cooked on Hells Kitchen compelled me to order them. I was not disappointed. I also ordered pumpkin bisque and that was velvety smooth and tasty. My neighbors had Ahi tuna and crispy skin salmon for which they were also amazed. 

I will definitely go back and try some other dishes before I head back to my home on Maui. If you're in Vegas, do not miss this iconic restaurant.",hCyWdR08Y7_tLD4PPi51BQ,2,3,5,thcoRChbD691CblT7i_1pw

We originally had a dinner reservation but our plans changed and we did lunch. The menu covers all desires and very well thought out. We had a group of 8 and a very nice bottle of wine, what a nice Friday!!! We ordered various appetizers, scallops, lobster risotto and wafts meatballs all fantastic!!! As far as entrees we went all over the board- seafood tower, short ribs, hell' burger, brick chicken grilled cheese and one ordered the preset 3 course meal. Everything was as advertised! The favorites were the short ribs, hell burger and brick chicken. We rallied for dessert and went with the insanely cool and delicious pineapple dry ice creation- so good!! We have had the toffee pudding and Ramsay steak but this was a different ice cream and presentation. Overall very well done mr Ramsay!!!

When you walk in it is what you would expect from watching the show. Even in the food prep area the cooks were wearing red and blue. 
Now the food. The 2 things that are always going wrong on the show happened to our order. The lobster risotto was bland ( needed salt) and was cold. The scallops were cooked uneven and cold in the center.

The waitress came over and greeted us and asked if we were the ""buckley party."" Very nice touch. When I asked the waitress if she would mind taking a photo of us she offered to have us walk up towards the kitchen so we could have it in the background. Then she did a little run though of the menu. I order the lobster risotto and the fixed lunch menu. My husband got the meatballs and salmon. I wished they have sold the beef Wellington separately because that was the reason I got the fixed. Amazing lobster risotto but a very small portion. Is it bigger on tv?? Lol. Beef Wellington was very good. But the sticky toffee pudding OMG so good!!! My husband got the rum donkey and said it was good and he'd get it again. 

I loved Ramsay fish and chips but Ramsay burger was a little disappointing. But Hell's Kitchen by far the best of them all. Make sure you make a reservation ASAP because they go quick.

I wasn't planning to have a meal here when I booked my trip to Vegas, but after passing by the restaurant a few times to play at Caesar's Palace, my fiance and I just couldn't ignore our growing curiosity.

We made reservations for the next day @ lunch, since dinners were fully booked. This place is reservation only, so don't expect to be able to walk in for dinner. 

We shared our orders and we had more than enough food between us.

I ordered: 
Set Course which included a Pumpkin puree soup, Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. The meal was decadent and although I thought the Beef Wellington would be the star, I actually loved the soup the most!

Note from Gordon Ramsay Cocktail was incredible. They infuse their own green tea and peach made in house. It also has a funny message from Gordon included in the drink.

He ordered:
Lobster Risotto
Charcuterie Pizza

The pizza was amazing. Every bite I took was a good balance of cheese and excellent quality charcuterie meats. It was probably one of the best pizzas I've had a restaurant (aside from Italy of course). We don't normally order pizza but as we were waiting in line to be seated, I was able to see the chefs making pizza and it just looked too good to pass up. 

I don't watch the show regularly but I now have a new respect for Gordon Ramsay. Next time in Vegas, I will make sure to make a reservation for dinner!",2Ub_N3uo97nTi8z-y8BnAA,1,1,5,XY2hmqpbSO6JYlKi3RZ9XA

It may  e tied to a corny, but entertaining, TV show but no theatrics here, simply a great menu you want to try.  I also love the location directly on the srrip. Yummmmmn.  My only complaint is the plate design they used (brown and rust colored) simply bc it is  poor choice for diners visually. I also am surprised the interiors don't live up to the GR standard.

I made reservations for my friend and I for lunch about 2 months in advance (highly recommend doing this for either lunch or dinner).  We were seated at a table with a wonderful view of Caesar's Palace and the strip.  Our server was fantastic-Since it was our first time there, we asked for recommendations. My friend was going to initially order a pancake dish and the server told her it was more of a kid's dish.  She suggested either the beef Wellington or the short ribs. We both ended up ordering the braised short ribs-The best decision ever!!  Both dishes came out piping hot and stayed that way until the very last bite.  The short rib was so incredibly tender and the polenta was so flavorful.  For dessert my friend and I shared the pineapple carpaccio-thinly sliced pineapple with 5 small scoops of coconut sorbet. It was the perfect way to cleanse the palette and end the meal with a dessert that wasn't heavy.  Our server was fantastic-she checked in on us to make sure we were doing ok and to make sure that our water glasses were always full.

Our reservation granted us a place in line where we waited 30 minutes past the reserve time to be seated. We ordered immediately and waited and waited for water service, which was finally delivered with our appetizer. 

Food wise, Scallops were everything I had expected of Gordon Ramsey and more... then everything went downhill fast. It took over an hour and a half after our appetizer for our lunch orders to be served. We had brick pressed chicken (mediocre at best, though the sweet potato has was decent), prime rib grilled cheese sandwich (good, but nothing special), followed by sticky toffee pudding, which took another 30 minutes to arrive. 

Our server was rarely present and switched half way with no introduction. The serving area was a bit chaotic... we would have welcomed a profanity screaming head chef bringing order to it. The general ambiance was one of confusion, despite the well laid out floor plan and decor.

They have only been open a week... hope some resolution to service and food quality will be redeemed with time, though I will not waste another Vegas dining opportunity here.",lCFn6dBcjYyKdnQV5DsS6A,2,0,2,Ub9bwaljosRT9sWflniMXA

We had early lunch reservations but we probably could have just walked in. By the time we left there was a bit of a queue for a table. 

Be prepared to spend a bit of money, especially if you order big entrées and the signature dishes. The sides are extra also. If you order the strip steak and two sides you're dropping $70 right there without an app or drinks. 

Our server was terrific, very helpful and took the time to talk to us and about the restaurant. He took extra care of my elderly parents and made the event special. The rest of the waitstaff was extremely attentive and pleasant. 

I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which was very flavorful and delicious. It came with fries that were very good. My partner ordered the wild mushroom pizza. It was very tasty and the crust was perfect. We also ordered the pan-seared scallops. They were good but they were a little burnt and probably wouldn't have made it to our table if Chef Ramsey had been at the pass. Lol!

My boyfriend and I watched all of season 17 together, and once I was the open table reservation made an impulse decision to book one. Best decision of my life. The food is phenomenal. We started out with the wagu meatballs in tomato sauce. Tasted great, looked fantastic, really good for a starter. Then we chose the steak for 2. Which included a 32oz cut of steak and 2 sides. Carbs team so we chose the baked Mac and cheese and potato gratin. Both loved and looked amazing. The Mac and cheese was my favorite. The potato gratin was a little on the oily side but it still tasted great. The steak was awesome also. There was just enough meat to get 2 people full. It came with roasted tomatoes and garlic and mushrooms. So I put a lot of flavor on the steak. I'm a sucker for roasted garlic so that won me over regardless.

The ambiance was so beautiful. The iconic hella kitchen theme was all over the place. The table placements were so cute. The waiters were so nice and always checked up on us and filled our waters. We had to rush to a 7pm show so I was really sad I didn't get anything from the small gift shop. It's located next to Caesars Palace. So best thing to do I guess would be Uber or taxi, or if you're in no rush you can self park and just walk.

Had a hard time hearing our waiter as well as the people I was with. The food was tasty but no more tasty then any other fine dining spaces in Vegas. 
The meals we had included Beef Wellington, which was good but the chunk of beef had a ton of gristle in it. Smoked Golden Beets salad, Braised short rib, Filet  mignon w bearnaise. The bearnaise sauce seemed like an odd sauce for the steak. Sugar Snap Pea's which our whole party devoured along with Potato Gratin. We finished dinner with a Sticky Toffee Pudding which in fact wasn't pudding but more a dense cake w a scoop of ice cream on top & a very interesting pineapple desert served over dry ice.

Everyone wants to talk about the show.  We heard the servers telling everyone over and over again about how to get a picture with the Hells Kitchen winner Michelle.  (She was very gracious and took a picture with us despite being really busy). My wife did the price fix menu for 72with the scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  I had the scampi prawns flambé, the crispy skin salmon, a side of the Brussels sprouts and the pineapple carpaccio dessert.  Everything was excellent!  Each course better than the one before it.  The Wellington was cooked medium rare and was melt in your mouth delicious. The scallops were done perfectly, only complaint is they slice them thin, so it's not a full scallop. The prawns are set on fire table side, it's very impressive.  The Brussels sprouts are done in a vinegar sauce that gives them a little kick, they were so good.  The salmon is served skin up, and it was crispy.  The pineapple dessert is done with dry ice center so it comes to you smoking, it was really cool.  Just be warned I tried to spear a piece of pineapple and toppled the whole thing over, it's a little tricky to eat but the combo of the coconut ice cream and thin pineapple was so good.  Reminded me of a dole whip.

The food was delicious. It was very entertaining to see the two teams compete against each other. The presentation of the food was amazing. The service was top notch as well! Would eat here again!",HffJGgXdf82JYMfh0glhUA,0,0,5,LjxZBZ644CVgmIgdc-IUmQ
4834373,2018-01-25,9,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"This restaurant truly deserves more than five stars! We made reservations ahead of time as I'm a huge foodie and love checking out the newest places. Mind you, I have never seen the tv show nor do I know any of the signature dishes so the whole experience was based on everything presented.

The restaurant is located on the strip, just outside of Caesars Palace. The decor is really nice and I love the atmosphere. We checked in with the hostess and were seated right away. Within a minute or two a server approached us with the menus and took our drink orders. I explained to him that I had never seen the show and would love suggestions on the menu. He explained all very thoroughly. 

We both decided on the tasting menu as the waiter described it having three of Gordon Ramsey's signature dishes. Within minutes we were also served an extra course compliments of the chef.

The first course that was compliments of the chef was garlic hummus in a pastry (I forgot the actual name). Next within minutes the appetizers were served. I ordered the scallops as they were recommended but also tried out the caesar salad. The scallops were beautifully presented and tasted even better than their appearance. The salad had garlic croutons which added an extra touch. 

For the entree, apparently the Beef Wellington is the most popular dish and that is the only entree available with the tasting menu. I had never tried Beef Wellington before but this blew my mind! The taste is incredible with all the right ingredients and spices. I enjoyed the side dishes being light as the entree itself was pretty heavy. 

Next came time for the dessert. When I first read the name - sticky toffee pudding I was very unimpressed. However the dessert was nothing like what I thought it was going to be. It was like heaven in the mouth! Honestly probably one of the BEST desserts I have ever eaten in my life! The ice cream, the flavors, just everything was so perfect! I would honestly come back for just this dessert.

Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant and I hope to eat here again in the future. Everything from the service to the decor to the food was beyond amazing. I love the open kitchen as well and being able to watch everything. One of my new favorite restaurants in Vegas!

Update - Came back for lunch to try out the burgers and because I was craving the dessert again. The Hells Kitchen burger is fully stacked and quite spicy. My companion had his mouth on fire even though he loves spicy food. It was quite entertaining to watch. The signature burger I ordered was deliciously made as well and comes with a secret sauce. Both burgers are accompanied with french fries and come with dipping sauces. As always the sticky toffee pudding for dessert was heaven in my mouth. 

Highly recommend coming here for both lunch and dinner!",ovR3JwcQFzY2syeDennbuw,20,12,5,Na9-2vSpxA2y0wKh835tMA
4837854,2018-03-24,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I almost never write reviews unless a place surprises me. To be clear, Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas surpassed all my expectations. I've been to several other Gordon Ramsey restaurants around the world (however none of his locations in England where I'm sure his Michelin stars are especially well-deserved) and none of them particularly impressed me. There were always issues with the service, the value, or the execution. 
Tonight, I could really appreciate Chef Ramsey's skill, not just as a chef, but as an operator. Most chefs focus so much on the food they forget about the front of the house experience. Hell's Kitchen got so many things right, despite being a ""theme"", kitschy restaurant:

- Our reservation was sat almost to the minute. There's a reason why there are empty tables throughout the restaurant. It's because this isn't a churn and burn ripoff joint; they are timing their reservations properly so that slow table turns do not cause reservations to be delayed. 
- Thought went into the cocktail list, with most drinks requiring actual mixology skills to justify the $14-$16 price point. Presentation of some of the drinks actually resulted in ""dinner and a show"". 
- On a related note, the prices were reasonable, especially by Las Vegas standards. While possibly a more expensive a meal than most of the viewers of the Hell's Kitchen TV show would typically pay, for the quality of cooking, portion sizes, and ingredients, it was on par with most major US metropolitan cities - so relatively cheap by Las Vegas Strip standards. Our dinner the night before was twice the price, definitely had some misses in execution, still left us a little hungry, and was not as comfortable an experience. 
- There was adequate space between the tables. The restaurant is selling out every day and there is room to accommodate at least 15% more seats, if they wanted to emulate a lot of other popular Las Vegas restaurants. Chef Ramsey has instead opted to ensure the dining experience doesn't include your eavesdropping on the neighboring table's conversations. They are foregoing short term profits to provide guests with a positive experience and encourage repeat visitors. 
- The food we ate tonight was excellent. The foie gras was creative and one of the best tasting dishes I've ever had. Chef Ramsey's classic French training shows in the accompanying sauces, with the cauliflower and the salmon of particular note. Seafood is cooked perfectly, as evidenced by the scallops and the salmon. 
- Service is striving for fine-dining level, despite a lower price point and more casual environment. All of the staff were friendly, our server was excellent and comped a beer because the original order was not available. He was also attentive, but not obtrusive. The bussers were timely and cleared all dish and flatware after each course and kept water glasses filled. 
- Every thing was clean. The staff has been well trained to keep everything clean and to pay attention to the details. 

With so many good restaurants in Las Vegas, there are only a few I would plan to visit for a second time, and this is one of them.",U_4JmdP0ScS3NfJaTjQ0dw,2,0,5,xNvdyuJ4DEiicEzdbpxGng

The food was amazing, I had the scallops to start and eggs in purgatory, a spicy egg dish for my entree. For desert I had a chocolate sort of mousse with ice cream, delicious!   My husband ordered the beef wellington fixe meal. It was also delicious.  Everyone in our group was bery pleased. Exactly as you would expect.

We have dined numerous times at Gordon Ramsey Pub and have never been disappointed there either.

4856267,2018-06-12,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I love reading some of the negative reviews on here.  Because I can tell you that without a doubt they are completely full of crap!!!  Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen is not just good, it is a really great restaurant!  I really wanted them to screw something up, just so I could call it bland and send it back!  But I couldn't, it was all great!  That doesn't mean it was perfect, and I could see how some people may feel let down because there is still a lot of hype surrounding the opening of Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas.  But if you look at it for what it is, and what it is meant to be, it does a great job!  I personally think Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris is a nicer and better restaurant.  But I need to explain why.  Gordon Ramsay Steak is a fine dining restaurant, dinner moves at a very slow pace and there are many more options to pick from at Gordon Ramsay Steak!  Hell's Kitchen is designed to be a very high volume restaurant.  It is designed to give the Fanny Packers and Tourists from all over the country, and all over the world, myself included the opportunity to try some of Gordon's dishes and experience one of his restaurants.  The menu is very limited, just like on the TV show.  But each dish is executed perfectly and everything tasted amazing!  The Lobster Risotto was the best I have ever had!!!  I loved the Scallops as well, they were cooked perfectly and were pretty straightforward.  The Beef Wellington was perfect and totally lived up to it's reputation!  We tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I have had before and it is always so good!  I also tried the Pineapple Carpaccio.  It was a really fun dessert served with liquid Nitrogen.  But the Pineapple was under ripe, and so it was super tart and was a bit of let down.  I wouldn't order it again.  Our server was also not great, we were somewhat ignored most of the time and he even screwed up our bill.  I didn't bother to have him correct it because he was so busy.  So do a couple little missteps in a really crowded busy restaurant make it a bad experience or bad restaurant?  Not at all!  Overall it was a great experience!  It was so fun to meet Michelle for a moment from the last season of Hell's Kitchen.  The food was great and I am sure I will be back again soon.  But if you want a much slower paced fine dining experience try Gordon Ramsay Steak instead!  Hell's Kitchen is much more fun and fast paced, and it needs to be with the crowds standing out front!  I hope you get your chance to try the Lobster Risotto, Scallops, Beef Wellington, and some Sticky Toffee Pudding soon!!!",OGjXGh5Nb2Ly53MObm6PcA,0,0,5,caWrogUZOwUhouzHazU7sg

We got there about 15min early and we were seated almost right away. The restaurant was full. If you watched the show like I did then you'd appreciate the environment as it's pretty spot on. There was the kitchen line up with the chefs in red and chefs in blue, sous chefs and all! I ordered the salmon and potato scallops. Very flavorful! My husband ordered the beef Wellington and mac and cheese and OMG! It tasted absolutely amazing! We were also shocked at how affordable our bill was as we went to Gordon Ramsey's BLT inside Bally's during our last visit (amazing by the way) and Hell's Kitchen was half the cost!

4860047,2018-02-22,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"We came back for the the second time on our trip, and again we got the flawless wagyu meatballs as a starter. I decided to get the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which has a Fresno chili jam and a ghost pepper jack cheese. They serve breakfast all day, so I asked if the could add a fried egg to the burger. I was told that they ""couldn't"". 

We also couldn't get the lawash bread that they offer at dinner. Apparently, no customization is allowed (though removing things - like a tomato from a sandwich - is okay). Disappointing.

This time, the service wasn't so crisp. The water guy ended up doing most of the work with refills and catching up to the waiter with clarifications to our meal. He did a stellar job, but the waiter shouldn't just be there to take the order and give us the bill (other people delivered the food). We often had to get the water guy to find the waiter.

The burger was tasty - just spicy enough without being overpowering - but also ice cold by the time I got it. The waiter quickly took it back to be remade. It took about 5 minutes, and it was flawless. The guacamole and fresh tomato balanced the spicy elements, and I could still taste the beef in the perfectly seasoned chuck.

The chicken Caesar salad, grilled chicken sandwich, and New York strip that the rest of the table ordered were prepared properly and without issue. But, that's because they were being made while my burger was sitting out and getting cold.

Still worth a return trip, but I'm a little disappointed at the issues I had on an $182 bill (and no offer to comp or otherwise make up for the mistake on the burger).",dHFzOb-GzXdT5u3sUFKE_A,0,0,4,4Jj0syo3rORj3kB8BrRkLQ

The NY strip, Caesar salad with shrimp, rack of lamb, and filet entrees were all excellent as well.  The beef wellington was a bit bland.  The one problem was the red quinoa salad, which we believe may have been bad, as my wife was sick all night, and she alone ate that item. Bring your wallet, just a bit pricey.

As someone who was both a fan of the show and skeptical that the restaurant would live up to the hype, I was pleasantly surprised to be treated to both fantastic service and food. If you go in there, make sure to ask for John F and Gil. They are a team of servers that gave me some of the best service I've ever experienced. Thanks to both of those guys. 

Drinks: 

Our table ordered ice teas (which come with liquid sugar) and they were delicious. I got a refill every chance the waiter and assistant waiter got to refill. I never had an empty drink.

Food: 

we got quite a bit of food. I'll break it down below.

Lobster Risotto: I'll start with what I thought was the weakest dish. This tasted ok, but after watching Hell's Kitchen so many times I feel like it just didn't live up to the hype. It tasted bland (I've never had this before) and the lobster tasted undercooked. It wasn't hot but more on the warm to cold side. I told my server and he took care of us on it.

Cauliflower Side: This was an absolute surprise for us. FANTASTIC! The seasoning and cheese was delicious. Piping hot. We loved it so much we ordered a second side.

Mac and Cheese Side: pretty good! Definitely a great side. Unfortunately for us, we had this delivered with our meal and we couldn't finish all of it. Very, very cheesy! Would recommend for Mac n cheese fans :)

Scallops starter: DELICOUS! A must. We got this as part of the Wellington meal package thing. Very very good.

Beef Wellington: Hands down the best filet I've ever had. I have to come back here for this. The hype was up high for this and it did not disappoint. One of the best meals I've ever had.

Toffee: holy crap. As someone who loves desert, this was one of the best things I've ever eaten. I actually was sad I couldn't finish it all",t-038n9QfizwZ6P4-qkk6g,1,0,5,VziDtGysfe-pjJiQ5_AMew

This place really is best for someone who knows the show to fully understand the experience but as far as the food goes it's Amazing but the awesome effects and setting is what made this awesome . As you walk in they have the entrance decked with merch and a cool thing with Gordon doing various stuff on a screen which for me is awesome .. if you are coming to town make a reservation and don't give up hope as it does open up when folks cancel .. 

I got mine on opentable for my birthday feb 10 ... which was a Saturday . It's at Caesars but in the old serendipity location which means the uber : lyft drop you just go down the walkway and it's there ..

We arrived about 20 minutes before our 6:15 reservation some of the hostesses were really great at ignoring people so my one take away would be they could be a little more attentive ... however the one who ended up seating us was awesome .. but I'll shout her out later ..

We made our way to the bar and the bartenders were all pretty busy and it took a bit to get someone to greet us but once Kevin made his way to us he hooked us up with some cool starter drinks .. since I didn't have a seat I opted to try notes from Gordon and it was delicious ... my mom got meet your maker and it was good if you are a whiskey fan .

Thing with the drinks is they have awesome flavor but a lot of them have cool effects if you want experience drinks you go with rum donkey that is a tiki and lights on fire or there is one that smokes and I have already forgotten the name but we ended up with that too but my favorite was the Fear and loathing because I love mezcal and it really had the flavor behind it ... with that said if you drink these cocktails are worth it !!

Once our table was ready  Andrea seated my Mom while I settled the bar tab and even came back to get me so I could find our table . She was awesome and said Happy Birthday as I got to my table which had an epic view of the fountain and the strip . It was exactly what I wanted because even tho I love the show I prefer a pretty view and quieter area .

We got Blessed with Derek for our server who not only has an epic smile but great energy and is on top of his game making sure we had everything we need while recommending good stuff !! My mom isn't a fan of rare meat so we had to do some menu work arounds but he handled I all awesome sauce style .. 

I could go into detail on the food but that usually isn't my style so I won't break all the food down but I'm gonna shout out some of the winners ... 
I feel if you're going with the Wellington you won't be disappointed .. I was a bit worried cause some folks had issues with it not being cooked right but mine came out perfect and my other half that I had left over was still delicious the next day . I got the tasting menu because my Mom wanted sticky toffee pudding ... the scallops were good..

The pumpkin soup is sooo worth it!!! I imagine if you came for lunch it would pair awesome with some of the sandwiches but we both loved it with our meal .. my mom doesn't even like soup and she licked her bowl clean lol 

Our lobster risotto was delicious and remember it's an appetizer so the portions that people complain about need to get a reality check that it isn't an entree but for us it melted in our mouth ...

We had Mac and cheese & calliflower (spelling) both were really delicious 

Now I already shouted out Derek's praises but I really want to make a point to say for a Saturday one that both Gordon and Michelle were here plus chef christina he did so awesome but another superstar was our busser Jason ..

Hell's Kitchen is an experience. I am a fan of the show so I knew exactly what I wanted. Best Caesar salad I have ever had. I could eat it everyday  Beef Wellington was delicious, never had it before and it's a lot of meat. Toffee pudding was out of this world. 
Drink I had was Pimm's cup. I had two.

Anyway, we had lobster risotto and salad for appetizer. The lobster risotto was great! Portion is kinda on the small side but the lobster was cooked well and rice very flavorful. Caesar salad is good, but nothing special(well it's a Caesar salad duh) and could probably use just a little less dressing.

I had the short rib grilled cheese which is pretty good! It came with potato chips which oddly has a lot of burnt/crumbles that was very oily and made up about 2/3 of the cup, had to send that back because they were just not good. I asked the waitress if that's how it's suppose to be and she said no it should be mostly the big nice looking chips so she send it back and offered if we want to change it to fries instead which we did. The grilled cheese also came with some pickled vegetables which is a nice tough, very refreshing since grilled cheese and the pulled short rib could be kinda heavy.

The beef Wellington that's part of the lunch set was great. It's kinda small but good size since we ordered appetizers and there's going to be dessert later. Mash potatoes is nice decoration but kinda blended.

The dessert is this toffee pudding(I think) with buttermilk ice cream on top. I have to say it looks horrible lol but taste really good. Kinda on the sweet side and very buttery. And oddly this is the only thing that's huge from what we ordered throughout the whole lunch. I doubt anybody that had a full meal can finish this dessert by him/herself alone! It is really good though.

Didn't order alcohol since we already had a lot earlier. We had the ice tea which is just pretty average. 

Service overall is nice. The only thing that was kinda strange is that the server which is not he waitress that was taking care of us packed the left over for me. And he somehow left half of the dish somewhere and didn't packed it in the box?! And it's not like we have about two bites left and pack it. I have more than 1/2 of the sandwich plus most of the fries and pickles. Our waitress basically had to have the kitchen make something to put in the box. 

The dining room is actually beautiful. It's very tourisy with the gift shop look at the front. But that's also what makes this fun cuz they have the red kitchen and blue kitchen going on. Would come again for sure. Make sure you book it early! :)",DJQAv8CwJpIKHvbrTcz4oA,0,0,4,yMJsyoPSUHk7vNLACF2fVA

The menu is modeled after some of the hits from the TV show. The manager of the restaurant also coincidentally (or not) looks like Gordon Ramsey from a distance. Steve the bartender, was super helpful all night, and assured me that it's just an odd coincidence.

I ordered the classic Beef Wellington, which was of course, cooked perfectly. I followed it up with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I also really enjoyed. I also paired it with one of the tiki drinks they offered, the Rum Donkey, which is served to you literally on fire.

The staff and decor are pretty much right out of the TV show, with an open kitchen, and half the staff wearing the red and the other wearing blue.

Literally in the back corner of the place by the wine fridge. You can not see any of the kitchen or most of the decor. Hard to experience watching anything going on in what should be the main attraction. The only time we seen the cool kitchen was walking out. And on a trip to the RR. Which was pretty. 

Apps were all spot on. 

Scampi. Flames were pretty cool. 

Tartare was better than most seafood places. 

Scallops that came with the Prix Fixe were perfect. 

Lobster Risotto stole the show. Literally ate every grain of rice. 


Short rib entree is a must. The flavor was line it's been cooked. Then tweaked to make it better and then cooked again to infuse more flavor. 

Beef Wellington lived up to the hype. Think. 3000x better pot roast but w a steak. 

Pineapple carpaccio stole the show. No way should you be able to get that much explosive flavor in a fruit. 

Sticky toffee pudding is still on my mind days later. 

Just wish we could have had a better spot. Especially for the cover we ended up paying is like to enjoy more of the ambience. 


Also when we left we seen the puffs that they were letting people try complimentary. Wish we had that. Service was decent. Had to wait a bit for my drinks but not an issue.

5007091,2018-01-05,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Came tonight for the soft opening. It was amazing to say the least. The staff was beyond wonderful and the foot made every bite like a small piece of heaven. Each cocktail is beautifully crafted to give a unique yet familiar experience. I think the cocktail ""Note from Gordon"" was one of my favorites. It was a big drink, and it comes with a little note in the garnish that made me laugh.

On to the layout. The room still has the feel of Serendipity when it was there, but it was nicely updated to give the feel that you're in the show. The kitchen is divided into the red and blue team, but instead of fighting each other, they work to create a perfect experience.

Try the scallops appetizer. I would have never thought apples with scallops but dang it's delicious! I could eat so many of those and make that a full meal.

The lobster risotto comes with a whole butter poached lobster tail and is cooked to perfection. It's not a huge portion by any means, but it's still a great entree size.

The New York is great but I feel it was missing something that set it over the edge. Maybe a little more sauce or some extra of the mushrooms/peppers that come on top. One way or another, it was still better than a lot of steaks I've had in this city.

Sides... get the Mac and cheese, and the cauliflower. I don't care if you typically don't like those items... these ones are life changing. I finished both of those off before I even touched anything else.

Overall, it's quite the experience and very delicious! One of the best points right now is the price is relatively cheap. Still expensive, but way cheaper than what I was expecting. I'm sure it will increase in price, so go now before it goes up!",ta8-SiJFepGmkJNyR_n8hg,5,3,5,ajISN4ZQ2FZX5-qKaJUAfA

We decided to try the scallops, which are a staple of the show, and the meatballs as appetizers. Both were excellent choices!!!

Instead of the preset menu, we decided to go with burgers. I had the HK Burger which was cooked precisely to order. It's hot and spicy and the ghost pepper cheese was a new experience for me. We also tried a Short Rib Grill Cheese which we are determined to learn to make when we get back to Iowa.

This eatery was probably one of my biggest disappointments. The venue was more like a cafeteria than a restaurant with extremely high decibel levels of noise. 
More importantly, the food was not up to the standards we are accustomed to from a Ramsey inspired restaurant. 
We ordered two portions of the Lobster Risotto, which was perfectly platted, pleasing to eye, but unfortunately not to the palette. The Lobster was chewy and not cooked. Both parties advised the waiter and he apologized and had the Chef make another. Unfortunately, the replacements fared no better and were returned. 
Strike one for the appetizers. 
For the main course we had two orders of the Beef Wellington and a Steak. 
The steak was good, however, the vaunted Wellington, one of Ramsey's Signature dishes was pedestrian, dried out with little flavor. 
The side dish of a mashed potato was the highlight of the event and represented my dinner. 
The Mac & Cheese was also below par. 
I will however give The ""Devil his due"" as the waitstaff and bartenders were ""spot on"" with their service and breath and scope of the menu. 
If only we could get those ""Donkeys"" in the Kitchen to pick up their game!

5022894,2018-02-12,4,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"The only restaurant that the wife and I made reservations weeks in advance of our arrival in Las Vegas was for dinner on a Monday night at Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen.  Both the wife and I are avid watchers of his namesake Hell's Kitchen show and we both love his Gordon Ramsay Steak, so it was a no-brainer to check out the place for dinner during its soft opening.  The restaurant was, for the most part, aesthetically appealing both inside and out.  However, for obvious reasons, it didn't look like what you see on the TV show.  If there was one thing that detracted for me from the restaurant's aesthetic appeal, it was the waiting area that also served as a gift shop hawking Gordon Ramsay and Hell's Kitchen merchandise.  I understand the reason why it was there, but I thought it was tacky considering none of his other restaurants in town have a similar retail setup, which seemed more akin to something you'd find at Hooters than an upscale restaurant from a Michelin-starred chef.

We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:45 reservation and were seated promptly at our appointed time.  We were seated by the windows overlooking the Strip.  It was easily one of the best people-watching spots to be found on the Strip.  I started off with a cocktail while we looked over the menu.  I had the Smoke on the Blvd ($14), a cocktail made with Woodford Rye, Aperol, Averna Amaro, and sweet vermouth and delivered to the table in a stylish cherry wood, smoke-filled glass box.  Given its beautiful presentation and use of premium ingredients, I felt I received tremendous value for my quite delicious cocktail.  As for our food, Hell's Kitchen offers a 3-course tasting menu featuring signature dishes from the show.  It was tempting, however, we opted to create our own multi-course meal.  Several, if not most, of the menu items may be found on the menus of his other restaurants.  That said, it was explained to us that there were subtle differences between similar offerings from his various restaurants.  We shared an order of Lobster Risotto ($24).  I had the Beef Wellington ($49).  The wife had the Herb-crusted Rack of Lamb ($39).  We shared sides of Wild Mushrooms ($9) and Roasted Cauliflower ($9).  We finished off our meal by splitting an order of Sticky Toffee Pudding with Speculoos Ice Cream.  My Beef Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was oh so tender.  Chef Ramsay wasn't in the house when we were there, but he likely wouldn't have been shouting at anyone for how our food turned out.  Everything looked and tasted great.  Our server David was knowledgeable and attentive and the entire team seemed perfectly choreographed ensuring we had a great experience.

For sentimental reasons and the almost over-the-top experiences I've had there, Gordon Ramsay Steak remains my favorite Gordon Ramsay restaurant in town.  In the end, Hell's Kitchen was as good as we'd hope it would be.  Even though Hell's Kitchen was only in its soft opening, it seemed like the place was running like a seasoned veteran on the Strip.  It certainly wasn't like the TV show where chefs are frequently getting kicked out of the kitchen for mistakes.  It's a safe bet that this place will be very popular for the foreseeable future.

5042621,2018-04-04,2,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"I tried to take in our experience through Gordon Ramsay's eyes, ears and taste. Here is what I believe he would say about our experience.

I made reservations for dinner far in advance for 3 of us and we were celebrating a birthday. On the day of the reservation we had 2 more friends surprise us with their presence, so I needed to expand our seating to 5. I walked in earlier in the day, of our reservation, and asked to change seating to 5. The hostess was so pleasant and made sure we could have 5 for dinner-I'm sure my awesome negotiating skills helped ;)

GORDON WOULD SAY ""GOOD JOB"" for the Hostess effort.

Once we were seated if took a long time for the server, Megan, to get to our table. Overall, Megan was awesome and worked very hard. I know it was a very busy evening and many things were out of her control (as you will see later). Waiting 10-12 minutes or more was just too long as she should have been over to our table to introduce herself within 2-3 minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine to start the evening off. Their wine list has some good choices and the wine connoisseur at our table ordered their Faust Napa Cab. 2014. What was then served to us was Faust Napa Cab. 2015. This is a huge pet peeve of mine and happens often (see many of my reviews). Often the excuse is that it's an ""old wine listing."" I knew this couldn't be the case here as Hell's Kitchen just opened! The 2015 is a bit cheaper than the 2014 although rated high as well. We, in fact, ordered 2 and enjoyed it. The point is to get the wine list 100% correct or your customers will think you are putting one over on them. They lose a full star on the wine vintage problem.

GORDON WOULD SAY ""YOU DONKEY"" Regarding the vintage.

Here is what we enjoyed and all shared on the dinning side. Wagyu Meatballs (ordinary), lobster risotto (great flavor but served lukewarm), smoked Gouda mac & cheese (awesome), beef wellington (outstanding as promised), short ribs (maybe the best dish), NY strip steak (good) and the brick pressed chicken (too dry). 

GORDON WOULD SAY ""PISS OFF"" on the chicken. risotto and the meatballs. But....

GORDON WOULD SAY ""GOOD JOB"" On the beef wellington, mac & cheese, NY strip and short rib.

For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding (outstanding) and the pineapple carpaccio (served with dry ice for a wonderful smoke/fog effect). I ordered black coffee to have with my dessert. The coffee arrived cold! Megan apologized and said they would brew me a new pot. Problem is it took 10 minutes to brew and I had finished my wonderful sticky pudding (I would have loved to have them together). When she finally brought me the fresh brewed coffee it was VERY weak with no flavor  and I couldn't drink it. Megan did take the coffee off the bill, but lack of good coffee can ruin a meal for people like me ;)

GORDON WOULD SAY 'HOW PATHETIC"" Regarding the coffee situation But....

GORDON WOULD SAY ""GOOD JOB"" on the sticky pudding and pineapple carpaccio.

The atmosphere is fun and energetic and overall I would recommend dinning at Hell's Kitchen. I went in thinking this could be a 5 star for me, but the problems with the long wait, wine vintage, a few of the dishes and the coffee had me take 2 stars off. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I may try it again. The negative situations I encountered are so easily corrected. I hope I can come back and give them a full 5 stars.

I have been to Gordon Ramsay Steak several times and loved it, so I wanted to try another restaurant of his in Vegas. This restaurant is more casual. The dress code says business casual, but there were people in flip flops, t-shirts, and sweatpants - really everything. Vegas tends to let everyone in though, but it's good to note you won't be frowned upon for not wearing a nicer outfit. The ambiance was much louder than Gordon Ramsay Steak as well. We found the music playing to be kind of strange, more like what you hear on the radio rather than what you expect at a decently nice restaurant. 

The setup was cool as well with the whole kitchen as an open layout. You could see all the beef wellington's lining up to be served! 
Now for the food. No real complaints here. I have to say I was excited for the bread since he does an excellent job on his bread at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but they don't serve bread here! I was so upset to find this out. Primarily because at Hell's Kitchen the show/restaurant, they serve a ton of bread. The food we ordered was nice. We had the lobster risotto which was a nice portion and very good. The lobster was excellent, perfectly cooked, and it was cut into pieces which made it easy to eat. We then shared the beef wellington. They like to tell you its small, but we split all of the food among three people, and it was fine. I've always shared the beef wellington and its perfect for when you want to try other dishes as well. Gordon Ramsay can't mess up the beef wellington, it's always perfect. We had the mac and cheese as a side which was super cheesy which I love and had a nice flavor with crispy pancetta. We also had the mushrooms which were good but nothing to brag about.",5-corG2RqN4iqamWfSLAPA,1,0,4,YPNKbuhlXP6e-qEuPbM1yA

The first great thing about this restaurant is that unfortunately we were almost 30 mins late due to something out of our control and they still seated us within 5 mins of arrival with no issues (we did call ahead to let them know). We did let our waiter know that we were a little pressed for time bc we were going to see a show. It feels like he still took a little while but the restaurant was a little busy. The biggest turn off was that we asked for the best wine for our dinner and he proceed with ""well the cheapest..."". Not sure if we portrayed that we were on a budget but it was extremely rude. However, the guy who gave us the wine was very kind and considerate and gave us great options and choices. I ordered the salmon and potato gratin, one of my friends ordered the steak and the other ordered the meatballs and macaroni. We all were in love!

5064269,2018-05-10,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Being a huge Gordan Ramsay fan, and foodie, of course we had to check out this place! A year ago I went to Gordan Ramsay steak and had his infamous beef wellington there for the first time and was so stunned by how great it tasted, so naturally I was extremely excited to check this place out.

We arrived at the restaurant slightly early, but the place was so overbooked that we had to stand in line for 15 minutes in order to be seated.

We ordered two sets (which comes with seared scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding), short ribs, new york strip, and wagyu meatballs amongst the four of us. 

The appetizers were underwhelming- my scallops looked more like boiled/poached then seared that we had to send it back into the kitchen. And even the second time, they were inconsistent. Some of the scallops were seared on one side, some were more seared than others, and some were still not seared... (see my pictures)
Seared (boiled) scallops: 2/5 stars

The meatballs were a-ok, we thought it was a little underwhelming, it had a bit of kick, but the flavors weren't up-to-par. 
3/5 stars

Entrees were great and consistent, we enjoyed them a lot, for some reason the beef wellington did not taste as good as the first time I had it at GRSteak, it was under-seasoned and the meat was more chewy. The short ribs and new york strip, nevertheless had great taste and sear. 
overall: 4/5 stars

For dessert, since our scallop dish was so disappointing, chef sent us a pineapple dessert, which was perfectly refreshing. The toffee puddings were good at first, but they were so big and chunky and overly sweet that I had to give up after 2 bites, as I felt the tingle in the back of my throat for having too much sugar at once. 
4/5 stars

Service, nevertheless, was spectacular, our server was attentive, polite, and our water was always filled. She came to check on us for the right amount of times, and even offered to switch out our scallops for the third time, but since we were so hungry we just ate them regardless.
5/5 stars

Overall its sadly an OK, a little disappointing as I am a huge fan of hells kitchen and anything Gordan Ramsay related. After all, still glad that I got to try this place, but for the price (~$90 per person) vs quality (eh), I probably will never be back.",JtQAVVqRZ5-7rAEx0imJJg,2,1,3,CieFoO3m-W2rxaAHd9y3yw

All the rest was below our expectations. We made reservation long ago, however had to wait 20 min to be seated. We chose the strip view - which was a definite mistake. Go for kitchen view. Strip view tables are behind some curtain (what was that for??), and there is an actual view only for the parties of 2. We were 3, so didn't get to see anything. When our food arrived (after a while) - it was all cold, below room temperature!! They might be still new, so didn't learn how to get the food hot to the customers. We notified our server, and they did remove all the meals from our check. We appreciate that a lot, however, that wasn't what we came for, we wanted to enjoy special food. I guess the food tasted good, however, it was so cold that we couldn't appreciate the taste. Have you ever tried cold beef wellington??
Also, note that the portions are super tiny, so if you have a great appetite, you must open your wallet and order more.

I had the hamburger with ghost cheese. It was ordered medium, but served raw or rare. If it was medium rare, would have been ok. They remade it to between medium well and well done.

Hard to get drink refill for ice tea. Not good due to the burger being very hot with the pepper and ghost pepper.

5074496,2018-02-25,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Gordon Ramsey set the standard for perfect plates to be sent out of his kitchen and nothing less - so I expected that from this hyped up restaurant. We entered and gave our reservation to the hostesses (three of them sat at the counter with unfriendly vibes, no smiles, young, and no experience). We had to wait in a roped off line for our reservation to be ready and there were no places to sit (which I didn't like because girls like to wear heels when they're gonna go out and splurge on a nice $200+ meal). We were sat in the bar area at a high top which didn't feel like the dining room. The atmosphere felt like a cafeteria. It was checkered flooring and the lighting was too bright. The cheapest wine was $18 and so we looked to purchase a bottle since you can usually get more bang for your buck but the cheapest bottle was something like $70! For appetizers we ordered the seared scallops and the lobster risotto. After they came out we took one bite of each dish and immediately said them back because they were lukewarm. They came out after another 10 minutes and they were warmed up slightly we decided not to send them back again. The risotto was great but it could've used more salt (seemed to be a trend during our meal) and the scallops were nothing special. I ordered the short ribs and my husband ordered the beef Wellington. I wanted to order the short ribs so we could try something else on the menu because I already knew the beef Wellington would be great from the reviews. The short rib came out I took one bite and sent it back. It was the land, had no salt, and was burned. The polenta had absolutely no flavor and was actually a little watery. When I sent it back I requested the beef Wellington as a replacement. It came out within 5 minutes but I still needed salt. My husband love the dish as is and didn't think he needed the salt so maybe it was just me but I still needed it. My husband ordered the pre fixe menu so it came with dessert. The dessert on the menu was the sticky toffee putting with cookie butter ice cream on top. This was the only dish that we saw coming out of the kitchen even though the waiter said that they had a full menu of other dessert options. We took one bite and look at each other and said that this was one of the best dessert we've ever had in our lives. The size was huge and could definitely fill a table of four but we easily and happily ate it just the two of us. This was definitely the highlight of the night because everything else seem to be a flop. When the bill came the waiter didn't take anything off the bill which we were very surprised because we had to return to appetizers and a main course. The waiter merely said I hope we resolve the issue with the replaced beef Wellington. For a restaurant to be viewed as a finer dining establishment both my husband and I were somewhat surprised that they didn't accommodate taking off and entrée item. We were very disappointed and it seemed like this restaurant was really created only to capitalize on the name of health kitchen and not the culinary truth fine dining experience we thought it would be. I honestly can't believe Gordon Ramsay has back this restaurant with his name because if he had actually gone to the restaurant and monitor the activities of what was going in and out of the kitchen I'm sure he would be highly upset and it wouldn't have been up to his standards. To be brutally honest this restaurant should be named kitchen nightmares and not Hells kitchen.",UCNcbU6yroRbAHv05GaRgA,2,1,2,yg1uGI2XcHb5Jbsl9tC6YA

I ordered the lobster risotto. It came out at the same time someone at my table received their scallops. The scallops came on a hot plate and served excellent. My risotto was cold, the plate was cold, and the texture was off. I sent it back and the one that came out was much better tempt wise but was still off in texture for a true risotto. I then ordered a fillet rare. It came out medium leaning more towards medium well. I sent back a second dish. Second one came out perfect. For a restaurant of this stature I should not have had to send back every item I ordered in order for it to be served correctly. On top of this a manager NEVER came over to even address the fact the table had two items refired, let alone a simple table touch. Completely unimpressed. I am a local in the industry, I have opened new restaurants and understand this has only been open very briefly. However, I watched multiple people (who I would assume were managers) walk around the restaurant, and the fact not one of them table touched especially since two items were sent back at my table rubbed me the wrong. Was very bad customer service from a management perspective. An apology from the server is not enough when essentially if he put in the order correctly the outcome of food is not his fault. Inexcusable experience on behalf of management in the crucial early stages of a restaurant to get feedback from guests. Will give a second chance as i believe you can't truly judge a restaurant on one experience, but my expectations will be much higher

5094745,2018-04-05,32,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Sell out!  [beep]ing bollocks!  But then again the food is [beep]ing well done.

Personal rant:  I've been a fan of Gordon Ramsay since I ate at his flagship restaurant in London in the mid 2000's.  That along with his Boxwood Cafe and Maze, changed my perception of UK food.  He was a chef and restaurateur.  Sadly, his Vegas restaurants are largely all about capitalizing on image and name and far less so about the food (Gordon Ramsay Burger, Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips... need I say more?)  End rant.

Straight up, ignore the ridiculous decor, branding and merchandising.  Focus instead on the food.  In general, if you've heard it mentioned on the show, order it.  Portions are sensibly reduced which allows for a complete meal at a more affordable price.

For starters, the lobster risotto is very well done.  British style (thicker risoto) loaded with butternut squash puree that adds earthy sweetness backed by sage and an up front lobster broth all topped by a tender, butter poached lobster tail.  The seared scallops, equally impressive.  Cut in half, then incredibly well seared and seasoned scallops.  A pickled apple and celery root slaw provides the perfect acidic foil.  This dish is ""devour"" worthy!

The standout main, the beef wellington.  Perfect cook on the tenderloin, the initial searing and coating with Dijon mustard adds the perfect acidic zing and counterbalances the rich duxelles.  Well cooked pastry.  It all pairs well with the slightly sweet, syrupy red wine demi.  The silky potato puree, heaven.  Right behind in quality, the crispy skin salmon.  Though slightly over, the skin is so ethereally crisp it more than makes up for it.  The citrus herb beurre blanc adds great richness and acidic balance.  

For dessert, sticky toffee pudding.  Nuff said.

Service is enthusiastic but seems forced.  It will improve with time.

OK beverage program with lots of themed drinks.  OK wine list.  High Vegas resort markup.

Bottom line, [beep]ing  good.  That said,  if you're willing to spend a bit more, do yourself a favor and hit up Gordon Ramsay Steak instead.  Yes it's still themed but it delivers the same dishes at twice the quality and much more to offer.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,40,41,4,mFeFUqN0_567ZI1qhjQvoA

They do dress in the red/blue jackets and the TVs do show quite a bit of the series. The location is not inside Caesar, but on South Las Vegas Blvd to the left of the main Caesar Palace Entrance.

The restaurant itself is a good size, and as soon as you walk in, you'll see the restaurant's identity. Hostess in red dress will check you in and lead you to your table.  The menu option is not the typical full menu but a scale down. Still you have quite a few choices. Ironically, their Beef Wellington is not on there as an entree, but part of their pre fixie menu. 

The appetizer, Lobster Risotto was very good. The butter poached lobster was done just right, not too rubbery and the butternut squash bits put a nice crunch in the Risotto. It wasn't greasy or heavy and the portion size was perfect as an appetizer. The Pre Fixie menu came with either Caesar Salad or Pumpkin Soup. I opted for the Pumpkin Soup and it was very savory and delicious. The Beef Wellington was truly all that; done to perfection. Savory on the inside with a light and crispy pastry. The demi-glaze sauce wasn't needed but does give another taste element to the dish. The carrots and spring onions and mash potato made a good balance to the dish. The dessert, Gordon Ramsay Signature dessert, was something I didn't care much for. It was overly sweet and bigger than the main dish. The ice cream was also very heavy as I would have prefer something lighter like sherbet ice cream but with the Pre Fixie menu there's no option.",ZmS1Xv1TENZQGN6pFFFASg,0,0,5,5MAlpatAyYBOSUlPEFg2vg

But when my sister-in-law informed us that it had, none of us could pass up the opportunity. As long-standing dorks about the show, we were excited to get the chance to dine in a spot that Ramsay had cultivated in large part just for fans. We opted to go for lunch since it was a much more affordable way to participate in the experience. I must say that it sure delivered on fulfilling our dorky expectations. Ramsay has a knack for Vegas, and it shines in full force here.

The entire restaurant is staged to appeal to fans of the show. The exterior strongly resembles the restaurant in the show; they have a video recorded Gordon to greet you at the entrance; and the kitchen is visually split between red and blue ""teams,"" even if you know they are not actually competing. The host staff is all dressed in red with Hell's Kitchen pins, and the wait staff is extremely polite, knowledgable, and professional. 

We sat at a high-top table near the bar, which gave us a great view of all the action. Our waiter walked us through the menu, including sharing with us the fun and exciting food and drink specials. I couldn't help ordering the special cocktail (Smoke on the Boulevard) that tasted like a Manhattan but was served in a smoke-filled cage, giving it a hint of fire. We also tried the Note from Gordon, which was delicious and came with a cute, rolled-up ""note"" with a quote from the show. 

We tried quite a variety of the food on the menu between the three of us. My sister-in-law ordered the prix-fixe menu so that she would get to try her most desired dish--the beef wellington. She also opted for the wine pairing, and was very happy with everything she was served. My husband and I ordered off the standard menu. He got the scallops as an appetizer, and I chose the quinoa salad. The scallops were good but honestly were not as perfect as we might have hoped. In contrast, the quinoa salad was unexpectedly fresh and delicious, and ended up being one of the all-around favorite dishes of the day. My husband selected the salmon as an entree, which was beautiful and received positive reviews from the carnivores. I had fewer choices as a vegetarian, so I selected the wild mushroom pizza. My husband loved it and, since I was getting full, did a great deal to help me finish. For my taste, I felt that it was very, very fresh but possibly missing something. In their defense, however, I have a feeling that my waiter may have misheard my ""vegetarian"" as ""vegan"" and instructed the chefs to keep off the gouda. I sure didn't taste any on there. But even with what I did receive, the meal was very tasty. We all shared the sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious, though it was so huge that I'm not sure how anyone can eat it alone--we had trouble finishing it between the three of us. 

Overall, we had a really fun experience at Hell's Kitchen, and it delivered all of the kitsch and fun that we hoped it would. The meal wasn't perfect, but it was delicious, and I have no regrets. On the contrary, we had a blast, and it was such a fun experience to go. Definitely a playful, enjoyable opportunity for fans of the show.",9sAAD4WNzKcPZ02bkKv39w,2,2,4,ufn0RGWheOcSfmOfdT3Slw

First, the food is just fantastic! We ordered the Tuna Tartare, Lobster Risotto, Beef Wellington, Braised Short Rib and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. EVERYTHING but the braised short rib we would have ordered again that night....it was just superb! The short rib sadly was dry and we found everything else so top notch that it definitely stood out as the night's one and only dud. 

As an early season fan (sorry, haven't watched in years), it was so cool to feel like I was in the HK restaurant and to finally, FINALLY be able to taste Gordon's beef wellington and lobster risotto. The sticky toffee pudding was a perfect way to end a cold winter Las Vegas dinner! I loved it - it reminded me of a date cake with caramel sauce, so good! 

The let down for us as a dinner table was the lack of service from our server and for paying $27/glass per wine - having it spilt on the table and not wiped up. The table itself also wobbled and we found ourselves on numerous occasions having to grab our glasses if we moved or touched it. In addition, it went from our server pushing our dishes through hurriedly to completely absent at the end of the night. The gentleman who was refilling our water glasses should have been our server as he was extremely upbeat, helpful and polite.  

All in all, this was a fabulous dinner but service & facilities could have been better after we ""meditated"" on our $250 dinner tab; which is why there was only a 18% gratuity given and not 20%+ and why this review is 4 stars and not 5. 

Ultimately, will I be back to try again? Absolutely, 100% YES! Just I won't be purchasing wine and I will stick to bottled water.",c3F6Bi1odcAzO-0DGHhyMQ,1,0,4,pnrigBWtnaFjF4_uVv8RDQ

The lobster risotto was really good, the beef Wellington was good too, but a little difficult to eat because the dough didn't stick to the meat but other than that the cocktail I had was really good and the sticky toffee pudding was amazing and a huge portion! The service was good, however, our server kept forgetting drinks that my sister ordered, she ordered one Pepsi at the beginning of our meal and he completely forgot about it even after asking for it twice (and they weren't that busy) so she had to wait a long time then he forgot her espresso during dessert and by the time he realized  he was handing us the check so she told him to take it off the bill since she never received it. I don't recommend bringing young children here because there is no kids menu and again, the portions are small so sharing isn't really an option.

5140601,2018-03-31,2,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"This place is absolutely fantastic. I think it lives up to the Gordon Ramsey name and the Hell's Kitchen hype. 

My girlfriend and I came here to celebrate Valentines day and it was a great decision. We ordered a pre-fixe meal and additional food on the side as well. The pre-fixe menu came with scallops as the appetizer, beef Wellington for the entree and sticky toffee pudding as the dessert. We additionally ordered lobster risotto and Mac and cheese. The scallops were seared perfectly and they had just the right amount of seasoning. It was served with a celery slaw/salad sort of thing which paired greatly. Our entree was the Beef Wellington and it was definitely the highlight of the night. I'd been out on the hunt for beef Wellington for quite some time. I even tried making one on my own but nothing ever compared to this. Their beef was so tender and juice on the inside and the mushrooms and the jus and the puff pastry just all came together into tasty bites after tasty bites! The puree and roasted veggies also paired greatly with the protein. As for our additional dishes: the lobster in the risotto tasted extremely fresh. The Mac and cheese, however, was to die for. It tasted so rich and so cheesy but at the same time I felt myself reach for more and more. We had some leftover and that tasted better than some other 5 star Mac and cheeses. Their sticky toffee pudding was about the only thing that I didn't enjoy. It was way too sweet for me and my girlfriend. She's a sweet tooth and dessert queen but even she thought it was too poor sweet.

The 4 star rating comes from the fact that our meal ended up taking 2 hours because they were kind of slow on bring out our food. We had about 10-15 wait between dishes. I was a bit disappointed but the food made up for it.",3PiuCfNSeib3iCbn4eltnQ,1,1,4,FpcL-SLslHerSqbWCdu1Sw

I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go at..Hell's Kitchen! - Ariana Grande (one last time)

Full disclosure - I'm not a fanboy of his show but who hasn't heard of it and it's hard to ignore the hype when you see it from the outside at night. It really attracts people to want and try. I walked in on a weekday without a reservation thinking it wouldn't be difficult and to my surprise, they told me if I didn't have reservation for the day, they can make a reservation for me the next day. I took a quick scan around the restaurant in disbelief and while it was busy, it wasn't full. Note to self - marketing ploy. It wasn't a big deal because there's so many options to choose from and I'm a sucker for hype so we went to Bacchanal instead and returned here the next day. 

It was the same the next day when we returned - quite busy but enough empty tables that they could definitely accommodate more. We took some pictures since it was an open kitchen and decor is still new since they opened in January. 

Food wise, I had to order the Hell's Kitchen burger for obvious reasons. The waitress said it was really spicy but I've been eating more spicy foods recently so I was up for the challenge. It had a kick to the burger but wasn't as bad as she made it out to be. Pretty good size and filled me up. I wouldn't say it was memorable but the decor of the restaurant I'm sure would please the fans of the show. Overall it was a pleasant meal - I had no expectations since I don't watch the show but it's good to have a place like this in Vegas.",1rlB-SWvDU5TnDnym2qeDw,2,2,4,W0UjNYt9H1fpmrKDBYufqA
5144632,2018-03-04,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Even though I've had his Wellington a million times at Ramsay Steak, the Prix Fix menu was a hard bargain to pass up. Plus, the menu was pretty bleak; lamb, chicken and various steaks.

The issue came because of the brilliance of offering seafood within the appetizers, and I'm allergic to seafood. My friend had no problem with the scallops, as only a moron would choose a Caesar salad instead. That would be me. However, I couldn't have either, as there's anchovy in the dressing. Considering the seared foie gras dish was comparable, other than $3 more, I asked if she could see if they could substitute instead. She returns and says the manager refuses to allow that and she sincerely apologized. I gave her my gratitude and told her not to worry about it, as it's not her call. We ask for the check and leave.

Now, it's not my place to tell anyone operator how to run his business. I mean, taking a $3 hit so I could make over $300 in sales seems like a no brainer to me. However, I am a patron that was discriminated upon because I had an allergy. I know the manager wasn't concerned about earning my business or creating a memorable experience. Having met Chef Ramsay, I know he'd feel guilty about that oversight, take care of his guests and correct the issue moving forward. But hey, that's why this is named after a TV show and his restaurant in Paris bares his name.",DNudacpzb0iRmV8XeI4Zmg,0,0,1,6djIHGKuFEaTbC4d82BR3A

We each ordered the Notes from Gordon drink which was perfect, sweet but not too sweet, and the way they utilize green tea to reduce the juniper hit from the gin made it easy to drink and relax. We utilized the prix fixe menu as it has the highlights from the show, pan seared scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding. The scallops were just a touch of crispness followed but a melt in your mouth perfectly cooked scallop. The beef Wellington is so tender it can be cut easily with a butter knife and the demi glace was a perfect complement to the dish. The pudding was moist, the ice cream was sweet and salty and I'm still thinking about it. Overall, all other food is now ruined because it will never be as delicious as the food at Hell's Kitchen. Now I understand why chef Ramsay is always yelling about how the food is cooked. Once it's done perfectly you'll dream about it!

We were fortunate to be seated toward the back, away from the entrance and near the floor-to-ceiling walls of glass overlooking the strip. Jaw-droppingly beautiful. Service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly. It was a nice meal, but nothing really wowed us. Maybe a case of too-high expectations, but there you go. We shared the smoked beet salad. Attractively presented under a glass dome that contained the smoke. It was a nice salad, but we felt the golden beets were overwhelmed by the smoke and other elements. I had the filet mignon. It was good, but not great - I felt like it was a bit lacking in beef flavor. David enjoyed his short ribs, served over polenta, more. Neither of us felt like the roasted tomatoes on our plates added much. The side of roasted cauliflower that we shared, however, was very good. For dessert we shared a chocolate mousse cake, and it was a letdown, both the somewhat dry cake and the too-strong passion fruit gelato that didn't seem the right accompaniment. Don't get me wrong, we had a very nice meal, but for a restaurant of this caliber, I was hoping for even better.",xJDb2X2pxTuH343MW-DVGg,0,0,3,C1ILkV8OqV7DbM_zPlYJ-Q

I ordered the pre-fix menu which includes the seared scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. Each and every single bite was perfect. The scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned and tasted amazing. The beef wellington was the star of the show. The presentation was perfect, the temperature was spot on, the seasoning was exactly the way it should be as to not overpower the steak. It was the best steak I have ever eaten...and i have been to A LOT of expensive steakhouses. 

The atmosphere feels just like the Hell's Kitchen show and they even call the chefs blue team and red team so you feel the authenticity of the experience. The interior decor is perfect - from the silverware to the napkins everything is high quality and expertly thought out. 

The service is the best. Our water was constantly filled and every request was met with a smile and genuine kindness! We couldn't finish our dessert and asked for it to go and they even included plastic forks/spoons in our bag knowing we probably didn't have any at our hotel. So thoughtful. 

Every tiny detail is incredibly well thought out and executed. From the food, drinks, decor, and atmosphere this restaurant has it mastered. Yes, it is expensive, but YES it is worth it.  If you can afford it, you MUST try.",f-qxZDVp1jZ-Rb0jOUrYmA,5,4,5,TGNuo5DMGxFZF9eKCGDrEw

Details everywhere.  Gold plated cutlery, embroidered HK napkins, a funky GM straight out of central casting complete with facial metal and glorious pompadour.   Even the Chef is last seasons winner and more than happy to take a picture.  Just opened so staff is a bit raw but willing.   In 6 more months they too will become a service machine.

 Visited Gordon Ramsay's newest Vegas installment for dinner while in town two weeks ago and I can say it was, hands down, one of the finest meals I've ever eaten not just in Vegas but anywhere.
 There was so much anticipation leading up to this dinner, all of his other Vegas restaurants have left me pleased and happy and I was expecting this one to live up to those same standards. The reservation was for 9:45. I showed up at 9:30 and was very pleased to be seated a full 10 minutes early. Thank goodness too because the bar where I had planned on waiting until my table was ready was totally packed.
 My server, F-ing John F (insert Ramsay inflection here), was amazing! Every need was attended to before I knew that I needed anything, he was warm and personable, prompt and swift. If you want ridiculously good service, do yourself a favor and just ask to be served by F-ing John F. Attention to detail allows Hell's Kitchen to run like a smoothly choreographed performance that looks nearly effortless. Judging on the quality of the food, it is anything but effortless.
 I chose the prefixe menu with the scallops, Wellington and sticky toffee pudding. In addition I was served an amuse bouche of goat cheese and watermelon with black pepper that was both surprising as well as delicious. The Wellington was cook to perfect mid-rare. The pastry was neither dry nor greasy, it was also perfect. The potato puree the Wellie rested upon was probably made by angels because it was simply divine. By the time the dessert had arrived, all hot and gooey with it's perfect cannelle of fresh ice cream like a fat little crown on top, gluttony grabbed me by the taste buds once again. Over and over from course 1 right on through course 4. Unfreakinbelievable. 
 F-ing John F talked me into three shots of the most amazing espresso in Vegas ( I have almost come down from the caffeine buzz 2 weeks later! )
 If you are in Vegas and don't eat at Hell's Kitchen, you don't know what you are missing. 10 thumbs up

Our server was apologetic, but still it was pretty bad. There wasn't any kind of bread of anything either, so we were both getting pretty hangry. Once our entrees came out, they were both so good. The Wellington was perfectly cooked and his Mac and cheese was filling on its own. We waited about another 20 minutes after we finished for our dessert (sticky toffee pudding was also really good) and another 10 minutes after that to get our check. In total, we were there for around 2 1/2 hours. We had plans with friends we had to cancel because we weren't going to make it in time, so that sucked. Overall, the food was amazing and so was the service, but the waits were unacceptable.",XWy8zXcRAm4NTSinKCtbNw,0,0,4,Ay9RI8r1V6pVTcIPbEtlLA

Red team and blue team cooking just like the show. The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff's service was superb. Reservations are highly recommended.

The pan seared scallop appetizer was very delicious and fresh. I highly recommend the beef Wellington. It was very soft and tender. The potatoe puree, glazed veggies, and red wine sauce were a very good touch. My husband ordered the crispy skin salmon, and that was amazing as well. It was cooked very well. The skin was very crisp and the fish was not dry at all. You could cut it gently with a fork.

We were really full from the dinner portions and did not have room for dessert, but I would also like to comment on the drinks we ordered. I had the watermelon mocktail and it was very sweet but refreshing. My husband ordered the rim donkey. FYI, push the flame passion fruit into the drink fast with the straw. My husband struggled a bit with this and set his first straw on fire. The straw of course melted :D, and he had to get another one.

It was absolutely fun and delicious!! restaurant. I had the New York strip which was the best steak I have ever had. It melted in my mouth and the quality of the meat was unparalleled.

We shared the side dishes of cauliflower, Mac and cheese and mushrooms. The cauliflower was incredibly irresistible!! My friends had the Beef Wellington and all remarked it was beyond their expectations. Everyone shared the sticky toffee dessert another must have.

5253602,2018-05-01,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"WHAT A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  The food was terrible lacking any flavour and portions were small and pretentious.  My fiancee and I ate dinner here to celebrate my birthday.   I am a big fan of the show and was incredibly excited to eat here.  After reading other Yelp reviews, I had high expectations.  So I am wondering if we were unlucky and had an usual bad experience or if Yelp reviewers are overly generous in their reviews.  I'm not overly picky but after paying a bill of $250 for our meal which included only one drink amongst the two of us (a gin and tonic cocktail cost $28!!) and two appetizers and two main entrees with three sides which were an extra charge for each.  For my appetizer, I ordered the smoked beet salad; and when it arrived at our table, it salad was encompassed in a glass dome.  When our server took the lid off the dome, the smoke in the dome was released.  Great presentation, but that's about it.  The whole beet salad which was probably a few mouthfuls in total totally tasted like smoke and I couldn't taste anything else.  My fiancee ordered the red quinoa salad which I tasted and as average.  For my main entree, I ordered the filet mignon and asked for it to be medium rare.  It was inedible.  It was definitely more like well done.  I should have sent it back especially considering this cost $47.  It was so tough and flavourless and I had to gnaw each bite. The worst filet mignon that I have ever had in my life.  My fiancee also ordered the filet mignon and had the same experience as me.  He also asked for medium rare and instead received well done. How hard it is to get the meat right?  The sides were ordered were brussel sprouts, wild mushrooms and roasted cauliflower.  Each side cost $9 extra.  Nothing to rave about, but I liked the wild mushrooms the best.  Normally I would have eaten the entire portion of each side; but this time, I left some portion of each entree.  Because it was my birthday dinner, I received a complimentary sticky toffee pudding for desert.  This was probably the only decent food we ate during dinner.  
The service was decent.  I had made reservations on-line and when we arrived we were seated in a very timely manner.  Our server was good and very personable.  No complaints here.
All in all, I would never eat here again. All hype -- overpriced, small portions and quality of food was lacking in any flavour.  
I keep on reading positive reviews for this restaurant, so I have to wonder if our experience was just bad luck or if everyone else who eats here is generous in their reviews.",gRx4LDUUzAYfK98D99FijA,1,1,1,szIJjVgHQZ-qbjuJa5XfsA

We both selected the three course lunch menu and could not have been happier. The salad and soup pairing were great, but the beef wellington was incredible. Rounding out the meal, the sticky toffee pudding was a perfect way to end the meal.

It was really an incredible experience getting the chance to eat the entree you see made so right and so wrong on Hell's Kitchen in a themed restaurant that captures the spirit of the show so well.

Our only issue with the while experience stemmed from what I consider a mark of a quality establishment. We failed to plan ahead accordingly with dinner reservations, so we had to settle with a lunch reservation.

There's an open kitchen, just like in the show, with a team of red and blue chefs (for fun, obviously). Since it's new, I'm guessing it's always pretty tough to get a reservation, but we went in and found a place at the bar. I think the menu might be different from the restaurant, but still lots of great food!

Food as amazing. We got the scallops, meatballs, and lobster risotto - all were YUM! My wife got the sticky toffee pudding, which I didn't partake in, but am told it was amazing!

The only reason I'm giving a 4 is due to our initial impression when trying to find a seat at the bar. We were told we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we found a hightop and sat down. After being sat there for a few minutes, one of the servers came by and told us we could not sit there, which was fine! His delivery was a bit to be desired, though... something along the lines of ""why would you think you can sit here? this table is dirty"" Ok, so we moved to the bar where there were 2 seats open, but not next to each other. We politely asked a couple to move down a seat so the 2 seats were together. They were super friendly and agreed (they even bought us a drink after, for some reason!). As soon as we sat down, though, the bartender basically scolded us for not telling him to tell them to move down. He quite sternly ""educated"" us the proper procedure at a bar is always to ask the bartender. Is that true? 

Anyhow, other than some not-so-friendly staff, the place was great. Definitely make it a point to try it out, and maybe before a ton of adult beverages so you can enjoy the wonderful food!",ihKIv3lo8IFz7O-djya-fQ,2,0,4,3FFz1s28w-AVr29mVU1wug

Walked in and asked about walk-in dining as I tried to make reservations and there were none available. She said they don't do walk-in's but the dining room wasn't even close to being full. She then told us the ""bar area"" is opening seating. So we sat down at the high-tops at the bar, however a few short minutes later the manager comes up and says there must have been a mix up as the high-tops in the bar are apart of the dining area?

So we move to the bar, but of course having someone under the age of 21 we aren't allowed there either. The bartender Kat (I hope I got her name right) was amazing, talked to the manager again and explained the situation. She was able to get them to seat us in the dinning room if we just wait near the hostess stand. We start to walk up and the dumb hostess thanks us for visiting. Uh, did you just forget the conversation you just had with Kat and the manager 30 seconds ago. She looks dumbfounded when I tell her we were just told to wait for a table. They seat us immediately! So much for being completely booked.

Now the meal, absolutely amazing and the wait staff was on point. Barbra was our waitress and just the best! I will only eat here when she is here. She gave us pointers on what to get though we pretty much knew what we wanted. She and Kat are what made the experience and meal 5-stars.

Once we were settled into our chairs, our server greeted us with the concept of Hell's Kitchen. Kerry was warm and very knowledgeable. We ordered drinks and Cris was quick to pour water.

As for cocktails, the Notes From Gordon and Smoke on the Boulevard, are the way to go. My husband loved the refreshing aspect of the NFG. He usually dislikes green tea, yet loved it. The Smoke is my go to. Similar to a Boulevardiere, it is smoked using cherry wood. 

We placed in our appetizers and everything was superb. I loved how every dish was dropped with an explanation. We got the wagyu meatballs, lobster risotto, smoked golden beets salad, tuna tartare, and seared foie gras. My mom and dad loved the risotto and tuna tartare. My husband gravitated to the meatballs and beet salad. We all agreed the foie was decadent and perfect. All great choices.

For our main courses: my parents both got the signature Beef Wellington. My husband, the NY Strip. I ordered the Rack of Lamb. For side dishes: we ordered mac and cheese, potato gratin, sugar snap peas, and roasted cauliflower. There was not a dish we did not enjoy. We ended up packing some of our dishes to go.

Opulence is the word to describe our dessert service. We received the Peanut Butter Fudge Cheesecake, Pineapple Carpaccio, Chocolate Mouse Cake, and the signature Sticky Toffee Pudding.

We were seated towards the back of the restaurant along the glass with a beautiful view of the strip. There are tv's along the wall, that are playing different seasons of the tv show. Our server Christopher was wonderful, he was so attentive and even asked if we were fans of the show? He let us know that Chef Michelle was working the line and we were more than welcome to ask for a picture with her. He recommended several dishes from appetizers to entrees, to a pre-fixed menu as well. He was the best, he even said happy birthday to me and thanked me for celebrating my birthday at the restaurant. I decided to go with the pre-fix menu which was pan seared scallops and the beef Wellington and a perfect pudding cake desert. My husband ordered the lobster risotto and the rack of lamb that was recommended by our server Christopher. The scallops were perfectly seared with a pea purée under each scallop, which was so delicious. The lobster risotto was cooked to perfection, the lobster was so tender and full of flavor.  The beef Wellington is cooked medium rare and comes with a potato purée and carrots. The meat was so tender, the dough had this crispy/ flaky layer that just melted in your mouth! The rack of lamb was also cooked medium rare, and you are given 3 chops. It comes with a carrot/curry purée, it compliments well with the lamb, but not a big fan of the curry. When it came time for dessert, they gave us a complimentary birthday candle on top of the most amazing ice cream I have ever tasted. It was a scoop of ice cream made of gingerbread and caramel on top of a toffee pudding cake that just melts in your mouth after every bite! We were very pleased with this place! The quality of food exceeded our expectations, and we didn't feel like we over payed for our meal. It's truly a great experience and we can't wait to go back!",xFfGeGL0VBoKrFtM-gE7TQ,0,0,5,dRimynwq0zd5nEupgcFH2Q

We ordered a number of the key menu items.

The set meal of Pumpkin Soup, Beef Wellington, and Sticky Toffee Pudding was pretty good but pricey.  Pumpkin soup was very good, I don't think you can get that just anywhere.  The Beef Wellington was pretty good but it didn't blow me away.  I can't believe I'm going to say this but the Sticky Toffee Pudding was awesome, I loved it.  This is an amazing dessert and I'm not normally a dessert person.

Lobster risotto was rich and good chunks of lobster but it could have been a slightly larger serving.

We also had an order of burgers and fries which was nothing special.

There was also another dessert with dry ice that was quite the spectacle and was fun to order.

Service was super excellent, I can tell something they must have invested a lot of training into.

5401106,2018-04-09,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"We came on a Sunday evening:
Appetizers:
1) Lobster risotto: absolutely delicious! Made for just 1 person. I am not a fan of lobster, yet the lobster tail in there was good but the risotto was outstanding so I would order this again. (I would make this an entree. Too little risotto which was sad).
2) scallops: 5 of them, on the small side, they were good. I thought they were just okay and have had better, but my friend liked them. I would not order this again.
Salad:
1) golden beet salad with yogurt and pistachios, etc: I expected more. My friend liked it, and I thought it was okay. I wanted more acidity for the beets... I found it too sweet and underwhelming. I would not order it again. 
Entrees:
1) My friend and I both ordered the crispy skin salmon. It was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I would probably order it again if I came here as one of the only choices in entrees I was drawn too. 
Dessert: 
1) we ordered the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream on top: yummy and not as heavy as I thought it would be. I guess I would order it again if I came again after seeing dessert menu options. 
2) Drip coffee: great coffee! I would order it again. 
Wine
1) they were out of the Chardonnay we wanted (bottle). We got another bottle. The Chardonnay was okay. I would not order it again. 

Service: great service! Friendly, helpful, welcoming. 
Ambience: we had a reservation and it was for a birthday, specified in the reservation. We were not by the window. I was facing the bar and it felt more like a New York deli than a high end restaurant, and it was way too loud to feel relaxed. 
Price: without tax, for all ordered, without tip: around $271.00. Not cheap. ( this included a free birthday dessert). 
So would I come here again? I am a local, so the answer is probably no. It was good, yet far from outstanding. Maybe the hype and popularity of the advertisement for Hell's Kitchen had me expecting way too much, yet I do not think so. I am sure many people are excited to be there because of the show and the chef and the fame related to both. There are way too many other places in Las Vegas with the same price range with way better food and options, and way better ambience.
Still, I am glad I tried it as the hype has been sorely lessened for me. 
The restaurant is decent, yet nothing to write home about in my book.
I am giving this restaurant 3 1/2 stars. This is why I chose to give it three stars. It is expensive. The reputation, in terms of advertisement and the show, is expected to be flawless or pretty darn amazing. That was not the case. The ambience of the restaurant is way too loud and too informal. Overall, just not impressed. Very disappointed as I expected a lot more. I judge restaurants by whether I would return or not. I simply would not choose to come back here. It was just OK, which signifies three stars.
One final point to add is the following: if you are hungry, get appetizers or salad to begin with. There is no bread that comes to your table, no crackers, nothing at the beginning, nor an amuse bouche. Therefore, if you do not feel like waiting for your entrée because you're quite hungry, the appetizers come to the table quickly. 
As for dress code, there were many people dressed informally as in jeans and T-shirt.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,2,0,3,gGOh73m-h2SZMSUBI-Vcxw

The lunch started off with out server explaining the menu and highlighting the different options taken from the show, Hells Kitchen. 

Once we all decided to do the express lunch with wine pairing, everything stared flowing. 

The first course, I chose the pumpkin soup at the suggestion of our server. It was paired with a light delicious wine. If you look at the pictures, the plate came without soup but was gorgeous and the server poured the hot soup into the bowl once we saw the presentation. Omgoshhhh did it taste delicious and the pepitas and sausage that was garnished, made the soup! I've never really had pumpkin soup but if it all tastes like that, sign me up for more. 

The second course, Beef Wellington, to die for. If you watch the show you hear Gordon Ramsey yell about how he wants it cooked correctly, now I see why. The beef is wrapped in prosciutto them wrapped in pastry. That meat cut so easily and was so tender, it was amazing. The plate had potato purée and a few veggies and those were just as delicious with the demi-glacé. The wine pairing for this entree was delicious as well and I do not enjoy red wines.

The last course, the sticky toffee pudding, can I say holy crap? We were poured a glass of port wine to pair with this dessert and not a single person at the table was able to finish the desert. It was delicious and rich and everything I didn't think it would be. I really had no idea what toffee pudding would look or taste like that. Yumm! 

All in all, the wine pairing was delicious and mixed well with the foods they suggested with it. The pours were not small in any way and the food was everything I expected and more.

HK is everything you would expect this new Gordon Ramsey addition to the Vegas strip to be. The attention to detail is the main dining room is pretty awesome. Never thought I'd fall in love with pitchforks  but the subtle way they're incorporated in the overall design is pretty neat. The dining room is very large with great views of either the strip or the open kitchen. The bar is located in the front and easily accessible.

Service
My service was exceptional. Bernice was very attentive, friendly and her suggestion and description of the lobster risotto was spot on. It was by far my favorite dish in a lunch service of winners. 

Food
I went with the Cesar Salad, Lobster Risotto, Beef Wellington and Toffee Pudding. All were as good as they look in the pics. The highlights were the risotto and toffee pudding. Both were prepared to perfection. If you're a fan of the show then you're familiar with the risotto and beef 
Wellington. Trust me there is a reason why he hammers the chefs if they don't perfect these dishes. I'm pretty much a fan of Gordon Ramsey concepts in Vegas. This latest installment on the strip in the former Serendipity location does not disappoint.

We managed to get lunch reservations last minute.  Maybe that is why they sat us at bar tops instead of a regular table.  Don't know.  We got there early, were sat promptly but this is about when the promptness stops.  We ordered simple lunches.  Mushroom pizza and the lobster risotto.  To start with, we ordered the scallops appetizer.  

We mentioned to the server hubby is attending a conference and short on lunch time as we were sat.  She said no problem.  We immediately placed our order for everything and the appetizer came out 10 minutes or so later.  Sadly, the scallops were the smallest, thinnest scallops I'd ever seen.  They seriously have to have been cut in half because I never saw scallops this size before.  Also, they were overcooked.  Because they were so thin they didn't need to be cooked long, but they were so mine was a tad rubbery - even given the thinness of the scallop.  

Disappointment didn't stop there... because it was now 10... 20.... 30.... 40.... 50 minutes more of a wait til we got our lunch.  Server stops by a few times to say not sure it will to be too much longer.  After a couple of times, she stopped coming by completely.   Hubby finally looks at his watch... yeah.... I gotta go back he says.  He leaves.  (This was his birthday lunch mind you).  He has to go back to his training class MINUS food- oh except for  the 1 1/2 scallops he got to eat.  

Food comes out almost an hour to the time we were there.  
They bring it out and I ask her to just wrap it up since husband left already.  Pizza looked ok, tasted ok back in the room at the Bellagio.  Unfortunately a little soggy since it was packed in a plastic container too. 
 Thats partly my fault though since I didn't want to sit there and eat two meals by myself.  However, nothing amazing I couldn't get at a local pizzeria.  Risotto tastes like its undercooked... WTF... 

All in all, yes, its a tourist trap, I knew it was.  BUT I figured it would still be tasty.  It wasn't worth the $80+ we spent on lunch to have a few sparse scallops and to eat really nothing else.",pVYMW4TVpvsnUqQBgIjCEg,4,2,2,8te1IlA_wUraP864HjH_mw

When we arrived at 5 there was no queue at the door but the place was already quite packed with people.  We were seated in the area far back from the actual kitchen pass line so it had a hint of privacy. 

For dinner we opted to order the Prix Fixe menu with wine pairings then ordered separate items just to try them out then shared it all.  

Prix Fixe:  Pan seared scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding. 
Other items:  Foie gras, crispy skin salmon, side of wild mushrooms

Drink: started with ""Notes from Gordon""- Gin, green tea, lemongrass, peach, lemon and a printed quirky quote from Gordon - super yummy, poured at the right strength.  It took awhile for this drink to come out from the bar but our waiter did come by to inform us about its status and apologized for the wait. 

Prix Fixe is a must get for all the Gordon Ramsay faves.  The scallops were done really well, the beef Wellington was deceptively filling and the dessert was on point.  The foie gras was interesting cause it came paired with a carrot cake but the way that the salmon was done was perfect for me sitting in between a piece of sashimi and cooked.  However that may put off tastebuds used to ""well done"" fish.    The wild mushroom side that our waiter raved about was a fantastic recommendation.  

Service was quite impressive the wait staff were well coordinated providing plenty of top ups of water, coming around sparingly to check on us during our date and super nice right till the end.

Little tip, if you want to go for dinner or eat from the dinner menu, but it is booked, make a reservation for lunch around 3 or 3:30 as they switch menus at 3:30. 
J: I ordered the signature, which means I got the scallops, beef wellington, and the dessert (sticky toffee pudding). The scallops were cooked perfectly, but were barely warm. Did not care that much for the pea puree, but the bacon bits were a good add on. Beef wellington was simply delicious, lived up to all the hype from watching Gordon Ramsay's shows. But surprisingly, the best part was the sticky toffee pudding. It is larger than what you would expect from a high end restaurant, but still did not come with enough. The combination of ice cream and toffee with the soft pudding was to die for.
N: Being pescatarian, I was actually interested in getting the LOBSTER wellington, since I've seen it so much on the show, sadly to only notice that salmon was the only seafood option under entrees. BUT, I was definitely not disappointed when the citrus flavored salmon arrived and was cooked beautifully. The flavor was not too overpowering - literally perfection! I also ordered Potato Gratin as a side, which was really TASTY, I just wish it was more cheesier. I also definitely can not get over how BOMB the sticky toffee pudding was- WOW, I'm a dessert enthusiast and that was honestly one of my favorites ever!!",p5ItVUQDdKS5uWniVFeZsA,0,0,5,a2mODeehJczvmvGJ1s8t5w

We made reservations on Open Table. Upon arrival, we were seated immediately.  Our server was Megan.  She was very knowledgeable and took good care of us. 

We started with the scallops and the avocado toast.  Both were off the charts great.  I wanted to lick the plates.  Then our group had the margarita pizza (very good), the short ribs (also very good), the short rib grilled cheese (very flavorful) and the Hell's Kitchen burger (the most amazing burger I have ever had).  I gave my husband 1/2 of my burger in exchange for his short ribs.  What a mistake.  While the short ribs are good, it simply did not compare to the flavorful burger.

We couldn't help but have dessert.  In my opinion, this is where they fell short.  We had the peanut butter cheesecake (it was ok but I thought it was skimpy given the $9 price tag), the sticky toffee (this did nothing for me but others at my table really enjoyed it), and the chocolate mousse (some complicated flavors - it was good but not great).  I was bummed that the desserts were not stronger, but honestly the rest of our food was so amazing, I won't deduct a star.  

We are only in Vegas for a few days, but I'm hoping we have the opportunity to go back for another meal.  It's not cheap, but most items were well worth their price.",QyjTjUwOXbr5KJUrKL53Bw,0,0,5,Cr2ZeimhqN5lvhIpyvKK7g

From the moment we walked up and saw the giant pitchfork outside and a screen of chef Ramsay inviting us in, we knew we were going to be in for a treat!

My sister and I walked in and were almost immediately greeted by a host who welcomed us up to check in for our table. We were seated promptly and our host pointed out the special aestethic features of the restaurant. 

We were greeted by or waited, David (tall, glasses, goatee) almost as soon as we sat down and were presented menus. He went over the menu with us in detail (even though we already knew what we wanted to order). He answered all of our questions and even offered to introduce us to chef Michelle!

I ordered the Agua Fresca and my sister ordered a Manhattan, both drinks were delicious! For food we ordered: HK Caesar salad, scampi prawn flambé (they flambé it tableside!!), beef Wellington, short rib, side of Mac and cheese, side of cauliflower, sticky toffee pudding, and peanut butter fudge cheesecake. 

Food was amazing and came out on time! We were welcomed during our meal and checked up on by their management team throughout service. 

To finish our experience, we met chef Michelle and got a picture with her. Absolutely amazing experience from start to finish, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this restaurant and experience to anyone who loves great food with better service, and especially those who are fans of Chef Ramsay and Hell's Kitchen!

The restaurant itself is truly stunning! From the windows to the walls!! And not to mention the floor tile! Stunning!

Our servers Chris & Chris we're exceptional and on point. Chris brought out wines that would go well with each of our meals which was very welcoming! 

The Wagyu meatballs were super and you should order two! The Red Quinoa Salad was also another palate opener and something that can be created at home. The scallops were done perfectly with the prix fix menu!  

We were originally going to get the tomahawk for two, but saw that Beef Wellington and nixed that idea. The Beef Wellington and Filet Mignon were stunning, but could have been epic!!! 

They both could have been epic with a warm/hot plate so I could have peacefully chewed my food before it getting lukewarm. I know Ruth Chris is known for this and Hell's Kitchen should take note to kill the competition!

Food was very well prepared and our server was very knowledgeable about all the food and drink options on the menu. 
One person in our group had the prix fixe menu with the Caesar salad, beef Wellington, and sticky toffee pudding and was very satisfied with the quality and amount of food. Other items tried: 
-Tuna tartare- I loved this appetizer! Tuna was great quality and the marinade was tangy and delicious
-Shrimp cocktail- pretty big sized shrimp and was seasoned very well, seemed like a pretty average shrimp cocktail 
-Crispy skinned salmon- this was my personal favorite plate of the night. The salmon was delicious and the sauce that was underneath converging the lentils was so refreshing, I couldn't get enough of it 
-Beef Wellington- very good but also very rich and heavy. I personally preferred the salmon, but really just because the salmon was lighter and tasted a little brighter imo. 

And For dessert: 
-Sticky toffee pudding- fits the delicious description of all other reviews! The speculoos ice cream was a perfect addition! 
-Pineapple carpaccio- really cool presentation and really yummy, feel to the side when compared with the sticky toffee pudding, but if you want a light fruity dessert, I would definitely recommend this",UyPiXCINqXSCcvzYuVon4A,0,0,4,LSAtT6pcoX-zRgsMyky2_Q
5536153,2018-01-31,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Came here on a Sunday night without a reservation but we were still seated at a reasonable time. I was sort of bummed that the menu featured on Yelp lists a foie gras appetizer that was not actually on the menu. Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, Ramsay and what fans of his would be interested in, etc. and made recommendations without taking up too much time or being pushy.

I had the rack of lamb and the potato gratin side and both were very good. The spinach that accompanied it was also tasty and not over cooked which I think is typical at many restaurants. My friend got the prix fixe menu (scallops, beef Wellington, sticky toffee pudding). I am so happy she shared her first course with me because it was perfect, but also our main dishes took FOREVER to come out. 

Our server (I think his name was Greg) and the manager were very apologetic and provided updates about our food and tried to make it right. I think our ticket may have gotten ""lost"" because we saw a few tables seated after us get their food before us and leave before we even got our food. 

Our server asked us at the beginning if we had any time constraints and we had said no because it was only shortly after 7pm when we were seated and the show we had tickets for only a mile down the strip didn't start until 9:30 (we barely made it). I felt bad for the people who accompanied us at our table because they only ordered a salad and macaroni and cheese and it took a FULL HOUR for it all to arrive. (It's also an open kitchen so which is very entertaining if you're fans of the show.)

Because the wait was so long, our server checked again about whether we had to be anywhere which was appreciated and our food was boxed up and our checks brought to us very quickly.

5568037,2018-02-28,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Ok, so I have to say I was not as amazed with the food in this establishment as I was hoping. While we were in Las Vegas we ate at the Aria buffet, Bellagio buffet and Hell's Kitchen. I would rate the order 1. Aria 2. Bellagio and 3. Hell's Kitchen.
With that being said I'm not saying I didn't like Hells Kitchen. We had a great table right where we could watch all the food prep going on. I would recommend one of these tables over the strip view if you go but that's just my opinion. So we had reviewed the menu choices before we went and I had the Prix Fix menu which included scallops as the appetizer, followed by the famous Beef Wellington and than a Toffee Pudding. My wife had the Lobster Risotto appetizer and Crispy Salmon main course.
The appetizers were just ok. The scallops had to much of a bacon taste which took away from the butteriness. The risotto was good but kind of a strange texture to the risotto and fairly bland. I was expecting to be blown away but started off just average. Next was the Beef Wellington. The meat was tender but not as tasty as I was hoping. Again it was good but not great. My wife's Salmon was very good and the Mashed Potatoes were decent. Finally the desert which was a home run. It tastes way better than it looks in pictures although it would have been even better with 2 scoops of ice cream.
Our waiter was French and was ok but not great just like the food. He was semi involved with our table while being very involved with the 2 tables surrounding us. He seemed to want us to get 2 deserts but when we only wanted one he kind of marched away from the table. He just gave me a strange feeling like we were irritating him and he seemed irritated when we asked him if he could take a picture of us at the end of our meal and did not make eye contact with me after that.
We are not drinkers so our bill came to $165 and we tipped $25 so $190. I would have been ok spending even more than this if everything was better than good but unfortunately it wasn't.

We went to the bar and ordered 2 drinks. Bartender was nice. We surveyed the area and there were surprisingly a lot of empty tables. Anywhere between 7-8.

Beef Wellington
Everything was delicious....just like I hoped for and imagined. The service was very good considering it was very busy. The chef and winner  Michelle Tribble was very gracious and let me pose for a picture with her. As with most things in Vegas it is quite expensive considering the size of the portions.

5648973,2018-04-14,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"For the TL/DR crowd: serious service failure and just over mediocre meals disappointed.

We were in town for the NAB convention and had dined at BurGR, Raku, Yardbird and then dined @ Hell's Kitchen (hereinafter HK).  We had reservations for 1945 on a Wednesday.  The greeters located the reservation and suggested that they were running 10-20 minutes late.  OK -- given the high yelp ratings and crowd in the lobby, we can believe that.

Long story shortened, around 2105, we see a group of 6 that had arrived a half hour later than we had get seated, with one greeter telling the other that ""Manny had taken care of it.""  It did seem that Manny had some rapport with the folks, but the other half was having none if it... got Manny's attention with some active finger waggling and a quick inquiry about failed queuing and, mirabile dictu, got promised a table close to the kitchen (it wasn't, it turned out) and free drinks to try to smooth things over (decent gesture, that's why  two stars, not one).  Note to reception... never let people see or hear what's really going on... it just stirs the hive and angers the bees.

Wait staff was efficient and attentive, orders were taken and food appeared in a timely fashion thereafter.  Some of us opted for the Prix fixe menu.  My scallops were thin (I get it -- 5 full sized scallops is more of a main and they take longer to sear, cut 'em in half!).  Sadly, that makes them a lot easier to get a bit on the over done side.  The flavor was quite good (in the US sense; not the UK pejorative use).  My Wellington was big... bigger than it needed to be, but it's temperature profile (not the done-ness) says it was being punched out in a production line and sitting under a heat lamp.  

The other half got the pumpkin soup and declared it to be insanely rich.  Her meatballs were tasty, but had too much tomato sauce to meat ratio for her taste (N.B.: as a comparison point, she suggests comparing to the ""kick-ass meat loaf"" at Brenda's Meat & 3 in SF).  

We shared some of the sticky pudding dessert and both concluded it was tooth-achingly sweet.  All three of these ordered at our table went back half eaten (amongst 6 people)... not a good consumption ratio.",jEyFBus5bV_31_sKmkbhBQ,0,0,2,ZSZIrShSDtg6pR6ZrwgsHw

The unfortunate reason I gave a 3-Star instead of a 5-Star review was simply because the host seated us in a very poor location. I specifically requested a table with a view of the kitchen as we are huge Hell's Kitchen/ Gordon Ramsay fans. Yes, we went for the food but also for the experience. We were escorted and sat at a table in the rear with no view of the kitchen. If the restaurant was full I could understand, but well over half of the main dining area that had a good kitchen view was completely empty. I even specified on our reservation through open table I wanted a table with a view of the kitchen, and would have even waited an hour or two to get a good spot if needed. But the dining room was over half empty. I don't get it... either the ladies in red were incompetent or simply just did not care. Either way, shame on them. Great food though!

We ordered the Scampi Prawn Flambé and it came on a little stone and they flambéed it right in front of us. It was so delicious. Matt ordered the famous Wellington and it was perfect! I had the filet mignon which was good...next time I'll go out of my comfort zone! We didn't wait long for our food and our server was so attentive! Drinks were anticlimactic...I had the woooooorst mojito ever...it was so strong I couldn't drink it and it was in a regular water cup you get at your grandmas house...and for $20+ I'd expect it to be superb.

A few of my friends were not too impressed with their entrees (pizza, lobster risotto, and the beef Wellington), but did enjoy them! A straight 4 out of 5 stars on behalf of their entrees in which I tried as well. The entrees just needed more flavor and more of a ""wow"" factor in order to live up to its name.

I made reservations on another site and when we showed up, about 5 min early, they were just setting the table up, and so I went to the bar to grab a beer. They have a beer only available at the restaurant from Stone Brewery, who I love, so we were off to a strong start

Got seated promptly and server was right on it with waters, check to make sure we didnt have a tab at the bar to close out, and then left us to study the menus....and there were a ton of choices!! I opted for the 3 course pre-fix menu, because it had all the GR staples, my buddy went with the braised short rib and mac n cheese.

We had another beer and then food was on the tabe, perfect timing. Scallops were everything you see on the show, when things go right, and the other course didnt fail, the wellington was cooked perfectly and the dessert....top 3 best I have ever had....in my life....and I eat a lot of desserts!!!

5716274,2018-02-14,17,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Gordon Ramsay's fifth and newest restaurant in the theme of his hit TV show (Hell's Kitchen) has arrived in Vegas and I just had to try.  Which day better to go, than my birthday??  But oh wait, the news has said since its recent opening, there have been 12,000 reservations.  I'd ought to make one.  For my day, the last available is at 2:45 in the afternoon (-_-) late lunch I guess... Weird too because when we were there, more than half the tables were open.  So maybe if you're strolling by, they'll probably take walk-ins too.

The place is gorgeous.  A giant clean open room with lots of head space by a high ceiling.  The decor and the server uniforms make me feel like I'm in an old bank from the 1930's or something.  Hell's Kitchen would not be complete without the iconic open-kitchen as in the TV show.  Though the staff and decor shows the Red and Blue teams, there is no competition here - it's obvious they're all working together.  Speaking of Red & Blue teams, the restrooms, the men's sink counter is lit blue while my friend told me the women's sinks are lit red.  Hmm...

David was our server and was super nice.  He wore a smile through the whole experience and even shared great info - like the fact that we were there for the lunch service and need to come back at dinner for the rack of lamb.  Heck yeah.  But I came to Hell's Kitchen for one thing: Gordon's signature Beef Wellington.  To our knowledge, this is only available during lunch as part of the 3-course option (it's only available as an individual entree during dinner), so the 3-course we went. ($60; $95 with win pairing)

It started with a caesar salad or pumpkin soup (we got one of each and both were superb).  The salad, so simple but so good.  The soup, with a hint of spice, the creaminess goes down so smooth.  And then here comes the wellington... I gotta say... this is where I knocked off one star.  The bready crust was great, the vegetables were nice and moist, but the beef... it was drier than I anticipated.  Though it didn't meet my expectation, it was overall a good meal - and it didn't end there.  That toffee pudding dessert, a warm sticky cake with sweet ice cream was like crack!  I devoured it and soon after started very getting sleepy.  lol

I really enjoyed this spot and coming in for lunch only made me hungry for dinner.  Hopefully I'll get a chance at the lobster risotto and the rack of lamb - both of which Gordon was always slamming his fist and cursing the cooks for not getting perfect - it's gotta be good.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,30,29,4,5IZXgUGemzam346kJueJ1w

During our visit, I took my baby to the rest room to change his diaper and there was not any changing facilities in there. I asked at the host stand if I was missing the changing surface in the restroom and the manager beside her informed me that I should walk outside of the restaurant/building and use the PUBLIC TOILETS! I informed him that firstly I wasn't leaving the building with my baby as it was very cold outside that evening, and secondly, I wasn't going to take my baby into a public toilet to change his diaper when I am in a restaurant which should have these facilities in their own restrooms! Upon our entrees arriving, my beef wellington wasn't very warm and the server had taken away my knife and not replaced it, so I had to go in search of a knife which was frustrating. My water glass remained empty for quite a while and this was all I was drinking, so eventually, I asked my server if I could have more water and she never bothered to fill my glass for the remainder of the time we were there even after asking. These are not issues which should be resolved during the soft opening phase, these are the most basic server responsibilities!

When you walk in you are greeted with the wall of winners which is fun to look back on. About half of the tables are located right in the middle of the restaurant and get a view of the kitchen while the rest of the tables only get an obstructed view. The kitchen looks enough like the real thing although much smaller. 

The food though is what I was most excited for though. I have wanted to try the seared scallops and beef wellington that I have craved since season 1. So if you're like me then the preset  dinner was the way to go because it was exactly that followed by dessert. I built up what I hoped the food would taste like for so long that I was afraid I would be disappointed, but to my surprise, the food was as good as I have always imagined. When the waiters came to take my plates, they were so clean that you would think I liked them clean. And trust me, I considered it. Even the sticky toffee pudding ended up being one of the best deserts I have ever had. I got to try some of my friends' foods and can say the lamb and mac n cheese were equally just as amazing. The cheesecake was very pretty but was only okay.

5749655,2018-03-02,2,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"My boyfriend and I have been huge fans of the show. We actually tried emailing and contacting the network to be guest on the show since we live in LA but after numerous, i mean...numerous.. attempts we stopped trying since we never got a response or know anyone from the network. ;( which is why when they had this restaurant opening (which we found out from the last ALL STAR season) we were beyond EXCITED!! Here is my quick break down. 

Atmosphere: They have a red/blue team set up in an open kitchen just like the show which we loved! Unfortunately we sat near the window so we were far from the open kitchen. The overall atmosphere is pretty casual since we're dining on the strip. The overall vibe isn't too bad. It's not a whisper to your company quiet or scream b/c its so loud restaurant. Overall I think the overall atmosphere and lighting of the restaurant is 4 stars. I just wished all guest were able to view the open kitchen. 

Service: Our service overall was good. Our server was really nice but she was kind of too fast for us..if that makes sense. My only very very minor complaint would be that she tried to push ordering sides in which we didn't want any sides. We told her we didn't want sides but she ended up saying that the Mac and cheese was really good; we should try it.. we said no thank you. There may have been a miscommunication b/c after she repeated our order she said mac and cheese?!?! So we had to tell her three times no thank you. I don't like being rude or annoying customers b/c I've waited tables before but she made me really confused and kind of ""wth"" mode. I understand that they probably have to try to sell the extras to the customers but no means no lady! haha anyway all seriousness, we still gave her a generous tip and overall she was attentive. 4 stars 

Food: I ordered their pre-fix menu which I chose the seared scallops, beef wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding. My boyfriend got the lobster risotto for app and filet mignon. We shared my dessert, thank goodness we did b/c the dessert was definitely enough for two! 

The seared scallops were delicious. The sear for most of the scallops were spot on. The sauce and center slaw that came with it was tasty as well. My only complaint was that I wanted more scallops!

The lobster risotto fell short for us. Maybe because it was squash base but it was a TAD bland for us. Maybe they needed to add a little more butter or salt but something was off. The lobster was delicious and not rubbery like some other places. After seeing it on the show, we probably over hyped it in our heads. 

Beef Wellington: The infamous beef wellington.. was absolutely perfect. The only thing about the wellington is that, its kind of difficult to eat in the sense that the pastry would fall off the steak. Flavor wise, cook wise, and portion wise it was 5 stars. We actually had the beef wellington previously from Gordan ramsays other restaurant Steak at Paris Hotel and this one doesn't compare! I know it's the same chef..but the one we had at the hells kitchen was better. 

Filet Mignon: The portion def looks larger on TV than the one we got in person. Flavor wise it was spot on. I've had other filets at numerous restaurants and the one here is delicious. Comes with some roasted tomatoes and Bearnaise sauce. The sauce was good with the filet but for me, a perfectly cooked/seasoned filet needs NO SAUCE! end of story. I would want to try the NY strip next time I'm here. 

Toffee sticky pudding: WINNER of the night. All the other reviews did not disappoint. We were pretty full already from dinner but when the dessert came out.. we just couldn't help ourselves. Spoon after spoon of foodgasmic heaven. I don't know what it is..maybe it's the toffee but OMG. MUST TRY! It's not overly powerfully sweet, the ice cream on top does the perfect touch. The pudding itself is so moist but not to the point of no texture either. My mouth is watering as I type.. 5/5!! 

One of our biggest disappointments is that we did not see the season winner Michelle as executive chef!!! Then I found out on IG that she didn't start yet.. we will go back just to see her! 

Overall I feel like there are a few things that can be fixed but it's still a fairly new restaurant. I advise making a reservation. We got super lucky with a last minute one. I would come back and try the other items and support Gordan Ramsay!",b308fd_6PATb5IJu9wJJMg,2,2,4,VlKcey-ZCJLltU78Bu_CZw

5752584,2018-03-12,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"HOLY CRAP. Completely blown away.

Went on a business trip (expenses paid) so picked some decent places to eat. The others were $$-$$$ as well and this was hands down most worth. 

Firstly, you must reserve; reservations were all seated very punctually. Ours was at 9:45 came here earlier hoping to get a earlier spot but it was packed but we were fine. We noticed people were getting called in at exactly 9:30, 9:15... and we got called on the dot. Which is very professional and amazing because restaurants usually don't care. Another thing was that when they say this place closes at 10, they stop accepting people at 10.

The staff was also very friendly for dealing with the heavy customer load they were getting, immediately noticed this because I always see rbf on the servers, but I saw none!

Got seated and our waitress was so nice. Ordered a mocktail, it was okay.

Food ordered:

- lobster tail risotto: I can never be happy with risotto anymore... literally teared... because it was so unbelievably good. I never thought a food item would make me feel that way. I love risotto and I always order it at any restaurant, so I wasn't expecting this. The consistency was perfect. There was still the classic risotto taste, and the taste blended so well with the lobster tail... the portion was perfect. I ate it all... by myself.

- crispy skin salmon: the skin was crispy as it says and the inside was very soft and almost melts in your mouth. Definitely the best salmon I've ever had, not oily. I couldn't understand how they pulled it off.

- lamb rack: like the others very amazing; my friend ordered this so I only had a bite but it was also soft and skillfully cooked.

- bread pudding: good balance between sweet and not too sweet, wasn't too hard or mushy, came with a coffee ice cream. Had the cornbread kind of texture... couldn't finish it but ate all the ice cream. Tried to finish it and wish I didn't. Never say this because I'm thrifty but wish it was smaller size. :,|

Risotto was highlight of my week.

Another thing I noticed was the tip recommendations; all the other $$$ places I went to had tip recommendations: 18, 20, 22% but they only had 15, 18, 20% here. Modest.

Both the service and the food were worth 5 stars. It is so hard to find a place that excels at both food and service, service is usually a huge mood kill.

Will definitely be coming back. However my total for  appetizer, drink, entree and desert + tip was $93, but very worth. Expect I would recommend splitting dessert.

TLDR;
- reservations are punctual on the dot
- all the workers were respectful and nice (no rbf!)
- if you enjoy risotto, prepare to be blown away with lobster risotto appetizer 
- portions to quality ratio was good for price.
- split the dessert (2 people).",WDQD9CZJyKALHP2sU6oERQ,2,0,5,nocOenGCTBZVjEdqnoemIQ

We were seated with a Strip view that was beautiful as it transitions from day to evening.  The front of the restaurant is like the show.  We were happy with our view.

Our waiter John was warm and welcoming.  We both ordered drinks.  My Manhattan was perfect!  My husband chose the Rum Donkey which came with a flaming passion fruit.  

Our waiter was knowledgeable and patient.  We selected scallops and flaming prawns.  Both were well prepared.  I would argue shrimp was over priced but tasty and great presentation.  Our main course was Beef Wellington delicious, and the aged New York strip, perfectly prepared.  Hubby can be critical of his steak but said he would definitely order again!  For dessert there is only one choice in Hell's Kitchen and it was Sticky Toffee Pudding.  Spectacular!!! You just feel happy eating the pudding, warm, moist and balanced with the ice cream.  We also tried the Pineapple Carpaccio with Coconut Sorbet.  Presentation was amazing.  The fruit was sweet and very thinly sliced. The sorbet light and flavorful.

The whole evening was lovely.  John could not have been more attentive or kind.  You don't mind splurging for great food and great service for a special occasion.  We would definitely revisit Hell's Kitchen.

The service our party of 6 received was truly 5 stars.  I would rate the food 4 stars.  The lobster in the lobster risotto was perfectly cooked but my first bite of the risotto had a few crunchy grains.  I thought about sending it back but there were no more crunchy grains until the last bite which had a few more.  The risotto was a little bland and under seasoned.  My homemade risotto is more flavorful but doesn't include the lobster . . . Sorry Gordon.  For my entree I had the crispy skin salmon.  The salmon could not have been prepared any better!  However, the accompaniments, although good, were not mind blowing.  Why did I rate my experience a 3?  Because of the sheer noise level in the restaurant!  I am an audio/acoustic engineer.  According to the Sound Pressure Level meter on my phone, the volume in the room averaged 95+dBA!!!  I found I could not hear the waiter's descriptions well and we were screaming at each other across the table.  I understand the desire to have a ""high energy"" atmosphere to make the restaurant exciting, but this is extreme.  Let me know if you want to fix this Gordon.  In summation, not a place for a romantic dinner.  Glad I had the opportunity.  Wouldn't go back based solely on the noise level.",7GTmsqLPYrzCLGqWbInSFw,0,0,3,GoSK_pDgVBAV2F33Wa_Mjw

My friends and I drove in from Phoenix AZ. Specifically to come check out the new Hells Kitchen. As it's my vacation from the east coast, I wanted to experience all that I can. And I have to say I am not disappointed!!! It was worth the drive and it was worth every penny spent. 

Alex was our server and he was attentive, professional and had the qualities of a server you would want. Was there when you needed and not overbearing!! Never sat there wondering where my waiter was to get more water or anything. Timing was flawless!!

We all elected to go with the Pre-Fixe menu which was a 3 course meal with Scallops (or a Caesar salad), a perfectly medium-rare beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  Of course we threw on a Kettle One Dirty Martini to keep the fun going.

The meal was great, and filling.  I was told that Chef Ramsay reads each of these reviews by our waiter, so if he does, I would love it for a response.

5919110,2018-05-01,1,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"It was a good experience except for the fact that I got the runs from the scallops. 

I came here at 4pm on a Monday and got seated right away at a table by the window-- really nice atmosphere, I appreciated the gold accents everywhere. Hell's Kitchen is playing on the TV, there's an open kitchen with chefs wearing blue and red team uniforms. 

I was starting to wonder about the timing of the service, but my server explained that I caught them between lunch and dinner, which is why it took a little bit longer. I appreciated the explanation so I wasn't wondering where my food was.

I got the pre fixe scallops, beef Wellington, and toffee pudding. Even though I came at an odd time, my server Mike made sure the timing on the service was perfect, so the entree came right after the appetizer, and same for the dessert.

The scallops were tasty with a great soft texture, and the celery compote salad was served warm. It tasted great.

Then the beef wellington came-- perfectly done on the inside and with a flaky pastry. But midway through eating it, my stomach started feeling funny. I hadn't eaten anything since 9am in the morning, and the only other thing I'd had before this was the scallops. I kept ignoring the rumblings since they were coming and going, so I hoped they would go away. I finally had to rush to the bathroom after I finished my wellington, which took a while for me to finish. 

Omg. It was that not the good kind of bathroom experience. Thank goodness it wasn't too painful. I think if the scallops were done any less, it would have been a worse restroom trip. Scallops tend to work quickly (thank god I went to the restroom and didnt wait-- I had a half hour Linq high roller right after this, and they don't have any restrooms once you get on).

I told the server Mike that I was worried about the scallops (and I didn't want other patrons rushing to the bathroom either), but that I was ok and that they did taste very good. He asked if I was ok and said he'd let the chef know. 

So I sit down for my sticky toffee pudding, which was warm and delicious. But I had to run to the bathroom AGAIN after I almost finished the dessert, and this run was just...liquid. I know, its not a pretty picture. I paid the full bill and still tipped the server well because I overall still thought the food was tasty and the service was good. But I had to follow up with the server before I left to ask what the chef said. He just said they said they'd cook the scallops more thoroughly here on out. 

Overall, the experience was good-- taking one star off for the scallops giving me a bad time at the restroom, but otherwise everything was tasty.",-G2FgTUexc8rOYk-nWDxNw,0,0,4,IDPL7mdFOChfU3z9HSOF0g

I got the prix fixe dinner, which comes with seared scallops (fresh and flavorful), the beef Wellington (pretty good), and the sticky toffee pudding. The portion is not as big as the TV show has shown, and the service is kind of slow... So gotta knock down 1 star for that. Overall, the price is not bad considering it being in Vegas and it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I would definitely come back just for dessert.

My daughter and I attended here at 2:45pm on Feb 11th 2018 my b-day. The front desk and waiter both asked ""are you celebrating a special event?' when we said yes they flatlyn  said ""oh,  happy birthday"" there was never any other mention not even as we paid our bill and said goodbye. During the waiters introduction of the menu and our ordering he kept looking around, over his shoulder, to the left, to the right, behind himself - anywhere but at us. We started to feel like we were of no consequence.
The food: one plus was fair prices :-) and the sticky pudding exceeded all expectations delicious!!! and the side order of creamed potatoes also delicious.
But the rest was sadly disappointing the appetizers ( Risotto and soup)  came on giant cold china plates and so the food was tepid at first bite and before we finished eating it was stone cold :-(
Beef Wellington - pastry semi raw on bottom, no au jus or moisture on the plate except for a drizzle of brown gravy(?), the filet minion was cooked to perfection - cut like butter - but the Bearnaise had a skin on it from sitting under the heat lamp - so looked unappealing.
I know Gordon Ramseys' standards so I was very disappointed we did not complain as my daughter was treating and I did not wish to seem unappreciative of her efforts nor want embarrass her. Next time I'll be ready to send things back and you should be too.",11lOD1Icv8xaZcy5fnHfDA,1,0,2,g3Spe-rlgaTo1ROfFuZbVA
5937293,2018-03-04,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"As a big fan of the show and Chef Ramsey, I was disappointed at this experience.  Food was good but nothing extraordinary. My expectation after years of watching the show would have been impeccable timing, service and taste.  Rather, we got decent food, no silverware, side dishes turning up halfway through the meal, and a large bill at the end.   Lobster Risotto was runny and salmon skin was not crispy as expected.  Mac and cheese and potatoes au gratin were average to what you would expect.  Food alone I would give it a 3 at least as the Wellington and desert were tasty but the service and timing flaws deserve recognition when you can't even get water or find out when 1/2 your food is coming. Our waitress and the manager standing nearby seemed more focused on socializing with other staff than ensuring our meals were correct and we had what was needed.

*bumping up this rating - GM reached out directly for additional information.  Appreciate the follow up and shows the focus on making sure the guest experience is corrected where not right.",4COzLfEfopGrpHbee5E_dg,1,0,3,za8v7atqYAy4SKgO5TpYTA

He explained every dish in detail and when we asked how good an item on the menu was, he described each perfectly. He really made the experience at Hell's Kitchen a great one. I'm a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay, and coming here exceeded my expectation. It's definitely an experience I think anyone who appreciates good food and fine dining should go to. 

Food (5/5): In one word: divine. LITERALLY everything we tried was DELICIOUS. My tastebuds went on a trip. Undoubtedly the best meal I've ever had in my young 22 years of life.

5944656,2018-02-10,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"As a fan of the show and having previously dined at Gordon Ramsey Steak 3 times, I was excited to try this restaurant. Unfortunately, the food and service at Hells Kitchen were extremely underwhelming. 

When we checked in for our reservation, we were then asked to wait in line. We were sat at a table by the kitchen which was nice. Based on our table location, we were being served food from the blue kitchen. We were then greeted by our waitress who asked if we have dined here before. I advised we had not but have eaten at his steakhouse. She passed out the menus and left the table. She did not go over any of the signature drinks or even take our drink order. She came back about 10 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order. She did not ask if we have any question or make any recommendations on the menu. We placed our order for drinks at the same time as the food. When we told her our drink order with the food order she forget what we order and ask us what we would like to drink again. We ordered ginger ale, root beer, Jack Daniels on the rocks and a Stella. All 4 drinks were brought to our table separately which was odd, as typically all drinks would be brought together. We also had to ask the waitress for the Jack Daniels twice as she forgot it. 

For appetizers we ordered prawns flambé, shrimp cocktail and meatballs. They brought out the flambé and shrimp cocktail but no meatballs. Having previously dined at the Steakhouse and having watched Hell's Kitchen, all food should be served at the same time. This was not the case and a theme throughout our dining experience. We had finished the 2 appetizers that were brought out and were still waiting for the waitress to come back so we could ask for the meatballs. When she finally came over to the table and we inquired about the missing appetizer, she went over to the order kiosk and it looked like she was adding it to the order. She then proceeded to go to the chef at the pass and tell him the issue. A server from the red kitchen had just got meatballs to walk to a table and was stopped to bring them to ours instead. The flambé and shrimp cocktail were good and the meatballs were decent (not enough sauce). 

For our entrees we ordered 2 Beef Wellington's, rack of lamb, filet mignon, mushrooms and French fries. Given where we were seated we could see our food sitting at the pass for a while. It looks like they were waiting for garnish to get our side dishes ready. When the food arrived everything was there except the French Fries and we had to ask for them as they were forgotten. The food was luke warm at best since it was sitting at the pass for so long. While the food was edible, it is not even comparable to the Beef Wellington served at Gordon's Steakhouse, which I ate 2 out of the 3 times dining at his Steakhouse. The Beef Wellington was packed with too much mushroom so it made the puff pastry fall apart when you cut into it. The potato purée was thick and the sauce was not good either. 

For dessert we ordered Sticky Toffee Pudding and the cheesecake. The Sticky Toffee Pudding tasted good but the texture was off. Given that it is cake made out of dates, the texture more grainy than the 3 times I ate it at his steakhouse. The cheesecake was decent. 

While some issues presented above could seem nit picky, if you have dined at one of Gordon's other restaurants and have received exceptional service and consistently wonderful food, this restaurant is definitely a let down. If you are looking to try Gordon's signature dishes (Beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding), I would highly recommend trying his steakhouse at the Paris. The service and food have been spectacular all 3 times.",m86sTsOllEpcRM0gfAXiLQ,1,0,2,tLkO05EiaGsYqdC-iZ01Qg
5953281,2018-01-15,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"We made the trip out to Vegas from LA specifically to try Hell's Kitchen. Not worth.

Menu items we tried:
Scallops
Lobster Risotto
Mac & Cheese
Beef Wellington
Toffee Pudding

If I were to go back I would SKIP THE BEEF WELLINGTON ENTIRELY. Two of the four of us ordered the pre-fixe menu (scallops, wellington, pudding), but at the end of the meal each of us couldn't believe we even thought about paying the a la carte price of the Beef Wellington. The combination of Hell's Kitchen's dull (steak?) knives + the extra chewy wellington basically shoots the steak from the puff pastry every single time you try to get both in the same bite.

Scallops were tougher and smelled fishier than we were used to.

Lobster Risotto, Mac & Cheese, Toffee Pudding and the service are the silver lining to an otherwise bland visit.

For a place to get small dishes and appetizers, sure, Hell's Kitchen is worthwhile if other restaurants don't have the space.

It seems more like a marketing gimmick than a fine dining experience to me. I admit - I fell for it.",rL4QUwRi2FvHG6JWkhsZiQ,2,0,2,gYouNMfXMiiRHGnkLOeAVA

5965304,2018-02-11,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Lunch here was delicious! The lobster risotto is a must. The short rib grilled cheese had good flavor but make sure you enjoy super crunchy bread. The mushroom truffle pizza was also great, but my mom thought the beef wellington was just okay. The sticky toffee pudding is a must as well, moist dense cake with speculoos ice cream. The pineapple carpaccio was incredible! Not only for the cool presentation with liquid nitrogen, but the citrus foam and coconut sorbet with the sweet pineapple was so tasty and refreshing. 

Docked one star because we waited 40 minutes from when we had our appetizer until our entrees. Apparently they burned the pizza and had to remake, but it would've been nice to let us know before we mentioned we were waiting a bit long. Otherwise the rest of service was attentive. Decor was nice as well with pitchforks incorporated all over.

Christopher was our server and he was excellent. Knowledgeable and passionate about the restaurant. Best part of the meal was the pineapple dessert with coconut sorbet and passionate. Absolutely delicious. Only thing to make the experience better for me would be a vegan option on the menu. Once you start altering the selection to be vegan they aren't the same and not as satisfying .Makes it uncomfortable to have to ask as well.

5982650,2018-03-28,0,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"Even with slightly slow service I am still giving this place 5 stars because the meal itself blew us out of the water. I am 95% sure every steak going forward will be a disappointment in comparison to what we have eaten.

We easily made an open table reservation (about two weeks out from our trip). 

Theme and design: 8/10 everything worked well, but to be honest the tv screen flames were a little lame.
Service: 7/10 drinks and appetizers came out quickly but it was a little off putting when out main courses were taking a while and the waiter came by twice to say ours was the next ticket. Dessert cake out way faster than expected so that made up for it a little. 

But the shining star is the food. The wagyu meatballs were good (worth it if you're eating with a slightly picky eater) the beef Wellington was spot on perfection. But the sticky toffee dessert was possibly the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth. 

I would recommend to anyone but make you're reservation well in advance",AQsUkAEQdF-dU5xQ2U6YZA,1,1,5,wfmIpg8xe0GP-tcoMIRIKg
5987602,2018-05-02,11,vHz2RLtfUMVRPFmd7VBEHA,"In short: great presentation, but food is mediocre. 

Full review: My boyfriend and I came out to Vegas for his first time and we were excited to give this place a try. If you want to give this place a try after my full review book ahead of time because they get extremely packed ! Why ? Probably because it's everyone's first time lol. Dressing attire is casual, but feel free to dress up as it is a nice location. The inside was nicely decorated. They  have a wall with framed photos of all the winners from all of their seasons. Inside there are hell forks on the ceiling. You can see them cooking from your seat. Service and decor was five stars too bad the food gave this place such a bad rating on my behalf. 

For our appetizers we order the meatballs, the lobster and the hot wings. Appetizers were decent, but the main entrees were bland. The meatballs had a lot of flavor. The cheese and potatoes paired well. The lobster appetizer would have been better if it was hot. You could tell they wanted everything to come out together so it was sitting for a bit. The hot wings, weren't really that spicy. I don't like spicy things and I could bare. The blue cheese dressing was good. Like always plate came with carrots and celery, which we didn't care to touch.

For our entrees I ordered the brick pressed chicken. Right when I was ready to cut my first piece I noticed a hair right on top. Oh my gosh !!! I told my boyfriend and soon enough my waiter overheard and took it back. My boyfriend got the dry age New York steak and it came out before mine, so once she took my plate back we were stuck waiting. When she finally brought out my plate you could tell it was rushed. It still looked nice, but it had no flavor besides what was on the skin. I enjoyed more of what was beneath the chicken which I believe was kale and carrots diced up. 

Overall, overpriced for tasteless food. We should have ate at Outback. I don't mind paying top dollar for good food, but this was such a waste of money.",gTa6OqndLhLs9xDxv-wP_Q,11,9,1,z3XKkIuh1yIiIL6qm1mbVw
