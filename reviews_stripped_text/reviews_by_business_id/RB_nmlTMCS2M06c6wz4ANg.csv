26475,2015-08-06,0,RB_nmlTMCS2M06c6wz4ANg,"WOW, what a meal! 

The service was absolutely top notch and the ambiance was very intimate and made me feel like I was at home.

We started off with the calamari appetizer which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. 

Four of us had filet mignon for dinner and the meat was as tender as it could have been cooked. Additionally, the asparagus on the side was cooked to perfection, which is something very hard to do. The other member of our party had the spaghetti alla sorrentina. The mozzarella melted very nicely into the pasta and the sauce was divine (very large portion). 

For dessert we shared the spumoni. Beautiful presentation and flavor. Moreover, we were given a complimentary ravioli dessert which was wonderful (a word that can be used to describe every aspect of the restaurant). 

This is one of our new favorite Vegas restaurants and we will be frequenting on every subsequent trip.",3OwnFZ_oEUMJNi0HU8pDNA,0,0,5,dFLAus7tTi89ZCKoeE7Qdg

We started with 2 glasses of red wine and a meatball appetizer that was reminiscent of dining at a South Philadelphia Italian restaurant. The meatballs were accompanied by warm bread, which we used to sop up the ""gravy."" 

Osso Bocco is my favorite dish and this was the best I ever had. Veal shanks aren't normally meaty, but these were. The high quality of the veal was immediately recognizable and the portion was generous, as well. 

My wife ordered veal picante, which was also good, but we both agreed that the osso bocco was the star of the evening. 

When we considered the overall experience, the price was not unreasonable. 
The atmosphere was relaxing and conducive to leisurely dining, which is a rarity in Las Vegas. The service was right up there, too. The owner provided us with some nice little extras and made us feel like we were guests in his home. This put an already lovely meal, over the top for us.

We felt we got what we paid for.  It is nice to have a place we can dress nicely and feel special  and a little decadent.  I get pasta at Italian, so I can't comment on the steaks other than they appeared to be reasonable priced for the type of restaurant this is.  I had the meat ravioli (braise short rib and truffle I believe) and mad yummy sounds with every bite.  Linda had a flavorful red sauce pasta (not sure what now) and also raved. It didn't hurt that they had primed us with a complimentary glass of bubbly when we entered.  That and the wine we had left us happy and sated.

I feel this is deceptive advertising, had the sign said vegetarian buffet I wouldn't have gone in. So I proceeded to order an Italian chicken dish which was so short of good.

1481401,2014-02-16,2,RB_nmlTMCS2M06c6wz4ANg,"Rare is the opportunity to visit a place like Vegas and stumble across a brand new restaurant. We found ourselves in that position at Toscano. We walked in on just its second night of business. 

It was the Presidents' Day weekend, so Vegas was jam packed. Yet this stunning spot was largely empty. At first we didn't understand why, and we continued to be perplexed as excellent food was delivered by a highly solicitous service staff. We learned later that the restaurant was just getting started.

As for the food - maybe the best calamari I ever had, served with delicious marinara sauce; excellent fresh shellfish--some of it in a pleasing cioppino and the rest in a linguine dish; solid escargot (some French dishes, too!); terrific ravioli in lobster sauce; and elegant truffle mashed potatoes.

The dining rooms are magnificent. Dark wood and leaded glass. We were told this used to be a Ruth's Chris Steak House, so the new proprietors walked into a nearly turn-key space.          

Toscano is in a highly competitive environment in a tough town. We wish them well and hope they have a long run. If you go, you will, too.",WQ8XspqfeK9eZ1_sVFojeQ,1,3,4,7HnxuTFu4q1RjqQPdukDbw

Expensive, but the quality is very good.

The breads were warmed. Calamari Fritti was so good that we were unable to stop and almost regretted it because the portion was generous and affected our ability to fully consume subsequent dishes. Linguini with lobster tail was so flavorful. Filet Mignon was a perfect medium rare and great with the Béarnaise sauce. Potato au Gratin was baked crispy outside and juicy inside.

Had a groupon for $50, but still ended up paying additional $60 out of pocket...for 2 people! And neither of us had steak. Husband reported his lobster ravioli to be flavorful. My duck was two very small breasts...and what I would swear were INSTANT mashed potatoes. As some others have reported, I found everything, from the soup to the sauces, lacking in seasoning. We waited 30 minutes for the finale: creme brulee. I think they made it from scratch; but at least they made it (I've been to so many places in Vegas where it is on the menu, but they never have it!). I kind of felt like they could have comp'ed the cappuccinos we had while we were waiting so long. 
Service was good and the decor was upscale. My biggest peeve of the night: the chairs were TOO HIGH for the table we were at. I felt like a buzzard,  hunched over my meal.

2638928,2015-04-06,1,RB_nmlTMCS2M06c6wz4ANg,"Five of us had dinner here on a Thursday night.  It was not busy at all, just a few other tables filled around us.  The restaurant is actually pretty large with several sections.  We weren't sure if we'd have two more joining us, so they accommodated us by putting the five of us at a table for eight, which I thought was nice.

Our server was AWESOME.  He was friendly and attentive throughout the meal and chatted with us like a friend.  We really appreciated him!  The other staff were also friendly and professional, we were checked on and taken care of by multiple other people, too.

I, and one of our friends, ordered the Pappardelle Zafferano e Gamberi, which was shrimp with pappardelle pasta in a wonderfully flavorful and creamy saffron sauce.  Saffron is so delicate, but tasty and it went really nicely with the shrimp.  That was enough to fill me up.  My husband had the lasagna and he must have hated it because he made it disappear in about 5 minutes flat. Another friend had the Tortellini Ripieni con Brasato and Black Truffle, she is so cute and thought that short rib would be a barbecue flavor! She loved her dish as well, but since she started with onion soup, she shared the pasta with everyone... well, except me because I was already too full!  Her husband had a filet mignon and it was a beautiful steak - he added the asparagus, but I thought it was a little pricey at $9 for the 3 spears served. But, every piece of food that we ate was delicious.  Some had drinks, I just had iced tea and literally, the iced tea was the ONLY negative of the visit because it didn't taste very good - like it was out of a machine.  We topped off dinner with shared creme brulees.  YUM

Other than that, this was a wonderful meal and a wonderful experience and, oh, did I mention that we got 20% off for checking in on yelp?  Seriously, for five it was under $200, so I thought it was a pretty good deal for the quality of food and service.

Toscano is located in The Park at 3900 plaza, next to the old Firefly where the former Ruth Chris/Kelly's Steakhouse were. I think Toscano is going to fare much better than its predecessors though. 

Appetizer - tuna tartare. This was awesome. Fresh and delicious served beside perfectly seasoned crispy crostini.

Salad - Caprese salad. This was a large salad, so my boyfriend and I were able to share it. This just knocked my socks off. I have never had such a delicious caprese salad in my life. As I write this review I want to jump into my car and drive over there for some more! Four large slices of tomato topped with delicious, buttery mozzarella, shaved strips of basil, and served with kalamata olives. The amount of oil and seasonings was perfect. Hands down - BEST CAPRESE EVER.

Main course - surf and turf. My boyfriend and I decided to share this since the tuna tartare and caprese were large enough portions. I don't eat meat, but he said the steak was phenomenal. The lobster was served with drawn butter, absolutely perfect.  It came baked, and though I usually prefer mine steamed it didn't make any difference last night! 

Dessert - we opted for the traditional tiramisu. I loved how it was served in a martini glass - definitely added to the presentation. And of course - it was to die for!

We ended up dining pretty late - in fact we were the last ones there. The servers and staff never let on that we were keeping them. They were absolutely great about everything.

I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice night out. I'd even go there with my friends for a nice glass of wine, to share a dish, and split a dessert.  If I could give this place 10 stars I would! It is a quiet, family owned restaurant, and the values of hard work and dedication show in their food, presentation, and service.

I was quickly brought an iced tea and some bread and butter.  In a short time, the calamari I ordered for an appetizer was brought.  It was lightly breaded and fried briefly.  It was served with a marinara sauce that was tasty but it was not spicy as the menu indicated.

For the main course, I got pappardelle in saffron sauce with shrimp.  It was good although I thought the shrimp were a bit chewy.  The saffron sauce was quite good.

Before ordering a dessert, my server brought me a complimentary tiramisu.  Perhaps it was because of my dinner and show reservations because everyone in the side room where I ate were going to the show, too, and they all got the tiramisu.

Service was very good.  The server addressed me by name throughout the evening and he was around to check to see how everything was during the meal.

Great service, great food. Good wine list that doesn't break the bank. Go check out the menu. Everything we had and I mean everything was perfect. Rib Eye was so flavorful and filling. Caesar Salad was wonderful. If you get the chance ask to be in Slater's section.Todd will make your Banana's foster and we even had Prosciutto sliced directly at the table as an appetizer which was a first for me. Go give them a try. Great service that is worth every penny. Less expensive than most of the steak houses on the strip.",ris1WsHDAoG3Wk_BjhhLwg,0,0,5,Tjh_b9Lp8LKgxPmWko-4OQ

The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was exactly what you want in an Italian Vegas steak house. Very upscale but intimate. The icing on the cake was our service from Kodi. We mentioned our anniversary in passing and he took it to the top! Brought little complimentary extras to the table during evening making the experience unforgetable. Found our new place for special occasions.",hgtjZsg2KGGv32h0tO7LVQ,0,0,5,B0RPcp8h3kodZFB4zyHf7A

I ordered the Toscanini Ripieni, which was creamy and delicious. The gimlet was smooth and satisfying, and the creme broulee was some of the best I've ever had. 

Bryan, our server, was perfectly attentive. He made good recommendations and made us feel right at home. He even offered a sample of their specialty dessert, on the house.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely make it a point to come eat here again! I was extremely satisfied with my dinner at Toscano's.",eysCMbe10JZYa32bCYYozw,0,0,5,E5cM631Lv2OuqfZoNt-01Q

The steaks are top notch! The duck was so amazingly flavorful, accompanied by truffled mashed potatoes! The cioppino was packed with fresh seafood! The caprese sad has the freshest mozzarella and olive oil that I can imagine. 
The only disappointment is the bread has been changed! Since I don't go out for bread, I'm happy to not feel compelled to eat it all!!!!",KrT4LHYdRt-m1DMPtVKN4w,0,0,5,CFpj6VVdzapVxDUgGrVwJQ

The service and atmosphere are tops .  Hire a new chef!! I won't return. A restaurant for the 65 and over crowd. Live bar music for the 70 and over crowd. So many better options to choose from.,HoH6SgtKLt5Fj8hn3tkJHA,3,1,3,OIjM-yGgLB8lHsA7OopjDQ

I ordered the calamari based on the reviews.  It was good, but nothing special.  I agree with some other reviewers that it was under seasoned.

The lobster ravioli was very tasty.  The sauce was delicious.

The bananas foster did not disappoint.  It was the definite highlight of the meal.  

I would not go out of my way to go to this restaurant while in Vegas, but I had a wonderful dining experience here.",VrK6rT-on0HuhPINykRlvg,3,2,4,GaTqtbY-pnU5BEmvEJx_PA
