They might trying to sell drink thats why it was so salty....  some seafood also smelled and they are trying to kill refrigerator smell tp use extra garlic and pepper, but still smelled. 

We had family came from Cali and we checke yelp that they wanted to try such a high rated Italian dishes. But it was just such a disappointment.",1w-pL71BflIk0Jo6Tj3cYg,0,0,2,qzhHwuTtUafyqkPIUvhlHA

food: this is like a japanese/italian fusion restaurant.  waitress said that the japanese influence gives the pastas a broth-ier base. flavor of the pasta was ok... more of a creamy miso.  unfortunately my food came out a bit on the warm to cool side, the rest of the food orders came out looking like they were pipping hot.

This place gives that a whole new meaning, using uniquely japanese ingredients with italian. 

We ordered the uni(urchin) tomato pasta and the squid ink pasta. Both were nothing less than amazing! 

Often, pasta can get a little sickening and oily, but not the ones from here. 
The urchin was creamy and fresh and works ridiculously well with a tomato based spaghetti. 
The squid ink was strong and flavoursome with fresh seafood, loved it!

Maybe I'm biased because I'm asian, but this place is like every asian mums pasta on steroids. Gonna have to up your game mum...",7fuDB6C0Eyxom9rjOMiscA,1,1,5,j86GDxR82nwEaBKpNs3t5Q

From the bread to the salad, entrees and desserts, everything was spectacular. We had squid ink pasta, Kobe style skirt steak, and the linguini and clams pasta. We finished off with the dessert trio.

536065,2015-03-17,2,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Rating is more like 3 1/2 stars:

A very intriguing concept considering Italian and Japanese are such a contrast from each other. However, I enjoyed their dishes and how they incorporated traditional pastas with Asian flair. A friend and I went in on a Thursday around 3pm for happy hour and it was completely empty besides one other patron. The hostess was quite friendly and the kitchen was open where you can see a chef prepping. The spacing is quite tight, so I was thankful that we had the restaurant to ourselves. 

I started off with a glass of their sauvignon blanc, I was disappointed in the serving glass. It was served in a small, hard plastic champagne glass instead of an actual wine glass.  But, being the passive person that I am (not every time, though), I let the matter drop and didn't complain. For the appetizers, I ordered the fried oysters and the spaghetti with asparagus, tomato, clams, and white sauce for my main. I actually enjoyed my dishes and whatever bread they served was super good! The best part was that I was full at the end of our meal. There wasn't anything spectacular about our experience (it's been a couple weeks since dining here so I've forgotten most of my experience), but the food was good. 

I'm not sure if I'll go out of my way to visit again, because I tend to avoid eating in China town. Not to sound offensive, but you just hear one too many ""instances"" regarding health and sanitation to the point that it becomes a disgusting pattern. But if, for whatever reason, I find myself in China town again, then I will most likely stop here for a quick bite.  I just love the Italian twist.",ka8Pk_MXUXNmPy9kPaO43w,1,0,3,Gn6Cgg0KL4aT7IAVCUpcdg

They CHARGED US $15 per glass which I felt was totally OUTRAGEOUS.  The tiniest wine glass I have ever seen.  Intolearable.  My office is 4 minutes away.  So they lost a great ongoing customer.

My girlfriend and I went there to try. It is a small restaurant but the size is doesnt matter. The waitress greeted us right away when my right foot steped into the door. It was clean and we picked our own table because there not much people. We ordered FRIED CHICKEN and KOBE BEEF CARPACCIO. 

The taste of the chicken was quite special. It wasnt very special but smell good. 
The kobe beef can be thinner but it taste good also.
Then we ordered two pasta. UNI AND TOMATO SAUCE PASTA and MISO CARBONARA.

The uni one tasted like uni but not fishy. They gave us two little bottle of red pepper and chees to add on, just like the things that you put on your pizza or not. I put both on the pasta, it surprisingly tasted great. It added more layer on the flavor to play with your taste bugs. 
The miso carbonara tasted like regular carbonara but with miso flavor. i also added cheese and pepper on it. It didnt surprise me this time coz i had been surprised on the first time. It tasted good also. 

The service was great. Our waitress keep wiping our table and refilling my water. She was great. I didnt ask for her name becoz it considers as a ""flirting act"" in front of my gf. 

This is the first time i feel good when i tipped the waitress. Normally, i didnt feel good when doing the tipping section.

Felt like Italian and the regular haunts on the Strip weren't looking particularly appetizing or worth the hassle this Memorial Day weekend so looked up Italian and happened across this. I know I just came back from Japan on business but wanted to see if this Japanese Italian place would hold up to actual Japanese establishments.

Got there and it was about 1/3 full. Got a table immediately. Score. Would have been probably 2 hrs to get anything on the Strip if able to get in at all.

Service was good by the two Japanese waitresses. Very friendly and gave detailed explanations.

We started off with the bruschetta trio (octopus/avocado/wasabi mayo, tuna/mentaiko, daikon). I liked the daikon the best. Light and subtle. Others were ok. The mentaiko tasted more like tarako since it had no spiciness to it but still decent nevertheless.

I ordered the uni tomato cream pasta, others the ikasumi and shrimp and tarako cream pastas. They were all good. I think I liked the two cream pastas the best. However, like another reviewer I felt like there wasn't really an uni taste to it. More like a rich and creamy tomato cream. They also had Bafun Uni pasta which I should have gotten since I believe that was just uni and not tomato cream. I realized that after the fact... Oh well.

We were all full but we couldn't be stopped. We finished off with the dessert trio which included the pannacotta with kurozato sauce, black sesame blanc mange and Nakamura style tiramisu. We also ordered the warabimochi w/kinako and green tea gelato because warabimochi is one of my favorite desserts. All were very good. If I had to make a choice I would go with the three other than tiramisu. Not that the tiramisu wasn't good but there's only so much you can do with tiramisu and I've had so much there's no surprises anymore.

All in all a great choice. Would go back if struggling between Japanese and Italian or just to have good ""Italian"" food.",CnpxcfXRD4vhiZN7z2ISsA,1,1,4,D1LkGQu7g5RZQ2v2LnRKHw

Trattoria did not disappoint.  the decode inside is welcoming, friendly, simplistic and does not overdo it like a lot of the eateries in the complex and area with their tacky signs, cramped dining rooms and obscene wait times.

We opted to do one of the preset menus that would allow us to get a flavor for the restaurant's offering within a reasonable budget.  The calamari was not fried  (a nice change of pace) with seasoning and sauce.  The octopus was lightly fried and served with a lemon wedge and garnish.  I have to admit I was skeptical going in and having carbonara at a japanese restaurant.  That being said, I enjoyed this rendition of carbonara second most the carbonara I had in Italy.

The only regret we had from our visit was they were out of the green muscles.  This is always a great measure of an asian establishment.  We'll be back to try them.",rvVoA0LRk78csKFPxMHUNQ,1,1,4,gJh_WSMkGbV2FRH6FoZP4Q

It's definitely a little hidden gem stowed away in Chinatown. Small quiet cozy place and great for a date or even to bring the kids. 

It's a fusion of Japanese and Italian and everything is so delicately put together. For appetizers I have had the bruschetta and I just can't decide which is my favorite they all melt in your mouth. However I leave the place and crave the tuna bruschetta. The octopus with wasabi sauce is fantastic. I also had the beef carpaccio amazing!! We ordered the cheese platter and to my surprise it was great!! Usually I don't get that excited about cheese platters but definitely a must order.

For entrees I have been quite boring and both times ordered the Uni wild scallop tomato cream sauce pasta. I die and go to heaven every time I eat this. On one of my visits my Boyfriend ordered the squid ink pasta and I loved that too. But if your wearing white or have an engagement after dinner not the best choice your teeth will be black and if your like me it will be on your top no matter how hard you tried not to splatter.

While everyone is on the strip eating at places that are Iron Chef type places, I was happy to come here and enjoy an actual Iron Chef style meal.  What do I mean?  This place manages to pull off the Japanese and Italian combination quite well and it turns into something that is pretty unique.  If you're looking for standard fare, this isn't your place.  However, if you're looking to broaden your horizons and try something that'll push your taste buds in new directions, this place is it.  
Upon entering, the staff was very friendly and seated me at the bar.  I ordered the prix fixe and got their bruschetta to start.  Before it arrived, a warm roll that was quite good arrived.  When the bruschetta arrived, I was very happy to see that they were pulling off the Italian and Japanese combination as I had hoped for.  For the entree, I got the uni tomato cream pasta.  Technically, not on the prix fixe menu, but they upgraded it for a few dollars more.  The dish itself was a really interesting combination that managed to show off the uni and feel like a traditional Italian dish.  A real triumph if you ask me.  
I even got a dessert here in order to see how it was.  The tiramisu was for real.  A heavy cream on top and flavorful components below.  Not what you get at boring restaurants.

1235604,2015-03-14,3,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Came by here last Friday evening a little after 9:30 pm with my husband after we had a disappointing experience next door at Sweet Raku (this restaurant is also located in the same plaza as Raku, Kilroy's and Monta Ramen). Immediately upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by an employee. After being seated and browsing the menu, we ended up getting:

Halibut & Watercress Salad, $15 prior to tax- This item is not found in their menu but on their specials menu board. I decided to get this because I just wanted a salad for our late night dinner. The dressing came on the side, as I requested and had a nice sweet miso like flavor. The plating of this dish is beautiful, as most of the salad is served in a fried won ton bowl with large pieces of fresh halibut laid on top. Portion size is plenty for 2 people to share or make as a large entree for one. Watercress being quite a naturally peppery green, this dish does not need an additional amount of pepper, however, cracked black pepper topped the halibut (which was quite heavy on the black pepper). Although the halibut was great, it would have been much better with little to no black pepper. 

#38 Spaghetti Manila Clam & Shiso, $9.75 prior to tax- All I could taste in this dish was the basil. Although I do like basil, I thought it completely overpowered this dish. However, my husband really enjoyed this dish and said this is how his parents make their clams. For the price, you do get a fair amount of clams in this dish.

-----------------------------
(Total= $24.75, prior to tax)

Service was attentive and friendly. I was a little disappointed though when our server did not do anything for my birthday (as I had mentioned we were here to celebrate my birthday). However, our first server went home halfway during our meal (I assume she was getting off her shift). With our 2nd server, I don't think she knew we were there celebrating my birthday. Now some of you may think this is just trivial, but honestly, it just means that much more when a business will go that extra step just to celebrate with you (and things like that makes me want to tip higher). 

But aside from that, the food and service was good. I would come back here again in the future.",3UIa8YVjETNwJwnOl4SEdg,5,4,4,7xMQdqDJ2Zf1zZLJYeK3wA

1296301,2017-12-06,3,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"The trend of 'Fusion Food' was bound to happen because since people have been immigrating into this fine country of ours, we have been fusing our native homelands food with what we have available or because we are just so damn creative. Seriously, you can stick almost anything in a tortilla and BAM, fusion food!

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is the fusion of two great cuisines- Italian and Japanese. The menu is quite extensive with items that are Japanese and Italian but many items that are a combination of both. 

I met a fellow Yelp Elite here for dinner and as usual we shared our plates. We ordered prosecco and wine first because not only do us Yelpers like to eat, we also like a little drinky-drink. We decided on four items to share- two appetizers and two pasta dishes. 

The appetizers which I seriously recommend are the Octopus Capriccio and the Pork Shabu Shabu Salad. Both were solid especially the Octopus. I honestly think this one dish is great for both novice and veteran octopi eaters. It was fresh and anything with the word Capriccio, you know will be a hit. 

For the pastas, we ordered the Uni pasta and the Kinoko which is a creamy meat sauce. With the Kinoko you have a choice of pasta, we chose linguine which was a good choice because the pasta itself is thicker and can hold the sauce quite well. The dish is your traditional creamy meat sauce but with Waygu beef. Very nice! The Uni pasta was also a good choice because the Uni was not strong and did not overpower the sauce. There may have not been as much Uni as I would have liked but maybe my sharing partner hogged it all. It is a toss up!

Everything was great and the portions were good. Of all the fusion style restaurants or food trucks that I have been to, I have never had Italian and Japanese together. Trattoria Nakamura-Ya was an excellent introduction to combining both cuisines! So fabs!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,5,4,4,BZ8eERl7NSRflsa0cPaLOg

1338327,2012-08-15,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"First off and foremost..I am a HUGE HUGE fan of Japanese-Italian cuisine. Japanese-Italian cuisine has actually been a long time cuisine done in Japan. Ever since I had the chance to have it there, I fell in love immediately! In my opinion Japanese-Italian food in Japan, I'd hate to say, blows a lot of highly rated italian venues, whether casual or fine restaurants I've had here in America out the water many times over. But again, that is MY opinion.

So I stumbled upon an article that was written about this place earlier this evening. I was convinced to try. It was already nearing 9 p.m. so I was also pleased that this venue closes at midnight.

When I arrived, there was a couple standing out front, wondering if they should come into try, when they saw me hastily walk in, they decided to follow. First off, I have to say, WOW! the place is C-L-E-A-N. Very Clean. Even better..The floor is clean!! I am big on clean floors in a restaurant . Call me slighty snobbish, but if notice dirty floors in a restaurant, I will instantly walk out. I cannot handle it. I wouldn't be able to enjoy my food because I would have already lost my appetite on the way in.

The set up of the interior and decor is simple, that stuff doesnt matter much to me anyway. As long as the place is clean and smells clean, the service is decent, and the food is overall great, that's whats most important.

The italian music they were playing was nice to listen to. The lady waitress came over and brought over a small woven basket. Just like they do it in japan, inside was your silverware, your straw, and your chopsticks, and served with a dinner roll on the side.

I ordered the Linguini Tarako and Scallop pasta and I also ordered the kobe beef carpaccio. You have the option of having a small plate or a big plate for the carpaccio..I went for the small in case I needed room to try another plate of antipasto.

One of my favorite dishes on the planet is carpaccio, and the two places that  Ive been impressed and perfected the carpaccio platter is  1. Mario Batali's Carnevino and Todd English's Olives carpaccio plate, which happens to be my overall favorite .

When I tried the carpaccio here, to say I was really really pleased with the taste! The kobe beef was really fresh, and it .was.good! I like how they used sea salt and not the regular salt, and it was not overly salty. unfortunately it may not be up to par with Carnevino or Olives, but it was nonetheless very very above decent, and I was impressed with it! Very goood carpaccio!!! and tasty!

I snacked on the dinner roll while I was looking at the menu to see what else to order but by the time I was deciding to order something else, my pasta arrived!

The pasta was served on a long plate so looks can be deceiving. Toppled on the pasta was the fresh Tarako, and saw my scallops. I could not wait to try....

OMG! The scallops were so fresh and were not overly cooked!! It was soft and tender, and just downright delicious! There was also just enough Tarako to mix in with your pasta, it turned out just right, not salty at all and just GOOOD. SO GOOD.. The sauce was light but it was filling. Seriously, skip the seasonings, you can forget about it. This pasta didn't need it, it was perfect. The basil, fresh tomato, and a hint of fresh onion and it was so subtle, i forgot that there was any. May I also add that I dont like onions, especially fresh onions in my food?

Overall, let me just end this by saying whoever this Chef is, knows EXACTLY what he is doing!! He is doing it good and doing everything right in this place. I am going back this weekend to bring my husband and let him be the judge. He's harder to impress than I am but I am certain he will love this place! 
I'm looking forward to trying the Uni tomato cream pasta..it just sounds too good, and I will definitely order the Kobe beef carpaccio, only this time I will order myself the bigger plate.

The place is nice, nothing fancy, small but comfortable and practical, very Japanese. Service was good the waitress brought us our beer and food in a timely manner. As we get ready to eat, my friend rubs his chopsticks and tells me to do the same thing, that he read somewhere that it is good luck to do so. I didn't want to burst his bubble and tell him the real reason that you rub the chopsticks is to warm them up and in turn keep the food you're eating warm, so I rubbed the sticks for luck placed them down and started eating with my fork. the food was great we had the Italian spring roll and the  calamari in lemon garlic sauce for appetizers and we shared the manila clams with Torako pasta.

Next.. I ordered the Kurobuta Pork Sausage w/ mushroom and Spaghetti. This was a real treat. It was has ruined all Italian places from this point forward. I am sold on this little place! It was an amazing mix of flavors and spices with noodles that were absolutely done perfectly. It was insane in fat as it was so light in textures but explosive on spices and flavors. Not spicy, but amazing flavors tucking into this sausages and sauce. Insane.. truly one of the best... no I think the best pasta dish I have ever eaten.

Following Yelp recommendation, we got the grilled calamari in butter and garlic sauce. The two of us couldn't finish this dish - we probably are like 3 pieces. The sauce didn't have much flavor- it tasted like just butter and garlic. The calamari was very chewy and didn't taste fresh. For the main courses, we got the Uni pasta in creamy tomato sauce and beef hamburger. The uni pasta was good- the pasta was cooked just right, the sauce was creamy with chunks of Uni. It was a bit too creamy for my taste. Once again, we didn't finish this dish. The beef hamburger was pretty good. My boyfriend liked it a lot.",ES5zM7tyug14vCCvCzMmiQ,0,1,3,CJlkxBj5hBIe9866OnllJw

I was just in Japan 2 weeks ago and had some good stuff!  Funny thing is now I craved Japanese food in US.  While it can be authentic, the little touches make them quite unique that only surfaces here in the States.  So I've been hitting some ramen spots and all in this short trip I made. 

This place is legit! Very close to what you get in Japan. I've tried many wafu pasta in Japan and the states and so far this place is easily in the top of my list. I tried the special A course (18.99 for one appetizer, one pasta, and one drink) is a deal! I had a chicken salad and my wife had grilled veggies. Good flavor on both of them. The dressing was well flavored and the chicken was cooked on order. The veggies were grilled on order and the sauce was very tasty. 

I had Asari and mentai (cod roe) pasta and my wife had a kurobuta (pork) and mushroom pasta.  My pasta was pretty good. It was well flavored and I loved the little addition on perilla leaves and seaweed that really gave nice aroma and kick in your mouth. Her pasta was very tasty as well. The mushrooms had nice texture and the pork was delicious. The sauce had a nice smoky flavor and a hint of heat that made it fun to eat. 

We also had the tiramisu for dessert. It was very smooth and rich at the same time. This is what you expect from a pastry in Japan. Good stuff! =)

Only few things I noticed that I couldn't give this place 5 stars. First, the pasta was little soft. (it wasn't bad by any means but it wasn't al dente.  Perhaps it was but at the time we finished the pasta was pretty soft. It's hard when you get a sauce that is pretty thin though)

Second, my red wine was chilled.  I know Japanese people like to have the red wines chilled but I don't like it. (I know this is getting more popular as another form of drinking the reds, but it was a little tannic since it was chilled...not saying this is all bad. And I'll stop so I won't piss off the wine enthusiasts. =) )

And one last thing, please don't rush us by taking the plates away after 5 seconds of finishing it! We felt really rushed.  But the staffs were wonderful.

Food was definitely yummy, emphasized by the service. For appetizers, the boyfriend had a Garlic Bread, and I had the Bruschetta ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style. I did not know the Garlic Bread slice would come loaded, and I sure wish the boyfriend gave me a taste of it! All good though 'cause I had 3 different types of Bruschetta, and my fave was the one with Wasabi Sauce and Octopus.

Everything was good although I though the baby octopus karaage portion was very small (3 pieces) and a little bit chewier then I really care for. I will probably just get regular calamari next time.

Dunk the bread in the uni sauce! 

Service was outstanding. I think I had three different people waiting on me.

Ever since the day my tongue tasted the wonderful uni spagetti at famous Cafe Hiro in Cerritos, CA, I've dreamt about my favorite fatty subtrates - UNI & carbalicious-al-dente pasta.

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya just opened a couple weeks ago.  So fresh and new that they didn't even have their liquor license when we went.  Hopefully, the license has been approved by now.  Like popular Raku in town, Trattoria Nakamura-ya has a chalkboard of their daily specials.  In this case, it was specials of their pastas and other dishes.  A sucker for advertisement, we went for mostly specials.

On to the food:
Fresh warm rolls - Fluffy, soft, warm.  Slather on a pat of butter...Need I say more?
Hirame Watercress Salad - This was fantastic.  The texture whore in me was jumping for joy.  The crunchy watercress paired with the crunchy deep fried cracker (?) and the tangy sweet dressing was perfect.  After breaking up everything and tossing well as recommended by our server, every bite was a texture sensation
Madai (Red Snapper) Carpaccio - Fresh snapper, crunchy sprouts and a touch of fish sauce.  Unique and delicious.
Uni & Tomato Cream Pasta - Al dente, al dente, perfectly al dente + buttery uni =)
Manila Clam & Torako Pasta - This dish was a touch salty but still enjoyable 
Scallops Sauteed in Marinara Sauce - Scallops are not my favorite seafood, but I could appreciate the tender meat and flavorful sauce.
Tiramisu & Creme Brulee- I love Japanese versions of non-Japanese desserts.  Somehow they make the level of sweetness perfectly to my liking (not too sweet).

This place is tiny and no wonder a lot of people complain about long wait times, what would you expect with only a few tables? 

Some how everything in the planet aligned the first time we went and we sat down immediately. It was the middle of the week just after 5pm, securing a spot before rush hour. 

We got a table at the window and the sun was shining right in to make our food look extra beautiful. I have to admit my hopes were high and knowing there was uni pasta on the menu I really wanted to experience it, especially since I never had it before. Luckily for me it was better than I could have ever hoped for. It was magical...

Bite after bite I closed my eyes and savored every single minute with this dish. I loved it. Pasta was cooked perfectly and that creamy and rich uni was all over it, melting to the warmth of the noodles. Holy shit folks, this was no joke. I could eat this every day! 

My girlfriend ordered spaghetti with meat sauce that was fantastic as well but back to my uni! Wow! I dream of this dish...

The service was really great, all the ladies were extra sweet and loved that we were both newbies and we also ordered Italian spring rolls that were great in flavor but didn't come with any sauce (we suggest they come with sauce). The warm bread was great and the ginger ale was delicious as well. Overall we loved our time here and will definitely be back.

I was hesitant reading some of the reviews but ended up making reservations for a family dinner for the boyfriend. There was a group of seven of us so we had a variety of food,and everything was so good. 

APPETIZERS - we had gotten the mussels: they come in 6 with 3 different flavors. It came in a cute dish and with little pieces of bread to pair it off. They were so good, literally melt in your mouth. The kobe beef carpaccio was also really spankin good! Nice big pieces and I paired it with the bread that was given for the mussels and it was really good. My personal favorite was the calamari! The sauce is garlicy and lemony and they top it off with almonds. It was so good we ordered another. I believe some type of ahi salad was ordered as well and it was very good. Everything good!!!

MAIN - We ordered the uni pasta, black squid ink pasta, miso carbonara, some type of risotto that takes 25 minutes to make, a pasta that had shrimp/crab with tomato sauce, and a chicken with japanese mushrooms and cream sauce. Everything was so frakkin good. The sauces weren't too heavy so it sat well in my stomach. Everyone at the table enjoyed each other's food haha The group of us don't really like heavy sauces, so this was very nice. 

DRINK - we all also had a amber lager asahi. It was good.

The waitress was really nice in explaining everything for us from daily specials to what's popular. Very friendly staff and clean bathrooms too!! I would definitely recommend this place.

Told the waitress that I have tried the Uni and the squid pasta so let her choose 3 pasta dishes and a main course just so I can try something different from this place. (If you're wondering about the Uni pasta its all the way on the bottom of my review.)

Quick summary to my most recent experience:

Wagyu with tomato cream pasta: watered down, cant taste the cream, tastes like canned crushed tomato with wet noodles.

Soy based pasta with mushroom and kurobuta pork: interesting since its like a pasta fused with ramen. Tasted like aglio e olio (olive oil and garlic pasta) mixed with shoyu ramen. So far this was the only good dish.

Japanese Carbonara: liquidy, flavorless, cant taste the egg, at least pasta is cooked perfect.. Took some of the left over home and added a fried egg which made waaay it better..

Kurobuta tonkatsu: pretty decent tonkatsu with cheese inside, under-seasoned..

Desserts: 
Panna cotta was delicious
Back sesame manger was so-so
Tiramisu was meh..

I've been to this trattoria a total of 4 times.
First time I was here I was about 4 years ago and was blown away by the Uni Cream Pasta and the Squid ink pasta. A month later I brought my friends here to show off my newly found ""favorite place"", ordered the same things only to be served watery versions of those dishes..

1971287,2015-10-14,1,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"We kinda relived our Japan experiences this past weekend in Vegas. Seeking out good restaurants serving, that much hated word, authentic Japanese eats, we were pretty successful. Trattoria Nakamura serves up the odd-sounding, but perfect-tasting Japanese-Italian dishes. The Japanese have been known to reinterpret other world cuisines in ways that make sense to them. Trattoria Nakamura is a perfect example of how they do this well.

I've not had too many experiences with Japanese takes on Italian pasta; however, I can tell you that this place prepares these dishes very well. He got the jidori chicken to start and had the wagyu beef pasta for his main. I, of course, ordered the famous sea urchin linguine in tomato cream sauce mmmmmmm.

Enthusiastic thumbs up from this foodie pair! He said the jidori chicken was really flavorful and juicy and unlike anything else he had ever had. The wagyu beef pasta came in a generous serving and really highlighted the American version of Kobe well. My sea urchin pasta was decadent and creamy, but not so rich that I got sick after a few bites. Nope, I pretty much emptied the plate. They were generous with the globs of uni, though they certainly should be with the $26 price tag. With that said, sea urchin pasta prepared this well is very hard to find. I've tried Italian takes on sea urchin pasta, usually ones that didn't include cream in the sauce, and found them too salty and the sea urchin flavor not discernible. Not here. The uni mixed with bites of the noodles and creamy sauce is pure bliss.

Besides the delicious and harder-to-find fare, we also appreciated the friendly service, also characteristic of Japanese establishments. In Japan, we noted how customer service was nice even when tip wasn't expected. In the U.S., tip is very much expected, but you'd never know that from this very kind, sweet server.

Heard about this place from a friend, who highly recommended the uni pasta dish. Came in with the BF and was a bit surprised by the prices on the menu and the variety of dishes- took us a long while to decide on our orders. Judging by the Top 10 List, it's a pretty common issue here.

Server was super sweet and polite and made several suggestions.
After browsing so many Yelp reviews that insisted on the uni tomato cream pasta, we finally caved and decided to split that as our entr√©e and add on a bunch of appetizers to share.

Total came to just under $50 before tip.
Shared the half order of FRIED OYSTERS (just okay), the ITALIAN SPRING ROLLS (didn't care for them at all- poorly executed and overpriced, take it off the menu), and the BRUSCHETTA- three different types served on three small circles of bread, a bit small to share but very tasty: one was seafood, another was avocado and wasabi, and the third was a mozzarella that was to die for. Wish it was served with two pieces of each type rather than just one though, just a hint of each flavor wasn't enough.

And then there was the UNI TOMATO CREAM PASTA, the dish sonnets are written for. I'm not  fan of uni at sushi restaurants but somehow this dish works really, really well- it almost comes off as a rosa sauce with clams, but roughly six billion times better. The uni is sneaky and it's flavor is in every bite but there isn't a large quantity of it in the dish itself. Somehow the extra shakers of red pepper and parmesan don't feel sacrilegious when you shake them on your serving.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,6,5,JBWk5dQqt4EQLJhc3ayziQ

2234977,2014-05-26,1,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"The Skinny: delicious fusion Japanese interpretation of Italian cuisine makes this a unique experience (3.75) service is always solid (4) value: a little pricey for what it is, you do get a bit of a discount when you order their set menus or come in during happy hour 2-5pm that is valid even during weekends. (3.75 rounded up to a four).

We've come here a few times in the past to soak in the Japanese/Italian goodness which is Trattoria Nakamura-Ya. We came in initially when the first opened and while the food was good, it was pretty pricey. Fast forward a few years later, they have instituted a more reasonable set menu pricing as well as a good happy hour which encourages us to come back more frequently.

Let me review their happy hour.

They have a list of at least 5-6 appy items reasonably priced at $3.50, a list of 5-6 pastas for $7.99 and 3 desserts from $2.50-$3.95. This is a much better deal than their usual set menu pricing (consisting of a appy+pasta+drink) which ranges from $17.99-$19.99 depending on varying choices of appy/pasta combination. FYI - their most popular item - Spaghetti Uni Tomato Cream - is not included in the set menus. Although the happy hour is more limiting than the set menu options, you can get a 3-course meal for about $16 including dessert.

So hubs and I tried their happy hour menu yesterday which consisted of fried jidori chicken, Japanese mushroom and chicken salad, Spaghetti tuna and mushroom cream sauce, Spaghetti ""takana' and jidori chicken, soymilk panna cotta and black sesame blanc manger.

The fried jidori chicken was solid. It was lightly friend so it didn't have a great deal of crispiness to it however it was deliciously juicy and lightly sauced. Served with some spring mix greens and some grape tomatoes, it worked well together.

The Japanese mushroom and chicken salad was good as well. I was a little bit scared by the amount of thinly sliced onion on top. However, the slices were ?soaked to dilute the strong flavor which complimented the marinated mushrooms and chicken. Delicate flakes of nori accentuated the umami-ness of the mushroom and unifies the dish as a whole.

We were a bit surprised by the takana/jidori combination spaghetti. The spaghetti came in almost a garlicky broth with some mild saltiness of the pickles breaking through. It was a lighter dish which I really appreciated (my husband wasn't a huge fan though). The flavors reminded me of a pork/winter pickle in a chicken noodle soup broth that my dad makes back home.

Spaghetti with tuna in a mushroom cream sauce was very good. This is what tuna casserole ought to taste like - the light flavors of fresh mushroom/cream permeates the pasta. The only complaint I have is that it could have used a bit more tuna in the dish to make it more balanced.

Dessert was delicious as well. The soymilk panna cotta, although the texture was a little too firm by my tastes to be called a true panna cotta (it's more a pudding), had a good slightly smokey taste from the Okinawa black sugar. The black sesame blanc manger was good - make sure you get your spoon all the way on the bottom of your cup to get the big hit of black sesame.

Overall, the cuisine ranks about a 3.75. Factor in the great service and the discounted pricing during happy hour, you could probably bump it up to 4 stars.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,3,4,pvyA0BX6ZQ2meInNOQd1YA

The food deserves a 3* but the lovely service and reasonable prices make it worth closer to a 3.5.  Their star dishes -- the uni spaghetti and the squid ink pasta -- were both fine but I've had better renditions in the San Francisco area.

* Uni pasta with scallops.   Barely any uni flavor.   The sauce was very similar to that in the uni tomato cream linguine but slightly lighter.  Ok but nothing special.  3/5

* Uni tomato cream linguine.   Slightly more uni flavor than above but still very faint.  They really need to add more uni, or tone down the tomato & cream, to let the uni shine.  3.5/5

* Outside skirt steak.  Maybe it's difficult to eat a normal piece of steak in Las Vegas when there are so many great steak houses around.  Steak wasn't particularly tender nor was the flavor memorable.  Small portion. 
 3/5

* Squid ink spaghetti.   Tasted more of salt than of squid ink.   Was a large mass of black spaghetti without much to relieve it.  3.5/5

* Branzino ceviche.  Rather small portion of raw branzino topped with sweet onion slivers in a very mild dressing.  Too mild for our preferences.  3/5

We ordered a bottle of their Oberon cab which honestly tasted like a cheap bottle of cab; we didn't finish it.

2261988,2012-10-05,1,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"In the depths of Chinatown west of The Strip, there's a small commercial center that has sprouted several Japanese restaurants that have gained major notoriety around town.  It's become a growing 'Little Tokyo' right before our eyes which is pretty exciting to see in real time.

I'll tell you what; even though commercial centers are the bane of this city's cultural identity, actually, I'm not bothered by their facade because it kinda works.  The brick wall with the lantern sconces adds a throw back, old school Italian rustic feel, (which is lot better than other venues have produced).   But with large, untinted windows, there's an openness into the restaurants; with warm lights and action spilling onto the street, it's got character.

The menu came in a highly elaborate and complicated sheet, as well as a prix fixe that kept me confused all night (although in the end, it was a bargain to order the prix fixe).  Unfortunately the Pasta dish that I most desired was not included in the Prix Fixe (believe me, I couldn't figure out the system for the life of me), so I had to order a la carte....

I ordered a little appetizer off the Specials Board of the evening; Idako Karage -Fried Baby Octopus.  Apart from the zombie-esque/Walking Dead physical similarities of these creatures, (made more grotesque by the light batter its encased) I love this dish, because it's where the similarities between Italian and Japanese become evident; both cultures love Seafood and honor it by showcasing its pure flavor..even in fried form.  The Baby Octopus was fresh, soft in texture with just a hint of brine that reminds you where it's from.  With only four pieces, it was just enough for one to satisfy that craving.

The main dish that defines Japanese Italian cuisine is 'Wafu' Pasta - the Japanese love love love Pasta and Wafu Pasta caters to their palate by adding a lot of Seafood that usually is found in traditional Japanese fare.  So with that, the main dish that I had specifically came to enjoy: the Uni Tomato Cream Pasta!  A blend of Tomato and Sea Urchin- definitely a Japanese concept that gives an added complexity to what is a traditional Italian classic. The Uni is definitely background flavor, it's there but subtle-it definitely hits the mouth with a melange of profiles pleasing to the palate.  I loved the fresh cut Basil on top which gave that herb punch, I didn't recognize the added shaved topping, it was crunchy but unnecessary..

Now, what accompanied the dish caused an interesting debate in my head; along with the Pasta came two shakers containing Parmesan Cheese and Chili Flakes.  So the question was: to add these condiments or leave the dish in tact? Sounds way too cerebral right? But with the Uni Tomato Cream Sauce, it could cause an unbalance to subtly of the flavor profile.  It was almost a clash, in a way the chef is saying  'add what you want', which is surprising since it's such a well composed plate (and at $27 for Pasta, you'd think the Chef would be pretty adamant about taste profile).

So I began eating the dish by itself,  I loved the combined flavors of Tomato and Uni, it had great balance, if not light in it's purity.  And although the Pasta wasn't al dente, (a little soft for me) but still delicious and not a huge distraction from the dish.

Consequently,  I shook that shaker full of Parmesan, adding one more component to the profile. The richness of each ingredient became intensely robust, all of a sudden the Tomato Cream was fuller and the pasta was even more addictive.  But it did detract from the subtle Uni, it blanketed the brininess that the Sea Urchin contributed to the sauce. I started an intense search for the pieces of Uni hiding in the Pasta in the hopes of regaining balance.  The dish itself wasn't crowded with whole pieces of luscious Sea Urchin, which made me to believe that it was blended in with the Tomato Cream, but what bits I could find did help.

I dared to be even more adventurous and added the Chili Flakes; I absolutely loved the added heat which gave a punch that to me is awesomeness; but again, it detracted from the Uni.  I hazard to guess that many could have gone overboard with these two condiments and have blown away the subtle, sophistication that the dish really holds.  It was a dilemma; by itself it was rather light but pure, the additions pronounced and elevated it,  but ran the risk of drowning out the purity.  I loved this dish and it was almost worth the high price, but I wished that Chef had taken the lead on this one, either by adding more Uni or deliver a calculated amount of condiments already on the dish...

Overall, I really enjoyed the dishes that I had at Nakamura-Ya and I will most likely return to have the other Pasta dishes as well as the other offerings that they have.  It's a great place to serve what is 'comfort food' to me.

2265605,2011-11-24,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Honestly, the rigatoni with tuna and mozzarella I had and the fettucini with kurobuta sausage my girlfriend had were definitely good, but not as good as I was expecting for $13.50 a plate. 

The dishes tasted well-prepared, but my (not very impressive) dish of rigatoni with only a little bit of shredded tuna and mozzarella felt underwhelming. Although fancily named, the kurobuta sausage tasted fairly unfancy. 

Basically, for pasta with these prices I expect something a little more special.

However, the service was top notch and friendly.",TprC8sujz8MkwuomrqUSiw,2,1,3,hjQd7T3XEvY20eyY-RdKBg

Not in the literally sense peeps no secret ingredient or one hour limit.  The top notch quality of the pasta from every component, overall taste, and presentations was nothing short but elegant. Trattoria stands out. Not many places that I think of in Vegas that menu is sort of hybrid or asian/italian. Not that need more reason too go but it was there two year anniversary heard about half price on some there most popular dishes. My dad was in town visiting so talk about perfect time get my bookmark checked off. It one that why did I wait so long.....Dam me.

Talk about small restaurant. Thankfully my dad and I went early because if went at any other time would have waited long time (not help that anniversary special so knew the place was going too be packed). They do take reservations never knew since it was my first visit. For sure if your planning on going at busy time and on the weekend making reservation good idea. They have counter area also so if going by yourself no worries about taking up whole table. 

We shared appetizers had the Grilled Kurobuta Sausage Ratatouille Sauce and Baby Octopus Karaage. The Grilled Kurobuta Sausage was awesome. I could had whole plate of that grilled and sliced be content. They added the Ratatouille sauce too it added another level too the dish. It felt like sausage and peppers minus the pasta. Winnah. The baby Octopus it was ok. Nothing really special just baby octopus fried but fried nice crispy. 

The star of the show. The Uni Tomato Cream pasta was unreal. Uni if not fresh fresh I never order it at sushi restaurant. I am not that big fan of the texture and so so with the taste. Fresh Uni Huge fan you can taste the difference. Add the tomato cream and Uni perfect blend of goodness.  Adds another level of depth too the sauce cooking out the Uni and all the juices break down Uni essence in every bite. The pasta is cooked too perfect al dente. The portion size is good. Surprised but its heavier dish so by the time finish no room for dessert. One dish always wanted too taste since bookmarked and beyond impressed more like blown away.

I must admit, I was a little skeptical when my friend decided to take me here for lunch. But I was hungry, pasta sounded good, at the time and I trusted my friend's taste in food. The place isn't that big and it wasn't packed at all. We were greeted and seated right away. My friends who frequent this place knew exactly what to order and I let them to it. 

We started off with the italian spring rolls, bruschetta, and their risotto. All were really tasty with the Italian spring rolls, basically mozzarella sticks, being my favorite of the three. 

For the entrees we all shared it family style. This included the Miso Carbonara, Spaghetti tuna and mushroom in white cream sauce and fettuccini ""kinoko"" creamy meat sauce. All were sooooo goood. I love pasta and the Japanese twist on it was surprisingly pleasant. I'd order any of those dishes again with the fettuccini and the spaghetti being my faves of the three.

It's a very quiet restaurant, but all the servers are friendly and helpful. It's perfect to go on with dates (or double dates). The only thing I was sad about was they no longer serve Limonata, but besides that, I have no complaints whatsoever.

2368036,2013-06-30,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"I'm only rating this based on food. I first have to mention this. I think the chefs need to make some humble pie for the waitress. She snickered at us, made smart comments, very snobby, very matter-of-fact but really she's young and doesn't know any better. As we were leaving my fiance said she gave me a dirty look at what I was wearing, as I was leaving the restaurant and he caught her. She then looked the other way. In Japan... customer service is VERY important. As well as being POLITE and to be very humble. No waitress anywhere should be snobby. She was helpful and was passionate about the food. It was only her attitude that was the only negative in the restaurant. 

My fiance and I came to the realization that it is unavoidable that we are foodie snob. I personally am a sushi nazi and my comfort food is italian. The first restaurant dish I remember as a kid, was raw baby octopus salad and I've been to Japan. So I know my japanese cuisine. My fiance knows italian like the back of his hand probably because he's been to Italy so many times and being from the UK. So this was the perfect place to go to. 

Starter
We ordered the Octopus carpaccio and was disappointed only that we didn't order 6 pieces instead of 4. The sauce and octopus was prepped perfectly, and the dried garlic slices were a perfect touch. It given the dish a great  balance.

The bruschetta was probably our least favorite probably because I'm not a huge fan on anchovies. If they optioned... truffle oil... that would be great. Or maybe the anchovy would have been more desirable if I had eaten it the reverse order-we should have asked or the waitress should have mentioned that. 

 On that note... I think the waitress should have had some food knowledge about japanese and italian cuisine. We asked if there was gnocchi on the menu and she had no idea what that was and scoffed at us. I wanted to ask her more things about the menu such as ... is the pasta made fresh here but ... we figured she wouldn't even know. Can I also mention... obnoxious? 

Soft shell crab was divine but it was oily. It wasn't heavily doused with balsamic sauce which was great because we really wanted to taste the crab. I'll definitely want to try making this dish at home. 

Mains
Spaghetti Uni Tomato Sauce... was the most delicious creation of spaghetti I have ever tasted. I never want to go marinara ever again. Actually it was more of a white sauce.  If I had the choice of the last dish on earth... this is it. When I finished my bowl... I wanted to kiss the cooks! Home run.
Linguini Shrimp Scallop pasta... it didn't compare to the Spaghetti Uni so.. any comment regarding it... would be biased. We finished every last of it regardless. It was delish.

Dessert
Creme Brulee... my fiance felt it was the best creme brulee he's ever tasted and he's been to France... many many times and he did not hesitate so say it was the best. While they were torching the top the smell of cooked sugar filled the restaurant. Creme de la Creme.
Green Tea panicotta... not too sweet not too bland. It was a perfect balance with the red bean paste. It was my kind of dessert because it wasn't overly sweet like the typical italian restaurant. 

Overall... completely blown away. We were stuffed but we wanted to order so much more. We had to control ourselves because we knew from now on every time we were in Vegas... we were going to stop here no matter what.",v0xgWboziLCKNvtZ8h3E1A,1,0,5,ujeYPn65DerJGd0C9mbeog

It had such a delicate yet savory flavor. The appetizer was a bruschetta dish which was quite delicious as well.

Keywords to describe the Japanese: polite, punctual, detail oriented and high quality. I find their Japanese culture characteristics true and it's reflected on their foods. And that's how I described my experience eating pasta in Trattoria Nakamura-Ya. Can Japanese pasta become a delicate dish? The answer is Yes! 

First, they gave us the warm home made bread (on the house) and butter. The bread was fluffy and sweet. 

1. Miso shio white wine broth linguini with Manila Clam. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not soggy or too soft. The miso white wine broth was delicious! I LOVE this dish.

2. Ikasumi squid pasta. This pasta was indeed delicious! Who knew the octopus ink can made the pasta taste so out of this world. Warning: ika squid ink is a potent pigment and it will leave your teeth blackened for a while after you ate this :-)

3. My favorite was the Uni Tomato pasta. Okay, I love uni and I love pasta. This combination was a perfect marriage! Love the creamy texture from the uni and the balance of fresh tomato taste. 

4. The last one was desert. We tried NakamuraYa's 3 Sampler - basicaly a sampler of their best deserts: soymilk panna cotta, black sesame blancmange, and tiramisu. I thought the black sesame and tiramisu were pleasant; the soymilk panna cotta was a bit bland. 

Their lunch menu prices are such a great deals!

- Marya Mannes

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is probably what Mannes was talking about when she referenced fusion...I mean after all, who else in Vegas has brought Japanese and Italian together as beautifully?

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is famous for two dishes: 
1.Linguini ""Uni"" Tomato Cream consisting of premium ""Uni"" (sea urchin) cooked in rich tomato cream sauce and served over linguini pasta with basil and saffron
2. Spaghetti ""Ikasumi"" Squid Ink consisting of saut√©ed calamari and diced tomato in squid ink sauce, served over spaghetti. While both are good the Linguini ""Uni"" Tomato Cream is outstanding.

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya was the first place I tasted an uni cream sauce at...since then I've had it at a couple other places. But I'm not sure that anyone in town does it any better than Trattoria Nakamura-Ya. The first time I had the Linguini ""Uni"" Tomato Cream was also the first time that I enjoyed uni. Uni is an acquired taste for sure. It took me a few years of trying it at various restaurants before I started truly enjoying it on its own in dishes like uni nigiri. I love that Trattoria Nakamura-Ya makes it more approachable in this pasta dish, but I also appreciate that true fans of uni typically adore this dish as well.

I've been here twice and have only had the occasion to taste a few items on the menu. My favorite being the Linguini ""Uni"" Tomato Cream with added Scallops from the Specials board. This is a lovely 5 star dish for me. The linguini was cooked perfectly al dente and uni and tomato cream are a perfect marriage. The basil and saffron finish the dish wonderfully--rounding out the flavors and providing clear freshness.

There are a lot of other dishes to explore here, but problem lies with the Linguini ""Uni"" Tomato Cream being as good as it is...I don't see myself skipping out on this dish and thus limiting my ability to try a lot of other options. The last time I came in was with my love and we also shared Grilled Vegetables in Bagna Cauda Sauce and Chikodai (Cubehead) Carpaccio. The Grilled vegetables were fine, but not really special to us in any way. The Chikodai Carpaccio on the other hand was delightful. I don't recall having this variety of fish before in a sushi form, but I enjoyed it quite a bit and I will certainly order one of the Carpaccios offered on the specials board again. 

The ambiance leaves a little to be desired. At this proceeding and quality of food, I'd prefer a little more attention to the dinning space which is rather plain--consisting fir several 2 top and 4 top tables with chairs...almost like a mini cafeteria. Then again, did I mention Uni for the win...?",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,15,9,4,xqzQL-nkHe3L_FBBNYDt5w

Tomo was there again and she remembered us which I always appreciate! She was very knowledgeable about the specials and the menu in general. She helped us decide on appetizers with the specials board. We got an ikura style carpaccio with some kind of white fish and Japanese bruschetta to start. The bruschetta wasn't at all what we were expecting but in a good way! There were three different kinds. One with some cheese and veggies and wasabi mayo and my favorite one was the orangish on in the picture below.

It is nestled in Chinatown right next to Monta and Raku (great places, as well).  Came in for dinner, a party of 4, and were seated right away.  The place is quaint and intimate, yet casual and easygoing.  The server was super sweet, explained the menu, and was very attentive.  For starters we ordered the kobe beef carpaccio and salmon carpaccio.  The kobe beef carpaccio was served beautifully simple--pounded paper thin slices of kobe beef, drizzled with a extra virgin olive oil/ lemon sauce, topped with capers, arugula, and shavings of parmesan.  Really tasty!  It was a little on the chewy side, but the flavor never got too gamey, so I really liked it.  The salmon carpaccio was served up on top of a bed of mixed greens, topped with a citrus sauce, and thin slices of kiwi and oranges.  Also very tasty!  

Onto the main courses.  I ordered the squid ink spaghetti, of course.  It has a wonderful garlic flavor.  The hints of squid ink were never overpowering and was perfectly complimented by the few pieces of basil that garnished the pasta.  The pieces of squid were perfectly cooked--not too chewy.  

Now, I can't remember the exact names of these dishes, but I'll try my best to describe them lol.  My boyfriend got the shrimp and scallop linguine served in a white cream sauce.  I liked it, but he said it tasted too ""seafoody"" towards the end.  My friend had the shrimp and asparagus spaghetti served in marinara.  That had a strong asparagus flavor, but delicious as well.  He finished the entire dish; I'm assuming he liked it.  My other friend ordered the uni tomato cream spaghetti.  A little daunting because she's not a fan of uni, my friend was a little hesitant to order this dish, but our server gave it some rave reviews and said it was one of the best sellers.  The uni flavor was not overpowering at all.  Just enough.  Creamy and delicious.  It would be even better if they had served it with another seafood element, like shrimp or langoustines (yum!).

Finally, we ordered the black sesame pudding and blanc manger.  It was so satisfying at the end of the meal.  The black sesame pudding was somewhat reminiscent of red bean.  It was perfectly complimented by the creamy, sweet blanc manger ladled on top of the pudding and the fresh strawberry and blackberry that garnished the dessert.  

I believe the bill came out to about $125ish without tip; I had also ordered a glass of red wine.  Not bad for the four of us, I would say.  I was definitely glad I gave up my no-pasta rule for this lovely meal!",t2nPIKI2iy8VG_cfFD0Vmg,2,3,4,MYWZDGUq0U109aj1cDqp0Q

We are fortunate to have dined here during their 3 year anniversary celebration on November 6, 2014. To celebrate, they offered half-off deals on their most popular dishes and the chef also created a few special menu items specifically for their anniversary.

Of course we already knew what we wanted to try...their wildly famous, yet typically expensive, pasta dishes!

Linguini Uni Tomato Cream $26.95 (anniversary price: $13.50) - The plentiful, meaty uni danced in ribbons of linguini. The pasta was cooked al dente and the flavor of the tomato cream sauce was spot on; it really complimented the delicate flavor and creaminess of the uni. You probably didn't know this, but I'll let you in on a little secret about me, I'm actually not too crazy about uni, but thanks to this pasta of my dreams, it really opened up my eyes to the tastiness that is uni. I have absolutely no complaints other than why haven't I tried them sooner!? Flavor rating: 5/5

Spaghetti ""Ikasumi"" Squid Ink $19.95 (anniversary price: $10) - I was very impressed with how much garlic flavor I picked up with each bite. The chef used just the right amount of the squid ink to allow the flavor to develop into the spaghetti. The squid ink had a lot of depth to it; it also had subtle notes of the sea which was mellow and lovely. The dark black pasta turned our lips and teeth black so just be mindful of that when you are slurping away (It's rather adorable if you ask me) Flavor rating: 5/5

Green Mussels Escargot 3 Ways $8.50 - 2 of each: Sweet miso, parsley garlic butter and mentaiko. The mussels were prepared with a lot of care and cooked just right. My personal favorite was the parsley garlic butter, the sweet miso presented a unique twist, the mentaiko was interesting and also my date's favorite. Flavor rating: 4/5

Now I know why their popular pasta dishes run so steep; it's because they don't cut corners on flavor or ingredients. Their anniversary celebration offered such a great deal we really didn't want to pass it up, but deal or no deal this restaurant is insanely delicious!!! They really outdid themselves in quality, taste, and service. I am absolutely in love and can't wait to come back to savor their luxurious pastas and maybe even try something new!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,9,4,5,atf2ML9FwVmvULgnrkRuHA

2685945,2017-12-06,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Really good Italian-Japanese fusion fare that's worth the trek from the Strip if you're a tourist who's already rented a car or is willing to jump on a taxi or Lyft. 

To start, an appetizer of fried, herb-salted ""jidori"" (free range) chicken was a nice way to make a dent in some hunger I'd been building all day. It wasn't excessively breaded or fried although it felt just a tad salty. Next, the spaghetti miso carbonara (pancetta topped with fried ""gobo"" (burdock), green onions, white sesame seeds, and ""miso"" yellow cream sauce was absolutely delicious - a clever way of blending both Italian and Japanese flavors. Again, just a tad salty, but so so yummy nevertheless. For dessert, the black sesame blancmange (black sesame milk pudding served with strawberry sauce) was yet again a clever marriage of Japanese black sesame flavors with a fruity strawberry glaze on top.

The fact that you can combine an app, main dish, and a drink in a pick-your-own prix fixe dinner makes perfectly reasonable prices even more of a good value. I added my dessert and an extra beer on top of the prix fixe and the entire bill was still far better than what I'd see at overpriced Strip casino restaurants. Service was reasonably efficient too.

The interior is quite compact, so reservations are a good idea at peak times (weekend nights). All in all, a great way to break out of the Strip bubble and try out a solid local, independent establishment.",bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,2,1,4,E9mMOK5rfFWtuSvs9qhp4g

1. Baby octopus karaage was chewy as hell without any creamy sauce to combat the oiliness of the deep fry. Move on.
2. ""Bruschetta"" comes in 3 ways, the best is with avocado, octopus, and wasabi mayo (awesome), spicy cod roe with tuna (solid), and mozzarella with anchovy oil (needed salt).
3. Mussels ""escargot style"" was best in the original wine+butter+parsley form, followed by spicy roe, and even the sweet roe was decent.
4. Fettuccine with salmon and salmon roe in cream sauce needed more pepper...or cheese...or something. Something was needed to bring this dish together, I just don't know what. Not memorable.
5. Scallops on linguine in an uni tomato cream sauce is AMAZING. So much flavor. I could eat this every day.
6. Dessert sampler showed a really good soy milk Panna Cotta with deep flavored Okinawa black sugar syrup, an even better black sesame pudding with strawberry drizzle, and a very pedestrian tiramisu.

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is a fusion eatery combining two of my favorite world cuisine: Italian and Japanese. Located in a small plaza on Decatur and Spring Mountain, just a little before going into Chinatown, is a different type of culinary experience with a variety of food served that you probably won't get to try anywhere else in Vegas. The plaza was small, like I mentioned, but parking was easy to find and not so crowded during the day of time I went. Inside, it was average-small, but quaint and had a Japanese decor charm around. My friends and I sat to a table that was a few feet away from the kitchen so we were able to see slightly of the action going on with how the chefs prepared the food. My only turn off was I wished they cranked up the air conditioning! We started with an appetizer which was baked mussels cooked three ways served escargot-styled that included mini toast bread on the side. Seriously though, where else can you find that? The mussels, I felt, seemed fresh but cooked just right as you bite into it and get that rubbery, soft texture like you find in mussels. It was also oily/greasy but that's what gave it big flavors. Plus, they didn't have that briny seafood aftertaste which I thought was a nice bonus. Although, they were hard and chewy, each bite you took into it gave it a burst of juicy, flavor goodness. Unlike any other green mussels appetizer dish I've ever ordered, for sure. For my entree, I opted to get their best seller, the uni tomato linguini, and I can see why since the uni and tomato sauce blends so well together. The taste was creamy and the noodles slippery so there was slurping involved when I ate it. I liked the delicate flavor without having that typical pasta sauce that's always too heavily rich or thick. Nevertheless, the uni or tomato sauce didn't overpower one another, so there was balance. By the end, I really wanted to try a dessert course but unfortunately was way too full to eat another bite. I even had to get my uni pasta taken to go!

I got the Prix Fixe Dinner $17.99 which consists of choice of appetizer (#1-#15) and a pasta dish (#36-#45) and a drink (choice of Pabst beer, Domino Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, soda, Calico, Icee Oolong Tea or Hot Green Tea. 

For my appetizer, I got #10 the Snow Crab Meat Salad. It was a spring mix greens topped with snow crab, radish sprouts, Parmesan cheese with French dressing. Very light and refreshing. 

For my pasta I got #42 Kinoko Creamy Meat Sauce. You get to choose your pasta of spaghetti, linguini, fettuccine, or rigatoni. The meat sauce had wagyu hamburger meat with assorted mushrooms in a tomato Cream sauce.   I got the rigatoni and my friend got it with linguini. I wish I got it with linguini instead.

The Asian fellow who drove us down there was wearing one of those SARS medical masks they used to wear out in China back in the day.  His voice was a little muffled behind the cloth, but he asked me if I had ever eaten at Trattoria Nakamura-Ya.  I asked him what the hell he was talkin' bout because I never heard of such a thing.

Long story short, he told me it was a Japanese-Italian fusion joint right next to Raku...and he said it was the best food in Chinatown.  When an Oriental man tells me it's the best, I have to believe he knows what he's sayin', but I also thought his parents could be the owners...or maybe he was a busboy, ya know?  Or maybe he had one of those kick-back deals the cabbies have with the local massage parlors?

Fast forward four months upon my next visit and I found myself wanting to eat up in Chinatown (more so because I wanted to visit a bar called Irene's just west on Spring Mountain a bit).  I remembered this lad and what he said, so I gave it a shot.

All I can say is that it was everything this dude spewed about and more.  I really liked that I got there about ten minutes after they opened and I was the only one inside until I paid my check (it's very small in there).

Octopus Carpaccio with Wasabi Mayo and (their specialty...$27) Linguini 'Uni' Tomato Cream.  I done died and went to heaven...and I don't really believe in the heaven, you see?

She was also more than happy to split all our checks and remembered each of our orders correctly. Little things were also taken into consideration like they give you a nice moist toilette if you order the squid ink pasta because your mouth will be stained with ink from eating it. So nice :)

The place is a bit dark though. But it's not so dark that you cant see the food. I love the open kitchen so you can see what they are doing behind too. 

Japanese/Italian is well done in this place utilizing the both Japanese and Italian ingredients respectfully. I got the squid ink pasta and it's really good.

If we were to ever move out of Vegas, we would genuinely miss this place. It's one of the places in Vegas that has made us feel at home. I love how the restaurant is never too full and if we find ourselves wanting to go out for dinner on a Friday night, I can count on this place to have an open table. Seriously, I really don't know why there aren't more people here. The waitresses who are usually here are very attentive and do a great job explaining the dishes to newbies.

-Miso Carbonara
-Spaghetti with Uni Cream Sauce (since it's pricey, we only order when we're with a larger group)
-Wagyu Hamburger Steak (husband's go-to entree)
-Kurobuta Sausage & Kinoko Mushroom Cream Risotto (Order this as soon as you sit down so it's ready with the rest of your meal)

On a Saturday night we surprisingly had no wait for a table. It was so hard to choose from the menu because everything sounded so delicious and I wanted to try all the dishes.

For starters we had the octopus carpaccio and soft shell crab. I've primarily known carpaccio in beef or tuna, so octopus was a nice twist. It was sliced thin enough that I didn't notice a chewy texture which is pretty standard with octopus and the wasabi mayo complimented it nicely. The soft shell crab was a success for both me and my husband. The portioning was a little small and left me wanting more. The balsamic dressing that was left behind was perfect for dipping bread into. 

Our main dishes were the miso carbonara and fettuccini Salmon & ""Ikura"" pastas. The fettuccini was our second favorite, but for some reason that night I was really craving fettuccini. The noodles were swimming in a rich white cream sauce, mixed with pan-fried salmon pieces, and topped with salmon roe. It was a dish that was put together well, but I definitely would want to try other things on the menu before coming back to this one. The miso carbonara, though, was prize-worthy. The miso sauce just added the right touch of Asian flavors to the dish.

On Spring Mountain near Decatur, this small lot became a jewel for eateries....Raku, Sweets Raku, Kabuto....just to list a few, and recently I had a chance to dine at Trattoria Nakamura-ya when my love brought me here for dinner. The quiet gentleman working behind bar is chef Nakamura-San. It was a pleasure to meet him, as well as the two professional waitresses who served us, made good recommendations, and were genuinely easy to converse with. 

First they brought us warm bread with butter, it was average. We ordered two dishes from the daily special chalk board, Chikodai carpaccio and Uni tomato cream with wild grilled scallop. Chikodai carpaccio was well balanced and surprisingly fresh and delightful with a nice vinegary flavor from capers and a soft undertone of salt. 

Next we had the Grilled vegetables with Bagna Cauda sauce which was composed of cherry tomato, zucchini, mushroom, asparagus and garnished with bright Italian parsley. We used the parsley to enhance the flavor of all these grilled vegetables... Grilled vegetables that were well covered with the Bagna Cauda sauce. This is a traditional Italian warm, creamy sauce made with garlic, anchovies, olive oil and butter. It's rather rich for my taste. 

The last dish we loved was Uni dish. It is a staple on their menu already for $26.95 but without grilled scallop which we enjoyed immensely. Scallop was beautifully sliced and cooked perfectly tender. The star of the dish is the Uni cream sauce-wonderfully covering all the strings of linguine with ample flavor.

First, The kitchen was completely understaffed. I came in for dinner on Sunday night with 3 others and our total dinner time took us almost 2 hours. I asked our server to bring everything out together but our dishes came individually with about 10-15 minutes in between. We pretty much had no other choice but to share, which we do anyway, but I wanted all of our food to come at once.

Second, The servers were really nice but lacked communication.
Example: My party had finished our second dish and was waiting for our third. One of the servers came to pick it up and asked if we wanted any dessert. She was very polite, but where was our food..........?

Third, there was only ONE dish that was good. Here's what we ate:

Kobe Beef Carpaccio: The quality of the meat itself was great. I would've liked it if it had been cut a little thinner though. The dish as a whole was a little inconsistent. Some parts had too much or too little of one thing or another. The Parmigiano Reggiano was also a little too mild for my taste.

Uni Tomato Cream Spaghetti: This dish is that ONE good dish I was talking about. This dish was delightful. They didn't go cheap on the uni, and the uni was fresh. The tomato cream was nice and light. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente.

Kurobuta Tonkatsu: The sauce was watery and bland. The meat itself needed more seasoning as well. I liked that they put cheese inside of it, but this dish was a complete fail. Very disappointed seeing how this dish was featured in one of their articles.

Fettuccine Prosciutto Carbonara: I literally had to force this down. I was the most unhappy with this dish because it took the longest and tasted the worst. The pasta was undercooked and tasted like it had been boiled in unsalted water. The sauce had NO FLAVOR. The only thing OK about this dish was the prosciutto. The chef obviously didn't taste this dish when he/she sent it out of the kitchen.

I am very unhappy with my experience at this restaurant. I was really excited when I looked this place up and my mouth started watering when I saw the photos and read the reviews. I wish I could've had as good of an experience as all the other Yelpers. I guess it was just a bad day for this place.

They had their 5 year anniversary special today which included the squid ink pasta for $11.99. I've always wanted to try squid ink pasta so I dragged my friends here for dinner. We arrive around 5:45 and there was no wait but the restaurant was packed. 

We had no idea what to get because we did not want 2 squid ink pastas. They have a chalkboard of popular menu items at the front near the cash register which was helpful. My friend wanted their rib eye but saw that it had white truffle and he isn't a fan of truffle. He went with their skirt steak ($19.99) instead. My gf and I shared the squid ink pasta and got the dinner special for ($21.99). The dinner special let us pick an appetizer, a main dish and a drink which included beer, tea, wine or soda. 

After we ordered, some hot bread rolls came out with butter on the side. My friend thought they were made in the restaurant but I wasn't too sure about that. Regardless, hot bread with butter is always a good way to start off a meal!

Service was definitely a 6/5! The restaurant is very small. They have a small bar area that could probably seat 5-6 people and tables are pretty close to each other. I counted 5 servers who were busy all the time despite the restaurant being so small. Everyone working was Japanese (I think) and greeted us and thanked us after we left, in Japanese. Our waters were always refilled and they took off finished plates from the table pretty quickly. 

4/5 calamari ($6.95) OMG if you love garlic I would highly recommend this dish. It comes with a lemon butter garlic sauce and is topped with sliced almonds. Very strong garlic flavor. That sauce is amazing, I should have saved some bread to dip it in the sauce. Calamari was cooked perfectly, not too chewy. But, the portion is a bit on the small side. 

3/5 the kinoko jidori chicken is one of their top sellers. I misread that it was a main dish and kept expecting pasta. I was not expecting the dish to be a small portion (as I thought it came with pasta). The chicken was very soft but I felt that it was on the salty side. The sauce was ok. 

3/5 I felt like the squid ink pasta (normally $19.99) was just garlic butter pasta tossed with squid ink. I don't think I will order it again. It does leave your mouth Black so make sure you wipe it well! They did give us some face wipes though. 

I did not get to try the skirt steak but my friends enjoyed it. Again, the portion is small (but it's Kobe beef) but he said it was super soft. I felt like he needed a side of rice with his steak but he enjoyed it with some our squid ink pasta.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,2,0,4,UirCYTzE-JI1V8B48ObOBA

I have never had a Japanese/Italian fusion meal before and Trattoria Nakamura-Ya definitely sets the bar high for this type of fusion (to me haha). 

For appetizers, I have tried the sausage ratatouille and all I can say is that it was good. 
For the main dishes, I have had the Spaghetti Kurobuta and Kinoko and the Fettuccini Salmon and Ikura but I tend to order the latter out of habit. 
Now for dessert -my most favorite part of the meal- I would say the black sesame blanc manger is amazing. It's quite similar to a panna cotta but there's a difference in thickness. The blanc manger had a thin layer of strawberry sauce on top which I wish they also serve on top of their soy milk panna cotta. The only dessert I don't like is the tiramisu just because the coffee is stronger and very bitter compared to what I have had at other places.",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,8,7,5,8pxDXNG8piGKkfim2ZKwRg

After seeing everyone's review, it was hard to pass up on the Kobe Style beef carpaccio, and Uni spaghetti. My husband got a pork katsu cordon blue type dish which was not bad either. But if you like uni, you cannot pass the uni spaghetti. The flavor was phenomenal. It was quite heavy in the sense that half of the plate made me feel super full. But I wasn't planning on letting that going to waste since we were about to board a plane shortly after; I ended up eating the whole thing. I was so satisfied.

Good thing they took reservations and my friend shipped it in!

We all went for the prix fixe and there's levels if you want to go for a pasta or main course.  I had to order the uni tomato cream pasta since that's what everyone gets and it looked delicious.  It was $6 more.   After tax it came out to $32-35.  So a little pricey but it was good.  i would probably prefer my pasta to be a little more al dente but the sauce was very good...slightly rich with creamy uni-ness.  Shhhh- if you ask for extra bread they'll bring it to you and you can mop up the rest of your sauce up with it. hehe

I really loved the fried octopus appeteizer.  the octopus carpaccio looked awesome.  i will come back and opt for the $17.99 prix fixe and not upgrade.  With this menu you can order between 15-16 apps and 15-16 pasta entrees.  It's served with a beer/wine/soda for $17.99.

I wasn't intrigued by any of the appetizers but I wanted to try their tomato cream sauce so I chose the tomato Farsi gratin and for my entree the miso carbonara. They also brought out a plate of sweet bread rolls and a basket filled with chopsticks and utensils. 

Bread rolls- the bread was sweet and accompanied by hard squares of butter 

Tomato Farsi gratin- octopus and squid were rubbery; tomato cream sauce was flavorful. In this dish I did not see the fusion of Japanese and Italian ingredients 

Miso carbonara- I was envisioning a creamy carbonara sauce infused with miso flavor 
and what I got was a watery sauce containing minimal green onions and bacon which did not enhance the flavor.The taste of this dish did not give me the Japanese Italian integration I was looking for because I could not taste the miso

I shared Squid ink Spaghetti, Salmon & Ikura Fettucine and Black sesame blanc manger.

This was the first time trying squid ink spaghetti, yum! I don't know how to describe the flavor to someone who hasn't eaten this before. 

The salmon & ikura dish was very well balanced. The sauce alone, would almost not salty enough. But that's what the ikura is there for, and then you got your salt flavor. I was very impressed at the balance of salmon, salt and cream sauce. If I had to dock any points, it would be on this dish. The salmon didn't seem fresh. It definitely wasn't bad, but it had that ""fishy"" flavor from non-fresh fish meat.

The sesame blanc dessert was so well balanced too! The black sesame seed at the bottom of the cup isn't very sweet, but you get that sesame flavor. Then there's the middle layer that's some sweet. Then there's the thin top strawberry sweet layer. That top layer is almost too sweet, but it's great mixing or going back and forth with the low sweet black sesame at the bottom.

The restaurant specializes in Japanese ingredients used in Italian preparations. You'll find Uni (Sea Urchin) Pasta which is arguably one of their most popular dishes as well as calamari served escargot style. The Uni Pasta will run you about $25 btw.

All of their dishes are pretty unique and for the most part taste delicious. Although some items on the menu aren't stellar in terms of their uniqueness value. I would recommend going for their prix fixe menu which ranges from $20-30? It's a three course meal that comes with a beverage pairing. I always substitute wine or beer with a British Ginger Ale that they carry.

THIS GINGER ALE IS AMAZING!!!!!!!
I felt that this statement deserved its own paragraph.

In closing, I find that I always come here spending a little more than I bargained for. The portions are a bit like tapas, so if you're a big eater, you'll need to order a lot to get full.

This place is really small (can only seat about 32) but cutely decorated. 

We ordered Bruschetta Nakamura (with 3 different toppings) and Wild Fish Kara-age for appetizers. The bruschetta had octopus with wasabi, tuna with cream sauce, mozzarella cheese with anchovies. This was an okay dish, but I will not order it again. However, the wild fish kara-age was delicious! It was in their special menu of the night. It had so much flavor in it. 

We ordered Konito Meat Cream Sauce and a carbonara sauce with tobiko. The Konito was good, it was like the Japanese version of spaghetti bolognese. My bf had the carbonara sauce was a tad heavy for me, but when you mix it with the tobiko, everything becomes balanced since the tobiko was flavored with wasabi and yuzu. It came out to be a great dish. My bf was raving about it the next day when he had the leftover for lunch.

The carpaccio was too thickly cut, ruining the texture that should make a carpaccio. Uni Tomato cream pasta was beautiful and tasted great. However, after that dish, our Kurobuta pork took another 20 minutes. This dish needed some more seasoning. Our friend at the table, who is not at all a foodie or cook, said the tomato sauce seemed a bit watery. The server thought we were done and asked if we had room for dessert. ??? We told her we were still waiting for the parma prosciutto carbonara. That was another 25 minutes. We don't mind waiting for good food. But this pasta was so disappointing. The noodles were undercooked, the sauce was not flavorfully seasoned, and the prosciutto was barely dressing the pasta. Our non-foodie non-cook said he probably could have made something better than that pasta. We went in at 6:45 and didn't get out until 8:45, of which more than three-quarters of the time went to waiting. From the first dish (the carpaccio) to the last dish, there was a time difference of 75 minutes. 

Two people in our party didn't catch their flight and had to take the bus back, so I might be a bit biased because of that. Either way, other than that, it would have only gone up to a three. Ugh... sigh... 

I see the high ratings and I'm very disappointed because I think that people really want to like this place because Italian-Japanese sounds like such a cool combination. I really want it to be, but the food has to taste better. If they're still around in six months, I will try them again. I hope they get more staff in the kitchen and that they coordinate their service better. Their servers are really nice, but it's funny that we got asked if we wanted dessert when we were still waiting for another entree.

Would have to say it was SUPER dark in there.. it seemed like no difference of lighting from outside to inside ahahhha 

One thing that was really apparent was the foul smell that would not go away which we assumed is the bad piping system for the sewer or something but it was only in this place which seemed to be coming directly from the bathroom & it filled the whole place possibly because there was no one there either to distract the smell?.... it definitely affected the taste of the food...

It was DERICIOUS!!  although because of the smell of the place it was a bit hard to taste the uni... but the moment we walked out of the place it was like a kick in the face of uni cloud! We packed some Togo & ate it at home & you can taste the uni like AMAZINGLY perfect =]

For uniqueness and service, Nakamura might be in the top 10 for off strip eats in town.  It's a little pricy for what you get, but remember the base of each meal is Japanese which runs high.

We shared octopus carpaccio (very high quality), sun-dried tomato/radish salad (great starter), and a few pasta dishes.  The main meal seemed a little bland compared to the great appetizers.  The main reason was too much spaghetti and barely any protein or other accompaniments in the dish.

Parking is a bit of a struggle but I suggest parking in the lot cuz I've heard of car break-ins in the area. Trattoria Nakamura-Ya (I'll start abbreviating that to TNY...) has a pretty expansive menu of pastas and other entrees. They have a lunch special 7-days a week but the specials end earlier in the day on the weekends. Specials are around $8-$10 depending on the dish you order.

First, I suggest started with the garlic bread. Toasted baguettes with chunks of garlic and oil and bits or prosciutto. I think this was actually the best part of the meal.

For the entree, I ordered the Jidori Chicken pasta in a light tomato cream sauce. I thought he chicken chunks were nice and tender and not dry. The sauce was light but still had flavor. The pasta (spaghetti) was cooked well with a bite still. I think it needs a bit more flavor but a safe choice.

I got to try others that my friends ordered including the Miso Carbonara and Fettuccine Kinoko. I enjoyed the strong flavor of the Kinoko but the Miso Carbonara was a dud. It was so light that I felt that all I tasted was the taste of cooked spaghetti.

The food was decent depending on what you order but the service was great. The server was attentive and you can feel the detail the chefs put into the dishes they produce. The popular dishes such as the uni pasta and squid ink look very promising but also comes at a price ($22-$28) but I might take the plunge next time.",Vi_qBZBXgkNbsO1qXXkoVw,5,5,4,YY4mLxTd-B3S-FgAhv3l1w

1. bruschettas (anchovy oil with mozzarella, octopus and avocado with wasabi mayo, & tuna and spicy cod roe. One of each for small order and two of each for large.).

2. squid ink spaghetti - try this! Yes, the color might turn you off and probably not a dish of choice for a first date haha but this is one of those simple dishes that has extra dimension of flavor. The squid ink gives that umami-y, oceany note to the al dente spaghetti. Trattoria Nakamura-ya did a really good version.

 3. linguini with scallop, shrimp, and salted cod rod. Creamy, rich flavor melted perfectly with the linguini. The fresh seafood balanced the dish.

My roommate and I shared a few things.
- Nakamura bruschetta
- Fettuccini with salmon and roe
- Miso carbonara

The bruschetta was a fun dish.  It has 3 different bruschetta.  1) Spicy tuna 2) Octopus with avocado and wasabi sauce 3) Anchovy and mozarella.  They were all really unique and the flavors meshed very well together.  The wasabi isn't too spicy either!

The Fettuccini with salmon and roe was a hearty dish.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was creamy without being super heavy.  The chunks of salmon were good and the roe added salty little bursts throughout the meal.

The miso carbonara was definitely the favorite.  It wasn't quite as salty but had a mild miso flavor that reminded me exactly of ramen without the soup!  The chunks of bacon were an added bonus that needs to be recognized.  A great pasta dish!

I will definitely come back when I am feeling more spendy than Big Wong.  The prix fixe combos are a good idea to get to save money and you get to chose an appetizer, a soda/wine/beer and a pasta.  You just have to be mindful of the limitations with the combos.  The uni tomato cream pasta cannot be in any combo.  I am curious to try it but I don't think I can commit to a $27 pasta dish.

The pasta was a bit waygu with tomato and mashroom source, it's very good to me and I can finish it all with my hubby. We also have the hamberd steak which was very very good, you can definitely try it if you like proteins more than carbs. The service was not bad too. We will come back for the other famous pasta next time. Although it's a Japanese style of pasta, but it was better than others. It's just too many on the menu that you wanna try them all, so it makes me difficult to choose from the menu",IzWYXfu3NVpacb_i7259qw,12,10,4,KOFamZeoKp2o52dOxpsWzQ

I came here for a birthday celebration for a friend and the staff was friendly and attentive. The service was great. I ordered the infamous squid ink pasta, BF ordered the beef/Pork hamburger patty thing, birthday girl ordered the famous uni pasta and her spouse ordered I think a meat pasta? The squid ink pasta to be honest isn't anything special other than its drenched in black squid ink. The taste is like any other pasta. Was it good? It was great! Full of garlic flavor, but I think the hype is the sheer fact that the pasta is in squid ink which makes it ""exotic"" and entices people to get it. Beware, it will make your lips and teeth black temporarily. Haha. The uni pasta surprisingly didn't have any uni flavor to it. The pasta was creamy and delicious. The beef/Pork hamburger was okay. My point being, can you get a similar or Same flavor at an Italian place spending less money. Probably. Haha. It was a good experience. Overall, 3.5 for the food and 5 for the service.

3476241,2016-12-15,1,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"When much of the fusion world is dominated by poke bowls and fancy abstract izakaya tapas, it's refreshing to see something in between the opposites of fast food and bouge date night. 

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya indeed offers an avant-garde interpretation on painting Japanese flavor profiles on the canvas of traditional Italian dishes. Think miso carbonara, uni cream linguine, octopus carpaccio... wow. I almost want to say that I knew this would be a 5-star experience once I sat down and looked at the menu. 

(+) Complimentary bread & butter: reminds me of the rolls in Asia, i.e. comfort food tasty. A tad bit sweet, toasty warm, a thin crust, and a fluffy interior.

(++) Bruschetta ""Nakamura-ya"" Style ($3.50 happy hour) - The toasted baguettes are difficult to be shared (one order per person would be best since there is only one of each. The thoughtful toppings are of fine dining calibur. 
- My favorite was the one with tuna and ""Mentaiko"", a spicy cod roe with very smoky and umami flavors, somewhat like smoked salmon superimposed on cod cakes. 
- The octopus with avocado and wasabi mayo was delicious as well, robust and buttery. (Maybe this will be the next avo toast trend.) 
- The most basic was the anchovy oil topped with fresh mozzarella cheese, which was mostly cheesy garlic bread--plain compared to the others, but it best exemplified the perfect toastiness

(+) Spaghetti ""Kurobuta"" Sausage & Broccoli ($8 happy hour) - Classic spaghetti with a light tomato based sauce. The sausage was not noticeably kurobuta and could use more spices. I like the simplicity of the dish, though it wasn't the most exciting fusion creation here.

(+++) Traditional meat sauce with ""Wagyu"" beef cooked with ""Kinoko"" (Japanese assorted
mushrooms), tomato cream sauce on fettuccine ($8 happy hour) - A melange of wagyu and mushrooms over pasta, in a mildly spicy tomato sauce with just a dash of cream (to my liking). 

The cooking style was homey, not too bold but creative and carefully balanced. Correspondingly, the ambiance incorporates conservative European restaurant necessities of tablecloths and baskets, as well as more modern Japanese additions like a bar area with an overhang and a cutesy handwritten blackboard highlighting their most popular items. Service was extremely polite and attentive.

I think the dishes could use more meat and the pastas more provocatively al dente, but an outstanding dining experience nonetheless. Also, the restaurant is run by Japanese people so it's authentic fusion (though that sounds like an oxymoron), an original interpretation of Asian-European cuisine rather than some business gimmick. 

They offer a ""happy hour"" deal of essentially a lunch menu--there's a discount on select apps and entrees, as well as combo choices. Certain items like the uni cream pasta are expensive, but there's a large selection of very well priced items (and uni itself is valuable!)

The novel fusion specialties are definitely worth the 10-minute drive from the Strip. If I lived in Vegas, I would definitely be inclined to try the whole menu at Trattoria Nakamura-Ya P:",4jPsIgMZT4_Ks5-myaW9Bg,6,1,5,bVKiPqJeMCmXmzcevsDyQQ

Before this place I have never had any kind of uni in my life. So the first time I had it was in their uni pasta. I feel like $27 for pasta is expensive but it's so delicious and worth every bite! 

I also come every year for their anniversary when the uni pasta is $10 cheaper than usual lol. Today was the first day of their 6th year anniversary so I dined in for some uni pasta. I actually had room for dessert so I decided to try the black sesame blancmange. I love anything black sesame and omg this was so good. They topped it with strawberry sauce and fresh strawberries which made it taste similar to peanut butter and jelly. The texture was firm and consistent, sooo so good.

3524674,2016-04-17,7,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Went here yesterday for a very belated birthday dinner and thought it would be an interesting place to try because of the whole Italian-Japanese fusion aspect! I had high expectations of the place and decided to order the squid ink pasta since I was feeling very adventurous. It is also listed as number 2 of their popular items!

The dish itself looked very interesting since it was pretty much pitch black (not something you see everyday!). In terms of taste, the ink contributes a slight bitter aftertaste, but it was very mild. I was kind of disappointed since it tasted like regular pasta and they do use a good amount of oil so you can see and taste that as well. The price they charge for the squid ink pasta is not worth trying the dish, but if you have a friend who decides to order it, go ahead and just try a bite. The novelty wears off pretty fast and I actually didn't finish my dish because the ink does stain your lips and teeth. So unless you are super comfortable with the people you are eating with, I would avoid this dish (i.e. like on a first date lol). 

I also ordered their garlic bread which was number 4 on their popular menu list and that dish was pretty good. I would recommend ordering it, but be warned that their is a lot of garlic and the bread is soaked in oil. Kind of disappointed that the price you pay for one order doesn't really reflect the quality and quantity.

My friend ordered the pasta with uni which was their number one item, but he didn't really seem to like it. I had a bite and it was just really creamy and I didn't really taste too much of the uni. Let's just say I was glad I went with the squid ink pasta over the uni one lol. 

I also got to try the 3 dessert sampler and I enjoyed 2 out of the 3 items that they gave. The one I didn't like was the green jello looking one which I assume was supposed to taste like green tea. It tasted like a bitter mix of green tea and coffee with a weird aftertaste. One of my friends described it as stale ube and she's apparently had that before lol! I would not recommend ordering this item. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to those who want to try a fusion place, but they do have to work on their dishes a bit. Just don't come in with high expectations like I did and maybe it will be a better experience. The wait staff were very attentive and friendly so it made the experience really nice. They kept checking up on us and refilled our drinks without having to call them over.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,9,8,3,EZ_i-XHtD7O8dcq9EZUXBw
3525692,2012-01-01,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Fusion places have become increasing popular in Las Vegas. When I heard about a new Japanese Italian fusion restaurant, I was curious to check it out. 

The restaurant is located in the same shopping center as Raku, Monta Noodle and Big Wong so it's in great company. It's small with about nine tables and a bar. The ambiance is simple and modern.

I ordered ginger ale and it wasn't the regular stuff you can buy at the supermarket. It was Fever Tree Ginger Ale and it was so, so good! 

The buns they provide as an appetizer were fresh, warm and delicious. (I didn't get a chance to take note of the proper names of the menu items so pardon me if I don't get the names correct.) We started off with Jidori Chicken which translates to ""organic chicken"" per the waitress. It was good but not memorable. 

My husband ordered the Miso Carbonara ($13.95) and he enjoyed it. I ordered the Fettucini with Baby Scallops and Tarako (?) sauce ($18.95). Again, I apologize if I get the names wrong. I really enjoyed my dish. The pasta was cooked perfectly as were the scallops and the sauce was indescribable. I really tasted the Italian and Japanese influence in the dish.

For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu. It was good, not too sweet, but it wasn't the best Tiramisu I ever had.

I would give the service 5 stars because the waitresses were very sweet and attentive. They were wonderful about explaining the menu items to us, our glasses were never empty and they kept our table clean.

I would suggest to sign up for their e-mail distribution because they change out their pasta menu every few weeks. I can't wait to see what else they have to offer!",MaxlLd0HZmCtdZ3yJ9pyJQ,1,0,4,7nT3kgH6_0_zVNS05OAUew

Nakamura's storefront is relatively unsuspecting and may go unnoticed next to the huge ""Big Wong"" sign right next to it, but the food here is worth visiting this restaurant at least once. 

The food is nicely arranged and tastes great. Trattoria Nakamura-Ya  advertises itself as a Japanese-Italian fusion and does an excellent job executing it. The pasta served here is cooked just right, and the broth served with it does remind of Japanese food. Note that the main dishes here do not come with rice, however.  

The service was impeccable. Since we were the only people in the restaurant for a while, we enjoyed the ""single-table"" treatment: We never had to ask for refills, the waitress was friendly and helpful, and we barely had to wait for our food to come out after we placed our orders! Even when more customers came in, and it got a little busier, getting our checks and paying was done quickly and efficiently. 

The pricing is a little questionable when comparing the individual items on the menu to one another. My friend's Linguini with Jidori Chicken ended up costing $8 when my Jidori Chicken with Kinkoku sauce (no rice included) cost me $15. It could have been because his Linguini hardly had any chicken in it, but that's really not a good thing, either. 

Overall, this restaurant offers good food and splendid customer service. It could easily be a 5-star place if the pricing was more consistent.",lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg,0,0,4,1pzAF3lDPdz6yw9UY1T8jg

Earl and I were just going to head home since it's a work night.  We were walking out of Luxor but stopped to say bye to Teri and Reggie when they sold us on joining for Uni Pasta at Trattoria for half the usual price due to their 2nd anniversary celebration.  Teri and Reggie told us the same thing that Tony and Nelson had already told us earlier, but T & R quantify it...the usual uni pasta goes for 26 bucks but tonight, it is 13.50.  Of course logic kicks in and I quickly told Earl, ""Let's go.""  

When we arrived, there were people that wanted our table.  Wow, am I glad Tony made the reservation.  Those people then ordered to go and got their food quicker than we did.  But that's alright, we got to taste the food right when it comes out.  Earl and I ordered the uni pasta and squid ink pasta.  We killed the uni pasta within matter of minutes, looked over to our right, Tony had inhaled his way ahead of us.  Then came the squid ink pasta.  It was good, but the uni pasta was too good.  It overshadowed the squid ink pasta.  While Earl and I shared both dishes, Teri and Reggie each got the Uni Pasta and shared the Squid Ink pasta.  Nelson consumed both uni pasta and squid ink pasta. Tony T consumed 2 bowls of uni pasta.  Sylvia loved the uni pasta but didn't eat very much and saving the rest for the following day (unless Nelson decides to eat it for a midnight snack).

Located in Chinatown in a small strip mall next to Big Wong. Parking area is small. We had to park on the street.

The restaurant is extremely tiny but the chairs were comfortable.

They start you off with warm bread rolls and butter. 

For appetizers, we went with-

Fried oysters. You get three with each order and it's fried just right, the batter doesn't overpower the taste of the oyster.

Octopus Carpaccio with Wasabi Mayo- a playful dish of thinly-sliced octopus over greens and mayo.

Deep-fried baby octopus was our fave. Big sized baby octopus, and was very filling.

For entree, my bf tried their Fettuccini Parma Prosciutto Carbonara with White Truffle and I had the  Linguini Manila Clam & ""Shiso."" The pastas taste homemade and the sauces were clean and fresh.

Their happy hour prix fixe is a pretty great deal, if you have the chance, you should order that instead. But it was more selective in their pasta selections.

Tony T. had already secured a table for 8, and TNY was celebrating their 2nd Year Anniversary by offering 50% off two of their signature pastas-Uni Tomato Cream Pasta, and Squid Ink Spaghetti, so we met up with Teri C., Reggie M., Tony T., Professional competitive eater Miki ""Mikachu"" Sudo(who was Tony's +1) and Regina and Earl C.

It was PACKED when we got there, but we already knew what we were coming for.
Pretty much our whole table got the Uni Pasta(or two) and shared the Squid Ink Spaghetti on top of our orders. Miki opted for the Miso Carbonara, and Tony killed a few apps before his two bowls of Uni Pasta. Our wait time was pretty long, and we had been warned by our waitress, but our party didn't mind, as we filled the time chit-chatting, catching up with one another, and hearing about Miki's food challenges where she beat Joey Chestnut in a Wing Bowl Challenge, and beat Sonya""The Black Widow"" Thomas in a Kimchi Challenge by killing 8.5 pounds in 6 minutes! Phozilla Challenge @ Pho 87 and The Quadruple Bypass Challenge @ Heart Attack Grill? She's been there, killed that...CRAZY!!!

Our food finally arrives, and man, the Uni Tomato Cream Pasta did not disappoint!
Perfect al dente on the pasta, the richness of the uni tomato cream, nice sweet chunks of uni, the chili threads and the torn pieces of basil helped balanced this dish out perfectly. Man, was that DEE-LISH!!! The Squid Ink Spaghetti came next, and this was also good...pasta and squid cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic, but it still seemed to be missing something, or the uni pasta was just too good to be overshadowed by anything else.

However, I have come to realize that it's quite difficult to come here and not order the Uni Tomato Cream Pasta or the Squid Ink Pasta. So, I apologize but honestly these two dishes alone has sealed the 5-star deal for me! 

Even if you've never tried uni or fancied it in general, I believe you'd still enjoy the pasta dish. It's creamy, buttery, with small chunks of uni that seamlessly intertwines its flavor with the base. And so begins the salivating.. -___-""

I've eaten here 3 times now and the last two times only the uni pasta was ordered, mainly because I came with people that were fans of uni in general. But, from what I can remember from my very first visit, I really enjoyed the squid ink as well. If it's your first time experiencing squid ink, don't knock it before you try it! It's hard to describe the taste, it's a bit salty, and nothing you'd imagine 'ink' to taste like. Warning: do not have this dish on a first date, it will turn your mouth black :X Nothing some sips of water can't clear up though! 

Probably the only downside is the price is pretty steep for these pasta dishes ~$27-30 for each plate ..yikes! The upside is that it's large enough to share between two people, well maybe just two girls. 

They have daily specials as well, and specialty beers, but like I said, I can't help myself but always go straight to one of these two dishes! If you really are not into either of these two dishes and need some recommendations on other menu items, just look up on the wall!

When I came the other night with my partner's family, we ordered several dishes to share family style which is great for this place since the menu is on the longer side (especially the pastas).  

We tried the Kobe Style Beef Carpaccio and Calamari to start with, which I really enjoyed. We then ordered the garlic bread, which I dare say may have been my favorite dish of the night since it was both packed with flavor and filling. If you come here on more of a budget, order a couple garlic breads. 

For the main courses, we ordered the Uni Pasta, Squid Ink Pasta, and ""Kobe"" Style Beef Outside Skirt Steak. I'm not a huge fan of Uni, but I really did enjoy the Uni pasta for how creamy it was. The Squid Ink makes for a nice Instagram moment, but the taste was somewhat bland (however I do find this common for most squid ink pastas). I also did really like the ""Kobe"" Style Skirt Steak. I don't believe this is true Kobe, but it sure was tasty. 

For dessert, I had the Black Sesame Blancmange and the Soymilk Panna Cotta, and I loved both. The savory sesame flavor for the ice cream was definitely different, but it really grew on me and I kept going back for more.

We got the prix fixe A meal.  Really, you can't go wrong with that.  I ordered the octopus carpaccio and the shrimp/mushroom spaghetti.  My husband ordered another octopus appetizer (I can't remember the name) and spaghetti carbonara.  The prix fixe also comes with a beer (PBR only) or glass of wine.

Octopus Carpaccio: Sooo good.  Chewy, flavorful, with a spicy aioli type of sauce on top of it.  I liked it a lot.

Other Octopus App: These were little WHOLE baby octopus fried calamari style.  It was kind of cool to see a whole octopus in that form, since I'm used to the little rings of calamari.  Those were fun to eat because I love me some tenticles, and they had tons of them!

Shrimp/Mushroom Spaghetti: This is going to sound weird, but this dish tasted like Pasta Roni, which was fine by me because I love Pasta Roni, so I was very happy with this dish.  You could definitely taste the mushroom in the sauce, and it was a very generous helping also.

Spaghetti Carbonara: I thought this particular dish was bland, but my husband enjoyed it.

It was so good that I knew I had to give it another visit.  I really wanted to order something different this time, but because I liked it so much this first time, I had to order it again, especially since I traveled all the way from San Francisco and there isn't a restaurant over there that makes anything similar.

I also ordered their Kobe Style Beef Carpaccio -- http://bit.ly/11dtNC7
This was definitely a great start to my meal.  The beef was very flavorful and I really took my time with this dish.  It was that good!

Now I don't really need to say anything more about the Uni Tomato Cream Spaghetti --  http://bit.ly/Zgs3hq 
It was just as creamy and delicious as the first time I had it.  I'm glad I didn't pass up on it to try something new.  You really can't go wrong with ordering this!

Once again, awesome food!  It's definitely become one of my must-go restaurants and next time I visit, I hope to try their other specialty dishes, but I won't be surprised if I end up getting another other of their Uni Tomato Cream Spaghetti!

3819999,2014-07-18,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"It's the only Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant I know of, so it is as good as it gets. But that reputation is very well deserved at Trattoria Nakamura-Ya, a tiny restaurant in the Chinatown strip mall that houses such greats as Japanese Curry Zen and Monta Ramen. 

The interior has a bistro-like feel, sparsely but well decorated. Small and cozy, with a view into the kitchen where you can see Chef Nakamura at work. At one point, I managed to catch the chef's eye, gave him a smile and a thumbs up. He smiled and nodded back. Friendly guy :)

Our server was super cute, friendly and knowledgable. Her beer recommendations were spot on. Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is beer & wine only, but it is a very well-curated list with quite a few gems. Both beers we were recommended (one Japanese, one Italian) were ones we'd never heard of. Both were absolutely delicious and worked well with our dinner.

We ordered the antipasto platter, baby octopus ""kara-age"", and uni tomato cream linguine. Generous portions and a ton of food, plenty for two. The baby octopus was cute, tender, and delicious with a heavy dusting of salt and pepper. The antipasto plate consisted of two kinds of hot chicken sausages on a bed of sauerkraut with a really nice grainy hot mustard, a thick slice of hot smoked salmon with capers and a tiny kale & radish salad, a bit of gorgonzola and pecorino cheese, bread sticks and crackers. Not your usual cold cuts, olives, and cheese, but delicious nonetheless. We also got two complimentary warm dinner rolls with well-salted butter. They are definitely not afraid of seasoning here, and I'm very appreciative of that! 

The star of the evening was, of course, the uni tomato cream linguini. The sauce had a wonderful mouth feel, lusciously creamy without feeling heavy or greasy. I was afraid the tomato and cream would overwhelm the delicate uni, but it didn't. The dish tasted of the ocean, lightly briny with the flavor of fresh bright seafood. The sauce clung sensuously to every strand of pasta, sexy and warm. Occasionally, a bit of fresh basil leaf would get tangled up in those long, al dente strands, adding a different dimension to the dish that still all worked in total, hand-holding-and-singing-Kumbaya harmony. Even as I write this, I can feel and taste it. I've vowed to return to Trattoria Nakamura-Ya to eat my way through the menu, but I think I might be stuck at #50.",CI0MxhxvVbhSgouy_z-ztw,1,3,5,6aKdMV7bUX7tPKOWO-IPSw

Next was the squid ink pasta for $19, it is expensive and sadly lacks in any flavor or acceptable qualities - 1 star. I have had several great squid ink dishes in the past, this one lacked any texture or taste... it was very basic. We ate a few bites and moved on to dessert. The dessert was a pudding suggested by the waitress, was amazing and yummy. It's a bit pricy... but lacks on the high quality wow factor for the prices.

3840940,2018-03-24,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"The reviews are great but maybe i came on a off night.  I gave it 3 stars for ok food but the service was poor.

Lets start with the service, i dont think you should have to stop and ask your waitress for everything. There were 2 waitresses and not one came on thier own with out being flagged down.  From getting water/drinks after being seated for over 10min, to ordering appetizers, to ordering main dishes, asking for refils of water and glasses of wine,  removing dishes, ordering deserts to finally asking for the check.  I dont know if they want to leave u alone on purpose but we just felt ignored completely.

Onto the food!

We started with a chicken and mushroom salad with a ginger dressing. It was decent but nothing special.

Also got the italian spring roll.  It seemed like a cool play on mozerella sticks but there wasnt much filling and i didnt get any cheese flavor just tased the wrap. I would skip this one.

Our final app was the garlic bread.  This was very good. Altho it was kind rich from all the butter. Im not sure what they do but u def tast the butter and there is a mound of garlic but its not over powering.

For mains we got the uni tomato cream, a grilled chicken dish and outside skirt steak.

The uni pasta was decent but i didnt get a lot of uni flavor. The pasta was cooked perfectly and came out hot i just thought it was little bland.  

The grilled chicken had a lot of flavor but did come with the skin on which i would have prefered it off.  

The skirt steak was again not very seasoned but was very tender .

All 3 of these where just ok but nothing great.  I do appreciate everything coming out looking very nice  and being  hot.

We ended on the 3 sampler and mochi.  The mochi was very good and i believe made in house. The green tea ice cream that was severed with it was also very good.

The 3 sampler was ok altho my friend did comment they thought the panna cotta was good. 

Again over all the food was ok,  i prob would come back again as there are a lot of items on the menu and the risotto sounded good.  But that uni dish is supposedly thier signature and it missed the mark. There are other places in town that make uni pasta which are much more flavorful.",mrNs9-Ml0qe77Lk7NwNdfw,0,0,3,BxW6kyva8toKxSbOQgESVg

For dessert we had Black Sesame Blanc Manger, layered with intense, wonderful sesame flavor.  Good atmosphere (though I don't need a TV in there at all) and soft lighting.

However, I'm not sure if I care too much for the uni mixed into pasta.. it did make the pasta super creamy and delicious and I can totally tell how this dish could be a huge hit for pasta lovers. 

I did love the mussels 3 ways, it's was so different and delicious and a great appetizer to our meals. We also had the bruschetta, which came with 3 different styles.. my absolute favorite was the one with tuna.. oh my goodness if they had that option alone I would probably order 3 orders of bruschetta!

I'm so mad I didn't write down what it was because I can't find the menu anywhere online.  We were both pretty open to any suggestions she offered us, so we started out with the Kobe beef carpaccio, excellent dish, highly recommend, although my fingers looked like hot dogs after eating it, cured meat and me don't get along, but I can't help myself, it tastes so good. Second app we tried the Jidori fried chicken, definitely way too greasy, would not order again or recommend, taste was overpowered with grease. I have a love for daikon, so I tried the daikon & sun dried tomato salad, I loved it, but if you're not a fan of sour, I would skip this. It was truly unique, very tasty. Again, I wish I would have written some things down, but our main dish was a tomato based pasta with several different types of Japanese mushroom, we could not get enough of this! It was amazing. I want to call and see if they can tell me what their specials were on Saturday because I want to order it again.

I love this fusion concept of Italian and Japanese, and I think they really stay true to in many of their dishes. Not just putting sushi elements on pasta, but they take it a step further which is interesting and refreshing!

Our favorite dishes were the Soft Shell Crab, Linguini ""Uni"" Tomato Cream, Green Mussel ""3 ways"" and the Kobe Beef Carpaccio. The Fettuccini Parma Prosciutto Carbonara with White Truffle EVOO wasn't creamy enough for me and the truffle scent was sparse, so I would choose another Carbonara option they have next time!

Finally months after, I gave in and wanted to try this place out with my coworker after work. We both order the uni cream tomato pasta. Before the main dish arrived, we were served complimentary bread with butter. The bread was sweet and very good. It was warm and toasted on the outside. 

Our dish arrived, immediately she sprinkle chilli flakes on hers so I copied what she did.

Nothing wrong with going down the 'most popular dishes' list on the wall. The uni cream tomato pasta is to die for, and I'm a huge fan of the squid ink as well. The jidori chicken is just bursting with flavor, and one bite of the hamburg steak was all it took to evoke memories of eating similar dishes in Japan.

Don't skip over the specials menu, though, especially since the dishes rotate in and out frequently. The super-refreshing cold summer pasta, so perfectly cooked and topped with karasumi, makes me miss hot weather more than our current cold spell!

Also, check out the happy hour specials (I think from opening at 2pm until 5pm). A lot of their best dishes have happy hour pricing, which they deserve huge props for.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,0,0,5,Shb0v7qdmcOdHPiSW6Ijyg

She said the bread is from Costco so it's not really their problem.  We brushed it off, but pretty much ruined the rest of the meal.  There was something definitely wrong with the bread but no response.  I told the waitress it's not her fault but we felt the response to the problem was not acceptable.

3952099,2016-01-30,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"This is a whole in the wall Japanese-Italian fusion. We found out about this place from a family friend and we ABSOLUTELY love this place. We've been back four times already. 

Here's the breakdown of our experience: 

Ambiance - From the moment you walk in, you can tell this is a small restaurant that is constantly packed on the weekends! The restaurant can probably hold about 30 people max. I recommend calling ahead to see how long the wait is or make a reservation. The parking also sucks! However, you can park across the street if you want or circle around a bit until you find an open spot. The place is loud, with a trendy ambiance. The service is great. It's cool to see the Chef's make the food! The servers have very thick Japanese accents... So make sure you pay close attention to what they're saying. 

Food - We had the Uni linguini, which is considered their #1 dish. It's THE BEST pasta dish I think I've ever had. I usually don't like uni when I eat sushi, but the way the Chef makes it really transform the dish into something creamy, delicious, and incredible. The noodles were cooked perfectly. There were bits of uni pieces in the dish with a creamy sauce that really pulled it together. 

My husband had the squid ink pasta with calamari. This dish was okay. Be careful! The squid ink will stain your lips, teeth, and stain your clothes. The dish was simple and unique, but it lacked taste in comparison with the Uni pasta. I recommend first-timers try the Uni linguini!

Price: Place is fairly priced. The quality of the food is great. The service was on-point. For two pastas and two glasses of wine the total came out to $65, which isn't too bad. There are cheaper pasta dishes ($11-15 a dish) that's available and the portions are pretty large. You can share it or take the food home to eat later if you want. So if you're looking for cheap eats, you definitely can at this place depending on what you pick. 

Drinks: The drink selection is minimal. I had two glasses of their house merlot that tasted like average Merlot. One drink was approximately $9 a glass. They have beer and sake as well. There isn't well drinks or specialty drinks available. 

Overall, I enjoyed it. The uni linguini is a must. Remember to call ahead and account for parking. My husband and I will definitely be back again!",kHEQu2K4TIiXdw7Onj9TIw,2,2,4,s1Lw9WH0mAsBeVfXHjKJ2w

I saw the event on Yelp of the Trattoria's 3rd anniversary special of half off their two most popular dishes for two days only.  I was there before 5 PM so there wasn't a line and I sat at the counter.  I ordered the uni tomato cream pasta, normally $26.95 but on sale for $13.  I ordered some iced oolong  tea and for dessert I got the black sesame milk blancmange.

I was brought a can of tea with a glass of ice and a roll with a pat of butter.  Sitting at the counter gave me the chance to watch the two men working to turn out all the pasta that was being sold.  They were working hard as there were several take out orders in addition to the people in the relatively small restaurant.

In a reasonable amount of time my pasta was brought to me.  It was very good but I expected more of an uni taste.  The tomato cream flavor was very good but it overwhelmed the uni.  The uni was in the pasta and also chopped in smaller pieces in the sauce. The mint leaves added a great counter flavor to the tomato.  The blancmange was the highlight of the evening.  It was rich without being too sweet.

Service was very good.  Friendly servers who were quite busy but attentive.  I may come back to try some of their appetizers, but I think the pasta is overrated and overpriced.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,8,3,wgC_b-LywKImXzEfpazSdQ

First, the food is phenomenally inventive and high quality.  I rarely eat Italian since this option just seems so played out at most places. Not here!  The flavor combinations really pop.  I admit I would have never thought Japanese/Italian would work, but now am wondering why there only seems to be one?

Service is always great.  Its only ten tables or so, but we always felt attended to, without the overwhelming intrusiveness some places substitute for 'great service'!  This Trattoria realizes that sometimes- less is more.

Another reason?  Perhaps due to the small place, and for a relatively plain interior, it seems really intimate.  It has a simple look and feel that allows you to focus on the food and the company.  

Lastly?  The price.  It is not cheap.  But for the quality of both the ingredients and the execution?  This place is a culinary bargain!

Almost hate to let others know, in case getting a reservation gets too difficult... but I really need for this place to stay open.

Consistent great service, which is especially hard to find on Spring Mountain. Our server was very attentive of all her tables and was very quick and efficient with all our requests. But what differentiates the service here at Trattoria is that they continuously act in a manner that will delight and surprise their guests. We asked for lemons to squeeze into our water cups and to our surprise, she would bring a small plate of extra lemon slices every time we got a new glass of water. It's a small gesture but we were VERY impressed.

Was able to try several different dishes this time around:
Italian Spring Roll: Basically an antipasti plate in an egg roll. It tasted WAY better than it looked because I thought it was going to taste ""too fried"" but it wasn't! Plus, the cheese to prosciutto ratio was on point. 
Fried Jidori Chicken: Upgraded popcorn chicken. The way this appetizer is described makes it seem like you only get a couple pieces of chicken but you actually get a pretty decent-sized bowl of salad with fried chicken, cherry tomatoes, and vinaigrette! 
Spaghetti Manila Clam & Asparagus: PERSONAL NEW FAVE. Thought nothing could surpass my love for the Linguini Clam & Shinso White Wine Sauce but the Garlic Anchovy Cream Sauce just hits the spot!

Had the beef carpaccio and the roasted vegetables with bagna cauda - one of my most favorite Italian dishes which you rarely see on a menu... Also tried the jidori chicken appetizer... sadly 3pm Cafe's chicken was better... but this place has the service, the style, the work ethic, the heart and the vibe that 3pm will never achieve...bless their hearts.   

We shared the tomato uni pasta -- could have died and gone to heaven...

Wine prices are incredibly reasonable... Don't byo ---it's a problem for them.  Not a problem for me.  

Dessert - and she raced down the street and around the corner for a candle to put in it, because my friend insisted, was only ok.   It was a panna cotta with balsamic glaze and berries... too stiff... (that's what she said...)  

Anyway, these same folks operate Kabuki off Maryland Parkway at Flamingo -- who knew?  That's near my office...if they're doing any of these dishes near my office, I'd love it.  

Lots more to try on the menu so I can't wait to go back.  

Show them some love.

For this second visit, we had ordered a plethora of food to taste. 
3 way mussels - This was interesting since it was presented in the escargot dish prepared in three styles. I like the variety of the flavors and my favorite was the butter parsley. I did not like that there were 2 small mussels and would have preferred to have one large mussel. 

Uni Tomato Cream Pasta - was not Uni enough. You can tell there was uni with some of the pieces in the pasta but the taste was not strong enough. I could only tell there was some uni by the after taste it left in my mouth. Maybe the sauce was too creamy? The tomato was more of an accent than for flavor. 

Kurobuta Tonkatsu - sat on tomato sauce which was what made it Italian. The tomato sauce did not bring anything to the dish, rather than texture and color. The tonkatsu itself was great because it lightly battered and the pork tasted like thin layers of juicy pork.  

Soft Shell Crab with balsamic- fried and light. I thought the balsamic would overpower the crab but it didn't. The vinegar added a small tart taste which brought out the fried fresh crabby flavor.

Salad - We also ordered a salad to round out the dishes and add some greens. It was straight forward and good but not memorable enough for me to describe in more detail. 

I know they are suppose to specialize in pasta Japanese Italian style but I don't buy it. I would only come back for the appetizers and to try their desserts.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,4,1,3,QaSr3Y7GRC5yU58zJk7epw
4108281,2015-11-12,8,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Happy Anniversary to one of the better fusion concepts around town!

I last visited Trattoria Nakamura-Ya on their 3rd anniversary last year, and they brought back their ~50% off pasta specials for their 4th anniversary. I was disappointed that the happy hour specials have either been discontinued or are temporarily removed for anniversary purposes, so I didn't get to revisit the fried oyster or Jidori chicken. I did have the uni tomato cream pasta again (twice, actually) and enjoyed it as much as last year, perhaps even a bit more now that I knew to tear up the basil leaves to spread out the flavor.

They did have another special printed menu for the anniversary. Alongside the discounted pastas, they offered regular-price items, including two appetizers, one main course, and a dessert. I ended up trying most of these items tonight:

Salmon Carpaccio ($16): a playful dish of eight thin pieces of salmon over greens, with a karashi-yuzu dressing (think mustard/citrus), olives, radish, kiwi, a citrus-y fruit (possibly yuzu, but I've never had the pleasure), and dill. It's quite yummy and clearly shows off both Italian and Japanese influences, but I can't say that I would choose it over some of the cold salmon dishes at Yonaka.

New Zealand Ribeye ($27): supposedly their 3rd most popular dish, right after the uni and the squid ink pastas. Pre-sliced, cooked to medium-rare, flavored with white truffle EVOO, with some sauteed potatoes, asparagus, paprika, and green tea sea salt on the side. Let's get it out of the way first that I couldn't discern much in green tea flavor, but I enjoyed all the other flavors and accoutrements. The meat itself was tender and tasty, but the fat doesn't seem to have been fully trimmed and.or rendered. I expect flawless execution at this price point, and I didn't get it.

NakamuraYa's 3 Dessert Sampler ($10): now this one was worth every penny. I loved each member of the trio equally. The tiramisu was as good as any that I've had, especially in terms of the alcohol-soaked ladyfingers, espresso flavor, and balanced sweetness. The soy milk panna cotta lived up to my friend's hype and more, with a perfectly silky texture and an awesome Okinawa black sugar sauce. The black sesame blancmange had so much black sesame flavor and also had a smooth mouthfeel. I would order any of those again in a heartbeat.

I've gotta find out whether happy hour is still on after this event. If so, I'll certainly be back to revisit Trattoria Nakamura-Ya's desserts and to explore more of their menu.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,7,4,ALm0dR_HUXrMsBfukLdjpA

I think the only Japanese element of the dish was the use of beef marked Kobe, but when your slice of meat is 1mm thick, you probably lose a lot of what makes Kobe beef Kobe beef. We also had a soft shell crab salad, which featured some very good sweet crab. I went out on a limb (for me) and ordered the squid ink pasta, and I have to say that it wasn't my favorite. Far from tasting unique, the dish tasted like a gritty watered down version of pasta with white clam sauce. At least I can cross that off my list now. All together, the service was good, I'm sure the other things on the menu are tastier than the squid ink.",7f8oJMzKS5Hc97RsxxG3_g,0,0,3,cIavB1zBAHraZKFULoQjqA

You in all likelihood will not find this style of restaurant in any other US city.  When you walk in and look at the chefs I am reminded of the hardcore chefs in Japan they take their skills in cooking very seriously and they look it.  The waitress was pleasant and very attentive.  The lighting and Music is soft and the night we were there they had the door open so the ambiance was a little romantic.  First off on the high to dos here is the Beef Carpaccio sooo so good.  One of the specials they were running that night was a Uni and tomato cream spaghetti, literally melted in my mouth highly recommended meal.  Another highly recommended dish is the Seafood Pescatore it is like a clam linguini but topped with onions seaweed and tobiko, the Japanese twist.  The menu has a lot of options and the waitress will help you decide plus they do have daily specials that change according to what they have fresh.

Our favourite dish, hands down, was the spaghetti with natto. The dashi broth was amazing and the ingredients really worked so beautifully together. However, I was a bit disappointed with the squid ink and uni dish. How could the most popular dishes from fellow yelpers be disappointing?! Maybe we just came on an off day? The uni pasta was a lovely colour but lacked in actual uni flavour. The squid ink lacked a bit of salt. Everything was presented very well and had us excited to taste it all.

Envious by the abundance of similar Japanese-Italian trattorias when visiting California, we were excited to discover this place and to finally have the opportunity to dine here this week. The restaurant is quaint, with a never ending stream of diners (that all seem to have made reservations). We'll make reservations on the next go just to get better seating as the table made available to us was quite small especially if you ordered more than one dish.

We opted to try their prix fixe dinner menu which included apps like Fried Oysters (with chef's special tartar sauce) and the outstanding Octopus Carpaccio with Wasabi Mayo (Sashimi style octopus topped with fried garlic chips, olives and diced tomatoes). I went with the Pasta B Course and selected the Spaghetti ""Mentaiko"" Carbonara while I urged my wife to try the Main Dish Course's ""Wagyu"" Beef & ""Kurobuta"" Pork Hamburg Steak. Neither of us made the wrong choice! While I intended to write a fairly descriptive review of the food, allow me to be brief and just say every dish we had (and shared) was deliciously perfect in every way. From the very accommodating staff and the timely prepared meals, it was an experience we'd definitely like to repeat! Nakamura-Ya's menu boasts an array of gastronomically tempting dishes that one would immediately feel the need to try out everything all at once (MUST EAT ALL THE FOODS)!

We concluded our dinner with Nakamura-Ya's 3 Sampler Dessert Platter consisting of Soymilk Panna Cotta, Black Sesame Blancmange (my new dessert favourite), and Tiramisu. The dessert sampler was balanced in flavour, nothing was overly sweet, just the right touch to wrap things up -- and we came away satisfied and already thinking of the next dish we'd like to try.

He had made reservations ahead of time and when we walked in they asked if we had reservations. It's a small place so I would say definitely call for reservations!

We started off with the octopus carpaccio and the fried oysters. Both items were tasty and a good starter course with the yummy warm bread. There were 4 good portions of octopus. There was a prix fixe menu, but the entrees that we wanted to try was not on the fixed menu so I really don't recall the pricing of the fixed menu. 

For the entrees we decided on the popular Uni and Tomato Cream Pasta and the Seafood Pescatore. I've had uni pasta before and I didn't care for it, so I wasn't sure what to expect this time around. WELL....I loved it! I don't think we got as big pieces of uni as other Yelper's photos, but there was definitely an uni flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly. The Seafood Pescatore had LOADS of seafood (clams, mussels, scallops and shrimp) with perfectly cooked pasta as well with a light tomato sauce. We shared the two entrees (family style) and it was definitely enough for the two and a half of us. I was really stuffed afterwards and it takes a lot to for me to get full. ;)

Service was wonderful...maybe a bit too attentive, but at least they were attentive and not the other way around.

I can't decide if I feel more disappointed or embarrassed after my last experience at Trattoria. I've hyped up Trattoria to so many friends, I hope the complete change in service and quality of food is just recent and not something that happened a while ago, because I would be so embarrassed if my friends had experienced this. 
In the previous years I've been here, Trattoria was always filled with Japanese families and the staff were all friendly and a nice reminder of Japanese hospitality. Last week, the restaurant was completely empty on a Friday evening and there was a single waitress working the floor. This waitress was so rude/bitter to the point that it was comical. 
10 minutes into eating, my friend's bowl of pasta was HALF EATEN when she asked him if he was done....... What was she rushing us for? The non-existent line of people waiting to get in? After for real finishing our meal, she took our credit cards and disappeared for 10+ minutes. We had to ask her what was taking so long, instead of her telling us that the credit card machine was not working. After another 10 minutes with no updates, we had to be the ones to ask if we could just pay in cash. 20+ minutes and she never thought of giving an update or giving us an alternative. Realizing we didn't have enough cash for the meal, her response was, why doesn't one of you drive to the bank and take out money. You made my Japanese side look really, really bad. Also, surprise I speak Japanese. All of your comments about how annoyed you were about us to the staff in the back were 100 percent understood by me, but I'll let that slide. 
The pasta is better than any pasta you'll get at an Italian restaurant in the states and Japanese pasta isn't something you can order anywhere else. The non-existent competition you have is the only reason you're still open Trattoria. You used to be my favorite restaurant in Vegas, but now you're the last place I'll be recommending to friends. I would not want someone to get the wrong idea about Japanese hospitality from you guys. 
If you do happen to come here the parking lot will be a disaster to get into, park in the neighboring lots.

Portion sizes are perfect, not too little where you still want to eat after a meal and not too much where you can't even enjoy an appetizer and dessert with main course. Seriously if you go anywhere outside of America like Italy or Japan, these portion sizes are huge! We are just fatty Americans and honestly I could even have a smaller portion size so I can finish dessert and app without feeling stuffed but just satisfied. Everything was incredibly delicious and the entrees came out so hot and fresh! What an amazing way to kick off Vegas trip. I didn't know that italian food and authentic Japanese could be married so well with flavors from both coming through. Literally I recommend ordering all of these dishes and I would probably do it all over again next trip. It was the best garlic bread from any restaurant we have ever had with huge piled broiled chunks of garlic atop fresh bread drenched in olive oil and piping hot. I don't care for a lot of cheese or parm that some restaurants use but this one didn't seem to have that which I love. If ur a garlic lover, this is for u. The daikon salad was nice and cold and crisp and juicy and light and refreshing. Wagyu beef had the most amazing flavor without overpowering sauces, probably the some of the best beef I have ever eaten with nice char...I hate to say that it was better than a lot of the rib eye that I have eaten in some of the fancier steakhouses and michelin restaurants. Uni pasta was amazing too, at first I was iffy about ordering this because it was mixed with tomato cream and all I really wanted was the uni in the sauce but nope, this combo was perfect and the uni flavor really shined without that typically acidity that u would get from a tomato based sauce. The desserts were delicious too...we licked everything clean....prob out fav was the soft fresh Mochi and green tea gelato but I really liked the black sesame thing and also the panna cotta, I prefer a more delicately layered tiramisu but this one was still very good and light. I hope this restaurant does well and sticks around for a long time. I still have to try the egg yolk truffle parm carbonara next time!!!

Pasta is al dente and they offer an interesting variety of sauces. I tried the miso carbonara and it had the right amount of miso, not overpowering the light flavor of the cream sauce (meaning, not salty). I also saw on their menu that they offer squid ink pasta, which brought a lot of childhood memories. I'm definitely interested in trying their uni tomato the next time I go here.
The ambience is also nice. They were playing Italian music, but I would like to listen to bossa nova with that atmosphere. The service was nice and the server is very willing to answer any questions.

4377109,2017-12-01,7,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Trattoria Nakamura-ya is described by its owner as a ""Tokyo-style Italian"" restaurant, and after our visit here, I feel that is a PERFECT description!

Walking inside, with a fully Japanese staff greeting you at the door, you wonder, am I really in Vegas? Does Vegas have places like this? The ambiance and decor definitely lean towards an Italian restaurant, but you can't deny the Japanese influence, from the chefs being visible behind the counter (like a sushi bar!) to the unmistakably non-Italian ingredients incorporated into the appetizers, entrees, and pastas.

My favorite example of the meeting of the two cuisines was when we ordered one of the specials - the branzino. The waitress asked how we would like it prepared - as carpaccio for a more Italian style, or as sashimi for a more Japanese style. I really liked how flexible and versatile the chefs were to be able to offer both options. 

We ended up going with the branzino sashimi, in addition to ordering the garlic bread, kurobuta shabu shabu salad, miso carbonara, eggplant linguini, and kurobuta tonkatsu. We shared family style and three entrees, two appetizers, and two orders of garlic bread (plus regular bread!) were enough to reasonably fill up 5 people.

All the dishes came out fairly quickly and everything was flavorful! The Japanese and Italian aspects of all the dishes came together very well. Especially creative and delicious was the kurobuta tonkatsu, which was a tonkatsu cutlet but with mozzarella cheese inside - um, can you say amazing!? The miso carbanara and eggplant linguini were good - the boyfriend mentioned he probably could've downed a whole pasta entree by himself.

One of the only minor things was that they didn't catch one of our salad orders and we were left wondering if it was ever going to come out. The featured wine of the day was also a bit bland and not particularly worth the extra cost. However, overall, our visit was positive, staff was welcoming and friendly, prices were not exorbitant, and I would come back again to try the uni and squid ink pastas they are known for (and maybe some dessert)!",nTN0IuRJIsfPZKVk-Vl99Q,11,13,4,co3Wp-pPOg8d7Xr3SymBKw

My sister ordered the squid black noodles. FYI it will make your lips look like you smeared mascara all over it. It will come off but I recommend you going straight home after.

I'm not one for bread rolls, but the bread rolls here are absolutely amazing! Perfectly fluffy and just so delicious. But on to what people really come here for (though I would come back exclusively for the bread rolls if I didn't live so far away), we ordered the clam linguine in wine sauce and the miso carbonara. The linguine was very light yet had a really great clam flavor, the broth was delicious and we made sure not to leave a drop! The miso carbonara on the other hand was rich and creamy though the sauce had a slightly soupier consistency which caught me off guard at first but which I really ended up enjoying. The flavor again wasn't overly powerful but it was nice and well balanced. 

This was a really great meal paired with very attentive and friendly service. I look forward to coming back the next time I head to vegas !",lQqnueRjCYPTnVxk3_b7Kw,0,0,5,G6SKIPqqeWxLku-uIj7HBg
4401422,2015-05-26,5,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Wow. An Italian-Japanese restaurant. Yes, two completely different types of cuisines fused into one place to dine at and it is simply delicious! Come with an open mind!

I remember my first time coming here a few years ago was solely for the uni tomato cream spaghetti, but my memory's fuzzy about that visit. The only thing I remembered was eating the uni spaghetti dish, falling in love, and that's that! If you're a fan of uni at all (I know uni is the type of dish that's hit or miss...) this is a MUST try. I have to rave about this dish because it was just as delicious as I remember it. And there I go -- falling in love FOR THE SECOND TIME!

I love eating uni by itself at sushi places, but this dish is something. The second it hits your mouth, you'll taste the uni, but it is not overpowering. It is sooo creamy and rich in flavor, mixed with some subtle hints of alfredo(?) flavoring. I'm hungry thinking about it! 

Now to comment on the other foods:
Beef carpaccio was great! We also shared the octopus carpaccio. The beef carpaccio was better, but then again, I'm not the biggest fan of octopus. I like it, but I love beef more.

We then tried a steak dish where you dip the beef into green tea salt. I really enjoyed this as it was very juicy meat, but the dish itself was nothing spectacular. The green tea salt is a unique feature but does not actually add a *wow* factor to the dish itself.

The squid ink pasta was better than I expected, but nothing to rave about like the uni spaghetti. This dish would be great for seafood lovers as squid ink has a very ""seafood"" flavor to it that I enjoyed. Warning: this dish makes your lips tinted black! Take pictures! 

Lastly we tried a risotto with sausage and mushroom. It was very rich in texture and I was very amazed and how it tasted. I loved it, but was getting very full as this was the last dish served.

We were able to share 5 dishes between 4 people, kind of like tapas style.

Side note: the bread was actually very enjoyable! The bread being edible at Italian places could make or break the restaurant for me.

Overall, I love this place and would not mind coming back. Anyone I bring here MUST try the uni tomato spaghetti! No ifs, ands, or buts! It is a bit on the pricey side but it is definitely an adventurous ride that I would not mind dishing out for every now and then.",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,6,5,5,OkcubPuyBuNA_BKTwAWtdA

I was dying to try the uni carbonara based on all the enticing pics posted, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The sauce was super creamy with the perfectly cooked pasta. I'm definitely ordering that again. My husband opted for the Wagyu beef hamburg steak. It was a beef patty on mashed potatoes, which he enjoyed thoroughly. Even our young kids liked the food, but I have been training them early to eat unconventional dishes.

They did a great job coursing our the food too.. but the only thing that took away the point was the lack of service. I don't mind too much about servers not smiling but she didn't refill my friends drink not even once.. my friend had a glass of water and a glass of calpico juice. They were both empty and since I had my oolong tea, I gave her my water since I wasn't drinking it. After she finished my water, there were three empty glasses and the server didn't think to refill it which I found it odd. By the end of our meal, we were literally the only table left so they shouldn't have been too busy. It's not that big of a deal but since our server wasn't very attentive and she seemed like she was so done for the day, it made the experience not as good as it could have been.. but the food was absolutely wonderful as always.",PY0UMc96SIToqJ9X1WPyoA,1,0,4,jyZG8ZZl3Ay1soZcS7M0wQ

Realistically speaking,  it's overshadowed but this place is just as good as the other restaurants, if not better. The place itself is cozy and really clean. I think the fusion between Japanese & Italian food is unique and something new and refreshing that everyone should at least try once. So if you're craving both Japanese food & Italian food but can't decide which one to go for, this is the place for you! I've only tried their spaghetti Manila clam & asparagus, linguine Manila clam & shiso, spaghetti takana & Jidori chicken, and the dolce samplaer and they were all delicious.

I had the Uni tomato cream pasta. Seriously melts in your mouth so delicious and very filling!

My fianc√© had the kinoko (mushroom) pasta which he absolutely loved!

Experience:  I came with some friends to try out the fusion.  There were probably 8 of us. 

Food: the food was ok.  It was truly a mix of Japanese and Italian.  
I ordered the special where you get a drink, appetizer and meal for a set price. 
I got the baby octopus and Kinoko meat sauce on Fettuccini. 
The octopus was delicious!   Perfectly cooked with a light batter.  
The pasta was good, but I really struggled with the Asian flavors in the dish. I think I am just too Italian infused by my family and couldn't overcome the strange flavors in my normally Italian spices only sauce.

Service: the service was good. That is all I have to say about that. 

Facility: It's a small place.  We were actually the only folks in the restaurant, but I think it sits around 40 folks. 

Overall review: Everyone else seed to enjoy it. Just not my thing. I guess when you are raised on pasta sauce one way, it can be difficult to adjust.

TNY does not take reservations, so we took a gamble...lol...well, we are in Vegas.  We didn't have to wait too long and the little area had a number of different restaurants, some that seemed very popular with the Japanese community.  Parking is a nightmare.

The food is a very interesting...in my humble opinion, it's more like the Japanese take on Italian food.  I eat a lot of Italian, so it felt like I was in Japan and the chef was making his version of Italian food.  Each dish was unique, like the daikon salad, which tasted better if you tossed the sundried tomatoes with the daikon.  My miso carbonara was tasty though the sauce a little more like a thick broth.  I liked how it was served in a large bowl.

The partner had the chicken with a spicy sauce which he thought was interesting that they used thick Japanese noodles.  My mom's salad came without the chicken she wanted, so they politely redid it for her.  My dad loved his clams in white sauce.  We also ordered these mozzarella basil egg rolls....they were a little small but alright.  They also have a really nice wine list.

Overall, it's a really great place to try, especially if you want to eat something different.  The people are all very friendly and I can't wait to try some of the other items when I return.

The Happy Hour has a wide selection at very well discounted prices.  The wine is about 40-50 percent off the regular prices with glasses available at $3.50 and $5 plus two types of beer are only $2.50.  They have several pastas available for $7.99 and plenty of appetizers for $3.50.  We tried the fried oysters and bruschetta which were both very fresh and filling.

The mussels escargot style were amazing!  Too bad that isn't on the Happy Hour because that was my favorite starter.  We also had the soft shell crab which comes with a strong acidic oil  garlic dressing.  I liked it a lot, but my husband was not a fan because he wanted the crispy fried soft shell crab he was used to.  

This spot is definitely worth an early dinner so you can enjoy Happy Hour and also enjoy their popular main courses. The amount of food and drinks we got for $40/person was a steal!

The menu is very unique with its Italian-Japenese fusion dishes.  We have tried almost everything on the menu, and by far, the Uni Spaghetti is our favorite and we get it EVERY time we go there.

It's somewhere you'd expect to be taken to on a date night or for nice, long talks with girlfriends. Mind you, it's not an awfully big place so refrain from bringing in parties of more than 6. 

Trattoria is an elegant little restaurant along Lindell and Spring Mountain that fuses Italian and Japanese concepts into not only in their decor, but also their food. Tables were dimly lit with candles and as you enter, you could see the Japanese chefs preparing your food by what looked like a bar/counter. The ambiance was comfortable to say the least and service was excellent. I believe the server who greeted us with a bow and a smile as we entered managed to retain her sweet composure throughout the night (and I can understand how tiring their job can get) 

Food-wise, I can't put it in any less of a regard. 2 appetizers, 1 main dish and 2 lemonata drinks added up to only $30 and we were stuffed. My friend suggested the snowy crab salad (spinach, lettuce and shredded snow crab in vinaigrette) and  the Octopus Carpaccio (4 pieces of octopus - bitesized - in mayo and veggies) for appetizer then the Mentaiko Carbonara as our main course, which is basically carbonara (pasta in cream sauce with bacon pieces) mixed in with a special japanese-tasting sauce on top. I believe there was fish egg in there somewhere. Taste was flavorful and it was a best of both worlds (or countries) in every dish. 

Also, I absolutely loved how there was a black board on the side that listed their top 10 menu options. That way, choosing or knowing what to get isn't a problem. Everyone was friendly and as we motioned to head out, our server greeted us with a sweet 'arigatou gozaimasu', pushed open the door and smiled as we left, but not before doing the traditional Japanese bow.

It was easy to find because of the Italian flag background on their sign and I didn't realize it was next to all the other awesome establishments (Snowflake Shavery, Raku, Monta Ramen, Japanese Curry Zen).

Anyway, we sat and were assisted right away. The attentive and pleasant server gave us all the options: regular menu, prie fixe, and specials, but I already knew what I wanted since I've had my eye on this spot for a while. After placing our orders, we were given delicious bread and butter to start with adorable spreading knives.

For appetizers, we started with one of the specials, Kurobuta Pork Shabu Shabu Salad (9.50) and the Green Mussel: Three Ways (8.50). The pork was tender and warm served with fresh greens, thinly sliced sweet onions, and miso dressing. Really good and light! The green mussels were prepared with Mentaiko, Parsley Butter, and Sweet Miso. All really, really good. The mussels were cut in half, which made them very manageable with the mini spoons, and baked with their respective seasonings. It was also served with small toasts.

Then, we shared the Spaghetti Uni Tomato Cream (26.95) and Spaghetti Miso Carbonara (12.95). Both pastas were perfectly cooked. The uni, tomato, and cream worked so well together. Uni (sea urchin) has its own creaminess and to pair that with cream for the pasta sauce was brilliant. Great flavor. The carbonara was light in flavor and wonderful. Both dishes having cream and being pasta, you imagine heavy and overwhelming, but they have a great balance to prevent that. Very enjoyable and I loved that plastic tongs are given to serve into our individual bowls.

So on a summer Saturday night I pull into the packed complex where this restaurant is located and surprisingly Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is the only restaurant in here without a line out front, red flag much? Anyways, we proceed and are seated immediately, the service is stellar. We start with some Italian Spring Rolls and Bruschetta, the spring rolls were nothing special and there were only 4 of them! The bruschetta had several flavors, some of which were fabulous, others not so much.Then came the famous uni pasta and well, maybe I built it up too much because, well, it tasted like pasta, there was an extremely subtle hint of uni, not the flavor adventure I had hoped for. Then came the mussels, tasty, but not awesome. Finally the beef dishes arrived and I was really appreciative of the meat quality, both the carpaccio and the kobe had that melt-in-your-mouth texture that we all crave, but they also had that yucky sushi torch gun taste! You know what I'm talking about, that burn flavor that sushi chefs create using that little torch gun, eww, can't stand it. So anyways, I was hoping for a culinary experience and got more of a decent meal at a decent price, but nothing to write home about.",lIM5d1HsNmdkn9LzV8gKNw,0,0,3,HL4DXoll_p18onpr7XbFQw

try the beef carpaccio, it simply melts in your mouth. 

i tried the uni / tomato spaghetti, it was ok, not bad, it was good ok. it has its taste and texture, but something about that food had too much of something. 

finally the dessert, which made this a 4 stars. creme brulee was good but it was toooooooo watery. for my taste, creme brulee is suppose to be more pudding texture.

Their breads are very fresh and well done. I liked my garlic bread sans parmapriscitto. My friend had their signature dish uni tomato cream lingu and she loved it.

This is strange but I love Japanese food. And I love Italian food. But to mix the two could either be amazing or strange, as it turns out, it was amazing. It was rich yet delicate at the same time, casual but super prompt and friendly (as you should expect at any Japanese institution), and affordable!

* COMPLIMENTARY ROLLS (3.5 STARS): Pretty standard but soft rolls, the type you might find at Costco. Not sure what the hype is all about here but it was fine.

* SOFT SHELL CRAB ($9) - 5 STARS: At the time there was a daily special, $9 for a larger portion of fresh deep-fried soft shell crab. It was crispy and chewy and topped with an amazing concoction of greens and tomatoes. Hard to explain, odd sounding but completely delicious and unique.

* MISO CARBONARA ($12.95) - 4.5 STARS: Miso + carbonara are two of my favorite foods it's like they were reading my mind when they designed this dish. Carbonara can often be botched with too much cream or butter to cover up low quality noodles and ingredients. This miso carbonara was on the light side (for a cream dish), a bit soupy and reminded me of a light ramen (which I kind of liked), and delicate but rich in flavor. This was my favorite pasta of the night and also is part of the dinner combo special. 

* UNI TOMATO CREAM PASTA ($26) - 4 STARS: So creamy and so rich, topped with tons of uni, I could barely finish this. I'm not even an uni person usually, but I'm coming around. This dish was rated their #1 most popular dish so I figured I had to try it. I think this would be a great appetizer to share amongst 4 people but I think too heavy for one person to eat. 

So glad I ventured off the strip and I hope to come back next time I'm in Vegas for the Miso Carbonara!",5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ,4,2,4,eSWaIR3NSWY63UGo6RM2RQ
4974869,2013-02-16,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"This review is long overdue, but even more necessary after my most recent visit.

This is the sister restaurant of Kabuki Dining Bar on Maryland Parkway.  After a very pleasant experience at that location, I was pleased to find them on Spring Mountain and ensuring their complete food focus was purely Japanese Italian.  What would seem like an unusual combination somehow works so lovely together.

After taking your food and drink orders, wait patiently as they prepare your warm better and butter for you.

First visit:

Course B ($20.99):
* Octopus Carpaccio - We were expecting 'raw' octopus since it was carpaccio.  But it was still good nonetheless.
* Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style - The Husband enjoyed this as it was tasty and tender.
* Soy Milk Panna Cotta ""Okinawa Black Sugar"" Sauce - Very good, especially the black sugar sauce.  Yummy!

* Spaghetti Uni Tomato Cream ($27.95) - Decadent.

Second visit:

* Halibut Carpaccio ($14.95) - This came from the daily specials board.  Slices of halibut wrapped around asparagus and sprouts. Olive and radish slices are scattered along the plate with cracked pepper sprinkled on top.
* Spaghetti Uni Tomato Cream ($26.95) - I couldn't remember if I had ordered this before and I was dying to order this now.  It was SO good.  So overly decadent with chunks of warm sea urchin weaved in the pasta.  The only thing I could wish for was a bit more basil leaves for the nice contrast.  I can't believe I forgot that I had eaten this before when it's just so good and rich!  I even asked for more bread so I could soak up all the sauce from my plate!

Sadly, I've only been here twice. But then again, I'd probably go back and order the Spaghetti Uni Tomato Cream over and over!  There are other things I would love to try here, but this one just grabs me.  Plus, I've been meaning to try their other desserts but I was so full after that last visit.

Service was great both times - efficient, pleasant and just right.

4986655,2014-04-15,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Really like this place. How could you not. Two of my favorite cuisines, in one! I feel adventurous when I eat here also. haha. Only reason I say that is because the menu is very difficult to get an idea of how the dish is prepared. The items only have dish names, but no real description, so when looking at it, I don't fully understand how it's prepared or how it will come out, but I go for it anyway. Haven't really been let down yet. 

They offer a great Prix-Fixe menu, which allows you to try a couple of things, for a reasonable price. This is especially good considering I'm never positive what will come out. The Miso Carbonara is pretty darn good, however since trying it here, I've learned to make my own version of it at home and I will say that mine is a little better (sorry) so now I don't order it here anymore. I've ordered the Fettucini Parma Prosciutto Carbonara is really good also. Kind of tastes like fall with the nutmeg. Almost like it was cooked in Egg Nog which might actually be a great idea. Lightbulb!

I've also tried the Wagyu Beef & Kurobuta Pork Hamburger Steak which was to die for. Holy cow! So good. The Kurobota Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" style was also really good. Definitely more towards the Italian side, rather that Japanese. 

I highly recommend trying this place. It was definitely a hidden surprise once we did try it. Oh and the warm dinner roll basket is bomb.",WRnqI0l71Bi9wK2wsnETSQ,0,1,5,PakGtGUDBbj6ryX5xsMMTA

They were both delicious but they went very light on the toppings so I basically paid $13.25 for a bowl of pasta with green onions and a few pieces of meat in it. My friends dish literally had two small bits of beef in it.

I ordered the Carbonara Miso and Karaage.

The Karaage app was a blend of balsamicized Italian salad with Japanese fried chicken. The flavors worked. The fattiness of the chicken was cut nicely by the balsamic glaze. I enjoyed this dish. The chicken was juicy and well executed. 

The Carbonara miso was thin buckwheat ramenesque noodles tossed with a light miso & cream sauce with crunchy bits of panko and some veggies. I generally found this dish slightly unbalanced with little to counteract it from feeling very milky.

5051545,2013-01-22,2,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"I have my siblings in town and I was thinking of places I loved that were sure to impress and had something set up, but then they threw the curveball that dinner has to be late. That knocked pretty much everything off my list, but this place is open until 12am. I hoped it would deliver. Not only was this a hit with everyone, this has been one of the better, unique and reasonably priced meals to be had in our city. 

Appetizers - 

They start you off with lovely warm bread. It reminds me of this sweet bread I used to have growing up so I happen to really love their bread buns here. Save some or ask for more to sop up sauce! 

I got the soft shell crab with balsamic sauce. The crab was crisp and light and the sauce was bold with tanginess, garlic and kind of a umami salty element to it. Diced tomato and a bit of greens went well with it. Definitely was nice. 

My brother got octopus carpaccio. Very lovely freshness to the octopus and not tough at all. My BF doesn't really like chewy things but that he said was good. I thought olives and diced tomatoes with it would be weird with octopus and the  sauce, but it made sense once you ate it. 

My sister got mussels escargot style, 3 ways. There was one that looked like it had the garlic balsamic, a spinach cheese and one I couldn't remember the same of. I took a bite of one and it was lovely on toasted bread slices they bring you. Then use some of the soft bread rolls to sop the butter and sauce after! 

Entrees - 

I had the special of the day - fresh salmon and ikura / salmon roe fettucine in cream sauce.It had a basil on top so I shredded that to small bits for the pasta and a tiny bit of red pepper sprinkled on it. I love the bit of saltiness from the roe, the herbaceous fragant flavor of the basil with the rich creamy sauce. Rich, flavorful, but in a delicate way... not overpowering at all. Loved mine! 

My brother got the tomato cream fettucine with broccoli and kurobuta sausage. I liked that the smokiness of the sausage was lightly throughout the sauce. My cousin got a thin spaghetti with jidori chicken which was subtle and good. It had some mustard greens in it and seaweed that set it off. My sister and my boyfriend both got the risotto with mushrooms and kurobuta pork sausage. My BF perfected risotto at home (one of the few things he decided he wanted to learn to cook) and this was perfect consistency and seasoning that impressed even him. My BF wasn't a fan of the sausages as it's sort've hot dog like, but I appreciated the smokiness of it with the creamy risotto and the nice earthy mushrooms (enoki and kinoko).

A- la- carte is reasonable enough priced, but for an even better deal they do a pre-fixe of a appetizer, pasta, and a beverage (beer, house wine or soda) for $17.99 or appetizer, specialty entree and beverage for $19.99. It isn't limited either, you pick your own! You can pretty much order most of the menu for the pre fixe, except for the priciest items like the uni pasta or the risotto the BF and my sister ordered. I wanted the special pasta and she let me do it for the  pasta pre-fixe. my brother did pre fixe as well. Just a note they have a website with a menu online but its slightly outdated in that there are a few more items now (and some items are cheaper now than the old menu). It gives you a idea of what to expect though. The quality of food is something that you would think would be double the price it actually is so it feels like a steal of a deal at what they charge. 

Do not miss the delicate desserts! 

Black sesame blanc manger - I've had a running joke with David S. because I misread the menu as them serving black sesame on black managers so I had to order it.  Nicely creamy consistency like a brulee, lightly sweet only with the sesame nutty, earthiness showing through. They top it with berries and a bit of cream. 

Green tea panna cotta with black bean sauce is fantastic too. Great pure matcha flavor and the red bean paste, cream and fruit on top set it off nicely. 

Nakamura tiramisu- I like Japanese versions of tiramisu as its fluffier and lighter than the American way of doing this Italian dessert. The sponge is fluffier and the cream is more whipped and it's generally less wet. I've really grown a liking for this take. 

Service was great. Super sweet, friendly, unobtrusive and attentive in that very Japanese hospitable way.  We left a bit after closing and they had zero attitudes about it. Normally people get a bit restless looking even if they aren't saying anything, but she was totally sincere about taking our time. I had to tip her a bit more just for that alone.  

This is one of those places I've been meaning to go for the longest time and now I'm kicking myself for not being a regular since day one. I don't  give first time 5 stars as I save it for consistency usually,  but I know this will be undoubtedly a favorite. It was that good!

The dishes on the special were their Uni Tomato Cream Pasta and their Squid Ink Spaghetti.  A  Japanese Italian fused restaurant... of course I called right away and booked a reservation.

My party of 2 had a reservation at 9 and when we got there our table was ready and waiting for us.  The restaurant is on the small side and because of their specials every seated was filled.  So I'm super happy that I made the reservation.  

We started our meal with two of their appetizers

A small order of their Fried Oysters - They come out really hot so be careful.  The batter was nice and crispy and the oysters were perfectly cooked on the inside.  Their tartar sauce really unnecessary, but it wasn't bad if you like it.  

Their Balsamic Soft Shell Crab - I think they should rename it to Garlic Balsamic Soft Shell Crab because there is a very healthy portion of Garlic in this dish.  To me that is a great thing because I love garlic.  The crab was cook beautifully and tasted great, I only wish it was bigger, but what can you do.

Now onto the main courses:

Squid Ink Spaghetti - This dish was different and fun to order.  The squid ink could be tasted in what I think was a white clam sauce.  I thought it was a good dish, but it does have one drawback.  The squid ink stains your whole mouth black while you are eating it.  So be sure you are ordering with someone you are comfortable with and a first date.  

Unit Tomato Cream Pasta - This was so clearly the star of the meal.  It was amazing!  The sauce was creamy and delicious.  You could clearly see the many pieces of Uni in your pasta.  I would have never guess to put those flavors together, but I was amazing.  It was such an amazing treat and for it to be 50% off was unbelievable.  This is must try, even at its full price, if you come here

Tried the prix fixe menu, one app, one entree, and one drink.  The only beer available for the special is PBR...surprising for a Japanese spot.  Oh well, at least it was in a bottle!  Ordered some large Kirin afterwards for around $7 a bottle I think.

I really enjoyed the appetizers! 

We started with the Italian spring rolls, which were filled with cheese and other goodies.  Very very small, but it was a good flavor though!  

The octopus carpaccio came with 4 nice sized pieces of fairly tender octopus, but what made them stand out was the slight horseradish/wasabi taste in the sauce.  Love the sauce!  Check out the pic :

I will say that I LOVE Japanese food.  I LOVE Italian food.  But for some reason, when I combine the two, it didn't blow me away.  Yes, it was good, but it wasn't great to me.  Lots of other people here don't feel this way, but I did.

We tried the Spaghetti Asari and Tarako (Clam and Cod Roe) and Miso Carbonara.  The clams and noodles were in a surprisingly sweet sauce. It was good, especially the parts with the roe...wish there was more roe.  I only tried a bite of the Miso Carbonara, but it was another sweet, but milky consistency.  A shot of it :

It just melted in your mouth and the sauce was made to perfection. The Squid Ink Pasta seriously scared the shit out of me, but it was actually really good. The only down fall to that was that it made my lips and teeth black. But it didn't stain it. One wipe with the napkin and I was good to go.

The Seafood Pasta was pretty good. I think it was like any other place. The Soft Shell Crab Pasta was pretty good. I liked the concept of the Soft Shell Crab in Pasta but the sauce was the same as the Seafood Pasta, so the taste was a normal taste.

Overall the experience was good. Great service, food came out fast, the food was delicious for the most part and it wasn't as expensive as I thought (even though it is pricey, but it's good seafood and Kobe Beef).",pe7xOX3y1JDM3F5ym5Re0g,3,1,5,heXdNZ9XikUwQs9SrVXulA

Bearing in mind that my mother is not the most adventurous of eaters it was with some hesitation that I suggested Trattoria Nakamura-Ya for Saturday dinner but taking into account the strong reviews, affordable price point, convenient location, and willingness to show SEC and BIG-10 Championship games it seemed a safe bet...if only the service would have been remotely competent and I'd avoided the bilious piece of octopus bruschetta.  Truly a small space, the max seating capacity only 32 and just one other diner present when we arrived, it seems perplexing to me that so much of our meal could have gone wrong and even taking into account the language barrier when considering a forgotten order of the Uni Tomato Cream there is still no excuse for plates sitting at the pass long enough to grow tepid or for the soggy, flavorless ""spring rolls"" and oily though admittedly flavorful chicken.  Speaking to the quality of the mains and giving credit where it is due I will note that aside from the tomatoes accompanying the pork being only room temperature both the Tonkatsu and the Carbonara were innovative and well prepared while the desserts, complimentary on account of the forgotten pasta, were both comfortable if not particularly exciting...not exactly a ringing endorsement and certainly not enough to bring me back with so many better options for both food and service steps away.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,2,2,UsDkR5MHIrGfSYXD3BiaSA

After having dessert next door, I was still hungry. Tonight, my sister and I must've picked two of the best dishes here: spaghetti uni tomato cream and, kurobuta sausage and kinoko mushroom cream risotto (both aren't part of the prix fixe menu options). We started off with Italian spring rolls.

Italian Spring Rolls:
Prosciutto, basil and mozzarella wrapped in wonton then deep-fried. The flavors were very mild. It could use more basil. The mozzarella was ooey-gooey and the prosciutto added saltiness. 4/5

Spaghetti Uni Tomato Cream:
You can still see bits of uni. The sauce is a bit creamy and has a hint of uni so it's not overpowering which I think is perfect. If it had more uni flavor to it, it would've been overkill. 5/5

Kurobuta Sausage and Kinoko Mushroom Cream Risotto:
Slices of sausage and mushrooms in hot and creamy risotto. Their risotto dishes take about 25 minutes to cook so, if you're very hungry or in a rush, you might not want to wait for risotto. The wait was worth it though, this has been one of the most delicious and most inventive version of risotto I've had. It's very filling. I was getting full but there's something about the flavor that kept me wanting to eat more. This may be my favorite dish from Nakamura-ya. 5 (or even more)/5

Their dishes are reasonably priced. They have happy hour  from 2-5pm with pasta for $7.99 and appetizer for $3.50. Prix fixe dinner with pasta, appetizer and a drink for $17.99 OR chef's special, appetizer and a drink for $19.99.  Service was good.

We had snow crab meat salad, soft shell crab and bruschetta for appetizers.  They were all very tasty and soft shell crab was the star of the night.

For pasta we ordered spaghetti calamari, fettuccine with salmon & ikura.  The sauce of spaghetti calamari was on the light side, which is a perfect choice if u want something light, however there was only 7 small pieces of calamari in the pasta.  The fettuccine was more creamy compared to the spaghetti, sauce was very delish however i cant really taste the salmon.  And there was only 11 tiny cubes of salmon scattered on the noodles.  The pasta and sauce was really good however i would really love to see they would add more protein in the dishes in the future.  

Everything was fine until I had a bite on the linguini uni.  One star took away from the ""famous"" dish linguini uni, it tasted ok, but it stank bad! It didn't smell fresh to me.  When i had my uni pasta in UMC Los Angeles, the uni didn't stink, it smelt good! But this linguini uni smell so rotten & fishy. Yuck.

5349217,2013-10-11,1,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"I had originally wanted to try this place because of their Uni Tomato Cream Pasta. People have raved about it, one of my friends raved about it, and one of my friends had wanted to try it. That and I had tried a uni pasta in NYC and fell in love with the flavors so I had to try this ... 

Three friends and I had wanted to go to Trattoria Nakamura-Ya for lunch but they opened at 2 pm so we settled for a late lunch. So we pretty much went in right as they opened so still empty. But the establishment was nice and quaint.

 One of my friends and I decided to split an appetizer and an uni tomato cream pasta. We had the kurobuta sausage with a ratatouille sauce appetizer (or at least I think that's what it's called). It was pretty good with a tiny spicy kick to it. I liked it. 

As for the uni tomato cream pasta ... I have to disagree that it's the best item on the menu. Because if it is, then there's not much to offer. Granted, my statement is kind of bold considering the uni tomato cream pasta is the only pasta dish that I've tried from here. But no worries, I was still not impressed regardless. Don't get me wrong .. it was good, just not the best for me. 

Of course, I can't blame it all on the restaurant. I have to put partial blame that we are in Las Vegas. The uni that was used in the pasta wasn't fresh. Uni, to me personally, is fabulous when it's sweet but it tastes like ocean/salt water when not fresh. So when you put uni in a pasta that's not fresh, it ruins the whole dish for me, giving it a weird aftertaste along with that. 

Another note is that because it's a tomato cream sauce, added on to the fact that uni has a creamy consistency, the tomato cream actually fights the uni for the spotlight in this dish. Does that even make sense? Well, I would've thought that the uni would be the spotlight and main ingredient to the dish so you would try to compliment it in every way possible that would show the uni in good light. However, the tomato cream kind of negates that ... instead of complimenting the uni, it balances the uni and almost can cover it completely. 

I'm kind of glad I shared this dish with my friend. Otherwise, I wouldn't have finished it at all. Anyways, maybe next time I'll try something different on the menu and see how that goes.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,6,1,3,tR7JIIqJjYUjqYWnJ5u43g

Last year I went with a group of 6 and we did the set menus which was fun bc everyone ordered different things and I got to try a lot of the menu.  I can't remember everything we got that time as it's been over a year now. 

This past labor day weekend we were headed to Vegas again and i suggested going for dinner. A lot of people in our group of 23 already were interested in going so i called to make a reservation.  They were super accommodating and worked with me to put together a set menu that would have something for everyone. 

We got the mushroom salad, caprese salad, kurabota sausage and fried oysters as appetizers, the Tokyo style Hamburg, uni tomato cream pasta and mimiko meat sauce pasta as entrees. Everything was served family style. 

I'm honestly not a fan of uni, except for when I had it in Japan but it's not very seafoody here when mixed with the pasta.  I still like cafe mami Hamburg set better (might just be nostalgia) but the one here was pretty good and the meat sauce pasta was interesting. You could taste the meat but it was so well blended in it wasn't like you were chewing chunks of meat. To boot we had a vegetarian in our group who doesn't eat eggs so she couldn't eat any of the entrees so they made a special risotto for her that she said was delicious. 

Service was awesome both times. Never once had to ask for more water or anything as they were always on top of their game.

For the four parties there, there were almost as many servers. That is good, because I like the attentive service. My water glass was consistently full while dirty plates and silverware were exchanged constantly. 

The prices are mid range, with the most expensive thing costing $24, so the fine dining style of service was nice. I am not sure why it is, but every Asian/Italian fusion restaurant I have came across is fond of cream based sauces. I would have loved to try one of their pasta dishes, but can only stomach so much cream. Instead, we got the Fritto Misto($10.95), because fried foods are infinitely better for you. The dish comes with two skewers of calamari, two pieces of octopus, four shrimp, and four pieces of zucchini that are all lightly coated in panko and fried crisp. They come out hot, so watch your mouth. The marinara is a light and chunky perfection. It also comes with tartar sauce. For our entree, we split the Fresh Oysters and Watercress Risotto($14.95). It is creamy, rich, decadent, and the ratio of oysters to watercress was jaw dropping. The only criticism I have was about the aftertaste. It had a reminisce of mayo that lingered. It was faint enough to overlook. I stopped eating because I was full, not due to the taste.

My friends and I came conveniently during HH hours (3-5p) which had some really great selections, but all of us ventured for other items on the regular menu anyway. 

I opted for the place's prix-fix menu that gives you the option of one appetizer, one entree, and one ""specialty"" beverage (i.e. beer, wine, select soft drinks).  I ordered the Soft Shell Crab for appetizer, Spaghetti Mentaiko Carbonara, and got Limonata Pellegrino for my drink.  The Soft Shell Crab appetizer was probably the best part of my meal. It wasn't overtly salty, and deep-fried just enough to not be covered in grease. The mentaiko carbonara, on the other hand, was not so pleasing. This was a white sauce pasta dish with fish roe on top. The roe was great, but the pasta was way too rich for my liking. The cream sauce was way too creamy, and I got sick of it after a while. 

My friends were also not so sold on their entrees as well. This place is commendable for their valiant creative efforts in bringing Japanese and Italian cuisine into one, but it was not my cup of tea.

We started off with their Snow Crab Meat salad which was very light and perfect as a healthy appetizer. And then we of course ordered the popular Uni Spaghetti here which is the main reason why we wanted grub here to begin with. And also ordered a special they had that night, the Salmon & Ikura Fettucine. 

In a sense we ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. We tried the ""house wine"" which is what comes with the Prix Fixe menu orders but opted to pay a little more for a glass of one of their other wines that's listed on the wine list (their house wine wasn't all that great).

Eating the Uni Spaghetti that night was life changing for me. I seriously would have been much happier we ordered maybe 3-4 orders of that spaghetti alone.

They have about 16 different apps ranging from $5-8 dollars and about 16 different pasta entrees ranging from $10-20.  They also have a selection of chef special pastas and entrees as well.  Currently, they have a pre fixe menu for $17.99+ tax that includes an appetizer, pasta entree, house beer/wine or soft drink.  We opted to do the pre fixe since it seemed like a pretty good deal.

The bread comes out fluffy and warm with a hint of sweetness.  We also tried the baby octopus karaage.  The octopus was cooked perfectly but I was hoping for a little more seasoning salt.  Next came the pastas, we tried the fettuccine with salmon and ikura.  The noodles were cooked al dente and the ikura added the right balance of salt.

Immediately greeted. Thank You! Believe me...I have been to businesses sitting empty and had to stand there awkwardly. Not here. Service was absolutely wonderful. Very attentive, friendly, and plain out on point. 

It's a Japanese-italian fusion wonderfully done. I ordered their nakamura-ya style bruschetta. The octopus with the avocado and wasabi mayo was absolutely my fave on that plate. The other two, while delicious, was just not as beautiful in my wife as the octopus. Lol.
My friend wanted their garlic bread. He has had his fair share of experience in a kitchen and he said that was the best garlic bread he's had. I wouldn't know. He didn't share. Hahahha. Clearly, it was too good he didn't want to offer me some. All good as I didn't want my palate to get mixed up with what I had. Def didn't want the garlic breath.

I ordered the spaghetti tuna. The dish was rather generous in serving as I didn't finish it all. Noodles were cooked to al dente.. which is perfect because that's how I like it. The dish was not overly fishy, and I found the flavor to be light. The vegetables were crisp and not soggy. Just awesome.

Finally, we shared the Nakamura-ya's 3 sampler. THIS was a hit for us two. I was in dolce heaven. My friend and I swear were practically having food-gasms at the table. Lmao. Honestly, I'm not one for dessert after dinner. On this night, I was more than happy to have had dessert. Each dessert sampled was absolutely yummy. Our fave was the panna cotta and the black sesame. I'm not much of a tiramisu type gal, so I was surprised that I even enjoyed it here.

They offer interesting things on their menu that you've probably seen on tv and wished we had somewhere to go eat it. Uni cream....squid ink? Tis here, folks.

This was such a wonderful experience for us. Haven't had such a great dining experience where everything was wonderful in soooo long until I had dinner here. I'd personally leaves the kids at home as it would be a better experience without them and didn't think the menu was kid friendly or appetizing unless your kid has some serious tastebuds. I'd take my 10 year old here, but definitely not my 8, 4, and 2 year old. 

Parking in this complex can be a bitch...yes. But I Highly recommend this place! Enjoy!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,3,4,Y6w6QcFsdsg6F5ph707c1g

Everything was delicious, the service was exceptional, and the restaurant was empty. :) My bf and I were originally going to do to Lee's BBQ, but after reading Yelp reviews we changed our minds and I had been wanting to go to Trattoria Nakamura-Ya for a couple months after I found it when picking up food from Big Wong's next door. Italian-Asian Fusion...YES PLEASE!!

Turns out they have happy hour from 2 to 5, we got there with 8 minutes to spare and the waitress totally hooked us up and placed all our HH orders first while we perused the full menu. Off HH we got the Fried ""Jidori"" Chicken, Italian Spring Roll, Grilled ""Kurobuta"" Sausage Ratatouille, Green Tea Gelato, and Soy Milk Panna Cotta. From the Main dishes, we shared the ""Waygu"" Beef & ""Kurobuta"" Pork Hamburg Steak. 

EVERYTHING was delicious, I would add a touch of something sweeter to the Green Tea gelato, like a condensed milk drizzle or something to take the slight bitter/earthiness of the green tea but other than that... I really enjoyed everything I ate. The hamburg steak was the best I've ever had in my life, from anywhere. The service was impeccable and I super enjoyed that we were there while it was empty.

Neither of us were too hungry so we got the #1 most popular dish - uni tomato cream linguini ($26) - to share. 

Service was impeccable and the ambiance of the small restaurant was cozy and homey. Really lovely.

Freshly baked butter rolls will be served after you order. They're quite delicious with some really good butter.

The pasta came relatively quickly as the restaurant was pretty empty. Portion size was pretty good considering it's uni. I really liked it. The uni was rich and creamy, more sweet than briny. There weren't too many chunks of uni, as to be expected, but if you do get one with a bite of pasta, it's heavenly.

The cream sauce is on the heavier side, so if you're eating it on your own, get a starter salad or come hungry.

We stumbled upon this restaurant on Saturday evening around 5:30pm.  With my small knowledge on Japanese/Italian fusion cooking techniques, I was just assuming that there aren't many dishes can be created into Japanese flavored pasta dishes on the menu besides conventional dishes.  All I could imagine and think of ingredients were some sort of flying fish roe on angel hair pasta, sesame oil flavored dish, yuzu citron sauce, or the dish with ginger garnish.  Well, I was wrong.  There were so many items to choose from.  And also, they had 7 to 8 different style of dishes for Special of the Day. 
Finally, we decided to share two dishes from the Special Menu:
1. ""Casago Black Mussel ($25.95)""
     -Very tender & sweet fish
     -Small size of winter black mussels w/ tangy tomato sauce(it was sure to  impress!!)
2. ""Scallop & Shrimp Pasta (under $20)""
     -The texture of pasta was just right
     -Good portion for two people
     -Scallops & Shrimps were well cooked( not tough or rubbery tasty at all)
*I was thinking that the chef was making sure these two ingredients were comparable in size so they had similar cooking time for the best taste :) 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and very charming ambiance.  It was definitely a cozy dining experience for me.  Maybe, they could accommodate no more than 30 customers at one time.  There are still many dishes I'd love to try out from the menu, like Black Squid Ink Pasta and some other creative desserts.  The servings are on the medium to large sizes which encourage sharing with companions.

When the bestie invited me to dine there during their 3rd anniversary, the two most popular dishes of Linguini Uni Tomato Cream and the Spaghetti ""Ikasumi"" Squid Ink were half-off the normal price ($26.95 and $19.95, respectively).  Trusting that girlfriend wouldn't steer me wrong, I figured this would be an excellent time to finally try these exotic (to me) dishes.  Arriving around 6:00pm on a Wednesday, there was a line at the door as expected.  Checking in with the hostess, you can leave your phone number and get a call when your table is ready.  We waited 45 minutes for a table to open up.  Once seated, we were waited on quickly.  We ordered both the uni and squid ink pastas, more than enough for the two of us to share.  The Linguini Uni arrived at the table first and it was definitely delicious; I really loved the tomato cream sauce.  I couldn't really distinguish the taste of the uni, however, so I will have to try uni in another dish some other time.  The squid ink spaghetti came next and I was already getting full from the uni dish.  Other than its black color, this pasta is not as scary as it looked (to me).  If you tasted it blindfolded, you would not expect it to be squid ink or black; it tasted a bit garlicky and was very flavorful.  But, the uni was my favorite of the two and I would have it again.  Japanese and Italian fusion is an interesting concept and I look forward to another visit to try the Miso Carbonara and to have more of the uni.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,3,4,x4nwXm9klcc1DRKEpoQeYQ

We'd been to Nakamura once before with a bigger group of friends we met here.  I don't recall being blown away though hubby really enjoyed his gorgonzola and natto pasta.  So here we came for a late dinner, after watching a show.

We started with their beef carpaccio (possibly the star of the evening though a third of it was inexplicably cooked).  We also ordered their home-made garlic bread which came with some prosciutto on top.  Also very good.

Hubby went with the Manila Clams and Tarako while I decided to splurge and get the Uni Tomato Cream with Scallops.  

When our dishes came, I immediately recognized the kind of pasta hubby got...brothy and sort of on the bland side.  The saving grace was the shiso which gave it a flavor boost but otherwise, neither of us really preferred this style of pasta.

My Uni Tomato Cream with Scallops was better than hubby's but still not mind-blowing.  I wish there would have been 25% more uni flavor, that the pasta was more al dente and the scallops were not so well done.

At this point, we definitely felt the appetizers outshined the pasta.  
Service was friendly though it did take a while for us to get out of there. 

So I guess we weren't super disappointed in our meal but, as we do, we ended up going somewhere else for dinner #2 shortly after.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,4,3,3,Sxk7Cb6EKxZqugxWu8LZNg

SERVICE

As with pretty much almost any Japanese restaurant, service is ON POINT. Waitresses knew their stuff, were quick, friendly, polite, and just all around lovely. The only drawback was that I ordered a daikon salad appetizer and it did not come until the end of the meal...Free refills on bread totally made me forget about that.

There is gratuity for parties of 6+

ATMOSPHERE

Cozy and warm and oh-so-classy. My friend got ginger ale and it came in a nice glass bottle with a serving glass! Yes, I get amused by simple things. Appropriate choice of music as well.

Warning: space is limited, so there is a wait during peak hours.

FOOD

Bread rolls - they were so magically warm and soft on the inside but crisp on the outside. Such a good starter!
Uni cream pasta - perfectly balanced, not too heavy, generous amount of actual uni, well-portioned
Squid ink pasta - stains!, taste was pretty good, not my favorite
My friend's pasta with kurobuta sausage - decent
----came with calamari - wonderfully crisp and not overcooked!
----salad - standard

Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is conveniently located in a strip mall in Chinatown, so you can stain your shirt with squid ink pasta and get it cleaned on the same day. It is also easy to find because there is a bright shining light on the restaurant that has the restaurant's name in all capitals. The meal started off with the bruschetta, which were actually kind of good. The octopus with wasabi cream was too good to explain in words and the other two were just great. We also ordered the beef carpaccio and cheese platter as appetizers. The beef carpaccio was very good but it could have used some more arugula for more of a textural contrast. Cheese platters usually don't excite me but this one was amazing. However, the mini caprese salad that came with the cheeses was overdressed. It was more like balsamic soup with ovalini mozzarella, basil, and cherry tomatoes. For the entr√©e course, everyone ordered the uni pasta which was super great. Most Americans do not like uni, or sea urchin, because of it's booger-like texture. This uni was very smooth after being blended with cream and tomatoes. The pasta also came with scallops, which tasted amazing but lacked the hard sear it needed.

We also got the kobe outskirt steak and I would give that a 2 star. The dish came with a few slices of steak and garnishment. For $20 I think the restaurant can add a side salad to it. The steak itself didn't have a great taste to it. Tasted like reheated microwaved steak...yeah kinda gross.

The BEST main course  dish we had was the SPICY CHICKEN JIDORI pasta. That was the saving grace of me returning to this place ever again. the sauce had a great flavor and a good kick to it. It wasn't heavy and you get some protein with the chicken. 

For appetizers we got the mussels escargot. It came with 6 pieces and 3 different flavors. I only liked the cheese flavored one, but my sister liked the miso flavor...so it might be something you'd like to try on your own and find out for yourself. 

The soft shell crab was great. The sauce was really good. It was my favorite appetizer that we ordered and we ordered a lot. Everything else was just mediocre.

Dessert, definitely go for the Panna Cotta. I'm not a dessert person because I'm not a big fan of sweets, but even the Panna Cotta got me eating it.",uutnjYooQZBURPx-BypvHw,1,1,3,qgZCXURNev_kIsHc5dKriw

The salmon entree was solid, but I'd say unspectacular--the flavor wasn't quite as pronounced or sophisticated as I would've liked. The pasts was more toward al dente,  though this is more a preference than a critique--I am not a fan of al dente. The dessert, a tiramisu, was solid, not the most memorable but definitely solid.

Both were amazing. So creamy and rich. Every bite had a piece of buttery uni on it. It was heaven!! Thank you so much to our hostess/waitress and all the chefs for letting us stay late to enjoy that delicious food. We loved it!!",oJ1XbEEY62hxitLpRUpEAQ,1,0,5,eoOw8npqloIxbXY-Vh5DSA
5844186,2016-11-13,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"I've always struggled with Japanese-Italian infusion and even after dining here at Nakamura-Ya, I still continue to struggle to enjoy it. 

This place is small and the parking lot situation is not so great. It's in the same plaza as Raku and Monta, which are popular dining spots on Spring Mountain Road.

Tried a few dishes, but I'll highlight some notables.

Uni Pasta - you usually can't go wrong with uni with anything, right? If you like uni, you'll like this dish. Apparently, this is their number one seller. I would say the dish could use some more uni, but overall it's a well-balanced dish. Savory sea flavor from the uni and creaminess from the tomato cream sauce enables this dish to warrant the #1 position. Must try if you dine here.

Squid Ink Pasta - with every bite the sea essence flavor comes through. Yes, the pasta is inked black, but overlook it and you'll enjoy every bite. This dish is served with sauteed calamari, which tasted fresh and with just enough chewy texture.

Wagyu Meat Sauce Kinoko Spaghetti - flavorful, but a bit too creamy. I could barely taste the meat sauce and the amount of cream overpowered any other flavors. The spaghetti was cooked properly, but probably a bit softer than al dente. The kinoko mushrooms tasted acceptable, but then again, that cream sauce overpowered all other potential flavors.

Pan Fried Calamari - too chewy and I had to chew each piece for quite a while. The lemon butter sauce was pretty good and the toasted almonds helped add some texture to this appetizer. Lots of potential, but the star of the dish, the calamari, failed to meet expectations.

Service was friendly and prompt. The combo packages can save you a few bucks - especially if you get some red or white wine. More like 3.5 stars and potential 4 or 5 for me once I have the opportunity to try some of their other top 10 dishes.",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,6,4,3,mrKY5o2GGFOKnpaQNN6b6Q
5846089,2016-12-31,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"The caring that goes into the food and to us as their customers- we will definitely be back!

We had the fried oysters and soft shell crab for appetizers.  

For entrees, pasta with shrimp and mushroom and the linguini with clams.  Both hit the spot! 

The linguini with clams had just the right amount of garlic flavor, and the broth (yes broth) was set somewhere in the delicious and comfort realm.

I was only afforded one bite of the pasta with shrimp and mushroom- and from there- the bowl was almost back to clean when the servers cleared our dishes. 

We'll be back-probably again and again!",Yp_rw7oHnGULuRPKFHnjWw,0,0,5,-MzP9Nd8M-k3P7mue9TWtA

5862868,2016-10-26,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"I've tried very few Japanese Italian fusion restaurants, but the result seems to be always good.  Never is the pasta cooked past al dente and that is really important to me.  Also, I really wanted to try the uni tomato cream pasta.  Wow, the yelp pics had me salivating!

Uni tomato cream pasta- Delicious and def had the uni taste.  Almost too rich though.  The sauce was so thick, it was almost like melted velveeta.  7.75/10

Squid Ink pasta- Very garlicky and oniony.  I thought it was cute how it left the black ring around everyone's mouth.  I actually liked this better than the uni!  8/10

Mushroom Meat Pasta- Sorry, I forget the name right now.  Kinoko?  It was on the happy hour menu for well under half the price of the other pastas that we ordered.  This was really good, too.  Very, very flavorful.  I want some of this now!  8/10

Mentaiko Carbonara- Light in flavor and in taste esp when paired with the any of the other pastas.  Not much mentaiko.  6.5/10

Eggrolls- I want to say there was cheese and some meat in there.  Thought it was fine.  5/10

Bruschetta- There were three different flavors:  tuna, mozzarella, and I forget the third one now...haha, sorry.  I think it had wasabi, and it was actually my favorite of the three.  They were all very good, though.  7.5/10

Dark Chocolate gelato- Rich and you get two small scoops along with a vanilla wafer.  It was fine.  5/10.  

I would give this 4.5 stars, and would definitely return to try more of their pastas.  We came particularly for happy hour, but didn't end up ordering but one entree from the happy hour menu (and the appetizers were all from the HH menu).  It's good quality food for a fair price.  I can't wait to come back!",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,1,0,5,814ncm6wiRM_x8YQoS0MbA
5900260,2015-02-13,0,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,This place is so good. Service is great as the staff is very attentive.

5902834,2016-11-11,1,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"My boyfriend and I came here for their 5 year anniversary and their popular dishes were half-off. We were really intrigued by their uni pasta. I love uni, and my boyfriend hates it, but we both ordered it. We were too scared of the black squid ink pasta, and when I asked my boyfriend, ""why on earth did you order an uni dish when you don't even like uni??""

""It's the most popular thing on the menu."" Uh okay.
 
FOOD:

Bruschetta ""Nakamura-ya"" style: 3.5/5
It was good, but I felt like I could've gotten something better for my money like the calamari. But hey, I was feeling adventurous. The octopus, wasabi bite was interesting. The mozzarella, anchovy bite was creamy and very fishy, similar to salmon roe. The tuna bite was kind of just baked tuna on a cracker.

Uni Creamy Tomato Pasta: 4.5/5
(FOR UNI LOVERS) The pasta was good and the sauce was creamy and delicious. I couldn't really taste any uni though, which was a little disappointing because I love uni. I kind of expected the sauce to be blended with it, and the flavor to be a little more pronounced or even present. Or I would've even liked to see my pasta dish topped with a piece or two. Instead it kind of felt like a small, single piece was chopped and mixed in, and then half of it melted. 

Uni Creamy Tomato Pasta with Scallop: 4.5/5
(FOR UNI HATERS) My boyfriend and I reached the same consensus. The pasta was good, the sauce delicious, but no uni flavor in sight. His dish even lacked as many uni pieces as mine. Overall, he enjoyed his food, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service was amazing here. Water cups never reached half empty, or even a quarter empty, before someone quickly refilled it. After we had eaten the last bite off of a dish, it was always promptly whisked away. The food came out quickly and they checked on us enough to make sure we were enjoying our meal. We felt really taken care of here.

PRICING: 3/5
I saw the lunch price specials, and they seem totally reasonable for the food quality and service. For their 5 year anniversary prices at dinner, it was also pretty fair. But for their normal dinner prices, I think it's a bit pricey. If their uni pasta actually tasted like it had uni it in, it would've been reasonable. But it didn't, and it felt like they were charging a premium price for a regular pasta dish.

OVERALL: 4/5
The staff is amazing. The food is great. The prices? A little too steep. Come during lunch or on an Anniversary night. Otherwise, you're definitely splurging on Japanese-Italian fusion that leans a little too close to Italian.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,1,2,4,by1e3mTSfejZVIGwy_oOHw
5918949,2012-01-04,3,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"More than adequate staffing level at present, all chefs/cooks visible in the kitchen speak Japanese, the menu is possibly unique here in Las Vegas (aside from the sister restaurant Kabuki).  The minimalistic ambiance of this small restaurant just works for me. And if you want to photo-document your meal, sit at the ""pasta bar"" counter, the lighting there is adequate for simple food photography needs.

So Down to business.  A group of Yelpers were actually at the plaza where this new restaurant is located at last night (Monday), which is currently their only day off.  So I decided I was going to check them out the next evening after work.  As the chef, possibly the owner, handed us their business cards and a few menu (he was at the restaurant with a few others).

When I arrived at 7:30pm on Tuesday, the place had 4 tables occupied already, and I am pretty sure that everyone there, except yours truly, was a native Japanese.  I considered that a positive indicator for seeking authentic Japanese style rendition of Western cuisine.

The menu is pretty simple, pastas are on the specials board, while appetizers,salads, chef's special dishes are on a 2-sided menu. The dessert menu also offers some Western desserts with a Japanese twist. Menu prices are mostly in the $teens, but can quickly add up to a meal costing $30-40+ per person.

On my inaugural visit, I tried the Miso Carbonara for main course #1 and Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style for main course #2.  

The  Miso Carbonara pasta dish was good, the flavor is obviously different from traditional Italian Carbonara pasta dishes, but the sauce was creamy with a mild flavor.  I personally would prefer the pieces of bacon to be cooked a bit more, but that is a personal preference of mine.  Check out the picture I posted if you are interested in trying out this item. Flavor: 3.5 stars. Presentation: 3.5 stars. Value: 3 stars.

Since I was still hungry, I went and ordered the Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style from the Chef's Special Dishes portion of the menu.  It is a very delicious and juicy tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) that is served with a tomato sauce, an asparagus and a button mushroom cut up as garnish.  The only thing I thought was missing was a starch component to the entree, like rice pilaf or something.  Then again, maybe the roll that is served with the meal is meant to serve that role.  Flavor: 5 stars. Presentation: 3 stars.  Value: 3 stars.

For dessert I had the Soy Milk Panna Cotta ""Okinawa Black Sugar"" Sauce for $5.95, but the Black Sesame Blanc Manger also looks very interesting on the menu.  The Panna Cotta was pretty good, I like the flavor, although the texture seems a bit firmed (like too much gelatin was used) to me. However, the Okinawa Black Sugar Sauce was the key component that makes this dessert.  The dessert is probably prepared by savory chefs, as some basic pastry chef attention to detail was amissed (utilized sprig of mint that had clear signs of pest feeding on the leaf as a very noticeable garnish just seems careless, and something that can easily be prevented). 

Anyway, I like this new addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene, and can see myself paying the occasional visit when I am in the mood.

Location: In the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Won, Soul Oak Korean BBQ.  Very accessible if you are near the Chinatown area.

Parking:  3/5  Could easily gets crowded, but not filled to capacity where you have to look for nearby street parking.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  I like the execution of the interior decor and the lighting (dim in the main dining area, and well lite at the ""pasta bar""counter.

Service:  4.5/5  Pleasant service by a small squad of friendly waitresses.

Value:  3.5/5  Not a cheap meal, but I do think you get what you pay for, plus there is not much competition for this kind of cuisine in Las Vegas at the moment.

Flavor:  4 stars overall, some dishes and items are executed better than others.  But the balance of flavor that is not too overpowering, and compliments the components of the dish is what will make you go back for more.

4 stars!  Bravo and welcome to Las Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!!!

Note:  They do accept AMEX.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,6,3,4,s-WuPWdvOtF1nhVKHyFkYw
5951255,2014-01-01,4,6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA,"Trattoria Nakamura-Ya is nestled in a tiny Chinatown strip mall among superstars such as Raku, Monta Ramen and Japanese Curry Zen.  We were waiting outside for the restaurant to open when the server saw us standing around and unlocked the door. She said we could sit anywhere we liked as she wasn't expecting a lot of business at that particular time of day. At first, we sat a small table for two, since it was just the two of us, but when she returned with our menus, she seemed appalled and had us move to a larger table. ""No, no, no! You don't have to sit at such a small table!"" After we were seated at the larger table, we received the regular menu and the special Happy Hour menu. The menus contained lots of food words we'd never heard of, as we'd pretty much only had sushi. Our server was so friendly and patient answering my many questions. I must have asked about half the menu! In the end, we decided to split an appetizer and entr√©e. 

After we ordered, she brought out dinner rolls and butter. Bread and butter at a Japanese restaurant??! Okay, I know. It's Tokyo-style Italian, but we really weren't expecting bread. Way cool! The bread and butter was actually pretty tasty! After we finished our bread, the Mushroom and Jidori Chicken Salad arrived at the table. It was fresh, crisp and a great combination of flavors. The vinaigrette was BOMB. It was complex, yet balanced. Deeeelicious. The Takana and Chicken Spaghetti arrived soon after and it was sitting in an inch of lemony, garlicky chicken broth. Very good and light. The pickled mustard greens were delicious and mild. Several of the jidori chicken pieces had chunks of blubbery fat attached, which was unappetizing, but overall a wonderful dish as the chicken was intensely flavorful. 

Perfectly matched prices and portions, as the happy hour prices were fair and the portions were not too large, roughly half the size of an American-style Italian restaurant entr√©e. Great spot in Chinatown for attentive service from the charming and smiley Tomoyo, well-paced dishes and delicious food.",UiGjeRQyDE8rxgE-0hisaw,6,6,5,PYm_HxLUASXmABGbL-2Lsw
