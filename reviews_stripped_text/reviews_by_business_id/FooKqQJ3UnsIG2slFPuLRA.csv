If anything, they should have a Grinch That Stole Christmas type broken box with the stars expanding beyond the parimneter because a reuben from this place is seriously one of my favorite meals on the planet!

Yes a ""Viva Las Vagas"" (as the sandwich is called here) with fries and a drink will run you over $15, but the meal is HUGE!  My husband and I are both big eaters and can easily split this meal.  So you are looking at the best sandwich of your life, with fries, for around $7/person.  Some nice additions, if you are feeling super starved, are the matza ball soup and the frozen custard.  They used to have the most amazing carrot cake ever, but I haven't seen it here in a while.

The staff is always super nice and we have never had to wait longer than 15 minutes from the time we get in line to the time the food is ready.

I doubled down at this Treasure Island Hotel hole in the wall and found it to be the only redeeming quality of my Strip experience (Ok, one other. See my review of Bouchon). To be fair, I was in need of a cheap place to stay near the Sands Convention Center, so I got what I paid for. What's also great about this dining venue being in the hotel (or not so great depending on how you view it) is that you could pick up your dinner to go in your pajamas. Great, if you don't want to fuss with room service and want to get in and out. Trust me no one with notice since most guests are wearing similar outfits, as well, outfits. 

Other good menu items: the pastrami or corned beef, which paired with the sweet mustard is sublime. On an I'm-not-in-the-mood-for-meat night, I opted for the grilled cheese- a slightly gooey sandwich crisped just enough to easily dunk into the soup.

This is a branch of the famed Canter's in LA on Fairfax and I was expecting a lot more. For around $15, I got a turkey on wheat, fries, and a soda. MAJOR UNDERWHELM-MENT. While there was a gang of turkey, it was dry, limp, and tasteless. Only when I slathered dijon mustard on it did I feel like my $15 went towards something.

OH WELL. I do realize this is in Vegas, the land expensive meals. I did try another person's pastrami and it was pretty good. Again, I suppose that nasty turkey sandwich killed it for me. 

My tastebuds may have been shot from the late night prior, so I guess I will someday return to the REAL Canter's in LA and hopefully see what the hoo-ha is all about. I will not be returning to this Canter's sadly!

I also love that their matzo ball soup has one giant ball in it. That's the best part.

The second thing I noticed was that they served corned beef sandwiches. I simply had to have one. I got one with fries and a drink for $15 and she ordered the tuna melt with fries.

What this place really needs is more help at the counter. There were only two people out there and the line was long. They were taking orders, ringing up customers, bagging orders and handing out the food. The whole process could have gone a lot smoother if they had just one more person there.

At any rate, we took our food up to our room and dug in. My corned beef sandwich was awesome. It was huge. It came with a nice portion of fries that were nice and crispy and they even tossed in a few pickle slices.

I was full at the end of it all and pretty satisfied. I just didn't like the wait. It took forever to order our food and then another forever to get it.",3yP6ieJBXvee4IpCZP3Jvw,1,1,3,yKCsBYshZSwJg1enmm7Yqw

Now for the folks, who don't like hotdogs because it's processed and blah blah blah, you can quit reading. But for the folks who are big hot dog fans, you'll love their National Hotdog. It's basically just a hot dog with the frank cut down the middle. What I love about this hot dog is what they do to the bun. They lightly butter the bun and set it on the grill for a quick moment to get that nice crispy texture. You get a crunchy pickle and they give you condiments on the side.

The pastrami on rye.  Not overly salty.  Tender.  And more importantly, a genorous heap of sensual pastrami.   Just thinking of it makes me yearn for it.  I positioned it in my hands as to where I wouldn't bite off my fingers and devoured it ever so quietly hoping no one would see me.

When I looked down upon my empty plate, I was left wondering where my pastrami on rye went. Had I lost myself in it entirely and lost all sense of reality that I was left wondering if it was fictional?

I left and the thought of what had happened haunted me the whole night while I was splitting 8's and doubling down on 10's and 11's.

I wanted chopped liver which they didnt have, so settled for a corned beef sandwich instead.  My friend ordered a patty melt.

The food was wonderful, maybe better than I remembered from the original.  It's been so long since I've had real rye bread and the corned beef was lean and sliced paper thin and piled on the sandwich.  My friend was almost in tears, his patty melt was so good.  

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes good deli but doesn't care about the scenery.  I actually prefer that they didn't try to recreate the original Canter's and concentrated on getting the food right.

The fries that came with were quite thin and piled high on the plate. I usually like nice thick steak fries the best, but these thin ones were some of the best I've ever had. You WILL be full if you clean your plate. My wife had the same combo with corned beef that was pretty tasty too.

Resigning myself to the fact that I probably will never go to Canter's in Los Angeles, I elected to hit the Vegas outpost in Treasure Island before I headed out of town. We showed up at about 4 in the afternoon so it was a short line and just a few people in the dining room. The ordering system is simple. You stand in line and order what you want, and then you are given a gigantic playing card to display at your table so the server knows where to take the food. 

Like I said, I've never been to the one in LA but I'm willing to bet that it looks nothing like the outpost in Vegas. It's very futuristic with multiple TV's on the walls so you can watch your favorite sporting events while waiting for your food. Not that it really matters because we got our food literally 5 minutes after we ordered. 

I don't think the prices are all that expensive. A similar sandwich in Los Angeles will cost at most 1-2 dollars less and a similar sandwich in New York will cost close to $20. I elected to get a combo meal which includes a pastrami sandwich, side of fries, and a soda for $17. I wasn't that hungry so I was hoping they weren't as big as the ridiculous sized sandwiches you would get if you were eating at the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage.  Although the sandwiches were bigger than the normal, they were still not THAT big. It was perfect for an average glutton like myself.

Unfortunately I let my friend do the ordering while I sat down at a table, and he got me the pastrami sandwich on white bread rather than the requisite rye. No biggie though because the sandwich was good! The bread was soft and the meat was juicy. The bottle of deli mustard that is on every table really has a great kick to it. The fries were perfect too although I didn't eat many of them due to the size of the sandwich.

Overall, my experience was great. I might have to check out the one in LA because I would definitely go back to the one in Vegas.",ffarmP6gowdXoTxQARKU7A,0,0,4,yveYEcNjxczRLqseApPlLw

Megan and I went to Canter's three times when we were in Vegas. It was just so so good, and it was nice because it was right in our hotel, Treasure Island. If we just wanted a quick bite before heading to the pool or what not, and cheap compared to other food options!

First night I arrived, I had the chicken tender basket. My flight arrived in a couple hours late, and I was famished! Megan and I probably could have shared one, though.  You get a ton of fries, and five chicken strips, served with whatever sauce you want. Everything is fresh and piping hot.  The second time was before we went to the pool. I got a cheeseburger and fries. Again, fries were delicious and the burger was good-- nothing to write home about.

If you go to Canter's, you need get only one thing. The pastrami sandwich. YUM. I still have dreams about this sandwich.  The pastrami is packed about 3 inches high on the sandwich, it's perfectly cooked a medium rare, seasoned like no other pastrami I've had before.  It's all on a tangy rye bread.  I got it with chicken noodle soup-- another awesome surprise. The soup has large cuts of real chicken, and uses long angel hair pasta noodles, which i thought was a very cool idea.  There are chunks of fresh vegetables, and was one of the best chicken noodle soups I've had.

The deli's ambiance was ok (minus the obese lady in front of me with huge breastesses staring at my custard). It looked clean and minimal with a touch of diner-esque.

The sandwich is 15.00.  The nice thing was we would split it, and it was just enough to fill our stomachs so we could tequila it up!

Well, the woman at the counter must have seen the longing in our eyes, the heartbreak when she said there were no more chocolate chip, the excitement when she said they still had black and white, the crushing disappointment when she was wrong--they didn't have anymore black and white and the last glimmer of hope in our eyes when she said they had pecan cookies left-----She gave us two blondies for free in addition to our 2 cookies. 2 cookies, 2 blondies for $4.32. 

Well...Our major craving was for cookies and the Pecan Cookies let us down. They were dry. Not too much flavor. You've gotta know they are practically tasteless when a raisin hater is excited to discover raisins in her cookies. The blondies on the other hand were chewy (a plus) and had much more flavor.

In a magazine in the hotel room, I saw a photo of their corned beef sandwich and had to have it.  So we hiked over to Treasure Island, and it was well worth the trip.

You can get a few of the sandwiches in a special with fries and a soda, or straight up for about $10.  They come with a crisp (but not tangy enough) pickle and a little cup of cole slaw (too sweet and bland).  I got the regular corned beef sandwich, and it was awesome.  Perfect, really.  They have three different types of mustard on the table--yellow, sweet/hot, and deli.  I got an order of onion rings also, and they were great too:  A-.  Big, thick-cut rings in a crispy, flaky batter.  I wanted to try the ""famous"" bean and barley soup, but that would have been pushing my luck.  I snagged a few fries from my friend, and those get a solid B+.

My friends all liked their various sandwiches too.  I tried to get a chocolate custard afterwards, but they were out (sad face).  I would have had a hot fudge sundae, but they were out of nuts too.  I can't eat just plain vanilla yogurt!  Bummer.

First, (if one is honoring the NY/Jewish deli theme) they dumped Snapple for Sobe (even though Snapple is still on the board). The matzo ball soup was literally chicken noodle soup with some mediocre matzo balls. Seriously - noodles, veggies, and chunks of chicken. Noodles?!? That's not mama's matzo ball soup! The ""hot"" corned beef on rye was only mildly warm at best and for what should have been in house prepped, wasn't even up to Boar's Head grade at my local grocer.

Way too much corned beef sandwiched between 2 thin slices of bread...might as well be a meat entree.  The meat was so thick that I could not bite into it without the the slices slipping and falling apart to land on the plate instead of my mouth.  The swiss cheese was rubbery in texture, lacked any cheese flavour -- in fact, it was rather artificial-tasting.  The sandwich came with only cheese and loads of meat.  Condiments were self-serve at the table.  

The saddest part for me was the meat itself -- pastrami and corned beef are supposedly Canter's signature items.   The corned beef was far from delicious;  I actually had to force myself to finish even half of the sandwich, not because I was oversatiated, but because the aroma of the meat was starting to make me feel ill.  Came so close to ditching it at the restaurant when conscience nagged me to pack it to go for a snack later.  Really hate wasting food.  

Later that night, as I was about to finish the rest of the food at the hotel, I could not help but recall the experience of not enjoying the sandwich even while it was freshly made.  It was destined for the trash at that point.

Far too expensive for a sandwich at $16 when I have had superb ones in the range of $13-16.   A major flop in my books.",TKL0DZhsMQ5gZ_CYct5hAA,1,1,2,LBVOtZpYmBZ0NxzixjLktg

The sandwich was huge. It was also expensive (almost $17).
I noticed that most gourmet deli places (Canters, Langers...etc) bump up their meat prices like crazy.

The food is fine, I had a corned beef sandwich with coleslaw and was good and filling like always. Shared some fries with my cousin and friend and I like that they have thin fries. I like that they have this honey horshradish mustard I like to spackle on. 

BUT I am disappointed a bit thinking of the OG Canter's back home. There it's an old deli diner with an extensive menu, open late and also has a bakery. This is just a quick, modern sandwich counter. It's different I know and I shouldn't compare, but it's hard with the fond memories I have. Also, as much as Canter's is famous for sandwiches....back home I rarely actually order one as my go-to spot is Langers and I actually liked eating other things at Canters such as their baked chicken, blitzes, meatloaf, chopped liver,potato pancakes etc. 

Still, I suppose Canter's LV is the best reasonable food spot in the TI.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,4,402DbzWnuDxLarBdJQUJYg

5139148,2012-08-22,0,FooKqQJ3UnsIG2slFPuLRA,"Since there is a lack of deli's of this type back home, i've been eager to check this place out.  More importantly, I wanted to try a knish as I have never had one before. So my ""research"" left me with three choices: Carnegie, ZoozaCrackers, or Canter's.  Carnegie seemed too ginormous for me as I wanted to do a sampling of things, & Zooza's, while interesting, i've never heard of before. So I chose Canter's.

I ordered a half pastrami on rye & tossed salad ($11.50), my potato knish ($6.50), & a soda ($3.50).  Total bill came out to $23.24 w/tax.  EXPENSIVE.

I like that it is very casual here.  Place your order & if you eat in they'll give you a numbered card where you mosey on to any open table & wait for them to bring your order.  My order took a little more than five minutes since it was not very busy. 

The food was delicious & filling.  The potato knish was very good.  The outside pastry was flaky & the potato filling was seasoned perfectly for me.  Some gravy on the side would have pushed it over the top.  Too bad I couldn't finish it all.  I should have gotten the maztzo ball soup instead of salad but that would've been carb overload.

This place is awesome!  If you want a great deli sandwich in Vegas, come here.  Its expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for!

I always order the Canters Delight.  Its like a club sandwich minus all the vegetables.  Its a triple decker sandwich stacked with ham, turkey, pastrami, corned beef and cheese.  It is easily in my top 5 favorite sandwiches in the world.  The thing is gigantic so you better come hungry.  You have to kind of contemplate how to navigate this bad boy for a minute or so.  I always grab my knife and load it up with mustard, then spread a little on the corner of the sandwich and then dig in.  Every single bite is amazing.  The rye bread is soft, delicious and has a good crust, the meats are plentiful, juicy and piled high, the cheese is tasty.  Its pretty much damn near a perfect sandwich.   My wife always orders the BLT on rye and that always comes out fantastic too.  They must use 10-12 slices of bacon on this monster.  We always come hungry and leave stuffed to the brim with smiles on our faces.  Its amazing what a great sandwich can do for the soul ;-).",6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,4,4,5,dL4AZmlrq-2KOE0JcbZApw

On this last trip, I was starving and settled for a sandwich. The thinly sliced corned beef was severely dry and bland. It seemed like the meat had been sitting out, with all the natural juices and moisture being sucked out. The saving grace was the packets of mustard which provided some much needed flavor.

The included cole slaw was bad. It just had a weird, off-putting flavor. I took a little bite and thew it out. At least the pickle was alright, nice and crisp.

This isn't because Canter's is stellar, but because the other two are pretty bad.

In several meals, the standout was a warm pastrami sandwich.  The meat was warm, reasonably juicy and flavorful; the rye bread was thick cut, dense, with a chewy crust.  Other meals weren't as good.  Chopped liver was fair, with not a whole lot of flavor.  The same was true of cheese blintzes.

Yes yes...I know, you hardcore deli people, that you're supposed to get it on rye, but I'm just not that kind of gal. Anyways... 

One Las Vegas trip with the parents, I was waiting for them to come back to room from gambling for dinner. They never showed up so eventually I made my way downstairs searching for a restaurant and found myself in front of Canter's. Whenever I am famish, I can't settle for something new. I have to get something I know I like. Since I already have been to the one in Los Angeles, I was ecstatic they had one at my hotel. Then I noticed the menu was a lot smaller than the original location. I have only had the French dip. OH NO!!! After 10 minutes of reading the menu (more like staring at the menu), I decided to take a chance and eat something new in my state of hunger. 

This is how my relationship with the Canter's corned beef sandwich began. When I got my order, I couldn't believe how good it was. My favorite part was the coleslaw in the sandwich-so sweet, so delicious. A few minutes later, I found myself finished. I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing by myself. IT WAS HUGE!!! 

I eventually came back to this Canter's and found myself ordering another one. Supposedly food taste better when you're starving, but this sandwich is just as good as when you're just moderately hungry. 

I would of gave it 5 stars, but I'll save it until they add more items from the the original location to the menu. I love the bakery in the one in Los Angeles. I can't get enough of their chocolate cheesecake. 

As for now, I would recommend Canter's to anyone looking for a quick place to get a sandwich. You order your food at the cashier, pay for it and then wait at your table. It will not disappoint. 

Random side note: Don't forget to ask for a side of Thousand Island Dressing. It totally adds to a corned beef sandwich. Also, the Lox and Bagel is good too. HUGE SERVING!!! Also, yummy cream cheese.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,4,nSEBusBKlBCawVos9FmIaQ
