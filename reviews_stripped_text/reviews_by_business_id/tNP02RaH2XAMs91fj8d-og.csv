89029,2014-01-13,1,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"We were lured to experience dining at the Downtown Grand because of the impressive and generous locals discount being offered for the month of January.  Last night we were browsing our restaurant options and we came across The Commissary.  The coffee/gelato barista/attendant was very welcoming and friendly.  We skipped the bar because we don't drink.  We were very impressed by the look and layout of the tortas area, the burger area, and the rotisserie chicken area.  We were admiring the cleanliness and merchandising of the space, but somewhat confused about how/where to order.  In 5 minutes of checking the space out at about 8:30pm on a Saturday, not one person greeted us to explain how/where to order.  We ended up giving up and electing to go eat at the Chinese restaurant in the east building.  As we were making our exit, one of the guys in my party overheard a line cook in the burger area finally motioning us over and telling us we had to order in the burger area.  He shook his head disapprovingly and called the youngest member of our party ""Stupid"" under his breath.  The guy in my party who overheard the comment went over and told the line cook to watch himself and to not insult guests like that.  Personally I would've just reported the incident to the manager so the guy learns a lesson, but I'm just telling it like it happened.

Better design and way finding signs would have made things much more self-evident to anyone who didn't work there and know the flow.  Just sayin'.

Tonight, we returned to The Commissary to try the tortas and chicken and burgers (finally realizing that all three counters are actually one dining experience with one ordering point-of-sale station in the burger area).

The cashier in the burger area took our order and then the rest of my party went to sit down while I remained up there to pay.  The cashier coughed in her hand at least three times and my OCD mind immediately started taking mental notes of everywhere and everything she touched with the cough hand afterwards.  There was a hand sink conveniently located immediately behind her which did not get used once during our entire visit, despite about 20 more coughs into that same right hand over the next 30 minutes of my dining experience.  Just some of the many things that were touched by that G-d forsaken right hand off the top of my head - my local ID, my players card, my plates, the point of sale register, every drinking cup handed to my party, the entire counter area (she was extremely tactile), very part of the countertop menu that she pointed out to us -- you get the idea.  I tried to give myself piece of mind by reminding myself how resilient our bodies are to bacteria and germs and how it's almost like target practice for our antibodies so maybe this whole experience could actually be a good thing.

To make matters worse, she experienced a POS error and needed me to restate my entire order which I could not do because everyone in my party had ordered their own items prior to going to sit down.

While waiting to pay as my order was re entered into the system, I noticed that the line cook who got reprimanded by my buddy last night recognized us and was staring at my buddy with a concerned look on his face (as he should).  I just hope he recognizes that he was called out privately for inappropriate behavior and should knock it off and represent his employer better.

We were disappointed to learn that they don't serve the delicious sweet potato fries that are pictured prominently in their digital and wall signage.  Instead they are sweet potato tots.  If I wanted tots, I could have just eaten at my mother's house.

The chicken torta was delicious.  The bread was soft and very flavorful due to the avocado and black beans that complimented the crispy chicken.  The jalapeños were a surprise, but not overly powerful, even though obviously from a can.  Highly recommended.

The double cheeseburger was also very good and everyone enjoyed it (our party of 4 shared everything).

The brisket was very good but the portion sIze for the half portion was not worth the $10 cost.  Those of us that tried the rotisserie chicken said it was very good.

The roasted potatoes were AMAZING!  They surprised us with some sort of mango or pineapple (or both) pieces mixed into the roasted potatoes.

The cilantro rice and Mexican rice were both okay.  The cole slaw was not good.  Don't get the cole slaw.  The fries and sweet potato tots were forgettable.  We wished that we had instead not ordered the fries and saved room for gelato, but live and learn.

Overall, I wish the staff working the hot counters at The Commissary were as refined as the beautiful design of the place and as professional and courteous as the staff at the gelato/coffee counter and the Chinese restaurant.  That would have earned them another star.

Zero sanitary concerns would have earned them even another star.  Could've been a 4-star review but I have to leave it at 2 stars.",2IWP7DubDnm6MXrSelJxdA,5,1,2,IOodnZSZYVdsIHqvrmkrWA

The half-and-half is $12, which is ridiculously overpriced for the portion size. My sandwich was teeny (about 4 x 4 x 1 inches (who says food reviews can't have math?)), and the soup was about a full 8-oz cup. I was still hungry at the end of my meal. For $12, I really don't want to be hungry after I polish off my food. 

The service was pretty good, and the food itself was decent tasting, comparable to Panera Bread and other sandwich chains.

Not sure what the addictive little sprinkles were, but they were good. We also had a Chicken Milanese Torta.

644079,2014-09-04,0,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"Overall I was underwhelmed by this experience. My friend has the chicken caesar salad which as he described was ""anemic"" in that there was a small sprinkling of chicken for $12. I was drawn in by the 99 cent tacos. You can choose flour or corn. The sign said barbacoa, chicken or bean & cheese. I got two barbacoa and two chicken. It was not barbacoa but it was ground beef. Seasoned ground beef. This is not their barbocoa as another friend got a barbocoa burrito which did not contain ground beef. Strike three was that there was price differences between what is listed on the electronic menu and the written menu. My friend ordered sweet potato tots listed on the electronic menu $4, they attempted to charge her $5. She pointed out the issue and they said that it was listed as $5 on the paper menu. Ultimately they gave her the $1, but just be careful about this. There was at least one other item that had a difference between the price listed on the electronic menu v. paper. 

The positives were fresh brewed ice tea ($1.99), habanero salsa was good and no extra charge for getting it (which there should never be  but  alot of places seem to charge for sides of dressing etc.).",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,0,2,R9XdvgYObXDo99qTmZ9lbg

The food is average at best and over priced at regular prices. I don't know who this famous Sandoval guy is but he must not think very highly of himself for serving store bought chips. Even low end Mexican restaurants have fresh chips. The salsa, both medium and hot were boring.. ""Celebrity chef"" Sandoval needs to take notes from the salsa offering at the taco bar in Mariana's grocery store park lot.
The rotisserie chicken has good flavor but was dried out. The rice was decent. Black beans have no flavor. Very bland mashed up  black beans. I mixed the salsa in to add some flavor but the salsa needed help itself.
The crispy chicken Milanese torta was average. Light corn breading on a thin piece of chicken breast. 

Service:
Counter service. You order get a receipt bit how do you know when your food is ready. I went and sat down. They took my name but never called my name. I sat and sat and sat....

Definitely not for dinner.  When you walk in you see a bar in front of you... a deli-like counter to the right... and in the far left dark corner maybe the kitchen?  Very confusing.  A large space with scattered tables and chairs.  You order from the right deli counter... then sit and wait at a table for your food to be delivered from the dark kitchen area.  The food?

This is a great concept for quick & easy foodservice and beverage. Not necessarily plush....but definitely comfortable, with great hospitality.

Great coffee shop (Jenny is awesome!) with Lavazza....'nuff said.The latin chicken for lunch was incredible moist and with just the ""right"" amount of spices. Perfect. 

And, the bar at The Commissary (bartender Adriana...another terrific asset to The Commissary) was exactly what is needed after a long day out and exploring LV. Manager Kris Sainsbury should be complimented for his attention to guests throughout my 3 day stay. Overall, a very well run operation, with great food & beverage options!

This hotel needs to promote The Commissary as I would never had known it was here other than I just ""happened"" to stay here. Downtown Las Vegas is on the rebound and I would get here quickly as I have no doubt that the crowds will be here soon.

Now...if only they can figure out how to deal with the wind outside on the street so that we could have enjoyed the outside tables......

Area - clean and next to the Mob Museum.

Food - similar to fusion style.  I ordered the chicken Milanese torta.  Very tasty!  I enjoyed this very much.  It was a fairly good portion, however I thought the price was a bit steep.  $10.00 for my order, it came with a small side of chips but no drink.

Restaurant - airy, clean, cafeteria style setting.  Many of the people working in the surrounding areas were having lunch there so this place would be good for a business luncheon.

Came here for breakfast and dinner (2 nights) while staying at the Grand. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was pretty good.

Breakfast:
I got the crepe with chocolate and strawberry, which was just chocolate syrup and strawberry jelly (or jam). It was ok. I've definitely had better crepes. Hearty ones with real fruit and nutella, but this was just syrup. And the crepe itself wasn't great.

Also had the breakfast burrito. They were out of sausage, so we got ham, egg and cheese. It was good. Didn't blow my mind... I've had better, but not bad.

Dinner:
One night, I got the tacos. I chose 1 chicken and 2 latin smoked brisket. Really good!. The latin smoked brisket was especially yum. I got this with the Mexican rice (you get 2 sides with the taco plate). I didn't care for it. My husband got the bacon burger, which I tried, and it was good. He liked it too.

For dinner on our second night I got a turkey burger, which I enjoyed. Also got the onion rings, which I wasn't crazy about. Too big and the onion just fell right out when you'd take a bite.

The place itself is cool. I love the set-up and decor. I do agree with other reviewers that it was a bit confusing as to where to order. I would definitely come again, to try other things on the menu. And if anything, I know the latin smoked brisket tacos will satisfy me.",xPqMjZrlX8BKRAyREd5WuA,0,0,3,y716Hh5dzuHd40n3n3oPFg

The only difference between the commissary and a regular food court is that you  order from one location. There is an odd mixture of  Mexican food and burgers /bar food. You order at the bar and are given a pager. You find a seat wait a while a then go to the station that prepares the type of food you  ordered and pick it up.


The Good:
Atmosphere is modern and very clean  with plenty of seating. The bar area is cozy and has a good selection beers on tap. The variety is interesting if you are trying to please a group of people with varied. 

The Bad:
Co worker and I went for lunch, spent several minutes wandering around trying to find out how to place an order. There is an ambiguous order here sign above the bar, with no further details. The only two menus are pasted to the bar counter, one was at the register and the other was under one of  bar patron's lunch.  After placing your order  you are left to figure out which station has your food. The burgers station is pretty easy, but  the other two stations look to be split between hot and cold entrees,but there was no definitive signage to that effect.

Food was awful.  I ordered tortilla soup and a bacon cheeseburger. Both items were presented well and looked delicious. Tortilla soup was very runny and tasted like strained corn chips and velveta. There were also lumps of something that I assume was chicken, but I could be wrong. Bacon cheeseburger was the SALTIEST thing I have ever eaten in my life! I removed the bacon hoping to cut the salty taste only to realize that it was not the bacon. I wasn't able to finish half the burger due to the crazy amount of salt. I am still tasting salt. 

Co-worker had the same burger and the nacho fries. His burger was just as salty as mine. The nacho fries were blah, cheese and salt and fries. 

We have to go back to try the ""latin"" food (just to make sure this isn't a case of ordering hamburger at a sushi restaurant.), But i am not looking forward to it.

At first, I got a frappe coffee drink, a ""frigid mocha latte"".  For $6.00 for a 16 ounce blended coffee drink, it was a overpriced, but very tasty. 

At another counter, I got a double burger.  The only choice for cheese was cheddar, but the burger was actually a relative bargain, at $8.25.  The two greasy patties with nicely melted cheese, with tomato, lettuce and onion, turned out to be a good choice. 

This was tough for me to judge as it's more like 3.5 stars, but for Yelp ratings I pushed it up to 4 stars due to the inviting eclectic decor, and I really like that it's off the beaten path, compared to so much of downtown.   As it's just across the street from the Mob Museum, it's also a good choice before/after a trip to that museum.",gyTYQo6Cn4BYB4z-McRDaA,1,0,4,9b937qCbq1BiHwa805s1Yg

Went to the bar to order and were told we needed to be ID'd bc we were at the bar, even though we had no plans on drinking and were just there to order. It was 2pm. Huh? Kinda weird. 

But what the hell, since we were at the bar anyway and I saw Ayinger Bräu Weisse on the menu (spelled incorrectly), I ordered a brew. What came out was Anchor Steam Christmas Ale. Not. Even. Close. I get that they both start with 'A', but a bartender should know the menu. Strike 1. We order our food and move to a table. The table we sit at is so off kilter that one elbow on it made my beer spill out and all over my phone. Strike 2. 

The buzzer goes off and we go pick up our food. My gf's salad looked decent, but had a spicy dressing on it that wasn't listed on the menu. Like a good boyfriend, I didn't trust her tastebuds and tried it myself. It 100% had a kick. She went to return it and didn't get a full tude, but def a nice 'wtf' stare from the chef. The salad was remade and brought out with a new dressing only it lacked the avocado that we paid extra for and the chicken was way undercooked. Strike 3. 

For my meal, a half Cubano and soup combo, the soup looked like something you would be served in an airplane... flying coach. Progresso in a square plastic bowl. Eek. Saving grace? The Cubano was good! Would a full one be worth $12? NO. It's not a large 'wich at all. $12 can get you a yard of meats at Capriotti's. Instead, I recieved canned soup and half a sammie for that same amount. Weak. Strike 4. 

I want to 2-star it bc it wasn't the worst place out there and it's certainly appealing to the eyes, but I know deep down that in no way will I be back. 'Methinks not' is spot on.",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,20,3,1,sYGy1QPCK_XHlbgaoBhQYA

I have been to the Commissary roughly 10 times since they first opened. I would say that is a decent amount of visits to make my 2 star opinion valid. These visits were not back to back, they were spaced out over a few months so the staff that I encountered on each visit more than likely were not the exact same people from my previous visits. 
My last visit was much like my other visits and left me feeling like I will never return. The reason for my return previously was at the request of various coworkers.

Once we went to the counter, the staff was very friendly and even custom made my order because I can't stand anything spicy, and literally everything on their menu to do with meat, was spicy. We noticed they didn't have a few of the items that were shown in the ad we saw which was only a week before-hand. Everything was tasting good but the sweet potato tots were so gross they tasted like they were out of a frozen bag that had freezer burn. 

For desert we decided to try a milkshake thinking they would have the pretzel one we saw in the ad. Sure enough, they didn't. Even the lady that worked there said it was false advertising. I had my heart set on that damn milkshake. She seemed like she didn't really know the menu because I asked if she can make something similar and wasn't too sure. If you like weird tasting gelato, this is the place to go. Beer flavored. Pistachio (which some people think would be normal, me not so much), Spicy chocolate..etc.

On my first visit, I had the Caesar salad.  I enjoyed it, but the dressing was surprisingly spicy.  This may not go over well with your typical Caesar consumer.  On my second visit I had the brisket burrito.  I would say this was far better than Chipotle.  

There are a few things that keep The Commissary from receiving five stars.  The first thing is service.  I found the people taking my order on both occasions didn't seem exceptionally knowledgeable and on the second visit my order was incorrect.  I attribute this to the fact the restaurant is relatively new.

I also was a little unsure about the atmosphere.  I found the music to be a little on the loud side on my first visit, making it hard to converse with my dinner companion.  On my second visit, I contemplated getting coffee from the adjacent coffee bar and popping out the iPad to get a little work done.  I discovered that The Commissary does not offer free WiFi, which kept me from ordering coffee.  In keeping with coffee bar atmosphere, I would think free WiFi would be a must.

I ordered the sandwich with a side of dipping sauce, which I believe was supposed to be like an enchilada sauce, but it was bland and tasted more like tomato paste. Also, the sauce cost an extra $2. 

The two star is because I didn't get a flavorful or fulfilling meal, and I paid $15.31. The prices are a bit steep, but again, the burritos are worth it. Guess I'll stick with that next time:)",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,3,1,2,0CfOCj2_n1sM1sMymp8nlg

We walked up to the chicken station and they said we had to order from the next station. There was also a salad station that was closed.
We ordered our food and while I was ordering I was watching on of the chef's plating another customers order.
Everything was fine until he reached his BARE hand into the tortilla chips and put them on the plate.
He then walked the plates to the counter and waited for the customer to pick up their order.
I stood up there with my iphone in hand waiting for my order to get plated. I realized we ordered chips and salsa.
The chef started putting our order together and sure enough he put his BARE hand back into the bowl of tortilla  chips and put them on my plate and walked up to the window.
When he handed me my 2 plates I asked him if he expected me to eat those chips that he used his BARE hand to put on my plate.
He looked confused and I told him I captured what he did on my phone.
He took the one plate and dumped the whole order in the trash and said he would remake my order.

I took my wife's plate to her * she was smart and didn't order any chips ) and we waited and waited for my meal.
I asked to speak to the manager and he said the chef in the white coveralls was in charge.
Needless to say I told them I didn't want my order anymore and I didn't care if the refunded me.
My wife ordered the brisket and it came out looking like pulled pork. It had a good flavor and the sweet potato fries we tasty.

4357284,2014-02-15,0,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"This is a split review for the Torta-Mexican Counter and the Bar.

First off, the concept of this place is cool with very hip and comtempo decor. It is basically a big ""cafeteria"" with food booths, a bar, and a coffee/ice cream place. I ate at the Torta place and had the half and half combo of the tortilla soup and the chicken milanese combo. I honestly thought $12 was a bit pricey for a soup and sandwich combo (that does no include your drink) at a place that is cafeteria style-food and service. The torta was actually pretty tasty and the tortilla soup had nice presentation with some spice, but the chicken in the soup tasted a little off and one piece had a bone in it, so I could not finish eating it as I was turned off it. That was my only experience with the food portion. The place looked pretty deserted when I got there, but I am attributing that to it being a weekday in DTwn Vegas and the hotel it is attached to, the Downtown Grand, having just opened in November. However, the staff that took the order didn't really seem to know what was going on and it was a bit weird trying to figure the place out. Since nobody was there, they just kinda said ""hey, your food's ready"" even though they had given me a pager that was supposed to light up when the food was ready for pick up. The soda fountain is also self-serve, so honestly, I was confused as to the was the ""tip"" line on my receipt was for. I don't tip when I go into a Taco Bell or McD's and that's pretty much the level of service you're getting here. So, two stars for this portion of the experience. Hopefully, they can sort out the kinks and find what works and what doesn't because this IS a cool concept.

Now on to the Bar. Totally different experience here. From the moment I sat down, Jesus greeted me and you could just tell he had a good energy. He was engaging and funny and won me over when he let me sample a beer to see if I would like it. The other awesome guy of the evening was Michael, the Manager. He really did an excellent job of ""putting the customer first"" and really went out of his way to make my experience here awesome! They had an amazing beer selection and the beer flights they offered were well selected and priced. There was a flight called the Beer Belly that had some quality beers on it (5) for only $13. I was originally told they were not serving it because they didn't have the glassware yet, but Michael did me a solid and made it happen. I was in beer HEAVEN! They also have a great selection of Dia de Los Muertos beers from Mexico. I had the Hefe and it was great! The bottles are also worth collecting! Michael said they will also be having specialty tequila flights soon, which would just add to the fantastic cocktail and beer selections they already have. They made my night even better by letting me use the 20% off coupon I got in my welcome packet on my beer flight. So all in all a fun experience and exceptional customer service at the Bar. 5-stars across the board!

I would usually split the diff on the stars, but I had such a good time at the Bar, it compensated for the bad food experience. I definitely need to check the Coffee/Ice Cream place out next time I am in town as it looked delish! But, either way, I will def be back to the Bar!",efMDfLm2k7LY6l5sg4t8fQ,2,0,4,nfvkMYVwPKvfC4YwdXsZZg

I started off with the chips and salsa/guacamole appetizer for $4.00.  This is a GREAT deal.  It came in a big bowl, filled with tortilla chips and two ramekins filled with salsa and guac.  The guac was chunky and filled with chopped tomatoes and onions.  The salsa was AH-MAZE-ING!  It was super smokey, like they've added chipotle or ancho chili peppers. So awesome.  Little spicy but really made a wonderful difference!  For the price along, super worth it!

For my meal, I got the Caesar salad for $7 and added chilled chicken breast for an additional $4.  The Caesar salad along was romaine lettuce, parmesan cheese, torn homemade croutons and classic dressing.  The chicken breast was seasoned with kosher salt and pepper, perfectly seasoned, juicy and fresh!  The salad was a little salty.  Almost really fishy.  You could tell the dressing was homemade though.  The anchovy taste was super prominent, almost dominant at times.  The croutons were amazing though!  torn bread slices, toasted to resemble croutons.  It was crunchy, yet buttery and creamy!  Hard to explain but so good.  The parmesan cheese was shaved on to the salad.  One of the biggest fans of shaved cheese on salads, as opposed to shredded.  At the end of the day, I still felt the salad was delicious.  

My first experience was very good, overall.  Although it seems like a I got a lot of stuff, keep in mind that it's still 50% off on dining for the rest of January 2014.  Great promotion and because of my experience, I'm definitely going back soon!  Thanks so much for a wonderful lunch, guys!  If you downtown, you're in luck!  Check out this new joint :)",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,4,3,5,d9nf3zjbbcctG20c907-BQ

I got the breakfast sandwich... How can u mess that up????
Well they did.. 
If u want to pay 6 dollars for a bagel sandwich that tastes like crap... Come to the commissary.
Rather have gone to mcdonalds or bk..... Sorry commissary... U FAIL!!!!!",Y2BVDgCGgGRMBh5IsIxOWg,2,2,2,WsyUzbmLeJ5zIRnI2HEXWA

I had a chicken burrito and it was good, but nothing to write home about. Maybe that's because I'm from San Diego so I'm exposed to the best Mexican food in the country. Take that for what it's worth. It tasted fresh and I enjoyed my meal but again it's not really anything I'm going to remember too much of. 

The gal who worked the front counter was really nice. I forget her name. Started with an M I think. But she could start a conversation with a dried up sponge and make it feel welcomed. Very impressive.",2J1jggwYYub3e00hUlH4WA,0,0,3,TvOJDyKBz6HubzGDBNT4mA

My wife and I thought the food was good the prices were more than fair and the ambience was perfect for what we were looking for. The manager came by and chatted which was nice. We will definitely come back.,nxl_7S95fL7dk-Z6q3GLkw,0,0,5,BJ7M5WE1mBo6hkbGu4zDDA
5591928,2014-01-06,1,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"My husband and I went for lunch this week.  The atmosphere is cute and very bright, the food is meh.

Hubs ordered the bacon burger with no bun and I ordered the bacon-wrapped hotdog.  We both ordered sweet potato fries and iced tea.  Aside from the price (over 30 bucks for lunch), the food was much like we would expect from any of the cookie-cutter casino cafes around town.  

Our food looked nothing like the pictures (and I don't just mean that is wasn't styled) and the sweet potato fries were actually tots.

We'll maybe give them a couple of months to settle in and try again, but I can't recommend then to anyone.  Stick to Smashburger for burgers.",5u4vq7QR4U_90u1NTOFjkQ,1,0,2,Sq4pdV8p095vnnVnMk7Hwg
5655903,2016-07-15,0,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"My husband and I saw the Mob museum, and we were starving afterwards (despite the gory content, LOL). We weren't in the mood to wander around Fremont Street again, so we stopped at The Commissary.

The décor is really cool - comfy chairs, interesting appearance. I ordered a tuna melt with fries, and my husband ordered a salad with avocado and chicken. The portions were large, and my food was great. My husband wasn't crazy about his food, but he said it was fine. 

The prices were actually really good considering the location- I can't remember how much we paid, but it wasn't expensive.

I was surprised that I would like this place so much, I didn't have high hopes... but I'd definitely come back again! Definitely recommend The Commissary for a quick bite.",nzm6MM_2mc2TN3EyiceqvQ,0,0,4,DCIoCoyJEJE5cXWUaCmSNg
5658120,2014-06-28,1,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"The commissary is a trendy Latin-fusion kitchen off of 3rd street in downtown Vegas. Walking in, a coffee bar is off to the right, a bar (fully stocked) is straight in the back, and the kitchen area is off to the left.

Upon reaching the kitchen area, the electronic (television) menus were able to be read for about 30 seconds before they turned off and you had to turn around and look at the second tv to keep perusing the menu (read: annoying). 

I ordered the fish torta. It sounded good: crispy fish, tartar sauce with poblano chiles in it, and cabbage. Approximately $12. I asked if the sandwich was spicy. The cashier didn't know, so the managing chef came out and talked to me about it which was a nice touch. The wait for the food wasn't long - maybe 5-7 minutes.

Upon receiving my food I received a sandwich-looking Torta with chips. It was a large sandwich, cut in half. Upon taking a bite I wasn't very pleased with the taste or texture. It was as bland as you could possibly get (and with fish, it can get pretty bland), and definitely was not worth my $12. Seriously, this place has potential, but they would do well to focus more on the quality and taste of their food.",ShPNNs-sbMvrjTT0BuPvcA,1,1,3,G--nZ16IrTm_F9NFnA0wbA
5688686,2013-12-21,1,tNP02RaH2XAMs91fj8d-og,"I'm rating this place because I see the promise but this place really has some kinks to work out. First off, love the bar. Plenty of beers on tap, decent happy hour for drinks, and there's plenty of seating in a relaxed but chic type of presentation. Love that part.

Hated the part that as I'm going to the different stations I'm told I'll have to order from the bar. That's fine because it's slow but if the bar were to get packed and you only have two bartenders, doing things like...tending bar. People with food orders are going to start getting backed up. Weird concept if you expect it to be busy.

I order the cubano, my friend orders a burrito, and the jerk off that wanted us to come in here to try the food just orders a coffee (wtf!). Anyway, I had a bite of the burrito with rotisserie chicken and the meat is actually pretty good. That coupled with the rice is actually pretty damn good. I'll be back for this.

The dry cubano on the other hand, I feel as though it's a little overpriced for $12 that came with no fries, maybe they forgot it, maybe it just doesn't come with it, I don't know. But $12 for basically just a sandwich and it's not sit down service? That's not crazy expensive but damn give me some fries, chips, f*ck I'll even take a deli pickle!

All in all a nice change of pace if you're gambling at Downtown Grand or you're leaving Gold Spike and want something quick instead of pizza. But it needs to work on some things.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,2,1,3,XYwtNkxYXe47gcR7RdIrzQ

We had the tortilla soup and burrito bowl, which were both exceptional.  In addition, Ancho rubbed chicken wings were fantastic.

FAIL
The sandwich has avocado & tomatoes but no flavor.
BUT, loved the caliente salsa with the chips. I asked for their hottest salsa & it is yummy. So are the chips! 
Disclosure: I used a $5 off deal.
I should have mirrored my friend who got rotisserie chicken & raved about it!
We had happy hour drinks too and I'd give both of mine a thumbs up- the mojito was tasty and the margarita was even better! 
I don't know where to start with the crazy multi food counters/confusing ordering process but sometimes different is not better.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,0,3,LYwVKUG_RU75EjqMuRXwMA

Shared a couple of dishes: Latin brisket, Cobb salad, and the crispy chicken torta. All three were delicious. The salad was just your normal cobb but was very good and a large portion. Brisket tasted great. Had the charred black beans and mexican rice as sides and everything was seasoned perfectly. By far the best was the chicken torta. Absolutely delicious. Prices were very reasonable.  Will definitely return.",94CRS2HLCOZAYHIMfaH5xQ,0,0,4,LcU6Ty5UdUoyDJB4Mh20QA
