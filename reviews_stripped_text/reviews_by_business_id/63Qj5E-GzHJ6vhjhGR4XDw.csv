I ordered the Garlic Knot Meatball sliders, and the cheese added to the luke-warm meatball slices was almost frozen it was so cold, making for a very unappetizing meal - which is too bad because they had such great potential.  My wife had wings that were actually quite tasty and very, very meaty.  The tiny cocktails for $12 were fine, except they took about 10 minutes to arrive each time.  Food took almost 20 minutes, and the atmosphere was a little uncomfortable because they don't seem to have a staff to bus tables.  A corner booth was left covered in food and garbage for over 30 minutes before presumably a manager came over and took care of it himself.

There was no hostess to be found and people were just seating themselves. We had to flag down someone to get a hostess to seat us. I should also say that this place was pretty empty. Which, in all fairness, should've been a sign to us considering every other restaurant in Vegas was packed.

After ordering our drinks it took 15 minutes to get a water. After 20 minutes of waiting on a mohjito I finally gave up on the waitress and just walked up to the bar. It had been sitting there the whole time apparently and the bartender gave us a second mohjito for free to compensate. Which is the reason they got 2 stars for the review.

When we finally got our food the waffle fries were soggy and not that great. My fianc√© said the wings were good though. I had a chicken salad and it tasted like fish.

Our waitress continued to ignore us for the rest of our time there and I had to wave her down to get a refill on my water. She never asked how the food was and only came to collect our dishes and deliver the check.",ElNoD208RM5K4W3VORJ1Mg,0,0,2,pz-lyRHtqJvvdWBSMfRZ0w

It was so bad that I have signed up on Yelp just as a warning to the management team of this establishment. My friends and I went to a comedy show at PH on 7/16 around 1030 ish at night and afterward just wanted a pizza and sliders for dinner.  There was trash on most of the tables, there wasn't a bus person around at any point in the 30 minutes we did wait around to clean up the mess.  It was 15 minutes before a waitress even came to our table to tell us that they are behind and asked us if we wanted to wait and we said yes.  There wasn't any offers of beverages nor did she ask if we wanted our order taken as we were willing to wait.  We weren't the only ones to notice the lack of staff as other patrons made complaints, and even the bartender was lackadaisical in his responses to the patrons.  There wasn't any eye contact as the patrons were ignored.  Another 15 minutes rolled around and our waitress failed to come back before we decided that the service was absolutely atrocious and left the premises.  This was the poorest excuse of an establishment that I have ever seen.

Once we placed out order, it probably took about 20 mins to get our food, which is not bad considering the number of ppl at our table.

All-in-all, the wife and I had lunch with two large beers for me and a soda pop for her for $30. Plus we got to watch some baseball and bet on some pony's since it is also a full Sport Book with like 30 big screens.
The hotel and casino is at about the halfway point on the Strip so it makes it a perfect stop for an affordable lunch.",rGaw0eCzfD8dr64I7qvxFw,0,0,4,jYWIhYm8yoxUnMzUlzOs0A

Right across from Earl of Sandwich inside Planet Hollywood.  

Great bar atmosphere, with entire wall TV showing all sports, basketball & football.

For what it's worth, I appreciated the size of these wings, super huge, and breaded nicely, but...the sauces were off.  Especially the honey bbq, tasted way too tangy, a weird after taste.  Spicy garlic was alright.

Just nothing to write home about.  Same for the Nacho cheese waffle fries, it did indeed get soggy after 5 min so wasn't really too appealing, trying to hold onto something haha.  Good value for $5.

But amazing, amazing service with Kristine, she kept on bringing in the bottomless pop, and after the 3rd one, I was honestly tired of Ginger Ale lol.  

cute how they have an empty metal pail in the centre of every table, I was getting pretty proficient at dumping the leftover wings/drumsticks inside.

4561086,2018-06-04,0,63Qj5E-GzHJ6vhjhGR4XDw,"How can I even begin to express my level of dissatisfaction for the service at this restaurant. It was a group of 7 of us who decided to get some wings and drinks because we remember how good the food was from previous visits to Vegas. It took a good 30 minutes to even get acknowledged. After many times of seeing other tables get acknowledged (with only men in their group) by the one woman server, we decided to ask for a manager. After a good additional 20 minutes and asking three different staff members, the manager finally came to see us. He was probably the worst manager I have ever come across in my life. His attitude, demeanor, lack of responsiveness truly made our meal that much worse. He even gave the birthday girl at our table the dismissal hand gesture when she asked for the check (because at this point, we were all wanting to get out of there). On top of this all, they forgot to bring out an entire meal to someone at our table and still had it on his check. When we brought it up, they didn't believe us. I truly cannot emphasize how poor our service was and how horrible the overall experience was for us. I understand that places get busy and that things happen, but this was so unacceptable. I truly cannot use any more words to express this. I cannot emphasize enough on how the manager on staff should not be in this potion.",hhz04ooLxUof6asJ7w6GpA,0,0,1,ZIHK6VH5VizF357VHB74-g

We approach the restaurant and are unsure if we seat ourselves or wait for a hostess. No one ever acknowledges us, so I approach a waitress and ask if we should seat ourselves.  She states yes but she recommends another section because hers was busy and she was the only one working at the time. So she points us in the direction of another section. We walk towards it and see several of the tables have reserved placards. I ask her again to clarify the section. She states she will walk us over. She walks toward the section but then starts talking to other customers. After awkwardly standing there waiting for her to finish, we spot a table that doesn't have a reserved sign and sit there. We wait there for 15 minutes and no one ever comes back to even take a drink order.  We decided to leave and visit another establishment.

5100708,2018-06-04,0,63Qj5E-GzHJ6vhjhGR4XDw,"This place is advertised in a way that makes it seem like a restaurant, but it definitely a bar with some bar foods. The two of us came inside of Planet Hollywood to check this place out because we were in the mood for wings

We chose a table and sat down where we noticed that there were only two servers. Despite both of them making eye contact with us, neither one acknowledged our existence. We waited for 15 minutes for someone to approach us. I stood up and requested two menus from a manager/supervisor who handed them to me without saying a word. 

We looked over the menu, which was priced pretty decently considering the location. Waited another 10-15 minutes to see if one of the servers that had already come to the two tables near us twice would come to take our orders. Nothing. No acknowledgment, no approaching the table. 

Needless to say, we got up and left after that. The service is truly appalling and it was literally the only bad experience I had eating or rather trying to eat anywhere in Vegas. If you come here, I recommend going for drinks and sitting at the bar. However, this bad experience led us to finding a really delicious place to eat so I guess it turned into a win for us.",Ht3tYquf48vHPsDP4cefTw,0,0,1,oAqbZR1ibhTla8ECsWiuHA

I saw the line to Pin Up Pizza next store and was happy to see that it was conveniently on the menu here. We ordered the margarita pizza from there which was great. We also ordered plain chicken wings with two sauces on the side. After eating a few wings, I looked down at my next piece and noticed a white chicken feather still attached to it. Gross! Definitely ruined my appetite and I felt sick to the point where I couldn't stand looking or thinking about the other food we ordered.",60xK0GNdGv0EcaLmmjeZpA,0,1,2,F7MoCMIwEQ9z0714LoMOHw
