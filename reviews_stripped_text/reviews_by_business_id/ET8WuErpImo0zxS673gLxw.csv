They are watery and feel like you've been punished with gruel. We went back and asked for something to add in and they wanted to charge $2.50 for a side a fruit even though the guy asked if I wanted berries on it when I ordered. I guess it was an upsale. Smoothie was good at least. As a local I like to support local businesses.,tM0aXaEVWU-UXzbRV2fj0w,0,0,3,3KnGWlAKFqvx1-FPfrU8wQ

Egg white or egg and cheese hot breakfast sandwiches (lots of cheese, so stick to the cold sandwiches if lactose intolerant). The eggs appear to be egg beaters. I'd give these sandwiches a pass in favor of the other, better options.

Fresh tuna salad, curry and other sandwiches with what appear to be an aggressive expiration for freshness.

The nearest and best rated place I saw was Rachel's Kitchen and after reading some reviews I decided to give it a go. Fresh juices and ready to go food options is what laid before me. I grabbed the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich and ordered up Popeyes Secret juice. The was no line and my juice was whipped up faster than Popeye could pop open a can of spinach.

After I paid (email receipt ftw), I took a sip of the juice and could literally feel the satisfaction in my body as the toxins I've absorbed by simply walking through the smoke filled Casinos started to dissipate. I had to restrain myself from slamming the juice in one go.

Next up was the sandwich. Damn was this good. Best grab and go sandwich I've ever had at an airport. Hell, one of the best things I've ever eaten at an airport period. A little heat from the curry and all the deliciousness you'd expect. Towards the end of the sandwich it started to fall apart but what's that saying? If it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong in your face. I loved it and Vanessa, thank you for making this sandwich. It was great.

To sum it all up, if you're looking for something fast, tasty, healthy and amazing, Rachel's Kitchen is your place to be. Also, look for the sandwiches made by Vanessa. I haven't had any others made by someone else but so far she has me over the moo. 

Update: 5/10, found myself back in Vegas and just had to hit this place up again. Nothing but goodness.

The girls behind the counter had zero training in customer service. Horrible attitudes and flippant behavior. My sister's boss, Erica,  is a pescatarian and asked if they could make her a tuna sandwich. They told her that they were out of tuna. Erica said, ""I am purchasing this tuna salad that is already in my hand that I pulled out of your cold case. Can you put this on bread and make it a sandwich."" This apparently was a confusing request to them.

When asked if we should go sit down, they snipped that it was going to take more than five minutes (okay...) so that we should go.

The smoothie also has banana in it. Everything was perfect except for the raw banana they added to it. If it were ripe, the taste would have gone to another level. However, it still tasted fine and we managed to finish it. 

Watermelon juice I got here tasted just like the homemade one. I can say it is made from fresh cut fruit, no sugar, no water and no ice. Just fresh watermelon. If you are looking for healthy options, I highly recommend getting a watermelon juice. I am glad I ordered the biggest size they offer.
