Le Thai Two

Yes it's their opening week but I have been twice and I can say it's the same great Thai food that comes out of Downtown.

My fav is Massaman curry, it's vegan. Stir Fry Veggies are good too.

Not sure if they offer brown rice but I don't think so.

PLEASE NOTE there are just a few seats in this place, super tiny. 

Serve yourself soft drinks with coke products.

Note that the Pad Thai can not be made vegan because they use fish sauce.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,10,5,f9NLQtFfzYKfwrIBLD3LrA
2422986,2018-05-28,0,joKG-MSwMJdR_OFm4J1WTA,Seriously the best curry that I have ever had. I had the yellow curry with chicken. The chicken was so tender and perfectly cooked and the curry sauce was amazing. They have really great lunch specials too. I will definitely be back!,cfc9h2yQgaaQRtgE2lnePA,1,1,5,5PE9APtSkJ6sr9YcGznebA

The Thom Ka soup is wonderful!",jQep5Iz0Q0xOMY2NMM0iug,0,0,5,BKsTPO-FxV1Ec5kEwmWlDg
2841214,2018-06-04,0,joKG-MSwMJdR_OFm4J1WTA,"I ordered from Le Thai 2 on Grub Hub just an hour ago and really wanted a Thai ice tea but unfortunately that was not listed on the menu. I added a note to add a Thai tea to my order. After spending $20 for just rice, the delivery, and tip, I called the restaurant to see if they would accommodate my request. I also mentioned checking in for a free tea if that were possible. Well long story short I was told they could charge me another $4 for the tea and add it. I spoke to the supervisor who explained why I could not use Yelp to get the tea added. No big deal there.  After already being charged once for rice, I opted out of having a separate charge on my card for the tea (as it would trigger a fraud alert with my bank). I explained that I would have ordered it online but it was not present as a menu option on grub hub. There is no option to order drinks unless you get the lunch special. The manager (Shauna, I think) said she was unaware of that and said thanks for letting her know. Now the Rice is good. I love the Fremont location. But as a customer courtesy and to thank a customer for potentially assisting in your ability to provide your product to other customers, a nice gesture would have been to send the tea anyway at no charge. Instead of talking to me like I was being cheap. I will not order from here again. But Thanks anyway.

6/4/18 - Went back on the Grub Hub site and see that there is now the ability to order various beverages. It's a good I let them know it was missing.",ifkfl9EK-g3Sbd5L9Tm7uA,1,0,2,X3mWPBGQaSX42oTNoZ1YUw
2950104,2018-06-13,1,joKG-MSwMJdR_OFm4J1WTA,"This location should be named Le Thai Express, because it is tiny in size and is fast-casual meaning you order, find a seat, and clean up after yourself. It's ideal for a quick lunch or for take-out, but not ideal otherwise. Utensils and serveware are all disposal, whether you're dining in or not. Dining area is small so if you're a fan of personal space, take your food to-go. Also, not very kid-friendly.

The food was solid and the service was good and prompt. Parking is free, as the restaurant is located in a sketchy plaza.",2hvRUj7K1HCrPyqicuS7gw,1,1,3,6mK5GeviVifFj4m-5MWM-g
3507961,2018-05-03,1,joKG-MSwMJdR_OFm4J1WTA,"I have a few go-to spots for Thai lunch specials and I've had yellow curry plates all around Vegas.  But the Yellow Curry lunch special is hands down the most amazing here.  I love how the meat and veggies are cut into small pieces so I didn't feel the need for a knife like from other places.  The curry is golden and chunky and I went for mild in the spicyness and it was perfect for me.  

The inside is quite cozy with just a few tables and window seating w bar counter and bar stools, so not too good for groups.  

This was my first visit for a takeout order through Yelp/Grubhub and this location is close to work so I will absolutely be back for more.  Located on Charleston just east of Rancho in the same lot as Jimmy Johns...",LNkAC265GTPjy6CR2VkzzA,1,1,5,DL3E_HoZ7eSnRzXsChcXOQ

Le Thai had me at the three color curry. I've never seen it on a menu before. I ordered it with Tofu, along with the pad Thai with tofu. Both are incredible! Awesome decor decor also, I highly recommend this place.",wEjo9IOIV5Rcx1pnWVdVxw,1,0,5,1jfEY39VPsEn5ZoZOMbkVg
4658026,2018-05-19,1,joKG-MSwMJdR_OFm4J1WTA,"As much as I love Le Thai (which is a lot), I love Le Thai 2 even more. It's such a convenient option when I want amazing Thai food. There's a ton of free parking and service is quick because of the counter-order format. There isn't a lot of seating (about 15 people), but I've never had a problem getting a seat. As a bonus, the bar seats even have nearby wall outlets with USB ports.

In terms of the food, you get the same high quality, delicious food that you would on Fremont Street. Since it's more casual, your food will come in disposable containers and you'll be using disposable utensils. The lunch specials are an unbeatable value and what I usually stick with, especially the Ga Pow. However, I make sure to check out the specials board because there might be something extraordinary that catches my eye, like the Le Thai steak and egg, which was fantastic.

I would give it six stars if I could, but since I can't, Le Thai 2 will have to settle for five.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,1,1,5,bTmWrhKvOv3GPlum_GLNCg
5152811,2018-06-02,0,joKG-MSwMJdR_OFm4J1WTA,"If you know Le Thai, expect the same awesome flavors! Same menu! This place is definitely catered to those looking for a quick lunch, but not some lunch from a huge vat. Everything is made fresh. Not many places to sit, but like I said, it's meant for pick up and go.
I will be coming back because getting here and parking is a lot easier than the original.",jsUZoGioikFh0MRyBfbH2g,1,0,5,ABrHDNASt402PX7Qs5QTzA

I know this is a nuance complaint but part of eating Thai food is to eat as it is intended; would you eat a Reuben sandwich without rye bread?",wd-rqesgjt6wx9fz3Qgn3w,1,1,3,-iCKYaAQF3nebJeKVqJUdw
