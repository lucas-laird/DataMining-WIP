35030,2015-11-30,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Last night was my second time at this location. First time, two weeks ago, was a pleasant experience enjoying dinner with a group of workers from our-of-state corporate office, 5 in total. We were seated right away at 6pm, and by 7:30 we were done, already paid and wrapping up when a male manager approached our table and requested us to leave since there were many people waiiting to be seated. We were all disappointed by the request, being the first time we were ever requested to do so at any restaurant, we still did nicely and politely. 

Last night, we went in (7 people) for dinner and were seated in the same section as the first time, and got the same server. We all chose AYCE and barely started ordering appetizers when, again for the first time ever at an AYCE sushi place, the server said we were ordering too much. I could see her later talk to other servers who were taking quick glances at our table. Must I say that I lost appettie over their attitude? Food was good, but not enough to take rude comments from servers and being looked upon as hungry gluttonous people. There are other AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas who will welcome a party of 7 who will pay as much as we did, with a generous tip, 
considering that we ordered items from a-la-carte as well, and who will not give you rude comments.",9XI9WbSHenBDKcQcumPrtQ,2,0,3,J-BmocAQ7AtIISihlkiGbQ

I like my nigiris with different sauces and garnishes. I asked for my squid with shiso leaf on top (which I always get at other sushi places) but the lady didn't know what I was talking about. But I do like the portion sizes of the nigiri... not too much rice and the fish is a perfect size as well. The servers are really nice and friendly. This place is close to my house so I come here occasionally. But again, not my favorite AYCE.",0vDhTzPuthUI_34EUH6v_Q,0,0,3,jFrQ7wluRW-7T5WSWXJKUQ

146876,2016-11-18,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Service was impeccable. The shrimp and calamari tempura were as they should be - crispy and not at all soggy, unlike at some places. Loved the agedashi tofu - crispy on the outside and the tofu melts in your mouth. I like that you can order the rolls with brown rice instead of white, although you'd have to pay $1 extra even if you're doing AYCE. The mocktails are a good concept, esp for those that like mixed drinks but without the alcohol. The arizone sunset mocktail with added pineapple juice was awesome. For rolls, I'd recommed the Next Time roll as well as the old trusy Johnny Roll. I like that they don't try to skimp by overloading the rolls with rice. Laid back, airy, spacious atmosphere and service was quick. And I like that ESPN was on all 3 TVs! 1 star off for not offering half rolls and some of the bulgogi and dynamite was a little on the burnt side. I also wish there was no extra charge for brown rice. Other than that it was awesome.",ybA16x9apMoFIKshZGRtQQ,0,0,4,CyVuf6DMvdjznnBX2rldAQ

Nothing outstanding, nothing horrible, just straight up average sushi. Unfortunately, my experience with the service has caused me to knock off an extra star. I came in with a group of friends for dinner and wanted to do ayce, I didn't even end up getting enough food to justify the price that I paid. Food took far too long to get to the table. The servers' behavior was not much of an issue, just the fact that there wasn't enough staff to get food out quickly enough for the dinner rush.

430636,2017-08-01,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Was it the worst thing ever? No. Was it worth going back to? Probably not.

The only reason why I am giving this three stars is the benefit of the doubt. They could've been experiencing a bad day; however, my experience will cause me to never come back. My coworkers and I got the dine-in deal of 1 classic roll, 1 signature roll, an appetizer, soup, and salad for $12.95. It was a lot of food for the price but the food was just ok and the service was bad.

The soup and salad came out right away. Then there was a very awkward 30 minute break before anyone came back and gave us the additional food. Then the rolls started coming out before the appetizers and two people were given all three items at once while two were given 2/3 items and I was only given 1. We had to wait another 10+ minutes for the rest to come out. When the woman dropped off my signature roll, I had to pull her really long hair out of my roll which just solidified me never going back.

Could they have just experienced a terrible day? Yes, but the restaurant wasn't busy and the sushi was prepared horribly (each piece fell apart when you barely touched it with a chopstick). The taste was fine, but I will continue going to the sushi place that is in the plaza next to Jjanga.",I7VcJTS9npNU5-0XcQuv4w,0,0,3,PUR_G2vNFjAFgsxhkm6XbQ

455522,2015-04-12,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"I'm hoping tonight was just a very (very) off night due to how busy the restaurant was... The food was - as it was the last time I was here - pretty good, but the service was completely horrendous.

My sister and I ordered 9 items a la carte, 8 of which were ordered at the beginning of the meal. Of the 8 that we initially ordered, the waitress that took our order screwed up 1 of the items (twice) and somehow forgot to write down 2 items completely. How anybody is capable of doing this with an 8 item order at a sushi restaurant (especially after asking the customer to repeat each item and then repeating the order back to the customer to confirm) is completely beyond me.

When she brought out the first plate, she realized something was off, put it on the table anyways and immediately picked it up again. She then asked me to confirm that it wasn't what I ordered. For the next minute, she asked me 3 times to tell her the item that I did order.

When this item (a spicy scallop hand roll) finally came out, it wasn't a hand roll... but a cut roll. She put it down, said ""You ordered a hand roll, didn't you..."" I confirmed, and instead of offering to correct her mistake or apologizing, she said ""Don't worry, it's the same price.""

At this point, meh... I was still in a good mood and just chalked it up to how full the place was, the fact that it's a Saturday night so who actually wants to be working, etc etc. After getting 7 items and waiting for a bit for the last two though, a waiter walks by and asks if we're ready for the check. We tell him there should be another 2 coming out (a spicy salmon cut roll and a squid nigiri), so he checks with the sushi chefs, comes back and tells us they don't have record of those orders. So fine, we confirm that we still do want those 2 items and he puts in the order.

After getting the roll, we waited a bit and then asked our original waitress to check on our squid. She checks with the sushi chef and says no, they don't have that order. At this point, we're just ready to go so we ask for the check, which - surprise, surprise - has the squid nigiri that 2 people have now told us we didn't order.

I'm not prone to writing excessively long reviews, but the sheer amount of f*uck ups (for lack of a better word) and the fact that nobody really apologized kinda bugs me.

Needless to say, I won't be back. Food is decent, but that can be said for a lot of places around town - most of which *might* even get your order right the first (or second) time around or at least boast a higher than 67% order accuracy rate.",LsHLa6V26XehI_L1RV8miw,0,0,2,JpIBDo-GVJGWskgru0zwDA

507346,2015-03-25,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Having been a fan of the original location since it opened, we were stoked to hear the second location opening up closer to our house.

Still pretty new with the ""Kanji"" sign still up and easy to find (right next to DW Bistro). We've only had the AYCE so I don't know how the teppenyaki stacks up. 

What I liked:
Same menu as original location, bigger space, seems cleaner because of the brighter colors, option for teppenyaki.

What I didn't like:
The teppenyaki smell you leave with on your clothes (I feel like my hair smells like teppenyaki even after I get home), they don't accept the punch card from the original location, only open for dinner.

The new location is pretty consistent with the original, same quality fish, rolls are rolled well, hot apps come out hot, etc. Seems a little fancier with all ceramic plates instead of the plastic ones at the old location. Service is the same, kind of hit or miss. Some people are really nice, some a little cold, but you can always flag someone down and get what you need. I really love their riceless rolls and the fact that they don't hound you about finishing every bit of rice on your plate. I'm not one of those people who are trying to skimp on rice so I can shove more fish in my belly - I just don't want the extra carbs (female vanity thing). 

Overall, a great option if craving AYCE in Vegas. We've tried our fair share of different places and Jjanga by far has been one of the most consistent and fresh (well, as fresh as AYCE fish goes, it's no Kabuto or Soho) places. Pretty normal pricing for AYCE, but nice with riceless rolls and a decent variety of apps.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,0,2,4,nR0f9FtaH86_oM5xpcIkGw

655782,2016-03-12,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"After hearing so much good things about this restaurant, we decided to celebrate our daughter's 8th Birthday here. It was a Friday evening, so a bit busy on the AYCE sushi side. 

Upon arrival we were greeted. Nice atmosphere, music a bit loud. Other than that, it's a good place. I would have liked to give this restaurant 4 stars, because really our food was tasty and our chef was the bomb. 

The cons. We waited about 20 minutes for our dinner to even begin, which we had our kids ages 18, 16, our 8 year old Birthday girl and our toddler son who is 2. Try telling your young ones, the food will be coming shortly or even our appetizers, which never came until we asked about it. By this time our entrees were being cooked, but our son had fell asleep before he could even eat anything. Our waitress never came by to refill our drinks or even ask if we needed anything or asked if we were ok. Pisses me off I had to leave a tip for such bad service, but our chef Joshua did an outstanding job with our food, that we decided to tip 16% If he hadn't made us laugh and did an awesome job, I would have left a $5 tip and a piece of my mind on that receipt. 

Management needs to talk to staff and make sure their employees are well trained. Our waitress passed us by a handful of times, never once asking if we were good. There's no excuse to be treated this way. She was later relaxing with others by the bar. To me, this is totally unprofessional. If you're done with work, LEAVE. I could be opinionated, because the fact that we spent so much and still left a tip, makes me so angry. This wasn't our first choice, but since so much friends highly recommended it and it's 5 minutes from our place, we decided to give it a try. Not sure if we'd give this place another try, but the food is good and Chef Joshua or Blaze (same guy) was awesome. For us or I speak for myself, first impressions of a food establishment say a lot. Too bad our first experience here, wasn't as great as our friends. Hands down to the waitress that picked up our waitresses slack tho.",re3C9Kw0s7mPDugRyw0WTg,1,0,3,nlb6NE9QLiG7Vx7Vx0NR8Q

So I guess if your on a date, there is no privacy and you have to wait an hour to be seated. not great for my taste. Speaking of taste, the sushi was awesome.. to an extent.  and I don't like my food cold, unless its ment to bee cool. the sushi we got was Luke warm and not okay because the cream cheese was too soft that the roll wasn't the right shape.  Also I believe that there should be one waiter assigned to certain tables. A lot of the time it was 3-4 different people that would come to take your plates and bring you more sushi. however, all of the employees just walk around so fast. its impossible to get their attention. which wouldn't be a problem if my table got touched every once and a while.",HYM6k4ZSJhlBvClDVLUBHQ,0,0,2,NWh6L0iU0Lzdkc6wgM133w

My one complaint is that the chairs if you could call them that are probably the most uncomfortable thing you could sit on. The chairs are literally square plywood boxes.

Cool thing is, it's away from the hustle and bustle of the strip or even Freemont. Located inside of a strip mall/restaurant area, its not hard to find. I jumped out of the car and almost ran inside. Fat life.

As soon as the waiter got to the table all I wanted to know was if I could get a menu with the sushi burgers. Ain't NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT!!!!! 

However, lol, we ended up getting the sushi burrito, a couple of sushi rolls ANNNNNDDDDDDD *drum roll* A SUSHI BURGER. Namely ""The Karai"" which is spicy tuna, crab, salmon, cucumber, lettuce and screaming orgasm sauce in between a ""bun"" of deep fried rice patties! When I bit into it..... sweet Asian baby Jesus - AMAZING! Maybe it was the deep fried rice patties that were fried ever so golden brown.

I'm always really skeptical of buffet sushi because the quality tends to be poor at most places. Not the case here. All dishes are made to order. 

I've been to Jjanga twice, and both times I have left extremely full and satisfied. The all you can eat menu is $20.95 for lunch and $25.95 for dinner. The fish was fresh, and there are so many options on the menu, so I think the price is more than fair. My favorites are the pink lady and candy cane rolls. Their hand rolls are also delicious, and you can't go wrong with traditional nigiri. Note that you will be charged for leftovers, and you're limited to 45 min of ordering time for lunch and 1 hour for dinner -- basically, strategize a little and don't over-order! The menu is HUGE, so it might make sense to look at it online first to get a general sense of what you might want to order.

We just moved and are new to the area, were very skeptical about trying new places (and only ended up here because SOHO on Jones are closed!) -- but we've been here TWICE in the last two weeks because it's THAT good!

All-you-can-eat lunch (from 11:30AM-3:00PM) is $20.95, and dinner until close is $25.95. SO WORTH THE PRICE! They have a very extensive menu with appetizer side dishes, soup & salad, special sashimi, nigiri sushi, vegetable rolls, hand rolls (sushi burritos!), classic rolls, no rice rolls, and a looong list of shrimp tempura rolls, spicy rolls, baked rolls, non-spicy special rolls and deep fried rolls! Did I mention they are open until 2:00AM?! (Last call for AYCE is at 1:30AM btw!)

I highly recommend...
APPETIZERS:
- Golden scallop (one order per person)
- Who's your daddy (I think they took this off the original menu recently)
- Vegetable tempura
- Dynamite
- Crab ball
- Cocaine (special sashimi)
SUSHI:
- Grand Canyon (I think this is my favorite!)
- Dancing eel roll (This is like butter! So smooth!)
- Jjanga special roll (They took this off the menu, but if you're lucky the chef at the bar might make it still!)
- Spider roll (A classic you can't go wrong with)
- Johnny roll (No rice roll with a nice twist!)
- Surf & Turf roll (So many flavors in this one!)
- Salmon nigiri (All their nigiri listed below is SO fresh!)
- Salmon belly nigiri
- Uni nigiri
- Albacore nigiri 
- Cajun albacore
- Cajun tuna albacore
- Oysters (one order per person)

PRO TIP: They also offer hibachi teppanyaki on the other side of the restaurant, and have a full bar as well!

You cant order half rolls which is a bummer but wise on there part

We were the only two at the bar & there were two small tables, not busy at all.  We ordered All You Can Eat $25.95, usually a great deal as you see from my previous reviews... however Koo Koo was not on this shift who is the best.  

Also there was a horrible stench of sewer like the sink was backing up behind the sushi counter.  I would've walked out, but we didn't smell it until after ordering.

The Age Dashi Tofu was horrible.  Fried tofu in a soupy mess so the fried part melted off.  $3 of wasted calories.  

The FreshMen riceless roll was watery & had too much radish & only a sliver of avocado for the whole roll.  I usually get this to so I know what it's suppose to taste like.  $9

Something Wrong 69 is also our usual, but was just ok.  $9

The best part was the small seaweed salad $4, salmon & yellowtail sushi, 2 pcs $4.  Wonder why when I ordered 4 salmon we got seven pieces not eight.  Also we never got the octopus & the sushi in the right fridge was better than the sushi bar fridge on the left cause our second plate of sushi was ok.  Nothing special.

We've been to a few hibachi spots in Vegas and compared to them these guys were amateurs. They main ingredient is yum yum so if you don't like the stuff you're pretty much left with salt and pepper. They offer a deal like no other place where you can pick two proteins for 20$ or 3 for I think 25$. Don't expect much food for that. The proteins are poor very small and bad quality. They also don't use garlic they just have a garlic flavored butter. We asked for a side of garlic butter sauce and they literally melted butter on the grill and put it in ramekins. So let's see they don't have garlic butter they don't have oyster sauce. The best food they had was edamame... oh and good drinks. Oh my goodness and the noodles, you're better off without. They are pretty much spaghetti noodles with lettuce and carrot shavings. Don't let the looks fool you this place looks nice but the taste isn't there.

1375842,2015-02-06,15,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Always been a big fan of Jjanga and his work over at his original location down on Spring Mountain Rd. I heard through the grapevine that he had expanded and had opened a second restaurant over on the west side. Even more intriguing was the fact that he had taken over Kanji restaurant, which was known for it's teppanyaki. A group of us headed over to check out his new place recently, and suffice to say, it's all good... in the hood!

Jjanga is located on the west side over near Fort Apache and Warm Springs. They have taken over the space that was formerly known as Kanji Steak and Sushi. But, they have retained the teppanyaki at this location, so even if you are not in the mood for sushi, you can get your onion volcano fix here. The interior is definitely very cool and classy. It's probably one of the more upscale sushi spots here in town. If you do go the teppan route, that side of the restaurant is very fun and exciting.

But oh, let me talk to you about the sushi, because it is something that you should definitely not miss out on. Jjanga (and also a different restaurant) is in my top two favorite ayce sushi spots in Vegas. He uses a lot of fresher product than most other places, and he would not be willing to send out anything that isn't up to his standards. The cuts of fish used on the nigiri are thick, and the rice portions are small. That's a big plus for me. And, the rice is cooked really well here. I'm not personally a big fan of rolls, but Jjanga does make some good ones. My group ordered some, and I was able to sample a few, and in conclusion, they were really good, with all the flavors balancing out with each other (and also, Jjanga probably makes the best salmon skin hand roll in town).

A lot of people take apps for granted when they go to a sushi restaurant. I would urge you to not look over the apps at Jjanga, because you would be missing out. Because the same care and quality he and his chefs put into the sushi, the same great quality and care is being put into the appetizers. The first thing you must order is the golden scallop. A thick, meaty, whole scallop that is lightly battered, and simply fried. It's a great way to start your meal. The baby octopus is a textural sensation, with the chewiness of the octopus, offsetting with the crispiness in the preparation. And do save yourself room for an oyster. That would be the icing on the cake! But try all the apps, i'm sure you won't be disappointed.   

Jjanga has been killing it at his original location and it only makes sense for him to expand due to the growing popularity. The skill, the eye, the level of detail, and the caring for his guests are without question. No doubt I will be back and I always bring people here who want some great quality sushi from a great chef. Thanks Jjanga!!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,25,20,5,sTgTQHJ2R-tVtwzyxdkw8w

We saw a sign that said free dessert with a 5 star review so that's why this restaurant has a 4 star overall rating. Its a shame that people will spend their money here.

First time - teppanyaki side
This was back in January celebrating a friend's bday. Their teppanyaki side has everything you would expect! Good seating around the stove, an entertaining chef, and most importantly delicious food! Idk if it was just this specific visit or not, but it definitely felt like that the food was not only cooked and prepped conserve but it was fast! I've been to other teppanyaki places before and it felt like forever before I was able to eat, but to my knowledge not here at jjanga!

Second time - sushi side
I can say that this is now top 3 sushi places in Vegas for me. They have a huge selection and whats crazy is that they have items that I've never seen at other sushi restaurants! I also love that they have a specific ""no rice"" section for all the peeps that are watching carb intake! I'm a huge fan of fried rolls so to have a section labeled just for me, I was def awe struck. 

All in all this a great restaurant, and a great venue weather it be eating alone at the sushi bar or hosting a party at either the teppanyaki or sushi side!

Service at the bar was polite and attentive. Location is also outfitted with hibachi seating. 

The Karai burger on panko bun is $11 and so enormous I couldn't fit it in my mouth without removing the top bun- and I can fit a lot of stuff in my mouth, so already I was impressed. The bun bottom bun held up well despite being overtaxed by the full load. I actually ended up setting it down and forgetting the bun altogether to eat the toppings off with chopsticks about halfway in, because I was getting full. The soft shell crab, salmon, crab, and sauces combined well and were complemented by fresh, crunchy lettuce.

Ordered one of the sushi burgers that looked so good, the Jjanga and Kanai sushi burger. Wasn't a long wait for it to be made. We ordered the combo which came with fries and a soda of choice. The burger was a 7 or 8 out of 10 for me. Definitely filling off of just the burger, and I was starving. Here's my downside: we never got our order of fries and we were never served or checked up on by any one of the servers the entire time we ate. The only time we did was when they served our drinks and our sushi burger once we sat down and ordered. We had to stop a server serving other customers at the table next to us to check up on our fries, and she said she would, but walked the opposite way of the kitchen and actually never came back,  lol. It wasn't until one server came and noticed us sitting there waiting, and we asked for our check and told her about our fries, but we were over it. They didn't charge us for the combo, just the sushi burger itself which was like $9 ($3 added for combo), which should be the case anyways, and gave us these melon popsicles to say sorry. She was sweet and nice and said sorry tho! So overall, probably bc it was busy, but seriously, not once didn't anyone check up on us for the hour or so we were there? 3/5 stars bc of the service!",W4e_-B1QgQl4jOXO7UpINg,0,0,3,IraAYK-i_N5HC317c-G1HA

Tonight was the worst...and the last time we'll go for sure: we've been home two hours and we're both already feeling sick. The nigiri was all fishy tasting...definitely not very fresh. The rice in the rolls and the nigiri was literally falling apart as soon as we picked it up. The baked rolls were burnt. The cucumber wasn't fresh at all. The best thing on the table tonight out of nigiri (salmon, yellow tail, super white tuna, and halibut), appetizers, and various special rolls, was the ginger. At least that tasted fresh.

1568407,2016-10-21,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! I've been here 2 times now & both times have been a horrible experience. I didn't want to give this place my business but my co-workers wanted to come here so I was willing to give them a 2nd chance. Came in just before noon on a Friday with 4 other co-workers. Overall there was about 15-17 people in the restaurant with what looked to be 1 waiter who didn't really give a darn about customer service. There were 2 sushi chefs behind the counter that seemed more interested in chatting w/ each other than making the food for the patrons. We were seated with only AYCE menus as if they expected us all to do AYCE. Asked for lunch menus & waiter said he had to find them. Find them?! What the heck. Waited for over 10 minutes for them to find the lunch menus & when the waiter came back I asked again for the lunch menu as he took our drink order. He said that ""she"" was trying to find them. I then asked how long he thought it was going to take & mentioned that we were on our lunch hour. He stated he didn't know. I mean seriously how can you not know where your lunch menus are? Finally received 1 lunch menu & we asked for another since not all of us were doing AYCE. Another couple of minutes passed. We finally received was all our drinks. My co-worker mentioned that his glass was all sticky & something white all over the outside of it. Yuck! I told him to ask for a new one but he was afraid of the time it would take. Their lunch menu on their website is different than what it is actually in the restaurant as now in the restaurant is everything is al a cart & you have to pay extra for soup & salad. Where as before when I dined here (13 months ago) & on their website you can choose 2 or 3 items for each different price & it comes w/ salad & soup. Finally after we had been there already 20 minutes the waiter comes over & says ""are you ready to order"" as if he was waiting on us this while time. I again mentioned that we were on our lunch hour & asked if he know how long stuff would take. He said he didn't know & said everyone came in at once. Um no not everyone came in at once as there was already 10 people seated when we arrived. I looked around at a couple of tables of 4 or 5 people & they were all waiting on everything too. I could tell some of them were looking irritated as well. Since some of our party wanted to partake in AYCE I knew this would take forever! We got up & left right then & there. There's no reason on a Friday at noon that you only have 1 waiter & don't know where your lunch menus are. This was just ridiculous! I've been to the original Jjanga several times & it's always speedy & great. This location on Fort Apache needs to get their act together. Both times I've been there the service has been horrible. Even my other co-workers that have been there a few times said that it's slow but not normally as bad as today. I gave it a 2nd shot & it fell far from expectations.

1644213,2015-03-10,5,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"This place rocks as far as the steakhouse part of Jjanga Steak and Sushi goes. Been here three times already since their soft opening. Each visit has been consistent as far having an overall good dining experience.

Hibachi side:

This is where we dined for all three visits. There are several hibachi stations that can accommodate both small and large groups.  There's also dining tables for those who don't want the dinner show dealie. There was no wait for seating availability during the first hour they are open for dinner. I still made reservations in advance each time.   

Menu is pretty simple. The starter entree of salad, soup, rice and veggies listed at top of menu is required of all guests dining at the hibachi table. From there you pick your add-ons from 4oz chicken,NY Steak, Filet Mignon, Scallops, or Mahi Mahi. Each piece prices ranged from $5.50- 8.  Lobster and Calamari are 7oz and pricier.  

The combo special for 32.95 is the way to go! It comes with Filet Mignon, Chicken, Shrimp and Lobster, includes your starter entree and your choice of appetizer! (we've had Gyoza and Eggrolls)  Mr B ordered his starter entree and his add-ons, we shared the chicken and appetizer from my combo. This was plenty enough food for the both of us.  The portions of fried rice was generous. The bowls of salad and soup was just right. Everything tasted delicious!! I especially enjoyed the very tender filet mignon. The lobster was just a tad tough though. So if you are not getting the combo special, Id skip the lobster.

The dinner show each time was pretty entertaining. It's kitschy(onion volcano) and cheesy(choo choo train), but definitely a fun social experience! We have had different personal chefs each visit and they all have mad teppanyaki skills ala Jackie Chan. They all were pretty personable and knew how to entertain as well as cook and got the orders right for each member of our group.

Ambience - Trendy/Casual. The place is open and airy. The hibachi stations are spread out. The sushi part is sectioned off. The bar area flows into the hibachi part.  Only one minor complaint.  The music being played was too loud and the music choice was more dance club. It would be nice if they can tone it down a bit especially if the majority of diners are ""old people"" like us. Ha! 

Service -  A+. Rockstar staff here. The host already knows us and welcomed us back.  Staff kept up with drink refills and clearing our table.  Most recent visit was a birthday celebration with our good friends. It was totally unexpected when they all came out after dinner with red bean ice cream with a candle singing Happy Birthday. Totally unexpected and a nice surprise. Thanks for giving special attention to the little one and the teen in our group too. 

I definitely would recommend this place.  Worth the trip coming from our neck of the woods in Henderson. The food is pretty good, the prices are right, and it's family friendly. Five Sake Bombs!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,8,5,5,GQUM6JjB7gcSsvkry-Gywg

They have the hibachi tables and chefs in the front and the sushi bar and seating on the side. This isn't your average sushi place where you are all squished in one room. It's very spacey and gives your more privacy. We have followed Jjanga to each of his restaurants and I plan on continuing that tradition until the end of time. The sushi is fresh, and they accomodate to your tastes. My first time doing the hibachi will be on my birthday so I can't wait!

The service is on point with the host and hostesses taking the time to explain things on the menu as well as giving you a timely heads up if something isn't quite right with your order. 

The price is the same (which is really good for what you get at dinner or lunch) and the quality of the food is still top notch.

While the plates aren't as stackable (a minor complaint (;), I will totally be making a return trip here since it's so on point and so close.

1822776,2017-02-10,6,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Been a little sushi obsessed lately so here I am writing another review for yet another sushi establishment. Sorry, not sorry. Like others who have reviewed before me, this is an all-you-can-eat type place, so snobs need not apply. You get good, tasty, creative sushi for a good price, and that's all I require. 

Not only is the bang for your buck good here, the service is also great. Bringing out plates and clearing as you go; always coming back to take your next order. I love that they don't rush you out and give you time between each dish. The ENTIRE MENU (minus the very few items in red type) is on the all-you-can-eat menu. So, go ahead and get 6 orders of potstickers... you and your $20 deserve it. 

The potstickers were crispy and not greasy. Definitely a top appetizer choice. Some of my favorite rolls are the Yellow Yellow, Sexy Time, and the Fresh Men Roll. First two are spicy, last one is no rice. All amazing and different. 

There is a lunch special menu as well that mainly consists of Sushi Burritos and poke bowls, but looks scrumptious, although I haven't tried it yet. Also, if you aren't in the mood to gorge yourself you can always order a la carte. Although, if you decide to get more than two rolls, you might as well go all-you-can-eat. 

All in all, a great quick spot to pop by for lunch during the day, drinks in the evening or a date night. Great atmosphere and music. Definitely will be a regular given how close it is to my workplace. Dangerously close? Probably.",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,9,6,5,oBE85_yEzu7tydFo7SdLEQ

1823374,2015-05-03,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"This review is for the sushi portion only. We haven't tried the Hibachi yet, but plan to.



There's a lot of sushi places and the all you can eat sushi places are more common now than ever. That being said, very few get it right. There are some that score highly with certain aspects e.g. atmosphere, food quality, service, etc. but hardly ever do any of these types of places get everything right. Well.. this one does.

Walking in, you'll soon realize how big this place is. It's big enough to have both a hibachi area with multiple tables and a designated sushi area complete with a full sushi bar. Ambiance is nice and modern but still with some of that traditional flavor. I especially liked that the walls had large stylized posters of their hibachi and sushi chefs. One of them was even wearing a captain america mask with a train whistle -- his name was ""choo choo."" I could already tell i'd like this place.

We were greeted by a man named Nate who made sure throughout the entire time we were there that we were enjoying ourselves and being taken care of. After he sat us, he'd stop by multiple times to ask if everything was okay, give us suggestions, and even drink with us. The thing is, he wasn't even our server. To be taken care of to that extent by someone who wasn't even your server is pretty awesome. On that note, our server, Antonio, was also excellent. He had a really bright personality and was extremely helpful with recommendations, having conversations with us, the whole experience. He was really funny and also gave his all to make sure we were having a good time and that we were enjoying the food. I never had to flag him down or ask for refills or anything. We were sitting at the sushi bar which limited our interaction with the server, but he was great. Nate and Antonio are awesome and I hope to see the both of them again whenever I come back (which will be often). 

Okay, now on to the meat of the review. To put it bluntly, the food is very good. We tried a bunch of the nigiri, rolls, appetizers, and drinks. I'm big on nigiri and can't say I had anything I didn't like here. My personal favorites were the garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail. Not only does the food here taste good, but the presentation is also excellent. Rolls were also really good. I liked the Joe's Special and Fresh men which had no rice. Some of the names of the things are crazy like ""something wrong #69"" and my personal favorite ""burning your ass."" Although we sat at sushi bar, we didn't catch the sushi chef's name but she was very attentive and quick. You can tell this place is serious about good food, but also has a sense of humor which shows in the menu and in the service. Nate made us some shots that we had never hear of or had before and all of them were really good. We had green tea shot, gummy bear shot, and a green sour one that I think only Nate knows how to make. Everyone liked all of them and we are definitely coming back for more.

Overall, I have to rate this place 5 stars. I honestly can't think of a single complaint or issue. We all likes the atmosphere, service, food, and really enjoyed ourselves. If you like AYCE sushi and want to have a good time, this is the place to go. We haven't tried the hibachi side yet, but we definitely want to. Since it's JJANGA, i'm sure it's going to be awesome.",EXbyufJelRPBSAEgNbWTIw,1,0,5,PZvd-myTiOfzxw6j5AnzjA

I think we dined on THE WORST NIGHT. First, the restaurant was HOT because one of the AC units stopped working. Second, the service was slow. No one came to our table to offer refills or to ask if we wanted another beer. I wanted more freakin sushi but didn't have a chance to order because again we weren't checked on. We had our two children with us and I had to walk to the bar to ask for refills of their beverage. After being there for an hour and still not being serviced my family got up and walked to the counter to pay. I mentioned my disappointment to the manager on duty and he response was that they will do better next time then I felt insulted with the fact he tried to compensate with giving my children Dollar Store toys for the kids. The service we received is NOT what we are use to from JJanga.

I love the quality and variety of sushi offered at such a great price considering... creative rolls, no rice rolls and options, sushi burritos, salads and all of the Japanese sides. All of the sauces are amazing, yet jus the forewarned they're heavily sauced so if watching your 'macros' simply request light sauce or no mayo-based sauce ie yum yum.. That being said, this is the second time we have dined here with sub-par Service. Half of our table was AYCE and the other half simple ala carte ordering. Ordering was kept simple as a courteous to waitress, yet as the meal progressed we were pretty much forgotten on several occasions, with the waitress no where to be found even after sushi rolls were left sitting, ready at the sushi bar. Even after Kindly requesting more prompt service and attention, the waitress insisted that anyone could take care of us... I wish I could say the restaurant was overly busy or give some other excuse for such lack of service and indifferent answer. It could be a training issue, not really sure. We even tipped 20% over the 20% included gratuity not paying much attention to the bill. No sure if I can recommend this location or bring friends or family to this location.

The waitresses are pretty nice, the guys at the bar aren't the easiest to talk to but are still pretty solid service wise. I didn't have a single dish here that was great, but most were at least okay. I liked the little fish salads, but limiting to one order for such small dishes is kind of absurd.

the decor in the restaurant is nice. the servers are nice also. we came in right around dinner time, so it got busy in there. 

when we first arrived the restaurant wasn't to busy, but by the time we ordered it was packed.

drinks came promptly, but after that initial drink drop off and the first order given, it took about 20 minutes to get all of what we first ordered. the time lapse between ordering we did and actually getting it was way to long. 

the chefs behind the bar were clearly overwhelmed with the amount of sushi being ordered. to wait as long as I did just for a few hand rolls and standard sushi cuts was pretty annoying. the fish tasted ok, nothing really special. they do use a LOT of rice so be prepared to fill up on that. the hand rolls and burrito rolls were overly stuffed with rice to fill you up faster. 

I doubt I would eat here again with sushi mon and sushi koma near by, there's just no point.

I tried a variety of rolls and nigiri. Their fish is what you call quality and it was all fresh which is always a plus. The cuts of nigiri were the perfect size and the ratio between the fish and rice was on point. I feel like some sushi spots tend to put too much rice. I loved that they had a no rice roll section. Try the spring mountain and the tuna naruto roll. Super bomb! The staff was super friendly and they came by with chef's specials and samples of drinks. I wanted to give them five stars because everything tasted amazing and everyone was so nice, but I think the staff was also slightly overwhelmed that night. I was with five other people and we noticed that from our first order, we had three rolls missing and a few orders of nigiri missing. So I had ordered my missing rolls and nigiri again and just figured they were really busy. I eventually got my nigiri and still wasn't brought a roll that was missing the first time around.

So it's my first time in Las Vegas with my boyfriend, and we wanted to check out this place because I had read it was the #1 sushi restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Boy, it did NOT disappoint and it only EXCEEDED expectations with every bite. Yum!

Our waiter, Alex, took very good care of us and was very kind and welcoming. He recommended we try the monkey burrito and that first bite was literal heaven. The fresh taste and mix of textures was delicious! And I'm a sucker for anything with crab, so it was definitely one of my favorites.

We took advantage of the all-you-can-eat lunch menu (it's available 11:30 am-3:30 pm for $20.95 per person and it's honestly one heck of a deal! So much bang for your buck) and ended up getting an appetizer (the Bulgogi was fire!!!!), 6 different rolls, a burrito, AND Korean ice cream sandwich. That's incredible!

1) When we were ordering for the AYCE, 2 out of 3 of us had ordered when we were told by the server ""I think this is enough for now."" However, the 3rd person still wanted to add 3 more orders of sushi but the server repeated the same thing, so goes without saying, we did not get the 3 extra order. After our first round was finished he acted really surprise that we finished, when we told him from the get go that we were going to be ordering a lot, but that we will definitely finish. I get that they do not want people ordering food and wasting by not finishing. If he had said what he did during our second round of ordering, then I would understand, but during the first round? No. If we did order too much and did not finish, and he told us once, then charge us for the waste, there is no need to repeat. Needless to say, we finished everything. 

2) We constantly had this one person (perhaps the manager) that was always walking by our table. Yes, I get it that you wanted to make sure that no one ordering AYCE was sharing with those that ordered A La Carte but do you have to walk by that many times? He might as well have sat down and watched us eat. 

Overall, the quality of the food was good, but the service needs improvement. There's more subtle ways to go about doing what they did/say. Also asked for an extra sake cup, and napkins, numerous times before we got the things we requested. At times they put the A La Carte items on the side the 3 AYCE people were sitting. We even grouped ourselves like so to make things easier for them to serve and monitor (as they were doing) us too, but that did not work out.",lI0IoFidQmxNnSHWyytMaA,1,2,4,_qiQNbQKJBzVsjCZufJ81Q

One can literally get full on appetizers alone.. Baby octopus, shumai, garlic edamame & gyoza just to name a few. For AYCE its pretty inexpensive and you definitely have a lot to choose from. No matter lunch or dinner we always opt for dinner, we love their oysters and beef tataki which are limited to one order per person. We've out smarted the system and order the red bull roll which has beef tataki across the whole roll, its one of our favorites. 
The only con is that they don't do half orders. But as long as you go with a partner you can always share and try more rolls that way.",tmQWOfzuOcPKkW1T0PnQkw,0,0,5,KOTz5fK4GwmvVFVMZHhfxw

We had decided to go with Al A Carte after seeing the menu was not badly priced! $7 sushi burritos and $4 classic rolls which are perfect for me since I am pregnant and can't eat raw fish. When we received 3 sets of 8pc. classic rolls, they were as basic as it gets. They were cut really thin to make it an 8pc sushi roll. I guess that's why it's $4. One of the rolls placed on the table was the wrong roll, the server noticed that she said the wrong name but then still assured us it was the correct roll. It didn't have any sauce and was def not the roll we ordered. My husbands sushi burrito arrived first and wow it looked good. It was decent sized and came with a side of spicy mayo and eel sauce, he did enjoy it. Shortly after mine was brought to the table and literally was half the size of his and did not come with the eel sauce it was suppose to. It tasted good but I realized it was also missing broccoli tempura like the menu said it came with. Overall it was a sad and disappointing experience and we most likely aren't coming back here since there are many other better sushi places out there.

But back to the sushi. Getting seated is often very prompt. You will be asked if you want to order items A La Carte or AYCE and of course, the way to go is the latter. You can order as many rolls and hand rolls and nigiri as you want - with exception to a few items on the list and depending on whether it's available during either lunch or dinner.

My go to items are:

-Screaming Orgasm
-Cocain
-Salmon and Yellowtail nigiri (multiple orders)
-Lisa Hand Roll with added spicy mayo
-Apple #1 roll
-White Lady roll

And of course you have to get UNLIMITED green tea ice cream and pick a Mochi prior to leaving.

We were there an hour! It was not busy and there were 2 sushi chefs just talking to each other. I remember the chef had this obnoxious graffiti hat.

Dining Experience: As soon as we got seated, our waiter left us for a good 10-15 minutes. We didn't even water or any plates on the tables. When we finally got a waiter's attention, the food took about 25-35 minutes to come out. Funny enough, out food that we got weren't even the ones that we had ordered. When we told our waiter, he had no idea what we even ordered and it took another 30 minutes to get our rolls and nigiri out. Eating AYCE, that takes us about most of the time you're allowed to eat there. 

Food: I noticed how they change a few things on the menu. One of my favorite things to get here were the baby octopus. They limited it to one per person and it's small :-( and not even half as flavorful as it was before. 


Overall: I used to love going to this place. I always raved to my boyfriend that we should finally go together and try it after so long. It was very disappointing. They've really knocked down on the wait for food, quality of food, and so forth.

They don't take reservations so you may have to wait a little for a seat.  They offer seating for hibachi as well as for sushi.  For a table of two, we waited like 15 minutes or so.  Jjanga had a nice environment, clean, modern, and welcoming.  The servers were very attentive as they came and checked on us regularly.   My soda was always refilled before it was empty.   Which is how I judge a big portion of how the service is.  

As for the food...   I got the monkey burrito.   The flavors melded together really well and I really enjoyed the sauce that went with it.  It wasn't too big but it was filling and was about as big as I expected.  My wife got the yum yum roll ($4 for 8 pieces) and the volcano roll ($9 for 8 pieces I believe).   I'm not a sushi expert by any means but it was flavorful and seemed fresh.   Both rolls were extremely good to me.   We also got the bugolgi app.  Thought it was good.  Not great.  Probably would try something else if getting an app next time.

The decor was different from other sushi houses. It didn't seem dim and the restaurant had more of an open feel. They have a bar near the entrance that allows you to enjoy a cocktail while waiting. 

We arrived at the perfect time because it wasn't busy YET! They have both sushi tables and tepan tables so you could enjoy either. We opted for a sushi table. Our server greeted us promptly and took our drink order. The food came out quick, really quick actually. So either they were prepared for tonight or they just got the food prep down. Quality of sushi....fresh! Sweet shrimp, yuzu yellowtail, garlic tuna and uni!  I tried the Q roll which is one of their riceless rolls and wasn't a huge fan, a bit disappointing. I had heard alot about the riceless rolls so i was curious. The white fish thry used tasted tough and cooked so definitely not the flavor i was expecting. The AYCE menu is larger than the other AYCE spots I've been too, so I was able to try a lot more dishes Vs just sushi or nigiri.

Service was great, they work more as a team there it seems. So you don't just have one server, but multiples.

The service and decor are very good, BUT the oily/smokey nature of hibachi is prevalent throughout the restaurant. So if you are extra sensitive to particulates in the air and somewhat smokey odors, you might have an uncomfortable time breathing here.

The fish quality is satisfyingly good here, but the preparation/presentation is a tragedy. The nigiri here would make Jiro Ono's head explode.

In the Summerlin area, you go to Ohjah for ala carte and Sushi Koma for AYCE. My girlfriend and I, who both work in the Vegas service industry, were excited to try a new establishment. With open minds, we still knew Jjanga had some strong competition.

Jjanga exceeded all expectations in every realm of a sushi place. I never in my life had fresher sushi (all meats shipped in everyday), the ambiance is progressive, beautiful and unique, the prices are unbelievable for the quality and the service is nothing under top notch.

Jung knew Jjanga like the back of his hand. He was patient, knowledgeable, honest and more than a server, but a friend we just met that night. We will request him every time. Yet even beyond this, other servers were genuinely concerned with our well being and satisfaction. 

This is the first review I've ever written in which I have nothing negative to say about am establishment, for constructive criticism of course.

I feel like the quality of the fish is top notch with other top AYCE sushi spots! Unlike the original at this location they also offer Teppanyaki Hibachi style. Not really fan of the whole Hibachi show but while sitting with friends for AYCE. We were able to watch some of the show and seems like the customers at the tables were having good time. Maybe next time have the urge might check other half of the restaurant. One side have the Hibachi and the other side have traditional restaurant style for AYCE or a la carte style sushi. One of the other differences is this place is lot bigger and lot more modern. The sushi bar is decent size and if ever want get Jjanga on solo more then enough room plus have nice wide screen televisions above. The service was awesome! They were on top of all of our orders every round and never empty glass in front of us. 

Something I enjoy looking at the menu. Just the creative names they have for some of there sushi rolls. Not that the rolls itself is totally different then other rolls find at other sushi spots. I like the fact they have fun with different names and thinking outside the box. I enjoy the spicy roll section there really not bad one to choose from. Best part about have another Jjanga is never have enough of good thing in life. Quality sushi seems like lost art in Vegas with the abundance of AYCE sushi. Jjanga is one that deserve five star and would put it right up there with any other five star sushi spot in Vegas.

Example, oysters, sea urchin, (it's printed in red on the menu).

Their menu prices have now changed and Jjanga is now more affordable than ever!! The place is alway clean and friendly, bright yet personal, we always have such a wonderful experience with the staff. Ellen is so fun, I feel like the staff at Jjanga are family. We were coming often even before the prices changed, now Jjanga is easily affordable a several times a week! $21 for three HEAPING rolls? #sold. Don't walk, run. You won't regret it.",F30hW73J1qOctAv46kznGA,5,1,5,AJXGpMxouSviZHGgmeDrPw

1. Servers are on point, always refilled our drink.
2. Ambiance was good and played alot of musical variety
3. I love how there are huge posters of the chefs, made me feel I was at a IronChef studio Lol
4. The overall staff had a good vibe, it seemed like they love to work there, like what theyre doing and always attentive to our orders.

Moving on with our food...

1. I like the rice portion, its not too much..
2. They have freshest oyster you could ever had a Las Vegas
3. The food portions are perfect.
4. Food came out fast during dinner service.
5. The best garlic tuna

I wish they also have hamachi kama and soft shell crab that will make my rating over 5 stars Lol. But other than that, I will surely come back as this restaurant is very close to my house.",BNl2XXQooLshNexhGJZShw,0,0,4,jmGbR_Hfn4px2LQGRoXSsg

1. AYCE... reasonable... made-to-order
    Lunch - $20.95 (11:30am - 3pm)
    Dinner - $25.95 (3pm - 2am)
    
*Rules: 
    No Sharing
    You'll be charged for leftovers
    45 min for lunch/60min for dinner
    20% tip added to parties of 6 or more
    AYCE cannot be combined w/any promotion

2.  Funny cheeky names for sushi rolls... 
      - Screaming Orgasm 
      - Double D
      - Something Wrong #69
      - Burning Your Ass
*Wanna know the ingredients... come on by!

3.  Decor is modern, music isn't too loud (good for conversations), and drinks were constantly refilled. 

** All in all... 
Reasonable AYCE price!
My favorite thing all night... the oyster on the half, ama ebi (fried head) and Korean ice cream sandwich.

Pass on no rice rolls (not sushi). And the pumpkin soup (pureed).",m4yg8dyYg0WyqhYlDpzhew,13,10,4,AK3FCbYmSgQsbyduHkLqWQ
2450471,2016-01-23,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"A couple of initial warnings, after this, everything is else was good...

1.) nobody in your party can order AYCE at hibachi tables. This was a bummer because I wanted AYCE and my boyfriend wanted hibachi so I was forced to order my sushi a la carte.

2.) they charge extra to share one hibachi order, I guess cleaning 1 extra plate is $5-$6

3.) hibachi is 2+ main items, no option to do 1 main item unless you have a child under 12. This is unfortunate to those of us adults who don't prefer hefty portions.

After that, the hibachi flavors were WONDERFUL, well worth the annoyance just to get to this point. Service was on point as well. Just be prepared before you go or the restrictions may leave a sour taste about the restaurant.",HSaR700HhNQKj7uXcOqCwA,0,0,4,x8ennZDc9LNXcttPCZ2ucA

The portions are perfectly small for sampling lots of dishes.  Pumpkin soup is a nice change from miso.  The ginkgo nuts are buttery, garlicky delicious.

Our server was so sweet and I'm sure we all have our days that we forget things but when I notice the bartender standing directly behind our table talking with her regulars or friends rather then making the drink I ordered makes this dining experience a fail.
I would think that the server would take the initiative to ask the bartender to make her tables drinks. 
We finished our food and I told the server to just forget the drink since she said it was still ""on the way"".
Once our check came to the table the bartender that was talking directly behind our table had finally returned to the bar and was making her friends their bloody Mary's.... The sushi was good but not good enough to overlook the lack of service.  We ordered a couple different rolls and most of them seemed to contain the same ingredients and all were doused in eel sauce which gives me the impression that the rolls taste the same.

Now, without spending the money for quality sashimi or nigiri, JJANGA is an affordable AYCE establishment.  This place will offer an elaborate menu for every palate (even offering Hibachi), unfortunately the service is sub par and lacks a welcoming ambience. Maybe it's partially due to the foot traffic or the idea that it is AYCE, JJANGA packs a punch for hungry patrons who enjoy rolls dressed in cream, but falls short on service as a sushi institution.",a97qgQgrqZ9D_O5G3czUCA,0,0,3,a90O27uKtKYlSWhgP46RKQ

The waitress that (I really need to catch her name) is always there is AMAZING. Next time we go in I'll update with her name. For NYE the people across the hibachi table from us bought us a couple rounds of shots. Such a fun night. As to not exclude my daughter the waitress brought over a shot glass with club soda and a gummy bear in it. My daughter is 2.5 so she thought the miniature glass with a candy in the bottom  was so much fun!! The chefs always make sure she gets her own little plate with things cut up appropriately and the waitress brings her an ice cream bar at the end of dinner. It's about the only time we let her have ice cream. The atmosphere is super upbeat, friendly and fun. The food is OUTSTANDING as well. I can't say enough good about the sushi or the hibachi table. We are so happy to have found a new sushi place that is a locals spot. Our old one sold to a new owner and was horrible after.

2741485,2016-09-11,3,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"JJanga used to be really awesome. The quality, service, and the overall feel was always great. However, the past 3 times I have been here have proved that otherwise. 

I bring a lot of business whenever I come here. I always bring a party of 8+ on a frequent basis due to me bringing friends from out of town or workmates to enjoy good sushi. However, the past few times they would either ignore us or give me backlash on why they can't do certain things. 

I ordered salmon belly but won't bring it out. When 30 minutes pass and I ask about the order you tell me that it's too big of an order and that they need to save some for other people... Uh hello? We have a party of 10... I asked for 10 orders. Are you telling me you guys are cheaping out and not wanting to bring an order for per person to the table? Whatever, I let that one pass. 

What I can't let pass is when you start yelling in Korean about how much belly is left to your chefs. You hesitated in telling me what they said, probably because you figured out I also speak Korean, don't try to be shady. On top of that you tell us that our free AYCE card can't be applied until the next visit... Uh I only had 2 more spaces left with a party of 10. How does that make sense? Holy crap, us Koreans are cheap, buts that just straight dookie. 

Last time I came, service was non existent. I get it when your busy service will get slow, but I came in during late lunch and there was only 2 other tables... I had to wave my bill for 5 minutes at the girls face for her to come and get it, only because I had to wait 15 minutes. Do you not want to get paid?

2767099,2017-08-21,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Haven't had sushi in a long time so my roommate and I decided to get AYCE sushi at Jjanga since it is near our house. 

I usually start my AYCE sushi experiences with appetizers and move onto the rolls/nigiri. My go to appetizers are Baked Green Mussels, Shrimp Tempura, Calamari, and their Soy Chicken Wings. Not used to having chicken wings at a sushi place, but their soy wings were pretty good.

Moving onto sushi, I got a Monkey Burrito, Spider Roll, Tiger Roll, Taste My Ex-Girlfriend Roll, as well as a bunch of Nigiri. I like the rice to fish ratio here as it isn't too heavy on the rice side. 

Once our sushi capacity was hit, it was time for dessert. Always room for dessert no matter what. I got the green tea ice cream and mango mochi ice cream. Mochi ice cream is comparable to everyone. The green tea ice cream only had a hint of green tea flavor and mainly tasted like cream.

The service here was great with orders coming out quick. But I felt like our server barely touched base with us compared to other places I've been to.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,2,0,4,zlQfNToGdXaBxyNnm307EQ
2767577,2017-10-04,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Came here when there were barely any customers. 'Barely any customers' meaning a few people at the bar and one party of 2 people in the whole restaurant. I was with 4 of my friends and 2 kids. Took like 5 minutes to get seated. We ordered drinks right away and took a few minutes to look over the menu.. it felt like our server (he never told us his name.. he was white and had earrings) took a long to come back and take our order. Which I did not understand at all since it wasn't even busy at the moment.. we all ordered a couple things and did a split bill.

So here we are, hanging out and talking while waiting on our food.. and the longer we waited we are all realizing that food is taking forever to come out. Like.. 45 mins waiting and so far we got all of our sushi rolls, which were made very sloppy.. and sushi burritos. An hour pass by and we still have not received the 3 sushi burgers, and our other small plates.. teriyaki chicken, KFC, fried rice, and fries. Our server never really came to check up on us like they would normally do in other places. We had to find somebody and stop them to ask about the rest of our orders because it was taking forever. Then after asking that person, our server came by and we also stopped and asked him about it too. It was insane how long it took them to get the rest of our orders out. Eventually we did end up getting all our food. But the wait killed it for us.

Food was OK. Not worth a long wait. Not sure how it is when they're busy but hopefully they aren't as slow as they were today lol.

Also, when we were ready to leave, our server yet again never came around to give us our check.. by how empty our plates were, you'd think somebody would be by to clear up the table and our server would come by and try to do his job.. Instead, he decided to go on a break. We all saw our server sitting at the bar laughing and talking with his friends. Didn't care to mention he would be going on a break to our table. So here we are again, looking for somebody working there to ask for our check.. I asked another server who just happened to be helping a new group of people who just walked in and he seriously asked me and my friends what we all ordered in order to get our checks. That is ridiculous. I told him that his coworker should already have our orders. So he went to the computer and printed our checks. We waited a little while hoping for that server to come back and process our payments since our own server was still sitting at the bar.. but it seemed like he just kept walking to the back room all the time. So I got up out of my chair because we were sick of the long wait and I went to see Susan who was the only employee nearby (I only know her name because it was on our receipt, I wish it had our real servers name on it though). She was really nice and apologized that we had to wait so long. Thank you, Susan.

We originally went in for sushi burgers with friends, but hubby was the only one who didn't get burger and got regular sushi. I got the Karai (sorry misspelled?) sushi burger with the planko crusted rice. Wow!!!!! So I was very skeptical about trying a sushi burger, I was not disappointed. The only down side really is the size. It's huge and kind of hard to eat. Eating some of the fish and veggies with a chopstick first and then pressing the burger down a little seemed to help. Either way I am definitely going to be back to try the others! 

My husband didn't like his sushi, it was falling apart. He got the Johnny Roll which every single piece fell apart. This is the cucumber wrapped roll with crab and shrimp tempura inside. Really good flavor, terrible presentation. The other roll he got I can't remember the name. Same thing, fell completely apart. 

Service this time was the worst we have ever received. I mean I made eye contact and tried to flag the server down more than 5 times. He didn't once come check on us until maybe 10 minutes AFTER we ate our food. He didn't even bring it to us someone else did, he didn't even offer refills or anything like that. Our waiter was nowhere to be found while even though during a busy time the customers around us seemed to be getting faster and way friendly customer service. They were actually acknowledged. It took me over 15 min to order the second roll and it ended up being with a different server.

The 5 of us ended up sitting at our table without food for 30 minutes at a time trying to make small talk while we continuously waited on our food. When they did bring us our order it was half of what we ordered and they acted as if they didn't remember the rest. Maybe they are trying to save on food cost - which was a legitimate question asked by everyone in our party. The good news is, if you want alcohol they will bring that RIGHT away!

John was super kind and created a show as well as a wonderful dinner. I would definitely request him next time I go. 

We ordered the jjanga special as well as the two item entree. The shrimp cracker appetizer (which kind of tasted like crab) was super yummy and was a great start to the dinner. Wasn't a big fan of the salad but the soup was unique and yummy! For the entree we had shrimp, lobster, filet, and chicken. What I like was that if you paid $9.99 extra, you could get an extra order of soup, salad, rice, and noodles and then share the entrees.

It's usually always steady and the servers are always attentive. We rarely ever have to wait long for the food we order and they never mess up. Which unfortunately happens to us almost every time we venture to a new sushi place. 

They offer half rolls at the bar, and my favorite part is the deserts. AYCE ice cream come included, which is awesome considering everywhere else we go they give you one tiny scoop of ice cream and you leave with your sweet tooth completely not satisfied. 

Their cuts of nigiri are rather small, but so fresh tasting and the flavors are on point. Which is big for us because it is 90% of what we eat when doing AYCE, besides, is size really that important when it's AYCE? 

The rolls I've only had a few of, but they've never disappointed. 

The music is your typical K-Pop mixed with modern day Kesha/EDM type, they also offer Karaoke in the room next door along with teppanyaki.

My sister and I came in and there was only one other person dining. We had no idea what we wanted so just randomly picked rolls with names that appealed to us. 
Everything was just an okay type of good. I've had sushi with eel sauce and once you have sushi with eel sauce, you cannot go back. 
Well I noticed something when our rolls started to come in, they all had just about the same presentation and the same ingredients. Therefore, three of my different plates of rolls tasted pretty much the same and was on the dry side :-(

When we ordered dessert, the server tells us that they ran out of green tea ice cream so the only ice cream they did have was chocolate. Man, I'm disappointed to even be recommended chocolate ice cream. 
Our experience at this location was underwhelming. I might give it another try soon but that soon could be delayed by other AYCE establishments.",C_CqWSkpn2aOnUXtHx0-iw,11,11,3,UvA9Qz536PdXKQglJ8AD7g

The sushi didn't taste very fresh and everything seemed to be doused in a mayonnaise based sauce. I'm not saying I've never enjoyed a little spicy mayo drizzled on the top of sushi before but in this instance it was always way too much sauce and it overpowered the taste of the sushi. One of the rolls we got came with a bright pink ""ginger"" sauce that didn't really taste like ginger. It tasted more like sour cream and the unnatural pink color was super off-putting. It just made me think that the quality of the fish wasn't that great in the first place and they are trying to overcompensate by covering the taste up with something more palatable. Or maybe they're just trying to appeal to people who aren't adventurous eaters..? Whatever the case, it wasn't quality sushi. One thing I liked was a piece of sushi that had steak on it instead of fish..but that's not what i go to a sushi restaurant for; I go for the fish. The service also seemed to be lacking that night. Our waitress didn't seem like she knew English very well, which I really don't care about but my boyfriend was in the middle of asking her a question and she just turned around and walked away. I just moved to Vegas from San Diego, so I might be a bit spoiled when it comes to seafood in general but with all the great reviews this place has on yelp I was really expecting it to be better.",MQnpouUfsn9_0ltOhka3Bg,0,0,2,Oonai9lBRnEVu534piQ3pQ

Was excited for the sushi burger & sushi burritos I saw on Facebook videos! Came specifically for that. Ordered Jjanga Burger & Monkey Burrito, and my friend ordered the Karai Burger & uni sushi.

Jjanga Burger: Way too saucy and the regular rice bun totally fell apart. Was basically just spicy tuna, spicy mayo, and saucy seaweed salad with a ton of white rice. The seasoning on the bun was really good though!

Monkey Burrito: Preferred this over the Burger - compact and easy to hold and eat! Would've liked some more veggies or something in there, but not bad overall.

Karai Burger: One-time thing, wouldn't get it again. Would rather get a regular roll. Too much rice. 

Uni sushi: 2 pieces. The best part of his meal because it was fresh and tasty.

But putting the service apart and taking a close look at their food, I really like their no write sushi options and all you can eat deal. You can't go wrong with all you can eat if you are that hungry.

Thanks to their commitment to build a better restaurant,  is they have acquired their alcohol license, allowing customers to enjoy a crash Sake, or a Japanese beer while dining there.

We got to meet the owner JJANGA & he was also one of the sushi chefs! All the staff was very friendly & all very helpful. All of the sushi that we ordered came out very quickly and although they were out of UNI then I guess it just shows how fresh things are. Becuase they also ended up running out of halibut as well ahahha
They definately accommodated us well becuase they allowed us to order more beef tataki  in place of the uni.

The only concern was the hot foods came out a little bit warm rather than hott but we assume those are just some kinks that will be worked out in the future

The ambience and decor was nice , bright, and clean.  There are plenty of seating options from regular tables, a bar , sushi bar and hibachi bar. 

It was my first time having sushi and my girlfriends and I opted for the AYCE for 21 bucks. We had 3 apps which included the edamame, shrimp tempura, and pot stickers. The tempura had a nice, light yet crunchy batter. Satisfying 2 bites. Next time I think I would skip the apps and just stick with the sushi but it's nice to have choices. The menu had a wide variety of choices, including non spicy items. I like spicy but if you are dining with friends who don't it is a great option 

Onto to the sushi. My friends ordered the spider wrap, a dragon roll and the crunch wrap. I've never tried eel before bit have to say the dragon roll was one of my favorites. Nice flavors and I love the little bit of crunch the cucumber added. The crab in the spider was a wee bit fishy for me but I am not a big seafood eater. We ordered a few more items including the three way which had cream cheese, tuna, with a crunchy tempura topping. Delish!
Once I had tried a few things I felt confident enough to order and I went with sexy times. 
It had crunchy rice on the bottom topped by tuna, jalapeño, sriracha sauce and had drizzled spicy mayo and eel sauce on the plate. This was my número uno. Loved the textures and flavor explosions. 

The service was excellent. I didn't catch the gal's name at the sushi bar but she was very patient with me and kept asking if we wanted to order anything else. 

All in all a terrific experience popping my sushi cherry. Would go back in a heartbeat.",W_HwGW3zoda31p1FmlcgbA,2,2,4,zdbUE8QaFa7qjxQV7zLkGQ

I personally love the yuzu yellowtail (omg such a refreshing taste) and the garlic tuna which, unlike other places, doesn't have a big wad of garlic on top of it but rather seems to infuse the garlic flavor into the sauce that they put on top and it's fantastic. Tons of garlic flavor but it doesnt get stuck in your teeth lol. 

The service is great, all the staff i've encountered have been friendly and they're always on their feet keeping busy. WHICH IS WHY i've been able to overlook the fact that i feel service is kind of slow. Not unbearably slow.. but slower i feel than other sushi places. 

Still, the service is great, restaurant and restroom clean, and the sushi is delicious. I'll keep coming back. And do yourself a favor and order the hot salmon skin hand roll.

So we went to try it out. They sat us by the sushi bar. The table and chairs are made of food. The seats have no cushion. So after a few minutes of sitting down your butt starts  to hurt. Very uncomfortable. The chairs are dark and light color. The dark color is because they are dirty. There was a guy cleaning the backs of the benches while people were eating at surrounding tables. Cant they clean after hours? Not very pleasant to know. What else is dirty in this place. We got all you can eat. The fish behind  the sushi bar in the glass case. The more I looked at it. It didn't look to fresh. There was some bottle of medicine on top of the sushi bar, along with a pill bottle on the back wall in plain sight. There were to wood decor boats on top of the sushi bar. They were full of dust. While we were eating the sushi, it tasted pretty good. But I should say they put tons of rice and hardly any sushi. Once we left my wife and I both statutes to get stomach pains. Almost like as if they use msg or something. I usually eat a lot more sushi when we go to other all you can eat sushi places. So maybe they do use msg or something. I will never go here again. Take in note the place looks nice when you first go in. And we excited to eat here. I wasn't going to right a review.

3397245,2017-03-03,11,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"I have to give credit where credit is due - positive changes in the service & improved quality in sushi inspired an updated review. 

The fella talked me into giving them a try again, since he always had good hibachi. I was hesitant, wanting AYCE sushi, and had terrible sushi the last couple of visits.

The one downside we found out upon walking in, is that I couldn't do AYCE sushi on the hibachi side- and the fella can't have hibachi at the grill on the sushi side -so minus a star before being seated. Once seated, service was great; refills on point, no asking again & again for things or wondering where dishes were, all much improved from times before.

Sushi side: I tried the yuzu yellowtail, the veggie screaming ""o"" salad and the Burning Your Ass Roll promising spice. My mind has been changed on their sushi- tasty and fresh all around. Good spice and textures on the roll - getting that one AGAIN. The salad was a little clunky and over-dressed, maybe a squeeze of lemon or chopped tomatoes to cut the richness would have made it perfect. All-in-all I am looking forward to coming in for AYCE sushi for another try.

As usual, a good hibachi experience... actually, the our food off the grill was better than before - they used a different butter/oil that was not the pink-ish one they used to use, and the result was a very tasty mix of veggies, noodles, medium rare filet steak and DELISH rice... really good rice!

There's a little work needed to strive for gold, but I give my most recent experience here a solid silver and much improved.",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,21,18,4,2T91kmBW37QGmaqQyye2rg

The first thing that won me over was that we were able to get 3x the rice since we didn't want the noodles or the vegetables. Other places, you would only get extra rice and not extra EXTRA rice. And the rice was delicious! It's even better than our usual place. I got the filet and shrimp. John cooked my medium rare filet perfectly. He also made us a special sauce that was amazing! On top of that, John had us try a different way he cooked the chicken with the yum yum sauce and I can't wait to order that next.

The food was amazing but the service was even better. John was hilarious and made it a point to actually talk to us and tell us stories. We were in a group with another family and by the end of the dinner, we were all talking like we had all gone to dinner together. And that was because of John. While we sat there talking after dinner, one of the ladies offered us a green tea shot on the house. That was so nice of them to do especially since the shot was so delicious!

Pictures of the salmon burger showed more salmon in it, but when I got mine, it seem like I had a spicy tuna burger.  The salmon was in the burger but I found it in the middle.

At around $27 for their AYCE, their rolls seemed to be more tasteful than what we were used to. Plentiful and quick, we quickly gobbled the deliciousness. What I liked better here than the other was the selection seemed to be more and quality was better. 

Establisment was clean and servers were great.

3592447,2015-02-27,4,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Listen, In a town with literally hundreds of sushi bars, most AYCE places have become a joke in the past few years. Some places pre-cut their fish so they can serve people faster, all this does is accelerate the oxidation process and ruin the taste of the fish. Other places let their fish sit for WAY TOO LONG, you can almost smell it when you walk in.

This is why JJanga has been such a reFRESHing (and I mean FRESH) addition to the Vegas AYCE Sushi scene. Their original location is still a weekly trip for me, but now they have opened a second location in the Bishop Gorman area (maybe Snoop Dogg likes sushi?).

And I'm here to tell you - this new location rocks!

Some of their best chefs make the Fort Apache location their regular gig. 

There's Sponge (she's a big fan of the Squarepants) and she is always ready to amaze with some very creative concoctions. My recommendation, let Sponge go wild,  take the cuffs off and let her pick, she will create dish after dish of amazing fish that will rock your world - I do and she has never let me down.

While all the ""remember the good ole days?"" sushi bars across the valley continue to serve bad fish, bad service and bad attitudes, JJanga has stepped up and said ""Hey! Happy Days Are Here Again! ...""

When you see me there, toss me a hello.

Everything is incredible and I love the details -- such as their nigiri rice, it is drizzled with a tasty and lemony sauce. This really made my night. I am not much of a rice eater and this left  a rather wonderful impression on me. 

The great thing about this place is that they do not fill you up with rice or large plates for AYCE menu. First of all, nothing is ""off the menu"", you can order everything, some items you can only order once though. Every order came in twos (there were two of us, so one for each) and very small portions served for items such as the Special Sashmi mixes. This was really great because we were able to eat a ton of different items. 

All fish was incredibly fresh. The hamachi was probably the best I've had in the city so far, tuna would disintegrate as soon as it hits the tongue and the grilled pike mackerel was so insanely fresh. 

I mean everything was amazing... the sweet shrimp, gyoza, garlic tuna, bulgogi, cheese ceoquettes, mushroom balls, oysters,umi. mochi... the list goes on. Just o get some.

What brought me to Jjanga first was the sushi burgers. I order mine tempura style take off one bun and eat it open faced with jalapeños on top. Do what I do, it's delicious. 
On our 4th visit we decided to do the AYCE option for lunch at $20 pp. This time we were with our newborn son with stroller in tow the hostess/manager wanted to seat us directly in the aisle, when we asked for another table she said those are for larger parties. We eventually asked to be seated at a booth and to have the outside chairs removed so we we could put the stroller on that side of the table while I sat on the end. The restaurant is big but the sushi area is quite small, if they allowed us to sit at a hibachi table that may free up some space. Anyway I digress the rolls were ok, some of the rolls are the same as my favorite sushi place and even though it was the same ingredients theirs didn't quite stack up but it was good enough to keep us coming back as it's close to our new home.

We had a party of six, and all prefer to eat light because of our diet. We decided to get three meals that included four items each. For those of you who do not know each item counts as 3 ounces worth of meat, at least that is what we were told. So we were to get 36 ounces of meat with this combination. We also could have opted to get four meals with three items each and it would have yielded the exact same amount of meat.

What the waitress did not tell us is that she would be charging us ""Sharing charges"" for each person that did not receive a full meal. We told her that we did not all need soup and salad and she said that she could waive the sharing fees because of that. But when the check came, there were two sharing fees on it. I asked about this fee, and she explained the reason that they had to put them on there, but we did not all receive our soup and salad. After a little bit of arguing back-and-forth, the waitress said that she would take off one more sharing fee but would still charge for one sharing fee.

They didn't ask for my friend's order and didn't really make eye contact. Usually when I order sushi, everyone is attentive and checks back to see if anything else is needed. I felt like I placed my order three times. It was just confusing. 

The Japanese Lasagna was good and not too cheesy/ filling like some I have had. I also liked the white fish / nigiri. I got a crunchy roll and that one I didn't like. 

There was a woman there with two kids. The boy was running around the table with squeaky shoes and it was pretty loud and annoying.

One difference here is that they are primarily Korean so in addition to the sushi, they also feature many Korean dishes like KFC, pumpkin soup, and bulgogi, amongst others. Their sushi is great, but the biggest downside of Jjanga is their ratio of rice. In fact, if you're doing AYCE, don't even bother getting the sushi burritos, as the one I got was 80% or more of rice. 

Rice ratios aside, I did enjoy many of their specials including the salmon belly, uni, oyster (Korean style), and golden scallop.

3884012,2015-08-05,3,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"I heard very good things about this sushi place but unfortunately after trying it myself, I wasn't a fan :( 

A couple friends and I tried their All You Can Eat Sushi. 

Positive
- The restaurant location is in a nice area in Las Vegas
- The chocolate ice cream was from Thrifty and it was very yummy. 
- Johnny Roll - delicious 

Negative (reason for my 1 star)
- Seating was not great, we sat on these hard boxes. Very difficulty getting in and getting out. 
- Services was not great, service kept forgetting our order & we had to reminder her a couple of times. 
- Make sure you child does not read the sushi menu, they have some non kid friendly names on them. Example: Crazy Ass, Sexy Time, Tree Some Special, I love my Ass, Burning your Ass & Taste like my X girlfriend. 
- I do not recommend the following 
*Baked Salmon Roll - very dry & no flavor 
*Udon soup - smells & tasted too fishy 
*Tree Some Special - way too much cream cheese
*W07 - Not a fan of the ginger sauce 
*Sun Devil - over deep fried 
*Baked Mussel - Not good a all 

I did hear they have 2 locations so maybe I'll try the other location one day.",JMU4hmWtKJ_fYnDgS_RFag,2,0,1,cm4ZIMflACMSX2KuomZCPw

They split the restaurant in a sushi side and a hibachi side, which leaves the sushi side kind of cramped. My aunt asked to be moved because she felt uncomfortable, but they told us no despite the fact the table she wanted was the original one they were going to give us. They didn't give it to us because we decreased our party from 8 to 6. The service was very inattentive. It was really hard to order when we were ready. 

The one reason I loved the original location was because they had a solid sushi to rice ratio on their nigiri. But they load the nigiri here with so much rice, which is a huge turn off. I would honestly drive a little extra to visit their other location.",ERcsc0YO5CCUbkC8EV2INg,2,0,2,U4RMEXpuLjy4Dxq5WX8oHw

The only catch is they have to use a clean knife and cutting board, so I always let them know when I order and order my rolls all at once in the beginning so I'm out of the way. This time they said they couldn't wash a knife and cutting board for me so they couldn't serve me. I explained we have been coming here for years frequently and it has never a problem. They said they were sorry but the chef wouldn't serve me. I'm also 5 months pregnant, so despite the allergy I couldn't risk cross contamination due to food poisoning risk to the baby. So if you are vegetarian or vegan, that means you will have fish on your veggie rolls too since they won't clean between making other types of rolls. Unfortunately we can never go back.

This establishment is great for all occasions, from family dining and date nights, to sushi and drinks with a group of friends (btw they offer pitchers of beer). Also a huge highlight of this place is the owner Jjanga, he has to be one of the most interactive owners I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, he treats guests like family and is often one of the chefs making your sushi, and from my experiences he also has an amazing staff, it seems they got it together and work as a Team, they are all very attentive and eager to please their guests. This place has fine dining type service at a competitive AYCE price, I highly recommend this place to everyone.

I'm so accustomed to this city being flooded with overpriced cuisine that focuses even more on presentation than they do the taste of their food.

Jjanga has a great balance of both. And just a warning, their other location does not have their sushi burgers/sandwiches! We went there first but then left quickly to check out this location.

The restaurant is pretty spacious, and the variety on the menu is vast. I had seen their sushi burgers/sandwiches on Instagram, and couldn't wait to give them a try. Heck with my vegetarianism! I'm flexible for special occasions. 

I got their main Jjanga sushi sandwich with panko crumbs, which I can't seem to find on any of their online menus. It was fantastic! However, I didn't realize that having the panko crumbs meant it would be fried - well duh! It was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and it was huge for just $9 I believe. I could only finish half, but finished the rest that night for dinner. 

We also enjoyed some sake bombs, and my husband loved all the various rolls he ordered. Next time we come to Vegas, this will be our first stop for food.",fquTEV93jh82JYob6u0CEA,0,0,5,RnXWkRvVwuINZjSo0n00qQ

3967302,2018-06-25,2,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"A group of us met here for teppanyaki.  This was one of the best times I've had in a restaurant in a long time. Of course, in most restaurants, we wouldn't be laughing, calling to each other, have a chef toss fresh eggs with a spatula, and just plain have a lot of noisy fun.

I ordered the basic dinner with the add ons of lobster and filet. We all got soup, a salad, and then watched as our well trained, very experienced, and very funny chef did his magic cooking noodles, fried rice, doing the almost required flaming onion tower, and then cooking the proteins.

I had asked for my filet to be extra rare and that's the way it was. The meat was very tender and tasty and the lobster was very flavorful. My soda was refilled often and service was excellent. 

As must be the case with teppanyaki, a chef who is a ham as well as being proficient is a must and ours was! He had a great personality, was full of life, made a lot of silly jokes, made us all laugh, and cooked things exactly as we ordered. Getting the steaks cooked the correct way was a fine accomplishment. Periodically, Jjanga would stop by and ham it up with our table. He's a fun person and a very personable guy!

We had been here a couple of times when it was Kanji then once when they switched right in the beginning and wasn't impressed then, but took another chance seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews, which, I assure you is unfounded. It isn't the worst sushi joint that we've eaten at, but I would be hard pressed to say that it isn't pretty close to the bottom and we could never recommended it. Now on to the food...I usually try to find something positive to write in my reviews but I'm having a hard time coming up with anything. The only thing that was liked at the table was the seaweed salad, which I'm pretty sure they buy already prepared and a couple of the appetizers (Bulgogi and Shrimp Tempura). The rolls were small with paper thin stamp sized cuts of fish and unfortunately with most of them over powered with sauce. They have plenty of staff and all were very friendly except they all circle around the dining room like hawks waiting to pounce, felt like I was in prison being examined every couple of minutes. Don't get me wrong, I love an attentive wait staff, but not so much that they smoother you. The sushi chefs failed to impress in presentation of both the food and themselves, all being dressed in street clothes wearing backwards baseball caps, looking very disheveled and very young. Age and training could be the culprit here on the lackluster food as well as the constant hovering with the wait staff. At the conclusion of dinner with a small bowl of ice cream the the most disappointing part of the evening came to be...the check.

Show them you left a review and they will give you a free premium dessert.  This is an ayce sushi place that taste like an ayce place.   There are better places nearby like sushi koma.

They do all you can eat, but I came here to try their fabled new ""Sushi Burger"" which unfortunately is not part of the all you can eat menu.

The first thing we noticed was the great music. Classics like Sinatra and the Beach Boys.

We ordered the Jjanga Burger, the Bulgolgi Burger, and the Unagi Burger.
We went with the panko encrusted rice buns which I believe was a mistake. The buns were hard, and not easy to eat. Next time I would go with the regular rice bun.

The kicker was the service. Not terribly busy but definitely a healthy amount of patrons, but our service was slow, unresponsive, we felt forgotten a few times, and the check was pushed on us without us asking for it which made us feel that we had to leave.

They did give us free ice cream which was very nice.",eLhTrUCkafMZUrbtqvB78g,1,1,3,_rzXhd26fA7nTnHkEjnKnw

They have a great selection but service and wait times were well below average given there were only a few other tables of 2 present during dinner. 

The two stars are for their variety and flavor. A few of their special rolls were delicious but almost every item was poorly constructed. It almost seemed like sushi rice wasn't used. All rolls and Nigiri fell apart as soon as they were lifted off the plate. 

I know that all new businesses go through their growing pains so I'm hoping quality will be addressed. I may try them out again in a few months with hopes of improvement",OLBFrzQV9WfkrxYGGI1E-Q,0,0,2,qa9QeSe6GENfWnjyy_oJrw

Service was excellent but then again we were one of two tables at the sushi area. They are definitely kid friendly which helps when you have a 2 year old in tow. They even had a treasure box of kid toys that she could choose from! 

Sushi wise it was good but not the best. Of course it's AYCE so you can't expect the best quality but the quality was ok. It wasn't the freshest but it wasn't the worst. There's a huge variety of rolls and appetizers and they were pretty quick at getting out our orders. The rice to fish ratio was standard and the rolls weren't over sauced. 

Overall, I would come back for the convenience factor and the service. It's not going to be the best sushi ever but it is fairly good. They have teppanyaki as well if you rather not have raw fish.

There was no reason why the service would be so slow, but it was. They had one server and a manager looking lady and two chefs at the bar. We ordered miso soup and pumpkin soups and some appetizers to start off. Despite their empty restaurant, the foods came out cold and very late. When the nigiris came out, there was so much rice that we could not dare to start eating. We definitely did not eat all the rice and did not care if they charged us or not. The server said ""oh really?"" When we said the foods were cold, did not take any action about it or apologize. The nigiris were definitely tasteless since the fish was cut so thin and small. 

When this place first opened, it was top notch, being rated the number 1 sushi bar in town. Couple years later, this place definitely cannot catch up the trend of new sushi restaurants like Neko or Sakana.

The rice that they use for their nigiri sushi was not seasoned. It was just plain white rice with no flavoring. I was a bit shocked. Also, the quality of the fish were not that great compared to my other go-to AYCE sushi place. I didn't get too many rolls, maybe one at most, since I'd rather eat the nigiri's. I'm not a huge roll fan, so if the rolls here are amazing, maybe this place is legit than I realize. 

I appreciate their wide selection of other food items they offer; however, all the other items were mediocre at best. The crab ball was the only thing that I liked, and probably ordered multiple times.

If one or both is not stellar than the finished product will suffer greatly.  We tried a variety of sushi and rolls, all of which were not well executed.  The rice was falling apart at the slightest touch!  The fish was ok, nothing special.  However the oysters were exceptional!  We had those first and thought we had found a real gem, but sadly when the rest of our sushi arrived it was seriously lacking in quality preparation and execution.

My boyfriend and I did a la carte our first time eating here, and the total came out to $50, so we figured eh we should just do AYCE next time since we're spending the same amount.

The interior of the restaurant is very spacious, clean, and modern. The have an area for either Sushi or Hibachi (like Benihana style). I have yet to try their Hibachi menu - however, what I really appreciate about their sushi menu is the addition of new and exclusive items. I was tired of seeing the same items at every, single sushi restaurant like the Hawaiian roll, Vegas roll, etc etc. This place actually had brand new, creative concoctions!

I HIGHLY recommend the Sponge Special Sushi Roll. It is a tempura roll with so much fresh goodness and looks like a sushi masterpiece.

Best service of any sushi restaurant in town! The hosts and staff go out of their way to accommodate with a smile and great attitude. There is a sushi section and teppanyaki/hibachi section.
Atmosphere: High Energy club-like vibe
ALL YOU CAN EAT. This is the only way we do sushi...why limit yourself to a la carte when you can unlock the entire menu for $25.95 (dinner 3pm-2am) or $20.95 (lunch 11:30-3pm)
Get a carafe of GRAPEFRUIT INFUSED SAKE to share, you might even want 2. Refreshing, cold with citrus accents and the perfect way to start your night or compliment your sushi.
Sushi: our friend said it best when describing the freshness...""I know it's fresh when you can't tell the kind of fish, it just melts in your mouth."" That is how good Jjanga's sushi is.
FAVORITES: Something Special: calamari tempura, crab wrapped in cucumber topped with eel sauce. Light and doesn't fill you up with rice.
Ask for RAYU sauce...sesame, chili infused oil...dip everything in it...especially the Garlic Tuna. You're welcome.
The Cheese Croquettes are a must try. Crispy warm fried cheese topped with a creamy sauce. Don't knock it til you try it...it surprised us.
Something Wrong 69: A roll where one side starts with salmon and ends on tuna with shrimp tempura on both ends.
Did I mention the RAYU sauce? Love that stuff.
Oysters: fresh and perfect for shooting. (Limit one per AYCE guest)
Screaming Orgasm: delicious but needed more sauce. (Limit one per AYCE guest)
Bulgogi : this is the only sushi place that I know who has sizzling Bulgogi on a fajita plate...awesome!

Got here @ 305pm.  It was too late for the lunch :( but thats okay! We did the AYCE for $25.  Its a decent price for the quality of the food.  

We ordered from the different categories.  My favorites were the yuzu yellow tail, shrimp tempura, lemon pepper wings, and the monkey burrito.  The yuzu yellow tail was more of a palate cleanser for me because it was refreshing on the palate.  The lemon pepper wings were really crispy and just tasted so good.  I got the monkey burrito with no crab because im not a fan of imitation crab.  It was so good! I love the soy paper!!! It includes rice, daikon, tempura, and spicy tuna.  So crunchy!!! 

At the end, if you do a yelp review you get a free dessert.  They ran out of the ice cream sandwich so they gave us melona.  The ayce also includes ice cream AND mochi ice cream.  Green tea ice cream is the way to go!!!!",SyX94Qkpowm_9dsn1SDrCQ,0,0,4,UYMnRzYgFrYPUTtcJO4FeA

4533447,2016-08-16,15,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"This review is way long overdue. I have gotten my friend Liza R. to become a regular with me here. :D Yesterday we were at the sushi bar. The special hand rolls are the way to go! We came for AYCE lunch just so we could eat some Monkey Burritos! They are under the Special Hand Rolls section of the menu, and are easy to overlook with all the other choices on the menu. Don't overlook these!!! 

We tried one of each of the special hand rolls, and the Lissa hand roll was pretty good. The Monkey Burrito is by far my favorite. I think it is a combo of the delicious soy paper and the sauce they serve on the plate. Mmmmm! It is served as two pieces, and they are the perfect serving size.

Of course I always order some yellowtail, so we had some Yuzu Yellowtail nigiri and hamachi. The Something Wrong 69 is a good roll.. very filling! There is a roll that is mostly yellowtail and it is amazing. The mussels are our favorite appetizer.

The service is sometimes hit or miss. We were only drinking water and it was not busy when we were here, so we didn't have any service issues. The sushi chef was a female, and she is very attentive and fast. 

The prices for both lunch and dinner AYCE are very reasonable. You can get a lot for your money here. It has a very clubby vibe and is a bit loud...very fun and energetic!",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,23,22,5,mrE5I-cvv1DGa1W-nIdd0Q
4549620,2017-10-02,1,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"After our outing, me and my friends decided to hit the town for lunch, we packed the kids and headed here for some sushi!  I love that this location is close by other businesses and not too far from the park.  After reviewing the menu, We decided on eating Acyer for Sushi, and side dishes for the Lil  picky eater!  Love that they have an  All You Can Eat option- which included other items   (everything written in black) on the menu- ACYER, it's a bit pricey $20.95 for Lunch and $29.95 for dinner. I guess if you can eat a ton, than you can get your money's worth.
I was definitely not impressed with the food. But I think more disappointed in the service. Today they weren't even packed, but the service we were rendered, made it reflect as if it was a full house. They hardly came to check on our table, and when they did they took forever to bring out our food (as if was a method of us to getting full because our food had time to settle)... The server was terrible:  Ex. I ordered a water with no lemon because of my kiddo, and I am still currently waiting for that water. The lady who brought out our food mumbled and walked away quickly- so  we have no idea, who ordered what! 
I think the most disturbing and upsetting thing for my experience personally- is the fact that they charged a mandatory %20 service charge fo a table of 3 adults and 5 children?  I would have gladly tipped 20% or more if the service was spectacular.  But unfortunately it was no where that required percentage.  I have never been to any establishment that would do this, considering how the server didn't even attend to the 5 kids- getting drinks is requirement, -taking an order is an requirement, -serving the food is requirement.  Being ignored most of the experience, definitely not worth 3 adults each, tipping 20%
We should of known when we first arrived that the service was going to be terrible, it took more than 15mins to be seated in a non busy Time. The sad part the lady who was there before us got seated after us with her party of 2adults and 2 babies!  
I can't help but think because they were featured in Thrillst, they think they're establishment is special. Sorry the sushi burgers might be a thing, but not my thing! 
Definitely not coming back to a restaurant that is expensive (overpriced), terrible service, and a mandatory tip. Back in my day tips were optional and not forced at the highest percentage. I also want to know who the hell charges $2.00 for a tiny bowl of rice, and $5.00 for a small Bulgogi plate that comes with no rice! I can't get pass how the prices were, I just can't see myself coming back for more poor service and over priced items.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,3,1,3,Ac84f9EfWbVztcsujUhu0Q

Either way we still chowed down on some AYCE sushi. My favorite items were the garlic tuna nigiri, yuzu yellowtail nigiri, playboy special roll and the baked mussels. Out of everything I tasted it was all pretty tasty and came out super quickly. I was kinda disappointed to hear they didn't offer half rolls either which limited my stomach space for trying more of a variety. The options of rolls, apps and desserts was quite plentiful. There's definitely something there for everyone to enjoy. 

None the less this was still a good dining experience. I'd like to come back again to try the hibachi dinners.",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,4,2,4,C8ippYE4y5yfq8ldefgU9Q
4557762,2016-07-31,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Wow what a great experience from the second we walked in the door. The owner greeted us with open arms and led us with jokes and a smile into the sushi side of the restaurant (the other side is teppan) which was cleverly partitioned from its neighbor and so well decorated. It even had cool tongue-in-cheek giant photos of the sushi chefs with their nicknames. So fun!

We sit down at the table and opt for the all you can eat option (as we, especially for two small girls, can notoriously put away some food haha). I let my friend order as she is a pro and as usual, she did not disappoint. 

I will let my photos guide the experience for the most part, but my favorites were the uni, halibut, sweet shrimp, some more uni, steak bites, the YUZU YELLOWTAIL (amazing!!), beef tataki, BAKED GREEN MUSSELS, even more uni, and the tobiko... 

Okay i had a lot of favorites, but everything wad amazing and fresh and presented in a beautifully simple way. On top of that we had raw fresh wasabi (a first for me and 100% to die for), udon, garlic gingko nuts (couldn't stop eating it), tempura shrimp, gyoza, sake, and of course, green tea ice cream. 

I left at the end of it all in a blissful state of a euphoric ethereal food coma crossed with that feeling where you way up from an amazing vivid dream and for a second you don't recognize reality, know what time it is, and cant for the life of you figure out exactly where you are... And then it passes and you realize this is reality, you are you, and you are in your bedroom. And for the rest of the day you cant help but shake that feeling like some part of you is still there in that dream... You know what I mean? 

What i am trying to say is this: the place was awesome, the food was delicious, and for the rest of the day my reality was pleasantly infused with with the smell of the sea and a yearning for yuzu yellowtail. :)

So if you're a nigiri person, this is the place to go. Plus their specials behind the sushi bar are always phenomenal - like how often is salmon belly an option for AYCE?

The only downfall that I really have is that their appetizers are not great and when it was getting busy, the tempura in the rolls was not hot or crispy. We tried multiple appetizers but none of them were winners. It also took a while for some of them to come out and they weren't even great. I was really hoping to love their dynamite but I was disappointed. BUT the shrimp tempura as a appetizer was fresh AF - unlike the ones in the rolls.

I sometimes feel like having both or something and This place is the answer lol
Staff there are so nice and fun. Specially Jjanga himeself, I've known him for awhile now and he's really great Sushiman/Business man. He knows what he's doing.
I can't wait to see his 3rd Location...Hopefully somewhere in North or something lol
His staffs are really nice,kind,fun and friendly.

I love Ellen who works there too. She makes the best Gummy Bear Shots.
I enjoy her Shots all the time and if you like sweet drink..you HAVE to try her Gummy Bear Shots. Really fun to take the shots with Gummy bear inside and it is so yummy!
I love Jjanga's Old location too but I like the Second Location for Steak and Sushi. I'll say the Best AYCE Sushi place in Town! Must try!!!",oJaGizd-tV9_CEWGcKyukw,3,2,5,qNlMSfPTd6qrvbo_1nfeIw

They have an amazing selection of items from the all-you-can-eat menu. The service is phenomenal. Everyone there is friendly and the staff are personable, upbeat and are always offering great suggestions. You have to try the I love my Ass Roll, Q roll, Tuna Naruto, Freshman roll and the Yuzu yellowtail sushi. Oh, and you have to try the Grapefruit sake which is not on the all-you-can-eat obviously. Oh the beef Bulgogi, Gyoza and the crab balls are also a must try. The Fort Apache location closes at midnight and also has a Hibachi option and the Chinatown location I think closes around 2 AM and they also have Karaoke.

My boyfriend and I came to lunch here the other day and it was one of the worst sushi experiences I've had in a while. There was no hostess at the front when we walked in, so we stood around waiting for about 5 minutes (it was 12pm, not a weird time).

We were greeted by the hostess once she came out of the back somewhere and seated in the dining room. Our waiter was super nice and took our order promptly, but then got insanely busy-- he was the only server working and had over 10 tables at one point.

Needless to say this was a recipe for disaster. He forgot my salad, had to be asked 3x for lemons, and when we asked for our check we were held hostage while he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off tending to his other tables... forgetting to close us out.

Furthermore, the sushi was just not good. The tuna was very muscular, chewy and inedible. The spicy tuna roll was so spicy it was inedible (and that means a lot coming from me, I absolutely LOVE spicy). It was so spicy it left me wondering if they were trying to mask the flavor of old fishy fish or something.... anyhow, it didn't matter because the seaweed was so wet and gummy it was like chewing a fish flavored piece of gum with a ghost pepper wrapped in the middle.

My boyfriend had the salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and  tuna nigiri and he too said it was the worst sushi he's had in Vegas. The only reason I'm affording this place 2 stars is because I felt so sorry for the server. I mean, it's not his fault the restaurant was understaffed.

The service is wonderful! We are always greeted with enthusiasm and a smile and it stays that way throughout the night. 

Originally, we decided to try to place on the fact that it was open and it was close to my house. The second time we chose it because of the service, quality of the sushi, and the happy hour that starts at 11pm-1pm. They give you lunch AYCE pricing instead of dinner for those couple of hours. Also, just a small fact- you can get classic rolls (8 pieces) for only 3.00 without AYCE.

First time we went, we sat at the bar. Service was quick. At the end of the meal, my friend and I saw they had a deal where if we rated them 5 stars and showed our server that we would get a sample of the Korean cream cookie or what not. I tried to ask a server how that works and they said they don't sell it and didn't carry it, so I'm confused! Instead I settled for red bean ice cream.

Second time my friend and I came not even in a week's time, this time we sat at the tables closest to the wall and away from the teppanyaki tables. Service was a little slower but expected because we were not at the bar. Our beverages were filled constantly which I really appreciated. Means the busser/server was actually keeping an eye out for us

I decided to go for dinner the first time after reading the reviews on yelp.

Asked if that applid if I ordered something and didn't like it. Yep. So went with a la carte. Waitress was okay.

Second time did AYCE lunch, and they seated me at a booth instead of a table. :NOTE: The booths have very slick vinyl covers.

The sushi was , and went ahead and ordered the monkey burrito. ($6 a la carte) I reasoned if I didn't like it, would be paying what I would have paid for dinner. Honestly, it's awesome. Tempura is light and crispy. I'd pass on the shumai. Waiter was nice and attentive until...

When I was done, I went toscoot out of the booth, the vinyl was so slick, I literally slid off the bench and landed between my booth and the one next to me, right on my bum. Ow. 

Both people on either side of me checked to make sure I was okay. Literally, getting up from their tables and offering to help me up.

This location recently opened just a few min down the street from where I live.  No restaurant is perfect every visit in service, quality, price etc AND there is no perfect all you can eat sushi restaurant anywhere (each one has it's good and bad) but this place definitely has earned all 5 stars.  

Service so far is consistent and VERY friendly, price for all you can eat is the same as everyone else, their ala carte prices are FANTASTIC $3 for all their basic sushi rolls and they are the same size and quality as anywhere else. Their tepenyaki prices are probably the best in town. The portions and quality are far better then some other places too.  Geisha House used to be great and they have gone way down hill over the last 2-3 years.  The tepenyaki show to me is average I think that's because I've seen it so many times over the years from so many different places that it doesn't really thrill me anymore (especially since tepenyaki has become more mainstream as well). With that in mind, I'm also ok with the show being average as long as the price, portion and quality of food is there and it DEFINITELY is.  Also their sauces are NOT the typical 3 sauces you find at other places. Theirs is SO much better!  

I've read that a few people gave them low stars because something was forgotten. Trust me it's not intentional and everyone here is eager to please. 
From everything I've seen on all my visits now  (I've already been there at least 6 times since they recently opened) and every visit has been great and I continue to recommend this place and have brought my family there as well and we RAVED about it for 2 days!!! They will DEFINITELY fix the situation for you. I am led to believe it was a customer problem. 

Quality of their food (sushi or tepenyaki) is excellent.  

Again, no sushi/tepenyaki restaurant in this city is perfect but they do a fantastic job in all categories and you are definitely missing out if you don't go here!!",9GyTNxzAN8UxpPPSTfei-A,1,1,5,5AjsHNO-tEQ5fSLFfnMoKg

The menu has a lot of different choices and into categories. It also had a wide variety of appetizer and even different types of sushi burritos. I got the udon soup and thought it was very yummy.

We started ordering different rolls from different categories. I honestly enjoyed all of them! They were all freshly made and tasted like a regular roll you get from anywhere else. It blew my mind that sushi rolls tasted this good for only $20 at lunch. I will definitely be coming back if I'm ever in town again.

Some of the highest quality sushi that you can find doing the AYCE thing.

I'm usually not a big fusion sushi sauce guy, but everything they do here seems to compliment the roll perfectly. They don't sauce it just to sauce it but they make it work.

Tip: Go for the no rice rolls...the Joni Roll with the thinly sliced cucumber on the outside and also have sushi chef ""Sponge"" make you something nice...she'll definitely hook it up and make you a happy customer.

After feeling the Decatur/Twain Jjanga had gone downhill when the owner departed for a while, this location opened up near my house and completely redeemed that Jjanga name.

We like the options their entire menu offers compared to other sushi places in the area because they have a wide variety of appetizers and skewers and non-fish options for those who don't eat sushi that much. I also like how their menu is laid out by grouping their specials, spicy rolls, deep fried rolls, baked rolls, etc.

Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish they allowed half roll orders so you could try more rolls during your visit without having to stuff your face.

I think they also just started doing their late night happy hour like their Decatur location which is $20.95 AYCE Mon-Sat from 11pm-2am.

Also don't forget to get a stamp card!! But you can only redeem your free AYCE if you come in with your card fully stamped - you can't redeem your free AYCE the same visit as when you reach it.",C_PklbtFOnm-UVMUwi2iHg,0,0,4,_sJddfHEhEfz4uPpTGjg_g

It was just the 2 of us and the place was pretty empty so we were seated right away. I would say there were maybe 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. The waiter came up after 5 minutes and took our order and drink order. We only ordered 2 Kirin Light beers. But we did order a bunch of sushi. 

The waiter came back with some water and then he turned around and started giving us our sushi from the sushi bar. We ordered around 10 items and they pretty much came all at once. That is fine but where is our beer???

The waiter never came back-- I had to get another waitress to come by, I asked her where our beers were. It didn't really matter at this point because we had already finished out entire meal. I mean the restaurant was not busy and they could not serve us 2 beers? That's a problem. 

The fish was not fresh at all and the pieces were so small. I have never seen pieces this small before. It was very strange. I have been to many AYCE sushi places and I was also surprised that they did not put avocado in the rolls. They either left it out or put carrots. 

When we finally got the bill they ended up charging us for the 2 beers. I thought it was kind of rude to do that since they didn't even bring them until we were finished with our meal. The whole point was to enjoy the beer while eating the sushi. Overall I was not impressed with this place and will probably not come back.

Today I stumbled upon this gem and wow was I blown away. Very pleasant waiter Alex greeted us and we chose the all you can eat sushi during lunch. First thing we noticed was the vast menu so we asked Alex what his favorite was and he suggested the monkey sushi burrito. Wow! First bite and I knew: this place is on another level. We proceeded to try random items on the menu we thought sounded good and every time something else came we enjoyed it more and more. Wound up picking the bulgogi appetizer, monkey burrito, 6 different sushi rolls, and a Korean ice cream sandwich. Holy moly what a joy to eat here! The quality is phenomenal, the service is good, and the flavor... Oh my! My all time favorite sushi rolls were the XXX and the screaming honey. It's really impressive to me especially that we practically dart boarded on their menu things we thought sounded good and everything was so highly satisfying. We had actually planned initially to come here once so we had a chance to try more places during our vacation here but nope. Definitely coming again and this time for dinner! 

I'm very interested in trying the beef/steak options that are only available during dinner.

For me, Jjanga is amazing in some ways but have some areas they could use on improvement - thankfully some areas that can be addressed almost immediately. My friends & I stopped by for lunch on a Saturday & the price being at ~$20 was definitely amazing. Not only does their menu include what you'd see at a typical AYCE sushi place (nigiri, rolls, appetizers) but it also has a section for sushi burritos & they have fries which is different. So the $20 definitely goes a long way. In terms of the sushi, the fish tastes fresh however there seems to be something different when it comes to the rice.. the only way I can describe it is the rice seems to break apart when you try to pick the sushi up with your chop sticks leaving a huge mess & also the fish seems to separate extremely easily from the rice. Something just seems off.. The appetizers were okay. The edamame tasted old & the fries were nothing special but what do you expect, it's a sushi place. It also took way to long to get appetizers (around 20 min) that we didn't even want to order another round cause we knew it would take forever. The service was a little sparse & it seemed like our table as well as a few other tables were left wondering when someone would be back. The dessert includes four different ice cream flavors which you can choose as many as you want & it was actually really good ice cream. 

Overall, the fish itself was comparable to what you get in other sushi places in Vegas & the dessert is great ice cream. However, the assembly of the sushi doesn't seem right with the rice, the service is not amazing although everyone is extremely nice!  The appetizers do take a long while so if you're planning on ordering something do it at the beginning. All in all, I would come back because of the variety of choices on the menu & the price!",LxKgoVJdZwRDtxAZjP1arw,0,0,3,lN-G1JLIES16vXL8IRJgbw

5517458,2016-09-15,2,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Upon entry we were immediately greeted by a friendly and welcoming lady. Husband and I NEVER sit at the bar. He always wants to, but, I don't like it. I don't like bothering someone with our order when I can clearly see them rolling away and looking all ready busy. I prefer ordering when a waitress comes and takes our order. Taught my husband a lesson that evening.

So we sat at the bar. I'm immediately looking for purse space. This must sound high maintenance all ready, but seriously...I will use my purse as a back cushion before it sits on the floor. Bad luck! Superstitious much? Once I assessed the purse situation, let's stare at the menu

I sure loved looking at their menu and what they has to offer. We opted for AYCE because what sushi person in their right mind go otherwise. Lunch rounded to 21 bucks while dinner rounds to 26. The price is WELL WORTH it! I noticed they offered sushi burritos as part of their AYCE, but it's listed under hand rolls. Which is basically the same smell.

We ordered away. My husband lucks out with me because you know those special 1 order person items sushi places implements, I never like or order any of them anyway so he gets 2! Lol. He was extremely excited over seeing Tobiko served on the menu. The color is so beautifully red that it makes masago look real dull. He just loves trying new things even though they may taste the same. 

I enjoyed all that I had. Please.dont make me list my AYCE order. Who the hell remembers to the T anyway? What I do know is that there were a couple.items I ordered towards the end that I thought were useless. I ate them, and nothing exciting came of it. I think they're place there just to make you disgustingly feel full. Hahhaha! Because they were my last 2 orders and they made me feel just that. I tried looking at the online menu but for some reason, their menu in the restaurant vs online could slightly be different as I didn't see it nor recognize any of the items being the items I ate that made me feel like a slob.

Another thing is I LOVE garlic edamame. Love it. Like, no, really love it. However, I did not love it here, did not like.it there, swear I swear I swear. 

Also, we were seated in front of two chefs and while the guy was really friendly and welcoming, the woman chef made me feel like she was annoyed and never bothered to ask us if we wanted anything. So we ended up staring at the friendlier chef like hungry puppies until he caught the drift. Lol. My husband became really timid when it came.to.ordering because he was seated adjacent to the woman and he didn't really order as much as he wanted because of the vibe. BUT...he still got what he came for. 

Another annoying thing is...plates for other patrons were places right in front of us so the waiters/waitresses had to keep reach in front of us. It's rather an inconvenience and borderline annoying. They should create a system where they don't have to do that. Why I hate sitting at the bar. 

If your stomach can't handle or it isn't worth you opting for the AYCE...they do have great soup/salad, appetizer, and nigiri options at a pretty cheap price and selection in my opinion. I imagined bringing my children in and just ordering from the appetizers alone and they'd be covered. 

Overall, I highly recommend giving them a shot. They're pretty good and I love their menu options! Kid and stroller friendly! Certainly will return...waitress/waiter please?!

Enjoy!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,2,3,4,V8b0BzNJZnra7_UzJmWY6w

5524732,2016-09-23,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"We just had our first and last hibachi experience at this place . Ugh ! Never had a cook like this in my life . Puts the rice down to cook , proceeds to put all the meat out while the rice is cooking . Literally dropped a piece of raw chicken in the rice . Took him a minute to notice it , just moved it off the rice and proceeds to cook. Maybe I'm crazy but I have a feeling if any other cook dropped raw chicken on the rice he would have started over with a new batch of rice . 
On to our steaks , I prefer New York , my husband prefers filet mignon . The chef mixed them up and was preparing  the NY for my husband . We told the cook , he argued for a minute , then realized he was wrong . He takes the NY off the grill and orders another filet mignon ?!? I told him It was a NY , he tells me he's giving me the filet because it's pricier ?!? I don't care about the cost ! I like NY strip . I just decide I'm not going to argue , and deal with the filet . Of course he put a nice full lemon squeeze on top before putting it on my plate ! LEMON on my steak ?!? Ugh ! 
My lobster tasted like it came out of a frozen bag at Walmart. Sorry but I'm not impressed !
We talked to the manager .. He did take my meal off the bill but there is no way in heck I'm going back to  eat raw chicken fried rice or lemon soaked filet mignon . 
We literally paid the 62.00 for my son and husbands meals which they didn't fully eat for various reasons as well and went straight to the Burger King drive thru .",fQ9owsz3ap05vrGrTLPa4Q,0,0,1,5HfTeBO-Oy0gK4qdrGwK8g

Food was pretty decent but our server that we started with is what brought the whole experience down. Her name was JJ and heard she was training but you can't train someone with an attitude from the start and playing it off fake later. We had a dish sent back and that's what's set off the whole experience cause when another server took the dish back and reported to our main server she had an expression of a dirty look. So I requested another server to help us since JJ was not very attentive and her presence disgusted me. Her appearance was not very professional with hoop earrings and piercing on her face as well.

It started right when we came in and met Ellen.  Talk about knowing how to treat your customers right.  She was very personable and welcoming.  This was our first time, but we felt like this was our normal hangout spot.  We started off with drinks at the bar and it kept getting better from there.   

We decided to try hibachi and met Tony ... he was awesome and kept us entertained and cooked us a scrumptious meal.  Not gonna lie we were a loud group being just the three of us but I think we kept him entertained as well.  

Our group each tried one of the specials so we got a variety of meats and seafood and our recommendation is try try try everything !!! 

For drinks I recommend the grapefruit sake ... Probably dangerous because it was so delicious but you gotta have sake when you eat right ???

5575269,2015-04-12,4,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"Where to Start? I usually don't write reviews, but my experience at JJANGA was so disappointing that I felt it was absolutely necessary. The food was good so that's where the two stars are coming from, but service was absolutely horrible.

Our main waitress seemed to have no clue what was on the menu and just seemed overwhelmed in general.  My sister and I had ordered 4 items each and had to repeat what we had ordered to her multiple times. (Kinda seemed like she downed 4 redbulls before her shift.)

We were seated by the sushi bar and when our first round of food came out it wasn't what we ordered. The server would ask the sushi chef what the item was and flip to us and ask us if this was what we ordered 3-4 times until she got it right. 

Our second round of food came out and it wasn't right either. She had given us a spicy scallop cut roll instead of a hand roll. She realized her mistake, but just replied "" Oh damn you ordered the hand roll huh? Oh don't worry though! They're the same price though. Don't worry."" Thanks? 

I also ordered a squid nigiri and a spicy salmon roll. Another waiter had come by, asking if we would like the check. I had mentioned my missing items and apparently they were never put in. As the look of confusion passes over the waiter's and the chef's face for a few moments. He says ""Oh! I'll put it in"" Our salmon roll came out, but we waited 20 minutes for the squid and just ended up asking for the check. Our original waitress came back and asked if we had wanted anything else and we asked about the squid and again the chef ""never got it"" Got the check, squid was on there, asked them to remove it, paid and left.

This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, but If you enjoy sh*tty service with mildly rude waitresses, JJANGA is the place for you!",ZMrnRefZ9RpP3nNjGBN2lA,4,1,2,yco8l6gDq5VB4ZFAxTN9Mw

I ordered the sexy time roll. It was crispy rice with spicy tuna and jalapeños on top. I recently became a fan of this because Sushi Roku does the best version of this that I have ever seen. It was decent, but the spicy tuna just kept falling apart and crumbling away. It was very difficult to eat. Next, I got Stacy's mom roll. That one was very good.. satisfied my sweet tooth for something more on the rich side. Lastly, I got the Joe's special roll. It was shrimp tempura and cucumber inside, and tuna and avocado on top with spicy ponzu . I really liked this roll, however the shrimp inside was stale and hard. It tasted like a shrimp that had been fried but unused for at least a couple hours. Overall, it did satisfy my craving and I will be back. My only suggestion is that maybe they can do newly fresh fried shrimp on to go orders ... seeing as how you are paying 3x the price for to go instead of patronizing the all you can eat option .",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,0,0,4,krKg1CRowAesDtC_6ljIMA

The hibachi area is separated from the regular tables by a divider thing. Overall, it's really nice.

For both lunch and dinner, they offer an all you can eat option for $20 for lunch or $25 for dinner. That's pretty cool! Only one person in our group ordered the AYCE option. I got a lunch special bento box and some tuna sushi. Everyone's sushi came out pretty quickly, but anything from the kitchen took AGES. Even to the point of someone who ordered 2 appetizers... their appetizers were the last things that came out. Last. At the end of the meal. My bento box came out a good 30-40 minutes after my sushi. One person never got their order of gyoza that they had ordered as part of their lunch sushi roll combo. 

Aside from the slow service, they were just very nonchalant about our group. Waters with no refills. Parts of orders ignored. One person's appetizer was dry (the Dynamite, which is supposed to be creamy).

5752722,2015-03-25,1,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"$26 for an AYCE sushi isn't a bad deal, especailly at Jjanga, where the food is way above average for an AYCE, ambiance is upscale (again way above your typical sushi joints), and number of dishes available are way way above average.  This place is a bona fide gem, a place we plan on coming back to frequently.

Let me get the couple of minor negatives out of the way.  First, the service was not bad by any means, but not necessarily great.  Maybe it's on purpose to slow down the ordering, but the attentiveness wasn't exactly proactive.  We had to flag down the wait staff to get our orders in past the initial order, and the table next to us actually left complaining they were not getting any attention.  Once that happened, however, the service picked up.  So it may have been an anomaly, but as it was, it gets a passing grade but not exactly an A.  Second, the fish portion of the nigiri were smallish, although I liked that the entire nigiri was modest in size as well.  I hate when the nigiri pieces are so monstrous that you need to take two bites to eat a piece.

The positives are numerous:
1) Quality of the fish were comparable to what you would find at very good sushi joints.  Not on par with the top-of-the-line, but it's also not $90 pp either.
2) The quality of the menu is outstanding.  They have dishes you just don't find at AYCE, such as amaebi, uni, oysters, several sashimi dishes, and about 10,000 roll dishes.  Note that for some of these high-end dishes, it's one order per person max each.  Still, get one of each and you'll be more than full.  And then you still have unlimited orders of some of my faves, saba, ikura, albacore, hamachi, etc.  Also has couple dozens of appetizers, desserts, and several choices of soups.  
3) Great, upscale decor and lively atmosphere, topped off with k-pop music.  TVs all over the place so it's also good for game days.  Seating could use some improvement, I don't like those stools...
4) We didn't partake, but the hibachi is a good complement.
5) Some of those servers were cute!

All-in-all this is a can't miss, high-bargain restaurant that doesn't make you feel cheap for seeking an AYCE.  I rate the food 4.5, atmosphere 4.5, and service 3.5 for a solid 4.5 stars.  I'll round down, hoping their service matures enough for a full 5 star rating next time around.

Table-for-1 Factor:  They have sushi bar with at least a dozen seats, and I can see myself noshing on my own despite the festive atmosphere that may suggest otherwise.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,1,1,4,5yg8ZxNXGzYOKUmbZRUZhw
5761028,2017-07-09,0,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,Food was good and prices were right. Came on a Sunday and there was brunch. Fun choices for japanese inspired brunch options. And they gave us a tower appetizer sampler for free which was very good. Only reason I didnt give 5 stars is service. They were polite but they are understaffed in servers. Food came out very slow and no utensils which should have been set when we sat down and not after our food was served. Free specials for yelp reviews. Will come back and change to 5 stars when that issue is fixed. More attention would result in better service but need at least 1 to 2 more servers.,nIeGWrm3KIrU4W_T6yCcgg,0,0,4,W8opYgbC8d-GJ1TeSe71Fg

5778469,2017-10-29,2,NIOwzgujIXKVBEVNTQBXpg,"If you've seen that viral Facebook video of that sushi burger, then you know you can get it here.

It's very similar to a sushi burrito. The ""patties"" are made of rice. I suggest getting the Panko crust for that extra crunch.

The sushi burger, called Jjanga Burger, consists of spicy tuna, crab meat, and seaweed salad. It's wrapped in a brown paper to help keep its shape. You can get the burger alone for $9 or get the combo for $13. The combo will get you the burger, fries, and a drink. I'm a fries girl, so I ALWAYS go for the combo. My fiancé on the other hand says he can pass on the fries

I deducted a star because the first time I had this, my fiancé picked it up to go and he was carrying 4 small size clear cups. He said that they don't have any other size cups so they gave him 2 of each to equal a medium size. Wouldn't it be easier to invest in bigger size cups?

Other than that, I've already been back 3 times. I love ordering it to go. I work 5 minutes away and it only takes 15-20 minutes to prep.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,3,2,4,2G4V5wD-POtGTnu0iTNJJw

My friends & I got: 
- Jjanga Burger
- Jjanga Burrito
- Sexy Time Sushi
- Stacey's Mom Sushi
- Sponge Special Sushi
- KFC 

The Jjanga burger was decent, though a little more bland than I'd expect. We got the rice bun instead of the panko bun, which is probably why it started falling apart after a few bites. Other than that, I would still try the other burgers though! Maybe the Jjanga wasn't for us. 

The Jjanga burrito however, was pretty good! It comes with the sweet eel sauce which goes well with the burrito. Definitely wanna try the other burritos next time I'm in town! 

We loved all the sushi rolls - especially their racy and pop-culture-inspired names! Wanted to order more but after sharing the dishes family-style, we got full pretty quick. 

First time I've ever tried the KFC (Korean-Fried Chicken) and it was really good! I would have definitely ordered more had we not gotten so full.

All-in-all, great place to eat with reasonable prices & portion sizes. Would definitely recommend a visit here - not just for the sushi burger, but for their other food too!

I tried calling her over to my table countless times and she would even give me eye contact but never came. The restaurant was pretty dead.
