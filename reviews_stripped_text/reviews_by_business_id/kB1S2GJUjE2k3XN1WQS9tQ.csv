Porque es el más sucio y puerco  de todo nevada 
Siempre te dan la orden equivocada 
Si llegas primero 
Despachan al que llegó después de ti 
Los empleados te quieren tratar como si fueras una basura 
Hoy pedí un strawberry ice cream 
Y me lo dieron todo chorreado tirando sé por los lados y le dije ala manager 
Que no estaba bien y se lo di para que me dieran otro 
De repente miro que la manager con unas toallitas le estaba sacando todo lo chorreado y ni siquiera se abia lavado las manos 
Pues me levante y le dije que eso no estaba bien que me diera otro nuevo o mejor mi dinero 
La mujer hizo una mala cara y me dio otro 
Y esto se mira seguido.",AS3Tjm5En3W2Y0AmT_jusg,0,0,1,PO9ulp9cdQ0pyNFZptWsOQ

I waited for about 30 minutes for someone to take my order there was a lady in front of me and a line behind me. The Manager finally came out to help the lady in front of me then she left. She came back up front and told the young man that was waiting to complete his order, to work the register or go home. He responded that a customer had been waiting 30 minutes and he was trying to get him his food. She continued to yell at him in front of the customers. He asked her not to yell at him which only agitated her more. She told him again to get the customers food and go home. Meanwhile neither I nor the other customers had been helped. A young man that was waiting behind me said excuse me can we get some help. Another customer said she'd been waiting on her food for 30 minutes. This was very unprofessional so I left. The customers behind me  and I discussed how unprofessional she was, also the customer that the young man assisted was upset that he (Mc Donalds employee)was treated this way.

He was extremely friendly, courteous, and a joy to be around. He even walked my order out to the table where my family was sitting. Due to Antonio I am more than willing to recommend this location. 

The reason I do not have 5stars is because of past history. I actually stopped going to the location about 2 years ago due to consistent horrible service but I wanted to see how it was like since the renovations. The visit yesterday changed my mind completely and made it enjoyable to go to the location I once avoided",97AyuyqkOa0vWSVzjb_WoA,0,0,4,-Vvl9TwM4SDZ-CAVp4G2CQ

4923376,2017-04-07,0,kB1S2GJUjE2k3XN1WQS9tQ,"This McDonald's gets nothing more than 2 stars on my book strictly based off the business great and affordable prices and variety of food it has to offer along with the service hours. The reason it's short on the other stars is because of atmosphere of indoor dining area, and drive through service that is rarely good. I ate there 2 times and knew that was the last time I would. When u go in, there's usually someone asking u for money around the doorway if not on the drive through while ur waiting to order ur food, then there's usually small groups of bad crowds in or outside the area, workers usually have a bad attitude and I can understand why, but not every customer is abusive to u guys, the overall feel of this business is very upsetting, over stressed and when there's a lot of workers they're usually talking to each other and when u get there to talk to them theyre bothered. As far as accuracy don't really expect a whole lot, they've messed up my orders several time and I usually just go there as last resort, I'll go to pollo loco, jack, or the new taco Bell instead before I go there",eCVGaHwZblw5UQFc97wLVw,1,0,2,yLca0LhIcHI1Vc53fQR2Rw
