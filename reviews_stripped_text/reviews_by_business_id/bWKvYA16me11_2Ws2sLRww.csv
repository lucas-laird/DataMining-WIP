My sweetheart and I walked in, we were seated and we were waiting 15 minutes for our drinks (coke and iced tea) before we decided to walk out. It's ashamed becasue we had heard the food was good.",aFmzRbHCpcqGntKhuXXisg,0,0,1,PGmz3c16w1JN_Twctc7ERQ

First off JRS Place doesn't sound to much like an Italian bar/restaurant, and the interior doesn't seem olive garden ish. It looks like a normal Vegas bar with a separate seating area.  I sat at the bar and looked at the menu.  It was a bit pricey but the bartender told me it was all worth it.  So i had their meatballs and OMG they were out of this world.  

I had a beer as well and the staff seemed to be very nice and helpful.  next week i will go in and have a proper dinner there and update this review. But as of now i would recommend it.",UpIv0SLyj2WGeoXkivGtsg,0,0,3,0WZSdIlo3vruaLzj5jpEeA

So a 4* farewell to Susan for really putting her heart into her cooking, and being so gracious with her customers, and we will really miss those meatballs. We wish her well in the future, and hope there is one for her in a local kitchen.",UXmddgoTzmOZAZTaZf_efA,0,0,4,J_V7fG-UqC5YMov9wER5Zg

The place was dead on a Saturday, which is a real shame because it's a beautiful interior!! You can tell there was a lot of hard work that went into making this place look nice on the inside. Unfortunately, from the outside it looks like another PT's or Sierra Gold. There is a few poker machines and a beautiful bar when you walk in and the dining room is set up to the right. We walked in and the bartender told us to sit wherever we pleased. We picked the booth right in front of the TV that was playing the Godfather. 
Our other guests arrived and we ordered the meatball sub, the sorrentino parm, the meatballs and spaghetti and the eggplant parm. The waitress kept up supplied with Labrea bread french baguette loaves and olive oil and balsamic vinegar which some italian places don't do, but I LOVE! 
When the food came out, it got reeeaalllly quiet as everyone dug in and didn't come up for air anytime soon after that!! The pasta was al dente and the meatball melt in your mouth. The tomato sauce was just the right hint of sweetness and freshness. YUM!
Susan, the owner and chef came out and talked to us for about 20 minutes. She's a native New York-ah and has family from South Philly, where my husband and his family is from and myself being from upstate New York. She puts her blood sweat and tears into this place and unfortunately with the economy and the massive construction going on in front of her place, the business has taken a hit. But definitely not because of the food. This is the type of place you want to tell all your friends about because it's a legit place serving up delicious food and nice ambiance. Don't even get me started on her bread pudding or her cannolis. Just go and order them and savor what real home cooking can be like!!!!",t16fqojzTRssS1mQ7g8fig,2,0,5,HVCsh0OXJIJzvOq2vNJdig

We're very sad to see Jr's Place go. It was such a nice experience and we hope that one day they will be able to come back. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jr's is possibly the nicest Italian Bar/Restaurant on the West Side of Las Vegas. The staff is so far beyond nice it ridiculous. I would definitely not recommend this place for anyone on a diet. Every dish we've had so far is the quintessential definition of decadence. Lavished with butter, tomato sauce, and the most mouth water ingredients we have yet to try, I would put their menu up against any traditional Italian cuisine in the city, and that includes the strip. Its as if you're in Italy, but everyone speaks English. Wine Wednesdays are phenomenal. So if you've had a rough day or week, stop by for the best service, from fare to fairness, that you can have up off of Durango.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,2,0,5,kOkKquXxUiAt5sREUiVkKA

3614536,2010-06-02,0,bWKvYA16me11_2Ws2sLRww,"I wasn't motivated to wait at Nora's after climbing all afternoon, so we stopped at Jr's.  You briefly pass through the smokey bar, but the smoke was barely detectable in the restaurant area.  They brought out a fresh loaf of warm La Brea Bakery bread with olive oil and balsamic.  We ordered a meatball appetizer and the chicken/rapini/ provolone sandwich to share.
I concur with others on the meatballs.  The sandwich was a tad greasy and could have been better if accompanied by their red sauce, but the rapini added a nice touch.  Decent service and overall worth a return visit.",KxrTQnzr83z0HZnrAkkeGQ,0,0,3,m4E4NaG1t7s-0n0KIhesTQ

Wrapped in a non-descript brown stucco wrapper that makes it look like the ubiquitous pub/bar/restaurant that one sees all over Las Vegas, JR's place is proof that one can't judge a book by its cover. Even after I walked in and saw the joker poker screens and the TV's all over the place, I was unsure about it.
But when i saw Peroni on tap, I was encouraged. How many bars have Peroni on tap? James, the barman, was engaging and polite. When I saw the menu,  I felt even better. I tried a simple rigatoni dish a la vodka and a dinner salad. The salad did not come out of a bag...the greens were fresh, varied and crisp. The dressing was just enough...not dripping all over the plate. I later found out that Susan, the owner/chef even makes them herself. They tasted like they were made that day.
The rigatoni was perfect...al dente and the sauce was just right. When I finished, I complimented James and he brought Susan over. She introduced herself and her husband,  Jerry. They made me feel like I was in a neighborhood place in Brooklyn (Susan's home) and I was family. She 'made' me try one of her canolis. I know she filled it just before she served it because the shell was crisp and the sprinkles were all over the dish. The ricotta filling was as good as I've ever had.

I can't wait to go back and try the meatballs. fuggetaboutit....this place is a must.",-ad22O8EIgPU_TqQ3Quxgg,0,0,5,kHO3tlw0LffKTKGzrjY1LA
3950283,2009-06-07,0,bWKvYA16me11_2Ws2sLRww,"Everything was terrific.  The restaurant was not too busy to accommodate our party of six.  Of our appetizers, the meatballs were the best:  4 inches in diameter and served with a dollop of ricotta imported from NY. We were thoroughly impressed.  The baked caprese was a unique take on a  staple.  Of six entrees, the chicken parmesan and rigatoni sausage dominated.  All of the desserts were homemade and amazing.  Our favorites were the bead pudding and cannoli (which could have done without the rainbow sprinkles). Quality ; )",fDrawNs2nLBo3ShfMbk93A,0,0,5,1Kgw7HvOVHhG4a2BdFBZSw
4050511,2009-09-03,0,bWKvYA16me11_2Ws2sLRww,"I'm a big believer in quality over quantity,  so when I was introduced to JR's meatballs I was kind of bef*ckled.  They come huge like the size of a basebal, and it's ALL good.  Every bite you can take!  I can't even compare this to any meatballs I've ever had before.  There's so much awesomeness they even put raisins in there!  Raisins!!  Who would have thought of that?

Their bread is pretty good too.  I think they get it freshly baked from some local bakery called Labrea Bakery.  Says on the wrapper. 

I wish I could say more about this place,but every time I come here or order take-out it's always the meatballs.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,2,1,4,H-pQPPtH821ZK9K_5-L6Uw
4437587,2009-07-23,1,bWKvYA16me11_2Ws2sLRww,"OH wow! I had the meatballs appy last night - just one meatball is big enough for dinner! I don't know where to start raving first... the tomato sauce is (and I have to whisper this) - better than my grandma's! And that could get me fired from the family... Its nothing like I've had here in Vegas. Its real, homemade, with the expensive tomatoes and its just right. The little dollop of real farm fresh ricotta on the side really makes it - that's just the little bit of sweet you need to cut the tomato sauce/meat goodness. They need to double up on that, though. Seriously - ask for double ricotta. Then there's the meatballs... OMG. Big as a softball, weighty but light and FLUFFY! Yes, I'm telling you - fluffy meatballs! They melt in your mouth. I don't understand why something as ""simple"" as meatballs in red sauce can be done so poorly all over the place - but JR's sets the standard. I'm surprised this place isn't being written up all over town in the Weekly, City Life, and RJ... its an unassuming little loungie/bar-looking place, but hiding in here is definitely (IMHO) the best Italian in Vegas. 

James the bartender is awesome, too! So authentically nice. I think that's the key word here - AUTHENTIC.  No need to go to the Strip for Italiana. Its all right here.",7Pxx2FehELyKthPj0OY1sg,2,2,5,19IflrwYzdJWrULveeBZuQ
