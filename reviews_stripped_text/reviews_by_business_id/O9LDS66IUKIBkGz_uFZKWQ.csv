I asked the hosted to clean it. She never came back. We sat there at least 10 minutes asking for a glass of water and some service but one would even come to the table. and then after a while 
I gave up ! Since I am handicap I can not get up and hunt down a server   We decided to leave and on the way out I explained to the hostess that we could not get any service and we were going to leave and she said oh ok!!!

Is this how you handle your customer service ? 
I am very disappointed! I guess one customer means nothing to you. Is this the way your employees are trained?  There were not one employee that was rude but all that I spoke to 
I wanted to make you aware of these issues 
Sorry for your issues. Hope you can fix them. I know I am done coming there. There are too many choices in this area that will treat the customers right!",IQBwws00hCn-YB-ycFNf5Q,1,0,1,_fNq5LIi4qNMebPw5xTudA

We told the waitress who apologized and she got us another order of fries. When she came around, she asked how everything was going and we were honest in reporting to her that we'd lost our appetites after the hair and felt the need to check all our food out of fear for other hairs. She said nothing and left. (She never returned to our table after this; we tipped her anyway). 

A manager then comes and asks us how we are doing. We tell him that we were quite upset with the found hair. He apologized and said that he's not sure how this happened as they take precautions, but it does happen occasionally. He shrugged and said matter-of-factly ""Mistakes happen."" Seriously?! He gave us all the impression that hair in Chili's food happens and when it does, they don't feel it's a big deal. 

Me and my friends looked at each other, aghast at his response and attitude. He gave us a 10% discount off the bill. Wow, how generous. I'm in management and know that the best way to win over a customer is a serious apology and atonement (for example, ""I'm so sorry. In no way is this acceptable and I apologize. Let me try and make it right so that you'll give us another chance.""). Instead, we got a lousy 4$ off our meal.",a-02i9bepKrIea6-IaoXbQ,1,0,1,IouTg1Ouspgm4j7rUoriCw
1118473,2014-07-01,0,O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ,"We ate here around 2pm today.  There was no greeter at the podium and we waited several minutes before seating.  Our server sat us so I guess they don't have a host/hostess this time of day.  

I immediately noticed these tablets on tables that raced through advertisements.  There are ones on every table.  It made the background very busy and distracting, especially since they were not all on the same sequence.  These seem like an awful idea. This by itself would make me not come back but there were far more problems.

Our food was very slow to come out.  My wife's food was cold when it finally came out.  apparently they made it and let it sit there while they made fajitas, that were too oily. The quality of the chicken was quite poor too.

We would have complained, but our service was terrible and we never got checked on.  It was not really the server's fault. They only had one server on the floor for about 8 tables and he was also seating people.

As we sit there we are finished and the server comes over and asks if we want dessert. We say no. This means we want the check, right? Not here.  We wait another 10-15 minutes and notice the people at the table next to us are just as annoyed and discovered they could pay their bill on the tablet.  I wanted to pay cash though.  We could not flag anybody down.  We finally paid the bill on the tablet.

Bad food. Bad service. Stupid annoying tablets on every table flashing screens every few seconds. No way to pay cash for bill anymore apparently.",kFuqgoQCKs19a8-o2JvbYg,1,0,1,tHDGUqOv_p3PxOY1_zI1TQ
1129538,2017-08-15,1,O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ,"With my husband and two (very well behaved grandchildren) we had dinner last evening at Chili's Restaurant at 9051 W. Charleston, Las Vegas, Nv. At approximately 6:15.  There was one other occupied table on our side of the restaurant.   After 10 minute wait our server, Shannon, came to our table and took our drink order and walked away.  It was 15 minutes before our drinks arrived at our table at which time she took our dinner order.   The children ordered their meal and I explained that my husband and I would like to split an entree and a salad, as we wanted to eat light because we wanted to have dessert this evening.  With this Shannon rolled her eyes in disgust.  My granddaughter said ""wow""! Noticing the rude gesture.

20 minutes later another person brought our dinners and my grandson received a different dish than what he ordered so we explained to him and he picked it up and left our table.  Taking a long time for him to receive his order he was eating off my plate as we had a busy day and the kids were hungry.  He received his order 15 minutes after the three of us were finished.

Our drinks were never filled, we were never asked if everything was okay.  Shannon came to the table one time and all she said was ""I guess the chef messed up your order"". We asked for our check and I told her ""I have a coupon"". She turned away rolling her eyes again and said ""I'm sure you do"" and we never saw her again.  My husband finally went to the bar tender and asked for our check.

They were not busy, we again were never asked for a refill, or if everything was okay, of what we wanted for dessert as we have previously explained that we did.

Being upset when I got home I called Ron, the Manager of the store to explain what happened and he said ""well, things happen"".   I was literally speechless of his response.  Did not receive a ""sorry"" from anyone from start to finish.",V52mK0g40JTMeGYYe6RFxQ,3,0,1,PgDLhpT9uBZ7-ffoNkohRA
1184312,2014-05-19,0,O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ,"I received a $25 gift card to Chili's. It's been years since I've eaten there, so why not take the family out for Sunday brunch? I walked into the Chili's at 9501 W. Charleston today around 2:00 PM. with my wife, 11-year-old son and my 4-year-old daughter. No one was there to greet us, but I understood that it was a Sunday afternoon, the place was jam-packed and more than likely, they were very busy. We were the only ones waiting to be seated and they did seat us at a comfortable booth within minutes, so that wasn't really my issue. 

We quickly noticed that there were little tablets on each table to keep the kids busy while the food was being prepared and we were very impressed with the idea! And for 99¢, you can purchase unlimited usage during your visit, which seemed fair. From that point on, everything seemed to go downhill. Not exaggerating, but it took about 20 minutes for anyone to get to our table. Again, I understand the place is busy, but that was unacceptable. Of course, we had four different employees pass us with the classic ""someone will be with you in a minute."" I wanted another tablet so both kids can play and when one employee (I did not catch his name) passed by, I stopped him to ask for one. He said he'll bring one over, but after ten minutes, I frustratedly got up and grabbed one from another table myself!

The server finally arrived and asked us if we were ready to order. A nice apology for waiting would have sufficed my frustration a little bit, but there wasn't one. Regardless, my son ordered a chicken quesadilla. I had the beef enchiladas, my daughter wanted a cheese quesadilla, and my wife decided on some southwestern chicken salad. Here's the thing; except for some fish, my wife doesn't eat meat. She asked to substitute the chicken with the salmon instead. The server said that they ""cannot do that."" I asked her why, but she continued with ""I can ask the chef, but I don't think they will do that."" Both my wife and I looked at each other puzzled. We eat out very often and not once did we have issues having a meat to fish substitution anywhere. ""What's the big deal?"" I asked her. She said ""I can do the shrimp instead of the chicken, but not the salmon."" I said, ""I thought you said that you can ask, so can you please go do that...my wife doesn't eat shrimp."" We also asked for a separate dish so that my wife can share her salad with our daughter.

The food arrived promptly, not by the original server, but some arrogant guy who I wish I would have remembered his name, but I didn't plan on writing a review. Guess what? They substituted my wife's dish as requested. The server (or order taker) made an issue for no reason whatsoever. There were no mistakes with the orders, but they did forget the extra plate for my daughter. The guy made a facial gesture of frustration, which we did not appreciate. He returned very quickly with a small blue bowl completely dirty with watermarks and finger smudges! Disgusting! He left fast before I can say something and before we could ask for a refill on our refillable drinks. We did catch our original female server and asked for the refills, which she forgot to bring until we reminded her while she passed our table a second time.

Finally, all the food was great. The dishes tasted great, except that my wife could barely eat her salad since it was VERY SPICY, let alone serve it to our daughter! The server knew that that was our intention and it ticked me off that both of them failed to say something! When my wife got the guts to complain, the guy server just stood there quiet with a look of ""yeah, whatever,"" and didn't offer a replacement or even an apology! 

In conclusion, I believe that in the restaurant business, food and customer service are equally important. Therefore, although the food was good, the service was terrible! Do we plan on going again? I believe in second chances and giving the benefit of the doubt. We probably will visit once more, but when the place is less crowded and we intend on sharing today's experience with the manager and if the service isn't flawless, then there are limitless choices in dining out in Las Vegas. I'm sure they already know that.",K4lK7wTzrQWQ1Ay9dINbxg,0,0,3,-94k_eDptirXbFbZXnUrRw

Decided to try out Chili's right after Applebee's on Vet's day.

Again my mentality on free food: A corner has to be cut from somewhere to damage control not breaking even on the inventory.

The Chili's menu wasnt as robust as the Applebees, there was a burger, a salad, a taco, a pasta and a chicken dish. We didnt want to hit up Chili's originally because other then the burger everything was a chicken dish.

Celebrating Vet's day and it's a free dinner so what the hell. 

Ordered the Chicken Margarita and WOW.
The beans were delicious, seasoned to perfection. Normally i hate any kind of bean dish because i've been tormented with boiled beans with no flavor when i was younger but beans that get a seasoning treatment, superb.  

The chicken itself didnt have a lasting flavor to it, you pretty much forgot what it's suppose to taste like after the first chew. But it was VERY tender. Cut with a fork tender and this is a piece of butterflied breast meat.

At the end we decided to order a chocolate lava cake dessert because we all drank water and the meals were free and none of us carried cash for the tip.

The dessert was about average. Cant say much about chocolate cake with ice cream on top that oozes chocolate out.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,0,4,uTY1BEgpkEH2sKV23q1w2A

Bottomless Chips & Salsa for $2.99!  Seriously, I love this salsa!  Its not chunky and has heat.  The chips are hot and delicious!

Cajun Chicken Pasta- Penne pasta with creamy garlic Alfredo sauce with Cajun spices and topped with tomatoes and green onions.
- I get a to-go box and have enough for lunch the next day. 

The call-ahead option is great and they make sure to pack everything up nice & tight!

$20 for an appetizer & two entrees.  Perfect for a cheap date night! :)",Ii1PkdRpONUNwKC3lmhl1A,1,0,4,hXWfSIADp6ByMF0QYrWFPQ

They are moist, smoked, fall-off-the-bone chicken wings like you've never experienced. 5 stars for these smoked wings!

3 stars for the understaffed bar area and those who were working seemed to be afflicted by a malaise of sorts, perhaps it was incidental. Usually bad management is to blame for low morale - it'll be interesting to observe the staff during my next visit. 

I visited at 11am on a Sunday, and the floors were pretty filthy. A shame because the interior of this Chili's is well-appointed and was recently remodeled to corporate modern Chili's spec.

Us being the fatties we are... (Actually we just skipped breakfast so we were starving) we got an appetizer to accompany our lunches. We got the triple trio, and chose hamburger bites, baked potatoes and chicken strips. The hamburger bites were great, and had bacon bites and ranch on them.

Trio Fajitas combo- Shrimp & Double Chicken. This really seemed like the double fajitas platter considering the amount of meat they provided. The shrimp was good, the chicken was mediocre and the corn tortillas were completely broken with an overwhelming amount of onions and little peppers.

I do love the options they have for blended drinks!

3587994,2015-08-31,2,O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ,"Based on service this review would really be a 2.5.  But solid bar food and all day Happy Hour on Sundays brings it to a solid 3.  Upon entering it took a while to even be acknowledged at the door and seated and by no means was this place crowded.  There were maybe two tables I could see in the restaurant area and the bar area had about four to five.  Once we were acknowledged we were immediately led to the restaurant portion.  After seating us and getting our drink order the waiter finally came back and I asked him if there were any specials.  At this time he mentions Happy Hour but only in the bar.  Now, I'm thinking at this point you could have saved us both some time by letting us know that option at the door.  I mean, I get it, you make more money if we sit in the restaurant side but we had no intention of ordering anything but appetizers anyways.

Once we were seated on the bar side service was fine if not a bit slow.  What turns me off about Chili's is the customer service.  They serve you and expect a tip, which the waitress gave instructions on how I could add that on the table computer so obviously paying the tab is self-serve unless you are paying cash.   But to me this takes away from the customer service aspect a little bit, like they are too busy to bring me a paper bill and add to that the machine was out of paper so I didn't even receive a receipt.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,4,1,3,_UCbgkcd7bjfD31A8vnKZw

On the other hand I do still return for the bar! 

I must admit I do LOVE there appetizers/drinks!!! 

I LOVE there Southwestern Eggrolls mmm mmm good so yummy!!! There stuffed with chicken,black beans,corn and jalapeno jack cheese, and is served with this delicious avocado ranch dressing. 

I also love there Crispy Onion Strings & Jalapeno Stack very very tasty especially after having a few Presidente Margaritas! MMMM I love the Presidente Margaritas they come in a shaker and you can poor as you go and there very delicious!

We've had great experiences with other Chilli's locations in the past and decided to try this one since we were on this side of town. It wasn't too busy when we came in and we're immediately seated. We were seated for a minute or two before our server, Louis, came but and got our drink order. It took her less than five minutes to get our drinks to us which was great. She then took our order and told us that it would be out as soon as possible. In the time it took for our food to cook, I drained my strawberry lemonade and the hostess had a new cup to me before the ice had reached the bottom of the glass. Our food came out and my husband really enjoyed his steak. I, being eight months pregnant, had ordered the Bacon Ranch Chicken Quesadilla. I took one bite and immediately hated it. I'm usually the type of person that just deals with it but I just could not stomach this quesadilla. There generally wasn't anything wrong with it, it just didn't sit well with me. My husband noticed my hesitation and said that he would ask if we could replace it. Louis said she would bring her manager over as soon as possible. While we waited, Steph, a server for the other tables, asked if everything was okay. When told the situation, she went straight to the back and brought the manager right up. The manager quickly replaced the food without a problem and gave me a minute to look at the menu. My replacement order was brought out very quickly.

When we went to be seated, they suggested we sit in the bar area as they had two large parties in the main dining room- one with 70 people and one with 20.  We were told that it would be difficult to take our orders and get served in the dining room.  We decided to sit in the bar area.

We didn't know it at the time, but our orders went to the kitchen right after the orders for the 70 something party.  Little did we know it would be a long wait.  

After about 20 minutes, pour waitress came by and apologized for the delay and said the food would be coming soon.  She offered us chips and salsa to munch on until the food came.  We declined.

Ten minutes later, she stopped by again and asked if the manager had been by.  She said the manager would be bringing our meals presently and again she apologized.  WIthin a few minutes, the manager did bring our meals and apologized offering to give us two desserts or a discount on the check.  We declined dessert and when she brought the check, she had deducted the cost of the one meal.  That was great customer service and was certainly a way to bring us back.  The thing I wish, however, is that they would be honest up front.  Had I known the wait would have been that long, I would have gone elsewhere.  Had I known -  had they told me.

As for the food, I had chicken fajitas and my wife had their Chicken Monterrey.  Both dishes were normal Chili's dishes and everything tasted great.  It's a shame the dinner was diminished by the service issues, but I can understand the problem of dealing with that many people in one large party.

We came here yesterday for lunch and I was really pleased to put my usual Shrimp Caribbean salad that I ALWAYS ordered here back on my repertoire.  I stopped ordering it for a while because they re-vamped it and it was not really up to par.  However, since we came for lunch I wanted a salad and so glad I ordered it.  The old salad use to have crispy tortilla strips and pico de gallo, they have since replaced the strips with cranberries and took off the pico and added more pineapple. The result is fabulous. 

We were out celebrating and knew by coming here the kids would have a healthy option and great service-which we consistently get.  

We had a strawberry Presidente margarita and I highly recommend! It was soooooo good!

Also we ordered the margaritas and they weren't how the margaritas normally are in a margarita glass and they tasted like straight lemonade .. also we asked the manager guy if we could get new chips because the ones that came out were stale and cold and he just said they are all like this .. the actual manager man (Caucasian male heavy thick build) said that to us .. so we proceeded to leave and told him and he said well we can't do anything and antagonized us on the way out .. I just appreciate that if I am paying my money to come and eat and even with all the extras from the other employees including the bartender and we both did nothing but be patient and kind and then still get the treatment we received is ridiculous. The manager was completely out of pocket and rude for how he was talking to women let alone customers too.

The cheesecake here to be honest is the best cheesecake I've had that is inexpensive as well. Im a sucker for cheesecake. Especially if its with strawberries. Its really good stuff!",t_450bBsfT4gjs1j_EJ4Gw,0,0,5,fkVOm1v0McOyvBun4HAjRA

The girl who was ""manning"" the to go orders was extremely condescending. I had an e gift card and when presented to her. She stated that she needs to speak with her manager. She also proceeded to move my food away from me as if I was going to steal it! Wth??? I have $10 to pay for that sandwich..I assure you! I'm sorry if you are not familiar with an e gift card! Just the lack of professionalism and treating me like a criminal makes me not want to come back to this place! Wow! I tend to not go to chain restaurants because of this reason. They wonder why they are losing business. This is why! Hire a nicer staff!!!",_kdY4z_13H6O2R8NISNZ0w,2,0,2,FwTTHjnTJhIKH5IpOj893A

The last 3 times the food was good, our servers were friendly (although not particularly chatty), and we received our orders quickly. The last 3 times, though, we've also been greeted (if you could call it a greeting) and seated by the same hostess, and she (shorter girl with big, high bun) was awfully unpleasant. For example: tonight when we entered she just looked, grabbed menus and hardly asked, ""2?"" while motioning us over to a booth. She then sat us and walked away without another word. Later, I almost bumped into her on our way out and she just kept walking and muttered, ""bye"". 
While I don't expect spectacular service from a Chili's, the hostess' poor attitude is a big turn-off",PV6hZgncR6paO9IG-IdpOg,0,0,3,WwHXg-tPuwoeDKpC3ywQAA
5707491,2017-09-21,0,O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ,They drastically cut the menu and that sucks. I liked the more options and had to settle on something I didn't really want and end up not earing half of it. The kiosk machines are a pain in the butt to use. Server was nice but all over the place.,LSw5J-mDFXr75jmYmRnWow,0,0,3,Hut-AkJ_qe1CtRQHtFTaKQ
5845206,2016-01-29,0,O9LDS66IUKIBkGz_uFZKWQ,I've been coming here for a while can't believe I've never checked in. It's the kind of restaurant you can go in normal wear and eat fresh food. The wait staff is nice and I have also felt with the Togo side of it too. I hardly have to wait on my food. I prefer to sit on the bar side where setting is more relax. Prices are not bad. Haven't had one bad experience. Thanks guys,KJ0a-KChFN-SRZSJqZ04Wg,0,0,4,T_3CfBhzI_R9jH5P-ugUTA
