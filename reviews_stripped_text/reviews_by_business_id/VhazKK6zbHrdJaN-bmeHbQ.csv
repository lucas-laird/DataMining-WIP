700294,2015-02-25,0,VhazKK6zbHrdJaN-bmeHbQ,"They are known for their freaky fast service.  I work at the outlets, and I really wanted something more healthy than the options at the food court. I decided to order a sandwich Jimmy Johns. I ordered the country club. I skimmed the reading and thought I ordered turkey, bacon, and provolone cheese. Alas, it was ham. I'm not a huge fan of ham, but it was still a pretty tasty sandwich. I ordered the huge sandwich, and boy was it big. Next time I think I'll order a smaller sandwich or try the club lulu which is a blt with turkey. My sandwich came out to $6.50, and after tax and delivery fee it came out to $7.50. A bit pricier to get it delivered. 

It's a pretty decent price, but I don't know if it's worth it to get it delivered all the time. I'd rather save my money for something else. 

They were freakishly fast. I ordered my sandwich at about 5:10 and I got it about 10 to 15 minutes later. That is super fast!",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,0,0,4,QuW93HhDqndYFjp7g1-tYg

I'll be sure to come again to try this place out again. I will give it another chance because usually I have a good experience at Jimmy John's and their super fast service!",vhbyfj_g_YTjZGZh7tt5GA,0,0,3,u8HWqhQSKyE-WHOnpLBwxw

Standard JJ with the standard pricing, but there's nothing wrong with that.

Salute to those bike delivery guys, even if they don't go very far, doing that in the 105 degree weather for hours still ain't no easy dollar.",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,1,1,4,qrJogAvwG3j5KQGc2dGC8A

3333936,2016-11-19,1,VhazKK6zbHrdJaN-bmeHbQ,"Decided to cater lunch for some former coworkers while visiting Las Vegas. since this one was the closest to my former place of work  I chose this one for delivery. I made the order before they opened and noticed the receipt said ""pickup"". I called when they opened to inquire about delivery but was informed that their drivers are on bikes therefore couldn't deliver by ""the manager"" as she referred to herself. That was disappointing but was fine I told them I'd pick it up.  I was out meeting with family, since I was only in town for 24 hours on business, and figured I'd go after. I was less than a block away from picking up the order when I got a call from their condescending young manager rudely asking when I was picking up the order ""because it's been done for an hour and sitting"". I was in such shock as to how she was speaking to me, even my friend in the car heard (because of Bluetooth) and couldn't believe How rude she was.  Mind you, it was only about 11:00 am , just an hour after they opened. Clearly since I was assuming they could deliver via car like almost every other jimmy John it wouldn't be a problem to get it delivered so I started  running errands and was on the other end of town.  The manager , who was clearly very proud of her title, likely realized how rude she was & tried to recant and say ""I just wanted to know if I should put it in the fridge"". First off, why wasn't my order already in the fridge considering some of The sandwiches were Tuna?!"" I now live in Arizona and work at a law office down town and I use jimmy Johns a lot because of their delicious bread , fast delivery & customer service.  Thank goodness a different standard has been set out here because if this was my first experience I'd never use them again!

I didn't realize the guy making sandwiches behind the counter was listening when I placed my order and when my sandwich came up, I seriously thought it was for someone who ordered long before me. The three of us in our party were definitely impressed! My sandwich was not only out quickly, it was delicious. They offer self service fountain beverages and also serve fresh brewed iced tea. There is plenty of seating both indoors and out. I am definitely a fan and will return.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,4,3,4,Q7IwgkRnkEhOZwKToYOrdw

3385570,2015-11-07,0,VhazKK6zbHrdJaN-bmeHbQ,"Used to be 5 stars.  But lately they've been slacking. They never cut my sandwich in half like I request in the order but the last order was the worst.  I ordered a sandwich before closing (which I've done plenty of times before).  It takes 2 minutes to make the sandwich and 5 minutes to get here if that.  I've timed it before.  So this time I order and 5 minutes goes by.  Then 10. Then 20. 30 minutes later I go online to check my order and loe and behold it's been cancelled! But it's not the fact that they've cancelled it that upsets me, it's the fact that they didn't have the decency to call me or email me or anything!  They just cancelled it and that was that. 

UPDATE: The manager personally came to me and explained the situation about their entire system being down and he tried to contact me.  Very nice to see.",A9qy3Iy-a8dxmDn6Z9bdSA,2,1,4,9vwHT7ZCOF-2esvvrSqE1Q

Sandwich was prepared before I even had the opportunity to ask for cheese. I get the speedy service but I would rather good service then fast.

3416168,2017-07-31,1,VhazKK6zbHrdJaN-bmeHbQ,"First timer here.  So this place is okay if you want something quick and a sandwich.   Tried their #5 the Vito, which is an Italian Sub with genoa salami, Provolone cheese, capicola, held the onion, with lettuce, tomato and Italian vinaigrette and added some hot peppers which I am so glad I did.   The hot peppers gave help enhance the flavor of my sub.  The bread that it was in between reminded of an enhanced garlic bread from Olive Garden minus the garlic flavor and butter.  I don't know if having your bread toasted is an option but I kind of wish mine was.  Then it would have been perfect.  Other than that, this place isn't too bad.  The service in this place is super-fast!  I can say that I was out of there in less than 5 minutes.  Impressed.  Plus you had employees just ready to make an order for you.
