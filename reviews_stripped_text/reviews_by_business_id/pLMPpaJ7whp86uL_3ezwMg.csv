30137,2013-01-25,4,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"I have the incredible fortune of living in Las Vegas and dining at some of the best restaurants in the world.  Unfortunately, STRIPBURGER is not one of them.  

I ordered a beer, burger and fries as I sat at the bar.  The food was fine.  Not terrible.  Not phenomenal.  I would say acceptable. A little pricey, but everything on the LV strip tends to be a bit higher priced so no major surprises there.

At the end of the meal, the bartender gives my bill.   I submit my $15 off a $30 purchase coupon to her.  She rings the transaction on the cash register, I pay and she gives me my receipt. Right before I left, I told the bartender I would be back for another beer after I did some shopping in the adjoining mall.  

One hour later, I returned. I sat at the bar again with the same bartender.  I ordered another beer.  The price is $11.00 plus tax.  I lay my $10.00 off any purchase coupon on the bar along with two single $1.00 bills.  In Las Vegas, NV the state sales tax equals 8.1% of your total purchase price.  On an $11.00 purchase, the sales tax equals approximately .89 cents.  So the total of my beer should be $11.89.  This is where things start getting dicey. 

The bartender picks up my two single dollar bills along with my $10.00 coupon.  She immediately places the two $1.00 bills in her tip bucket.  She then proceeds to lay my $10.00 coupon on the top of her till drawer on the cash register and she completely fails to ring my beer purchase on the cash register.  I get no change and no receipt.  Meanwhile, the bartender has three separate girlfriends who visit her, on three separate occasions during my visit.  The bartender seems to be more interested in jawboning with her girlfriends then paying attention to doing her job and taking bar orders.  At one point, a gentleman on the other side of the bar actually yells ''Excuse me Miss, may I order a drink''.

By this point, I decide I am going to speak to the Manager about what I just witnessed in regards to the bartender failing to ring my transaction, return my change and provide me with a receipt.  I go into the restaurant and find the Manager named Scott.  I relate to him exactly what I have outlined here, and I describe in exact detail what the bartender did.  This Manager Scott, and I utilize that term loosely in this context, because Scott certainly did not behave like a Manager.  After I explain what I witnessed, he looks at me with this blank stare and says, ''I will go and get you your change right now''.  I explain to him, ''It's not about my .11 cents, It's about the principal of the matter.  Are you at all concerned that your bartender is taking cash that belongs in your cash register drawer and putting it in her tip bucket and failing to properly ring transactions?''  Scott immediately becomes defensive and very rude and states, ''Maybe she thought it was a tip.  Look, I don't understand what you are complaining about.  I offered to get your change and you refused.  I will have a conversation with her and that conversation is none of your business''.  I reply ''May I ask you a question, how come I did not receive a receipt for my beer purchase?''  Scott replies, ''It's our policy to only issue a receipt when requested to do so''.  
I reply....''WRONG!  I received a receipt 1 hour before from the same bartender for my lunch purchase, AND I DID NOT REQUEST IT!  So what is your receipt policy Scott?''  By this time Scott is becoming visibly agitated with me and again, in a very rude and condescending manner, ''Look I told you I would speak with her about it and you already said you don't want your change so what else is there to talk about.  At that point, I state, ''you know what, I'm done speaking with you, have a nice day"".  So I proceed to finish my beer and prepare to leave.  I glance down at the end of the bar and I notice manager Scott speaking to a well-dressed gentleman who just entered the restaurant, and I see Scott motion over to me, as if he is relating my story to this other gentleman.  

Next thing I know, this man comes up to me and Scott introduces him as Mr. Ross B, Vice president & Managing partner of the restaurant.  I'm naming this gentleman, because he requested that I do so when I told him he could read my review on YELP.    Mr. B. goes on to state that Scott told him about my experience.  A this point I inform Mr. B that Scott is very rude and spoke to me in a very condescending and unwelcomed tone of voice.  I went on to say that I was more than happy to speak with him, but I was done conversing with Scott and he could exit our conversation.  Scott leaves and goes back to work.  Mr. B. goes on to state that he had never known Scott to be rude.  I told him that he would probably be amazed at some of the behavior of his employees when he was not present at his restaurant.

161549,2011-11-14,1,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"I know I've been trying to avoid the touristy locations on the strip, but with all the meetings I have there it's too convenient to duck into something nearby and get back to the office. This is exactly what happened when I ventured into Stripburger the other day, and I'm glad I did. I'm starting to get very skeptical of restaurants in general located on the strip due to the fact that they don't really have to try and yet mass amounts of tourists will still flock to them, so I welcome the surprise.

Stripburger is unfortunately located on the corner sidewalk at the Fashion Show Mall across the street from the Wynn hotel. Parking is typically atrocious at the mall, but pretty much your only option unless you happen to be walking down the sidewalk in this area. There's a 99% chance you are not. What I didn't know until I arrived is that the restaurant is entirely outdoors; this is horribly inconvenient in the dead of summer, and potentially not great either come January. I suppose the awnings might help a bit in the summer although based on experience not too much, and the heat lamp that was placed directly behind me more than made up for the fact that it was overcast and maybe 55 degrees the day I was there.

Surprisingly there are several burgers to choose from on the menu, along with a slider option, a turkey burger and a veggie burger that my friend hesitantly ordered in front of me. They also offer shakes, salads, a bunch of chicken sandwiches and some other items. Plus, since this is an outdoor bar/restaurant right on the sidewalk, a large collection of cocktails are also available. I was in the mood for something simple and went with a classic cheeseburger and fresh cut fries. I quickly got worried when not only did the guy next to me get the wrong order, but when our food came out they also brought me the wrong burger. I was left with that bad situation of having fries and no burger, and the person I was eating with had their food. Luckily mine came out only a minute or two later.

The burger itself doesn't look like anything special; a decent plain bun, melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes pickles and mayo. What surprised me was how well it tasted, the meat was cooked perfectly, and had great flavor with a hint of some pepper which I liked. It was juicy but not overly messy, dripped just a bit and left a small puddle on the plate yet the meat still maintained its moisture until the end. The pickles had good flavor, the bun was buttery, and was just the right ratio to the amount of meat. It tasted great and I was happy.

The fries could have been perfect too, but I think we got a mix of old and new so some were soft and great, while others were a bit hard and stale. I think it was also scooped from the bottom as we had a lot of small pieces in the bowl. Still they were quite good, maybe a bit too salty but I really liked their overall flavor and were quite bountiful.

The price was about what one could expect for being located on the strip, I think if it were more of a local's spot I'd have more of a problem spending around $30 for two burger meals. The location isn't ideal, but if you're already over there or don't mind going near the strip as much as I do then it's definitely worth the visit.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,0,4,mb0mjKB6_IqYIWWHtUxCGg

218592,2011-05-11,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"I went to Vegas for the first time this past weekend and I had heard good things about this restaurant. It was a toss-up between here and Burger Bar, but I went with this one.

I sat at the bar and ordered the Southwest Burger because I wanted the chipotle mayo. It's toppings were listed as pepper jack cheese and chipotle mayo. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and an Orange Whip alcoholic beverage. 

The burger was mediocre at best. I didn't taste any Southwestern flavors and the cheese was bland as well. The chipotle mayo was good, but the flavor was not strong enough, which is the reason I got the burger in the first place. There was nothing spectacular about the burger whatsoever. I could've had a V8, as the commercial goes. However, the sweet potato fries were to die for! I loved them and couldn't stop eating them and had I known better, would have just ordered an order of those and skipped the burger. They were hot, sweet potato-y and had salt (sea salt or other large-grain salt) on them. The salt was almost too much....almost. They came with this BBQ-like sauce that complemented them so well. Yumm! I'm having flashbacks! The Orange Whip beverage had a great taste, but a little more alcohol would've ramped it up tremendously. It's also pretty pricey. I had a burger, sweet potato fries and a 16 oz. alcoholic beverage for $28, not exactly cheap and not worth it either!

The service was not great. I sat at the bar, the bartender took my order, someone else brought out my food and the bartender didn't ask me about another thing until she saw my napkin on the plate and then gave me the check. I'm sure they're not that concerned with the service with where it's located, but the service could have been much better. 

The only reason I gave this restaurant two stars was for the sweet potato fries. Those were the only redeeming qualities of this experience. I only ever go back for the fries and skip the burger.",J9oESwNof9liosP83oEKNw,0,0,2,qg2D8k8C-jbSs5XqosGsxg

However, I can't recommend this place as the service is simply awful.  We saw our waitress twice - once when she took our order and finally a long time later when we paid.  Someone else delivered our drinks and our food.  The server never came back to see how our food turned out or needed more to drink.  She was rarely out in the dining area, and when she was, she was taking an order from what had to be more than a dozen tables she appeared to be working.  I finally had to flag her down long after we had finished eating to get the bill.  I don't know when she would have gotten around to checking on us if I hadn't.  Never a word of explanation, so I have to assume this was a normal night.
Overall, while the food was decent and the location was nice, this place just isn't worth the hassle.

Sure, you could go to the food court, where a $3 Wendy's hamburger costs $5. You could go to Panda Express and get some Chinese-flavored food. Or, you could go outside and get something a lot better for just a little bit more. Stripburger's a small, upscale outdoor hamburger stand. It's waited service, and there's a full bar. Burgers will run you $6-$9, side dishes like fries will add another $3-$6. Definitely a good alternative if you're starving and don't want to drop a $20 on lunch. Unfortunately, the smallest order of fries will most likely be too much for one person, so bring a friend to share.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,0,0,4,d5Et54Td29T5dzU14n1V6g

Service- Service was 5 stars for my first visit. My server's name was Christina, and she was very upbeat, friendly, and personable.

First, they over cooked my first burger. I would never have known this accept our server came out to apologize for it taking so long and explained that they were making a new one for me. Some may complain about this but to me that is a sign of top notch service. When they don't let food leave the kitchen until it right is how it should always be. I'll happily wait if it means I get what I ordered.

Second, when we ordered my wife's meal we asked for 1 of the mini cheeseburger sliders since her stomach was not up for a full size meal, but they brought us the 3 slider meal. Without a word from us the waiter came and pointed out the mistake and made it right on the bill so we were only charged for the single.

Before you start planning to eat here, please note that if you go to www.restaurant.com you can purchase a coupon which allows you to have a portion of your bill taken off if you spend ""x"" amount of dollars - - AND THIS INCLUDES ALCOHOL! That's the only reason this place was considered prior to our group taking the trip to Vegas. Our coupon was a $100 gift certificate for $200 (or more) of food and drink.

So now for the food.....it was.....well, good! Quite a few of us had the turkey burger (we added guacamole). There was nothing super extravagant about it, but it was definitely a good turkey burger. Our table had the trifecta of fries: fresh-cut, garlic herb, and sweet potato. The sweet potato fries were the only ones that did not get devoured. They just didn't work for us. Kinda gross actually. A few of us actually went back the next day for late night eats. I had the Ahi Tuna burger. Good and unique tasting, but that's all. Just....good.

Now, if you're a drinker you might have came to the right place! The Jumbo Cocktails will get you where you need to go....if you're choosing to go ""there"" (this is where the restaurant.com coupon really comes in handy). They come in 16 and 32oz. mason jars. The 32oz. Tableside Margarita won't disappoint you! Also, be careful! Some of the people in our party had some drinks that were not too tasty. I'm not sure which ones they are, but get a quick taste before your waiter/waitress leaves the table in case you need to send it back and order something else.

533534,2014-11-01,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"I love this place!!  I currently live in Hawaii and travel to the mainland a lot for work (and for fun).  I always stop in Vegas to break up the trip (horrible flyer) and though I stumbled upon this little gem while staying at the Trump, I now make it a point to stop in even if I am staying at the opposite end of the strip.  Here is why:

a) the food is great!  While this isn't a 5 star restaurant inside of a 5 star hotel, it is a burger and shake place that is really really good at what they specialize in!  I think I have tried every burger on the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet.

b) the price-  They have a great happy hour--- even still, I am almost always there before it starts and it doesn't even bother me because prices are so reasonable.  And the burgers are huge- you get what you pay for

c) location- I actually love that it isn't right smack in the middle of the strip.  It is close enough to be convenient and walking distance regardless of where you are staying, but not as in your face as all those restaurants lined up on the strip with people bombarding you with flyers offering drink specials to lure you in.  There is a lot of hustle and bustle in that area and its nice to be able to get a mini break from that (and its all outside too which is nice).

d) service-  this was really the best part for me. As someone that has worked in the industry for years in the past, I am extremely lenient when it comes to sub-par service as I know what it feels like to be on the other side of that especially when it is extremely busy or you are down a server, etc.  I always try to be polite and understanding regardless.  But, on the flip side- bartending/serving in high-volume restaurants for so many years has also allowed me to know an amazing bartender/server when I see one.  And let me tell you, the bartender here is one of the best there is.  I travel solo a lot so really the only people I come in contact with outside of work are those in the service industry.  I try to follow their lead and if they are busy I just focus on my food/drinks and if they are friendly and not slammed, I make a new pseudo friend for a few minutes.  I was extremely impressed with Rebecca (I think that is her name- it is the name on my receipt but sometimes bartenders share registers-- she is the lunch bartender-- I usually go on monday or tuesday when I am in vegas).  She is sweet as pie and sociable but still really aware of her surroundings and attentive; super fast and knows her stuff.  Its not uncommon to find a funny and likeable bartender or an extremely fast and skillful one- but in my experience it is very rare to find someone that is both!  In this industry people often work their butts off and do not always get the recognition they deserve...  so I decided to take a few minutes to make sure that doesn't happen here!  She is by far one of my favorites...and I travel a lot.

Overall, I love this place and look forward to going back on my next vegas trip!  Oh, and in case you guys didn't know... you can take alcohol to go and walk down the strip with it!  I discovered this while here and thought it was awesome....and crazy.  So obviously I ordered an alcoholic milkshake to go!  And... I suggest you do the same. stat.",kHfEKoe3Y2ZgcrJNs4761Q,0,0,5,Fo8XnLeXRdZ1cA8g8ciG0w

557414,2012-01-11,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"Burgers, shakes, an awesome seat on the Las Vegas Strip. What more can you ask for? Nothing, I say. Strip Burger is located at the North end of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip. Most of the seating is outdoors with a great view of the Wynn and Encore hotels. There is some seating inside for the colder months we have here in Vegas, so don't worry about the weather if you want to stop in for some great American fare.

Strip Burger has the usual drink selection of soft drinks and beers. Something there to satisfy any thirst. But if you want something more that just something to drink, Strip Burger also has a homemade shake. The shakes come in several flavors such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cookies & cream. Each shake is so creamy and flavorful you will be asking if free refills are provided. No they are not. I was saddened at this. If you need something to cool you off when the weather is a bit hotter I can guaranty a Strip Burger Shake will hit the spot. Give it a try and you will see for yourself.

If fresh cut fries are your thing, make your way to Strip Burger. Their fries have a great potato taste, are perfectly cooked and just lightly salted with a coarse salt. They also offer sweet potato fries and one of my favorite things, fried onion strings. The onion strings are like onion rings, but they are not greasy and they are thin and crunchy. A real taste treat.

A Strip Burger burger may not be Angus Beef, but Angus is not always the only choice for a really good burger. The beef used in their burger is flavorful, juicy and keeps it's form well. The burger seems to be a third pound. The bun is soft, tasty and holds the burger very well. They do their burger several different ways all providing a flavor sensation in your mouth. I get the bacon cheddar burger now when I go. The bacon has a bit of a crunch to it but is not overcooked. The cheddar is nice and thick and complements the beef nicely. When you bite into your burger for the first time the juices flow and the meat provides a nice texture and flavor. This is not the best burger I have ever had, but it is very close.

Some restaurants can have bad days. Both in service and food quality. Strip Burger has had neither when I have been there. The servers and very friendly and are always there when you need something.

Stripburger is located on the Strip in Fashion Show Mall at the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Desert Inn.  

Customer Service:
Stripburger's customer service is excellent!  Our server was extremely pleasant and a few other employees even stopped by our table to ask about our experience.  I love great customer service and this restaurant definitely offers that!

Selection:
My party ordered the Classic Hamburger, Green Chili Burger (with pepper jack cheese) and Threesome Fries (regular fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries) to share.  I've been to a few burger joints and think that the burger patties here are merely average-tasting, nothing special.  The burger patties (and texture) sort of tasted like Smashburger's.  The sweet potato fries were delicious.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant décor was trendy and the ambiance matched its décor.  The restaurant has outdoor seating (perfect for people-watching) with heat lamps.

Aged 24-25, we were anticipating a REALLY wild weekend full of hot people, and hot clubs... hot music, hot gambling, great food, great drinks.... and guess what, we were disappointed.  Despite my disillusionment  with Las Vegas as a bona fide Disneyland for adults (more like Wally World, I think) I have at least one good thing to bring away from my trip that I can recommend to other travelers, locals, or disillusioned 25 year old women:  Stripburger.  There are a few reasons that I decided to give a little place like Stripburger in Las Vegas five stars: 

1) Location.  Stripburger was right across from our hotel, on the ground level.  Easy access from the street, with patio seating to people watch on the Vegas strip. 

2) GREAT HAPPY HOUR.  We actually had food and drinks NOT during happy hour, and it was good.  But the happy hour was really great.  Not only is it 4-7 pm EVERY DAY (yes, including Sat/Sun), but they have a straight across $2 menu that includes drinks and food.  I have to recommend the margaritas, which are a good size for the money, and which taste like margaritas, not a melted lemon-lime Otter pop.  Very cheap and fun way to party before heading out for the night. 

3) Service was great.  Our lunch waitress and our happy hour staff were all amazing, friendly and attentive.

I ordered the mini burger sampler with the blue cheese burger, the whisky bbq burger and the cheddar burger. The bf and I split the strings & fries, and I got a margarita. 

Burgers: Delicious! I ordered them cooked medium well, but I couldn't tell the difference between mine and my bf's, who ordered his medium... But that was ok. They were definitely juicy and flavorful! The bun is slightly sweet, and the blue cheese is more of a spread-- but was very tasty and added just the right amount of kick. The tomatoes were diced, which was an added bonus (I really don't like the gooey seed part of the tomato!)

Strings & Fries: Both were delicious. I favored the strings, but I'm glad we got both, they balanced each other out well. 

Margarita: One of the best I've had in a LONG time! I'd rate it pretty strong, but definitely very tasty. 

Ambiance: This is an outdoor/open air restaurant, and we visited at night (on the 4th of July) so the strip was hopping. It was also fairly warm 93 at 11:30pm, but the temp felt great with the fans running. I'd recommend an evening visit--the lights from the strip were great, and the heat wasn't as bad as it could be. 

Value: This is where I take it down to 4 stars. I'd say it's a little spendier than similar burger places, with the fries being ala carte. But we had a deal from travel zoo, which made it super affordable! Check out the deal if still available-- 2 people each get an entree, 1 side and 2 drinks each for 1/2 price.

My brother and I  were reminiscing and decided to grab dinner there tonight. I was pleased to see they still had the atomic fries on the menu. I recall them being delicious. They were still good, but I missed the heavy hand of jalapenos. These were pretty sparse. I ordered the jalapeno popper burger and he couldn't choose between the BBQ Whiskey burger or the Blue burger so he opted for the sampler of three sliders so he could try them both. He also got a shake since he used to love it. The burgers should have been prepared medium, they were medium well at best. The buns were dry, the meat crumbled. The fried cheese on my burger tasted like flour and grease. I pulled it off so it would be edible. His BBQ burger came with mayo and really threw off the flavor. At least, the shake was decent.

The waitress never asked how our meal was, but she was pretty prompt refilling drinks and taking our order. $40 later, we were wishing we went to In & Out and bought doubles for everyone in line.

I was shopping Macy's going-out-of-business sale and unlike most females, I just hate to shop.  But when it comes to cocktail dresses for $9, I finally give in.  After spending several tedious hours trying on clothes, I need nourishment before heading to work.  In a moment of weakness, I stroll through the food court, but who am I kidding?  I hate food courts and even in a nicer mall like the Fashion Show, the outlets all offer the same junk.
So now I am torn between Maggiano's and Stripburger.  After browsing both menus, I choose the latter.  It is a gorgeous day and Stripburger has all outdoor seating right on the strip.
All of their burgers are $8.95-$9.95.  The fries are not included.  The drink menu looks tempting, but like I said, I am headed to work soon, so I settle for something from the Lake Mead region.
My burger comes in less than 15 minutes and is cooked exactly as ordered.  The accompaniments (roll, tomato, etc.) are all fresh and this is a very good burger.  
Would I make a trip to the strip just to eat here?  Probably not.  But I would definitely come back should I be caught hungry in that area again and maybe next time I can sample some of their adult beverages.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,1,0,4,42PuVOnu4m07EwcmjoDAaA

I work in Fashion Show Mall, and my store receives a 1 hour lunch break.  Getting a burger, drink, and check in this amount of time is extremely difficult for the servers at Stripburger.  I've had a bit better luck at the bar, but the table service servers over a three year period have really just not gotten it together.

I'm pretty sure my trip today was our last.  We had to find a waitress three times.  Once, a drink was just subpar.  The second time was to replace the cold french fries that were delivered to the table.  The third was to get the check.

We poured our own water glasses as we were lucky to be sat next to the hostess stand where they keep pitchers for the waitresses.  I just stood up and grabbed glasses and poured them.

Green chili burger wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  Oh, and be forewarned - the menu may show the toppings but fail to also state that EVERY burger comes with tomato, lettuce, and mayo.  I had to get a second bottom bun to get rid of the nastiness of mayo.

Friends ordered a Jack Arnold Palmer.  Don't bother.  The Jack Daniels was a short shot on the bottom of an Arnold Palmer, not mixed, and doesn't mix in well.

Friends also ordered the cheese fries.  Be forewarned: there may be shredded cheddar on top, but it's a velveta like sauce under it.  Didn't taste great.

Long and short, you're on the strip.  There's better food.  There are definitely better burgers in Vegas (usually off strip, burgers are kinda the food around here for some reason.)  Don't bother with this place.",_5tVs8qUE-HgcpDmWO3Vtw,3,0,2,f_1BrKZl87sOLzI5eG4X8Q

For $20 - i get the cheeseburger sliders, the onion strings and a blue moon draft.  i asked if they had chocolate malts - nope - shakes, no malts !!  these places are starting to piss me off !!

the sliders - decent - but the key is if you like that gas grill taste in the meat - for some strange reason, i like that taste ( same as the charcoal lighting fluid -infused taste ) - but overall, pretty basic slider.  the onion strings - good stuff !!  put some of them on the sliders - great idea !!  but let me tell ya a huge basket for $3.95 - that's a great deal !  have you ever noticed how much onion rings are as a side item at a restaurant ?  even denny's cost more than $3.95 and those things BITE !

and let me tell ya - the blue moon - heavenly !!  i'm sweating like a pig at that bar and to get an ice cold blue moon ale in a frosty pint - people, this is what life is all about !

It is a bunch of chain stores and tacky shops thrown together in a flying saucer looking building.  Nothing about the place says Fashion, Show, or Mall.

But anyway...Stripburger.  Right across from Wynn...or Encore...whichever one that is.  Sit outside and you can see Trump Casino in the distance.  Horrible service but the food was decent.  It is relatively cheap.  Good news is usually the service is so horrific that you will not feel bad about not leaving a tip.  So...cheap food and no tip should be in your budget. 

Here is a tip though...it is not a good place to get drunk because it is at a major intersection.  If you get hit there will be nothing but a blood and margarita mixed smear on the ground with an imprint of Penn & Teller advertising.",1IMyRISO6_VgWA2GamCw5w,0,0,2,a3IizVlkyb8rqI6HaV-hpg

2 pm, rolled out of bed and walked across the street to stuff burgers in my face and get ready for Vegas Round Dos.  I must have needed to stay in bed a little longer because I ordered the shrimp bucket (SICK) thinking it was ""just what I wanted"".  It was so gnarly when it came.. the shrimp weren't cleaned, cooked, or edible, but I decided I came this far and I'd give it a go.  GOO!  They tasted even crazier than they looked and when I sent the dish back the waiter made a good point - why would I order fish in the middle of the desert?  While this was thought-provoking and very true, I have always believed that restaurants should stand behind everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on their menus.  Thus I am giving Stripburger two stars for making me want to commit suicide over a bucket of shrimp, while taking my own responsibility for ordering the most repulsive thing offered and giving them the benefit of the doubt..

He told me to order at the bar.

I went to the bar, and the bartender there told me to order from the waiter.

I went back to the waiter who told me that it was too late to order food, and then he went to another table, and took their food order.

I went back to the bar (it's now after 11PM) and tried to get a beer.
She said that last call had already happened.

I tried to be polite when I told her my opinion of her unannounced last call and the complete waiter fail. She grudgingly  agreed to put in an order for me.

I agree with  Jonathan Z and say that they are about the same league as Red Robin.  They have really good selection of burgers for decent prices. The burger patty isn't anything fancy here, just your typical ground beef patty.  Don't expect any kobe beef or wagyu beef patty here.  

Last time we came here for lunch, I got the green chili burger which I really enjoyed and the BF got the mexicali burger.  The only downside that I would have to say about their burgers is that it get soggy really fast.  I don't know if it's the grease or sauce they put in the burgers but even after like 30 minutes, my burger would start breaking apart.  But still good nonetheless!

My favorite here is their garlic herb fries.  A great addition to get for your burgers.  Skip the atomic cheese fries.  Too messy and not all that great.

Great atmosphere bar w/ TV's & a view of the Wynn, their new construction 2.27.17 & traffic.  

To start I had the Roasted Turkey Chopped Salad $10.95 w/ a glass of Chardonnay.  It had blue cheese, date-glazed bacon, apples, grapes, avocado, chunks of cheddar & some very salty roasted turkey.  I ate the cheddar separately cause it went better w/ the wine.  The avocado, green apples & grapes I thought would cut the salt, but it didn't.  I would not recommend this unless they replaced the salty turkey, otherwise it would've been a fantastic salad. 

For our lunch entree we had the Mini Burger Sampler $11.95 which included a nice variety... the Blue Cheese Burger was good & moist, the Whiskey BBQ Burger was also nice, both had fried onion strings.  The Cheddar Burger we ordered w/ veggies on the side & all three mini burgers we had were well-done, perfectly & juicy!  After trying these three, I would recommend the Famous Blue Cheese Burger!

I will be back to try the fire coffee, vodka shake & sriracha fries all on the Specials Menu.  Also since I love spicy, the Mexican Burger... Yum!

Being hungry and a bit cranky we decided to go somewhere before I got to the ""Feed me now or it's off with your head"" stage. Lo and behold a burger joint across the street! 

Stripburger is an all-outdoor eatery with shaded tables and of course: full bar. The friendly hostess greeted & seated us quickly. Scanning the menu, two things quickly caught my eye: the green chile cheeseburger and the pickle fries. H ordered the hickory burger and my mother settled on the daily special which was the bacon cheeseburger with small fries. We ordered a side of fries (the burgers do not come with a side). 

The pickle ""fries"" came out first but were actually chips instead of spears. I was expecting spears and prefer them over the chips but these fried sour pickle chips were pretty darn good! I have come to the conclusion that the best pickle to batter and fry is the good old sour dill. Sliced thin and coated with a light crispy batter, these pups didn't last long. 

Our burgers arrived and Whoa Nellie are they huge! My burger was laden with roasted Hatch green chiles, melted pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce and onions. The burger was thick, juicy and full of flavor. Grilled to perfection and served piping hot once I picked it up it never kissed the plate again. Fries? What fries. I was too busy with my burger. I did manage to try one and it was a-ok. But really you don't need no stinkin' fries! H declared his burger superior to the Cheeseburger in Paradise found you-know-where.

On top of that there were foreigners who sat next to us and she yelled at them because they had trouble understanding her. She snatched the menus out of their hand and stormed off with their order. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!! Her tip reflected her ATTITUDE. Please avoid her she is blond and wears a hat.

Food was ok, nothing spectacular. I ordered a regular cheeseburger medium rare. It was nice and bloody but not really seasoned. It was just AVERAGE. I have tasted better. It cost $9. I had a beer (BUD LIGHT) which was $2 because of happy hour. My gf had nachos which were decent but still had no WOW factor.

She got us water and let us browse the menu for a bit. When she came back, we ordered the guac and chips, blue cheese burger, and the Mexican burger. I asked her what was a sweet and not too strong drink and she recommended the ""ticke me pink"" which I agreed to. My drink came out in about 2 minutes or so in a mason jar which I thought was pretty cute. It was also really good. 
The chips and guac came out first and was amazing, but also super filling. We decided not to eat all of it so we could finish our burgers. Our burgers arrived. Mine was the Mexican burger, my boyfriend had the bleu cheese burger. Both were really good, we finished it all. Our waitress kept checking on us and refilling out water during our time there, and was always really positive and smiley when she came to us so it was a good experience. Our total bill came out to almost $50, but with the coupon we only wound up paying $23 or so.

Great food, great service. I'm coming back again the next time I visit Vegas.",YiVN1r0cQRlOs0FLHkYm6Q,0,0,5,iz_rTbFIY3Pq5D3PgQ0L2A

We sat outside and it was a chilly October evening. It was nice to take in the sites and people watch but at times it became loud because of traffic and I understand it's the Strip, but there were constant sirens going off from emergency vehicles attending to situations at nearby resorts. I didn't think about that possibility until it was happening and we both found ourselves wishing that we had picked indoor seating instead.

Service was fast and friendly. Our fries came out super quick, but burgers took awhile. My friend had the wagyu burger and finished the whole thing, even with her small appetite, so I'm guessing it was pretty good. Haha. I had the slider sampler trio. It was good and I especially enjoyed the slider with the mushroom and bleu cheese, which surprised me because on previous occasions at other restaurants, I haven't enjoyed those things. My biggest complaint though is that the burgers were soooooo greasy and salty. My stomach was aching and I was feeling sick after only the first slider. We had a side of sweet potato fries which were served with some type of smoky sauce which was a good combination. We also had a side of garlic fries which I recommend 100% they captured the true garlic taste and it didn't taste artificial like most places.

It's mostly outdoor seating and it's kind of towards the back of fashion show. Just in case anyone has trouble finding it because I did!

If you like spicy dips, get the ""chewey"" dip. Not sure what's in there but it has a sharp punch that leaves you wanting water asap.  Those who can't handle spicy foods need not to try.

WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW... BUT I SURE AS HELL GOING TO TRY....

Tonight we decided to have a family outing of shopping and dinner at Fashion Show Mall, however, what started out as a great time quickly turned into an amazingly bad experience thanks of course to the HORRIFYINGLY BAD service at Strip Burger.

First off, it took your hostess 15 minutes to have us seated at a table, BUT THERE WERE EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED!!!  It took her so long to come back to us that we contemplated on just getting a To-Go order, BUT (TO NO) SURPRISE, THERE WASN'T ANYONE THERE TO EVEN HELP US PUT IN AN ORDER!.

Luckily (or not), this ""hostess"" finally finds a table (again.... EMPTY TABLES EVERYWHERE) for us to sit in and a server takes our order.  Now, I ordered the new Velveeta Burger which had a simple ingredients - Burger with Velveeta with onion strings and Russian dressing.  Simple enough right?  But I got what looked like a regular burger with Russian dressing - NO ONION STRINGS.  NOW.... before you say I overreacted and should have just sent it back.... I say, ""I WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK HAD THEY ACTUALLY COME BACK TO CHECK IF EVERYTHING.... OR ANYTHING WAS OKAY!""... but she never came back... not for anything.. not even to check to see if we needed a napkin...

Mind you, I was trying to be calm about this (pardon my language) whole fucking situation, but what sent me over the edge was that, my family had finished their dinner (I was just too pissed to eat) and we waited patiently for our server to come back because we wanted to place an order to-go for my little brother that was studying at home for his midterms.... we waited.......and waited.... and waited.... AND WAITED.... until I had enough and had to go hunt her ass down to tell her I wanted to place a to-go order and the check!

AND THEN WE WAITED.... only to be sent a different server to take our order (MAYBE OUR ORIGINAL WAITRESS WAS SCARED -- AND WITH GOOD REASON!)

I have never had an issue with this place before.... in fact, I loved coming here with friends and our past experiences here had been awesome... But truth be told, I'm just over it now -- I don't think I will be coming back here any time soon.... or bringing people here to dine any time soon....

Your service at Strip Burger was impeccably bad that I would have rather gone through a Burger King drive-thru .... At least I would have gotten my food as well as my check in a timely and less frustrating manner than what your SORRY EXCUSE for a wait-staff you had tonight had given us!  If I ever do come back here, I will definitely make sure that I come when your A-squad is working and not your D-squad... although, why should I take the chance again?  It was truly insufferable.

I do hope you enjoyed the note that I wrote at the bottom of the check.  PLEASE.... DO reflect on that message.... and YES... I did spell out the gratuity for you in perfect English -- Z-E-R-O.",rQi9YMJQbXCEOeI7sauVBw,2,0,1,eEJwjVpXZ_ckr7JAJOf1LA

After a day of shopping and having not eaten much of anything since we woke up, myself, my wife, and my friends decided we HAD to try this place out (It was recommended to my friend by a coworker of his). We sit down and order our drinks while we decide what's for lunch. Our waitress brings us only 2 waters even though there was 4 of us. They don't even have ice or the lemon we requested. We wait for her to return to ask for both straws and 2 more waters. We finally have to ask another waitress for both.

2:50 p.m.

Our waitress returns and takes our orders. Me, my friend, and his gf order burgers and cheese fries. My wife orders a bacon ranch salad. I also ordered an Oreo shake.

3:20p.m.

Our food arrives; delivered by a server. . We all want ranch sauce, but we haven't had our waitress come by since we ordered. 

3:40ish

Still no sign of our waitress or my shake. I finally have to ask for ranch from a server. My food is pretty good. My wife's salad however, has sand in it. She's disgusted. I ask to speak with the a supervisor, since I've been starting to get pissed off with this whole experience. He comes out, sees us, yet incredulously decides it's more important to talk to his friends, who are seated at a nearby table, about what they're doing today/tonight. He finally comes over to our table and I explain that her salad has sand in it. He insincerely apologizes and leaves with the salad. 

3:50p.m. 

Fed up with the whole not being served, I FIND my waitress who's hidden down by the bar. Before I can even say anything to her, she blurts ""my manager is taking care of everything."" WTF! All I wanted to tell her is that I don't want either the shake that I have yet to receive or the sand salad remake. 

3:52p.m. 

The manager comes out with both my shake and my wife's salad. I tell him to take them off our bill and that we didn't want them. He tried to tell us that it wasn't sand, it was finely ground pepper. BULLSHIT! I think my wife can tell the difference. Does pepper grind in your teeth like eating a sandwich when you're at the beach? NO!

4:06p.m. 

Our waitress decides she wants to give us our bill. I pay and tip a red cent. Worst service ever! From the top down, it's very unprofessional. I hate complaining, but seriously, it took over an hour just to see our waitress again and I was the one who had to hunt her down.

Before I lived in Vegas I came here for vaca and stayed at the Trump. I ended up eating here like 5 times over the course of 6 or 7 days. If I am not going to ball it up at a michelin star place, its pretty tough to beat strip burger. 

It has a great location- right outside Fashion Show on the corner with the Wynn- good for people watching and sitting outside. 

A few notes on the food

Sweet potato fries- amazing. They come dusted with a large grain sugar which is good in and of itself, but they also come with FRY SAUCE. For those of you who don't know, fry sauce is a mixture of BBQ sauce and manaise (or aoli) and is delicious. The fry sauce at SB is 10/10 and on the sweet potato fries is incredible. Other than the SP fries at Burgr (that come with a can of vanilla powdered sugar) there is nothing even close in Vegas that can compete with SB.

The Shakes- are VERY thick like a shake could be. Very good. But here is the little detail that pushes them over the edge into super amazing- I always get oreo shakes and at SB they give you a straw that is about 3x as wide as a regular straw so it never clogs with cookie pieces/you can just suck them right up. I have since seen this other places but when I first went to SB 8 years ago I was super impressed with this obviously simple innovation.


Guac- is very good. I assume it comes from El Segundo Sol (the mexican restaurant right next to SB that is owned by the same group but SUUUUUUCKS) and it is very good. 

Chicken wings- these are often on special as an appetizer and are very good for a non dedicated wing place. 

The Burgers

I generally get the southwest burger as my go to- it is awesome. The meat is always cooked right- never over cooked.  Other burgers I have enjoyed are the occasional ""little kid"" burger they have on special- it comes with like velveeta cheese on top etc. as you used to eat as a kid. The blue cheese burger is also pretty good. The Tuna burger has been a favorite of people I have been there with if you aren't into beef.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,4,4,5,n2RN79E7Z4gK4y-L06Fsfg

I am sure I've had a burger as good as this one before, but I'm also sure I haven't had one better.

My wife had the turkey burger. I expected ground turkey meat, but it was really a turkey breast sandwich, and she loved it. She was trying to eat ""healthier,"" but craving a burger so she thought this would be a good compromise. After she tasted it, she said it was not a compromise, it was a great burger. 

I had the bleu cheese burger, and it was cooked perfectly (medium, as ordered) and every bite was delicious. 

We shared an order of garlic fries. They were very good, and the dipping sauce was a nice complement to them. We both agreed we'd have liked the fries a little crispier but they were not soggy or undercooked by any means.

The portions are huge, which brings me to the fries. We each ordered our own and couldn't finish them because one is enough to feed two people. These fries are not your typical fries. I could've eaten those alone and been happy. They are definitely gourmet. We ordered the sweet potato fries and the garlic and herb... Oh my goodness!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about them.

YUM!  This place is great for people watching.  It's right on the strip (outside only entrance from the Fashion Show Mall) and across the street from the Wynn.  Great location.

Started with 2 shakes:
-Strawberry Shake: husband got this.  He loved it.
-Cookies n' Cream Shake- delicious!  so good!

Main Order:
-Blue Cheese Burger: I think this what they are know for.  My husband LOVED it.  He said it was probably the best burger he has ever had. (and that is saying alot!) He said it was cooked perfect (medium) and he said the blue cheese with the onion straws were perfect.  Not too much and it was blue cheese crumbles, that melt onto the burger. (when you go to their website: http://lasvegasstripburger.com, the burger is the picture they have on there)
-Veggie Burger: the best I have ever had!  Very moist, almost fell apart, but oh so good!  I would definitely get it again!
-Fries: Their fries are enough for like 3 people.  They are really good!  You can tell they cut them in-house, with the skin on.  They taste really great!

Just a great place to go and hang out.  During the spring/summer I am sure this place is SLAMMED!  It was a 60 degree day yesterday and they were busy.  Can't wait to go back and have some drinks too!

We actually went to the mall looking for another restaurant. Once we discovered that the other restaurant was gone, we decided to try this one. And we were pleased with our choice!

My wife had the Ahi tuna burger and said it was great, tasting like a sushi burger. I decided to try the southwest burger. The chipotle mayo was a nice addition. 

It is important to note that all items are a la carte. So, fries or other sides are ordered in addition to the burgers. This does inevitably increase the total bill a bit.

The service was good. The waitress had tried most of the items and was able to provide good recommendations. The food arrived rather quick, but not too quick to make you doubt the ""made to order"" status.

Shortly into our meal, however, another waiter was walking past with a platter of food. He lost his balance and spilled a couple full plates at our feet. There was sauce and ceramic all over the place. Somehow, most of the mess seemed to avoid our feet. We were not upset, we know accidents happen after all. However, you could tell that the staff was troubled. A manager came by to check on us a couple of times. We repeatedly said that everything was fine, no worries. At the end, our waitress informed us that our fries were being comped by the restaurant. When I got the bill, I also saw that our drinks were covered as well. A nice surprise. Quality service.

The location for the restaurant is great for people watching. It is right on the corner of the Fashion Show mall. If you sit outside, you can watch the cars and people move down the Strip.

Garlic fries are separately ordered and were huge.. Couldn't finish them between the two of us 
Drinks are incredible. Spiked shakes and cocktails are made to perfection 
The only catch is that this is only an outside patio sort of place, that can be inconvenient to some, but today worth it in my opinion.
Overall, a must go on the strip.",d7-lR_jIaLncQOdDCmvY5Q,1,0,5,faPDlB56MGR-a74pvWl0kg

My wife and I first shared the Nachos Fries. Pretty big plate of fresh fries and lots of toppings. A good start.

A good solid burger and bun. Actually  3 burgers -  we split the sampler trio. All good flavors. Probably a little overcooked. Added bacon without regret. 

We each had an adult shake and slurped them down lo problem. Both were excellent: The Dreamsicle & Salted Caramel. My wife was crazy for the Dreamsicle shake. I went back a few days later just to get the Tres Leches shake - 5 stars!
Excellent service.

The burgers are the bomb, and I got my garlic fries which were yummy. Sitting outside was nice especially since the weather was nice. Didn't realize until later that they had dinning inside as well which is good to know for our future visit. This will indeed be a favorite stop for us to eat whenever we visit Vegas again. 

As a nice bonus we had great service with Chris who was very familiar with the menu and suggestion.

I am a burger fan, any kinds of burger makes me happy.. McDonald, KFC, The Counter, Cheesecake Factory.... all burgers are sooo good that ... when I bit into the burger I ordered here, I was very disappointed that it tasted like salt all over my mouth.

Our waiter recommended this burger to me, so I ordered this one instead of my original choice on the menu. He said this burger he recommends only costs $1 more, but gives me more mushroom.. Okay, so the result is what I just described.
 
My bf was trying to be very nice to them and ordered another one for me, and we ended up paying for the crappy one they recommended to us as well. And yes, the second one we ordered was fine. 

So I am giving them a three star instead of two or one.

This place is a lot bigger than it appears and can easily accommodate large parties. When I went inside to the restroom, I noticed that there was indoor seating too. However, it is great for dining outside while taking in the Vegas atmosphere during the warmer months. 

Stripburger advertises a lot of freshness behind their food, such as never-frozen patties and freshly cut fries. The bacon and cheddar burger is pretty good. I've had better patties but this was pretty satisfying. The veggie burger has a patty made from brown rice. It is very well-seasoned and delicious! Burgers averaged from $8-11, which I consider pretty cheap given it's Vegas. 

The cheddar fries came with a creamy sauce and shredded cheddar cheese on top. It was a great guilty pleasure. Adult shakes are always fun to drink but can be over the top because the burgers are pretty heavy. 

Overall, this was a very chill atmosphere with good food. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars because it's more than okay but I can't declare myself as a fan.

The condiments are fresh and delicious.
I had the burger topped with mac and cheese and bacon. The bacon is meh, maybe worse than that. It's just your basic thin-sliced store bought variety and isn't cooked to a crisp (read: limp). The mac and cheese was decent, but nothing more. It didn't have much flavor or cheesiness.

Finding that the right balance for price, portion size, and quality is really difficult. Then you're in Vegas. Does that even exist? Apparently it does. And it's in the form of Stripburger.

It's located right across from the Wynn in the shopping center which was perfect for my friends and I. We walked over one day before dinner and were pleasantly surprised by everything. Our only complaint about the burger is that it couldn't hold itself together. Everything was dripping everywhere and falling apart. My bun was soggy before I even got halfway through the burger. Regardless, it was delicious. The sweet potato fries were good but there was a little too much of the sugar/salt mix on it and I had to scrape it off. 

The portions are huge! The burger was probably around the size of my face. And if you order a gourmet burger, then it comes with fries. That factors to be about $20 with tip. Definitely a solid deal if you're in Vegas. 

Stripburger lost the 0.5 stars because the burger couldn't hold up. It's one of the things that really stresses me out when I'm eating and if the burger was stacked properly, I feel like everything would have been okay. I bumped it up to four because of the value.",wZ0AkUZQmB3qMF1e2vYJvw,2,1,4,5dP57qEYIGpobEbQTR9ySw

So, I'm guessing that's pretty pricey for just a burger.

The burgers don't come with fries, so as a group we ordered ""the threesome"" which came with fried onion strings, french fries, and fried pickles. The fried onion stings were a little soggy and too greasy for my liking, but the fried pickles were awesome. The french fries were standard fries, nothing to write home about.

It's all outdoor seating which is kind of brutal during the summer.  I went for dinner and the misters were helpful in keeping it cool, but they also kind of mist your plate, your drink and everything else.  The waitresses are nice and the food came out quick.

The first thing I noticed about the burger was the bun.  It looked perfectly round and not too thick.  The burger was above average.  It was too dark to see the pinkness of the patty, but judging by taste and consistency, I'd say they got it right.  My cousin also ordered fried pickles.  I freaking hate pickles, but these were fried so crispy, I couldn't even taste the pickles.  Surprisingly good!

Worth going to, but if you go on a hot summer day, you might suffer a little...

First the burgers. I have had tried them all but the mexican burger is the best. I was introduced to this a while back before it was even on the menu. Chipotle Mayo, pickled red onions, Jalapeno,  Cotilla Cheese, Cilantro, and a roasted Jalapeno stabbed into the top of the bun with a toothpick. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. You must get their green homemade ""Chuy"" sauce with it. It is spicy and a delight to the taste buds. If Amy(great bartender) is there she serves it with every Mexican burger.

Next up is the Garlic fries, lots of fresh garlic spices. Big enough to share but just like grandma when you got close to her pies you will be slapping an intruders hand. 

Not only are the libations cheap for happy hr, full bar is $1 after nine. Their regular fries and sliders are half off.

Their menu is filled with great burger, fry and milkshake choices.  When we were there we ordered up the bacon and cheddar burger, green chili cheeseburger and hickory bacon burger.  And Stripburger was close to spot on with each offering.  The bacon toppings were delicious and perfectly crisp.  The cheese was gooey and oh so good.  The patties themselves were solid, but not the greatest taste in the burger world.  Our complaint?  Green chilis that were pickled and spiceless.  Seriously?  If you're going to offer a green chile burger then knock me out.  The chilis should light my mouth on fire.  These chilis were tasty enough (i.e., I enjoy the taste of pickles), but bland when it comes to spice.

We also ordered up some green chile fries and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are award-winning.  The chile fries?  Eh.  Same problem as the chile burger discussed above.  

Sounds like a decent burger joint right?  So why the four stars?  Well, the answer lies in Stripburger's milkshakes.  Wow.  Just wow.  According to Homer, the Greek Gods reclining on Mount Olympus feasted on ambrosia.  The gods were cheated.

I've eaten here a few times a few years ago when I used to work at Fashion Show but recently came back again from my boyfriend's draft day. If you guys don't know, all seating is outdoors but there's misters everywhere so it's not too bad. Overall just for food taste and quality I would give them 3 stars.

The biggest pros for this place which raise it from 3 stars to 4 stars:
-They are always open pretty late! Friday & Saturday till 2 am and the rest of the week till 1 am.
-They have winter drink specials from December-January for $1 drinks!
-$7.95 Adult milkshakes (Holstein's in Cosmopolitan has them $13; much more flavors offered but just a note on price)

Onto my most recent food experience! I got the Nacho Fries $9.95 which have melted atomic cheese, guac, pico, jalapenos, sour cream and cilantro. These were really good, lots of toppings, definitely settled the craving for fries and nachos all in one! It doesn't come with meat but you can add some if you'd like. As for the atomic cheese, I didn't taste any spiciness at all but I have a pretty high heat tolerance so maybe I didn't notice. The boyfriend is a little weaker regarding heat and he didn't seem bothered at all by it.
For the burger we got the Mexican burger $10.95 which included chipotle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapenos, cotija & jack cheese, and cilantro. This was pretty good as well. I could taste all of the ingredients they said it has, you know cause some places will say there's about 10 things in an item and you're like uhmmm I only taste 2? lol Not with this burger. Everything had good flavor and hit the spot. 

Pricing is pretty decent for what you get on the strip. I just hate that it's outdoors. They also offer quite a bit of specialty cocktails, some salads and chicken sandwiches as well.

I love me some burgers so I jumped at the chance to check it out. First off, I must say that I was very impressed with the location. Outdoor seating just outside of the Fashion Show Mall and right across from the Wynn, it was the perfect setting for some good times and food with friends.

Looking at the menu she was right on the dot...nothing over 10 bucks. Their favorite blue cheese burger caught my eye, but I noticed that their other burgers had toppings that I wanted to add on to that burger like bacon ( I mean come on...if you are gonna do a burger, do it right and go all out). The waitress accommodated me and said I could add whatever I wanted to my burger which was awesome. I must say that I was pretty impressed with the burger once it arrived...nice and juicy and cooked perfectly. The sides were great. Fries were crisp yet the only problem I had were the onion rings...way too skinny and limp (as women...we tend not to like that). All in all, Stripburger is a great place to chill, relax, listen to some good music and eat good burgers.

When I was in Las vegas  like a week ago with my sisters, we were walking on the strip and we all had the same intention of wanting a good burger.  So I got out my iphone and located all the local burger joints and strip burger came up! We've been passing it for years ,but never bothered to even try it!   I looked at the reviews here on yelp through my phone and we wondered why so many people were giving this place such bad reviews. 
With doubt in our minds, we were very hunger and craving burgers so we were just like f*&* -em let's try it for ourselves and see what we think.
it's a pretty hip joint, it's all out doors,  the place has a great view of the strip,they got a full bar, the waiters and waitresses are pretty out going people, and so that was a plus.
The service here was great, out waitresses never let our glasses remain empty and brought out our food fast.She was very accommodating and helpful. No complaints here.
What I really loved about this place is the fact that they use all natural non-frozen beef and ingredients! As a Organic/Natural consumer thats a major plus right there. Nothing beats natural! I ordered a cheeseburger with American, and shared their natural cut herb Garlic fries with my sister and I was astounded!  The burgers here are delicious and the beef patties are cooked to perfection. The meat is oozing with juiciness and so much  flavor and the produce such as the lettuce,tomato and onion were extremely fresh and complimented the burger greatly!  The Herb Garlic fries are to die for! Like I said,  they're Natural cut and  cooked to order and they are loaded with lots of garlic! You'll be scaring of the vampires for quite a while! As guy who loves a lot of garlic, Strip burger  is right on the money with these fries! They do them better than Gordon biersch!  I was excepting a mediocre Burger and meal at best, due to reading all these reviews! but dining here has taught me is that you cannot always rely on the opinions of others, because we're all different and have different perspectives. You gotta try things out for yourself in life and have your own opinion about it.   Stripburger is officially in my Top 5 burger joints and have some of the best burgers that I've ever had!

I realize its Vegas and they are trying to be hip and all that but the music was blasting WAY too loud. Actually I dont mind the loud music, but it made it almost impossible to hear the waitress and vice versa. She evidently didnt hear part of our order so it took a while before everything we ordered actually arrived to our table.
The bacon cheeseburger was pretty big and tasted pretty good. Not great but pretty much what you get at similar places for the same price. The garlic herb fries were good and one order is plenty to share with another person or two.
As we were seated, we walked through a conversation/arguement between a manager and waitress. Sounded like confusion and wrong orders going out are not unusual. Maybe it was just an off night.
If you have kids, I would suggest considering the age and appetite of the child before ordering off of the kids menu. For an 8 year old, the kids cheeseburger was pretty small.
The manager was really nice and attentive. He asked if we would like a heat lamp next to our table and he promptly brought one over and lit it for us.
Leaving took a little while also due to the waitress bringing us somebody elses check. The manager saw me looking around for the waitress and came over and got us the right check.

Stripburger is tucked away in the North corner of the Fashion Show Mall. Its a pretty small restaurant and actually looks like a patio of another restaurant.

Turns out the restaurant actually shares a kitchen with a neighboring Mexican restaurant (El Segundo Sol), along with bathrooms and some waitstaff.

For the most part, the menu is similar to other 'fancy burger' places. Each burger runs around $10-12 bucks. The traditional cheeseburgers or whatever are cheaper and their 'specialty' ones are more expensive.... An assortment of fries each around $4-8, and of course alcoholic milkshakes.

I tries to the KBBQ burger which just seemed like a regular patty with some Kalbi sauce on it. Pretty average. The atomic fries are regular fries layer with Velveeta cheese and jalapenos.

We both did PBR on draft (32oz). I know eeeewww if you may. You can keep the souvenir glass as well. It's plastic, but it did manage to keep our beers cool even with 100+ temps. Next time I'll imbibe in some of their delish sounding cocktails.

I'm rarely in the mood to eat burgers but I'm always game for french fries.

Sadly, the fries at Stripburger weren't the best, but I did like my sliders: 100% all-natural beef patties with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and mayo. Although the meat was seasoned well, I can't deny the fact that the egg buns dwarfed the meat because it was so thin. On the other hand, the bf's bacon cheeseburger was great! It happened to be a ""special"" that day so the fries were included (otherwise, it'll be close to $10 for a burger and you don't even get a side of fries!) I wanted to kickstart my weekend with a Gin & Tonic and it was good to see a variety of gin selection on the shelf including Tanquery 10. Sports fans who feel like having a beer while watching the game won't feel left out with several beers on draft served in 16 oz. glasses, for less than $5. The blonde bartender who helped us out was gracious and friendly.

This all outdoor restaurant has premium space at Fashion Show Mall and is conveniently located across the Wynn hotel. I'll visit again next time I'm in this part of the strip and actually craving for a burger.",Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ,15,13,3,n6nXagVqjn9rwxUTZUIO_w

Well I did. It's a lemonade/vodka/pilsner beer combo that just wasn't quite up to standards. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not as tasty as other similar concoctions I've had. Perhaps it was their choice of beer added. 32oz for $17, and Amy the bartender was nice enough to add some extra fizz to it since it burned a bit much for me.

Also tried the chili cheese fries, figured it'd go well with the drink. At first I turned my nose up at beans in the chili, but they actually turned out to be pretty tasty. $10 off $20 g/c from restaurant.com made this snack totally worth it.

My friends & I decided to walk to stripburger from our hotel at Planet Hollywood since we'd have to burn off the calories somehow haha! Anyway we called ahead of time to see when they'd close and waitress said midnight. We arrived 11pm and now that I think about it maybe we shouldn't have came so close to closing because our burgers didn't taste that great or fresh..

Atomic fries - pretty plain tasting
Garlic Herb & Sweet potato fries - BOMB! this is what made me decide to give 3 stars instead of 2. The garlic fries were really fresh with garlic pieces and seasoning was spot on! Sweet potato fries were addicting as well. I ended up eating more of the fries than the burger

Blue Cheese Burger - My friend ordered this and said it was just ok, nothing amazing.
Mushroom Cheddar Burger - My friend said she didn't like it. The buns soaked up all the juices and so it was falling apart.
Hickory Bacon Burger - I asked for mushrooms to be added to this burger and they forgot the mushrooms. In the end I was charged for the mushrooms, but told the waitress I didn't even get mushrooms in my burger and she fixed the bill. This burger was pretty bland, the only thing that made it taste good was probably the bbq sauce & caramelized onions.

Overall, it took a LONG time for our burgers to be served and the patties for all 3 burgers were cold. Not even warm! Debating if I should give this place another shot next time during lunch time since maybe they were about to close and so they did a sloppy job?

You could walk into Shake Shack, Fatburger, Epic Burger, etc and have a similar experience. It seems that Stripburger is a niche restaurant designed (name) to cater to the Vegas crowds.

Anyway, we stopped in for lunch one day during a recent vacation. We didn't want to sit outside in the heat so we opted to dine inside. ""Inside"" is actually the backroom area of the adjacent restaurant. There are a few tables in an area designed to actually be a prep area. There is NO attempt to hide this fact either. No dressing up the area or anything like that. That didn't bother me though. It was cool and quiet.

I ordered a regular burger with fries and a coke. The burger was pretty good. It was well proportioned and seasoned to perfection. The fries were tasty and big enough for us to share. (even though we ordered two separate baskets) The bill came to a little over $10 which is pretty standard for these types of places.

Cute hostess--pretty much what you'd expect. I actually opted to try their seared ahi tuna burger, my friend went for their more traditional cheeseburger. They both came out really well. They got the sear just right on the ahi, served it in a flaky wheat bun and lathered it in mouthwatering guacamole that tasted quite fresh to me. My friends burger (which I had a few bites of) was juicy and cooked to order. We shared an order of fries, which were particuarly tasty. Much better than your average fast food burger joint fries (why do any of us still go to those places anyway??) as they had bits of skin still on them and were not excessively greasy. They served a cool, clean glass of lemonade (fresh squeezed I believe) which was quite refreshing given the weather at the time.

Now for the review:

This place has great deals, and the waitress E.S mentioned was extremely friendly and she was joking around with him. My other friend and I came back two days in a row, and the waitress actually remembered us. She even bought my friend a drink for his birthday. In a big city like Vegas, it was good to see that some of the workers in Sin City were actually friendly. The people at the Stripburger were great, and the atmosphere is conducive for a great time.

My 2 friends and I were there for a few hours and drank a lot, and because of their late night happy hour, it was inexpensive. All together our bills added up to less than $25. 

The Stripburger is located outside across from the Wynn and next to the fashion show mall. It also has a great outside view of the strip.

Unfortunately, the only food I ordered was the fries, but they were delicious, so I am sure the other food they had is just as great.

As a caveat, whenever I tell people about stripburger they always give me a kind of confused look. I mean, it being Vegas and all, anything goes, right? So I'm assuming that they're assuming that Stripburger is probably a strip club where you can get burgers? That sounds kind of amusing, but I don't know how I'd really feel about enjoying a nice meaty burger while simultaneously enjoying nice meaty stripper buns in my face or what have you. Cool concept though, so I'll put that on my to-do list when I have a gondola load of money. 

Anyway, the strip in stripburger refers to the fact that it's on the Strip. Though, there is a stripper/strip club story in this story, I may not go into detail about it because this is yelp and y'all could be my grandmothers or my grocery bagger or something. 

So the gist of the story is that I came out to Vegas for training for a week. One of my coworkers is also in town though it's for a different training seminar. On this particular day though, I couldn't find him so I'm basically moderately alone in Vegas (though one can argue you're never alone in Vegas or you're ALWAYS alone in Vegas) and I don't know enough about Vegas to know where to go/what to do. I ain't a gambler and I usually just follow my friends around like a sheep. There are other facets of sin that I can get into, but again, you're probably my rabbi.

I wander for an hour up and down the strip and I end up at stripburger even though it's about 7 minutes away from my Hotel (this was based on the recommendation of my shuttle driver btw). So I come figuring I'll sit at the bar, eat a burger, drink a White Russian and relax in Vegas. 

The bartender girl was very nice. The drinks she gave me were pretty cheap and she was somewhat talkative. I ordered chili cheese fries and some sort of burger with bacon. I actually don't even remember what it was right now and it was only a little over two weeks ago! Everything was good, especially since it was on the Company. 

Long story short after maybe sitting for 15 minutes, 2 dudes around my age sit next to me and I strike up a conversation with them. End up going out on the town with them and it leads to a very surreal night. S'all I can really say. So shouts out to them I suppose and of course, to Vegas.",Ez6xtcrbpftaGavpUM4VrA,0,0,4,JhimUY0F8x9Hktk6K_KQ-g

3869992,2015-08-20,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"Sometimes a guy just wants a good burger. Simple aspects: nothing fancy, no extras, and never a long wait. And in the competitive burger environment that is the Las Vegas Strip, Stripburger is one of those places. Whether you have a larger party after a long night (or morning) of Las Vegas shenanigans, or you have brought the wee ones to your ""work conference"", or you simple need a #table4two and a good meal, Stripburger is the answer.

Las Vegas will always be famous for its people watching. Stripburger is no different. Perched on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show, patrons get the walking traffic coming and leaving the mall area, the trickling down from older Las Vegas, and the usually enthusiastic crowds from the Wynn and Encore resorts. Entertainment like this is not always necessary but a welcome feature. They have outdoor dining, which is fun. The misters run throughout the day, and that corner gets a good amount of shade to deal with the desert sun. 

The burgers itself are delicious. Raging steadily from $9-$11, the burgers are a good portion and have varied ingredients including melted mushrooms, chipotle mayo, and Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I usually order the Blue Cheese Burger and add bacon. Yes, I cheat by adding the bacon, but do you blame me? The Mushroom Cheddar Burger and the Whiskey BBQ Burger are also hits at our table. 

But Stripburger gets underestimated with their sides ($5-$8). Their garlic herb fries, sweet potato fries, and the garlic strings are appetizing. I order mine extra crispy. They even do a threesome which combines a couple choices and some pickle fries. The milkshakes ($5) are very good as well, although a little on the thicker side. But as other reviewers have mentioned, its consistency is due to the Las Vegas heat. It melts just a tad bit slower. The butterscotch and the banana shakes are my personal favorite. Go to those if you have a sweet craving.

Because of the size of the Las Vegas Strip, most food choices are made on convenience. But I advise that you make a trip to Stripburger in the Fashion Show Mall. Its ambiance, affordable Strip prices, and darn good food make it a crowd pleaser and go-to stop from visitors and locals alike.",h5OjJINwtny1cJnNFWnq7A,0,0,4,QC21nPN8kEVlmd8_W8evwA

The prices are good and so are the burgers.  I had the Bleu Cheese Burger cook medium rare, which is what I got with no frills or fuss.  I also tried the spicy cheese fries which were pretty good, but could of been spicer.  

Overall good.  The bar service a little slow, moreso because it seems as though the bartender had to fill table orders and neglect the people sitting at the bar.  This overloaded her.

The burgers are just ok.  I ordered mine medium rare, but it came out about medium.  That's just a huge minus in my book.  If I were rating this place based solely on doneness, I would have given one star.

The fries were fries.  Not sure I could have gotten any better than that.  At least they weren't limp, cold and/or overly greasy.  The garlic fries were pretty garlicky (duh) and onion rings were nice and big.  

One of my companions ordered a bowl of chili.  Why you come to a burger joint and order chili - or why a burger joint even offers chili - is beyond me.  But whatever.  The chili comes and my companion is like, ""this is a bowl?""  The eensy weensy ramekin has roughly four or five large spoonfuls of chili.  I might be exaggerating (not much), but for the price, you'd really expect a bowl to be, well, a bowl. 

The service was acceptable, though we did see the bottoms of our drinks a few too many times.  What's strange is that our server took our glasses from us and went in the back to get refills.  I am not sure why they don't have pitchers or why she didn't just bring us an additional glass.  Whatever it was, refilling could have been far more efficient.

I had looked at the menu online and was all set to order the burger I had chosen when I did a switch and went with the mini burger sampler.  This consists of three sliders--the blue cheese burger, the whiskey BBQ burger, and the cheddar burger.   I asked for the burgers to be done rare and they were.  That was a bit surprising because of their smaller size.  They cooked them the way they should.  With the burger, I got an order of garlic, herb fries which was large enough to feed me and the two other people at the bar.

While waiting, I enjoyed the people watching which is a big draw for this place.  Being on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fashion Show Drive and with all seating being patio seating, it's a great place if you just want to have a drink and watch the tourists go by.  

Of the burger sampler, I liked the blue cheese and the whiskey BBQ the best.  All three were good, but these two were better.  The fries were excellent.  So much garlic, good herb seasoning, and lots of salt on my part and I was set.

I was in a mood for a nice burger and been wanting to try this place for some time now.  My gf and i shared Bacon Cheddar, their signature Blue Cheese Burger, and a Threesome (onions strings, fries, and pickle fries).

Our food took 22min to arrive.  When it did my gf thought our burgers were cold. And I thought for a 'signature' burger they would do something special with the blue cheese, but it was a burger with blue cheese crumbles.  My Bacon Cheddar was OK.  You have to be an idiot to mess up bacon.

Our fries also came out poorly compare to McDonald's standard.  I expected more from a establishment on the strip but this wasn't the case.  There were a mixture of greasy limp, burnt, and legitimate fries in our basket along with onion strings and deep fried pickles.

4118851,2012-04-09,1,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"Thanks, Strip Burger, for being open on Easter Sunday.  But boo to you for your hiring decisions.

Strip Burger is a burger joint on the strip (clever, huh!).  We went to the fashion show mall location.  It was open on Easter, even though the rest of the mall wasn't.

We were HUNGRY and happy to find a burger joint with an interesting veggie burger and fried pickles.

We ordered ""steins"" of cheep beer(they have 16 oz and 32 oz on their menu), I ordered the double original burger, the wife ordered the veggie patty (the rice kind, with nuts and seasonings in the patty) ""done up Mexican style"" (to include roasted jalapenos), and the ""threesome"" (fries, onion rings, and fried pickles).

We wait. 

Our beer comes, but in 16 oz. pint glasses.  We say we wanted steins. The (fairly sweet but obviously naive) server says that she'll just bring us the second half later.

We wait.

Our food comes (thank goodness... most of the other diners had to wait a lot longer).  My wife's burger is cold, and doesn't come with the Mexican fixings she asked for.  The onion rings are really straws, good for putting on hamburgers, but way too stringy to eat by themselves.  The pickles are OK, but there aren't enough of them, and the fries are tasty.  My burger is tasty, but certainly not better than a top-notch fast food place (Five guys, etc.)  The wife finally gets the roasted jalapeno, and cojita cheese for the ""Mexican"" toppings, but it's just one pepper -- not sliced to put on the burger or anything.  She eats, and the burger proceeds to fall apart.

Everything there is tense, as people aren't getting the right orders, or not getting their order in time.  We get the second half of our beers in traveler cups and get the bill--- she charged us for 4 small beers instead of 2 big ones (which, of course, is more).  Really?  You made a mistake and we have to pay more?  If you don't know what a ""stein"" is, then you should say ""we don't have that.  We have 16 oz glasses and 32 oz mugs/glasses/buckets/whatever.""

My burger was fine. My wife's probably would have been fine if it weren't cold.  The atmosphere was nice -- outside on a beautiful day.  But we just had to get out of there as fast as we could.  

Sorry, Stripburger, we'll be skipping you next time.",OR0z3Tn7LLuO0NkHSy-atQ,0,1,2,Q4YHUh7UQbGjnTkEMr9GOg

I ordered the hickory chicken sandwich, which was just OK. The sauce was a little much. However, the chicken was cooked to perfection and was nice and juicy. I probably would have been better off with just a plain chicken sandwich, which my friend ordered and loved. We had a basket of fries, which were good and well seasoned. 

While I enjoed a heineken, my friend had a chocolate shake, which he raved over. It was nice and thick, and apparently super tasty. I'll have to get one next time!

It was way too late to eat a burger so I opted for a turkey cobbish salad and a side of over the top spicy chili that I could not eat so I gave it to my hub since he can stomach that kind of spice.

I was definitely not impressed by the food, the amount of food and the prices that were attached to them. My $10 salad was not worth the dough the $7 chili didn't taste that fresh and the $6 german beer was the only thing this meal had going for it. 

Now concerning the cleanliness of the place, there were about 10 employees running around an almost empty restaurant but the bar area where I was seated was dirty and yucky and every table that was empty had old food and waste from previously customers. 

I really wanted to love or at least like this place but so far this burger joint has 100% fallen short of what is expected from a restaurant.

Located at the Fashion Show Mall, seated right on the Strip (hence its name ""Stripburger""), one is immediately welcomed to sit in the covered patio area.  Since the whipping winds were not in effect on this particular day, my co-workers/fellow foodies and I gladly took a table on the patio.  Although I had studied the menu a few days before our burger lunch date, I still reviewed it thoughtfully once we were seated.  I hadn't changed my mind, I still wanted to give that Mexican Burger a day in court and oh, what the hell, the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake.  It's Friday after all, I figured, live a little.  Then one of my burger buddies piped up and asked, ""Do you want to order some fries?""  Yeah, I'm living today and then some.  We couldn't decide between the sweet potato fries and the garlic herb fries until our very sweet and accommodating server responded that we could get half and half.  Let's do this.

While the three of us waited for our food, two of us got our milkshakes.  My fellow milkshake mate got a cookies and cream that looked amazing.  My shake was deliciously thick, not overly rich or peanut buttery, but just the right amount of both peanut butter and chocolate.  Noticeably, neither one of us shared with the other.  Perhaps that's a very telling thing: those shakes were just so damn good, who wants to share?  Then our food arrived and was picture perfect...kind of like the website photos.  The basket of fries was put down in front of me and I just dug into those before I even touched my burger.  It was a nice equal amount of both sweet potato and garlic fries.  Note: the sweet potato fries are sprinkled with what one of my lovely cohorts referred to as ""sugary goodness."" I say it was sugar and spice and everything nice about those sweet potatoes.  The garlic fries were as amazing topped with fresh pressed garlic and herbs.  I finally switched my attention to the main event by cutting into my burger.  

Topped with a jalapeno pepper, my burger was beautifully cooked medium rare to my specification.  It was filled with cotija cheese, cilantro, pickled red onions, jalapeno, tomato, lettuce and chipotle mayo and not a drop crumbled onto the plate, my lap or tore in half when I bit into it.  With most designer burgers or even those double stacked types piled a mile higher than a mouth can actually open, the filling usually bursts out, leaving a smooshed mess in its wake.  At the risk of being Goldilocks here, this burger was not too stuffed and not too under-stuffed but just right. 

And that sums up my experience at Stripburger.  I walked away not too stuffed and definitely not under-stuffed, but just right and completely satisfied.  The service was great, the ambience for a Friday afternoon on the Strip was lovely, and the food was excellent.  I will be back to try a different burger and a different variety of fries (the atomic cheese fries piques my interest).  Perhaps next time, I will try an adult beverage with my burger (hello beer mojito).",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,1,2,5,kRf95eECEZZxFAfQyFlgNA

This review, unfortunately, needs to be filed in the ""constructive criticism"" category. 

Things that need fixing:

1. The outdoor patio reeked of vomit or rotting garbage... not sure which. I asked for a table change, which was accomodated and the server mentioned she was well aware of the smell and it is typical at that side of the restaurant. The new table still smelled awful... I gave up and didnt ask for another move. 

2. I went for a bison burger because their yelp menu showed bison... bison is no longer on their actual menu. Take note - if you have over 250 reviews on yelp, it might be a good idea to update your details regularly. 

3. The restaurant was MAYBE 1/6 full and the food took forever to come out. Two burgers and fries took somewhere around 40+minutes  after placing the order. 

4. Gluten free bun was as hard as a rock. This is not hyperbole... I could not compress the bun with hand strength. I asked the server if this was normal and she said it was because the buns come frozen and then they aren't soft once heated?? I have eaten a lot of gluten free buns in my day and never seen anything like this. 

5. Fries were so-so. 

6. Server was friendly but there is too much negative outweighing the friendliness to warrant an upgrade from one to two stars.",1sCsxk9VvZzXGLv9Dt0IlA,0,0,1,SkLyID6n67DCgI_Lxvq4VQ

Alexis was our waitress for lunch and she was very attentive and sweet so thank you! When we came for dinner we ordered to-go from the bar and Maria took our order and chatted with us while she was bar-tending for other customers, she's very good with her multitasking skills and very nice. Oh and Ross the co-owner checked in with us during our lunch and it was very nice to see how much the workers there appreciate their customers.

The happy hour is very solid - $2 beer, $2 fries and $2 sliders from about 3 (or 4) - 7PM and 11PM - close.  Definitely worth a stop if you need some cheap eats.  Service was very solid too (and a little busy around 6:30PM) and there's bar seating as well as some tables.  

The regular menu consists of burgers/drinks and a few other items.  Along with a PBR and a slider, I tried out the veggie burger.  The taste of the veggie burger wasn't too bad although it wasn't the best I've had.  The slider too was not too shabby - it was a pretty good deal for $2 although the sauce was a little too zesty for my tastes.  

The scene seemed like a mix of tourists and locals (around happy hour at least) and again, if you're nearby the area, not too shabby of a spot to pick up some cheap grub.",PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ,1,1,3,v7bgJIZnHcbapSIQnYiCmw

The Happy Hour starts here at 11pm and goes until close...I love Vegas! You can really find a happy hour at any hour in Vegas. 

I can not believe I am reviewing this place because it is my secret place to go to and just veg out alone.  One of the managers at Mon Ami Gabi told me about this place 6 years ago and I always come down for some cheap $2 beers (Happy Hour) and a little dinner. 

Amy the bartender is really nice and I've seen her on past visits but I'm sure she doesn't remember me.  You might think she's unfriendly at first but once you start talking to her you will then realize how cool she is. She works her butt off at the circle bar. Running around keeping customers happy and also making drinks for the servers tables. 

The burgers here are good but I wouldn't expect anything less from a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. Plus Chicago chains rock!!! I know...spoken like a true Chicago Boy! Hey I've got to stand up for my city! I have no idea why they haven't opened this concept in Chicago. (I'm not a fan of there M Burger...the rip off version of In n Out)

My favorite thing here is the butter salad but now it seems to come with romaine and spinach. The salad is nice and large. It is worth the money because you will feel full. I know what your thinking...a salad in Vegas...yes after everything my body has been put through it needs this. 

I also enjoyed the onion rings too. I know it's an app but it really isn't for sharing because there's only like 6 rings in here. So get your own basket! No really get your own!

This is just a great place to chill out and relax. I also love that it is outside too. There is not much of a view unless you like looking at Steve Wynn's billions towering in the desert sky. The food is priced reasonable for Vegas and the Happy Drinks will save you a bunch. Until next time strip burger.",CY9iLsE2z_yLhLqJdD1WGw,7,8,4,FEsi-OBrNa-14cA_zJ5JXQ

The food came out very quickly and the whole experience was wonderful. The hosts/bussers/servers/food runners were all smiley and welcoming, which honestly does a whole lot more than you'd expect.

I decided on the mini burger sampler which included a blue cheese burger, whiskey burger, and cheddar burger. It didn't come with fries which was fine because I wanted to try the trio of fries, onion strings, and pickle chips. My husband quickly decided on the bison burger topped with a fried Hatch chile and served with fries. He also ordered a cookies-n-cream milkshake.

The cookies-n-cream milkshake is amazing. I couldn't stop stealing sips of it. I also like that they serve it on the thicker side so that it isn't a melted mess in the Vegas heat as soon as it is served. The burger sampler was a good portion of food and easier to eat than one big burger. They weren't bad burgers, but the amazing flavor I anticipated just wasn't there. I can't say it was one of the best burgers that I've had. My husband felt the same way about his burger. I'd say the same for the fries and onion strings.

Came here last night with my manager while we were in Vegas to take care of some work stuff... LOVE the fact that they are open till 2 AM (full on bar service as well). The music was a little loud for my liking, it was kinda hard to hear what my manger was saying to me, and we were sitting together at the same table! But I loved the outdoor space, and the lively feeling from around the area. Had a super friendly waitress last night, she was full of suggestions, and let us take our time ordering. My burger was SO FREAKIN TALL it was not even funny... you have to smash your burger down if you want to eat it all in one bite. However, I felt that even though the top was beautifully rounded out and a nice golden brown color, the insides of the bun were not toasted, and I found that I didn't really like that. I ordered my patty rare... and yes, it came out pink and raw, just the way I like it... however, I felt that I hit a cold spot somewhere in the middle of my patty, like they didn't heat it enough? Fleeting thoughts of undercooked raw food poisoning flirted across my mind and I continued to munch on my humungo-dang-diggy-dang-de-dang-de-dang-diggy-diggy burger. A little after halfway across my burger, the juices from the raw meat pretty much infiltrated my paper that wrapped around my burger, and soggify-ed the whole bun to mush, pretty much. I ended up tossing the top of my burger bun to cut some carbs out of my diet, and grubbing on the food inside individually.

Manager and I also ordered a side of Atomic Fries... guess I was looking for more from the name. Kinda expected some BOMB chili-cheese-fries, but with a ""mouth-on-fire"" feeling. Didn't happen. We got a basket full of fresh, hot, oily fries slathered on top with a healthy dose of creamy nacho-esque cheese, sprinkled with some jalapeno peppers. WHAT?!?! Are you serious? Is that it?!?! Kinda disappointed...

But for sure, if you're hungry, the burger definitely hits the spot to help fill you up. Not sure if it's worth the $10 bucks paid for it... but I understand everything is overpriced on the strip, and frankly, I thought the burger was pretty good overall...

My brother and I each had beer to go with our milkshake (bad timing) and my sister-in-law had a margarita that was shaken in one mason jar and served in another. The presentation was cute but because the drink tasted worse than a manufactured drink from a machine at Fat Tuesday's, all points were lost.

Disappointingly, the burgers weren't that great either. We had their self-proclaimed famous blue cheese burger ($9.95) and the hickory burger ($9.95). The meat itself was alright, but they hadn't considered using a necessary moisture barrier between the meat and the bun. A juicy burger cooked on a flat top is bound to drip, so the best method for preventing this is to first set the patty on a paper towel after cooking to absorb the excess liquid, and then use some other ingredient (or ingredients) to form a layer between the meat and the bun so as to prevent the bun from getting soggy, such as lettuce, onions, etc. Despite the misleading picture on their website, the bottom half of the bun turned into a thin mush. The flavor of the meat and toppings were alright, but not good enough to compensate for the burger's shortcomings, so overall they weren't terribly successful.

We also ordered the ""atomic fries"" ($4.75) which weren't atomic at all, though it is still hard not to make fried potatoes tasty with the addition of processed nacho cheese and green chiles. I wouldn't order them again, but shamefully we still consumed most of what was in the basket. The highlight of the meal was another side, fried pickles ($3.95). I had my hesitations but I am always intrigued by interesting fried things so we tried them out. The were crunchy, vinegary, and salty, and were served with a ranch dipping sauce. I could have had these and the chocolate shake and been very pleased with my lunch.

Despite the mediocrity of the meal, the prices were still quite reasonable for a casual Strip lunch and I can see why the place is usually busy. Gourmands on a food tour of Vegas certainly wouldn't eat here, but if you have friends in town on a budget that don't want to venture off the Strip, this is certainly a place a recommend. It's hard to find a sit down restaurant with such a prime location elsewhere that would cost you anything less than twice as much.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,5,3,2,i66o_qaYxmj7_2HsXPwQ8g

4495290,2016-05-24,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"Was in Vegas for work and visited the Strupburger two times during my stay. The visit experiences were completely opposite of each other and perfect proof that the right wait person makes ALL the difference in a good overall experience.
Visit number 1 - easily a 4-star visit, close to 5 star for this type of place at this price point
Visit 2 - might have earned a 3 star rating

Because I know sometimes stuff happens, I'm giving it my initial 4 star rating.

Visit 1:
It could have easily taken a sideways turn, but our waiter was in spot and made everything right.
We walked up and there was no one to greet us, just at the point of being an annoyance a waiter walked by and said someone would be right with us. He had a fantastic smile and apologized for our wait, and we were seated very soon after.
That nice guy that greeted us at the door happened to be our waiter (save 1).  He was super nice and helpful. I asked to stray from the menu for a bit, by putting Brie cheese in my burger and he was totally accommodating.
Unfortunately when the burger came out it was with the wrong cheese. :( He came to the table moments after the food did and was super apologetic and scooped it up. My correct burger wasn't far behind.

Visit 2:
Host was one of those people that wait for you to acknowledge that you're there. This is a huge pet peeve of mine, it's your job... greet me with a ""Hello"" and a ""2 for dinner?"". Don't make me greet you when I walk in. I'm not getting the paycheck.
Anyway, we were sat. Because our waitress was busy the manager took our drink order. The service was slow this visit. Once we had the chance, we ordered our food and a milkshake at the same time from the waitress. Good showed up and the milkshake never did. Done with the meal and she came up and brought my hubby a new soda and asked me if I wanted a beer to go (yet the soda she brought him was in a glass - not sure if she expected him to slug it down while I got a to go beverage?).  ""No, but we did order a milkshake, were kind of wondering where that went."" She apologized a D said she'd take care of it. Quite some time later, at the point where we were ready to just ask for the check (but we realized that we hadn't seen her since she brought the soda) she finally showed up with the milkshakes. We asked for the bill at that time, cuz we didn't want to wait any longer.

Food:
The burgers were SUPER. And we highly recommend the Cheese Curds Fries and Cheddar Fries. The milkshakes were very tasty. And I am ALWAYS about a boozey milkshake, so I had the Chocolate with the Jack Daniels.

The seating area is nice with trees across the Strip from them (instead of looking at yet another resort). The music was a little loud but they had a GREAT selection of music!

After calling a dozen restaurants in Las Vegas we finally found this place which was open till midnight, thankfully. We arrived at 8pm with a party of 3 and we were seated immediately.

Our server was terrible to put it politely. Took her ~8mins to come introduce herself to our table. Also we had to steal utensils from the table across from us because she only brought enough for two people. Not sure if she was just having a bad day but she came across as very uninterested, hurried, and unhospitable. 

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Burger and it was served on a small appetizer plate. The burger had an artificial taste to it, the breaking on the patty was also very soggy halfway through the burger. Also what disappointed me the most was the bread! My burger was so soggy that the bottom half of my bun was thinner than a pancake, literally.

I argued with my cousins for about 5 minutes complaining how I didn't get a bottom bun to my burger, but sure enough once I began eating it was under all of the excess ingredients in my plate. My cousins thought it was a tomato at first, lol. (See picture for my pancake bun)

The food was delicious. My burger was cooked exactly as I asked and quite filling. All in all, a solid, well cooked and seasoned burger. The one thing that I really recommend is the garlic and herb fries. They were the stars of the entire meal. Of course, my breath was kicking after, but it was definitely worth it because they were that good. The sweet potato fries were also pretty nom.

We visited on a Tuesday around 4:30p and the place wasn't busy at all. There was plenty of room for the two of us and our baby in his stroller (although I was surprised they insisted on sitting us up some stairs...). 

It was Happy Hour (4p-7p) and they offer $2 sliders and a mini portion of fries. But we were hungry for more than just done nibbles, so we passed on those items. Instead we opted to share the Mushroom Cheddar Burger (with added bacon), the Roasted Turkey Salad and an order of sweet potato fries with cheddar on top. Oddly enough, the burger was the most disappointing part of our meal. Even with the toppings it had absolutely no flavor. However, both the salad and fries were fantastic! The salad was roughly chopped and had huge chunks of everything - turkey, cheddar, bleu cheese, date glazed bacon, grapes, apples, avocado and lettuce. The sweet potato fries were covered in a cheese sauce as well as cheddar cheese. There was a enough cheese that every fry and every bite had flavor.

I've had lots of good burgers over the years but this place has been one of my favorites! 

SEATING: It's a small outdoors restaurant so I would NOT recommend going in the middle of a hot Vegas day! We went for dinner on a Wednesday evening after the sun had already set behind the mountains so it was a bit cooler. We had a nice view of the strip which was fun for people watching. 

BAR: The bar and actually the restaurant itself is a circular shape with high top tables all along the rim. Good thing they had fans for extra ventilation. 

SERVICE: Since we went in a weekday night we were seated right away which was nice since we were hungry!

FOOD: The menu is simple and fairly easy to follow which is good! One of my culinary pet peeves is when the menu is super crammed and unorganized tht I can't even navigate it! You order burgers and sides separate. My friend and I each got a burger --she got something with blue cheese and I had one with onion strings and the perfect amount of whiskey BBQ sauce! We also shared an order of sweet potato fries, which I'm glad we did because it was HUGE--we couldn't even finish it.

We both commented that it's a great location, even though it's a bit hard to find. Like another reviewer said, great spot to people watch.

Once we we sat and ordered, it went down hill...fast...from there. We order two burgers and shared the fries. The fries come in a basket with plenty for two people. Sadly, they were cold, however, they had a lot of potential. If they were hot, these fries could rival in n outs fries. But we will never know. Read on...

The burgers came after a longer than average wait ( this place was not busy) we ordered our burgers medium. Sadly, they came nearly raw. Intact, I think I heard mine moo a few times. The waitress finally came back and we explained to her the burgers were just not cooked enough. They were red not pink inside. She was very kind and offered to have them cook new burgers for us. We took her up on the offer and the fresh burgers arrive...with cold buns. Not good.

As far as flavor goes, I had a simple cheeseburger. It was as boring as it sounds. Not much flavor, just a dab of cheese and hardly any onions.

The other burger was the Brie and bacon, I think. Again, a cold bun and not a lot of flavor.

Other than the long delay of service at the beginning and end, the service was just ok. I was very pleased that the manager came out and asked us about the raw burgers. I was not expecting him to do anything about it, and he didn't. But it was nice of him to ask us about the situation.

We had eaten here a few years ago and didn't care for sitting outside.  I heard some good things about Stripburger, so thought I would give them another shot.  

Even though all of the seating is outdoors, they have some pretty strong fans and a lot of misters.  I sat at the bar and was totally comfortable throughout my meal, despite the triple digit temperature outside.  Service was quick, I was immediately approached by the bartender and received my burger after about 12 minutes.  I opted for the jalapeno popper burger, which has the typical burger veggies, bacon, jalapeno and fried cheddar.  The fried cheddar is what lured me in, and it was fantastic.  It was crispy and added great texture to the burger to go with the cheesy flavor.  I could have used more jalapeno, I'll order extra when I get the burger again.  My main issue with the burger was I ordered it medium and it came out medium well at best.  Still had some juice, but it was certainly overcooked.  

On the side, I had the onion strings.  You get a huge basket for $3.95, easily enough to share.  I liked them, but they could have been a little thicker for my taste, they were extremely thin strings.  But, great crunch and nice onion flavor.

5016162,2017-12-04,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"The reason for 3 stars and not 5 is because of the service. We went there about 9:00 p.m. I was reluctant to sit outside because it was cold, however, they had nice strong heaters thst they kept on the whole time so it was so warm and toasty. The food was amazing. Many different things were ordered but they all tasted amazing and everybody scrafed theirs down pretty quickly.

What went wrong was the way we were served. So there were 5 adults in our group and 2 kids, normally, restaurants do not technically count the kids as ""people"" for their table headcount, but this waiter did and they automaticlly charged about 19% for gratuity from us. That's probably why the service was so terrible because he knew he was getting a tip either way.

Anyway, my boyfriend got 3 refills and each refill he had to ask for. We saw our waiter like 3 times and each time he was uninterested and coming out from a casual conversation he was having with his co-workers. It was not busy at all the time we went, so there was no reason to not have his attention. 

He made no conversation, wrote our orders down wrong, and he wasn't even the one serving our food to us. When we told him we wanted our bill split, he was annoyed. He took forever to split them, probably because of the conversation he was carrying on the whole time with another associate, and when he came back he basically just handed them to us and washed his hands of us. Didn't ask how it was or anything.

He ended up making about $50 on tips just from us and gave us trashy service.

I was with my boyfriend and his Aunt. After the long trek to get over to the area, we were seated super fast in the bar area outside. Our waitress was really nice despite how busy they were. She kept filling our glasses with ice cold water - we were all thirsty and HOT!!! My boyfriend and I ordered the veggie burgers, and his aunt ordered the green chile burger. We shared a ""threesome"". The order came extremely fast. I fell in love with my veggie  burger at first bite. If you are vegetarian and need something good - this is it. It is $9 and HUGE. If I wasn't starving I would have only been able to eat half. My boyfriend still got a 1/5th portion of mine that was left over. It was truly fantastic. 

The threesome was delicious too. The onion strings (which I cleverly placed on my burger) were yummy. The fries were so-so but not awful, and the PICKLE fries were SO good that we ordered a single serving of them. They were surprisingly delicious and worth trying. I recommend getting the threesome if you are with a group so if you like them, you can always order more! 

We had a restaurant.com $10 cert so our order came to $30 after that deduction. The staff was really attentive despite the busy night. The Aunt was afraid of her medium burger and the chef was extremely sweet about it and offered her a new one if she didn't feel comfortable eating it. 

Overall, a great experience. I just HATE how hard it is to get there and back to your car on a late night.",OvQtTXbpzJFGhbjNqWjGOA,0,0,4,3_Zxr-OiMGLWQkebyU8q7A

5051854,2012-03-29,0,pLMPpaJ7whp86uL_3ezwMg,"This place was probably great back in it's heyday like 4 years ago.  My husband recommended eating here because he really enjoyed it back in 2008.   We went yesterday in hopes of enjoying a great burger and great atmosphere based on current reviews. I'm surprised that only one other review mentioned the uncleanliness of this place.   I'm not that picky but this place was awful.    

The worst part about eating here is the smell.  The outside area has this stomach turning sour smell that reeks of spilled drinks, old food, and general grime.    The doors to the actual inside area are filthy and covered with fingerprints and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a few years.   The outside table was clean but the white chairs they seat you in are filthy too covered in dirty fingerprints and years of dirt buildup.   

We ordered sodas and my soda came in a dirty glass with dried mustard on the side.   I was quickly losing faith that this was going to be a good experience.   I just kept smelling that awful sour smell as did my husband.  

I ordered the mini burger trio and my husband the bacon cheeseburger.  We shared an order of garlic herb fries.  Definitely share sides if you come here because they are more than enough for one person.    The mini burger trio was just okay and I say just okay because it there was barely any meat and a lot of bun.  The best kind of burger was the blue cheese burger so I wish I would have just ordered that on its own.  My husband said his burger was alright but the construction of it was awful.  They put the tomato on the bottom which caused the bottom bun to disinegrate before he could even finish his sandwich.  

The final bill came to over 40 dollars which I think is pretty spendy for what you get here but it is the Strip so it wasn't that bad.   This place would be much more fun to eat at if the owners hadn't let it get so run down and smelly.    I'd eat here again but only if it was given a thorough cleaning.",VN_n0Ddxny0J6Z0ehMsvUw,1,0,2,1Lg_RraRLMx6fJtQhkg6ww

The fried pickles were good; something you'd only be able to get at a fair or carnival. My only complaint about the dish was that the pickle slice wouldn't hold to the breading, so I was left with a chunk of fried breading after each bite. The big green salad was fresh and light. The croutons on the salad were house made and also very fresh. I enjoyed the lightness and acidity of the avocado dressing. My dining partner ordered a cheeseburger which was great in terms of flavor and presentation, but not comparable to my favorite LA spots. The cocktail was refreshing and well made as well. 

The service was average for being on the strip. Our waitress was sweet and made a few recommendations on our orders. The ambience was also nice because even though we were technically sitting indoors, the view of the strip and the openness felt like I was sitting in an outdoor setting.

Fiance was happy with his burger with jack cheese (although commented the 1 leaf of lettuce was kind of sad), and we both loved the butterscotch shake we split.

We also ordered their special fries: spicy cheese curd fries - hand cut fries, crispy fried cheese curds, sriracha mayo, chopped parsley ($5.95). Dennis ordered the Mexican Burger - chipotle mayo, pickled red onions, jalapeno, cotija & jack cheese, and cilantro ($10.95). Sumana and Wayne both ordered one of the burgers on the specials menu: brie, bacon & fried egg burger - bigger than a ¼ pounder, melted brie, fried egg, date glazed bacon, hand cut fries ($10.95). We all ordered our burgers medium rare, but the waitress warned Wayne and Sumana that since their patties are smaller, they may come out more medium than medium rare.

II. The burgers
The burgers had nice squishy buns that were a little sweet, which complemented the patties well. For me, there was a little too much bun. The meat to bread ratio was a little bread heavy. The burger patty was uneventful. On the menu it says the patties are made with ""our secret recipe of prime cuts of beef, but the patties were a little dry and not very meaty. There was no sear to speak up, but there was some black pepper on the patties. The meat definitely wasn't the star of these burgers. The toppings took the spotlight. 

Trev and I ordered the Whiskey BBQ burger, which in addition to the toppings described above also came with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mayo. It was a little strange for me to have mayo on a BBQ burger, but Trev loved it. The onion strings got lost in the shuffle, which is weird because when I ate one on its own, it had some pow factor. We also got a side of extra pickles, which rocked!

Dennis got the Mexican burger and he was worried the cilantro would overpower everything, but it didn't. He said it was a good fusion burger and all the flavors worked together.

Sumana and Wayne got the brie, bacon and egg burger. It's weird that they went with a smaller patty on the special burger. The bacon was good, but they didn't really taste the brie. The eggs were cooked over hard, which kind of sucks because it's fun to have the yolk explode everywhere. To be fair, we didn't ask for it over easy. Maybe that was our bad.

III. The fries
The fries have the skin on. They were pretty good! Not too potatoey, but nice and chewy. They could use a tad more salt. The special fries were pretty good, but could use more cheese curds. The sauce was really yummy!

IV. Miscellaneous
Stripburger is located at the Fashion Show Mall. It's all outdoor seating, but they seem to have heaters for when it's cold and fans for when it's hot. The seating is nice and spacious. Since it's located on the corner right next to the street, you get a lot of noise from the cars racing by. It was a little distracting. 

Our server, Natalie, was very nice. They accidentally brought our special fries to another table that had the audacity to eat them! So they put in another order and brought it out to us asap. Since it was a mix up, they gave us the fries for free. Natalie was very apologetic and the manager came by to apologize to us as well. 

When we got the bill, they had automatically split it for us, which was really nice. They also had an automatic gratuity of 18% added. Not sure if it was because we were a bigger party or if it's standard practice. 

V. Value
The special was a good value since it came with fries, but for the other burgers the value isn't there. These are not worth $11.

VI. The verdict
It was alright. It definitely needs more meat flavor! The ratings: 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.3, and 3.3.

The green chile burger was average, as an purveryor of fine burgers, it was probably somewhere in the middle...not sure, the combo of everything just seemed a bit off.  I think the meat blend for the burgers, it didn't taste as premium as others...a nice char on the burger would have been good.

Gazpacho was great though and the cheese fries were rather amazing.  I've got to say, great service inside Cafe Babareeba (which I want to check out).",h-ajC_UHD0QAyAzySN6g2A,0,0,3,NPQ83E1CIzZ-l7H17ZP3Kw

Burgers are pretty amazing, and keep in mind I come from the gourmet burger capital of the world, Los Angeles so I am not easily impressed.  Las Vegas doesn't seem to miss their cue very often, and the sweet potato fries aren't too bad either.  

Spiked root beer float was very spiky, enjoyed every last drop of it but their bucket of prawns was merely a big aluminum bucket with 5...yes 5 prawns inside.  

Tad bit skimpy if you ask me but overall the food was well up to par and the atmosphere was thru the roof, not to mention it was the Monday after EDC at the Speedway.

I liked them, simple, salty and crispy, the man however said too much salt and left them for  me.
The burgers were $10 each, the fries $4 which is average, even cheap for the strip.
The place is noisy, i didn't like the music but you could only sit outside with speakers everywhere. More a place to drink and grab a bite before going to the club, less for dates or families.

I had ordered the cheese fries and the cheese did not look so good. Once I tasted it, I realized it was not real cheese. It tasted very rubbery and fake, almost like cheap nacho cheese from a dispenser. I ate most of it because I was buzzing pretty good and needed something to eat. I was not impresed with the meal.

I also split mini sliders with my girlfriend and they as well weren't all that great.  We looked at the sliders and they had a disproportionate amount of bread to burger size. The mini slider was very narrow thrown on in the middle of a big bun of sorts that was big for a slider size. It made eating the slider somewhat difficult. Overall, not impressed.

I do remember the bar was outside with tables to sit around to eat and drink.

I had the Mini Burger Sampler-$10.95. I liked the variety and that these were small bites. I choose: Blue Cheese, Hickory Bacon-Carmelized onions, with Hickory smoked sauce and Cheedar Burger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stripburger-las-vegas?select=6vBkjVbU2uZatWn2Rkxjww. Out of these 3-hickory bacon was my favorite and I do believe they sell these as a real burger size.

I would have been content on the minis but my eyes were bigger than my tummy and I orderd wings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stripburger-las-vegas?select=j3aeOfX325YW8s7sb3mGJg and (Onion) Strings-$3.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stripburger-las-vegas?select=07gowubWvaZZL7cXmlCmjA from the get go.

Stripburger probably saved me from a hangover and was convenient at the time, so thank you.  Other than that there's so many other spots I'd choose to eat at out here.",lmQLg_GG2yM0WcQ_qFwJMQ,2,2,3,bJsO0PVwzKn9Y46H9tA6Zw

Seriously though, this is a pretty cool place.  Located right on the 'strip' on Las Vegas Blvd right outside of Fashion Show Mall, Strip Burger ia a nice place to get a casual lunch. Tthe atmosphere is very nice as you can eat outside.  It is a very nice setting that makes you feel like you are on vacation.  Their burgers are very very fresh!  We ordered a side of fries which could have fed all of Cesar's Palace.  Huge!  Finish this and expect heart trouble!  On the down side, the service was a little spotty and the prices were a little more then I think they should have been.

I think one of the biggest draws about this place is that it is easily accessible from the strip (no walking through a casino maze to find it).  Also when I went on a Saturday night, it was very low-key and there weren't many people there (this might have been a fluke however).  It is a little on the pricy side, but not too expensive as long as you share fries, but don't expect to be stuffed when you leave.  Also if you are looking for a bar, this might be a good place.

At the North East corner of the Fashion Show Mall on Las Vegas Blvd. - it's across the street from the Wynn and Encore so there's a ton of foot traffic. No matter where you sit (it's all patio seating) you'll have a great view of Las Vegas's best!

This burger joint has become of favorite of ours when we're down on the strip because the food is good, the pricing is fair and the people watching is phenomenal! 

We love to use restaurant.com and this happens to be a newer addition to that site that sells out rather quickly each month. The nice thing is they restock the gift certificates at the beginning of each month so if you're on top of it you can snag one. They have both $10 and $25 gift certificates available. We purchased a $25 one.

We came down to the strip specifically to eat here. We parked just off the strip at Nordstroms and discovered that was quite a walk, however we discovered there's a parking lot for the mall right behind the restaurant so that will be good to know for next time.

There are so many tasty options here. My boyfriend ordered the Hickory Chicken Sandwich - $9.95, which was awesome! I ordered the Mini Burger Sampler which came with 3 sliders - the Blue Cheese Burger, The Jack Daniels Hickory Bacon Burger, and the Cheddar Burger - $10.95. All were tasty and I added bacon to each of them (for my boyfriends sake, since we end up sharing everything). As an appetizer we LOVE the fried pickles so we ordered the 'Threesome' as we usually do - a basket of Onion Rings, Fries & Pickle Fries - $6.95. This comes with a spicy dipping sauce similar to a spicy ranch, we also asked for a side of cheese sauce for the fries - it's like a melted cheese you'd put on nachos with green and red peppers in it. YUM!

Since we weren't worried about calories (this meal was all about taste), we also ordered a Fat Tire pint of beer - $5.75 and a Banana Milk Shake (heavenly)-  $4.95. We didn't come close to finishing even half of our food but wow was it good! We'll be back soon.

**Side note: they have Happy Hour daily in the bar area from 4-7pm and 11pm - close. $2 Coors Light, PBR & Bud Light drafts.**",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,15,8,4,duRp4Jii4vkk1s-rS_AnRQ

Thankfully, this place was open and on the way back so we wouldn't be subject to the lame options at our hotel. We got some food to-go, and though its neighboring restaurant Segundo was closed, we got to order off their menu, which was great because everyone wanted nacho fries. We also got a side of garlic parmesan fries that came from the Stripburger menu, to share. 

it didn't take terribly long to get our food, which was nice, and we waited to get back to the room before eating. It was kind of a bummer how small the nacho fries were for how much they cost (around $15). Also, we were all hungry so we ate, but we all agreed that the taste was mediocre. We know our nacho fries. The garlic parmesan fries were good though! 

Their biggest draw is that they're open and in plain sight while walking the strip late at night. Other people seem to be raving about the dining-in experience and burgers, so maybe that is worth trying. But, it's not on our must-return list.",xE_pQnbtMlyDtrwvyBZx7A,0,0,3,i1H66_KX6y9_soSDEChkjQ

We checked into our hotel just after 11pm on Wednesday night, were starving and just wanted something really casual, quick and easy but couldn't find much available within walking distance. 

We found Stripburger and it was perfect for our needs, late dining menu, super casual attire, and simple. My husband had a bacon cheeseburger with garlic fries and I ordered a bun-less turkey burger with avocado, sautéed mushrooms, grilled onion and tomato. 
We were starving so I completely forgot to snap any pics but they were decent sized burgers and had so much flavor. I tried a few of the fries and they were actually ""worth it"" fries. I rarely find any French fries ""worthy"" but these were extremely garlicky, with a good crisp to soft potato-y inside ratio. 

Given the circumstances, I'd definitely go back again but only in the event of late night dining availability within walking distance of our hotel. Other than that, there's just too many other options on the strip with way more to offer.",6EHmCBEh5pGuvs3BmhuPig,0,0,4,y__zyub1e-UgDkNZws3M5w

We were seated right away, ordered and the food was out in less than ten minutes! It felt like we just ordered, it was very quick! Even though it was fast, they didn't skim on flavor or juiciness. The burgers look just like the photos and each of us enjoyed our meal! We each seemed to be wearing whatever condiment in our face because it was so good.

As we were being seated by the sweet hostess, I noticed a young blonde girl sweeping by our table.  After being seated and looking at the menu for 3 or so minutes, that same girl who was sweeping came to our table.  She NEVER gave us her name, just asked what we wanted to drink.  Now I have been a server and a bartender at many places and I know the Universal Steps of Service!! Always start by being polite and saying Hello, my name is.... Come on! Common Sense!!! Anyway, she took our drink order and came back with it.  I had water my friend had an Iced Tea.  She forgot to bring a lemon with it.  That is also common sense.  She didn't try to up sell beverages.  Normally you ask, would you like to start off with a pepsi, ice tea, or an ice cold beer etc. but this was not even offered to us.  She then took our order and walked off.  I noticed that there was only one silverware wrap-up on the table and she did not notice it.  I waited to see if she would catch that.  Our food was delivered by a food runner and that food runner didn't catch the 1 silverware roll up either so I stood up and grabbed one from another table.  The food runner, also female said nothing to us. She did not ask if we had everything, if we needed anything, or to even enjoy our meal.  Jillian, was no where to be found.  We had our food for about 5 minutes before she even came over to see if we were okay or if the food was cooked correctly.  Well, my fries were a bit cold but I let it slide.  Our drinks ran low, so I pushed my glass toward the end of the table with hopes she would see it.  As she stood with her arms crossed against the wall I started to get mad.  Everybody knows when a drink is half full you refill it, but mine was completely empty. As she stood against the wall looking around I wondered how she did not ""see"" this.  As she walked to the back to avoid us I stood up and POURED MY OWN WATER from a pitcher that was by us.  YES, I poured my own water.  As I did this a server named ALEX came over and he was so polite and sweet.  He asked us if we were okay and if we needed anything.  He grabbed my friend more ice tea and he then bussed our table and took the dishes we weren't using all while our own sever Jillian watched him.  She is something else.  

Being a server is a team effort.  I would be livid if I had to pick up the slack for a lazy server who clearly was hating her life that day and who showed she did not want to be there.  So, with that said, I asked Alex what her deal was.  He said she was upset because her guest had been stiffing her or tipping poorly all day.  WELL I WONDER WHY!! Now comes the best part, she asked if we wanted desert then dropped our check off.  Her name was on the check so that is the only way I got her name.  I asked for a manager and relayed all of this to her as well.  The manager was extremely responsive and helpful.  She offered to do something for us but I said no.  I was not looking for a hand out just good service.  I told her that Jillian's poor attitude and lack of serving skills makes their place look bad and I just wanted to address the issue so Jillian's attitude could be adjusted for her next set of patrons.  Our bill was $29.00 so we left Jillian $3.00.  That is more than she deserved clearly.  Since I am in the Vegas service industry I just couldn't leave nothing.  I get it, we work for tips and that is our sole income.  But as I walked out I did hand Alex a $20 tip for being so polite and helpful.  He deserved it.  Now, the kicker of this whole experience..... as we left Jillian yelled out, ""ADIOS"" in a snide tone.   Are you kidding me!! How old are you!? So I asked again for the same manager and told her about that as well.  That is seriously uncalled for.  If I was Jillian's manager I would have sent her home to adjust her attitude.  I hope you are reading this Jillian because this is NOT how your treat your customer unless you want to get getting Zero to 10%tips.   Take some notes from Alex!

All in all I do love this spot.  The food is yummy and I haven't had a bad server experience until tonight.  Yes, I will return but you best believe I will not sit in Jillian's section again.  I'll save my $20 for the next server.",seh1_Whauw3PkES5CXvS1Q,2,0,2,09IxHp30twX_51s2y0Nf3Q

She did move us, and after that we sat in a good location. It is located on the strip and it was nice to sit outside with the misters.

TWO DOLLARS for well drinks and good beers?!?  DOLLAR 16 oz PBR's??      

We also had two orders of fries, but not one of the four of us were impressed. They were too dark, greasy and smelled like old oil. You would think in the middle of happy hour we would have received some fresh cooked fries. I have no doubt that 99 percent of their customers are tourists due to the location. So, maybe management isn't thinking much about reviews or repeat customers. But remember, us locals are still out there in force and we love good food and great places when we go out. And we always tell our friends what we think.  

Happy Hour is from 4pm-7pm and 11pm to close NIGHTLY!  This really has to be one of the best strip drink prices out there.",rplyzNz9auV_kMKvVbB_pg,4,1,3,fNUgrM1kNW-JymkO3ouXZQ

My wife and I were craving for burgers and found this place searching on my BlackBerry (now I know why they call these things ""crackberry""). We stopped to check out the menu, but when we heard about the $2 happy hour specials, we were sold. 

We sat outside along the bar, and while it was chilly outside, those heat lamps made it nice and toasty. Not much of a view of the strip at the corner of the Fashion Mall, but we did some people watching across the street from the Wynn hotel. We ordered a couple cheeseburgers and hamburger sliders each, along with some fries. The wait seemed to take forever, especially for such little-sized burgers. But when the food did arrive, we devoured those little suckers pretty fast. 

The burgers were tasty and juicy, a great deal at a couple bucks each. I also thought that the $8-9 price for one of their regular sized burgers wasn't too shabby either, considering it is Vegas. All in all, a good place to go if you don't want to either spend a ton of money at a sit-down restaurant or eat hot dogs on a stick with the teenage crowd at the food court upstairs. 

6 mini burgers, 1 order of fries, and 2 beers for around $20. Less money out of my wallet = more money for gambling. Or in my wife's case, more money for shopping.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,4,4,4,-wx-YhmZ1Pm3XQm8GCqkEw

Reasonably hearty and had flavor to them. I remember the hamburger bread being incredibly soft and fluffy and still somehow kept its shape, which I really liked. I wouldn't say they have the best burgers in the world, but I think they're better than average and I wouldn't mind eating there again when I visit. 

I ordered the green chili burger and thought it was OK. I took a bite of my husband's bleu cheese burger and wish I got that instead (I should've listened to the waitress' recommendation :)). I don't normally like the taste of bleu cheese and the burger was still good!

Fries:
Their fries are good as well - I really liked their stringy onion rings. 

Drinks:
I also liked their beer mojito and it's high on my list of favorite beers (I'm not an avid beer drinker though, so my preference may not be so hot with everyone). 

Service:
Our waitress was nice, quick, checked in on us from time to time and also refilled our water without us asking, so it's good. I don't expect for more. 

It's a good place to eat and for a reasonable price, especially considering how expensive eating in Vegas can be at some of the restaurants. For the two of us, we ordered a basket of fries, an alcoholic beverage and 2 burgers and the total came out to be around $36 w/o tip.

I had no choice here, where it's beer first, last and always.  Or a milkshake, which I haven't had since 1983 (so how come I'm not skinny?)   I would have preferred a Riesling, and even would have settled for a lowly white zinfandel.  Ix-nay on either.  Strike One for my first visit here.

So I won't drink, and I'll have coffee instead.  ""Yes, it's fresh,"" the waitress answered.  ""Ah, but do you have milk for it.""  ""No, just cream."" (See 1983 above). Strike Two.

Strike Three came close to happening.  I ordered the mushroom and cheddar burger with a salad on the side.  I was about to throw in the towel after the waitress said the dressing was a lemon vinaigrette, which I'd love to love, but most vinaigrettes are too tangy for my delicate Princess mouth.  She saved the day by offering to let me have ranch, and I got the feeling she was doing me a favor because of the first two strikes.  Oh, she was very pleasant about it, but I just sensed this wasn't in the script.

The burger was excellent, but almost rare, instead of the medium I ordered.  I like rare hamburgers, but the Food Police tell me not to eat them.  It didn't have a lot of the cheddar, which was fine with me, and the mushrooms were fresh and plentiful.  My husband had the same thing, and enjoyed his.  One friend ordered the turkey burger, and the other had the ahi tuna.  They loved them both.

It was almost like some divine entity was stopping me from coming here. The last time I tried to come here was in September 2010. I was in my car about to get into the parking building of the mall that  ""Stripbuger"" is located in when I got a telephone call. Apparently some guy who I barely knew from college put me down as one of his emergency contacts at work. I was told that they found him at ""Terrible's Casino"" laying on the floor and incoherently screaming and ranting before they decided to call the ambulance. That's his just-reward for going to college...a job at Terrbile's casino.

Getting back to subject. ""Stripburger"" was just as good as I anticipated. A lot of the people in Summerlin say that LBS at the Redrock is the best sit-down burger joint in town, but I gotta disagree. ""Stripburger"" is far superior to Redrock and has a million times better service.

I really like the fries here. They taste like they were pan fried with moderate amount of oil, instead of thrown into a giant deep fryer. They also intentionally slightly overcook the fries in order to achieve that really crispy texture. I greatly enjoy that style of the classic french fry. 

I got the Blue Cheese Burger. It was excellent. They put a practical joke amount of blue cheese in it. The meat is super fresh and not frozen, and the bun is one of those high quality sponge bread buns like what they got at In-n-out. 

The service was the best part. Our server was a man from Arkansas who was very charismatic and hardworking. I left him a very big tip on account of his great customer service. The host girl was very flirty and tremendously attractive. She was so distracting that I kept spilling my drink.
