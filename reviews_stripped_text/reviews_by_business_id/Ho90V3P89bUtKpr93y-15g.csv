We walked in at around 4pm and since it's an odd time to go get lunch or dinner we were basically the only table. The owner or manager came and chatted with us, explained the menu, the variety items and such.

The food did not take long to arrive and when it did I jumped right into my plate. It was simply amazing. All fresh ingredients, sauces made in house, beautiful presentation and the taste of every single item was well beyond my expectations.

We tried a few desert bites as well. They have a nice selection of resources- books and products for the vegan lifestyle. There's also raw food preparation classes the first Saturday of every month for those like me that need a few more ideas when cooking at home. 

I loved everything and I really can't wait to go back.",SJ6zBKHcoNVc5WPkO9p6xA,1,0,5,mMsxeJer1YKzkeH6l5mLpQ

But... there were a couple of things that just couldn't be overlooked. I found the service to be perfectly fine so no complaints there. True, the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, but I can overlook that if the food is amazing. But it wasn't quite amazing. The first huge indiscretion is that along with my tofu scramble I was served a ketchup that had honey in it. I'm only plant-based and not vegan so I was ok with that but this is unacceptable for a place that has vegan in its name, and many people would have rightfully been angry about this. Also, the tofu scramble and potatoes were unnecessarily oily. After I cleaned my plate (it was actually very good), there was a thick layer of oil all over my plate. I understand using a little oil but when you can taste it as a dominant flavor in a dish you've gone too far. The apple muffin, however, was delicious and perfect. I will come back soon because I'm guessing there are some real winners on the menu. I'll just ask if they can use a *lot* lighter of a hand with the oil next time.",WcnwW-_xRk9PxOlCtn_CKw,0,0,3,I4W9hw2uTrMrTsHvv_Qkpg

However, I wish there was more lighting at night on the exterior so that we can see the restaurant from the road as it was hard to spot at night. The portions of our food were ""what I am not used to seeing at other vegan places."" I had the classic burger with waffle fries. Normally when I go to vegan places the amount of fries I get is pretty generous. At this location I had maybe about 8-10 pieces of fries spread out on my plate which were small pieces a couple pieces were the size of a half dollar while the remaining 6-8 pieces were the size of a quarter. It was not packed on like I am used to at other vegan restaurants so when I received the food I was in a little shock. Not worth the price I paid for, for that meal.

I ordered the tamale plate but the rice and beans smelled and tasted rancid so I skipped over it and kept to the tamale which tasted like the kind you'd find in the freezer aisle of a market. The cheese pizzas we ordered were the Daiya cheese pizzas you could also get at the store, if you're lucky to find it. The only thing I really LOVED was the chocolate cake that had cherries in it which was delicious with the frosting on the cake. But everything is rather overpriced for tasting like freezer food.

Twice we had gone there to get juice. And twice we had encountered the very surly and customer-unfriendly owner of the establishment who looked as if he is just been awakened from a long and restless sleep. Please, understand that as a customer of this place, you are not allowed to have what you want. You will have to get what they give you instead. In case you wish to protest- the mean spirited owner we have dealt with twice - will shot down and refuse the service.
  I ordered the green juice. A young waiter took the order and charged the card. I asked if they had all the ingredients ( kale, celery, cucumber, parsley, spinach, collard greens). The waiter asked me for the menu back and looked at the ingredients. He acknowledged that they were out of collard greens. He offered to add extra kale instead. I insisted on substituting the missing product with parsley. He agreed and noted it on the order. As he started working on it- the juicer jammed due to not being properly cleaned. The owner came with a lug wrench, took apart the juicer, and cleaned it. After about 15-20 min the juicer was fixed. Then the owner decided to clean up the bar area. It took him another 7 min. In no time did they offer water or such. In fact, the old grouchy owner told us to go elsewhere cause he didn't feel comfortable with us watching him. When he did eventually start making juice, we discovered WHY he didn't want us watching him. He started to fill the juicer with celery sticks and kale, totally ignoring my request about extra parsley instead of missing herb. After we tried to stop him by reminding that we ordered extra parsley -  he immediately stopped, threw the remaining celery stick in the trash and replied ' how about I just give you the money back?!' To which we gladly said 'ok!'

My previous experiences haven't been that bad, but they certainly weren't great. Firstly...go to the bathroom somewhere else because the facilities here are gross. The service here is hit or miss, some of the employees are nice but the Management is horrendous. I've witnessed them verbally abuse their staff and even food delivery services drivers, like Uber and Grub Hub. I had ordered the classic burrito and eaten it and felt a bit off. Within the next few hours I definitely didn't feel good, and shortly after that I know it was food poisoning, or at least bad food. I haven't eaten there since. I also witnessed Management insist that an employee at the juice bar, pick up a sliced apple that fell on the dirty floor mat and use it in a juice. Luckily the juicer explained, that was against health code, but she got in trouble for doing the right thing. This verbal exchange happened in front of me and other customers. I would have called the Health Dept. right there if it went in the blender! I looked up the public records. See the photos I attached. You can see they have a good amount of demerits, even close to a C rating at times. Based on the records I can tell they are not going to change and have no real intention to run their food establishment safely for its customers. I find this dishonest practice and complete lack of respect for the publics health and well being despicable! These Two Managers have NO BUSINESS running a business. Aside from that, the actual menu items are a complete waste of your money. Most the specialty items are store bought, taken out of the package and then heated, or not, and put on your plate. And then your paying 12$ and up. Literally, freshly cut waffles fries..means frozen from the bag and stuck in the oven, and served at near room temp. There is a small stand alone freezer, over by the tea and coffee bar, and you can find your tamales in there. Frozen and off the shelf. What's really sad is that they found a way to muck up produce. The salad bar isn't sanitary, and from sitting at the juice bar, I could tell, First In First Out, was not a phrase Management has heard of or practices. You think your safe eating raw, but fruits and veggies go bad; but they don't care. And thats what makes this the even worse! they don't care about their customers who want to spend their money on a quality VEGAN experience! Being talked down to and disrespected by the two supposed owners, says it all. Save your money, go to ANY OTHER vegan spot in town. Oh, and based on the fact that they hold their employees checks for 3 weeks after they are due is a huge sign of them being in the pooper financially. And I think the nasty old man who is mean to al the customers, lives there!",zuopKcPI1VBVFG8ynCHIMA,6,0,1,aMHRtt4Bf_af1p8EHdRhsA

I came here on my lunch break today and was sat promptly and guided to a nice seat on the heated, enclosed patio. I ordered quickly (pesto tofu scramble burrito) as I had already decided what I wanted before I arrived. On a one hour lunch break, one must be efficient. I figured the food would be out quickly as the place wasn't very busy and what I ordered seemed pretty simple....25 minutes later when my food arrived I was contemplating throwing it in a to-go container so I could make it back to the office on time. 
The overall taste was very good but some of the potatoes were a bit undercooked for my taste. Although considering half of their menu is raw maybe this is their cooking style? The random orange and apple slice on the plate is also quite odd.
I had signed up a few weeks ago, on Facebook messenger, for a free truffle. But then they wouldn't allow me to use it without inputting my phone number and signing up for their dining membership. I did as I was told but felt a bit swindled in the moment, especially since I'm not sure I will be back. It might be in poor taste complaining about a free item but I was thinking the coupon was to simply get me in the door, not to force me to sign up.

I ordered the breakfast, that comes with a side of pancakes, and a tofu scramble with vegan sausage and hash browns. I enjoyed the pancakes, but didn't like the rest of the food. I just didn't enjoy the taste, and so I asked if I could switch out my dish for something different. The server prompted the manager to come over, and I expressed to her the same thing. She said I could get something different, but would have to pay for it along with my dish at a 10% discount. Also, she didn't understand why I didn't like the food, and to me it felt like I had offended her by not liking the food. Which everyone has different taste preferences and that's okay. She seemed a bit upset, and it didn't seem right to me that I couldn't get something different and that the discount was so little since I didn't want to eat the food. Earlier before speaking to her about the food, she was very polite, but after it felt to me she was being rude. Personally I won't be returning to eat here since there are many other vegan restaurants I can go to. The lack of communication and customer service towards the end wasn't okay with me. Ultimately I explained all my concerns to the server, didn't eat my food any further which I did not want to eat, and when I went to pay she gave me 20% discount instead.

We sat in the quiet garden/patio area which was great. The restaurants dining room itself was far from exciting so it was cool they had an alternative place to dine. Plants, a fountain, and high vaulted ceilings made for a quaint place to have brunch! 
Now to the menu...
To drink: I got the green zing and although it was tasty, it was centrifugally juiced versus cold pressed and this bummed me out a bit. It's not a BIG deal but it's worth mentioning.
Boyfriend got the pina cool-ada and liked it a lot. However, those two drinks alone cost me nearly $20 so I don't think I'll be getting any drinks next time. 
To eat: I got the pesto breakfast burrito and it was very very good. The ""eggs"" has great flavor and the pesto was spot on. Just wish for $11 and change this burrito had more bang for the buck. 
Boyfriend got the BBQ pulled jack sandwich and was very impressed. He eats meat and tries these places with skepticism but he thoroughly smashed this sandwich. The waffle fries though... They were so stingy. I guess they're weighed out but it was very disappointing.

I will cut to the chase..We ordered a Mediterranean burger and had a couple spoons of mixed fruit from the salad bar.

I saw both on the burger, but tasted neither. The burger was $16 and came with just a few cross cut fries. 

The fruit looked old and as though it had been sitting there for a few days. Side note, the salad bar is self service and is $9/pound..which in my opinion is pretty over priced.

The place did not disappoint. Warm, prompt service and many options to select from. I enjoyed a salad and washed it down with a healthy juice.
The only reason they fall short of the 5 stars, is because most of the menu is based on vegan substitutions of the usual suspects, Pizza, Burgers, Sandwiches, Burritos, Tostadas. IMHO, there is no need to try to replicate those items, you already got us, we are Vegan, we don't walk through the door because we want to have a burger, I think we have already transitioned to the bright side, and quite frankly, you will not turn a non vegan into began just because you serve them the Vegan alternative to their flesh eating ways.

I met up with my sister for a weekend in Vegas. We decided to have brunch before her flight and we truly left the best for last with Go Vegan Cafe. This location is a bit off the beaten path, but there's only so much of the Strip I can take in one sitting. 

We arrived minutes after they opened and had the covered patio all to ourselves. (I believe I spotted air conditioning units, which is necessary in Vegas heat) Our server was warm and friendly and answered our questions? about the extensive menu and provided great suggestions for our newbie experience. We finalized our choices to: the omelet and raw collard greens wrap. We also added the breakfast sausage because the server told us it was house made. 

I've had a couple vegan omelets in the Boston area and, while they were both amazing, they resembled more of a crispy crepe than? an omelet. That was not the case here. With a fluffy, souffle-like texture, it was the closest thing to the real deal I've ever had. The oat-based sausages were equally amazing. (Double check with your server if you're gluten free) As a bonus, a little muffin came as an accompaniment to our omelet. So much bang for your buck with this dish! To my absolute delight, it ended up being a seasonal strawberry rhubarb and it was perfectly baked. It was a ""This is vegan!?"" moment, for sure. The collard wrap was refreshing to eat as we felt the desert air start to warm up. The crisp wrap and creamy filling was a satisfying combination.

After our meal, we walked over to the register by the front door and saw the workers stocking the salad bar, in case you are in need of a quick meal. Another FYI, they give you stevia with coffee. I'm? particular about coffee and think stevia leaves a bit of a metallic taste, but it didn't affect me since I carry around a travel size maple syrup in my purse. The coffee itself is cold-brewed, which means it's less acidic and easier on your tummy. Ever notice when milk looks curdled when you pour it into your coffee? That's a reaction to an acidic brew.",92QbGGM9PAyqtW_WVlehiw,12,8,5,-A3YNZ6poRq3tO23Rq9vGA

1926700,2016-08-14,0,Ho90V3P89bUtKpr93y-15g,"We arrived a little over an hour and a half before a scheduled float next door and intended on getting a light meal in before our float.  When we arrived the restaurant was empty.  It was 110+ degrees outside so it was a little warm, but not terrible inside the cafe.  They had all the lights off and ceiling fans running, it reminded me a little of eating at places outside the US where they don't rely on 24-7 AC.  

We sat down and looked over the menus for a few minutes, we ordered a green juice, raw pizza, and jackfruit tacos.  The juice arrived shortly, maybe 10 min?  The man who took our order was the one who made the juice.  A middle aged woman was also slowly pacing behind a counter watching  us, but aside from that they appeared to be the only staff in the front of the house. They were both kind of joyless and not at all welcoming.

 Another table of two arrived after my friend got her juice.  We were chatting and I noticed this table received their food order before ours even though they arrived about 20 minutes after we did.  We continue to chat and anticipate our food.  I checked the clock and noticed we had been waiting over 45 min for our food and only had about 15 min before our scheduled float.  I got up and inquired, and apparently the man forgot to put in our order.  I asked to just cancel the order and pay for the juice as we had to go.  He offered to have the food prepared for us after our float, and I declined as the point was to eat BEFORE the float.  He didn't seem to want to do that and said ""well they already started the food, it should only be about 5 more min"", well by then it would be time for us to be next door.  I insisted that we just get it to go then, and he still brought it out on plates.  I asked for the check and some boxes.  Pretty unpleasant.  The food was okay.  I enjoyed raw pizza that had hummus on it, but otherwise it wasn't anything special and certainly not worth waiting over an hour for.  (it's hummus spread on dehydrated nut crust and sprinkled with chopped tomato and arugula, it should have taken maybe 2 minutes to assemble at the most.

I really enjoyed them. If you have any problem with soggy, that could be an issue because they send the cakes out in a plate with a puddle of a light syrup in the bottom. It didn't really bother me though honestly. 

The Vegan thing isn't really for me as I eat a lot of protein. When they say vegan they mean vegan. Theres no hidden beef burger on the menu unfortunately. 

We sat in the greenhouse-like area outside of the main dining room. It was really nice ambiance with a cool fountain. Unique seating area. 

The problem with that was that we literally waited 15 minutes for service and the place wasn't very busy at all. After about 5 minutes we went inside to use the restroom and told the waiter we were outside and it still took 10 minutes or so for him to come out and grab our orders.

I decided on the traditional burger w sweet potato fries and a choco-cinn smoothie. My friend ordered the loaded nachos and another item I can't recall, but is pictured (tostadas?). 

Our food arrived fairly quickly and it looked really good! I am by no means a vegetarian or vegan, but I do love veggie burgers. This was not disappointing!

Check out is done up front. I had a bit of sticker shock as this place is not cheap by any means, unless you get a special or the salad bar. My burger and fries were $14 and regular smoothie was $7.

So we came here after a night of drinking looking for a baller breakfast and yeah, we found it. I got the mexicali tofu scramble with roasted jalapenos and the nachos. 

OH MY GOD.

These two things were AMAZING! The nachos tasted just like regular nachos, it's hard to believe they weren't loaded with actual cheese and meat. And as for the tofu scramble, one of the things I miss most after going vegan are eggs, but this tofu scramble proves that the chef here does tofu better than chickens do eggs.

My boyfriend ordered the classic burger and the gluten free bun was amazing. I loved that the burger patty was visibly made of black beans but had a very subtle and inviting flavor unlike other over-seasoned ones I've had. 
Before we left we grabbed some gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, which were pretty pricey $6.48 for 4 small cookies, but delicious nonetheless. I'll definitely try it again.",uWVUjAWiEZL3xtNJnM3fRw,1,2,4,WjmqV01bCORrQpi5BO7eAw

This is our first vegan restaurant to have a salad bar. It has a small corner dedicated to vegan snacks and vitamins like a mini grocery store. On a raised platform, there's a small display of desserts ranging from cookies to cakes.

The menu sounds appetizing. Their fresh juice drinks are absolutely fabulous. The burger did not have a hamburger/ciabatta bun (as pictured on menu) but a flat, hard, whole wheat English muffin-type bun. Extra crispy waffle fries were edible.

The female employee was nice. The older male employee checked up on our food and didn't smile. 

Large floor plan but it needs to be redesigned for a better flow...maybe someone should also redesign the menu. I felt the menu was catered more towards raw vegan than vegan. I'll come back to grab their refreshing drinks.",K3KMfjsCQdtwmXexqBUssw,8,6,3,BYDGm62AU6036yBag83vGg

Walking-in it's very plain on the inside, looking like a half finished school cafeteria with a small grocery section selling vegan or vegetarian products. I sat down and realized I was the only person in here, which can be creepy. The menu is overwhelming, as there's a lot to choose from, to make matters worse, I wasn't really given any guidance on how to tackle it, so I went with the Lentil Loaf sandwich and the Roasted Veggie quesadilla. 

The Lentil Loaf was good, but a little on the dry side. It needed some type of sauce to moisten it up. The menu said it comes with BBQ sauce, but there was little to no sauce on this sammie. This was very filling and if you're looking for heavy meal, this is a good option. 

The Roasted Veggie Quesadilla had a lot more flavor, but it was greasy! Like needing to wash my hands after every bite, greasy. There was cheese on this, dairy free cheese, and to be honest, the difference wasn't ultra noticeable and I actually liked it. The roasted veggies still had a snap to them and a little heat that slowly escalated with every bite. Good stuff!

The design and the service here needs a huge upgrade, I only received one glass of water, which I had to ask for and was checked on only twice during the entire meal.

2.) my mom can't eat onions, they don't sit right with her so she asked for no onions on her BBQ sandwich and when we finally 45 mins later received the food, there was pickled onion on it AND onion in the mixture with the mushrooms. ( which we didn't know about the onions  being in the mix as well if it had just been the pickled onions on top we could have just picked it off and be fine with it. ) She sent it back asking to take it off of the bill  and didn't bother re ordering since it took so long for our original order. 
3.) THIS is the most angering part of our experience here. We told the woman up front about what happened with my moms order and here's her response "" oh. Well if you would have said you had an allergy we would have not put onions on it.""
To which I replied "" if a customer asks for an item to not be on her plate it shouldn't be there we shouldn't have to say it's an allergy."" Her response made me very angry because to me it sounded like if you don't have an allergy and request your food that you're paying for a certain way, we won't do it. There's more than just allergy reasons to not have an ingredient in the food you're paying for to not be on the plate.

I hate leaving bad reviews but I just paid $14 for a small smoothie and a half cup of soup? The employee was nice but that's kinda overkill. Smoothie was good and soup was decent but it was literally broth and nothing else inside. Also while I was there a customer came in and asked one of the workers for a smoothie that will give her energy and his reply was read the ingredients. If you're serving healthy food workers should be somewhat knowledgeable especially if your paying these kind of prices. I waited almost 10 mins for a cup of soup that just needed to be poured and handed to me and the place was dead

My dad and fiancé are not vegan, but both enjoy the food regardless.

My dad and I went here for lunch and had a very relaxing time with delicious food. We ordered the following:

Yummy ""Grilled Cheese & Tomato"" with delectable ""Sweet & Spicy Fries""
Excellent ""Eggplant Parmigiano"" with Mouth watering ""Coleslaw""
Best Ever ""Cold-pressed Coffee & Coconut Water over Ice""

During another visit, I ordered a decadent Double Layer jelly filled Chocolate Cake to bring home for my guy and it's to die for! 

In fact, today we're currently awaiting delivery of that cake, Chile Relleno, Enchiladas & Cheese Fries. I'm certain the food will be the highlight of our day and it's been a great day! 

Restaurant Details:
I love the garden area with the fountain. It's sometimes difficult to hear out there from the echo of the water fountain, but I still love it. Inside is pleasant and inviting too. The ambiance is so peaceful that it's somewhat romantic. The place is spacious with a quaint feel. There's a salad bar full of fresh, wonderful looking produce, a bakery counter with enticing sweets and a juice bar.  

Service Details:
They never rush you. In fact, they invite you to make yourself at home which brings a sense of relief from the madness of the day. Everyone I encountered was friendly, caring and attentive to requests. 

I also attended an awesome Raw Food Workshop here and look forward to attending more! Check out govegan.cafe for details. 

Browsing the books for sale and discovering other things in the market section that I never knew existed was cool.

I think this would be a great place to do some studying, research, reading, writing, etc. 

Oh...as for the wait at the Café, I was busy dealing with a situation on the phone while we waited for our meal, so it didn't seem like it took long at all. 

And, the food we ordered today was delivered by onlinerestaurants.com. The driver was delightful and the grub was absolutely delicious!

We tried the breakfast and both had a Tofu scramble.  Mine a Mexicali with pinto beans, vegan cheese and very fresh guacamole.  Hers was the Spanish with roasted veggies and she added roasted Jalapenos.  Both were excellent and filled us all day:  I'd match these scrambles against any regular egg dishes anytime.   The veggies were fresh and crisp as well as varied and abundant (I think that's enough adjectives for now...)

I recommend asking for the homemade Jalapeno hot sauce.   It is for those who love it hot.   I wanted to take the container home.

We came back specifically to try the dinner menu of enchiladas and BBQ jackfruit sandwich.      The enchilada was very good with fresh Guacamole and a good tortilla.   

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the jackfruit sandwich unless you like enjoy your BBQ bland.   I missed the spicy kick of a good sauce.  Additionally the gluten free roll was chewy.   In their defense I've found very few gluten free bread products that are good.   It's hard to pull off as whatever gluten is, it is delicious.

4721016,2017-05-20,1,Ho90V3P89bUtKpr93y-15g,"First time I've eaten at a Vegan restaurant, and I've got to admit I was very impressed by the overall quality. The food tasted healthy and fresh while still full of flavor.

I've been looking to eat less meat and dairy for health reasons, and we were nearby so decided to give it a try. I've had a few vegan dishes that surprised me lately, so this place seamed like something I really wanted to try. Both my wife and I were very happy with the outcome.

Just an FYI before I talk about the food we ordered, this place has a full menu of cooked vegan items and raw vegan items. I understand some vegans don't want to eat anything cooked (I don't get that one at all, but to each their own) so this place has plenty of options in that area to. My wife and I stuck to cooked food though. They also have full selection of fresh juices and smoothies.

I ordered the Spanish southwest scramble, which uses tofu and vegan cheese to emulate an egg scramble. It came with breakfast potatoes and a vegan chocolate muffin. My wife got the grilled veggie sandwich, which comes with a side (my wife chose potato salad.

We sat in the patio area, which is still indoors but is beautiful and has a nice fountain in it. The staff was extremely pleasant and our server offered recommendations, and later even told us a bit about how the food is prepared.

The food came out and it was honestly some of the best plating I have ever seen outside of a fine dining establishment. The use of greens and the different colors from the plates and veggies just made everything pop out. I recommend checking the pictures for this place.

The scramble was incredible, and I would defy anyone to think this wasn't an egg dish. The breakfast potatoes were very good, and the muffin was good to, though much denser than a normal muffin. The veggie sandwich and potato salad were also very good. Both the scramble and sandwich used vegan cheese and you really couldn't tell it wasn't dairy.

I only have one real complaint and that is the portion sizes for the price. The building that Go Vegan Café is full of health related places (yoga, herbal supplements, etc.) and the portions are probably very healthy for you in terms of calories. Us Americans are used to big meals, and I'm OK with the smaller size provided (heck, I would be far better off eating smaller portions),  but I can't help but think the prices should be just a tad lower. My wife's sandwich was made with bread smaller than your typical loaf you'd get at a grocery store, and it wasn't exactly loaded with veggies. My omelet was also small and they portion of breakfast potations was the smallest potato side I have probably ever had with a meal. I wonder if they just charge more because this is in a ritzier part of town where people are used to paying more, or if they charge more because the vegan food is so labor intensive to prepare. I hope the latter.

Speaking of prices, their juice and smoothie menu seemed really overpriced. It scared me away from trying anything on it, but based on their food I would think their fresh drinks are very good.

I don't want anyone to think I'm being overly negative about the prices here, as I'm not trying to be. This place was very, very good. I actually wish it was closer to where I live, as I am on the other side of town, and I would be stopping here regularly if it wasn't such a drive. I am planning on going here again if I end up on that side of town again soon.

This is a great place for a light and healthy meal. Its a perfect spot for breakfast or lunch, and don't let the Vegan thing scare you away. Even devout carnivores would enjoy a meal here.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,4,VJgcKxWdMgw3Af-VuI6D7g

She uses the wrong high speed juicer.  She needs the Norwalk juicer because most of the juices are going straight to the trash can with her high speed juicer and your getting mostly water.  You can tell because if you leave her juice on the table for a minute it separates and you get water at the bottom.  Norwalk juicer doesn't do that.  You get the full nutrition with the right juicer.  She is using the wrong type of juicer.

*Cons- The service was pretty lackluster and it took forever till someone actually came out to bring even some water ( we were acknowledged when first walking in). While it looks plentiful in the photo the side of fries they give you is super small, at least my serving was. That however wasn't the big blunder but the fact that my waffle fries tasted like day old reheated fries and they weren't even hot. Just room temperature like they'd sat out forever. I brought this to the attention of our waitress and she was kind of dumbstruck. Her reply was a "" Oh umm, okay. Sorry"". Just that and nothing else, no comp on our bill or offer of fresher fries.

You are supposed to order at one counter and then walk across to restaurant to another counter to pay. Just a little awkward. Their prices are a little more on the expensive side for a cafe, but that's to be expected at health conscious eateries.

Go Vegan Cafe has so many options that I literally started salivating while looking over the menu, they have everything from freshly made and super healthy smoothies to superbly made sandwhiches, tacos, quesadillas, and much much more. 

First the customer service was exceptional, the staff seemed very relaxed and friendly. As I waited for my meal to be ready I was offered a sample of their ""kookier and kreme "" smoothie and it was absolutely delicious!! I didn't order it because I didn't bring much money with me (I will next time though). 

I walked around this place and there is plenty of seating on the inside, then I saw the outdoor portion. It contained a magnificent water fall structure with greenery, beautiful pieces of art on the walls and the temperature felt great as it was well ventilated. I sat out here and I was impressed by how relaxing it was despite it being 105 degrees outside. You would t know it by sitting in this area. 

I ordered the Buffalo jack fruit sandwich, with a side of sweet potato waffle fries (you have a choice of a side). I wasn't impressed with this plate but I ate it anyway because I was very hungry. Also, this was my first time trying jack fruit so it wasn't a clever choice on my part as I didn't know what to expect. I also ordered the classic quesadilla and it was delicious!!!

It's always nice to go to a place where I know that there are things my son can eat. It's a rather large place, with a register in the very front, a long salad bar (think Whole Foods) in the middle, some tables and big, comfy booths. There's also a small dessert case and some books, snacks and supplements for purchase. All vegan.

Before stopping in, I checked out the menu so I was pretty sure of what we wanted- just a snack to share and a smoothie. We ordered the Cheese Fries and a large Berry Good smoothie. The portion was small. Extremely small, for $8. As was the $8 smoothie. I would have hated to see what the actual small smoothie size looked like.

We got 2 or 3 normal sized waffle fries and the rest were like the remnants in the bottom of the bag, which only took up 1/3 of a small salad plate. They weren't crispy. At all. In fact, and I even hate to say it, but they were soggy. The vegan cheese was melted (as much as it can be). It was like they put them in a microwave. I buy the Alexia waffle fries and the same vegan cheeses they have, and use them on a daily basis, so I know what's up.. My son, who's the fry king, didn't even want to eat them. That might not really mean anything to you, but that speaks volumes to me. He's legit a fry critic. If they are actually good, he'll wolf them down. But he doesn't like soggy fries. Sorry. The pico and guac were meh. It seemed like there wasn't anything on the plate that was made in house. But there were micro greens decorating the plate.

The smoothie was good. It's hard to mess up a smoothie though. But for $8, I can't believe at how small it was. I'm going to give them another shot because I do really want to like it and it's somewhere that can accommodate all of our families food allergies/intolerances.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,4,0,3,2YDYGcQfn2LG9aPenZ_Gdw

We decided to order family style and ordered the following items:
Fruity Pancakes, The Loaf (Lentil Loaf), Tofu Scramble, Fried Avocados, and Sausage Links. 
Once we placed the order, I decided to also order a coffee drink. Our waitress was so sweet and offered to customize my drink with fresh coconut water, suggesting to include it in a blended beverage because I could not decide on what I wanted, I was struggling between a blended Mocha vs. Iced Coffee over Coconut Water.  The waitress said they could just add Coconut Water to my blended beverage, it'd be a little unconventional but they could do it. i was really happy with this suggestion but then one of the owners came up to our table discouraging my custom order. ""Why do you want coconut water in your blended drink"", he asked me rudely. I was a little puzzled, I just wanted to try something new, but didn't want to make a big deal out of it so I changed my order and I  simply ordered Iced Coffee over Coconut Water. The beverage was delicious, but I was put off by the fact that the owner had to come out and have a conversation with me. 
Our waitress also returned to say that they could not accommodate cooking 1 pancake. We had asked earlier since we were tasting a lot of different foods if this was OK, but again, one of the owners remained inflexible and basically said it's all or nothing. We begrudgingly ordered the full order of pancakes. 
Finally, the food itself arrived. It's no surprise that a lot of the items were hit or miss. The Fruity Pancakes were delicious and the Tofu Scramble, i couldn't even tell they weren't real eggs. I liked the Lentil Loaf, even though it was walking the line of moist and dry. The sauce tasted great on it. 
The bad? The sausage links were mealy and fell apart into pieces and the fried avocado wasn't even fried, just rolled around in a lot of spices. We finally confronted the other owner about our experience, and she was really understanding. Based on the food and how understanding the other owner was, I would still give this place 4 stars, they did a great job with the entrees, but with the other owner having that conversation with me, I must give it 3 stars. I've never had someone discourage me or my party from a custom order to the point where they have to personally talk to us about it...Hopefully, if you come here you will just have a positive experience with the food.",4ECIXWllFTxtJaj1cKOZWw,8,7,3,Csgix_fc3UsHfE8KMz5yVg

Once I was fed, I noticed how clean and relaxing the space is. Great music. The servers are chill and the one at my table was kind and had a great presence. 

She suggested a coffee drink and it was everything she promised and more - with cashew milk. 

We had two tofu scrambles. They were beautifully prepared and presented and the portions were generous. Each one come with a muffin. Pretty sure it is gluten free. 

Finished with three nibs from behind their display case. Highly recommend. 

I go to workout classes in this building and live down the street - I will definitely be coming back to try the salad bar and other menu options. Thank you guys!!

When I used to live in NYC, there was a semi well known ""Juice Bar"" on St Mark's for a while that was a front for selling illegal things.  Walking into this pretty empty space totally reminded me of that.  Aside from the salad bar in the center of the relatively big room, one would be hard pressed to tell if the restaurant was coming or going.  There was a sushi display case at the rear counter from probably like 4 businesses ago and a bar on the right that looked like it hadn't seen a patron in years.  With its basement type ambiance, Go Vegan Café is clearly a takeout type eatery.  I doubt a person that lives this type of lifestyle cares about any of that since a lack of vegan options in the neighborhood would totally supersede atmosphere.

The ""Raw Portobello Burger"" with its nut patty (made with almonds, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, & carrots) was better than expected.  The creaminess of the almond ""cheese"" and avocado made for a more than passable garden sandwich.  The onion rawtilla bun wasn't flimsy at all and held everything together nicely.  The ""fries"" were simply 3 slices of breaded avocado hmmmm. My wife liked her ""Veggie Wrap"" which was basically a reshaped salad as collard greens were used as the tortilla.  The house slaw that came with her dish with its unique dressing was the tastiest thing we had.  

Two dishes and veggie juice came out to $37, yet both of us were still hungry later.  Wanting to stay consistent with the whole raw evening, I ate a couple of bananas later on.  There's really no rush for me to return, but if I find myself on one of those beefx5 kind of weeks, this would be a good way to change up the eating cycle.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,75,57,3,WO4DnWKRszK35mzwwElOwQ

I had the spicy raw burger nut patty. Full of flavor, and filling--emphasis on filling; I came in pretty hungry and left completely filled up. The balance on the dish is also tremendous--no single flavor is overwhelming. The bun is a bit tough, so I ended up eating it separately; it's filled enough that picking it up and biting it is a bit inconvenient.

The reason for the low rating is based solely on the food.   My boyfriend said that if this was his first attempt at eating vegan he'd never ever try it again.

Nothing tastes good.   The only thing we found edible was the burger patty.   We started with the Mediterranean plate.   The hummus was dry and tasted like tuna.   The baba ganoush tasted horrific.   The falafel was dry and flavorless.  I ordered the jackfruit bbq sandwich.   The sopa was hard and dry and there was so much liquid that it squirted all over my hands, face, and shirt.  

All the plates came with pea shoots and an apple and orange slice.  There's no need for this.   The expensive plates should have something of substance like more of the meal we ordered.   My bfs burger came with like 10 fries.   The thing that actually made me mad about the fries was they it says they are baked but it's clear they are purchased and were fried previously. 

We also didn't like the fact that the cooks had to come out to the salad bar to get veggies and supplies to cook in the back.   This seems off to me and I did not like that.
