It makes me feel grossed out on knowing how dirty our grill really was after seeing what an AMAZING job Oliver did cleaning it..

When we moved into our home a year ago our built in grill wasn't too appealing, a few hours later, it looked brand new. Oliver's professionalism, promptness and attention to detail is truly exceptional. Suffice to say our grill has received plenty of use over the course of the past year, so much so, that Oliver has been out two more times and each time we have been thoroughly pleased with his service. We will continue to use Memphis BBQ Cleaning Service and highly recommend them. My only regret is not writing this review sooner.",dyqmdq8izFy7Ho_z4qyrCw,0,0,5,mLn1hgBQXeQnOnGc4cRDLw

2212498,2018-03-04,0,2iWpS2xe9rBaFAv1CJuz3g,Oliver was recommended to me to repair my weber grill.  He was awesome.  I called him in a panic and he came out the next day.  He was punctual and very knowledgable.  He was able to repair my grill in a very reasonable amount of time.  Once he was done he took the time to show me what he had done and that everything was back to working.  His prices were fair and he was very clean with his work.  I look forward to using his company again when it is time to clean our grill.,CQRkj_c4P6c0eZkUWyhWNw,0,0,5,aeE7VZKIheEVTReTqGZjug

I would periodically clean my grill grates over the years but I could never get it as clean as I wanted it to be. But after Oliver spent a few hours doing his thing, my grill looked brand new!

He explained what he would be doing and started his work right away. He did outstanding work and now my grill is ""like new"". I have had my grill cleaned before and I know that person didn't do all that Oliver did, yet the other guy charged me almost double of Oliver's final cost.
