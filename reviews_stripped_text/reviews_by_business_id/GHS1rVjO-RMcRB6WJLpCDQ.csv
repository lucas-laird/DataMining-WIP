On the way back we decided to stop at this place for some last minute shopping. I want all of you consumers to be aware of the Asian man who sells the charger cords for the iPhones. He has them hanging freely and charges by the set. The chargers will last about 8 hrs and that's about it. He charged me 10bucks for two. I believe I purchased them Tuesday and they've already gone out. The mall is patronized by tourist so it's not like you can go back and demand a regular...???!. Also they could upgrade this outlet. It smells and most of their stuff is outdated. It's not compelling at all.

The customer service alone is worth the trip over. It's easy to stay on ""the strip"" as a tourist. But I am glad I ventured off a bit to check out the outlet.

I would advise anyone coming to the outlet to get there a little early. It is definitely one of the busier outlets that I've seen. It is also an outdoor seating so getting out before the temperature heats up would be ideal.

One of the main perks of the mall is definitely the wide range of stores that are located within the facility. They range from the Gap, Carters, Nike, Hot Topic, Levi, Movado, Kate Spade, Burberry, Ferragamo, etc. So really something for everyone. And the discounts were amazing at almost every store from around 40% to 75% off.

It's our bad that we parked the car near a popular brand store which was on the opposite side of where banana republic is. An this is why I don't like outdoor shopping!

The good thing is that that there are a loto of place you can sit down and relax for a big, which is quite necessary on hot days. We also grabbed a coffee at starbucks, which was nice.

Spontan - bitte nicht lachen! - kam mir das Ganze ähnlich vor wie Zweibrücken; vor allem der schrottige Lauren Factory Outlet. Wie andere Qyper schon bemerkten: nicht zu vergleichen mit anderen Outlets in den USA in denen es wesentlich gediegener bei niedrigeren Preisen zugeht. Es war unser zweiter Besuch hier - den Outlet South hatten wir auch schon probiert. Sicher kann man den einen oder anderen Schnapp machen - aber wenn man gezielt nach hochwertigen Artikeln zu günstigen Preisen sucht (nicht nur die retournierte Ware vom letzten Jahr...), dann haben wir uns hier nicht richtig gefühlt.

Tips:

1. I implore you to get there before noon to shop or be prepared for carmageddon in the parking structure. 

2. The VIP coupon book available for purchase at the information booth: don't get it. It's really not worth your money considering you're NOT allowed to combine the sales within the coupon book with the deals already occurring in the store. And chances are, the ones in the store are better anyway. Unless you're planning on dropping hundreds for a Kate Spade handbag to get a 15% deal, not worth your $5. You can preview it if you'd like though.

3. If you manage to get there early with fewer people, the crazy packed stores include Polo Ralph Lauren and Banana Republic. The line for Banana was insanely long so I'd suggest you hit that store first if it's one of the stores on your list. 

Otherwise, this outlet was huge! We didn't even shop all of it because our feet were so dang tired already. The only downside to this outlet would be like sometimes it doesn't seem like an outlet at all because the prices are still the same for some stores. It was a hit or a miss, but even during this after Christmas setting, there were more misses than hits. 

4 stars for variety, aesthetics, and the fact that I got Nikes for $60 here and boots for only $20.",-i0bd-Ism_Ee-bRKRO9N1g,0,1,4,_7ZCQS9cP9bq7fm6dw9D2w

Burberry was a mess, merchandise all over the damn place, hard to find anything and prices were about the same as at the non-outlet location. Bleh.

I have the shops I always hit and the wife always hits her own shops.  If I'm doing well in the casino, I will try to splurge and get a nice gift for her.  Trust me, there are plenty of spots that she will love.

I usually frequent the spots that I can't find near LA like AG Jeans or True Religion Outlets.  Can't beat the prices and I don't need the latest styles.  Perfect for outlets.

If splurging for the wife, I hit Kate Spade or Burberry or Coach.  I can usually find something to buy.  She on the other hand doesn't like to splurge so she hits places like Banana or Ann Taylor.  Good deals all around.

Our latest trend has been shopping for baby clothes since we had a little one recently.  Carter's, Osh Kosh, Gymboree, and Children's Place are the spots to shop.  Seriously, they grow out of their clothes so fast, outlet shopping is perfect for them.  Brand new car smell without the brand new car prices.  You should shop these spots twice a year minimum to load up on the next size gear. (OMG their feet grow so fast...)

Like everybody else, if you're there for a leisurely shopping trip, go in the morning or evening.  It's hot and no cover available.  Going from 100 degree weather to A/C climate stores can't be good for you.  I don't know who they are trying to fool with those misters all over the place.  Those don't help unless you plant your face in front of one of them and hope that there's a breeze right after.

BUT, if you are a serious shopper and know what you want, go for the day trip.  Get there, hit your stores, and get out.  OR if you like the heat, hey, more power to you.  

Another thing, if it rains, again, no cover except for certain areas.  Outdoor malls are nice but not suitable for such extreme weather.

1228956,2011-01-23,0,GHS1rVjO-RMcRB6WJLpCDQ,"One thing I've recently noticed is how polarizing the local malls are.

Meadows: Reasonably priced and accessible, but rather average and is slowly but surely losing the allure it once had.
Boulevard: Good selection in the stores that are available, but it seems like every other time I visit another store has closed or is going out of business and it has pretty much COMPLETELY lost it's allure.
Fashion Show: Great, diverse range of stores, but uppity and filled with too. many. TOURISTS.
Forum Shops: Accessible for a mall of it's kind, but gimmicky.
Grand Canal Shoppes/Palazzo: Very nice, but overtly-gimmicky and borderline inaccessible. 
Miracle Mile: Has a sense of fun to it, but trying too hard to be edgy.
Crystals: Looks pretty, but is mostly filled with a bunch of stuff we've already seen before. 
Outlet Center: Great deals, but kind of stale, if that makes sense.
Galleria: Seems appealing, but way too far from me to begin with so why bother?

The Premium Outlets is pretty much the only local mall which has no serious drawback to speak of in my opinion. True, it's outdoor, which will be a bitch in the summer months but it's a price I'm more than willing to pay. It's essentially a combination of all the pros of each of the malls I've already listed with none of the cons that make me groan in the back of my mind as I walk through the halls of each one.

Protip: The deals are very good, but remember to be careful. Pay very close attention as some of the stores are either priced exactly the same (or in some cases, actually charge MORE) because they believe that since it's an outlet mall it MUST be discounted, right? And it works, judging from the patrons I've seen in the stores who are guilty of this and seem to be completely blind to the fact that they're not getting a very good deal at all. 

The mall itself is a very interesting environment. It really reminds me of San Diego.

Unfortunately most of what you will find is ""made for outlet"" product lines.  There are still some stores that carry current season items just at a discount so don't be afraid to ask.  

Bring snacks, there is not much for food here, and food court lines can be long.  Bring an umbrella in the heat of summer as there is no shade.

As a local in Las Vegas I don't shop here often as it has the worst parking in town and any prospective savings can be lost in the cab ride to the center for quick trips.  If you are not trying to park you have no worries, but on both weekdays and weekends I have encountered closed parking garages.  Hopefully there is a plan to increase parking as the center is huge and hiking from the main South garage to Cheesecake Factory in the summer heat is a hike and quite miserable.

What I did see was the following:

* Plenty of vendors at the kiosks selling crap.  Why in the hell do I need a ball, made of slime, that you throw against a window just to watch it creep down the window?  Yeah, I bought 3.
* A Nike outlet store where it was wall to wall people yet no deals to be found.
* Briefcases in excess of $300 dollars.  I'm not going to live in the damn thing, I just want to lug some crap around.
* A food court with maybe 6 types of food choices and about the same number of seating available.  Ok, it was a large dining are but so packed that there wasn't seating available either indoors or out.
* More footwear stores than I ever knew existed.  Are Ugg's really a hot commodity in Vegas in May?
* A Levi's outlet store.  I like my Levi's but aren't denim jackets a bit much unless your herding cattle?
* A Guess outlet and a Guess by Marciano.  Well guess what....I don't know who Marciano is.

My observations withstanding, this mall is easy to get to and if you get there early, parking is quite easy to find inside the parking garage.  Later in the day it gets busy and parking seems to be a premium at either of the parking garages.

The layout is easy to navigate with a bank of stores on the perimeter along with a center building with additional stores so you're basically walking around a rectangle.

My first and second time there, I discovered that my beloved Burberry packable nylon tote was available in the exact color I'd been looking for back home.  At LeSportsac, the only place I trust for quality and durability in terms of makeup bags, I found several of them at ridiculously cheap prices.  At the Disney Store, I picked up a very cute Piglet stuffed animal and decided that waiting in a long line to buy it was worth my time.  At Ecko Unltd, I purchased a comfortable pair of black yoga pants for way less than $20.  At Lacoste, I found a comfortable polo shirt and a large cosmetic tote, the latter of which I ended up using quite often for the remainder of my trip. 

Weirdly enough, it's easier to remember what stores I shopped at in December 2010 than it is to recall my experience in April.  I think this is largely due to differences in stock (there was more available during the holiday season), the weather (December was cold, but April was super duper uncomfortable h-o-t), my mood (I think I was grouchy / tired on my last visit) and the simple fact that I was here twice in December, compared to only once in April.

Nevertheless, I did find quite a few things in April as well.  The most noteworthy purchases are my Ecko Red large women's jacket (hard to find back home) and my Vans all-black sneakers in women's size 5 (almost impossible to find anywhere).  These are items that I consider wardrobe staples, and I found myself using them the same day of purchase.

This particular review is for the former.  I think in comparison to each other, I prefer this one.  However, when it's the dead of summer and it's reaching 120 degrees outside, I'd prefer the indoor one.  But, in terms of shopping, I like the stores here.  They have a good Tommy Hilfiger store that always has good deals when I go there.  Also, the Nike outlet always seems to be stocked with stuff I could use and if it's on sale, stuff I could afford.  I also like the fact that there are like 2 or 3 different stores where I could buy cooking supplies.  That way, when the Mrs is looking at girly clothes, I have somewhere to go.

It seems lately like it's simply a place where these manufacturers can cut out the retailer's margins and sell direct to the public.  The prices really aren't weren't that good on my last visit (is it just me that noticed this?).  Maybe it was just because we were shopping the weekend after 4th of July weekend, but I found it was hard to find anything beyond 10 to 20% off in most stores.

We went to the non-outlet fashion show mall (ON THE STRIP) and were able to find many of the same products we were looking for for cheaper.

It can be a challenge to get here, though. I think they deliberately made parking difficult so you have time to truly work up your shopping appetite. Hint: Parking garage B always seems to be less crowded than parking garage A, and don't even bother with trying to valet (the valet has been ""full"" every time I've been here). 

If you are visiting Vegas and didn't rent a car, there is a direct bus here from the Strip. There is also a taxi stand for easy return to the Strip when loaded down with shopping bags.

It can be helpful to create a plan of attack before arriving. To me at least, this is not a place I like to just wander about and shop.

visit the locations here, there's a bargain waiting to be found!

4. Adequate food court with at least one healthy choice. Please note there are other eateries scattered around e.g. Chipotle, Starbucks and Dairy Queen.

They have added an additional wing to the mall now which has stores including John Varvatos, All Saints, G Star, and many others. The funny thing is so many of these shop workers have better-than-you attitude. Dude, you work at a mall--an outlet mall. Get over yourself.

First of all, they have a wide selection of stores...a little bit of everything for everyone...but they do have the usual favorite designer stores. 
My best advice to get the best deals is to go on holidays and weekends. Yes its busy but they have way better deals. If you go during the week, there are usually no special deals and it's not worth going there. The whole point of outlets is to get good deals. 
I usually stop here during Black Friday. Warning to all those that go this year...its freaking cold, parking is horrible, and there are LOTS of people. Despite this, I enjoy going every year because I get awesome deals. Some of the stores even form lines, like Coach, they only let a certain amount of people in at a time, so a huge line forms outside. This is common on black friday. 
So if you don't like the madness and the cold, stay out of here! we don't need grumpy people shopping around because you will need a lot of patience for shopping on this day.

Last time I went to the one at the other end of the strip I was really unimpressed and haven't returned since, so it's been a few years. 

While it IS ridiculously hot out during a majority of the year, there are small cooling stations scattered about. All of the bathrooms and stores are well air conditioned and there are vendors or machines dispensing drinks at frequent intervals. Still, I'd come around sunset due to personal preference as I'm a nocturnal lass and dislike excessive sun. No, I don't sparkle. ;}
 
I find this a fun place to come and window shop or people watch. It's also good exercise, doing laps around the large rectangle trying to find any cool stores I may have passed by first time around. There are a lot of fashionable foreign people, most likely drawn by the Armani Exchange and likewise stores dotted throughout. There are stores suited to a wide variety of budgets if you're willing to look around. Even the American Apparel store had some decent prices on things when I ambled through!

While I didn't eat in the food court this time, I remember it being uncomfortably hot and the food unpleasant.

I think i now understand women when they come back with bags and bags of clothes and say, ""But im saving so much money.""  To be honest I think I actually enjoy it;  So any place that can get me to enjoy shopping is 5 Stars all the way!

Some tips to save even more money is, create an account on the premium outlet website https://www.premiumoutlets.com/ and join the VIP club.  This will get you a voucher for a coupon book which you pick up at the Information center, this saved me another $35 last time.  You can also print out more coupons from the website that that are not offered in the coupon book.  If you have AAA (for your car) they can get you the voucher for the coupon book too.  the VIP club is good for all their outlet malls around the US as well, so sign up for each one you might visit.

Tips: Mall opens at 10, be there at 10 or no later than 11, when i leave at around 1 or 2 there is a crazy line out the parking lot of cars trying to get in and find parking!  Guess people get a late start cause they are up partying all night.

Not a fan of the flow of traffic in the structure-- it can be a mad house, dodging cars left and right if you come on a busy day.

Here are some of my favorite places:

1. J.Crew-- This outlet location is the ONLY J.Crew in Las Vegas. There is no full line store in this desert. The service here is pretty great. If you are a teacher or a student, you can show them your ID and get a discount (even on top of sale items). Great place to get your work clothes and accessories! I am madly in love with their jewelry and shoes. 

2. Disney Store-- This location has great service and wonderful Disneyland park items. I scored on some awesome end of the year gifts for my students. Those lucky kids! Spreading my love of Disney one class at a time. 

3. Marc Jacobs-- Opened not too long ago, however their customer service is hit or miss. If you're a fan of MJ like I am, this place will have your wallet empty in no time.

4. North Face-- I never had to own a real jacket until I moved to Vegas. Come here for your winter gear. 

5. LuLulemon-- Also, opened not too long ago. Worth the browse, even though I have yet to really find anything really great here yet.

6. American Apparel-- This location has great deals on hoodies and tees. There is a full line store in Summerlin and also in PH. If your dog is in need of a well made hoodie, come here! My dog enjoys their comfortable sweatshirts in the winter.

7. Kate Spade-- Always a sale going on; definitely worth checking out if you like KS and their cute designs. Watermelon clutch anyone? 

8. Nike-- Always worth a quick peek. They have new things in here all of the time. Worth it if you are looking for work out clothes or sneakers. (pro tip: right next to the parking structure entrance!)

I used to always make an afternoon at this outlet when I would come to vegas for a weekend getaway. Now as a local, I still find this outlet worth my time. Maybe even more so than the typical malls around the Vegas area (Sorry  Sunset Galleria). Keep in mind this is an outdoor shopping center, so this may not be the best place to go when there is a crazy wind storm or extreme heat. 

Happy shopping!",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,14,10,5,N5TUatMsuRFwOWGcIXw9cQ

I'm usually a target or Walmart shopper for my daughters clothes due to location an prices but after coming here that's changed.

Hello $$$. Get back into my wallet. So many good deals it's hard nt to go crazy. Last week I sped $25 for a pair of jeans for y two year old from target but went to osh kosh and bought a pair of jeans and overalls for $27. Deal! Or steal? ;)

Love all the stores here, Michael kors, coach, nike, sketchers, fossil (who by the way has an 11 yr warranty on their watches) Charlotte Russe, Disney store, etc etc.

Discounts among stores are hit and miss. My wife really liked DKNY which had as much as 70% off while other stores either had no sale or had something pitiful in comparison. Why would I go to a factory outlet to save 10% over MSRP? There were even some cases where some items were full-priced.

We went here on Thanksgiving day and this place was crowded.  It was pretty close to the hotel we stayed at.  The parking garage still had a lot of space left on the upper floors when we came around noon.  This was the first time I saw the parking garage with an indicator to let drivers know how many spots were opened and which spots were open indicated by the green or red light above each spot.

All of the stores were close together and separated by maybe a kiosk in between.  I looked at their website before coming here to know exactly which stores I wanted to check out.  After I walked through the whole outlet, I realized how small it was but had enough for most people's needs.  There was a food court which was pretty crowded considering it was Thanksgiving.  I remembered there were five different restaurants in the food court with Subway being one of them.

First of all I thought parking was going to be crazy, and it was, but I got lucky, found one as soon as I got there. So many stores, you just don't know where to start. FIRST OFF, don't park at the first parking structure...go to the one by Saks Fifth Avenue. I usually Valet, but they were full. Then go to the main office and get the map. I ALSO got the VIP passport for $10. Its full of great coupons, at first I got a little upset, because some stores didn't honor them, but then I understand, everything was at such great prices. But then a lot of them did, so I definitely got my money's worth. All the stores were well prepared. A lot of merchandise and great staff.Lines were going super fast. Got great savings....My favorite was UGG.I got 2 pairs. YOU NEVER FIND UGGS FOR SALE....anyway, highly recommend it if here in Vegas and don't want to blow all your money on gambling.

I've been to both.  If you're from or familiar with Southern California, to compare I'd say the NORTH is similar to Camarillo or Palm Desert.

The SOUTH is similar to Ontario Mills or The Citadel.

The NORTH is an outdoor shopping area, it has more stores as well as higher end (brand names) stores.  The SOUTH for the most part is an indoor mall, and has a mixture, 'tho if I had to summarize, has more working class type retail stores.

Parking is difficult at the NORTH, they have a parking structure that's covered.   Parking seemed easy over at the SOUTH.

The shopping clientele seems be comprised of more visiting tourists (and foreign ethnic)  at the NORTH and more locals (and urban ethnic) at the SOUTH. 

I like the NORTH Premium Outlets, as a male shopper for:

Dolce & Gabbana (D&G)
Tumi
Lacoste 
Ferragamo
Coach (for Men)
Marc Ecko
Kenneth Cole

It always seems to be crowded but yet there is room for everyone. We've never had a problem finding parking and we always are able to find the stores we want to go without too much hassle. It seems almost every store has cool deals. There are definitely good discounts compared to going to a mall. The discounts even sometimes get another percent off due to coupons the different places give away when you first enter. 

Oh and the great deals are not just in the big stores. There are also excellent deals to be found in the those boutique carts on the outside. I found some great crystal bracelets for a really good price in one of those carts! The only thing is it can be hard to browse to shop at those carts when you're under the hot sun, burning Vegas weather. Nonetheless there are deals to be found everywhere!

You will need a map, and even with that, you will get lost.  Every conceivable shop is here.  Not sure about the Outlet label since I really didn't see any real bargins here.

There were plenty of stores: shoes (such as Aldo, Nike, Crocs), clothing (Banana Republic, Columbia), accessories (Burberry, Kate Spade). This place seem to have it all.

I found a really cool Filipino shirt at Adidas, and I found an Iron Man watch at a watch outlet for $25 (though, I opted to get a $12 one that was just as good).  Dress shirts seemed to be pretty decent buys, and I found a pair of ""nice"" cuff links for about $20 (best before that was about $30).

HYDE: The number one reason I am not too crazy about going to this place and im sure that EVERYBODY that shops here will agree with me is that THE PARKING SUCKS! Every time I go here it takes forever to find a parking spot. When you do find one, it's usually between a huge SUV and a hooptie. Forget the fact that the stalls are small to begin with, the chances that you will have a ding or two on your car is higher than finding the lost city of Atlantis.

Also convenient restrooms were nowhere to be found.  You have to walk a ways to get to one.  Their food court was chaos.  There were way too many people just hanging out.

The one thing I like about the LVO is the fact that they have cheesecake factory and it's located at the end of the stores. Actually, the stores are located in an oval, so if you park in the parking structure, you will exit outlets the same way you came in.

This outlet is the higher end of the two. The other outlet has higher end shops as well, but not as many as this one. This outlet has shops like Kate Spade, Tahari, True Religion, J. Crew and Tory Burch. They do still have the more affordable and typical stores an outlet would have, like Levi's, Nike and Coach. When the weather is nicer in the springtime, it's awesome to just come out here and enjoy the warm weather while shopping. 

Cons: the parking is aweful!! This is a huge destination spot so you are fighting for parking with the tourists and the 2000+ employees. The parking garage isn't completed yet, so hopefully it'll get better. The heat during summer can be unbearable and this is when people go to the South outlets since they are indoors. Lastly, their food court is pretty lame. Nothing is appealing and there are only 5 or 6 options to choose from. Although there are little snacks spots around the outlet, like ice cream and pretzels.

I love this mall - worked here for 2 years, lived only 15 min away. This was my go-to mall even on a day off, I could always find whatever I needed.  Just be sure to get here early, the tourists are amped and ready to go BEFORE the mall even opens. Parking can be beyond awful so again, get there first thing in the AM or about 1-2 hours before closing (if you know you'll be quick, the stores do not stay open for late shoppers).  

I'm so happy to see the 3rd parking garage finally opening. It was in the works since day 1 of working there (3 years ago!). Holiday's are brutal, beware! I head to the top floor of garages, but note that it will take forever ... allow 45 minutes for parking at prime rush times.

The food court is so-so but I love the Asian restaurant NOT in the food court, they serve beer! Men will love that! Their lunch boxes are cheap-cheap-cheap and enough to share for 2.

Pick up a coupon booklet at the info center (where the cabs drop off/pick up) - they are usually $5 unless you have a military ID, AAA card, etc.  Totally worth it, 90% of the stores are in there.

How fucked is that?
Back then, people didn't use PC terms like 'Hydrocephalic', no, they used the more caustic, 'waterhead'.
Actually, as it turned out I wasn't a waterhead baby at all. I just had (have) a large cranial area. One that requires extra large sunglasses. And that brings us to Vegas.

Restrooms? Where? It's like trying to find a secret room.

Parking is pretty good here.  There's more than enough parking but the parking security are major douches.  They were controlling who gets which parking spot when a car pulls out and when they get it wrong they don't care and piss the hell out of you.

This outlet is so amazing!!! So many famous and high-end brands at half the cost!  Was super excited to get some new Tory Burch flats and the cutest side bag from Vince Camuto!

There isn't much shaded areas but the welcoming cooling AC entering the store makes you forget about the heat again! Much H2O needed when coming, so make sure you got yours! 

Big Tip: Wear comfy shoes and cool clothes!

3088450,2013-03-04,1,GHS1rVjO-RMcRB6WJLpCDQ,"I come here to see the people that I know since I used to work in 3 different stores here. But everything else, I don't really feel safe about this mall no matter how much security and cops they put on patrol here.

Robberies and shoplifting is frequent. And I have seen the stall vendors get into altercations with random kids, you know, wannabe gangbangers that wanna earn their stripes.

I have also seen taxi drivers fight over parking spots, and a incident between a bus driver and a cab driver because the cabbie is parked on bus property that was meant to unload passengers. 

The people that go to this mall are the most inconsiderate drivers ever. They would rather hold up traffic in a parking garage stretching 20 cars, just so they can take a spot on the lower levels instead of just driving all the way to the top. Fights break out in the garages too.

Most of these problems are caused by LOCALS, not the tourists. The locals that come here start the drama, and the tourists either are driven away by it or see it as mild entertainment.

For those that are complaining about the ""deceptive pricing"", I will tell you this... Prices for outlet goods are decided by the BRAND, not the mall! For example, Coach Factory Outlet bags are considerably cheaper than their full price counterparts. However, Michael Kors Outlet often have similar price tags to their full price cousins, although the silhouettes are actually completely different. That means that depending on the brand, you can either get a actual discount  from a ""transfer"" item, or... You could actually be buying a entirely different product from the same company.

For each brand there are often at least three categories, Full Price (Boutiques), Outlet, and Department Store (Nordstroms, Neiman Marcus, Macy's). Boutiques are pretty obvious. But for Outlets, which could be a entirely different part of the company, they MAY get transfers from full price stores, which will get marked down. Otherwise Outlets will have their own collection to sell.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,14,0,2,RlN3Jyxn044KWZy0hi4ReQ

Who says there's nothing to do but gamble in Vegas? I personally hate shopping maybe it's a guy thing, but I hate looking at the same crap that's  never on sale. This outlet is great for men! I'm not into men if that's what you were thinking (that's what he said). Let me explain. Most malls are composed of 95% womens products. This is no joke! And the 5% of stores that are not women's I am counting the food court and gift shops that don't even sell clothing. I admit malls are great for guys to go window shopping for eye candy (go on ladies do your thang), but if you want some decent clothes there is no mens clothing! This outlet actually has stores that men will  shop at! Also, unisex clothing stores have a men's section and not just on rack hidden in the back of a women's store. There's nothing more embarrassing than wondering if something is your size and it turns out to be womens clothing. That's a nightmare for a straight guy. 

Van Heusen, Nike, Reebok, Adidas, Nautica, Calvin Klein, Keith Cole, TIMBERLAND!! One of the last Timberland stores open. Other outlets will only have a few big names and no section, but the premium outlets have what you are looking for. There's too much good stuff! Usually, I only get halfway through the outlet because I have bought too much stuff before I make it all the way through. 

If you are going to shop for reals, the Las Vegas Premium Outlets is for you. If you just want to look around, still go... but you should buy something because the prices are awesome. This is a must stop everytime you go to Las Vegas. The only bad thing is you may freeze your ass off in the winter and you will melt like a ice cream in the summertime, because this is an outdoor mall. I still don't get what the designers of this mall were thinking! Outdoor mall in Vegas?

This outlet has most of the common outlet shops like coach, Nike, bcbg, nine west, DC shoes, converse, etc. Yeah so I skipped all those.  In the one hour that I had, I spent 45 mins at the l'occitane store and 15 mins at the Diesel store.  Wise choice.  I got the best deal ever at l'occitane!!! If you went to their regular store before, you would know that their stuff ain't cheap.  A shower gel normally costs $30, a 1 Oz.  Eye cream can be up to $100... A 0.5 oz hand cream costs more than $10. But guess what,  I bought a travel pack that normally costs $55 for only $32 which includes a shea butter soap, a lavender soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower cream, hand cream and foot cream all fit into a l'occitane clear plastic pouch nicely wrapped and placed in a beautiful and colorful l'occitane gift box! I couldn't wait to use everything when I got home. I bought 2 of these gift sets and a facial cooling mist for $9.60. I got a 10% off discount that day too of my entire purchase so my total came to $66. They gave out a free shower gel of $30 value to customers who shopped for $65 or more. So, my total bill was only $71 and I was taking home two gift sets, a cooling mist for face and a big bottle of rose shower gel. I looked at my shopping bag. I could not believe what I just bought. My friend later came to check out what I got after we went our separate ways. She spent 1 minute in the store getting the exact same stuff I got because that was the best deal I've found after spending 45 mins there! The staff were helpful and did recommend a lot of things, but I really didn't care for the shower products. There are not many l'occitane outlets in the U.S. If you are in Vegas and if you like this brand, this is the shop you must visit.

Another store. Diesel. I like a lot of stuff from Diesel. It's not your common American store because Diesel is indeed an Italian brand so it's not surprising that the outlet is not easily found in every outlet. Of course I was going to check it out! I was a bit disappointed that their women section fell short. If you're a guy, this is certainly a good place to do some shopping for stylish clothing. They have men's t-shirts for only $18, reduced from the original $55 markup, can you believe that!? I saw a bunch of Italian tourists in this store, duh...

The outlet has a lot of stores to choose from. It's big. Plan ahead and wear comfortable shoes! Shame on you if you walk out this outlet with anything that is full-priced!

Oh, they have maps, but that doesn't help me. I'm hopeless. /After my umpteenth time here, the novelty wore off.  Anyway, they offer a AAA coupon booklet, so if you happen to have AAA, you might want to get the booklet, which is located at the information office. Don't know where that is?  Just ask a tourist, they'll be able to help  you.  

Obviously, parking here blows, especially during the weekend.  But if you come on a weekday, it still stinks, but not as much. You'll actually be able to find parking, provided that you get there early, that is. Or, you can be one of those annoying people who block traffic while waiting for a parking spot to open.

The food court is decent, with a few food options.  The Starbucks, though, is always packed.  It seems that tourists think Starbucks is synonymous with America, or something.  There are a lot of stores to browse if time is not  your enemy.  Personally, I like going into Gap, Banana Republic, Van Heusen, J. Crew, Quiksilver, Adidas Store, Skechers, Nine West, Bass, L'Occitaine, and Crabtree and Evelyn.  I am usually able to find something in these stores. As a tactic to get you to go into their store, there are always sales going on, although from my experience, the sales aren't really sales.  Plus, I'm not in the mood to fight others for the sales merchandise.  

So, in summary, this outlet is a good stop if you're taking a break from losing money, er, I mean gambling. If you're going to give your money away, you might as well get something in return for it.  Just make sure that you get here early if you want to find a parking spot. Happy bargain hunting!",TmKW9WZyvRXv7v9e9GORPg,0,0,3,PFFqoJo3NB0g0LT-gskp8w

There's similar brands on both locations, but this has a couple more high end brands that suit my tastes more, for example Kate Spade.

Let me just say, the Las Vegas Premium Outlets center is by far, the best one I've been to as far as actual ""shoppability"". Unlike The Las Vegas Outlet Center on LV Blvd. that has outdated and generic stores in its directory. 

I used to live in Hawaii for a few years, so, the fact that this shopping center is an ""outdoor"" shopping center, it adds to my overall satisfaction with this place. 

My favorite stops here are:
Gap, Banana Republic, French Connection, Puma, Levis and American Apparel!
A few mentionables: Nike, Kenneth Cole, Robert Wayne, Quiksilver, Volcom, Pac Sun, White House | Black Market, Lacoste, Calvin Klein,  Armani Exchange, Charlotte Russe, and some others that have slipped my mind at this moment.

I worked at one of the women's retail shops here for a 1.5 years and have to say that I've met some awesome out-of-towners! But, I do have a few complaints in the time I was working there:
1) NO BURGER JOINT in the food court.! Out of all the things to eat, sometimes I just wanted a simple burger... -sigh-
2) HORRIBLE time finding parking even with TWO multi-level parking garages/lack of employee parking only spots.
3) The ""local"" shop-lifters/less-than-friendly patrons.

Besides that, I've been to this shopping center 2 times for the ""Black Friday"" Sales, and have never walked out with a thing, but still was satisfied with my window-shopping. On most other random shopping days, I walk out of the center with at least 3 tops! score..

Definitely would recommend going on a weekday, early! When the shopping center is about to open to avoid the crowded walking spaces, and parking garage hell-hole.",voYIq2C9eAAeoQZaSyYQ8Q,0,0,4,tQDM0SbfLlljaaBYgm-xwg

3459509,2010-08-09,1,GHS1rVjO-RMcRB6WJLpCDQ,"Outlet malls are one of my favorite things in the world. 

Before I elaborate, I have a caveat. I actually dislike the crowds, food courts, unnecessary discount stores (charlotte ruse, rue 21...these stores are already cheap in regular malls and there is absolutely no reason they should have an outlet store) and the general reminder of the materialism/hedonism in society. 

Other than the above, outlet malls are one of my favorite things in the world. Not only do they provide many reasonable purchase options, they are also an amazing workout tool. Walking around multiple times in the outlet mall perusing selections (esp in the sauna like heat in Vegas) will guarantee a loss of at least a pound. 

The Las Vegas Premium Outlets are just a class above the rest. The area is neat and well organized. There is plenty of parking (note to locals: avoid holidays and weekends as it gets crazy there) and the most important thing of all: the stores that are featured in this mall are out of this world. 

I personally love the Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Banana Republic, JCrew, Ralph Lauren, L'Ocittane, Gap, Calvin Klein and Company Outlet (makeup) stores. I cannot tell you the number of deals I have scored here. I am currently using a Kate Spade beautiful canvas beg with brown piping for my laptop that has a red and gold polka dotted inner lining...CUTE! And guess what...all this fanciness for under 50 bucks. My entire cardigan collection has been procured from JCrew (the Jackie O collection) and it was at a very attractive price of $19.50 each. There are so many things in my closet and home that I thank this outlet mall for. 

The LV Premium Outlets have also never disappointed any family/friend that has come into town to visit. My New York living yuppie girlfriends swear by the Theory outlet store here and my mom and aunts have spent hours in the Coach store. Even my dad (who buys like one thing every 5 years) did some damage at the Dockers store. If you are spending any time in Vegas, be sure to spend an afternoon at this mall. It's a great way to spend an afternoon walking around, having fun and procuring some cute items at great deals!

However in our attempt to go to Fremont Street to get a Fried Twinkie we ran into a HORRENDOUS traffic jam and street closures.

Every Free Parking structure had a sign that parking was $20.  We knew something was going on as the Police presence was ENORMOUS.  However we were clueless as to what.
It took us forever to get out of the area and our GPS was not helpful as it dumped us right into the traffic going to this mall.  Lots of folks going to the event on Fremont Street (which turned out to be something called Life is Beautiful- it sure was not BEAUTIFUL STUCK IN TRAFFIC)
decided $20 was too rich for them and had infiltrated parking at this mall.  A LOT of Cabbies were also dropping people off.  It took us FORTY FIVE MINUTES to get to the parking structure to park.  We were lucky and got a spot on the first floor.  

Now onto the review of the mall. 

It does not even begin to measure up to the South location.  It does not have the stores or the selection. It seemed to attract a differen kind of clientele. many of the stores blared music that was so obnoxious it  deterred us from going in orvstaying in the store.

However, since they have redone the outlets down on the south end of Las Vegas Boulevard and made them into Las Vegas Premium Outlets North the original location has really lost its edge. The store selection here is now only SLIGHTLY better instead of being way better. And the southern location while crowded is not as mobbed as the original. This place has great hours; especially a plus is that it is open late on Sunday (after 6 PM). Considering this is 2014 and the era of internet shopping and a 24-7 town, they often get my business when I need to shop on a Sunday and the malls close early in Vegas. This mall is great for people watching as well! However, this mall is also the 'United Nations' of Las Vegas because it is so overrun with foreign tourists, many whom are rude or stupid and roll suitcases around and shove clothes in them. I guess this is why they sell heavy coats and fleece in many of the stores here considering you will only wear those on a handful of instances during a winter day in Las Vegas and maybe 30 times at night a winter. The only negative about the location is it is not in walking distance to any tourist areas (maybe downtown if you really want to walk) and for locals near the Spaghetti Bowl which is a major mess most of the time due to traffic.

But if I were to give more detail.. well let's just say I expected much more. First Siri usually takes me the highway route (she usually LOVES highways) but she ended up taking me through the shady part of town which is down the street from this outlet. The location is not great & the crowd there reflects that a lot. It was busy but not so busy that I should have worried about personal space. I got unnecessarily pushed around a lot by people high on consumerism. Lot's of shopping crazy tourists rolling their suitcases around .... to fill them up with crap I'm sure & some locals with zero manners. Literally just people grabbing things from right in front of me instead of saying excuse me & bumping into me just to look at merchandise. Yuck. 

To me the stores basically reflect your ordinary mini mall with the exception of a couple of high end stores like Dolce & Gabbana, Marc Jacobs, Burberry, & Tory Burch. It was weird to see those stores surrounded by your average mall stores like PacSun & Hot Topic. I don't really see why they didn't just make this into a mall because although it was outdoors there was nothing giving off a classier then mall vibe such as grass, flowers, a nice outdoor sitting area, etc. Most outlets have something like that to separate it from the mall experience. I don't like malls but I'd rather go to Galleria or Fashion Show (neither of which I particularly care about but can at least deal with on occasion) then come here. 

I'm not a huge fan of shopping in general but I came looking for a pair of cute new flats & found nothing that interested me. A lot of cheap crap & a lot of rejected high end items they sell for full price using big names here. Don't care about the stores nor do I care for the environment.

I'd rather drop here than at the casinos.  I have a fat wallet for Las Vegas Premium Outlets.   I had ideas on what to get the future wifey for her upcoming birthday.   Definitely Burberry.... Kate Spade.... some bling .... and added extras to go with the ring!

All of the Pros/Cons from my prior review still hold true.  The only thing I can add is to the CONS....this mall has a ton of those annoying kiosks that sell perfume, jewelry cleaning, and other stuff....what makes it annoying are the sales people who make cat calls at you as you walk by....it feels like I'm at a Middle Eastern ""souk"".  I just act like I can't speak English and walk right by them.

Besides that one annoying item, it's still a solid place to do some shopping.  There are some great stores here and I'm surprised they didn't leave during the economic downturn.

I would NOT taxi there if you can avoid it, the line for a taxi at the end wrapped around and very far back. It was way longer than any of the lines to get inside the popular stores!

I have been going to Vegas for awhile and I'm surprised I haven't been here before now! It is about 10 min north of the strip. Of course the traffic getting into the parking structure and finding a spot took awhile but my dad dropped us off to get started while he took care of that :)

We headed to the food court first to fuel up for the busy day instead. There is a Chinese place, Subway, pizza/spaghetti, philly cheese steak, and a salad place. There is outdoor and indoor seating. It was packed as hell, but the Chinese food wasn't half bad! The outlet itself looks rather small from the outside, but once inside, there are actually a bunch of stores! The directory was super helpful because there are so many twists and turns. A part of it is also still under construction...

Worthy mentions: Banana Republic, J Crew, Kate Spade, Ann Taylor. I get a lot of business clothes for work, if you can tell. They had 50% off everywhere! The Kate Spade long was prob the longest but they had 50% off everything PLUS an additional 20%!! They even give a handy price list so you know exactly the sales total including tax. Other long lines were for Michael Kors and Tory Burch.

So wrong, deals in Vegas are long gone...  Anywhere you have to pay for the privilege of a lounge chair at the pool no longer is a cheap place to visit,  I digress..  
The parking was tough even that early.  Clearly we were there at opening and the staff working the stores have taken all the 1st floor parking in the garage.  Pretty stupid guest service.   Then you hike from the garage to the shops.  If you can get lucky and find a parking spot on level 2 you can take the bridge and escalator and drop in by Nike.
The only real deals we saw were at Kate Spade.  After that we could beat every price and home or at regular retail..

- Too many people!  Store distances across from each other was approximately 15 - 20 ft. so when there's lots of traffic it's hard to get thru at times...

Tip:  Best shopping days are 1-2 weeks before black friday, and also during the month of December running thru the 1st week of January.

Their visit did help numb the emotional pain that I was having, and shopping here at the outlets made me begin the healing process. With all of the love and support from beautiful friends. 

Having many shopping experiences here in the past this particular trip I seemed to really connect with the sights and sounds surrounding me. Maybe because this is the first visit here in my lonely new life. Through the vastness of my new world I have discovered many wonderful things that I had no prior knowledge of here at the outlets. There is a Shake Shack located here currently across from the customer service area. Now individuals can enjoy fantastic burger and shakes while doing the most all American sport ever. Shopping!

The selection of stores is not the typical outlet type stores. Here most of the stores are a higher quality and standard of goods. Such as St. John, Burberry, and Vince to make a few of my favorite choices. It is an outdoor mall with lots of walking and people watching opportunities. The parking area is covered and highly secure. Plus parking is free here too, unless one feels the opportunity to pay for closing parking.

And most recently, North Face had some bargains that I just couldn't pass up.  The restaurant options at this outlet is better than the south outlet.

Be prepared to wait and wait (and wait) to (maybe) score a parking spot in the garage! Although the garage has been recently expanded, parking is still a pain in the butt! Don't even THINK about attempting to shop here on a busy weekend or on days with super nice weather. 

It's a shame about the parking because this is a really nice mall. There are some mid-range designer shops and lots of fun places to browse. I'm not sure the prices are truly ""outlet"" prices, so know the retail cost before you go. There also aren't a lot of options for dining or drinks / snacks, so you can't really plan to spend an entire day. The Starbucks location here is always packed with no seating and lines out the door. 

Note that this is an outdoor shopping mall so if it's a super hot day or if there's bad weather, there is no shelter from it. I repeat -- avoid this place on super hot or rainy days! I've also noticed that there have been more sketchy people hanging out here. If you are a group of girls, get ready to face catcalls and more from male shoppers. Last Saturday there were a ton of security guards around. I don't know what that was about but it didn't stop the catcalls. 

I still prefer the Premium Outlets South since they have more ""down to Earth"" shops that normal people can shop in everyday. They also have a much nicer Disney Store Outlet there and parking is never a problem.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,1,0,2,PbItqhE8Ov-u4DX4hRSWTA

Maybe it was the time of year, maybe I'll try again but despite the amazing number of shops nothing was actually a deal. Everything appeared to be normal price and the selection at every store was seriously lacking. The same stores at the Seattle Outlets yield a lot more selection. And as far as price, I did end up buying one dress, and after the exchange rate (didn't have to pay duty though) I saved a grand total of $4 from buying it at home. 

The cool thing was the mist spraying trees in the concourse to keep you from melting, I really appreciated those. Also, if you're taking the bus, you might want to rethink it.

As of today (03/27/18), the North Outlet charges non Nevada residents a $5 parking fee. With a Nevada ID, the fee is waived.  This is the only reason why I didn't give it a five star and this reason alone will not stop me from shopping here because the savings alone in all the merchandise you will purchase here will exceed the parking fee.

I went to Starbucks to grab a nice cool drink.  Went to LeSportSac to get a good deal on a versatile & functional backpack.  I even stopped to grab some make-up at Bare Minerals.

When I arrived in Las Vegas I admit that the selection of stores at the outlet amazed me, but still, why pay brand name (outlet) prices if it was not worth it? 

Fast forward to a couple of months ago, when I came back after a two year hiatus. I only went to a couple of stores, Banana Republic and the like, and I was amazed! AMAZED! I could not tell the difference between the store and the outlet items. Holy crap! After that visit I was sold, and now I don't see a reason why people go to the mall. 

I agree that parking is a nightmare, so I suggest you get there a little before the stores open to get a good spot.

We've come so often that some sales people here know us, at several stores. We do some of our Christmas shopping here. There are so many places to shop- Coach, Dooney & Bourke, LeSportSac, Harry & David, Adidas, Quiksilver, Banana Republic, Gap, Oakley, Clark's, Ann Taylor, and Disney, just to name a few. This is a way better center than the Las Vegas Outlet Center (formerly Belz). (Tip: Additional 10% discount to AAA members at Banana Republic & The Gap when you show your card at checkout. Senior Discount on Tuesdays- 10% off. If you join the website, you will receive insider sales & additional coupons.) So many options, so many ways to save money, such a great place to go shopping! Pretty much something for everyone. Ok, sometimes we just like to walk around and window shop- so we don't always buy something- just wanted to clarify. Definitely, good people watching. 

The Welcome Center offers discount booklets for free to AAA members; just show your card with your ID. This is where Gift Cards are purchased (center wide). The Food Court is ok. A plus- outdoor seating that is semi-covered. Many snacking options like Starbucks, Auntie Anne's Pretzels, and Godiva. Vending machines in the beginning and near Adidas. Makino's is not as good here, compared to the Decatur/Flamingo location. Five bathroom options throughout the center. Security presence seems to be more visible; maybe because there are a lot of tourists here. There are two parking lots here but seems to get crowded the worst around the Holidays, so get there really early (or you could be waiting in line to park for almost an hour- yeah that really happened to us, last year). Midnight Madness, a Thanksgiving tradition, seems to be a big hit with shoppers and retailers alike. (Note: Ultra Diamonds seems to have slightly different hours than the rest of the mall.) Yes, might not be so sun-safe during Summer months especially July & August- at least the misters are on! Either avoid it during peak UVA/UVB hours or wear lots of sunblock and a hat. If you are prone to overheating, avoid it in the summer time. 

Needs a recycling station for out of town shoppers who like to toss their shoeboxes into the already overstuffed trash cans. I've heard that stores refuse to keep the shoeboxes. Donate your shoes to Timberland and get 10% off your purchase. Donate your shoes to Nike- which is recycled into material for children's parks.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,1,5,2U8ORw3xXVz456PS5jJidg

Then she gets a black bowl and before you know it she is washing your hands. In the black bowl she shows you the oil that comes off your hands and arms. Then she will tell you to buy the sea salt.

Went to Banana Republic, Puma, Nike, WhiteIBlack, A/X, Ferragamo and made quick purchases. I think I did pretty well and didn't break the bank too much.

There is something about it that makes us always forget get that while they do have factory outlet stores of a lot of cool stores, this place is a dump! 

The food court alone is enough to make me gag but, with all of the carts in the middle trying to hound you, you have no choice but to quickly turn into a store to get away from them, then while shopping in that store you realized, that everything is 30% off of a 50% markup, and then they slap the word ""outlet"" and then stand back and collect money. 

I realized this trip that everything they have there you can either find online, or at the same price as the regular stores, it's only worth going if there is a store there that you don't have where you live, but then you have to figure out if it's worth the $20 each way cab ride.",4I_woZLXCO9jaVZvDi18CA,1,2,2,5U9l_05lxOSkPimNywCJGw

They have a variety of stores including high end brands such as Burberry, Theory, Helmut Lang, Carolina Herrera, and Salvatore Ferragamo. They have the best selection and prices as well. Make sure to give yourself at least 3-4 hours to shop around. 

The only negative is that it gets really hot in the summer and walking around outside can be difficult. But most of the stores blast the AC!

Parking can be a hassle, but there are two garages, so pick your poison between garages. Be forewarned: it is outdoors, so summer months could have you sweating between stores. 

A lot of tourists. TONS of tourists. It is not a ""local"" place by any means.

Still, gotta love cheap shopping. The structural layout is actually pretty decent and the signage is helpful. There's an eatery and a Starbucks that is always busy.

Once upon a time I grew up in a fashion deprived city. The nearest shops were hours away. I've never been much of an on-line shopper, so I had to know where all the nearest shops I liked were (Cure? LV Premium Outlets).

Shops here that I love: 
- J. Crew 
- French Connection (R.I.P. It's dead now but had been on my list of favorites for years)
- Kate Spade (another bag please!)
- Banana Republic 
- GAP (even though the factory stores tend to resemble Old Navy at times, what do you expect for factory prices?) 
-Ed Hardy (hahahahahahahah j/k!!!!)

I like the outdoor shop locations, but be warned, it can be bloody hot in summer (they have mist machines, but when its 100+ degrees out it evaporates immediately) . 

The food court is small (only 5? eateries) and during busy summer months seating can be hard to find. Outside is an ice cream shop and Godiva, so if Chinese Orange chicken or 1,000 calorie pizza slices don't appeal you can eat chocolate. 

They keep the facilities clean & they have covered parking (makes all the difference in that kind of heat -hot leather seats & short skirts don't mesh well). They also have valet and the area stays pretty clean.  Go there. Today. This weekend. Tomorrow. Just GO. Anyone up for a road trip???",WeRl64AjlaEPGANfGpSEVw,0,0,4,-_eWmhi5RoXD-9hGi76_LQ

The great thing about this place is there is a parking garage so you don't have to park in the vast field of black-top asphalt.  The one thing about this outlet that stands out to me is the misting fans they use to cool people off.  The heat didn't bother me at all and it was 108 degrees and I was actually feeling cool.  The one is Florida doesn't have the misting fans and it could be 90 degrees outside and it could be unbearable!!!  Maybe the difference is in the humidity.

The Coach store offers the 30% off coupons at all their outlet locations.  The Vegas and Orlando locations are the biggest I have ever seen.  The selections are great and I love how you got to fight all the Chinese or Korean people buying the purses, so they can take it home to go make knock-offs to sell for just as high of a price.  Honestly, how many men do you see buying 30-40 bags??  I doubt they are cross dressers or they are buying it for their wife or girlfriend.  LOL",MEa1LSKvSjs8-wZdEpa0hA,0,0,3,WTOk7PKBGqPjYcGW6Deo0w

If you don't like a store, no matter how much you convince yourself to like it because it's so much cheaper, it's not going to happen.

Each time I come here, I really only go for two stores.  The Coach Outlet and the Guess Outlet.  The Coach Outlet always has a really good selection, including a lot of things from Coach Retail.

They have plenty of stores ranging for MK to Pacsun to Charlotte Russe and everything in between. I was able to find some good deals at GAP and O'Nelil but unfortunately my gf couldn't find anything :(

The ratio of higher end/designer stores to your typical chain dept. store was like 10 to 3 so if you're more into that fancy stuff, then this place has many options. There were plenty of good deals going on when we went as well.

I wear a lot of boring clothes for work. That is, a lot of plain button-up shorts and pants and stuff. This place allows me to get all my good business casual work clothes for a deal.

There are cons here, though. Parking is nuts. I hate it. It's probably better to park at the Clark County building across the way than it is to park in their lot.

Also, because I usually come here during the holidays (non-Christmas ones), I ALWAYS find great deals.  I recently came here during the Thanksgiving weekend, and got a lot of stuff for 1/3 of the listed prices (go mommy, it's yo berfday...).  And because this is a Premium Outlet, you can print out additional coupons as well as get a voucher for a VIP coupon book (claim at information center near Adidas) via the VIP Club.  You can also use your AAA card if you have one to get the VIP coupon book.  Otherwise, you'd have to fork out $5 for one (and people do pay for them, believe it or not).

They have great stores with awesome discounts from Calvin Klein to Kate Spade and Banana Republic. Watch out for the HUGE foreign tourist traps like Burberry, Coach, Kate Spade, STARBUCKS (HAHA), and Nautica, just to name a few...

It is definitely worth your while if you want to get some retail therapy done. It offers a great array of shops in a well laid out manner and rather easy parking options that make it a good spot to shop!

The center features a plethora of clothing retailers for men, women, and children. From Banana Republic to PacSun, Ed Hardy to Gap, they have them all. They also feature a good selection of accessories, kitchen, and bag shops. You can certainly pick up some new things for you, some gifts for friends, and the bag to pack all of it in. Note, it is an open-air complex so be prepared on those hot summer days!

The parking lot is generally full when I've gone, but if you drive around for a bit, a stall is bound to open up. If not, check out the structure since there seems to be better chances to park there, plus you car will be out of the blazing sun! Be sure to hide your valuables since tourists do frequent this spot and I'd imagine could be an easy target for questionable individuals. 

Food options are rather limited with the food court fare or Makino Chaya, which actually is pretty decent if you are willing to spring the wallet strings a little. So plan accordingly...

After getting off the bus we headed in and then turned right.  The first store we went to was Under Armour and we spent a lot of time there shopping for shoes and clothes for ourselves and others.  They had a great sale and the line up to pay wasn't too long which was great.  Next we headed into The North Face and it was busier to shop and pay, but glad for no line ups outside of the store.  Walking around the outlet, there was ample seating available and ability to walk around at a reasonable pace.

Although a handful of stores were closed and Kate Spade and Michael Kors had line ups that we didn't bother joining, we checked out a number of stores that had great deals.

It is very entertaining and makes me not only hopeful when entering but so disappointed when leaving. 

I never know where to start but do know that I usually have a moment of panic when walking by the Coach store to see hundreds of ladies going crazy for the big 'C'. I am always curious to see what I may find but only make it to the first table maybe the second then turn and run out. Then I try the shoe stores that never quite work out but I have yet to give up on em. I tend to stay away from stores I have in my area but I had a few gift cards to burn and found some steals at Banana Republic.

I try to avoid Armani Exchange cause they like to blow your ear drum with the unsk-unsky music that makes you waste hours in there checking out insanely vibrant clothes that are priced so low you have to look through EVERYTHING while tapping along with the beat. Found a lot I would have purchased but couldn't quite handle the chaos. I am a bad woman I know. My girlfriend found a great dress for cheap as did her sister. I think it was that store that made me wish there were good outlets by me. I could see it being a pit stop for a girl in need of hottness.

Moving along we skipped the Puma store and a few other shops to be on our way. We were able to hit Lacoste and I always look forward to Lacoste as it NEVER has anything for me :) The boys like going there for the cheap polos but I never find anything for myself. I was just doing a quick walk through when I ran across a one day only Easter sale rack. It had a ton of tennis skirts, t-shirts, and sweats- FOR $20! I confirmed the price of the goods I wanted, tried them on and walked out with a sweater and tennis skirt for $40 and some change! It was a one day sale and saves my self over $200. Crazy.

Food court is decent. Great place to start the day and firm up the plan of attack with your shopping posse. Across from it is what I think is called the Fudgery and they were so charming helping me stay within my dietary needs after a day of shopping.

The north has more variety of stores and more higher class store names compared to the south. Also they have covered parking garage and I believe the north is bigger. I'm not 100% sure but from my experience with both I just felt like I walked more on the north side.

Banana Republic always has some great sales going. In February, they had a suit sale. What normally would have been $350, sold for $135. I bought two fitted suits for almost the same price as one.

OUTLET SHOPPING in Vegas!

You can't go wrong with shopping after Christmas with loads of clearance items on sale and many other deals to be had! My Mom's friend suggested to shop at the North Premium Outlets because they believed they had great deals. 

High end designers all around like Michael Kors, Godiva, Burburry, La Coste, Hugo Boss, Polo Ralph Lauren, True Religion and countless others that are located around the outlet. Parking in the garage wasn't a problem even though it was so packed with a long line of cars ready to park. Some stores like Tory Burch and Coach had long lines out he doors with waits as long as up to 2 hours.

Unfortunately we had to shop. No, really, it was an emergency.  Brother's wedding reception that night. 

And that morning we discover in a moment of heart-stopping horror that we left my boyfriend's suit and all his fancy clothes in a garment bag. Hanging in a closet in a motel at the opposite end of Nevada. 

So. We hit the outlets hard and walked away with a passable sport coat, shirt, etc. 

Here's some tricks we used to survive:

- Follow the taxis. The street lay-out is a maze, the signage non-existent, you'll get lost on your own. Follow the guys who know where they're going.

- Skip the parking lot. Use the valet service.

- Time to leave? Give the valet dude a big-ass tip, and he'll get your car fast. Time = money.  You either pay with money or you pay with time. Your choice.

- Bring your own water bottle. The fountains don't work and the prices are crazy.

In fact, we checked online for many of the products and found cheaper prices at the company's retail online store.

This outlet has a great selection of stores, such as Nike factory, Express, Bose, Coach, Coach MEN, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Adidas, Gap, Banana Republic, Mark Ecko, Dolce & Gabbana, Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Ann Taylor, and much more. 

Parking sucks, so I would suggest going with a cab or UBER (now that they are LEGAL). My cousins drove us there and left us, so we decided to use uber ($13-18 ride). According to my friend Janice C., the cab ride from Mandalay Bay hotel is $20.

When I was there in early March, I have to say I was super disappointed. Not a lot of sales and not a lot of good selection.

I think  Woodbury Common Outlet in New York and Seattle Premium Outlets are my favourite in terms of sales and selection. I mean they all have similar stores but I didn't find much at the Vegas North Outlet. Some of the stores I did like were: White House Black Market (small store though), Banana Republic, Gap, Nike (no real sales, felt like a regular store), Carters, Coach etc.

Cabbing it here from the Palazzo hotel was $16 each way. You can also take the bus but make sure you take the Express and not the Deuce, as the latter one will take much longer since it stops way  more often.

You'll find pretty much all the high end designers here, as well as mid-range places too. All of the stores have great selection and carry a variety of sizes (not just XL and XXL!).

5713158,2015-08-09,3,GHS1rVjO-RMcRB6WJLpCDQ,"This place is nothing more than a shopping trap for those looking for good outlet deals. It seems like it is made primarily for tourists coming in on busses. Waves of people walk around and crowd up stores, bathrooms, and the small amount of eateries here. A lot of them buy big rolling luggages and lug them around the outlet. 

Anyways, let me start from the beginning,

Parking - We almost didn't even come here after driving around for 30 minutes looking for parking and finding nothing. The parking garage is horrible despite telling you how many spots are available. We came at the wrong time (130pm on a Saturday) and there were ""0"" spots available on all floors except the roof where the electric sign read ""300+"" spots free. Awesome, except when we got to the roof, there were no spots there either. Absolute useless sign. In fact some cars even parked where you're not supposed to park. Cars were circling everywhere and these people can't drive. You end up giving each floor a second chance and finding no difference. One person even reserved a parking spot by standing in the spot where a car is supposed to be. I guess their car was like 6 cars behind a trail of angry drivers passing up an otherwise available spot. We gave up and were already driving out when unfortunately we found someone was leaving so we pulled right in. Taking the bridge across to the outlet was non eventful. 

Outlet - you will want to take a quick glance over the directory. Not for the stores (let's face it, you're gonna walk all the way around anyways and hit em  all up) but for the food court and bathrooms. If you walk around in the middle of the day, there is no shade. Small shade sails might block 1% of the sun. Be prepared to bake from store to store. There are air mister fans than attempt to blow cool mist onto you as you pass beneath, but it's so damn hot it evaporates before it reaches you. 

Stores - you will soon find out that:

1) most of the stores are regular stores. Maybe 1 out of 20 stores are actually considered outlet stores. Basically they're just fillers to accept your money or the money of tourists willing to waste their money on regular items. 

2) no deals here unless you buy more than you want. Almost every store will say ""buy one, get another for xx% off"". you want a deal on crocs? Expect to buy three pairs just for the discount. Or get a discount on oakleys if you first pay full price for the first pair. There are far better discounts online on their company sites and you don't need to buy more than you need. 

3) there's not too many food stores. It's very weak compared to their sister outlet ""las Vegas south premium outlets"" which I recommend over this place. They are indoors, have two food courts, and less touristy. 

I think I could go on and on with this ridiculous place, but I'll stop here. I don't know why people would even like this place enough to recommend it. They obviously have never been to a real outlet. Definitely skip this place at all cost.",2GBN57e-1vtKzSUHY1Cejg,2,0,1,yQiNCVhoX3cdTiUHqD7X4g

There were lines for Tory Burch and Michael Kors, but we only waited about 7-10 minutes. I found really good deals and used the ""I'm on vacation"" logic and bought what I pleased hahaha! Well, until we got to Kate Spade and I was reminded that we needed to bring all this back home..

They have alot of other stores like Guess, Marciano by Guess, Aldo, Sketchers, Coach, and so much more. They also have a food court and Starbucks.

Von der Auswahl und Anzahl der Läden hörte sich das Outlet in der Downtown von Las Vegas interessanter an. Es war auch nur knapp 3 Kilometer von unserem Hotel entfernt.

Wer es einrichten kann, sollte hier früh morgens zum Shoppen gehen, dann findet man bequem einen Parkplatz im Parkhaus und ist nicht der sengenden Hitze ausgesetzt. Darüber hinaus hat man fast leere und aufgeräumte Läden ohne nervende Drängelei.

In den ca. 150 Stores findet man unter anderem Adidas, Benetton, Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, Levi's/Dockers Outlet, Nautica, Nike Factory Store, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Puma, Reebok, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger und viele weitere.

Für das leibliche Wohl ist dort auch gesorgt. Man findet hier beispielsweise Amorino Gelato, Auntie Anne's Soft Pretzels, The Cheesecake Factory, Dairy Queen, Kung Pao Wok, South Philly Cheesesteaks & Fries, Starbucks Coffee und Subway.

Unser zweiter Besuch am Nachmittag war allerdings nicht so angenehm. Die Parkplatzsuche war im Parkhaus doch sehr mühevoll und die Läden waren sehr voll. Sehr unangenehm empfand ich die unerträgliche Hitze und der ständige Wechsel in die klimatisierten Stores. 

Die Premium Outlets North sind täglich geöffnet. Die Öffnungszeiten sind von Montag bis Samstag von 9.00 Uhr bis 21.00 Uhr und am Sonntag von 9.00 Uhr bis 20.00 Uhr.

5895181,2014-09-26,17,GHS1rVjO-RMcRB6WJLpCDQ,"Las Vegas North Premium Outlets is an outdoor outlet mall located just a few minutes away from Downtown Las Vegas and The Strip.  Why do they have outdoor malls in the desert?  Well, it beats me because I couldn't bear the heat when I to these outlets in August so my shopping trip here was very short lived.  I imagine they would make more money in the cooler, winter months because when I went there once in November, I spent almost the entire day there.  The nice thing though, about these outlets, is that there are these water misting sprays scattered around the mall to cool you down from the heat.  The water spray is light and doesn't help a whole lot but it's better than nothing.  The last time I went, there was also a shave ice/snow cone truck called ""Kona Ice"" to help cool you down.     
      
Despite this mall being outdoors, I normally enjoy shopping here.  There are a lot of good stores here including Tory Burch (sometimes the store gets really packed so they make people form a line outside to wait), Rue21, Zumies, Michael Kors, Guess Factory Store, Bebe, and they even have an outlet store that sells show tickets.  There's a food court and a few snack kiosks as well.  
  
Overall, timing is everything at these outlets.  If you go during the summer, you will have to find a way to tolerate the heat.  There are multiple parking lots and structures but sometimes the outlets get so busy that you may have a hard time finding a stall.  The first time I shopped here, I had no trouble finding parking.  The second time I shopped here, I had to circle the lot a few times to find an open stall.  Their operating hours are pretty good as they usually close at 9 pm and are open on major holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day (shorter hours).",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,21,23,4,EJuJAlcVMl_dmY1RXqH4HA

There are definitely deals to be had. On our most recent trip, I scored a purse at Coach for $79! And my husband got a pair of custom made Oakley sunglasses for under $200. 

Keep in mind, this is a strictly outdoor mall, so it definitely feels like a desert atmosphere in the summer months. But they do have water misting fans scattered throughout that you can walk under. And the stores do a great job of staying air conditioned.

There is a huge parking structure, so there is ample parking. And they have one is one thing that should be a standard feature in all structures. Above each parking space, there is a light that indicates whether the spot is open or taken (red for taken, green for open). Why has this not become a common feature?!

Not all kiosk employees are like this, but a decent number of them jump out and yell at you like carnival barkers. ""Try this new hand scrub!""
