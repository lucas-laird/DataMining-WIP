Not only was the food cold when it arrived, but they also misplaced an order of fries and shorted me on the sides of fries I did order. When I contacted them to fix this issue, they said there was nothing they could do and if I would like another order fries, I could reorder them. I will not buy at Cheeburger again, nor will I use UberEATS based on how I was treated. I have pictures for those who want proof.

I tried the pizza burger which was interesting. I would have liked a little more mozzarella on my burger, otherwise it tasted good. The patty had a great flavor to it as well. Also shared a huge basket of fries/onion rings. The fries are seasoned with salted & pepper but of course I also had to get creamy cheese sauce to dip in. The onion rings are thinner with a light batter that isn't all crumbly like most places. Topped off my meal with a s'mores milk shake that was super thick and creamy.

926882,2015-09-19,1,fxuUGJ6si0QxcRKn_KNkEA,Last night was national cheeseburger day so I took my family of 4 out for burgers and shakes. Man this may be a better location for them because they were slammed. We were luckly enough to be sat right away. We all ordered shakes and appetizers. The onion rings and zesty horseradish is amazing. I had Jenny as my server who is in training and is a total sweet heart my normal server is Curtis (which to the rude remark from another reviewer judgemental much? Tattoos and piercings don't mean your a bad person and no I dont have any.) anyways food was excellent as always for us. There was a small hiccup on a topping I asked for but Sabrina came by and asked if everything was ok I informed her and she had it taken care of right away and we weren't even her guests. We have eaten here many of times and its never just my waitress who checks on me. I have had the pleasure of meeting the owners Dahli and Jahed and even they will refill our drinks and anything else we may need. So pretty much it comes down to if you have a bad time its because your just a negative person or because instead of letting them rectify the situation you sulk in it. Ps dont expect McDonald's fast food it does take time for your food to come......loved the Tshirt raffle last night wish I would have won.

My husband & I both ordered our usual, turkey burgers w/ lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles along w/ pepper jack cheese, I added some coleslaw and he added some black olives & chipotle mayo.  We shared a medium basket of onion rings which was plenty for both of us and my son had the cheese burger kids meal that comes w/ fries, applesauce or baby carrots & a kid's drink.  My 3yr old finished his burger, it was pretty small.  We've visited a number of times so I can't say the food is bad but its kinda bland.  The turkey burgers & onion rings need more seasoning but ketchup helps.  Maybe they keep the food bland so you can order some of their signature sauces, which cost a little extra or maybe just to allow you to add on a bunch of their free toppings to flavor up your own burger.  Overall its not too bad, with drinks & tip, we spent ~$35 using a BOGO 1/2 off coupon from the 89178 magazine we received this month.  I also noticed they do offer some $6.99 lunch specials Mon-Fri 11am-5pm on a few menu items.",pI_njybTKxqScZ0-60mI5Q,0,0,3,qFp2n9LA6UvuO6uooYuiwQ

The initial lady I talked to seemed too busy to even(even though there was only like 10 people in the whole place)talk to me so she shuffled me off to someone else. Never even got an apology. Then was asked if I'd still like to place my order. Will be another 10-15 minutes. 

- wait 15 minutes. Was charged fully. No apology or compensation of any kind. Not even 'would you like a soda while you wait'

- get home. Cold, stale bun. Tasteless meat. Burger torn to shreds in togo foil wrap. Don't have the bacon I paid for. Said I was supposed to get 2 onion rings on it, got one soggy one. Speaking of soggy...disgusting soggy fries. Ordered cheese dip on the side: tastes like you took that cheap gas station nacho dip and watered it down.

Burgers are perfectly cooked, and cooked to order, so don't expect it out in three minutes flat. Add on as many toppings as you want, most are free with charges for the obvious like guac and bacon. The 1/3 pound is their most popular, but by guy tends to get their 3/4 pound. Bun always seems to fall apart, not sure if this is because the patty is thick and toppings make it hard to bite or if they should upgrade to sturdier buns.

The Salad-Lovers-Salad is aptly named, and at $10 is a bowl packed with all your favorite ingredients, including several cheese options. You can make it as healthy (cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, pickles) or indulgent (cheeses, croutons, bacon) as you like. Protein is like $2 for grilled chicken, $4 for salmon. Even sticking to free ingredients, the portion is enormous. 

They have typical burger-joint apps, sides, and shakes. The fries are skin-on with salt and pepper, and I really like them but my guy prefers their thin-cut onion rings. Definitely try their fried mushrooms, which are sliced (like fried pickles typically are) rather than whole, for maximum crunchy surface area. Pair this with one of their dips, the Sriracha Ranch is my fave. I don't do shakes but my guy swears their malts are top notch.

Service is attentive and friendly, so long as you keep the whole ""this is not fast food"" thing in mind for the timing. Old-school diner Decor features movie photos and props, tables have movie trivia cards for entertainment.

2332371,2016-08-02,0,fxuUGJ6si0QxcRKn_KNkEA,"Disappointing visit, I expected better. 

I ordered online thinking it would save time as they advertise all food is cooked to order, wait time is usually 20 - 30 minutes. I ordered a Semi-Serious burger (1/3 lb) cooked medium on a Kaiser Roll, made it a platter adding onion rings and cole slaw, and a root beer for my drink ..the order to be as a 'dine in' customer. It was 7:23pm on a monday evening when I ordered and after being accepted online, I was promised the meal to be ready at 7:50pm. Cool...about 27 minutes, I can be there in 20 minutes...good timing, I thought! 

Lotsa road construction on the way, arrived at 7:45pm; walked inside, it's a neat little place all lit up 50s style with rock n roll oldies playing on the muzak.. pretty big menu of burgers, fries, rings, shakes, sundaes and floats. 
When walking in, I was greeted by a young woman who said hello and asked if I would be dining in or taking out. I had interrupted her conversation with a young man and a child who I assume were her husband and daughter. 
I replied that I had placed an order online and that I was dining in..she looked me up in the computer and I paid for my order. She directed another woman to get my drink for me and offered me a seat and returned to her conversation. 

Time went by, 7:50pm came and went .. there was no more conversation with me while I waited. At 8:04pm, the woman who seated me approached me saying they had no cole slaw, 'sorry, can I offer you a dinner salad instead?' No problem, a salad will be fine. Five more minutes passed and she returned with my food in a paper bag, to go. I mentioned that I did not order to go and she turned to the first young woman who was still immersed in her conversation with the young man and child, and asked 'was this a dine in?' ...what, she didn't believe me? 

I unpacked the styrofoam boxes while she returned with a knife and fork so that I could eat the salad. 
The disappointments continued .. my drink, in a styrofoam cup, (I shoulda got a clue then, eh?) was maybe a 16 oz drink that I paid $2.69 (there is only on size offered). 

The dinner salad was nothing special, a couple of hands-ful of lettuce and some croutons with a few pieces of diced tomato. 
The onion rings, a single order at 6 oz, consisted of 7 very small rings, battered in a tempura-like batter; the salad and the rings cost $3.99.  

The 1/3 lb burger was oval, not pressed flat, so it, and the tomato, sliced onion, etc kept sliding out of the Kaiser roll.  The Kaiser roll was stale and dry and toasting it did not conceal this condition. 
The burger, ordered medium, was grayish well done, dry, chewy and bland. I only managed to eat half of the burger before throwing it all in the to go bag and leaving. 

No one spoke to me or checked on me after delivering the meal to me..so, being mistaken as a to go order, I guess they felt no need to check on me while I sat there occupying their table. 

I don't expect they'll get a second visit from me... tsk, but, they were kids, maybe I expected too much...?",S8u8HDbrZvKn6TyxwzJnHA,0,0,1,GkUdHaoBqVKtfROk7oKJcA

I really like the vibe here....50's diner feel. Plus they got vanilla coke!!! Any place that got your diner style vanilla coke...I have to order one! =) Got a regular hamburger with the usual condiments on it. You get to choose from a looooong list of what you want on your burger. They got practically everything you can think of: mushrooms, onion rings, diced garlic...etc. Unlimited choices of your fixins and sauces. Only thing you have to pay extra is if you want more than one kind of cheese.
Also, my friend and I ordered a medium basket of regular fries....big enough for two adult females to share. 

In my opinion, the food was pretty good. Although I asked for my burger to be cooked well-done but there was still a little pink in the middle. This would have been a 4 star rating. I can't stand seeing my meat even with a slightest tint of pink...thank goodness it didn't mess with my stomach. Despite that, this is definitely a repeat restaurant.

There menu cut down arguably more than half it's former selection. I love(d) their sweet potato fries. I love(d) shake options they have chopped, gutted, and removed half of. And the biggest thing I remember noting about this place that I love(d) was their wait staff. They had the friendliest, most proactive staff I've encountered in a long time. Now they have cashiers. Like, literally... that's it. Granted they are pleasant and polite, I loved engaging in conversation with the servers there, and it's not like the cashier's are dull, but they are stationed where they are supposed to be, doing their job. 

This went from a restaurant to a fast food restaurant with no drive thru. This went from a place where the menu was infinity and beyond to finite... very finite. This went from a place that was like a second home with a second family that I'd frequent arguably weekly to strictly business.

Music is still oldies like the diner feel is and I do love that, food (while basic now) is still good. But the reality is there are other places I could be paying $8 for a burger that have the atmosphere I miss so much about this place.

We waited for 45 minutes for two orders of fries and one order of Buffalo Wings. Our wait was nothing though compared to three different parties waiting on to-go orders. One poor Uber Eats driver waited FOREVER. I'm hoping he still got tipped.

Manager ran around the place spouting off one excuse after another to each waiting table. Finally, when it came time for our check, it was again a waiting game. I ended up just going and standing at the register to  see if we could check out there. 

An employee took our cash ($20 bill for an $11 tab) and actually had the nerve to ask if we wanted our change back. Ummmm...yes! I'm sorry. You're NOT getting a $9 tip on an $11 tab with atrocious service.

Our poor waitress actually did a good job at keeping up on our table as much as she could within her power.

When it was all said and done, the last excuse of our dining experience that we were given was something along the lines of, our waitress had to go back and cook, and that's why we didn't have our check? WHY wasn't the manager back there cooking? Or at LEAST take over her tables for her so they're not just sitting there. Poor girl can't do everything, and obviously the kitchen needs some major help.

I was hoping for a better experience since it was my first time here and heard good things. I want to return on a different day.

5276155,2016-03-20,0,fxuUGJ6si0QxcRKn_KNkEA,"I've been to the location on eastern before and I felt like the service and food was better at the eastern location. I believe the buns were different from the eastern location because I don't remember all of our hamburgers spitting out the pattys when I bit into them. The waitress told me she had to be out by 830 and she wanted to know if I could cash out before she leaves (prob just received my food about 10 mins before her asking). She dropped the check and it wasn't correct. 3rd times the charm, finally got the check. She told me that the shakes would be ready when I was ready to leave. She checked out and I didn't see her after. I always give 20% even if I'm put in that situation. (I'm a waiter myself. But I never ask my guests to cash out when I have to clock out, I'll just transfer the check to another server so I don't rush the guest.) Anyways.. Waited for the shakes, they were great but again I had to ask for my shakes from someone else because my server left and she was supposed to prepare them. So I had to wait another 10-15 mins after I was done and paid for my shakes to go.",4AgyuR7BuL20OxFH_4Q_Og,0,0,3,puWbo5q0XfXd30v-oKQt1Q

And when you look at the pictures they have, they are in blk & wht. This place simply has no color anymore!",4wODftsrJwr3o87hucHNJA,0,0,1,STb9TFJ2fRd1_7KPzKjqeg
5442851,2016-04-20,0,fxuUGJ6si0QxcRKn_KNkEA,"Good burgers, but don't expect quick service as everything is made to order.  Had the 1/3 pound burger and it was quite good.  All the toppings you could ever want are just about included in the price.  The shake menu is a little over the top as you could make over a 1,000,000 combinations. With all the options, it does take some time to figure out what you want.

Pricing is fair and the service is good, but with all the options, the food and shakes do take some time.",hAZEee0Q7APAcerRQ4Ze3g,2,0,3,jTfNuqySrvmlGXc-7GNDCQ

We get seated right away and order the ""best of basket"" and 2 malts. Waiter disappears. Never comes back. 30 minutes later we are one of two groups left in the restaurant. No waters, no food, no malts. We finally asked the ""manager"" what was going on and he tells us the waiter forgot to put in our order.

5588263,2017-01-22,1,fxuUGJ6si0QxcRKn_KNkEA,"The shakes are great, the service is terrible.  Walked in, the 2 women ( one looked like she just rolled out of bed ) behind the counter were too busy to help.  One was on an ipad, the other took our order, but immediately said the other woman will ring it up and walked off.  Instead of putting down the ipad she fiddled with it for another few minutes (long enough where I wanted to walk out, but wanted the shake so I bit my tongue).  After she rang it up, they finally started making the shake at their leisurely pace.  I thought maybe it was me, but another client walked in and they didn't even acknowledge her the entire time I was there.

Fire these 2 immediately and hire someone who cares.  You will go out of business with people like that repelling your clientele.",BYPzwOBsZZzuWYkOCAyllw,2,0,2,CdX2nlDyG6_UW6BBrorcYQ

I brought a client in to try this place after a massage @  840pm and they refused service and said they had no drawer. We managed to get our order in just to be served shi##ty food along with @$$hole service.  I have never been so embarrassed for myself and the crew that Mr Jahard has hired.  I've tried to reach the Mr J,  yet no one knows his schedual or he's at another store blah blah blah I will be stopping payment on this establishment and will tell all my clients to try another place with better service.

Decent menu but a little over priced for what it is. The service was friendly and food came out normal time. I had the macaroni bites as an appetizer then a cheeburger pick your size they offer four sizes and I got a side of a mix of fries and onion rings. Food was tasty bit tab was a little high in the end. I could have gone to a better sit down restaurant for the same money.",grnJwZM1tCkPe8EVTMlmsQ,0,0,4,1IU6LS3XwGdVWSYszh7tDg
5818366,2015-10-04,0,fxuUGJ6si0QxcRKn_KNkEA,"We greatly enjoyed our visit at this quaint 50's retro diner. Service was fast and pleasant. The options to customize your meal are virtually limitless. Over 20 free toppings/sauces/seasonings to add to your burger, along with choosing your patty size. Even more options available to customize your shake/malt. 

We ordered chili cheese fries and out only disappointment with them was we forgot to ask for onions on them. They were delicious!! We also ordered sweet potato fries with a marshmallow cream dipping sauce... To die for!!! Our burgers were very generous with fresh ingredients. The only thing different I would do next time is order my patty medium well. Medium was too pink for my liking. 

Additionally, our shakes were by far the best part of our meal! Add as many flavors as you like with a lot of options to choose from. I ordered a seasonally appropriate pumpkin and cheesecake shake. The regular was almost too much! 

All in all, we had a delicious meal and wonderful service. We will be retuning and definitely recommend.",kwQ3BMAx-_cHmfEFH5qTfw,1,0,4,geihPqZg72-o10tBrGC6Aw
