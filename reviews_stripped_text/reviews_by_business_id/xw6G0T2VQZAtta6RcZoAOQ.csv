26256,2010-04-21,1,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"Cafe Rio is great.  I have eaten at their location on Eastern and am a regular at this location on Sahara.  They make their tortillas fresh by the minute, right in front of where you order.  They have great salads, burritos, quesadillas and tacos made to order.  Their two salad dressings are not to be missed- cilantro vinaigrette and jalapeno ranch (I get them on the side of everything!).  On Tuesdays they have special coconut shrimp tacos with mango salsa that are great.  They also do a very fresh chicken tortilla soup, which comes with a tortilla.  Their black and pinto beans are both vegetarian, their rice is seasoned with cilantro and lime and they offer wheat tortillas, if you prefer.  They offer two types of unsweetened iced tea at the fountain, a tropical and a blackberry green (score!!).  We take all our visitors here and even our So Cal friends are impressed with the shredded chicken tacos!  I love this place and my husband is a Cafe Rio addict, I only wish they were open later.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,1,4,n0UTUZy6dM4BDoKN32Johw

The employee literally asked ""well what do you want?"" The customer ahead of myself replied that she would wait for more and did so politely. The employee, with a smug look, then came to me and took my order. Soon after, she began speaking Spanish to the other employees laughing hysterically. Discouraged, I reluctantly asked for an order of queso and chips. The employee rolled her eyes, threw it in the bag and gave us our food. 
Once I was home I called the store to file a complaint and was immediately dismissed with the reply, ""K ill talk to the girls, have a good night.""

354544,2013-01-24,0,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"Pros:  good food, frequent/reward card/daily specials

Cons:  sometimes I find the employees less than friendly -- mainly the females - and speak poor English...never overly friendly, that's for sure.  There always seems to be a couple of extra employees just standing around at the cash register area -- weird!  I hate to say it, but the female employees are the worst - I've never had one of the males be rude, indifferent or have the ""whatever"" attitude.

The women's bathroom was ""closed"" the last time I've been at this restaurant - I believe it was Jan. 16 and 4 times during the past month - either they are too lazy to clean it or there is a problem...either way, clean the men's restroom - more than once/day...another reader below said they were there on 1/20 and the women's restroom was out of order, too...

Been there when they have been out of knives or when the fountain machine was broken...how do you run out of knives at 4:30 pm and not be able to get more in for the evening dinner rush???

They place all their utensils with handles down, so you get to touch all the utensils while you take one for yourself - gross!   This can't be health code!  Tonight I was in the restaurant and the girl was restocking - she didn't have gloves on - and was  grabbing a bunch of the utensils at once (not by the handles) and sticking them in the box...handle down...C'mon management - fix this!  

Also, they keep the cups right by the pay area/register - feel free to sneeze all over them.   LOL!  They should really keep their cups away from the register and the people moving through checking out... 


Prefer the other locations - cleaner and friendlier employees.",8h1n9EAM36TO3gF4cHlydA,1,0,3,c01cKv_te4ko9H20Spn9Ng

The service is usually friendly.

The food is pretty standard Rio food, but the mishaps have become too frustrating. We go there about weekly for takeout and every, yes every, time they mess something up. Last night, it was the salad dressings. They messed up on which dressing was included with the salad and didn't include the pint house dressing that we bought. The time before, it was the soda we bought that they forgot. The time before that, it was a 30 minute wait in line. Oh, and spoke to the manager the most recent time who was less than concerned. And so on, and so on. I'm over it. It's easily my favorite fast food place in vegas, but the frustration and 35 minute round trips to get whatever they forgot is too much. Farewell Sahara Rio.

We started going to this location about 3 years ago. First, we ordered online all the time. Our food was always wrong! We thought maybe the first few times it was just an accident (it happens), but after nearly 6 times of it being wrong I emailed the manager (not looking for any hand outs but just to let her know). I got a response and of course was offered a free meal and hopes of us coming back. Of course we went because we still love their food but now, we just go in thinking that would be better. Well, everytime there is a line because they move at a snails pace and it seems like noone knows what their role is. Last week my food fell on the floor because noone was watching the oven that they roll the food through! They werent even really that busy at the time and the cook was litterally 1 foot away and he watched it slowly fall off the side!! It takes them 5 minutes to go get jalapenos from somewhere in the back and most of the time we have to ask again for someone to get them because they forget.

There was a Bogo coupon, so I decided to go and give it a second try. I got off work at 9, and they close at 10. I arrived there about 9:40. Yes, I was one of those people. There were about 7 or 8 employees working. It actually took me quite a bit to order and leave. I ordered a burrito and a salad with the sweet barbacoa meat. The girl assisting me did ask me if I wanted it enchilada style. It would have been nice to know it was $1 more, which I wasn't aware of until I looked at my receipt when I was at home. I guess they are used to people already knowing that it costs more..... 

The food itself wasn't that bad. I do prefer Chipotle style burritos or maybe it's different when you get enchilada style as opposed to regular. My burrito came with the rice, and meat inside. The lettuce and pico de gallo came on the side. I guess it partially is my fault for not being an educated orderer. 


Yes, I know it was close to closing time, but I had really bad service. The girl assisting me did not know what she was doing. She was lost, talked to other employees while assisting me. Sorry, but I don't care that you only work closing shifts. I just want my food so I can leave. She left my burrito floating  ( I got it enchilada style.)

When I went to get my beverage, both the horchata and strawberry drink dispensers were empty.  Not even a spurt for the fountain sprayer.  And  this is despite most of the staff walking by the empty dispenser as they got their own drinnks and took their breaks.

I told the cashier that the horchata machine was empty and I would like some.  She said ""ok"", but after nearly 10 minutes there was still no horchata in the machine.  When I approached the cashier to see if they would be filling the machine, she SHOUTED at me, ""I KNOW""  Could not believe (a) that they would let the drink machines run out while the restaurant was still open and (b) that the staff were so poorly trained that they would shout at customers.

Tenty minutes after arriving and as we were finishing our meal, they finally put some horchata in the machine.  As I went to get a sip before leaving, it was readily apparent that no one cared enough to also fill the strawberry drink.

Food may be convenient, but service and training are certainly lacking.  Pollo Loco started very well but customer service after the were sold by Winchells made them a much-lesser pick.

When in the area and the food has always been fresh and consistent in flavor and quality. 
However, here In Las Vegas it's been hit and miss at this location and the location on West Lake Mead.
The salad lettuce is usually floating in water and often times they are out of food in the metal bins. 
I really have enjoyed eating at Cafe Rio and sadly may not continue to dine here any longer as I can't eat another salad that has 1/4 inch of water at the bottom and the tortilla is water logged by the time I reach the bottom of my salad. I'm grossed out! 
Sometimes the food and service is great other times it is absolutely dismal. When I'm hungry that's not a gamble I'm willing to take.",ZxKEiyBLhaaE9OXX6GnC0g,0,0,3,iIYzvrqvZ5BTu2j5GPcmcw

I arrive at cafe rio at 12:15 and tell the cashier the names I am picking up for. She then relays those names to the cooks. That was the first red flag. The food should have already been made seeing how my PICK UP time was 12:15. I'm waiting for my coworkers food and it seems like they aren't starting it. The cashier then relays the names two more times to the cooks. Three people behind me are served before my food is even ready. 45 minutes later there it is... My coworkers food.

The beans were being scraped from the bottom of the tin and there was little to no guacamole; so the worker pulled a tin of turned-brown guacamole from the fridge storage and tried to scrape the brown part off the top and mix it with what was left and then added a little salsa for some sort of half-assed leftovers. By the time I'd seen the ""guacamole"" she was going to give me I was about ready to leave but just declined it altogether. (And they still had 45 minutes of service left.) 

Dear Cafe Rio, 
Don't stay open late if you can't serve your customers the same as if they had been there at 5pm (which I have several times before). My late night meal was not ""a masterpiece.""

1208949,2016-04-27,4,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"Story time. The benefit of ordering online is to supposedly ""beat the rush"" by just coming in & picking up. Today I ordered online at 12:25pm and received a confirmation that says my order will be ready at 1:00pm. Cool! So I drive over & I walk in through the door at 1:15pm (don't like being one of those people who arrive on the dot and then are pissed its not ready). I walk up to the counter, the girl asks what I need -- I tell her, ""I'm here for pick-up, under Nikki order 889."" She walks to an empty shelf behind her and yells, ""Nikki for pickup!"" Surprisingly nothing happens. She keeps ringing people up. A few minutes later, she again yells, ""Nikki for pickup!"" It seems the people in line are ordering & getting rung up, and I'm still standing here confused. 

A few more minutes have passed, so she yells in the direction of the kitchen, ""Hey, can you do Nikki for pickup? Because she's already here."" Already here? I ordered an hour ago. I felt like she insinuated I showed up early or something. But anyway... A guy eventually comes up & grabs a receipt from her with my order. He looks at me and says, ""I'll make it now. At least it will be fresh!"" Good save. Not. I'm watching people come & go that are in line... If I just got in line & ordered when I walked in, I would have gotten my food 5 minutes ago. It's 1:33 now and the guy hands me my food & says, ""She won't charge you."" I said, ""I paid online though."" And he goes, ""Oh."" Shrugs his shoulders, crinkles up my receipt, throws it in the trash can & walks away. Huh. Almost got a free meal for the inconvenience, guys... almost. 

Lastly, I ask the girl, ""Can I just get a stamp please?"" as I hold out my stamp card. She looks at me (a little annoyed I feel), looks away... a minute later comes up to me, takes my stamp card from my hand, stamps it, picks it up & just drops it on my food despite my hand being out to receive it. Mind you, no apology whatsoever through this whole ordeal... from anyone. I walk out at 1:37pm. What a weird encounter. I wish they gave the employees name tags so I could complain. But the bottom line? Preordered at 12:25, walked in 1:15, left at 1:37. Beat the lunch rush by ordering online? Is this still even considered lunch? ""AT LEAST IT'S FRESH.""

I love the vinaigrette dressing as opposed to the house. This particular Café Rio has definitely gotten chintzy with the servings of meat they place in the salad. I suppose I continue to go because it is convenient to work, but in the last six months, I definitely go less often because the quality of my salad is not quite what it was six months ago. 
If you are in a hurry, you definitely do not want to go to this particular location at noon. Parking is difficult and the line can be very long. Calling and in order to pick up at noon does not gain much.  I have tried this approach only to find my order was wrong. 
The staff is not always friendly. I seem to be just short enough to not be able to yell over the glass what and how I would like my order to be, which seems to irritate the person serving me. While I understand they cannot hear me well, they certainly shouldn't be irritable because it's not my fault. I cannot be the only one with this problem, so maybe they should consider a different ordering method.
I have not tried other locations, so I can't say that being chintzy with the meat on my salad is standard for all of their restaurants. What I do recommend is if you happen to go to this location, order the burrito, a comes with plenty of meat!",MqWViEypCBBOldFI0wm51A,4,1,2,oGEaK4uoogi3JgliWLgvTg

She then opens the online ordering system and realizes no one paid attention that they had an order online to fulfill. She tells me it will be a few minutes and 10 minutes later of me standing there like an idiot in my PJ's sick and wanting to go back to bed, my small little cup of soup was ready to go. Luckily I paid by credit card online so I didn't have to pay so she just handed me the bag with a ""fuck off"" smile and didn't even wish me to have a good day.

Not that I would have not placed an order, but it was odd that it wasn't even mentioned until I got to the adding sauces portion of placing my order.  There were multiple people working and they were still open for several more hours, so it didn't make a lot of sense.  I also noticed that many of the drink machines were empty as well, enough so that when I left I thought I snuck in 5 minutes before closing, but there was still 3+ hours of being open.",n1MUh0PfMHdUmDkB1hXSYA,2,1,2,MXIt7xXaeEy871LxgJ3guw

I added a tortilla soup to my order, and the girl who has the easiest job on the assembly line copped major attitude. She popped her hand to her hip and asked if I'd ordered it at the front of the line- nope, because they didn't ask. ""You're SUPPOSED to order it at the FRONT of the line!"", she barked at me before dramatically rolling her eyes, glaring at me, and getting it herself. 

After dealing with the sassy pint-size brat, I was a bit more critical of the food. Salmon burrito, $10, overpriced and under-seasoned, large portion is soggy and bland. I'd intended to eat this for lunch and dinner, but tossed it halfway through.

Best purchase was the tortilla soup I suffered for, which came with crispy tortilla strips, fresh cilantro, and lime for garnish, was packed with tons of veggies, avocado, and cheese, and served with a  tortilla to make it a meal for just shy of $5. I'll take mine sans attitude next time.

EDIT: Dropping a star. I've been back 2 more times and the line has been insanely slow all times, and there's always a major issue with my order. On the plus side, after you point out their error, they usually remake it correctly and give you both.

At any location so I immediately told her can you please not put so much beans and just even if out since there's barely any rice and she was so mad and looked at me like really b****.

The employees are not only rude to the customers they only talk to each other while they are serving you.  No wonder they have to ask you two and three times what you wanted... they don't listen to you - only to their co-workers. 
Besides having bad employees the food is not very good either and I'm not sure about how safe it is to eat.  I even looked around for the health code rating because I'm sure the meat inside my burrito was below the safe temperature of 135°F.  I guess they thought the burnt tortilla would fool me.  
Most of the containers were practically empty so all portions were skimpy. The guy in line behind me even told the employee to restock the lettuce then finish his salad. They only wanted to give him one tong full of lettuce.  At. 6 p.m. on a Saturday night you think they would be well stocked.... and it was not busy at all.  People probably stopped going there because it is so bad.  
I purchased two meals and I had a card with 10 stamps on it so I was suppose to get one meal free.  After I paid for the other meal I asked for another stamp card (to use at the Cedar City, Utah location - which is great by the way) The employee told me that I could not have one. I told him I PAID for one of the meals and I should get one stamp.  He literally rolled his eyes, picked up a card, stamped it, handed it to me, and walked away NOT SAYING A WORD.   What a Jerk !!!! 
I tried to write a review on the Cafe Rio website so the owners would know how bad this location is.....but their ""Write a review"" is not working.  Maybe they get too many BAD reviews and are tired of reading about them.

I've been eating Cafe Rio since discovering it in Utah in 2005 and their arrival in Vegas is long overdue. 

Fresh tortillas are hot off the press- they're also brushed with butter and warmed on a stove with a little cheese, making the base for their salads. From there, everything from beans and rice to your choice of meat, cheese chips, guac etc. PILED to make a mountain of salad. And their tomatillo dressing is out of this world delicious. I seriously think I could drink the stuff!

I always order the shredded chicken as I think the fire-roasted chicken is too dry and the pork barbacoa is very sweet. 

My kids also order salads, which is very unusual for my boys. They're that good.

They also have Diet Dr. Pepper.

There were things that I liked about Cafe Rio and other things that just not impressed with or left without excitement of needed too come back again sooner then later. 

The whole idea of fresh tortilla LOVE it!!! Too see one of the working just going too town with twenty of them cooking at the same time. Little show for free. The circle flat top spinning in circle for sure helps not only the cooking process but that way no need too be seven feet plus reach the ones in the back. Lol! Always fan of seeing ones tacos, burrito, enchilada, or salad put together in front of you. Also fan of getting too choose which toppings or ones feel do without on. I like the fact not only horchata (really good), more then your normal fountain drink options had two other flavors mint flavor and other one pink lemonade or something close too. The portion size is great deal for the price under ten dollars. I passed on the rice and beans with my two tacos (instead made it three taco lunch) added one more price you pay. Still went ahead ordered side of rice just cause wanted too try it. All the topping were very much fresh from the greens, salsa, and course the tortilla fresh, The thought of fresh fresh tortilla is worth star all by itself!!!

I felt like all my tacos short was on flavor. I had one beef and two chicken tacos. The beef was  more disappointed with then the chicken. The beef was nice moist BUT with total lack of flavor. I could not tell if it was slow braised in bbq or whatever it was in. Honestly just bland. The chicken was slightly better had nice grilled flavor but again lack identity or something. Rather bland chicken. The toppings helped out came too lack of flavors. Course the crispy fresh tortillas. Saving grace comes too tacos. Maybe need too order the enchilada next time.

Talk about packed if coming for lunch don't be surprised if little wait. Even then it moves along decent pace. Forgot add one more thing like the fact that have outdoor patio area. It no water show just the parking lot. Still on nice day and if the place is packed too the max. Nice option. I did!

Cafe Rio is known for its enchilada style burritos and salads. Anyone that i talked to who didn't like it always got something else off the menu (idk what else is even on it) most popular is the steak or grilled chicken.

This place is similar to Chipotle in the way you order your food. You go down the line and let 'em know what you want added to your burrito, salad, etc. A neat little trick is that all the employees yell ""double meat"" or ""big meat"" or something like that when you order double meat. Hearing them yell in unison is almost worth the price of the double meat; it makes me laugh. 

Even on a Thursday, this place was packed. I couldn't even believe it! I thought to myself, ""Man, this place must be good!"" Surprisingly, it was.

-You can refill your own drinks
-Quick service, even though it was crowded
-AWESOME, AWESOME sweet pork barbacoa (They got an extra star for this.)

This location is always fairly busy. I hit it up at 1:00 PM on a Monday and waited in line for about 15 minutes. If there's a long line, it does move fast, but not lightning fast, so be patient. And be kind, don't play on your iPhone in line and hold things up. Know what you want to order (or sample) when you get up to the counter so the person behind you doesn't contemplate smacking you up the back of the head.

The employees here are pretty great for the most part. There's a few lemons in the bunch (aren't there always?) but generally they're helpful, positive and willing to let you sample (oh dear the samples). 

Must do's: if you're into the whole wheat thing, ask to try one of those tortillas - they're very good. Ask for a punch card and keep it with you - after you buy 10 meals, you get one free, and somehow the free meal just tastes even better (it should taste worse, considering you've spent about $100 now at Cafe Rio.

Only reason being four stars was that there was 2 empty tables filled with trash and having the workers just leave it there, aside from that you can't go wrong.

For the burrito you choose either a 12"" Flour Tortilla or Wheat tortilla, then you select your protein which range from shredded chicken, grilled chicken, sweet pork barbacoa (YUMMY), roasted beef, grilled salmon, or fire grille steak. Next you choose if you want black or pinto means and rice. Make sure to get it enchilada style (they pour your choice of sauce on top of your burrito.

Kind of a cafeteria style ordering system, you order the food and progress in line where you can watch it prepared and answer any questions they have or ask for anything you want.

It's the typical southwestern type food. They have a fairly good selection, I decided on the Chile Roast Beef (seasoned shredded beef) tacos, black beans and rice. It was good, certainly better than the burger I was going to get.

Would not drive very far to specifically go there, but if I'm in the area I would eat there again (I want to try the burrito, it was huge).

They gave me flour tortillas instead of corn and when I asked to change them they gave me cold corn tortillas for my tacos, so the food was nasty, but I ate because I was hungry and didn't have time for arguments.

You make your own tortillas cool, the difference in taste wasn't that big of a difference. Might be because the sugar burrito I ordered (the sweet pork barbacoa). I love sweet food but the barbacoa burrito tasted like straight sugar. I had to drench the second half in hot sauce just to balance out the taste a little.

We tried this Chipotle-style fast food joint today for the first time and it was so bad, I feel compelled to write about it immediately.  Upon first view, everything looked so promising....a long line, the homemade tortillas, fresh looking ingredients, smiling workers....but it all fell apart once we received our orders and tried the food.

My wife had a chicken quesadilla and it was one hot mess.  Greasy, gooey, sloppy and disgusting. She took two bites, probably one bite more than the quesadilla deserved, and gave up. 

My cheese enchilada with medium spice sauce was even worse; the sauce was extremely salty and had a very unusual, awful taste that made the enchilada inedible. I had one bite and stopped eating. 

The accompanying pico de gallo and shredded lettuce with each dish was pretty good!! 

The Diet Coke and Barqs root beer were also good.  The self-serve drink station was a mess however, with piles of overflow ice and overflow soda all over the counter and floor. I always view this drink station mess, just atrocious housekeeping, which you see in a lot of fast food restaurants, as a sure sign of a poorly managed food establishment.  The Manager should be canned for allowing such a hygiene and health hazard in the restaurant. 

I am amazed that Zagat rates Rio Cafe so highly.  It's one of the worst places I've eaten in Las Vegas.

My quesadilla was cold when I took a bite. I walked over to get a drink because I paid for a ""specialty"" drink. I look to get my drink, and not one, but 7 are out. All of the specials (non-fountain) drinks are out, both teas and one fountain drink.  We were told they are gone for the day. Mind you, they are open for 3 and a half more hours. No attempt to refill any of them. In fact, I watched one of the ladies take both tea dispensers and start cleaning them. One of guys came over to get a drink and when I mentioned something, he said ""it's like this all the time at night"". I saw each workers come out one by one, get a drink, sit, text and such and not wash their hands. So, if you want Mexican, go to a Mexican place. If you want mill workers, cold food, no drinks at a higher place, this is your place.",JqPuYBZikvb0GHWIap5Hrw,0,0,1,k_PJ2XlIY1gzpsMg65gNgw

I used to go in with the same issue but being told ""no chicken...""  when I reached the order position after having waited for 20 minutes.

I was so excited  to try it...I was very disappointed with the service the goung gentleman that help my son and I felt like he was being bothered more than trying to make us feel welcome being our first time there which I did mention to them. The young lady took over and she explained a little bit more about cafe rio, i did ask for steak and at 9 o'clock at night you guys were all out of steak which is kind of amazing to me when you guys close at 11 o'clock pm. I ordered a salad on accident that girl put guacamole. They remade it but the second time was even worse the tortilla was not even WARM the meat was COLD LIKE REALLY GUY'S 
anyway.. my advice work on  customer service.. I will not be returning for the fact there similar restaurants like you guys in their customer service is great their food is great and they do make you feel welcome at home.

4014521,2016-06-14,5,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"Aye, why am I so scared to go back to that other casual Mexican dining restaurant who shall remain nameless?  It rhymes with ""Chipotle"".  OK, it's Chipotle...but it's only because I can't find anything to rhyme with Chipotle.

Oh yeah, now I remember why I don't wanna go back to the restaurant who shall remain nameless (CHIPOTLE).  Because of that whole food safety incident.  Ah.

So until I muster up the cojones to go back, I have to settle for places like Café Rio for my big burrito fix.  I mean, what can I say?  Café Rio isn't that bad.  Of course it's familiar because the concept is the same.  Pick your type of dish, pick your rice, pick your beans, pick your protein, pick your additions...blah, blah, blah.

The food is OK in my book, but some of the meat flavorings are a bit bland.  I kinda have an issue with the pork being overly sweet to go in my burrito.  I just don't get it, why is it so sweet?  I would kill for some regular fatty carnitas at Café Rio!  Don't give me sugar, give me FLAVOR!  Let it seep out the sides!  Let me cover it with some hot sauce!  Let me dab the oil stains off with extra napkins!

Instead...I get a burrito...that I have to eat with a fork & knife.  Don't get me wrong, when I pick out my fixins I always get extra lettuce and extra pico de gallo, add cotija cheese on top.  I mean, my burrito is buried under a mound of beautiful SALAD.  But that's just it, why am I eating a burrito that I can't even pick up with my HANDS??  Café Rio doesn't even wrap the burrito in foil for you!  They put it in an aluminum bowl and slide it through the oven!  It's like promoting no-hands eating!  Yes, that is a conundrum in of itself.  Very perplexing.

So while I don't have a problem with the food at Café Rio..I have a problem with the food at Café Rio.  It messes me up because I want to eat my burrito the way it should be, with my hands at the helm!!  Totally jacks up my psyche.  It's like, I'm not getting the full experience of my burrito.  It leaves me with the feeling that I've gone half-@$$ed on my lunch!  What person in their right mind eats a burrito without the use of their hands??  No offense to those who have no hands of course.  It just leaves me in a tizzy.

On the plus side, +1 star at Cafe Rio for serving all-you-can-drink HORCHATA.  Yours isn't bad at all, I can soak up at least 3 glasses on a good day.  Then I can leave with a refill of Coca-Cola & lime!  Tasty.

Café Rio, I'll be back when I figure out how to effectively eat your burritos with my hands!  I will resist the pretty greens & veggies you throw over my burrito!  Maybe move them to the side?  Maybe get them in a separate bowl?  I dunno.

Maybe I'll muster up the courage to go back to that other casual Mexican fine dining place...that shall remain nameless.

4026919,2017-07-21,0,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"This place was pretty good. Food it tasty and a great portions for the price, we came here early on a Saturday morning not knowing what time they opened luckily as if timed perfectly got there just as it opened, we were the first in line but having never been here before we didn't know how to order or who to order too, stood there for about 10 mins just waiting, finally a guy placed tongs in the different compartments looks up and points at me and my sister. Being raised on customer service I didn't know what the pointing finger meant, I have never been there before is this like the soup nazi? He points you say your order and then quietly pay or no Burrito for you, now I saw all the pictures of burrito enchilada style and I was digging it and that's exactly what I ordered but the guy serving me said I shouldn't since I'm paying more for the same sauce and cheese that he puts in the burrito for free, so I decided ok not enchilada style since I don't want to look like an idiot for over paying, after I agree to not get enchilada style he ask me every time he adds a new ingredient if I want it enchilada style? I tell him you convinced me not to so no for the 5th time. So after he tells me which salsas he has and points to them as he names the types well I don't know if they switched the salsas from the usual order their in but he points at one and calls it hot then when I request mild he grabs the one he just said was hot, he did that to the medium as well so if I go back I have no idea which is which but I think I will pay a buck more for the enchilada style next time. The burrito has an interesting but delicious flavor I had the pork and I shared some nachos with my self, only gripe about the food is they cut the chicken way to thin you really don't get much flavor per bite almost string like meaning the chicken taste a lot more of the burn grill flavor then the natural flavor chicken has. Over all I will eat here again as food and quantity is excellent, just do me a favor don't point at your customers and don't assume everyone has eaten there before, especially if they're your first guest of the day and the restaurant is empty, the menu doesn't show pictures nor does your food look any different in the little metal bins, if you say pork I assume carnitas, and what I had was no carnitas, still delicious though and I'd eat it again.",sL860YoTntXh5XvuYsWxVA,0,0,3,ZlgdgN4stcJIfdV83hUObA

Now it was only me and I asked if they could fulfill my order. They told me the promised time was 545 so that's when they would have it ready which was a good 20 minutes away. Basically what they were telling me is that it would have been more convenient for me to wait in line and order then to order online when there was NO ONE ELSE THERE! The manager sensed my grief and told me they would start my order right away. Well it was not 540 and my order wasn't even ready yet. I had paid online and I couldn't just give them $28 bucks especially with the service being so horrible so I had to wait. 545 rolls around and I still haven't gotten my order.

When you tell me it will be ready by 545 it better be especially since you wouldn't accommodate me and get me out the door quicker.

He was raving about it and telling me that it was right up my alley. I'm kind of a brat....I like to think I know it all, so I just laughed and said, ""How could it be that great if I've never heard of it...?"" Blah, Blah. I'm so diplomatic, sometimes.....
So when we looked up a Vegas location near us, it was soooo crazy...they have one on the same block as the Chipotle that I so often frequent. I had apparantly driven by it a dozen or so times and never  even noticed or cared. But oh MAN, do I care now!! 
If you like fresh, fresh, fresh mexican food then this is your place. The chicken and pork burritos are exceptional, and it is all put together in front of you in assembly line fashion. The ingredients all look and taste fresh and fab. You can choose pinto or black beans, with all the fixings like rice, cheese, and salsa, etc....note....you can choose different ""sauces"" on your food... Cafe Rio has their own  very sweet sauce that they serve up which is great, but not too traditional for mexican food, ( If you are used to say, So Cal style like I am ) so if you don't like surprises, choose the ""medium"" sauce, which is more ""traditional."" (I personally adore the sweeter sauce.) What else is great? The coconut shrimp tacos are delish and savory, and I do love the salads as well. My fave is the Pork Barbacoa with the fresh Lime Dressing. I even ask for an extra serving of the dressing to take it home with me, it's that good. ...my Hubby was right!

4506584,2010-02-14,0,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"Kathy, my daughter, took me on my last meal while in Las Vegas to her fav' Mexican Fast Food spot... Cafe Rio. 

First reaction.... Dang, this place is POPULAR! As in lines out the door! And a little wait while you're waiting to place your order.

On the menu...

Wheat Tortillas (**** 1/2) On first inspection, these Wheat Tortillas look a little too crispy and maybe tough... One of the Assembly Line workers actually gave me a complimentary 6"" diameter Wheat Tortilla just to try! Definitely not a crispy exterior. The Tortilla is a very good alternative to the traditional Flour Tortilla made with Lard... which I still prefer!  But, if I'm in Las Vegas... why not? This is Cafe Rio's Tortilla-making station ( http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uxdGHvw2609oKu0R3z00OA/l )...

Fideo Friday Special (*** $6.95) When Kathy heard I was interested in the Fideo Friday Special... she responded with an ""Ewww!"". In California, however, there are a few courageous restaurants that advertise as being Italian - Mexican. I, myself, think that is not outrageous as one initially thinks. Let me propose this... Chile Relleno Ranchero Sauce with some Pasta... That to me sounds VERY GOOD and Tasty!

After traversing through the circuitous waiting line... Kathy and I arrived at the ordering / assembly line area... where the first glance is at the Wheat Flour Tortilla Making area. You can see the Tortilla Maker make about six HUGE Wheat Tortillas on a round Grill that reminded me of a huge Crepe Griller.

The Fideo Special just did not work... Too watery or liquidy for a Pasta dish whether it's Italian or Mexican. Or maybe the entree had just too many textures... Crispy Tortilla Strips, Grilled Chicken, Fideo... and then that daub of Sour Cream... SOUR CREAM with Pasta?!?! Dunno... just didn't work for me... did not seem like an integrated Entree... just ""stuff"" piled on top of each other.

Cafe Rio's Famous Tres Leches (**  1/2 $3.95) The Tres Leches, with slices of Strawberry and Whipped Cream.... was.... let's put it this way... infamous... not deserving of the fame claimed by Cafe Rio. I realize that Tres Leches with it's three types of Milk will have a resulting consistency very much like an Italian Tiramisu Dessert. The best version I've had was one that used thickened Milk which resulted in the Tres Leches having a consistency more like a Mousse or Custard. Just a suggestion...

Order of Iced Tea (**** Included with Fideo Special) Unlimited Refills... get it yourself at the machine...

Frankly, I was more impressed with Kathy's Pork Barbacoa Quesadilla. If I was rating that, and I only got about three bites, the Quesadilla would be definitely over 4-Stars. But, that was not my order...

During our meal, we noticed and heard all this shouting from the Cashier's area... Later, when the Lunch hour crowd died down... I asked that Cashier what's with the shouting? He said, unless the customer requests them not to shout, that the current customer requested EXTRA CHEESE (or whatever) or that the Customer just received a FREE MEAL with a redemption of one of their Buy 10, get one free cards.    For my part, if I come back.... no extra anything! And since I live in California... the Buy 10, get one free is of no use to me.


Kathy and I noticed, while we were eating that Cafe Rio has these HUMONGOUS Salads that are very popular... especially among the fairer sex. I was thinking to myself.... These Salads might have started out Healthy with all the best intentions.. but when the resulting Salad is close to SEVEN Inches high and weighing maybe 3-4 pounds.... There goes Healthy and Good Intentions down the drain... 

Something else of interest... Despite claiming to be a Mexican restaurant, the persons of authority, the Manager and Cashiers, were all non-Hispanic from what I could observe. Virtually all the ""assembly-line"" workers were Hispanic, though...

That's just a couple of thoughts...",K5FrmVM70cJDbMiZ9ywMag,0,0,3,wnu07iXaz5YoiS72ViDkWA

Their service is a bit lacking too but the food is good so I can overlook that. I pretty much stopped eating Chipotle after their incidence and I'm so glad to find a replacement.

Maybe it is just a gimmick, but it works for me.

I went on a Saturday when they have a mahi mahi fish taco special (also something that the other two joints don't have). They were pretty tasty. On other days of the week, they have salmon tacos, which I think is a pretty special offering, but I haven't tasted them. I am on the fence regarding the rice; it is definitely flavorful, but I am not sure if it is a weird flavor or a good flavor.

I can't imagine that they do the other meats better than Chipotle, but if you are looking for a quick fish taco on a homemade corn tortilla, you might want to swing by the Rio.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,7,3,Opnm8SZELVvm1GxnPgwbVw

I love that they have daily specials. Those are really good deals. But once I tried that Chicken Tostada Salad it was over for me. I never order anything else. It is the perfect amount of chicken, cheese and beans of your choice. They pile high the fresh lettuce and top it with Pico and Sour Cream and a few Tortilla Chip Strips. The creamy dressing is my favorite.

Last night my husband and his partner stopped for dinner (in uniform) at the Cafe Rio on S. Durango just south of the 215 at about 8:00 pm. They ordered their food without incident, but when it got to the prep portion of the line, the young black male refused to finish their order. Literally refused. He put his hands on the counter and put his head down-and refused to look at them. He let their food sit on the grill, burning. A manager had to walk up from the back and yell at him, he ignored his manager, and the manager had to finish it while he just stood there. I'm so disgusted. Cafe Rio has always had a great reputation for being Metro friendly! As much as I don't wish for anyone's job to be in jeopardy over this, something needs to be done. My suggestion is that we inundate that location with officers in uniform. 

Posted by family member of a police officer on Facebook, I think Cafe Rio will understand if I never bring my family to their place of business.",7T6neVkL2-8NvuA0qP9iBQ,0,0,1,uYsnGH9vZS0JdhvHX23rpw
5526834,2013-04-29,5,xw6G0T2VQZAtta6RcZoAOQ,"You know the famous 'Harry Met Sally' Scene? ""I'll have what she's having."" (If not, check out this sound bite, WARNING PG13: http://www.filmsite.org/wavfiles/whenharrymetsally4.wav) That pretty sums up Cafe Rio for me. It's one of the highest calorie, highest carb meals I ever allow myself to indulge in anymore. They must put crack in their meat because this place calls to me from the far corners of my subconscious.

I try to be health conscious, so here's why I only eat here a few times a year:
Pork Barbacoa Salad with black beans and all the fixings = 2112 calories, 257 grams of carbs., 103.5 grams of fat, 60.5 grams of protein, 95 mg cholesterol, & 4210 mg of sodium. Did I mention this was a salad??

I cut my calories and carbs down by skipping the tortilla, the guacamole, and I only use 1/2 of the creamy tomalillo dressing they give you (600 calories, and 26 carbs removed). I also can only eat half at a time because their portions are HUGE!

My all time favorite meal here is their aforementioned Pork Salad, which says an awful lot because I never order pork anything from anywhere. My stand by favorite is their chicken burrito, smothered with green sauce. (I'm salivating just thinking of it!) Everything is made fresh, tortillas included.

This location is great, always pleasant service. Be prepared to stand in a long line if you come at regular meal times, but I promise it's worth the wait. Law enforcement gets a 50% discount (but I believe you have to come in uniform). Also, ask for a punch card - every 10th meal is free!",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,5,1,5,v9T9dFZ3usbJTrZhOFJgIQ

They're famous for their sweet bbq pork which would've been great..in a barbecue sandwich! The sweetness was too much and really weird in a burrito, even weirder in the salad my wife got.  I would just go with the fire grilled steak or chicken if I could do it all over.

I also disliked how they wouldn't put guacamole in the actual burrito itself.  I was given a teeny, weeny scoop of The Incredible Hulk TV series colored avocado on the side.  That was gross.  Mexicant, Mexidont, Mexiwont.

A couple of things save Cafe Rio from 1 star and that's the quality of the tortillas and the drink station.  Their fresh tortillas could possibly be the best by a Mexican fast food chain and the biggest reason I may give it another shot.

I recently went in here for lunch for a change instead of Chipotle and at the time they didn't have any steak available.

I ended up leaving to go to Chipotle because of the long wait and the awkwardness I felt as people walked right past me as I waited in my spot in line. 
What keeps me coming back is really the food. The house dressing is amazing, meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned every time. I do wish they'd be a little more generous when it comes to their servings--I barely had any rice in my last tostada.

I had to tell the next guy in the prep line (who was very nice) that we did not want the burrito because it had no beans in it and then compromised to have him add beans on the side because I didn't want my boyfriend starving out of pure spite. That prep person arranged for it to be free with the cashier without my noticing. And then I get to the register and the cashier is completely short with me when I begin asking for it discounted not realizing he just told her it was free. I wasn't expecting her to comfort me over my crappy burrito but I certainly wasn't expecting to be treated like I was the person inconveniencing her.

My conclusion, I came in here planning to buy TWO food items properly prepared according to what's written ON THE MENU. I did not come in here planning to buy ONE item and receive another one FREE and SCREWED UP. Don't give me stuff that's FREE AND SCREWED UP. Have some standards and don't ever hand out stuff that screwed up free or not. On top of that, don't treat me like I AM the one creating a problem for you, when YOU screwed up. 

If I am ever in the area again I will go to Chipotle instead. Even though I never, never, eat at Chipotle and I feel uncomfortable with the idea of eating there, at least I can hope to not be served by people in such a ridiculous manner.",-Cm0UFJ2ks2_XgvVtTqMVA,1,0,1,jFisOYGggl0d2WAC8a8gaA

Ridiculous that something so simple they can't get it right. I'm going to go to the Durango location ... much better service and faster than the one on Sahara.,-oTw_GxmyX_5TA65-wzGig,0,0,1,MIRaXZHxWbkhzExhDcGPqQ
