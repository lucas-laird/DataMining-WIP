My husband loved it so much that he will take me back to a farmer's market for Walter's food. We are from Georgia and it  tasted like home to us.",pDTCj8tRab010fHaTlOWOg,0,0,4,G51hdg1LUfM-nw2hIbOPEw

SECOND - neither chicken nor links were completely cooked!

I had to microwave at home.

LASTLY - Taste: cheap sauce and way too spicy in a cheap way

Sorry, Walter, you are lucky you are not shut down. This is crap-ola!",Cwdo5TmfP8jYj41u670PfQ,0,0,1,uQhO-lZedGkinyltzF6jlA

When he gave me his secret sauce (No pun intended), on my chicken it was absolutely astonishing. I had never tasted anything that delicious in my life, and still to this day I crave his secret sauce all over the breasts of my chicken. Might I add-he and his wife are two wonderful people, it's unfortunate that I now live in California, and am unable to go to their Cajun Barbeque-but if you have the luxury of visiting his BBQ spot, please check it out!",mVAw5cG8H_M6eO34gOZH0A,0,0,5,5xvBrXbRfBbmVAf7U8gWoQ
