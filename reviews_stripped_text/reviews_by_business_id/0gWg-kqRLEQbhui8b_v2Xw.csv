One of her co-workers recommended it so we took the chance. We are glad we did! Since it had just opened we didn't know what to expect we had a great server, April, she was really nice and as we talked we found out her husband is really into organic gardening and so is my friend! Even though it was busy April took time with us suggesting the ahi poki and the bison burger and the short ribs it was all very tasty. I typically don't drink beer but she suggested a blonde ale (cant' remember the name of it) and it was pretty good! We enjoyed the evening didn't feel rushed and felt taken care of we will come back!

708654,2016-04-04,0,0gWg-kqRLEQbhui8b_v2Xw,"We used to live right around the corner from the Hi Scores on Stephanie and loved it.  They had a great food selection and some awesome games.  It was a place where we met up with friends to have a great evening out.  We were having another friends night out with seven of us and this location was much closer to the majority of the group, so we decided to try it out.

What a terrible mistake that was.  My wife and I arrived a little later than everyone else, so it was no surprise they had their drinks already.  We were seated in the bar area and we were the only group in there.  We waited for the waitress to figure out we were there, which took 5 minutes.  My wife ordered the Start Button and I ordered a coke, and we both asked for a water.  The coke and booze took 10 minutes, at which point we all ordered food, and waited to see if she would ever bring the waters we ordered.  Nope.  We asked again and she ended up bringing my wife a water 5 minutes later.  I asked again.  More minutes elapsed and she finally brings another water to our table, at which point one of our other friends decides she wants a water.  The waitress literally picks up the water that she just set down in front of me and gives it to our other friend who just ordered it and then asks if anybody else had wanted a water.

It took the entire kitchen to eventually bring out our meals and our waitress just stared at them dumbfounded as they, arms full of plates, tried to dish out the entrees while she, standing there empty handed, did absolutely nothing to assist them.

This was the kind of place that made my spidey sense tingle about food safety.  I ordered the Bison Fig Burger, though I had friends taste it and smell it before I would eat it.  One of our group ordered a salad with grilled chicken and half of the lettuce came out slimy.  She disgustedly picked it off and showed the waitress, who tried to explain it away before finally offering a replacement item.  My burger was $16 because it's bison but everything seemed to be a touch more expensive than you'd expect out of a barcade.

We had hoped that their selection of games would make up for outrageously bad service.  We were mistaken in that regard too.  Most of their games are horribly dated (and not in a good Space Invaders/Asteroids kind of way) and the variety wasn't even close to the other location's.

At this point, the waitress had unsurprisingly messed up the bill.  We didn't even care.  It would have taken another 15 - 20 minutes to flag the waitress down again, so we just paid so we could leave.  Even though this place is not even all that large, and we were the only table seated in the bar area for a long time, I feel like 85% of our time here was spent waiting for the waitress.  5% was spent eating and and the other 10% was spent marveling at how messed up and disappointing everything was.",n1B1kiN3WHejdrmHgU5P2A,3,0,1,7je8ryzqc1UFLGgXNlcLPQ

We were blown away by this happy hour. Usually there's only a few food and drink items, but man this place is killin it!

We ordered BBQ pork fries and the corn dogs. I was craving some BBQ and thought why not try their fries. I wasn't exactly impressed as the sauce was a bit watery and runny. The corn dogs are wrapped in bacon! Did I forget to mention that part? :) These things are AWESOME!

The waitress had asked when cleaning the table 'did I not like the fries?'. I explained that I wasn't a fan. She came back and asked 'what about it didn't you like? The chef would like to know.' That right there is awesome! That shows that the chef wants to improve, but also wants to make sure people leave w/ happy bellys. LOVE IT! 

They do trivia night on Tuesdays. Get their early as the place does fill up. They even go head to head w/ the other Hi-Scores. This location offers up free video gaming on actual arcade games as long as you're buying booze or food.  The staff is super fun and nice.

At first, I was really excited. Solid tap list, check. Free play on all the arcade machines, check. Super nice and fun bartender, check. Menu that is a classic hits list of every delicious bar food you've come across until now, check.

Everything was going great - until we got our food. The artichoke & chicken pizza was spot on, I'll give them that. A nice, thin crust and a lot of cheese and toppings. The wings however seemed to be primarily made with one spice in mind, pepper. They were just absolutely covered in cracked black pepper. They weren't awful tasting, exactly, but...who wants a pepper flavored wing? Not me :/

Things didn't get much better when we got the corn dogs. They are huge, clearly made in house, and the corn bread was delicious. It just wasn't cooked all the way through. So halfway down the dog we encountered some oozy cornbread dough which sort of turned us off to wanting any more.

That being said, the hangover fries were pretty good, if not a little over-seasoned (maybe our bad for doing garlic fries instead of regular). I think if there was a little more attention to detail that the food here could be really solid and as enjoyable as every other aspect of the bar. I'd still come back in a heart beat to drink & play, but probably will pass on the food unless it was a salad or something very basic.",mccwaSL44m9AaxIS7tPEeA,0,0,3,U5GxikHp1evAhsRGZTcfvw

The arcade selection is okay, I found most of my time playing Capcom bowling. The most fun came was the Pacman versus which can be played with 4 people.  I can't find myself going back craving to play any of the games. It was great that the games were ""free"" to play (as long as you're a customer!)

Besides beer, they have a selection of wine and wine cocktails, which do not include the prices. The wine cocktails were around the 10 dollar mark which was expected. Well drinks ran around 5-8 dollars which is average.  I also ordered the garlic fries, but for $5 I wish there was a larger serving, especially as a fry fan. 

One thing that I appreciated was how they handled rowdy guests. There was a small group who were incredibly loud and obnoxious and it was clear they were disrupting the general public of the area. Within 10 minutes or so I believe they were escorted out because one of them said ""they got in trouble."" Once they left things got better! 

I can't imagine myself craving to come back but if I was with my friends and one of them suggested going back, I wouldn't oppose either.",4a8gIW8HD8L2IGyK-O5mYA,4,0,3,prM_sUYQjEgDAHWbCRhfeQ

So we had our small 8 pound dog with us so we verified you could have your dog on the patio. An employee said we could have the dog on the patio. We got seated and put our dog on the chair in a blanket. An employee came out and said the manager said our dog couldnt be on the table because of a health code but our dog was on a chair. Anyway so we started talking to a manager and he said any place that allows dogs they shouldnt be at table level. Every place ive gone with my dog she has been allowed to sit on a chair table level. 

We ended up leaving before we even ate.

Also the location doesnt allow dogs but the employees dont know.

2708258,2016-03-20,3,0gWg-kqRLEQbhui8b_v2Xw,"I was a weekly regular to Home Plate. Primarily I'd go for happy hour on a Thursday or perhaps sneak in for Sunday breakfast. I went to two reasons: 1. I loved the bartenders and; 2. the bar was local. Sadly, those were really the only reasons. Though I loved the bartenders, I am more loyal to the neighborhood than Home Plate. It was a long wait, but ""Hi Scores"" has finally opened!

Concerning the local establishments prior to ""Hi Scores"", it has been more about the bartenders than the actual ""bar"". The reason is I am not a video poker player thus no matter what my relations with the bartender, I have always felt like a second class ""guest"" trying to find spots between machines and often getting the wobbly stool. Alas, I am just the parasite that is just there for a few drinks and a meal (hey, I tip well). Still my ears are open to the soap-opera stories, most of which center on the gambling and ""comps"". 

The long wait for ""Hi Scores"" has seriously been entertaining with theories. The consensus from the local workers in similar establishments is that there would be a different ""crowd"" that would frequent the new ""Hi-Scores"". There would be a younger and more immature ""crowd"" - ""Non-tippers"". How can an establishment of such nature work without gaming? I always argued the point disagreeing that due to the area, the logic didn't make sense, but I was in the minority. 

Okay, let's set the record straight. ""Hi Scores"" is TWO bars! Two VERY cool bars! I seriously love this establishment! This place definitely raises the scale for the neighborhood.  One bar is 24/7 gaming and the other opens around 10am and has a classic rail without the embedded games. This really meets the needs of a wide range of customers! They truly cater to BOTH the gambler AND the simple drinker (pathetic me...). A rail without video poker ever couple feet? Madness! 

But wait, what about the atmosphere? I mentioned cool above but there is more... There are large screens TVs showing all the games in both bars. Extreme beers on tap. Excellent food. Free classic video games. I love the bartenders! Hell, what is there not to like? They are friendly and social. Did I mention the atmosphere looks cool!

First thing to note is there are 2 very distinct sections at Hi Scores. There is a side that has a long bar with 30 ish beers on tap in the video game lounge. You'll find a bunch of old school video games in this spacious room. There is a large community style table with a couple of smaller tables. Go through the corridor to the restrooms or pass the restrooms and end up in the gaming lounge. There are a lot of bar top machines and a few golden tee machines. Couple of large round tables and a couple of smaller tables. Flat screen tv's are all over the place in both areas. Perfect for watching your favorite sporting event. 

The menu is mainly split into burgers and pizzas. There are also a few entrees like fish n chips as well as Mahi tacos. But I have to say, the Bison Burger is king. Bacon, Bleu cheese, and a perfectly cooked bison patty. A must try. Also had the mega meat pizza had a nice thin and crispy crust. This pizza is loaded with salami, pepperoni, sauage, and bacon. A solid menu item. The patio area is perfect foe our current weather. A great spot to have a drink and chill. It also has a few golden tee machines as well.

The waitresses never come back to give you an update on your order or ask if you need a drink refill. Last night was the icing on the cake the waitress first messed up the drink order and came out with 3 drinks instead of 4. Then when the food came out she completely left out one order and she apologized and said it would be right out. An hour later still no food. The food was terrible!! It was dry and has no flavour. I am so surprised how much it has changed in there and something needs to be done about the completely terrible service and the completely tasteless food (sliders, chicken and waffles, etc)I only recommend going there if you plan on staying out of the arcade side because you will wind up annoyed.

We bought a Groupon and tried 2 appetizers and a few drinks. 

-Appetizers were amazing... Like not just bar food good,  but $14 a plate-restaurant-quality-good (wings and nachos) 

-Drinks...they have a pretty good selection of beers on tap and of course your normal bottled beers. I also tried the Bubble Pop (Blood Orange Puree, Simple Syrup & Champagne) I highly recommend if you like sweet drinks..im craving it right now! 

-Games...
     - Pros: games were free, Pacman was the best game 
     - Cons: many of the games were broken, not well maintained, not very plentiful 

Why the minus 1 star? 
     -parking is difficult
    - long wait for drinks, food, and closing our check/tab out
    - not a lot of games/many games broken
    - layout makes it feel crowded/cramped

There's a few TV's above the bar to watch the game and behind it the fun starts. There's around 15 or so arcade games (the ones when arcades we're still a thing) that are free to play. Out front is three golden tee owned video games as well, I believe it's golf, corn hole, and darts.

I'm a big fan of their beer list and the food is good too. I don't usually like getting food at bars since I'm not always happy with the quality, but Hi-Scores has good food.

On the barcade side there's not gaming, but the building does have a bar/gaming side that is just around the corner. Or if you walk to the bathrooms and see a door that looks like there's another bar you can make it that way too (not saying that's how I found it lol).",XoKJgmuHPMwd_C4x7cUqWg,0,0,5,M6OQSJgkcs0kzjJtf-aGng

The nerdiness isn't that nerdy. This seems like a poor use of space to me. This part stinks like smoke real bad so it would benefit from some ventilation, that being said, the real crime here is the games.

The 4 Player vs Pacman machine is on point, and that's all. They have a bunch of games that no one remembers fondly (except maybe space invaders) and 1/3rd of them don't work too well. Sure theyre free, but why not a Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter Machine? Where's NBA Jam? What about the Simpsons, Turtles or Xmen? Afterburner? Gauntlet? Golden Axe? NFL Blitz? Lethal Enforcers?

I also liked the idea of ""Free Play"" gaming. It was nostalgic and entertaining, but it wasn't enough for a 5 star rating.  

The reason for such a low rating was mainly because of the service. For a slow bar you'd think customer service would be somewhat adequate, but this was not the case. Our waitress didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink (beer) she did bring us water and a coke but that's because we asked but we wanted beers as well. The staff definitely needs to be properly trained, they lack customer service. The bartender only catered to her friends or regulars sitting at the bar. Business need to realize that people are willing to send money in any and all establishments but the customer service has to be outstanding

I always make it a habit to ask what is the best or most popular dish/appetizer. And she suggested the BBQ Fries. I said okay, and I got 1 order of BBQ Fries. The fries came out cold and soggy, the cheese was so melted it was stuck to the bowl. The pulled bbq pork on top was okay.

Perhaps when responding to a guest review- try to gather accurate facts before addressing. And when you address, try not to suggest with sarcastic use of times that said guest's facts are ""odd."" Also try to realize- I already forgave you guys the first time, second time, and third time around that I received bad service- which had nothing to do with anyone being slow, but rather overlooking, neglecting, and missing details. Something which you are proving right now, as I believe you've entirely missed this point.

Egg was cooked beautifully tho but I didn't drive to blue diamond for a damn egg.  Chinese meatballs nothing to brag about in fact I felt they're old with some hastily made (or bottled)  sauce drizzled on top. 


  I only ordered because the website proclaimed amazing and updated bar food. Nah. Not at all. For the amount I paid I opened up a box to seventeen thick, burnt  but wet fries. Yes I counted. Half of those fries were inedible.  I did not drink but their cocktail specials seemed reasonable. Being called an arcade bar is extremely debatable when all the games were the typical boring bar ones, not one console. Even the Phoenix has a Nintendo 64. 

However bartender was very nice over the phone and during pickup and he really is this places's saving grace. Should have asked for his name. I would come back but there's better bars with better specials and I'm more impressed with food then cocktails I can make at home so very unlikely I will come here ever again.

There is a porch before entering where people can sit outside on couches and play games too. I would recommend during cooler temperatures.

The service can sometimes be a miss due to the location being very popular. I am usually able to get my drink orders quickly, and they are very attentive at the bar. However, I have been with a party of 4 people sitting at the table and the food took longer than 40 minutes, mind you only two of us ordered sandwiches.

Fiancé and I ordered food and decided to play games while we wait. If you haven't been to the Hi-Scores on Stephanie the retro arcade games are FREE to play ... which is the same for here.  However being that this bar is trying to promote their free games I think it's very important that they games work.  A lot of the two player games inside didn't work well for ""two players"".  The games I recommend inside are pinball and Pacman Versus (basically Pacman for up to 4 players) and outside all the golf games are fun to play, especially when you got a group of people.   

I was surprised the food came out pretty quick.  Food is good for bar food, not bad, but nothing to brag about.

Pros: 
Good service and attentive bartender
Actually a really amazing draft beer selection, very impressed by this.

Cons:
Food is exactly what you'd expect from bar food but whatever they're doing back there for certain dishes is weird.

Wedge salad is supposed to come with blue cheese maybe even ranch but mayonnaise? What kind of weirdness is this?

Perhaps you should disclose this before serving my 2nd drink or just include it in the overall price of the drink and not charge it as a separate item.
