They're very friendly and immediately added some spring rolls for free after I was done ordering food.

The food tasted AMAZING! Everything was top quality and very flavorful!!!! Portions were spot on and the delivery didn't take as long as they said it would! 

The only ""negative"" is that they don't offer dessert...but hey, it's alright!",7wwOcbaKLfqSJHrEgb5LDg,2,0,5,s3KKcYTh9l9mZCZraSsM-w

2781124,2018-06-01,0,Yo8NIJEtc8UEbPd38L35ow,"My new favorite Chinese food place! 

Everytime we come, we're seated right away. The restaurant is clean. The family that runs the restaurant is friendly and very courteous. I always order the Moo Goo chicken lunch and my partner ordered the Mongolian beef. The lunch combo comes with a drink and a bowl of egg drop soup. We ordered crab rangoons this time and they gave us two egg rolls on the house!

Everything is always cooked and seasoned to perfection. It's made fresh and there's never a long wait for food. 

If you're looking for the best Chinese food in town, you've found it.",ED9OnMARkMipUr2qy6cTcw,1,2,5,qHbqnsE9eL2louxdXxVKfQ

Many of the Chinese restaurants near by seem bland and underwhelming, not this place! The food was delicious we had generals chicken and tofu with veggies.

Like most Chinese restaurants, food are made when ordered but here they are pretty quick. I really like their Sliced BBQ Pork. Portion for that dish was way more than I expected especially for it being an appetizer. Its really tasty and the char sui sauce it's stir fried in reminds of the dish I grew up eating.  Really pleased and will definitely be going back.",EzhAOVu1_rtE6gCuCiSIFw,0,0,4,7dSacdQhri3s6SeWyNR_Wg

The food was fresh and the service was great.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this restaurant had tables we could sit at. From the outside it looked smaller than it was.  We will be back to try other menu items also!!!",eaGunG-rwZhhTp4qOrkxSQ,0,0,5,KECrT6BZlpwU10VL8OZ7VQ
5493695,2018-06-17,1,Yo8NIJEtc8UEbPd38L35ow,"Their food sucks.  I ordered the Orange Chicken and it was hard and way too sweet.  The brown rice that I ordered with it was terrible.  Hard as hell and no flavor whatsoever.  My friend ordered the Mongolian Beef.  They put 15,  yes 15 red peppers in her food but they also filled it with a bunch of Jalapeno peppers.  Really?  Do they want to burn a hole in her stomach.  My roommate said the combo chow mein was good but they included some weird fried noodle things that was supposed to go with it.  Totally odd.  We ordered delivery and that was the only good thing about this place.  The food came in pretty good time.  Also the only other thing that came that we actually didnt order was the fried wontons and those were good  and the pot stickers were ok.  Very bipolar place.  Don't get it.

I will never order from them again.  As far as I am concerned,  I wasted my money on ordering from them.  There are much better places closer to me that I can order from.  I am stunned this place got 5 star reviews.  Ridiculous. Never again.  Lame and the person taking the order had to be told 3 times the numbers for the food we were trying to order.  Get it together.",XiA038PHn_fq-s7p38S00g,0,0,2,mOj--Ab24u0fjpHXwABjuw
5674767,2018-06-07,0,Yo8NIJEtc8UEbPd38L35ow,This is a very beautiful restaurant inside. The food was prepared to my wife's specific needs which was a plus. Won ton soup was delicious. It was a slow night so the wait staff was cut back because of that I'm sure however it was ok yet not as attentive as I would have liked.,pbiktUAHIv_jijj6KxEH5g,0,0,5,C0ws8CY7As-72HLUosklWw
