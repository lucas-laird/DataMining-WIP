4057,2012-03-15,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Found this spot right around the corner from my house. It was a quick stop for my son's breakfast before school. Didn't have time to review the menu but my son wanted some bacon, eggs and pancakes. We ordered the super breakfast combo which is 3 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage patty, pancakes and hash brown or fruit. We upgraded the pancakes to the banana nut and substituted rice instead of hash browns. Portion size was huge, my son and I shared and took home some of the leftover pancakes. The banana nut pancakes were great, you could taste the bananas and every few bites you got some nuts. For our first visit which was a quick stop we really enjoyed our breakfast and what we paid about $10. Plan to come back to check out more of the menu.",3Pv_rjPLE7p6mALjtKKyDg,0,0,4,o1qNGM7k3eeu0MCTT2Ks6w
32861,2013-02-17,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Tried this place today because Baby Stacks is usually so busy and I had been wanting to give it a go for a while. After this one visit all I can say is it is mediocre and I am not eager to come back. 

The service was good - not fantastically attentive but very friendly. We had 4 different waitresses over the course of the meal so it seems they rely on each other which is fine. My plate was pretty disappointing. I ordered the corned beef hash with eggs over-easy and fruit instead of hash browns. They gave me hash browns as a mistake but immediately brought over a cup of fruit, which was a mug of cantaloupe and orange only but fresh. My first complaint is the eggs - they looked cooked but once I cut into the yolk there was a lot of clear raw egg white. This just isn't appetizing to me so I had to scoop a lot of it and the hash it ran into off my plate. Second complaint is the corned beef in the hash. It just wasn't very good. The beef is in cubes, not shredded, so the consistency was chewy and the flavor was slightly amiss. I tried the hash browns since they were there but they were pretty greasy and soggy. My English muffin didn't come with butter on it so I asked for some and it was really cold, too cold to spread. It may seem that I am being nit-picky but breakfast should be easy especially when it is this simple. Overall the people are nice and my bf enjoyed his steak and eggs for what it was. 

Next time, though, I think I'll brave the crowd at baby Stacks.",h7x-uZWE945gnJMC0Ynf8A,0,0,3,dQcyv_Sgx54wpL8O6K0Rng

342190,2014-05-20,3,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Went here on our way out of town since we pass it so often and wanted to give it a try.  When we arrived it took a minute to be seated and once the hostess was available she placed in the very back corner by the bathrooms, not an ideal spot but considering the lack of space in the place, we didn't complain. I looked at the menu hoping to have a mimosa as a celebratory item for our mini getaway and instead ordered a soda since they did not offer alcohol. 

This is where the trouble began...The soda and waters that we ordered came back rather quickly. The soda was brought in the can with an extra glass, I explained to the waitress/hostess I would not need the extra glass, if you were going to give me the can and charge me the same as a fountain drink I would just drink it out of the can. We went ahead and placed our orders, he had steak and eggs and I ordered the huevos rancheros, the waitress commented on how good they were. It took a little bit for them to come back with our food and I'm pretty sure there was some sort of shift change or something because all of a sudden there were new waitresses and people sat after us were receiving their food. Finally a new waitress came back and brought our food out.

The steak and eggs was sad looking. The 8 oz steak was a little overdone for medium and frankly way to small for that big mean plate. 

My huevos rancheros....were not huevos rancheros...I have never been so repulsed by a plate. Under the mountain of melted and slightly burned cheese was some more grease with bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, and then the eggs and beans and somewhere underneath that was the tortilla. The beautiful part about huevos rancheros are the eggs and I couldn't even find them. After a few minutes of trying to get past the carrots, which if I had known that they were on there I never would have ordered this item, I gave up and felt sick. I had run out of soda and water and steak and eggs was out of water too and for the life of me the new waitresses would not come back to give us anything else...I told steak and eggs that I was going to the bathroom and he could send my food away..

After a small upheaval in the bathroom, I came out and he was explaining to the manager Norm that I did not like my food on the advice of his waitress and Norm asked me what was wrong with it...Sorry Norm, I didn't have the time. Just look up a better recipe. He said he would have offered to exchange my order out but honestly, if your cooks can not prepare a simple dish of a tortilla, beans, eggs, and salsa and maybe some cheese, I can not take the chance. All in all, I'm glad I am the minority of this place.",r_ZvSwesh0rBiXsmO-xB4Q,2,0,1,AmiZGapXprW_9DmnUlM2Ew

The staff is very friendly and the menu items looked enticing. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes since many reviews stated that it was one of their better dishes. Well, it was ok. I have tasted better. It tasted like a cream cheese pancake. My boyfriend ordered the Belgium Waffles and he asked if he could get strawberries on top or even strawberry syrup. They stated that they did not have fruits or fruit flavored syrup. This was rather astonishing to discover. His waffles were soggy inside and out. A Belgium waffle should be hard or crunchy I should say on the outside, and soft on the inside.

                Lemon ricotta pancakes had a nice aroma of lemons and was garnished with lemon zest ,I wish it had a stronger lemon presence flavor wise, the ricotta cheese did not add anything positive in my opinion, to me it just made the pancakes seem like it was under cooked.

Everything was really good. I had my reservations going in about getting lox at a strip mall breakfast joint but walked away full and pleasantly surprised. It came with everything you want; soft toasted bagel, smooth cream cheese, red onions, capers, tomatoes and of course the smoked salmon. It was sliced a little thicker that I would have liked but it was tasty and tender. I just really wanted bagels and lox, and I couldn't go to Bagel Café because the first and only time I went there I got horribly sick from a knish of all things. Throwing up a knish makes it hard to want to make a return visit.

My wife's steak and eggs plate was good for the cost. Eggs were scrambled and dry just the way she likes them. Steak was a bit overcooked but had good charbroiled flavor.

Finally a word or two about the hash browns. I love hash browns! Brown and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. That's tender yet firm on the inside, not mushy. I got a side order of hash brown. If you refer to my review of Baby Cakes you'll see how important hash browns are to my breakfast dining experience. For $1.75 I was given a large portion. A large, yummy, satisfying portion of perfectly cook shredded potatoes.

I noticed a lot of sub-par reviews mentioned the slow service. On our visit service was excellent. Food was delivered in a timely manner and my water glass was always filled at just the right time.",_8qu8GfnQCv0yae2i-OU5A,2,0,4,r8OYW1joygJPTvOFDUqq6Q

the food - Norm's comes up short again.  The CFS - small and overcooked.  the gravy was decent though i prefer to see chunks of meat in the gravy.  the biscuit crumbled as i cut it - that's not good.  GF did like the veggie omelet but the bagel wasn't fresh.

The first issue I had was the coffee mug brought to me had a coffee stain on it that was not cleaned in the dishwasher.  i believe that the mug itself was sanitized, (or at least I really want to believe that it was), but i sent it back because I was uncomfortable with the implications regarding germs.  the server was fast and took the mug without any objection.  

I tend to love knowing my servers name, but I never got the chance to ask because I had 3 different people wait on me.  it was an interesting take on the industry standard, but not none necessarily good or bad.  just interesting.  i wonder if this is the way that Norm's does it.  It does beg the question of tips: do they pool?  

I got the italian omelet which came with toast.  It was tasty and I finished the plate, but one piece of toast had a small thick gray hair on it.  at this point I did not complain. My concern was that i didn't want the server to think I was trying to get something for free and I guess I could afford to be a little less picky...

 I won't go back here because of the hair and stain, but i wouldn't say no if someone offered to pay for bfast.

My hubby convinced me not to ask about it, since we already had such huge breakfasts. I still felt like ""ya,but dammit, I'm paying for it."" I was full, even after the shortage of hash browns, and I had to take pancakes home i was so stuffed.

Another friend ordered something that was a little too spicy, and with a lot of hesitation sent it back for something else. If you've watched Waiting or work in food service it's obvious why the hesitation. So they sent her out something so hot it burned her mouth and the workers in the kitchen were watching her and laughed to themselves. I know that may sound a little dramatic, but both my other friend and I saw it happen and I had to hold him back from going back there and laying someone out. The waitress actually had to apologize to us about the behavior of their staff.

Norm's Eggs Cafe is a spot for those who appreciate a simple, pleasant experience.
The place is small and cozy. the menu is simple and this lends to the other qualities they exhibit. Because the menu is basic, the prices are low and the food is prepared quickly and consistently :) From a management standpoint, they must have considered all the things that make bigger places crappy and said ""NOPE! Let's keep it simple""

The floor space and tables are open, 2 of the walls are full windows, allowing in loads of natural light (and the building faces South East... Great for us, terrible for your vampire friends). Also, the cooking area is open, so you can see everything. 

Service: When you open the door, everyone working says ""Hello"" and ""Good morning"". My coffee was yummy, not gourmet, but not walmart brand. And the cup was never empty. Our server, Allison, was very friendly, helpful and patient with us.

Food: Blueberry pancakes, 2 eggs over medium, bacon and some hash-browns, which were crispy brown on top. The potions were reasonable, as in, I actually ate most of what I was given and didn't feel like a damn pig

This is a place for those who like the old time feel. It reminds me of my favorite dinners in the North-East and the Mid-West.

The lemon ricotta pancakes although not good for the diet, taste terrific. The creamy ricotta oozes out of every bite. The sweetness, cut by the hint of lemon. The banana pancakes are not pancakes with bananas on top. The bananas are cooked right in the batter creating an unmatched sweetness. The nuts give it a bit of a crunch.

Driving on Durango, you cant help but notice their big sign stating that they have the best Eggs Benedict. Since my wife loved Eggs Benedict, we stopped off one sunday morning at 9 am to check it out. 

The menus they give you have breakfast on one side and lunch on the other. You can order anything on either side at any time.

So my wifey went with the Eggs Benedict ($8.95), my son went with the Club Sandwich ($8.95), and I went with the Barbeque Bacon Burger ($8.50).

The Eggs Benedict were ok. Nothing really wowed me about it and my wife agreed. The Club Sandwich on sourdough was not bad either. My son said he has had better Club Sandwiches at least two other places. As for my Barbeque Bacon Burger, it was on point meaning that it was really good. You get a half pound patty cooked to your liking (I got it medium rare which they cooked  perfect), lettuce, tomatoes, barbeque sauce and of course, bacon. It was a very good burger. Matter of fact I was not hungry again until dinner time that evening.

Service was hit and miss. We got sat down right away. Got our orders in a timely manner and refills on water were constant. What bothered me was that when I asked for the check, our server said she would be right back with it. 10 minutes later we havent heard from her. So we decided to go straight to the cash register to pay.

Overall, for a breakfast joint, everything seemed to average out to about 9 to 10 bucks a plate. I was not impressed at all with their Eggs Benedict. I'm not in any rush to come back here any time soon.

Today I got the steak and eggs that comes with hash browns and toast. This is my default meal when I eat here. For a little over $9 this meal is worth it. It's filling and it tastes great! Surprisingly, their toast is also really good. 

To be honest, I only get this meal so I can't really review on other dishes. This rating is based in their steak and eggs, Norm the owner, and the staff.",2Z29fLaeLtGnNroTuHyJ2A,1,1,5,ZygfWv4A6czHg7Ok4brvbQ

What sums this place up is the fact that my plate was literally clean by the time the server came to clear the table.  'Nuff said.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,4,VoQTRN5jyTI-fYsJodoIcA

I feel it could use some cozy decorations and definetely needs some seats for customers who need to wait to be seated; like my party had to. There was a huge party of about 18 people, which I'm sure they weren't expecting. So, understandably the service was very slow. The food was fine; nothing spectacular. It could have been hotter when brought out to the table, but I know I'm particular about that. I will give them one more shot becauase they were understaffed due to the large unexpected party. However, if I come back and one of the cooks, who happens to be the owner, is not wearing a cap while he's cooking as the health code in NV requires, I will never come back. The code is their to  prevent hair 
and sweat falling into the food being prepared and that is just gross!",zZXh1s2aAZHESIy1UYpuig,1,1,2,y6U9UXW2NoZHk15ZxSlIHg

Finally got there and ordered and was told 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I was given my red velvet pancakes and was headed back to my grandmas. They didn't put any butter in the bag, only 2 containers of the ""cream cheese frosting"". The actual pancakes were good, but I had to eat them dry because the ""frosting"" tasted like melted whipped cream so it was very bland. 

Maybe other stuff is better? Next time I'll try somewhere else!",3vt7CVf2BGd8LJK28qnf1w,2,0,1,Dn--5JDeSeDetq5AafZ6_g
3251205,2013-05-28,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"We needed to go to Desert Breeze Park but it was 10:30am and we were starving.  I've passed by Norm's Eggs Cafe before and seeing the crowded parking lot...we decided to give it a shot.  

We walked in at the first thing I noticed were the open doors and the fact that the A/C wasn't on.  I was about to leave and asked the owner (I believe this was Norm) whether the A/C was broken.  He said he would turn it on and he did.  

Our family of five ordered:  Red Velvet Pancakes, Corned Beef Hash, Southern Fried Chicken, and Heuvos Rancheros.  The prices here are very reasonable with everything under $10.  

The Red Velvet Pancakes were excellent.  I prefer Baby Cakes but these were very tasty.

The Corn Beef Hash was excellent.  Homemade hash and very well done.  

The Southern Fried Chicken was okay,  The meat was a little tough.  The hash brown portion a little small.  The biscuit was a little dry.

The Huevos Rancheros were pretty flavorful and tasty.  

Service was really good.  Prices were great.  I would return if we were in the area.

Thanks Norm!",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,1,1,4,mBSQzuWiLzzsJ-f7WGYRcg
3255608,2013-10-26,1,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Gross. 
My son had soccer games across the street. Between games we decided to grab brunch. Norm's was so close we figured it was the best bet. 

The place was packed which I took as a good sign. However we were seated at a small, dirty table that I soon realized had small ants crawling on it. There was nowhere else for us to move. I killed the tiny ants, and noticed many were on the window pane next to us. But, yeah, who wants to eat with ants crawling around? 

So, then our order comes and my son goes to pick up his fork which he realizes is crusted in old food. We asked for a new fork, no big deal. But it just makes you start to wonder. 

My son said his pancakes were fine. Nothing special but not bad. I had a basil omelet. Basil is the last thing I'd call bland and yet, my omelet had zero flavor. I could see the basil leaves cooked right in there and yet there was no taste at all. The latte I ordered was terrible too. 

It was not a good experience and, mostly due to cleanliness, we will not be back.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,7,1,1,P0Uz_DMKj7n06WU-caKnpg

3285634,2012-06-04,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"So I went out today to go eat at another restaurant but it was closed. So I defaulted to Norm's. 

The service was good. But I don't go to a restaurant only for the service. If a restaurant has really good food and the service isn't really good I will still go to the restaurant. 

I ordered the chicken fried steak. It was that good. Had a good portion of steak but it wasn't really good. Pretty bland tasting. The eggs were under cooked to my liking. The hashbrowns were okay. Nothing amazing. They don't have a very large selection.

The prices are okay but they add up quick when you add cheese to your omelet or cream cheese to your bagel. I did not get those but my friend did get the omelet and a bagel. He didn't add cheese to his omelet but he did get a side of cream cheese for his bagel and I think it was over a dollar.

The restaurant was clean though. That is a plus. I probably wouldn't be coming back here or really recommend it to my friends.",gvseieQ-NpW_YobHGQo3FQ,0,0,2,8ip7iZIsg2dU92Iqm6HFIA

The food is fantastic! Like any place, they do occasionally change cooks, so some of the reviews are outdated. Currently they have an excellent cook, and IF anything is ever wrong, bring it to Norms attention, believe me, he will make it right. She always gets the Eggs Benedict and I'm stuck between the French Toast and Omelets. You really can't go wrong. I would recommend the breakfast potatoes. They have counter space and tables with big windows looking at Dessert Breeze Park. We haven't told the kids about this place yet (6 years) it's our little getaway while they are in school.

3398091,2014-02-07,1,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"I enjoy Norm's Eggs Cafe as one of those places that never really lets you down. The food is always on par no matter what you order, the service is always quick and pleasant, and the place always seems to have an available table.

I have visited several times and have ordered various high-protein entrees and breakfast items such as the Chicken Fried Steak and the Steak and Eggs meal.

The highlight of the $7.99 Chicken Fried Steak is the gravy. I love gravy. I love all types of gravy. But the gravy here at Norm's is phenomenal! The chicken fried steak itself is served with two eggs cooked to your liking, homemade biscuits, and choice of potato or fruit.

The $8.95 Steak and Eggs meal was pretty cut and dry. I typically order my steaks medium rare as I have learned there is more potential for flavor this way. It came out a little too done, which is fine as I am not as picky as most eaters. It was a bit dry and a bit tough to cut through and I was thankful the server had brought me a steak knife and some A1 sauce. The steak itself was 8 oz., and came with two eggs, choice of potato or fruit, and also toast.

All in all, my experiences here were okay. I'd much rather frequent Norm's than an IHOP or a Denny's when it comes to breakfast type food. Also, be sure to give their $3.99 breakfast menu a peak! Not too shabby.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,2,2,3,khazgNlDgbOAnj9IA-ksvA

I was looking for a decent diner style breakfast with friendly service. Unfortunately they didn't deliver.  The menu does have a good variety of choices.  Since I was heading out on a road trip with friends I to decided to play it safe and order the Lumberjack. The meat was what I would expect an elementary school to serve. It was very small and rubbery like it was microwaved. The biscuit and gravy was so terrible that I only managed 1 bite. The waitress never gave us refills on our drinks. We stopped another server and asked for refills, she said she would get our waitress. She never showed until she dropped off a group check at the end without stopping as she was waking (never asking if  we were paying together). When we got to the register, they had trouble separating the check. We were told we should have informed our waitress so 'it wouldn't take so long.'

3514804,2011-12-20,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Spacious new breakfast and lunch spot off of Durango. Friendly, quick service with plenty of tables and counter service.

Red velvet pancakes ($6.99) - rich, dense, chocolatey pancakes covered in a lattice work of cream cheese icing. The cakey texture will make you think you're eating a dessert for breakfast. It's delicious and worth the calories, but you'll fee guilty afterwards.

Steak ""Ooh-La-La"" ($6.50) - thinly sliced grilled steak covered with sauteed mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, and mozzarella on a toasted bun. Roughly a 6"" sub, the bread was chewy, fresh, lightly toasted to give the interior some crunch. good amount of ingredients in the sammie. The meat, mushrooms and onions were slightly overcooked but still tasty. Came with plenty of fries (probably frozen) and cole slaw. Good value for the price.

Their menu consists of plenty of breakfast items (many which are typical and can be found elsewhere), salads, soups, burgers, wraps, and sandwiches. They also have $5.99 lunch specials like meat loaf, pot roast, chicken curry and teriyaki chicken.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,6,2,4,_5eEehkC_iSjs8LZFD8U5g

3565919,2013-02-26,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"EDIT- I just found this draft I forgot to post. I went here back in mid-June, just for the record. 

Thanks for ruining my morning, Norm's Eggs Cafe!! The place is bright and clean, the people were friendly, and the wifi was free. I ordered their  big breakfast combination from a fairly simple menu. Also a cup of black coffee and a diet coke. The soda came in a can , and the coffee was hot and pretty good. I got my food and it looked pretty good too! The pancakes were decent, nothing spectacular but pancakes are pretty good no matter what right? I had ordered my eggs over medium, but I don't really think they were cooked quite enough. These things weren't a very big deal, but I then noticed my hash browns were swimming in grease. So was my sausage, and on closer inspection , so were the eggs. I don't mind a little grease because we all know that makes things taste better! But if you feel it congealing in your throat with every bite maybe it's time to rethink your cooking technique.

I would have nicely ask them to remake my food, except nobody ever bothered to come check on me. Not 1 refill of my coffee despite sitting at the bar directly in front of a full coffee pot. Not 1 reappearance of my waiter to see how things were even though my food was untouched. Twice, I thought someone was going to check on me, but it turned out they were just taking their break at the bar a few seats down from me. How nice that their food was cooked as they liked and their cups were full!   finally some lady came over and asked how everything was. I told her it was too greasy for me to eat. Her honest to god response? ""Next time, tell the cook to make it with less grease.""

Well if you have to tell the cook how to make food edible, and you can't get a warm up on your coffee, what is the point of even eating breakfast here?? If you have an answer for that, maybe this place is for you. But if you would rather not start your day angry you just dropped $12  on inedible crap , a single cup of coffee, and a can of soda , just don't bother with this place",8GBBchIXlyiarcPilI59pg,3,0,1,-uVGYiRxNG2o0HpADqewzQ

For our breakfasts, I had the lemon ricotta pancakes with sautéed apples.  The pancakes very light and they had just enough of lemon flavor with the ricotta so as not to be too lemony.  I used some syrup.  I think if I have this again, I might get the cream cheese icing they use with the red velvet pancakes.  it would be a nice combination.

My wife had a spinach omelette with cheddar cheese.  They offer hash browns or fruit and she got the fruit.  A very nice cup of fresh fruit.  They also give you a choice of toast or bagel.  Having a bagel instead of toast is not a common choice.  She opted for wheat toast.

We enjoyed everything very much.  Norm brought the orders to the table and chatted with us for awhile.  He asked for any suggestions, comments, or complaints.

I wanted blueberry pancakes and I saw the prices and I was like I can't beat that! So we decided to come here on a Saturday morning around 10 am? Anyways, this lady sat a whole bunch of us at the bar which was probably not the best idea since she was also our server. She ended up taking orders from the different groups (there was 4 different groups at the bar) not in the order from which we came in so it probably took a good 15-20 minutes before she took our order. 

I ended up with the blueberry pancake special and the husband ordered the loco moco special ($5.99). My breakfast was pretty big, 3 turkey bacon (yes, you can ask for a substitute), 2 eggs, hashbrowns and 3 pancakes. The pancakes were pretty good, the blueberries were fresh but I just wished there was more blueberries in the pancake itself. Hashbrowns were not fully cooked so they didn't taste right. Other than that everything was ok, but I think what makes up for it is the price. Breakfast should not be more than 20 bucks for 2 people.

I've also had the grilled veggie hash, which was loaded with eggplant, onion, green onion, & potatoes. But not seasoned well at all. I drowned it in hot sauce and ketchup. My boyfriend's loco moco was just that. Rice, patty, & brown gravy. Nothing amazing.

Maybe it'd be a good idea to modify my new years resolution and add 'try more breakfast places' because I can't bear the thought of having missed this & many other brekkie gems all these years. Plus, it gives me a good excuse to bike it up and hit Desert Breeze Park for a walk before I head here, all famished!

My mom, who raised me on traditional values, has never been one to eat out for breakfast. The whole logic of which has mainly been 'if we can make our own breakfast, why pay a fortune just to have someone else make the same thing?' but then again, for someone who's always on the lookout for something new, I convinced her to try the Red Velvet Pancakes at Norms Eggs with me. Now she's absolutely spellbound and pulled ME out of bed yesterday to head there! 

What I love most about the cafe is the warm smiles that greet us every time we go through the doors. Mommy, too, found our server, Teresa, very endearing. We would be checked up on every so often during our meal and for awhile, Teresa paused for a delightful conversation with us. We shared a short stack of red velvet pancakes with a drizzle of light cream cheese syrup and got a pair of sunnyside-up eggs, house fries & toast from the breakfast special.

It was available everywhere we had breakfast and brunch, and surprisingly that has been one of the things I miss since coming back home.  Doing a quick search for breakfast places that served lox, Norm's Eggs Cafe came up.

With salmon on my mind, I ordered the Lox and Cream Cheese Scramble.  It comes with a choice of toast or bagel, and hash browns or fruit.  I opted for rye toast and hash browns.  The scramble comes out exactly as you would envision, lots of salmon in every bite and quite the generous portion of cream cheese mixed in.  After finishing my meal, everything was cleaned off the plate except for the cream cheese; there was that much mixed in!  The salmon had a great smoked flavor and was also portioned generously.  Every bite had salmon, they did not skimp on it.  

Hash browns and toast were standard fare.  Potatoes were nice and crispy on top and softer on the bottom layer, and pleasantly not soaked in grease.  The toast was toast, can't go wrong with that!  The menu did state that the scramble was made with three eggs, but to me the portion seemed a bit small.  Maybe I'm used to the heaping portions served at other restaurants, but the entree size here had me wishing for more.  Overall a nice spot to grab breakfast, and definitely not as crowded as other breakfast options during the weekend.

Basically, the food is not very good.  It's NOT bad...but it's not even average for a breakfast place.

I had country fried steak and eggs.  The eggs were too runny (ordered over medium) and the CFS was just bad.  Bland, tough, and the gravy served on top was really thick and useless.  It was small, too.  Came with a biscuit -  bland, chewy, and dense.  

I'm not accusing the folks who run Norms of successfully manipulating people into giving it a high rating.  I have no proof of that.  But, yeah, that's what they did.  I'd bet plenty of dough on it.  Good for them, I guess.

There's literally 30+ places within 10 minute drive from here that are loads better for breakfast.  And the price isn't really cheap, either.  Looks like they raised prices above what they used to be.

The simple little restaurant wasn't overly decorated and was just simple.  It's definitely how I like it.  There is a lot of lighting and has an open feeling to it.  The menu is also above the cashier and you're also given one when seated.  Immediately when entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the servers and owner with happy smiles.  It gives a lasting impression.

The first time I came here I ordered Corned Beef Hash which is prepared with diced corned beef, potatoes, and onions served with eggs, and toast.  With this order, I also asked for a side of rice.  When I got home to dig in to my breakfast, I was disappointed because I had made sure to ask for jelly and butter and ketchup.  There was none in my to go bag.  There's no failure to corned beef hash especially when eaten with rice.  So, the tastes and flavors were expected and nothing special to it.  

The second time I came here was with my step dad and ate in the restaurant with him.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros prepared with corn tortillas layered with beans, two fried eggs, and topped with melted cheese and ranchero sauce.  This was phenomenal.  The crunch of the corn tortilla mixed with the other ingredients together was like heaven in my mouth.  when adding the salsa, it makes it even better.  I would come back for this over and over again.

The third time I was here was just this past Sunday with my boyfriend.  I ordered Steak and Eggs, an 8oz. sirloin steak served with two eggs, and fruit, and toast.  I had asked for medium steak with pink in the middle and over medium eggs.  When ordering eggs, it's very rare I get them ever right.  Like all the other restaurants, I got over easy eggs which ran all over my plate.  I think I'm going to have to ask for over hard to get over medium next time around.  As for my steak, it was well done.  The texture of the steak was very rubbery and chewy.  I might as well have bought beef jerky.  My boyfriend asked for scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, potato hash, and toast.  He said his eggs had a weird taste to them, the potato hash was bland and needed seasoning.  He barely touched his bacon but found the sausages very tasty.

The great thing I can say about this little mom and pop breakfast place is their servers.  They're very knowledgeable, attentive, and courteous.  When I ask them what they recommend, they are quick to give me one.  Thus knowing what the food taste like is apparent and that's very important.  On Sunday, when our server asked us how our food was, I couldn't hold it in and just had to tell him my experience.  I was expecting something of a defensive reaction but instead, he suggested he gave us a discount.  I have a hard time being a douche about it because to me, I ordered the food and ate some of it.  So, I should still pay for it, unless it was that disgusting.  In this case, it wasn't at that point.  He also suggested we wrote in their comment card, which we did.  I was delighted our server was willing to hear our opinion and was ready to make sure it doesn't happen again in future.

I was tossing back and forth on whether I should give two stars or three stars.  The only reason why I chose to give three stars is because their service was very exceptional.  The food just needs a little more love to it.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,0,3,8qtEWHDmfbSScPAYDM24SA
5199100,2012-01-16,11,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Shucks, Norm, I think we may have caught you on a bad day. We heard from a waitress that there was a new cook in the kitchen, and perhaps our experience was a byproduct of this. 

The good: Breakfast is cheap. The bill for two was a little over $13. 

However, starting with the menu, the cafe did not impress us on a Saturday morning. I am an omelet eater, and the omelet selection was limited to very average ingredients: spinach, mushroom, ham, bacon, green peppers and the like. Call me spoiled, but I really love to see fancy-named omelets with inventive twists. I decided to go with the Veggie. It took over 30-minutes to receive our order, and the food we received was standard fare. The omelet was on the smaller side, and the ingredients were not generous enough. It tasted like well-done eggs, not like a bounty of veggies and cheese. The hashbrowns were simply hashbrowns. 

The limited selection (although I am intrigued by their lunch time curry), food quality and slow execution left us disappointed. Maybe the secret is to stick to the pancakes!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,21,12,2,q_1u33fcU-GsxCgOQRdhkQ
5240065,2012-03-21,0,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"This was my first time at Norm's Eggs Cafe with my family. It was my husband's idea and we had checked out the menu before actually stepping foot into the place. The menu looked good and the prices were reasonable, so we went for it. Unfortunately, the food wasn't that great. My husband's Chicken Curry was slightly bland and the rice was tough and sticky. My Loco Moco lacked flavor, the overhard egg was runny in the middle and the hamburger was hard and crunchy. The kids were satisfied with their Denver Omelettes, Cheese Omelet and Chicken Caesar Wrap. But, the kicker was that soft drinks were served by the can with a glass full of ice at 1.25 each. I had a case of pop in the car, and I was so tempted to tell the kids if they wanted refills, they better go to the car. This will probably be my last visit. I do have one positive thing, the coffee was pretty good.",9lHdlh1H0LGx_JRRzYZeZA,0,0,2,f-yNx1ZqujS-ZYuLGQ4OUQ

I ordered a couple of items but I thought they tasted okay, nothing to rave about. The hash brown potatoes tasted a little bit off and the sunny side up eggs were a bit too well done.

Their salad looks a bit sad as well. Maybe this is just not the place for me.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,5,5,3,CIa90lRsjgBTc0QgyudmqA

Located on South Durango and open from 6am until 3pm seven days a week Norm's Eggs Café had long been on my breakfast 'to-do' list and with a morning half-marathon of miles already under my feet it was just after the small storefront opened that I arrived on Saturday, a smiley young server setting tables while Norm himself manned the oven and stove.  Every bit the quaint space its name would imply with exposed brick, worn wood, and a kitchen-side bar wrapped around a well-culled menu of classics from breakfast and lunch it was admittedly with carbs on my mind that I approached an order and eschewing a few interesting specials in favor of a trio of griddled goods the results were mostly what one would expect - as tasty and well made as what a skilled home cook could make but without all the prep-work and cleanup hassles involved.  Beginning first with French Toast before progressing to pancakes I will simply say that for my tastes the former was a bit too 'bready' but more than making up for it were the flapjacks, both styles proving delightful with unexpected levels of fluffiness despite thinly spread batter and each well paired with subtly sweetened cream cheese frosting flooding the red velvet while pockets of fresh banana dotted the nut-strewn buttermilk, neither really necessitating a bit of the unfortunately artificial maple syrup...though with an out-the-door tab under $20 I'm not sure it would be fair to expect the real deal.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,3,kRYKK6AqapzZZb0-h27Vrg

Menu satisfies an ""American"" breakfast and lunch. A good selection of various cravings. Seating appears fairly limited; a dozen tables and counter/bar. Portions are good, not too little nor too much.

The service was great, but then there was only one other table.  We got the red velvet pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  I love the idea of a sweet cream cheese frosting.  I do agree with my husband, the lemon ricotta needed a little bit more lemon flavor but overall, it was good.

The menu is simple and has some interesting lunch items.  I think it's worth a trip back to check it out.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,2,0,4,xWQn8svAsbl3G7oQ6qp2RQ

5600046,2012-01-17,3,YkAcruXbhN6sHDXn0jcySw,"Norm... I must be Frank.

Sometimes, if I have high expectations for a place I do tend to be hypercritical.  Of course, like most reviews this is an assessment of weighted compensating factors.  It wasn't bad but I was expecting more.  If you are a breakfast place only - breakfast better be good!

The place inside is more like a sandwich shop.  It is plain - not quite stark - but close.  I want a breakfast place to be warm and inviting.  If it is not warm and inviting, then I want bistro style... something.  There was literally no atmosphere here.

The service was okay.  The kid was trying hard but he seemed uncomfortable.  I always thought serving tables at a breakfast place required zero talent but I realized that there is some level of ability to do this.  

The Food; chicken fried steak, basted eggs, taters.  The chicken fried steak was tough.  It was okay to eat but it was tough and it lacked seasoning.  The basted eggs were sub par - I want NO color on my basted eggs!  Turn the heat down.  The taters were good.  The portions and the prices were good - some value here.

The chicken fried steak was supposed to come with biscuits, but they were out.  I actually didn't mind this, because it was later in the day which tells me they make the biscuits fresh every day. 

I do appreciate the fact that this place was trying to be a quality homemade type of breakfast place.  This does cary weight in my review.  I would go back, for a second chance.  I just wanted more.  
 
** side note.  I saw the owner leave.  He got in his car that was parked right up front.  I hate that.  Why would you tie up a customer's parking spot?  Oy-veh!",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,4,2,3,BS7ldXimZ1MiuIKuSTt2Wg

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted right away and were told to sit down at any table. It's a small cafe, but very clean and the employees were friendly.

I ordered the corned beef hash, which was pretty horrible. Most of it was burnt and it just did not taste good overall. Honestly, buying corned beef hash in a can from the grocery store and making it myself would have been more delicious! After I took a few bites and stopped, our server came back with a plate of hash browns and said ""sorry, the cook forgot to put this underneath your corned beef hash."" I don't know how you can screw up hash browns, but they were very bland, even with a lot of ketchup! My meal was also supposed to come with a side of fruit, but I never got it. Oh boy, strike 3!

My husband ordered the loco moco and said it was alright. He was disappointed because it was supposed to come with rice, but instead they put hash browns!? If they didn't have rice available for some reason, they should at least let us know! 

Our bill was $14, which wasn't bad. But I thought the food was just horrible. I also think they need to be more organized to avoid all the careless mistakes they have been making. Sorry Norm, I won't be back!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,0,2,cEOuyjnf0QmhFLgkvR_Lkw
