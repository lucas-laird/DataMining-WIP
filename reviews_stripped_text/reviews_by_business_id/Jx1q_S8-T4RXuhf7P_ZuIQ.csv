It really is from word of mouth, quite exclusive from the public eye. Once you find this place, it looks closed.. again, think exclusive. Don't be intimidated to open the door, you'll feel like you're at a house party without the stress of finding a spot to throw it at. 

I've been putting off of coming here for some time due to work and life events, but once I did stop by I've been coming back every week since! The owners are welcoming, kind, and extremely accommodating. THANK YOU for Everything. Hospitality at its best! One of the reasons why I love coming here. Great vibe, spacious venue, music... the music is heartfelt. Soul driven.. nobody needs to tell you to ""get up and dance"" you just pop up and do it. This place makes you feel at home. An undeniable comfort for music lovers. There are not many places where you can truly appreciate the culture that the owners of this Ultra Lounge brings.

This Ultra Lounge emphasizes more strongly on the different Hip Hop genres versus the infamous club music of trance and house music, which all of Vegas nightclubs are all about. I'm more about the Hip Hop Hooray than the acid beats of what in the heck is this?! If you like some general knowledge of what Hip Hop is... this is from the Global Awareness through Hip Hop Culture Program: 

""Hip Hop is the constantly evolving spirit and consciousness of urban youth that keeps recreating itself in a never-ending cycle. It is joy, sorrow, pleasure, pain, victory, defeat, anger, happiness, confusion, clarity, humor, intensity, dream, nightmare, life, death, and everything else in between. It is the spirit that connects the past to the present and lays a path towards the future.""

There are live performances from some amazing, talented artists on particular nights. Sometimes on Wednesday or Thursday nights, they even have special limited food menu from creative chefs from the Food Network shows. My favorite is Friday nights, which is Riddim in the Red. A mixture of Reggae, Dancehall, and Jawaiian. The energy here is intoxicating. The drink specials is a wonderful reason to replenish frequently ;) If you're hungry, they do provide a delicious food menu to go with your quench of thirst. 

The staff, itself is a dedicated team. All smiles and ready for the night. Any spills, empty beer bottles, finished dishes, you name it.. they are on it like flies on.. on.. well you know!? Quite attentive to guests needs and they know how to keep this place lookin' fresh and so clean. 

Love our server Nick though. His enthusiasm and fun-loving attitude makes you just beam with good spirits :D He brought over some Tequila shots and I told my friend as soon as Nick turned around.. drink it for me hurry!!! Then Nick turned out and said... I saw that! O.o My stunned face was priceless.. I told my friend.. omg he has eyes on his butt or what?! How did he know?!! :P Love you, Nick.

Ideal place for Birthday Celebrations and Holiday Get Togethers! Or just to unwind after a long week or night at work.

Love the fact that you can't smoke inside. Deal breaker :P DJs always spinning the greatest hits. I once danced for three hours straight here. The music was too good to sit down. My thighs and ribs paid a hefty price for it and took a week to recover. Reggae can have that effect on you. The dance floor can be wherever you are standing. Although, there is an open space near the dj booth, if you like to dance with the crowd. 

Seating wise, there are 6.. 3 individual sized tables with 2 leather booths side by side for large parties, 2 long tables with bench seating on each side in the middle, and 2 small tables in the middle with a big enough leather seat that can fit around 4 people. You can also have a seat at the bar, which has 4 stools. 

The volume of the music is loud enough to enjoy listening to, but also you can have a decent conversation without having to yell in each other's ear! I thought that was brilliant in their way in making it a place to drink, dine, talk, and dance. A marvelous combination that speaks for itself. And for me, that speaks volumes in the value and admiration of what they offer here. 

I have a tremendous amount of love and respect for this place. It takes so much out of me to get out of the house, because my home is my serenity. BUT this Ultra Lounge is an exception. This feel good music venue is something you can't get enough of and is a one of a kind addition to our community. I love supporting local businesses and this one is definitely on the top of my favorite list!",HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA,34,29,5,8NfRjEGh7uE3GzEPmDXSjA
3127384,2015-10-28,3,Jx1q_S8-T4RXuhf7P_ZuIQ,New and super Hip Bar Lounge. They always have something different going on. From live bands to decadent dishes. Many dancers come here to hang and just express themselves on the dance floor. Love coming here with friends and it is also a great place to celebrate birthdays as it is really cool and spacious.,SoiacX2r2mvHqIh3GgRMUw,5,5,5,l7V9-YfzLpsqdgw6vxdgng

Mixed drinks are $7 I believe I paid for, and budlights are $3. Not too shabby at all. And there's goood Asian restaurants around making it a good location to make a night out of. One of the owners JR is so sweet and down to earth too! Enjoyed my time here",fj-cFMD2qheCcv3FNvMcEg,0,1,4,BTHYoG8zYok7q6EZUmYq2Q

After the first round, you're gypped and ripped off on drinks. If the Health Department did a walk through, they'd be shut down anyway so this review is a preemptive strike to their impending doom. I'll wait it out. I won't leave any other negative commentary. They're burying themselves.",LeQEvE7FjxSVDxXRibfg5g,2,0,1,p83CAPktkUGhZM9bVIRBuQ

I went back there the next day which was Tuesday.
It was really busy..lot of people, loved the rappers, live music and very good vibe!! Drinks are affordable prices and one another thing about this place is you can get Sushi/munch with your drinks if you are hungry!
I like this place alot..very fun but casual so if you want to party but don't wanna go to strip then you should go there to have fun for good price!",oJaGizd-tV9_CEWGcKyukw,6,6,5,wEFkqU240njQ0Hd8acCAEA

5962522,2015-10-05,0,Jx1q_S8-T4RXuhf7P_ZuIQ,The music spinning by a live deejay on saturday nite was talented and charming. I was in town to visit family and had a great time. Drinks were fast and delish with a heavy hand pouring. The bartender was friendly and charming. Best part is i left my credit card and ID behind on the way to another bar and when we went this morning to see if the business was open (it was not) but employees opened the doors and gave my property back to me all within an hour. HUGE THUMBS UP! Thank you for the fun nite and excellent service.,2e19A9GaSfor4HQc0jxe4Q,1,1,5,XjuOBSsIphC4bjriYaTEpg
