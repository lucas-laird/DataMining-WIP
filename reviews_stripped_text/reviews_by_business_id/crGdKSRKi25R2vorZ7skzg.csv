Tortilleria San Diego is authentic home made fresh Mexican food that you simply just can't find anywhere else anymore.  My favorite happens to be the pork tamales perfectly wrapped in the corn husk and the macaroni salad.  I've also had the carnitas, rice, and beans, which all were delicious!

It was really special when they made a special delivery for my birthday last year when my wife got an order catered by them.  I got enough to feed 15-20 people and only paid about $200.00!!!  It was a huge hit too!  Wish I lived closer or it would be my second home!",u90s9wJ9pMK2FMpy5F8Wpg,4,2,5,RBp5TlJLc37YuarYXXxcTQ

Best in town. Even better than the ones people try to sell you out in the Northtown parking lots. . Go here! They are so warm and fresh on the daily at 8am.. Im not sure on pricing but you can get a large order discount. They also cater if you pick up. You cant go wrong with their mexican food.",-pCIK2f47lHXiAw-uiD-aQ,6,1,5,RB_v6LysaVISnzpAFXzYow
