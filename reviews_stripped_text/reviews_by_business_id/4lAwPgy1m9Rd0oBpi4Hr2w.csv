Rude, unprofessional and didn't even give me 20 seconds to order,  she asked me to step aside because she had other people that wanted to order. What all two of the customers? If you are in customer service,  learn how to treat customers accordingly. I get it that you hate your job, but don't take it out on me.",eU17zHGJOEMxIjY7Fn_7rA,1,0,1,QLukxZXgX6dUfwwERbD3xA

There are so many other places to eat around there that are about the same price and way better. Just saying.,Hmpmlv7v2mdaVYJYGFg9hw,0,0,2,SAFpDJLmeHs3m3fGxiYatw

The first time was because my friend and I felt that we had lost enough at the blackjack table, so we went to McD's to drown our sorrows in some milkshakes and McFlurries while practicing with a deck of card and some nickels.

The second time was because we hadn't eaten lunch, but we knew we wouldn't be able to make it until dinner :)  So we stopped really quickly for some fries...and more McFlurries ;)

The service isn't the quickest, but they are friendly and the food is good!  Stop in for a quick treat!",QR8XFFHYU-X0epXOrDbrXw,3,3,4,cNI_nDNw-aAScg0uNakaiw

Please don't expect much, Its just a McDonalds. Ya know,the kind of  place you go to before all the buffets open.That should help bring things back into better perspective. If this doesn't cut it, go a little further east(across the street), and spend $15 for a breakfast at Du pars if you need that sit down feeling.",jTX1ys0y0Gw-K5zXpfuzBA,1,1,4,zK2XqFHkzY-7TRAdy6hjDQ

While we were trying to finish out big order she kept rushing us which made us loose track of whose order it was on. Then she charged 2 same things when we just wanted one. There was too long of a line to try to get a refund but anyways. Customer service could be better.

I stopped in Friday night before the fireworks at the Plaza and got a shamrock shake.  There were two people at the register and the wait was short as things moved along quickly.  Their Apple pay works and I had my drink in good time.

Maybe the reason it hasn't been added into Yelp is because nobody wanted to remember or wanted to come back. The food itself is nothing spectacular and would fall under lower scale when comparing with other McDonald's locations. I would have given this place 3 stars if it wasn't for the manager/supervisor (the person overseeing the front counter and handling the food to customers.) Unlike the cashiers who are normally friendly, these so called supervisors are arrogant, rude, unfriendly, and sometimes incompetent. There have been a few times that they handed me wrong orders, which I only found out after I brought it back to the office. C'mon, how hard is it to give customers what they ordered??????

Easily the worst food experience I've ever had!!  Well, not surprising considering its McDonalds.

After a nice evening of gambling and enjoying Fremont Street, I decided on some food. Mind you, this was after multiple drinks. Thanks Jodi and Jenny. 

So, around 2am, there was about 12 people in line. Being a fan of the dollar menu, I was trying to decide on what to order, but the screen kept changing every 3 seconds which made it nearly impossible to decide.

By the time it was my turn, I still didn't know what I wanted. And the cashier was very rude and demanded I place my order (pointing to all the other people in line). I said, hold on, your menu changes so fast I can't decide what I want. She could care less and kept badgering me to hurry up and order. I finally ended up speaking to the manager, which of course was useless. 

In the end, I got my $1-2 items.  This shit is so bad, it couldn't pass for dog food. I'm surprised it's even legal to sell this horrible excuse for ""food"". But again, its McDonalds. What do you expect?",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,5,2,1,7b17XcKk6G86iuJ8QHUHjA
