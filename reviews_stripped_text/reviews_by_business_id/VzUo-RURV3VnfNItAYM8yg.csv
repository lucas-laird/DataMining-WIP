It taste like plain chocolate milk at first but then you taste the hints of taro and its an amazing concoction! My friend also had their wintermelon aka white gourd and it's the best one I've have in Vegas! Way better than the white gourd at Kung Fu imo.

I ordered their breakfast musubi and cake noodles, which to my delight was delicious. As a local from Hawaii, musubis' are no stranger to me and having tried a few hundred or so in my life, this one was surely unique. It had your usual spam and egg but it also came with candy bacon which I thought was interesting.

Aside from the usual flavors, what I found interesting was the customized concept.  You can pick from 4 different flavors of tea, then another flavor, then the kind of boba or jelly, then the percentage of sweetness...  you get the idea.  Or refer to the picture of the menu.

Anyway, whenever I'm confused or don't know what to order, I always ask the cashier what is the crowd favorite, and this place was no exception.  So in addition to my standard house milk tea, got the store favorite which according to cashier is the White Peach.  Ordered both with the standard honey boba at 75% sweetness.  Both drinks were amazingly good!  I could taste the ""teaness"" in both and whatever flavor they should be, and comes in a good size.  My only complaint is that there wasn't more boba in the cup and the fact that I didn't make use of the 10% off Yelp Check-in because once I'm in the store I forget all about offers.  Grrrrr..

When I go, I usually get Green Tea, with either Peach, Mango, or Watermelon, 75% or 100% sweetness, and I top it off with Honey Boba, Mango Jelly, or Egg Pudding. A minute or two after I sit down, my drink is quickly and politely served to me. I also went last night and it was my first time ordering their Loco Moco and I liked it because they cooked the egg just how I asked - over medium - and they are generous with the gravy.

I also had the white peach oolong teapresso no pearls and 50% sweetened. Glad I ordered 50% cause it was slightly sweet. It wasn't bad yet it made me wonder how sweet it was if I had ordered it regular. 

Tried their masubi spam & Portuguese sausage. Spam was great fair enough slice of spam but the Portuguese could use a bit more meat in my opinion. 

It was really quite and chill till the high school students was out of school then it got crowded. 
Restroom is really clean. Service was great. I would come back again and try other choices on their menu. They do offer a reward stamp card which is cool since I'd be back.

The pork belly moco is better than the moco loco but the servings are so small for the price and adding a scoop of rice is $1.25! Just for rice?

I usually have a terrible experience when I attend soft openings but today has been nothing but awesome. Being Asian, I think I'm programmed to be a boba critic and Boba Hut blew my mind. With their various tea selections, flavor add-ons, sweetness level adjustments and multiple toppings, you will definitely find something you like. 

I had the Lychee Black Teaspresso drink with Honey Boba and was in lychee heaven because they added lychee pieces! Also tried their Honeydew Slush w/ Lychee Jelly and it was super sweet. Probably my least fave but the boyfriend loved it. Haha. And finally the Hawaiian Slush w/ Honey Boba-- Pineapple & Mango slush w/ Li Hing Mui powder. Yes, fellow Hawaiians, you will be so pleased with this one. 

Onto the food: Delicious! Came out warm and very plentiful. They do half half combos. Had the Chicken Katsu & Kalua Pork while the other half had Chicken Katsu & Orange Chicken. Katsu was crispy and moist while Kalua pork was piping hot, with cabbage and just the right amount of salt. I typically don't like orange chicken but this one was lightly sauced so it wasn't overwhelmingly sour/sweet.

I got a White Grape Oolong Tea with honey boba and Peppermint Green Milk Tea with honey boba. The oolong tea is strong because they use a teapresso which is like espresso but for tea. The white grape flavor is good and light. The peppermint green milk tea is okay. It's not my cup of tea. The peppermint flavor is strong but that's probably because of the green tea. Their honey boba doesn't have much honey flavor and the texture was not good. I had to wait around 10 minutes, which was fine, but my expectations were disappointed.

CONCLUSION
I will be back to try different drinks and food.",SNHHpdXqxZFMBTTbKsBrAA,1,1,3,H8yBsL9Eev3ZvbM09yANjA

This is something I'm sure she will learn with more experience but I personally would have acknowledge first and ask the customer in front of me if it were ok I pass the group behind me a menu.

Place was very clean and neat..just simple marble tables and woodedn chairs..not much of a decoration yet because they have just opened 2 weeks ago but i see a potential of them making good business in this neighborhood specially when the place is next to Durango High School. 

Owner of the place was pretty young, haven't had the chance to talk to him about the place..Roldan is his name basing of the instagram they told me to follow.

A grand opening is happening on November 15th, they are giving free milk tea, a great way to start the place.

BBQ chicken - juicy, charbroiled perfectly. I would recommend
 
Orange Chicken - tangy, the breading and chicken ratio is equal amount. No Panda Express orange chicken lol. So if panda is your go to orange chicken, then this will disappoint. 

Popcorn chicken - delicious, breaded like Asian salt and pepper pork chops. Highly recommend!

Then I got the stir fried udon noodles....these were flavorful. Udon noodles stir fried with cabbage and onions.

It is a dry noodle dish but this time. . .there was still a little moisture so that the flavors really came through.  This was NOT the best drunken noodle that I have ever had. . .BUT it was pretty darn good.  (4/5)

Crunchy beef with a good orange glaze and proper seasoning. Last time it did not taste fresh.

She kept ringing those in while I just stood there. I'm not sure but to me in person customers should take precedence over an online iPad where the customer isn't even there. Moving on...

I ordered. The pork belly buns are amazing!!!! So good. Actually thinking about them now, LOL. Candy bacon spam masubi?!  It sounded so good when I read it on the menu. It was a bit sweet so I couldn't finish it all. They have other masubis on the menu that I want to try, so next time.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,12,5,4,sg7OuY0-o3-GjmO8uBxfyQ

2303962,2015-11-05,2,VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg,"Talk about more then Boba! All the recent Boba places opening around town and even been noticing existing restaurants now serving Boba. I just assume Boba Hut was another Boba place getting in on the mix. What I found out was a tiny family run restaurant that serves nice diversity of food, great great value for the price, most dishes under ten dollars, and good local food. 

The diversity of the menu. Half of the menu is local comfort food from 808 like chicken katsu, kalbi, and really most part see at any local Hawaii style restaurant. The other half has nice selection from typical Chinese dishes like Drunken Noodles, Chow Fun, and then asian fusion with the pork belly action done few different ways. Some traditional Taiwanese dishes. So if looking for asian comfort food Boba Hut has you covered pretty good. 

My first visit went with comfort food ordered the Kalua Pork with Cabbage. The Kalua Pork was Ono. It had nice salty taste, cooked perfect, nice portion of cabbage (nice big cuts sometimes see cabbage cut thin blends in with the pork), and had two scoops rice and mac salad. The Mac salad honestly ONLY thing that stopped me from giving it five stars. Mac Salad to be honest was one of the worst ones ever tasted. Mac Salad that huge part of any plate lunch. The thing I was not fan of was the mayo or dressing lacked flavor, seasoning, water down consistency, and not very good. I also ordered the Pork Belly Bun with Cilantro and Pineapple for appetizer. Talk about solid. Steam buns find it to be hit or miss. Usually been miss for me that it not come out hot or moist. Next thing know biting into hard outer crust steam bun, not moist on the inside or hot, and kills the whole dish. Right off the top the steam bun was nice moist, hot, no crust, and could eat dozen buns by itself. You add the grilled pork belly that tell marinade for while and the flavor was awesome. Fill it out with sprig of cilantro and pineapple. It add nice little sweet citrus and cilantro balance out soy based (just guessing the marinade) spot on. No doubt one appetizer will be ordering again.

Second visit want try one of the noodle dishes. I ordered the Drunken Noodle with Beef. I don't normally order Drunken Noodle so have no idea if authentic or not. All I do know it was very hearty. Good. Not just only noodles. Bean sprouts, onions, nice amount of sliced beef (not skimpy of the cuts), and think even eggs in it. One thing watch out if not fan of spicy. They add small thai peppers that sneaks up on you with the heat. Another dish would order again. 

I mention earlier nothing really over ten dollars. The value one dish is all you need and even then might end up with leftovers. Friday and Saturday it open late till midnight. I think is awesome. Most local places I know close at 10 so if looking for late night local food outside California. Great option. They do love yelpers. I had no idea until the cashier told me with your check-in on yelp get 10% off the bill. The s staff is awesome. Both times went cashier is friendly, attentive, and they remember my face second visit. Details. 

It in the same shopping complex as the Dickie barbecue. It tucked around the corner of the building so not as visible off rainbow.

My 5 star review is based on their food, price, and service (sorry, not a bubble tea drinker). I ALWAYS get their pork belly moco and leave satisfied.

After hearing about it, we came straight to Yelp to check out other menu items before heading over since it is across town from us. 

To our surprise they had food options too, wha-aat? 
Boba Hut is a Chinese & Hawaiian Fushion restaurant serving you appetizers like Crab Rangoon's, Potstickers, your typical Spam Masubi to Spam & Candy Bacon Masubi. You can also grab a Hawaiian Plate (katsu, Okonomiyaki Katsu, Loco Moco, kalua Pork etc) and they also have their Asian Plates/Bowls (Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef & Broccoli, Mongolian Beef, Cake Noodles, Chow Mein, Chow Fun etc), Saimen and Burgers too! Phew!!!!

We ordered the Crab Rangoon for an appetizer. We were super excited to see that they were HUGE compared to other places we've tried. The outside was Cooked to a golden brown perfection, the filling lacked a little flavor. Definitely missing the crab flavor and the ratio of filling to wonton considering they were larger than normal, could have been more. From the Hawaiian Plate Menu, we ordered a large Chicken Cutlet which comes with the gravy on the side, 2 scoops of rice and yes, Macaroni salad. The Cutlet had the perfect fry and color to it, nice light & crispy. The gravy was dark and thick with just the right amount of seasoning. Taste homemade like my grandma used to make it. The Mac (I'm not a Mac salad kinda gal, BUT I tried it! and for me, I tasted too much celery and onion, so that was no go for me.) and from the Asian Plates we ordered Mini Chicken Cake Noodle. The chicken itself was so flavorful, I could probably eat that on its own. The noodles were cut up into small square pieces which I assume for easier eating, usually it's fried down in one cluster. The cake noodle sauce was a little on the saltier side for my taste buds but otherwise tasted good. We also had to order an extra sauce b/c the amount they gave us was not enough to get all the noodles soft. 

Lastly, the Boba!!!! Since we ate in, I got a Peach Green Tea w/ 50% sweetness which I probably could have got 25% and would have been more than enough sweet for me. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian Slush ( Pineapple, Mango & Li Hong Mui) guess what? He really liked it!!! That says a lot when it comes to Boba drinks b/c there are few that he actually likes. 

P.S The true reason we stopped by was for the tartes. No where to be found? Maybe they get delivered on certain days? 

The rundown; overall 3/5 stars for Boba Hut. The food is good, there are items on the menu that you can definitely find at other Hawaiian restaurants in the valley but they do have quite a few different menu items that I'd come back to try. 

Customer service and menu knowledge is lacking. The first cashier when we asked, what was the Okonomiyaki Katsu, she couldn't tell us anything about it, had to grab the other girl who didn't really know herself. We were asked if we had Katsu and then asked if we had a different dish (I can't remember the name. which we never had?) and then said it has stuff on the top which we asked what kind of stuff? B/c we really didn't know and there was no description on the menu. She then proceeded to say oh mayo, seaweed and some sauce?? Okay? Maybe next time? Then considering we were the only ones in the place, it took quite a while for every thing to come out. I feel like they have some kinks to work out but once they do, I think that everything else will get better. So that's why I knocked off a star.

They're located right off Russell and Rainbow across from spring valley hospital, and parking is very abundant and easy.

I tried their mini chicken cake noodles which was extremely good, the chicken was tender and moist and very flavorful. Portions are also very generous for the price, I shared it with another person, and it was enough for both of us to get full off of.

For my drink, I got the grapefruit green tea with normal sweetness. It wasn't overly bitter at all and still was able to retain just enough sweet and sour flavor to be refreshing and enjoyable.

With boba, if not make the right way it wont taste or chewy the right way how boba should be. Saying that, their boba was made perfectly and to the right consistency! 
One thing special about this place is, that they ask you how sweet you want your drinks to be. So for those who don't drink much sugar or want alot of sugar in your drinks then here you go. I was not prepared for that but now I know for the next time lol

Sooo much local spirit here. Made me feel like home!!! The guy in front of me in line spoke with a very strong pigeon accent and the girl reminded me of so many of my friends from home: sweet, kinda and a huge smile. The brudda IZ was playing in the background 
We ordered the Hawaiian barbecue combo, the Kalua pork and rice, and of course the cake noodle. Cake noodle comes with either option of minute chicken or beef. Broccoli comes with either option. I got the beef.
The cake noodle was BOMB!!! I mean not as good as the ones in hawaii. But for being the ONLY ONLY ONLY place that makes it in Las Vegas, I know I will be eating this again. The BBQ plate was delish and the meat was cooked great: Combo of BBQ chicken, Kalbi and Shreaded Teri Beef. My hubby got the Kalua pork large plate: 2 scoops rice, 1 scoop mac salad, and lots of lots of kalua pork and cabbage- Def enough for 2 people. With a coupon from their flyer, we got 10 free malasadas- good but not as chewy as the ones from Lenoards. Still, fried 
sugary goodness. 
The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that the cake noodle did not have enough sauce even though I asked the girl before I left for lots of sauce. And the beef in the beef brocolli mixture was super super sweet. Regaurdless I still devoured the whole thing lol

Next time I need to try the boba. Sooo many options for hot/cold, black tea, oolong, green tea, peppermint tea. Boba has many flavors like honey, they have grass jellies and red bean as well as egg pudding. The drinks are around 3.50$ if u want milk tea of some sort, but the slushies which I love are an extra 0.50$. Why? Idk why? To blend my smoothie with some ice? Kinda absurd to me for an upcharge.

I will be back for the Cake noodle!!! And have been back at least 4x for the beef broccoli cake noodle.

Total tip: anything over 25% sweet is what would be considered ""normal"" at any other Asian boba place. So if you don't like sweet don't get over 25%",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,4,2,5,oo6GF-XnOwzoqLiUW1M8vQ

My girlfriend and I walked in Boba Hut and there was already people dining in. A good sign. Speaking of a sign, you couldn't help but to notice there was a huge logo of ""Boba Hut"" on the wall which was cool because it had pictures of customers who had been there. 

There was a foul smell but I'm guessing maybe the place was next to a sewer or something but it doesn't take from the 5 star review. 

The young lady at the desk was very helpful and helping us choose our boba. I ended up getting the ""Hawaiian Slush"" which had mangos, pineapple and some other yummy stuff in it. The most exciting part was the mango popping boba. You slurp it up and the flavored boba burst right in your mouth! Sooooo amazing! My girlfriend got the Black Tea Milk with egg pudding and honey boba which was also delicious. We also got the spam masubi candy spam masubi, the loco moco and the fried donuts. Everything was soooo orgasmic!!! We ended up spending $30 lol 

Overall, the food was yummy and the service was fast, friendly  and efficient. I definitely will be returning to try more Boba and I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone!",iK-PVJJX7tsXgFoTwSNUAQ,0,0,5,Ye5HTy0QLGnajGTIVjKQaA

I always order my tea with 25% sugar level but it always turns out to be really sweet (I can only imagine the 100%). I might try ordering with 0% next time and see how that turns out.  

The food here is pretty okay. I cannot totally speak for it altogether. I have not tried enough of their ""fusion"" food to judge it. We always ordered take out too. Even though, I believe that the quality of food should not suffer whether it be dine in or take outs - sometimes it just can't be helped. I will try eating there when I find the time.

I do love their Pork Belly Moco. It's very unique and very tasty. A little fatty but I sure that's what makes the dish taste that good. The chicken katsu is good too and so is their Pork Lau Lau and Kahlua Pork. I love Hawaiian food so I can be pretty bias.

Really hate to do this, but it's been over an hour and a half  since I left Boba Hut without my Fried Tofu after waiting 30+ minutes for the order to be filled.  When I called, the kid who answered knew exactly what I was talking about, but his solution was for me to load my toddler into the car and drive back to the restaurant for an appetizer that would be sitting under a heat lamp.

Sorry, that won't fly, not after a 14 hour day.  I suggested he could send it with one of the Uber Eats drivers who kept going in and out (3 while I was waiting, undoubtedly contributing to a long wait time, there was no one else in the restaurant) but for some reason that wasn't agreeable.  He took my name/number, said the charges would be reversed after he called the manager (not on property, I guess).

35 minutes later, and no response. I called back, he said the manager couldn't be reached.  Sorry, that's just piss poor business practices.  I told this poor kid I would have my CC cancel the trainsaction if I didn't hear from someone in 5 minutes...its been 35.

Maybe my reaction is a bit much, but that tofu is awesome.  Accidents happen, people make mistakes but you really stand out when you Own Up to it and make a person feel like you give a damn.

Enter Boba Hut. I did a quick yelp for places around the area and settled on this place. This was 3 days ago. I've eaten here 3 days in a row.

I ordered their Beef Chow Fun. It was delicious and authentic; so many places butcher it but this was one of the best ones I've had in a long time. There's so much meat and it's so tender. What was surprising was the affordable price. In Chinatown this dish will sell for $10.00 easy. But it's way cheaper here.

Next day I ordered their Saimin noodle soup and man oh man it was so delicious. A large helping of noodles in a perfectly flavored broth. 

Today I had their drunken noodles. As expected, it was bomb as fuuuuuudge.

Every day I get the typical Boba Milk Tea, I'm a classic dude, but they've got wicked different combinations of different teas and add-ins for some Boba variety.

Their service was genuinely nice and cheerful and very good.

They're a new business and I wish them great success because the food is amazing and so affordable.

First and foremost, I HAVE to stress this to you: if you have been here before and know what you want, you probably know to call in your order instead. The wait time from paying at the register and waiting for your food/drink is ridiculously long most of the time.

With that being said, tonight I did not have enough time to call ahead so I had no choice but to wait. I ordered my usual Oreo Oolong Milk Tea 100% sweetness (you have the option to keep your drink at its sweetest or lessen it) with no toppings, and 2 candied bacon spam musubis. At 9:03pm I paid, at 9:20pm I received my order. With no one ahead of me, I don't understand how that could take so long. 17 minutes.

I love coming here. It's close, I love my milk tea here, and they have tons of food choices. I just hate that it takes so long that I'm compelled to call my order in all the time. 

For every drink you purchase you get a stamp on a stamp card, after 10 stamps you get a free regular size/priced drink ($3.50 I think?). What bothered me today was that if you check in on FB you get 10% off but they began this new policy just this week it seems where if you check in on FB for the discount, you don't get the stamp on the stamp card. To me, that's stupid and doesn't make sense as those are two completely different things. 

Regardless of how long their food takes and the stupid policy they've implemented, this place is still my go-to boba place.",abzIJZ1HBSsCh3X7xUAZ0w,3,3,3,vAB5p0b4VG34qmrLbiLcJw

NO the packaging may not be the hyphest but that's ok because sometimes simple means your getting something of quality. I'm an avid iced coffee/mocha boba drinker and can't stand when boba places use NESQUIK as coffee or mocha. This was not the case for here. It's really real coffee guys not only is the drink itself oh so yummy, but so is the boba which is a major plus. Cause it seems that a lot of boba places forget that BOBA is the real star of the show and tend to over soak their balls in some sort of honey and sugar concoction which doesn't appeal to me at all lol. Not here, the honey and sweetness of the actual boba is very subtle and I enjoy it very much. 

Customer service is great and the food options sound appetizing too.


**EDIT**
So the last week of our stay in Vegas I made sure to come back here as often as I could. The drive from my in laws place is about 5 minutes so YASSSS I went there everyday for 5 days straight until we sadly left :( Anywho I ventured out of just ordering my usual bubble drink and got to try the loco moco, cake noodles, malasadas, and the pork belly loco moco. Guys out of all the Hawai'i like eateries I've tried there in Vegas, I'd have to say that Boba Hut is the closest you'll get.

I do want to start with that I grew up in HI and so when I'm searching for comfort food, I want what I had from the manapua truck or working in Honolulu. So I'm not being snooty about this, but if someone from HI is reading this, I just want to set realistic expectations.

I ordered chow fun which was typical of a Chinese restaurant, good, but not Hawaiian-style where you have the fish cake and char siu in it. I also had the crispy gau gee which was almost as good as the HI famous Waimalu Chop Suey, but not as thick.

While I was there, I loved the amount of order pick ups from Uber and GrubHub. So I know I'll be ordering from here because of the convenience.

FOR THE OWNER
Hope the owner or management still reviews Yelp because I have some helpful information for you:
1. It may be because it was lunch time, but I do have to say that the wait time was a little too long. I thought it was me, but I timed how long it took a woman and her child to get their lunch and it was over 10-minutes.
2. Pork Hash in HI is a large pork shumai! I made a mistake once at another Chinese restaurant and ordered pork hash. When it came out, it was just ground pork. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed. So when I asked your counter-help, she confirmed that the Pork Hash plate you have listed is ground pork patty. I kindly let the counter-help know, that in HI, when someone orders Pork Hash, it is pork shumai that we expect. 

If you can get the chow fun and the pork hash right, I would be so grateful.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,7,1,3,9RcgJyXqBVXlW7FbJwDHVQ

The only problem I had on my first drink was that it was a little bit too watery and I couldn't taste the oolongness of my drink. But my boyfriend ordered a thai tea, with boba, that was actually pretty good! I ended up just drinking his..

The second drink I got, was also oolong but I ordered it with no ice and @ 50% sweetness level. Again, the drink tasted too watery or what-not that made the taste of the oolong fade a little too much. (& They forgot that I had ordered no ice, but they corrected it YAY ty.) Then this time my boyfriend got the house milk tea @ 100% sweetness and it was reeeally good! The honeydew boba slush was eeeh.. I wouldn't order a slush here tbh.

Their menu isn't as extensive as other boba places, but they have a decent amount of options. It's pretty good boba and they seem to have ongoing specials.

But, the dish to get here is the pork belly moco. This thing is amazing! If you love pork belly as much as me, you need to stop what you're doing and head straight to Boba Hut. A large order is two scoops of rice with about 5 of 6 slices of sweet pork belly covered in a slightly spicy aioli and topped with two eggs cooked to order. Together it's sweet, spicy, savory goodness served with a side of mac salad.

If you want more pork, get the pork belly buns. An order is two buns, each with a slice of pork belly, pineapple, and cilantro. If you still have room after that, get some tarts for dessert. Made by Ono Sweetz 702, the assorted order of a dozen gives you a variety of Hawaiian flavors.

The drinks are amazing. Hubby ordered the honeydew slush and I opted for the strawberry slush with the strawberry/lychee popping balls. The best so far that we've tried. 

We also ordered some Hawaiian dishes. If you ever been to Hawaii, you definitely know how authentic local food taste like. I've been to plenty of places and only a few have actually tasted the same. 

We ordered the loco moco, the Hawaiian mixed plate, and spam musubi. This place was on point. Food tastes just like it would in Hawaii. I wish we had one of these back home. Vegas is a lucky place to have them. 

Service was very friendly and the wait time was minimal because things have to be cooked fresh. I ended the meal with red bean sesame balls. Wow.  Super pleased and will miss this place. Definitely will come back to them when I am in town.

Not a bad meal and drink for a little over $10. The Katsu was delicious, I have had this dish at plenty of other places and this one is my new favorite. They used very fresh and lean cuts of chicken, the breading was crunchy and the gravy (or sauce) was sweet and flavorful. The Tea was delicious as well, this was the first time i have ever tried lychee boba (recommended by the very polite girl at the counter) and it will definitely not be the last time I order this exact drink. The restaurant is super clean and tidy. Which I guess is to be expected with a location that just opened recently, but still, got to love a squeaky clean dining room.

SERVICE
A lot more welcoming than the last time. Unlike the attitude I got from a girl on my last visit, this guy at the counter was friendly and helpful in deciding which drink I should get. He personally handed the drink to me and told me I can make adjustments to my drink, which is something the girl never said in my last visit. 

DRINK/FOOD
Drinks I have tried so far:

Jasmine Milk Tea- 100% is too sweet for my liking but still my favorite out of all the drinks I have tried. 5/5

Whitegourd Green Milk Tea- ordered at 75% sweetness and added honey boba. Despite the ridiculously sweet taste of white gourd, I still tasted tea. I must say they brew some good teas here. 4/5

Coffee Milk Tea-100% sweetness was good. Strong black tea with few shots of espresso. Perfect for all-nighter. 4/5

White Peach Oolong Tea-just ok. I was surprised to see how much ice they put in this drink. Very subtle peach flavor and strong oolong tea. 3/5

White Grape Oolong Tea-pretty good! Very light grape flavor and tea flavor but refreshing. 100% sweetness was bit too sweet for me. Unique flavor that I haven't had in other places. 4/5

Cantaloupe Milk Tea-75% sweetness turned out to be too sweet once again. Similar to Honeydew Milk Tea, maybe a tad bit sweeter. 3/5

Taiwanese popcorn chicken was something different. It came with seasoning which was on the saltier side. Their popcorn chicken, French fries and sweet potato fries are perfect snacks to order on the side.

CONCLUSION
Their teaspresso is amazing. No matter what flavor you get, you can always taste a hint of tea. I personally think their teas are brewed stronger than Brew Tea Bar or Kung Fu Tea. Try their teas! Also, go 50% or 75% sweetness level as many of the drinks they serve are extremely sweet to begin with.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,8,6,4,f_pcq-6YnNwVoKsGSXYS5w

We tried a BBQ Chicken Plate, Diamond Beef Cake Noodles & Lobster Balls. We feel that if the most basic food on a menu comes out flavorful then that means that everything else will be flavorful as well. Their ( basic) BBQ Chicken was bursting with flavor & was delish! The Diamond Beef was flavorful & so soft - topped on fried noodles cut into little cakes were a perfect compliment to eachother.

In my opinion, drinks taste very powder-based. I've recently had the Hokkaido milk tea (prefer Brew's) and Okinawa brown sugar (tasted just like regular milk tea) and I'd only stop in for drinks again when the location is convenient. There are better milk tea options.

On the bright side, Boba Hut does have a lot of food options that are quite tasty for a great price. Their pork belly options are abundant- you can get them in a bun, with rice, or in an onion pancake. There's also teriyaki and katsu chicken along with soup and noodle options. They all taste pretty unhealthy but that's where the taste comes from :-). Tarts from 702Sweets (I think) are available. Please make the li hung Mui ones again! Those are amazing. 
Seating has always been open when I've come in. 
I do wish that not every food item was served with styrofoam, as that prevents me from wanting to try more dishes. They are pretty accepting about using my own reusable cup and containers though.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,5,3,3,SxowwUUUJbptSK5WEMbgpg

Though I already had my fav boba, I had to get one tonight since this place is more around my neighborhood.  If I truly like it, I can stop over here for my boba fix.

Love that they have the option of sweetness level for my boba.  So for boba. I chose the winter melon oolong with grass jelly.  I just took my first sip, ummmm, dude, yuuuuum! 

As far as food goes, I like that they have photos of the menu items, but the menu is missing on the board.  I had to grab myself a to go menu to really take a look at what there was to offer. Idk if having a stamp card is a good idea.  Lol, means I'll be stamping it up a lot!

I did bookmark this place because I was intrigued by the candied spam musubi, so that was my appetizer.  Jesse and I split the chicken cake noodle and the pork chop rice plate.  For my daughter, she had the HK Mac soup.

We did eat here, the food took a bit long.   My cake noodle wasn't so bad.  Jesse really didn't like his pork chops.  I had a piece and I agreed.   It was over cooked and didn't have much flavor.   The soup, it pretty much a macaroni saimin with a piece of BBQ chicken in it.

With that being said, in my mission to find awesome cake noodle in Vegas, Boba Hut has been the best so far.

The cake noodle itself is done near perfection. Portion is generous. Price is reasonable. 

So what's the problem? The sauce and the meat. It was too sweet and lacked the hole-in-the-wall Cantonese flavor. It was like putting teriyaki sauce and teriyaki chicken on top of the noodles. Not what I was looking for, but again the noodles alone were enough to give this a 4-star rating.

Background for this Review:
I've interviewed the owner to get some insight on their background and history and tried some of the food and drinks. I've not tried everything yet. The interview information is at the bottom.

-Promotional Soft Opening Discount -
There's a promotion going on! 20% off everything until the end of the month. So you can decide if you like it or not and not break the wallet :)

----------------------------------------------
MY FIRST EXPERIENCE- First Visit - Oct 18th, 2015 - Dinner time

I visited on the first soft opening day. No music yet and when I asked about it they said they're putting in speakers and music soon. So if you go and it's still quiet, they're working on it xD

Decor is Modern/Contemporary. Cute glowing balls hanging from the ceiling. Size is good for groups! They'll be adding more seating later too after establishing occupancy limit.

My Teapresso order: I ordered the Osmanthus Oolong Teapresso! (Iced, 100% Sweetness). 

Why that order? I ordered it because I looked up osmanthus and it's a floral note. Flower xD And I've been into floral notes on teas for a while now.

Tea Speed: The Teapresso came out pretty quickly. Maybe 3-5 mins max? I was talking with friends so I didn't time it but it was really quick.

Tea Flavor: The flavor was great. I'm picky on tea lol. The floral notes and the Oolong flavor were great. A little sweet but the flavor of the tea was not overpowered at all. The espresso machine does a great job lol. I recommend with a less or no sweetness if you're not too into sweet teas. I'm usually a fan of no sweetener or just lightly sweetened.

I also tried my friend's jasmine milk tea with boba. Jasmine flavor was great ^__^

I also ordered some appetizers: I tried the Bbq Chicken Musubi and the Onion Pancake. It was their first day and it was packed so it took a little while to come out but not too long. Maybe 15 mins. The musubi was awesome xD just how it should be. Great flavor and hot. The Onion Pancake was huge. Not a lot of flavor but that's what an onion pancake is like lol. Maybe try it Pork Belly style. My friend got curry fish balls and I dipped it in the curry and that was awesome xD I suggested it to the owner so I hope he adds that in lol.

MY FRIEND'S FOOD
My friend got the loco moco and a breakfast musubi (spam, egg, candy bacon) and he loved them xD and the curry fishballs lol.

P.S. The chairs are a little squeaky on the floor right now when you move them around. They're aware now and will work on it :)
----------------------------------------------

MY SECOND EXPERIENCE -  SECOND VISIT - Oct 20th, 2015 - Lunch Time

I visited the 3rd day of soft opening and there were a few people there. The owner was there and I told him I tried the Osmanthus Oolong Teapresso last time and I liked that. And I asked for another recommendation so he said definitely try the Peach Oolong Teapresso. I did and I'm not disappointed :) I lowered the sweetness level to 50%. That's enough for me. Came out pretty quick :) It was great ^__^ peach flavor is nice with the Oolong.

After sitting here for an hour or so on my laptop, lots of high school kids nearby dropped by to try it out. The line got long lol. 

Oh. WIFI is free. Just ask them for the password :)

The flavor of the tea tasted like mixed taro-flavored powder and milk but the honey boba was just how I like it. I didn't finish the boba drink though.

They have a wide variety of Boba drinks they also have food, I like the fact that you were able to customize your Boba drink to your liking and control how much sugar goes into it which for me is a huge plus.

The Boba itself tasted very good nice and refreshing on a warm day like today which was 86° a way better and healthier option then any soft drink.

Customer service was really good I receive my drink in a very timely manner and overall just a good Boba, and good experience.I will definitely stop here in the future.

Just in case you're wondering the price of the Boba was $4.49",cRDQuBEgxaYQoSPHAiEgHQ,0,0,4,6rHMivHm-tbKkvQoNQRPxA

5029892,2017-07-22,0,VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg,"So I've tried this place three times and each time has been disappointing. I usually don't like doing bad reviews and don't really come across places I feel like I need to write a bad review but I'm extremely dissatisfied after the third time of me trying them. The first time I ordered some sort of noodle cake which was ok, the sauce was flavorful but they were so hard and chewy that I could barely bite into them. 

The second time I had my boyfriend pick up an order for me. I was on the phone with him as he ordered so I know that he ordered udon and what I got when he came home was not at all the same dish.  I actually have no idea what they really gave me so I can't tell you but it wasn't bad, it just wasn't for me and wasn't what I ordered. 

That brings us to the third time. I ordered a simple salmon teriyaki bowl off post mates. I live pretty close to this place so they said it was a 25 to 30 minute wait. It took about an hour for them to deliver my food. I know it wasn't the delivery man it was the restaurant that took forever to prepare my food. When I got the food, it was much smaller than I expected and the salmon was so hard that it resembled more of the texture of chicken. I couldn't even eat it with a fork it was so over cooked. Maybe that's why the food took so long to make because they were busy fossilizing my salmon. Not only that, there was also virtually no teriyaki sauce, only A tiny bit on top of the piece of salmon and there was literally two tiny pieces of broccoli and three slices of cabbage over plain white rice. That is what I waited for for all this time? I would have made white rice at home if I knew that it was going to be like that instead of spending $13 altogether with delivery and tip. 

I really wanted to like this place but I don't think that I will be ordering from them again.",1DLvCQ0vQ87BPp3iqYgRZQ,1,0,2,s5og1pADjdzF3ylYXmH_sQ

5085156,2015-12-07,6,VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg,"I came for the wintermelon milk tea and they sure met my expectations! Another great addition to Rainbow Blvd's awesome Asian food lineup. 

Boba hut offers different drink flavors, combinations, and toppings you cannot get anywhere else in Las Vegas. They are able to stand up to the stiff competition, no doubt! 

This is a Chinese Hawaiian fusion place serving up legit brewed tea boba drinks and Hawaiian comfort food.  Their tea game is strong and they use a Teapresso machine. 

The way to order your drinks is to:
1) Pick your base ($3.00): black tea, black milk tea, green tea, or green milk tea. Available in hot or cold. 

2) Add flavor ($0.50): plum, peach, mango, lychee, grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberry, honeydew, passionfruit, wintermelon, and peppermint! 

3) Sweetness level: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%.
*Their drinks are pretty sweet here. Personal recommendation...I order either 50%-75%.

4) Add toppings ($0.50): honey boba, rainbow jelly, mango jelly, lychee jelly, coffee jelly, red bean, egg pudding, grass jelly pudding, crystal boba, aloe, and popping boba. 

Other drink menu items include: specialty drinks like taro milk tea, thai tea, teaspresso drinks, and more! Also, slushes, non-caffeinated drinks, and smoothies. 
 
If you have a sweet tooth, they have 6 different desserts like malasadas and various tofu puddings! 

Here's what I was able to try:
- wintermelon milk tea w/ grass jelly
- lychee black tea w/ honey boba
- white grape oolong teapresso
- cake noodles with chicken
- popcorn chicken
- spam and candy bacon musubi
- crystal boba (sample) 

I thought their drinks were really good, but needed fine tuning on my part. If you are familiar with wintermelon tea, it is very sweet on it's own. I ordered this at 75% sweetness and it was too sweet for me. Next time, 50% should perfect it! Their tea is strong and very refreshing! The tea does not get muddled at all by flavors or toppings. Crystal boba is not for everyone. I did not like it. It's not starch based like honey boba. It is just a flavorless, clear agar jelly. 

Food was hit or miss, but shows a lot of promise. I am super picky with popcorn chicken and this was a miss. It was very bland and missing the seasoning that I am used too. No spicy levels either, just plain ol' popcorn chicken and some fried basil.  A Chinese Hawaiian comfort dish I was able to try for the first time is the cake noodles with chicken...and it was really good! The spam and candy bacon musubi was good, but could use a thicker piece of spam, due to the ratio of rice. 

I am pretty amazed with this place and the friendly and prompt service I received. All food and drinks came out in a timely manner. It is pretty spacious compared to other boba places. 

Some items I look forward to trying:
- Hawaiian slush (pineapple, mango, li hing mui)
- Pork belly loco moco
- Drunken noodles
- Saimin/macaroni soup
- Desserts!

I ordered dry beef chow fun and cake noodles with chicken. They were both very good. I always crave for a good dry chow fun and they do a good job here, not over oily and tasted great. The cake noodles are thin chow mein  egg noodles pan fried crispy (cut into squares) with a sauce on the side. This was also very good but I believe it could have been even better if I had eaten it there (it took me 15 mins. to get home). I also had their taro slush with red beans while waiting for my food and it was one of the better taro slushes I've ever had. They let you choose the sweetness and I picked 50% sweet which was pretty sweet already. Lastly, the girls that are working there were really nice and polite and made me feel welcomed.

5383763,2018-04-23,26,VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg,"Boba Hut specializes in Asian Fusion type dishes, with the main specialties being Hawaiian and Chinese food; however, the name of the place makes it known that they also specialize in tea and boba. They're also part of an expanding chain where a similar restaurant named Curry Hut has just opened in Vegas. 

My cousin is a fan of their slushie type drinks and brought me one afternoon to give it a try, knowing that I enjoy boba. Boba Hut is located on Rainbow Blvd in a decent sized plaza around the corner from Dickie's BBQ. 

They have Hawaiian plates (BBQ chicken, Kalua pork, Katsu), appetizers (potstickers, popcorn shrimp, French fries, etc.), Asian plates (Kung Pao chicken, fried rice, stir fry) as well as macaroni soups and burgers. 

We all shared an order of the Drunken Noodles with chicken ($8.10) - beef costs an additional fifty-five cents. I thought the dish was pretty tasty. Very similar to the Asian ""beef chow fun noodles"". The dish was pretty large, served in a Styrofoam box that was able to feed four people. Not too oily and there was enough ""wok hei"" to give it that good flavor. Good amount of chicken - and adding Sriracha made it taste that much better. I would recommend trying this out. 

As for the drinks - you can customize your drink by picking a base, flavor, sweetness level, and toppings OR you can choose from their specialty drinks, slushes, smoothies, etc. I went with a safe choice and tried their green milk tea with honey boba ($3.65). With the blender going off every other minute, it seemed like they really did produce quality drinks; however, when I tried my milk tea - it tasted incredibly bland. The color was not right and there was no flavor in the drink at all! It actually tasted like a watered down milk tea. I went to the counter and asked another worker if this was the green milk tea. She apologized and took my old one before reaching into the refrigerator and pulling out an already made green milk tea ... so they had messed up my order and had given me a boba milk tea instead. The new green milk tea did taste better than the first drink, but not by much. I don't think I have very high standards for tea, but the drink was pretty pricey yet the quality was subpar - I would put it below Quickly. Not much tea flavor - boba was cooked pretty well, but didn't get that ""honey"" to the boba either. 

Maybe their slushes and smoothies are better choices. I saw a ton of people ordering those, and my cousin seemed to really enjoy his pineapple slush. 

tl;dr - Would not recommend ordering any milk teas from this place. Maybe their other drinks are pretty good, but the milk tea and green milk tea were both pretty disappointing. Drunken noodles are not too bad, but I don't think I'd return to this place if I had the option.",t3cu9DxXtGyaPIWNvPOXxA,33,31,2,NMgI19K1-4dDi9fMJz0K2w

5517479,2016-02-03,0,VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg,"As I was browsing through yelp looking at all the boba spots in town, I came across this place. Instantly, I was interested in trying the place out because I saw that they also served food! Hawaiian food in particular. 

I entered on an afternoon and it was packed with a bunch of high schoolers. Despite the crowd, I was still noticed and immediately greeted by the cashier who was certainly a friendly face. 

For the most part, the boba places I have visited here in the desert does not ALWAYS offer egg pudding or red beans as your topping. So I thought that was cool or perhaps I havent been to too many boba shops to notice. Random thought as I was waiting for my drink because it did take a bit to come out (they were pretty busy so they had a ticket out of this one)...why is it called a 'topping' if it is at the bottom of the drink. Retarded question, but it was like an epiphany as I was zoning out. Lol.

I'm not a milk tea drinker. I go green...I go black...tea! So I can't review on such. I did cheat on Tea Time by trying what I know best, which is the strawberry black tea. Told you I like to live life on the edge. I opted for no boba which I somewhat regretted because my drink, suprisingly, needed the boba. My taste buds felt like it was lacking something, and if you've read my other reviews...I'm not much of a boba eater so that says a few thangs.

The drinks come in 1 size, a large size that is. You can pick your level of sweetness that goes 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 percent. I chose 25 and found the sweet level to be just right for me. The cashier said if it isn't sweet enough then she can sweeten it up for me. Didn't need her to, but glad to know they honor such adjustment. The strawberry flavor was certainly present, and I can even taste the black tea. Awesome! I just didn't like the strawberry base they use so I wasn't estatic.

Ordered the husband a taro milk tea with red beans. He loved the red beans, but said he couldn't really taste the rainbow...I mean, the taro. 

Overall, my drink wasn't that bad and I suppose my husband felt the same. I wouldn't come from the North side all the way to Spring Valley for it. They do serve food in which some items on the menu did interest me. Pricing is pretty reasonable and is similar to most places both boba and food.

I definitely love their menu options. Perhaps if I ever return while i''m in the vicinity I can explore more to give a better review based on their food. For now, that's the best I can give you. I will say give it a shot if you happen to be driving by and want boba at the same time. However, I won't recommend a person who has to drive across town for their boba itself. There'd enough boba spots across the valley to get your fix.

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,1,0,3,Z449oUWVdTVRW0ePyv5MqQ
5526175,2016-06-19,0,VzUo-RURV3VnfNItAYM8yg,"Yooooo I actually love the crystal boba here. Like, I love the texture and the flavor, I really wish I could find a place in LA that had it because dang, I'll definitely want this boba again. It also went really well with my Jasmine Milk Teapresso! Not too sure what a teaspresso is but I asked for 75% sugar and it was the perfect sweet Jasmine flavor I was looking for. 

I also had my friend's Osmanthus Oolong Tea and it was pretty good too although I prefer my Jasmine. Overall, this place has solid teas which is what I appreciate because nowadays, too many places taste like straight up syrup and that's not cool. It's also nice that you can adjust the sweetness.

Boba Hut is not only a fun play on words but an actual dining experience. Although it's touted as a boba shop, just like the utilitarian ways of most Vegas restaurants, they excel in many different culinary aspects. 

The drinks themselves are great if you like the fruitful bouquets and flavors. Your choices are black or green tea with milk options. You can customize the sweetness of the drinks by percentage so if you don't like drinks too sweet or you're a sugar fairy you can get your sweet game on. 

The food has personality too. The drunken noodles are absolutely fantastic! Think of a very good chow fun with a bit of zest and you'll love it. No added seasoning necessary. It slides warmly down your gullet and makes your insides feel like a welcoming Christmas fireplace. You can really taste the passion of cooking with this one dish which is also why it's a dangerous dish because if you eat it first it can make all the other dishes feel a bit bland. Loco Moco? Good stuff but you're not drunken noodle. Pork buns? Hi there. I'll eat you later when the taste of drunken noodles is gone. That's how good it is. 

As far as service goes, they were friendly and very helpful. They knew we were on the fence about the sweet factor with our drinks and said if we don't like the way it comes out they will fix it. That's not just great service but a good attitude in life. 

I know six months ago I was incredibly disappointed by this place. I expected so much and didn't even get a sample. But now that I've tried I can say I'll be glad to return.",ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg,3,1,5,YFFXTKthbH0t1ktlPLeucg

My first inclination is that they only serve drinks but the food menu is surprisingly large for a a place whose name suggests only boba.  I've had the house milk tea with boba and green milk tea with boba and recommend the half sweetness since they use honey boba.  The half sweetness level is just right in my opinion.  As for food I've only tried the BBQ chicken plate which satisfied my hunger but the flavor was mediocre and the chicken itself was a bit tough and not tender.  Plenty of parking in the shopping center and service is decent since it's a walk up counter.  I did have an issue waiting for my food and drink one time as there was only one person ahead of me but I waited about 15 minutes for a house milk tea and BBQ chicken plate.

Management is open to any opinions and suggestions so feel free to let them know! Drink adjustments are encouraged if you are not happy with your drink. 

They only have one size for their drinks and it's a large. For the price they charge, it's competitive with other establishments. Don't forget to grab stamp cards!

Not every food item is available since they just opened but definitely try out their food and see how you like them! I prefer the beef with chow fun noodles myself :).",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,5,1,5,x1n_pEt5J53RFKMw1uZ7XQ

The store is extremely clean which is pretty hard to do when a ton of high schoolers constantly come and go!

My server and cashier today, Taimane was very friendly and a lot of help getting me accustomed to their menu! I forgot my card up at the front and she came to the table to return, which I thought was so much better than yelling across the room (props to her for being polite!)

Their brew tea is made to order from the TEAPRESSO equipment, and you can choose your preferred sweetness level and ice. But the flavored tea will come with at least 50% sweetness if you need to know. They also have various toppings for the customers to choose, such as jelly, crystal boba and popping boba (they all come with diverse flavors), egg pudding and red bean.. etc.

We tried 4 different flavored tea and 3 dishes there: 

- Passion Fruit Tea with Red Bean: This is my favorite! Great passion fruit taste with the perfectly brewed tea, fresh and impressive. The red bean is soft and well-cooked, too.

- White Peach Tea with Lychee jelly: Extremely fresh taste with rich flavored Lychee jelly, just perfect for summer time or to wake you up like the breeze.

- Taro Milk Tea with Crystal Boba: Great milk tea with beautiful color from taro. Crystal Boba is interesting to try if you haven't had it before. 

- Black Milk Tea with Boba and Egg Pudding - I think they make the best Boba in town, chewy and not too hard. 

Too bad that they ran out of Grass Jelly, I am sure I will go back to try it next visit. Wish them to  provide the real milk instead of just creamer to make the milk tea tho. 

* Cake Noodles with Grilled Chicken: This is something new to me, and I haven't seen any other restaurants having it. It is really good, especially if you were a big fan of HK style noodles. The chicken is so juicy and tender. Highly recommended! 

* Drunken Noodles: It won me with the saporous basil favor!  

* Mango Fried Rice with Cashew and Chinese Shredded Pork: Fried Rice is something simple but requires excellent skill to cook. I believe they have really talented and experienced chefs to make the fried rice flavorful but not greasy.",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,10,8,5,MQFamHxcE0hX7UwDmYP79g

In both of my visits this place was pretty empty, and it's kind of hard to miss considering the size of the place. 
I am absolutely in love with the design of the menu that they have and their logo. Keeping in mind that I saw their menu before I went to the store I was kind of really excited to see their decor and environment boba hut had to offer. 
Basically I was too exited, because seemed like a half decorated shop.

On my first visit I had the oolong milk teapresso hot. The cashier had a hard time pronouncing the name, which  asked how to say because I was curious (lol)
I was expecting a really strong tea flavor, but no. Not at all. Watered down oolong with ....watered down milk? The boba was also very mushy. 

On my second visit I went with two other people and since some of my friends had said that their food was a lot better than their drinks (even though the place is called BOBA hut)
I kept my hopes up.
We all ended up ordering a lot of food.

Spam misubi
Hawaiian bbq mix 
Chicken katsu
Drunken noodles
Popcorn chicken

Most of the dishes came with rice and macaroni salad. 

I guess the only thing that was ""worth it"" ended up being the spam, which I didn't even try. 

I felt like most of the dishes were just overwhelming with strong flavors. Maybe it was garlic? Pepper? I don't know. But it overpowered all the food, covered up the taste of all the protein.

Along with the food we ordered the following drinks

Thai tea w/ popping boba 50% sweet
Coffee milk tea w/ pudding 
White grape oolong tea

I was disappointed in the Thai tea, maybe I should've gotten 100% sweetness 
And the peach popping boba definitely did NOT component the drink (whoops, my bad choice)

The coffee milk tea was pretty good, nothing to rave about though.

And I think I liked the grape oolong best, even though it didn't taste like oolong. 

Service was 5 stars, everyone was really nice 
They came to our table about 4 times while we are to ask if everything was okay. I didn't enjoy anything that we got but I also didn't want to be rude. The cashier seemed very knowledgeable about the menu.
