The broccoli looked weird, the other entrees looked old and dried up so I did not want any of it. JOHNNY ROCKET has awesome burgers!",OdP8Wqo4xLCN9P_IoOpDww,0,0,1,CJXCXAk1jCN4LYT8dWNrIA

2219241,2015-12-29,0,xqoBJepL-cB-M_6Di1Sdjw,"This place sucks. They should close this branch. I complain to the person serving that their fried rice is half cooked and salty instead of accommodating me he just turn back and gave me a grin talking to the other person that wears white and I assumed that he's the manager. Their customer service is zero. These employees should be fired from their job. This business needs a person that taste food before they serve it to consumers. Just a waste of money. It's ok to pay more if the food taste good.
     I will not eat at this place anymore and will tell to my friends, family and employees.",RJStg1ZO11yJYmQ61NkVeA,0,0,1,uiVkh5yk9DCMvPTSJIs1lw

The staff from Nathans was also running the cash register at Pan Asian. I assume they share ownership. Would not recommend this place at all based on the quality, quantity and cost.

Other reviews issues weren't evident in my visit and I would say for Vegas the prices were reasonable.  I would eat here again based in this visit.,WUgxsRUFjATha8L4qWYDww,1,0,3,nY9cSffthcOH6ZMB-pg8cQ
2541882,2016-10-30,0,xqoBJepL-cB-M_6Di1Sdjw,this joint is way too pricey! $11 for 2 items! and side of veggie $8..?!? would have been okay if they give good amount/portions of food. They're employee has no personality at all..!! - so not worth of my visit.!!,RhfS1oBIBKMVgXsbbYAXZQ,0,0,1,DoaeBfg4iAJSasxITpYjsg

And I had my self an omelette this morning. And the omelette was more then Amazing. Full of vegetables. It was perfect. Staff was friendly as well.

mushrooms was weird.   I did not finish my food, one of things saving this place was that it did have coke there.

When I arrived the lady that served my food was too busy talking to her employees and they had to stop her for her to even acknowledge me.

Not coming back, I will probably go to McDonalds next door in the food court.",YWvQxH96IZ9HpFbnB8y2dw,0,0,1,RJqe_AM0YXAOqZVm3_8iPg

Wasted of 15.00 for the most inedible food I have ever even attempted to eat. I'm pretty sure what I got (orange chicken and sweet and sour pork) was not even real meat.

Bad-tasting imitation of all the panda express dishes, constantly out of food evem during off times, double the price of panda express.  The only saving grace for them is perhaps the fortune cookie that comes with the meal.  At least that is still relatively crunchy and not stale.  Avoid if you can.",nE3bDP0cL2pNbmBeBwowDw,1,0,1,s2b46y7v-8CNixl3JT7Syg
