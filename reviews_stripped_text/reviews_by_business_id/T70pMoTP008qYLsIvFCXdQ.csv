35029,2013-10-28,0,T70pMoTP008qYLsIvFCXdQ,"AMAZING! Recently my girlfriend and I have decided to incorporate much more of a vegan lifestyle. It has been a huge challenge to find vegan options in Vegas. I heard about the Red Velvet Cafe and got the impression that there wasn't a ton to offer. Boy was I wrong! 
When we sat down we looked through the menu. At first it seemed like there were only a few vegan options. But we came to find out that EVERY item could be done vegan style. 
We started with Chili Rubbed Potatoes as an appetizer and were blown away. Hearty with just enough kick. For our entrees my girlfriend had the vegan version of chicken and squash with a teriyaki sauce. I had the chicken and eggplant in a sweet and spicy sauce. Both of our entrees had vegetables were you could taste the quality and freshness. The faux chicken was amazing. And the sauces were killer. The desserts here are nothing short of divine. We got three to take home. 
At the end of the meal Sunil, who I'm pretty sure is the owner, came over and talked with us. You can tell he takes great pride in his food and he should! 
Vegas can be really challenging for someone who is vegetarian/vegan. But rest assured there is an incredible restaurant here.",qO63bm_qSJMIU6FS0Ow7KA,0,0,5,GaYtnOsqvxbbnCZoYkYc5g

The Cuban press was my favorite; I want to go back to Vegas just to eat it again. The waitress gave us extra gluten-free pita as well for no charge, which was nice. Cake was good too, especially for gluten free vegan.

I noticed that a lot of people are giving this place one-star reviews because they apparently mislabeled a cookie as too low-calorie. Yeah that's not a great thing to do, but come on people, it's not like they were breeding rats in the kitchen or shipping their profits off to al Qaeda. I go to Vegas quite a bit and It is SO DIFFICULT to find good gluten-free food there, especially this close to the Strip. Let's not drive one of the few good gluten-free places out of business because of a cookie. Did you balloon up like Regina George, Yelpers? No?

When I walked in the first thing we noticed was all of the dust clinging to the light fixtures, ceiling and walls (especially around light switches). Then we sat with our menus waiting...and waiting...and waiting for our order to be taken. The avocado dip and whole wheat chips was an amazing appetizer, and there the good food ended. Our lunches took over 30 minutes to be brought to us when half the cafe was empty. I stood at the counter trying to get someone's attention when the waiter never came back to check on us or give us more water. The floor in the kitchen is covered in food, especially under their rolling racks, and the counter tops where food is prepared are littered with dirty utensils and pieces of food that fell during prep. My chicken salad sandwich was completely bland and had a weird after taste which was such a surprise after the great avocado dip. I even tried to apply pepper to help and wouldn't you know it, my pepper shaker was completely empty. When the waiter finally came back to ask if we needed anything it had been over an hour since we'd sat down and we asked for the check. 

I'd had really high expectations for this place after reading all the reviews and now I have no idea why anybody wants to go back here.

The food court on one side of the mall and Red Velvet on the other. Talk about convenience. If you're by the Macy's area and want something quick to eat, well, here it is. It's right in between the escalators by the Brookstone's and the ABC store.

They only had 10 minutes 'til closing so we opted to get the tiramisu to go. We were advised by a friendly guy behind the counter  to heat up the tiramisu for 30 seconds before eating it because it wasn't a typical tiramisu and "" heating it up will make it moister."" The bf absolutely disliked it, but then again it was his first time eating something vegan. I on the other hand, thought it was decent.

First off there was very little coffee flavor to be had anywhere in the whole thing. It didn't taste even remotely like tiramisu; if not for the label I would have guessed it was just white cake. Also the cake was stale and dry, god only knows how long it was sitting in that case before we were unlucky enough to pick it up. The frosting was very grainy/sandy, like it wasn't blended well or maybe was just very old. 

The staff told me that they don't bake anything there and get it shipped in from another spot, so maybe they need to review their inventory tracking system.

551316,2012-02-15,1,T70pMoTP008qYLsIvFCXdQ,"We were in Vegas for 2 days, staying across the street at the Wynn.  We ate here twice.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas, purely so I can have their Red Velvet Cake again (It's vegan and 150 calories.  WHAAATT??).  It's sweet, but not overly sweet.  One thing I love about vegan desserts, is that without the buttery taste that coats your mouth, you can actually taste the nuances of each ingredient, and that was so totally the case here.  And the cream cheese frosting- Holy Lord!  I'll be honest: It had me doing the math for how many I could actually eat in one day and stay within my target caloric intake (12 on a workout day, 10 on a non-workout day).

They also have maybe the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had, vegan or not.  The spiced hummus w/pita was pretty damn amazing.  Great soy milk lattes.  They serve vegan wine (in the mall!!!), but we didn't have any.  We got the vegan Buffalo Chicken Wrap to go, so we could eat at while waiting for our plane at the airport.  As we were leaving the server ran up and said ""Did you want a vegan wrap?,"" to which we replied ""Uh, yes.""  He then said ""I'm sorry, I don't think I told the chef that.  Let me go have them fix it.""  It made me slightly nervous that he forgot that, but I am so thankful he caught it.

The reason this place gets 4 stars is because we ordered another box of chocolate chip cookies to go with our wrap, and while were waiting, I watched, from our seats at the bar, the following go down: About 5 minutes after we placed our order, a lady comes to the counter and orders a box of chocolate chip cookies and some other stuff.  The lady helping her picks up the box of chocolate chip cookies from the case and says ""You're in luck- you got the very last box.""  While she was taking the rest of her order, our server and the manager go up to her and start whispering to her.  The lady working behind the counter says ""Well, if someone already ordered it, why wasn't there a 'reserved' sticker on it?""  Our server then comes back to us and tells us ""I'm sorry, we're actually out of chocolate chip cookies.""  I don't think he knew that I saw them sell the box that was supposed to be ours to someone else, but I didn't feel like being a petty asshole about it (I just wanted to rant about it later on Yelp, obviously), so we just got some oatmeal raisin cookies to go.

We didn't eat the Buffalo Wrap at the airport because we were too full from stuffing our face with all of said oatmeal raisin cookies.  I ate half of the wrap the next day, and half the day after that, and even as leftovers- the wrap was pretty wonderful.

PS- the first day we ate there, the owner was there, and said he is looking to open a location in West Hollywood.  Possibly on Sunset.  I think I'm going to see if there's a mailing list I can get on, so I know exactly when this blessed day arrives...",G05ouqcvZeFCGR6ABWC6BQ,2,0,4,a7zdQTWHuiy-PWLaYDz-Ig

Wife & I went for lunch. I will say that the panini was good. Happy with that. 

Have had the taco salad before, we ordered it again. This time the bottom was burnt (happens, whatever). If did throw the taste off, my wife and I split both meals, we finished the panini and less than a third of the taco salad. Neither of could get past the taste - waste of $14 is what it was. 

I wouldn't have said anything if weren't for the cashiers response. When paying she asked how our meal was. Figured I might as well be honest, I told her the sandwich was great and that the taco salad wasn't what I was expecting. Her response was ""oh really?""

Response was inviting to elaborate, so I told her I have had the taco salad in the past, that it tasted different from this time, that the bottom layer was burnt and that neither my wife nor I could get past the taste. The cashiers next response was an uncaring ""oh - sorry"" and handed me our change and she turned around to organize some items that clearly needed no organizing.

At first sight, I wasn't impressed.  The decor, well, it is in a Mall.  So, pretty much what I expected.  However, the food was good, the staff was super friendly, and the gluten free options were remarkable.  Everything, and I mean everything, on the menu could be made gluten free.  My wife's pita sandwich was delicious.  The pita tasted a little sweet, as most gluten free bread do.  But, other than that, it tasted just like a regular sandwich bread.  Her spicy potatoes were freakin' fantastic.  I kept steal them.  My sandwich was also good.  Not amazing, but definitely good.

Overall, I liked the place.  And would give it 3 stars.  But, knowing how hard it is to find REAL gluten free options, I appreciated the place all the more.

I'm not a vegan, but I'm making attempts to embrace vegan cuisine because I'm trying to be more open minded about it. Not all of it tastes or looks like cardboard and Red Velvet does a good job of breaking the vegan food stereotype. They do serve chicken, bacon, shrimp and other regular sources of protein here, so it's a place that can work for everyone.

They have great variety of sandwiches wraps, salads and desserts as well as a wide selection of gourmet teas including varieties on white, green and black teas. They also have your basic coffee drinks, smoothies, and hot chocolate. I usually don't make it a point to call out an establishment's hot chocolate selection, but they  have a Mexican hot chocolate that is....sinful. Rich, chocolatey and smooth-a nice way to warm up in winter and if you spend enough time in the mall, a nice treat to break up a day of shopping.

I prefer their wraps to the sandwiches because while the bread here is good, I find it to be a little too thick for the sandwiches, and they all come pre-made so there's not really a way to get thinner bread slices. I had the buffalo chicken wrap last time I was there and half of it  (with the side salad) was filling enough for lunch. I liked that the buffalo sauce came on the side so you could control how much was on there and the wrap wasn't soggy. 

The service is genuinely friendly here. The staff can be chatty, not in a bad way, and they are happy to make suggestions if asked! You can sit at the bar where they have a selection of wine, beer and specialty mixed cocktails or get regular sit-down service at one of the tables. 

Best of all this is a place that ultimately strives for healthy eating options without being judgmental about it. They aren't completely organic, but there's a heavy focus on it which I can appreciate.

http://www.reviewjournal...

To summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.

I've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating.

I know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true!

I just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you? Their food may be delicious, but their actions left a bad taste in my mouth.",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,13,5,2,0hEY7Sz7bhysOZbxrzlxeg

All I had to do was skip across the street, make it through the mall, and there it was!

It is very cute, in an open are in the center of the mall. There seems to be plenty of seating, and rows of desserts lining the shelves.

Not everything is vegan, but they do specialize in vegan food and desserts. I didn't get a chance to try any of the desserts, but I decided to splurge on my meal.

I got the veggie panini-vegan style. That means they use the vegan pesto and vegan daiya cheese instead. She asked if I wanted to add vegan chicken in for a few dollars more, but I opted out because I felt like the flavors in the sandwich were probably rich and filling already. I stuck with the salad, but added on the plain roasted potatoes on the side.

It is on the pricier side, especially if you decide to start adding ingredients. ($3 potatoes here, $3 faux chicken, $1 avocado, etc.)

I should have splurged a bit even more and added the chicken and went for the seasoned potatoes.

The sandwich was good, but nothing extraordinary. It quickly got soggy and the flavors were surprisingly not rich and filling. It felt like it was missing something. The pesto just fell flat. But it wasn't bad, I still enjoyed it.

The salad was overdressed, and the dressing itself was nothing to write about.
The potatoes, advertised as roasted, were nothing more than steamed potatoes. I like that they use exotic potatoes, such as red, blue, yellow, etc. But the fact that it was simply steamed meant that it didn't have a hearty ""roasted"" flavor, not was it seasoned at all. Very very bland.

In the end, it was not unenjoyable, but nothing too memorable. A bit overpriced, but what isn't in Las Vegas. I'm just glad I was able to find something to eat so close to my hotel!",x9DRvDktxccwvZemaOMgZA,8,5,3,329RdFvZw3bpw2rzomRl7g

We were too full to try a cookie or cake, but will shoot for that next time.  Service was very friendly.

We both ordered the Red Velvet Cake too go. It lot smaller then the main one on Sahara. I never really seen a kitchen so thinking most of it made at the main store. Everything they selling was in deli style display, all boxed in clear plastic containers (so could clearly see the product; everything looked fresh and could tell they pay attention too details aka decoration), clearly labeled name and price, and they do have tables that sit down have lunch or dinner. I ordered too go. Everything looked good all the cakes, muffins, salads, and sandwiches. They have espresso machine if wanted more then coffee. 

The Red Velvet Cake was AWESOME! I had my reservations comes too vegan food but mostly that comes from the unknown. I am always health conscious but vegan don't know that many places except for this one and not something that crave. But WOW after my experience just might have too try more vegan! =) I surprise that the cake was moist, great depth of flavor, frosting perfect compliment, and strawberry too top nice fresh sweet no bruises on it. Really if you never told me it was vegan I would have no idea. Sure next stop by make point try more of the menu. Red Velvet Cake is winner!!!!!!!!!!!

Instead of innovating vegan or vegetarian dishes they seem to veganize they menu by removing the meat and replacing it with a vegan substitute.  Boring....

Pesto should be distinguishable on whatever it is on and it was bland and looked like it was out of a jar.  It tasted like it too. The hummus was also bland and seemed heavily processed and not homemade.  The placed it on the pesto flat bread with a disher/ice cream scoop.

""Red Velvet Café's Famous Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies: Approximately 27 cookies & 1 gram of fat per cookie!!!,"" read the sign--look for yourself. 

That equates to 162 calories per six-cookie box. The more I thought about it, the more it seemed too good to be true.

And it was; a food chemical breakdown test, conducted by the Pacific Coast Analytical Services, showed that Red Velvet Café's cookies actually contain 157 calories each. So when I thought I as eating a 162-calorie box of your cookies, I was actually eating a 942-calorie box.

I learned about this last week, in the Review-Journal. And a couple weeks before that, I began to grow suspicious myself, so I snapped the picture shown above. I also took a secret video of a Café employee walking me through the BS calorie counts of the various baked goods. Then a guy--I believe he's the bakery's co-owner--assured me that the cookies had been tested after baking, and the calorie count was 160. 

A total lie.

A week ago I went to the Café to ask for my money back. I gave my info to the assistant manager, who assured me I'd hear back by Tuesday. Tuesday came and I never heard back. So I'm suing.

Am I crazy for wanting my money back? The way I see it, I didn't get the food item for which I bargained. 

Am I crazy for thinking Red Velvet Café needs to be punished (through punitive damages) for its outrageous, egregious untruth? I don't care whether they were willfully deceiving or just reckless with the truth; I just care that these people are punished for all the years they made money on a total lie.

The prices are already slightly higher than I would like to pay, the Vegan price pushes each sandwhich or wrap to nearly $15!

The vast majority of their exquisite looking desserts are Vegan. I picked out the Candy Bar Cake to try myself & the Tiramisu Cake to surprise someone when she arrived the next day.

I ordered a latte to go with my cake.

The cake itself was quite good as I'm ass-uming that it's the base for most of their cakes. Their vanilla cake base is even better. I would recommend you get one of the crumble cakes instead.

The girl behind the counter was quite friendly and helpful. Much needed as it wasn't quite clear that you order at the counter, then sit down to eat before paying.

Wow can you say a hidden VEGAS gem?  I never would have a thought to find such a great vegan cafe in VEGAS and let alone inside a shopping mall!

You HAVE to try this place next time you're in Vegas.  This is truly a vegan cafe with absolutely delicious vegan options.  The cafe is located inside the Fashion mall across from the Wynn.  Yea that ""weird spaceship looking flying saucer that crashed into a building"" location on the strip.  You know which place I'm talking about it right?  Yup, that's the one.  It took us a while to find the location inside the actual mall the first time but we found it really quick the second time.  Here's the secret.  Park in front of Macy's.  Walk inside Macy's and into the mall.  Once in the mall make an immediate left and you'll see it!  (Like a mirage in the desert...ok no pun intended.  And really this is no mirage it really does exist! Thankfully!)

So we had dinner here during the week.  I had the California Vegan Sandwich panini.  (Check my pics) Very tasty.  Their soy protein ""meat"" is made specifically for Red Velvet Cafe (RVC) and has great texture and taste.  The panini was served with a nice helping of spinach salad.  We loved the presentation and dinner so much we agreed to stop here for breakfast before we were to head back home.  And had another amazing meal.

And yes, we had a serving of their red velvet cake.  It was very good.  The frosting was a little rich for us and might have been a bit too sweet.  We trimmed it off and enjoyed the cake.  We liked it. 

Overall we love this place and have added it to our MUST visit locations when we're in Vegas.  Buffets?  Blah.  If you want something healthy and vegan then this is the place to go!!!!  

Oh and those comments about horrible service and the place being dirty?  Really?  I have no idea where that place was because this location was everything but.  

We had exceptional customer service (perhaps because we ordered the vegan options?  Their specialty)  Everyone was very attentive and made sure we were satisfied with our meal.  Really I have nothing negative to say.  

I will say that if you aren't vegan and are looking to just get your CAKE fix on...then perhaps try something else, there's always donut places around.  But if you're looking for great healthy VEGAN food and perhaps a little dessert afterwards then this HAS to be your place to stop!!!",_YGgmew_Q2moEBUOhVt_4A,2,1,5,slana3oKCPopGZfzxLq-4A

My BFF is Vegan and I've had many awesome Vegan desserts, so being a carnivore, it didn't steer me away. 

Although many of the chocolate items looked tempting, I assumed they specialize in Red Velvet, so I ordered their Red Velvet Cupcake, which is $5.50.

It was topped super high with frosting, so I couldn't wait to dig in!

As soon as I put my fork in the frosting, to my disappointment, the frosting crumbled into pieces. Sure, it was chilled in the cooler, but it was nowhere near cold enough to crumble in that way. The taste didn't make up for it. Perhaps I was spoiled with the Sprinkes Vegan Red Velvet - you could barely taste the difference between the Vegan frosting and regular Cream Cheese Frosting. The frosting of this cupcake was overly sugary and frankly, cheap tasting.

The cake was dense and dry... SUPER DRY that I could barely get my fork through it. It had the consistency of dried out cornbread. It tasted like stale chocolate cake. 

I ended up tossing it like a hockey puck. I was going to bring it back to the counter, not for a refund but to ask them how they have the nerve to sell something so stale. It had to be more than a week old. I can't imagine otherwise. I didn't bother saying anything. A bad taste was left in my mouth until I reached my favorite dessert spot (not Vegan) Jean Philippe. Now THAT's good Red Velvet. 

I gave this place two stars because I feel guilty only giving one, but that's really all it deserves.

I've had my fair share of red velvet desserts; and honestly, I've never had a red velvet cake or cupcake I didn't like...until I had Red Velvet Cafe's version. 

Yes I know it's vegan, but there is no excuse to make bad tasting food with unconventional ingredients. I've had plenty of vegan, or gluten-free, or nut-free, (or all 3 above) desserts that were luscious, rich, and moist. Healthy desserts don't have to taste bad. 

For nearly $6, the red velvet ""cake"" (or better described as an oversized cupcake) was unworthy of my money. It was dense, dry, and lacking in flavor-I felt like I was chewing on a sponge. Instead of the traditional cream cheese frosting, they use sugary buttercream to top it off. How can you even call it a red velvet? And where is the red color? It was unanimous how much we did not like the ""cake"" and after 2 bites, I called it quits.

If your store is called ""red velvet cafe,"" I would expect its namesake dessert to claim the spotlight; otherwise, please consider a new name.

On the upside, I enjoyed the space and decor. Its placement is a little awkward but there is still much to be appreciated about its central location in the mall; convenience being the utmost benefit.

We  ended up picking the chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting because I LOVE peanut butter. 

When we took a bite two hours later, the cake was still super moist and delicious. It totally tasted like a regular chocolate cake, not vegan. In addition, the frosting was super thick and they put a really good amount. Most dessert places give more cake and less frosting but we were happy to have had the opposite. My boyfriend did not like how the frosting was super dense, compared to the cake (it started to weigh the cake down, so that is where we noticed the higher ratio of frosting to cake); however, the flavors were wonderful and we will surly be back!

     The taco salad is excellent. The crispy tortilla bowl is actually baked. Then it's loaded with beans, rice, flavorful taco ""meat"", shredded lettuce, and avocado. It's giant and it's under 500 calories (said the server).
    The red velvet cupcake was served warm. It's a bit dense, tastes rich and satisfying, but is not really oily. I mean, it seems like less fat was used in this than other cakes I've had elsewhere.  That would make sense because the huge cupcake with the frosting is 150 calories (claims the server).
    The chocolate chip cookies are great. There's something about the texture. Slightly crispy outside, chewy everywhere else. 
    Skip the strawberry cream cake. I can't say much for it. The flavor is fine, but it's texture is a bit too heavy. It was denser than the red velvet. But also under 200 cals.
     So, what I don't understand is why there's nothing posted anywhere about the calorie count! If it truly is that unbelievably low, wouldn't you advertise it as such? Makes me think it's all BS!

I was overwhelmed by the selection of vegan gourmet desserts Red Velvet offers. Case after case of beautiful pies, cakes, and cookies.

I couldn't decide on one so we purchased several.

The chocolate chip cookies have more of a shortbread dough to them. Small chips that are in slim numbers may or may not be found within the cookies. Very mild sweetness (which I personally liked, so as to avoid going into a diabetic coma after two bites...). 

The tiramisu was surprisingly delicious and sinful. The same goes for the peanut butter chocolate chip cake. I have yet to dig into my blackberry apple cake.

On the other side of their triangular display casing, we found a plethora of juices, salads, and sandwiches. All looked delectable, most were vegan or vegetarian. I also ordered one of their vegan chicken wraps and really liked it (I'm not normally a fan of wraps). Green tortilla that was fresh (no sogginess or staleness to be found) and perfect layers of fresh spinach, vegan cheese, soy chickn, and artichoke. Perfect!

Service: 5 - The service was really great. The workers were helpful and always asking if we needed any questions answered or wanted some more drinks. They brought the food to our table, which I thought was really sweet since the place is so small, they really didn't have to!

While in Vegas for a bike convention my girlfriend and i went on the hunt for some yummy vegan goods. Armed with the trusty yelp app we saw the reviews and pics for this spot and definitely wanted to try it out. Plus it was walking distance from our hotel. Done and done.

We knew it was in the mall so we ventured in and started looking for the spot. We went up and down and from one end to the other and couldn't for the life of us find this place. Finally I called to see if they were even still there. A girl who picked up told me they were in between two escalators. What an odd place for a cafe. Either way we found it, sat down, and mulled over the menu. We pretty much new what we wanted. We ordered nachos, a sandwich, a pizza, and a dessert. The nachos came out and were pretty good. The chips were like a hybrid of tortilla and pita which made it unique. My only problem is that the cheese seemed burnt. The sandwich was ok and so was the pizza. Not memorable but ok. 

The best part was definitely the dessert which was hard to choose from! After much deliberation we went for the maple pancake cake. They asked if we wanted it heated.......ummmmm yes?! It was genuinely one of the best baked goods I've had period. The cake was moist (hate the word) and tasted just like a pancake and there was maple syrup on the inside. The frosting was perfect with the cake. I don't normally share desserts since I can usually throw it back by myself but I'm glad I did on this. It was so large and very filling.

We were craving something sweet and Red Velvet Cafe has been sitting in my bookmarks. It was also easy to convince the BF to go here because he has this weird obsession with malls ;P

I knew this place was vegan-friendly, I just wasn't expecting for most, possibly ALL desserts in the bakery case to be vegan. That was a nice surprise! So many options, it was a challenge to decide on a flavor :)

We split a Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cake. It was already packaged in a plastic container but when we told the gal behind the counter that we would be dining in, she invited us to sit at any table and that she would bring it out to us. It was presented on a plate and somehow warmed up without melting the chocolate mousse-like topping. http://bit.ly/1JPndNT

This dessert totally hit the spot! The chocolate cake was fluffy and moist. The chocolate mousse was heavenly. Distinct chocolate flavor that's not overly sweet. As for the strawberry flavor, that was pretty much only present in the single fresh strawberry on top. Slight disappointment for the small amount of cookie dough inside, hidden just underneath the actual cookie topping. But we pretty much concluded that if the name was simply ""chocolate cake,"" expectations would be satisfied.

Regardless, it was still a super delicious treat! Perfect size to split between two people. I hope to visit Red Velvet Cafe as often as I can so I can taste the other desserts. 4.5 stars rounded up :)",53dkR4-xyhjsCVHfrwiGaQ,6,5,5,j6s_V4mskpH7mU6iZ9mHIQ
5411302,2013-09-03,0,T70pMoTP008qYLsIvFCXdQ,"The only thing I'll say about the calorie count controversy is that just because something is vegan does not mean its healthy.  Sugar and oil are vegan.  

I give it 4 stars because what I had (chocolate peanut butter cake and chocolate chip cookies) were good, but pretty expensive.  Cookies come to about $1 each.  That may sound OK, but they're only about the size of an oreo, so to me $5.99 for the box (don't remember if there were 6 or 8, but definitely not more), is pretty high.  I can get cookies that are 3x the size at Whole Foods for $1.49 each and less if you buy a package of them.  However, they were among the best vegan chocolate chip cookies I've had.  

But the chocolate peanut butter cake (NOT the gluten free version) was really good.  Again expensive at $6.50, but its big enough for 2 people to share so if you compare it to restaurant dessert  prices, its not so bad.  But again compared to nicer grocery store prices, its high.  

I looked at sandwiches and nothing looked so amazing that I wanted to pay what they were asking to try them. 

Would I go back?  Sure, but not so often just due to the prices.  It would be a treat only.",8MGtY3IEEVaUidBy7UZB0Q,2,0,4,VUkKVTjpaH7w76_rSzWOxQ

The wrap was large (I could only eat 1/2 of it) and it came with a simple green (think super greens) salad with a balsamic dressing. The wrap was mostly shredded lettuce, but it also had a fair share of the soy chicken, and the buffalo sauce (comes on the side) was yum! It was good, and it was just what I needed. The next time I'm in Vegas I will go back to try some of their other vegan food options.

Now, on to desserts. OMG First of all, there were not just one or two vegan options. There were MANY options for cakes and cookies. I finally settled on three (yes, 3): 
1- Hot Fudge Sundae Cake: I don't know if I should say anything, because I don't want to ruin the surprise for anyone. The icings were reminiscent of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, it had a chocolate ganache (the hot fudge), sprinkles, vanilla cake, and a surprise filling inside, which made me want to do back flips. So rich, I could only take 1 bite.

2- Strawberry Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cake: a chocolate cake, chocolate icing, strawberry, a chocolate chip cookie piece on top, and the surprise chocolate chip cookie dough in the middle. SO delicious and very rich; again, I could only eat 1 bite. You could easily split this with 4 people, or have enough to last a few days.

3 - Lemon Raspberry Cream Cake: lemon infused cake and icing with raspberry. The perfect sweet & tart combination.

The cakes were $6.50 each, and very much worth every penny. This place should be a ""must do"" on every vegan's list, esp those with a sweet tooth.

I could not eat it at all and asked the woman at the counter why it was like this. She said all their cakes are like this. If so, then I would never try the other cakes ever, unless I had some pancakes, but then again the cake's inedible center might ruin my pancakes.",zlKnnNrjzB9cuJOCz41Hhg,2,0,1,CZrEofPCcbwotZ299QiSIg

Pricing is fairly cheap considering that it includes alternatives. 

The space itself is ""cozy""; it's small and I'm sure most people miss it since it's tucked away under the elevators at the fashion show mall. I recommend you not to overlook it anymore. It's worth the snug seating. 

I ordered an all vegan pizza with pepperoni (vegan alternative). It was fulfilling, although the next time I go I'm either going to ask for no cheese alternative or a very small amount to be used. The alternative they use can by very empowering. Plus the texture of it is not all that appealing. So for those of you that are picky about texture, I would say to order with a minimal amount of the cheese alternative. 

For dessert I ordered a vegan/gluten free tiramisu cake which was delicious! I'm a sweets person and I could hardly tell the difference between this vegan tiramisu and the real deal. It was somewhat dryer than the original version, but still was great for taste.",2VRm_CdHzFRVSb22IblKqA,8,3,5,BJlXnN8OQQIVBdohEN9qhQ

You would think after the cookie brigade they would be gracious for any customers that came in but no.  We ordered a vegan pizza and vegan nachos.  The waiter took our order with an attitude of 'do you know wht you want or not?'  Shocked I placed the order and we waited 25 minutes for the food.  The waiter came over and said the food would be right out.  Still waiting he came back 5 minutes later and said the nachos were made with regular cheese and it would be 10 more minutes!  I was furious.  I asked about the pizza and he said that was ready and brought it out.  It looked disgusting with the piles of daiya cheese not melted.  I asked for the manager.  5 minutes later she came over and tossed the nachos down on the table.  I told her how disgusted I was and she said,  'well the food is correct now.  Do you want it or not?'  I showed her the pizza and she said daiya does not melt.  I corrected her as we use it daily and she again with a horrible attitude asked if I wanted the nachos.  My husband and I looked at each other and we left.  I used to go here all the time but the attitude is the worst I have ever experienced.",OZridIkufRtDQ5CeF2MdmQ,2,0,1,scRNSj2dHpytGnQSgL2zgw

I think it was because it was close to closing time and they were running out of everything. The second time, I got a sandwich wrap (came with a salad!) and the BEST double fudge vegan chocolate cake with the thickest, most wonderful frosting. I'm adding two stars just for that cake.",RYjt1X8Plwayx0cf6aLobA,2,0,4,5_rHSdFs-QKjJ0F-yxvtKQ

My dining partner and I began with the fire fries entrée, consisting of baked potatoes of various color, hot sauce, Pico de Gallo, and vegan cheese - these were some pretty tasty potatoes, I'm a fan!  So I narrowed my choice of entrée down to the paninis and went with the recommendation of the waiter, the California Panini.  It was a good sandwich overall, but the fake turkey was made with the popular fake meat brand from Asia (if you know of the product name, please let me know), a fake meat that I am in no way a fan of.  I picked the fake meat off and was left with tomatoes and avocados, still good but not substantial.  The food is truly good here and I will go again, but next time I will order the veggie panini.",4iOc4Fo-h6gZ-2zAJEM78g,1,0,4,KAjFhEfL48TEwWyw-_pwBg

My friend's and I go to Fashion Show Mall and the Sahara location just for the amazing chocolate chip cookies. It's hard to believe this delicious creation is actually vegan and not even that bad for you, with only 27 calories and half a gram of fat per cookie, you can eat all 6 that come in a $5.50 box and only have to add 160 calories to your total for the day. The cakes are all amazing and if you ever see the brownies, buy 2 because they are wonderful when you let them heat them up. The shrimp orzo salad is delectable and all of the meals are under 450 calories.",-4r4te348-Sg-v__TLDnng,2,0,5,vIAMpbx9W8LCGxrucXMB_w

The place is a little confused about whether it's a sit down restaurant or an order at the counter joint but the manger tried very hard to please and came over a few times to make sure everything was alright.  My sandwich was delicious and so was my wife's.  The chocolate cake for dessert was warmed up for us and absolutely delicious and dairy free!  

I would definitely go back here on a return trip and recommend the restaurant to veganites and non-vegans alike.",72sDyd8DWp-wPRjon6ZQpA,1,1,4,Pui-aqWw0y8T8JnNrxpvKA
