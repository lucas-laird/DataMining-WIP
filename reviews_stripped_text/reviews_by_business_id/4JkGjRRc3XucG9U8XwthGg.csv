I have NEVER experienced either bad service or bad food either the delivery order or inside the restaurant. This is one of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. If you eat in, the service is great, food is ready quickly and is always fresh and tasty. Their pot stickers  are some of the best I've found in the area (and I eat Chinese food a lot), and the Orange Chicken & General Tso's Chicken are delicious. The Mongolian beef is another one of my favorites, and when you order this dish, you get enough food for at least 2  meals.If you like Chinese food and haven't been to China gourmet,, it's definitely worth checking out.

I called ahead to place my order and was told it would be ready in 5 minutes!  Wow... I was expecting 15-20 minutes!  When I got there, the place was clean and the staff was friendly and attentive.  Now I love Mu Shu Pork, and while not the absolute best I've had (at far more expensive places), this wasn't too far off!  For $8.25 the order came with a large carton of Mu Shu Pork, a large carton of steamed rice, four wraps, and the coveted Plum Sauce.  I ate two stuffed wraps with some rice on the side, stuffed the last two wraps for later, and still had slightly under 1/2 carton of Mu Shu and a ton of rice left.  For $8.92 with tax, you can easily feed 2-3 people delicious Mu Shu Pork - try doing that at Panda...

Anyway,,We love, love, love it here. lovely food, lovely chef and lovely service.
And the prices are unbeatable. Every time I see my check is less than 20 bucks, I feel like I've stolen from them, like, with prices this low, how can they still be in business?

955076,2017-06-14,0,4JkGjRRc3XucG9U8XwthGg,"Chinese food for me is my comfort haven and I will spend a high dollar amount to have the best, if need be. But, either I've been looking in the wrong places or quality Chinese food just doesn't exist in Las Vegas. I'm originally from California and I never had this problem out there. I just have to have the best when it comes to something I love so much, especially if I'm spending my money on it because there's nothing like coming out of pocket for food that is sub par or below average.  So anyways, I've been searching for ""authentic"" good tasting Chinese food since my arrival to Vegas 10 years ago. I've been going to China Gourmet for about 2 years now, switching up and trying new Chinese restaurants in between. Never again. Nope. I'm always left disappointed when I branch out to the other places. None of the Chinese food places I've gone to comes even remotely close to China Gourmet. From my knowledge of what constitutes real Chinese food, China Gourmet is as close as you'll get. 

I ordered Shrimp chow mein, Shrimp fried rice, General tso chicken, 4 egg rolls, Crab Rangoon, and because I used a coupon that I received in the mail, I was able to get a free appetizer. I chose the butterfly shrimp.

Normally I get my food delivered (they deliver) but decided to pick up this time since I was in the area. I was greeted when I walked in and the employees were nice enough. I was told the wait time would be between 10 and 20 minutes. I believe my order was ready within 15 minutes, so brownie points there. 


When I got home, I didn't eat right away, but rather 3 or 4 hours later, and guess what? The food,(ALL OF IT) was still piping hot!!! I was super impressed. 

The shrimp chow mein was very flavorful. Not too many veggies, the shrimp were plentiful and large, and most importantly, it tasted like traditional chow mein! The noodles are on the large side, which I do not like, but all in all, great dish. The shrimp fried rice is super good! Love it. As with the chow mein, there is no shortage of the shrimp they give you in the shrimp fried rice. Also, I need to add that the portions are enormous! Seriously, you get so much of everything. The general tso chicken is really good too. Not as spicy as I'd like, but still very good. The egg rolls are large, have crispy wrappers, and the veggie mixture inside is not mushy. I love to eat them with the red sweet and sour sauce they give you. Crab Rangoon was my favorite of the appetizers. They've got a kind of sweet taste to them, but not overpowering. A must try for sure. The butterfly shrimp, I didn't enjoy too much and probably wouldn't order again. They are decent in size but a little flavorless and not crispy. But, they were free so I ate them. 

As I mentioned above, I've been ordering from China Gourmet for a while now, and I've also tried other dishes they offer, which include honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. All of these are amazing!! And don't forget you get large portions here!!! 

China Gourmet is it if you want great tasting Chinese cuisine. Delivery times are reasonable, wait times for pick up is fast, and price wise, you can't go wrong...very affordable for the portions you get.

I should also add that this is a dine in restaurant too. It's located next to the Smith's and Starbuck's on Nellis and Sahara. It's small, but plenty of seating is available. 

Check them out!!",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,4,PWE3dKhvYAXahHXBJmojHg

1. Order
Wontons:  Awesome!
Cheese Ragoons:  Pretty good.
Egg Rolls:  Not a fan and one more try.
Cashew Chicken: Great!
Sesame Chicken:  Not good when you took a bite you could really taste the flour and you could feel the flour texture in your mouth.  Wont get it again 
Rice:  Great.

2.  Order Family Deal B:
Egg Drop Soup:  Wife thought it was good... I am not much of a fan of any kind so I reserve judgement.
Egg Rolls:  2 nd time no good
Wontons:  Awesome
Ragoons:  Great
Cashew Chicken:  Great
Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Awesome! I like the fact they keep the sauce off till after delivery.
Rice:  Good but we were short an order.

3.  Three Entree Order
Wontons:  Free and delicious 
Chow Main:  Seemed a lot like lomein and never thought I would say this but they for sure do not use MSG and you can tell in this dish.  It was just missing a little bit of that butterness that you get with MSG.  But it was OK had worse had better probably wont order again.
Sweet & Sour Chicken:  Awesome our number one dish
Orange Chicken:  Same exact issue we had with the Sesame chicken.  Could really taste that flour and felt the flour texture.

We are OK with experimenting with more the prices are not bad and so it is OK at least one dish is always good to eat.",33Jz09jA9L3ycpMG4mVsdw,0,0,4,MrJ9kEVoAwtrQWxZouf8Rg

The few times I did pick up my order the place was well kept and on the smaller side, but nice. I had my lunch break coming up this past Monday plus the place is near so Chinese it was! 

Every time I had delivery the food came faster than the quoted arrival time, huge plus! Not really something I would count on every time but you can be sure they will be on time or earlier. This time around I ordered their lunch special which runs from 11am to 4pm. It's your choice of entree with fried rice and chow mien on the side. For the entree I had sweet and sour pork. The entire meal was good. I like that the sweet and sour sauce is served in a styrofoam side container, rather than already being mix before serving. Most the time I don't order this because it could come with too much sauce. I only used a little sauce and it made me have some control of my meal, win. The pork came fried and was still crunchy and hot after delivery.

I'm so happy they opened right across the street from Panda Express too, show those orange chicken cooking Mexicans what's good!  Fresh must be my word of the day because that's what this place is!

THE PROS:
Great food, cooked to order. A few random Chinese specialties that you don't see at all typical take out places. 
No MSG. 
Good prices including lunch and family specials. (Take that Panda!) 
Sweet people (they called me princess Di, aww) 

THE CONS: 
The location
And the sweet people, don't understand much English. 
I drove all the way home, you know across the street, because I was $2 short. Only to find out once I returned it was simply a miss-communication and my bill was $27 not $37. Either way when the lady counted out $35, she should have not let me leave. They were very apologetic. The food indeed made up for it.

Thanks Yelp for once again helping me to find a great place to eat anywhere.

This place is not fancy but it is  clean and you can bring the family. Take out is the best.

The style here is Hong Kong food. Everything was rich and flavorful.

I can tell that it is a family run place. The kids do the front and wait service. The older folks do the cooking in back.

The place is open so you can see the entire process.

It's conveniently located down the street from my house and next to Food 4 Less so I can go and grab a few groceries on the way home as well.  I came here on a whim one day because I saw one of their fliers in between all the other junk mail and ads.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the quick service!  Granted, the first time I visited was the same week that they opened so it wasn't too busy and they managed to hook about one or two other people to try their food while I was there but I tend to believe it's still somewhat of a secret.  The first time here I opted for the Black Bean Shrimp plate and it was actually pretty killer (better than most of the Chinese eats in my area but I dare not mention any names haha).  The second time around I ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and was appeased again.  Both times my food came with Egg Drop Soup, Wonton Crackers, and a couple of Egg Rolls.  Plus, they give you a whole plate (yes a whole regular sized plate) of just rice!  So awesome!  I left both times happy and full.  The price was actually pretty good as well and they also offer lunch specials for the run-and-go cheap eats peeps out there.  I will definitely come back to visit again and I hope the quality of the food doesn't diminish in the future and end up another one of those ""fast food"" joints that fade into the background.

Not many Chinese places make the crispy chicken for the sweet n sour sauce.  It is very rare to find the two not already mixed. I personally, love it when it is not already mixed.  This location, makes it just that way.  

Since it was late and last minute we only had 3 items.  Sweet n sour chicken, white rice and orange chicken.  Everything was good!  Above good, excellent.  This will be one of 2 of my favorite Chinese spots in Vegas so far.  I particularly, like the sweet n sour sauce recipe they use. It is not watered down and a more vibrant red than most.

The food is delicious, they give very generous portions, and my daughter loves their food! If they can get my picky two year old to eat, I'm happy. We love this restaurant.",G69bboYuOJtlV_XFvxVfmQ,1,1,5,fimbr20q7tQTzrBVzFTUqg

Most Chinese restaurant I've gone to, when I order the Mongolian Beef they put a lot of onions and veggies, not so much meat.. When I ordered it at this place got a lot of meat, decent amount of veggies and it was very good.. DEF will b coming back..",s7R2BWlYkNOKTv4j43HjjA,0,0,5,cBaENKuHRnnz_2f-zPa1Cg

The ""crunchy"" roll was more soggy and sad than anything so I didn't even bother eating it.",rD2aPn_ZYbEZbPc40wok5Q,0,0,1,nr_K7oVrGdF79h6JG160qg
5826804,2014-11-20,0,4JkGjRRc3XucG9U8XwthGg,My husband and I usually eat here on the weekends. The fried rice is very tasty as is the chicken with broccoli.  I ordered the moo goo pai one time. It was very watery and tasteless.  The service and staff is very nice.,dkwvaUylGF1sZ1YUe5Q1Dg,0,0,4,hGn81KM7BZhYCOStXLcOvA

They are always polite and look hard  at  work.  I've never gotten something I didn't like from here.,571JK5iN0QTda9A8keTWVQ,1,1,5,vzL_W3UB_7ivmBG9IktfdQ

Perhaps, I was living in Hong Kong too long and had experienced true Chinese cuisine?
Ordered Egg Foo Yung, in return I received something so awful, the brown sauce was thick and starchy with out a taste nor flavor, the egg foo had so many culinary disasters.
I would never be able to forgive them on such a simple dish.
Try San Francisco China town for some real delights!",F2av57ztcbYiPADtT-YpdA,0,0,1,UsCpKqit7fmBtL5NFdvabg

The staff are hard-working and friendly and eager to satisfy your requests. What you lack in Ambiance, the restaurant more than makes up for Quality and flavor",esyj0rVb_yIxHe6IBSMLgQ,0,0,4,QeAcUL4hWqjRfVqu8ThyTA

I mean...ethnicity charts do indicate this zip code to have under 5% of Asians...so that's expected I suppose.  Hence my somewhat generous rating for China Gourmet.  It's the most Asian Chinese restaurant I've found in North Las Vegas...so far.   Upon opening the doors, I see employees and customers who are all Asian--a rare sight around this area.  Looking at the menu, I see a large variety of options--both authentic and Americanized options.

This place is pretty good considering the gigantic portions!  I came here during the weekday for lunch and got one of the lunch special items: kung pao combination ($6.75).  It came with shrimp, beef, and chicken.  It had plenty of veggies and protein with plenty of flavor (maybe too much?).  The rice was okay.  The chow mein was a bit better.  The meal came with an egg drop soup that had corn in it.  It was pretty good with nice consistency.  As for the drinks, I wouldn't recommend the honeydew fruit slush with boba ($3.50) though--it tastes very artificial, but the tapioca balls themselves were chewy and tasty.  I might try a safer option like a non-fruit drink next time.  

Overall, I'll come back.  Until then, I will slave away in my residency program until I get to see sunlight again.",p2qFjnQKIZVi7qdj-B31iw,4,4,4,070UUHE1stJma5JBhEjPPA
