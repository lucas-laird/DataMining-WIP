I opted for take-out; I loved the sweet rack of ribs - they were exactly the type of ribs I love.  Sweet and a bit sticky and tangy, with fall-off-the-bone meat.  I give the ribs 4-1/2 stars on their own, I'd give 5 if not for the high cost of a full rack.  These were cooked perfectly.  I can't think of any ribs I'd had in Las Vegas that I enjoyed as much as these.

The sliced turkey breast ordered in lieu of smoked chicken was ok, and the angus cheddar burger was good. For sides, the baked beans were very enjoyable as were the onion rings.  I didn't care much for the dill potato salad but I would go back again just for the waitresses - who would get 10 stars.

This place used to be a hangout for Chicago fans, ""unfortunately"" the new owner is a Packers fanatic.

Went back 12/7 to try the sliced brisket sandwich and fries.  Absolutely loved it!",ifmlIRu3u8sgwMagAoN2Eg,3,1,4,4yvk8R-_cdzgMcS5OMysug

Had high hopes seeing the big smoker outside but the meat was dry as paper. Service sucked and the manger wasnt available to address the problem. Not to mention the resturant was dead inside.

The manager was super nice and so was everyone that was working that day.  The only problem I think was the food didn't match the service.

I will not waste my time or money to return to this place the only good thing was the fries and they weren't that good.

3167874,2014-12-09,8,4OeBE57Hs4WMLOTtT32d1Q,"Why? Why? Why...can we not get more solid BBQ here? Has Vegas been cursed by some sort of barbecue hating devil? Have the BBQ Gods no mercy on Sin City? I really just don't get it. But before I self-explode, let me explain...

Bubba D's is a brand new BBQ joint located inside the Town Center Lounge on Sky Pointe, just off Ann & the 95. I'm not super familiar with this lounge, but I do know from driving by it everyday that the restaurant inside has seen its fair share of changes. Not long ago, a breakfast place used to be here that I had bookmarked, and never got to try. According to Bubba D's, they shut down due to allowing guests under 21 to dine-in. Because they share the space with a lounge who's ceilings are 28 feet high, and it's way ""too expensive"" for them to legally block off the area, this is strictly a 21 and over spot. So, for families with children, you're stuck with takeout only. I don't want to fault them much for the location, as I'm sure they're just working with what they can, but I really question why a BBQ joint would pick this spot. Even if I had been at this bar drinking beforehand, I'm not sure I would've wanted to spend that much money on what is technically just bar food. 

Much like other bars, the menu is larger, this one just focuses on BBQ. Obviously there's classic choices like meat plates and sandwiches, but they also have some unique items like giant potatoes, tacos and even burritos. Tons of sides are available, although some are only available a-la carte, and there's a separate ""To Go By The Pound"" menu as well. In my opinion, pricing is flawed and kind of all over the place. A 1/2lb of brisket alone starts at $10, yet a burrito or potato that they proudly display as weighing over 1lb, with brisket, is only $12. Sure, there's other ingredients in these, but how small are they making the meat portions? And because sides are separate, most of which you can not order with the combos, the bill can get rough. We only ordered 2 combo plates with 1 dessert, no drinks or extras, and our to-go bill was just a few cents under $40. I have no problem paying for good BBQ, we all now how much meat is, but they've got a lot of work to do. Here's what we got...

I'll start with sides. All borderline terrible in my opinion. The coleslaw was either packaged, or made with a very generic cookbook. No flavor at all, and way too watery. Potato salad was just as bad flavor-wise, and I swear they put rosemary in it. It just didn't work. Then sadly, my most anticipated side of all was the smoked beans, and they were probably the worse. I had to scoop some up to take the photo, but most of the container was liquid. And that liquid tasted like straight up smoke water. Imagine taking a cup of water and leaving it in a smoker for hours upon hours, then sipping on it. I love me some smokey flavor, but whoa!

Hoping the meat would make up for the lackluster sides, we dug in, and were let down with just about everything. I ordered a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and sausage, Lore ordered a 2 meat with ribs and pulled pork. They don't offer a classic hot link, but do have locally sourced sausages made just for them. My pick for the sausage was jalapeño, and tasted like just about nothing. It was drowned in sauce, which is most likely why, but I'll get back to the sauce. Both the brisket and pulled pork seemed to be smoked great. The meat wasn't overly smokey, you could taste a bit of seasoning in them, and they were tender with nice little crispy burnt-endish pieces. Unfortunately, the ribs were probably the worst of all. I'm no smoking expert, but they seemed to be cooked at too high of a temperature, way too fast. The outside was burnt black, yet parts of the inside seemed undercooked. It had a raw meat look and texture. And I'm not talking about the pink from smoke rings. 80% of the rack got trashed. 

But here's the thing, I can honestly say this was my first ever backwards BBQ experience. In most cases, the meat at joints is what's lacking, but you can get enough sauce on them to make it taste okay. But Bubba D's is the only place I've been too where it was the complete opposite, and I wished there was no sauce on most of the stuff, like the brisket and sausage. This sauce is bad. Really bad. I'm not sure if the photos will do it justice, but the only thing I can compare it to is some sort of old, canned marinara/pizza sauce. It's thick, it's tomatoey, and it seriously ruined every piece of meat on all our plates. The ribs couldn't be saved, so that's another story. But I'm not even sure what sauce we got either. We weren't offered a choice (even though there's 3 on the menu), and we attempted to get as much of it off the meat before we ate to try figuring it out. 

I hate giving places like this such a bad review, but this was just bad food. The friendly owners and service is worthy of 2 stars, but I can't say the same for the eats.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,14,7,2,o9QxfUkOTBfnHucJhXEpGg
3578880,2014-12-04,4,4OeBE57Hs4WMLOTtT32d1Q,"Phe-nom-inal with an extra ""nom nom"" because you want to keep eating.  Inside the Town Center Lounge so if it wasn't for the massive smoker outside you would think typical Vegas Tavern Food, but it most definitely  is not! Stepping inside you are greeted by a quick service vibe with order at the counter and take a number type of service.  No sweat, efficient and I don't have to wait for the attractive blond to bring my beverage.

Food was on the table (sliced brisket sandwich - $11) before I was finished filling my green tea.  Immediately I reached for one of their BBQ sauces and remembered ""Nick you have to taste before you douse"".  Needless to say I put the BBQ sauce back and all I was left with was wanting to get another sandwich!  All and all, will be back, must come back! I'm even going to throw it out there, better than Road Kill Grill. 

Basically Bubba's brings a big Texas bite to this little Vegas watering hole.",MC7c4JRnVAuQBrvEoeoBYA,3,0,5,pYTNs-jJmfKDHEcDjbqGPw

The smells coming from the smoker in the parking lot were the best thing about this place. The other half and I were craving some ribs and still are. The ones we got (one ordered sweet, the other regular) were dry and overcooked. They've stopped drowning them with sauce, and give it to you on the side instead, but I'm not sure that is an improvement. Sides were, as another reviewer put it, grocery store deli quality; edible but lacking  anything really special, like flavor. The service was good :/ 

As the GF put it - the only thing that smoker is good for is smelling while sitting in the parking lot reliving  memories of the last  good BBQ you had!",CmtOa1GmDKPFpOH9kZ6j5g,1,0,2,Qp8acVpIUWicYowNP81CXQ

The service was good but that was not enough to make me go back. The BBQ sauce was watery. The brisket had no flavor and the only way I could get the macaroni salad down was to cover it in black pepper. Was so displeased would never go back. we had an appetizer of fried pickles those were OK. Thank goodness the bar had happy hour going on at the time.

Beware, the meats come smothered in sauce. You have to ask for no sauce so you can sauce your own. The sauces were mediocre. My ribs were hard on the outside and not in a good way. 
 Ordered both the regular and jalapeño corn bread. The regular was like a crumbly dense flavorless cake. The jalapeño was the exact same piece with a whole jalapeño cooked on top. Come on, take the time to slice up the jalapeño and mix it with some roasted corn into the batter. It tasted like Jiffy cornbread mix.
 The beans were ok. They were a bit overdone but had chunks of meat for flavor which redeemed them a little bit. The potato salad was the best thing about my dinner, on par with a store deli counter salad, didn't taste homemade. 
 The waitress was sweet and I hope she finds a new job soon. I can't see this place lasting much longer. Sad because Vegas needs more good BBQ.",90wlZyvIK48a-74fDThhMA,1,1,2,QrWZVtWTqBc0PjecFtfXyg
5139958,2014-12-01,10,4OeBE57Hs4WMLOTtT32d1Q,"#500 review!!!

I've been trying to save #500 for a noteworthy contestant, but I haven't quite ran into anything outstanding for a few months :(

With that being said, my neighborhood bar/lounge recently had ANOTHER restaurant ownership change, and since it wasn't on Yelp yet, I figured I would do the honors....too bad, it's not a very positive review.

First of all, the main reason I believe they continue having issues with the restaurant side of their business is the fact that the interior shares a half-wall with the neighboring bar which allows cigarette SMOKE to linger. It's not nearly as noticeable today in comparison to the pizza restaurant that resided a couple months ago due to the fragrant meats and sides, but still bothersome to most non-smokers.

Before I start on the food, let me first point out that this is GOOD BAR FOOD...just not great BBQ.  Let me clarify, if I was sitting at the bar watching the game, I'd be hard pressed to find much better bar counter food ordering selectively from the menu.  But compare this to the better BBQ spots in town, and you'll leave unimpressed...especially given their price point.

I ordered the Combo Platter: ""Sweet"" Ribs, Pulled Pork, Smoked Beans & Mac Salad. Ribs were TERRIBLY OVERCOOKED, blackened crispy & dry. Bones were BRITTLE & actually BROKE APART when given little effort. The Pulled Pork was good though, crunchy bits and smokey undertone, with the only complaint being the sauce too SWEET for my tastes. Smoked beans were a nice change from the norm, but the mac salad was forgettable.

Also tried the Chopped Brisket, Baked Beans & Coleslaw. Brisket was DROWNED in sweet bbq sauce that masked all the smokey flavor that was hiding inside. Beans were run-of-the-mill but enjoyable.  Coleslaw tasted like raw cabbage and water.  Where is the vinegar...sugar...flavor? 

And last but not least, the Fried Pickles. Some pieces were a bit salty and overcooked, but most were tasty and well done. 

To summarize, if you are in the area looking for a good place to watch the game & some good bar food (and don't mind the smoke), this would be an great choice given what we have in the Northwest.  If you are looking for the best BBQ in Vegas, you won't find it here.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,15,11,2,0v0yl1zgFqJppNSQFHU0zA

I came in today, ordered chopped brisket because sliced was unavailable and had the pulled pork. The pulled pork was terrible. Dry, chopped instead of pulled, drenched in a poor quality sauce. I did not enjoy it. The brisket was OK, the only part of the experience deserving any stars, but drenched in BBQ sauce. In Texas they let you add your own sauce. I feel like they were compensating for poor quality preparation. The Cole slaw was dry, the dressing was watery and pooled at the bottom of the cup. The baked beans had little flavor and were too soft from being cooked too long. Not worth the price at all. Go to Road Kill just a mile or so away to get something amazing, twice the food at the same price and as good as anything I have had in Texas.",5uFncIskfmLIV1FI-dNY5Q,3,0,2,AVu8GwfWUW2InmsAR5TRJA
