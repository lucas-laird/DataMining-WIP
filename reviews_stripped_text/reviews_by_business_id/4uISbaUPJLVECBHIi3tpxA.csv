This casual dining pan-asian restaurant at the Encore doesn't fail to deliver on taste with their combinations of ingredients and flavors .  They have a large and effective sushi/sashimi selection with a great selections of entrees, starters, rice and noodle dishes.

I would recommend dining family style as everyone can get a taste of all the dishes.  Ordering a rice dish, along with a noodle dish, a couple dishes from their starters, and a couple from their specialties menu.  Try the sea bass and black cod, you won't regret it.

He had the Tom Yum (very good) while I had the spicy sweet chicken wings (for some reason I was on a chicken wing binge 2 days in a row!).  The wings were finger lickin' good  and I could have eaten another order easily!  I had to refrain as we were due at Michael Mina in 3 hours and I didn't want to spoil my appetite!

Case in point - I ordered a bento box for lunch with teriyaki beef, white rice, seaweed salad and a mixed greens salad.  All of those things sound pretty dull, but they hit the ball out of the park.  The mixed greens salad had a chili/mint dressing that was incredible.  The beef was tender and prepared very well with a tasty sauce.  Would love to go back sometime and try some other things.

FYI, the drunken noodles w/ chicken was featured on Food Network - didn't try it this trip, but given the skills on display, I'd expect it to be excellent.",_gjKuFxdQSLPrf6fYSiUwg,0,0,4,LDp3HoVQmFSwKHCTM2ejOw

Hamachi Chili:  wouldn't recommend this, the Hamachi was good and fresh and the plate looked beautiful but there wasn't much flavor or heat and it was just like eating sashimi which is fine but this was suppose to be a special plate and was overpriced for the result we got.

Not terribly overpriced and absolutely excellent quality and freshness.  All in all we were quite satisfied with our meal and went off happy.

213595,2010-08-23,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"This place was a huge letdown in addition to being overpriced.  

We went here while starving for lunch and read the menu outside the restaurant which sounded great- nothing uniquely special, typical thai-japanese dishes but we looked forward to ordering dishes that we were already familiar with.

Put in our names, hostess said it wouldn't take more than 15-25minutes max.  She took our cell phone number and said they would call when it was ready.  We checked back 30 minutes later after no call, still no table.  Another 20 minutes later and now even more starving, they finally seated us- they had never even called us to tell us our table was ready.  Not sure if they may have written the number down wrong.

So after the 50 minute wait to be seated we already knew what we wanted.
Salmon skin rolls, pad thai, mongolian beef, bok choy, miso soup, and a thai crepe dessert.

The salmon skin rolls were fishy and not up to par of what my friends were used to at other japanese restaurants.  Even though they were starving they didn't even want to finish the rolls.

The pad thai was AWFUL! The only good thing about it was the giant shrimp that came with it.  Couldn't pinpoint what exactly made it so bad but that was another dish that went unfinished.

Bok choy was good but how badly could a nice restaurant like this one mess up a stir fry vegetable dish?

Mongolian beef was the only main dish that was good.  

After trying all the main dishes we cancelled the crepe dessert in fear of getting served another plate that was another disaster version of a favorite dish!

The only upside was the service and the thai iced tea.

Such a disappointment for a restaurant that should have been a high quality meal in one of vegas's nicest new casino additions.
Hoping we came on an off day, the server said that sometimes the dishes vary depending on the chef.  Unfortunately I don't intend on going back to find out if that's true.",5t0cC9ypbn-qf49QFiehXw,1,0,2,3GxjOLeHr-vSQHrjY2fghg

The panang curry was also good.  Spice level was accurate for what was requested.  A few suggestions to the restaurant:  1) too much coconut milk in the curry.  try cutting back a bit as it was too milky.  2)  add more vegatables to the curry or cut back on the sauce.  3)  if you're going to serve curry, then the rice should be included with the dish.  I've not been to an Asian/Thai restaurant where the rice was extra (particularly since they're charging $5 for the bowl on top of the curry).  Rice is inexpensive, include it in the meal.

We love Encore and Wynn hotels, they are our favorite in Vegas and wanted to have dinner in one of them.  Wow, really wish I hadnt.  First, since I tend to ramble, let me put it out there clearly upfront.  I woke up at 5am the next day with one of the worst food poisionings Ive had ever.  No joke!  The only other thing I had to eat that day besides wazuzu was a sandwich and that didnt make me sick.  

Back to the beginning - after reading the reviews I decided to try the drunken noodles.  Hubby got beef chow fun.  We also got some potstickers.  Well - if you love potstickers like I do...dont get these.  Im almost positive from the taste of them, thats what made me sick.  Plus my husband didnt eat what I ate at dinner and he wasnt sick - and we shared the sandwich at lunch which is why im positive it wasnt lunch either.  Anyhow, he said his chow fun was ok.  Mine was just not good all around.  For $70 bucks down the drain it was really just horrible.  Waking up as sick as I did the next day - and being in fear of throwing up on my flight home, made this experience i wont forget, or forgive.  Never going here again.

Our appetizers (2 orders of dim sum) took about 15 minutes to come out, which seemed like a little long but I didn't mind.

Our drunken noodles with tofu was amazing,  not spicy at all (we said we wanted a 2/5) and the free vegan brownie with chocolate sorbet was also good, however I probably wouldn't order the dessert again if it wasn't free.

The other thing about this place is that the servers come in and check just at the right time to change chopsticks or silverware, which is key.  The price is not bad considering it's in Encore.

The service here is amazing. Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about each dish and answered all of our questions and provided recommendations when asked. I also had a great chat about what beers he would recommend. I asked him about micro brews and he gave me a detailed run down on each. 

Decor was great. Atmosphere was busy without being loud with a huge crystal dragon on the wall. The front of the restaurant looks out into the casino so it's great for people watching.

The food was great. We each had some appetizers which were delicious but the drunken noodles were amazing. Each bite tasted different from the last and the portions are huge. In fact, you could probably get by splitting an order between two people. 

On my next trip to vegas I will make the trip to the north end of the strip just to eat here again.  Especially the drunken noodles.

The dish was good the noodle weren't over cooked and a had a fair amount of chicken.  But not great.

Maybe I didn't try the right things. Or maybe I just had too high of expectations. But whatever the reason...I WAS SO. DISAPPOINTED.

I had really high hopes coming into this place and perhaps that was my downfall. But I mean, after my friends raved on and on about it and seeing Chef Jet Tila perform on Iron Chef, how could I not be? I just kept thinking 'Damn, Tila's gonna blow my mind with some Pan-Asian FUSION!'...but no. Far, far from it...

Panang Curry with Roasted Duck (recommended by the Server): It's whatevs. Very heavy on the coconut milk, not enough spices. Decent amount of duck but the duck was just ok. Would've been better if the skin was crispy and it was placed on top of the curry instead of cooked in it but at least it wasn't super greasy. Nothing special though.

Vege Pad-Thai: This had to be one of the worst pad-thai's I've ever tried in my life. Other than a slight sour taste from the lime slice I squeezed in, it was heavily under seasoned and the bits of tofu just blended in with all the other bland things. 

Drunken Noodles: Pretty good flavor. Really not bad but WAAAAY too salty for my tastes, which is saying a lot since I usually like quite a bit of salt.

The Thai Iced Tea, however, was SUPER YUMMY!! Made the legit way with tea on the bottom and cream on the top, served in the perfect sized/shaped glass...mmMmmMmm...thick, flavorful, deliciousness!

As a side note, awesome crystal dragon decor and I did get to meet/take a picture with Tila (who was very humble and chill). So that was pretty cool.

I understand why everyone photographs the crystal dragon, those are probably not just for Yelp, those are for the photo album and on permanent display.  It's hard to awe in Vegas, where everything is just trying to outdo everything.  But this space does stand out.  Because it is open to the lobby, the red is not overpowering.  And actually, that openness is partly a detraction.  I was seated at a table right where I could see everyone walking by.  A bit of a distraction, that was.  The staff was able to provide me with some gluten-free dishes.  I also had high quality and delicious green tea.  I found the food to be a bit pricy, even considering the location within a high-end (even for Vegas) hotel.  But since I had just dropped a month's rent in the spa, I was for a moment immune to the sticker shock.  It was much later, perusing the credit card bill, that I said, ""That lunch cost HOW much?

Beyond the dragon (or perhaps including), the decor is a bit over the top with all the red and gold, but let's remember that this is Vegas, so I am not entirely surprised.

Like everything at the Wynn/Encore, I feel like the restaurants are about 25% too expensive for the food, but because that is to be expected, I cannot in good conscience factor that into the rating.  The prices are what I expected to pay.

For lunch, we had some edamame (pretty standard, nothing remarkable either way), a california and a spicy tuna roll (solidly good, fresh ingredients, fresh rice), and a bbq eel rice bowl.

For me the flavors were all there. I'm sure that anyone who likes really authentic Panang curry, as my cousin does, wouldn't enjoy it as much but I really liked it and still crave it sometimes. 

The rice it came with wasn't too sticky or fluffy either, which is always a fear when you get East Asian rice. The prices here are about in line with Osha in SF and you get pretty much the same amount of food. In fact, the second night we were in Vegas I had the leftover panang curry and went downstairs to get some rice to-go from Wazuzu and had that for dinner.

Korean Ribs - This was awesome and smelled sooo good when they brought it out.  In fact, the server brought it to the table next to us and that was the reason why I ordered it.  It smelled that good.  The meat came right off the bone.

The much acclaimed drunken noodles was a hoisin based chow fun wok dish (beef in our case), which was pretty good, I liked the fresh grape tomato and other veggies with the noodles - and the noodles themselves were thin and separated, and actually much better than many I've had previously, but the sauce was nothing special - heavy on the hoisin and salt and light on unique flavor.  If you have lived in SF you have likely tasted better for 1/3 the price.  The panang curry was neither yummy nor authentic and the tom ka gai was bland, ...really really bland by SF standards (compared to nearly any SF mission district Thai spot). Sliced Serrano chiles should not define the flavor of my favorite style of soup.  The galanga/lemongrass flavors were muted or missing and straw mushroom was almost the only solid thing in this all-white soup that really shouldn't be all-white when made right.  The few mini bites of chicken I dredged up from the bottom was downright plain.  We finished the soup, and when the noodles and curry came we had a few bites of each and felt full, but unimpressed.  Took it to go, and did have some of the cold noodles later when hunger returned, but dumped the curry.  Forgot to diss the curry properly.  It had a small amount of curry paste, more like a pink rendang curry, not a deep full red panang style at all.  It was overly thickened with corn starch, so it tasted mostly of canned coconut milk and bland boiled chicken.

Brown rice option for the health conscious like myself. Salmon melted in my mouth. Some of the sauces have soy in them (beware to the gluten-free aficionados like my sister). And the spicy sauces are actually spicy (for those with a sensitive palate like my mother).

1483057,2011-09-26,3,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"What should have been an hour dinner took two and a half hours. We did a whole lotta waiting. 

Not that I didn't want to spend some quality time with my lovely companion (who works in the casino, and yes they knew this ahead of time which makes this all the more ludicrous), but the insane wait time and overall awkwardness was just too much to bear and made this experience excruciating. 

We show up, and there is a 20 minute wait time. That's fine, it's a small restaurant. But as we later learned, the wait time probably could have been cut down drastically if they had decent service. Since they don't have a bar, we ran over to Society where my favorite waiter recognized us, and even though we weren't eating there sent us over some pretzels and vegan butter. A+ service there. We hoped Wazuzu would be on par since they are only 2 doors down from each other, but they were not.

We get seated, and we placed our drink order. 10 minutes pass. Jasmine tea (lovely, very fragrant) comes out and then we order our food. First problem is the vegan part of the menu - it says vegan/vegetarian menu. Some of the names of the vegan items said vegan right in the title, but a lot did not and you had to go by the ingredients to see if it was not vegan. I wish they would have split it up differently or had some sort of marking to make ordering easier. My friend ended up ordering a vegan crunch roll, and I asked for the jade dumplings and a vegan drunken noodle dish with Gardein chicken. We expected a wait time for the food, but I was getting restless already. Food came out all at once and it was lovely.  The jade dumplings are in fact a bright shade of green, and quite delicious - I loved how it was served. The crunch roll was served just like a regular sushi roll, and even though I do not have an affinity for cucumber and avocado, it was decent; the mango sauce really made it for me, however. The drunken noodles were delicious, with just the right amount of spice. I really couldn't complain with my meal. 

The one thing restaurants do that annoy me unlike no other- especially ones that have more of an upscale element - is if they aren't good at refilling water. The cups at Wazuzu are TINY so you would think they would be generously refilled at any occasion. Not so much. I had to ask for a refill, and it still took a couple minutes to come around; and when there is spicy food involved, Adina needs water NOW. We saw our waitress standing around - a lot. So much that it was very obvious. I was blown away with the lack of customer service - she did not come to ask us how we were doing once, and was very quiet. 

Plates are picked up as my friend goes off to the bathroom, and she asks if I need a box for my meal. That's it. Another 6 minutes or so passes, I get my box, and only then does she ask if we would like dessert. We were going to order immediately, but she disappeared AGAIN to get menus, dropped them off and ran off again. Son of a...

We order dessert which also takes a while, which is strange since it's pretty much pre-made. We got the vegan brownie sundae, which the ice cream looked like it had a giant thumbprint in it. Not appetizing. I still downed this like crazy, but I feel like the peanuts on top kind of kill the flavor. If the ice cream was peanut butter and not chocolate, I think it would be better; or even vanilla. It was still very tasty, but I would order it sans peanuts next time. 

Finally, the check is dropped off. And we wait. 15 minutes. She comes over and asks us if we want the check processed. THAT'S WHY WE'RE STILL SITTING HERE!! I don't know if she thought she was psychic and knew we were paying with the right amount of cash, but damn. We could have been paying with a card as well, cheese and rice! Just take it and ask if we want change or see how we're paying. Bachi Burger all over again. 

I left this restaurant infuriated. I LOVED the food, but would only order take-out from this restaurant. You couldn't pay me to sit through that horror show unless it was with Shia LaBeouf and I was dying to spend more time with him - THIS is the restaurant I would take him to. Food and decor would be 4-5 stars, but the service was -4854789547, which is a 2 -star average. I can do math!",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,4,2,2,ioOsLcaeOH0R-eAg9WEqlg

So for all that we ordered it came out to $80 with tip. Worth it? Hardly. My salad was, surprisingly, not that small but decent sized. Was it good... eh, certainly not bad, but nothing that exciting.

I really liked the salmon sashimi which was so mouth watering and good (you have to try that)...I also tried their beef which was excellent...I highly recommend this resturant although its not cheap and you have to pay about 100 dollars a person...",XohWf1XHriTzSifKiW1Vvw,0,0,5,hi5YJY6oBtDft7lo_W464Q

Food was good, not great. My favs were the pad thai and the sweet/sour crispy chicken. The sushi roll we ordered was very good too, but I can't remember the name of it. I liked the food because it wasn't super heavy like a lot of Chinese food is.

My friends were staying at the Wynn and heard several people rave about the drunken noodles at Wazuzu, which was located in the adjacent Encore hotel. I love drunken noodles, so I was on board with trying it out for lunch. First off, walking from the Wynn to the Encore hotel was no easy feat. It was so far! So, after walking for what felt like at least 20 minutes, we made it here. I love the ambience - upscale, with red as their theme color everywhere. Our waiter was attentive and would check up on us often. After eating some edamame appetizers, our entire group ordered the drunken noodles at varying levels of spice and with different meat choices (chicken, pork, or shrimp). The presentation of the noodles was beautiful, but the taste wasn't as spectacular as others have mentioned it to be. Personally, for me, there wasn't enough of the Thai basil and the ""wok hey"" flavor that I love so much when I usually eat drunken noodles. ""Wok hey"" in Chinese means the flavor that the wok imparts to the dish when stir frying. Although, I have to say the texture of the noodles and the overall flavor of the dish were pretty good. Unfortunately, If I'm going to be paying more than $20 for a noodle dish, which to me was already ridiculously priced, the dish better be out of this world good. But, sadly it wasn't. Despite it being a visually appealing restaurant, I won't be back because the famous drunken noodles dish was just mediocre and expensive for what it was. The rest of the menu was expensive as well.",GYwyxg6vZNH6S8hV2TIeRQ,2,1,3,gTSb0hgMdy1sqrpewVeDbA

The food is ok and at the end you're left with a large bill. You can get food for a fraction of the price just down the street in Chinatown and it tastes much better. With that said, you are at Encore and nothing is cheap here.

When I worked here I would comp everything & that ruined me for life because I was so spoiled. I so miss those days! Now if I'm paying over $20 for a sushi roll it better be amazing. As I said, the food is good but not mind blowing. I've had better sushi, pad thai & bbq buns. 

If you find yourself at Encore or Wynn, splurge a little more and go to Botero, SW or Wing Lei. Yes these places are pricier but I've never had anything at them that was just good. Society Cafe and La Cave are also good options if you're not interested in splurging even more.

First off, we showed up with a group of 8 for our 8pm reservation, which they claim they didn't have. Fast forward 30 mins later, we finally get a table. No apologies, no explanations, just here's your table... 

The menu is an eclectic mix of Asian cuisines. They have a mix of Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese dishes.

Since we were a large group we ordered a variety of maki rolls and dim sum. The dim sum was good and so were the maki rolls. However, at $30 a pop, I didn't notice any difference from the $6.99 rolls I can get at any hole-in-the wall sushi bar. 

For my entree, I ordered the mongolian beef, which was very well done in a nice spicy sauce. The portion was a bit too big for me.

Uni (sea urchin) on the sashimi platter was very fresh: it was noticeably sweet and freshly briny, where urchin that's past its prime gets a dull flavor. Tom yum goong (hot & sour Thai lemongrass soup) with shrimp was excellent - I ordered it full-on Thai spicy, and it indeed arrived loaded with chili oil and thinly sliced green chili pepper. The heat and sourness was well balanced, the shrimp were perfectly cooked, and you could still taste all the ingredients despite the heat.

Drunken noodles with shrimp were very good, as well. Again, large shrimp perfectly cooked. Seasoned well, with just the right amount of chili heat. Sure, it probably shouldn't cost $20+ for noodles, but it's Las Vegas. And it's tasty, and filling.

Surprisingly, everything we had was quite delicious and even better than what you can find from most establishments along Spring Mountain!!

First off, I like how the menu is influenced by various food from several Southeast Asian countries.  In this case, everybody's taste buds can be satisfied as each person can have whichever cuisine they desire; i.e., one can order Thai and the other Japanese.  

One dish worth noting is their Nasi Goreng--spicy Malaysian fried rice with shrimp, barbecued pork, lap cheong, sambal oelek and topped with a fried egg.  Not over-hyping it but it actually brought me back to my last trip in Malaysia!!  This version was actually even better especially with the sambal oelek, lap cheong and tiny dried shrimps.

Overall, Wazuzu is definitely worth the hassle going to the strip.  Due to its location, prices are steeper than your typical Pan-Asian restaurant but that won't stop us from eating delicious food.  Trying out their Drunken Noodles next time!!",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,2,1,5,IZmcwBZOlSPj8Kaj9KlixQ

Bright red walls encompass the cozy, open restaurant.  A giant crystal dragon watches over you as you debate which dishes you'll try this time.  And with that - the Hamachi Chili Sashimi was amazing.  Even the non-sushi eaters in our group loved it.  The Crunch Roll is a work of art that you want to frame rather than eat, but trust me, it's much too delicious just to look at.  The oversized Pork Potstickers with Ponzu Sauce are expertly seasoned and not greasy at all. 
For the main course - Drunken Noodles, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Thai Basil Chicken.  All three were equally impressive and the portion sizes were very generous.  The Prawns almost look as if they need a sauce, but after biting into them, you them so juicy that a sauce would only mask their true flavor.  The noodles on the other hand beg you to finish off the accompanying sauce that complements them justly.  The crisp red and green bell pepper adds a nice touch of color to the bowl.

I ordered the drunken noodles with beef, which was delivered piping hot and quick.  While not life-changing, the noodles were quite tasty. Would've preferred a bit greater proportion of noodle to beef. It's a bit heavy if it's your sole entree, but probably great for sharing.  

The loss of stars comes from the service after my food arrived. I was asked once about the status of my meal, and no acknowledgment was to be found until I waved down somebody to get my check and leftovers wrapped up.

Came for dinner Saturday and was seated promptly with the place pretty busy but not fully packed. Initially intrigued by their menu and wanted a noodle soup fix, and this place seemed to fit the bill, especially as my sister is a vegetarian. Setting and decor was very nice, with a giant crystal like dragon on the wall.

We got the jade dumplings and vegan crunch roll to start. Didn't find the rice crackers on the roll to be too appealing, but it did give a nice crunch. Loved the noodle wrapper on the dumplings but it was quite bland, even though it was packed with mushrooms and veggies.

Got the tonkotsu ramen, as sis had the veggie ramen. The noodles itself were cooked perfectly with the right amount of chew to it, but it could have been eggier in flavor. My sis didn't care too much for them, as she thought they were doughy. My egg was perfectly soft boiled. I wasn't sure how I felt about the broth. It was milky in texture, but too light in taste. My pork was also dry and did not melt in my mouth like it should. The veggie ramen was odd. It was abundant in veggies, but was a mixture of American spring salad mix and Chinese veggies. Hers was not too flavorful either.

Service was all very good. It was nice that they consistently checked to see if my jasmine green tea pot was empty. All in all, I enjoyed that everything tasted fresh and their portions were very satisfactory. They also nailed it on the textures of their food. However, for flavor, everything was quite bland. I didn't expect super authenticity or anything, but everything tasted super flat and even some salt would have helped, but I guess I would prefer something that is bland and fresh over something that is overly salty and doused in MSG.",3xibmgNSEMMtiTP2PlevhQ,2,0,3,zwRvAihPiky8aqu6eXYFDw

We've been here so many times only because of convenience, and the variety they offer on their menu, not because it's great, delicious, can't wait to have more, etc.. nothing like that. Solely for convenience purposes. ""Wazuzu at Encore offers Pan-Asian flavors inspired by Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Singaporean and Thai cuisine."" Especially convenient when one is craving say.. Chinese, and the other Thai or even Japanese.

Each time the food has been very consistent over the years, even down to plating and garnishing.

I couldn't say the same about the service. It always seemed barely there.. as though non of the servers really want to be there. It takes a while for them to drop off and top off the water, a while longer to take your order, and once the food is delivered, don't bother for any service, if you care for some, be prepared to wave someone down. They are quickest when it comes time for you to pay, each and every single time. That's suddenly when they appear, fake smile, and actually give you more water!

2332107,2014-09-02,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"Wazuzu is a good Asian restaurant that marries a fusion of Asian foods, including Chinese, Japanese and hints of Indian (I think they use curry powders and other spices on some dishes) and Thai.

The prices are in one breath high, in another breath both fair and on par with other high end restaurants.

Dinner for 2 which included 3 entrees to share and an appetizer came in at about $100 before tip, and was enough food to even feed 3 people lightly or maybe even a small group of anorexic club going girls on their way to Surrender or XS that want to nibble while still looking good in their form fitting outfits.

We had the Albacore Sashimi, which I highly recommend, for $22 the portions were good.

The Miso Black Cod featured 2 respectfully sized pieces of fish over a bed of Chinese broccoli for $30.

The Wazuzu Fried Rice had a hint of Indian spice maybe curry and had some dried shrimp, 4 large prawns, some chinese sausage and duck with pineapple mixed into flavorful jasmine rice.   It was a bit on the greaser side, not so much light and fluffy, but very tasty.  The portion size is good for $23 and enough for a few to share with other dishes.

The Vegetarian Sweet and Sour ""Chicken"" (probably soy or tofu based) is all about the sauce, so less about chicken or mimicking the taste or flavor more so than the texture and cost $17

The service was friendly.  They, I don't think take reservations, so we only waited about 20-30 mins around 10pm on a Friday Night over Labor Day Weekend, so easily killed time walking around the casino and they called us when the table was ready.

I'd say this is a great place for larger parties of 4 or more to share in multiple dishes ""family style"" to enjoy all of the diverse tasty flavors they offer on their menu.

If you're Asian and more working class Asian American, you may be taken aback at paying over $20 for Chow Fun (a dish you can get at any Chinatown for about $6), but you're not in Chinatown and this is also not ""Panda Express"" (nor P.F. Changs or Pick Up Stix or buffet styled cuisine) either and is gourmet Asian food.  Some negative naysayers may call it ""White People's Asian Food"" but it's to me, simple good if not great food without any prejudice other than the known price tag of the dishes clearly visible on the menu and available to see before you commit to dining, posted outside of the restaurant.

Someone else brought the food; I was drinking hot tea and wanted a glass of water but never got one. By the time I saw him again I was done with my food and my table was cleared by the bus boy. Mario was not the friendliest waiter I have seen in my life, to put it diplomatically. He did show up eventually to process my check.
My question to the Wynn management is this, ""how come the waiters at Wazuzu are almost all Chinese (or Asian)""? Why not employ other ethnic groups; Asians are notoriously bad waiters with a poor sense of humor, this place was not an exception. There were other ethnic groups working at Wazuzu but they were mostly bus boys or girls.
The food was not bad at all, I had the Miso Soup which was outstanding and the noodles I had were also good. I just wish they could marry the good food with great service, cordial mixed with laughter.

Although many of the dishes have familiar names, there are slight variations that make it different than your average Chinese restaurant.  The biggest difference and in my opinion where the real fusion comes in is the quality of the ingredients.  You will taste the difference in the beef, chicken and pork in every dish.  In addition to the expected Chinese dishes, they have noodle dishes, sushi and dim sum.  So whatever your craving is, you can satisfy it here.  The other fusion which was unexpected was fine dining service.  The little details like pulling out your chair, unfolding your napkin for you, walking you to the restroom instead of pointing and keeping the table clean without being intrusive all add up to a great meal and a great experience!",st5rpCdvHaBJ6XW7axsRfA,0,0,5,c23sp9kRGXpliZIIdGI8TA

2854026,2010-12-26,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"We were persuaded to visit after Giada de Laurentiis reco'd their drunken noodles as ""the best I ever ate with chopsticks"" on the Food Network. 

Despite being ""booked"" for reservations online, the hostess at Wazuzu seated us promptly for dinner on a Sunday evening. We were seated on the outer perimeter of the restaurant closest to the slot machines. 

On the table for review: 
+ Tom Yum Goong Soup - Thai hot and sour soup. Serving size is for one, but is easily split for two is AHMAZING and, aside from the Wynn Buffet, has made it to my personal ""must eat while in Vegas"" list. Perfectly balanced and well seasoned, with GIANT, tender prawns. This is the perfect cure to ANY hangover! 

+/- Drunken noodles w/ beef - drunken? why drunken? the common hypothesis being that the noodles and other sauteed fixin's are absolutely doused in sauce! Other than the celebrity chef appeal, these noodles had little remaining gusto going for them. It's not bad (not overly greasy, too spicy, or too small - definitely fares as a larger sharing dish), but it's not great. I even dare say that I've had better flat wide noodle dishes in a hole in the wall Asian restaurant in Los Angeles. Sorry Giada! 

+ Salt & Pepper Prawns - GORGEOUS. PHOTO WORTHY. WILL HAVE YOUR TASTE BUDS DANCING! TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!! For a dish that is indeed deep fried, it is perfectly crisp and light. My guilty pleasure is ordering a side of rice and scooping up the remaining fried tidbits of garlic, onion, and jalapeno and mixing it together just to get the last bits of amazingness. 

Coming back for more? ABSOLUTELY! I wish Wazuzu had other locations beside Las Vegas, I would order out from here weekly if not monthly if I could. 

Great destination for: 
* casual date 
* Asian fusion 
* when you're too lazy to walk around a buffet line
* before you hit up the slots",OfdXswOKY-hg_hQKqvC-Mg,2,1,4,ZtygtFOmNTZIrp2hQWRB3A

As luck would have it, we got in last week and i got to finally experience Wazuzu!

Ehh. It wasn't bad. I just expected better..

The Good:

- the room! That crystal dragon on the wall is incredible! How can you not appreciate that in the background as you enjoy your meal??
- the pineapple fried rice was quite tasty and I really enjoyed it!
-the roasted duck was pretty good as well.
-they serve Singha! My favorite Thai beer! 
- nice location in the Encore where you can get some great people watching/ eye candy in! lol

The not so good:

- the prices, but it is located inside the Wynn/Encore so it was to be expected
- the long wait to get our food...was borderline rediculous..
- the service was okay. Not stellar, not great. Okay. Definitely expected better from a place inside the mighty Wynn complex
- I'm so sorry-not sorry, but the drunken noodles were NOT all that. Most overhyped thing I've had since Bachi Burger (yea, I said it...bring it on)

The waiter was very attentive and carefully took our orders. The food took a while to come, but that was to be expected for such a large group.

It really didn't seem like Asian fusion to me. Coming from LA, I tend to have high expectations for Asian food and I tend to avoid Asian fusion. But I really did enjoy all the tastes and textures the food at Wazuzu had to offer.

- Northwestern Roll- spiny tuna roll, topped with salmon sashimi and wasabi tobiko caviar
Pretty typical for sushi. Nothing too fancy here. But I ordered several small dishes, so the portion size was perfect for me. But for others, I expect one would want something more substantial for a 30-dollar roll. 

- Drunken noodles with beef- Fresh rice noodles with Thai basil, sweet soy sauce, chillies and onions.
The waiter asks how spicy you want it from a scale of 1-5. I got 3 and the dish had just the right amount of spice, not noticeable after just one bite, but definitely present throughout the whole dish. This was a little heavy (everyone was extremely hungover), but I enjoyed it. The portion size was larger than the other dishes I got, so I think this would be a good entree for someone with an appetite.

- Tom Yum Rice Noodle Soup
I normally wouldn't order $17 soup from a restaurant in Vegas, but everyone was recovering from the night before and I thought soup would be the perfect cure. This soup was pungent, very well spiced and, especially in my condition, hit the spot. The serving was rather small, but I enjoyed it and didn't feel too full after. Oh yah, HUUUUGE shrimp, I likes.

Maybe not the best Asian food I've ever had, and definitely on the pricey side for small portions, but I would definitely come back here.

Like the vast majority of the upscale restaurants on the strip, you're buying the experience as much as the actual food. Its not really fair to go and downgrade the restaurant on price alone. Just because the meal costs 5 times more here than panda express doesn't mean it should taste 5 times better. Its not a linear relationship. 

Now that I get that out of the way...I thought the restaurant was ""nice"" and I can't think of a better word to describe it.

It seemed like an older crowd but there were a couple of families with little kids eating here.

We got a bunch of different dim sum orders and they were all good but nothing really blew me away about it. The chicken drunken noodles were pretty good, they're packed with fresh herbs - basil and a bunch of other stuff I can't recall.

Nonetheless, this is a brand new restaurant and it's decor is absolutely amazing. My sisters, my boyfriend and I ate a $200 meal that I hoestly didn't think was worth it -- however, it was free. =]

Nonetheless, an overview of what we ate..

SPICY CHICKEN WINGS - Perfectly sweet and spicy while still crunchy.
DRUNKEN NOODLES - we got level #4 spiciness and boy was my mouth burning..it was so delicious though!
PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE - Nothing too special, thought the that it was served inside an actual pineapple was cute. The pineapple chucnks could've been a bit bigger. BUT the shrimp was the best part of this fried rice. They were so fresh and suculently huge..they were like mini lobsters. =]
SASHIMI PLATTER - A bit disappointed that it only had ONE slice of Toro -- nonetheless, everything was REALLY fresh -- but certainly not worth the $80 (maybe if it had 3 more pieces of Toro :D).
BLACK COD - Texture was perfect -- but, I could tell that the fish wasn't from the same day -- was a bit fishier than I had expected.
SHRIMP DUMPLING (HAR GOW) - The crystal wrapper was nice and soft and the shrimp was amazingly fresh -- definitely the best har gow I've ever had -- but it'd dim sum, and you can't really go wrong with that.

And I think that's pretty much all we ate..

The service was NOT GOOD..I don't know how the waitors and waitresses that work there even got hired. We asked a waitress who walked by, ""Excuse me, are there refills on soda?"" And she kind of walked away puzzled and never came back..Then, we asked OUR waitress if we could have a box for the fried rice and she totally forgot about it and remembered it 10 minutes later..WONDERFUL. The service is not up to par with the food, and that's gotta change. However, I suppose the restaurant is still fairly new -- afterall, i went there in the 9th day they were open.

Yellowtail Serrano Roll: too small without enough fish; but it wasn't bad
Hamachi Chili: really pricey, but super good!
Cha Gio Imperial Crispy Rolls: Good flavor; Thai Chili Sauce on the side is too watered down. What I really wanted for a condiment wa some sriracha (you know, the rooster sauce!)
Drunken Noodles with Shrimp: good portion size and good flavor. I love the thai peppers and jalapenos you'll see, and taste, throughout the dish!

With plenty of other offerings along The Strip, dining at Wazuzu should be more a matter of geography (i.e., you're hungry and staying at Encore) than a journey for particularly tasty cuisine.

The Miso Soup was pretty good--chock full of mushrooms, greens, and tofu.  The Cha Siu Bao had a decent filling, but I suspect may have been sitting around a little too long.  The Drunken Noodles also tasted okay but didn't really stand out in any way.  I would recommend it as a plate to be shared (perhaps with one of the specialty dishes) as opposed to enjoyed on its own.  Kudos, however, to the server for nailing my desired spice level after asking for what I was looking for on a scale of 1 to 5.

The place itself is fine, right by the casino.  Customer service was good.  Misis had beef curry, and KiT had tonkotsu ramen.  Both were fine considering a pretty sophisticated Asian restaurant, just fine if you REALLY must have ramen.  As for the Thai items, I say if you're in town, you have yet to have your first ever drunken noodle, and you have to have one then and there, then why not?  Expect prices to be just as up there as a cup of coffee at the Bellagio.

The greens were really fresh, and the dressing was good, but the chicken was on the bland side. I would only recommend getting this if you were trying to eat healthy- otherwise, skip.
-Drunken Noodles w/Shrimp (Fresh Rice Noodles, Thai Basil, Sweet Soy Sauce, Chilies, Onion, $24, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wazuzu-las-vegas?select=0jZ04WDDRavAsXO68Ggl_A#0jZ04WDDRavAsXO68Ggl_A): Surprisingly, really good! My friend got it spicy and it definitely had a good kick to it. This dish was flavorful, and the noodles were very fresh. Highly recommended!

Just make sure you avoid getting the Chef's Omakase since the pieces of fish were super skimpy looking and my friend said it was just so-so. it was also a rip off at $65 or something like that.

With Tal Ronnen coming to the Wynn properties and revamping their vegan menus, I have to say that all the restaurants at these resorts have seriously commendable options. 

Our order:

Dim Sum : Gardein ""Chicken"" Shu Mai
-Considering my experience with Shu Mai has been...nada....this was a new epicurean experience for me. The dish was executed well. It had the flavors of sesame oil and Chinese five spice. The Gardien was shaped to fit into the Shu Mai wrapper and steamed well. $9 for 4 (rather small) pieces

Dim Sum : Jade Dumplings
-Spinach dumplings with shitake mushrooms. Steamed to come out as a translucent green dumpling, this was a treat to the eyes. I enjoyed the simple Asian flavors of these dumplings and for the heat-lover, the side of red chili in vinegar would kick up the notch a bit. Again $9 for 4 (rather small) pieces

Cantonese Fried Rice
- Crispy white rice fried to perfection with mixed vegetables and slivered asparagus. This is how all fried rice should be. $16 for a bowl. I thought the pricing of this was rather ridiculous

Sweet and Sour Gardein ""Chicken""
- Now, when I read this on the menu, I immediately vetoed getting it. You see, Gardein makes a similar dish available in the frozen aisle. But my husband coerced me into OKing this order as he was sold after reading that the Gardein was crispy. The presentation was spectacular. The mix of the Gardein pieces, bell peppers and onions and sweet and sour sauce was scooped into a half piece of hollowed pineapple. And yes, this dish was not quite as similar as the frozen entree that is available at Whole Foods. The Gardein used had a different texture and shape and the sauce was definitely freshly prepared. I would (in a heartbeat) order this fantastic concoction again! $17 for the dish.

Our waiter, Mario was efficient and got us everything we needed in a timely manner. The restaurant itself is not exactly formal dining but nice enough to wear a pretty dress and strappy heels to. Jet Tila (the chef) was hanging around the place. This to me is a positive sign since he's actually looking at what's coming out of his kitchen.

3557417,2009-03-01,6,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"Let me share with u fellow yelpers about the experience I received from this restaurant...I hope they don't delete this review just like my bad review of Red Chair Salon in SF that was deleted with no apparent reason. 

It was around 9 pm that me n my friend was starving to death since we were too busy to walk around the strip to actually stop to have a nice meal. we figure that we could have a really nice dinner to make us full...so after several restaurants menu we read along the way...we stopped at Wazuzu n decide to try it out. we sat down and it took the waitress about 15 minutes to acknowledge us to take our order. the waitress came n it was this old chinese lady.....usually they don't really understand english very well but since its an upscale restaurant I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. so I asked her ""how many pieces of sushi do you get in the Crunchy Roll special menu?"" she said ""Its a ROLL!! what do u think? its usually 6 pieces!"" she was giving me an attitude!! even my friend across the table was shocked! so being the sassy girl that I am...I replied ""Well since its not written on the menu...how was anyone supposed to know that its 6 pieces?!?!?!? some places has 8 or 10 so its not my fault that I don't know these things...not to mention lady this is my first time at this restaurant!"" I can't believe that the first question I asked her she gave me an attitude!! I mean hello???? it was $21 for that specific roll! of course I'm gonna ask u questions when its $21 per roll!!! 

Then I took a deep breath n asked her ""how big is the portion for the Minced Salmon with green onion?"" and she respond ""Its in a bowl!!"" 
I'm like ?????? how big is the bowl?!?!??! by this point I was just so mad n hungry so I just basically ordered my roll n spicy hot wings with rice n thai ice tea. before I finish telling u the whole story..let me break down the price of the things I ordered: 
Crunchy Roll $21
Spicy hot wings $12
White rice $5
Thai ice tea $5

Now the Spicy hot wings turned out to be sweet...I have no idea where the spicy words come from. and the roll turned out to be covered in this little japanese fried balls that taste pretty weird with the shrimp tempura, cucumber, seaweed n rice (which is what a crunchy roll is) well I am paying $21 for this stinking roll..so I might as well eat it instead of wasting it. So I decided to take off this little tiny fried balls with my chopstick and just eat the plain sushi by itself. then that waitress stopped by n I kid u not this is what she said to me ""U are one spoiled girl huh????"" I'm like ""EXCUSE ME?!?!?!"" "" YEAH..I CAN TELL THAT UR SPOILED BY THE WAY U PICK AT UR FOOD"" ohhhhhh man!! I can't believe her!! I mean just because I don't like the little fried ball things n picking it out doesn't mean I'm spoiled!! n who is she to tell me that I'm SPOILED?!?!? I'M HER FREAKIN' CUSTOMER!!! WOWW!!! NEVER IN MY LIFE I RECEIVED SUCH BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

So being the nice girl that I am...I dont like to make a scene instead I decided not to tip her cuz u know what?? the hell with it...I always tip at restaurants even when the customer service was bad. but this time hell no! she is not getting a dime from me n plus the overpriced bad food cannot make up the bad customer service! n really the thai ice tea was the only thing that was decent in that place. I mean c'mon they charge $8 for green tea!!!! Most places its free!!! Hello?!??!?!? if that's not overpriced I don't know what is...n rice for $5?!?!? white rice?!??! yeah u do the math and save ur money to go eat somewhere else.",wCYNDnaVnvqqrLXjwVKeIg,5,5,1,lb8SzGYgKhF3XaF1Qc2dUw

I had their famous drunken noodles and thai beef salad.

Their DRUNKEN NOODLES were delish! That perfect texture too their noodles (not too moist and not too dry or chewy). We all know the drunken noodles is all about the noodles. 

THAT BEEF SALAD was definitely a personal favorite out of the usual salads I have. It has that nice, perfect beef slice to it. Very tender and juicy. This I ordered a level 2 in. While usually spice rating range from 1 to 10. I assumed that since theirs is a 1 to 5 it's double the spice. So I ordered a 2 which was perfect (just don't chew the jalapeno unless you're into that).

I also ordered this really good cocktail as well which was a coconut base. It had a really good light coconut taste, but with this spicy kick to it. It was pretty good. If you've been to the Lucky Rice Market Festival at the Cosmo it is a lot like that Thai Curry cocktail, but with a coconut base rather than a curry base.

pineapple fried rice- this was probably the best pineapple fried rice i have ever had (sorry mom!) it had Chinese sausage, shrimps, and duck meat in it.  3 things that i love!  It had the perfect hint of garlic and sweet and tartness from the pineapple.  My friend ordered this and I wanted to finish her bowl for her.  YUMMZA~

me and my friend ordered brown rice bowls which i loved.  I love eating brown rice and after eating so much junk food in vegas this was perfect!  i had mine with crispy tofu and hers was salmon.  Both were delicious! The tofu was fried perfectly without being oily and it was layered with onions, carrots, and bell peppers, all topped with toasted seasame seeds and a sauce that reminds me of eel sauce when you order cut rolls!

I really wanted to try the drunken noodles...  I was torn between that and the rice bowl, but i figured brown rice was healthier.  next time i'm back, Im def getting the drunken noodles!  i just saw that it was Giada's ""best thing i ever ate""  ;-)

Roti Panang Starter (5 stars/$12): Delicious!  Like a combination between traditional yellow curry and a Thai coconut milk Tom Ka Gai soup.  Neat, warm slices of naan-like flatbread to accompany.

Drunken Noodles (3.5 star/$24) This dish is overhyped.  Spicy and sweet, it is good but not something to rave about.

Lobster Roll (3 star): Again, at $30 this roll better be amazing, and it's not amazing, it's just a good, quality-prepared, but generic-tasting, boring sushi roll that doesn't have much flavor or pizzazz.

Anyway the 3 sushi rolls were great, especially the mushroom based roll. The sweet and sour chicken made with gardein brand vegan chicken was very tasty and full of fresh peppers and light on the sauce. The edamame was of course easy to order. The drunken chicken was amazing! With a nice but not crazy helping of wide rice chow fun type noodles with onions and scallions and leeks yum!!

The vegan chicken potstickers were nice but a bit plain. Ask for vegan eel sauce and mustard on the side to slice it up and you'll love it. Maybe they could pan fry them even but we just got steamed.

3977721,2009-11-05,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"For our final evening in Vegas, my friend and I were interested in trying something low-key and decently affordable.  We had been walking the Strip all day and were finishing up at the Wynn, so a convenient stopoff seemed like the best option before heading back early to our hotel room.  Both my friend and I tend to favor Asian-style cuisine, so the beautiful Wazuzu seemed perfect.

The restaurant was only about one-third full when walked in around 7 pm on a Sunday evening.  The decor was quite shocking with the brightly painted red walls and massive glass dragon hanging along the back wall.  The environment seemed to be more of a Chinese influence than Japanese.  We were immediately seated and debated over trying the sushi or the hot meals.  When it comes to modernized Japanese places, I find that it is always a struggle to know which type of food they are known for (if any). 

My friend ordered some sushi rolls, which she enjoyed well enough.  However, my Salmon Terriyaki Bowl was terrible.  The large bowl was almost three-fourths full of brown rice.  A very small helping of  sauteed peppers and onions was thrown in as well.  The salmon was dry, fishy, and bland.  It tasted like something you would get at a low-budget diner.  The sauce was flavorful, and obviously I had more than enough rice to soak it up with.  However, the fish was a disappointment and more vegetables would have been appreciated.

Wazuzu was a marginal experience, but not a place I would return to.  If you are looking for something similar, I would recommend Sushi Roku in Caesar's WAY before this place.",oCYxjlqjpnW5WJAo6HNR0A,1,0,2,dEoUEvqqiVgsrjiFqdBzbg

I had the Nasi goren which was decent. My friends ordered the vegan drunken noodles and organic fried rice which were good but nothing out of the ordinary. The buddha's feast was again bland.

-------------
FOOD:

Drunken Noodles = Way too salty and saucy. We asked for very spicy and it was just barely spicy.

Korean Short Ribs = Meat wasn't very tender and it just tasted very cheap. The flavor was more like Teriyaki than true Korean Galbi.

Crispy Tofu w/ String Beans = Horrible. There was so much sauce in this dish, filled with so much salt, that it ruined something as simply good as crispy tofu and string beans. The tofu was overly-fried and the string beans were undercooked.

Yellow Curry = A huge bowl of bland yellow liquid. This is not curry -- this is watered-down curry broth.

It's such a shame, because Wazuzu has great decor (their crystal dragon is definitely a sight to be seen) and is inside one of the best hotels in Vegas.

The atmosphere is just fine and there were Kardashian look-a-likes right next to Larry the Cable Guy (figuratively). 

Service was okay. Our server could have paid a little more attention to us.

Overall - excellent food!

Think of how much more they can charge for their food if they could update their sign to say ""Asian fusion"", put in some trendy furniture, and dim lighting?

Well, those smarty-pants at Wazuzu have done just that.  You can find everything but the kitchen sink on their menu - from sushi rolls (Japanese), to wonton soup (Chinese), to Pad Thai (Thai) and hey, even kim chi (Korean)!  So really, they should bill themselves as a ""Chinese / Thai / Korean / Japanese"" restaurant after all!  But then they wouldn't be able to charge the prices they do.

When you are a Jack of All Trades, you cannot expect to be an expert in anything.  This shows in the food at Wazuzu.  The teriyaki bowls are deconstructed plain stirfried overcooked beef or chicken slices - you have to pour your own teriyaki sauce over it.  Hmm....  This is accompanied by over-steamed green veggies on the side, dry rice in the middle, and plain stirfried peppers.  OK, this looks like an amateurish arrangement of buffet food.  

Prices lean more towards the upper teens for entrees, and they charge $13 for JUST the wontons in soup.  Over at Red 8 bistro, you get a whole bowl of wontons AND noodles for the same price.  Hmm.... guess where I'm going back to next?

Wait staff is unfriendly and don't even try calling them directly for reservations.  They don't pick up their phones even though there are often 2-3 waiters standing around with nothing to do.  Yes, that's correct, this is a pretty empty restaurant even at dinner time.  I guess people are voting with their feet....",NS5Bc0EQS29CBttgFqyCXQ,3,1,1,nD63p_ADpNTkzbCZPum5TQ

My mom was so happy, now that is what you call service!

Now on the food! For appetizer we had the Roti Panang and jade dumplings which were amazing. The roti panang is probably some of the best I have had! Loved it!!!

I would like to start off with the service, both the manager Fiona and our waiter Waymon were very friendly and accommodating.

The food experience: We ordered off the vegan menu as we are vegan so all the! Everything we read sounded amazing so we narrowed it down to 2 appetizers, the edamame and vegan California rolls. Edamames were on point and the cali rolls were fresh and delicious. For our entrees we picked two to share, the Drunken Noodles with veggies (you have te option of veggie, chick', tofu) and sweet and sour chickn'.

After the second drink at the bar, they called us and the bartender told us that we can take our drinks to the restaurant, it makes it way around so I walked over with a cocktail to get seated.

While we were waiting to get seated, 2 sets of mom and daughters were giving me dirty looks and laughing at me and made a comment about me wearing a tight dress, when they're all clad in low cut shirts and skirts (If you can't wear a tight dress in Vegas, where can you wear it, right?!!)  Then when we got seated, one of the daughters yelled ""wtf!?! We were here first!"" not knowing that we had been waiting for a half hour but they called to seat us.

We were seated at the booth in the back wall by the crystal dragon, I was very impressed with it. The pears? not so much, it was a weird theme of golden pears and crystal dragon. Eh well. 

Our waitress was this spunky asian woman who knows her stuff and she has a personality and jokes to boot. I loved having her as our waitress, I wish I remembered her name. To start, we got edamame, some cocktails, then we got sushi and a side of pork fried rice because I love that stuff! Everything was phenomenal!

The sushi was so fresh! I don't get it! We're in the desert!?! So why the great sushi!?!? I think it's flown in every day from how it tastes. Goodness! We decided to pace ourselves and eat the pork fried rice and if we were still hungry, we'd order another sushi roll, because it was that good! 

We decided against it and got dessert instead. I went with the ice chachang to finish off our meal because it reminds me of Singapore. It was delicious! Needed more shaved ice but I wasn't complaining, the flavors were all there. 

Then when we're about to leave, the host offered to get photos of us with our camera and she made sure she got the crystal dragon in the photo as well! Very cool!

We chose Wazuzu because other reviewers compared their Asian restaurants to Wazuzu.  Additionally, our evening was going to start at XS in Wynn, so we wanted to find a restaurant in the vicinity.

Wazuzu did not disappoint.  My girlfriend got Panang Curry and I got Nasi Goreng (look up the menu for the descriptions).  What we got doesn't matter as much as the fact that is was delicious.  Food was top quality and while its difficult for me to praise Asian food that isn't from a NY Chinese restaurant, I have to give this credit, it was superb.

The atmosphere is also beautiful.  The Wynn in general is a gorgeous resort, and this restaurant follows right along.  From the giant crystal dragon to the tables and decorations - you really feel like you're in for a classy treat.

Service was fantastic, and our waitress even followed us around the restaurant to help take our picture in a better location (under the crystal dragon).  I'd post the pics, but then Yelp would have the rights to them.

Anyway, if you want really good Asian food in a classy restaurant that might be a bit pricey but won't break your wallet, head to Wazuzu.

Different from other hotels we can always expect food that will satisfy our palettes with exceptional service that beats NYC out of the waters.

Food in Steve Wynn's hotels has rarely disappointed me, so we put our name down (they don't take reservations) and waited. The wait was unsurprisingly long, so we shopped a little until they called us.

I ordered the drunken noodles; my mom ordered the Chinese chicken salad. I got a spicy tuna hand roll as an appetizer. The drunken noodles came out in a large bowl (big portions make me happy!) with shrimps half the size of my fist. It was love at first sight. But it tasted even better: soft noodles, sweet sauce, fresh seafood, the perfect amount of spice. They got it just right. I sampled my mom's salad and was also impressed - it was super fresh and the dressing was amazing. My hand roll was pretty good too. Overall, it was great. And we had enough for leftovers, and I left stuffed. All for a pretty reasonable (Vegas) price? I'm a fan!

We came back again because we liked it so much. This time I ordered the Thai beef salad, which was just as great - citrus dressing, rare beef, fresh greens.

What we ordered: the Penang Chicken Curry. So flavorful. The sauce was so rich that long after the chicken was gone, I was spooning it up on gobs of rice. The pork dumplings were excellent and I loved the cucumber salad, which was fresh and very nice with the curry.

We had the whole dinner comped - yay! We were all starving due to the entire day dancing. So, all six of us ordered one or two rolls, which cost about $30 each. This is pretty expensive for sushi that was wrapped in a lot of rice. I thought the vegan rolls were creative though. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I've had fresh sushi before in Asia and in the states like SF, Miami, and NYC, and Wazuzu is definitely not up to par.

I am still day-dreaming about the melt-in-your mouth dishes! I went with my cousin, aunt, and uncle on our last night in Vegas... Here's what we loved:

- pork potstickers: four big, juicy potstickers with yummy dipping sauce. These were so amazing that we had to get a second order!

- thai beef salad: very spicy with great thai flavors. I mostly ate the veggies rather than the beef... this dish tasted SO fresh!

- pork & shrimp shumai: four much small pieces; these were a bit too small in my opinion but very good and came in a cute little box

- pineapple fried rice: pork, chicken, and prawns served within fried rice served in a pineapple. Most tables seemed to order this as I saw a lot of pineapples going by. Pineapple fried rice is always good but this was the best I've ever had!

- bbq platter: tons of chicken, pork, etc in a chinese bbq style with a yummy dipping sauce

- salt and pepper prawns: good taste but I would have preferred non-fried prawns (I didn't know these ones would be fried...). The prawns were huge though!

- green tea and red tea mochi balls: I LOVE mochi and these were great ones!

The prices were a bit high ($10-$14 for appetizers, $13 - $26 for a main) but really very reasonable for Vegas especially for such unbelievable food! The servers were all very nice though not very talkative and the venue overlooking the casino is nice and comfy.

The dumplings were mediocre but enjoyable (not enough filling). The real star was dessert-HIGHLY recommend the vegan brownie, which comes with a delicious caramel sauce and ice cream.

5113506,2012-12-30,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"A relatively decent option in the Wynn, though it is interesting to note just how many Asian-oriented restaurants there are here now, with some overlap in terms of dishes.

Service was fine, though not particularly attentive.  The food was of decent quality, but much of it not all that different than you'd get in a decent noodle place in LA or SF for about 1/6 the price.

Drunken Noodles appeared to be some form of the Thai Pad See Ew, and had decent flavor.  Nasi Goreng was surprisingly light; we ordered it ""spicy"" as possible, which served to prove they are on some sort of western spiciness calibration.  It was somewhat spicy, but not particularly so.  Chicken Lo Mein was predictable, though slightly more greasy than we appreciated.

Three vegetarian dim sum - Jade Dumpling, Palm Pocket, and White Lotus came in a nice steamer basket stack - they all had the same overly sticky wrapper in different forms with different fillings and together cost more than the entire dim sum meal for four we had at Ping Pang Pong.  Taste was good, but not particularly distinctive between the three forms.

Dessert of Ice Kachang was large but disappointingly icy.  I know it's a shaved ice dessert, but the texture left a lot to be desired.

They serve Asian food of all sorts... Thai, Chinese, Korean, Japanese... maybe they should've focused on one or two types of cuisine at most and done a better job with those.

We started off with sushi and got the Crunchy Roll and Philadelphia Roll.  The Crunch Roll was not impressive at all for a $20 roll.  It was 6 pieces of your basic shrimp tempura, cucumber and avocado.  They made it unique by using japanese rice crackers as the crunch but they should've stuck with normal tempura crunchies because it just wasn't a crunchy roll.  They should call it something else.  The Philly Roll was average... a little too much philly cheese though.

After feeling ""eh"" about the sushi, we decided to try the Pineapple Fried Rice.  There was a lot of flavor going on with the chinese sausage and spices, it was like a party in my mouth.. not necessarily a good thing.  It did have juicy large shrimp though.

Palm Pocket was a mix of hearts of palm, corn, ginger, garlic. I loved the bit of crunchiness from the filling. http://bit.ly/2kPFNQd

The prices are definitely on the high end, but what can you expect from a restaurant at the Encore. Especially since they have a $1.5 million crystal dragon on their wall. 

Here is what I had:

Fresh-squeezed watermelon juice - SO refreshing especially after a long night of drinking at XS 

Tuna Sashimi - 3 pieces of extremely fresh tuna, and they were in thick pieces too! 

Sweet Shrimp Sushi - MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH BUTTERY PIECES OF SWEET SHRIMP. so good. i can literally have 10 of these in a row 

Wazuzu Signature Dragon Sliders - these were so cool, the buns actually had dragon designs on them! (see picture) and the wagyu beef inside each bun was just SO tender and perfectly cooked. one thing I did not enjoy was the asian pickled veggies inside and I just took them out and enjoyed my bun that way! They are extremely expensive though - $38 for 3 small buns. 

Drunken Noodles - this was featured on the Food Network's The Best Things I've Ever Ate, so you know they were amazing. you can choose the spicy level between 1 - 5, because my stomach was not feeling happy from the previous night's drinking, I went with a 3. It definitely had a kick, but not enough on a normal day. The noodles were really amazing though, it was one of the best pan-fried noodles I've ever had! Full of flavor from the basil. 

Tuna tataki roll - amazing presentation and since I am a huge tuna lover, I really enjoyed it, a lot of spicy tuna and avocado, just the way I like it!

The rest of my party had the Beef Chow Fun with bean sprouts and the Pad Thai.  They were quite good.  It's also good for sharing as the dishes are quite big.  

For dessert, we ordered Ice Kachang.  Love it!  Not quite like Singapore's Ice Kachang but a spin-off of it.",EsOu51dW3UTDJTApBxwz2g,0,0,4,iaik_joDe3tC3aaHy161pg

Panang Curry with Shrimp, and Drunken Noodles to follow.  Both were tasty!  Service was attentive, we had a great experience, not a thing to complain about.

My friend is a pro poker player and gets take out from here delivered to the poker room next door and he's always talking about how it's ""ok.""  I think it's more than ok.  And that isn't just because we had come hungry from a terrible dining experience at the Wynn that we walked out of.  

The service is good.  The server might be a little to quick but at least he corrected himself whenever there was a discrepancy.  

The sushi was good.  The rice was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely.  The rolls had a great balance of fish to rice.  

The miso cod was good.  It wasn't spectacular or anything to write home about but it definitely filled the spot.  

I liked the Thai Basil chicken, even if I thought it may have had too much sauce.  

The only things I didn't like were the steamed rice on the side and my guava margarita cocktail.  The rice seemed a little bit like it sat out for a long time.  The top layer was hard and dry.  Also, I didn't like my cocktail.  Like at all.  The guava margarita didn't taste of guava.  It basically tasted of well alcohol with ice.  This is a shame because my friend LOVED her mango martini.",byV70bKT87SHgN0uRtow6w,1,0,4,X2NYlVwHkXVZ5nKjsBPX-Q

The sushi was standard and the drunken noodles were actually pretty good, but the curry was below average. I think for the price, there are way better restaurants with higher quality food. 

I wouldn't suggest this place unless I knew they were a fan of Americanized Asian food. Hey, sometimes even us Asians love Americanized Asian food, but only if it's absolutely delicious and worth the money....",Xq4F6XlABCRO8gBpcJVjPQ,3,2,2,Fgx6GTaOC4BNu4eAu9AMcQ
5783932,2014-05-13,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"Wazuzu was delicious! We ordered the Roti Panang as a starter. I was a little hesitant at first since I have never had curry. It was amazing! We ordered it with a heat level of 3 and it was perfect! I have to say that I am officially addicted and must find a place back home where I can get it.
There were 3 of us dining for lunch. We each ordered the Drunken Noodles. Two with beef and one with shrimp. Again, I was not disappointed. It hit the spot. No one in our party had eaten at Wazuzu so we didn't know what to expect. The Drunken Noodles could feed two people depending on how hungry they are. Also, the server gave us an option on the heat level ranging from 1 to 5. We all ordered a level 3. I can handle spicy food but this was just a little too spicy for my liking. It was still yummy and I ate it.
I craved the panang and drunken noodles my whole trip! In fact, after laying by the pool for a few hours, I ordered some to take back to my room for lunch! I got smart and ordered the panang at a level 2.5-3 and the drunken noodles at 2. Both were perfect!
Again, this was my first time trying either dish but I fell in love. I also liked the convenience of being on the property. However, the pricing is a bit on the expensive side. After coming to Vegas for several visits, I know that it is not cheap. I did expect to pay a little bit more as the Encore is one of the higher end hotels on the Strip. Don't expect to come here for a cheap and quick meal.
I will say, I already plan to make this a must have during any future trips to Vegas.",yBMd_jl5LNyrdF_wnwk2Wg,0,0,4,z3pnMJWcCVrJgoRS-FYyYw
5796215,2017-07-04,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,Not the best but ok if you want to order to your room or grab something quick. All of the sushi tastes like it has been sitting in the refrigerator waiting to be served. The rice is very sticky. The dumplings are very tasty so maybe just stick with some appetizers. Drunken noodles with beef and shrimp were pretty good but a little on the greasy side. Overall nothing impressive for being housed at Encore.,vHF1sym4V_FkXbj-K7WKnw,0,0,2,ZfRvh1UTOM1z55lHp0isKg
5804979,2015-11-06,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"Came here with Mr. Piano for a dinner away from the rest of our traveling party, and it's a lovely restaurant with really nice service :)

I chose Wazuzu because, as one of the Wynn restaurants, it has vegetarian options. I was really hoping for vegan ramen, but while there is a vegetarian ramen, the noodles have egg and I have an egg allergy. I ended up getting the Vegan Drunken Noodles with the Gardein protein. I requested mushrooms, but I think it got lost in the order. It was a fairly standard vegetarian drunken noodle dish for me, so while it was good, it wasn't anything to write home about and probably not worth $24. I split a shitake mushroom sushi with Mr. Piano and also got the Blue Lychee Cooler, which I honestly expected to have more blueberry and lychee flavor, but really is more of a (pricey)lemonade. The sushi was really simple for what it was, and it was good, but absolutely not worth the price. It's also possible that I should have ordered different things.

Mr. Piano got the Shoyu Ramen, and was dazzled by the soy egg (aji-tamago), which from what he described was a soft-boiled egg soaked in soy sauce, likely with a bit of sugar (in case you were wondering what a ""soy egg"" was). I think he enjoyed his meal quite a bit more than mine, so perhaps the dishes are significantly better if you're not a vegetarian and don't have an egg allergy, but I can only review what I experienced.

The wait-staff were really friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the menu, which was really useful. Also, they ask right off the bat about food allergies and whether anyone would like the vegetarian menu, so that was nice. The décor is lovely, and we sat under the eponymous dragon (apparently the giant crystal dragon's name is Wazuzu, or so they told the kid at the next table).

Overall, a solid restaurant and a good place for a romantic evening out (if you don't get seated right next to very vocal children, anyway), but I wasn't as impressed by the food as the prices and décor led me to believe I ought to be.",tUsrdWOWjOGf_hTsjMKycA,0,0,3,tT9TsizIEMjxVVLh3QAF-Q

The food presentation here is amazing. The plates, chopsticks, everything is thought out. 

The food we had was very good too. I had the ""drunken noodles"" dish, and my wife had some sashimi, which was very fresh and well presented (that is all sashimi needs to be.)

So come here and get drunken noodles and sashimi.

5827941,2012-08-19,0,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"While staying at the Wynn, I opted to ""take out"" at Wazuzu and bring dinner back to my room. I've never done this before but when I asked, they were more than accomodating - much much better choice than room service.

I opted to go with a bit of ""dim sum"" for myself. I went with the pan fried pork dumplings, spicy tuna roll and shu mai (shrimp and pork dumplings steamed). All were delicious, served with enough sauce, utensils and napkins. Very delicious and flavorful.  The restaurant was quite busy when I was waiting for my order so I would say whether eating in or taking out, go for Wazuzu if you want a great Asian meal at Encore (or Wynn which is attached via a corridor).",8B188riM26vd9B2uGqV3cg,1,0,4,k0EhDR2BKLR4r9No1uGgMQ

5836195,2015-03-19,1,4uISbaUPJLVECBHIi3tpxA,"At first glance, Wazuzu seems like yet another ordinary asian restaurant that tries too hard to offer the foods of various asian cultures, and marked up simply for being in the Wynn/Encore. However, don't be fooled!

While many of the dishes are merely ordinary, the Drunken Noodle here is second to none. In fact, this was featured on the food network as one of the best things some chef has ever eaten. This is simply not an exaggeration! The noodles are very Q, all of the meat selection (chicken, shrimp or beef) are of top quality, and the portion is actually quite large. If you are a fan of spicy foods, get a 4 (on their hotness scale from 1-10). Depending on the chef, the chili pepper used differs. This is probably the only consistency issue, and it really affects how spicy a 4 really is.

I've also tried a few of their fried rice, the tom yum soup, and lobster. The fried rice is also well-portioned, but probably not worth the money. The tom yum soup was interesting, but I got a 4 on the spicy scale and it literally burned my tongue off! SO, SO spicy (problem with the consistency...). The lobster, which was extremely expensive ($100+), was also mouth-wateringly delicious! The lobster is de-shelled, fried and pan-fried with garlic and other herbs. This was surprisingly tasty!!! 

Anyway, come here for the Drunken Noodle. It is a little pricey at about $25, but you will not regret it!",Erf1Jb6H6hsQHiLtn3G_-g,1,1,4,_05B7GcTAZYuHBvi5hSGZQ
