682420,2014-05-02,0,zrMpy_uQ5_77YapMkp8lUA,Went to this place late in the day. Not overly busy or hectic enough to justify the attitude and poor service from the girl behind the counter. The food was good and the prices were reasonable when considering the location. Perhaps they're used to dealing with drunk patrons but that was not the case the entire time I was there. The place was clean but the service left a lot to be desired.,2JvNTBn1sJhoapwdZyizTw,1,0,3,b_5l6_fv2G8LgW1EW3kzpw

I have had a ton of Burritos at Asada's.  They make them the way you want them.  You will have to pay more, but it's worth it.  I love these burritos!  The place is a classic Mexican food place.  It's small and low key.  Asada's Burritos are a lot like the one's in SF.",Q0Q0pysI7vJaapxGZrWF4A,0,0,5,WkoLDNuAMJFMJbYCNMc3DQ

2348827,2013-11-04,3,zrMpy_uQ5_77YapMkp8lUA,We stopped here to soak up some booze. It certainly did the trick. The chicken taco was yummy as well as the black beans. The black beans had onions and some seasonings. Decently priced and quick service. The only down fall is the lack of seating. There could be more along the wall. We awkwardly ate our tacos on the ledge where you order. Lol it did the trick!,EPa3uxyyGfRMpPX47lKwvQ,3,2,4,XE656fX1wxUQrELFzeDInQ
2442820,2014-08-11,0,zrMpy_uQ5_77YapMkp8lUA,"Had the nachos and toquitos. They charge for each additional ingredient; lettuce, sour creme, salsa, and etcetera. The toquitos were a soggy mess. What we did eat left us sick in to the next day.",x6RWnvHoxdAe0i5HSC0kgA,2,0,1,E7hf9f9ciA2PxbYY8i5HVA
2444465,2014-02-25,1,zrMpy_uQ5_77YapMkp8lUA,"Every time I visit Vegas, my first stop after my friend picks me up from the airport is Tacos El Gordo, my gold standard for authentic Mexican excellence. The next day I was still looking for a fix of tongue, and decided to give Asada's a shot. While it wasn't bad, it simply didn't hold a candle to Tacos El Gordo. 

I stopped in mid-afternoon to a mostly empty restaurant. I decided to go for a burrito with lengua. The burrito was a bit sloppy - it was rolled a bit loose and the lengua was on the bland side. The hot sauce on the table was really good and helped add some much needed flavor to the burrito.

The location itself is a classic ""hole in the wall"" joint - but those places usually make the best Mexican food. If I were on Fremont St. and had a huge craving for Mexican, I'd give them another try, but there's MUCH better Mexican food to be had in Las Vegas.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,3,2,3,YuWJ9w4yC_dojy1KjuOsaA

First, I typically love $2 tacos. I'm all about that. But this place is scum.

We waited in line for 20 minutes. Not because the guy was helping another customer...no he was replacing cheese that didn't need to be replaced. It was like half full. Second,  after he replaced the cheese he stuck some in his mouth and started eating it with his gloved hands. After the cheese he decided the ketchup bottles needed replacing too. All the while me and everyone behind me are watching this guy and getting more and more pissed.

After we called him out on that to change his gloves after sticking it in his mouth he decided to be a jerk and stick the hottest salsa they have on our tacos. I asked for mild, not suicide hot. Couldn't even eat my damn taco.

I am so pissed.",xiI5xCJhNLXUY1_8Y-Ehew,1,0,1,FlSiPPvYiqqDbKb8E_lLNg

4286892,2014-04-06,1,zrMpy_uQ5_77YapMkp8lUA,"A small place right in the main hub of downtown Fremont St. This place serves tasty Mexican street food, but pricey due to a hot spot location. The burritos are $9 and you get to pick what kind of stuff do you want in it. They even let me put both carne asada and carnitas (i really wanted al pastor, but they ran out) meat mixed in for no extra charge, but wanted to charge more if I pick more than one hot sauce. It tasted good. Their Carne Asada Fries are bomb and is definitely the thing to get! No wonder the fries cost the most ($12). It must be the added nacho cheese that made it tasted better than the burritos. The food here is pretty spicy if you choose the hot option, but nothing painfully.",MX_sGTpLIQ0EOcvK73nRyA,3,1,4,jL8EKd0BFCZe87x8lvngAw

4961633,2014-01-25,2,zrMpy_uQ5_77YapMkp8lUA,"I didn't have a good experience the one time I decided to eat here. We made it pretty clear what they wanted but their method of serving is a bit confusing. One of the stations is on the opposite end of where you order so if the person there doesn't hear you they don't start your order which is what happened to us. We ordered a fair amount of tacos and some quesadillas and went up to get our order when they called us. We ended up realizing that they gave us the wrong order after a few bites and mentioned it to them to be told ""well you shouldn't of bit into it if you knew it was wrong"" obviously we didnt know it was wrong in the first place or we wouldn't have and they shouldve been more attentive when calling us up for our order and handing us the wrong tacos. The kid then said, well if you weren't drunk you would've noticed. I had just opened my first beer of the night and laughed at this pathetic high school looking kid. Horrible service, lack of attention and abuse of customers. 

 Avoid this place like the plague.",-Eh94gMDNXl30WdDWyiI-A,1,0,1,Vm44CNxIH7U28NpeMwo-qA

Well, Yelp, I'm going to share that secret with you. It's a little hole in the wall taco joint called Asada's on Fremont Street.

They have a sign out front boasting of their daily special which is what drew us in. When we were there, it was $6 for 3 chicken tacos and a drink. My hubby decided to get that. However, I am ridiculously addicted to carnitas and had to try theirs. I ended up with two carnitas tacos on corn tortillas. They put some onion/cilantro mix and your choice of salsa on top.  It looked perfect as is and that was how they ""recommended"" it, so I skipped the cheese and sour cream. Oh.my....I felt like I died and went to taco heaven. The onion/cilantro mix was sooo good and were some of the best raw onions I ever tasted. I'm going to have to try to re-create that when I get home. Their carnitas were also piping hot (temp wise) and it tasted like they'd been soaking the pork for days. So good! 

For 5 tacos and a bottle of water, it only cost us $13. I can't even get something that cheap at home, let alone on vacation. If you're going to be near/on Fremont, try one of their tacos and I'm sure you will fall in insta-love too.",3wDRFdjpeq36Es97Zj2iVw,5,1,5,DdHJiqpxpdTVtUGyF7mM-A

I got the steak burrito and pastor burrito with Spanish rice and all the fixins(onion cilantro, hot salsa, cheese sour cream, pinto beans).  the meat was tender and flavorful and all of the fixins were tasty complemented the burrito.
