462735,2015-03-08,1,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,This place has the worst customer service ever....they messed up our order n refused to fix it or refund our money and hung up on me!!!  Order from somewhere else! !!!,NhWqGoLrXLSjVKpX3_F1fA,2,1,1,4IOtxouGirKCLo1ipsRMRQ
472370,2015-02-23,1,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"This place was horrible! Ordered a two topping pizza and chicken strip combo. Chicken strip and fries tasted stale like they had been sitting around all day and reheated.  The pizza had the wrong toppings. When we called to address the issue, they said they would call us back. After waiting about 15 minutes and not receiving a call back, we had to call back again. They said they would send out a replacement pizza with the correct toppings as soon as their driver returned. Waited an hour, and nothing. Had to call again. At this point, it had been about 2 hours after original order had been placed!  When they answered,  they acted as if they didn't know what we were talking about and placed us on hold while we waited for the manager/owner to get off a ""business call"". When they finally got on the line, we requested our money back and the response was ""we can't give you your money back because we have your pizza already in the oven"". We were told we would have our pizza within 20 minutes. Over 30 minutes later, still no pizza!  It's places like this that give small businesses a horrible name!!! One of the worst customer service experiences I have ever encountered!!! You are better off going to a Little Cesaers or something equivalent... I'd rather eat THEIR crappy pizza and save my time and money then deal with this shitty service again!",2ZfbxjlMZK9SnfNiPe1cXQ,2,1,1,yl9SlIBJPU-0mhxFUtJ-fw
507830,2015-01-04,1,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"I placed an order with Bona Pizza at 8:30pm... an hour and half later I decided to call them and see what the issue with delivery might be. The manger was very rude to me and said that they were 'unable' to deliver my pizza. Instead of admitting that they were very busy and offering a discount on a future purchase or something to make up for the snafu, he actually hung up on me, a paying customer. I would have appreciated a call after the 30 minute delay or even after an hour delay, but I had to call Bona Pizza myself and see what the problem was. I have ordered from them 2 times in the past and the pizza is okay as far as taste, but never have I had an issue with rude customer service and lack of delivery. 

I strongly recommend NOT ordering from them and they should not place flyers under hotel room doors if they 'cannot' deliver to these locations in a decent time frame. I am now ordering room service instead. By the way the hotel I am staying at is on the strip, near city center, so it is not far from Paradise, their location. 

I am not the type to ever write a negative review unless my overall experience was terrible.",wlcWp7STNY0Ccnpap2_Nzw,4,1,1,FDmBT7AMgJevC--bjt5f8A
834495,2015-04-21,1,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"I wish I didn't have to give them a star. Horrible service horrible chicken fingers . Order was delivered to my room in 30 minutes. As soon as we opened the chicken strip box, we immediately called them and requested they send out new strips because they are clearly old! The guy that we talked to name was jake and instead of providing us with new chicken strips, he tried to convince us that they were fresh... REALLY! Then he said everything was shut down and he couldn't send out new strips . They didn't close for another 20 minutes . I am so upset . Jake told us that a manager was not there and to call back in the morning. I took a photo of those ugly ass old ass chicken strips and I am uploading it !",5xFc_LFpP6E3gwvBnTarDg,3,1,1,tsICWsxtSAFyw7yXS0tD4g
1057079,2015-02-06,0,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"If you get a flyer in your hotel, toss it immediately. The food took over an hour, not the 30-45 minutes quoted. The gyro meat was tough and overcooked, there were only a few sad pieces of said meat, and no utensils or napkins were sent along. The ""garlic knots"" were just small scraps of fried dough that were most likely left over from pizzas. And last but not least, the delivery driver could have delivered to the room, but called us down to the lobby instead at 10:45 at night. Terrible service and food.",x_KNB7x5sizMxyESIzvxZA,0,0,1,YzIxtpWK1G51_V9p7Jdglg
2069570,2014-07-23,2,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"Admittedly, I have not tried the pizza here so I can't comment on that.  I have been pleased with other things I have ordered including subs, calzones and salads.  I have used their delivery service multiple times and it has always been correct and reliable.  Their ""dining in"" amenities are severely limited.  There is no tableside service and you can forget getting something as exotic as a cup with ice for your drink.

There is also a bar in a separate room which seems to be closed during the day (when I was there), but may open in the evenings.  I am not sure if the two are the same business, but they are connected internally.  Perhaps they have cups and ice there!",2yur9dbYINdaxroDYvVCJA,1,1,3,OOOr4vn9DBaUnsOPz6Q-6Q
2181188,2015-01-04,0,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,This place has the best pizza in all of Vegas. I get a large cheese easy sauce and it is perfect every time. This is the only place I order from.,nuPE4WNMZ0vQfMBSeJaoBw,0,1,5,kl5zjO4JSeMyTbNVNFuYZw
2192882,2014-08-10,1,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"I ordered from the flyer under the door. Looked really good.
Read the reviews, decided to order anyway. 
I asked to have pizza delivered to hotel room. They did not deliver to the hotel room and made me go from 28th floor to the lobby. I ordered from Eat24 and included the tip in the order, so I couldn't deduct any money for laziness. Additionally, I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and pineapple, and the pineapple only covered 45% of the pizza, what a waste. Another pizza was olives and pepperoni, olives were minimal.   I would try another delivery place first before trying to order from here.",lZLiOYLd0sG9H3yNVL8T2A,4,1,1,EfKebJBa96OxbB3U47IkRw
2719632,2015-02-15,1,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,If I could offer no stars I would in a heartbeat...  beware don't order... food sucks takes over an hour and a half to bring it to your room... Yes they actually delivered to my hotel room but like I said over an hour and a half pizza was cold very greasy and look like it was sitting out... looked like it was made by a kindergartener basically!!!!,3H8o96JfMP4CcuFHLd8Dcw,3,1,1,i8Al-myViPw0pRh4hBO-9Q
2973031,2015-01-19,2,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,They advertise that they deliver to your room and ask for your room number but they don't tell you that most hotel's don't let the drivers inside. I had to go down stairs to get the pizza and the driver wasn't even where he said he was. And then the pizza looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. It was cold and looks old. I would never order from here again.,avalozAqC4Xc7jLMkkEwWg,3,1,1,sgwNaiBlorxRMhsMG4B5Sw

4519880,2015-01-06,0,Tnia3DIsEgc8nVPNnTRj7Q,"I started reading all the reviews about the horrible delivery service after I had already placed my order and I was wondering what I had just gotten myself into.  As I was reading through everyone's bad experiences, there was the knock on the door of my hotel- 15 minutes ahead of when I expected which was perfect since it was already 10PM and I was hungry.  I had been in town working the entire day and was thinking about how hungry I was when walking back into my room.  As I picked up the flyer off the floor I thought to myself ""these people know I'm tired and hungry and don't want to run back out. I'll order from them"".  Can't honestly see why everyone else was disappointed. The food was good- it's the usual pizza place fare which is pretty hard to screw up.  If it's late and you're hungry and don't feel like running out anywhere, I'd say go for it!",X6bQfbW6FpFpb7AEJfS3OQ,0,1,4,WiJLGGvOLFXa_U9EAvLgIQ
