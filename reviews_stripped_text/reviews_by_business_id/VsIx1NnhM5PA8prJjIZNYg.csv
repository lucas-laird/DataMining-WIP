136807,2013-01-04,0,VsIx1NnhM5PA8prJjIZNYg,"This review is for the Mermaid Lounge, NOT the mermaid show, the aquarium, or the art gallery.
This is a wonderful, serene little lounge in the Silverton Casino next to the Aquarium near Bass Pro Shop.  THIS IS NOT A STRIP PARTY BAR, so if that's what you're looking for, skip it. And there's no music. There is a bar, of course, and several tables with barstools, and some conversational lounge areas, but the best part of this lounge is the long row of stuffed, high-back armchairs facing the aquarium.  It's a wonderful place to just sit and relax while planning your evening activities, waiting to meet friends, or unwinding after a show or a long night of gambling.  You can just sit comfortably and watch the fish swim by as you contemplate what you're going to pawn for your plane ticket home. Bonus: the food and drinks here are reasonably priced. Although it calls itself a restaurant as well as a lounge, it really only serves a limited selection of standard bar food.  What they do serve is very good, however; I can recommend the fried calamari and the parmesan fries. The drawbacks: the kitchen is open irregularly. Don't depend on being able to order food here; I've been left hungry on more than one occasion when the kitchen certainly should have been open. Also, service can be nearly non-existent; you may have to go up to the bar to get your drink if things are busy. But you won't mind, just relax and watch the fish swim lazily by.",Y_ZrYeUZnROvahSrkU9k_g,1,0,4,gnOl_Cx0Tvo4G-O_p7zurA

Great show, free for the family and the Mermaid Restaurant & Lounge's food was not too bad either.  Their menu offers American food choices -- we tried the fried calamari and shrimp salad.  The calamari was a bit disappointing since it's stale and soggy, the shrimp salad was good, maybe a little too much sauce.  Overall, the biggest attraction is definitely the mermaid show -- should definitely check their showtimes before going.  The casino itself offers $5 blackjack and texas holdem poker tables -- great alternative to the expensive strip casinos.",TqmIBHCujsghPNYw1nvx4g,0,0,5,XdTyEgu4j9EoI4z-JNwH6Q
535504,2013-03-20,0,VsIx1NnhM5PA8prJjIZNYg,The nachos were huge for what you pay for them.  That is about the only positive thing I can say.  Only saw 1 mermaid and she was not in the area of the lounge she was out front for other people to see.  Our waitress must have been new.  She got my order wrong.  Had to wait another 20 minutes just to get chips and salsa(which is what I originally ordered).  She spilled our drinks as she was setting them on the table.  My hubby had the fish and chips and he said the fish was good.  But the chips were just regular shoestring french fries.  Maybe in the late night or happy hour would be a better time to be there.  We were there around 1-2 pm.  So I guess it is just not the right time to be there for a great experience.,iucJuwfCtLT9yIPWFr0T8Q,0,0,2,ZTRF7TzXr8UpefpoaluebQ

Turned out they didn't have a mermaid show - it was the Mermaid CASINO that had them. They didn't have the fried oreos either! Oh well, we ordered some food and drinks.

My vodka cranberry tasted like pure cranberry juice. The Teriyaki was okay, but I've had better. The calamari was DELICIOUS!

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back but it was a nice one time thing.

We ordered:
Chips & Salsa- Comes with 2 types of salsa and guacamole. You can taste how fresh everything were prepared. I just can't stop eating it.

Fried Calamari- there were huge! Love the batter used to deep fried the sucker. There's so much on a plate, you really don't need to order anything else really...

Fish Tacos- You get 3 huge tacos! Huge pieces of cod, sour cream, topped with shredded cabbage and fresh salsa. More Chips, Salsa, & Guacamole also accompanied this dish so that was a lot of food!

Seats were comfortable and so close to the bathroom. You can sit and relax while people surf and admire the mermaids in the tank. Cool spot.",-mXobpJ3z3X6nMriCklbog,2,0,4,hAku_t5Y9UDsBcuc36EvtA

Hubby and I have been here several times and once or twice we even brought a friend. Once I sat alone and gamed at the bar. Once I brought a friend and his wife here (they were from out of town).
Every time it's the same thing...YOU GET IGNORED AND HAVE TO FLAG SOMEONE DOWN. 

If you sit in the chairs along the tank area, sit in the chairs near the lower game tables or sit up at the bar...YOU GET IGNORED. I remember this did not happen a few years ago. Maybe they are having staffing problems? Seriously, feeding money into a slot on the floor at Silverton will get you better service than at this bar area...which is disappointing to me.

Anyway...the latest round of drinks were at table near the game tables. After 20+ minutes sorry I did not keep track but yes...it was too long. We order drinks and hubby wants to order food. Easy enough... it was 8pm on a Tuesday night...nope. She explained we need to order right away because they are not serving food. She handed us a menu and stood there waiting. Ok...hubby chose nachos something simple and he said no meat. 
After maybe 1/2 an hour and empty water glasses she came back with the nachos (which had meat) sat them down and left. Hubby said they were cold and the chips were stale. No side plate (maybe we are sharing) no napkins and no silverware. No water refills and no drink seconds. We had to flag her down and she seemed irritated. Keep in mind WE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN MERMAID LOUNGE.

This place is a joke. A consistent joke.

Honestly after over an hour and a half wait at Mi Casa for our food last time...MAYBE we will go to Twin Creeks in the future (we love that place). Otherwise we are writing off Silverton. 

There are tooooooo many choices here in Vegas to be jerked around at this casino...

I just looked at their info is says they have food until 10pm at the timeslot we were there. Fail. We will not go back.

One star for the seating and one star for the view of the tank. Otherwise a zero would be more appropriate. Sad.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,3,2,x9tjpha4bwzv-xVcNt3OdA

I've Been in LV 30+ years and am not a fan of casino bars/lounges etc. Our bar tender was a nice young lady...I think her name is Michell. . Anyway, were were all enjoying ourselves for an hour or two. Several rounds went by, money on the bar etc. Up to that point service was  just ok. Our bartender had taken a break or two, no bigee. As we were not facing the bar I noticed she was gone as well as the money that was on the bar. I myself had about $30+ on the bar and surveying the others it came out to about $70. She was on break again...came back. I was going to challange her but thought better of it because she cut herself short. When the bunch of us go out for 'beers' every few months we ususally leave the bartender b/t $125 - $150. This bartender is one reason I donot support Casino bars/lounges. We, as a group, usually hang out at local bars for nice specials and honest bartenders. For good honest service try 'Crown & Anchor' (E. Trop), 'RePete's' Warm springs just west of LV Blvd and another favorite is 'Bj's' on E. Trop and Koval.

Now, listen up.

This is the beauty of the Mermaid Lounge.

DRINKS: strong!   Even if your just sitting at a slot machine or at the tables... the cups they serve the drinks in  are pretty munch 8oz of alcoholic beverage.  not going to complain.... 

PLUS: a beautiful place to hang out if ur  waiting on gamblers.  there are couch like chairs to relax on right in front of the tank.  something about staring at a fish tank is so serene.

you can even watch feeding time!  

It's a cool little lounge with a full bar and plenty of seating.  It's fun... and the big fish tank and huge jelly fish tank behind the bar definitely adds to the ambiance.

My friend and I showed up to check out a mermaid convention being held in the hotel--gorgeous women (and some men) in elegant fish tails, sunbathing in the pool. 

We figured, ""Hey, if these are the amateurs, the professional mermaids must be AMAZING..."" 

Yeah, well, we were wrong. 

First off, the girls they get for this attraction wear full body suits, their tails look kinda... cheap... and then they're wearing goggles and nose clips. I figure the water's probably refrigerated and not really not really conducive to nearly naked underwater ballet.  

Their shows are every 15 minutes (during certain hours of the day) and last maybe 5 minutes, at most. The tank, which contains rays and fish, is filled with oxygen hoses. The girls are lowered into and lifted out of the pool on a swing-like seat. Once they're in the water, they swim for the oxygen hoses and then hang at the bottom and just wave at the kids until the swing appears in the water again, and they make a mad dash for it, sit on it, and get pulled out of the water. 

No tricks, no twirls or spins or loops or anything, just breathing through a hose and waving at the bottom where only the kids and their parents mobbing the tank could see. They only put one girl in the tank for each ""show.""

Really, the whole illusion had no chance. Basic things like keeping the toes pointed and not poking out were just forgotten. It just looks like a semi-miserable person trapped in a tank with her legs together until she can leave. 

I'd have gotten a drink at the bar, but there wasn't anyone manning it. 

Seriously, the Bass Pro Shop adjacent to the tank was FAAAAAAAAR more interesting. The sole redeeming quality of this place is the jelly fish tank above the bar with the metal-looking, mermaid statue. 

If you want a free show that's just as cheesy, if not better, just hang around the Midway at Circus Circus.",-0IiMAZI2SsQ7VmyzJjokQ,9,6,2,cAfaOOCHcmMUZJAxBrZ9qA

The mermaid was adorable (apparently some of these ladies come from the olympic gold syncronized swimming team!). She did flips, she waved all the kids. She played with the fish... it was a very surreal thing to watch.

Sure, it sounds mundane, but let me tell you that this was one of the coolest underwater things I've seen.  The scuba diver feeds chunks of meat to the sting rays and you can see them chewing it and swallowing it in their mouths. Did you know that sting rays' mouths are on their under sides? Crazy! 

They've got so many weird and exotic fishes in here, from leopard sharks to fishes with unicorn horns on their heads.  It was really neat to see the scuba diver interacting with the sharks and sting rays, and the kids around the giant cylindrical tank were going nuts.  I guess there's a mermaid that also poses in the tank, but we didn't get to see her.  

This place is off the strip.  I wasn't expecting much because no one I talked to knew about this place (it's right by the Bass Pro shop at Outdoor World).  However, I'm glad I trekked off the strip to see this cool (FREE!) aquarium.

As a local, it's pretty cool getting excited about something touristy or new or in this case, unknown.  The Mermaid Lounge is found in the Silverton Casino, just a little south of the main strip, and lives up to its name in a surprising way.

There is a beautiful aquarium just outside the restaurant, with plenty of fish, manta rays, and... an actual swimming, smiling mermaid.

While it's not a modern discovery of science, the fully underwater girl dressed as a mermaid swims up to you, poses for pictures (between the tank glass), and admittedly, it's a very novel and cool effect.  The girl's a good sport, making sure that camera hungry folk get a good shot or two before popping her breathing apparatus back in.

The restaurant itself is quite pretty, with chairs named after famous fish folk (Ariel, Shamu, etc), and behind the bar is a tank of jellyfish that have neon lights flickering around them, making their translucent bodies change color.  Beautiful and creepy all at once.

The first server girl we ran into was a little stand-offish, but our main server was very friendly and attentive.  Food and drinks here are reasonably cheap (less than $10 for most meals, and the same for drinks).  I tried the ahi tuna wrap, and it was quite tasty (and a little spicy).

The Silverton is a little out of the way from the Strip, but this is a very cool bar, and worth the extra effort to get over there.  The aquarium is awesome, and there is a small alcove that when walking in, gives you a brief sensation that you are actually walking into the aquarium's water.  It's an interesting effect in itself.

Its reasonably priced for a casino bar and the as long as the mermaids are healthy/on time the shows are entertaining. Watching the eyes and faces of the children who haven't seen the show before is worth the time spent waiting for the show to start as they then try to determine what they are seeing is for real or not. 

The scuba diver in the tank with the mermaid (for their safety and to hold the breathing tube) is kinda distracting and I wish they would have something in the tank for him to hide behind in order to make it even more magical for the children but all in all it's a free event that draws a crowd and shouldn't be missed if you are at the Silverton.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,4,E-NT9Pshxxag83IW324bsw
