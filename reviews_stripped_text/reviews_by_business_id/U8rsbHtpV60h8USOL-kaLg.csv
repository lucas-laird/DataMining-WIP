Comforting, yet artful Low-Country cuisine is served by a professional yet personable wait staff. Louis's offers a comfortable dining space and an awesome patio in a smoke-free and gaming-free environment.",IAYrrLSivxoeOX6OgHkiYA,0,0,5,Bmz2uRLq6i8coqyPSlRZ4w

The $35 also includes a choice of three alcoholic beverages to kick off your brunch- a bellini, Louis's Lemonade (which you can get virgin), and a Southern-style Bloody Mary with okra.  The selection is varied and crowd-pleasing, all with a Low-Country spin.   Think she-crab soup with sherry or shrimp & grits.  I'd highly recommend the Oyster BLT- not your standard BLT.  Instead of sandwich bread, two fried green tomatoes hold together a tower of bacon, an ample serving of fried oysters, and Boston bibb lettuce.  Genius.  Dessert rocks!  A warm chocolate cake comes topped with 4 fried chocolate truffles.  Or you can go for the butterscotch trio (ice cream, shake, and creme brulee) or 5 or 6 other dessert selections.  Our large party had the patio almost to ourselves on a breezy and sunny Saturday afternoon plus Louis came out to greet each table.  If I lived here, I'd be in danger of spending way too much time here.",y-XxUFQR_0WfAHaWdPDt2w,3,2,4,2mzd14QIfHFNUaVyvxYFsg

Drinks: Had an abita beer (purple haze!).. hard to find in Vegas, and points for carrying something from Louisiana! Also had some great wine, not sure how overpriced it was.

Starters: Grits souflee/flan thingy was good, as was the salad with crab meat.. it had lots of crab meat. yum.

Main: Chicken fried duck breast with foie gras rice. Chicken fried duck breast, awesome as expected.. but the rice had NO foie gras in it. Ok, I take that back, I didn't bring a magnifiying glass.. but seriously I was very disappointed, grrr. I shouldn't have to search my dish to find a main ingredient.. period.

Desserts: All were yummy, but the favorite at my table was the caramel cake.  We tried all 6 or so on the menu (it was a big group!).

Service was excellent, as was the ambience. It's a small place, but very nicely done. We ate on the beautiful balcony and we were pleased with the overall experience. I'm rounding up because others seemed very pleased with their dishes.... if only I could get over my foie gras rice disappointment.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,1,1,4,DrQhVuAUPHlAboVVhurvWA
