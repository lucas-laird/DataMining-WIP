The solid guy at the location was aware of the situation.  Even though corporate needs to give them more staff, they were kind, understanding, and professional.  The driver did a great job keeping my receipt and taking it to location, the pro working there showed me the situation and pointed out it's a tech support issue, and even though it took longer, it seemed like a supervisor came with my reshipment of chicken to make sure it was good.  Best thin crust pizza I've had in a long time.  Minor technical difficulty over ordering chicken from the website (which, remember, has nothing to do with this store), a great on floor worker, a great set of trainee delivery staff.  It was all great, just please be patient with a skeleton crew and website issues.  The staff at this location is GREAT.  Corporate just needs to give them an extra body in the kitchen and a designated receptionist to answer all the unlv college folks ordering from them.  You guys are seriously good and patient, it was a great experience!  Still our favorite pizza, even better than it was before.",BLf28UYslnUpLGvr2r9NBQ,0,0,4,j1YnIRmA4cNt_5REaO1xcQ

What I got was a big dinner box with wings that were hastily splashed with sauce, not really on them, but in the foil they were tossed into. Asked for hut seasoning on both of them, got it on one. Asked for one of the pizzas to be well done- they were barely baked. As I was eating the pizza I kept coming across hairs. I have a dog and the hairs looked similar enough that I just figured it was from my dog. The red flag should have been that they were in places where my dogs hair shouldn't have been able to get to since I had just opened the pizza box, such as under the pizza crust. Fast forward to the next day eating left overs. I come across more little hairs that look like they could be from our dog, until I find one really long one that is baked into the cheese/pepperoni. My girlfriend and I immediately stop eating the pizza, feeling sick knowing that the hairs now from the day before were probably also not from our dog. So the moral of this story is-- steer very clear of this location and possibly just Pizza Huts in general. But hey, I'm out $24.36 and people will still probably go to this location, so they are the real winners here. You've been warned.",OBnNMI3XXWRH9NWRWQe1VQ,1,0,1,3Z67gCD6gerI72WqhGiA-w

I called the store and was told they do not carry ketchup (Seriously?). I asked them to take the french fries off of my order since I don't eat fries without ketchup, didn't have any myself and they don't serve catchup.

They refused and hung up on me.

Never again. Scum bag on the phone and I will be contesting this credit card charge.

Update: I had the charge taking off my credit card, but only the amount for the fries and the tip. As far as the so-called ""manager"" hanging up on me? His manager has been notified, as well as the parent company. If I could give negative stars I would. Despicable behavior.

As for the food; mediocre. Just about what you'd expect.",1cBDrX70myz_T4Xn-VNEiw,0,0,1,HyBaHk_Ubo4gJB78_CSDtg
