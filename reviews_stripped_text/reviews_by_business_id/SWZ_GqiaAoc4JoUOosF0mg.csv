Since we waited til after 9 we were glad we were covered anyway. Walked in the unlocked door and the case was already filled with pastries. We waited and waited for ANYONE who worked to greet us and take our order. After several minutes a woman came from the back and yelled at us from the kitchen that they werent open until 11! Good customer service in normal businesses is that you have hours of operation posted accordingly and if you have special circumstance post it on the door and lock the doors if you are not going to open at the posted time!,O1TtesYy3Z8T94KLJIvVXw,0,0,1,3itiDzJSHFdrCmIK3Mbhkw

Although they seem helpful, it's a mess when trying to get details in order. As it was a special occasion I went along with their ideas as they are professionals. 

Went two months in advance to get everything in order. At the time we loved what samples they had us sample. Everything at that point seemed perfect. 
The staff was friendly, the music nice, the Cuban sandwich is amazing. 

But, unfortunately this service was not what we received the day of the party. 
We had an extremely late cake delivery (it supposed to arrive at 5pm, yet it arrived at 8pm waaaaaay past original time.) 

The cake was also extremely dry. Not compared to what I sampled at the store. 
The details were changed in the cake as some of the ribbon colors weren't what we had agreed on. 

None of my guests enjoyed the cake, and 80% of the cake went to waste. These are one of the worst experiences I've ever had.",SYh45Q4OUwI6xPjXJHhrxw,1,0,1,5qU14j1_LKj0HgqI0LusVw

The guava turnover was pretty good though and their guava was sweeter not tart like Portos which I did like. :-) I tried talking to the employees more about their new business but I guess their English isn't that great and they didn't understand half the things I was saying, oh wells they were still nice and tried lol. 3 stars for now but will come back to grab a drink and food as they are open pretty late and cus I just love the atmosphere here!",lzr7VA0h_YTYEY-mkK1eZg,2,2,3,kS37abgDFKj54zIrS18Smw

2960645,2016-07-11,0,SWZ_GqiaAoc4JoUOosF0mg,"Wanted to try something new and close to home so came here today for lunch.

Unlike others we had good service.

Since I am not that familiar with Cuban food, the only Cuban food I can compare this to is Porto's Bakery in Glendale and Downey, California. Porto's food and pastries are amazing.  Everytime you go to Porto's the lines are long and it's always packed. 

Sadly, the Sugar Corner is no Porto's.  Not that they don't give it a good try, but the food and pastry quality are not amazing like at Porto's. 

On the plus side, this restaurant is exceptionally clean and like I noted the service was good, even though our waiter spoke very little English.

For lunch we had a Cuban and Medianoche Sandwich both with fries.  What I noticed right away is that the bread was quite dry.  The meat and cheeses were good, but the dry bread hurt an otherwise good sandwich.  The fries that came with it were cold.

We also had a Guava smoothie, this was very good, creamy and tasty. 

We brought home some pastires and they just can't compare to the freshness and quality of Porto's.  They are good, but not worth the expense of $1.50 per item when you can get better guava pastry at Porto's for $8 for a dozen. 

I like to support new places, but The Sugar Corner will need to bring the baked items up to a better quality for me to want to return.",Tk6GBteWESMezm8EDPwo8g,0,0,3,KHtgiKoizscqlmQHx03AhQ

First let me start off by saying I spend about $10 more than i did when it was rolys bakery. Things that were $6 or $7 are now $9-12. It took them literally 20 minutes to make 2 sandwiches. Why is it so difficult to make 2 sandwiches im not clear on that. There was no one there so no line i was the one and only customer there and 20 minutes for two sandwiches? Really? The first time I ordered a cake and it wasn't the right one i ordered. The 2nd time I went to introduce my girlfriend to cuban food..well..20 mins for 2 cuban pizzas and they gave us the wrong drinks. Seriously let down.

4686625,2016-08-11,0,SWZ_GqiaAoc4JoUOosF0mg,"Stopped by around 1:45  pm on a Thursday. The place was really dead. So to begin, I don't like how they have a locked door during business hours and not a sign on that door to look to the right or something for the door they actually use. I looked in the facility and I see a woman on the phone. I'm not sure if she saw me but she looked over at my direction and the second time she glanced at me, she pointed toward the direction of the door. She was really nice though! She was the one who rang me up and everything. 

I was not looking to eat a meal, I just wanted to check out their pastries. I got 3 kinds: 

Beef pastry - I was looking forward to trying this out, hoping it would be somewhat similar to the one I've tried at a different Cuban bakery on Sahara or something. Unfortunately, it fell short. There wasn't enough beef inside (it actually didn't even look like beef on the inside...) and the meat was too salty. I couldn't finish the whole thing. 

Cheese roll - this one actually wasn't bad. Not too sweet, just right. I would've loved to see more cheese on the inside tho. There was barely anything inside. 

Guava pastry - this was my favorite out of the three. However, as I kept eating, it got sweeter and sweeter. I'm sure it's supposed to be sweet but I would've liked it to be a little on the less side. Really good tho! 

I think this place just opened a couple of months ago, but I hope that they are able to make some changes to their food. I'm sure everyone's made the comparison to porto's & it just can't compete. I don't think I would go out of my way for this place but if I'm around this area, I might give it another shot.",WPcEBAbrPZxvCGlvH9XLsQ,2,1,3,BPgel7biq48XfNOldccTYw

Sadly, such bakeries are few and far between out here, so we were eagerly anticipating the reopening of Roly's (now The Sugar Corner). I am assuming the staff has changed because the food on our take-out order was such a disappointment. Not to mention many menu items are now more expensive (something we didn't notice, in our enthusiasm, until after we had ordered). The pan con bistec (steak sandwich) that I used to get for $8 or so from Roly's was a wonderful sandwich with a nicely-sized marinated steak on fresh Cuban bread.  This time we got a $15 (!) ""ranchero steak"" sandwich that was tasteless, and frankly, inedible. The bread was hard and seemingly stale to the point that I had to throw it away after two bites. My Cuban mother was sad they no longer have guava-cheese pastelitos, but she said the guava pastry she got was too dry anyway. The picadillo (meat filling) in what is usually my favorite pastry was on the spicy side and too peppery to taste Cuban, although the pastelito itself was flaky enough. This bakery used to be worth the trip from Summerlin, but I am not sure that is still the case.

5085073,2016-06-25,4,SWZ_GqiaAoc4JoUOosF0mg,"I had a craving for Porto's guava pastries and cheese rolls and I stumbled across this Cuban bakery and restaurant. I took a look at the menu, but It was late afternoon and I just wanted to take home a few goodies. They don't call this place the Sugar Corner for nothing! Surely, they do not cut corners when it comes to sugar. I thought their pastries were a too sweet for my taste, but still edible. 

Items tried:
Guava turnover
Coconut turnover
Cheese roll

I liked the guava turnover the best. It is guava and cream cheese on the inside and flaky goodness on the outside. The coconut turnover was okay, not really for me. I did not care for their version of cheese rolls. It did not satisfy my craving. It needed more cheese inside and less sugar on the outside. 

My initial frustrations and confusion started with the 3 doors. Which one is the entrance? I had a lucky guess. Next, do I seat myself or do I just order at the counter? As far as the counters, it looked like 3 different areas with one obviously for alcoholic drinks and another closest to pastries. It wouldn't hurt to place an overhead sign ""order here."" There were enough workers, but it did not feel welcoming. I ended up seating myself since there were no menus on the wall or at the counter. After waiting a couple minutes, I thought standing at the counter might get some attention. Finally, a menu was handed to me. Maybe some time if I am ever in the mood for a Cuban sandwich I'll stop by again.

Patatas bravas was my favorite dish... lots of flavor!! We also tried picadillo and cheese tostones, empanadas, and the Cuban sandwich. The bread on the sandwich is awesome... and French fries are very tasty.
We will be back!",urRHZAQ9jCyMVucpaSw4vA,2,0,4,-2r0K1lkcfw5GWRuY1km6g

I just came from Portos in L.A. and realized how much I am being over charged in Vegas for the same items. Even the guy who helps me when I go told me the prices are too high. But if you are EVER in L.A. and want quality Cuban pastries  then you need to hit up Portos Bakery, 100 times better than the Sugar Corner for a lot less.",wctS9-zOeqzdAoWixTxvwA,1,1,2,1Vk6uw-8i6Abek9Mgmxcnw

My boyfriend got the cuban sandwich which we both enjoyed, but we were blown away by the personal pizza!  There's something about the dough that was light and fluffy and delicious -- if unlike a traditional pizza.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dessert case -- it's the first thing you notice when you walk in.  The deserts are beautiful to behold, and the one we had tasted delicious.  This is definitely a recommend --- particularly for those who spend a lot of time on UNLV campus. The food is very well priced, and delicious!",shBEMbvhDv2spo1o4J29Yg,0,0,4,-wxgo0TcUE_p53lsblV_NQ

We also got Cuban coffees and they were absolutely outstanding. Will be coming back to try their food next time. It looks delicious and I do love some good Ropa Vieja,4XumCjcCk9sHVfXXTsHzcw,0,0,5,wn6uQeH2VYPE-lTmUb5PrQ

They are a Cuban kinda restaurant, I say kinda because the offer different Latin foods, with a Latin bakery and bar it's a crazy combination. I will be back in a few weeks to try the full menu.",jJDEwznWHQIaT4Z0lIFl5A,8,9,4,4CEeIY5xI3U--U83JglRJw
