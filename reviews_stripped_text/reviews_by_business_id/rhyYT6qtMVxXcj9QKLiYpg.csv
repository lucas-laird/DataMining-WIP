2485345,2015-10-07,0,rhyYT6qtMVxXcj9QKLiYpg,"My brother in law and I decided to give this place a try one afternoon for lunch.
Initial appearance inside is ok, they do have a separate area for non smokers and the bar is big with brand new big screen TVs.  
The Stella beer that we had was very cold and nice my gripe right away was when I tried to move the bar stool closer to the bar....its screwed to the floor !  Why ?
We ordered the cheese nachos, French fries, fried mushrooms and a large Stromboli (to go).
The food was quick to arrive and the portions were huge, a order or fries must have been a 1lb or potatoes, the mushrooms were the same, no kidding about 25 breaded dried mushrooms piping hot.  The nachos were also huge, but after digging into them from the top, you soon realize that underneath the cheese, sour cream and guacamole, all you have is bare nachos.
The Stromboli arrived and when I say it was two foot long I was probably underestimating, it must have weighed 4lbs and was enough to feed 10.  
I didn't get a chance to eat the Stromboli but my brother in law said it was ok, a little salty but not bad.
If you want a ice cold beer and huge food portions this is your place, I did feel that the place caters to the elder generation, ( just by who was there when we where there).
Overall not a bad place, I'd give it another try but it won't take me away from other bars in the area.",srsIW-KsmybstPTbgUpusw,0,0,3,13a1NkPeqIcz3jymphchgg

When we first walked in, we didn't see anybody. There was no one that greeted us, not even anyone at the bar. We figured they must be closing, so we walked out. As we were getting into our car, the bartender ran out and asked us if we were trying to eat there. We said yes and he told us to come in and that he was just in the back when we walked in. 

They serve breakfast from 10pm-noon and the prices range from $3.25 (oatmeal) to $6.50 (steak and eggs). We already knew we wanted steak and eggs, so we ordered it right away. It's a pretty good deal. You get a 7 oz. New York steak served with two eggs, cottage fries and toast for only $6.50. 

As we waited for our meals, we perused through the menu. There's about 10 items on the breakfast menu including country fried steak, steak n eggs, hot cakes, build your own omelet, biscuits n gravy, oatmeal, a breakfast special with 2 eggs/your choice of meat/toast/cottage fries, french toast, and a protein plate. It pretty much has everything you need for a great breakfast and for cheap!

We got our dishes. They were decently portioned and the meat was well cooked and tender. I really enjoyed the cottage fries with some ketchup and the eggs were nice and fluffy.

It was listed at $5 on the menu. When I ordered, the person serving us said they weren't sure how to make it... Because they were ""just"" the manager. The ingredients were simple- grape vodka, soda, sprite, and a splash of chambord- so I said I wouldn't be too picky. It came out really strong, but I could deal with it. I was surprised, however, that a manager would not know how to make a signature drink. My husband ordered a Blue Moon and we got some potato skins to share. He put $20 in the machine and we settled in. Service was a bit neglectful; we had to pile our dishes and flag the manager down to get our bill. It was not very busy, either. There was one other patron at the bar. 

Our bill was confusing to say the least. I was charged $5.75 for my $5 drink. There was a mysterious charge for 3x $0.25. And my husband was charged for his beer despite playing $20. We paid and left- no goodbye or thank you from anyone. 

It's a shame because I'd liked the T Bird prior to today, and we live nearby. We will be voting with our money, though. Bars like this are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas.",SoAs3jRvZb_cLQ5FNlg8iA,1,0,2,sLRxZ_2qciza2fG7H3Co3Q

Food always come out quick and good.  I've also been to the older location on Eastern.   Always good food and service there too.",keBv05MsMFBd0Hu98vXThQ,0,0,5,8MH7EgpdhhYWVr2SVPPNrg

5361425,2011-06-19,0,rhyYT6qtMVxXcj9QKLiYpg,"**Summary**
       - Flavor - I like the cottage potatoes over regular boring hash browns. Steak and eggs quality wise, it's one of the best for under $8.
       - Value - They have some pretty good food for such a cheap price. The best value is from 10pm to noon the next day where they have the breakfast specials and the $6.50 steak and eggs. The deals during the regular hours aren't bad either.
**Price**
       - $6.50 7 oz. steak and eggs
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place for a cheap, yet quality late night or morning meal.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,0,0,4,YHnoG-v0rc85NTVWWC5FiA

5499033,2012-04-18,1,rhyYT6qtMVxXcj9QKLiYpg,"Probably the cheapest video poker tavern bar food in the Blue Diamond/Enterprise area. It's a good value but you get what you pay for, as most of the food is unremarkable, if well portioned.

The chicken fingers are so-so, but the assortment of sauces offered with them helps. I went with the hot buffalo. I also added on a pile of dry, overcooked, frozen crinkle cut fries for $1, which I regretted.

The potato skins, housemade quarter-potato chunks, get loaded with large pieces of bacon and cheese, with only the slightest bit of sour cream to lubricate your throat. The stromboli is huge, cheesy and possibly the saltiest thing I've ever eaten.

As far as video poker taverns go, this one is kind of blah on the inside. One pool table, sort of barren beige decor. The staff always seems friendly enough but this just seems like a depressing place for a meal or a drink. Do yourself a favor and pay the 50 cents per item surcharge to get yours to go.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,1,3,UX3hWpSYav9HV6OK0kjbAA
5701722,2016-04-24,0,rhyYT6qtMVxXcj9QKLiYpg,"This place was an unexpected surprise.  My husband has been coming here to eat for a long time.  He told me it was good, but I wasn't sure how good.  I was thinking, it's bar food, can't be that different.  I've tasted the onion rings here, mozzarella sticks, caesar chicken salad and a burger.  All have been great.  I think they just do simple things, like changing out the oil they use regularly, but whatever they're doing is really making a difference.  Great comfort food when you get the chance to splurge on the calories :)",U7licBIRdyT0DDSqEWWQIg,0,0,5,Jb5TIw_QAZrspHLrQwobwA
5872593,2013-12-07,1,rhyYT6qtMVxXcj9QKLiYpg,"Holy crap! This place surprised the hell out of me! I drive by this place everyday on the way home. It's right off Blue Diamond and Lindell in the same shopping center as the Star Nursery. There is nothing in this shopping center other than these two things. I don't know why but from the outside and the name of the place, I was hardly expecting much. 

What I found inside was quite a surprise. This wasn't a crappy run down bar. This was a bar that rivals most neighborhood bars I've been to. They've got the entertainment (pool table and shuffleboard) in their own little sections with separate seating for good size parties. The place is spacious inside with plenty of seating. There's also a cool-lookin jukebox with a nice selection. 

For Christmas, they've decorated the place up quite nice. During my visit, the staff was really friendly and always had smiles on their faces. The service was prompt and I had no complaints whatsoever. They had hefeweizen on draft which made me super happy also.

But THE most impressive part of the place even after everything I've mentioned thus far? The food. Holy s!$t... The lady told me before I ordered the wings that they beat out Buffalo Wild Wings and Hooters... I thought, ""Yea right, but whatever. I'm hungry."" Dude. They're not messin around. The wings were OUTSTANDING! And they indeed hit my top place to eat wings of all time, and I am a bar food veteran (I don't know if I'm proud of that, though). 

My wife ate a California chicken club that had fresh bacon and guac which was amazing too. I could totally see this being my new favorite spot for a drink and some dinner in a pinch. There's nothing better than my wife's Nepali dishes she cooks, but this place came pretty damn close. Even she loved the place, and she isn't impressed too easily.

Needless to say, we'll be back. I had no complaints whatsoever. They had it all. I think more people should know about the magic that happens at this place. I'm surprised I was born and raised in Las Vegas, I've been to hundreds of bars, and I've never walked in to one of these bars. 

Man, they've really got it goin on at this place. I can't say enough great things about it. Just trust me, though. You won't be disappointed.",l_yEb3Q-q7C5Eq1HReCrzw,5,4,5,0X1BTaJxNJkCY1BH56RZzg
5933851,2012-03-05,0,rhyYT6qtMVxXcj9QKLiYpg,"I'm not a ""bar food"" kinda person, but this place is close to my house so I decided to give it a try. So far we've had the sliders which are awesome, the pizza (thin crust) surprisingly awesome, and breakfast for around $5 which was way better that most casino breakfasts for a fraction of the price. Also the bartenders are super friendly every time we've been in. It's close, it's quick, it's cheap, now I just wish they'd deliver!",bvPS4vrfiO7ZZ4KAo8KBTw,0,0,4,VhMME2Gu7XcAXSz0HS92_A
