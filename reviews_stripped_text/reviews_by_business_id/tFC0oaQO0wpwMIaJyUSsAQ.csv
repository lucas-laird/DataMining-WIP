I m so glad they r finally open their business in LV. And of all the location, they chose to set up shop inside the Venetian! Major crudos! Because of the popular location, their prices r a bit higher than most Paris Baguette outlets I've been to. But if U were to buy a cup of coffee n a piece of their awesome pastry n get a corner view table upstairs. It will be worth every penny.

There were less or unavailable options both times we visited, namely the royal pudding 2 days in a row after 5 pm.  Staff is okay, not very engaged and always behind the counter not paying attention.  The blueberry scoop cake was $7.00 but really was more cream than any cake at all.

The croissant was the most buttery and flaky croissant I have ever had. You hear phrases like ""mouth watering."" Each bite of this croissant does such a phrase justice.

The grapefuit juice comes in a glass bottle with a cork in it. A classy touch and a great keepsake.

Most of the items on this/their yelp page is no longer available. IT's better for you to straight up ignore the pictures of the said products they offer, all are no longer being offered (apple tart, poke bowls, everything else pictured).

Baguette sandwiches were much better than we had anticipated. I got the one with pastrami and it was very good. It was a large sandwich and I realized afterwards it would've been better for my sister and I to share, as we also purchased desserts. She got a sandwich with pesto and other stuff and she quite liked hers as well. The fruit tart was very good and stacked high. The royal pudding, I could've done without but it came in such a cute glass jar. 

However, we came a few hours before closing and found out they don't even bother to make more of items they were out of by that time. We thought they would've given how much time was left that the store would've been opened but it seems like they make what they make every day, and if they are out, you are out of luck.

I was the first customer and was greeted by the friendliest barista who made great coffee recommendations and patiently answered my questions. I ordered the Caramel Latte with Soy Milk and this is the best latte I have EVER had! Perfectly heated and frothy, not too sweet and perked me right up for my work day. They even let me try a sample of their house iced coffee since I was worried it might be too sweet for me. 

I have been alternating between their Latte and their House Iced Coffee and both are delicious. The iced coffee is pre-made and has a lot of flavor to it. I recommend diluting it with some black iced coffee because it is pretty sweet or just letting the ice melt a little.

Their baguette and panini sandwiches looked delicious so I will definitely stop by for lunch one day this week while working out of the hotel. Might also have to bring the husband by for a fruit tart or mini alfajor (our fave!!) when he gets out of his conference. I was sad that they didn't have any cronuts this week like another Yelper had mentioned.

So happy I found a reasonably priced coffee/breakfast/lunch spot :)

Tip
* Soy milk is 65 cents extra
* Dilute the iced coffee with black iced coffee if you don't want it too sweet",d9-5Qb4NOG3dBvdZ32zO8Q,3,2,4,WCOxNE7nnZ4GtP77w_w6wA

For pastries/bread, I definitely recommend the Raspberry hibiscus bombolone, blueberry  cream cheese pastry and the Hash brown one which also has ham in it! And Feulletes  Au Chocolat. Pronounced ""Fay-day"" I believe.  I've yet to try more~

They freshly squeeze their orange juices and grapefruit juices and they come on this tall slim glass bottle with a classic corkscrew that you get to keep! Lovely souvenir along with my 4 royal pudding bottles, which btw ; Their pudding is sooo  yummy and worth trying! Also comes in cute tiny bottles. Good packaging always sells!

For the cakes, I have not yet been disappointed. I've tried the green tea chiffon , blueberry chiffon , tiramisu  creampuff and chocolate cake.

2208441,2016-01-08,8,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"With so many fancy pastry shops between the Venetian and Palazzo, I was curious to see what Paris Baguette had to offer. They stay open until 11pm on week nights so I enjoyed a stroll through the Palazzo and visited PB a little after 10 pm on a night I got out of work early, rather than making a special trip to the Strip. It was not hard to find as I'm very familiar with St. Mark's Square, but the shop was smaller than expected. For some reason the photos had me anticipating a palace of pastries. My friend Jean posted some great photos. I was just looking for Fluffy Bear's photos but her account is gone. :(

The shop was filled with more employees than patrons as I took a few minutes to make my selections from the bakery cases. Everything looked pretty good, but nothing really caught my eye. The savory dishes looked weak. I placed a guava turnover and chocolate cream cheese bread on my tray and ordered a strawberry pudding and house iced coffee from the cashier. The total was around $15, which is average. The quality is higher than what you will find in Chinatown and the bread loaf was much larger than a single serving.

Initially feeling skeptical, I was very happy with my selections upon tasting! The house iced coffee was strong but sweet, and would have been better with a splash of black coffee to reduce the sugar. The turnover had crisp puff pastry and a nice guava filling. The chocolate bread was a cocoa-flavored yeast dough mixed with chocolate chips and pockets of cream cheese. I'd prefer more cream cheese, but after I toasted a slice and spread cookie butter on top, it was irresistible. The strawberry pudding is really cute and also really tasty. The burnt sugar sauce at the bottom of the jar makes me think of flan. Most importantly, baked items are prepared throughout the day, so everything I picked was fresh just before closing. There are date/time stamps and nutritional information beside the labels on the displays.

Overall, I was impressed with the unique pastry options at PB. It seems like a good location to meet an out-of-town visitor for a quick breakfast or lunch on the Strip.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,11,8,4,gtwmHL7SZ6iK48yHyyTrwQ

I had: 
- Caramel Latte $7: dissapointed on their coffee drinks. I had to wait 15 minutes for my drinks and I was not sure what kind of coffee beans they used, but I could only taste the sweetness and not the coffee. I also did not smell the coffee aroma at all. 
- Chocolate Croissant $4: two thumbs down, it did not taste like a fresh made one. Tasted like a cheap chocolate and the pastry was soggy. Not even close with some of my favorites local bakeries in town. 
- Portugese sausage bun with corn $4: it was okay. The sausage was small and the cream corn taste like it was from a can. 
- Macaroons $5: I found their plastic-taste macaroons was detestable! I felt like I ate a playdough. It was hideous. 

They had couple tables on the second floor available with the view of the square. That was the only highlight of the day. 

This place will not be getting a second visit from me.",XU-JR0vGW1_O5GmNwZ0bfQ,3,0,3,9zw_GtKl5FG6tyADWOCyyw

Their matcha, chocolate, and blueberry chiffon cakes are also elegant and delicious.

A few occasions, I see at least 4 workers behind the counter and us customers have a line forming. They were all talking to each other...laughing and chatting. And yet.....they somehow forgot they have customers to attend to. Were we invisible or something?

A few times, my coffee drink wasn't completely filled up to the brim. I'm sorry but when you charge me $6+ dollars for a small 12 oz coffee, I expect 12 ounces of coffee in there. (see pic attached.) Not too pleased with that.

I give this place 3 stars because I found most of their items slightly overpriced in comparison to other bakeries I have been to in Chinatown. They also don't have a wide selection for drinks - just the basics.

Pastrami & Hvarti
BLT
Cheese Dog
Guava Turnover
Split Polish Dog

We have quite a few PB in the bay area now and I noticed the pastries are different than the selection that was available here. I feel that the pastries are definitely more catered to European clientele as there aren't as many Asian flavors. I highly suggest getting the puddings in the tiny glass jars in the refrigerated section if they have them available. My favorite flavor is the Royal Pudding out of all the available flavors (cappuccino & strawberry are other options). Their cakes are as yummy as they look. 

Running short on time before our spa appointment and having not yet eaten lunch, my sister and I grabbed a few pastries and sandwiches to dull our hunger a little till our reservation for high tea. Enjoyed watching the silent jesters performing in the square as we ate. Sandwiches were just ok. I'd stick to the pastries.

I've seen this place under construction for months while visiting Vegas in the past but never got to see it open until today. Came by last night during a family triphowever they said it won't be open til the 18th. I came back this morning and the interior is simply beautiful! Being a loyal customer, I noticed that they used a different theme for this store than the usual cool blue and grey colors at SoCal stores. This store actually has two-stories, where customers can sit and watch the mini opera going on downstairs in St. Mark's Square! So Clever. The store itself is actually located in the middle of St. Mark's, next to Pandora. 
My mom and I split a grilled four cheese sandwich and a grilled chicken, bacon, and brie. The grilled cheese comes on a regular whole wheat toast, while the latter on a baguette. They were both tasty and rich, and I noticed that their baguette tastes much better toasted than not from the sandwich. We also shared a lemon spritzer and cafe mocha. The baristas were friendly and they even drew a heart on my latte, which was a nice gesture.

3368273,2016-08-09,0,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"My wife and I had a Poke bowl here.  I love Poke bowls, but as far as they go, the ones we got from Paris Baguette were decent, but certainly not great and probably not even good.  At best, average.

If that were the end, I would give it three stars.  But there are several things that drop it down 1/2 star each, all the way down to one star.

First, we waited in line approximately 1/2 hour on a Monday after 1:00 p.m.  This was not a holiday or anything.  Just really slow service and not enough people.  (I was craving a Poke bowl, though, so we waited.)

Second, the prices were too high.  A good Poke bowl almost anywhere is around $'10.  Here, they charge $13 for the large (which is a normal bowl anywhere else), and they are super stingy with the fish.  I asked for tuna as one of my proteins, and I got exactly 3 tiny pieces of tuna.  It wasn't just me -- they were super stingy on everyone's bowl.  And then I got a plastic bottle of Coke.  $3.  You've got to be kidding.

Third, when I got to the register and started to pay, my wife noticed that they had tacked on an extra charge (I think $1.25) for avocado.  Neither of us got avocado.   When my wife called the cashier out on it, I was expecting a look of ""whoops, it looked like there was avocado, sorry for the mistake.""  Instead, the look on the cashier's face was, ""whoops, I just got caught taking a cookie from the cookie jar I knew I wasn't supposed to touch.""  The look on her face screamed out that she knew exactly what she had done.  If you go here, pay very careful attention to what they are charging you for.  Judging by the guilty look on the cashier's face, I suspect I'm not the only one she's tried this on.

Fourth, we asked for soy sauce, and the cashier said they don't have soy sauce.  That's just weird.  Especially because we found soy sauce in the condiments rack upstairs.

Fifth, we ate upstairs.  Don't make the same mistake.  The upstairs seating area is a total dump.  Sit outside the store in the canal area instead.

If you are Jonesing for a Poke bowl and can tolerate all these problems, the Poke bowl isn't horrible, and there aren't many Poke bowl places nearby.  Just make sure you set aside plenty of time to stand in line, check your receipt carefully to ensure you aren't overcharged, sit outside the store, ignore the cashier's claim that they don't have the condiments you want, and be prepared to pay too much for a Poke bowl.  Other than that, it's OK.",FvjhVWS4L4rPAumWpmMwZA,1,0,1,EH7uUa6hxxPHxSmKxt7RKA

I got a croissant around 4 pm, which was still semi-fresh, and the price was reasonable (expensive, yes, but it's Vegas, after all!). I also purchased their freshly-squeezed orange juice, probably because the packaging was irresistible, and for ~$6, I got to drink something that felt healthier than a lot of other food options in Vegas. The atmosphere was brightly lit and inviting, and from afar you'd think it is really clean, but it was a bit too dirty for my liking, with straw wrappers, napkins, sugar, and coffee stains on the table. I wasn't sure why it wasn't cleaned up, since it pretty empty, but it's no big deal. I enjoyed finding a cute little place to rest and snack at after walking all day!

4018660,2017-12-01,1,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"In general, this is a solid pastry place with coffee offerings and other baked goods (cakes mostly) plus sandwiches. But during a convention hosted in the Venetian, this place is the best. Also killer view of the grand canale restaurants when you sit upstairs. 

If you're staying in the venetian, it's a great place to enjoy coffee and pastries or grabbing something quick. I personally love the croissants and house iced coffee which has a hint of hazelnut? And I really love the upstairs seating where you can people watch and enjoy the fake almost real looking sky. 

But why I really decided to review this place is because of a recent convention I had here. I attended AWS annual conference which had what seemed like thousands of people all crowded up in the Venetian Convention Center. 

Conventions usually start in the morning and everyone needs their coffee/quick breakfast. Right below this place is Starbucks and it's the closest Starbucks to the Venetian convention center. So that means, the Starbucks had a line like you would not believe... And not just morning but all day. So what do you do? Wait for eternity or suck it up OR go to Paris Baguette. Located right above the Starbucks via an easy elevator or escalator. The prices are comparable and Paris Baguette has way more options for food!

So secret pro tip for conventioners, skip the Starbucks like and head upstairs for Paris Baguette.",aFfbVxPah25PrdwDj9l17g,1,2,4,BXND3LkMGieL9b0HCAF_4A

4352205,2017-02-21,1,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"I've been wanting to try this Paris Baguette location ever since I moved to Las Vegas. I lived in South Korea for a while, and Paris Baguettes are plentiful over in Seoul. I'm not sure if it's because this location is in the Venetian, but the selection isn't as great as other Paris Baguette locations. There is an adequate selection of cakes, pastries (both sweet and savory), and sandwiches. I believe they just added a poke bowl option which I haven't tried yet, but seeing as Paris Baguette is geared more towards pastries/coffee, I'm hesitant to try it. It's like ordering the seafood at a steakhouse--it'll probably be decent but come on, it's not really why you're there.

I came specifically for milk bread and the cheesecake. They didn't have the milk bread which is disappointing, but I did get the cheesecake. They have the Korean/Japanese style of cheesecake where it is a lot fluffier/less dense than typical American cheesecakes. I personally prefer the Korean/Japanese style cheesecakes because they're more flavorful and the texture is so light. I also got several other things like the polish sausage with corn pastry, chocolate chip bread bowl, and the raspberry cream cheese danish. They're all pretty decent.


Reason for the 3 stars- I had the coffee offer from Yelp, and I showed mine and my friend's yelp app to the cashier, but he still charged me for the coffee. I don't think he heard me or realized that I had 2 yelp coffee offers, but I just paid it anyway since it's only $3 (which is only like 3 arizona iced teas--I just equate things in arizona iced teas to make me feel better about how much I had to pay). I took the $3 hit to my credit card because the cashier was already working hard and probably just forgot.

Overall, there's a decent coffee offer on Yelp, the upstairs seating has a good view, and the selection is sub par compared to other Paris Baguettes.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,1,1,3,Dube5pMpRfLya2P0g4dkyA

4654831,2017-12-31,7,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"This Paris Baguette stands out from the hundreds of locations throughout the globe. It stands out on account of the fact that it overlooks St. Mark's Square and is a mile up a boulevard from the Eiffel Tower and practically across the street from Rome. Because of its unparalleled location, spending time in the Grand Canal Shops Paris Baguette is unique quality time. Throughout the year I have crossed Venice to appreciate unique quality time in this Parisan themed eatery. Although I visit throughout the year, my most treasured time spent here has been during the Christmas season when the Las Vegas Strip is transformed into a Christmas Winter Wonderland. It is the prime location adjacent to St. Mark's Square that has led me here from the grueling hot days of July to the jolly days of Christmas.

  Located a few feet from the statue performer and festivities in St. Mark's Square, this is a relatively large eatery that occupies two floors. The first floor is the Bakery. The second floor is the second floor lounge that overlooks St. Mark's Square and the kitchen. The stairs leading upstairs read off the ingredients one step at a time. Rising above the stairs the Paris Baguette mission statement reads, 

"" More than a bakery, more than a cafe. A wondrous place where making delectable treats has been a specialty for generations, and for decades has brought the magic of Paris to homes all over the world.""

It is a magic that appears in the display cases throughout the first floor. These display cases feature magical breads and pastries, cakes, desserts, sandwiches, and specialty drinks including coffee. During the Christmas season, Holiday treats including gingerbread cookies join the line up. Following my written words my words through pictures describe the magical treats that Paris Baguette sells. Now I will describe the treats that I have devoured.

The word ""baguette"" means a long thin loaf of French bread. The bread that I devoured were more on the round side and sweet. During my visits, I had enjoyed their croissant, blueberry and cream cheese danish, and a Ganache choro bombo, amungst other treats. They are tasty treats that I am led to believe that their pastry chefs make in the kitchen on the second floor. With the food, I had perked up with a cup of coffee. During the past couple of years, the coffee has been a jolly good deal. That is because the Yelp Check-in offer made it free with a purchase. It is my understanding that their good coffee is Cafe Adagio. By the way, there have been times where I only brought their coffee that costs $3 to sip and savour a few feet away on a bench in Saint Mark's Square. One more time, I strive to enthasize that this  is a prime location in the Grand Canal Shops serving good products. 

It is in the second floor lounge where I had stepped out of the fast pace of the Las Vegas Strip to relax in a glorified balcony overlooking St. Mark's Square. I am amazed that a few people are aware of this spot. In the Christmas season, a Christmas tree at the corner created an extra touch of coziness. Cognizant of this cozy Parisan spot overlooking Venice, there had been instances where I escaped into the written words of a good book while seated on a comfortable chair. This is a cozy spot that also overlooks the hustle and bustle of the pastry chefs creating their magical treats. However, after the sun has set during the Christmas season, they have long left the building.

Knowing in the back of my mind that 2017 will soon be transitioning into 2018, my intention was to write what is possibly my ultimate review of the year on a unique business. In conclusion, the Grand Canal Shops Paris Baguette serves good food that is the admission to a seat in an exceptional location.

Happy New Year! May 2018 be fantastic.

I have also had their vanilla pudding. It came in a cute little bottle. It was sweet and creamy but in my opinion it was a little too soft. The texture was closer to yogurt then it was to pudding. The taste was great nonetheless.

They offer coffee and other pastries but honestly the coffee didn't look good but I'm not a coffee drinker so I guess my opinion probably doesn't matter much. Overall I love it.,97Zn9QDuzgd9c_gFjScPsg,1,1,5,GA1U35ZlnevB6BLeSVSumw

The almond croissant had a nice crunch and buttery flakiness that was off the chains.  For a great view, make sure you grab a seat upstairs overlooking the market square.  

Great selection of pastries and decent prices for Vegas.  Will definitely stop back here the next time I'm staying at the Palazzo or Venetian.",XIe4u72yFOufyrZyOcIPBQ,0,0,4,a-_7xOmd5SOEd-Stai9cgQ
4957294,2017-07-01,0,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"Paris Baguettes are common in NYC, but for some odd reasons (or maybe it's just my personal bias), I did not expect to see one in Las Vegas. I was surprised to find it at the Venetian casino (why is it not in the Paris casino?). I even doubted that it was the same Paris Baguette chain so much that I just had to go to confirm for myself. I entered the store in disbelief, but it all changed when I spotted the red bean bread. Okay, that totally screamed Paris Baguette.

The bread selection was much smaller than the stores in NY, but they had some pizza-esque ciabatta that I had never seen in a NY store before. They also had a salad station as well.

I had a hard time deciding what to have, I ended up getting a crab croquette, which was only 2.75, a price you do not commonly see on the Strip. I was very content with how economical my lunch would be until I ordered a coffee to pair with the croquette. A small cup of hot coffee was $3, more than the croquette!

While I understand it's a store inside the Venetian so the rent must be through the roof, but it just doesn't make sense to charge more for a regular cup of coffee that requires no barista skills to prepare, should cost more than the food itself..Had they reversed the prices, say, 3 bucks for the croquette and 2.75 for the coffee, that would feel much more rational.

In any case, I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the pricey coffee.

Pros: economical snack/lunch if you skip coffee and it's by that square where the have performances so you can be entertained while you eat.

Cons: coffee is pricey",_riCbm0rAhaMNJOjd2cr8Q,0,0,4,aVlFc6ZO3a5TQxoFDkeFUg

I started this review months ago when we stopped in for lunch and they were out of so much Poké bowl product.  It was so bad that I took photos of their empty containers but deleted them when I decided to not pursue with the review. Their excuse was ""we were busy earlier"". 

Many visits later, they're still running out of product! It's a good day when we come in and everything is available. We keep returning because honestly the bowls are amazing!  We've got so many coworkers hooked on them and it's a nice change to our cafeteria food we eat 5 days a week and want to treat ourselves but just wish their product was fully available.

5118075,2016-01-13,0,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"What a cute little gem. We ordered 3 macarons (rose, earl grey and pistachio) and a green tea chiffon cake. There is actually a dining area on the second floor of the bakery (Yelp tip) so we headed upstairs and enjoyed our view of St Mark's Square from above.

I was very impressed with the macarons. They had the perfect combination of flavor and sweetness. Most macarons I've tried (including Pierre Herme and Ladurée) and those that friends have baked are way too sweet! Same with cakes. The chiffon cake was light and airy and a very good size to split among 2+ people. 

I'd also like to point out that their staff is so patient and polite. There were 2 customers before me and were both demanding and rude. However, the cashier was patient and polite and carried out the customers' requests including repackaging the desserts to individual boxes and bags, and providing cake cutter and candles (when only a single slice of cake was purchased) after payment.",mfwAsQU3_TlZgkkkjZMtQQ,2,0,4,9uCHYdTIHtZnKUU0ZMzHaw
5138943,2017-05-31,3,tFC0oaQO0wpwMIaJyUSsAQ,"As any nosey K-drama fan would, I had to add Paris Baguette to my list of musts, since their logo/name pops up prominently on so many sponsored end credits. And with over 1800+ locations, probably one on every other block in Seoul, this is Nevada's first PB, located inside Venetian's Grand Canal Shoppes. 

The mini chocolate croissant (Cocossant) was nice & flaky and only $1.50. I was tempted by a raspberry cronut but I had other dessert stops on my itinerary and had to decline.

To be expected their regular sized pastries & desserts are on the pricey side and they do have a few take home/souvenir treats attractively packed for purchase.

They also had similar pastries that can be found at home (macarons, sausage bread, mushipan, cream cakes, etc).

If I was staying at the Venetian, or somewhere close by, I would've returned to try their quick bites (sandwiches, ice cream popsicles, iced coffee, etc) & stopped in upstairs for a relaxing break to people watch from above.",mwc8rVfuwgfh13HB6hxYmw,2,2,4,33KtBJBKMt57xMlh5rjSfg

I liked this place. It's small, neat and to the point for typical french bagutte and pastries. The pastrami baguette that I ordered was great and the express was good. Here are my not so great comments: 1. The girl behind the counter was rude. I took the coffee and was waiting outside for my baguette but after a while I figured they had forgotten, so I went back inside. She was so rude and asked me if I really ordered a pastrami and who was the person that rung me up. I told her it was her. She denied it and very rudely said: just go sit down will get it to you. Even dogs aren't told to ""just sit down"" especially for a mistake they made.
2. Their espresso is offered in a paper cup like the ones we use in bathrooms for mouth wash. I asked her to pour my espresso in a real porcelain cup and she said they don't have any. I'm sorry but if I'm sitting to drink my coffee k would like a real cup so I don't feel like I'm drinking my coffee in the bathroom.

Being a bakery I was recommended to come later on in the afternoon as they would be really busy in the morning.

Walked in and was immediately greeted by the staff, everyone was really friendly and helpful.  They have self serve breads, and oh my god do they have a lot of different selections and different samples to try! 

The bakers behind the clear case were super friendly as well and recommended (i don't remember the names hehe) 
the hash brown one (with a cold but tasty hash brown wrapped in a bread)
the chocolate baguette 
and a little one that looked like a hot dog (also cold by the time I got to it)
also went for the pineapple bread (with real pieces of pineapple inside.)

After my friend and I finished all the pastries we went back to try two more things, their royal pudding and the peach tea.  As far as the peach tea goes, nothing too special very peachy not too sweet not too much tea flavor, and I guess they only have one size (small???) weird. The pudding was in a super cute glass bottle with a plastic lid, I got the strawberry one!

The price for the three pastries, peach tea, and pudding all totaled up to about $25


 I will definitely be back for more!",EEroldbqNNjuSf2pZw5kYg,2,2,5,6RtT3nTpf1Yxqq6FZQSacA
