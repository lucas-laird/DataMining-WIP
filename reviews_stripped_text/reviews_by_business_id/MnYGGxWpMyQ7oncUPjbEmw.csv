I started eating Nathan's hot dogs on the boardwalk in Coney Island when I was a child. Let's just say that was a long time ago. New Yorkers - and I am one of those - are famous for their love of hot dogs. Most of the dogs in the south west are boiled and don't have that crisp outer skin which pops with juice at the first bite. 

Taking the escalator up to the 3rd floor food court offered a wonderful sight - Nathan's is in Las Vegas! Would it be as good? Oh yes it was!! Perfect dogs with the same unique and perfectly cooked fries. 

So I went online and saw that Las Vegas has several Nathan's, but that many of the reviews indicated sub-standard quality and service. I know my friends and I will go with great regularity.",3IJBR4zpeHtYxzRFuBMCxw,0,0,5,yXPUuFl_E2mXm-FsI_533w

This hot dog place is kind of like myself calling myself Vin Diesel, but it's calling itself Nathan's Famous. In all but name, this place is not THE Nathan's Famous.

Nathan's Famous in New York, or Coney Island to be specific, is super delicious at a price point that may make you crack a smile despite the harsh realities of life. This place is not like that: it is in a food court. In Luxor Hotel. In Las Vegas on the Strip. So, therefore, it's expensive. Q.E.D.

It is probably one of the cheaper options in the food court, to be fair. And the hot dog, while not the Nathan's quality I have come to love, is passable (although a Costco hot dog, at $1.50 plus a soda is still somehow better). I also got a chicken caesar salad, because, you know, digestion, and that was somewhat decent but then again at $13 was pricey.

We HAD to eat here because it's Hubby's favorite hot dog brand. 

We both had an Original beef hot dog, mine with relish and sauerkraut and his with relish and onions.  The only thing I would complain about is the hot dog wasn't grilled fresh to order (MINUS 1 star). They had some pre-made hot dogs sitting on the grill. Aside from the temperature of the hot dog, the flavor was good. I liked the sauerkraut because it wasn't the strong and sour taste I remember sauerkraut having when I was growing up. 

Hubby and I shared chili cheese fries and they were the perfect side to our hot dogs. The thick crinkle cut fries were crisp and the chili and melted cheese on top were delicious. Definitely a large enough serving for more than two people to share if it's not your main meal. 

H tried their new chicken wings.  She enjoyed them because they were fried and the sauce was similar to the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce we use at home.",W93Xpp1j2nWHC-adopGeUA,0,0,4,Ueu11XVIG5t3hAT4Blzm8w

One of my friends is from New Jersey, and she pointed out Nathan's. Everyone else being from Cali was like.. what is that? and she said, WHAT?! YOU DONT KNOW WHAT NATHANS IS?!

We proceeded to order a large chili cheese with bacon (so fatty, so good). All of us ordered a hot dog (their ""famous"" one), and added grilled onions to it. Pretty good, but definitely pricey which was expected since we were in Vegas.

I'm not sure if I would ever go back to Nathan's when I'm in Vegas. It's good, but not really worth the trip into underground Bally's.",KRcarrlaABmgM-EzofCh_g,1,0,4,E0Dy6JsIJQtjO7Tiff3law

The hot dog, I will say was pretty good. From the reputation I expected better. The wings worked for 3am food too. However I had the blandness sandwich I have ever had the displeasure of tasting in my life with Nathan's Philly cheesesteak.  It looked amazing. But literally had less taste than paper. I'm not deterred from trying them again. Just not this one if it can be helped.",TmX8KrTDWEzhv0GaO4NhNw,1,1,3,DLZd0q0bA7oOJNEqb3if5g
5356758,2017-07-09,0,MnYGGxWpMyQ7oncUPjbEmw,"I usually come to Nathan's a lot when I'm down here in Vegas. Their pricing is fair considering most food places in Vegas is pretty pricey. There are many different Nathan stores here in Vegas since it is a huge franchise. As you can tell by their name, they are mainly famous for their well known hot dogs here. Their menu is fairly simple. They have hot dogs, burgers, salads, and fries. For today, I'm going to be reviewing their fries and hot dogs. 
Starting off with the fries, I ended up ordering chili cheese fries and bacon cheese fries. These fries are fat crinkle-cut fries. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle-cut fries (waffle fries all the way) but the fries I had here was executed perfectly. Fresh, hot, and yummy. The bacon was a bit burnt with my order. The chili was decent, nothing to worth remembering it. The hot dog, again, was not really the greatest meal here. Hot dog was a bit too salty, fluffy buns, and the way it was executed was sub par. I much rather prefer a hot dog from either Costco or at Wienerschnitzel. That's as truthful as it gets. 
To wrap things up, I like their fries much more than the hot dogs here. Maybe if I come back one day and try this place out again, I'll definitely update this review.",KgEtUR6WLATKRy6cNL_d0Q,0,0,3,elr4oX3fdCNOpEU7wL28yw

The bun was just ordinary but with that hot dog and all the condiments it was mmm mmm good! The crispy crinkle cut like fries were also very good and nicely seasoned.  It was a bit pricey for the meal but overall it was worth, plus its vegas so idk how much it cost elsewhere but good job!",EOpLn0OaFDGE2gheh7PfDw,2,2,5,bEjSaJ2I7FhPFaJtQN5hYA

5720338,2010-11-10,0,MnYGGxWpMyQ7oncUPjbEmw,"The first time I had Nathan's was about two years ago because we got a free pizza or hot dog with the purchase of a drink. (weird right?!) Normally you get a free drink if you buy a hot dog! Anyways, once we got rung up we figured out why.. a soda was more than $3!? WTF! Oh well, the food was too good to complain.

Swung by for a delicious, artery-clogging lunch on my most recent Vegas trip. There is a Nathan's on the casino level but we went up to the sit-in restaurant on the 2nd floor (sort of close to the roller coaster). The food was just as good as I remembered.. their hot dogs are YUMMY. And some could argue pizza is just pizza, but for some reason their pizza is so good that it made my mouth water. I also ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich and upgraded the fries to bacon cheese fries for about $14 total. Kind of expensive, but dang that philly cheese steak was better than the one I ate in philly! Filled with meat, oozing with cheese and onions/peppers... pretty legit! I would skip the bacon cheese fries... I didn't like their fries because they are the crinkled kind.",-vPM7C063BZ1s5jzuCpcvQ,0,0,4,roOGCrTLsdju3I8R48DzEA

I know it's convenient to just go from the casino straight to food court; however, there's many other places that are better and worth your money if you venture out of MGM and go somewhere else. 

I got the 2 hot dog + fries with a lemonade, and it cost me $15. There wasn't anything special to the meal (not sure if I should be expecting that out of a food court). Hot dogs weren't that good. The actual sausage is a long needle than a nice plump one. I understand why the eating contests like these hot dogs since there just isn't alot of meat. When I picked up the hot dog, the bread wouldn't stay together either. Nothing special about the lemonade.

Just plain with some mustard or ketchup and you're good to go. Get 2 if you're hungry. I noticed they had pizza and other items on the menu but I would recommend the hot dog if you're a first timer. I wasn't able to try the fries or other sides but they seemed pretty fresh. As with other Vegas food establishments, it wasn't cheap.

I'd like to say my trip to this Nathans satisfied that urge but I'm still searching for that one OMG hotdog.  It wasn't bad but my taste buds wanted soo much more.  (I eventually found a great hotdog off of a food truck see my other reviews for that one) 

I ordered a plain hot dog; a chili cheese dog and a side of fires; the dogs were ok, decent flavor and the buns weren't overwhelming (important things in building a great dog). On the Chili one it was a mild Chili but the richness of the beef mixed well flavor of the dog. 

The fries were weak/soggy but I knocked some of my chili onto them; ate them with a fork and enjoyed them all the same.  I didn't pay that meal as my buddy picked up the tab but I thought it seemed a little excessive for three hotdogs two drinks and an order of fries.  I'm assuming it was high due to the location and overhead cost but as long as you aren't pinching pennies this is a good spot to stop in for a meal on the go.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,3,0,3,MXuiWE81tU2vBZl72czIMg
