1307205,2016-01-14,0,xuAY1qnAMrzkNyTd0K0Tcg,"I was really looking forward to this place after seeing 4/5 stars on Yelp.  We placed a delivery order and about an hour later (which, hey, that happens it's lunch hour and busy) our order for three arrived in a 1/2 filled shopping size bag.  At first I thought they had forgotten some items, but no, that was the whole order.  We did 1/2 portions for The Dougie Sandwich, The B Salad, and The Sunni Southwest Salad.  

The B Salad menu price was $8.00, though only a 1/2 portion you would expect a lot more to an $8.00 salad.  They described the salads as ""rubbery chicken"" with that thin watery-style ranch.  I had The Dougie Sandwich, menu price *only* $8.00 (1/2 portion).  This turned out to be just a few inches of basic roll with cold bland brisket, though the sweet potato chips were decent enough.  Overall the consensus was this was very disappointing and overpriced.  

Maybe they treat customers better in the cafe vs. delivery orders, or maybe it was a bad day?  I don't know, but this is my honest review of Dougie J's Cafe.  The delivery driver mentioned they had great American style decorations, guess I will never know since I wont be back.

I uploaded a few pictures, you can judge for yourself if these are worth $8.00 before tax, delivery fee, and tip (comes out to about $11.00 each then).  At least it should have tasted good for the price...",QSDfQXhyOPOCKMIiR-1oWw,4,0,1,6YHM5wDPYHDkI7rqnyLp9Q

When I read the description of the restaurant it certainly wasn't your regular diner. When we arrived at the location in Downtown Las Vegas the outside did not look anything like a restaurant. The building belonged to a law firm or something. Paid parking is available right next to the building or drive inside the small alley way right next to the building and there is a parking lot immediately to the left.

We entered the restaurant and noticeable are all the military memorabilia displayed on the walls and small American flags on each dining table. Dougie J's Café is a restaurant dedicated to the memory of Douglas J. Green who was killed in action serving his country in Afghanistan. We were the only guests inside the place. We were not given any menus... there were none at the time? Instead the server told us of our choices. The menu was very limited but it's okay they had something we liked. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger [$10.50] and hubby had an omelette. Our food was home-cooked and nicely presented... but most importantly, delicious! The restaurant served great traditional American food.

The owner and his server were nice and friendly. Owner chatted with us and mentioned that he lived in Sacramento over ten years ago. He served our country from 1988 to 1993 in the US Army as a 91B Combat Medic. He, a U.S. Army veteran, is doing an awesome thing with redemption program. He was telling us that the restaurant also serves as a culinary training course that introduces the knowledge and skills (with emphasis on planning, preparation and presentation of food) to meet the needs of the restaurant industry. I'd love to mention more about his program but if you happen to visit this place he'll be glad to chat with you more about it.

4142358,2015-10-14,2,xuAY1qnAMrzkNyTd0K0Tcg,"Dougie's has been one of my go-to breakfast places downtown. Although I haven't ventured around their menu too much, they have dishes that keep me coming back.

The holy grail dishes I constantly crave are their huveos rancheros and build your own breakfast option. 

1) Huevos rancheros: 
The dish comes smothered in green chili sauce, three eggs, pepper jack cheese and their salsa fresco is to die for. While presentation isn't the prettiest, the rancheros will certainly give your tastebuds a happy awakening. 

2) Build your own breakfast:
You basically have limitless options here: from getting your eggs anyway you desire, to making your meal into a sandwich, wrap, scramble or omelette. I'm set on constructing mine into a breakfast burrito. I suggest the same and please don't forget to ask for the salsa fresco. You won't regret it.

The vibe is always warm and welcoming. I almost always have Emma as a server. She is a delight!

So next time you're feeling breakfast and don't feel like waiting at your other downtown breakfast spots, check out Dougie's. It makes me sad that it this place doesn't get as much traffic as it deserves but I think it's just because people have discovered it yet.",zpnDr3EBaVU8QPNHE3eDbg,6,8,5,RzmH4ts3JuQ-iGdG6NhCiA

My friend and I popped over here for lunch as it is super close to our work. At 11:30ish in the AM on a weekday I was pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't packed to the brim like a lot of other eateries downtown. The space, however, is on the small side, so if it were busy, you'd be in for a wait for a table!

Our server, who was very nice, and kept tabs on our table let us pick our seats. The place is decorated with military memorabilia and has the feeling of a small-town eatery -- just a place where the food is made with love for the locals.

I ordered ""The Oz"", which is on their sandwich menu. It's a hoagie roll stuffed with wonderful meatballs, topped with melty cheese. There was just enough marinara sauce for this sandwich to easily be eaten by hand, while only a bit of the sauce leaked out while I was enjoying it. What my friend and I really appreciated was that you could order the sandwich in a smaller size (there are two options for all the sandwiches in the menu). I opted for the side salad with a side of ranch. It's nothing spectacular, but I always appreciate a side choice other than french fries. 

I will definitely be back here to try a few more items off the menu!",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,5,5,cHT6defG7yb1gvdOuOTI9w

Owned and operated by Suni Chabrow with a menu crafted by her longtime friend and business partner, a former bodybuilder and attorney downtown, Dougie J's Café is Sin City's only Patriotic dining locale and with a portion of the proceeds benefitting the Memorial Foundation of Suni's fallen hero son it is undoubtedly the sort of space that everyone would love to see succeed, the potential no doubt there but a few tweaks necessary before the food will truly 'wow.'

Patriotically decorated without pandering to the ""USA, USA"" crowd it was after contacting Suni directly about the restaurant's concept and the possibility of ordering a few 'half-portions' to better assess the menu that I arrived at for Saturday lunch and with both Ms. Chabrow and the menu's creator present throughout my hour-long stay it can only be said that the whimsical cuisine and story of the space was interesting and inspiring, respectively, while both were thoroughly explained.

Largely opting to indulge in breakfast, while allowing the Chef liberty with portion sizes and price, it was with a full order of The Riz that the meal began and featuring well-saturated brioche from Bon Bread at its base the French Toast sandwiching Nutella and Whip was decidedly sweet, a pitcher of artificial maple syrup thankfully unnecessary both here and in the follow-up blueberry pancake that was fluffy and well aerated, more than suitable for sopping up butter as well as blueberry reduction though the berries within the batter were somewhat disappointing and bland.

Chatting with the proprietors as I ate, stories including Soni's decision to pursue a lifelong passion for making English Toffee striking a chord about the value of following one's dreams, it was next that a whole order of the Pink Diablo arrived and drawing on concepts other restaurants would just as happily attributed to Elvis both the portion and flavor was plethoric, though much of the nuance was lost due to far too much peanut butter, a half portion more than enough to satisfy my curiosity though I did indeed pay for a whole.

Next sent out a half ""Bubba,"" a dish I neither desired nor requested but was happy to try given the staff's glowing reviews, suffice it to say that between the watery pastrami and substantial amount of slaw little of the $6.50 I was charged for the gift was worth it, the 'Dougie Sauce' a lone exception with a whole lot of heat packed into the Russian-Style cream.

Back to items I'd inquired about, it was to a haphazard 'torn' half biscuit alongside fried chicken with thick country gravy that I was treated next and with the bird pounded flat and nearly flavorless while the biscuit large but no better than Bisquick suffice it to say this was a major miss, a fact made all the more humorous when the man behind the menu idly poked fun at the food at Hash-House-a-Go-Go before also admitting the lazy-man ingredient was used in Dougie J's signature blueberry coffee cake - a dish still well worth ordering given the substantial use of cinnamon and delicate, buttery crumb.

Unable to make me an Apple Fritter, one of the items I'd specifically requested and one that Suni couldn't stop raving about even after telling me the restaurant had failed to procure apples on that day, it was with a single ""Bad Influence"" cookie that my meal ended and served hot and gooey from the oven with bits of Suni's Whoa! Foods Toffee filling the batter alongside bittersweet cranberries anyone in the area, which means anyone in DTLV or East Fremont, should consider stopping in to grab one...or perhaps a dozen as it may just be the best cookie on Las Vegas Boulevard right now.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Originally served a bill with a pre-tip of just under $75 - whole stacks of pancakes, full sandwiches, and a full  order of chicken and biscuits rang up along with what I'd actually ordered...and the Bubba which I had not...but later adjusted to a tally of $62 inclusive of tax and tip, the prices at Dougie J's are unfortunately far out of line to the quality of product used or served and while I'm happy to donate to a great cause like The Douglas J. Green Foundation I'd have sooner done so on a voluntary basis rather than be upcharged for many of the things I tasted, though there are undoubtedly some gems on the menu to be found.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,2,3,DOwPIcxzuSwENqu0xniMhw

I went with a cheeseburger on a pretzel bun with Dougie sauce. It took a while to come out. It smelled foul, I'm guessing something in the sauce. I take a bite and see the pretzel bun is dry and stale. After the long wait to order and receive our food I'd given up. The only good thing was the fries. I got garlic or parm and they were hot and delicious! I took the burger to go but ended up chunking it.

The food is unique, well thought out, and good sized portions. I tried the chorizo sweet potato hash and pancakes last time, and had planned on ordering the hash today...until I noticed something totally different.  I can't remember the name for some reason, but it's listed in the sandwich section. 

Peanut butter, bananas, and bacon (!) sandwiched between fried bread encrusted with frosted flakes. Sounds funky, but the blend of warm peanut butter and bacon--the salty--works great with the sweet corn flakes and bananas. It's not a burger, or a sandwich, so you may have to be looking for this kind of combo, but I cleaned the plate! 

I chose fruit salad (bananas, pineapple, apples) instead of fries. The only criticism I'd make is that due to the sandwich contents, I had banana overload, but the fruit was fresh, cut, and a good sized portion.",jfG6Tgnw3xFfIOaSZakSUQ,3,3,5,mIu03MhmFQYCPH3azWHADA
