But I had a Korean themed event to attend, so my plan was to bring several bowls of Kimchee soup (the one thing I find tasty). I had a difficult time finding a place that would allow me to do takeout of this specific soup. Jun's came to the rescue at 8:30pm.

I was relieved when there were no strong smells and the 30-seat ""casual dining"" arrangement was spotless. The gentleman (cashier with the gray ponytail) was welcoming and non-judgemetal when I ignorantly asked questions about the side dishes. In fact, all the staff were extremely polite!

I thought $10 for a large bowl of soup was a bit pricey, considering the relaxed atmosphere and the football game playing on the TV, but perhaps this ended up a fair price, as it did come with rice and two sides.

For my own nourishment, I added on an ""oriental chicken salad"", which was hardly oriental, but the chicken and dressing were so fresh and delicious. I will be coming back! The soup was a hit too! Spicy and such a comfort food. I absolutely can see myself grabbing this soup and salad combo on a week night to split with the hubs and am looking forward to exploring more of this Americanized-touch of Hawaiian-Korean menu!",SPo3N__DoDyzryGXWWS1IQ,1,0,5,yZJknkFdEF5Aj2nGmpB5cQ

The food here is always excellent in my book. In fact, I prefer Jun's to some of the more popular competitors in town when in comes to the more traditional or basic Korean dishes such as kalbi, bibimbap, and their amazing soup selections. I seriously can't get enough of their spicy broth! And you can now also purchase their signature sauces in jars which I forgot to purchase.

3432226,2016-03-20,1,ux6ZekIlKJbJUKWRe7RjUQ,"So happy that Jun's opened up in the Spring Valley/Summerlin area.

Jun's is a Korean restaurant, with a hint of inspiration from Hawaii. Let me explain. Jun's, unlike the typical Korean BBQ restaurant, does not have the tables with the burners in the middle for you and your family to cook your meal.  With Jun's, you can either eat-in or take-out and order the usual favorites like Kalbi or Bulgogi, Therefore, an individual meal is between $8 to $14. So the hint of Hawaii inspiration, is not only the Hawaiian Sun drinks you can choose from, but a particular dish that was ""invented"" in Hawaii, called Meat Jun. And the reason why I say meat jun was invented in HI is because I've lived in NoCal and SoCal for over 13-years and every time I go to a Korean restaurant, I would ask if they had this dish off menu and they immediately knew that I was from HI. According to these other Korean restaurant owners, only people from HI ask for that dish. Because I can get meat jun only in HI and Las Vegas, I ordered meat jun.

Simply put, meat jun is a thin cut of beef, marinated, dipped in egg and fried. It is served with a sweet dipping sauce made with shoyu (or soy sauce) and vinegar.

Along with your meal comes ban chan (pronounced bon chon, not sure of the spelling) which are the Korean side dishes. Because I'm not a fan of kim chee, the server did say I could choose up to 3 side dishes. There are 10 side dishes to choose from, of which six are my favorites. I opted for the bean sprouts, vegetable pancake and seaweed. After wolfing down the sides and finishing up half of my meal, the server did offer to either refill my side dishes or I could choose other sides. Because I was getting full and didn't want to waste any food, I turned down the ban chan refill.

Although the meat jun was good, the taste isn't quite what I'm used to, not as sweet. And the dipping sauce is a little more on the vinegary side. In any case, still very good and just super glad there is a location near my neighborhood and open on Sundays.

If this is your first time, I recommend Jun's Special which consist of Kalbi, BBQ beef, chicken, Meat Jun, mandoo (fried won tons) and rice and includes the side dishes for $13.95.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,2,2,4,yv8LeefIY6Mwlb27PjOe1w

Since that was main thing I came here for, that is a big disappointment.  Spicy pork, mandoo, and grilled chicken was just okay.  Meat quality not great on anything, gristle-y and cheap.  The banchan was all very fresh but it also was not really actually fermented, so the flavor was just meh.  

I also agree they need to hire one more person.  1 waiter/cashier and 1 cook on a busy Saturday night... *shakes head*",0DGh3LaLFDDES3OtOqGq1w,0,0,2,lrb824avX_jEWCnU4VbVyQ

4936389,2016-03-05,0,ux6ZekIlKJbJUKWRe7RjUQ,Amazing Korean flavor! The owner explained that all the food is prepared and marinated overnight giving it it's deep rich flavor.. .the 3 meat combo is a pretty good value . We also had one of the soups with the transparent noodles (which the owner says is made from sweet potato so it's got lots of fiber).  Soup had a nice soothing clear broth with these big chunks of short ribs that fall off so easily from being simmered for hours. After all these things they offer the prices are very very reasonable. Not like other Korean restaurants that are so expensive. I learned this was their 3rd restaurant. They have one on the north and the east side. Thank God they have one now on the southwest!!!!

I'm so picky with my Korean food and I have to say this was definitely the best I've had. Reasonably priced too! The lady that answered the phone even asked if I had a preference of sides for the ban chan which I appreciated since I love kimchi and sweet radish. The spiciness level of the soup was on point. Usually, even when I ask for a level 10 they always make it more mild, thinking I can't handle it. This soup was perfect. The spicier, the better.",oa8K9ZcUH_Ze8Ku39q0SRw,0,0,5,QmSAuE8zVGi4ciFl_eoHTg

The stone pot jerks the food hot for a long time.  The rice at the bottom of the bowl gets a little crispy so you get then wonderful texture pops as you enjoy your meal.  

The place is clean and the server staff don't rush you in any way.  Very relaxed place to enjoy your lunch.  Rare to find a small chain like this with such a laid back attitude and vibe.

My brother & i ordered Mixed plate with kalbi & bulgogi, tuna poke salad, & soft tofu soup with beef & vegetables. Not only was the food delicious.. i love how we were able to choose what sides we want. They had a large variety of side fishes to choose from. The kimchi, cucumber, and pancake was delicious.

We had the Bulgogi plate, the Japchae, and the Jajangmyeon. The Bulgogi plate came with bulgogi, rice, and salad. Bulgogi was very flavorful and the salad has a nice dressing that just cuts right through the fat and oil. As for the Japchae, noodle has just the right chewy texture, the vegetables added a nice crunch, and the bulgogi provided flavor. The Jajangmyeon was probably one of my favorite Jajangmyeon. The black bean sauce wasn't too bland, and the noodle didn't stick together in a big lump. The only complain I have about this dish was that even though it tasted delicious, the meat was slightly tough. Each dish has a large portion, we ended up having a lot of leftovers, which we took to-go.

A minus point for this restaurant would be that it doesn't have a very pleasant odor when you first walk in, this is most likely because of their side dishes bar since most of them are preserved.

Overall, we really enjoyed the food on the service here and have been back once more since our first time.",21qMeM1WMRi0Tn3Lqo-C1g,0,0,4,3gH-kSAP3OSPusETfZOHvA

For those of you who don't know; Juns is Korean food with an 808 twist to it. For those homesick Hawaiians like me, this place is cures the Soon's BBQ withdrawals and meat jun blues. 

This place has all the Korean-Hawaiian dishes that you would want: Mac salad, shoyu potatoes, fried mandoo, kalbi, bi-bim-bap and most importantly meat jun!

What is meat jun you ask? Meat jun (jhun) is literal the name meat (thin sliced teriyaki meat) coated in Jun (egg) and then dried up.. For noobs who still can't fathoms this, think of it like a teriyaki meat omelette. Better yet don't think of it and save more of it for me. This is the main reason why we come here. 

My default order is an order of fried mandoo and the 3 meat combo: kalbi, katsu and of course the meat jun. The portion sizes are pretty big enough for two normal people or one hungry Hawaiian like me Chee! 

Other recommendations on the menu are the spicy chicken wings (especially since we don't have a Bon Chon or K-wing place in Vegas). 
The Bi Bim Bap is also a constant go to dish.  

On another side nostalgia note the Katsu sauce here reminds me of the sauce that was served at Jumbos and Grace Inn back on Oahu. Instant win for people who grew up eating at those places.

I dined here with a friend for lunch and we were in and out in less than an hour. Everything we tried was good and the banchan was fresh and never-ending. 

It's nice to have this quick option on this side of town.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,10,3,D0eKjxIIKDXoQa9xbeXTgQ
