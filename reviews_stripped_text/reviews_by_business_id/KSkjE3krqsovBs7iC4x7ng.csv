I know it's not a five star restaurant but it took forever for the food to come out and then my hamburger was burnt as well as the cheese on it, the bun was super doughy and the seasonal fries were over cooked as well. Took over 30 minutes to get a refill on my drink. The service just flat out sucked, especially it being 5 pm in the afternoon, dinner time they had 3 servers I believe but I saw them most of the time in the back just chatting... I have been to this same Dennys at  2 am and it has been busier and the waitress was much nicer and I didn't have to wait long for anything.",5i9ial6ig4uMTp_74iOMaw,1,0,1,sArHJ5L10C9HFeDKB8jjbw
71410,2016-12-05,0,KSkjE3krqsovBs7iC4x7ng,"We went out for dessert after some Christmas activities on December 4th 2016 at 7:45pm because our favorite place was closed for renovations. There were 7 of us and we all ordered a dessert. The waiter told us it would be a while to get our desserts because he had to do it all himself. There were maybe 3 other tables occupied while we were there. We asked him to bring the kids desserts first since it would be a while. However, he ended up bringing them melted ice cream very last after all 4 adults were served their desserts and had already eaten. Keeping them settled down was hard since all they wanted was dessert and had to wait 40 minutes and watch everyone else eat theirs. We ordered two chocolate lava cakes and when we got them they were so incredibly hot that the ice cream on top was completely melted and the cake was a chewy mess. Like the cake was microwaved for a very long time. So gross. We complained and sent them back but received no refund or apologies. Also we ordered 2 apple crisps and after 20 minutes were told that they were out and we would have to choose another dessert. The whole reason we went there was because one of the people we were with had requested apple crisp or pie. The waiter did bring us an extra chocolate shake but no one wanted it as everyone already had ice cream. I'm assuming that was the compensation for the inedible lava cakes. We will never go there again because this was the 2nd time we have went and the second time with horrible service and dirty restaurant and bathrooms. Drive a few miles and go to a different place, I do not recommend this place at all.",91t6PO4uRsfcFazc8cM-5w,0,0,1,nZ9erU_75SJgAT5LSjrqAw

The first thing I notice is the guy wearing a plastic nose, but he's not dining alone.  His large stuffed dog has accompanied him on this meal and seems to be quite happy sitting on top of the table.  The gentlemen appeared to be having the time of his life and even got up to play the air piano at one point.  These are moments that only occur in Vegas.

I forget our server's name but this guy was totally on top of his game.  Our order took a while to come out but the soda refills were flowing like Niagara.  The food?  Well it's Denny's, it tastes like food.

I come here about once a year and that will probably continue until I move.  Thanks for the memories Denny's.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,0,1,3,FrT5OZtjfBJA5WfRRIEHXA

Anyway I've been to this Dennys twice in the past 30 days and I am digging the 2,4,6,8 menu. For basically whatever you can spend you can get some decent eats.  I have gone for a cordon blue sandwich once and a chipotle chicken entree another time, which because its $8 comes with a drink. (Soft drinks avg 2.50 cents when dining out, so thats a good savings).  You also get 2 sides with it, and I loved the spinach with bacon and pico they had and the cheeeesy mash potatoes.  

The service was real nice both times I went, and the restuarant seemed fairly clean. I've been into some messy Denny's before but this one was above par for sure.

Last time I went there I ordered the chicken cheese steak and it was amazing... We had a male server who was there the previous times. He must have went home and we had Karla... Karla was a good server besides the fact I had to ask for certain things more than once the service was OK. She stated she had other customers to handle and we were in this restaurant about 7pm. A total of maybe 8 tables for 2 servers. But that is not why I'm giving 5 stars. The 5 stars is for the manager Marie who was very attentive and diligent on helping me with the issue of being charged almost 34 dollars for a 17 dollar meal. I called the following day when I realized that it had been a mistake. Seemed Karla charged me for a meal again trying to take her tip. I appreciate a great manager even though staff somrtimes make mistakes Marie was able to assure me that it would be taken care of. Which it had. So my overall experience was a 5 regardless of the server that night Marie made my yelp reviews a 5 because of how quickly and easily she handled the situation understanding that an error had been made and needed to be fixed.

I've been driving by this Denny's for I-don't-know-how-long and kept thinking, ""Hmmm...  I've gotta try their patty melt.""

So I did.  Ruben answered the phone - very nice phone voice and very pleasant in person too!  Happily changed my cheese from swiss to American (I just needed some ooey, gooey, melty cheese that day).  Ruben was waiting for me when I arrived with a smile on his face and my patty melt ready to go.

It was sooo good!  The rye was warm and toasty (which is difficult to maintain when you get it ""to go""), the burger cooked perfectly with grilled onions.  When I saw the fries, I thought, ""What the heck are these?"".  They were kinda big and shaped like a tin roof (not rusted - sorry, Love Shack reference).  I was afraid they were gonna be soft, but they were actually well cooked.  So I ate them too.

Better prices than the other breakfast joint close by that also serves burgers, and better burger.  Way to go Dennys!

  My brother and I went to the Eastern at Tropicana Denny's for a late night supper. The server was friendly and attentive to beverage refills. The food and prices were decent. I enjoyed eating to the oldies.
 One minor complaint I had was the sign advertising a $3.99 cheese burger meal deal. However the fine print says it is only for weekdays. Hard to catch the fine print cruising on Tropicana.

She has absolutely no patience for customers, and stands around doing absolutely nothing to help her staff attend tables. She stands around talking about her customers and should not be working at a restaurant. In the little time we were there we had to ask for refills every single time when we asked her why our food was taking so long and once it finally came out... why was it cold she stated that the reason being was that they had a bigger party that they were attending... still does not justify why all your other customers will get bad service if you are not fit to attend such a big party you need to reconsider your staff and arrange it properly so that it can be easily managed.

5355583,2015-09-15,7,KSkjE3krqsovBs7iC4x7ng,"This is probably my second time at a Denny's ever. A friend and I came here for food after having a late night adventure around town. People always tell me that Denny's is just cheap diner food, but nothing was really open in the area that sparked our interest so we decided that Denny's will do. I know I shouldn't expect much because it's not fine dining, but here it goes...

When we first arrived, we weren't even greeted and two employees glanced right at us and continued their conversation. I don't like interrupting people (and I know they acknowledged our presence because they glanced at us) so we just waited until they stopped. We were seated shortly after their conversation ended and were greeted by what seemed to be the only person working the front end. This guy was friendly, but service was slow for a night that wasn't busy (there were a total of two tables dining in, including our table). I ordered the fish & chips.

The fish & chips are white fish fillets fried to a crispy golden brown served with fries and a side order of your choice (I went with their steamed broccoli). It was good for something from a chain diner, but it wasn't anything that I would rave about.

Service was basically non-existent because our waiter didn't show up through our whole meal except when we were almost done. He made a snarky comment  after he noticed we grabbed a ketchup bottle from the empty table next to us, since the one on our table ran out and we were almost done with our meal. Like I said, the service wasn't there and it wasn't until we were getting ready to leave and pay for our food that the waiter starts having these long conversations about his past, and at the end of the night we just wanted to go home (we wouldn't have minded if he talked to us during our meal, but we literally were done and paid for and it was kinda awkward for us to end the conversation). 

Here's the bottom line: come here at 1 in the morning if you want to hear oldies music while Law & Order SVU is playing on their TVs on mute, and at the same time you can hear the employees having inappropriate conversations in the kitchen. I'm not gonna lie, it definitely was a unique experience to say the least but I don't think I'll go back. Maybe it would've been a better experience during the day, but then again it's just a Denny's...",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,8,8,1,FA3GIuxQntAbjnxiHfdZbA

Coffee was 2+ hours old, understaffed, ordered the ""honey jalapeño bacon cheeseburger"" and the only things not burnt was the lettuce, the tomato, and the pickles. Reasonably sure the pickles weren't supposed to be there. Cheese was  crispy-burnt, the bacon was literally black, and to top it off, when i cut the burger in half, i found a hair in the middle. 

Naturally, i wanted to talk to one of the servers about it, but after 5 minutes, i got fed up and left (my fault, i just got off a 14 hour shift, my fuse was short) and of course, they noticed THAT. The server followed me into the parking lot, and demanded i pay before i leave, or she was going to take a picture of my license plate, and call Metro on me.

So yes I built my own burger, a simple affair with mushrooms, bacon and cheddar cheese, along with thick cut fries and a diet coke...Yeah I know, but I prefer the taste of diet to regular.

Anyways, burger cooked perfectly, juicy with good flavor, fries cooked to a nice crisp golden brown.

In a struggling economy you would think businesses would strive to give good service to stay afloat. Not this Denny's. 

My husband asked if he could switch his pancakes for a piece of toast. The waiter returned with a positive no from the manager: ""She said if you could come and see her so that you may explain your situation to her and then she may consider it."" (Please include a 200 word request as well.)
They gave us the toast and the pancakes and added .99 to our bill.
The place was filthy. The pancakes had obviously been sitting around and were cold.
I asked one of the waiters to bring me something  and after saying ""yeah"" left to never be seen again.
We got up half way our meal. We spoke with the manager, who could not provide us with the owner's name. After complaining to her about all of the above she shrugged and said she was sorry and turned around.

This is a hellhole and would prefer to go to McDonald's  and eat there than in this excuse of a restaurant.",wfV05cpejcwjiqf1IrgeXQ,0,0,1,qC7mi1maUCbJn4eVXrnNew

I've noticed that this place has stopped giving a damn about the appearance of the place.  The whole place is pretty dirty in general.  You can see where they had luau decorations taped around the restaurant and whoever started taking them down (months ago) didn't even bother to take all of the decorations down or the pieces of tape.  

$34.48 got us two breakfasts, two coffees, and some pancake pups for the kiddo. The quality of the food is good usually but it takes a while which I don't mind.  

I got the ""all-american slam"" which comes with sausage, bacon, cheesy eggs, hashbrowns, and your choice of bread.  I asked our waiter if I could have french fries instead of hashbrowns and he said that was okay but then he never brought them.  He never came to check on us either so I just let it go.  It wasn't meant to be!  Also my coffee cup had lipstick on it which kinda grossed me out but also not a big deal. 

Story time...okay...so about two years ago I went to McDonald's on Pecos & Desert Inn and there was this insane old man there.  He was wearing a bright pink outfit and had on clown shoes and a pair of those glasses with a plastic nose attached.  He ordered an ice cream cone and started to lick it seductively and was singing and dancing.  You may be thinking ....hey Rach...what does this have to do with the review?

Well HE WAS THERE at this Denny's that day.  That same nutcase! He still had on the fake nose and he had a stuffed toy dog with him that was sitting on the table and he had placed a glass of water in front of the dog and put a straw in its mouth.  What a weirdo!!  It cracked me up to see him again.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,11,12,3,5WQRGzQgxMBRvppUa_uy4A

However, once our waitress came she seemed as though she was in a rush. She didn't introduce herself or ask how were doing. She didn't bother to ask whether or not I wanted hash browns or bread. She just assumed that I wanted hash browns, which luckily I did. I find customer service to be very important but they were friendly which is why I gave three stars instead of two. The wait for the food felt like a long time. We waited for about 30 or so minutes but there were no check in or updates on how we were doing. The other server seemed occupied with one of the tables behind us and just stood there talking. The food was good. If the food came out cold or bad I would have been upset since the wait was so long. I would want the food to be worth the wait. I know it's just Denny's, but it still matters.",OJEe-_8YdU71GkbuGt0CDg,1,1,3,n1L0Bq7RirdrTWwdFyS6gg
