Whoa.  Seen all the negative reviews on here, but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised last night.  Came back to the hotel after a long day out and just wanted a quick snack to take up to my room.  Spotted the spinach and mushroom pizza and asked for a slice.  The friendly worker promptly heated it up which made the crust delightfully crispy and did it all with a smile on her face.
Maybe I was lucky? (Not at the slots, though). :(",tS6uLu_8x4Tn_BzXYSKQgg,0,0,5,V5L8AaZTt3y-m4x6MakeVw

I normally come to this sbarro just because of how close it is to my house, but on this visit it definitely did not live up to the other excellent sbarro visits that I've come to know. I had just come from watching a movie, and was looking for a something to eat. Out of all the 4 others places I could've chosen to eat I chose the sbarro. I was with my 3 friends one of which was a little intoxicated at time. As a good friend I tried to get some food in him to try and get him feeling a little better. As I went to the counter to order I was greeted by an associate who showed me great customer service and understood the situation I was in with my friend. As I was ordering a pepperoni pizza and water for my friend she began to tell me that there was a combo I could get instead of the one slice and drink I intended to get that would save me money and get me an extra slice for a few cents more. As I picked my slice and awaited to pay for it and the other slice plus the drink. I was told by Deja the supervisor on duty at midnight on 11/10/15 that my friend who was intoxicated had paid. I'm in shock how could a supervisor of all people in the establishment sell to an intoxicated person whose friend had just told the previous associate that he was going to cover the charges? It makes no sense especially since this is in a casino of all places, so you'd think as a supervisor she would have a little more experience with this. So as I picked up the second slice of pizza I was told that he had not paid for my slice. I was now confused at the situation because I told them to get the combo instead they charged him for the single slice plus drink which came up to $9.06 instead of w/the extra which would've been $1.19 more. I was dumbfounded at the sheer lack of communication at this sbarro, in an area of no more then 5 feet and some how a message is lost? The place wasn't even packed or busy. We were the only customers. I'm not sure if the supervisor was taking advantage of me or my friend by trying to charge us an additional 4 bucks for an order we could've gotten as a combo, but I do know how she handled the situation was not professional. She would not let me pay the difference, but instead threw the slice that I had ordered in the trash! I do not know how she became a supervisor with such a lack of customer service skills, but I can say this I will never come back to this sbarro AGAIN! It has left a bad taste in my mouth for future sbarro visits elsewhere. I'm here left thinking will I be treated the same at other locations?",WC5Xa1RegFhbxNDjgmwspg,0,0,1,fBAQzbgUDSMAmt7x8tz8Kw

(+) the employees were all very friendly and helpful. Certainly no complaints there.
(+) the prices were fair when considering that you are still in a casino
(+) portions were fair and filling. I especially enjoyed the Baked Ziti very much. The extreme pepperoni stromboli was tasty as well, with a real buttery flavor to it.

(-) while the portions were tasty and filling, the food here is VERY greasy. Very. As in they need wet wipes instead of napkins. Like, a trip to the bathroom is an immediate necessity as soon as you are done eating.

This place was A-Ok. Certainly nothing to go out of your way for, but if you want a quick, (relatively) cheap bite to eat while at the Orleans, it should do the trick. I wavered between 2 and 3 stars, but the employees were nice, so here's to the benefit of the doubt!

Ultra convenient based on location alone because it's right on the gambling floor and close to the parking garage so you'll pass it coming and going.

That's the sound of a failed franchise that's trying it's very best to tap out and leave this world, yet continues to be kept on life support against it's own will. Sbarro is an old war horse that's been through many brutal wars (read: bankruptcies) and has weathered many storms (read: ownership issues) It's worn, decrepit body doesn't even have the strength to beg for rest, let alone mercy. 

Yet here I am, pitching in a few dollars towards the hospital bill to keep ol' Sbarro alive. Feels bad, man -- and that's not just the emptiness I feel after I eat. I feel something else too: GUILT. I've been contributing toward keeping flavorless, dry crust on the market, a crust that favors the flavor profile of cardboard than it does anything remotely related to pizza.  I've helped a slice stay alive that manages to be a simultaneous two-punch body blow of soggy AND needing more sauce. Even with a heavy hand on the seasonings, the fact still remains: this is garbage.
