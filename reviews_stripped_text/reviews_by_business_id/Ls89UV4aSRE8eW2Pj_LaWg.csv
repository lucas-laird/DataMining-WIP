The restaurant has a really good vibe. We were seated at a table underneath a very large artificial tree. That sounds bad but it actually had a very good feel to it. Our server, Lisa, came over almost immediately and took our drink order. I was really disappointed to find the restaurant had no beers on tap, only bottles. We decided to start by sharing a bowl of gumbo. Warning! A $6 bowl of gumbo is quite small and not large enough to share. It did have a good amount of sausage in it considering the size of the bowl. But overall, I found it somewhat bland. It was okay, but disappointing for a New Orleans style restaurant. Being in the mood for Cajun food, I ordered the jambalaya. The portion was quite large. There was ample sausage and New Orleans vegetables in it. Overall, I would rate it as a good jambalaya but not excellent. Again, disappointing for a New Orleans style restaurant.

Here's what I remember most
Steak salad- incredibly dry and hard medium-well
Lobster mac & cheese- really rubbery lobster, and not quite creamy enough
Voodoo Chicken- everyone's favorite
Cajun chicken pasta- super yummy (not really spicey at all)
Corn bread- really delicious with a bite of spiciness

Lots of drunk tourists, bachelorette parties, etc., etc. The food is underwhelming and overpriced. The drinks are nothing out of the ordinary. The red sangria is actually pretty good and potent. If you check out the weeklies, there's often a 2-for-1 drink coupon to be had. The service is often slow and spoty during karaoke, so bring your patience and your expertise at flagging a server down.

We only came here because we love blues and we were disappointed at the whole hearing cover songs instead. The boy couldsing but we just felt bamboozled. My linguine pasta was so bland. It's really hard to eat dry pasta dishes so I added salt to help bring in some flavor and that helped and I am not a salt sprinkler bc it's not really good for me.

2425970,2014-02-16,0,Ls89UV4aSRE8eW2Pj_LaWg,"It's an over-priced noisy chain restaurant - not at all uncommon in Las Vegas.

THE GOOD:

- Lots of seating
- Live music for those who like that sort of thing with dinner
- A decent menu (not too much, but enough variety to please all palettes)

THE BAD:

- The food is so-so...the steak in my steak salad was poor quality, my wife's burger and fries were average, yet the pickles that came with her sandwich were very tasty, as were the appetizers

- The prices were too high for what you got. This is a problem in all of Las Vegas really, but if you're going to over-pay, you should get something memorable in exchange. There was absolutely nothing memorable about this place.

- Our server (Mike was his name I think?) was sort of a d-bag. He lost all credibility when he told us that 3 dishes were ""money,"" before rattling off half a dozen more that were also ""money"" or amazing. If you're going to tell me half the menu is amazing, you might as well keep your mouth shut.

He also acted very put out when we asked him to split up the check.

Summing up, this isn't a must-see place. It's not bad at all (it's just fine, actually), but you can do better.",jUEG_8ZqdquKwSr1nwiQXQ,1,0,2,K3GQOfXOJO9ywhHsar9fMw

I thought this would be a convenient place to eat for our later House of Blues concert, but not so much.  Practically speaking, it was no closer than any of the dozen other restaurants in Mandalay Bay, so proximity to House of Blues is irrelevant.

While the menu looked interesting, the dishes served were truly awful low-grade bar food.  Two of the four things we ordered were delivered cold and flavorless, the other two were hastily assembled salads with cheap ingredients.

As bad as the food was, the service was even worse.  Mind you, we arrived at 7:00pm on a Saturday night, but they were so understaffed that it took 15 minutes for someone to say hello, another 15 to take our order, 45 for the food to show up and all the while never received a single refill of our drinks or water.  I should also note, the place was not that crowded as you might suspect...I think the word has gotten out.

In short, I'd never go back here because there are so many good alternatives in Mandalay Bay.  If I wanted to grossly overpay for cheap bar food and bad service, there is no shortage of places where I could accomplish that :-)",dwmciE9bB4Naug5SvM8KZA,2,0,2,-jYQcERnru0TTqiBbb8yUw

2640093,2016-03-13,6,Ls89UV4aSRE8eW2Pj_LaWg,"Jamie W. and I were hungry after watching the elaborate Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson ONE show at Mandalay Bay which was where we happened to be staying. We didn't feel like venturing that far away on the Strip just for a late bite. Y'see, we're not those guys with the giant bongs filled with frozen margarita, although I was intrigued by the sight of a giant plastic, margarita-filled guitar that a young girl was holding like Susanna Hoffs having a Manic Monday. Anyhow, that's who we figured were the type of diners that come to the House of Blues between guitar fill-ups. We were mistaken as this is a relatively family-friendly eatery that appears to cater to well-behaved bachelorette parties.

Walking into a large space dominated by a big tree (photo: http://bit.ly/1TYHlmk), we saw a two-man band playing on a small stage. Not blues but '80's pop-rock like A Flock of Seagulls and Van Halen. A middle-aged woman would sometimes join them to play keyboards, quite essential when they performed ""Jump"". The Crossroads menu is TGIFish, but we didn't mind since we just wanted comfort food (photo: http://bit.ly/1XnVzL7). We both started out with the $8.99 Classic Wedge Salad, which was exactly that. A quarter-cut of iceberg lettuce with diced tomatoes, smoked Applewood bacon, and globs of blue cheese dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1Ua68TQ). Yep, that's it.

Jamie decided to try the $18.99 Jambalaya for his entree. Marinated chicken and andouille sausage were mixed with sweet peppers and green onions in a rice saturated in their house special jambalaya sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/22bGT8C). It was a good portion and certainly hearty enough even if the sauce didn't have much spicy kick on its own. I ordered the $15.99 Juicy Lucy, an inverted beef and bacon burger stuffed with melted cheese and topped with spicy jalapeño peppers and roasted tomatoes. The brioche bun was slathered with chipotle mayo which added good zing to a typical Midwestern creation (photo: http://bit.ly/1pFhvXw). Even if it was a bit small, I liked it and shared the accompanying salty fries with Jamie. Oh cool, Blondie...

I ordered the Bacon Avocado Benedict. I love bacon but my Benedict was overwhelmed with bacon. The bacon was extremely well cooked, thick strips that were more hard than crispy and quite salty. There were also bacon bits on top of the tasteless hollandaise. The bits were equally hard and salty. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked with runny yolks and the avocado was, well avocado. This was the first time bacon actually ruined a meal for me. The shredded hash browns were still soggy and white and could have used a few more minutes to brown. The other dishes also looked uninspired. As for the decor, lots of distressed and reclaimed wood with unique works of art. Some of the distressed wood like the floorboards looked more like a product of lack of maintenance than intentional.

My husband and I got some complimentary house drinks with a voucher and we watched a duo band. We had a good time watching the show, and we were excited for the main act, Michael Grimm. 

The waiter we had a large nice man who was eager to serve us at first. He came to our tables and gave us the complimentary drinks within a few minutes of us sitting down. After receiving our drinks, the waiter asked suggested a few items on the menu. After telling him of my husband's seafood allergy, he at two points suggested items with shellfish. He seemed to get fed up raving about items that we could not eat, and said ""well then you decide."" I think he did not understand that some people have allergies or he did not know the menu well enough to suggest items that weren't shellfish. 

Anyways, we ended up taking a moment to discover the menu and ordered the basic jambalaya and gumbo. Surprising, he still asked if we wanted to add shrimp. I said the allergy comment again and he seemed to get annoyed. Anyways, we received our delicious shellfish free food and had a pleasant dinner.

I got a portion of my food to go. But for some reason, it took approximately 30 minutes from when we got our to go box to get our check. Maybe the waiter didn't want to pressure us to leave, but he could have asked us if that was the case.

I am giving the place 3 stars simply because of the awkward service. Waiters need to be trained on the menu and common allergies. He was a nice enough guy, but I seem room for improvement.

First off, I loved the ambiance--the muted lighting, the overhanging tree with rustic metal lanterns, etc. Second, the food was fresh and well-crafted. My husband and I ordered the street tacos and the lobster macaroni and cheese to share. The street tacos came with perfectly cooked carne asada, fresh tomatillo salsa, pico de gallo, and cotija cheese.  The lobster mac was served in an iron skillet--it was delightfully cheesy, topped with well-seasoned bread crumbs, and dotted with sweet pieces of lobster. The attention to detail, the flavor profiles--all worked together to create a wonderfully satisfying meal.

We got a great deal through Restaurant.com so we were able to try a lot of stuff.  It's Vegas baby!  One thing you should know about Restaurant.com coupons is that it may look like a great deal but you need to spend a certain amount to use the coupon.  Our particular coupon was $4 for $50 but you have to spend $100.  Not really a great deal when you think about it.

Back to the yummy food.  The drinks are so yummy.  All of their signature drinks come in either a House of Blues souvenir glass or a souvenir mason jar.  I have both.  Buyer beware though, I think they are super expensive.  They don't list the prices on the menu and I actually have never thought to look but they are somewhere in the range of $20-$30.  Don't quote me on it but def. watch out for that.

My family (husband, brother-in-law, sister, and 4yo niece) meet up in Vegas for a quick family reunion weekend.

As we were seated, Angel was prompt with the introduction of himself and the HOB establishment. He quickly brought our drinks and was informative in explaining the menu. The food came out hot, portions were large, and everyone was happy with their selections. FYI- the eggs benedict is really THE BEST I'VE HAD!  My niece LOVED her pancake and egg from the children's menu.

Angel was VERY nice to my little niece and complimented her on her manners. Angel showed my niece a picture of his adorable dog and my niece LOVED it!  Following our meal, Angel was so kind in taking us on a tour of the venue and explained the history of the HOB décor. His tour was absolutely fascinating and we really got the feel of how much Angel loves his job and how much he supports HOB as well as the artists who perform there. I would like to compliment ANGEL on his genuine kindness and for taking time out of HIS day to give us a tour.

The order also came with french fries, cole slaw, and very vinegary cucumbers. The portion size for this meal is enough for two. I don't really have much more to comment about the food since nothing really wowed me...it was just meh. 

I'd say give this place a try just once if you are around the area, but don't go out of your way just to do so. The prices are a little high for the quality of food and it is pretty dim in there (I guess they are  going for that whole intimate feel). 

Note: They have live music performances which is pretty cool so make sure you get seats where everyone can see the musician because they are going to CHARGE you an ENTERTAINMENT FEE regardless. They stuck us in a corner and were not aware of this fee so it was basically giving them free money.

Key Lime Pie for dessert?  Yes please.  However we were disappointed.  There was not much key lime flavor.  We ate just a few bites.
Will I go back?!?  Maybe if I'm in the Mandalay Bay and I'm hungry but not sure if I would make a special trip to go just for HOB.
The mgr was walking around and specifically came to check on us.  I did see him walk around checking on others but I feel this should be a standard, especially on busy nights. My first visit here, we did not see one mgr in the 2 hours we were there.
Overall, much better experience than my first visit.
Thank you Sasha, Marketing and Promotions Mgr for everything you've done!  It is much appreciated :)",xPSXDnjJ_oXoVSlkvmDItA,2,0,4,HiFB2m9YIC3vmfT2ZvVVKA

When I first saw the menu and the prices, I thought $16.99 for a sandwich was crazy expensive Las Vegas food and it was going to be overrated, but boy was I mistaken - my pulled pork sandwich was huge (about the size of my face) and it was absolutely phenomenal. It is now #2 best BBQ on my list (with #1 being Ocean City, MD's ""Bull on the Beach"").

The service was great and our waiter was courteous and was even open to questions about the HOB venue itself. He also advertised to us that a local blues band was coming back later that evening and we could come back, no purchase necessary, to listen to some great local blues music. The band was decent (""Nothing But The Blues"" but spoiler alert...they play some songs that aren't blues) and even though we didn't have to buy anything, we still bought some drinks to pay for our entertainment.

My waitress was nice, but she reminded me of the gal that was on Seinfeld, a low talker.  I could barely hear anything she was saying.  I hoped I didn't misunderstand anything she said and ended up with a meal I didn't order.
I ordered a shrimp po' boy.  The shrimp was just okay, no spiceyness to it, but the bread it travelled in was bad.  It literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up. For the price, not even remotely worth it.
My wife ordered a salad.  It was lettuce with a small chunk of blue cheese on the top and dressing on the side.  For nine bucks. And though this is no fault of HOB, my wife didn't like the lettuce offered and she asked for another kind.  They did not offer anything else.
Very disappointing meal.  Lots of waitresses and waiters standing around.  It seems like this place is going on it's rock and roll reputation. We will not be back, at least not this location.",tmmEeNlrppyARtYNg-EpLg,0,0,1,oVR2XxB36M6ZtEYBSjDFkQ

That may sound like a backhanded compliment, but from the outside, it sort of just looked like a place to eat.  It's a themed place attached to House of Blues, so I guess I sort of expected it to be like a Rainforest Cafe or a Hard Rock Cafe, both of which I avoid like the plague.  We really only gave this a try because we were there with the family and it seemed like a good place to grab breakfast before heading to the pool.
We did a Monday morning breakfast there with a group of 5.  Everyone liked their meal.  I split the eggs Benedict and the mini-waffles with strawberries with my daughter and we each enjoyed both of them.  I don't normally order eggs Benedict at any place that isn't really high-end because hollandaise sauces can be all over the board, and a bad one can really wreck the meal.  But their's was light, with just enough lemon.  Not to tangy, not too bland.  My table mates also enjoyed pancakes, omelettes and skillet breakfasts.  Not a complaint from anyone.  Our server Bretani was excellent as well, checking back frequently and keeping waters and coffees topped off.  I would definitely go back.",MS5160dww4tX3x03cfk3jA,0,0,5,Z98KMyMNXPx5CJZPGdErGw

5092553,2016-01-08,0,Ls89UV4aSRE8eW2Pj_LaWg,"Most theme restaurants (E.g. Planet Hollywood, Bumba Gump's, etc...) are not known for their food.  They just aren't and that's okay...You go to those types of places for the theme, locale, music, etc.  So during a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was pleasantly surprised to have a tasty meal at the House of Blues.   Here's what we had:
* Voodoo Shrimp - The house favorite, sautéed jumbo shrimp, simmered in an amber beer reduction on top of housemade jalapeño cornbread.  
* Street Tacos - Three street style corn tortillas, green cabbage, fresh pico de gallo, roasted tomatillo salsa, Cotija cheese and avocado lime crème with shrimp; 
* Applewood Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf - A delicious blend of savory flavors wrapped in applewood bacon and topped with our house made wild mushroom sauce, served with fresh vegetables and Red Rose garlic mashed potatoes; 
* Jambalaya - Marinated chicken, white rice, andouille sausage, sweet peppers and roasted green onions in a spicy traditional jambalaya sauce

I don't know who developed the Voodoo Shrimp recipe, but they were working some magic back in that kitchen.  Moist cornbread with expertly cooked shrimp and a killer sauce.  Woo wee!  I think that I'm going start speaking Creole after tasting that dish.  My daughter Muff and one of my nieces asked to have shrimp in their tacos and the kitchen easily obliged.  (That's one advantage of going to a theme restaurant, they aim to please.  No chef driven nonsense where the dish has to remain ""exactly"" how they envisioned it.)  They were gracious enough to share several bites of their tacos and they were tasty.  I actually ordered the meatloaf and I can tell you that my leftovers were great cold the next day. What does that tell you?  It was great hot or cold and that's hard to beat with that yummy mushroom sauce. (I think that there was some form of sausage mixed into the loaf too that gave it an extra special touch.  Yum!) 


My sister-in-law ordered the Jambalaya and she wasn't really pleased with it. (I try to avoid Jambalaya if it's not in New Orleans or a kitchen that I trust.)  She said that the tomato flavor was too overpowering and sharp.  My cousin thought the same thing on a prior visit.)  Overall, we had a really tasty meal and I was really surprised.  Additionally, a live band was there at the time and the music was rocking.  Yay us!

Kitschy, yes!  But enjoyable?  Also, emphatically yes!  This is a themed restaurant where you don't get the blues!  The blues are just in the name!",hnVXeRIxCf6CQc1wcRx3tg,1,0,4,--dybeUgaFdu5K3LZtJdWQ

Joey Kramer's Rockin' and Roastin' Coffee
Buttermilk Biscuits with maple butter
""Big ole' Bluesberry Flapjack"" - blueberries, buttermilk, maple butter, Log Cabin syrup
So French Toast - Raisin Brioche, powdered sugar, Log Cabin syrup

Located in Mandalay Bay and popular for its Gospel Brunch as well as concerts, including a current Santana residency, I'd probably walked by House of Blues fifty times before finally deciding to stop in for breakfast and with pleasant greetings at the door it was mere moments after the 7:00am opening that I was sat at the center of Crossroads, a menu in hand and the first of several cups of coffee poured as Bob Dylan got Tangled Up in Blue overhead.

Obviously a touristy spot, with theme park level decorations from top to bottom and a gift store at the front, suffice it to say that the early morning menu at Crossroads is little more than a collection of upcharged American classics and unfortunately informed that there was ""no way"" the restaurant's signature cornbread could be prepared before the unlisted 11:30 lunch hour it was in a trio of personal favorites that I instead decided to invest - the $32 tab after tax and tip only serving to further salt a wound created by a meal in which only the fluffy biscuits proved memorable in the least.

Admittedly taking a chance in visiting anyplace that proudly advertises the use of Log Cabin 'syrup' it was within a seemingly inconceivable seven minutes of ordering that my items emerged from the kitchen and already smirking at the three tiny berries alongside a $5.99 flapjack the situation became all the more amusing when I realized there were probably only a half-dozen more within the buttermilk batter - the whipped butter and 100% Maple Syrup brought from home doing an admirable job of at least making the pancake worth eating while neither did much to rescue the dismal French Toast that was neither 'thick cut' nor particularly fluffy, no matter what the menu would lead one to believe.

Touting the recipes of Aaron Sanchez, apparently a Chef of some celebrity renown, one would be hard pressed to name any particular reason to visit Crossroads for breakfast in a resort featuring Citizens, Veranda, or Della's Kitchen and with a dinner menu that seems to tread in the same waters it seems a good bet to go elsewhere for later meals as well, though I will admit the cornbread and bread pudding still present at least a little bit of intrigue while the soundtrack trends better than almost any on the Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,2,2,BFjBfftV5wsTzxJkz3Cqrg

If you come to eat after watching the Michael Jackson One show, there's a 20% off discount in the small program for Crossroads.  Our server allowed us to ask for two bills as we were two couples.  And we each used our discount coupon.

I just broke my own rule....don't order crab, lobster, or shrimp from places that don't specialize in seafood.

5522402,2014-12-08,0,Ls89UV4aSRE8eW2Pj_LaWg,"This is a great place to grab a bite while you're waiting for a concert at the House of Blues, since you're literally next door to the concert hall. The food is delicious, and the service is superb. The prices are a tad high for the portions, though that's at least consistent with the theory of a restaurant next to a concert hall in a hotel in Las Vegas, so it's not a huge surprise.
I cannot recommend the sliders highly enough; they're fantastically delicious, and you can add on a couple extras if you're hungrier than the three or four or whatever's included by default for $9.99. The meatball ones were delightfully spiced--not overhot, just enough to make you feel it--and I probably ate more of them than I likely should've. I burned the calories off rocking out later in the evening, though, so it probably balanced out.
The beer selection is only so-so, especially when it comes to drafts. For Guinness or anything microbrewed, you'll need to go to a bottle, which can rack up the cost quickly when you're talking a 12-ounce bottle for seven dollars instead of a sixteen-ounce pint for about the same, but the food's worth it. Just make sure you have something to wash it down with.
The service was always great when we were in, though sometimes the cover bands they had playing weren't stellar. Maybe it's an unfair comparison from me, as I was there to see a professional band rocking their auditorium later that night and nothing was going to quite compare, but their Rockstar Karaoke where they have people sing in front of a live band was fun (or, alternatively, horrifying--after all, it *is* karaoke) to watch.

We came here on Thursday to see a friend perform at local singer/songwriter night.  That part was awesome. The acoustics were great, our friend Eric Alesi performed great and even the next band sounded great.

As for the food, their jalepeno corn bread is excellent, not too spicy but with enough kick to keep you drinking :)  Their drinks come in a souvenier mug but are not outrageously priced.  The Peach drink was excellent.

We had the fried chicken which was well prepared and came with a thigh, drumstick, wing and breast with side of bacon mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was the way I like it with very little if any liquid.

We also had the ahi salad.  The salad tasted great and we loved the dressing.  Only 4 pieces of Ahi though. A little disappointing for $16.99.

What keeps this place from the 5th star?  Despite the taste, the prices exceed the quality or quantity.

Decided to use my $100 coupon that I purchased from restaurant.com a year ago (they don't expire) for dinner our last night in Vegas.  I usually leave my last day of vacation for shopping and souvenir buying, didn't quite work out as planned this time.  Went to HOB around 5pm and they were transitioning from lunch to dinner so we had a little wait but no problem because they text you when your table is ready.  We returned after getting the text and was seated immediately.  We had a wonderful waiter who was and older gentleman but I cant remember his name.  On to the $100 worth of food that went a long way between three people.  For starters we ordered the Voodoo shrimp on top of jalapeno bread.  Please order this, I can't even describe the level of flavor and happiness that this dish brought me:)  Entrees were the island burger, buffalo wings and fish tacos.  All were divine.  Dessert was banana bread that I can not comment on because I don't eat anything banana flavored but it looked good and friends said it tasted equally as good as it looked.  I ordered the jalapeno bread with maple butter as my dessert but it's actually and appetizer.  For some reason the spiciness of the bread really do mesh well with the sweetness of the butter.  We also ordered 1 sangria each and half way through we were really feeling it.  After dinner around 7:30 we were so stuffed that we were miserable and could barely walk.  We decided to go upstairs to the room and ""take a nap"" to recuperate and restart our evening of shopping.  When we woke up it was to the sound of an alarm clock at 430am to pack and head to the airport for our 6am flight.
