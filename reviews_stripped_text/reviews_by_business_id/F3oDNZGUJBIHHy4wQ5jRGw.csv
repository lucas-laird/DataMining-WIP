The blizzards in the mini size is just the right amount, the small is certainly shareable, and the medium or large is if you feel like living on the edge or eating your daily calorie allotment all in one sitting. And don't forget the different types of candy in the blizzards you can choose from.

If you want to go the simple route - i go with a chocolate dipped vanilla cone - which also comes in varying sizes.

1321014,2016-05-31,1,F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,"Only reason this place gets 2 Stars is because the Blizzard is not deserving of a 0.

Short recap: Ordered a 1/2 lb Flamethrower, drink, fries and an Oreo cookie blizzard with fudge in the middle.

   The burger was nasty, and I don't mean that lightly.  For all my old school peeps it was a hamburger a-la-Mondo-Burger from Good Burger type deal.  The burger was a big, had over cooked and dry patties, wilted lettuce, old tomatoes. Completely unappealing and unsavory.  0 Stars.

   The fries did not fare much better.  Old & stale, flimsy not crispy, after a few threw them away fries.  Sad showing.  0 Stars.

   The only bright spot of the whole meal?  The Blizzard.  Always satisfying, cool, sweet but not ridiculously sweet like say an Oreo cookie shake from Burger King which tastes like you're sucking diabetes through a straw.  The blizzard hit the spot in this ""cool"" 95 degree weather here in Vegas.  It had a great mix of Oreo cookies, fudge was really good tasting.  The Blizzard is a winner.  5 Stars.

   About the service.  I've never come across an unhappy worker here, and although the food could be better prepared I believe it's more of people working with products that they're given to work with than them actually having a good product to put out to the public.  That's just my opinion hence 3 Stars.

Add that up divide by 4 and you get 2 Stars.",FaeY4ILFh6r1WpJDWc19Tw,0,0,2,5kSySTG9ri1KU92gwWUrFA

There were about a dozen of us that came in at around 645pm and a few more small families and individuals who trickled in after in the 1 hour duration we were there. It seemed the manager Joseph got somehow overwhelmed and was stomping around talking crap. At first I thought he was just a regular team member as his professionalism was non-existent as he demeaned another employee in front of my party. (I promise this is an understatement). For the whole hour we were there, he was just ripping everyone a new one, dropping things on the floor, yelling at every single team member...and when I say at every single one, I really mean literally and very audibly where the whole store can hear. As we got up to leave, I parked myself near the register as there's a little side counter next to the registers. At that point, Joseph was on a rampage telling all of his employees ""I'll write all of your a*s' up! I'm the manager!!!"" Now as a manager myself of a corporate level business, I was absolutely appalled at his behavior. All of the team members were head down trying to get through their orders and Joseph verbally bashing the entire team, putting on public display his disgusting power trip. I feel SO bad for that team and if Joseph was my employee, he would be fired on the spot for inciting work place hostility. I hope the owner of this establishment is reading this because something NEEDS to be done with that guy. He is a disaster and he is bad for business and work place morale.

1479688,2015-10-19,8,F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,"I think I am finally done with Dairy Queen! I couldn't wait to have a waffle dipped ice cream cone. Dairy Queen has totally ruined the experience for me.

Let me ask my Yelp family what they think: 

1.  When you order soft served ice-cream in a waffle dipped cone, do you expect to hold it so you can lick the tasty ice-cream while gently nibbling away at the cone? (or something like that :)

Or...  

2.  When you order your soft served ice-cream in a waffle dipped cone, do you expect to have it handed to you in a cone shaped cup with a long spoon? 

I know strange question right? Well, apparently the latter is the way they serve their waffle ice-cream cones at this Dairy Queen location. I literally took my cone out of it's protective casing and handed it back to the staff member. 

I figured out why they have the casing though. The ice cream melts before you get out the door and the waffle cone doesn't hold the melted milk from dripping out of the bottom. In fact the entire cone disintegrates before you can get half way done with the cone. 

Check out my friend's cone and casing - he ordered the same thing I did (pictured).

When I buy an ice-cream cone, I expect to hold the cone free of a protective casing. Additionally, when I buy ice-cream, I don't expect to get milk.",jY1shXf_LQVhSoUyoXqQRQ,11,3,1,Iv1DuviManj3fyhgQiEn1w

DQ updates their menu frequently, so it is always fun to see what the new flavor of blizzard will be.  My favorite is still chocolate chip cookie dough and brownie bites, though the Jurassic World promotional flavor with added peanut butter cookie dough to the mix was pretty good.

The service is pretty standard.  Nothing great, nothing bad.  I still don't get why they turn your blizzard upside down before serving it to you everytime, so I just giggle at them.  Does it ever fall out?  According to a sign, if they don't do this, they will give you a free blizzard.

We went to drive thru, and hardly got a response from the person working. She didn't confirm our order or acknowledge the last two items we ordered. She told us our total would be at the window. 

When we pulled up, she just looked angry to be there. She confirmed our order, but one item was wrong so we repeated the order back to her correctly. She didn't confirm the items and instead just gave us the total due and slammed the window shut. Literally slammed. 

We ordered 4 blizzards and a dipped cone. She tipped one blizzard sideways, not upside down. I don't usually care about that, but when it's 105 outside, I'd like to be sure my ice cream isn't already melted. She put everything in a drink tray and gave us the dipped cone. We drive away and open our blizzards to find that they're already half melted. The dipped cone was melting soon after and beyond soggy on the actual cone. 

We were hot and wanted our treats so we started to eat them. But soon they were all soup! We got home not 5 minutes after receiving out items and had to toss the dipped cone. We put everything else into the freezer to harden.

3412540,2012-06-09,1,F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,"This review is about this DQ's service and product:

Product: My husband and I ordered a hot fudge sundae and a dipped cone from the DQ drive thru. His hot fudge sundae came exactly the way it was supposed, however, when the drive thru rep handed us my order, she gave me a plain vanilla cone. I had advised that it was supposed to be dipped. After about a minute or so, she handed me my dipped cone. Now, I have been to this Dairy Queen several times and what was handed me was a vanilla cone with a very very very thin layer of chocolate around the ice cream (please see picture). I have ordered this item in the past and never has the chocolate looked like that. Yes, I'm complaining about the amount of chocolate that was used on my cone, but specifically the quality and presentation is what I really had a problem with. 

Service: I went into the DQ and politely asked to speak with someone. When the manager approached me I advised that I was a bit dissatisfied with the end result. He stated, ""The chocolate is too hot and that's why it looks like that on the ice cream"". There was no apology, and in fact, I'm a bit sad at the way he made me feel as if I was bothering him. I asked just for a new plain vanilla cone instead. As he walked away to make it, he looked over his shoulder and said, ""You can throw that one away"". I did. He came back and handed me a plain cone and said nothing. At this point, I was so surprised with the lack of customer service that I took the cone and walked out. There was no sincerity or apology. Not that I was looking for that, but I do expect to be treated at least somewhat nicely as I was not irate or even mad about the situation until the manager told me to throw my original order away. In addition, there was no refund for the difference. I know we're talking about small change here, but being the manager he should have at least refunded me for the difference. 

I understand they were busy, but I can't understand being treated like a bother. Although this place is just a few blocks away from me, I would rather go out of my way for ice cream than ever go here again.",d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,2,0,1,Zhu1TEU3LnRxYERfii9oQg

He trains the employees to make these pathetic sized dipped cones. All my life we have went to DQ for special treats.  Love the dipped cones they are always made as wide as the cone. This place fills the cones and there is 1/4 inch space between the edge of the cone and the  ice cream all the way around. They are so skinny that they start falling over when you eat it. I've questioned different times always a different answer. This night I was told it's like that to catch anything that melts. That is just sad. If I'm paying $3+ For soft serve ice cream that costs you pennies on the dollar make it like all the other DQ'S do. Won't go back again.

The staff is obviously still in the process of training. When I ordered my blizzard the girl had no idea how to ring it up. But everyone was very nice and friendly. After you order they'll bring the food out to your table.

What a joke what kid doesn't enjoy a personal ice cream cake every now and again.. They have given me a burger with no burger patty!!! By far the worst Dairy Queen I've ever been to.,kF58HY4OSIJEsHvCn5YpdA,0,0,1,x6PoqYjvThj8enT_sRWxiw

I got a small peanut butter sundae, since  when is ice cream with a sauce called a sundae, shouldn't there be whipped cream? The offering of nuts maybe.  And small is really small. My husband's Guardian of the Galaxy blizzard was done to his liking, again a small should be labeled child's size. Now the most important item, the banana split hardly had any ice cream in it, it did have sauce and whipped cream, hallelujah but what a disappointment for the price. Now I remember why I never go to Dairy Queen.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,7,4,2,Rk4zWSWBcJib_8xI4c6C7A
5481732,2017-03-15,1,F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,"I totally understand the two star rating!  I'm LIVID and FUMING.  I ordered a peanut butter & hot fudge sundae with crunch coat.   After being hollered at via drive thru HUH HUH HUH three times I spoke louder and she told me we don't have crunch coat.  I asked then to have sprinkles with a little tiny bit or nuts to make it like crunch coat.  SO I pulled around as I pulled around I was almost struck by a car reversing I'm assuming cause there order was messed up.  I paid for my sundae which she grabbed my payment with her gloves on which is gross since she will still touch food with those money handling gloves and because the car in front of me had mistakes in the order I double checked mine and mine was wrong.  I had to beep my horn and knock on the window and kindly says mam I asked for peanut butter I was already a little annoyed I was charged for sprinkles AND nuts rather than since they are out of the crunch coat and it was 12 Spanish nuts just do half and half but then she handed the sundae back to be and just pumped peanut butter all on top of the sundae rather than make a new one and I was a little upset when she handed it to me like that cause I am an elite yelper wanted to take a photo but it looked awful.  Now is when I realize I also wasn't given napkins but it poured all over me when I opened it. And it's not like it melted. I parked on the lot to eat it.  Rather than remake the sundae she poured it to the brim and my pants and brand new BRAND NEW $90 nikes are stained!   And she was not happy me and the car in front of me both had issues!   This is awful!   I seriously am so angry.  I work so hard for my money and my pants are salvageable but I can't get the stain outta my shoes and I can't express how lazy and careless this women is and it's the STORE MANAGER.  If the owners are reading this I suggest u have secret shoppers go in and handle this.  The young man Brandon or Brando felt awful and offered me napkins and asked if there's anything he can do seeing me covered in product!   LIVID!  (Excuse errors I'm speaking texting this). But this is the type of employee who if a guest orders a burger no tomato and returns saying they're sorry but they are allergic to tomatoes this type of employee will go back and just pull the tomato off and give patron burger then then patron will die from an allergic reaction.  Just plan lazy!   She did not care at all it was dripping all over me!  I told her very frustrated ""you should made a new sundae to compensate that there was obviously no room for more sauce"" and she was furious I made that statement!   I would love compensation but will never get it judging by the 2 stars!  I almost wanna pay a homeless person struggling for money to picket outside with a sign I'm so mad how I was treated...",Xb4aKpOlHkp9dmgTa__Q4g,4,0,1,qOYXZd-_d_52xTr_i4lbBw
5553245,2012-01-21,2,F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,"When it comes to Ice Cream at Dairy Queen nothing beats the Reese Peanut Butter Blizzard with Brownies...  This is one of those treats that should only be had once in a while as too keep from going into sugar overload.

This DQ is located in a nice shopping center where you can grab a dinner then head over for dessert... For me this visit was a sweet tooth needing an infusion of Peanut Butter & Chocolate!!! It was all that I needed the warm brownie chunks smothered in hot fudge, Vanilla Ice cream,  broken pieces of Reese Cups, & Creamy Peanut Butter all that slammed in a Blizzard Cup... Damn it was so good!!!!

The staff seemed overwhelmed when given more than three customers...  The girl working the register was totally lost after taking all our orders forgetting what orders where for who... Maybe that night she was new not sure but over all My Blizzard was Awesome so hats off to the Kid in the back making my order...

Overall:
Great Blizzard
Good Customer Service
Good Location",GDkqeA3M_o-4gs3UPB8Jag,2,2,4,ugf7ZSWz8wWdA5Q87BJLFA

The girls who work here seem like they don't enjoy it. I always get blank stares and it's not really friendly environment. But, the ice cream is just as any other DQ would be. Their swirls aren't as good as other DQs I've been too. Kinda sloppy. But regardless, wouldn't need to expect much effort from these kind of ice cream stores.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,1,1,3,G8ZAZltYQ2fjtgPOa5J2Wg
5939839,2017-09-24,0,F3oDNZGUJBIHHy4wQ5jRGw,I woukd give this place negative stars is possible.   The management must be complexity oblivious as to how to run an establishment.   Tonight is the  final time I will visit this place.    Everytime I come here the drive thru speaker is impossible to communicate on.  The staff is not very friendly and it takes 30-40 min everytime I go.  Went tonight and the drive thru was wrapped around the building blocking the drive way so we went inside and it was straight chaos.  People everywhere with messed up orders and after almost 8 min we were not even acknowledge so we left.   Horrible horrible horrible customer service.,aDiizZZrtnSlMIqEDAWRTA,0,0,1,FqfX7v-wUI2oZeflgVl8YA
