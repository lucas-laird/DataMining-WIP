I had the grilled fish tacos with a frozen ""funky monkey"" banana cocktail, and my sister had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious and our server (John?) was a total sweetheart. I'll definitely be back next pool season!",YYHLtei6reMtU_PoQCzigA,0,0,5,M_KwaW5A_zmOZbGmoVo1wA

She then turned to her friend that came after us.  She turned to them started talking and catching up with them and totally ignored us.  I mean OBVIOUSLY ignored us.  I assume she doesn't care for gay people or perhaps we were not the right race. HOWEVER, we left, dusted our shoes off and will not return.",HeudoJADaEQS3nNVPXzaoQ,0,0,1,6PCCDvrXqcrj3Hh-X8FhhA

923822,2015-05-26,0,zJ1kytRoyIHKqhl1DounBQ,"If you are staying at Bellagio, forget about the Cafe Bellagio next to the conservatory and try this beautiful Pool cafe!!!

It is located in the controlled access pool area so I believe only room guests can go in.  That is provably why they weren't so busy even though we were there for busy Memorial Day weekend.

After we secure our loungers in the pool, we come here to have a breakfast and we weren't expected the breakfast experience to be this wonderful!!  

I ordered All American breakfast (2 eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes, tomato, and English muffin) all for $16.  My husband ordered ham and cheese omelet $15. The server asked if he want to add something on the top of ham and cheese, he added few items which later we found out each cost $2.  It does not stated in the menu so watch that if you are cost conscious person like me.  The breakfast potatoes were so much better than hash brown offered at the cafe Bellagio.

Our server was very nice but hostesses (couple of lady at the cafe front desk) were typical Bellagio's energy saving mode machine like service.  

Since we stayed two nights, we decided to give a try for the cafe Bellagio next morning but we were so regret that we did not come back to this pool cafe.  Cafe Bellagio was just bunch of tourists crammed in a very standard restaurant decor, you are expected get fed and go. Pretty much same price but the Pool Cafe has spacious open air seating areas and much better quality!!",2Lhrc32Ia0bH6bNdbsDkNA,4,0,5,ntDL0NsXo9MJysGkpX6HpA
1232281,2015-04-11,0,zJ1kytRoyIHKqhl1DounBQ,"What a lovely place, located right on the pools at the Bellagio.  

After a morning of swimming with the little, we all were ready for some lunch.  The staff were so great with our daughter, literally treating her like (and calling her) a princess.  She felt so fancy.  

It's a delightful outdoor cafe with pergolas overhead with the best view.  

The food was lovely, as well!  I'd been dying for a margarita pizza and they had one!! And it did not disappoint!  My husband had the fish tacos, which he said he enjoyed.  Our daughter tried their popcorn chicken, which she'd never had before.  It's always a little scary when a kid this picky orders something she's never had.  But, she devoured it.  

I want to say that our total bill was around $45, which is about average for a place like this in a resort, but we loved it all so much that we'd do it again!  Be aware though, that although it is the Pool Cafe, you do have to wear clothes to be seated; you can't just waltz in wearing your bikini.",8bhKhUCpEa5Ugrplbt4cag,0,1,5,d_uclHJnJrOwcxU8h3aJvA
1327012,2017-09-05,0,zJ1kytRoyIHKqhl1DounBQ,"My favorite spot in ALL of Las Vegas! Stinks you have to be a guest of the hotel to visit this little paradise! 

 For starters the staff is second to none and over the top friendly. I have had the same server twice and she really made an effort to get to know us and our vacation and even remembered us the second time we came the following year.

 The menus (for breakfast and lunch) are just the right size. A lot of options but not overwhelming. For breakfast I have tried the pancakes and French toast and both are to die for, very fluffy and plated nicely. For lunch I tried the grilled cheese with pita fries AH-MAZING! 

Prices are a little high but what can you expect! You are at Bellagio after all.

The servers could not have been more sweet and attentive--every one more delightful than the next.  The only issue was the smoking clientele.  It's odd to me that smoking is allowed at any restaurant.  Are we back in the 80's?  Isn't there laws or codes preventing ingesting Marlboro's with every bite of chicken???  I'm not an expert and don't really care enough to investigate, but seems to me that whoever is in charge at the Bellagio needs to examine this.  It's one thing when I'm in the casino, but a whole different story when I'm outside trying to enjoy lunch.",Db80SCez0BdYaHdC0xmzoQ,17,13,3,gq4TiKMuHsvEgQHDmDT-cg

5503752,2017-07-14,0,zJ1kytRoyIHKqhl1DounBQ,"While staying at The Bellagio, myself and my two friends dined here for breakfast. It was about 10:00am on a Tuesday, and they were fairly busy, but not overly so. We were seated right away, then waited about ten minutes for a server to greet us, so we went ahead and ordered both our drinks and dishes at the same time. I had the seasonal fruit and yogurt panna cotta, and my friends had the breakfast sandwich (comes with a side of mixed fruit), the papaya fruit bowl, plus a side of scrambled eggs and sausage.

The food arrived quickly enough, but was incredibly disappointing. The panna cotta was just odd...not sweet at all (reminded me more of a gelatinized sour cream than anything else). My friend commented that the croissant on her sandwich reminded her of a lesser version of a Costco croissant. None of the fruit was ripe AT ALL. Everything was all average to below average, which would have been disappointing, but not terrible, except it came out to be about $20.00 per person. How can you not even manage ripe fruit at that price point? 

After suffering through our lackluster breakfast we stacked our plates and waited for the check. And waited. And waited. I won't say this was our server's fault, as he was running around and seemed quite busy (although he clearly noticed we were finished more than once). Come on, though. If you need more waitstaff then hire some! We are at The Bellagio, which is supposed to be a paragon of luxury in Vegas (I think, right? Am I wrong? I've consistently been disappointed by them, so maybe they aren't?). We honestly waited at least 15 minutes (I feel like it was 20-25, but my friend says 15, so I'll be generous in my estimate). The only reason we even got the check was because we eventually just flagged him down. $60+ later we were finally on our way...",a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g,0,0,2,RxXQA0D5jT9RknYPjD20Qw

The gyro itself isn't amazing mainly due to the meat and a lack of flavor or seasoning.  It's a bit bland and your local Greek place at home probably has a better version.  The pita fries with hummus that come with the gyro are AMAZING.  The burger is also super flavorful and tastes like it was grilled over open flame.

Service is friendly and food came out quickly. No complaints here.

Food was delicious and fresh. I had two poached eggs, with a side of hashbrowns and potatoes. My daughter had the corned beef hash. Everything was great. 

I hesitate to mention my only complaint, which is that charging $7.50 for a glass of orange juice is simply ludicrous. But I suppose I should have asked the price before ordering it.
