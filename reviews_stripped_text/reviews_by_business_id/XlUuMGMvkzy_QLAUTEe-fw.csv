Upon arriving we did get greeted and seated. However, we had to get the two servers attention to take our order. When we told one of the ladies we are ready to order she gave us attitude. When she brought our drinks over she just slammed it on the table and didn't even give us any straws. 

Now to the food. We ordered the beef soup dumpling, beef dumpling, house fried rice, deep fried squid, and duck. All were delicious! You can tell that the dumpling are made fresh. 

Overall, I would of gave this place a better review if the service wasn't bad.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,0,2,5zX6kRBTXoTxFT0bnNO5yQ

Atmosphere- Nice little place with very bright flowery decor, hehe. Also soothing music playing in the background.

Service- We came just a bit after they opened, so we were able to be seated right away. Service was friendly; the woman brought our tea within a couple of minutes and came by to take our order shortly after.

Food- The food was pretty good. We ordered 5 dishes: Tossed Mung Clear Noodles, Szechuan Fish Fillet with Sour Cabbage, Beef Soup Dumpling, Beef Patty, and the Sauteed Potatoes with Eggplant. The tossed noodles was the perfect chilled dish for this hot weather. Pretty sure it's a peanut based sauce and it was tasty. The fish dish was HUGE, as it was more like a soup dish. It was really flavorful. Both the dumpling and patty were good as well, but I wish the patty had a little bit more flavor and less oily. The beef soup also didn't have as much juice in it as I thought (also less compared to other soup dumplings I've had). The eggplant was leaning more towards the salty side, so I recommend getting rice if you are going to order that dish. 

If you're passing by and in need of some food, stop by and try this place.",Mji05ZiUS4dtjjAH8oQ5mg,1,0,3,t6m25pw_i55DJykDp30Mrw

I've seen this place many time but never tried it. Decided to change that since they were about to open. Glad I did. 
Met the staff since I arrived as they did. Nice group. 
Ordered the stone dumplings, soup dumplings and lamb dumplings. I'd have gotten a main dish but wanted to get a to go order since I thought I'd still be getting Ramen Tatsu. 
Oh no, this place hit the spot. 
Stone Dumplings were the best, Soup Dumplings next. Not too much packed in the soup dumplings, which was a plus for me because I didn't want them to explode on me. 
Lamb Dumplings were good but I enjoyed the other two more so. 

Not bad on the price. I eat a lot so I had 30 dumplings total. The service was fast and the waiting couch they had was well laid out. 

In the end, I picked up too many to even think about adding ramen from Ramen Tatsu into the mix. 

I'll return, and I definitely recommend Dumpling King. I'd give them 5 stars, but I would need to try a few other Dumpling joints in town before I'm able to do that.",i2FwE_mO8a5EtAf-KIi9_w,2,2,4,EeQeqjlHf7GNQF6w_pytJQ

Back to yelp. Found Dumpling King. Walked it to this very ""loud"" decorated place, only two other diners. Hmmmm.... Let's order small, try it out and if the first couple items are good we will order more. If not- we leave and yelp again. Needless to say we stayed and thanked the yelp gods for bestowing this delicious gem upon us! Holy smokes. The food was amazing. Different than most Chinese restaurants. We could not order everything that peeked out interest but I will tell you that everything we did order was on point. Just wonderful. The only item we did not get a photo of were the juicy beef dumplings (the reason we went here!) because we devoured them the minute they hit the table.

1327659,2015-09-22,2,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"I consider myself a princess so it only seemed fitting that I came to the Dumpling King! We were a party of four and came here for dinner. To start, the decor here is overstimulating and has a Christmas/Chinese New Year feel to it all year 'round. On a good day, it's comical. On a bad day, it could be annoying. Definitely not the place to come if you have a headache or are hungover. To make matters worse, the bathrooms smelled like sewage. I definitely recommend to management that they fix this promptly, as it gives the restaurant an unclean atmosphere.

So we definitely didn't come here for the decor nor the ambiance. We came here for the food. I love XLB (soup filled dumplings). It's one of my favorite Asian dishes. We ordered the beef soup dumplings, leek dumplings, beef with green peppers, and the teppan tofu. 

*Beef soup dumplings*: I was the most excited about this dish, but they were very disappointing. They did not come out hot, they came out warm. The meat wasn't tender or flavorful nor was there enough soup inside the dumpling. The skin was too thin and all together made for a pretty below average dumpling. Whomp whomp whomp!

*Teppan Tofu*: This dish came out sizzling hot off the wok, as it was still sizzling when it was placed on the table! This was the group favorite. The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and paired nicely with the sauces and meat it was cooked in. Definitely my favorite dish.
 
*Beef with green pepper*: This came out still sizzling on the plate in front of us as well. It tasted exactly as expected, no surprises, pleasant or unpleasant.

*Leek Dumplings"": The second table favorite. The pancake outside was crispy and housed the inside leek filling well. With some black vinegar, the dumpling was very delicious.

The service was very slow. Our pot of tea was empty by the time all of the food had been brought to our table, however the refill did not come until just before the check came. The food here is average, but it does taste like home cooking. Unfortunately, although their name suggests that they are the ""Dumpling King"" I definitely wouldn't give them the crown. I would come here for anything but the soup filled dumplings (xlb) and would recommend the Teppan Tofu and the Leek Dumplings.",crbSw0mo0j-PGPxaDs7YoQ,3,2,3,MFRi0MdYJPnEx6sCXr9lXA

There was some confusion about Hubs' order so we ended up with more food than we really wanted, but they removed one of the dishes from the tab, which made us happy.

Stone Dumplings: OMG, yum! Slightly better than standard pot stickers I've had, and the ""crust"" was perfect for absorbing the vinegar on my plate and seasoning these without having to dunk them in a pot of sauce.

Soup Dumplings: once again, OMG yum! Perfect little bite sized dumplings of soup and filling.  Do NOT make the mistake I did of trying to just bite into one, I got soup all over the table and myself.. it's amazing how much is in each of these little dumplings.

Meat Patty: rather like a seasoned burger inside a  tortilla, not sure what all is there but it was delicious (and I'm not a burger fan)

Chicken hot pot: one of Hubs' orders, and the one he regrets most because of the large pot of Sterno underneath which nauseated him and ruined the rest of the meal for him. I only got a small taste of that one, it was furiously hot and I was having a dumpling party, but it was good. Small pieces of chopped up chicken (bones and all) seasoned and in a pot with some shredded vegetables underneath.

Duck something: I didn't catch the full name of this dish, it wasn't on the menu but recommended by the owner.  Hubs ordered this, but wasn't able to eat due to the Sterno mentioned above.  I got a small taste, it was pretty excellent duck - cooked, sliced, laid out on a platter.

We'll definitely be going back, but we'll be avoiding the hot pot dishes for Hubs' sake.  The dumplings were just THAT good :D",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,1,1,5,9nO_UL_G8zO_RHvMKPz4rw

We ended up getting four or five orders of beef meat dumplings - they were really juicy and tasty. Make sure you ask for hot sauce! (they don't have sriracha though). We then got a couple orders of the same type of beef meat on the inside but it was fried this time. It looked really cool when it came out. It looked like there was a spider web of some sort on top of the dumplings. It was really crunchy and good. Make sure you blow on it a couple times because its mucho mucho hot on the inside. My boyfriend bit into it too fast and screamed...lolol unless you want some sort of entertainment hahahah We then got an order of the fried salt and pepper shrimp.

The restaurant name is a bit misleading, as they do offer several dumplings (arguably more than anywhere else in town?) but that does not seem to be their strongest dish. Note that the owners are Muslim and do not serve pork products. 

The cumin lamb was easily my favorite dish of the night! Juicy meat with grilled peppers and onions, with plenty of cumin seasoning and cilantro. A must-order. Other standouts include the hot oil and fish dish (can't remember the exact name), and the braised shrimp with sweet potato and bean sprouts. The blistered green beans are a safe side, and done well. 

About the dumplings: the juicy beef soup dumplings were both beefy and juicy, if you cold manage to get them without tearing. The lamb dumplings are the ones I was most looking forward to, and they were a bit bland. We tried one or two more varieties, and their flavors weren't really as distinct and robust as I'd hoped. I guess we shouldn't have spent so much time taking photos and talking, it seemed the quality went down as they cooled.

1935632,2016-04-23,0,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"In China, there are many ethnic groups. This restaurant's Chinese name indicates that they are of the Hui Race. The Hui race is essentially of Muslim religion. Pork is not eaten.  As such I expect a very different style of cooking and ethnic variety - mainly mutton and beef dishes with various hot spice flavor. 

My wife and I visited this place for lunch. 

This is a relatively small size restaurant. All the tables and chairs are covered with a flower  patterned red cloth. Certainly, very different than the traditional Chinese eateries. 

Since it is lunch, we ordered:

1. Onion Pancake - $6.99. Good flavor and size. But nothing really to brag about. A solid B. 

2. Chicken and Potato in a Hot Clay Pot - $7.99. A Lunch Special. This is a clay pot with chicken ( with bones and skin ) cooked in a brown sauce with chunks of potato. Unfortunately, there is little or no flavoring.  Price is reasonable but still only a D.

3. Toothpick Beef - $14.90. This is a special Chef recommended dish. This is actually a very interesting dish -- pieces of cooked beef skewered on to tooth picks. A very tedious way of presentation. Flavor is interesting as it has various middle eastern type of spice mixed in. Degree of ""Hotness"" is actually quite acceptable. I am OK with this dish but my wife has issues. I venture to guess some folks will like this type of flavoring while others may not. Therefore this dish cannot be graded.

I wish this restaurant luck as it seems to cater only to a special group of customers. I am reluctant to grade this eatery, although tentatively I have offered a 3 star rating.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,0,0,3,IA2earrb4YlhLw-mY6TA_A

How to begin? 

We hit this joint on Christmas day with the parental units who had come from out of town. We had called ahead to reserve a table at 6:30pm. It was a good thing we called ahead and made reservations but I am not sure if we just lucked out because there was no reservation card on our table. 

We were seated promptly but that was about the only thing we got in a timely manner. 

Menus? Sorry we only have 3 menus in the restaurant and someone else is using it so you have to wait. Hot water? Sorry we don't have hot water only tea.(yeah...WTF, right?) Tea? Oh yeah sorry,  we forgot it. Oh and not to mention that several items on the menu were not available. 

Of what was left, we tried their lamb soup, stir-fried beef,  yellow croaker with tofu,  home style tofu, potstickers, Mongolian pancakes. We ordered two additional dishes however one of them they forgot to add it to our tab so it never got made. The second one they ran out but forgot to tell us. 

Okay let's get down to the details. 

Potstickers were nothing special. The wrappers were too thick,and lacked the crispy bottom. Plus they skimped on the filling. 

Lamb soup was okay - it was a chicken based soup with vermicelli, nappa cabbage and cilantro. This was a decent dish. 

Mongolian pancakes had minimal filling and were really soggy and doughy. 

The stir-fried dishes had way too much goopy sauce and were overly salty. The yellow croaker fish dish was especially offensive. 

Between the lackluster dishes and the poor service I see no reason to return. Honestly,  the only reason they get a 2 starred review is because the food was at least edible but not palatable.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,4,2,TslD7DtCYeV2NPbFC_hT-Q

2496921,2015-07-24,11,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"We all know the famous Chinese proverb, ""He who depends on himself will attain the greatest order of dumplings."" Still, few actually realize this experience with dumplings as good as the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings at Dumpling King!

I have been to Dumpling King a few times in small parties, but finally had the opportunity to come in with a large group of wonderful friends to try a ton of dishes family style...we were so satisfied and glad we came here. Dumpling King consistently impressed me dish after dish. I know we did our homework and ordered some of their more popular items, but I still couldn't believe how much I enjoyed every item we shared. 

Dishes that I absolutely recommend include: 
Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings
Fried Lamb w/ Cumin
Spicy Laoganma Sauced Eggplant
Teppan Tofu
Vegetable or Shrimp Fried Noodles
Fried String Beans

Other dishes that we've enjoyed include: 
Lamb Boiled Dumplings
Boiled Shrimp Egg and Leek Dumplings
Crystal Beef Grilled Dumplings

Conditional recommendations:
Baked Yoked Coated Pumpkin if you like pumpkin or backed yolk
Toffee Taro if love sweet taro and don't mind taking the chance of loosing a tooth
Spicy Cold Noodles if you're into it (in the words of  Bret and Jemaine)

Some have argued the merit if their name... dumplings aren't necessarily the mainstay of their menu... they have a few varieties, but not a royal selection. I can understand others linguistic sentiments on those grounds, but then again the XLB dumplings are the most consistent and my favorite in town!... and I've certainly tried all the good XLB dumplings in town. Dumpling King's are different though in that theirs are made with beef instead of pork. I am a fan of pork XLB but the superior soup, wrapper, and consistently put Dumpling King on top...for Vegas anyway. 

Simply put, Dumpling King is basically what you'd expect from your above-average Northern Chinese Muslim restaurant. ...which is in fact different from the typical Chinese restaurant, so don't expect the usual here.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,22,17,5,FYYclSmOlYsXLQg8dz-yWg

Crystal pan fried dumplings (same comment)
Beef roll/chinese burrito (actually really good but a little light on the meat)
Leek pancakes (not bad)

String beans (tasty, but oily)
Shrimp hand tossed noodles (wife liked it, i thought the noodles were too mushy)

3167880,2015-07-08,4,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"Yes, 5 friggin' stars...I love this place!

Dumpling King is a hidden gem in every sense. Nearly every time we've been here, their huge supposed to be lit sign out front is either off or broken, and the place nearly looks deserted besides a car or two in the parking lot. It probably doesn't help either, that if you're heading West on Spring Mountain, it's almost impossible to see with it being tucked behind a large plaza building. Plus, I don't see advertisements for them anywhere, and for whatever reason, the amount of reviews on this place is crazy low. It's like people just don't they are there...but why? It's so good!

Our first trip to Dumpling King was admittedly a little nerve-wrecking. Besides not having a clue where it was, or really having never heard about it at all, it was strange walking into a place that was pretty much empty of other diners, but full of bright floral designs...and Christmas decorations. Yup, Christmas decorations. Which as of now, July, are still up in subtle spots across the restaurant. But really, it's all part of the charm for me now. I like the decor, decorations and all, and the place is always clean.

The menu is large, and has plenty of things to choose from. Some things that I can't even read. Luckily we've been here a couple times with regulars who have pointed us in the right direction on what to order. I'm pretty sure we've barely even put a dent in the list of items, but now that we've been here a handful of times, there are some things I can confidently recommend.

For smaller items that you can start with while you're deciding on what to eat, order the String Beans. A large plate of fresh beans with dried peppers and tons of flavor, it's likely to be a hit with anyone who has working tastebuds. And of course, as the name would imply, they have excellent dumplings. We've tried a couple different types here, but we always seem to go back to the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings. Even my 6 year old can't get enough of these things. A little vinegar and/or chili paste just sets them off even more. How they can pack that much flavor and juice into those little things is beyond me. But, if you want to get some idea, you can watch them being hand made in a little room to the right of the kitchen. That's also where they make one of other favorites, the Vegetable Fried Noodles. Thick, handmade noodles served perfectly cooked and piled high with veggies. 

There's probably not enough room with the character limit for me to get to everything, but for larger ""main course"" type stuff, some must try dishes are the Fried Lamb w/ Cumin, and our new found item added to the favorites list, Black Pepper Beef. Both of these dishes are packed with tons of flavor, fresh and perfectly cooked meat that's piled high for plenty of sharing.

I've also had a number of items that I likely wouldn't have ordered myself, due to sheer skepticism, but ended up really liking. One of which is the Teppan Tofu, mainly because I don't normally get tofu anywhere. But it, just like pretty much everything else on their menu is packed with flavor and comes in a huge portion. The other thing I really enjoyed, but probably wouldn't have ordered was the Baked Yoked Coated Pumpkin. Don't get me wrong, I like pumpkin, but it just doesn't have a ring to it. Flavorwise though, it doesn't disappoint. It's almost like a dessert french fry, even more so because there's no way you can eat just one.

When it comes to the food, there really hasn't been a single thing at Dumpling King that I haven't liked. And if there was any negatives to this place whatsoever, it's the hit and miss service. Usually the biggest issue is getting refills here. For whatever reason, they like to take their time with getting you water. We also had a weird little interaction on our last visit, which was our 4th time here, where the main waitress (I think owner) asked if we needed forks. I mean...c'mon, I know I'm a white boy, but you've seen me here before...I know how to use some dang chop sticks lady. Well, sort of. Good enough to eat at least. 

Overall, DK is easily one of, if not my favorite restaurant in the area. Every time we come here, the food is excellent, and large groups can split tons of food that really isn't that expensive. Like I said...hidden gem, check it out!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,8,5,6pMAo1cOOzvxakTi1FPFbg

We arrived and notice that Christmas décor was up.  Wondered if DK celebrated Christmas all year round or they are just super excited for Christmas and already put up the decorations.  The restaurant's chairs were all covered with red flowered fabric.  Lots of red everywhere.  Hurts the eyes a bit.  Chairs were uncomfortable.

Onto the food:
- Beef Soup Dumplings: We thought this was ok.  We definitely had better. Couldn't really taste the soup in these medium sized dumplings.  We will pass on this next time.
-Teppan Tofu:  We had to ask for some steam rice to eat with this.  The sauce was very flavorful.  The tofu were soft inside and somewhat crispy on the outside.  I thought this was above mediocre.
-Shrimp Fried Noodle:  The hand-pulled noodle is the best hand-pulled cooked noodle I have tasted to date.  The texture and chewiness was perfect.  The shrimps were perfectly cooked as well.  I have had my share of overcooked shrimp and it can kill a dish.  Not at DK!  

We also had to order a pot of hot tea.  We did noticed that another family of 3 that came in after us was given hot tea and steam rice without having to ask for them.  *Shrug

Additionally, we had to wait 45 mins to get our noodle and tofu dish.  The lady owner did apologize for the wait since her husband had to run out to the store to buy veggies for the dish.  But, it's ok.  She was very kind and we didn't mind waiting.

Crystal dumpling (w meat) is from north China. XLB (Xiao long bao) is from Shanghai.

I'll cut straight to the good stuff. I came here with 3 friends and we shared 4 dishes: beef soup dumplings, mapo tofu, fried green beans and the beef roll. With 3 other Chinese people at the table, we were in agreement. This was definitely the best Chinese food that we've had here in Vegas so far. Now, we are medical students after all. We don't go gallivanting around the high end Strip hotel Chinese restaurants so take that into consideration. 

The beef soup dumplings were decent. I just wish they were a bit soupy-er. The bottom of the dumpling was so fragile that 8 out of 10 dumplings tore during transit to our mouths and the soup leaked out. I really enjoyed the mapo tofu and string beans. You can't get that kind of mapo tofu from the box mix they sell in stores!

3972425,2015-12-11,4,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"Sixteen of us met for an Unofficial Yelp Event (UYE).  After pushing two large round tables together, we were seated in the side room.  Each table ordered its own things but with some advice from Philip T. whose review inspired the UYE.

Our table ordered:

Beef soup dumplings
Crystal dumplings
Crispy beef
Beef patty
Cumin lamb
Beef fried rice
Dim sum dumplings

The standout dish for me was the cumin beef.  Complex flavors with good spiciness but it could have been kicked up a notch or two.  The soup dumplings were also very good and the tip of using your chopsticks to coax the dumpling onto your spoon resulted in a filled dumpling with the soup inside.  The wrapper is very thin but it's so worth the effort to get the full dumpling with it's beef filling and beef soup on the inside.

I enjoyed the crispy beef.  The beef fried rice was good as were the dim sum dumplings.  The crystal dumplings fell a little short in flavor and the beef patty--the item I suggested--was my least favorite.  I thought the bread covering the beef was too thick and the ground beef was somewhat greasy.  

As mentioned in some reviews, while they serve dumplings, there is much more on the menu than dumplings and when I go back it will be for one of those dishes than for the dumplings.

This is the kind of place you go with friends to share.  It's the only was to be able to try a number of items. Thanks to Stefany for putting the UYE together.  Good food, good Yelp company.  It doesn't get better than this.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,6,4,_D6Juq0hiapAAcEnnCjrBg
4046918,2016-07-12,1,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"We ordered the pan seared dumplings, steamed beef dumplings, beef egg and leak dumplings, beef soup dumplings and shrimp lo mein. 

We arrived around 3pm on a Saturday and we were the only ones in the restaurant - not a good sign. I'm always on the search for a great dumpling and this sadly fell short in many ways. One of the biggest disappointments were the lack of pork in any dumpling, typically a staple ingredient. I'm unsure if this is for religious reasons, but there are NO pork dumplings (or pork in any dishes for that matter).

Pan seared dumplings - I believe these were beef. They appeared to be the same as the steamed beef dumplings, just prepared a different style. I prefer pan seared over steamed because there's typically a delicious aroma that comes from it, and I prefer the bottom of the skin to be crispy. These were not seared long enough in the pan, and the skin was mildly crispy at best.  Also, the skin was too thick. The flavor was okay, but I was definitely wishing I had the pork flavor. 

Steamed beef dumplings - much like the pan seared. The skin was thick, I wasn't impressed.

Beef egg and leak dumpling - These were decent. Am I craving these and dying to come back? Definitely not. The skin was also too thick and again, NO PORK. 

Beef soup dumplings - as I broke into these I was impressed with the massive juices oozing out. When I started chewing, I was disappointed with the lack of pork again and also the mushy texture that just wasn't quite right. The taste was not bad, but these are not the typical soup dumplings that I crave and am accustomed to. 

Shrimp Lo Mein - these were fine. A little on the greasy side. The flavor was good. 

All in all, I have no desire to come back. Even with a dumpling craving, I just don't think these would satisfy me. Was it terrible? No, just not my preference. Also, bathroom hallway was not lit and extremely confusing as I couldn't see a single thing trying to find it. The waitress could not speak ANY English. Thankfully I was with someone that spoke mandarin. Maybe it was the time I went, but I just walked away unsatisfied.",4UsK-DNdFlw-TEzcdkVcgA,2,0,2,_meNYgkItQ5Em5wDMgFvaQ
4059068,2015-09-01,40,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"Its TST - Two Star Tuesday again!!!

I saw my yf Philip T's review, and I said I have to hit this dumpling place the next time I am in the Ninth Island.  However, I wish I didn't.  Dumpling King is on Spring Mountain Road, 2 miles west of the 15 in Vegas.  Spring Mountain is a mecca for good Azn food in the area.

Five of us ordered the baked yolk coated pumpkin ($9.99), salt & pepper squid ($14.99), braised eggplant ($8.99), shrimp fried rice ($8.95), green onion pancake ($6.99 x 2), juicy beef soup dumplings ($9.99 x 2), and shrimp, egg & leek dumplings ($8.99 x 2).  

First of all, the pumpkin was very unique.  It had the texture of potatoes that had been baked, but tasted like they were fried.  Nonetheless, I wouldn't order this dish again:  3 Stars.  On the other hand, the squid didn't taste like the salt & pepper versions I have had anywhere else.  Additionally, it was overpriced:  2 Stars.  In contrast to the first two dishes, the eggplant was very good.  It wasn't overcooked or drowned in oil like many places:  4 Stars. 

Fourthly, the shrimp fried rice was dry, and didn't have much shrimp or flavor.  Luckily, it didn't cost much:  2 Stars.  Fifthly, the pancake was pretty bad.  It had too much batter, although the portion was large.  It was a poor representation of a basic dish:  2 Stars.  Contrasting the previous two bad dishes, the signature beef soup dumplings were excellent as advertised.  The dumplings were super moist, and the soup was really flavorful.  Think Mama Lu's XLBs (Monterey Park, CA), w/o the tins:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the shrimp dumplings were just OK.  They really did not have a special taste:  3 Stars.

Regarding the ambiance, it was odd to say the very least.  The chairs were decorated in a bright, reddish flower motif, and there were Christmas decorations present:  Garland, poinsettia looking things and a door w/ a cover saying ""Merry Christmas"".  However, it was not garish:  3 Stars.  On the other hand the service was terrible.  We were not offered tea, and had to ask for more water & napkins.  However, when we asked the helper w/ the cross earring for the latter two items, he only brought napkins.  The nice lady (prolly an owner), who took our order couldn't make up for the $hitty service:  1 Star.  Lastly, the kitchen was rated 1 Star because the order the dishes arrived.  The rice arrived first, and the dumplings did not arrive together.  The order made no sense at all.

Sorry, Philip.  But DK was a big disappointment except for the soup dumplings.  The service was fukn horrible.  There is NFW I would return here!",o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw,44,43,2,mEb1hTkSQffVZEImtvYCbQ

How can there be a restaurant that serves food with no taste. The meat was almost mystery meat, and I actually had to stop, dig into what was on my plate to see if any of it was recognizable. 

Again, staff was awesome, he had a huge smile on his face, was attentive, and was very kind. Just a bit lost for words about the actual meal.

I ordered the soup dumplings and the fried string beans. I was hoping for them to be big portions for the amount I paid, which was $20 for two dishes. 

So the verdict: 
The dumplings were ok and hardened as soon as they started to cool down. The green beans were seasoned nicely and was a good portion but the down side was how greasy they were.

Lots of mixed reviews, but I came here determined to see for myself. I was very pleased!

Once I walked in, I was bombarded by the sight of super bright red floral chairs. There was only one other table there, so I was immediately greeted and seated at a table.  It seems like the smallest tables they have are 4 tops, which isn't bad, but sitting there on my own almost tempted me to order enough food to fill up all the space :P 

After my eyes recovered from the chair assault, I took a glance at the menu to find the Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings. It took a few minutes since the layout is a bit weird. Protip - the menu items skip numbers because the pictured items are removed from the list. 

Anyway, the soup dumplings were so good! I've seen some reviews saying some or all dumplings came broken, but I guess I was lucky, as all of mine were intact! Filling as well as broth were flavorful (nice amount of ginger). My new go to place for these! 
I ordered some green onion pancake too, just so the dumplings weren't lonely. Standard, good with soy sauce and chili oil/paste. 
Food came with a complementary pot of tea. 

Woohoo! So far so good on my soup dumpling hunt. I'm eager to see if I can find better here in Vegas, but I'll be happy to come back here until that happens.

Being the fatties with no patience that we are, the fried rice was gone by the time the dumplings came out. So sad! 
Steamed beef dumplings: Pretty disappointing for a restaurant named after them. The dumplings did not give me the juicy flavorful experience that I expected when I bit into them. 
Shrimp fried rice: If I had closed my eyes and taken a bite, I may have thought I was eating just plain white rice with carrots and peas. Give me that MSG I want my Chinese food to have more flavor. The shrimp was even more bland than the rice.

The soup was pretty good. The noodles seemed fresh made. However, the dumplings were nothing special. The steamed dumplings were over salted and fell apart too easily.

As we sat down, our waitress tended to the table next to us quickly after seating us before asking us for a drink order. Eventually... we got our water and hot tea. When I asked what was their specialties or famous plates, our waitress had some difficulty with communicating. Limited English, totally fine! However, my waitress informed my mom and I that they ONLY had beef dumplings available. A party that entered after us immediately received water and hot tea. We opted for the ""ONLY"" beef dumplings available, hot and sour soup, and another protein dish. Our dumplings were served on a cold white plate, as all the other tables around us were served in the typical steam container. Odd, right? After waiting for 20mins for some damn hot & sour soup (it wasn't very busy), we decided to pay and leave after only eating 7 sadly served dumplings. 

After speaking to the manager (owner?) - she was nice and cordial - and had gladly informed me they had several other options in dumplings. Umm what? She went on, ""the beef dumplings was probably the only quick serve dumpling readily made. All the other ones need to be made and might have taken a while."" 

Bottomline, I was provided sorry excuses for the nonavailability of food. It didn't make sense that the party after us were served dumplings in the proper tray, as well as the following parties after them (2 groups). 

It's hard to really comment on the taste of the dumplings when the service effects your entire experience. My parents have had been in culinary for 25+ years, and know when the service is sketchy or explainable for busy-ness or hassle-ness.

I was really excited to discover that we have a Northern Chinese restaurant and I'm even happier now that it's so good - I'm already planning my second visit!

Fried Lamb w/ Cumin ($14.99): Thinly-sliced lamb fried (no batter), then stir-fried with onions, cilantro, cumin seeds, and other spices. Delicious!! Fantastic flavor. I love cumin and when I first discovered that Northern Chinese cuisine utilized cumin, I was rather excited. Fabulous by itself and great with rice. Highly recommended.

Teppan Tofu ($9.99): Fried soft tofu cooked in a delicious dark sauce with minced beef and vegetables. It's served on a hot plate and stays hot throughout your meal. This was surprisingly one of the stand-out dishes! Really great flavor and the tofu was super silky. You want to eat this with rice, too.

Juicy Beef Soup Dumplings ($9.99): The serving is generous with ten large dumplings. The skin is nice and chewy with lots of soup in each dumpling. It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it's good with their chili and soy sauces available on the table. FYI: I'm not crazy about soup dumplings in general.

Shrimp Fried Noodles ($8.99): Hand-pulled noodles!! That excited me enough, but even better, they were DELICIOUS! The noodles were chewy and cooked perfectly al dente. The dish preparation was great, too. I'm definitely in noodle love. I'd eat these noodles every day, every way.

Beef Patty ($6.99): This is a deceiving name, but I honestly can't think of an English equivalent that wouldn't be equally confusing. It's called Rou Jia Mo and is more commonly described as a sandwich or burger, but not like the ones we're accustomed. The bun is a type of flatbread that is pan-fried, then filled with meat (typically stewed for hours). It actually reminds me of an arepa. It's delicious! I love the bun. I only wish they had additional filling options on the menu - the cumin lamb would be amazing!

Steamed Lamb Dumplings ($9.99): Another generous ten large dumplings filled with meat. This one had a bit of ""soup"" in them as well which was nice. Nice skin like the soup dumplings and you could really taste the lamb. Again, pretty plain in the flavor department though. Not sure I'm that crazy about their dumplings, but then again, boiled or steamed dumplings are a tough sell for me. I did like their dumpling skins.

We received one pot of rice with our dishes. I requested an additional one and we weren't informed of the extra charge ($2). Our server was very kind and pleasant, but absent during our meal. That meant no drink refills. We were finally able to get her attention after we were done for to-go containers and water.

Also, it's a Muslim restaurant, so there is NO pork on the menu. But you won't miss it with all the beef, lamb, seafood, and other meats available. There are also lots of vegetable dishes.

I absolutely love Shanghai dumplings but this place makes it with beef. I've never had beef dumplings before. They come in a order of ten I think for 10 bucks.. That's double the price of mama lus. The size of the dumplings were small. And all of us broke the thin skin and lost the juice. The trick is to pick it up with your fingers at the nipple of the dumplings ( I don't know how else to describe it lol). I also wished they served the dumplings with ginger. 

Other than that the beef burritos were really good... And the spicy fish was really good. Lots and lots of oil and bean sprouts but the fish was silky and flavorful. 

I didn't like their green onion pancake because it was so thick and chewy. It was not flaky or crispy at all.

Largely unaware of the prevalence of the Muslim religion in China, let alone its particular contributions to the country's culinary diversity, it was with great curiosity that five friends and I sat down amidst the colorful confines of Dumpling King and with friendly service paired to one of the most cleanly spaces on Spring Mountain Road the dozen plates that followed were every bit as surprising as the relative lack of praise the space has received since opening its doors nearly one year ago.

Truly a decorative space, with red florals covering each seat and several shining ornaments arranged in the foyer as well as alongside the bar, it was at one of the large turnstile tables that the group was sat and with full view afforded of each dumpling being made by hand suffice it to say that the surprisingly low priced menu is an even bigger bargain when taking into account the painstaking effort involved in each piece, a single order of ten broth-soaked beef soup dumplings taking the team of three nearly five minutes to mix, roll out, fill, and twist fourteen times before arranging to steam.

Treated to tea, as well as water that unfortunately required frequent prompting to be refilled, it was in a pair of items considered to be Northern Chinese specialties that the tasting began and with tender potatoes sliced like noodles beneath a drizzle of vinegar presented alongside richly spiced lamb mixed with shoots, onions, and peppers the opening volley traversed the palate adeptly, the light heat of dried peppers occasionally peaking through with a touch of unexpected sweetness lingering on the end.

Moving onward to the dumplings it was largely at the discretion of our server that the table placed its faith, and opting to see what could be done in a variety of fillings and styles one would be hard pressed to say which presentation was 'best' as not a single one lacked - the steamed beef ""XLB"" more meaty than most with an intensely flavorful broth while both the 'stone dumplings' amidst their golden lattice and the rich venison variant were chockablock full of flavor, the later almost as juicy as the soup dumplings with more than enough aromatic nuance to help even the most timid palates conquer their fear of game.

Personally impressed by the soft pumpkin fried beneath salty egg yolk, while others felt the flavors too mundane, it was again a 'vegetarian special' that wowed in the next round of plates and although the robust heat was an early challenge to my somewhat timid tongue subsequent bites of the Laoganma eggplant proved more and more accessible, a mild numbing effect perhaps contributing to somewhat off-putting 'oily' flavor prevalent in sizzling leek pancakes that were otherwise lightly fried and creamy beneath the exterior crunch.

Admittedly taking a chance on Peking Duck, considering the heritage of the space in which we dined, suffice it to say that neither tepid flesh nor flaccid skin was well received yet with eyes at this point glazing over from the sheer volume of delicious food it was the final plate of the afternoon that proved the most interesting of all; a pile of chopped taro boiled soft beneath a shattering lacquer of caramelized sugar that necessitated a quick bath in iced water in order to avoid severe burns, each cube harkening a creamy one-bite crème brûlée.

Undoubtedly unique, not only in its heritage but also with regard to the cleanliness and friendliness of the staff, Dumpling King is perhaps the very definition of 'hidden gem,' the dumplings themselves undoubtedly on par with the best in the city while other unique plates such as the potatoes, eggplant, pumpkin, and taro are the sort of things I've not seen since trips to Toronto and Richmond, BC.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,8,4,TX7gudD4VIWhD4j6aMkndw

Food:
+ Juicy Pork Dumplings: 10 pieces for $10. The over all taste was delicious, but it was a little disappointing because there was little to no soup in the dumpling itself :( I've been spoiled by eating the best in California, but this place isn't too shabby. Not the worst, not the best. 
+ Crystal Beef Grilled Dumplings:  10 pieces for $10. This is basically pan fried dumplings. Presentation was interesting to say the least. The taste was alright; I wish the bottoms were fried a little bit more so it would give it a night crispy crunch. 

Being called ""Dumpling King"" I assumed their dumplings would be the best/only item on their menu, but theres actually a lot of variety on their menu of other Chinese food. I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their other food as well.

The dumplings: really delicious and such a different kind of food item. The broth was flavorful and the meat inside was juicy and seasoned perfectly. 

Lamb cumin dish: it was ok but I'm not a fan of any lamb because of that weird after taste. 

Braised eggplant: I love eggplant and this was  exceptional. Very tender and covered in a sauce with a hint of a little sweetness. 

Taro dish with the sugar in top: get this dish! Save this for dessert. It's fried taro fried with some sort of sugar mixture creating kinda a caramlized coating on top. Topped with sugar strings kinda like cotton candy.

What I thought would be a leisurely solo lunch turned into an unintentional pig out.  The plan was to simply have the juicy beef soup dumplings and then be on my merry way.  But when I opened the menu, it was as if I was wearing 3D glasses because letters and pictures were popping off the page and smacking me in the face.   Venison?  Fried lamb? Braised whole fish?  How soon can friends meet me so I can try more stuff?? 

I tried to stay calm and relaxed as the nice lady came over to take my order.  My thinking was that I would come back another time with a group to try more, but then I opened my stupid fucking mouth.  ""Soup dumplings, steamed lamb dumplings and vegetable noodles, please.""
 
It was embarrassing when it all came out.  At that moment, I wished they offered study cubicle seating so people couldn't see what was in front of me.  Couldn't I just be a pig in private?  Why am I spending more than $30 on lunch today?  Customers just entering must have thought I was being rude by eating before my friends came back from the restroom.  No friends.  No sharing.  All mine.  

I even thought there would be a chance of a group outside that would strip me of my clothes upon exit and march me down Spring Mountain repeatedly saying ""Shame. Shame."" as a little bell rang and angry people threw shit at me.  It was official! Dumpling King made me go insane.

They have their own parking lot. Plus! 

But first impression is.. the place smells. It's a very pungent bathroom odor. I wouldn't mind if it smelled like cleaning supplies.. but a smelly bathroom/sewage scent is NOT the way to go when you're eating! But it's an asian restaurant. Things like this slip through the cracks all the time. We stayed. We eventually got used to it.

The menu has a lot of items! Most of the English descriptions are pretty vague. So the pictures help a lot. We got lost in all of the choices and took awhile to order.

When we did, we ordered the pan fried beef patties, the soup dumplings, and hot and sour soup. 

The patties were good. Crispy, flavorful, and tasted great with a little bit of vinegar and hot sauce.

The hot and sour soup was not as savory as other places I've had, but it was tasty as well. Full of flavor, jusy enough sour. 

The soup dumplings normally take longer and were the last to arrive at the table. Tip: normally if you know you're ordering this dish, you should put in the order first. The dumplings were good. As a personal preference, I like my dumplings more sweet than salty, but here they make it salty. Also, there is actually not that much soup in each one. 

The menu had other delicious sounding items so we'll probably be back to try other items. But they need to fix that smell!!

Juicy beef dumplings- 4 stars.  This time, the skin was too thin? The skin broke and all the juices poured out if you tried picking it up with a chopstick. The trick was to scoop it into the spoon immediately from the plate. 

Crystal dumplings- 2 stars. It looked cool, but the flavor was lacking. 

Crispy beef- 2 stars. I liked the crisp, but the flavor was a bit odd. It tasted salty, and I wasn't able to place my finger on any other flavors. 

Beef fried rice- 5 stars. Surprisingly, this dish was very good. I had low expectations, but it was nicely flavored. 

Dimsum dumplings- 4 stars. I loved the flavor of the insides. It was full of good stuff!

Beef patty- 2 stars.  I was able to taste the oil from the fry, and the flavor of the patty was okay. It was a bit bland, unless you dipped it in soy sauce.

5918878,2014-05-21,12,XlUuMGMvkzy_QLAUTEe-fw,"I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if the succulent wrappers used to encase the dumpling fillings are hand made and the dumplings are assemble and cook to order. It is a major comfort food category for me. In fact ?? boiled dumplings is the first item I have ever personally ordered on my own with lunch money my mom gave me for elementary school in Taipei. It was just a few pennies each and the shop made it and delivered it in a plastic bag to my school with my name on it just in time for lunch break.  I don't remember much about how it tasted, but the memory of having tremendous emotional satisfaction and joy from that simple meal is still very strong.

So while driving to try out a new ramen place a few miles down the street, the light from this new restaurant caught my eye, and I decided to make a quick,but very safe u-turn into the small parking lot in front of Dumpling King.  There are plenty of spaces in the back of the building, in case this restaurant gets super popular in the coming weeks. I was initially afraid that I was dropping in as the restaurant was about to close, since it was fairly empty inside, but looking at their hours of operation, I was relieved to see that I had 1.25 hours left.

I made a quick scan of the restaurant, and pretty much was blinded by all the red color in the restaurant.  Red floral printed seat covers over each chair.  The tablecloth were reddish in color, and the lighting was fairly dim, so yeah I was slightly disoriented from the color red.  I wonder if that is a normal reaction or it is just one of those minor details that made me just a little different from the other 6 odd billion people on this planet (not including the aliens that left zigzag lights over the skies of Hawaii).

Anyway, after picking a nearby table with good lighting for taking food pictures and going over the menu, I eventually found the ""dumpling"" section all the way on the last page under ""Main Food"" and ordered the following:

101. Beef Steamed Dumplings(4) ???? - Decent flavor, but I felt the texture of the filling was off. Like it was overground or overworked.

102. Beef Dumplings(4) ???? - Same filling as the above, except this dumpling is boiled.

103. Lamb Dumplings(4) ???? - Good dumpling, nice lamb flavor. Dumpling is also boiled and looks exactly like the Beef Dumpling.

112. Stone Dumplings ???? - This is like a big plate full of pot stickers that is cooked in a pan, and inverted onto the plate. The residual starchy water forms a thin crust that connects all of the dumplings together (see the picture).  It is kind of cool looking, but eat these fast.  Because I was taking time to take pictures, and all the food came more or less at the same time, I noticed that a small pool of oil puddle up on the plate after like 10 minutes, which made it taste not as good as the very first piece I had.  Just something to think about if you are dining solo or eat very slowly.

NOTE: Although their menu have prices listed for dumplings with portions of (4), I was told that it was a misprint and now the minimum order is (8) dumplings, so you now need to order those items x2.  But for the Beef and Lamb Dumplings that comes out to (8 pieces) for $5, not too bad price wise, but does present an additional hurdle against trying as much of the menu as possible without asking for the doggie bag.  They did however let me order four pieces of each of the Beef Dumplings and Lamb Dumplings, for a total of eight pieces, since both are cooked the same way.

Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.

Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.  

3.5 stars.  I am sure another update will be forth coming should I get to try the XLB on my next visit.
