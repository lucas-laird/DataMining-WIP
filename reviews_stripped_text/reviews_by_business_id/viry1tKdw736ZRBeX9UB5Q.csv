They ALWAYS greet you wig a smile. Their polite and genuine mannerism alone are something excellent to note.

Tonight was no exception. Not my usual stop, but I'm tired and hungry. I get in line and order two sandwiches, something craft, and a shake. Lady on the other end confirms my order, seems all good. The line of cars ahead of DOES NOT MOVE. It's cool, listening to good tunes but getting a little hungry. 45 minutes plus later ( with only 2 cars in front of me ) I finally reach the window. Exchange smiles, and get told that the ""shake machine"" is down, no shakes, period. Ok, how about an Iced Tea then?? No response as I'm being told the debit card I'm offering as payment will not be accepted because ""that machine is down"". No worries, I'll just pay cash. I have 2 one hundred dollar bills and a $5 dollar bill. ""We cannot take your $100"" OK, I get it, these places take $20 at most,  it this situation is not my fault. What do I do? "" Sir, go make change nearby, comeback, and we'll serve you"". I have been waiting over 45 minutes against 2 people ahead to be told I cannot pay for my meal, cannot have all of my meal, and apparently it's my fault. I tell the nice teller at the window to skip it and I'm leaving and she tells me that I owe because I ordered, and that I f I do not find some way to break the $100 bill I will be I trouble.

After she read it and realized she was incorrect, she stated that they were always the last to find out.  When it came to the time for the manager to process the payment on, she was very curt and rude. Even though there was no added cost, she said that she couldn't promo something with a substitution. She would do it this time only. That's fine. I will visit this McDonald's, this time only.

Me? I like their food toys.  The Minions are the coolest things lately, and they just crack me up! I just had to add them to my other cool collectibles, the ""transforming"" Mickey D's food toys...remember those?

Like I said , I've been to other McDonald's and for some reason it's only this location that gives me the food poisoning. What strikes my attention is the service I get when I do the best I can to give off a polite vibe when ordering but after it took quite some time for my order to come through the drive thru, it seems that the lady didn't have a nice day. Considering me being bluntly clear with my words and how I pronounce them, asking ""hi sorry can I get extra jelly?"" ... I   Couldn't seem to grasp how rude you can possibly say the word ""what?"".... until now.

This is actually the only place I have EVER written a corporation about for bad service.  I won't ever be going back there. Rather drive down to Jack n the Box on Craig.

""I'm very sorry sir let me fix your order and give you a free apple pie"". Something like this would of went a long way but instead I got attitude. They need to realize! It was 20 minutes of my day they wasted so I could go back to McDonald's for them to get my order right.

My work site with less than a quarter of a mile from this McDonald's and there is no reason for the nuggets to be that cold that quick. I did try several of them and all of them tasted as it had been sitting out for a while and were not fresh. I ended up throwing out all of the food that I lost my appetite due to the taste of the nugget.
