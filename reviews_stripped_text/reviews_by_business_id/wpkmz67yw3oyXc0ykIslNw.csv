You can feel that the place is run by real Thai people and you're gonna get real Thai food.  The decor of the dining room is slightly indicative of what you might actually find in Thailand.  Not so romantic, but legit.  

Food was tasty, we got Green Curry and Pineapple Fried Rice.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is hard to find, it's the kind cooked with curry powder.  The staff was kind, gentle, and almost shy, but more than happy to attend to any requests.

I love coming here. The staff is always really friendly and even starting remembering me after only a couple visits, which is pretty nice. They're also really accommodating. I came here for my graduation dinner in '13 for 8+ people and I called ahead to see if they would stay open one hour later than their initial closing time and they were more than accommodating.

I kind of liked the inside, there were only a few tables and nothing fancy, but welcoming. We were pleasantly surprised by the inexpensive menu (dinner for two was $15.00), we got a really delicious soup to start off, that came with our meal. 

I ordered Rad na, which is my favorite Thai dish, I liked it because the portion was large and the noodles had less of a burned flavor than any other restaurant. My husband had Kung Pao Chicken, his portion was a bit small, but well worth the $6.95. I know we will be back, I am already thinking of having that yummy soup again, which was perfect for a cold winter night.",lxxdEXtCQ0y6pa2G_uV00w,1,0,5,8h4l-7UkQ__cLJvyr9czjg

Nope, it ain't fancy, but the service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious! 

I've been many times now, and have never been disappointed. From Pad Thai, to several different curries, Beautifully flavored Tom Kah soup, and Thai Spicy Basil - it's all good. 

My only criticism is that the fried tofu always seems a bit watery and kinda bland. It would be much better if they pressed some water out of it before frying. Still. Not bad.

The biggest surprise was when I asked for sticky rice with mango -and was disappointed to find that it was out of season. The server suggested instead the black sticky rice with shredded coconut.

I was leery. Black sticky rice?? No mango?
It was fantastic!!! I may just order it as my meal next time.

I decided on Thai food and this spot was super close to home and didnt have any bad reviews, so it seemed like it would be worth a try.  When you come in the smell of the bread from Subway is definitely notable, but I got used to it pretty quickly.  The place looks neat and clean, not an ideal room for sit down dining but they make it work.  I was kind of worried that the food would be terribly bland and generic but in the end was satisfied.  The waitress was friendly and the food was better than I had expected.  My gf isnt an adventurous sort, so she had chicken pad thai and she liked that.  I got the Dang Dee Salad, chopped iceberg with mint and cilantro and I'm pretty sure it had ground chicken, calamari, and some shrimp that had a kind of ceviche thing going on.  I was pretty impressed with how good it was for costing under $9, even if a part of me worries any time I get seafood at a lower price than I expect.

2621868,2011-02-21,0,wpkmz67yw3oyXc0ykIslNw,"Shout out to C F. for mentioning this spot in a Talk thread.  A friend and I went today, and it wasn't bad at all!  We ordered the green curry with beef ($7.95), and the pad see ""lew"" with chicken ($6.95).  I also indulged in a Thai iced tea ($2.00), which was a nice balance of sweetness and creaminess.  

While not the best I have had, I really liked the green curry.  At a spice level of 4/5, and with a little bit of added chili powder, it had a nice strong flavor with no sweetness.  I wouldn't say that the character of curry itself was all that unique or interesting, but it was a nice, liquidy strong one.  With the added ingredients of zucchini and egg plant (which was very yummy), and very tender beef, I found myself going back for seconds!

The pad see lew (like ew?) wasn't my favorite, but it was still good.  It was a bit sweeter and saucier (perhaps too much teriyaki) than I prefer.  It had sliced carrots, American and Chinese broccoli, cabbage, and even a single piece of bok choy  I wished there was more bok choy though.  All of the meat and veggies were fresh and nicely prepared.  Although definitely edible, I prefer a drier version of this dish, so I wouldn't order this one again.  

I can safely give this spot a 3 star review, but it may be better than that.  The lunch menu is pretty small, so we ordered off of the dinner menu.  It was a pretty simple, standard Thai menu, nothing that was really stood out from other places that I noticed.

My bf and I were seated immediately in a booth, but weren't approached until about ten minutes later. There seemed to be only one server in the house juggling four tables, also doubling as the one handling phone orders. Poor girl. So yes, lunch service was rather slow. 

If you can't read good, you're in luck for once -- picture menus! This is also convenient for Thai food newbies, visual learners, and maybe babies. All lunch specials are $6.95 and include soup.

My pad thai with tofu was generous and made with skinnier noodles than what I'm used to, but that was fine. It tasted a little sweeter than anticipated, but still good.

1.  Service - If you come at lunch, there are plenty of business lunch people coming here, so it is very crowded. In addition, it seems that really there is one main server with others helping a bit, so it can get busy. Nice, friendly, economical.

2.  Food - The price here are extremely reasonable, which is probably why there are so many people coming here. Many of the entree are 5.95 - 8.95 and it is basically full meal on one plate.  Spice levels are very reasonable, so if you like it with a kick, order up a notch or two on the spice level, as the food is not too spicy.

I ordered Massaman Curry, one of my favorite.  Now, normally, I am aware that Massaman curry is traditionally served with beef, however, the waitress asked if I wanted chicken and I said yeah sure.  The chicken was cube cut and a bit thick as well as a bit tough. I find if it is sliced thin and against the grain, it makes for a much better texture and flavor, rather than cube cut.  Not too sure if many asian style restaurants cut in cube style anyway..... 

My fried ordered the Spicy Eggplant with pork and she liked it.

All orders come with soup, some kind of basic Tom Yum style soup. 

3.  To try - I always compare restaurants with either the Spicy Eggplant with ground beef, or the Pad Kee Mau (Drunken Noodle)   So I plan to come back for this.

The place is very, very casual, family oriented, and overall pleasant.

Came here for lunch on a Sunday. The staff were all sitting at a booth when my party of four came walking through the door. The place is dead quiet and a bit unnerving, because how busy a restaurant is usually indicates how delicious the food is. It is a good thing that I went against this initial theory because Dang Dee is fantastic for the price. Their lunch specials run around five to six dollars for an entree with choice of chicken, beef, or tofu. If you want shrimp, add two dollars.

We decided to dine family style and ordered the red chicken curry, spicy basil beef, spicy tofu eggplant, and chicken pad thai. All of our food was ordered at a spicy level of four out of five. When the food came, it looked and smelled amazing. When we tasted it, it was flavorful and just was wonderful on the palate. The red curry is filled with bamboo shoots, zucchini, tofu, and chunks of white meat chicken in a robust coconut base. The beautiful pieces of eggplants were a vibrant purple, soaked up the garlic well, and was complimented by the soft tofu. Two people in our party do not like tofu and still enjoyed this dish. The pad thai was delicious, but pretty standard. The basil beef possessed a delicate smell and was just as flavorful. The only problem with any of these dishes were that they are not spicy at all. I am not sure if they were holding back because we were a primarily Caucasian party, but it seriously tasted like a one. After doctoring up the dishes with the tiny pickled green chilies, it was more like what we had expected. We ended our dining experience with the mango and sticky rice. The glutenous rice with sesame seeds was soft and soaked up all the delicious coconut milk. The mangoes were rip and sweet. It was a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. For $4.50, it was worth every penny.

The aromatics, flavor, and portions are all spot on. The only thing they need to work on is presenting a dish that meets the spice level that Thai food should possess.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,2,4,YLqfY7UlUhkgG1Rd21hxHg

The yellow curry with beef was outstanding! The pad kee mow had great flavor but was a little on the hot side for ""medium spicy."" The tom kha soup was very good as well.

The only mistake was leaving out the white rice to go with the curry. I'd ordered brown rice as a side and she may have misunderstood thinking I wanted it for the curry so not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.

All in all we were very happy and we will be returning.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,1,4,EbxWejyQosvsjxWNvKaBag

Cant think of anything that could make this place more awesome. Been here twice now and the first time after our meal, they gave us some super fresh, delicious orange slices, 2nd time I came, they gave us chilled watermelon slices with ice on top. Perfect palate cleansers after the spicy (if you want it that way) Thai food! YUM!
