I had two toddlers with me and it was the perfect place for some wholesome fun.  We enjoyed vegetarian curry and mango lassi from India Palace and later had mango and pistachio ice cream.  It was delicious!  It was really well organized and unbelievably fun.  I love that even though it was raining, everyone remained in good spirits.  They turned up the music and danced under the tents while we waited for the rain to subside.  The location was perfect for my kids to run and dance around to the music.  I think my kids had the most fun they have ever had.  They came home practicing their Bollywood moves.   

It was a well organized event that I will definitely attend again.  I only wish it happened more than once a year.",-UKLwyd_VsGy1R05Qe_Fug,3,1,5,W03HyT67X-T2sRFFDaxyZA

We had fun shopping the lovely wares.  Bought several lovely ""jeweled"" textiles.  There was a very talented young girl who was a Henna artist.  She had done beautiful plates, artwork, candle holders etc. of exceptional artistry and loveliness.  This was called Suhenna Creations.  Not only that, but I had accidentally left my IPAD Mini at this booth and since I did not have my name or number on it, I despaired of ever seeing it again as I was not sure where I had lost it.  Luckily I emailed the organizers of this event and not only did they have it, but they so kindly returned it to me at my home.  This was so amazing and kind and reflects the caliber of this event.  I would highly recommend this festival for a fantastic taste of India.  A great time was had by all.",cTmFa2YPh0R-PH4-UokOrg,1,1,5,7opGaz9b0ZsBVVCS-_1e5w

Just try the local restaurants and save your money",6aJ_WRWa3C3o0A3EXYyEmw,4,0,1,jilF8C_ceTPresUzDqOBbA

After a hike, two of us drove to the Clark County Government Center Amphitheater in downtown Las Vegas.  There was plenty of parking when we arrived.  At this festival, you purchase cards in different denominations to be paid to buy food or merchandise.  There was a table at each end of the food vendor area that sold the cards.  I got $20 worth which came as one $10 card, one $5 card, and five $1 cards.  The vendors give you change in cards so all money is handled in one area.

My friend and I first walked along to look at all the food offerings.  The vendors are under the canopy opposite the performing stage at the amphitheater.  The first set you come to were all food vendors and the second set were all clothing, jewelry, and assorted services such as tarot readings and henna tattoos.  

After our walk, we headed back to the food vendors.  We started with splitting an order of chicken momos that came with a tomato based dipping sauce that had some nice spice to it.  That, along with some mango lassi, made for a good appetizer.

The amphitheater has a large grassy area but we set up our lawn chairs under some trees for shade.  After meeting another person, we went back and got some more lunch.  I got an order of pani puri that was something I'd never tried before and it was very good and very filling.  It was explained to me that this was Indian fast food.

Before we left, we watched some of the Raas competition.  We weren't close to the stage but it was better to stay out of the full sun and watch from our seats.

I later learned that the Vaisakhi festival is a traditional Sikh spring harvest festival.  I am certainly a fan of the festival and I'll be back next year.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,12,4,SDlLiATXHOuJRuVnGwM8-w

The Indian Viasakhi Mala Festival had 5-6 local Indian restaurants selling lots of yummy food, there was vendors doing henna tattoos, demonstrating how to tie a turban, and had jewelry and clothes for sale. The entertainment was absolutely beautiful and the event coordinators did a great job. There was local and out of town performers singing and dancing, decked out in traditional Indian dress. 
I highly recommend next year attending the festival, it was a great outing for our family. And there's tikka masala, so, you know it's a good thing.",njUgJcn8ZN0BdZdNEswRwA,4,1,5,-QK37qBlTiu3_xsWND_w6Q

I got a ticket two-fer on livingsocial and came with my buddy, Yelper Melissa G. It's at the amphitheter so there is limited park bench style seating, but plenty of grass so bring a blanket for the grass or some fold up chairs. It was busy, but not overly crowded that you can't find space or wait more than 5 minutes at a busier booth. 

The way they do the food is you don't hand them money, but little money value cards. I prepaid for these coupons when I got my tickets, and you can purchase  more inside too. They told me I can buy whatever value I needed, so I looked at the menu to see the offerings at each stall and cost and started off with $20 since that was gonna cover more than a few dishes. The most expensive was $10 for full plates, while street food style offerings were $3-6. I included pictures of this years menu to give folks a idea.

This is what we got to try - 

Melissas first pick was a Masala Dosa (made by Mint). I havent had one in a while and it was solid as far as dosas go. I grabbed a buffet plate from India Palace which gave you rice, naan and 3 dishes: I got some chicken makhani, veggie korma and saag paneer. I liked their saag paneer and so did Melissa. I thought the makhani and korma were solid. 

We got up and went to try more things. Melissa got Aloo Tikki Chana and from the same booth I got Rabri Mal Poora which was made by Origin India. Hers was aright but I've had better. I liked the Rabri dessert which is like a fried dough soaked in syrup topped with a creamy sauce.

Then we went to go get some lassi which was also Mint Indian. She got mango and really liked it. I got ""spiced buttermilk"" which made me think it'll be spices like how the desserts are and it sounded good...but it was a bit savory/spicy/salty and was more like drinking a yogurt sauce. 

After I went to exhaust some of my left over tickets and got a chaat papri which was made by India Palace. I thought it was filling and refreshing. Then I went back and got a strawberry lassi because my savory one wasnt doing it for me. 

We watched some performances but it started to rain and we took cover under some trees for a while and decided to go which came in good time as then it started to pour down on us like crazy. 

There were non food items too. Plenty of jewelry accessories, clothing and lots of scarves and sashes all in beautiful Indian textile array, but I didn't really peruse heavily so I cant comment on prices.

Overall I had fun. It was a ""low pressure"" festival. No crazy long lines and pretty organized made for no frustration moments.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,6,4,XOGlg6u5z9yyQSlAxkRmdA
5120396,2015-04-26,0,tcclqqE4T8XbgS-02vsl6A,"I had such an amazing time at this festival,I invited several friends to go with me which made the event even more fun for me. The entrance fee is very cheap $5. The event was very organized over all. You purchased meal tickets instead of giving the vendors cash, I liked that. Each station had a number and we were given a program that listed where to get each meal and there was also a picture of each entree. The performances were scheduled and we had a list of each group. The hosts of the program were excellent. They explained what was going on in english as well as punjabi. A special shout out to the white guy in the accapella group that was singing in Punjabi-we were very impressed. All the performances were excellent. The food and drink were also very good the lasi and the aloo tiki were amazing. This was a great event. The weather was perfect until 4pm, it started to pour. When I left they were still performing, dedication. Ill be back next year, im looking forward to it!!",J-eSXIpp0wdZ4N7pwV7k1w,0,4,5,oD_VeLnIQo_zA3fYOPL0zw

I never got use to one thing in India though, and that is you have to always get on people vocally to get what you want, including being a little pushy about asking for more food from the vendors.  Being American and Asian, we don't always like to do that. So the portions are very disappointing, unless you go for the $10 buffet. Most of the photos posted on here are misleading, they make the food and drinks look bigger than life. If we were in India, we would be spending half of what we're paying in price for the same amount of food at this event - which is still very authentic in quality BTW. It is more of a ""taste test"" to sample all of the restaurants in town.",Xk1r6viTRdsURLRWIFdQ6Q,3,1,4,hpqS1Oges0n4Oh3cx-iVWw
