Very friendly staff.
 
Perfect place to get together with friends for wine tasting or sit at the bar and watch sports. Looks like it will be a great spot to watch Rebel games.",MnDpS5jNtwi_HTSY2fMbPg,0,1,4,Vk6G4iRWUwsMWv6QCxk60Q

A friend of mines bought a groupon online so we decided to hit up CR buns and see what they are all about. 

We walked in at about 630 pm and there were only 2 people in the entire restaurant. the bartender doubled as our waiter. Another yelper described this place is a cover for drug smuggling, and i couldn't agree more. Here is what we ordered... 

Spinach dip/ chips - I'd rate this a 2 out of 5; it tasted like the spinach was frozen, and some of the chips were chewy. 

Chicken wings - 2.5 out of 5, the wings were comparable to the frozen wings that you can buy at any grocery store and throw in the microwave. 

BBQ Bacon cheeseburger 2 out of 5, just a plain burger i enjoy McDonald's more. 

PS. my glass smelled like old Xmas decorations 

I don't think that we'll be going back :(",hpl28Esq-r-VUuG1zZhwcw,3,1,2,jIDBkGaZjw7W-YW-XoLrZg
826677,2010-07-10,10,O5Z9pd-aqjp6A1K6w0dXSw,Hope this is a cover for drug smuggling cause if they are seriously trying to make money they are screwed.  Dont usually care about decor but the identity crisis (is it a beach bar or an awful attempt at contemporary?) and most uncomfortable bar stool ever had me out the door before I ordered a beer.  I couldn't fathom paying $7 for a glass of wine no way anyone there is making sure it is properly stored. Bar food is not a joke! This place is.,gOzKE83ig1tYp4-l6Fs2Mg,9,0,1,hEKNAt6Sh8jeqM3XHwDpXw

Rich chatted us up while we were there, he was one of the funniest, most attentive bar owners I have ever met.  I will definitely go back and my family absolutely enjoyed the experience.  Would be a great place to go with some girlfriends for a wine tasting or with a crowd to watch a football game.",P5Htoj1g65ANv7r3Wjv_Ig,1,0,4,B9TI568vmVijGHzgu3IlIw

Call me an optimist, I tried it again a few weeks ago, but when the bottom of a dish is served smeared with mustard it means they didn't bother to wash the plate, just wiped it off. Wow, I am seriously disgusted now and won't go back. I want to do something, call some agency, but not sure who.

Please read my first review for details. Also, and I have never said this, click on the ""Filtered"" reviews, put in the code word, and read all of it. There are reviews there that absolutely do not deserve to be filtered.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,1,0,1,OZ_TRj_nhfEHBiA_BBBrPQ

back 9 over at Callaway) he has started with a pretty aggressive wine area. I am gonna have to try and eat my way through the menu before 
I give a more concise review.",zn2jJvhshrv0jAP3Kiy_HA,2,1,4,WP8WNaXzv3b8TOoNbUgElg

Everything was made cheaply. I'm always looking for a bargin especially now with the high gas prices and all but c'mon this place may price things cheaply but you pay for it in taste. I wouldn't even spend my last $5.00 here....
I had the Spicy Barbecue Chicken Sandwich-Not Spicy by any means and 6 onion rings, really?
The BF had a cheeseburger which was so boring and it came with 5 onion rings, really?
The Bartender is also your waiter so if he's talking to someone at the bar good luck wanting a refill on your drink. The BF had to get up twice -once to get a drink refill and another time to get the bill. The concept inside is really off, kinda weird!!! The menu also had pizza on it so my daughter ordered it and then the waiter said they no longer sell pizza and infront of us took his pen and crossed it out on the menu. I was just totally turned off by this place, Oh and if you're wondering-NO, I won't be back!!!!",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,7,1,2,0pyumkp-sfx_rpzgNlxLGg

So we stopped in since it is a matter of blocks from our house, It was late and we only ordered 2 appetizers to share and they were both spot on... tasty food, fast service and very friendly atmosphere. I have heard great things about this place already so I will for sure be checking this place out a little more in depth soon.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,0,0,4,OlopGALz2HCs8dTDPUi2SQ

5974751,2011-02-04,1,O5Z9pd-aqjp6A1K6w0dXSw,Weird place to say the least.  Half of the place is nice wine tasting look and the other half is california beach look.  Menu is the same with hot dogs and burgers for $4.00 then lobster tails.  Slow service but ok for what you are paying if you want a cheap meal.,cItw_D7yU_rCTktKM7ytVw,1,0,2,9NEpcmdEajy7PfDfoiPfQw
