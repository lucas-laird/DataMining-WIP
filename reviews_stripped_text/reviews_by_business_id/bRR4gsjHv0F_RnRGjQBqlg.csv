All I can say is this place is essentially average. I've been to hundreds of ice places in the Country and this place just doesn't stack up.

I tried both strawberry and chocolate. The strawberry tasted as if you melted a Dole strawberry popsicle down, you'd pretty much get the same taste. Chocolate was as if you melted down a Marinos brand Italian ice from the supermarket.

Many east coast natives that live in Vegas I spoke to about this place told me to stay away if I wanted authentic, but I gave in.

The 2nd star is for the owner; guy seems super nice and made the place very welcoming.",XOaI9R06TfnIrrgB1GtKIQ,4,1,2,bdUWL6S6nyPTaong0SOtIw

97649,2012-07-22,0,bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg,"I stumbled upon this place on the way home, and what a find it was! I've only had Italian gelato before, so I was not exactly sure how much of a difference was Italian Ice and custard, but the ladies behind the counter were more than willing to help give a clear explanation to me when they found out it was my first time here. 

Their menu doesn't seem very... crazily unique at a glance. They have their Italian ices (which are similar to sorbets) and custards (more egg-based than ice cream from what I hear?) in different flavors, the Concretes (which are like a Dairy Queen Blizzard), and then you have the gelatis. It's basically a cup with custard on the bottom, Italian ice, and some more custard on the top. I didn't know what else to get at the time, so I decided to get that. Took my first bite, and wow not bad at all. I was actually impressed!

The only complaint I can make, especially with their gelatis, is that at times it can be a little too sweet once you eat more of your gelati, and this is even coming from someone who has a slightly higher sweet tolerance than most people (so that's really telling you something)! I had a gelati with vanilla custard and a peaches and cream Italian Ice and at times I really did find myself liking the Italian ice a LOT more than the custard itself, which was sad because a good portion of the gelati was custard. 

Sadly, I don't think I would want to get another gelati very soon. It was good for my first time, but a little too much and a little too sweet for someone like me. But their Italian ices are quite delish! Would definitely recommend for any one of those hot Vegas summer days.",t4gHn7m2Op9S6yAN6cCDew,1,1,4,tMmB-PXsJ1ex0E_mUXHPvw

Black cherry and chocolate ices are solid but I went with my favorite standby, root beer, which always tastes perfect when topped with custard. Here, they pack the cup with ice then top it with a tower of custard- a bit too much for my preferences, but good value at under $5 for a regular which was three servings for me.

I prefer a smaller ratio of custard to my ice, but the custard here (vanilla) also had a weird metallic aftertaste that I wasn't fond of. Not sure if it's specific to the vanilla, something to do with the ice-and-custard flavors playing off of on another, or perhaps an issue with the machinery, but I'll be by to try again.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,3,3,XEJOl7InDp6aubUk9mSreQ

I can eat a large amount of custard without feeling overly full. I am told that it is an egg based custard. Of course it still has dairy, but this custard has a bit more protein and fewer calories than the norm.

We walked into this place and it was virtually empty. We took a look around and saw what their product consisted of and I didn't want to really order anything. Seriously - neon coloured ices - is this for real?

I tried some of the gelati flavours that were begrudgingly offered  by the girl behind the counter. Automatically, I knew that the flavours came from a flavour lab somewhere because it certainly did not taste at all like anything that came from an actual fruit. Hell, the colours don't even look like something that came from anything known to man. Neon blue raspberry... what the f&^k is this? Ugh!

So my hubby gave me a look and asked me what we wanted to do. I shrugged. He basically ordered the strawberry concrete and we were on the way. 

FYI - I am an ice cream hound and will pretty much eat any kind of crap ice cream out there. Even the old dixie cups hold their own allure for me which I must confess is a guilty pleasure.

But I couldn't have more than 1 bite of the custard because of how artificially sickeningly weird it tasted. It got way worse because as it was melting, it morphed  into this pale pink foamy stuff that resembled a cold runny marshmallow-y concoction which was obviously nothing dairy in origin. Hell, don't know what it was made of but it sure has hell ain't natural!

We have loved CJ's custard for two years now, and wanted to treat our friends from out of town to a tried-and-true treat.  Little did we know that we were in store for some truly FRIGID customer service...

When we walked in, the two girls on staff were occupied with two friends of theirs who were visiting.  This was fine, as we still needed some time to decide.  We asked to try the banana custard, to which one of the girls replied, ""Yeah"" and stood there, looking as if it would drop from the sky.  ""So, may I try it?"" we had to ask again, before she huffed and served us a sample.  

We decided to buy two quarts to take home, as we were now embarrassed to have brought our guests to enjoy the concentrated angst of two teenagers.

I brought the two quarts up to the counter for purchase, and the second staff member did an excellent job of running the transaction, until the point came at which she turned around and began to organize toppings, never having given me a receipt nor a bag with which to carry home the dessert.  I waited for a couple of minutes, until our friend finally asked, ""May we please have a receipt and a bag?""  The girl turned around as if she was surprised to see us there.

While CJ's quality has brought us back many times, I will be skipping this new brand of customer service and simply purchase it from Glazier's instead.  ""Meh"" service tells me that they have a ""meh"" view of customer loyalty.",rpol6Ly2kVtApQRSkXR2rg,0,0,3,fGWirGLwcP3cuDSxrAM95w

Did that stop Pat?  Nope.  Pat needed dessert...so as I was driving down Durango, I saw two words ""Ice"" and ""Custard"".

So I pulled over and decided to check out the place on Yelp, and up pops a message from Yelp. ""Congratulations, you get 10% off"".  Word??  That, coupled with the fact that the reviews were excellent - is all a brotha needed to know.

I told the young lady (cute, too) that I was in town for the week for my 50th Birthday and she was like ""yeah, right..you're not 50"".  I was like, ""do you need to see ID?""  She just chuckled and then glared at me.  So I pulled out my AARP card and said, ""do I get an AARP discount here?"" and she was like ""OMG...well no...but I'll see what I can do for you"".

Showed up around 11:30 AM on Dec. 18th, not realizing that they don't open until noon.

There were a few people sitting inside so we walked up to the door and looked around, wondering why the doors were still locked.  I guess they were having a company meeting of sort since everyone there were store employees.

I guess the owner must have felt bad for us so he decided to open the door and told us that it was ok to come in.  That was so kind of him!

I ordered the same thing from before, the cheesecake custard, on a waffle cone this time.  It was delicious!  I shared it with my little angel and she loved it too!

What can I say?  I've lived in this ""small town"" that thinks it's a big city since 06' having been born and raised on the east coast in Philadelphia.  One of my FAVORITE childhood memories is Pop's Water Ice in South Philly.  It was staple for me every weekend visiting my dad - back then we only had lemon, cherry, chocolate and vanilla (brown).  

For the past six years - I've missed water ice dearly especially when it's hot outside. I was SOOOO happy when I tried this place that we come back at least once or twice a week.

The owner and staff are personable, friendly and provide great customer service.  
The flavors are great and not overly sweet as compared to places like Rita's where your ice turns into a watery syrupy mess.   

I'm still partial to my chocolate ice but I've tried just about every flavor they make and now that they're making my all time favorite mint chocolate chip cream ice - you can't get any better.

Prices won't break they bank and loyalty cards to boot.  

EVERYONE should try CJ's oh and I'm not normally a custard girl but the custard is great as well.

Side note:  Was reading some of the other reviews - I've never had bad service in this place so perhaps you guys/gal went in with a bad attitude? We've always been treated with a smile from day 1. Mmmmmmmm - I love pink Amoxicillin - it was my childhood favorite.  I'll have to be sure to try the watermelon ASAP.",Zemr8otoe_xhutAI62rWqQ,7,4,5,HukTXvcEBZmiA7HHfDsrtg

3167839,2012-09-02,0,bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg,"I'm definitely no expert when it comes to ice or custard but something just doesn't quite work right here. Being a huge fan of Rita's, my review is probably a little biased but I'll be as honest as possible.

First off, the customer service here is pretty much non-existent. As we walked in, we looked across the menu for a few minutes and one of the employee's said ""First time?"" but nothing more. Even after telling her yes and that we were unfamiliar with the menu, she didn't offer any help, samples, suggestions or even say anything at all. We were also never offered the ""punch card"" I've read about either. 

Now, as far as the product goes it was ""ok"". I've been to Rita's a number of times and absolutely love the gelati so that's what I got here at CJ's. In my opinion, it just doesn't compare. The ice has an extremely ""artificial"" taste and I had the cherry ice which tasted like sno cone syrup. The custard was definitely creamy and the flavor wasn't bad but it had a very strong egg taste which threw me off. We also frequent Luv-It and the custard was no where near their offering. All in all it wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't great. Neither the custard or ice had natural taste or flavor that you can get at several other places in town.

I'm on the edge about giving this place 3 stars cause there was a few things that I really did like about this place. The first thing was the amount of custard flavors they offer. There are ton of choices but one huge downfall is they don't allow you to use the flavored custard in a gelati. In terms of the gelati itself, one other thing that really stood out was the amount of custard they use. If you've ever been to Rita's you know that they use a very small amount of custard for the bottom section of the gelati but at CJ's, the custard to ice ratio is just right. And the last thing that I enjoyed was the amount of seating available. I hate to do it but I'm going to make another comparison to Rita's because they only have 1 bench and it sucks having to eat outside on the curb especially when you have a fairly large group. On the other hand, it's understandable considering the space they have to work with. 

I'm not a fan of making comparisons but when there are other places in town that offer the exact product with a much higher quality (in my opinion), it's hard not too. Having the Yelp ""$5 for $10"" was a nice way to try CJ's but I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. The slightly further drive to Luv-It or Rita's is well worth it.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,0,2,rpqElqsxxxjoNIRtpdqcMQ

Their frozen custard here has a gooey texture, and becomes creamy once a spoonful meets your mouth. Savor worthy. Then add more gooey chewy mochi. Your set with an awesome dessert moment. Why would you need to kiss an exotic hunk? When you can just have Italian frozen custard with mochi. You get Italian and tongue action in a dessert!

Try the pistachio nut! I ordered it with vanilla, but next time I won't - cuz the pistachio has a really nice flavor. I wish they had nutella or hazelnut frozen custard, and espresso flavor. That woulda been a cup of a lifetime, and then repeat...

They were out of cookie crunch topping. I looked around, but there were no kids to point fingers at and blame it on. That's how I ended up getting mochi.

So this place is cool! There's a wall - all freezer doors with grab and go pints or bigger tubs. Plus more on the right side when you walk in. I didn't get to see or ask if they make frozen custard cakes. That would be awesome! Next time I'll check.

They want customers to come back! I know cuz the young lady helping me looked at me like I have 'sweet tooth' stamped on my forehead. I got a staaamp caaard - nanny nanny...

Went to check out this place with Pratik W. a few days ago cause it was in the neighborhood. We had living social deal, which is pretty the same thing as the Yelp! deal they have now.

Walking in, the place was totally empty. Considering it was effing hot outside, I thought the place would be packed. I came in and told them that we had a living social deal and the two girls working there explained in long detail all the different stuff they had. Concretes seemed the same as any other custard place. The gellati from what it seemed like was just soft serve with a slurpee like frozen ice underneath. Unfortunately, according to the two working there, the our living social deal could really only get us a standard soft-serve custard (from the machines you pretty much see everywhere) or a gellati. We ended up going with some soft-serve. I was thinking about getting some mix-ins but each one was a dollar and was not under the deal... 

We were served large tubs of the soft serve. I was disappointed in the fact that there was so actual gelato here. The custard was good, a step-above what you get a dairy queen, but it wasn't even close to Luv-It's frozen custard. I would have been happier with some golden swirl.

I couldn't help but laugh at the big cup of what is essentially soft-serve frozen yogurt we had. Realizing that I had  $10 credit, each one of our cups would have been $5 bucks each w/o the deal. Don't get me wrong, the 'custard' tasted good, but it was definitely wasn't 5 bucks good...

The serving was huge and to be honest, I got tired of eating it. We ended up dumping about a third of our cups and headed out. The whole experience was ""meh"" I might return and get a concrete, but then again part of me figures that if I am gonna spend $6-7 on ice cream, id rather go to golden swirl or Luv-It.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,5,4,2,98o5LyRVcMSjb-im4pFxzg

If you're not familiar with their offerings, it might take you a minute to figure out what to get. Here's the lowdown...

They've got plenty of flavors of Italian ice in three sizes (small, regular, large). My kid got a chocolate Italian ice that had a lighter and more ""icey"" texture than sorbet. The small size was plenty for him. He barely made a dent in it and took the rest home.

They have chocolate and vanilla custard and you can add different flavors to them for $0.65. The piña colada flavor is excellent.

Also available are Concretes -- vanilla or chocolate custard with items that you can mix-in. I opted for the vanilla and cheesecake bits. A regular size was $4.25. They mix it similar to a Blizzard at DQ to make a smooth and creamy product.

Their final option is a gelati. You select your size (regular or large), an ice flavor, and vanilla or chocolate custard to create a layered cup of deliciousness.

The service was friendly and informative. They were glad to answer any questions and explain the menu. No doubt it's a family friendly place that I'm sure to visit plenty of times this summer.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,4,wuYV2n-uQyHRmLi83EhFtg

I found out that all the flavors of custard are made by flavoring vanilla custard with what you choose.  I opted for black raspberry.  It turned out that was one of the flavors ""on tap"" last night.  I went with that.  She asked me if I wanted any toppings.  I asked if they had any fruit.  She checked the cooler and showed me a container of fresh black raspberries.  That was fine with me so she added several raspberries to finish off the delight.

I went here because I like Rita's iron the east coast, and they're basically the exact same place. I got gelati's at Rita's which is basically Italian ice sandwiched by what they call ""custard"" which is basically a very rich delicious soft serve. 

When going to CJs, I was hoping for the same delicious custard, and man did they deliver! However, I got a gelati, and the Italian ice was good but not great. 

My girlfriend did the right thing... She got what they call a ""concrete"" which is just custard and you can mix things in, basically an upgraded McFlurry! She got vanilla with caramel and Oreo pieces mixed in... And it was to die for!

Also they have pints in the refrigerator with UNBELIEVABLE flavors! At between like 6-8 dollars for the pint (or was it quart?), it actually would have made more sense for us to get the unbelievable flavored custards and just split it.

It's close by so I decided to go with my bf to check the place out. I had a difficult time deciding what to get since there were so many choices. Italian ice, gelati, concrete, custards, malts and milkshakes, pretzels, etc! And they have a large variety of flavors. I went ahead and got myself a gelati (mango ice + vanilla custard) and he got a banana custard (weird, I know). The custard was so creamy and silky smooth. I was glad that the Italian ice actually tasted like the flavor that it says it was cuz it may easily become too sugary and artificial tasting - but it wasn't, so that's good. 

*been here a couple more times after

And I'll admit that some of their Italian ice flavors can be a little disappointing, but 8/10 of the flavors I've taste-tested were spot on so not a total fail.

It was a hot day so Italian ice was a good refreshing choice.  I got the red/white/blue flavor...don't remember the name but it reminds me of those Firecracker popsicles...yeah you know what I'm talking about.  

They also have concretes...which to me seem like McFlurry's...just a bunch of toppings you can mix into a thicker custard and eat with a spoon.  You can also get a root beer/Coke float made with their custard. 

Indoor and outdoor seating.  It's nice to sit outside if it's not too hot and if the umbrellas are up.

This place is okay.  Not somewhere I would go out of my way to eat at.  But it is a nice treat on a hot day!

Salted Caramel Custard with Sea Salt Caramel Truffles
Chocolate Cake - Chocolate Custard, Dark Flakes, White Icing, Chocolate Sauce

Passed countless times by those unaware - no glitz, glamour or Public Relations team to sell the concept - CJ's Italian Ice and Custard has nonetheless made a name for itself throughout the years by providing frozen treats to in-the-know Westsiders, and although offered at several local outlets including Glazier's Food Market the smart money seems to be going straight to the source for more than fifty flavors of Ice and Custard.

Family owned and operated, a Midwestern upbringing and education at The Ohio State University imparting Jon Goldberg with a familiarity of both styles of frozen treats, CJ's Italian Ice and Custard inhabits a small storefront attached to a Taco shop at 3555 South Durango Drive and with three-to-four varieties of the latter served via soft-serve machines plus a dozen blends of milk, water, eggs, sugar and flavorings offered via scoop from the freezer case the only question is how best to mix them, or whether to taste them on their own.

Baking the waffle cones in house while also packing several to-go options including pints, dipped Bananas and frozen Custard cakes, a first visit to CJ's can admittedly be quit daunting given the sheer variety of offerings, but with a quick tasting of available flavors a decision becomes somewhat easier, the only menu-option unavailable during this visit being the rolled Waffle Cone ""Custard Cannoli.""

No doubt excelling in customer service, the two young women professional and helpful beyond their years, it was with samples of the classic Lemon and Black Cherry Ice - plus the Bomb-Popesque ""Captain America"" - that an order was selected, the ices to wait for another time as the daily special of Salted Caramel Custard was far too compelling.

Making every flavor in-house, the slightly melted texture of Ice lighter than that of Gelato or Ice Cream, CJ's Custard sets high marks by way of a base that comes across far more creamy than that at Luv-It without out being quite as thick as those at Shake Shack, the flavors carried forth robustly by way of the high fat content while the addition of small Caramels dipped in Dark Chocolate were one of nearly four-dozen possible additions offered in a generous portion for just an extra $0.50.

A bit disappointed that the smallest take-out containers of Custard are far too much for a single serving, the small cups of ice more appropriate though really not as pertinent since more flavors are available in-house, part two of the order instead focused on a ""large slice"" of Chocolate Cake, $5.50 netting a soft cocoa base topped in Custard blended with Icing, the texture almost like that of a Semifreddo with the top further coated in Chocolate Sauce and shaved Chocolate flakes.

****Limiting themselves by not offering more Custards-to-go at a reasonable price, and inexplicably sold out of a menu item just past 1pm, CJ's Italian Ice and Custard nonetheless represents an under-discussed family-owned business worthy of Las Vegas' patronage, the friendly service and good prices well-matched to options varied enough to suit any taste.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,4,igZsB1NdjL5PzGq325o3tA

5320623,2012-07-18,0,bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg,"The Italian ice and custards are delicious. My favorite is the custards simply because it taste like heaven in a cup. Just imagine the custards being like ice cream and served the same way if you were to get it out of the ice cream machine. However, instead of having the soft consistency of ice cream, the custards will be slightly thicker and richer. The custards here are extremely creamy with an aftertaste of the eggs they use to make it.. add the various flavorings and you have buttery goodness of all sorts (best way to describe it is like eating chilled butter in a cup.. that's how deliciously rich it is) 

Everyone has a favorite flavor so I'm not going to go into details on how each specific one taste. CJ's has over 30 different flavors and combinations you can mix and match from but I find that the standard vanilla and chocolate taste the best. You can watch them make it when you order and you'll notice that they actually use the vanilla custard as a base to add flavorings and mix to get your desired flavor. The standard custard  flavors itself is well balanced when it comes to sweetness, but in my opinion, the more uncommon flavors such as apple pie, etc is overly sweet and bluntly generic tasting. So keep that in mind when you order unusual flavors.. Just because they have it listed on the menu doesn't always mean it should be made... IMO, strawberry is the best one they have.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,0,0,4,5OBInlSfDKAPx-8UM0rDDQ

5470983,2013-04-15,0,bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg,"Gah! I crave the brownie sundae everyday since I tried this place!
The custard is really good- so creamy! The ice is pretty good too, but I have nothing to base it off of- and some of the flavors I have tried haven't been that great. But anyways, the custard is really good, and so is the ice (if you find a flavor you like). They have a ton of flavors you can get for your custard- what they do is use the vanilla base, and mix in some flavor. My favorite is the coconut custard, on top of the hot brownie sundae! AH! SO GOOD!
The brownie sundae consists of: one hot brownie (frozen, then microwaved) with three swirls of custard (depending on the person you get, you can get three different flavors of custard) and each swirl is topped with their own sauce- peanut butter, marshmellow creme, and chocolate (you can change any of those to something else if you want) and finally whipped cream. This is by far my favorite thing here!
I've tried three ices: coconut, cotton candy, and marshmellow creme- all were really good, but I advise that you try the flavor first before getting it, you might not like it (example, they have a Laffy Taffy Watermelon flavor that I thought I would like, tried it, and it does NOT taste like Laffy Taffy anything, or watermelon).
My boyfriend gets the custard cannoli- it's a waffle cone in the shape of a cannoli shell, stuffed with custard, and topped with your choice of sauce and whipped cream. He was told that the only flavors of custard you could get with this is vanilla or chocolate, but they advertise one with blue custard...so I guess if you ask, and depending on the person you have there, you might be able to get a flavored custard.
This place really does depend on the person you get to help you. Sometimes they make your item wrong, and sometimes they do not stamp your card, or even give you a card (hit five and you get a free item!) so that sucks.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,2,1,4,f_ffBAqPPUxCuVxmx-PrxA

We also ordered a concrete, in which you have you pick of flavor for the custard, then whatever toppings you wanted mixed in. There are additional charges for more toppings. We tried the vanilla to go along with peanut butter cups. I thought it tasted pretty good -- similar to a Blizzard from DQ.

The inside is small, so not much room to sit if there are already some hot and sweaty old (and young) people sitting.

I got the butterscotch custard and my husband got the kahlua custard. We both had them regular size on one of the chocolate/vanilla dipped cones. What a total disappointment. Both of ours just tasted like vanilla. Maybe we should have asked the girls to add more flavoring to them but we didn't want to be assholes and have them remake them. So not only was the custard less than pleasing, the chocolate/vanilla dipped part was just awful. I thought at least if the custard wasn't amazing I could at least enjoy the cone and boy was I wrong. 

We both agreed we should have gone to mcdonalds next door to get their cones. Our custards were definitely not worth the $10 we spent. 

I'm thinking we should have gone with the Italian ice instead? Seems like that's what a lot of people like here. 

Don't see myself coming here again.",H71E4WfO5YMY9Ev67mabyQ,0,0,1,EP2teL0DjvjJ60oLy2SrCA

5954453,2014-06-16,2,bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg,I love this place. The italian ice is so smooth and tasty. There are so many different flavors to try. My favorite is the custard. It's so creamy. I like spending a few minutes deciding which custard and italian ice combination to use for my gelati. They also have Quarts of gelati in the freezer with combinations already to help you out too. Overall a good summer treat for any age.,ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,4,4,5,qJC9KxwbF86j-9x-WX-3nQ

5996375,2017-04-30,0,bRR4gsjHv0F_RnRGjQBqlg,I was craving ice cream and this place was on the way to my destination so decided I'd try something new rather than the McDonald's ice cream or dairy queen I usually buy when I'm craving ice cream. They have various selections ranging from custards to different flavored ice creams. I tried the concrete and added Heath bar as my topping. It was really good and they were not stingy with the Heath bar serving.,P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,w6DQRMxdqypw73qcJ4hmwA
