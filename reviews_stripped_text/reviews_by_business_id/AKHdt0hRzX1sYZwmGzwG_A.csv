Yes it is not cheep, and they run out of things when there is more demand than anticipated.  You do want them to stay in business and pay their employees, right?

Their bagels are brought in from somewhere in a big bag, and they are pretty standard bagels, nothing special.  The Turkey Club sandwich toasted is yummy, but not healthy.  The ham croissant has a brie style soft cheese and is pretty tasty too.  The muffaletta is too salty for my taste, but if you like muffaletta, as my husband does, go for it!

Hard Rock Hotel replaced Starbuck's with the Fuel Cafe. Hours later when I needed a serious caffeine boost, I tried a Fuel Cafe ice blended coffee.

  After a few sips, I missed Starbuck's. The nicest way that I could put it is that the $6 and change ice blended coffee is worth a $1. I passed over drinking it all. The taste was especially bitter and there was too much air in the cup. It tasted like putting a cup of cold Folger's coffee in a blender. If it was reasonably priced I still would pass over purchasing it in the future. Fuel Cafe's high prices are testimony that Starbuck's is not the highest price coffee shop.

She took our order and went straight to making our drinks.  She was by herself.  We got our drinks pretty quickly.  Took us about 5-10 minutes.  My ice black tea was good,not sweet as I requested so I'm happy about that.  The one thing I didn't like about this visit was she didn't wash her hands after she used the register and sneezed then make our drinks.  It's gross.

We had our coffee and tea, then my friend texted me to get her a coffee too.  We went back in to order another drink, this time there were 3 other people in front of us.  It took a while for us to place an order because it's only one person working.  Then we see another girl walk in from some where else carrying a bunch of items and sat those down on the counter behind the bar.  She went straight into making the drinks on the bar.  Once again, this barista didn't wash her hands either before touching food and beverage items.  This last visit took about 15-20 minutes for latte.

Staffs need to wash their hands after touching themselves and doing anything else before serving customers!!!  This is a place where germs are spread like crazy!!",MMxRLgkd-MgwowmggmR2Dg,2,0,2,bsNd2NNzYC6D-FdJ9V6_kg

I'm surprised by all of the 1 star reviews because when we went, service was great, coffee tasted fine/woke me up, and my chef salad was filling and surprisingly good. Yes, my salad was a tad over-priced, but if you're coming to Vegas looking for a deal, you might want to pack your own food then. I could have gone somewhere else for a snack, but because of the convenient location to where I was headed, Fuel Cafe hit the spot.",qS3vXc7nirB28WzYyVvRBQ,3,1,4,lp2CNBWO_HWVxWBRnmGYXg

I only went to 2 stars as the food selection is decent, comparable to Starbucks.

0 stars for customer service. 

Chai was surprisingly good. Huh. Thanks barista man who made it ! You're  a super star !

Customer service: We were on break from the conference & decided to get some chai. Had 3-4 people and after I named all of the drink orders cashier said they need to see ID with debit/credit cards. 
Ugh fine - but maybe put up a sign !! She said she will get the drinks started so it will be ready when I get back. 
Walked all the way back and stood at the register for a bit - there were 4 more customers at that point that had not ordered yet - she rang me up and we waited. Everyone got their drinks before we did - including those that hadn't ordered yet when she was swiping my card. They also forgot some guys tea. So 
A. They didn't start it like she stated they would
B. They forgot about us and made Drinks for 8 or so people before making ours. 

And here's the most annoyingly part - guy in his wheelchair spills his coffee on his hand and on the ground in the middle of the cafe. They didn't close the lid right enough so as he was putting his cup into the holder the lid just slipped off * good job guys !!! 
He tells the barista folks and no one goes to wipe it up - mind you its in the middle of the floor = safety hazard. So guy in the wheelchair starts wiping the floor - you""d think they would stop him and clean it's up ? Nope.",CC6nA5P5Y0Pg_CuXRNLgmQ,1,0,2,DPZjAsx2llQQopK6YxoDiQ
