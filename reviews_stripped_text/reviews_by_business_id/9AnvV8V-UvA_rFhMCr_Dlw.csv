Finally, last Saturday 12/2, we rsvp'd on the 'Mint' website for dinner.  We dressed up, drove  from Summerlin and headed over to Mint. Upon arrival we were greeted with a sign at the door indicating 'the restaurant was closed for a private event."" This was so disappointing and we felt terribly inconvenienced as the Mint website didn't indicate they were closed.  It won't be anytime soon that we make the effort to return.",1gIG8Nkk4Tp22oFFsoz6uw,1,0,1,Z3jm1HIzLdFz8PB1DtMPjQ

Very nice interior, open and comfy. My husband and I tried the Chef's Tasting Menu as we have only eaten Indian food a few times (although I make a mean Tikka Masala at home).

The vegetable pakoda was amazing appetizer. Favorites from the tasting menu were: tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and tandoori chicken w/ yogurt. Their garlic naan bread is fantastic, definately needed a second order!

Oh, and they also have an inferno menu featuring ghost chili peppers. All I can say is YUMMY!

So as to not ruin my entire palate for the evening, I just ordered the Inferno Naan stuffed with paneer cheese. If you like heat, you will love this bread! Definately has alot of heat, but not debilitatingly hot. 

And a self-service beer and wine bar? How can you go wrong with that!

Been back a second time already with out-of-town guests, they really liked it too.
Definately making this a regular for our dinners out!",YPMamd8-MFTV3ExZoS5dtA,2,0,5,eC1FdoTIHYfQ1S21531WNQ

My mistake was that when I paid the bill, I did not realize that 18% gratuity was automatically added for four people. I left an additional $20 but that is my price for not paying attention. When I paid, the bill was presented to me with the portion to add the tip which is what I did. It wasn't until I got home and looked closely at the itemized bill that I noticed.

Delicious food. Excellent ambiance. Great selection of liquor. 

I was confused by the lassi bar, since lassi is a yogurt drink, but the wall had beer bottles displayed.

1352452,2018-04-11,1,9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw,"Came to this location for the first time since dining at the East Flamingo location a few years ago. Benefits of this new location is that its super close to home and has a good amount of parking. Never been to this plaza before besides donating at Salvation Army haha ! 

We were sat at a table almost immediately upon arrival. The restaurant was mildly busy during the dinner time with a few occupied tables around. The layout of the restaurant is fairly open with booths lining the side and tables in the middle. There are more tables in the back corner but it seems like the area is closed off and maybe used during lunch time when they have the lunch buffet. 

Since its been quite a while since I've had indian food, I resorted to asking the waiter on recommendations. Otherwise, the only few things I knew was like mango lassi, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and naan. Lol 

Mango Lassi - Lassi's are a cold, homemade yogurt or organic soy yogurt drink blended w/ choice of sugar, salt, or fresh mango pulp. wait sugar or salt? wt... how would that taste D: I don't think im curious enough to try it... BUT ANYWAY ! Mango lassi was nice and sweet. Very creamy and thick. Difficult to drink using a straw at first. Wish it was colder though. Would have been more satisfying. But still yummy nonetheless

Garlic Naan Makhani - I had wanted garlic naan, and this appetizer was recommended because it comes with a side of makhani sauce (butter chicken curry sauce w/o the chicken... haha) - Suggested to get this and a side of some more naan to share. Always been a fan of butter chicken so this is a good way to get the sauce. Kind of pricey for 1 naan cut to strips and 2 small cups of sauce but at least garlic naan itself is not bad, in terms of price, so you can finish off the sauce. 

The below 3 curries were ordered at a 7-8. Probably at about the same level as an 8 or so at Thai restaurants. Waiter had asked us what we ordered at Thai, and we said 10. So he suggested about 7. Maybe next time, we can up it a notch. Hope I didn't get this wrong, but iirc, he explained how North Indian cuisine is more creamy vs South Indian cuisine is more spicy. 

Saffron Cauliflower curry

Unfortunately, I think the saffron didn't come out that well in comparison to a seafood dish like a Spanish paella. The curry flavor was strong. Cauliflower was cooked well and not over cooked and soft. 

Mahakali Mango Marsala - Mango chunks cooked in an onion & fennel-seed base to create a sweet and spicy sensation revival to Maharaja Tikka Masala. 

Probably my favorite of the 3 curries. I'd never imagined a mango curry but this was really yummy. Mild sweetness from mango combined with the spice from the spices used. Yum yum ! !

Andhra Curry - a South Indian Specialty spicy curry flavored w/ coconut milk and spices from the state of Andhra Pradesh. 

Spiciest of the 3 but only by a little amount. Flavor is more strong in comparison but still delicious. Topped with a full piece of star anise, there are pods of star anise in the curry as well. Take caution ! 

All these curries were yummy with the complimentary rice or if you have any leftover naan, 

Seekh Lamb Kabob - Ground lamb spiced w/ mint and garam marsala baked on a skewer in a special clay oven (tandoori oven) 

Flavorful meat ""rolls"" served in a sizzling plate with onions and other veggies. Very minimal, if any, gamey flavor. My mom, who usually is pretty sensitive to gaminess said there wasn't much either. Flavorful, as said previously, but mildly dry. Was ordered by recommendation. We originally wanted the lamb chops, but opt'ed for this to try something new. 

Tandoori Chicken - Marinated over 24 hours in Chef's famous marinade then baked to perfection in special clay oven (tandoori oven) served sizzling

Juicy, tender pieces of chicken on the bone served on a sizzling plate with onions and other veggies. Preferred over the Seekh Kabob. I mean, how can you go wrong with tandoori chicken tho?

Overall. Great meal. Family loved it. We'd all return again for the same if not different stuff. They've been bugging me for quite a while to try indian and now they love it ! Maybe will try the lunch buffet some day too !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,1,4,Jde1z-Io9W9U4mlBwEdAgA

1420417,2017-03-03,16,9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw,"Mint's new west side location is doing things right: with a buffet for lunch and a la carte and demo dinner options for evening, there's a lot more going on here than your typical Indian restaurant! 

BUFFET: Lunch buffet is solid, at $15 and several options including fresh garlic naan and multiple food stations. Their curries and kabob items are some of my favorites, but I always get the saag paneer if I see it. I like how this location has more appetizer type items than other buffets, rather than just several rice and curry dishes. Speaking of rice, their biryani is pretty bomb, too. Come hungry!

DINNER: They recently previewed a new Indo-Chinese menu with fusion items. You can reserve seating to be by the kabob or naan station for dinner and watch the cooks up close and personal. This menu is a la carte, dinner only, and very well executed. Favorites include the Drums of Heaven (chicken lollipops), Hariyali Paneer (SO GOOD!), and Spicy Chili Baby Corn (which doesn't even taste like corn!). Interacting with the chefs and watching the dishes be made makes for entertainment while you wait, and everything smells so good- you really work up an appetite!

Food quality is solid, service is attentive, and the new location is so nice! Bonus points for having several vegetarian dishes, and some available vegan.

Since I haven't had Indian food in such a long time, I had my friend recommend me some dishes. I ordered the buttered chicken masala and garlic naan bread, which was very delicious! Especially dipping that naan bread in the masala! I ordered a spice level of 6 but it wasn't too spicy, so maybe next time I'll keep that in mind and go up to a 7 or 8 spice. The wrong order came out for mine an the server took care of it quickly and gave me the correct order which I really appreciated. At the end of our meal, we all ordered lassi togo! All my friends ordered the mango lassi and I decided to try to rose lassi. The rose flavor wasn't too strong, it almost just tasted like plain yogurt, but I didn't mind! I tried the mango which is what I'll probably be ordering next time. But be aware, the lassi is extremely filling! That's why my friend recommended to order it last and take it togo so that we didn't get full in the middle of our meal.

I told him I would like Korma with no meat, add paneer. ""We can't do that. We can do chicken."", he replied. I proceeded to repeat myself and stated again that I don't eat meat and asked why they can't add paneer. ""We don't do that sir. The chicken korma is good though"". Again, I repeated myself ""I DO NOT EAT MEAT. Are you not listening to me""? He proceeded to raise his voice and tell me how they cannot add some cubes of paneer to some curry. I asked why not, he gave no valid reason reason outside of ""we cannot do that"". I asked for the manager so I could get this worked out, because I've never been to any Indian place that couldn't do that, in fact most places have the option right on the menu.

It's a Tuesday night so not as busy and we got seated right away. Seems like there were two servers and two bus boys. Our orders were taken and we ordered out food. Seems like people were waiting a long time for their food. 
Tried the regular samosa chaat( good) and stir fried lamb( asked for 10, the spiciest but when it came it it was rather a 3 at max) waiter said since its appetizer the sauce will not be too hot; I've had it much spicier at the East location. Oh well who cares it was still good. 
I ordered the Masala paper dosa and it came out first before our other food so I had to wait and not be rude and eat. Well when the dosa came out, it was not crispy around the corners and was rather soggy. Didn't enjoy it at all. 
Naan was good/ so was butter chicken. 
Overall being that it's new, I wasn't disappointed but not impressed either. I could have driven a few more mins and had what I always had at the east location. Oh well. Hope with time, the chef gets the food right so we can come back again.",kemyWOuq1vnG9XdzHb7cAg,1,0,3,s8B3MgGNwESsj7g0zDrMRg

The location has a fun, somewhat modern feel to it. Really enjoyable to look at and catches your eye. They also have a by-the-ounce self-serve beer and wine tap. We didn't try it out, but it looks like a cool concept. Mint seems to get busier around 8, so you may want a reservation if you have a bigger party.

2945773,2017-05-29,0,9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw,"While pulling into the open parking lot, the area around Mint Indian Bistro was clean, spacious, and well maintained. The restaurant was lit up and easy to see from multiple angles of the streets. The parking lot was quiet, and other businesses around were winding down for the day while the restaurants nearby were opening back up for dinner. I found shaded parking in front of the building, and walked into the restaurant at around 5:30 pm on a Friday night. 

Upon entering Mint Indian Bistro, I was greeted in a timely manor by an employee of how many people were in my party. I was dining alone, and they offered me a comfortable booth in the corner of the restaurant. The atmosphere was open spaced, modern décor, and had a Buddha theme with black and silver colors complimenting the cultural murals on the wall. The establishment had a lounge area, buffet area, bar top, and a private dining area. Only one other table had been present since the restaurant opened at 5:00 pm for dinner. 

The music playing was upbeat, easygoing, and had an ethnic techno genre. Very fitting for the restaurant, and set the mood for the Indian inspired atmosphere. The aroma of the ingredients in curry, coconut, exotic spices, and chili pepper flowed through the restaurant. The overall atmosphere was very welcoming, enticing, friendly, and gave you a sense that you were in a fine Indian cuisine establishment. The server was very tentative, and helped assist in the perfect dishes to explore. The server suggested the popular pakoda with fresh vegetables as an appetizer, and chicken tikka masala as an entrée.

Starting with the popular pakoda appetizer, the sight was alluring with the colors on the plate. The appetizer was a fried dish, with two different sauces on the side. The pakoda was light brown colored, grainy, curdled, and asymmetrical. One of the sauces was a mint, deep green, and the other was honey colored brown sauce. The mint green sauce was creamy, pureed, and brightly colored. The brown sauce was translucent, dull, and had a glossy appearance. The aroma of the pakoda was mild, and the sauces had a sweet and sour contrast to them. The aroma of green sauce was minty, with hints of cilantro. The other brown sauce had aromas of tamarind and honey. 

Biting into the pakoda was mild, nutty, and slightly sweet. The flavor was mild until dipping into the sauces, which enhanced the experience. The sauces made the dish memorable, and paired well with the fried vegetable appetizer. The texture of the pakoda was semi solid, crumbly, moist, and smooth. The dish was served warm, slightly oily, and was fibrous. The balance was soft when chewing, and very savory with the paired sauces. Highly recommended. 

The chicken tikka masala came in a silver bowl with a side of white rice. The tikka masala was brightly colored red/orange, and had a creamy curry like appearance. The aroma was a combination of coconut, onion, garlic, and hints of chili and ginger. The dish was strong tasting with the exotic ingredients, and very flavorful over the white rice. The chicken tikka masala was slightly salty, sharp, and very savory. The texture was semi solid, lumpy, moist, mushy and very creamy. The dish was served hot, smooth texture, liquid like, and was had a melting sensation once it hit your tongue. Very complimenting balance of ingredients, flavors, textures, and overall experience. The combination of the two dishes truly gave the essence of Indian culture and cuisine with fresh ingredients, prompt service, and expert knowledge on the dishes.",quCMwQ3RHdFGcBj_2ySg7A,1,0,5,eka-EEqRlMh4ZCUH-7moUg

Place is impressive, nice decor and friendly service.  Food however was on a spice scale of 1, more like an introduction to Indian foods and flavors.  I like a 5 or 6 on the heat level and nothing on offer was even close.  Some dishes with chicken were only lukewarm so I skipped them.

I especially love my Indian food, after having lived in New Delhi for three years. 
I love lassi drinks, and tonight I was happy to have such choices: virgin lassi and lassi with either vodka or rum.
The black currant lassi was fantastic!
We started with some of the most wonderful samosas, with two sauces which were delightful.
We enjoyed saag palak with lamb, Thukta noodle soup with lamb, naan makhani, rogan josh, chicken masala, garlic naan, gulab jamun and rasmali for dessert.
we were greeted by Julie who was very helpful with our questions about the dishes. She was superb and made our evening delightful.

Went again two more times and service did not improve.

3966546,2016-12-25,11,9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw,"I was here during their soft opening for the lunch buffet about a month ago.  I came back tonight for dinner.  The food was very pleasing.  The service was off which resulted in me removing a star from my earlier review.

The food was excellent!  The Andhra curry with chicken was beautifully spiced.  I got it at a spice level of 7 on a 1-10 scale.  I could have done eight or nine.  There was some kick but I like it spicier, not inferno, but reasonably spicy for normal people.  The samosas were good with good ground lamb and the basmati rice was well prepared.  The garlic naan rounded out a nice meal along with the gulab jamun for dessert.

Now to the service.  When I arrived, there were two tables besides me occupied.  There were perhaps four people covering the floor.  One man took by order for the samosas while I looked at the menu trying to decide on the main course.  He also asked for my drink order.  I asked for iced tea and he responded with sweet or unsweetened.  Unsweetened it was and he brought me a small dish with some regular sugar and several artificial sweetener packs.  Shortly into eating the samosas, when my tea wasn't even down a third, a server asked if I wanted a tea refill.  I responded with a not right now.

I finished the samosas, the curry, and my gulab jamun before someone picked up the empty glass--it had been for much of my meal by then--and brought it back full.  I added a packet of sweetener and then tasted this awful flavor because they had brought the sweetened tea which now had artificial sweetener also in it.  It tasted like raspberry tea but I only took a swallow or two and then left the rest.

There was a woman going around with a tablet taking orders from tables which are then instantly sent to the kitchen.  She seemed to be the key employee tonight.  When I was brought my bill, I saw that there was a large error.  The gulab jamun was charged at $80.  (I did not post the photo of that bill but I have it).  The person who brought the check went after the tablet carrier who then was occupied with a party of 4 at the ""self serve"" by the ounce wine and beer area.  I can see why it can't be completely self serve.  I have friends who would drink them dry unless monitored.  This, however, held up the redoing of the bill.

The service seemed like there was no coordination nor clear cut responsibilities.  No dirty dishes were removed from the table except for the samosa one.  All my dishes from the main course were on the table when the gulab jamun was brought.  I lifted my dinner plate to make room and placed it to the left and away from the eating area.  The person who brought the gulab then picked up that plate and took it but nothing else was ever cleared from the table while I was there.   It's been a month so they have had time to train the staff and the staff has had time to do their jobs.  This won't keep me from coming back because the food is so good but service people, you need to get your acts together.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,22,18,4,4bdBH1LqbnXpaoIaKU0hIQ

We arrived at downtown location and there was 45 min wait, so we ended up at their Durango Dr location 25 mins away, we were seated promptly but after about 5 mins asked to move to a different table. 
Waitress took drinks order for half of our table but never came back to take rest of the order. 
A different waiter kept coming back wanting to take our menu books away from our table. I told him twice: ""we haven't ordered yet"" but he was bent upon taking the menus. 
They got our drink orders wrong. Brought out more lassis than we had ordered (and insisted that we had ordered that number) and didn't bring a beer one in our party had ordered. 
Not much choice when it comes to drinks and the ones they have in menu, apparently they don't stock for. 
I ordered the Thandai vodka lassi, they told me they ran out. 
I ordered the Piraat IPA. ""Sorry, we don't have it either"". I then ordered the Bornem double Abbey Ale, waiter laughs and has the nerve to say: ""you keep ordering beers we don't have"" 
Seriously? I'm sorry!! But all these drinks are right here on your menu.. 
Needless to say, he never came back to take my drink order again. A third waiter stooped by after a while to get the menus. I ordered the boulder beer mojo IPA: same story: don't have it. (Fourth time) 
I finally gave up and asked the waiter to get me an IPA they have. 
A very elaborate menu. Salty lassi contained at least twice the amount of salt it should. The first in my lifetime That I hated salty lassi. 
Lychee rum Lassi: was so sweet it tasted like cough syrup. 
Raw papadum: they serves us raw papadum, absolutely disgusting... chewy. 
72minutes after we were seated, our food finally arrived! 
Kids ordered idlis: were pretty decent. Dal Makhni was good, the methi malai chicken was very good, baingan bhartha was unremarkable and malai kofta was excessively sweet. 
Bottomline: don't waste your time and money in this restaurant. Horrible service, disgusting drinks. Entrees are decent, (hence 3 stars) but for the wait and the money, I'd pick a place that is actually nice..",HGIsF1lGIRPtDY-0VBdN0w,0,0,3,_6SQFIEWPpG3PyhzgZPzZA

I was advised to try their buffet lunch because I was not very familiar with a lot of Indian Dishes. This way, I get to try all of it and maybe order it at a later time if I decide to visit them during dinner hours (not buffet). Ok, onto review,

Ambiance: pretty interior, clean, impressive buffet station. Didn't get to take pics because I was really focusing on what dish is good. Haha. 

Food: Good Selection for the price. Nan is freshly baked and delivered to your table at your flavor of liking. Dosa is also freshly made all part of the buffet. I tried almost every single dish, amongst my favorite is goat curry, chicken tikka masala and tandoori. Everything is pretty good but mostly vegetable based with delish Indian spices. I guess that's why their price is $15. Children are half price. Everything in their end is pretty spicy to me and they offered to make, chicken breast kabob with cashew nuts and cream in a sizzling plate for my dd. She loves that with mango chutney on the side.

Staff: is pretty attentive for refills and delivery of nan bread. Someone comes to our table frequently to change plates and ask us if we need anything. I think the owner or the manager is he one who offered the dish for my daughter. 

Price for buffet lunch is reasonable, a little pricey for ala carte menu. 

Will definitely return for a lunch date with my hubs when my daughter is in school. There's not much for kids to eat because dishes are mostly above medium spice unless you are willing to pay more for the ala carte menu.(cost is more than 1 lunch buffet)

I enjoyed this place today. I'm glad I chose it for Mother's day!",zSRfNmiUrS1oPFJP4rqbfA,0,0,4,9JO0L6ZkmdN8QFGUwcv3Rg

I ordered the chana masala and the chicken vindaloo with, of course, garlic naan! The chana masala is a great vegan/vegetarian option. Even if you are not vegan/vegetarian, you will definitely enjoy it. It is full of flavor and has the right amount of kick to it (I ordered spicy level 4). The vindaloo was also very tasty. It has a slight vinegary flavor, in my opinion, but it is delicious nonetheless. 

Out of all the Indian restaurants in town, I would recommend Mint because their service was exceptional and the establishment is very clean. Other places might have decent food, but their restaurant is not always in tip top condition, which can kind of bring your appetite down. Overall, Mint has all of the aspects I look for in a great restaurant. Must try!",9FT7TtB8S4u1PwjkZmizkw,3,2,5,aWMQgfYQNHxmtsKM5XB3iw
4484438,2017-01-15,5,9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw,"Have I ever told you that Indian food is my absolute favorite?  Okay, so I'll tell you again.  I've been eating Indian food since before many of you Yelpersnappers were ever born.  When I moved from Brooklyn to Queens, I was fortunate to be living a stone's throw from Jackson Heights, which was then cradle of Indian restaurants on the East Coast. It still may be.

But I moved from there to Central NJ, and all those restaurants must have heeded me and Horace Greeley, and moved west.  They all went to Edison, which became known as Little Bombay (or Mumbai, if you're a purist).  But there were - and are - also a plethora of Gujurati vegetarian joints, as well as tons of places from almost every Indian state. They've been moving west again, and now we have a growing Indian food scene here in Vegas.

Mint Indian Bistro on Durango is one of the newest, and it's a cavernous room, half of which is filled with tables and booths, the other dedicated to a bar and lounge, with a unique Lassi Self-Serve wine and beer station in the center.

We chose a table far from the door, but we were freezing.  Our obliging waiter, Jay, raised the thermostat, but that only seemed to be blowing cold air.  Turns out that our table was next to the somewhat separated buffet station area, and that must have had its own thermostat turned way down, because we got even colder.  We moved to a raised booth, and I was finally able to settle in and take my jacket off.  Even better, the booth was the right height and very comfortable.  I usually can't sit in them, since I'm too short for most and would have to eat like a dog, straight outta the bowl, and the tables are most often too far away from the seat.  This one was perfect.

No other reviews seem to be complaining, but I found the wine and beer prices over the top.  I won't pay $10 for a glass of Riesling, even if it's from Germany, unless I'm on the Strip and dying of thirst.  I've had too many good German ones at other places for a lot less.  So I had a small bottle of bubbly, and I was happy.

We like it when there's a Thali, especially when it's a new restaurant for us, because we get to sample more than a few items.  Here it's called a Prix-Fixe menu (for two), under the heading of Chef's Tasting Menu which, I guess, gives license to let them charge more!  But it is definitely a Thali, and we chose the non-Vegetarian option.  To be fair, it was somewhat different from the usual, in that we were served individual bowls of soup and individual desserts.

We started with the tomato soup, very flavorful with lots of cumin seeds to crunch on.  It seemed insanely oversalted, but I'm hoping that instead of salt it was from lemon.  It's easy to confuse the two in certain dishes.  The soup was served along with the appetizer, which we were able to change from pakoda to samosa.  The potato and pea filling was delicious, but I found the outside to be not as crisp as at other places, with a kind of different, softer texture.

The main course was accompanied by a separate small bowl of rice.  Rice was also one of the bowls on the tray.  The individual dishes were very good (lamb, vegetable curry, dal,) to excellent - tandoori chicken that had an unusually great smoky taste, and chicken tikka masala.  We didn't like the mixed pickles, but that doesn't mean they weren't good, they're just not our thing.  Yogurt instead of raita was a disappointment, but not as disappointing as the garlic naan.  It wasn't piping hot, which it should be, didn't have enough garlic, and desperately need some butter - it had none.

Much as we like gulab jamun, we chose kheer for dessert, since it's not as cloyingly sweet.  It was terrific.

Service was generally good.  While Jay seemed to be the primary waiter, everyone else pitched in.  But the problem was that when we, or any other table, weren't being served, the staff seemed to hang out in the kitchen.  So when we needed, e.g., spoons for the dal or yogurt, since none were provided, we had to wait, and wait some more, until someone decided to come into the dining room.

This venue has been open a month.  They will have wi-fi, but don't yet.  The food is mostly very good, and I hope the owner will check out all the previous comments, as well as my own, and work out the kinks.  We liked it and will come back, but it's not my favorite.  That could easily change.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,10,5,4,nh08qoIkpPzR-F1C780GuA

My BBF and I tried their lunch buffet ($14.99pp) and we both felt that it was just okay. A couple things that influenced our decision was the selection and the overall spiciness. I understand their spiciness is appropriate (according to a friend from India), however, it was a bit too spicy for us to enjoy. That was disappointing since it affected dishes that we are normally able to eat.

I was really sad they didn't have Chicken Makhani or Samosa. I don't always find Makhani, so that wouldn't have been a huge deal, but no Samosa?! Also, their Garlic Naan was not great. The fresh garlic butter concoction is applied prior to the Tandoor, so it's obviously burnt in the process (seriously, burnt garlic is gross). It's also sparse and sadly lacking that wonderful garlicky flavor. Things I did enjoy: Goat Curry, Vegetable Korma, and Vegetable Pakora.

I've been told their dinner is much stronger and the spicy level can be dialed down, so I may need to give them another chance!",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,4,3,3,6oxl2hhwCTRkGdb1iqvBiQ

We came here for the lunch buffet and were immediately greeted and seated. A bus boy (I guess) brought over a bottle of water and left it along with 2 glasses at the table. My boyfriend (starving) got up and already headed over to the buffet while i waited for the waiter. After about 5 minutes, the hostess who greeted us told me I should go up and grab some food, that they would bring naan to the table (I just wanted to tell our waitress we wanted a diet coke and iced tea... and we were both having the buffet... but OK).

So I head over to the buffet and there are no plates. No biggie... I'm sure it happens everywhere, so I just stand there awkwardly waiting for plates. I see the hostess again and ask her for plates and she told me I could have a seat and they would be out in about 5 minutes. 

Finally, the plates are out! Yey! I head over to the buffet and the floors are so dirty my shoes are literally sticking to the floor ~ like the floor had been coated with a thin layer of honey. I'm too hungry to care, so I dig in... After noticing that most of the dishes were almost gone (like just the swill at the bottom of the bin), I mixed and matched some white rice, masala rice, chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala, a mushroom vegan dish and a weird yellow pepper dish I'd never heard of or seen before (there were no spinach dishes, which was really disappointing-- love me some saag!)

*Also, some of the dishes had printed pieces of paper next to them that said whet they were... printed and just laid out on the table with no stand or anything, and others were written on torn scratch pieces of paper next to the food. They need to invest in some cheap acrylic display stands or something. A torn up piece of paper lying on the table next to a dish is kind of weird and lacks a professional touch imho.

Sadly, the rice was really hard and was either under-cooked, or old and dried out. The vegan dishes were inedible (just not good) the chicken tikka was A-OK and passable, but very much tomato based and not nearly creamy enough-- same as the paneer masala.

There were 2 gulab jamun left in the bin... which I helped myself to for dessert, and I put khir over top of them. The gulab were very dense and not light balls of sugary goodness-- again like they'd been sitting there for a really long time, and the khir was 90% sugary milk and 10% rice. Not the correct consistency at all.

All things considered, the hostess was nice. The waitstaff... non-existent, the food, mediocre at best. We won't be returning. 
(The waiter or waitress never did come to the table-- we went up and paid for our water and 2 buffets at the hostess counter-- $32 plus tip... for who knows).",mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,6,1,2,B4tMxwoZdoNQ8P-Q9nZTVg

Unfortunately the painfully slow service killed it for us. Took so long to get our drinks- tea and juice- that our apps came out first. We had eaten all our apps before we could flag down the server to take our entree order. Another 20+ minutes for our food- the tikka masala and saag were great. The lamb kebobs were extremely dry and overcooked- we didn't eat them. But we didn't send them back because the server never made it back over to check on us so by the time we were ready to get the check, it just wasn't worth it. The server was also answering phones, seating guests,  making drinks at the bar, taking to go orders and waiting on tables- yes just 1 person doing all of this. So of course there's no way one person could handle all this well, plus he had no sense of urgency. There were 2 busser/food runners who seemed to also have no sense of urgency. One of them was just standing around twice when we asked him if he could get our server. Our table remained cluttered with menus, plates and glasses that should have been removed the entire meal. Just too many strikes.

I mean no disrespect but that is essentially 50 percent of my experience with India.  The other 50 percent comes from sampling the Sub Continent's spicy, bold, uber flavorful food at numerous places in Soho London.  Impressive huh.

Most Indian places in Vegas are known for their very inexpensive and decent lunch buffets.  Mint offers a respectable one at $14.95 but dinner and the plethora of dishes is where this place stands out.

Tip:  New to Indian cuisine, try the tasting menu (2 person).  Less adventurous dishes and a well rounded selection.

Begin with a few starters to sample the complex, spicy chutneys.  The bhel puri (rice crackers with a coconut, tomato, and mango chutneys) and padi chaat (pan fried potato cakes topped with garbanzo beans, mint and tamarind chutney) both very good.  Try them without the yogurt to really taste the flavors.

From here, interactive dining begins.  Order a bunch of mains and fresh cooked flat breads.  Dispense with the utensils and let the pinching and mopping begin.

The naan, puffy, soft and warm straight from the oven.  Plain is best (remember, this is a mop).  The puri (deep fried puffy bread) very neutral if adding richness is needed, the unbuttered piping hot roti (think of a whole wheat, unpuffed naan just chewier) makes a very good platform for heartier braises.  

Warm, spicy (both heat and ground spice blends), tender braised chunks of protein and a layer of fat eagerly await pinching and mopping.  The korma (ordered with lamb) very good.  Earthy, with very powerful turmeric flavor, good heat, fall apart tender lamb.  Cashew nuts add texture and its oil blends well.  The Baingan Bharta (pureed roasted eggplant simmered with tomato, onion, garlic and chilis) a great foil for any dish; neutral texture and not fatty.  the Chetinad Curry (spicy, earthy spice blend, coconut, and chicken) exemplifies what most of us consider Indian.   

Friendly and thankfully helpful off Strip service.  

Good selection of beer.  Think light and Asian to cut the spice.

A fun, interactive meal that, if you're like me with legume laden spicy foods, provides another weapon for the poker players arsenal.   Can we say mustard gas?  Oops, TMI.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,22,22,4,HFuN8A1PL4e8aZ6mx9vuKQ

We didn't wait long, and they kept an eye on the table.  The downside?  They played football on the big screen in the main dining room.  I like football, but if I wanted to watch a game, I would have picked my dinner up or ordered pizza.  I asked them to turn it down, which they did not.  There were only a few people in the restaurant, none of which even glanced at the screen.  Basically, the guys that worked there were watching the game.  It was loud and ruined the whole Indian dining experience.  Even worse, they could have played it low in the bar section and it would have been just fine.  The restaurant itself was beautiful.

5278744,2018-01-07,3,9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw,"With locations on East Flamingo and South Durango it is the belief of some that Mint Indian Bistro offers some of the most authentic Indian Cuisine in all of Las Vegas, and with a daily Buffet from 11:00am until four o'clock daily it was on Friday afternoon that schedules aligned for a visit.

In general a competitive market, the East Side admittedly far moreso while Mint's opening in Spring Valley actually filled an unlikely void in late 2016, guests entering the strip-mall location at 4246 South Durango Drive will find themselves immediately greeted at the door by one of two male servers behind the register of an elegantly designed space, ""The Lassi Bar"" proudly standing just ten feet away offering self-service Beer and Wine by the ounce.

Joining India Oven Masala as the only Restaurant in the Valley with a live Naan and Dosa station, the former made to order for each and every guest visiting the Buffet but Dosa only offered at Dinner, it was immediately after seating at a spacious booth that Water was poured with a full-bottle left for refills, a brief perusal of the individual warmers full of Food showing far fewer options than at many of Las Vegas' competing Buffets with more than half of the offerings either Vegetarian or Vegan.

Describing their menu as fresh, rich and complex, an ""Inferno Menu"" featuring Ghost Peppers offered to those crazy enough to sign a waiver in hopes of landing a picture on Mint's wall near the restrooms, it was by way of several trips and small portions that all but the Paneer Tikka Masala and White Rice were tasted over the course of sixty minutes, plate one showing Vegetable Pakora to be both oily and too thickly battered while the Bone-in Goat Curry was tender, lean and boldly spiced without being too ""hot,"" a similar statement befitting Chicken and Potatoes in a deep red Sauce bold with Garlic, Cumin and Ginger that was so good it warranted seconds.

Enjoying two types of Naan with the meal, the quartered round painted in Ghee cooked a bit more crisp than one awash with Garlic, fans of Coconut Chutney will be happy to know that Mint is one of the few places in town that puts the lightly spiced condiment on its Buffet, the more typical Mint and Tamarind also present along with housemade plain Yogurt and spicy Pickles plus thick Mango Jam that goes great with fluffy Idli Rice Cakes or even the Tandoori Chicken.

Presenting just the Goat and four Chicken preparations as part of the Buffet, the Tikka Masala expectedly popular with a mostly Caucasian crowd, those looking for a bit more heat would do well to procure a scoop of the fusion-y Chicken Chili, the addition of Soy Sauce to cubes of Breast Meat and Peppers giving the dish an extra bit of intrigue that also pairs it well to thick Noodles and mixed Vegetables found near the Tandoori oven.

A bit disappointed by the lack of Samosas or Palak Paneer, both universal staples of other Indian Buffets in town, it was with another scoop of Chicken Vindaloo that a few spoonfuls of Dal Tadka confirmed no more was necessary, the Cauliflower and Potatoes faring far better as did the thick, earthy and never-before-seen Mushroom Mutter.

Reportedly using only ""natural, antibiotic free meats,"" the cost of such perhaps part of the decision to limit Buffet options as they have, Desserts once again offered fewer choices than the likes of Delhi or Everest, the Kheer fairly low in sugar but nice and thick while the Gulab Jamun were piping hot, spongy and as sweet as expected.

***A bit more limited than other Las Vegas Indian Buffets, the website's suggested cost of $12.99 actually $14.99 + tax and tip as charged, Mint Indian Bistro is a fine choice for those in the area who do not wish to drive far, but for those looking for more variety or a lower price there are better places to be found.

It was my first time here, and I was brave to try something new. I have heard amazing things about this place, and I was not disappointed. We had the following:
Naan (description from the website)
Warm soft, puffy bread baked lovingly in a special clay oven, or topped off with fire roasted garlic or stuffed with your choice of chicken & chilli, ground lamb, onion/cilantro, or paneer.
Kadhai
Chunky quartered green bell peppers and onions pan-tossed with a barrage of homemade paneer cheese, tofu, chicken, lamb, goat, fish or shrimp and a flurry of green chillies, ginger, and coriander that drenches like an Indian monsoon.
Karma Korma (MY FAVORITE!)
A creamy sauce sprinkled with cashew nuts and assorted home grounded spices. Embrace your karma and try this dish fated to be your favorite. Vegans no longer need to skip this one.
They were all really tasty, and some amazing flavors that it kept my grub buddies (4 in total) busy. No talking for a good 20 minutes. Each dish came with a side of rice, but I gravitated to the naan bread. By the end of the dinner, there was not one piece of food left. Naturally, we skipped dessert because it was not humanly possible to squeeze anything else in. 
As for the 4 stars, the service was okay. It took a good amount of time for our food to come. I was surprised by the cost of the items, they were higher then I anticipated $12.99 to $15.99 for entree.
I look forward to trying more items during the lunch buffet.",15EfkL69gvmLmrvYGODDqw,2,1,4,gbZYLmaC4JJ40BFABtBibA

1. Will not like this one
2. Should probably get the brain checked out

Their ambitious, new west side location is HUGE.  The open space is well designed and would make for a rockin party full of people and lassi showers.  But on a random Tuesday night with a total of 6 customers in the place, we looked like detainees in an empty nightclub being served delicious food to pass the time.

And delicious was definitely my key word for their dosa!  Hard to find for dinner around these parts, consider me all-in when this fantastic South Indian delicacy is available.  Their ""Butter Masala Dosa"" works great as either an entrée or an appetizer for 4.  Stuffed with spiced potatoes, cheese and onions, this 2.5 foot ""prince of carbs"" will undoubtedly get appetites revved up for what else is to come.  The paper thin crispiness and rich buttery flavor in every bite of this huge crepe is simply delightful.  The curries we sampled were all solid as well with the ""Maharaja Tikka Masala"" being my favorite on this most recent visit.  I also love their korma and vindaloo.

I've had my fair share of bad experiences. But I have to give Mint's lunch buffet credit. It was delicious!! This location has a larger selection of food on their lunch buffet and they have someone making fresh made naan right there (note: don't try to pick that up on your own. they get a bit angry and tell you to sit down and they'll bring it to you...) 

Buffets are good for trying new things, but the food is often less spicy than my preferences. There was one noodle dish that was spicy and delicious and I'd never tried it before. Otherwise, the rice was rice, the tikka masala was good (but not spicy), the chili chicken was tasty, the fried cauliflower was super yummy. They did have a good mix of vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes. And you do get naan... but you have to wait for them to bring it to your table. 

The price is pretty decent. I think it was either $14 or $16 per person, which is a bit more than I'd want to pay to go there often, but once in a while isn't too bad.",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,1,1,4,2lKI-5ED2XJWyD1P_qg4fQ

I mean my 14 year old says ""This shrimp is rubbery they really over cooked this. Why m i 14 and know better than the cook?"" ? 

She ain't wrong though. Look I don't like dropping $70 for mediocre Indian ""cuisine"" 

The flavors of the vindaloo and masala are mediocre at best.  And I can deal with that but the meats being so over cooked that I can't even eat it .... like are you serious. I'll be bringing this whole order back bundled up. 

Stop letting people who don't care about the quality shovel mediocre crap out when you're over charging for it. 

Shrimp takes only minutes to cook like holy crap I don't want a shrimp flavored vindaloo because you simmered the shrimp in it all day 

The chicken tika flavor is off to me however it was really the cubes dry as heck chunks of chicken. 

Even the Naan there is Mediocre.  It is thicker than most Naan I have eaten yet less flavorful. Definitely was not impressed for my first time eating this food. The staff is super nice that's not an issue it's just the cooks are mediocrely cooking their food.
