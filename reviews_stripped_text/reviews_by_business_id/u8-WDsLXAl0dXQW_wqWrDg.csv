As for the food. I started off with the Chicken Wings with the Honey Chipotle sauce. The wings tasted great. They had a nice breading and the sauce had a nice sweet and spicy kick to it. I would recommend these to anyone. 

I also got the The Cowboy. It comes with Applewood smoked bacon, barbecue sauce, crisp onions and Pepper Jack cheese. I got the burger Medium which it was more well done. The Applewood bacon was on point and the star of  this burger. Had a great taste and was really thick bacon. However, even with medium the burger seemed dry and lacked in taste. I found myself always grabbing for my drink after a bit and didnt have any juices running out the back of the burger. The barbecue sauce also almost seemed missing. I could see it but could not taste it. Overall the burger was just alright but I would not get it again. 

I also got the Garlic fries which are the normal hand-cut fries with some garlic butter and olive oil added. If you like garlic they are pretty good. As long as you have no plans later or dont mind garlic breathe for a few hours I would recommend them. 

Overall in the end it is a burger joint and I felt the burger was lacking in flavor and juiciness. Might have just been a bad night so I would try a different burger at a later time.",j40l9KEw2Nli6aNnINtYhw,0,0,2,U-oq_IcaBvdyNRtStHPXhA

My wife ordered a well done bacon cheese burger and I am not sure how she got through half of the burger. The service was good and the pineapple upside cake drink my wife had was outstanding which is why it got 2 stars instead of 1. 

Update: Since my bad experience at Broadway Burger, I was been contacted by their staff and after some great discussions they gave me a full refund my meal. They definitely have an A+ when it comes to customer service. I will definitely give Broadway Burgers after chance next time I am in Vegas. 

Update 2: My wife and I decided to give this place another chance and I am so glad we did. Completely night and day compared to the last time I was here. Of course my wife ordered the pineapple upside down cake drink. It is her favorite. Our food was really good. Burgers were cooked perfectly. Truly was a great experience.

It's understandable that she did not believe me, however Vegas bars give away free drinks all night long. To bit replace our beers after an honest mistake is absolutely ridiculous.

380312,2014-09-21,0,u8-WDsLXAl0dXQW_wqWrDg,"Had to stop in here at 4am because America was closed for cleaning (is that a metaphor? an allegory? HELP WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR!?). I ordered a ham and cheese omelet with a side of fries. I wish I could post a photo to this review (and, who knows, maybe on the mobile app I can) but it was the most wan-looking, unappetizing omelet I've consumed in a very long time. The side of hash browns was bigger than said omelet, and not very exciting. I asked for hot sauce and the server brought me about 7 varieties of Tobasco. That was why this place gets 2 stars instead of 1.

Service was fine. I think my guy's name was James? He was working there instead of America because I guess the whole staff moved during the cleaning and was operating out of the Burger Bar's kitchen...but only serving the Burger Bar's menu? Yeah, I was just as confused as you were, and I was about 12 Jack-and-Cokes deep at that point. Honestly, I just wanted the gravy fries from America but I had to settle for this instead. Also when I received my place setting there was no fork. I was simply given a knife wrapped up inside a napkin. It was almost as if someone was trying to tell me, ""It's 4am and you're wasted, eating an omelet and fries by yourself in a corner booth at a 24-hour diner. Kill yourself.""

Obviously I didn't, because I'm here writing this review...

Burgers, fries, fish sandwiches, pork rib sandwich, philly cheesesteak, hot dogs.  You can't really go wrong if you eat any of these things.

However, both times i had the garlic and herb fries with my burgers.  This is where they lost a star.  They serve the fries in a metal basket that is shaped like a mini deep fryer basket lined with paper to catch the oil.  However the fries are packed into the basket so the oil is trapped and the fries are soft and mushy.  The first order was tolerable, but the second time was worse.  I'll know better next time.  There are three or four other types of fries and don't know if they result in same mushiness.  There are also many sauces that can be had on the side, though none really appealed to me.

577631,2012-03-30,1,u8-WDsLXAl0dXQW_wqWrDg,"Don't be tempted: the menu looks wonderful, but the taste doesn't match.

The Broadway Burger Bar & Grill couldn't have a better location, right in the heart of the New York, New York. And we wanted to try it from the moment we saw the sign. We were disappointed.

We ordered two ""Cowboy"" burgers and one child's chicken strips meal, all of which proved tasteless. That's a lot of calories and a lot of dollars for not a lot of enjoyment.

Some positives: we were seated immediately, and service was very fast even in the middle of lunch. And the onion rings (with some dipping sauce) were quite nice.

But you don't visit a burger restaurant for onion rings, so let's talk about the burgers. First, Broadway Burger Bar & Grill cooks burgers either ""medium"" or ""well done"", so if you like your burger ""medium well"" you're compromising before you even sit down.

Each burger can be made with beef (""all natural, grass fed, 100% free range Estancia Beef""), chicken, salmon, turkey, or veggie as its heart. And there are more than a few combinations of toppings on the menu. We picked The Cowboy (""Applewood-smoked bacon, barbecue sauce, crisp onions and pepper jack cheese."")

Every word of that sounds delicious. The real things were completely bland. Unseasoned ground beef has more taste at our house than all those wonderful combinations did here. Even with the pepper jack cheese and barbecue sauce, I couldn't find even a hint of spice or flavor in my meal.

With the most basic burger (the ""B3&G"") costing $9.95, by the time we'd added drinks and onion rings, a meal for two adults and a small child rang up over $50. That's admittedly less than we might have spent at other casino restaurants, where everything is overpriced, but that doesn't make the product worth the price.

In-and-Out burger is just a ten minute walk down Tropicana, and would be a better experience for about a third the cost. Inside the casino, Nathan's (on the second floor) costs about the same but offers a much tastier meal.",qCTuruGmwtpXyHMrmgjC_g,0,1,2,6UZ12YZYLzGKXlUmCtTqVA

A friend brought me here for dinner after deciding we didn't want to drive anywhere to eat.  He'd been here before and said the food was good so I was game.  The restaurant was fairly empty for a Friday night and we were seated with no problem.  The menu allows for building of a custom burger or ordering one of their Gourmet Burgers or Salads.  We decided on two burgers and we'd share so we could try more than one.  We ordered:

Italian w/Chicken
Southwestern w/Beef

I opted for the Broadway Combo which adds hand-cut fries and a drink for a $5 upcharge.  They allowed me to choose Virgil's Root Beer as my drink, but no free refills, which was fine with me.

Both burgers arrived at the same time and we proceeded to cut them in half ourselves. I thought the Italian was a little more interesting than the Southwestern and my friend agreed that the flavors were more complementary.  The Southwestern was good, but the Italian was better.  Even though there was a lot listed under the Southwestern, it almost seemed like not all of the ingredients were present.

The fries were also good.  They are steak fries so they weren't crispy.  Mine weren't overly salted and they were a little greasy, but they tasted good and the portions are generous.

I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try some other selections from the menu.  The staff was very friendly, the food was good, and the prices are reasonable.",K7vTmYHTnr0fjw807c8E2w,0,0,3,-org03872GlO4PiO7PnydQ

Terrible wait for a chicken BLT and a chicken caesar. I think I could've whipped it up myself in 20 or less if I had everything in front of me.

Food: (0 if possible) 1 out of 5

Chicken (the main protein in our dishes) were dry. I mean it was like eating an eraser. The salad leaves look like it's been sitting out. Not fresh at all. 

Service: 3 out of 5

The bartender was super friendly and helpful. She explained the meat and how fresh it is (i think it's grass fed) and gave us recommendations. My brother got the beef southwest burger. It had pepperjack cheese, jalepeno bacon, and tortilla strip. He loved it! I had a beef greek burger which was uniquely served on pita bread topped with a cucumber greek salad and an amazing cucumber yogure sauce... OMG!

First of all, the place itself looks nicer than the pictures online posted by the restaurant. While the service was super friendly from host to server, the food was not good at all. Also, the table could have been cleaner- for example, the ketchup bottle was a greasy mess which also had ketchup all over it. 

The menu looked appetizing and offered a variety of options. Sadly, the sandwiches were bad. We chose portobello sandwiches thinking we would get a nice, fresh healthy sandwich. It was not! It was a fried portobello that looked like it was breaded by Sysco Co. There was no flavor in the breading whatsoever and it was the skinniest portobello I've ever seen! YUCK! The paremsan crisp on top was flavorless and the random dollops of mozzarella were mildly ok. The garlic fries were ok, but they were soggy. I was hoping for some crispy fries. They tasted edible, so we pretty much ate those and left most of our sandwiches. 

This is not a good place to come, particularly for the portobellos. I would say keep on moving for a sandwich place.",715N9CM6qrRp_lLzgp79rw,1,0,2,Jb2xyFMcRg-2_s1x5NZDtA

We came here to have lunch one afternoon.
I ordered the Fresh Salmon burger on a wheat bun and my bf got a Cheese Burger and garlic fries.

Ok, salon burger was so fresh, i swear they must have a sea in the kitchen or something. I was really impressed with the freshness and taste. Pretty large size also. Loved it.
Cheese Burger was good, step up from fast food but nothing gourmet.

Waitstaff was really pleasant. The manager actually brought our food out and came to check up on us once more.
The atmosphere blends well with the hotel.

The burgers we tried were delicious.  I had the Italian topped with bruscheta style tomatos, aioli, and parmesan crisp.  My Burger was cooked slightly less than I prefer and came out more medium rare than medium. It was still tasty. 

We also tried the Bella Burger which was a portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese and coated and fried in panko bread crumbs.  Very delicious! 

All burgers are served a la carte. Sides are an additional  $4 to $5 but are a filling portion to share between two people.  We tried the pickle fries which were very good. Our order came out hot and coated with a light batter and we're still in a spear like shape.  They were missing a dipping sauce of some kind to enhance the flavor.  Even a ranch served on the side would be an improved taste.

Service was welcoming and attentive. I liked that they have a patio area which feels like your outside without being out side, it's a great place to people watch.

So, Mr Tourist goes to Vegas and spents eight hours in airports to eat a Pastrami Burger at Ameirica, different restuarant.  Which happened to close post superbowl or yesterday.  Mark is now in search for anything burger like. On tuesday night, the place was half full but its a casino so gamblers are busy elsewhere.

Now this is my first time ever hearing the term Estancia beef  (from Uruguay), it is damn near perfect.  Okay, besides the obvious burger choices the menu includes Black & Blue (with Roquefort cheese), English pub burger with grill tomato and egg, Southwestern with jalopena bacon & guac, & Philly Cheesesteak Burger (with shaved ribeye steak).  I opted for Black & Blue, it came straight down from burger heaven.  A fine pink stripe as ordered medium, lots of Roquefort cheese oozing off and I attempted to eat it. The Philly Cheese steak burger was very good, too.  Both were very juicy, needed plenty of extra napkins!!  And if you must have fries with burger (like its optional), go for garlic fries.  They have an interesting way of making them, they use minced garlic!!!  Lots of garlic and one serving was more than enough for two. You can get about 6 differnet mustards and four types of mayo.

But like is not all burgers, they have beer! On draft varieties includ Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale, Full Sail Amber Ale, Rogue Dead Guy Ale, Abita Turbodog Brown Ale, Three monkeys Nut Brown Ale, and the list goes on to less important beers.  Really nice ""little"" place in Mega Casino Land.  Great staff, quick service, friendly and helpful with selections.

Broadway Burger Bar is located inside the New York New York Casino over near the Zumanity theater and Race and Sports Book. 

After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't quite sure what to expect in terms of service. I have to say that we were quite pleased with the service we received here.

I decided to play it safe and just get a cheeseburger($9.95) and fries($2.95), while my friend opted for the chili cheese burger($11.50).

 Both of our burgers were quite tasty and the patties were so thick and juicy! They seem to take great pride in the fact that their burgers are 100% free-range, grass fed Estancia beef.  This means they are all natural with no hormones and no antibiotics! Nice! Fries were nothing spectacular, but the portion size was healthy.

We were checked on repeatedly by our waitress and never had to ask for our drinks to be topped off. We were very pleased with the service here.

I noticed some people complained about the prices, but considering you are on the strip, the prices are not bad at all. Actually it's not too much more than you would pay at a Chili's or Applebee's off the strip...so suck it up,cupcake!

I would definitely come back here again for a quick, casual bite to eat if I find myself in NY-NY again!

I got the Swiss and Mushroom burger, which was cooked perfectly medium rare just as I had asked. I am so used to getting medium burgers (ordered medium rare) that I was thrilled!! 

Apart from being cooked correctly, the need was well seasoned with salt and pepper, came with a generous amount of delicious sautéed mushrooms (crimini and shiitake), and a flavorful melted aged Swiss on a toasted fresh-baked bun. Just a delicious burger - the best I've had in a long time.

I found the menu (somewhat) limited. My husband went with the Cowboy Burger which had bacon, (pepper jack) cheese, onions and BBQ sauce on it. He is lactose intolerant and can't do pepper jack cheese so he asked if he could get provolone instead and the server said there was an up charge for provolone... I personally have NEVER heard of an up charge for a cheese switch, especially provolone???? He then asked for it to be cooked Medium Well and she said they ONLY cook the burgers medium or well... Personally have NEVER heard of only 2 temps either. Weird. Sides do not come with the burgers so you pay extra if you want fries. They do have a combo where you get a burger and add fries and a drink for $5 more (which is what he did). He said the burger was really good but unfortunately having it well done made it dry (but he was nervous getting it med). The fries were great too, fresh cut.

I ended up choosing just a house salad. I asked if I could get romaine lettuce instead of the lettuce it was supposed to come with. There was a looooooooooong pause... And I continued, ""Or is that a problem??"" Eventually she said I could have romaine. (Almost then asked if there would be an up charge for that switch). The description said the salad came with a ""sherry vinaigrette"" but I get weird with dressings, they can make or break a salad so I asked for it on the side. It ended up being good BUT I wouldn't call it a vinaigrette... It was a creamy dressing similar in consistency to Caesar or ranch. I see vinaigrette and I think more or a thin Italian-like, oil & vinegar dressing. 

Iced tea cost $4. Yikes. Seemed high.

Server was ok. She wasn't super friendly but did her job. 

All in all, food was good and came out fast. They'll charge you for everything extra. I'd say we'd be back but I like to try new restaurants.",kiHby7Jotm24QDM3SB32LA,0,0,3,c7GiZMxve_pOWVHh_FWtkg

I ordered a plain burger, no cheese, no bun to accommodate my food sensitivities. The burger arrived with tomatoes and large pieces of butter lettuce which is optimal for making a lettuce wrap. There were no other basic garnishes like onions or pickles. They only do medium and well done.  Minus a point for not offering medium rare.

Ordered pickle on the side which was whole and quite perfect. And ordered onions which were nice and thin.

My eating companion loved his bacon burger with toasted onion and BBQ sauce.  

We had pork belly sliders which were good, and probably did not even need all that BBQ sauce. Pork belly mmmm.....

Limited selection of meat for a burger place. Chicken, beef, salmon and veggie. Wish they offered lamb, or other meat options.

Extra points for using pastured beef. It was a decent burger and slathered with mayo and Dijon, quite tasty. Next time I will make a point of adding more fixings for more flavor. The burger alone did not stand out.",EgUEd1P7gdHvAgPSzwAIUQ,0,0,3,s1eeOGflq4BFDbI_-rLQWg

I had to ask for water multiple times before I got it. My husband also asked for waters for the table. I was the only one that got a water, after asking again...  And I REALLY needed some water!!!
When my husband asked for his burger to be medium well he was told his options were medium or well, nothing else. 
Most of the beers that our table requested were not available. Having a decent selection of good beers means nothing if the ones people order are not actually available. 

The garlic and herb fries smelled fantastic but I found the flavor to be a little weak. Maybe it was the booze messing with my tastebuds though?? They don't skimp on the amount of fries, consider splitting an order if you aren't a heavy eater. My brother in law RAVED about his burger, he even said it was the best he ever ate. That may have been the whiskey talking though...  My husband devoured his burger as well, and commented that he could really tell the meat was good quality.

Crisp applewood-smoked bacon
and American cheese) 
The burger was kind of on the smaller side but enough to split between two people and fill their tummys up for awhile. I was impressed with the taste of the Turkey burger itself (i know i always repeat that i hate a dry tasting burger especially a Turkey burger) but this was a wow factor the spices and onions made the taste really pop! Sad to say but the bacon was overcooked and small.

Before making the long drive back to LA, the 'crew' (i lack a better term) - and I were cranky, hungry and hung over and couldn't agree on a kind of food to consume. When in doubt, grab a burger. So stumbling around New York, New York - we ran into this place. 

It was pretty empty so we figured we could get some food relatively quick and hit the road. Too bad that wasn't the case. 

The service was ridiculous. It wasn't busy at all and there were plenty of staff around to get to us, but mannnnnnn slow is not descriptive enough. I guess everyone else was hungover too. 

Anyway, I was digging the idea of grass fed beef and all that hipster burger-ness that I adore. Too bad it didn't deliver. 
My burger was on the dry side (so much for med rare), the bun was a bit day old feeling and the flavors were gamey and over seasoned. Damn it. I hate when I waste calories on bad food. 

Also, one of the burger options says 'avocado' whereas another option is 'guacamole' so I assumed that there were two options. Nope - no avocado. Stooopid.

Broadway Burger Bar & Grill is where I devoured one of the best tasting burgers in my life!

Do I remember what it was? Noooooooo... but it had bacon on it, and cheese.  Their garlic french fries were divine, and they even served a brand of root beer that I had never heard of before for my root beer float.  That just means it's really authentic, really old, or... really cheap.

The friend I was with loved what she ordered as well.  The waitress set us up on a four-top, half booth half stand alone chairs, and we could look out at the casino.  That was cool.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded so I was pretending she set us up there on account of how purdy we looked that day.

I do remember paying something like $40 for everything - everything being two burgers, an order or fries, a beer and the aforementioned root beer float.  Sounds about right for a restaurant, ya?

The noise level is pretty average, where we were sitting by the kitchen anyway.  You sort of get used to the singing of slot machines while inside any casino so someone with a sensitivity to noise might think other than me. However, I do feel that where we were sitting (and you can completely see it if you go in there - it's a four-top half booth/half stand alone chairs, leaning up against the kitchen) was devoid of any distractions at all.  And I was probably hungover.  For a hungover person to think it's quiet, then I'd say you can trust that judgment.",P919p4m6lAUJWxgIQqEUWw,2,2,4,8JDs_cPe9t6W3ixe4abfIw

Their prices were pricey but doable. They serve 100 percent free range grass fed burgers. That's rare!  According to the hostess, their buns are made in house or at least withen the hotel. Their frying oil is not trans-fat and didn't taste as if they were frozen. Fries tasted good. The burgers were fantastic. Looked small at first untill you start eating then you start to realize it's a good amount of meat. Went in very hungry and left extremely full. They also had a ton of condiment to choose from. Since they are a healthier restaurant, they should offer simply heinz. Some of us are not a HFCS friendly:-)

The reason for the four star was their service. The food came out quickly. No issue there. When we first came to ask the hostess about the food quality she was very informative and even double checked on her anwser to be sure. We went in as a table of 12, 4 adults and 8 kids. The hostess said they would be able to sit us. I grabbed the whole crew and they had planned to seat us at two different tables. There were hardly anyone at the restaurant so it was easy to connect the tables. When they saw that we were not satisfied, they managed to put us on the high top tables which was fine. We ordered and they gave us an extra kid's burger for a 3 year old girl who the mom did not order a burger for. We notified them and they took the burger away but after the 3 year old saw the burger she wanted it. The mom was originally going to give her a lil piece of hers. So we ask that we take the burger back since she's complaining about it. It was their error for causing the girl to complain. I expected the burger to be comped. Lastly, because the gratuity was included the server was lacking on giving us her best service. We can tell the difference when gratuity is included. If she would have given a friendlier service I would have tipped on top of the gratuity.

As far as burgers go, I would say, this is as good as your going to get. The portion size per burger is huge, the amount of choices you can get on it are endless, and the taste and quality is perfect. Went here twice (once at the beginning of my trip and once at the end) and both times we enjoyed the place very much. I've had many standard hamburgers, but Broadway Burger in NYNY is far beyond that. I almost wish I stayed longer to try all the burger options.


PROS
*Price - For the price it was certainly worth it. With tip, I think I paid around $16 for a really good burger. That may sound expensive, but for Las Vegas I think that is pretty reasonable after everything is said and done.

*Quality & Taste - A lot of fancy restaurants overcharge for a standard hamburger, but this place really brings flavor and juice to its burgers. Not to even mention there are a ton of options to put on your burger and make it how you really want. I got the Cowboy burger and added a fried egg, to give it a ton of extra flavor.

*Portion Size - Burger is huge. You will be full after eating it.

*Atmosphere - It's in NYNY, so when you're eating there, you feel like your actually in a city. It's pretty cool have they have a whole section for restaurants in the area, so when you walk around you'll see a NY Pizza place and so on.

CONS
*Caesar Salad and Fries - Really the only negative I saw with this place was the Caesar salad and the fries. The Caesar salad was very dry and not very flavorful. They didn't really have caesar dressing, but just some parmesan cheese. Also, I wasn't the biggest fan of the fries, but to be honest, I've had much worse too.",Xstf9n7v8rSOryJAuY2S7Q,0,0,4,KPdY0L7gzTbhxHOd3QyeVA

We had a staycation in Vegas and needed to feed our kids since it took us forever to check out. So we had brunch at Broadway Burger Bar because the little people needed French fries and hamburgers. 

When you walk in, per my husband, it's like having lunch in New York. It's loud in the casino making the place loud, a little gloomy (it was tucked away in a dark alley near Zumanity), and the AC blew nice. The hostess and server were welcoming and it was very clean. 

Dear husband had the Mushroom Swiss. It liked it. The meat was hearty and it was a thick piece! I settled with the Cowboy which included: onion strings, pepper jack cheese and BBQ sauce, it was really good. They offer kids meals: mac n cheese, hamburger, or chicken tender. We went for the chicken tenders and burger for the kids. They finished all their food! The fries are a medium cut, they give you a lot and I recommend the garlic fries. 

I'm not a burger fan and I'm glad we all enjoyed our brunch here at Broadway Burger Bar.",PWS6InBVkMcPLJoOVMqwcQ,0,0,5,qcdKgA3M6ubn52IyTMdAiA

We also had the garlic and chili cheese fries with a Caesar salad.  I liked the garlic fries more than the chili cheese.  We wanted to keep our stomachs ready for the buffet, so we ordered 2 burgers to share among the 4 of us.  And to be honest, it was more than enough to get us all full.  It came out to be a $50+ lunch for the food and drinks, but hey, that's Vegas for you.",oikXg4SUWH0ERfL_E6shhQ,0,0,3,ZCzaR_wPLh8J29zTnyQIow

This location is convenient, it's the first thing you spot right after walking out of Zumanity. Located in the the Village Shops at NY-NY. Watching people indulge in their burgers makes it look good and tempting, especially when you're hungry. We weren't too hungry though, so Sarah A. and I split a:

Bacon & Cheese Turkey Burger - The patty was flavorful but overall the burger was too dry. I like my burger dripping wet and sloppy! Dry patty and overcooked bacon was too tough. It wasn't exactly the biggest burger either.

Two of us ordered a beef burger (medium) and it tasted like cardboard. We were just disappointed it wasn't juicy, or seasoned.

We also ordered a couple of their signature cocktails, which got us tipsy, but it tasted more like the blue agave than actual alcohol. I doubt the drinks were even mixed.

The best part of the meal was probably the chili cheese fries. Oh yeah- all of their fries were pretty good, better than their burgers.

Finally, my problem with this place was that I sat in a really sketchy chair. My lower right thigh got a rash after sitting there for an hour. It couldn't have been from anywhere else since I was standing all day at the T-Mobile center for an event. I noticed the rash once I got up to my room and showered.

After walking quite a bit hungover, and being probably the most sober I have ever been in Vegas, I was getting a TAD cranky, as was my cousin, who was having major clothing issues.  My poor boyfriend was dealing with us, but also really wanted to make it to NY NY because he had fond memories of it and its food court.  When we finally made it into the casino, I refused to eat at the food court because the lack of comfortable seating, and so, we compromised at a cheaper sit down restaurant, and ended up at Broadway Burger Bar and Grill.

They have a decent beer selection, that even though it isn't vast, it is a good selection of lesser known beers at decent prices ($6 pint) for Vegas (they have your boring standard beers if you really want to save the $.50, but then you wouldn't be my friend).  They have lots of different burger options, and you have your choice of beef, chicken, veggie, turkey or salmon.  My cousin and I ended up with the Southwestern and the BF got the Black and Blue with garlic fries to share. 

In my state anything would have tasted good, but jalapeno bacon was just what the doctor ordered.  The Southwestern kicked major butt, with a great blending of flavors, and that delicious jalapeno bacon!  The Black and Blue was also good, but a little boring in comparison (it hurts my heart to call roquefort boring).  The burgers came on a great bun.  At first I thought it seemed a little large for the burger, but it really held its own against the sauces, and had a good taste on its own.  The fries were also really tasty, though I wouldn't have minding a tad more garlic, story of my life.

The service was very nice and attentive, and it was just what I needed to get my stamina up to make it back to our car (or maybe that was the hoppy beer).  The food was good, the prices were right, and how can you not love a restaurant that the fries come in a fryer basket?",6p0OFMcI5JHytFSuZWDyeQ,2,1,4,k-3iudRiyGneTJ_NpdtL5w

The burgers were excellent as were the fries and service.  The price wasn't too bad either.  I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes for our food.  It was a nice break from having to navigate through the tremendous amount of high priced restaurants Las Vegas has to choose from.

5985148,2011-06-29,1,u8-WDsLXAl0dXQW_wqWrDg,"I went here in late March while playing the ponies in the NYNY Casino sports book. I walked up to the bar area, took a seat and was approached fairly quickly by a bartender that offered me a drink. It was about 11:00am, so alcohol wasn't in the question. 

I cannot recall the name of the burger that I had, but it was your run of the mill hamburger with the fried egg in it. I opted out of the cheese and had some sweet potato fries on the side. 

The reason it gets 4 stars is because of the taste, location, value, and service. Unfortunately, the ""touristy-ness"" takes away a star, and that's not the restaurant's fault. I understand it's part of a big tourist area and how they try really hard to appeal for tourist dollars. The price is very good given the type of food you are ordering and the location of the restaurant.  Finally, the service was good. I remember that the bartender was very friendly, and knew that most of the patrons coming in and out of their restaurant were people who were playing the sports book and/or ponies, like myself.

In essence, this place offers a good quality ""high end"" burger. I am a fan. See attached picture of my meal.",7SyVy8LmnqSHv20W51uleQ,1,1,4,k8OMoCXf2A0JmFCjIKPqsQ
