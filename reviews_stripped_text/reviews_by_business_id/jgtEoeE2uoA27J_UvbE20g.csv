303432,2012-03-08,4,jgtEoeE2uoA27J_UvbE20g,"I was downtown by the El Cortz and needed something quick to eat.  I recalled seeing Uncle Joe's on Yelp and decided to make a stop before I hit up the Fremont area for a rugby event.

I stepped inside and felt like I was transported back to one of the many old-school pizza places back home in Pittsburgh.  Yes, the place advertises Philly Cheesesteaks on the window, but is eastern PA really so different from west?

If you're an east coaster, I think you'll know the place well: small interior, dimly lit, old school booths for seating, the overwhelming color palate from 1978, an ancient stove with a pot of sauce bubbling away, some sports game on a small TV, and a ""hurry up and order"" feeling you get from the guy behind the counter.  I honestly forgot for a minute that I was in Las Vegas.

My husband and I got the 2 (huge) slices for $4 deal.  For a dollar more you can get a drink.  You cannot beat these prices, even Downtown.

Taste-wise?  Ok, maybe not 4-star.  It's your typical thin-crust, greasy, east-coast-style pizza and nothing really jumps out to ""wow.""  But it's definitely solid pizza at a great price.  Go for the atmosphere and to fill up before a night of drinking in the Downtown area.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,4,4,MTS79CY9eylF0gRgCgAjLg

But the combination of the people running the restaurant and the taste of the food makes it unforgettable. When you come in for the first time and get greeted by Joe, he makes you feel like family. Like you've been coming in regularity for a long time. Some times Joe's son is running the place and he is just as friendly. The kitchen is very small and you wonder how they can put out so much food in such a small space. There are seven tables for two persons and three tables for four persons. The walls have photos of the Rat Pack and others as well as a photo of Joe when he was a poker player.

Uncle Joe's is known as a pizza place, but he has much more. He serves pasta, chicken and the best burgers and fries in the entire Las Vegas Valley. His spaghetti and lasagna are very tasty and filling. His pizza has a good crunch to the crust and a sauce with a lot of flavor. Not the best I have ever had, but very, very good. But what Uncle Joe's should be known for is his burgers and fries. The burger has a lot of flavor and is very juicy. The condiments are fresh and the bun it is placed on is lite and fluffy. The fries are nice and crisp and taste just like a fry should taste like. I ran into Uncle Joe's the other day just to get a burger. The price is so low for such high quality. I ordered a double cheese burger and the price was only $4.05 with taxes (prices subject to change).

Uncle Joe's is a little divey place a block or two from the Freemont Street Experience.  It's decent pizza and quite cheap, especially for Vegas.

The positives end there.  I shared a small pepperoni with my wife and it ruined our 4 day weekend in Vegas.  A few hours later, I was as sick as I've ever been.  I literally managed to keep nothing but water down my entire vacation, and basically lacked the energy to leave the room.

A week later, I was still feeling a little queasy.  I've got a pretty strong stomach, but whatever was in this pizza floored me.

I'm suspecting that it may be their pepperoni supplier, because I heard of several other people getting sick in Vegas from pepperoni pizza from different places.

Things change, people move around, we left suburban Henderson to move Downtown. But Joe's continues to be our place.

The pizza is greasy and hot and delicious, the way pizza should be. The meatball subs are huge and saucy. Be prepared to tuck a napkin into your shirt out down your sleeve, if you're eating the pizza.

I didn't discover it until recently myself. Good decision.

Is it mind blowing pizza? Not exactly, and it's not as good as the No-Longer-A-Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo or Pop Up Pizza at the Plaza, but it does it's job as a dive-y pizza joint in the middle of a bar street.

Oh and there's more to it than pizza too. The Stromboli in particular is to die for.

Stays open late.
Option for sobering up.
GREAT stromboli.

The service is good. I'm not sure if he was the owner but he was super friendly, talkative, laid back, and easy going. Loved it! 

Food was really good too! So large in portions!

Just a little shocked and appalled that this was not mentioned in 18 different reviews and a little bitter that I hoofed it down here on Monday, only to be denied.

Anyway, after my usual office food truck (Curbside) threw in the towel because of the rain (who can blame him really... even Slider Truck refused to come out today), I took the opportunity to finally try this restaurant out on a Wednesday at lunch.  I tried the cheese pizza (which is now $5 for 2 slices and a soda) and I just wasn't digging it.  To like this pizza, you have to really like crispy crust pizza.  Like saltine cracker crispy.  If you do, then this is the place for you.  But I'm more of a thin, soft crust gal so it just wasn't working for me.  Plus, the cheese and sauce are not particularly flavorful.  Pizza is such a personal thing, like BBQ.

But this place get stars for atmosphere.  The owner was having a good old time screaming at people, hopefully his children, about various financial matters which was entertaining to say the least.  If you aren't up for this type of authentic Italian atmosphere, then this probably isn't the place for you.  The owner is super nice and friendly, just a little feisty.  It gives me hope for the world and this restaurant.  

Because almost everyone recommended the pizza, I had to try it first.  I will definitely be back for more fun and will try some of the pastas or sandwiches and re-review.

LOCATED in downtown LV in the newer portion of Fremont Street past the light show experience and across Insert Coins.  

Their PIZZA has all the quality's of a thin crust that I love. First, they use just the right amounts of cheese. Let me explain what the right amount of cheese is to me. Other pizza joints will use too little, making the cheese blanket too thin which in turn will cause the tomato sauce to over power, or they will put too much turning the cheese almost to a glue like texture. Here, they use the perfect balance. Second, the crust. OMG the crust the crust. The crust here is light and crispy. If I had to describe it, I would say somewhat similar to a thick potato chip. But not to crispy where it's tough like cardboard either. In comparison to others, most other thin crust pizzas have very soft crust which makes it limp. Which is why you have to fold the pizza in half before you eat it. Now I know what your thinking, that's the way pizza is supposed to be and its nostalgic to eat it like that and so on...and your right but this crust is pretty good too. Last but not least, the pepperoni was crispy like bacon and had the right spice to my liking. The pizza has just the right amount of grease/oil to it but definitely not overflowing.

PRICE is excellent. You can purchase a pretty decent size slice for around 3 to 4 bucks or the whole pie.  

The ENVIRONMENT here is small with only a few tables. So if there is no seats then its best to take your slice to go. 

SERVICE here is good. They don't smile at you when you enter but they do however greet you, take your order, quickly get your slice, and tell you good-bye on the way out. What more can you ask for.  

Overall, I love this place. I will definitely make this place a must stop on every trip and If I lived in LV then I would be picking up pizza from these guys all the time.",v325XGF-l9da74ZMWEjyoA,11,9,5,Vnq_zTtQwO3VlUzPNkbIIQ

I've noticed that the slices you get are not as fresh as the whole pizza and it could be that those slices of pizza have been sitting there for 1 to 2 or 3 hours, who knows?

What I think what's happening behind the scenes is they make a cheese pizza and it just sits there until someone comes along and orders slices and if you want some toppings they just slap them on top of the pizza and then reheat it and that just plain ol' sucks.

Now if your looking for something quick on the go and don't mind eating an hour old reheated pizza then this would be the joint for you. Practically it makes sense that if you order just one slice of  meat topping pizza they woud do it the quickest way possible.

In the evenings you'll find a passionate pizza purveyor working his magic.  Jeff is Sicilian, he's ""from back east"" as our people say, and he puts a little bit of home into each crust, each topping, and in fact each item on the menu.

But there are two reasons I'm giving all 5 (and possibly two more if possible) stars.

1. I asked Jeff about a ""real calzone"" like from back home, he came through and has done so every time since.  We're talking deep-friend, but not baked first.  Ham and cheese, that's what a calzone is, out of the fryer with some sauce.  Done.  

2. My mom was in town for a couple of days and while she's not able to enjoy the full depth and grandeur any longer due to some dietary constraints, Jeff whipped up something delicious anyway.  Maybe that my mom is 100% Italian from back east had something to do with it?  Eh, while Jeff certainly took care of us and they talked about growing up Italian, Jeff is an all-around good guy, and no matter how frazzled he gets he still wants to feed everybody some good stuff, because that's what you do when you're Italian.

Uncle Joe's has been around for a while, Jeff is no small part of the reason.  That's where I go for my pizza and calzone fix...",-hJ9Q0OSYqdOTVBLOMdg7A,2,1,5,zlysQ4yI60iafYn-_GZpAQ

Its definitely one of those hole in the wall places you hate to love.  The place itself is pretty hot and musty, especially in the summer months.  The ventilation must not be very good or something.
