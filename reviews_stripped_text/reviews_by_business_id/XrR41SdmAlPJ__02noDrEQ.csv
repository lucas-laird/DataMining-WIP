After leaving Chilis, I ran some errands inside the airport.  Upon walking by Chilis to my gate, I see this guy peachy and joyful as ever waiting on tables.

504660,2014-10-14,2,XrR41SdmAlPJ__02noDrEQ,"Are you waiting for your flight out of the Las Vegas airport looking for some decent food quick? You are in the WRONG place my friend...

Yesterday my husband and I were exiled to the far distant D gates at McCarron International Airport where we had FORTY minutes until our Delta flight departed. As often happens while air traveling, our meal timing was way off and we were very hungry. We are accustomed to slog through the modern day date rape that is the TSA screening, then relax, have a drink and some food prior to boarding. 

I mean come on...everyone knows that airports nowadays have great dining at super fast speeds to accommodate their customer base - you know...people in a HURRY about to get on PLANES?!?

Well the joke was ON US when we arrived at our gate. Only fast food outlets awaited us and we HATE fast food so we took a deep breath and made our way to the only actual restaurant in that area which was Chili's Too. We could see 3 empty tables, all of them covered with dirty dishes. One very unhurried hostess asked if we wanted a table. Uh...yeah why else are we here? I have never in my life seen a table cleaned off more slowly. We were then seated and provided with a limited menu but some decent looking selections, everything from salads to burgers. Then it happened...

A woman, I assume a waitress, hurriedly passes us by and with a nice smile says the following ""Forty minutes for food.""  Then she took off like a shot, leaving NO time to ask her what on earth that meant. My husband and I looked at each other awkwardly and he said ""It can't possibly be 40 minutes for food. This place is in an airport and its not even that busy"" A couple of minutes later our waitress comes by (we flag her down) 

Here's how it went down:
Husband: ""Is there a wait on food orders""
Waitress: ""Yes 40 minutes""
Husband: ""40 minutes from the time of seating or ordering?""
Waitress: ""It will take at least 40 minutes after you order sir""
Husband: shocked speechless look ""uh....ok...""

We then quickly left and went on to have a disastrous experience at Quiznos, but that's another review (sigh)

Rant: Ok so what part of AIRPORT restaurant does Chili's NOT UNDERSTAND?? Who are your customers? PEOPLE waiting for FLIGHTS who DON'T have that much TIME!! 40 minute waits are not uncommon it appears from reading other scathing yelper reviews here - seriously what the $&%*???

Avoid this place at all costs! If you are unfortunate enough to have to fly out of the D gates of terminal 1 - BRING A SNACK or plan to GO HUNGRY if you want any decent food!",q8OLnD0vkRYif06fhn5rhg,0,1,1,LR4aI_id2kG2TV-E920Wcg

My boyfriend and I were flying home to Salt Lake City from our weekend in Las Vegas and we stopped to eat at Chili's while waiting for our flight. 

1. When we walked up to the hostess stand, the hostess made eye contact, turned and walked away from us with no acknowledgement. Once she returned, she sat us. She sat 3 couples in the tables next to us right after. (important for later)

2. I asked our server what the price range was on the margaritas as they weren't listed on the menu. She responded ""I couldn't tell you. I'm too new"". After waiting 15 seconds, I asked her to find out for me. I watched her fumble on the POS system for 5 minutes before she came back to give me a price. 

3. I ended up ordering a Stella draft beer and my boyfriend ordered a Heineken. The bartender dropped our beers off and said ""Did she check your IDs?"" We answered ""Yes"" and he walked away. When it was served, it didn't taste like a Stella (nor was it in a Stella glass). I took it up to the bartender and told him that I didn't think it was a Stella. He responded saying ""Yeah, I have no idea what I poured you."" 

4. About 15 minutes after placing our ordered, our waitress came back and said ""Did I just have drinks for you guys?"" We were confused as to what she meant so we asked for clarification. She said ""Did you guys just order drinks or did you order food too?"" We said that we did and she said ""Oh okay, I got it"" and then proceeded to go to the POS system to put the order in. The 3 couples who were sat after us had already received their food. 

5. 20 minutes after she realized she didn't put the order in, the ""manager"" brought out our food. We voiced our concerns to him. He said, ""Our POS system has been a little haywire today"" and shook off the fact that the first 45 minutes of our experience had been terrible. He told us he would put a discount on our check. 

6. My fries were cold. There was no temperature in them whatsoever when they were served to me. The chicken looked nothing like the chicken I have previously ordered at Chili's either and I was afraid to eat it. Our server didn't stop back at our table for another 10 minutes. By that time, it wasn't worth it to ask for new fries. We still brought it to her attention.

7. Our waitress dropped our check off. She said ""the manager tried to help out a bit"". I looked at the bill and saw a $2.45 discount (10% off of ONE meal). Our previous bill was $46.00, with the discount they were asking us to pay $44.00. It was completely insulting. My boyfriend found the manager to talk with him again. He relayed all of our issues again. The manager took the receipt out of my boyfriend's hand and ripped it up. He said ""I will pay for it"". He sounded very irritated and demeaning. 

8. After we got back home to Salt Lake City, my boyfriend started vomiting. He continued to vomit for the entire night and slept in the bathroom. He felt better the next day, so we believe it was food poisoning from his burger. 

At no point during our visit here were we looking for free food. The only thing we were looking for was decent service and decent food. We didn't get either of those things. I doubt I will find myself in the Las Vegas airport again in the near future, but if I am I will stay far far away from this Chili's.",DKcHZLnfbzqGJZQCX-za2g,1,0,1,qkqoQ_mJ99EW1SmU1jA7zQ

Let's be honest, nobody expects a mind - blowing experience from a chain restaurant,  so if you have one of these experiences,  it must be attributed to the people working there. 

Hats off to Nicole and whomever is the manager there. 

What follows is not what happened on our visit,  rather how it felt...

I was ushered in with my family in tow and Nicole,  our server,  floated in on a cloud and used her telepathic powers to bring my family drinks, the water was from the east side of a melting glacier, the beer was brewed by a sole Belgian, one glass at a time, and cooled in an Arctic pool.

I cannot remember what we ordered, but I am certain it was consumable food that made everyone better people.  We ate and understood the universe, pairing the the cosmos with the grand terrain of this floating rock we call Earth.  We told Nicole of our familial epiphany, and she nodded with a warm smile.

""That's why I do this...to change lives.""  With that, she teleported to the kitchen right before our eyes.  A warmth enveloped all of us and we reflected on human existence for 37 minutes before driving home.

I woke up the next morning and I am not the same.  I am better.  I will beat on, a boat against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

Disappointing on all counts. 6 choices for breakfast--breakfast burrito, omelette variations, 1 classic breakfast. Coffee $3.39 a cup, served with coffee grounds and one of those flimsy plastic stir sticks. I ask for a spoon, one never appears. This is a restaurant--did someone steal the spoons?? Ordered a veggie frittata sans cheese. This is TexMex but that doesn't mean you spice food up so much your mouth is still burning 10 minutes later. Service was marginal.

It has some tasty breakfast potatoes, which were clearly steak fries seasoned and cut up into bite size pieces.. but hey, they were good! The guacamole was tasty, and included in the price, not extra (looking at you Chipotle). I feel like it was a great, solid breakfast before heading onto a 3 hour flight.",zNMYEX6gKpYeVb80ce5F8A,0,0,4,zdNLNBRPGNsYwv10JZ4kOg
5674409,2014-10-28,0,XrR41SdmAlPJ__02noDrEQ,"Not a great first impression.

Of course, I stopped in here hoping to grab a quick breakfast before my flight.  The place was not busy and I was looking to sit at the bar.  There were no open stools, so the hostess sat me right near the bar and told me my server would be right with me.

I sat there for close to 15 minutes and was never approached or even acknowledged.  I ended up walking out, still hungry and waiting by my gate until my flight boarded.

That is unacceptable! The place seemed to be fully staffed, yet they just let people walk in and out.  There are other options in the airport and I will avoid this place the next time I fly out.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,0,0,1,ndg1WZW7PNYRtJ_w2tP5RQ

4 beers, 3rd beer the guy gives me a glass with lipstick and other smudges of grime on it)
To my admission, I didn't notice until 4 or 5 sips in and try to be discreet about this clown giving a beer in a dirty glass.   Fred, we're not asking you to sling quality/signature mixed drinks.  Obviously beers in a clean glass is a tall task for this old fella.

It took 20 minutes to see a server and we ordered immediately. 45 minutes into the wait for a burger, I asked them to box the order so we could board our flight. Most of the order was wrong, all of it was cold, and no one apologized. For an airport location, I would expect service in under an hour.

Hint: the people who eat and drink tend to have higher tabs, and higher tips!  Food was mediocre and not quite the same as regular Chilis.  Menu was abridged as well.  I thought I was eating on one tier above the sketchy fast food places in the terminal but apparently this place is no better... they just have alcohol and a server that you have to tip.",Q4Qfu-3vYtL1LRm2X1b0Gg,0,0,1,QLYQvvqXT5cX66EN5g5N8g
5880140,2014-11-06,0,XrR41SdmAlPJ__02noDrEQ,"Expect mediocore airport quality service and food choices. It's been a long time since I've been to Chili's and so I'm not sure if this is what one would normally expect from Chili's nowadays, but I remember my experience being quite different in the past. Service is moderately slow (so don't come if you are in a hurry for your flight). Menu is much more limited than as stated on Yelp. Food is expensive and they are chincy. I got all of 4 pieces of sliced (shouldn't it be shredded?) chicken breast on my nachos and a small dollop of guacamole, each for about $2 extra a piece. Music is irritating and loud. I haven't received the bill yet for my nachos and margarita but I'm thinking $30-35 not including tip. BUT this is in an airport and so considering the alternatives....this isn't bad. (If you look at the other Yelp reviews for McCarran, you'll notice similar low ratings for most of the restaurants). On the bright side, there is a full bar with 4 TVs, they let you stay a long time at your table without hurrying you, the service is not attentive but not neglectful either (I got a nice bowl of salsa when I asked for it), and  the seasoning on the freshly fried tortilla chips is TDF (is that an acceptable and understandable abbreviation?). Margarita is so-so which really sums up my experience here....",4bQqil4770ey8GfhBgEGuw,0,0,3,hZDQi4vcyjTpPHpgFtjKFA
