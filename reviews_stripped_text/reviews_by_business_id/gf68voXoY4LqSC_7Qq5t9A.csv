Now some major complaints: inconsistency and lack of concern. My angel hair pasta with scallops was bland and watery. The scallops were poorly seared and I could easily tell that they weren't even seasoned. I went over to try my sister's plate since she had the same order; it was definitely better. Why the inconsistency? I notified the waitress about my dish expecting an apology at the very least. She gave an apathetic, ""oh really?"" instead.

The bread bowl it comes in is dry and old.  The steamed mussels and clams is terrible.  It also came with a dry, stale piece of bread.  The fried clams were even worse.  The clams were all lumped up and stuck together and the batter was gross.  White Castle even does a better fried clams. 

I had the linguini with clams with a few pieces of small, whole clams and a watery, soup like sauce.  Your average NY pizza joint does it better.  

The only thing that I enjoyed was my margarita.

165837,2012-09-26,2,gf68voXoY4LqSC_7Qq5t9A,"What an epic fail... where to even begin? We were drawn to try this place because of their grand opening promotion of BOGO entrees valid on Mon. Tue, Wed thru 10/10/12. After being seated, it took over 15 minutes for our server to come by and even offer us glasses of water. We showed her the promotional coupon and asked if we could order 4 entrees between the 3 of us, and she answered yes, we would get the 2 least expensive entrees free. We decided to go with a bread bowl of clam chowder ($9), 2 orders of the fish & chips ($18 each), crab louie entree salad ($17), and linguine with clam sauce ($17), and later on key lime and apple pies for dessert ($7 each).

For some reason they thought it would be acceptable to combine both orders of the fish & chips onto one plate, but we got jipped because there was only 1 small order's worth of fries. We decided not to make a fuss over it. There were 6 pieces of beer battered fish altogether. Unfortunately the batter was very thick and greasy yet also soggy on the bottom. After my first piece, I couldn't take it anymore and ended up peeling off almost all of the batter from subsequent pieces. The mediocre tartar sauce was too runny and lacked enough acidity to balance out the mayonnaise.

As for the salad, the crab meat contained several small shell fragments and was flavorless. Our friend thought his clam chowder was so-so, and it didn't appear creamy enough. Also, the bacon overpowered the clam flavor. The linguine was ok, but nothing memorable.

Desserts were meh. Our key lime pie was dominated by whipped cream. The key lime part was more like mousse, and the flavor was far too subtle. The pie crust was quite thick and somewhat soggy. Our friend didn't even finish his apple pie, and it wasn't because he was full. 

As for service, this is where it gets interesting. As soon as we received our entrees, our server asked us how the food was, when it was obvious that we hadn't even touched our food yet. We answer that we just got our food, and she replied that she would be back to check on us, which she never did until we were almost done eating our entrees. My water glass remained empty for over 10 minutes before it was refilled. At another point, she came by and put her water pitcher down on the table and asked if we were interested in dessert. We said sure. She ignored my more than half empty water glass and picked her water pitcher back up and left to get the dessert menus. When she returned with the menus about 10-15 minutes later and eventually returned to take our order after another 10-15 minutes, my water glass still was not refilled. In fact, my glass was never refilled after that first time and remained near empty. Finally, we flag her down and ask for the check. Eventually, she brings the check, but says she can't apply the promotional BOGO discount until we give her the coupon. We tell her we already gave you the coupon when we placed our order. She mumbles something while leaving me the bill and takes off. At this point, I'm not sure what is going on. Was she expecting me to give her my credit card before seeing the corrected bill? Several minutes later, she comes back and grabs the check from me with no explanation. She reprocesses the bill, but it only shows one discounted entree instead of two. When I point this out, she says that we only got 3 entrees: 2 fish & chips and a linguine with clam sauce. We tell her we also got the crab louie entree-sized salad. She mumbles something about double checking the menu. Eventually she comes back and says that the manager told her to apply the second discount. However, when she hands me the check, it is somebody else's check with their credit card! I hadn't even given her my credit card yet. She didn't realize her mistake until I pointed that out. While we await her return for the umpteenth time, we ponder whether she is on drugs or just really really stupid. After another 10 minutes or so, I am able to take care of the check and finally get out of there. Starting to notice a pattern? The time between when our server would check on us was long and it added up. We were there almost 2 hours because of the interminably slow service.

To summarize, their food is sub-par and pricey for what you get, and the abysmal service is some of the worst I've experienced in a long while. Stay away, or don't say I didn't warn you!",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,6,2,1,8lg59ND9mCzSQiVp2PhKww

Let me start with the staff- we always sat at the bar and got to know most of the guys. Frank was probably who we spent the most time with- he was great- good bartender and could put a smile on people's faces! But everyone was nice and friendly and knew their cocktails. 
We had a 2 for 1 coupon so we wanted dinner- I had the Rainbow Trout - blackened with rice pilaf and veggies (Brussel sprouts and broccoli). The trout was cooked perfectly- flaky and tender and moist- it was yummy! My husband had the Cajun Seafood Pasta and was thrilled with it. The shrimp were huge in it! Nice spicy kick- but not overwhelming.  Our second meal- I ordered Blackened Striped Sea Bass with Etouffee which was a very nice mix of seafood and a great spicy brown sauce. My husband had the Lobster Burrito and was very happy with that- I don't think he shared a bite! 
We sat at the bar watching several people next to us eat a lot of different things- the Lobster Mac n Cheese was a big hit, the Ahi Tuna Poke, the Lobster Cobb and the crab- the Snow and the King- I heard no one complain or even say eh- so-so. Everyone said their food was very good!  
You may be able to find a 2 for 1 so it makes it a great value as well! They have Happy Hour Specials 4-6PM and 10PM- close- so it is nice to not pay huge prices for cocktails. It is a must stop.",HHcEzPaZxuBS0n7R5SgZug,2,0,5,e6jxE_93AsxkGij850eIjw

I wasn't sure if it was because of my groupon or because it was actually true, but when I ordered the seafood shack clam bake (that was supposed to include a whole maine lobster, clams, mussels, prawns, and sausage), the waiter informed us that they were out of lobsters and mussels - what seafood restaurant would be out of not one, but two types of seafood? He informed that they could substitute lobster for crab legs and the mussels for additional clams. We weren't picky so we said that was fine. When the clam bake came, the flavours were pretty good, but the seafood didn't taste very fresh, and the clams were overcooked and shriveled up.

Appetizer-wise, we started with the lobster stuffed mushrooms and the fried clams. The mushrooms came out on a sizzling baking dish with bubbling mornay sauce. The filling actually had some texture to it from the shrimp that was also in there along with the lobster, unlike a lot of generic mushroom filling. The rich mornay sauce was a really nice contrast to the clean mushroom flavor. And you can't argue with fried clams. Especially when they were fresh - no sogginess inside from canned clams here!

We split the clam bake for two, banking on the fact that it wouldn't be that big since the appetizers were plenty large. We were wrong. There were two lobster tails along with clams, mussels, shrimp and several whole sausages. Plus potatoes and corn AND a side of coleslaw. This also came with a side of the same mornay sauce that the stuffed mushrooms had been in. Everything was delicious and unlike plenty of so-called seafood restaurants that cook the heck out of everything, nothing was overdone.

16oz Steak - to my surprise the lobster cream spinach is really, really good! I first thought it is spinach cooked with lobster sauce, but there are actual lobster meat in it, like a lot of them too! (My bf is allergic to seafood so I swap my rice with his spinach :D)

-1 star: Service - seems a bit slow, plus the waiter never checked on us until the end of the meal but he did check up other tables (across of us) several times, I guess because we only ordered 1 beer and we don't look rich compare to the other table? LOL~

Had dinner ala Groupon. Very clean, pleasant staff, quick service, great quality and quantity of well prepared food.

We started with a half dozen very cold, thick, and flavorful Oysters on the Half shell. They came with a champagne slush that was mixed with a spicy sauce. Topping the oysters with this was fantastic!! Each oyster with the slush was cold, mildly spicy, and extremely flavorful. I should have ordered a dozen oysters and a quart of that champagne slush. We also had a white wine steamed mix of mussels and clams. This offering came hot and plentiful. Plump mussels and clams in a great broth. The garlic points that were with the bowl were not enough to dunk up all the broth. I will ask for more toast next time.

My Wife and I are confirmed ""Food Sinners"". I could care less how terrible fried food is for me. It is worth your life here in the desert to get a decent Jersey Shore fried Seafood Dinner. Well, we found a place that knows how to do it. This TI Seafood Shack does a fried seafood platter that would get the blessing of Captain Nemo himself. The plate contained big portions of thick white fish that was fried to perfection along with shrimp and scallops, all big and all very fresh. Hey, we are NOT talking   pre-frozen stuff here, we are talking boat to belly fresh. Cole slaw, fresh French fries, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce rounded the whole thing out. When we were done eating, there was no film of grease on the plate. Each piece of fried seafood had only the fresh fried taste of that variety of ocean denizen it was. There was no grease on our hands and no greasy smell either. The white wine by the glass and my very cold beer added to the pleasure of this meal.

Libby had a piece of key lime pie for dessert. The pie was chiffon type, not that jello like stuff you tend to get in this area. It was tall, limey zippy, and sweet. I had to fight her for a couple tastes by the fork full. (Wives are not allowed to refuse Husbands tastes).

I did have a coffee and EL Wife-O had hot tea. By the time we left I felt a lot like a bowling ball. 

The service, food and casual atmosphere in the Seafood Shack are just what most of us want when we need to get to the show or on to the gaming tables. This is great food at a reasonable price.

I found the menu to be suprisingly lengthy.  There is everything from Long John Silver's type fried fare to Cioppino and salad Nicoise.

I chose the Cioppino ($25) which was pretty tasty.  The broth was flavorful but, unfortunately, the accompanying seafood was a bit overcooked.  They also skimped  on the clams and mussels.  But, in a jam, I would order this again.  Honestly, I found this Cioppino as good as RM Seafood's. 

I also tried the lobster mac and cheese side that came with the Cioppino for $6.95 more.  Total disappointment.  Bland, bland, bland and tiny, tiny pieces of lobster.  Not worth the price or the calories.

I found it a bit odd that they didn't provide bread with the meal considering the entrees are a bit pricey.  If you're gonna charge fancy prices, step up the game!

It was Friday evening at 7ish and the place was not busy at all and we were seated instantly. The decor and chalkboard signs I thought were pretty cool.

I've decided not to order an appetizer so I may have some room for a desert. I was craving for some seafood, spice and heat. So when I saw the Cajun Seafood Pasta for $24.95, it was a match made in heaven! Today was my cheat day and I could not wait for my meal to come!

When my meal came, presentation was well executed! Unfortunately, that's all the positive thing I can share with my meal. By far, this is my least favorite cajun pasta I have ever tasted!

Improvements needed:
* Great tasting cajun seasoning and good balance of heat explode in your HAPPY mouth! Not with this cajun seafood pasta! You be the judge :)
* This pasta to me was bland that desperately needed more cajun seasoning.
* I was very disappointed that the veggies were barely cooked celery, red peppers, and onions. The seafood and the creamy sauce were average.
* The toasted bread with grilled marks was a total failure! The bread was days old! The taste and texture were totally ""toasted""!
* The chocolate cake was just average. The cake was not that moist. The fudge icing on the other hand, was rich and not too sweet. 

Overall, the staff was attentive and friendly. No doubt this place has a lot of potential, but needs a lot of improvement. However, I am not rushing to go back. There are too many choices in Vegas that serves great quality of food. Check out their menu:

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was something one would find in a cheesy seafood eatery on a Carnival cruise ship. My first thought was the sad bar they had at the front. When I have my seafood, I usually like to have a good quality beer with my meal. My first expectation of any expensive burger or seafood joint is a nice selection of brews on tap. Seafood Shack had only 4. No Guiness, Sam Adams, or Bass  for me. I stay away from the Budweiser, Miller, and other cheap beers.

Second, me and my brother ordered the clam chowder sourdough bread bowl. The soup had more ham flavor than clam. Personally, Progresso's clam chowder soup straight from the can tastes fresher than the soup we got. For $9, I'll stick to the clam chowder soup at Panera Bread.

We also ordered the fried calamari appetizer. For $12 dollars, I was expecting a decent platter to pass around. The portion size was quite pathetic and the batter for the calamari greasy and thin. For the same price, one can go to an Olive Garden and get 5-6 times the amount of calamari. When a pound of fresh squid can be had for under $5 at any seafood market, charging $12 for the 4-5 bite size portions we received was nothing short of a ripoff.

The main entrée I ordered was the fish and chips with scallops and shrimp. The portion size was average with the amount of fries quite low. The amount of fries compares to a McDonalds small to medium. The fish, shrimp, and scallops were cooked well but not worth $20. For $21, I can get a large fish and chips entree, an appetizer sampler of calamari, scallops, and shrimp, a fish taco, and coleslaw at the Pacific Fish grill restaurant at my local shopping center.

With the $400 plus bill my family had, we all could have gone to the Rio's seafood buffet instead. For seafood and beer not near the beach, I'll stick to Joe's Crabshack.

Of course we started with an app, the Salad Nicoise.  I felt that it was very well made.  If you are a fan of olives, you will enjoy this bad boy.  My buddy and I did feel that the salt may have gotten away from the chef.  Over salted, but I didn't mind too much (maybe to request less salt next time).  The tuna was soft and you could taste the pepper snear.  Love the buttered bread they had on the side of the plate, but it gets soggy with the salad.  Our main course was the Clam Bake! That's right, go big or go home.. I thought it was very well made and presented.  I ordered a side of garlic fries to sweeten my meal.  Great addition.  Clams were huge and plenty of mussels.  Some sausages and corn.  The lobster was well baked in there and the sauce was just right.  Not over powering and I did not die of thirst = not much sodium! Bam!  I ended up having to ask for a togo box.. Sadly we lost.  

I had some desert, the carrot cake.  I have got to say, more carrot taste and less frosting.  I don't how everyone else likes it, but I prefer less frosting on anything.  Cake came out and it looked like an ice cream sandwich.  Pretty decent sized.  

Our server, very nice gentlemen.  Right out, he asked for our drink order, then came back several minutes later and asked for our app and came back later once again and asked for our main order.  Nice guy, came back with some bibs for our main entree and the table was prep with wet naps.  He came back with my refill before slurping the bottom.  He was on top of things, even my togo boxes, he made sure to double my box in case some of the sauce slipped through the first one.  

Environment, Great looking.  I thought it looked a bit Japanses from the top.  I like how it was secluded from the casino.  People dont watch you as they walk by.  Privacy! I like to lick my fingers! Don't judge me! 

Overrall I will come back.  There are plenty of other things to try and I would like to see if anything would change to add a start.. Hopefully not to take away one.",yobIvoK2taIhooUPSrjuiQ,4,1,4,RkkpwkxIWENKgRnSMHC-wQ

We started out with the shrimp ceviche and crab cakes, we figured we couldn't go wrong with those orders.  To my surprise, these dishes blew my mind.  It wasn't just like any ordinary shrimp ceviche or crab cake, it was absolutely phenomenal. You can just taste the freshness of the shrimp and crab. We loved every last bite.

For my entree, I had the grilled shrimp and scallops special.  Again, I was very impressed with the fresh quality of food.  And the presentation was very detailed.

The manager, Matt, even came by our table to check on us and we ended up chatting with him for a few minutes. He was extremely kind. And so was our server, Kelly.

Okay - confession. My hubs and I totally look for new places to try out in town on Eater Vegas. One of the more anticipated openings this month was Seafood Shack which replaced Isla, the Mexican restaurant in TI. So we checked out there website which advertised the BOGO entree promotion. SOLD! (I can't help it, I'm Asian and I can't help a good deal). We were going the first Tuesday of the grand opening.

So we were getting a table of 3 and I was the first to arrive. I got seated around 6:15 and waited for the rest of the party to arrive. The bus girl comes by, fills the water and leaves me alone. Fine. 

As my party trickles in, I still had no idea who my server was. By this time, it's around 6:50 before she decides to saunter to our table and even acknowledge our presence. Dead serious. No asking if I wanted a drink, no wondering if I wanted to order an appy or anything. Yeah. It was that bad.

I was watching her like a hawk too - she literally disappeared for a significant portion of the time unlike the other servers around the restaurant. We literally saw her once to take our order, once when our entrees came (she asked us how they were when we didn't even get a chance to take a bite), once to take the dessert order (which I had to flag her down -- she mumbled under her breath ""in a minute"") and three times finally to get our bill right.

Yeah, you guys heard me. Three fr$%king times to get the bill right. (She lost our BOGO coupon, neglected to take off a discounted item, gave us another person's bill -- I could've taken off with another dude's credit card --- yeah... that bad). That added another 30 minutes of playtime at the Seafood Shack.I was beginning to think it should be renamed Seafood Inn because at the rate we were going, I thought we might have to sleep in our chairs. We were stranded there for 2 hours. God forbid if you actually had show or something to catch.

Already the service (or lack thereof) would be enough to detract most people. Add to the fact that the food was subpar at best made the insult even more pronounced.

I ordered a crab louie salad which is not difficult to do well as long as the ingredients are good. The crab meat was severely below expectations. The crab was all macerated, and lacked the sweetness good quality meat. Added to the fact that there were bits of the clear shell and outer shell pieces mixed in, it was no es bueno. Throw in a few meally tomatoes and some rather generic thousand island dressing, you have yourself a sh*(ty experience for $16.95.

We ordered 2 orders of the fish and chips ($17.95) which were put apparently on the same plate for reasons unknown. That was annoying because we were out with a friend and he obviously didn't want to eat off of our plates. Plus, they only provided half of the serving of chips but double the fries. Not that the fries were that great to begin with but come on! The fish itself was greasy, overly battered and quite frankly nothing I would order again. Again, the tartar sauce was some generic stuff you could get at any grocery market.

Our pal ordered a clam chowder (comes in a bread bowl -$8.95) and the linguine with clams ($16.95) but neither was anything special according to him.

By now, I should have known better and quit while I was ahead. However, I am a sucker for key lime pie and noticed it was on the menu. So thinking that there had to be some sort of redeeming quality about this establishment, I ordered that to share with the hubs while our pal got an apple pie a la mode ($6.95 each).

Okay - let me get this straight - if your key lime pie is f%^king lime green, you know it came out of a box and that there's no freaking way there's any sort of real lime in there let alone, key limes. The oh-so soggy crust accompanied by the rather solid bright green filling from a generic Jello box was a full on textural assault and violation. Would not do this again. I noticed as well, our friend's apple pie - he left most of his pie crust on his plate and it looked like a limp doughy mass.

In general, I do not have a lot of one star reviews and I really hate writing one unless it is really really bad on all fronts. However, Seafood Shack - you've just +1'ed yourself in my 1 star club. (1 star review).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,14,8,1,HgVGvRMnGjCYIEyhKj5vIg

Pretty mediocre, particularly when you consider how many amazing food options there are on The Strip. My friend and I dined at Seafood Shack before catching Cirque du Soleil Mystère. We mostly picked this place because it was convenient to the theater in Treasure Island but, in the future, I would have an earlier dinner and pick a better spot.

There was nothing inherently bad about our visit. We sat at the bar with the intention of enjoying happy hour but ended up not doing so anyway. I wanted a simple glass of wine but their happy hour drinks were all beer and wells. The bartender was super, super friendly, regardless.

Our food was pretty meh. My friend had the Lobster Beignets. She wasn't impressed and she was pretty sure later on in the evening they were the cause of her feeling pretty sick. I had the Shrimp and Avocado Salad. Nothing spectacular. A salad with shrimp, avocado, and various other mixings. I didn't love it.

I recommend passing on this place. It's isn't inherently awful but there are so many better options in this city. You can do much better.",HFWckxypPmpvmWMURRo1rA,4,1,2,V4a1PIsE4T_ng_Q61o0gIw

We started off with the calamari appetizer and it was average. I've had better and I've had worse. The major plus of this choice was that they definitely didn't skimp out on the portions. My boyfriend and I typically finish off a whole appetizer but we had plenty to spare with this one. 

Next I had the linguine and clams. There was a heaping amount of pasta and about 5 big clams in it. While there were only a few big clams they didn't skimp out on putting a bunch of little clams throughout it, which I actually liked better. I would definitely go back to this place just for this dish alone.

since we were staying at Treasure Island, we were given a 2-for-1 cocktail voucher to use here which is awesome!

It took about 5 minutes for the bartenders to notice me and I wasn't even in a hidden spot or anything.

The experience started with NO HOST at the entrance -- hmm, are we suppose to seat ourselves? But why do they have a host booth? Finally someone came to help us get settled. I requested for a table with booth since our kids manage to fall off any regular chair whenever we're at a restaurant coz of their non-stop playing while waiting for the food. The spacing between tables were TOO CLOSE. You could literally hear the next table's conversation even if you don't intend to do so. We were given menu but the waiter too forever to get our order because he was too busy flirting with a bunch of customers who came in way later than we did. When he did finally get our order, he was in so much hurry. I had to ask him to repeat what I said just to make sure he got what I ordered. 
The waiting time was OKAY. But guess what, the other table who came later & ordered later than we did GOT THEIR FOOD FIRST! Really dude?! Really..I wanna just get up and leave but I we waited too long & too hungry to leave. Thinking the food was gonna be good, we stayed -- but IT WAS A DISASTER!! Man! We should've just walked away!! My pasta was too salty & the steak was too tough. Our son's tilapia with pilaf rice & the 2 dozen raw oysters were the only decent food on the table. I am never going back again.

We had purchased a $20 Groupon for $40 off of the bill without restrictions. (We have a strong preference for Groupons that do not restrict the selection). We had two cocktails each, shared two appetizers, an order of blackened crab legs, and desserts.

Our server (Fernando) was very professional! Throughout the meal, he provided just the right amount of attention! Likewise, the General Manager (Matt) stopped by our table and was very gracious.

The cocktails were perfect. My date had a couple of Super Mojitos and I had two martinis. They were tasty and served quickly after ordering. 

Our appetizers were the seafood stuffed mushrooms and crab cakes. Both appetizers were freshly prepared and served on hot plates.  We shared an order of blackened crab legs which were extraordinarily good. This was plenty of food for the two of us.

For example, on the night we ate here we stopped by to ask what our coupon would pay for. The hostess confirmed what it covered and we went upstairs to get changed. When we got back down about twenty minutes later we were informed there was a one-hour wait. It would have been helpful if the hostess had let us know that the wait was one-hour the first time I spoke with her so that we could put our name on the list. 

Then, we sat down at the bar and played the machines while we waited for drinks and dinner. When we were charged for our drinks I asked the bar tender if drinks were complimentary because we were gambling. (This is standard in Vegas, and the couple next to us confirmed their drinks were free. They had put in 20s and were ""pretending to play"" so they could get their drinks for free.) The bar tender very curtly responded, ""They're free if you're following the rules."" I asked what the rules are and he responded, ""Look"" as he pointed to my machine. There was no sign on my machine explaining any rules, which he saw, and so he pointed to the sign on another machine and said, ""You have to bet at least $1 every single time to get a free drink,"" though the sign said ""an average bet of $1."" I didn't want to argue, but it was quite rude and stingy, in my opinion.

I purchased a Groupon not knowing how this place would be, but I'm very glad that I did.  The portions they give are generous and price is reasonable. 

I had the clam chowder in a bread bowl with garlic fries on the side.  I definitely did not need the extra fries because my boyfriend ordered some lobster roll and it came with garlic fries. My eyes were big when I ordered haha.  Also, we had this friendly Asian waitress that was working by herself, yet she always came at the right times. I was surprised at the awesome service this lady gave us.  She delivered our food in a timely manner, helped us with the menu, and even suggested my lemonade alcoholic beverage.  I loved it btw.

So we started on the wrong foot coming into the restaurant, we saw no hostess and decided to seat ourselves. Wrong move... They moved us.(our fault we came in the back way)
Ok so let's start this correctly now. We were seated in Fernando's section. He's very friendly and inviting, we'll come back to him later. We ordered our drinks and took our time checking over the menu. My daughter decided to get adventurous and ordered the shack burger. I know right a kid having a burger for the forth day in a row... Who knew?
My wife finally decided on the herb and Parmesan crusted tilapia. The fish was cooked perfectly, the rice pilaff was delicious and the vegetables were tender and tasty.
I decided on the coconut shrimp platter. The shrimp was delicious and cooked perfectly, the coleslaw was almost as good as the shrimp. I'm starting to get sick of fries. Needless to say I'm not taking responsibility for the fact that I didn't eat all my fries.
Dessert time arrived and my wife ordered the key lime pie with a tea. I finally took the plunge and ordered a mojito. Nothing special just the traditional mojito. I also had the key lime pie. The pie was fantastic! A dessert lovers paradise. It had no chocolate but with a pie that fantastic chocolate isn't needed. The marshmallow topping was a bit much for me though. For a place that advertises that it's a mojito bar I think it's a must try. 
So Fernando, what a class act! He was great! I can say without a doubt that he was the nicest person we've met in this whole hotel. He was patient while we looked at all our choices. There was was no rush at anytime from him. He checked up on us during dinner asking if anything was needed. The rest of the meal he left us alone and reminded us that if there was anything extra at anytime he would be happy to help. The meal finished and as busy as he was... Keep in mind this restaurant was full and only Fernando and one other man were working the floor. We were stuffed and hardly able to move in our chairs, he was happy to accommodate us in the dessert, tea and mojito. He was such a friendly warm person we tipped fantastically and he was worth every penny of it. As well we wrote on the receipt about how pleased we were with him. Hopefully management sees the comment from us. At this point I think our sever Fernando was even better than the meal we had.

3971700,2015-06-26,6,gf68voXoY4LqSC_7Qq5t9A,"*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2015 menu ***

I had an early reservation here because I was going to see Mystère after dinner and I wanted to give myself plenty of time.  I was seated in short order and was brought menus and water.  I ordered iced tea and that was quickly brought, too.

My server took my order.  I then sat for twenty minutes and no lobster beignets were brought.  At the end of that that twenty minutes, a runner appeared with the beignets in a cast iron container.  The container was not hot and the beignets were not hot.  There was some lobster in the beignets.  There was a fair amount of filler, but I expected that given the price.  Before I was finished with my appetizer, I was brought my main course, the Cajun seafood pasta.  This has become a theme during my Restaurant Week meals--courses that run into one another because someone is not paying attention.  I think the beignet was done and was sitting under a heat lamp somewhere and someone realized I hadn't gotten mine yet.  If it took them twenty minutes to make the beignets, that was 16 minutes too long.  

The Cajun seafood pasta is described on the menu as ""linguine tossed with shrimp, crawfish, crab, Cajun sausage.""  There was little Cajun flavor.  There were a fair number of shrimp and a little crab, but I tasted nothing to indicate the sausage rounds were anything near Cajun.  It was regular sausage with not much flavor.  In the end, the pasta would best be described as just OK.

Dessert was certainly the star of this meal.  The individual carrot cake was quite tasty and the portion was very large.  The one drawback was the marzipan carrot--it was so hard I could have hurt someone if I through this at them.

Service was less than OK.  I've mentioned the run on courses above so I won't belabor that point.  This was an OK place to try during RW, but it's not somewhere I'd return.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,6,2,UvfYJ3w1mYJEkLSlOmyV7Q

The food was great but the service was slow! I had the Fish and Chips... I think they were still trying to catch the cod fish or something... the wait was ridicuously 30 min long that we almost walked out of there... they should know that it's Las Vegas and people flock to restaurants and opt to dine out especially on a weekend so they should be prepared and have a full staff especially when there's an event going on in Vegas... luckily, we still made it out on time for the main event at Mandalay Bay... I guess I can't complain much, this was a Groupon deal, which I should've printed, the app took forever to come up (signal is low inside the restaurant) Boo! :(

This restaurant is located in the Treasure Island Casino and open only for dinner... we tried eating there for lunch. Bar was open though...

Let's just say I used both of these in the same meal and had 2 $35 entrees and 2 $10 cocktails for $50 pre-tip. I thought I couldn't handle it so I texted some friends saying they should join if they come by in time. Good thing they didn't because I devoured it all.

The Lobster Stuffed Salmon was really good and I would definitely recommend getting it, as long as you aren't on a no carb diet like my friend. Sucker. I got the New England style Pan Roast as my second dish and it was good, but not worth its $35 price tag in terms of quantity. But with the coupon it's not bad.

Drink recommendation per the waiter was Blackbeard's Love Potion, which he said sounds/looks deceiving because it is pure alcohol. Tastes sweet but has only alcohol in it.

Oh I also added a key-lime pie to top it off, which is worth trying as well! I would have gone for the carrot cake but I felt that going into the 3000 calorie range for one meal would be a bit excessive. Next time.",RGrDTsVmcUBCOUOn49y-wg,4,5,4,cxKtgZzmO8G8_jXJAJV0qA

The food I give a mixed review and the service was average. We had a waitress that was helping our waiter and she was very confused and made some of us feel very annoyed. She kept bringing food to the table and then realizing it was for another table and then picking it up and taking it away and did this 3 times. She also was not friendly and did not even speak to anyone to explain her actions. She had a scowl on her face that was unpleasant. The waiter was good but we had to ask for refills and he could have been better at monitoring the needs of our table.  THE FOOD:  We had appetizers that were very good. The Calamari was excellent tasting and fried to perfection, However the Tomato Basil sauce was not a good fit for the Calamari dip.  The Lobster and Crabmeat stuffed Mushrooms was also excellent and the Mornay sauce inside was perfect. For a main course I had the Cajun Seafood Pasta.

A cajun dish would have more Crawfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage that are cut in bigger pieces and this dish contained two very thin cut pieces of a western sausage.  The aromatic vegetables green bell pepper, onion, and celery were overcrowding the dish and there was no flavor of cajun spices. It actually upset my stomach. My wife had the Grilled Salmon with vegetables and rice.  The Salmon was cooked to perfection and tasted great. The brussel sprouts were very bitter and someone did not have any idea how to cook them. The rice was cooked well.

Since it is only about 200 feet from the showroom inside the Treasure Island Casino/Hotel it was very convenient. Before getting to the restaurant I must inject that the Treasure Island does not charge for parking which is a big plus. Many hotels on the strip now charge for parking and as Las Vegas residents we almost never go near the strip because of the paid parking situation. I know the hotels must think this is a great revenue source but they have lost our business and that of many other people we talk to.  So, the fact that Treasure Island does not charge for parking is huge, at least to me. Anyway, back to the food. The Seafood Shack has a nice décor, nothing fancy but very appropriate. The service was excellent and efficient. I had the Pan Roast with scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, and half a lobster. It came in a cream sauce. It was delicious but cracking the lobster claw was a little messy so be prepared. The rice pilaf was as good as I have ever had. The ""seasonal vegetable"" was broccoli and it was undercooked for my taste. Where it had been cut at the stalk it was ""dark"" which makes me believe it had been cut a day or two before. It was edible but just didn't give off a great appearance/presentation. My wife had the Lobster Cobb Salad which she really enjoyed. We asked our server whether the lobster would be claw meat of tail and he wasn't sure but thought it was claw meat. When it came it looked more like Langostino meat based on size and color. We had a Strawberry Shortcake dessert and it was good. We aren't drinkers so our two dinners, one dessert and one coffee came out at about $83. Add a 20% tip and we got out at just barely under $100. Everything we looked at as the servers walked by looked good. Overall this is not an ""OMG I can't wait to go there again!"" type place.

*Blackened Chicken- came out piping hot and moist
*Seafood Pasta- lots of pieces of crawfish and shrimp in a creamy sauce

2. Cajun seafood pasta (19) 
for $12 (used the Groupon deal $20 for $40)  

- Inside T.I. Look for a bar and a ship along the side. 
- Similar to Joe's crab shack, but not shack looking. 
- Quick seating and fast service. Greeted by the hostess. We got seated right away and was assisted by the waiter a few moments later. Another served us our water. We ordered right away and literally got our food in less then 10min. Amazing! Suspiciously, too fast, yet the food was fresh! 
- Fisherman's platter consisted of 2 scallops, 2 fish fillets, and a few fried shrimp, served with a side of cole slaw and fries. The platter tasted pretty good, not too remarkable though. 
-The Cajun seafood pasta was delicious. I was a bit afraid that it would taste too spicy, but it wasn't. There were pieces of crawfish and 2 that still in its shell and enough shrimp. It came with a side of garlic bread too. 
- They tax after they take off the 40 off, meaning that your bill is a whole lot cheaper!

Walking up to the actual restaurant, it looks like it's a really small bar so I was quite puzzled. But come to find out the Host led us into the back where there was an actual restaurant setting. They really went with the theme. From the walls, tables, chairs right down to the lobster-like claw salt & pepper shakers. It's actually really cute.

I had the Mermaid Mojito to start off which is a mojito with strawberries in it. The drink was pretty big but I didn't even get a hint of a buzz so either my tolerance went up because I consumed more alcohol while in Vegas or the bartender was sheisty. I go with option 2, just sayin'

Had the Angel Hair Pasta (No meat for Lent) which is pasta with tomatoes, garlic, basil & olive tapenade. It was not too bad, I have no complaints since I finished the whole thing. So I guess you can say their serving sizes are just right, they don't want to have to roll you out after eating there ;)

The service was awesome well, I guess the only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that the Host I guess kept checking us out & walking by at random times just to stare.

Our waiter was also very very friendly and accommodating even when my dad was asking for his 7th bottle of beer. I wish I remembered the waiters name, but he definitely gave us a lot of attention!
We stayed there for a long time just chit chatting and never felt rushed. 

This was on the last day of our trip, wish we could've gave them a chance earlier!",F_e8O1XPYf7kTNdp1-Jscg,3,0,5,NZSzBxdEjnZt3JmzDHFT-Q
