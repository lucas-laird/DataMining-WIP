Holy. Moly. Beyond delicious, BEYOND! 

Haha, but in all seriousness the chicken wings are perfect. A delicious sauce and slight crunch, yet perfectly tender. I've been scarred for life - all other chicken wings pale in comparison.

Now, the Kobe burger...it's like butta. Juicy, tasty, mouthwatering good. It's not very big, but it so filling. The boy and I always have to split it in two. 

The last time I was there I also got the pumpkin ravioli...I think.... Well, obviously it was forgettable and not amazing. I do recall it being good, but it might as well have tasted like cardboard alongside the wings and burger.

I would like to say that the last time we were here the service was lacking to say the least. It wasn't particularly crowded at that time yet our server was nowhere to be found for a good 5+ minutes. Hello?! Maybe they were understaffed because I looked around and another group that had been seated nearby also had confused looks on their faces and no water or utensils in front of them.

41529,2013-03-18,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Was in Vegas this weekend with friends for a birthday celebration and we decided Sunday to have lunch at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at MGM. I'd never eaten at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant so I was excited to try it out.  Sad to say I'll probably never eat at a Wolfgang Puck restaurant again.  We all enjoyed our food, but the service was HORRIBLE. 

It started with our waiter basically throwing the drink menu on the table. When he came back, the first thing he said was ""do you have any questions?""  How about your name?  Luckily we were ready to order so he took it and then we waited, and waited, and waited. It took almost an hour from when we sat down till we received our food.  The tables around us all got their food before us, even tables that sat down after us.  One table sat down after us, ordered, ate AND paid before we got our food.  At one point the waiter came by and my friend asked him where our food was and he said it would be right out.  I was getting ready to go find the manager to ask about our food when the manager came to us.  He said our food was being plated as he spoke, but it still took another 5 minutes for it to arrive.  

After the manager talked to us, our waiter barely came by our table; he wouldn't even make eye contact when he walked by.  He did manage to clear my drink glass, but didn't bother to ask me if I wanted another one.  After the wait we'd had, I would have taken a second drink, but I guess he didn't want us to linger.  

It was also disappointing that the manager didn't bother to compensate us for the long wait and crappy service.  We're not sure why the manager came to us, but clearly he knew something was wrong. How about trying to make it right?  If he had, I probably wouldn't be writing this review.",DqiUIPwvBEpQBVHmsk6cQw,1,0,1,x6wDAWfLj55SwKyLxdswOw

For entrees, we ordered the Grilled Prime Burger, Vermont Cheddar Cheese, Smoked Onion Marmalade* (no onions), which was amazing. The waitress warned us that it would be a 25 minute wait for the burger because they are prepared to order and it was TOTALLY worth it.

100773,2016-02-04,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I'm a very well known chef in my hometown of San Dieguito. I've been called the ""Denizen of Spices"" by all who have tasted my food. So when I heard of this ""Wolfgang Puck"" fella, I was curious to see how he had such a fine restaurant in Vegas while I was still local. Boy, am I impressed.

Who knew someone with such an obscure name could be a master chef? The butter is smoother than my velvet bedsheets. The macaroni and cheese is no Kraft, that's for sure. The half chicken looked like it was the hot one on the block while it was alive. I mean seriously, this chicken must have laid eggs left and right considering how all the male chickens probably wanted to get it in.

The gnocchi is top notch. I embarrassed myself and asked the waiter for the ""gin-och-chee"" but he corrected my pronunciation and I now know Italian.

You know how in Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets, when Ron and Harry are punished by Dumbledore for flying a car to school, and crashing it into the weeping willow, and then they are fed sandwiches that keep magically replenishing? That's how the water is here. Every Time I went for a drink, my glass was magically full. I think the waiter might have had something to do with it, but my intuition tells me that Dumbledore is somewhere around here casting spells.

124302,2013-06-11,1,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"While almost all of my reviews are planned ahead of time through my always growing to-do list, every once in a while I end up at a random restaurant with clients and the chance to try a random burger. Such is the case with Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is where I ended up at recently. Historically this scenario ends in disaster; I hate succumbing to peer pressure and ordering the default burger on some menu because I'm the 'burger guy' and everyone wants to watch me eat one, but in this case it actually turned out fairly well.

Located in the back corner of the casino near the Cirque theater and Robuchon, Puck is a large space that's very open to the loud surrounding casino. A minimal railing and some decorative elements define the perimeter of the restaurant, but it's mostly open to the slots and bright lights of everything around it. Picture your typical casino café setting filled with tourists and conventioneers. There are both lunch and dinner menus available depending on the time of day, and it seems like they are almost identical with maybe a few less items on the dinner menu. They both feature soups, salads, apps, pizzas and many main courses. Both also offer the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont cheddar, smoked onion marmalade and fries, and that's exactly what I was pressured into ordering.

The bun was a bit too thick and dry, but acceptable with prominent poppy seed and onion flavors. It kind of reminded me of the bun I had at BurGR recently, but not as well proportioned; the bun to meat ratio was off as I had a good crescent shape of bun left over at the end. The meat was cooked a little more than medium rare, but seasoned well and had a good fresh beefy flavor. There was a bit too small of a topping of an almost cole slaw with shredded lettuce and onions on top, and two small tomatoes. The cheddar was melted well, but didn't stand out too much. The star and prominent flavor was the onion marmalade, both during and after my meal; it was sweet and had a good strong onion flavor. This was a very messy burger between the marmalade, mayo below and slaw juices, but overall way better than I anticipated.

The fries were also decent; your typical skinny variety cooked well with some skins and no oily flavor. This is both surprising and sad, as some strict burger joints I go to can't even get fries right these days. All of my pleasant surprises aside, I do have a major problem with the $17 price tag for this burger. Given the fact that most of the main courses on the lunch menu range from $20-39 a $17 burger seems ok, but I would counter with the argument that all of these prices are far too high and this is once again a case of a Strip restaurant taking advantage of the convention/tourist crowd while utilizing the name of a famous chef. So while this was admittedly a good burger, I wouldn't send you specifically to the MGM Grand to try it unless you already happened to be there and don't mind overpaying for it. Plus, with Mina's new 1842 about to open including hopefully a far superior burger, there will be better alternates on site.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,1,3,6bsmEUP2GfjrKzX1CrYLaA

At that point some guy came up and said something to her.   All of a sudden she led him and his party off to be seated.

From time to time, she offered various excuses, but there we stood at the hostess stand, awkwardly waiting for ""our table"".  Eventually a different hostess came up to us and asked if we minded sitting out in an area that was inundated with cigarette smoke.

Salad: Chinois Chicken Salad, Candied Cashews, Crisp Wontons, Chinese Mustard Vinaigrette $16.00 
Entrees: BF- (1) Mesquite Grilled Ribeye, Tuscan Potatoes, Sautéed Morels, English Peas, Red Wine Jus $48.00
Me-(2) Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak, Blue Cheese Butter, Red Wine Sauce, Fries $37.00 Dessert: Warm Chocolate Brownie w/ Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - $12.00 (comped) 

APPETIZER: Crab cakes were the size of a half dollar (being generous) with four on the plate. Unfortunately they left no real memory other than small and not fabulous. A 5 out of 10. 

SALAD: They split the salad in two with both HUGE portions. It was delicious with an even amount of tasty ingredients to make you fall in love with it. This was a winner, a 10 out of 10. 

ENTREES: Our entrees took 30 - 40 minutes or longer. They said it was because the ribeye was ordered 'well done'. (Other restaurants have no problem cooking well done in a timely manner.) My bf loved his ribeye and all the accoutrements that came with it. He would give it an 8.5 - 9 out of 10 (just an FYI, he loves ALL food). Flat iron steak was rare and flavorful but a bit tough with grit, that happens with these steaks sometimes. I didn't finish the skinny fries as they weren't 'amazing' but they were fresh, crispy and 'fun' for a minute. I would have preferred mashed or baked. Fries seem to make the plate weak especially at $37.00. A 7 out of 10. 

DESSERT: The desert was 10 out of 10- a ""Warm Chocolate Melting Brownie with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream"". They dont 'do' bday's there meaning they dont sing and embarrass you but they did make a beautiful plate with kind wishes. The dessert was comped which was very nice, especially at $12.00.

I enjoyed both dishes more and more with each bite. Chicken soup and Butter lettuce Caesar's salad simple but I liked the attention to detail. Lettuce was very fresh (I grow my own, so I appreciate this). Very simple but the flavors were very well balanced. Chicken soup, again very simple but very well balanced. Chicken, had very nice flavor - brined?

Wife had fish and chips. She loved it.Fries were crispy, just the way she liked it. Fish was fresh, batter very light and crispy. Funny, fish reminded me of deep fried dish In some fish tacos I had down at a SHACK down in Baja. Both are are excellent, except the one in Baja were $1 a piece. You don't have to pay top dollar to get good food.

Service, excellent. They were all attentive and friendly.

Overall a great time. We will be back.

We were back for a second meal... This one dropped on all counts. Pear and Apple salad was too vinegary and overdressed. Why do people like so much dressing on their salad? My mistake to not ask for the dressing on the side - thought they would respect the freshness of the produce and dress it properly.

Pizza was good, but was only okay for $15. Reminded me of CPK.

Service was good but not very friendly.

First time eating at any of the Puck restaurants so I was excited and had high expectations.  We got there right when they opened at 11:30am and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was awesome and we always had our waters refilled without having to ask (we always seems to have that problem everywhere we eat out).  

Drink: I ordered a non-alcoholic drink called Ginger Lime Iced Tea $6 (I think) and it was pretty mild on the ginger part.  My boyfriend didn't taste the ginger at all.  Despite that, it was a pretty good drink.

Food: Boyfriend ordered a basic pizza $15, fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, basil.  I'm assuming they go light on the sauce already but my boyfriend asked for easy sauce and got practically no sauce but the crust was good enough for my carb crazed man.
I ordered the BLT sandwich ($16) because I saw that pork belly was in the mix instead of bacon which is why I've never ordered BLTs to begin with.  I have officially dubbed this sandwich THE FIRST CLASS SANDWICH.  The waiter warned me about what pork belly really is and how it's not like bacon blah blah blah.  I said ""Honey, I know exactly what I'm getting into.  Pork belly is one of my guilty pleasures.  I dunno if the other reviewer who had this was expecting something salty like bacon and actually expected bacon because she kept calling it ""bacon"" (bacon is cured, pork belly is not), but the sandwich they served me was flavorful to it's true taste!!  Somehow it wasn't a messy sandwich to eat because they took the care of prepping their food.  No avocados slipping and sliding, no greasy mess so the bread stayed crispy!  Simple ingredients, nothing complicated. Every bite was HEAVEN!!!!!  I gave my other half to my boyfriend because he was starting to regret not ordering it when he took a bite!  The side pasta salad was awesome, balanced flavors, the olives totally made it!

A-Ok. Average. It's kinda expensive, but we're in Vegas.

If you want a regular food for an average dish of $20+, 
I recommend this place. 

My fiance & I ordered the.....
Prosciutto w/Olive, Goat Cheese, etc. Pizza:
Olive was super salty! 
Avoid eating any chunks of chopped olives & you should be fine.
Taste-wise, it's pretty good  :d

Linguini w/Clams, Pancetta, Chili etc.
Spicy & I like it. Greasy. Not too bad, overall. 

Total cost for those 2 dishes...$45..no more comments on that :0 
If you want a familiar casual American food, I don't think Wolfgang Puck can go too wrong, since it's so commercialized. 

Other footnotes:
Nice Decor. 
They have such nice menu design, I can't seem to comprehend why they won't make a better pizza-to-go box (but I guess that's unrelated to taste :p).",yeyeLc60Zq0A-3A8C2-WAQ,0,0,3,Bca-NrxMbSA5i8GSeWJ8hQ

Their cocktails are unique and refreshing. The pineapple mojito I tried there is my favorite cocktail of all time. The only thing I imagine some people might not love is the openness of the space.

Wrong.
Started out with their wings and a ""Caesar Salad.""  Wings were bland, the dressing that came with them even more so.  To their credit, they tell you the Caesar isn't a proper Caesar salad, but once again, completely bland, cheese not good, disappointing.
Not as bad as the Entrees though.  I had the Ricotta Gnocchi with fennel Bolognese.  The Gnocchi themselves were mush, bland, and the sauce definitely did not taste fresh at all.  My brothers Linguini with Clams went basically untouched, and honestly, we're not picky eaters, at all, and it was ten at night in Vegas so of course we'd been drinking.  
We told the server we didn't really enjoy the food, and he didn't seem too surprised.  
He offered to take something off, but we declined, and just got out of there.
With the quantity they do at this restaurant, it seems like the quality has been sacrificed and its all been streamlined.  
We'd considered eating at Bouchon that night, and with prices that were pretty comparable we definitely made a mistake.

The atmosphere was great, open air to the casino but also secluded enough. The multicolored glass panels created for me a very relaxed feeling, always a benefit when enjoying good food.  Or was it thebeer. I dunno, plus one for having good micro brews!

Let me just preface the review of the food with one sentence. The service rocked. Our waiter was polite, attentive, and on point. Even when he was away attending other parties another, equally skilled, waiter was there to make sure we were attended to. 

Now to the food. In an attempt to show how classy i can be, even at lunch on a Monday, i ordered the tuna tartar with crispy wantons. It came in a cylindrical presentation with a layer of fresh avocado on top. Just next to it was a streak of red sauce, the base of which had to be Sriracha or some similar red chili sauce.  This is probably the third or forth time i have had tartar, and it went down well. The tuna was tasty and had a nice soft texture. It went well with the avocado. 

If you love burgers, this one will make you see god. It was perfectly cooked, moist and de-licious. It came with fresh pickled cucumbers, butter lettuce, and a sweet onion marmalade. I will be buried with a bottle of ketchup right next to me, but on this burger, it wasn't necessary. All the elements included worked together, unlike most time i eat a burger where half the stuff wilts next to my french fries. Which were also good, never doubt a Frenchmen's restaurants ability to bring the frites.

It's a perfect place to eat before going out at night.  It's high quality food served in an timely manner.  

I was just there with some friends and we ordered a wide variety of dishes.  They were all so good we ended up sharing a lot with one another.  I had the pork chop, which was fantastic, and I was able to try the meatloaf and the burger, both were amazing.

Decor:
Classic with a modern twist. Their bar was beautiful, and I adored their tableware setup. Although you are quite exposed to casino-goers, you don't notice it as the ambience is very good. 

Food:
I love bread...especially free bread. Thy give you tons of it! And they're different types (baguette, whole wheat, and even focaccia!), arrive warm, and with tons of butter.  I ordered handmade linguine with mushrooms, which was cooked perfectly. It was a huge portion and very filling. I love handmade pasta, so this was a huge plus.

Great!!! Never once was my water glass empty, and our waiter checked on us several times throughout the meal. Drink orders were also timely.

We order (party of 2) pizza, grilled chicken with veggies, and a large salad. enough to feed four!

Okay, He serves our water.. and leaves. (where is he for the soda, wine, or tea?)

Comes with our food and asks if everything is fine.. ""yes"" and leaves.

He came to us ZIP- ZERO- times. maybe it was our age, maybe we did not look like the good tipping type. so he catered to the older couple. 
the bus boy came and served me more water. Guess who got extra tip? 

I was fuming. since i still wanted dessert, but was never asked.. he just brought us the bill.. And HE still got his good tip...  was it deserved?

Common!), but the portions were quite large and we all had trouble trying to finish our meals.

Food:
Meatball Pizza--This is a very good sized pizza and I could only get through about half of it before I hit my limit. It was pretty good but there was a bit too much meat on it for my liking, especially for a thin crust pizza.
Spicy Spaghetti and Meatballs-- This was pretty good, but for $27 I'd pass.
Cheeseburger-- I haven't actually tried this but everyone on my table who ordered it had no leftovers so...it must have been aight....
Truffle Potato Chips with Blue Cheese sauce-- These are soooooo good! If you like blue cheese or cheese in general you'll love this! Oh how I wish I had some in front of me right now!

First, the restaurant is right in the middle of the casino floor, surrounded by noisy games.  It has 3/4 height glass walls, so there is even less separation from the casino.  Also, the interior is sterile and white, like Martha Stewart designed a school cafeteria.  

We had to wait on the casino floor to be seated because the restaurant has no entry or waiting area.  There are just 3 steps up from the casino to the hostess stand.  At first we thought we were in line to talk to the hostess, but soon we realized the people in front of us were just waiting.  Pushing past them, we finally got our name on the list, and the hostess told us to go stand at the bottom of the stairs with the other people blocking the entrance.  It was a really inefficient system.

Now I'm done complaining.  Once we were seated it was a really pleasant meal.  The surrounding casino didn't bother us at all.  The waiter was attentive.  We enjoyed the wine we ordered.  The pizza I ate was good, and the gnocchi with sausage sauce my husband ordered was wonderful.  

To qualify that statement, you need to know that I was a vegetarian for 9 years and I still don't eat red meat.  I even make my husband cook chili with ground turkey instead of beef.

Everything started out fine, we were seated promptly, the bread was nice and very fresh, the Pinot Grigio was good. To be fair the starters were delicious, I shared the calamari with my brother and tasted my dads ribs. Both were great choices, then the mains arrived....to say my ravioli tasted like a microwave meal...it was completely bland and the edges of the ravioli on the outside of the dish were rock hard, the way it would be had it been microwaved. I decided to ask the server, an overweight woman with dark hair pulled back, if it had in fact been microwaved. Let me point out that I was polite in asking, I have worked in enough customer service jobs, food and hospitality, retail etc, to know what it's like to be at the receiving end of irate customer complaints...well the condescension that my query was met with. I have never experienced such rudeness, she spoke to me like I was a two year old, calling me sweetie, and smirking whilst telling me they had no microwave on the premises. But that she could make it all better if I wanted a new one. At this point my dad and brother were half way through their meals and I didn't want to sit watching them eat and then have them sit and watch me eat. So I declined the offer. On collection of our plates, she turned to the bus boy and whispered something while smirking and jerking her head in my direction and he then looked over at me and they both walked off. At this point I went to the manager and while I was waiting the server swept in when she saw where I was headed. She then became apologetic in the most false way claiming I had misunderstood. The manager was standing beside us and he began to apologise. I sat back down and she brought dessert menus but I said I didnt want anything, my brother and father took menus to look, but at this stage I was so mortified and on the verge of tears that I had to ask them not to order anything so we could leave asap. Eventually she returned and when they said they didn't want anything she said they had intended on comping dessert despite the fact that I had already said I didn't want anything and it was only after everyone had refused dessert that we were told...how convenient. Ten minutes later the bill arrives, ravioli included! Could not believe they included it after everything.

Josh is exceptional as your bartender, being very attentive to your needs. Edwin, your chef see's to it that every dish is as special as the last.

Then we decided to look for Rainforest Cafe...but for whatever reason we got to Wolfgang Pucks first and decided to stop. We were hungry and tired of walking around. 

I was hesitant because the Wolfgang Puck in LA that used to be on Sunset always had the worst food. Buying so glad I gave this place a chance.

I loved the decor and ambiance. The staff were all incredibly friendly and our waiter was great! I wish I could remember his name! 

Also our food was sooo good!

The Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in the MGM Grand, serves a contemporary ""bar and grill"" menu artfully executed.  The restaurant has an exciting bar and a beautiful glass enclosed private dining room.  

I always have a personal gourmet pizza, no you can not have any, It is too good! They are perfecto e mundo.

The Fritto Misto consists of calamari, zucchini, shrimp, olives and served with a lemon aioli, which is exciting to both look at and eat.  His wine list is primarily of California wines and the desserts are made in house. 

My husband loves their sandwiches.  The  peppered Prime Beef, with aioli and white cheddar on a baguette with potato salad  or the smoked turkey, ham and bacon club with herb aioli and baby greens are his two favorites. 

Prices for sandwiches are between $13.- $16.00.  Pizzas are from $12. - $14., so no breaking the bank here to enjoy a good lunch!",Kj-u8Yq1d3mLKitWsDAxpg,5,6,4,ZAmADf-95tGXbJeLxsVyyw

The BBQ chicken pizza was really good, the sauce was sweet and tangy, the peppers had a little kick and the crust was perfect.

Liked the ""bar food"" variety on their menu so decided to give it a shot even though most entrees were priced at around $25, pizzas around $15 so not too bad. It's fenced off but open to the casino, which is nice. It was an upscale-casual vibe (if that's possible). The service was impeccable! Truly. Meatball pizza as an app was delicious and I've had some serious pizza in Chi-town and NYC. It took about 15 minutes to get the pizza, which we expected, but as soon as it came out the manager came right up to us, apologized for the delay on our pizza, and immediately told us that they would be buying us dessert (we were a group of 4). Not one of us knew what delay he spoke of, we just sort of froze at the mention of free dessert, which i'm not a big sweets person, but free is free. I had the steak skewers...UH-Amazing taste and texture. The garlic chili wings were good, but they seemed more teriyaki glazed to me. The truffle potato chips were great for blue cheese lovers. The short rib was fantastic as was the flat iron steak with fries. Oh, the fries were incredible. Hot and crispy, and stayed like that for a while. We decided to share two desserts in case they were too big. We were super stuffed because we had already ordered all of our food before we knew we would be getting the free dessert. We chose the banana banouffee(?) and the pineapple upsidedown dessert, both were topped wtih homemade ice creams and syrups. Believe me when I say that these desserts were the most amazing creations to ever hit my tounge. They were just beyond description! Yes, both of them! I've had so-called good desserts before at places like Ferrara's and Serendipity in NYC before, but those places were just generic, processed, super market ice cream compared to Wolfgang's creations. They really were unbelieveable. I cannot wait to go back to this place, and the great thing is that it stays open til about 6am I think!

Absolutely mouth watering.  The bread the waiter brought was delightful, with an assortment of what I believe was French bread, sour dough, and a unique and tangy olive bread.  

Not to mention the alluring atmosphere of a French street paired with ""street"" performers in the form of a flutist and violinist.  Very romantic and classy.

Started off by ordering the calamari app while i figured out where I was going with the rest of the meal.  It arrived shortly afterwards with a noticeable sheen to it.  I like my fried calamari dry and not glistening.  

Talked with the waiter about the specialty pizzas which are a big part of the menu.  He suggested that they were just pizzas, interesting, but  'just pizzas'.

Wound up with the chicken milanese which he suggested would be a decent amount of food.  The entree arrived and was 2 board-like pieces of overdone chicken beast with an arrugula salad with grape tomatos on top.  Made it through just one of them before giving up.  I was pretty disappointed with the flavor and texture of the chicken (too dry).

We started off with Truffled potato chips that was dressed with point reyes blue cheese sauce and the 
Big-eye tuna tartare finished with avocado, spicy mayo along with a side of sesame wonton. Both were spot on!! Perfectly cooked and presented.

For the main entree i ordered the Sauteed seabass with sides of gulf shrimp, caramelized sunchokes in a tomato-saffron broth. Close to mediterranean style and no words to describe this.

In our quest for something good to eat while out of town, I decided on Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill. We headed on down to the MGM and walked around for a while before finding it. 

It was a Friday just before noon, so it was a little early, and we were seated right away. 

We took one look at the menu and both knew exactly what we were having. I started with a Raspberry Lemon Drop martini and he started with a Coors Light. I got a Cuban Sandwich and my dining companion got a Roast Beef Panini. Both came with homemade potato chips. 

The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, yet very appealing and not loud for being in the middle of the casino. 

The food came rather quickly, just as the place was starting to fill up. 

The sandwiches were great! My Cuban had the right amount of everything, including pickles on the side so I could add more. I typically do not care for homemade potato chips - apparently these were the exception. Dining companion really enjoyed his roast beef. The arugula was a nice touch to the sandwich. 

Overall a great meal. I would go back without hesitation. In and out in under an hour.

Truffle chips- dont' get it. didnt' find anything special about it. and i hate blue cheese. all hype my friends

crabcakes- so juicy and moist. get it.

vongole- very large in portion. and soo delicious. best dish of the night

mesquite skewers- pretty good. 

shrimp tomato pasta ( i forget the name)- They were out of the original pasta so used angel hair instead. big mistake. Worst dish of the night. We barely touched it. It was so bland, i just ate the shrimp.DON'T GET IT

1016493,2018-03-03,2,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Was in vegas for a few nights on vacation. I wanted to check out this WP Bar & Grill in the MGM. I checked the hours and planned my day around a late dinner here, all good so far.

We arrive at the MGM and ask a Security Guard which way it is, he says it is closed and they close early whenever they feel like it type deal.. um ok? Leave bummed, not much open, end up at Denny's :|

I double check the hours and they should have been open. Anyways the next day I call and speak to a manager(didn't get ""her"" name). I explain the situation to her. She said they close early on that particular for ""years"" and that I probably got the wrong hours from google or a 3rd party site. No worries, maybe I made a mistake perhaps and thank her for her time.

I check online, google, MGM, and then WP Bar & Grill's own site, they should have been open! I call back and explain this to her, she proceeds to scream at me, yelling, and berating me! I am in utter shock, I've never been treated this way before. She yells ""what do you want me to do about it now?!?!?!?!"". I explain I based my day around eating at this location and some form of a comp would be nice, she yells at me some more and says ""no"". I ask for her name and she puts me on a endless hold to get rid of me.

I call back and explain to the girl that answers the phone(not her), I speak to a different Manager Brad - who was very professional and polite btw. He apologizes and asks me to come back in and he will take care of us. I explain to him I actually have a reservation at WP Lupo tonight but would try to come in the next day.

On our way to Lupo we passed the WP Bar & Grill in MGM and we got to speak to Brad in person. Again, he was very nice and apologetic, encouraging us to come in.  I explained we were literally on her way to Lupo but would likely come back tomorrow.

We never ended up coming back the next day but after some time at Lupo we wondered why were getting bonus dishes, appetizers, and desert compliment's of the chef. Brad went a step beyond and actually called Lupo and made things more than right for us.

I would have left 1 star based purely on the insane manager I first encountered but it would be wrong to fault WP as a whole for her actions. Brad rectified the situation even though we were unable to find the extra time to come back and eat there, so I am neutral at 3 stars... and 5 stars for Brad and for WP Lupo(which I will review separately).

I'd still recommend WP Bar & Grill as it genuinely did look good, just look out for a crazy Manager, who hopefully is no longer there or has been reprimanded.",XXtCnL2XOvvEib0e1FEMxA,3,0,3,EchVKaPaOIOUJF_93FrCnA

We started with the truffle potato chips with maytag blue cheese sauce. These were a little light on the truffle oil but they made up for it in blue cheese. There was plenty of chips on the plate for the two of us to share.

My wife thoroughly enjoyed her grilled salmon which was moist and flaky. I had the flat iron steak which was very tender and cooked perfectly. I savored each bite with a little of the maytag blue cheese sauce left over from the potato chips. Delish!

The staff is friendly and very efficient. Our server was smiling all the time. Unfortunately, she also didn't check back on us after we started our meal (she showed up immediately after we were served to make sure it ""looked"" okay).

Maybe I hold Puck to higher standards but this restaurant and meal wasn't particularly memorable. I was expecting outstanding and got good. Most of the time that's good enough for four stars.

Flavor was good, nothing popping. Could have used a sprinkle of salt to enhance flavor.

Pea Soup with Truffle Oil and Morels = 4/5
I liked this dish.  It was pureed smooth and drizzled with truffle oil (and crema, i think) with a few morels in the middle.  

Meatball Spagetti = 3.5/5
Eh.  If you're going to serve spagetti with meatballs it either better be in 3D or be really, really out of this world.  Most people can make a decent version at home so if you're going to pay $20, it better blow my mind.  It didn't.  NEXT!

Mussels in white wine with chorizo = 4/5
You get a LOT of mussels for $25 so it makes this dish worth it.  The flavor of the broth was good, cheesy bread was so-so, and the few chorizo slices act as an accent rather than a main ingredient.  The server had to empty my shell plate a couple times before I was done with all the mussels that I got, so if you like mussels this dish a good one.

Some friends ordered the ravioli and said it was really good, but I didn't try it, so I don't know.  =P

Overall
- you need reservations if going during main business hours
- service (ours at least) was pretty good
- we told the server we were catching a show, food came out promptly
- portions were a good size
- appetizers were $10-15 and entrees $18-30.  So about $$ if ordering an entree and beverage and about $$$ if you're going for 3 courses.

We found a lovely woman (wish we asked for her name) in the restaurant who had indicated that they were closed for the night to replace the flooring, but would resume regular dinner service the following day.

She said she would make our reservation for tomorrow evening and make sure we ""will be taken care of"".  

We arrived the next evening and it made up for the mix-up before.

There is a certain standard at Wolfgang and that was apparent during our service. Our server was very courteous and attentive. , there are servers going around tables specially to refill waters and drinks. The complimentary bread basket contained roasted garlic focaccia and whole grain bread. 

We started with Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers ($17), Creamy Slaw, House Steak Sauce, cooked medium. The sauce was a combination of tangy (think A1), and sweet BBQ. The steak were cooked into perfect bite size morsels and just melted in the mouth.

We ordered the Jidori Half Chicken, Braised Kale, Yukon Potato Puree, Rosemary Jus ($28) and ""Spaghetti & Meatballs"", Spicy Tomatoes, Garlic, Sweet Basil, Pecorino Romano ($24). I was expecting the chicken entree to be a broasted chicken, instead it was a pan fried chicken at of the potatoes that were so fluffy, you'd think they were whipped. The meatballs were the best meatballs I've ever had! It was a blend of beef and pork, with a little bit of panko bread crumbs. The portions are so satisfying, we needed a to go box after eating what we thought was a huge portion of our meal.

For our troubles, we were comped the appetizers. Our total if we had paid full price would have been $74 before tip.

We came here last year as well and the consistency in the food and service has not changed. We are likely to make this an annual stop, it's so good!",d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ,12,9,5,Hhr6Lz4HNlYJ-zuc-2mFig

Italian sausage: Hmm I liked that sausage. That's what she said. Great flavor on this one especially with the caramelized garlic and sharp pecorino romano cheese.

Came here at 11:30am thinking we could get brunch but was told their Brunch hoes are 10pm-6am. I forget Vegas time is different. GG. So good place for that post clubbing munchies.

On the recommendation of our hostess we ordered the Truffle Potato chips with Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce. I liked the blue cheese sauce but it drowned out the truffle. Still pretty delicious especially if you like blue cheese. Which I definitely do. 

Entrees:

Ricotta Agnolotti, Italian Sausage, Broccolini, Sweet Peppers, Pecorino - The golden butter sauce for this dish went well with the vegetables but it didn't quite mesh well with the ricotta agnolotti. 

Handcut Papardelle, Braised Shortrib Ragu, Crimini Mushrooms, Pargmigiano - Ordered on the suggestion of our server. Very similar to a stroganoff. I recommend this dish if you're looking for something flavorful. 

Prosciutto, San Marzano Tomatoes, Goat Cheese, Mozzarella, Wild Arugula - Classic artisan pizza combo. Proscuitto was thicker than usually and made the pizza taste on the salty side. I wish there was a bit more tomatoes and arugula to balance it out.

Steak and Eggs, baby.

And I'm surprised to say this but Wolfgang serves up an awesome steak and eggs dish. Pricey ($~29.00), yes, but it's totally worth the extra bucks. Not to mention, the plate can easily be shared between two if you aren't super hungry (but you know you need something in your stomach to deter a potential hangover in the morning). 

Grilled Steak and Eggs with Tuscan Potatoes and Herb Hollandaise Sauce. Mmm doesn't that just sound good to you? 

The steak, ordered medium rare, was cooked beautifully (none of that tough dry steak nonsense here). Loved how as soon as I cut into the meat with my steak knife, the firm flesh revealed a warm red center. Juicy, flavorful, well-seaseoned deliciousness.

My friend and I asked for sun side up eggs, which were perfect for eating right over toast (you can choose sourdough, wheat or white, served with butter or jam on the side), and them tuscan potatoes were bombdiggity. They reminded me of smashed potatoes except they were prepared in a way where crispiness was not compromised. Dip with ketchup and you've struck gold. 

I don't think I could eat steak and eggs anywhere else... I've been spoiled so. I'll be sure to return the next time I'm in Vegas for crazy drunken shenanegans!",hPRxsxwK2pcscSv70t_KcA,4,3,4,6h2coaLK9am4k8g4lY95oA

The restaurant is located on the second floor of the mall and is really easy to find.  It's located next to other restaurants in Crystals such as Social House and Mastro's.  It's open restaurant seating gives it the feeling of a food court type establishment.  But obviously much more upscale to align with the Wolfgang Puck branding.

I admit, I've heard great things about it before from other friends.  I'm also a big fan of Italian food so I was anxious to try it.

So we came here late on a weekday night.  There was no wait and the restaurant was light.  We decided to sit at the bar as there was happy hour bar menu.  I'm not sure if that was a good choice.  While the service here is great, the prices for what you get in food and atmosphere were not.  Now don't get me wrong.  The food isn't bad, but I expected more given the reputation and prices.   The food itself is tasty.  They seem to keep their approach on food very simple... which I prefer.  But overall, I think that there are better alternatives for the prices.  ie.

Working in the restaurant business, I tend to be a bit snobby and prissy when it comes to service at other restaurants and usually, I'm disappointed.  This was NOT one of those experiences.  

I was staying at the MGM and attending a conference and didn't want to venture far for lunch.  After a horrible lunch experience at Emeril's on my first day of the conference, I decided to give Wolfgang's a try on day two.  And it was such a pleasant experience, I came back on Day 3 as well. 

First visit:
- We were greeted pleasantly by the hostess

- Sat a nice table near the glass

- promptly greeted by our server (Jeremy) who thoroughly explained the specials and also recommended a cocktail.  The Pearfict Martini thing was great!

- We were in a bit of a rush, so we ordered quickly.  Two of us had pizzas and one had a shrimp scampi thing.  Everything was pretty awesome.  

- All food came out in a very timely manner and waters/drinks were refilled even through the entire restaurant was completely full for lunch.  

- The support staff (bussers/runners) were great and Jeremy was very attentive and on-point as well.  

- We were in and out of the restaurant in 40 minutes and still had time to get some Starbucks before we headed back to the conference.  


Second Visit:
- Jeremy was actually near the entrance to greet us and recognized us and sat us in his section.  Restaurant was almost empty.  

- Quickly ordered some food.  Had the Cheesy Potato Chips thing.  They were pretty darn good, but also very rich.  Too much for two people.  I had a pepperoni pizza and she had a caesar salad.  Salad was average.  Not amazing, just good.  Pizza was good, just like the day before. 

- Service was, once again, great.  


Overall, the staff seems very professional, detailed and well-put-together.  I was impressed to find such good service in a ""casual"" las vegas eatery.  

Thanks for the awesome service and great food.",WPHJJYdJDORXgxDFIa_BKQ,1,1,5,gsbX_qUu17G_tC7YQ3EvyQ

We visited the first time on a whim and were so taken with the Jidori Chicken, we returned for my friend's birthday!  He was pretty excited by the suggestion so we walked all the way to MGM Grand 2 or 3 miles away just to order it.  The mushroom bisque we had before wasn't on the menu this time, so we ordered a split of the chicken with a side of the roasted cauliflower with Parmesan cheese.  

Jidori Chicken has a lovely crunchy crust and they serve you a half chicken over Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with a soy sauce glaze that is richly salty and satisfying.  The cauliflower is very rich.  It's great, but lots of cheese and butter so make sure you share the calories!  

Service at this 24 hour joint is top notch.  They split the order no issue at all and no fee.  Prices are about average for the typical upscale casino restaurant.  $28 for the chicken which is a fair (not huge) portion and $8 - 10 for sides or appetizers.  Drinks are what drive the bill up, of course, so order with caution.  

We happened to mention that we were there to celebrate a birthday and they brought us a special creme brûlée for dessert at no charge!  It was a little weird now that I think of it since we turned down the dessert menu.  We were stuffed, but it was so wonderfully creamy with a perfect burnt sugar crust we managed to down about half of it.  Burp.",Yf0JwS-Zr2DQlk73TDzVLA,1,0,4,cohrn2fQMxXSOFGfBMXfgQ

Grilled Ribeye was cooked to perfection w/ a wonderful red wine au jus, fresh time & the caramelized shallots offered a nice flavoring, even tho I did not eat them.  The mash potatoes under the Ribeye almost tasted like a polenta, so flavorful!  

The Grilled Octopus was a chef's special & as long as I have supported Wolfgang Puck restaurants he changes his menu up seasonally, like a Spagos for instance, I fall in love w/ something & next time it's gone.  These creations are absolutely mouthwatering.  The Grilled octopus & potato melt in your mouth.

I've eaten at several of Wolfgang's Restaurants around the country and I rate them all the same ""predictable"" don't confuse this with anything negative these restaurants are just a safe choice but not outstanding for the prices in my opinion.

We were very happy to see although they were quite busy we were seated immediately, after a few minutes our server arrived he was friendly enough and explained the specials and quickly got our drink orders

THEN THE WAIT BEGAN!

It was apparent that the kitchen was backed up for this hour of the evening but then again it's Vegas, our server did make it back to our table periodically to assure us our food would arrive at some point, then he returned and told us the burger I ordered was very popular and the grill could only accommodate just so many, then he returned  to tell us that no matter how long it takes the chef ( I was thinking short order cook) never rushed any orders to ensure each burger was handcrafted and magnificent. At this point I really didn't care and wish I had made a run to In N Out.

After more than 45 minute from placing our order the kitchen delivered our meal the $17 burger was beautiful but slightly well done so I was slightly disappointed since I ordered it medium rare but it appeared to be ""well crafted"" I guess, this 1/2 pound of ground prime beef topped with fresh crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, pickles, onions and spicy mayo all stacked on a fresh pretzel bun had the making of something special but it was a little over-cooked. The server offered to fix it but it was much to late even though he said it would take only a few minutes I wondered how could this be the burger in front of me took almost an hour. The fries that accompanied the burger were delicious and served hot.

I had the Truffle Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce to start off with. Oh my goodness! These have to be the most spectacular potato chips I have ever had. Then again, almost anything cooked with truffle is amazing.  

I was told that the organic chicken was very good. And for my first time there, I always think a chicken dish is pretty safe and hard to ruin. It was quite good. It wasn't dry at all, and the skin was cooked just perfectly. I like the skin to be pretty crunchy.  It was served on top of garlic potato puree, honey glazed carrots, and spring peas.  Carrots were perfect. I like mine a bit undercooked to give it that crunch texture (If you want soft veggie, go eat baby food).  The potatoes were very good to my tasting, but I am not a potato connoisseur.  

To top off dinner we shared the chocolate beignets. I was expecting the old fashion beignets (like the square ones from New Orleans at Café Du Monde). Of course, leave it to these chefs to re-invent them. These beignets were almost like donut holes, BUT BETTER! They are almost like the texture of chocolate soufflé that is rolled into a ball. And inside this ball was core of yummy chocolate-ness.  To compliment it all, it was served with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce.

My mother ordered the pizza. Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Unos, etc. have it one-up, hands-down on this places monstrous version of pizza. To give you an idea of how bad it was, my mother sent it back and the table next to us to one bite of theirs and were too shy to say anything about it.

I ordered the Chicken Milanese with Spinach greens. The salad was good, the chicken came out of a box...or that was at least what I could easily assume about the paper thin, overly crusted, tasteless thing called chicken. In addition to my meal, my excitement led me to order a side of pureed potatoes. Ummm....WTF did they serve me? No taste, no seasoning, no....nothing. White sloppy mush!

Grandma had that delish looking beef on sticks. Not too much of a complaint there, but specify how you want your meat. Each stick of meat had a varying degree of ""done-ness"" ranging from charcoal burnt to red and bloody. Not sure what the intent of that was.

We luckily saw Wolfgang Puck Express was open late and inside the MGM, so very close. The restaurant is open to casino, and this particular casino smells heavily of air freshener. I know they don't want it to smell bad or like smoke, but I think they got a little to happy with the air freshener spray, lol.

At 2:00am there were hardly any other guests here so we were easily able to get the servers attention when we needed anything. I must say, service here was superb. Much to our surprise because it was 2:00am!! The staff is very friendly and accommodating to the guests. They really know how to make you feel welcome and that they are there to serve you. 

I order the Chicken Salad Sandwich. The sandwich is served in what seemed like cinnamon raisin bread with a salad on the side. The salad certainly tasted fresh/clean. The sandwich was a little different tasting at first, but after a few tastes I quickly hooked. I guess I wasn't expecting the bread to be somewhat sweet. There are also grapes inside the sandwich.

I was not personally a fan of the pizza, I'll likely give it another chance some other time. But have avoided it since the first time.

Drink selection is very good, and they have a good Anderson Valley Gose sour that I like. More expensive than back home (Portland, OR) - but I haven't found anywhere else to get it when in Vegas, so it is what it is.

Staff has always been fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Seating time is hit or miss depending on how busy it is, of course, but the open seating at the bar can alleviate that depending on group-size.

My only qualm, and I obviously did not take off any stars for this, is that it is a very open establishment in the midst of the MGM casino floor, so it is very smokey.

* Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings - I have to admit these would have been f'in tasty on any other night except this one. These wings were a little on the sweet side. They almost tasted like Garlic Chicken you might find at a Chinese restaurant but with a BBQ style to them. The problem was after consuming so many sugary drinks, the sweetness of these wings did not agree with no ones stomach.
* Prosciutto, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese Pizza - The pizza was pretty good

I had a pre meal ""peach infused martini"" which was refreshing and tasty.  Flat iron can be a tough cut, the server assured us they are marinated for a long time and would be tender.

Truffle Potato Chips with Blue Cheese Sauce - both of us were not a fan of blue cheese (but a huge fan of truffle!!!), so we asked to have the sauce on the side. When it arrived, there is a huge bowl of truffle cheese sauce goodness, and a small side of crumbled blue cheese, which we just ignored and was respectively offered to taken away by the sweet waiters. What a delicious appetizer it was! That sauce is absolutely DIVINE - you can really taste the truffle and it being paired up with cheesy scrumptiousness is like pairing peanut butter and jelly; it just goes perfectly well. (If there was blue cheese in that cheese sauce, we didn't taste it!) If you don't care for the crumbled blue cheese, we really do recommend asking for the sauce on the side! Having to dip each house made crispy chip into the sauce made it a little fun, and we didn't have to deal with any soggy chips or sauce being unevenly dispersed. 

Salmon with Herb Marinated Couscous, Lemon Creme Fraiche, and Parsley Pesto - We saw the table next to us order this, and it looked delicious! When asking which dish on the menu was it, she told us it was the salmon and that it really is delicious as it looks. Per recommendation, we ordered it! The waitress asked how we would like the salmon cooked, and medium rare is what we picked. The salmon came out cooked to perfection; pink in the inside, flakey, moist, and bursting with flavor with the help of parsley pesto on the top. This paired with the tasty couscous with a light creamy lemon flavor of the lemon creme fraiche was a wonderful combination. The couscous also had bits of pine nuts and golden raisins, which gave great texture and little sweetness to the dish. The dish was garnished with basil, which is always a plus because basil + pesto + salmon is like the tasty trio! 

We finished everything and left completely full! Service was nothing short of amazing and accommodating - with smiles, plate changes, water cup constantly filled, etc. I only wished our other two friends were with us so they could experience a yummy meal....... also so we could have ordered more and tried out other dishes heh heh.",Tbyoeb3vjli4Hjc6uqGKZA,7,3,5,qUEhqgqM4EWduFR8ynkDhg

Central location in the casino and elevator bank at the MGM Grand

Great vittles

Outstanding prices for the location and a once famous celebrity chef

Menu is concise but allows substitutions

Good looking young men who try and usually succeed on getting you in their room

Killer hours

They don't care if you have been drinking heavily.... But it IS in a casino at the MGM Grand

Kobe Beef  specials

CLEAN

Great vibe

TOTAL TURNOFFS

The wait staff acts like they work next door at Joel  Robuchon....one of the most expensive and highest rated in the US. The female staff is especially heavy on the attitude despite  most being eligible for most plain and homely.

Service is just BAD. Inaccurate orders. Orders sent to the wrong table and just shy of frenetic. And this is off peak.

Anything Puck-related, thank I've experienced, suffers from the same problem.  It isn't hard to stumble on to something excellent, but there isn't a level of care that ensures excellence at every turn.  You also get the added problem of the snobbishness of a fine restaurant coupled with the incompetence of a chain.

I'm not sure if I ever had great bread at a Wolfgang place, it seems that they'd rather do something ""interesting"" rather than delicious.  It's the sort of bread that was popular in the 80s, and it's a habit worth breaking.  The waiters, as far as I can tell, do not write orders down.  When this happens, the body language of the waiter lets you know if he got the order in his head.  This time, his clueless expression led to our being unsurprised when a soup went missing.  He returned well into the meal, long after soup time. We also ordered a cured meat platter with toast and burrata, although completely delicious, was served without explanation of the types of meat.  

Keeping with policy, I won't comment on other's dishes unless I have a taste, so despite other's disappointment, my veal ravioli with brown butter, mushroom and sage was amazing - and the portions were far more than I could handle.

The Truffled Potato Chips were delicious, and I'm not sure if Wolfgang Puck should put his name on this establishment. I should note that my buddy and I only had the Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade along with the chips so we had limited exposure to the menu. But hey, a great restaurant is supposed to make something simple into spectacular, and from its name the burger sure ""sounded"" delecious. While the name of the burger lights up your eyes, you palette is left bored and dismayed. Though it was cooked perfectly to my request of rare, there was no flavor that sprung out of the tender meat. Even the fancy smanshy cheese and onion stuff was bland and undeserving of the written text in the menu. Grab a beer and the chips here, but look elsewhere for simple, good eats.

That I didn't get to have a second session of drinking with Dave, one of the most awesome bartenders I have ever met.  Seriously, if you happen to be in the MGM Grand in the next two or three months, take the opportunity to sidle up the bar if you happen to see a tall bald headed dude working.  You won't regret it.  

My first night on my last trip to Vegas involved a moderately lengthy stay at the bar at Wolfgang Puck.  It was a slow night, and the bartender inquired about what was obviously a look of pain on my face.  ""I hope my face doesn't contort like that when I'm playing poker,"" I noted, knowing full well that it certainly does not.  He asked what was bothering me, I told him, and then I stated that it wasn't really a big deal (and it's not).  He then proceeded to tell me what happened to him the previous night, and let's just say it put EVERYTHING into perspective.  The night was still young, and before you knew it, there were rounds upon rounds of drinks, including two comped ones on Dave, as we ran the gamut of his own incredible night and simultaneously mocked the idea of what most people consider problems.  As I was leaving, he noted, ""You get it.""  He was talking about life.  And he gets it as well.  

There are other reasons to come here aside from incredible service.  The actual drinks at the bar were nicely prepared, including a Manhattan preparation nicely chilled with carved ice.  The bar is well stocked with fun rye whiskeys, scotches, and bourbons as moderate price points.  The Shishito peppers and short ribs I ordered may have been short of magnificent, but were solid nonetheless.  At worst, it is certainly a reasonable alternative to NobHill for those who'd like something nice while avoiding L'Atelier's pricing.  

While I get this isn't exactly destination dining and the atmosphere is kind of weird (located in the middle of the MGM Grand), it isn't a bad place, especially on Fight Night, to watch the legions of craziness descend upon MGM Grand while sipping nice cocktails and judging everyone in your vicinity.

I also enjoyed the fact that this restaurant is a late night place because we went to watch the Ka show which was until 10-11? and that place was open. It was another reason why I love the place.

My friends and I decided to try this place out and our total party members was 8. The waitress that served us wasn't that great because I didn't even know she was my waitress until the check but the bus boy that served us was excellent. The water never ran out on us because the bus boy knows when to come back every time. 

The menu that we got was pretty unique and I wanted to try everything but i only have one stomach. I got the fish of the day which was the halibut. The halibut was lay on top with the smashed corn and spinach on the bottom with roasted garlic. I really liked it. I love the corn and i love spinach so it was definitely a nice combination to me. Well its not only the spinach and corn that was great but the halibut was absolutely fresh. It had such a nice taste to it which was light yet flavorful. The inside of the fish was fresh and i can easily just slice through with my fork. I'm kinda drooling as im typing this hahaha.

ANYWAY I liked my entree' but i also got a mac and cheese with my friend and we shared half. It wasn't the greatest mac and cheese i tasted but it didnt taste bad. Personally i wouldnt recommend it though because i find it pricey and its not the best m.a.c. Although i don't recommend it and it is consider a side dish, it does get you full because there is 3 different kind of cheese in there so it is cheesylicious.

Anyway i also tried the other things which was pretty nice. I don't remember all the names anymore but most of the things that I've tried on the table was pretty good. I just personally didn't like the pizza. I mean I'm not saying that it is nasty but its like nothing special. If im gonna pay this much for a pizza that tasted around the same as most of the place then I wouldn't exactly recommend it. 

Anyway it is worth trying it out so come here if you get a chance.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,0,1,4,AiJn6FGetjuQ_r-nNgSx5Q

The truffled potato chips are an absolute must. They are the best truffled anything I ever had. Truffle fries ain't got nothing on these chips. You will want to save the dish when you're done so you can dip anything else into it.

The flat iron steak was okay. It was made medium rare the way I like it. It comes with a mustard sauce but I didn't think it really goes well with the steak or fries. The fries go better with the truffles anyway :p

First off,  I ordered a pizza and the pizza was HUGE and it was sooo delicious! I could only eat half and was sad to not be able to bring home the other half since we didn't have a fridge in our hotel room. What a waste! I hate wasting food! I should have totally shared. The prices of the pizza was around $15 but it's pretty darn big and yummy. WAY better than CPK which is roughly around the same price and yet a tad smaller.

But the worst thing about this place is its service! We waited a long long time until they finally took our order and waited over 40 minutes until our food was finally cooked. It was an insane amount of time. This was on a Tuesday night! It wasn't even a weekend but I guess they were still busy. But I still personally feel waiting nearly an hour is just absurd and retarded. They did take one of our meals off because we complained but it was just the $8 soup taken out. They should have given us 50% off the whole bill since we waited so very long.

So next time you come here. Share the pizza and enjoy it! It's delicious and I might come back just for that but as long as you know the service can possibly suck, just either accept it or don't come here at all.",ShE-cXiI7VwJ8GMixw6JOw,3,3,3,-N6ga_7rkcJpf5k-J9qZCQ

1577916,2009-12-29,3,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I was excited to finally venture out of the typical Vegas-buffet dining in my first Vegas trip minus parental units.  The moderately priced Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is the best way to enjoy a fine-dining experience without breaking the bank.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very welcoming and casual-chic, and I liked that it wasn't entirely closed off and had an 'open-air' feel relative to the rest of the hotel floor.  It's great for people-watching, quiet enough to have a chat but not too quiet that anyone would have an awkward time.  

My best road-trip buddy J got straight to business and ordered moules frites (mussels and fries) done in the traditional white wine, tomato-basil Meridian style.  Served with bread slathered in a bearnaise, WPB&G got this classic just right.  Mussels were meaty, and PLENTIFUL, the fries were herbed and crisp.  The juicy stock leftover from the mussels portion was great to eat with bread.

Our male contingent sprung for the market-priced fish of the day, which was pan-seared and served in a tomato broth of sorts akin to a bouillabaisse.  Unfortunately, he got the 'worst pick of the night' reward, because the tomato sauce drowned out the delicate taste of the fish.

My order?  I chose the most disgusting thing on the menu--calves liver.  But guess what.  It was good.  The hickory and glazed crust lent a certain sweetness that hid the livery taste...well, up until the last 1/4 piece when I couldn't finish it because it was just too much.  That it was served with crispy onion strings, cipollinis, sauteed spinach and pancetta definitely helped as well.

You go eat because Vegas has become a haven for foodies within the last ten years (and because you're a bit of a chunky monkey who thinks about food first). Anyway, fast forward to us driving around with both our phones tuned to the Yelp! app to find a good place to eat. Thankfully we skipped the likes of IHOP and Denny's near the airport to find a Wolfgang Puck's restaurant open 24/7 in the MGM. Yeah that's right, forget the little sandwich delis that used to be the only place a gambler could get a late-night bite in a casino, it's now all celebrity chefs and gourmet food.

The restaurant is terraced slightly higher than the gambling floor, but has a completely open view so you can munch away and do some people watching at the same time. The menu had several good options, but we decided on the Truffle Potato Chips and Wood Oven Mushroom pizza. The truffle potato chips are crazy good; fresh fried potato chips that are still warm drizzled with a super rich blue cheese sauce and topped with with bits of truffle. How can you read that description and not start to salivate? The pizza was also solid.

Our waiter was very attentive in taking my order.

I ordered the 8oz. Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts with bacon. A glass of Stella and a water.

I ordered my steak medium, I wanted to substitute but the waiter said he couldn't do that, in return I ordered the Brussels sprouts. The steak was BADLY cooked. It was burnt on the outside, overly cooked. While inside was cooked correctly. I couldn't get past the burnt taste every time I bit into it. The steak was chewy and I found nerve tissue in the steak as I tried my best to swallow it. 

The potatoes were ok, they were over whipped or diluted. The taste was absent, but the asparagus was nicely cooked. The Brussels sprouts were also nicely cooked BUT the bacon had so much fat I wasn't even sure the taste was there, it felt like it may have been old or stale. 

I informed the waiter of the displeasure with the steak. Rudely he replied..., "" what do you want me to do?"" And walked away. Never returned to check on me. I asked for my check and he said, ""sure, I'm busy with two other large order I'll get to you when I'm done."" The bill summed up to about $92 dollars.

5 stars - Focaccia topped with caramelized onions. Complimentary. This was the highlight of the bread basket that everyone was clamoring over. The focaccia was savory, soft, warm, and really got us all hungry for dinner. 

4 stars - Vegetable Pizza. Oven Roasted Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Mozzarella, and Nicoise Olives. My favorite kind of pizza is always one that starts with a base of pesto and cheese. This one hit the spot. I liked the thin crust that had just enough veggies to not weigh down the pizza or make it soggy.

4 stars - Spaghetti. Plum Tomatoes, Garlic, Sweet Basil, and Pecorino Romano. Thank you for getting the pasta right. It was cooked to a perfect al dente with a nice chew to the spaghetti. The marinara sauce was a good balance of sweet tomato and savory garlic and Romano cheese. I liked every twirl of spaghetti with this dish. Very good.

Our table got a few desserts to share. The chocolate soufflé was the favorite, served with a scoop of ice cream and chocolate sauce. Second were the beignets served with a berry jam.

We did get awesome food though and their chicken noodle soup is superb, tastes really homemade. A personal thing I dislike about these types of restaurants though is that they have the water glasses out forever until someone sits at the table, that makes the glasses smell bad once you put water in them. I think it's just me though, but I had to stop breathing when I drank water so I wouldn't have to smell the wet dirty glass smell. Like I said though, this is a personal thing, and maybe other people can't distinguish the ""smell"" like I can.

I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the cod, the salmon was extremely good and so was the cod, the salmon took the cake though. We had a side of brussels sprouts (I love them) and the pork belly bacon they used was very awesome as well, I could have just ordered two sides by themselves and made it a meal!

Overall, I loved it and will go back when we go back to Vegas. We were staying at the MGM so the walk from our room to the restaurant was negligible which was also a huge plus!",Dd7uwiEAswehcG2idKB5IA,0,0,5,Kpm3rlNmrPvBpzZttOGLmg

This soup totally blew me away. The broth was so herby and flavorful, I couldn't bare to let a single drop remain in the bowl when I was done. There was tons of barley, good sized chunks of beef (but still bite sized), and some other vegetables in the mix. I kept eating it slowly because I wanted to make sure I savored each bite. I cannot compliment this soup enough.
My main course was the salmon served with potatoes, arugula and asparagus ($32). I ordered the salmon medium well, and it came out perfect. A light crunch to the outside, and tender, juicy meat on the inside, and it was seasoned perfectly. The vegetables were delicious and cooked perfectly. They had the right balance of tenderness with crunch. I paired the meal with a glass of riesling ($11), which could have been sweeter, in my opinion (I love the really sweet wines), but it was still a nice wine.
The atmosphere is pleasant, especially with the decor of the panes of leaves and flowers throughout the restaurant.

1741329,2011-02-08,12,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"***Not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas (though still pricey), Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***

Despite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in Las Vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, which is located on the casino floor of the MGM hotel, so convenient.  I believe it is open all day and Wolfgang Puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.

Despite its convenience, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  Most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but I have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good Vegas restaurants put out.

Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  It is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  Maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  The decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.

We started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) potato chips, which were topped with a chunky and rich Maytag blue cheese sauce.  The housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  Overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.

We also shared the Chinois Chicken Salad, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a Chinese mustard vinaigrette.  Overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original Chinois Chicken Salad from Chinois on Main in Santa Monica.  The reason was that the salad was over dressed.  It kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).

For my entree, I had the BLT, which included maple glazed pork belly, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  The pork belly was sweet and flavorful.  I thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the pork belly here lacked that tender texture.  Instead, the pork belly's texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  It was still good, but I would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) pork belly over the spare rib-like texture here.

The lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  Like the potato chips, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  I was not a big fan of the sourdough.  The bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  The BLT came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.

I tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  I had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at Drago Ristorante in Santa Monica.  The pasta dish at Wolfgang Puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  That being said, I liked Drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.

Service was very good.  The waiter Jeremy was a very nice guy.  He was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.

Prices for lunch were okay.  There were several options here that were around $20 or less.  You would pay about the same at some of the Las Vegas cafes, but I imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.

Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  I've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  That is what makes Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a decent and safe option for lunch in Las Vegas.

Doesn't table touch any of the tables nor have any idea of what is going on in the restaurant.

We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. It's clear that the staff are well trained and attentive. My wife ordered the salmon on a bed of spinach and tomato. I ordered fried calamari started, with the linguine & steamed clams in a white wine sauce for main course.

The calamari was prepared well, but some of calamari was rather tough - perhaps that is what should be expected when ordering seafood in the desert.

The linguine was very tasty and I would have that again - except that it seems the clams were not cleaned properly - some of them had sand in them. This makes the dish somewhat crunchy and you don't know whether there will be sand in the next bite.

My wife really enjoyed the salmon.

We enjoyed Wolfgang Puck. If the sand wasn't in the clams and the calamari was tender, I would have given this restaurant a 4 or 4.5 star (if that were possible).",b7RgUTSsspGKSom9aKKyKw,1,1,3,jCYdNVtlGvC_N_Ut-QmQFQ

-Truffle potato chips: Since I got this to go the sauce and cheese were separate which was a good thing because I didn't use the blue cheese that much.  It would've been overwhelming.  The chips were nice and crispy and the truffle sauce was a good compliment.

Wolfgang Puck was very noticeable because the restaurant is very bright and very open. Which made it look very welcoming. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very friendly and took the time to go over some popular items on the menu with us.

My husband got the burger which was soooo good! The meat patty was thick and cooked perfectly. The bun was fluffy and tasted fresh. Fries were crunchy. It was just a damn.good.burger. I got the spaghetti and meatballs which did not disappoint. I couldn't tell if the spaghetti was handmade or not, but it tasted amazing. Meatballs were perfectly flavored. And the red sauce wasn't overpowering. They also topped it with mozzarella cheese and basil which was made all the flavors come together nicely!

We got the apple crumble for dessert which was sweet and crunchy and came with vanilla ice cream! I was very impressed with this place. The food was great. Service was great.

Luckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  The dining area was set up nicely and clean.  Appearance was colorful,  modern, and quite unique.  We were served by Albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  Only that's about it.

So, we started with the Truffled Potato Chips ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  These were superb, but not anything to rave about.  I mean, I love truffle and I love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  I guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  Meh, I knew I wanted the tuna tartare instead, oh well.  

Now the Ceasar Salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  Fresh baby romaine leaves with the Ceasar salad dressing.  Though it tasted great, only I personally thought it was small for the price.  The croutons were big and tasteless as well.  

Then there was the Half Jidori Chicken ($28) with vegtables, a potato puree, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  Now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  It was excellent, but not the best ever!  Full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.  

Because of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the Nuschese Pinot Grigio ($32).  A suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  A surprisingly enjoyable wine.  Thanks again to Albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment;  And we just killed that bottle!

So, overall, I've gone to several Wolfgang Puck locations and this just confirms I'm not a fan of his style.  After spending a total of $103 for two people, I simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  This place already put me in the hole!",Wj0tIFlWz_1Uam1VDWYG5g,12,11,2,H0H1vWv0AsSc7AtYgrOeAg

I'll cut to the chase to say, our server, Evan was nice but at the end of the meal got lazy and unattentive.  The danger of an open kitchen- you can see your dessert done and no one picks it up.  Our skillet brownie sat there for 10 minutes, while the banana ice cream melted.  
No one picked it up.  It sat on the counter while the Pastry Chef paid no attention to it.  She let it rot there.  If it was me, I'd be yelling for a server or food runner. 

The other danger of a slow night is everyone standing around.  At one point, while our dessert was sitting, there were 7 servers and bussers STANDING in the back area near their POS.  This is a managers nightmare.  But we never saw a manager.  

I'm giving this dinner 2 stars for starting off good and for our food- crab cakes, chinois chinese salad, Linguine Fra Diavolo and the Wild Mushroom Ravioli.  

Servers - when you drop a check, pick it up.  Our server chose to talk to another table and never came back.  Another server picked up our check after we waited 15 min.

CRAB CAKE APPETIZER: Four small cakes, didn't hold up too well, plated with a tasty creole mustard remoulade. 

CHILI-GLAZED CHICKEN WINGS: Awkward pile of a portion, stacked like firewood on the plate. The wing I got looked like it came out of a lab and seemed to be a rib instead of a wing? Flavor of the glaze was light and wasn't spicy. 

PIZZA: Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese
Crust was amazing, prosciutto was high quality, cheese and pesto were delicious. Felt like the kalamata olives didn't work with the other ingredients, made the overall flavor profile too salty for my liking. 

BEIGNETS: Large order of seven pieces, stuffed with a light lemon filling and served with a toffee-like dipping sauce. Flavors didn't work well together but pastry was light and well-constructed.

Service and setting were alright- tables are quite small and even with just three of us, drinks, and a limited number of orders, things were crammed onto the table with barely enough room.

Decided to come here because we were staying at MGM and didn't want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out. I made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they were able to accommodate.

When we got to the restaurant, we were led to this little room near the wine rack. It was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else, so we kind of got a private room. When we sat down and looked at the menu, it had ""Happy Birthday Eric!"" on the top. I was so surprised! 5 Stars for printing out new menus just for us :) Service was amazing. Always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly. 

The menu is not too extensive, but there was a good variety of food. I ordered the ribeye and the fried calamari. The fried calamari was light and delicious, but I've never had bad fried calamari. The ribeye was very good. Cooked perfectly medium rare. Came with potatoes and some veggies. The glaze was a little on the sweet side, but not too overbearing. I was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you, it was the juiciest chicken I have ever had. Probably would get this the next time we come here. The food did take a little while to come out, but I think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time. 

All in all, food was good, service was amazing, and boy did they make us feel special. Last but not least, we had a party of 14 and they didn't even charge the 18% gratuity!! Our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us, but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received.

The food was flavorful, and obviously of high quality. 

The prices were rather steep. We countered this by ordering from the appetizer menu, and sharing a bunch of different options. 

I feel like calling this place a Bar and Grill is a tad misleading. The overall ambiance is too fancy, and the prices on the menu are too high. 

We tried:
- Steak skewers -- cooked perfectly to medium, which was a pleasant surprise! 
- Chicken wings -- WOW! What flavor! Tasty, tangy, yum!
- Brussels sprouts with confit bacon -- delightful. The sprouts were cooked until tender and caramelized. 
- Crab cakes -- tasted fresh. Plenty of crab meat! 

Other members of our party ordered the Cobb salad, the calamari, and the truffle chips. Though I did not personally try these dishes, I heard that they were all solid. 

Props to the server who made a mistake on our order, but rectified the situation without missing a beat.

Happily this Wolfgang Puck outlet fits that small niche with reasonable and very good food.

I had the 3-course prix fixe menu: heirloom salad/cheese salad, scallops (3) with reduction, and bing cherry cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream for $40.

They said that both their dishes were good. Additionally, I had ice tea ($3.50) and other person had two glasses of sparkling wine ($9 each). Total before tip was $112.62. Cheaper for Vegas.

The food was excellent and it had lot's of flavor. The service was also great. We got our food in like 10 minutes. The prices were a little pricey but that's ok. Another reason I rated this place 5 stars was that their Menus weren't greasy. Many restaurants have fancy menus but they are very greasy and covered in oil because they never change them.

The place is also pretty clean. We had a Japanese American waiter that always refilled our water. My son has an egg allergy so we asked the waiter if their pasta has eggs. The waiter said that they had eggs but he suggested that we could get rice noodles that were gluten free. We said no thanks so we asked him for a grilled cheese sandwich and asked if there bread has eggs. The waiter checked then said it has no eggs but then he said the fries that come with the grilled cheese are fried in the same basket as the calamari which is covered in egg coating. We said it was ok.

We enjoyed the food very much. I would recommend this restaurant to other people. Again, the only thing is that the food is a bit pricey.",d75ss01ehIHY9FVWoUduxQ,1,0,5,dAfHMwfz8C1LGZYMIqhgmg

1888225,2011-10-11,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"These are my top 5 favorite things about this restaurant:

1.  They are open from 11:30 a.m. until LATE into the night (I think they close at 6 a.m. in fact), so if you're looking for a classic lunch, a great dinner, a post-midnight snack or a very early breakfast, this is your place (they actually serve breakfast items from 11 p.m. onward).

2.  Location, location, location.  They're right in the center of the MGM next to the Ka (Cirque du Soleil) theater and easily accessible from everywhere.

3.  On their lunch menu they have an amazing BLT which I often get without the ""B ""(thereby making it vegetarian-friendly).  It's awesome with or without the meat (maple glazed pork belly) thanks to the wonderful combo of guacamole, arugula, and tomato on grilled sourdough.  I would also suggest getting their delicious onion rings on the side instead of the pasta salad. 

4.  The Chinois salad - with or without chicken - is a Wolfgang classic and a consistently great dish.  I believe it's available on every menu (lunch, dinner and late night).

5.  The service is always friendly and prompt.

Some other items that deserve a mention: tuna tartare, corn chowder (when available), and pretzel bread.

My only criticism is that the desserts always seem off - we've tried the pies on multiple occasions and they consistently have that ""refrigerator"" flavor.  But overall, I love this place and highly recommend it.",cDxZRQHmr2bDuRH93beDRw,1,0,4,pAt_RArAZ_wLBUrCjc17Sw

Service:
The service was good. Everyone was friendly and we got our meal/drinks in a reasonable time limit. And the waiter didn't push us to get anything that we didn't really want. 

Food:
Pizza - I didn't like this pizza neither did my boyfriend. I guess we have a pretty high standard for pizza. The pizza was pretty greasy, which made the crust wet and everything tended to slide off the pizza. Also the pepperoni wouldn't tear that easy so we ended up eating the whole pepperoni at once. 
Pasta (linguini with clams) - I loved it! The pasta was home-made and you can really taste the freshness. The chewiness and thickness was perfect, which was a big must for me. The favor could of been a little bit better, but it was good enough for me. 

Price: Each entree is about $20-50, which is pretty normal for places in vegas.

The Truffle potato chips are extremely good and if I do return, it would mainly be to have these again. I did think that the blue cheese taste dominated though.

The Short ribs was a fairly generous portion. It was cooked well too. But it was fairly basic... just short ribs and spaetzle. I would've preferred some other ingredients or sauces that complimented the short ribs better. 

Had some of my wife's Cobb salad which was ok. But the lettuce seemed a little soggy. Overall, it was a fairly standard Cobb salad that you could get at any salad joint.",Qx8WMsFNHBfx6rIH_G0nBw,1,1,3,eFU0MjBVAe8Y3k2AhjCEdg

I couldn't decide between salad or pizza and settled on ordering both and requesting a box right away to take the left overs.  The waiter informed me that I could get a half salad, which I did and it was the perfect amount.  I had the chopped vegetable salad with olive bread and creamy greek dressing.  I expected the bread to be soft, but it was fried croutons.  Pretty tasty, but more tangy/vinegary than I expected out of a ""creamy"" dressing.   The pizza was huge.  I had the mushroom, leek, and goat cheese.   Shared with friend and still took half home.  Friend had the cuban sandwich, her plate looked a little sad with just the grilled sandwich and a handful of chips and vast empty plate area crying out for a pickle or green garnish of some sort.  It was pretty tasty, but not really what I expect from a cuban.  The roasted pork had a citrusy marinade and was juicy, but I don't think it went well with the cheese and pickle (sweet).

Hungry and tired from the long flight (just kidding it was only an hour) we needed to have lunch and a drink. We had our 21-year-old Grandaughter with us, and found it just weird to hear her order a drink- She was a baby just yesterday. She got carded and took great joy in showing her ID. The bartender spotted it immediately. He surprised her later with a fabulous dessert.
I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and I must say, they were right up there with some of the best. Mr. H enjoyed a scrupulous pulled pork sandwich. Our girl ordered a Pizza. It's true that the old Wolfgang knows his pizza. If this franchise were in Oakland I would start eating pizza.  
Now, for baby girls dessert. On a very large plate, a slice of banana cream pie was placed next to a halved Bruleed banana. I believe that was the best banana I ever tasted. I mean really...who brulees a banana. ""Nothing says dessert like a propane torch"".
Yes there was even a dollop of whipped cream. AND, on the plate, in chocolate, was a hand written Birthday wish. What a fabulous way to arrive in Las Vegas.
Our experience was so great that we decided at that moment to have our Thanksgiving dinner there. It too was amazing.

1967472,2015-08-02,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"""Wolfgang Puck"" equals top-notch cooking with the sensible, clean tastes of California cuisine. But then there's ""Bar and Grill"" which equals accessible, unpretentious food. And this combination is exactly what this restaurant provides.
The menu was mostly pizzas and pastas in the $15 to $25 range plus the usual range of entrees ranging from $25 to the more than $50 steaks.

Jeannene and I went with the the crispy-fried calamari appetizer. The batter and tenderness is what you would expect from any restaurant, let alone Wolfgang Puck's, but the star of this plate was the lemon aioli which was the perfect thick (but not goopy) creamy consistency and had the necessary acid. For the main course, I had the rigatoni with sweet fennel sausage bolognese. It was a creamy bolognese, which I've never had, and the rigatoni were half the size than the pasta I'm used to. Both were improvements as the pasta was not clunky and the sauce had the cheese factor you often expect in an Italian dish.
Jeannene had a corn tortellini that she had no compaints about.

To drink, I had the Trampled Rose, which featured rye whisky with five-spice syrup and cranberry liquor. The sweetness countered the blunt rye, which in turn kept the sweetness from being cloying. It tasted like Thanksgiving. Normally I get two different drinks but this time I demanded an encore,

As far as ambiance, it is an open-walled dining room in the MGM Grand's casino so it is either irritatingly noisy or full of energy depending on your mindset going in. As for me, the simple, perfect foods lowered the level of pretenciousness so I'm going with ""calm amid the casino storm.""",U2N1EymyF7f20UVfR6k5Xg,0,0,4,iyK3Oj34cuIcIMPPblBhpQ

For dinner, we had an amazing Thanksgiving feast. Don't tell my family, but it was the very best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had. It was three courses, starting with a Beet & Burrata salad and ending with a pumpkin pie fancy type dessert.

For the entree, there was turkey (white breast meat), an amazing shredded dark meat (I usually hate dark meat!), sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. It was $49 at lunch for this menu, and $55 at dinner time. My husband and I most definitely shared this and we left waddling. There is no way one person should ever consume that quantity of food.

We went with a chopped salad and the nightly special of a 19-oz bone-in ribeye with roasted potatoes and broccolini. 

I mentioned that we were sharing and the waiter/kitchen was so kind to have split the salad for us (I guess they didn't want to clean my mess haha!). 

The had the dressing on the side for the salad to keep our late-night dinner somewhat light. The chopped salad was refreshing. A mix of baby butter lettuce and spring mix, cherry tomatoes, haricots, garlicky crotons, black olives and topped with freshly grated Parmesan. 

Then the entree arrived. MAN! The ribeye was beautiful. Topped with a red-wine reduction. The steak was cooked perfectly- ask for medium-rare +. 

Otherwise you aren't eating it the right way!

Nicely seasoned and perfectly seared on the outside. Lots of cracked peppercorns which I like. 

The meat was tender and juicy. Medium-Rare + gives the center a nice red-pink. Not too bloody and definitely not overly medium where it gets too tough. The both of use were silent as we ate. Just savoring the meat lol! The hubs was using the meat juices that had mixed with the wine reduction as additional sauce for each slice of meat..nothing left on the plate it was that good. 

I think had it not been such a nice restaurant, one of us would be gnawing on the bone!

Service was excellent very attentive by our waiter and the other wait staff. Our water never went empty. 

The dishes on our neighboring tables all looked amazing. Someone had the Seared salmon with quinoa and the double-cut pork-chop with whipped potatoes. I was a little jealous, but not really!

It was mostly white crunchy ends and maybe 30% leafy greens. $17 for a flat and bland marguerita pizza (translation: slivers of basil, cold tomato sauce and what appeared to be 4 thin slices of mozz).

The calamari was so tender and the breading was light.  I don't remember many details on the slaw that was with it because it was pretty bland.  Didn't matter to me though since the calamari was so good.  We also ordered the Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers.  The steak was melt in your mouth good! I'm not a big fan of any type of sauce on steaks, but the house steak sauce complimented the meat!  There were 6-7 skewers on the place and the meat was a few bites per skewer.

Strange to say that the decor was actually quite elegant and simple, especially since it was right smack in the casino, but while in the Wolfgang Puck bubble, you'd nearly forget that there's a casino all around it. 

Our server was very accommodating and funny, without being obtrusive.

The menu isn't overwhelming and a fwe items actually caught my attention. We ordered the corn chowder soup, burger with avocado and bacon with fries, organic chicken with veggies and yukon gold potatoes and the vanilla creme brulee.

The bread basket was a great way to start the meal, crusty, warm, doughy bread with a ton of soft slightly salted butter. They had an olive bread too whichw was just OK. The soup wasn't spectacular, it was more soup and less chowder in terms of consistency, but was flavored well either way.

Our entress looked yummy. I will admit though that the burger looked much more appetizing. Generous serving of fresh avocado and thick cut bacon atop that burger. Pretty sure he liked it. The chicken was seasoned nicely, tender and moist, although nothing to write home about.  I should have opted for either pizza or a burger as well.

I'm typically a huge fan of creme brulee, but this particular dish was missing the vanilla part of its name, and was very eggy less custardy, if that makes sense. Actually didn't finish it if you can believe that. 

Overall, I would have probably fancied my meal better had I ordered something else, but that's what second reviews are for.",P6_r7O8zEjnxTSBkS6WYfg,3,3,3,4t7WbihbenmAcwnX5G8BkQ

Let's start off the least liked item we ordered... The truffle chips with blue cheese sauce. They were mediocre. They didn't have an over powering blue cheese taste, however had a strong smell of the truffle oil. Also They are potato chips not fries. 

Second item we ordered was the Caesar salad. And wow it was delicious. It isn't a classic Caesar salad because the dressing they use is a garlic dressing. But wow it is really really good. (Mouth is watering as I am typing the review). The romaine leaves were not chopped up, but more of a rustic approach. With tomatoes on top. And a few croutons on top.

Third item we ordered was the spaghetti and meatballs!! Holy moly!!! This was one of the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. The meat balls are homemade. We had them split it for two and man it is a lot of food! We couldn't even finish it. 

They also give complementary bread, however we opted out. Didn't get to try the dessert but I am sure it's great since everything else was fantastic. The staff here is very friendly. Would def. come

the crabcake appetizer with creole mustard sauce is so good it is worth the $18 price.  the pizzas are good, but the linguini with clams is better - the taste of the italian bacon brings out the flavor.  the lasagna is very good but will clog an artery.  

Wine selection by the glass is very small and unimpressive.  The servers are not overly friendly - I was here 4 times in less than a week and the same bartenders didn't seem to recognize me.

2205382,2013-12-31,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Chinois Chicken Salad: O how I love thee. In the midst of a heavenly mustard vinaigrette rests a mound of hand-picked vegetation, poultry, and cashews. What a dramatic presentation and reasonable cost for a dish that will absolutely blow your mind.

The fusion of two worlds into one salad dish shouldn't be overlooked. Roasted sesame seeds, peanut oil, soy sauce, sesame oil, Napa cabbage, carrot thins, snow peas...the list goes on. Asiatic Americana, perhaps? Crisp and fresh, the cabbage was the captain of this dish and the chicken slices played the role of commander in chief--fortifying the plate with a cosmopolitan tenderness.

If this fresh and crisp salad isn't enough to satisfy your palate, try the Rigatoni with fennel sausage in a light bolognese base. Wolfgang reaches a happy medium between sweet and savory--think of the midpoint between traditional marinara and vodka sauce. The pasta tubules are firm, but not too firm. Perhaps a tad over-salted, but this is compensated for with an appropriate spice-heat level, accentuated by the sausage (blended inconspicuously into the sauce base.)

The service was of a high caliber and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. My expectations were exceeded, especially for Vegas, as servers were extra-courteous, smiling--indicating a happy-to-help attitude, and appropriately checking in on the quality of the meal.

This particular review would warrant 5 stars, however I determined that a reasonable deduction should be made for the length of time in meal preparation: the time between order and arrival exceeded 50 minutes. I'm no fan of rushed foods, but the dishes ordered could have been prepared more expeditiously.

There are just too many other choices that are better than where this place stands today. Hopefully they will get it together but I am not betting on it.

2230105,2016-01-18,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I have eaten here 3 times in the last year and I ordered the same thing each time; half Jidori chicken. The chicken is deboned, save for one piece on the wing. The skin comes out beautifully crispy, and the meat is so juicy and flavorful. Adding to the flavor is the Rosemary sauce that is served on the chicken. It truly is the best chicken I have eaten. It also comes with mashed potatoes and greens, both of which are good, but are overshadowed by the chicken. 

My gf ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which were equally as good. The sauce is flavorful, and the meatballs were tender and juicy. Not to mention the pasta was perfectly cooked. 

For dinner they serve bread; so crusty white bread and focaccia. The focaccia is my favorite as there are caramelized onions on top. For dessert we tried the creme brûlée. There were tons of vanilla beans in the custard and a nice layer of sugar on top. 

I tried some English breakfast tea to finish my meal, it was average but the most disappointing part was how expensive the tea was. In terms of value, most of the dishes were reasonably priced, and portions were enough to satisfy you. 

With all these positive remarks, why just 4 stars? Service. The first two times we are here, the service was impeccable. The waiter was attentive and had good conversation. The busboys and servers were prompt and attentive. But the last time we went, our waitress was terrible. She was slow, only checked up on us once during the entire meal, and we had to chase her down to get our check. Other people in her area also had the same issues.

But no, my husband assured me he was telling the truth. If Yelp was to be believed, there was a Wolfgang Puck restaurant open until 6 a.m. We'd been burned by high-end late night dining before - places closed during dead times, menus more limited than even the limited ones advertised. But still, we are night owls, and we desperately want to believe in something other than cafe fare or Thai at 2 a.m.

""But it's Wolfgang Puck,"" I dithered. See, we had once watched Puck rather gleefully butcher a duck on a late night talk show. Mike and I love ducks. We don't eat ducks. We had decided right then that we didn't care for someone who could laugh while using a cleaver on one.

But we were also hungry. And, let's face it, all of our favourite chefs butcher ducks. We just don't happen to see them. And we do love trying new places...

""I'm not going to sit in some trendy high stool with my short legs swinging,"" I told Mike in the car. ""And I don't want to deal with a bunch of clubbers talking loudly and importantly about their own awesomeness at the next table,"" I warned him. ""And if it's loud, forget it.""

We were shown to a comfortable (if slightly small) two-top in an unpretentious open area where we could watch casinogoers pass by. (Surprisingly, it wasn't noisy.) Even though it was just after 11, we got the full menu.

Mike began with the ""Chinois Chicken Salad, Candied Peanuts, Crisp Wontons, Chinese Mustard Vinaigrette."" I had a chopped vegetable salad. Mine was very nice, but Mike's salad got frothy adjectives from the first bite until, well, if you were to ask him about it now, I'm sure he could still give a five-minute talk on its virtues. They should schedule him for the next TED conference, honestly.

Mike continued his theme with the Crispy Chicken Milanese, declared to be ""really, really good"" (because he was out of words after that salad). I had a sort of mushroom Stroganoff with green beans, and I have to say ""sort of"" because it isn't on the online menu and I'm having to look at photos to jog my memory because my memory just refers to it as YUM YUM NOM NOM. 

I didn't scrape my plate clean, much as I wanted to, because everything was so delicious that we had to save room for dessert. (The leftover pasta made a fine lunch the next day. How often can you rave about the taste of the pasta and actually be referring to the noodle, not the entire dish? That's how good it was - I was gushing about the taste of the noodle itself!)

To reluctantly finish what was an unexpected taste bonanza, Mike ordered the caramelized lemon meringue pie (with blueberries). I ordered the cherry cheesecake with pistachios (also not on the online menu). We both then ordered our butler to kidnap Wolfgang Puck and force him to be our personal chef. (Because in the fantasy where we can afford Wolfgang Puck as our personal chef, we can also afford a butler. Although our true fantasy at this point was probably a private chauffeur, then we could've spooned in the back of the limo, basking in the afterglow of such a meal.)

I don't know if I can forgive Puck about the duck, but cognitive dissonance is no problem when your brain's being pumped full of happiness chemicals after a meal like this.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,2,2,5,NrzmdmaopnrN-bmCERceog

I cut through the breast very carefully so as to not damage the freshwater pearl that must have been in there. I never found it.

That was my first night in Vegas. It was a wake-up reminder that I wasn't in Austin anymore. But Wolfgang's is the only sit-down place open after 10:30pm in the MGM. This means 2 subsequent visits, each more stellar than the first. Both exercised my economic know-how.

Visit 2: mussels with frittes. Yummmm. Huge serving, enough to share. But saying the word ""share"" is saying ""charge me an extra $4.50 because I don't know what else to do with that money."" Dumb. As the words were coming out of the boy's mouth, I knew we were toast. .. toast wedges came with the mussels... Hold on while I yummmm again.

 I am not really big into dining at franchise restaurants with famous executive chefs but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.

I ordered a burger with bleu cheese and was shocked at the beautiful presentaion, size and flavor. It was big enough where two people could share and be satisfied.

The side of fries were salty but decent. I mean there fries.

Four Stars


I was very impressed by the food and service.  We were given water and bread upon sitting down.  There were three types of bread (Olive, Rustic, and Cheese).  The 2012 Elk Cove Pino Grigio from Willamette Valley had a definite crispness and acidity with a touch of sweetness.  The chopped Salad  had Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Tomatoes, Black Olives, Pickled Okra, and Creamy Greek Dressing.  It was light and refreshing and was not overpowered by the olives. The Spaghettini was simple but well executed.  The house-made al dente noodles acted a perfect vehicle for the plum tomato, basil, and garlic marinara sauce.  The Grilled Shrimp Capellini with Jumbo Shrimp was similarly delicious.  The Shrimps were a little over but the pasta and spicy sauce hit the spot.",L7VEJP1RrpXRRRWsYIu3tA,2,0,4,aYw9LME19johQiyLwSX6Rg

His restaurant in the GTA failed, his line of soups can oven be found in the clearance bins at the grocery store, and his line of over-priced sandwiches in airports are a joke.

So when a salesrep offered to take me to Wolfgang Pucks Bar & Grill I was a little trepidatious.

Its a very open concept restaurant in the heart of the gaming floor near the Cirque du Soleil store.  We were looking for a casual dining experience and that's what we got.

As an appetizer we started off with mac and cheese and a house salad shared across the table.  The Mac and cheese was awesome.  The cheese was creamy with a distinct flavour.  If my 6 year old were present even he would have loved it.

For the entree I had the wood-fired chicken pizza.  I picked it because it had a number of veggies on the pizza as well.  It tasted good going down.  The portion size was quite filling.  I couldn't finish the last slice.

We walked in around 9:30 and were told the bar seats were our only option. No problemo, we are simple diners and just needed a quick bite after a long, arduous day in Sin City.  

As a self-described brussel sprouts aficionado, I would say - DO NOT order the Brussels and Bacon. They were glazed with some type of sweetish sauce that was just not good. I took one bite and then decided that I would reluctantly pick out and eat all of the bacon (which my friend didn't seem bothered by). Then I just prodded and pushed the sprouts all around the plate, which is when our bartender seemed to take notice. He asked how things were and we gave him our honest response and he offered to remove them from our bill - an offer that we happily accepted. 

The Wolfgang Cabernet was delicious and paired well with the Rigatoni that I ordered. Michelle had the mushroom ravioli which she said was good (I took her word for it because I loathe mushrooms).

We started out with the Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese and man, this sh*t was bomb!  I normally don't like blue cheese at all, but it must have been a really good grade because it tasted great and didn't smell at all.  

After we shared the Spicy Soprasata, Salami Toscana and Pepperoni with Green Chilies Pizza and this even topped the chips!  If you've ever read my reviews or been to Gaspare's and ordered the Bruce's Special, you're gonna love this pizza.  Not as good, but great in its own way because it's different.  

Didn't have any trouble with slow service like other reviewers stated, but we did sit at the bar and took it back to the room.  Bartender was very friendly and made sure we always had water, lol.

I am definitely looking forward to coming here again and sampling items apart from the late night menu.

Wolfgangs burger is the way to go. Great quality. Charred meat on the outside and medium rare on the inside. They even cut the burger in half if you wanted to share. 

Pizza was bland and tasteless. There was no flavor and it lacked salt.

The salads are HUGE but you can ask for a half order (which I did the second time). 

Butter Lettuce Caesar: 5/5 - love that it has anchovies, Humboldt Fog Cheese, garlic croutons.  The texture of the butter lettuce has a great crunch without being too watery like green leaf can be (w/ the stem).

Chopped Vegetable Salad: 4/5 - it was a very hearty salad - similar to what veggies you would get in a Greek salad; includes Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Creamy Greek Dressing

Sautéed Maine Crab Cakes:  5/5 - the textures worked really well together.  The crab cake had a crisp outside and full of crab on the inside; served with tomato relish, and a delicious basil aioli; just wished they had this as an entree.

Pizza - Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese:  3/5 - the crust could be more crunchy and less soggy, but they really loaded the toppings on, especially the prosciutto.

Pizza - Spicy Sopressata, Salami Toscana, Pepperoni, Sausage, Red Onions, Goat Cheese, Jalapenos:  3/5 - big serving and lots of toppings, but the crust would be better if it weren't soft/soggy in the middle, but more crunchy.",HLZ9mEZbu1vx1YKMk-1B6A,1,0,4,TS6_ejEggK1fn48bFFQZ9Q

The decor is modern and the tables are exposed to the casino floor but are comfortably far enough to not feel like your being watched by passers-by. We started with the beef skewers and calamari. The calamari was delicate and seasoned nicely. The breading could have used a tiny bit more crunch. The skewers were cooked to a perfect med-rare and still managed to have some char marks on the outside. Drawback, the meat is fatty and can be gristley and can't necessarily be bitten off the skewer without having to gnaw on it for a minute. Pretty embarrassing if your making out with a skewer in front of others because you're trying to pull off a bite. Best forego the skewer stick and use a knife and fork. I had the Chicken Jadori with cauliflower instead of mash pot. The chicken was delicious. It was an open, almost entirely deboned half chicken (only thigh bone), that was seasoned and broiled creating a wonderfully crisp seasoned crust that contrasted the juicy hot chicken underneath. The dish was great with texture, freshness and portion. The flavor was on point but about half way through gets a bit salty from the crisped seasoning. I was ok with it though.

Let's get right into the food. I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with pine nuts + the blue cheese potato chips (or whatever they are called). 

The chips were delicious, well worth $12 or so. Perfectly crisp chips with a generous amount of toppings and cheese. 9.1/10.

The ravioli, hmmnn, I'm not sure but I was a little thrown off bite by bite. There's balsamic in the dish but it's plated along with what I think is melted butter... sometimes you get a bite with too little and sometimes you'll get some with too much acidity. I'm conflicted of whether or not they should have garnished with the pine nuts or not as they sprinkle them in the middle... it's not too little that you ignore them but it's not so much that it's apparent it should be part of the dish. Overall the squash was really overpowered and also very minimal amount stuffed into them. I know because one fell apart and I saw how little came out. This dish I believe was $24 and I'll give it a 6.8/10

The server was really attentive until it came time for the bill, sat there for what seemed like an eternity although maybe he thought I wanted to enjoy my tea. 

I didn't get water, actually, not only did I not get water but everyone around me got water and a refill; I eventually had to ask. 

No spoon for my honey, which I thought was weird. I would have used the spoon that I got in my place setting but there wasn't one in there. 

Not sure I would come back. I wouldn't mind it if it was on someones agenda based on location convenience but there are a hundred other places I'll go first. 

The total for my bill after tip was $55. That includes hot team, the potato chips, and the pasta.",OHLr0T6mAF31tcjSskvK4w,1,0,3,lSo5OEOJEjUMSL2WAZUhlw

It's pretty good food but the service was slow.

Then my boyfriend wanted the chocolate soufflé but they were also out of that. The Crème brûlée was decent but not amazing and the ice cream sandwich was very good and creative. Also the cherry sunrise is a nice and tasty drink! Unfortunately we had to wait a while to get the check and then for the waitor to pick up the check as well. The bus boy was very attentive!

We were staying at the MGM hotel and after coming back from Fremont street we decided to go back to the hotel, do some gambling and have a slow night. But first, we were hungry so I found great reviews about this place on yelp and it was on my hotel. Kaaaaching!

We decided to go with small plates to share between two. We picked a chopped vegetable salad (cucumbers, zucchini, tomatoes, onions, peppers) that came with feta cheese, garlic croutons in a creamy greek dressing. Best salad I've ever had. It was so light and all the vegetables tasted amazingly crisp and fresh! The garlic croutons were a dream and the feta and dressing brought it all together.

We also ordered the spicy tuna tartare with avocado, pickled ginger, cucumber, and sesame wontons. Delicioussssss!!! Beautiful fresh chopped tuna and perfectly balanced dish. 

It's hard to say which of the plates was the favorite but the truffle potato chips with the maytag blue cheese sauce were so freaking good. I can't emphasize it enough. The truffle chips are topped with a warm blue cheese sauce that elevated them to perfection.

For dessert we had a Smore pie. Chocolate cream pie in a graham cracker crust, with toasted marshmallow and vanilla ice cream. OMG. WINNER!!!

2803118,2018-03-07,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"This will be a review of my experience and my meal in the order I received it. 
As I sat, I found the bar area to feel a little crowded, the TV was too high to comfortable view from the bar, and the bartender was pleasant. I hate the fact that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on beverage service at any of the ""M-life"" Hotels (or whatever - thats the rewards card anyway LOL), as I am a Mt Dew and Pepsi product person myself, but not much you can do about that. I had a can of Root Beer, which was okay, a little different, a little gourmet, but what you would expect at a little nicer restaurant. They had a large variety of liquor, from cheap to very high end, definitely something for everyone. I believe they had an extensive selection of quality Scotch of varying ages as well, if I'm not mistaken, although I don't drink when I go to dinner typically. 
I ordered the chicken soup, Mesquite Steak, and a side of french fries. 
The Chicken Soup was a bit different.. IDK if it was the herbs, garnish, or what but it didn't taste like chicken noodle soup. It wasn't bad, but not something I would get again.. The broth was not chicken flavor like what you would expect from a typical chicken stock made with chicken and a traditional mirepoix of onion, celery, and carrots. The noodles were great, I would have liked my carrots to be cooked (not still crunchy..) but understand that may not be the same for everyone. I have the ability to, and often do, eat at upscale or higher end establishments - the kind where they don't put salt & pepper on the table because the thought of salting a chef's creation to your liking might damage his precious ego LOL - so I understand that things are cooked and prepared much differently than they would be at a steakhouse w/ a lower price point. However, I wish this restaurant (and others) would give the option to go for a different side. For instance, as I said, I also ordered the Mesquite Ribeye which came with a sautéed broccoli and tomato concoction which I was not at all interested in trying.
I was a little disappointed to look at the menu on the board out front (electronic) and find a meal only to end up with a different menu inside. Not sure what happened but I initially hoped to get a different steak preparation that was on the menu out front, but wasn't on the menu when I sat down. There was one bartender that was pleasant and outgoing, I sat at the bar BTW, there was another gentlemen behind the bar in orange (like the wait-staff) that didn't talk or didn't talk very much, the same seemed true of the (rest of the) wait staff... What I mean is, when presented with your food there's typically a short conversation along the lines of - ""here's ur food..."",   ""Need anything else?"", ""enjoy!"", etc... I didn't get that, but the bartender checked in and I was okay with everything, just wanted Salt - shoot me LOL, which they brought me. Overall, the meal was Good. 
The steak was done to my liking, it's always nice to find someone that knows how to cook a steak to a medium temperature, and the ""Mesquite"" flavor was good. It was not anything overly flavored - it wasn't lacking flavor either, it was a pleasant addition to the normal flavor. The steak was a quality cut, not overly fatty, and was trimmed correctly for a ribeye, again - something nice to find is a person the doesn't under trim or over trim a steak that's meant to have some fat in it. The meat was tender but firm, as it should be, and it was a good steak. 
I also ordered French Fries, as they arrived, which was more than I could say for the waiter who I bumped with my arm as I turned a little because it startled me when he was presenting the plate (from behind me) because, as I said, everyone but the bartender seemed to be working their way through ""Mime College"". They might have said something low or quick, but it certainly wasn't much or substantial enough for me to hear or notice, IMO. 
In conclusion:
Soup - 7/10: I ate it, it was okay, it wasn't anything I'd write home about. I know it's just ""soup"" but the stock/broth was really different to me.
Steak - 9/10: There wasn't anything in particular I would change about it, short of not getting it ""Mesquite"" (didn't see that as an option), but for whatever reason - it doesn't deserve a perfect score in my mind. 
French Fries - 9/10: They're FF, I mean, what can be reviewed and talked about with french fries!? Well, at least a little bit! I can talk about anything a little bit, LOL, they were actually REALLY REALLY GOOD!  It's hard to explain, not any one thing I can put my finger on, but they were flavorful, done to the perfect crisp-ness, not over or under cooked, seasoned and/or salted to the right amount - Just a REALLY GOOD french fry.",aWTV54s-uCE0id2JXy5K-g,0,0,4,RxL8nbROw9G-N5UEkL5Z4A

It was quite a walk through the hotel/casino to get to the restaurant, but once you get there you can't really miss it. I still can visualize it clearly--- an obnoxious, bright orange rose-patterned wall that made my head spin not only because I was hungover but really because it made a pretty ""loud"" statement.
Decor is nice and modern, and it is a pretty casual restaurant. No dress code---(I've been there, walking from restaurant to restaurant because each kept rejecting the guys' outfits) so you don't have to worry about being underdressed. DO dress casual, DON'T dress up.
Casual does not mean they're not professional! They provide good service. To be entirely honest, when we were there our server was busy tending to her larger parties. While I acknowledge that yes, larger parties do require more attention, we felt like we did not get as good as a service from her than the other table. However, the bussers and food runners did make sure we were taken care of, so the experience was  good nevertheless.
Since it was a light lunch, we got three things but it was more than enough. The wings and the skewers were amazing, I would definitely go back to get them again.

The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger.

I just had the worse experience at your restaurant at the MGM Wolfgang Puck last night with seven of my friends at about 3am... 

I ordered the eggs benedict with wild mushrooms instead of spinach. On my first bite of the mushrooms I had something weirdly chewy in my mouth. I was absolutely shocked and disgusted to suddenly discover it was a large blob of pink chewed chewing gum!! 

We immediately called over the waiter who's first reaction was to say it couldn't have come from the food because it would have been more melted -????? I flipped out and demanded to see the manager stat. 

After quite a wait and asking twice the manager came over and was very apologetic offering to comp my food and order me another. I explained there was no way I could eat ANYTHING now as I was literally sick to my stomach. I also told him that after working in the service industry for over a decade around the world (including Vegas and i personally owned a restaurant/bar here) I was surprised he wasn't going to comp the table for such a shocking health code and trust violation. He said he couldn't do that. 

As we were talking security started hovering around our table and me and my party were mortified that the manager had called security because of our complaint. I asked him if the above camera was angled towards us and he said yes. I told him to review the footage to verify the authenticity of the situation. He said the best he could do was take something of the bill. 

We were being made to feel like we were doing something wrong for complaining. The way the server, manager and security handled the situation was beyond appalling. Everyone in the restaurant was staring at us as the security just stood a couple of feet away from our table watching us eat. It was so embarrassing. At that point we closed out our check (the manager took off 25%) and we left immediately while the intimidating security hovered over us like criminals and followed us out of the restaurant

I wonder how Wolfgang would have handled the situation if he had been there himself.

I came around 3pm and the restaurant was busier than most. I was surprised!

I ordered the BLT, which was delicious. I'm a really big fan of maple glazed bacon, so I had to try the maple glazed pork belly, and I am so glad that I did. The maple glazed pork belly was AMAZING in terms of flavor. The pork belly itself wasn't melt-in-your-mouth orgasmic tasting but it definitely met expectations. I also like how they mashed up the avocados so it was more like an avocado spread rather than slices. It helps spread the avocados into each bite!

This same restaurant (with the same menu) is in the Borgata in Atlantic City. After a very positive experience there I knew it would be a definite hit on our first night in Vegas when both my husband and I were too beat to stray very far for dinner.

With so many expensive and upscale options in all of the casinos on the strip, it's nice to find a place that has all the taste and style without the insane cost.

Started out with the truffled potato chip appetizer--  Highly recommend
I had the gnocci and my husband had the spaghetti & meatballs, both delicious, and topped off dinner with a slice of the lemon cheesecake, which was big enough to split  (I do hate when places get skimpy with dessert portion size).

I started out with a delicious Moscow mule, it was a very classic Moscow mule just extra gingery, which was very nice. We stuck to a couple appetizers and dessert since a big late night meal wasn't what we were going for. We got the crab cakes, tuna tartare, steak skewers, and calamari. The crab cakes were probably the best I've ever had. It tasted SO fresh, not fishy at all and the sauce underneath it was perfect. And perfectly crispy on the top and bottom. Tuna tartare was great. Not fatty, good seasoning and taste. The steak skewers, were a touch fatty, but cooked perfectly with a great Korean style taste. The calamari is really what blew us away. It was perfectly chewy, lightly breaded, great taste, and a great sauce on the side. And FINALLY something different than a spicy aioli on the side. Really really delicious. Loved the shishito peppers that came with it as well. 
Dessert was really my only complaint. For such a big chocolate soufflé, I felt that one small scoop of ice cream wasn't enough. Overall, it was just OK.

So Mr. Wolfgang Puck was put to the test and he passed with flying colors!! 

The Puck man owners just a few (I believe he has 6) restaurants in Vegas, we decided on Puck's Bar & Grill located at the MGM Grand. I'm going to start off by saying how HOT the staff is!! They were really sweet too, extremely helpful and had the timing of the food/drinks down to a science. The décor has an elegant yet modern-bold style to it, a lot of white and glass, plus it is open so you can watch everyone walk by from the casino. 

The menu has this rustic (hence Grill in the Bar & Grill vibe) beach front bistro feel to it. Beautifully cooked and nothing short of fresh ingredients, each bite was just what was needed to satisfy the taste buds. Calamari was excellent, Spicy Tuna Tartare was mind blowing, best tomato salad I've ever had, and a tomato pizza (which I have to say at first I was like pizza really) but it ended up absolutely an excellent way to combine all the ingredients of the night. 

So what really separated the two chefs are two very important things to a diner. Flavor and price, Puck hit the flavor perfectly and what he didn't do is sacrifice your wallet to get those flavors unlike Mr. Bam. The portion sizes were just right too, unlike Mr. Bam.

Like that time you didn't want to wing-woman for your girlfriend because you had ill intuitions about the friend of the guy she likes.  This is Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill.  It bears a famous chef's name and lives inside a famous casino, yet is emptier in content than a stripper's conversation after the lap dance.

Our out-of-town friends wanted to visit Wolfgang Puck, I hadn't been there for more than a year and had no recollection of what I ate on my last visit, but out-of-town friends often get to make the decisions, so I suffered another forgettable experience at Wolfgang Puck.  We had the Pink Lady Apple & Pear Salad which was okay, if not a little drenched in dressing.  Then after our order of sea bass was rejected because the kitchen didn't get the fish that day, we got the organic chicken.  It was served on top of mashed potatoes, with roasted carrots.  Carrots were undercooked, potatoes and chicken were all right, nothing to make an impression.  

Fifty dollars for a meal I would pay around fifteen dollars...  The latter probably would have a more authentic atmosphere, not a generic view of MGM tourists.

It's a fine dining experience with a casual spin. I saw people in jeans with their beers from outside bars, as well as suits and ties. The hostess pulled my chair out for me, and the server was spot on with timing. 

We got the soup of the day ""Split Pea,"" it was yum. Also the mushroom pizza. Holy S. To die for. It had leeks, brocollini, fresh thyme and loads of salty tallegio.

Let me start by saying that the truffle potato chips were the best thing I've ever eaten in my life and I would travel back to vegas JUST for them. Anything made with truffle oil literally makes my tummy rumble with hunger when I think of it, and this topped EVERYTHING. So much flavour and deliciousness in one dish. It was like kettle chips on steroids. SOOOOO GOOD. I also had the salad (which I can't remember the name of) but it was the 'asian' one? with wonton crisps and candied cashews. I remember this salad used cabbage.. which I hate.. so when it came, I was like 'shit.' but then it tasted SO GOOD. Wow, I am seriously mindblown. What kind of chef runs this place? Excuse me for drooling all over your restaurant. Boyfriend ordered the prosciutto pizza and it made his stomach happy. I personally didn't try any since I've had pizza 2 days in a row and got sick of it already.. oops. Also, there was a guy who always made sure our water was full. Dehydration is common out in vegas but definitely not in this place, where they make sure after every few sips, YOU NEED MORE WATER.

The service was phenomenal and y'know.. us canadians.. we're used to tipping 10% where we're from (because min wage is higher), so the usual norm of tipping 20%+ was strange and uncomfortable to us since we've entered the US.

-=-Reuben-=- Not the greatest Reuben. It's a bit expensive for what you get. Rye is not the tastiest bread, but coupled with the tasteless meat cut of the corn beef and the overly spread mayonnaise, it's not gonna be good eatin for today. It was super oily for what it was. I probably wouldn't dine here again, but that famous name of familiarity will attract customers again and again.",N6llta3D8IVSPQ2k_rvWbA,0,0,3,OlrW2ThtlAP4flHRbc58QA

I waited for her to come back so I could tell her, but she did not come back until we were finished eating.

The staff was AMAZINGLY nice and attentive.  I swear the waiter must have been watching our table and only our table that night.  It felt like my water glass was being refilled every time I took 3 sips.  I also mentioned that me and boyfriend were sharing everything and they went ahead and split each dish for us ahead of time.  Great service and attention at its best!

Chicken Noodle Soup - who orders Chicken Noodle Soup in Vegas?  This gal thats who!  And if you do too then you wont be disappointed.  The soup is very light and not overly sodiumified (is that a word? oh well)

12 oz Ribeye - A little salty but chargrilled to perfection.  The side potatoes were also quite yummy.  We stopped the waiter to ask him how they were made. Its a 3 step process that allows the potatoes to be soft and mealy inside while being amazingly crispy on the outside.  If they served these with a sauce I could just order these as an appetizer all on their own.

Honestly, I have tried their seafood pasta and three different types of pizza and the food was no better than OK. The pasta was fine but nothing special and for the price they charge for it, I can cook much better myself. The pizzas, especially the vegetarian one was too salty and taste wise, it missed more of tomato (sauce) flavor which is the base of any pizza! 

I do think that for the quality of the food this place is a bit overpriced, so I guess if you are dying of hunger and you find yourself in MGM in urgent need to eat, go for it, but if you can wait few minutes, go elsewhere. 

I would not come here again for the food for sure. However, the beer selection was decent and I have to say that the service was very nice and attentive.",F80NC3wI63ocMfuXww5Wiw,1,1,3,2p529dAcY_VXo7d5KTnK2w

Located inside of the MGM Grand right next to the KA theater. We looked everywhere for it and it took some time to locate it. Looked nice and clean on the outside, wasn't many loiters when we went for dinner.

Interior = 5/5
Clean and a little small but it was nice. The noise level was okay considering the casino was right outside our seating area. It does get louder closer to and at the end of KA shows.

Service = 5/5
Very prompt. They constantly came by to check if we had full water or if we needed anything additional.

Order = 5/5
Truffled potato chips: the chips had a nice crunch and the truffle was yummy. My boyfriend was not a big fan of the bleu cheese since it overpowered the truffle a bit. It is also messy so have your napkins at the ready.

Ginger lime ice tea: was refreshing with the ginger and lime combination. Balanced out our meal.

Moscow mule: they served it in a old fashioned looking cup so I thought that was cool. It was good, the lime was strong which I liked. Wasn't too strong on the alcohol, but you can always go get drinks on the casino floor if you are looking for more alcohol.

Jidori chicken: the chicken was soft and not dried out, which is why I don't generally like to eat chicken. It had a nice crisp on the skin when you bit into it. You have to make sure you eat each chicken bite with a scoop of potatoes and their rosemary jus sauce. I was so sad when I ran out of potatoes to go with my chicken so maybe they should add more potatoes haha. 

Prosciutto pizza: my boyfriend loved this, it was very simple. The arugula complimented the prosciutto and you can taste the flavors within the pizza. I was getting full from the chicken that I didn't eat too much of the pizza. However it tasted good even after we took it home for leftovers.

Price = 5/5 
We were satisfied with the price we paid considering it was Wolfgang Puck and in Vegas. Definitely more enjoyable than the in house buffet this time around

Overall = 5/5

Hint = Go after a show starts, it will be relatively empty. If you go right when a show gets out it is super packed. Also when they ask if you want bottled or tap, the bottled is not free but super better tasting than tap.",EokuKeU16okP6LJnOo4AjQ,1,0,5,gqFWQV91HaPVK-graKbkXg

The food was what you should expect from a big name on the Vegas Strip.  The Jidori Chicken Skewers were exceptional.  The truffled chips with blue cheese sauce were fun to share and the house made gnocchi......my gosh was it special.

Fabulous....   it was such a generous size that even with sharing it, we each had a very large portion.  We loved it.  I hope I can duplicate it at home, it was soooooo good.

Spaghetti - very simple dish, yet amazing taste.

French fries were excellent

Not cheap, its moderately heavy.

I ordered the spicy wings which were the highlight of the night. They weren't overly spicy but just a hint of kick. The fried calamari was the loser of the night. Not terrible but not as crispy as I felt it should've been. The 3 cheese Mac n cheese was my Neutral dish of the night. It wasn't great but it was really good if that makes sense.

We decided to grab a bite to eat on a Friday night - wanted something good but not too expensive. Landed here based on its Yelp rating and general price point. 

EH.

For starters, the atmosphere is Vegas ... Like you can see the slots from the table so that's neither pro nor con, just note worthy. 

The staff was pleasant. Very efficient hostess and super friendly waitress. 

The food is what lost me. For starters, I actually had a kinda tough time choosing something to order. The menu kinda has variety but at the same time has a lot of similar items so if you aren't feeling a certain vibe you may find it limiting. Our issue was it sounded good but what we saw on nearby tables didn't look as great as it read. So we started out with Calamari, the man ordered the clam linguine and I ordered some mushroom pizza ... The calamari was pretty good!! Not the best I've had but definitely solid. It came with a spicy sauce that was great! The rest of our meals were very very mediocre. For the restaurant of a household name in cuisine I was very underwhelmed. Nothing was bad ... It was all just EH ... And for a $90 dinner for two in one of the dining capitals of the world I was very unimpressed.

Be careful when they ask you what water you want. They offer $9 bottles of water and they don't specify the price when they ask you if you want water. The table started off with calamari for appetizers and this was good. The only good part of the meal. The avocado green sauce was delicious and the roasted peppers that came with the calamari was a nice touch.

We walked past this restaurant and decided to give it a shot. The decor was beautiful and from the moment we walked in the service was superb. Looking at the menu I was excited to try a number of things. I settled on their house sangria, bbq chicken pizza and the blue cheese truffle chips. As soon as J heard that red snapper was the fish special of the day he knew he had to order it. We were both really impressed with the truffle chips, they melted in my mouth and I could have made an entire meal out of them. When we got our entrees I dug into the bbq chicken pizza which was good but nothing outstanding. J's excitement about the red snapper quickly faded when he realized it was completely raw on the inside. We notified the server and he quickly whisked it away to get a new piece of fish cooked. About 15 minutes later he came back with another piece of fish and had J cut into it while he was standing there and sure enough the fish was raw again. Another 15 minutes later he came back out and the fish was no longer raw (yay) but as J was eating it he didn't have much to say except for the fact that it was now so overcooked that it was dry and had lost most of the flavor. By this time it was late, he was hungry and didn't want to wait for yet another piece of fish so he still ate it. A few minutes after finishing our entrees we got a surprise from our server who brought us coffee and a phenomenal chocolate souffle on the house due to the errors with the fish. It was a really nice touch by our server because he truly did seem frustrated for us with how messed up the fish kept being.

3456990,2018-01-20,8,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"It's officially New Year's Day, 2018 during between 2 am to 3 am, I was having a big late night dinner cravings after celebrating in Las Vegas Strip outside, so I headed back inside to MGM Grand to visit to this fully operational restaurant called, ""Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill Las Vegas."" Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill serves the customers to taste their finest and signature cuisines courtesy for this well known international TV chef! The atmosphere is very active and on-going as I welcomed there. The concept is much modern and compact for this small space, but it's much roomy to sit. Of course, it's opened much later from 11:30 am to 6 am! How cool is that for an after party dinner gathering! Wowzers!

The employees here from hosts, servers, bartenders and cookers are doing a great job for making the customers like me a remarkable and well-prepared service despite the busiest environment! No cons!

Now onto the food! I ordered two items on their original menu plus a special seasonal menu: the Maine Lobster Bisque and Wolfgang Puck's signature, the Rigatoni plate. As a result, these entrees tasted very exquisite good! The Main Lobster Bisque tasted wonderfully by balancing the flavors and ingredients combined and I loved how the lobster has a nice amount of meat on it too! How clever! Finally, the Rigatoni tasted superb and magnificent! The rigatoni pasted did boiled perfectly and eatable without being too harden; the sauce and the ground beef also tasted not bad which I did loved the aromas of Marinara sauce and natural herbs and spices! What a late, late New Year's dinner that I've ever eaten!

Parking at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at MGM Grand can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby parking garage or lot if it's available, and call and request a reservation table if you want it in advance. Alternatively, you can walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.

In the end, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is the most sensational and tremendous mini restaurant that I've ever visited right inside MGM Grand in Las Vegas! Perfect for friends and family gathering especially late night goers too! A well received! My rating: 4 solid stars.",3HSmHE-FQZ7b2kyfa1e64A,24,19,4,WTYGJeFnmYwT5EQgwi7MXA
3458037,2012-09-12,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"First off, tbh, I've only been here twice. But, both times I was happy with the quality of the food served to us. 

This place is located in the MGM Casino, but once you're inside, you kind of forget you're in a casino - unless, of course, you look out the glass things. They have a cool wood design thing around the exit, and the rest is very modern. White tables, glass almost everywhere. I really like it. There's almost always a wait for it, but so far, it's only been about 10 - 15 minutes for us until we're seated. 

Generally, everything on their menu is quite pricey. However, I feel like that's simply the cost for going to a celebrity chef's restaurant. 

The first time we were here, I got the salmon, which was flaky and good. However, even though it was really empty, our food took forever to get to our table! And to top it off, everything was cold! We were so disappointed. However, our waiter at that time was very courteous. The guy (a cute one, I might add) who brought our food to the table overheard us say we were there to have a dinner celebration for my grandma's birthday. We thought nothing further of it. He disappeared for a while, because he wasn't our waiter. However, at the end of the meal, he came back with a slice of a chocolate tart for us, with a lit candle stuck into it! We were so touched that he remembered (not to mention, it was free! )


Our second time here, the food was way better. Their bread basket is a mixture of all kinds of things, including pretzel bread and carmelized onion topping square of fluffy bread. I was quite satisfied with the overall service, but I feel like the people who work here are quietly snobby. When I asked for another basket of bread (because our food was taking quite a while), the waiter made us repeat our request twice, with an incredulous expression. What? Just because a majority of the people there were pretty girls in short dresses doesn't mean I have to eat the tiny amount they pretend is enough for them. Just give me more bread without your judgement, please!

My mother got the organic chicken with veggies and yukon mashed potatoes. Let me say, I still crave those veggies. I think they were butter sauteed. Whatever it was, it was soo delicious. The chicken was yummy, as well. 

I got the lasagna, because I was craving something filling. Though many people would be outraged at me ordering something so simple, I feel like it was well worth it. There's nothing typical about this lasagna. At first glance, I was quite miffed that I had got one small looking square. However, halfway through, I realized that through it was small, whatever was in it made it really hearty. I was full about halfway through.  Yummy!

Another great thing : They're open until 6 am !",UKfIOsQR0ypT0KQ-zPXb9g,1,0,4,tAvkN8TeZBDYew7gRG12TQ

We sat at the edge of the bar & not shockingly got a lot of attention from those stopping by just for a drink. After much debate, we asked the bartender for recs. We got the pepperoni olive pizza & steak skewers. 

The pepperoni was housemade, but it may as well not have been because I couldn't taste the difference. It was overally a bit too salty (maybe they should've taken into account the saltiness of the toppings before seasoning). 

The steak skewers were tender, but the slaw wasn't dressed enough. The presentation was nice though.

Shrimp scampi: I'd never thought I'd say this but the noodles were too tough. I love my pasta al dente but this was a couple minutes before al dente.

3517518,2013-08-09,2,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I never thought twice about eating here until friends came to town and someone in the group suggested dining here. Since I'm in a money-saving mode right now dining at this mid-level spot sounded like a good idea for eating on the Strip. The atmosphere is lacking as the restaurant is completely open to the MGM Grand casino making it impossible to ignore the ringing and buzzing from slot machines or the buzzed clientele of the hotel, clubs, and dayclubs. Fortunately, the food made up for all of that.

Corn chowder soup ($12) - lots of corn kernels and bits of bacon in a velvety smooth soup. Great flavor.

Butter lettuce Caesar salad ($13) - portions are big so you may want to share. Like a true Caesar they put anchovies on it.

Spicy tuna tartare ($21) - not bad. A little on the sweet side with its use of soy sauce for its Asian influence. The flavors were ok and I liked the sesame crackers.

Lasagna ($21) - who knew you could find good lasagna in a restaurant owned by an Austrian that serves a fusion of multiple cuisines? It was a perfect combination of savoriness with the sausage bolognese and sweetness from the cheese and bechamel.

Cheese and basil pesto ravioli ($21) - I didn't try it but the person who ordered it had to send it back because it wasn't cooked all the way.

Ricotta gnocchi ($23) - dense but still tasty.

Steamed black mussels ($25) - another dish that was huge. Good enough for two to share. Plenty of plump, juicy mussels in a savory sauce.

Chicken fingers ($6.95) - always a crowd pleaser for kids. The portion size was large enough for 3 kids to share but we only have one. There were plenty of leftovers for the next two nights.

The food here is simple, as they cater to price conscious tourists who aren't adventurous eaters, but it's executed well. The menu is all over the place with Asian, Italian, and American dishes so chances are you and everyone in your party will find something to eat. It's not a destination restaurant, but certainly a good option for those staying nearby or those looking for a reasonably priced meal on the Strip.

I got the prime grill burger which was pretty good. The meat patty was pretty flavorful and tasty. Not really a fan of the puffy buns since it didn't really taste like much and was pretty much just a source of carbs. The lettuce and tomatoes were nothing special. The fries could have used some work since it was pretty soggy for the most part. If I'm going to pay more than $20 for a burger and fries, at least give me crispy fries lol. The rigatoni was okay, but the meat sauce portion was pretty skimpy. The dish looked like it was only worth $10 but of course it was more than twice that. Not sure what was so special about it. Also tried the spaghetti and meatballs which was average as well.

Service was not that great as well. Our waitress didn't really check up on my table and I literally had to tag someone else for water refills and to ask for more ketchup. Getting the bill also took a while and luckily we were not in a rush.

Overall I would not come back to this establishment. It's one of those tourist traps that y'all should avoid. The meals you get here can be easily gotten for cheaper at another place like Bucca di Beppo. The portion sizes are also pretty small for the price you pay.

It locates in the middle of casino, surrounded by some other restaurants. The potato chips that we ordered as appetizer is quite tasty and I am quite satisfied with my lamb skewers, tender and juicy. The food quality and quantity are both decent.

One thing disappointed me is we got charged by the sparkling water. It may sound confusing but I guarantee the waiter and waitress didn't mention one word about how they charge it for the entire time. So, here is the story: when they asked us what we wanna drink, we said just water, and they ask regular or sparkle, and my friend said sparkle. At that time we all thought sparkling water is for free because it's listed in the water option. We didn't realized  that they charge extra $18 for two bottles of water until we checked the bill later on! I don't think that's a legit way to make more sales! They should have asked us whether we need another bottle plus it's not free but they didn't! So be careful folks! Just ask them ""Hey, I heard you charge for water...hmmm not sure if we need to pay extra $5 for ice?""",Yo-G2hnzystUsJZv88mweg,4,0,3,iMva08Y9trAgW5KqeqBv0Q

The restaurant itself has a great upbeat modern decor, but being in the MGM with no walls or deliniation to speak of, there can be a bit of noise & commotion from the gaming floor from time to time.  

After getting of the plane, losing a piece of luggage, etc -- it was great to sit down with a bottle of wine & the Maytag Blue cheese Truffle Oil Potato Chips to relax.  They are such comfort food!

We also shared a mushroom & leek pizza, with a great olive oil crust, with just enough garlic too.  It's a thin crust, that does have some give and toothiness to make it yummy.

WP's did have a winter tasting menu (their prix fixe option) -- and there were several nice choices, we just didn't want that much food.  But, for dinner, it may be a nice option for you.

Wait staff was fine -- waiter was pleasant to talk with, yet not too chatty.  Wine selection was nice -- went with an Irony Pinot Noir on the lower price end -- but it was fine after our day.

Total bill was $66 pre-tip.  If you're staying at the MGM, its a great place for a delicious meal.  Note -- they are also having a late menu - 11 pm to 5 am - so, gives you a much better option than MGM's Studio Cafe.",jHHRH62tCYNZnh85uMzkJg,0,0,4,-ZEs7MHPh8Rk_ukMDdGsnQ

They did not have a gluten free menu but the waiter was able to tell me what items were safe.

I settled on the flank steak and mashed potatoes. I gotta say the flank steak was delicious. Cooked to a medium perfection that I love and flavored extremely well, I remember enjoying every bite of this dish. I cleaned my plate for sure.

Either way, I am proud to say that my recent meal at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill was an all-around, excellent experience. Yes, the prices were up there, but the food and service actually made it worth it.

I have to agree with Denice Z. that this is an amazing people-watching spot. There's really no need to even have a conversation with your dinner date with all the hilarious people walking around. Why talk when you can stare? Unfortunately, you will eventually be encouraged to look away when your food arrives. My husband and I started off with some drinks (the pineapple ginger mojito was delicious) and the caprese salad. The caprese could have used more mozzarella, but the tomatoes were so flavorful and divine that I barely noticed. I love that they tossed some onions and greens into the dish. So good! They also bring a basket of focaccia/Italian bread to the table which is soft and fresh. For our main dishes, we went with the three cheese ravioli and spaghettini. Both were delicious and very filling. I could barely make a dent in my spaghettini after the bread and caprese, but I did my best. I love the chunks of tomatoes and sliced basil that they mixed into the sauce. Seriously tasty!

I will tell you that all that food totaled over $80 and that didn't include tip. So it was definitely not cheap. But if you're looking for a nice meal out in Vegas that's not overly stuffy or formal, I would definitely recommend it. It's right in the heart of the MGM and I guarantee there will be plenty to see and eat! Enjoy yourselves!",1BjI1-O1gxSt8TRO0yD8Gg,0,0,5,7c5OrFNTXwepRpiAeoRa5w

I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.

The portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18. 

The Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes.

Originally I was going to order the mushroom, leek, taleggio, thyme, and asparagus pizza but something amazing caught my eye.  The sweet pea and goat cheese filled tortellini with wild mushrooms, Parmesan, and TRUFFLE shavings.

The ones that seem like a refuge of comfort when you're hungry, but you know in your heart they're just not all that great? Sometimes they're really pleasant appearing, but undoubtedly you still become aware of the fact that you're in an airport. 

That's how I feel about Wolfgang Puck. It would not have been my choice for a last dinner in Vegas, but after a great, albeit long, concert at the MGM garden arena, I was going to take the nearest restaurant available out of sheer exhaustion. 

The menu covers the basics of what you'd expect a bar and grill type to serve; pizzas, pastas, burgers, salads, etc. Extensive alcohol nonetheless, but where in Vegas is that not automatically assumed?

I had a really hard time deciding what to rate this restaurant. The food was pretty good, I'll be the first to admit. I had spaghetti and meatballs, and those balls were fire. Very light, but exceptional flavorful. 

But this just doesn't cut it for Vegas. When I'm here I want something that's gonna make my eyes pop out of my skull. Something over the top, that elicits those uncontrollable sounds one makes in the throws of (food) passion. Not something that's pretty good, with a large price tag slapped on due to name and location. I've been to taco trucks on the side of the road with more excitement. 

I don't know, I guess this is partially my fault. I should have known better, should have maybe looked harder. I guess the whole establishment just struck me as boring. There's nothing inherently wrong with it by any means, I just think for the price point, you have a plethora of better options at your finger tips.

We spotted Wolfgang Puck and knew he was a prestigious chef, but we were almost swayed away by the fancy looking decor, because we thought everything would be overpriced.

We checked out the menu outside and saw that everything was pretty reasonable ($15-$30 for most dishes). It was so hard to decide on what to order because everything sounded so good!

I had a bite of everyone's food and I loved every single dish on the table! I'd have to say my favorite of everything I tasted was the BLT, because the bacon wasn't your ordinary bacon; They were thick slices of pork belly ""glazed to perfection,"" as my friend kept saying!

I ordered the Ham and Turkey Club, which I know sounds boring haha, but it was so good! They PILED the meat and there was a third slice of bread in the middle, probably to keep all that ham and turkey from sliding around. The bread was crispy, and the portion was huge! They cut up my sandwich into four sections, and I only ate two and took the rest back to our hotel.

My friend's pizza was also delicious! I believe it was the Prosciutto and Goat Cheese Pizza: Prosciutto, Kalamata Olives, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Basil Pesto, Goat Cheese.

I highly recommend going to Wolfgang Puck! The prices aren't outrageous, considering you are in Vegas, and the food is superb.",dceUPs8J893qgE6GsBKXiw,2,2,5,0mfiOHnxaunLLBa1VXrs2A

It's a beautiful restaurant that opens out to the casino.

Chinois Chicken Salad - had this many times before.  It's a good medley of greens topped with crispy wonton strips and candied peanuts.  I wish the dressing was a bit more flavorful, but overall it's a good salad with lots of moist chicken!

BLT - husband had to order this because the menu described it as pork belly.

It looked scrumptuous as the thick bacon, arugula, and tomatoes were between two grilled pieces of sourdough.  IMO, the sandwich was decent but could have tasted WAY better if there was some sort of maple glaze and smokiness to the bacon.  It tasted rather bland...  The side pasta salad was delicious tho!  It was tossed with salume, feta chesses, and some veggies.

Oh, and the appetizer calamari was pretty good.  It arrived looking a little undercooked but it did have a rather nice crunch to it.  The aoili dipping sauce was a wonderful accomaniment to the calamari!

Prices are decent and I think it's a good spot for lunch, especially if you're here for a convention.....

I ended up getting the Heirloom Tomato Caprese from the appetizer menu for $17. It was good, but I don't think it was really worth $17 and I was hungry a few hours later.

I ordered the gnocchi and was told that I'd probably want to order something else with it because it's not enough food (despite being $30).  Another person at my table was told that their burger would take approximately 35-40 minutes if they wanted it cooked medium (which seemed a bit outrageous.). The food we received that night again was very good.  I elected to go with a salad and the gnocchi (which was tiny, so a big shout out goes to the waiter for being honest).

Otherwise, waters and the complementary bread (which was very fresh & tasty) were refilled frequently without having to ask. 

Now as for the entrees, I can understand a bit longer prep time due to having a large group, but I felt the wait was a little ridiculous. We had to wait almost an hour (45~50) minutes for the first few entrees to arrive, and the rest came periodically after. The food itself was good, but I wouldn't say spectacular. They had standard American fare such as burgers, sandwiches, pork chops, and steak options. I went with the steak & fries, and I thought my medium steak came out a little too cooked (the edges tasted burnt and the meat was very stiff in certain areas).

We stumbled here the first day for lunch because were gambling and needed a break from all the losses. After finding out we could use our M life rewards here, we came back again the next day!  This originally wasn't on my list of places to eat, but being near the casino floor we decided to stop in for what we thought would be a mediocre but quick lunch. The waiter came by and gave us the normal spiel of what were the specials for the day, which I honestly never pay attention to. However, my boyfriend does, and he noticed that their special, NOT ON THEIR MENU, was a salmon burger with corn based slaw onions etc. 

FOOD we ordered from both visits:
SALMON BURGER - omg. AMAZING. this is OFF THE MENU so if you're coming here and you love salmon as much as i do and love corn as much as i do, make sure you ask for this. I've had salmon burgers elsewhere that i thought were great, but this is amazing!! I'm so glad that our waiter came by and mentioned that it was off the menu. If i weren't coming back to try the other recommended items from yelpers the second day, i would've ordered it again. 

TRUFFLED POTATO CHIPS with MAYTAG BLUE CHEESE - ordered this per yelper's recommendations. SO YUMS!!! the potato chips were not thin but not super thick, made just the right width with the right crunchiness. I love truffle oil and I love it when its used right. You could definitely taste the truffle oil on the chips. It's not overpowering. I'm also generally not a big fan of blue cheese on anything else but my salads, but there wasn't enough. Plus you can always brush it off when you're eating the potato chip, it doesn't leave a residue taste on the chip either.

CRAB CAKES - ordered this per yelpers recommendations as well. they come out in 4 or 5 what looks like tiny crab cakes, but they are made exquisitely and I have to say even being located in desert nevada, these crab cakes were fresh and delicious! I hate it when people put in so many crumbs it takes away from the crab stuffing or the crab flavour. That wasn't the case at all. It wasn't an overpowering crab taste either. I highly recommend ordering these! 

REUBEN SANDWICH - My boyfriend ordered this. I'm not a huge fan of Reuben's but he said it was ok. He asked for no cheese on his reuben, but it came out with cheese anyway. The one good thing about this was he asked for a substitute of a salad for his french fries, and the salad that came out was fresh and delicious!

SPICY TUNA TARTARE - this was a good order. I tried a few other tuna tartare's that week in vegas and this was definitely the best one that I tried. I liked the wonton's that came with it too. the chip was thick and crunchy. 

BBQ PORK SPARE RIBS - Ordered this bc we had M life points to spend (WUT WUT in the MGM). They were made well, but being from the south I've definitely tasted better ribs. but since these were comped ribs, I have no complaints. hahaha.

SPICY SOPRESSATA PIZZA - my boyfriend ordered this as well. I'm not a fan of spicy things on my pizza but he was A BIG FAN OF THIS PIZZA. He highly highly recommends it. 

Didn't have room during either visit for dessert but nothing on the menu super caught my eye. 

ATMOSPHERE/DECOR: i loved the decor! it was spacious and light, with enough ambiance to create a non-casino feel. It had an open view of the casino games around us, but also enough baracades (these round wooden bigger than life wreath type things) to close you in on your eating and dining experience. It does get a lil loud but not loud enough for you to yell to your eating mates. 

SERVICE - service was great. The waiters were always attentive but not hovering, and they always made sure that we had water in our cups (which we needed since we came in the middle of scorching hot 120 degree July). I also liked that they sent things out as they were ready, not ""when they're supposed to come out."" Really liked that about the place. 

I love this place. It's incredibly REASONABLY PRICED, even if you don't use your comp points here. I loved the casualness yet classy feel of the place. Definitely HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're in the area, or if you just wanna stop by for a quick lunch. Its a good break from all the smoking as well.

Service was also great and fast, which we appreciated.",3HKZ3ErtjZDYKq0B1mOfzg,1,0,5,vHL0BPate9OqiIPDBcP87g

The problem was server Aubree. Sure she mentioned the days specials (well rehearsed I might add) but she got the pizza wrong & did not put in the calamari. Salad came fast because it was ordered right off the bat...pizza was refired and calamari came later on. You can tell she forgot it because it was listed last on the tab. Would have been nice to enjoy them together. She also offered parmigiana & red pepper flakes when the pizza was already half gone. I had had to ask for another bar drink rather than her offering. I recommend she repeat orders back to the guest so she can be sure what was ordered..too many mistakes for a place of that caliber...she was still tipped well though..",vv3Q4_zbgp89xo1O_C9OVA,3,1,3,UF5nMPq6cuAPqpqXRr8Ipg

Partially my fault for ordering well done. My first came out medium to medium well. Hate sending meat back. Then I guess to show me they sent out a charred burger. Why is it so hard to make a well done burger that's not burnt? Probably just better off not eating meat because I certainly don't trust the safety of our slaughter facilities to eat medium cooked hamburger.

Plus my boyfriend is wearing sandals and I'll be damned if I'm going to hike all the way back to the Riviera (!) to change. Ugh... Oh? What's this? A bar and grill in the middle of the casino? Hmmm... Oh, it's Wolfgang Puck? Ok, hell, why not. I'm a sucker for celebrity chefs. 

We walk in at about 10:10 pm and are seated promptly, our waiter almost immediately coming by to ask for drink orders. All I had was water and the bf had a beer. Menu was interesting... like a bar and grill menu done right. Good old chicken wings and pizzas, as well as things like tuna tartare and crab cakes. I ended up getting the steak skewers and a Caesar salad. The bf got the burger.

Let's see here.... (thinking back through a hazy fog of blurred-together Vegas memories)... The bread basket they brought: okay but cold. The boyfriend liked the olive foccacia, I would have liked it if it weren't the temperature of an ice cube. The Caesar: meh. The low point of the meal. I liked how the romaine leaves were left whole for me to cut up, but I didn't care for the dressing. Little too lemony. My own homemade Caesar dressing is better. Plus I kinda like croutons, The bruschetta was pretty good, but the croustini could have been a little less thin and wafer-y. (Yes, I know, I'm being ultra-picky.) The steak skewers: Yum. Cooked perfectly. Nice presentation. Tasty house-made steak sauce. Someone else said the slaw it came with was underdressed, and they were completely right. Actually It wasn't really dressed at all. But I could excuse that, cuz the steaks were so yummy. Here's the pathetic part: I was feeling so shitty that I couldn't even finish the entire tiny little appetizer. There's five skewers, with about three or four bites of steak on each. I ended up taking two back to my room. Yeah. Beyond sad. But man they tasted good cold at three in the morning... 

The bf's burger: Can't really offer any useful commentary as I was not even remotely interested in taking a bite... under normal circumstances i would have been all over it. His fries were awesome though. I wish all bars had fries like this... and menus like this... 

We had to box up our food and scramble the eff outta there cuz for some fool reason we wanted to rush up the strip to see the last free pirate show thingy at TI.... which they cancelled anyway when we got there at the last second. C'est la Vegas, I guess. But yes, Wolfgang Puck is pretty good grubbin' for the money, and a great option if you don't happen to be clad in business casual at the moment and/or don't feel like spending $100+ on dinner.",oikpDYJBuJn3dowmLayjmA,1,0,4,G7_sux1nyahiKcvT_0ksgg

Got there 15 minutes early and was seated immediately, even though the place was packed. Service was great, they must have been refilling our water every 5 minutes. We're big water drinkers, lol. Staff were friendly, and everything came out in a timely manner. Started with the Maytag truffled potato chips. Absolutely amazing! In my top ten of best things I've eaten. Main course I had the flat iron steak. Cooked correctly, but wasn't overly impressed with the flavor. Seemed like a standard steak you could get at any restaurant. The fries were regular old fries. The green beans were great though! For the price I thought the steak and fries should've been better. Still not bad though. My wife had the shrimp scampi fettuccini. Shrimp were huge and delicious! Noodles weren't so great. Fettuccini is my wife's go-to meal, and she didn't finish half of the noodles. Again, didn't taste bad, we just were hoping for more. Also had the Mac and cheese that was okay. So I probably wouldn't go there again, but I might see if they'll do the Maytag potato chips on a to go order.

The service was good both times. I was provided with plenty of water, and my drink level was maintained.

I appreciated the good selection of food on the menu. I heard a message on the resort sound system that said the restaurant had a special late night menu, but the one I got seemed pretty complete to me.

The pasta dish (the tortillini) was tasty. I think it was the most standout food I've had in Vegas, and I've tried several places. I ordered the dish late at night, about 1 AM. It came within 15 minutes. The margaritas and the Old Fashioneds were consistent, poured ""heavy handed"", and did the job. I got the Old Fashioneds made with their house blend of bourbon, and it was good.

Overall, I feel that Wolfgang Puck really delivered. I didn't walk in here expecting food or drinks that exceeded that which I am used to in my hometown, consistent with what I have had in Vegas. But they offered consistent service levels, and I really enjoyed my food. I would recommend this place, especially for people looking for a late night munch while gambling or otherwise enjoying the MGM resort. Responsive, friendly service, and a good bite to eat.

The restaurant is wheelchair accessible. How do we know? We saw a man in the motorized scooter drive up into the restaurant, park, get off, and walk to his table. 

Other than that, the table where we were seated was in full view of the flat screen TV which was showing the nude version of ""The Bride of Frankenstein"". It was a pretty old movie and the station that aired it had no problem blurring out the boobs etc. 

Oh, back to my food. The chicken soup was superb. Chock full of chicken, carrots, celery, and potato, the broth was so clear and fresh tasting.  I could have and should have made a lunch out of the soup and roll. The wild mushroom ravioli in parm cream sauce was delicious. And filling. And mushroomy.

Apps:
You HAVE to have the chicken soup - so fresh and tasty. I always start a meal with a bowl of the soup
Chinese chicken salad is good too - large portion

Lunch:
The lamb sandwich is amazing, don't pass it up
Pizzas are also good and pretty large
Burger is good

Dinner:
The last 2 visits I had the Kobe beef special. It's a great deal, about $47 and steak is very tender. It also comes with (literally) a pound of potatoes and cauliflower on the side. Very large portion and vegetables are perfectly cooked. Probably the best Kobe beef deal in town.
I had the salmon once and it is good
The flat iron steak is pretty good
The thin breaded chicken breast is nothing special, I would pass
Spaghettini with tomato sauce is a great light dish, very fresh and flavorful and vegetarian.

Dessert:
I believe I had the cobbler or fruit pie and it is very good and big enough for 2. They have good loose leaf tea selection. For lunch the fresh cookies are good too.

3913242,2016-12-20,2,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Came here twice during our Vegas trip -- once for dinner, and once at 4:00 am before our flight home. Both times I was so impressed with how good all the food was! They cook up some really unique flavors here with very quality ingredients. Servers are also very friendly, and they really go above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable. 

My thoughts on the food:

Truffled Potato Chips w/ Maytag Blue Cheese Sauce: Ordered this appetizer since its the top highlight on Yelp, and was blown away by how delicious this was. The potato chips were thick cut, fresh, and pipping hot -- it paired perfectly with the creamy, tangy blue cheese sauce. I don't even like blue cheese but I'm in love with this dish! (5/5)  

Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers: Very tender cuts of steak, thoroughly seasoned and covered w/ their house steak sauce. The dish comes with 5 decently sized skewers, but is a bit on the expensive side at $18. (4/5) 

Garlic-Chili Glazed Chicken Wings: This dish definitely satisfied my chicken wing cravings! If you've ever tried Vietnamese chicken wings, these have a very familiar taste with the strong hints of garlic and chili. Each wing/leg was generously glazed and very flavorful! (5/5) 

Prosciutto Pizza: Also ordered this dish as it was one of the top highlights on Yelp! My friends really enjoyed this pizza, but I thought the goat cheese was a bit too strong (albeit, I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese). Regardless, I still really liked this pizza because the prosciutto gave it a really rich, buttery flavor. (4/5)  

Italian Sausage Pizza: LOVED this pizza! The contrast in flavors from the creamy ricotta, the sweet roasted peppers, and the juicy Italian sausage was perfection!! I might be a bit biased though because I pretty much devour anything with ricotta lol, but also the crust on both pizzas were cooked perfectly -- very thin and crispy.  (5/5)   

Also wanted to mention that the complimentary french bread we got at dinner was amazingly good since it was freshly baked, hot out of the oven stuff! They also threw in some garlic/onion & rosemary infused bread sticks that were super buttery and moist. The french bread at 4 am was just so-so, but that's to be expected haha",qpJvFXThQKW3bxicP9KSXw,3,3,5,iSVxwWNsprY1y5uiCZChlQ

On our last night in Vegas, we couldn't figure out where to eat and when we walked by here we knew we had to eat here. My sister checked out the menu outside before confirming my pick. 

We were seated inside which was good because I had zero desire to sit outside because it was too noisy.

Our server was nice. I didn't catch his name, but it was the Asian guy who was a little short. He was suggesting what we should order so we went with his recommendations.

I got the Caesar salad because that's my favorite.My sister got the Baby Iceberg salad and my other sister got the Prosciutto pizza. We also shared a pasta plate, but I can't remember the name of the dish. Before that, we started off with the calamari for appetizer. It was delicious.

We still had a bit of room for dessert so we ordered a couple things. First was the Warm Vanilla Beignets which comes with an order of 6. We also got the Chocolate Souffle because we figured why the hell not.I LOVE LOVE LOVE the beignet. I almost died. It has my favorite thing inside..........NUTELLA. They won my heart with that one. The souffle was good, but the shock of the nutella wouldn't escape me.

It was such a great meal. We went up to our room right after to nurse our food baby.

We got complimentary rasin bread to start off with butter. After looking at the menu we decided to start off with the crab cakes which was delicious! I wish they were bigger, but they were perfect bite size, but 4 pieces for $18 was a little much.

Afterwards, I got the spicy clam with linguine. They were VERY generous with the clams and there was bite sizes of bacon mmm very good.

The bf got the meat loaf which was cooked just right. There was onion rings on top and the mash potato stacked on the bottom of the meatloaf. I loved the mash potato because it was really rich and savvory. 

We enjoyed both dishes and our waitress gave us a complimentary cream brulee. She was very sweet and took our picture and told me that it was facebook worthy haha.

All in all, I had a wonderful experience at Wolfgang Puck. 1 appitizer. 2 main entree. free dessert. This was my first time at this location.

We shared the chinoise chinese chicken salad to start while she had the caeser.  Our salad was really tasty. Roasted peanuts and shredded chicken all chopped into fork size combinable bites.  It needed salt, but otherwise, quite good.  The caeser is legit.  It comes with anchovies thick , rich, creamy dressing, and parmesan.  The bread basket is very nice too, three choices, foccacia, french and a raisin served with softened whipped butter.  Thank you WP, I absolutely hat e it when my butter is cold and rips my bread.

Next we shared thje pork belly BLT and the sweet corn ravioli.  The BLT was good but didn't knock my socks off.  The portion was large; the sandwick was served with a big bowl of flavorful pasta slad.  The pork belly was delicious, of course.  I was dissapointed in the caliber of tomato on the sandwich.  It was a cheap snotty slice expected form a fast food burger.  The ravioli was pure bliss.  Sweet corn puree delicately placed in between fresh pasta, and topped with shaved truffles, shaved parmesan and bitty buttery mushrooms.  Whoa! So good.  MIL had a salmon burger on special and it quickly dissapeared, must have been good.

We finished with a latte and the choclate beigneits with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  They were essentialy molten doughnut holes with an enjoyable bittersweet flavor.  My latte was perfection.

Pork chop entree: My sister got the pork chop entree and it was served so beautifully! The meat was good, a bit too dry for my tasting but regardless it was still really good. Especially with the sauce they had on the side!

Flat iron steak: I had a rare flat iron steak and it was cooked perfectly rare, the way I liked it! They had just enough seasoning on it and the dipping sauce that was served with it complimented the steak very well.

Fried calamari: One of the best that I've tasted! Dipping sauce made it even better! It's lightly battered and not too crunchy. Yummy!

Braised short ribs: My dad had the braised short ribs which was super tender! Definitely would recommend this dish to friends.

Mediterranean Sea bass: it was the special for the day! My mom isn't much of a meat eater so she opted for fish. The fish was really good and I am a fan! Especially for those who aren't feeling like steak or pork, sea bass is the way to go!

So I got a medium well burger, still wrong no matter who's it was supposed to be and my dad got mine. I cut it open see it's over cooked and shrug it off as I'm hungry but still a little disappointed. My dad sends his back. I eat while he's is being cooked and my dad gets his when I'm done. He really hates that. It always ruins his meal having to wait and eat after everybody else is done. The burger for being over cooked for my taste was still very good.

The dish was served with a tasty Basil Pesto Aioli. I loved the flavors of the Pumpkin Tortellini, which was made with brown butter and sage--everything blended so well together. The tortellini was fresh, although the folds of dough were a bit too thick for me. The salmon was nicely cooked, and the mushroom ragout and pork belly were nice additions to the dish. Our friend had the Roasted Turkey Sandwich (the cheapest, but the most filling) which he said was really good.

Service was good. It wasn't crowded when we went, so the food came out quickly. The waiter was friendly and checked on us pretty often.

The tastiest part of the meal, however, (besides the salmon) was the creamed white corn that the salmon rested upon.  I've never liked creamed corn (from the can) but this was VERY good.

4102007,2013-08-12,2,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I came here Sunday August 4th for dinner.  I had the lasagna, 2 friends had the pizza and 2 others in my group did not eat.  It was an average meal.  Fast forward to 10 hours later, early Monday morning, I woke up to a churning stomach, went to the restroom where I proceeded to spew out red tomato sauce from BOTH ends.  It was a terrible morning.  Both of my friends who had pizza woke up and had considerable GI discomfort all morning.  They weren't as bad as me, but they were not enjoying life.  Essentially, our Monday drive home was miserable.  The two who did not eat were fine.  

I called the restaurant Wednesday evening, after I felt better to let them know I had possibly gotten food poisoning from their restaurant.  The manager immediately doubted me -- blaming the sickness on too much drinking (absurd).   I had maybe 5 beers the entirety of Sunday.  So unless a server shoved a bottle up where the sun doesn't shine before serving me, I have a hard time blaming it on the beer.  Not to mention, I'm in my 30's...I went to college...I am fairly familiar with alcohol sickness and hangovers.  This was not that.

I explained to the manager that there were 5 of us and we all ate at the same places all weekend, except for Sunday night, when only 3 of us ate...the same 3 that got sick.      The manager proceeded to proclaim that you get food poisoning 72 hours after ingestion.  I had to look that up...it's not true.  Why he would lie?  I have no idea.  He just really didn't seem to even being open to the notion that his restaurant got me sick.

Regardless, I didn't call asking for anything...I only called to inform them of the events and how my friends and I narrowed it down to their establishment.  The manager asked for my contact info and told me their general manager would get back to me in 24 hours.  It has been 5 days.

Also, celebrity chef restaurants were brought up, and because Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill was right by KA, it won!

We were seated in a fairly short amount of time [it was a bit after 9pm on Sunday, but still busy]. The decor was interesting [plaid ceilings and floral glass ""walls""]. The restaurant is on a platform overlooking the waiting area for KA and was right near the MGM casino. My friend noticed after dinner that there were a ton of servers, but only one female server which was quite the opposite of... everywhere! 

The waiter seemed very jazzed about dinner and explaining everything, and we were worried when he didn't write anything down, but he was awesome! Braden was nice, funny, got everything right, and he was great about checking in with us. Our water glasses were always full, and our food was amazing! There were multiple people who did the water, drinks, and food serving [they did bring out the food to the wrong people, but they got the orders right so what does it matter?].

My mouth was watering just reading the menu, but I wasn't feeling great so I thought I'd pick smaller options--hah! I got Mac'n Cheese and Roasted Cauliflower. The Mac'n Cheese wasn't anything amazing, but it tasted pretty good with the cauliflower in it. Two people at the table got the lasagna, which tasted like regular lasagna, but it did have a nice presentation. My sister got the gourmet burger. It was $25 and SO worth it! She asked for medium, and it was pretty pink and soooo flavorful! It came with thinly sliced and fanned avocado, all the fixings, and incredibly tasty fries. I believe my boyfriend got the Italian sausage pizza with goat cheese, and that was also super tasty and a decent size. 

The only complaint we really had was that the ginger lime iced tea did not taste at all gingery. We agreed that this place was pretty great, and if we're ever in Vegas again we'll have to try one of Puck's other restaurants!

I ordered the Maytag Bleu cheese chips for an appetizer and fully plan to go back for another one of these before I go home - so yummy.  They were simple - homemade potato chips with bleu cheese sauce topping them, but they were the favorite appetizer among the group I was with.  For dinner, I had the special - an 8oz filet, crusted with blue crab and served with some kind of spiced bearnaise sauce (I forget what the spice was).  On the side, I opted for the crispy Tuscan potatoes.   Everything was really delicious.  The steak was cooked just a little rare for my taste (I ordered medium), but I have come to expect this with filet as it's so thick.  The bearnaise, oh the bearnaise.  I could have ordered a bowl full of it.  The crab crust on top was also very tasty.  The bearnaise and crab elevated the steak, and the combination was perfect.  I highly recommend the Tuscan potatoes.  They are simple - red skinned potatoes, sliced and tossed with olive oil, salt and some herbs, then flash fried.  They were great.  I was almost talked into the fries, as they are supposed to be excellent. I had the opportunity to try some from one of my tablemates, and they were good, but fries are fries.  So glad I went with the potatoes instead.  

Now, the ambiance...  It is nicely decorated and our server was very good.  He gave us excellent advice and recommendations.  It is very LOUD, however.  The restaurant has a patio effect, and is open to the casino, passerby, etc.  They have music playing on top of all of that exterior noise, and in order for it to be heard, the music has to be quite loud.  When our server was on the other side of the table explaining the specials, I couldn't hear a word he said.  I was with a group of seven, and I had no hope of hearing those at the other end of the table.  By the time we left, my voice was scratchy as if I had been to a concert.

In summary - food was absolutely fantastic.  I'm going back for lunch just to eat it again.  But don't go if you're looking for a quiet, peaceful or romantic dinner.",wqbvzgUjdiYKQ3LRxE5WSg,0,0,4,5IqW0I7nyZ6uPMaT6CWsqA

I got their linguini with shrimp, which was good, but for the restaurant I was in and the price I was paying, I would have wanted something that blew me away. This dish did not. My friend got their fish with a side of pasta, and her fish was a little on the dry side. We had to ask for bread a couple of times--it wasn't automatically brought to our table. The ambience of the restaurant was ok--a little too floral for my taste but you could tell it was an upscale place.

I did like our waiter--he was friendly and helped to customize my friend's order so that she got the pasta on the side instead of the veggies, and he didn't charge her extra.

Had the pork sandwich and chips and a beer and my friend had the caesar salad.

Food alone may have been 4 stars, but the service and the price brings the grade way down.  The chips with the sandwich are really bland, I left most of them.  Kind of disappointing when you're paying $15 for a sandwich lol.

I picked this place because of the high rating on Yelp and it seemed like a low key place to eat right before catching Zumanity across the street at NYNY. 

For some reason after taking a quick glance at the menu, the gf and I weren't feeling the food. Maybe because it was ""bar"" food and we've been eating Earl of Sandwich everyday since we got into town. It took a while to decide, but we decided to split the butter lettuce caesar salad and the entree of organic chicken. We also ordered the honey lime aid; perfect for those into sour drinks.

FOOD:
---------
We started with the **Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers**, which was much larger than one would expect for an appetizer. 5 divine skewers! The meat was so tender it melted in my mouth, and the savory flavors burst forth. What a pleasant surprise! 

I'm a total carnivore, but the **Vegetable Pizza** really hit the spot. You can't go wrong with oven roasted tomatoes, basil pesto, mozzarella, and Nicoise olives. Sometimes pesto is a nice change.

And finally, there's no way we could resist the **Three Cheese ""Mac 'n Cheese"" **. I thought the price was a little high at $12, but when that sucker showed itself I understood everything. Even the meaning of life. We were again pleasantly surprised by a fairly-sized portion that helped induce food comas all around.

Although prices are higher than the super casual cafe around the corner, the quality of food at this hour is really quite impressive.

SERVICE/AMBIANCE:
---------------------------
Crowd is mixed; you'll see people of all ages here. Most are stopping by after a long night in either casual or fancy attire, depending where they came from or where they're headed. So you'll see business suits, skimpy club attire, grungy gym clothes, and even hipsters. You should never be surprised in Vegas.

My only issue is with the service. The hosts were polite, but our server took forever to take our order. We must have waited 15-20 minutes in our seats before ordering, and this is after we had already waited 30 minutes outside. He provided great recommendations and our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but he NEVER came back to check on us. When we wanted to pay our bill he was socializing with one of the other servers, so I had to go ask him for it. I'm sure the other staff there are not as negligent as he is. At least I hope not!

TIP: Overall this place is great for late night and I definitely recommend it when you're staying at the MGM Grand.

It's a great before/after show restaurant. We had a reservation and were seated right away after checking in with the hostess. The restaurant is open, so you can see the bar, kitchen, and casino floor.

I ordered the special that night, which was pappardelle pasta, a chunky tomato sauce, shredded lamb, kale, truffle-infused breadcrumbs, and freshly shredded parmesan. I was torn between several items on the menu, but I wanted a special since I was in Vegas for the weekend. It was phenomenal! I rarely eat lamb, and this was delicious. It was incredibly tender and tasted delicious. The sauce was very thick, almost like tomato chunks, but I didn't even feel like I was eating a tomato sauce. The balance of sauce, meat and kale was absolutely perfect.

I also had their moscow mule. Cocktails were expensive, so I decided to go for one that was all alcohol. Others in our group had several cocktails that were all extremely tasty. Additionally, I tried a few bites of what my friends had. I had a bite of the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball melts in your mouth, and the sauce was phenomenal. The linguini and clams came in the most decadent white wine sauce with perfectly prepared clams. The french onion soup was rich, buttery, and tasted phenomenal. 

They brought us a chocolate cheesecake as the complimentary birthday dessert and wrote ""Happy Birthday"" in raspberry sauce. The cheesecake had chocolate drizzled on top and edible pearls garnishing the plate. The waiter said it was always a surprise as to what the chef prepared for the complimentary birthday dessert.

Yes, this restaurant is pricey (although not by Vegas standards). However, you will have an excellent meal and receive spectacular service. The waiter took excellent care of us.

We were a party of five, not a large party but it was not the norm. We had several needs that required special attention and accommodation. One of our guests was using a wheelchair for an injury so we required a larger area for him to maneuver around during the meal and we brought with us two bottles of our own champagne to toast the Anniversary couple. We had inquired earlier in the day about a possible corking fee for the champagne and our hotel made the reservation for us via the hotel Concierge. We made our way from our hotel to the restaurant, and from the minute we entered we treated like celebrities. Our waiter was named Robert and I can say, without a doubt, that this young man made the entire evening unforgettable. He shared with us a little about his family and his personality was so comforting and welcoming. The staff that worked alongside of Robert paid attention to every single detail. Robert made certain that our orders were correct. His staff working alongside of him made sure that water glasses were NEVER empty. Our champagne glasses will always FULL and our food was spectacular. Our bread baskets were always full too.  He did not miss a beat in his service. He knew the balance of helping his guests and also giving us time to enjoy our meal with our friends as we celebrated. He treated the Anniversary couple like royalty. He made sure they were noticed and recognized. He made certain the entire experience was completely enjoyable. Our appetizers were tasty and just as described on the menu. Our entrees were served hot and to point. No long wait either. As soon as our dinner was complete, Robert came out with two special desserts for the anniversary couple giving them the spotlight. and makingit a night to remember. I can't express strongly enough how spectacular his service was. Robert was sincere, attentive and his personality was so memorable that we , as an entire group, will never forget him. We came visiting from Los Angeles with no expectations at all but he exceeded every goal of great service. Not only that but Robert also took it upon himself to discount a portion of our meals in celebration of the Anniversary couple's special day, as well as comping us the corkage fee. Who does that? If you want a great meal -- and the food was SPECTACULAR so thank you to the chef -- and exemplary service and an all around enjoyable dining experience then make your way to this location.

Also before we went downstairs we checked out the menu online and decided we were interested in ordering the pappardelle pasta with short rib and the roasted cauliflower side but was told the menu was old so of course the two items that we really wanted weren't available! Kind of a bummer a big hotel like MGM can't update the menus on their site. Not a huge deal but something to note if you're the type of person who likes to check out the menu online beforehand.

We started with the sweet chili wings that were really excellent, very crispy and the highlight of our whole meal.  We also had a half order of the maytag blue cheese chips which were tasty but not sure what the hype was about. The chips came out to us covered in so much sauce more than half the chips were soggy so we didn't even finish our half order.

I had the corn tortellini which seemed like a seasonal dish they added onto the pasta section and although the flavor was very good it was way too salty. The fiancé had the spaghetti which was a huge portion enough for two to share. The meatballs were really great and very soft.

Since we are staying at MGM for a staycation we needed a restaurant that was kid friendly and overall this place is a good pick to keep it casual yet still have a decent meal.

The waiter completely ignored us and I'd say all around the food just sucked for a better lack of words. Emril's Fish House was fantastic. Down the strip we ate at Guy Fieri's place and that was beyond excellent. Wolfgang's was one of the worst experiences that we've ever had. You could burn the heck out of my steak and I wouldn't return it, so it takes a lot for me to complain. Seriously. I would rather eat chips and a soda in my hotel room before going back to this eatery. This resturant served us low quality food, forgot our wine completely and still put it on the bill.

I can't believe that the Los Angeles Airport WP Express has better food quality than this traditional restaurant.  The overall food presentation was pathetic, the tastes were odd, and this was certainly not worth the trek or new $7 parking at the MGM.

As a fan of Wolfgang, I was excited to try this restaurant.  HOWEVER, the food items that we ordered were sub-par and a massive disappointment.  Here's the cliff-note version:
1.  truffled potato chips, Maytag bleu cheese sauce - maybe crispy fries would be better than soggy chips; cheese sauce ROCKED but how can you go wrong with cheese?
2.  grilled Jidori chicken skewers - too many different flavors that was distracting:  yuzu and aioli mixture was confusing and stymied the succulent chicken.  BUMMER!
3.  Italian sausage, creme fraiche, etal. - salty and lacked flavor other than too much salt
4.  house made ricotta gnocchi, etal. - swimming in tomato sauce, mushy gnocchi, no ""wow;"" another pass!
5.  wild mushroom ravioli - OVERWHELMINGLY SALTY; we sent this back because there was no hope.  

When our party of 4 left after our brief visit, and the general comment was ""eh,"" then it is safe to say that the entire experience was terrible.

The saving grace was the service; our server Zak and busser (didn't catch his name) were both on-the-ball!  They were both attentive and professional while Zak was apologetic for our crappy food.  In fact, I felt bad in that he didn't make the food, he simply took our order and had it delivered.  Although the service was good, I wouldn't return.

Oh, that beer btw was $9. It was Hoegarden on tap, but still. And I don't mind paying the price, but the service was just sucky. I ended up with two lattes on the bill, and when I brought it up, the waiter was a bit pissy about it. I ended up getting a double latte in exchange. My suggestion, btw: give me another latte -didn't ask for double- that you already charged me for, so you don't have fuss with running the card again. They don't seem to have to-go containers for liquids, I had to carry my latte in a lidless soda cup. Fun.",JXEN61J30pfm9N_jAPSMbg,0,0,2,eYppGlU-HNhSmGZsXFOCbw

This place was fine for that purpose.  It is on the casino floor so there is quite a lot of noise, but it didnt detract from the exprience.  My Dad had the burger which tasted great and I had the scallops, seared to perfection and very tender.  My wife had the shrimp risotto which was nice, although a little too rich for her taste.  Mum had the Halibut I think, I cant remember, so it wasn't anything mind blowing.

Wine list was good but not overwhelming, so easy to choose a couple of good ones.  The server was knowledgeable and did help out (which is good because I dont think they had a Sommelier!).  We ordered the Bonaccorsi Pinot Noir which was reasonably priced for wine... and more to the point, for wine in vegas.  (Different experience at StripSteak I can tell you!).

We ate family style (cuz that's how we roll). Food rating:

Sausage pizza: Good. Although we did not see actual sausage bits on it. Looked a lot like the
Sopresata pizza: Also good. Tasty!
Fuji Apple salad: Pretty darn good. Crisp and light.
Chips: AWESOMENESS. Covered in melty cheesy goodness with bleu cheese chunks and parsley. Nom Nom Nom
Pork Belly BLT: The absolute shiznit. Orgasmically delicious. I deconstructed that bitch and ended up just eating the meat. Hella good! Almost good enough to earn Wolfgang another star, but my feet hurt from walking to and from the conference and all over McCarran airport, in 5 inch heels and I am not in a giving mood right now.
Pineapple ginger mojito: Good, but I'd prefer the
Raspberry lemon drop: Really good if lemon drops are your thing. They're not MY thing, but this one was pretty damn good (like how I like my men: strong, and able to quench my thirst).

Our server was really really nice though, and accommodated us by splitting our bill three ways (for ease of company expensing later). Employees were nice and smiled and greeted us as we came/left. Overall, good experience. Had a good time with the work peeps - The only downside was the wait , so minus one star, especially because we ran the risk of being late to the first session of the conference. To be clear I started with four stars because the food overall was not so great to give it five.

Was staying at the MGM and thought dining at the Wolfgang Puck's Bar & Grill would be a good experience. Overall I would say it was average at best and there are many more places with similiar price tags that has better food.

The ambience is what I best remember of the restaurant. It was very hip and very well done.  The problem with the restaurant is the noise level. It is located right in the center of the casino, so the place can get very noisey. If you're looking for a quite dinning experience this not it. 

The food here is ok. The planting and presentation is excellent but the food is just ok. Appetizers start at $10 up to $20. Had the grilled chopped vegetable salad and this was the best part of the whole dinning experience. My girlfriend had the pizza and it was ok. Nothing special and had better pizza at my local pizza stop. I had the flat iron steak and that was ok. It wasn't anything special either and just as good as my local stop. The portion size was good to poor. The vegetable salad was enough for two, the pizza was about a 12 inch pizza. The steak was a small amount steak and you had more fries than steaks.  The prices here are about double than most places.

4484663,2011-04-28,1,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Girls' Night Out at Wolfgang Puck at MGM.  This was my first time here, or at any of Wolfie's restaurants, for that matter.  I loosened up with a nice Prosecco.  

The four of us shared three entrees:  the mushroom and leek pizza, the Chinoise salad, and a huge chicken schnitzel.  Before the food arrived, we munched on the fabulous bread, and I could have filled up on that.  But I'm glad I didn't.

The salad wasn't my choice, and I wasn't expecting to like it; I don't like to lard it up my salads with fried wonton strips, and the candied part of the peanuts wasn't enticing.  I like my peanuts straight, thank you.  The dressing was described as having a Chinese mustard base, which I always skip.  But, voila, it all worked, and it was fantastic - I wished the portion had been larger.  But the size of the schnitzel more than made up for it:  it was huge, freshly fried, hot, and not dried out, and covered with an arugula salad with cherry tomatoes that topped it to perfection.  Five stars on both of them.

The pizza, which brought ol' Wolfgang his fame, was a disappointment.  Oh, the topping was wonderful: plenty of dark, earthy mushrooms and a terrific taglio-something cheese.  But the crust wasn't baked enough.  We sent it back, and its replacement was baked a bit more, but it was still droopy and missing something.  Then I realized that the texture was completely different from the hardened semolina wheat I trained my chops on in a lifetime in New York.  This pizza crust could never rival that, no matter how long it was in the oven.  The wheat is just too soft.

Service was excellent, from the waiter, manager, and busboy.  Before check time came, I asked about the 20% discount offered to locals that I had read about just recently.  The waiter said they didn't offer it.  He sent the manager over without us asking, who repeated that it wasn't an option, but that they do offer locals a free dessert for every two people.  So who'd pass on dessert, even though we really didn't want it.  (Well, my FRIENDS didn't want it, but I have no will power).  We ordered the Valrona chocolate torte, and ice cream with berries in a crispy shell.  It took all of my strength to leave a bit of that chocolate cake on the plate and waddle out of the restaurant.

The highlight was when my friend surprised us and paid the bill with her points.  That was an even better dessert!!!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,1,4,QN2l4LnsuzkMSxVZA4YhgQ

Got hungry around 4 a.m. and since we were staying at MGM, only the  Wolfgang Puck Cafe was open.  We sat down and were pleasantly surprised by a rather ecclectic menu for so late.  The hottie got the BLT and I got a stack of pancakes.

The BLT was da bomb!  It was so good I wanted to go back the next day just to order it again.  Instead of the flimsy little bacon you usually get, Wolfgang gives you a large thick piece of pork belly.  Sooooo good with a nice amount of flavorful pork fat and smokey meat.  Crispy toast and also some avacado for creaminess.  One of the best things I've ever eaten.

Oh..... well as you can see I ate most of the hottie's BLT so she ended up with most of my pancakes.  The pancakes were nothing special but they did give you a nice heap of blue berries and a great vanilla mascarpone that acted as the butter.

Had to ask for spoon (pasta appropriate).  Had to ask for bread and waited as the food got cold.  Had to ask for parmasean.  Had to ask four times to include utensils in to go bag.  Had to seriously keep from getting annoyed because despite her inability to properly serve us, she was trying. Her and the busboy were seriously running around.  And it didn't help that there was an obnoxious group of people so loud and out of control that the floor manager had to talk to them and apologize for them to us which was appreciated.  Nevertheless two tables got up and left.  We would've been the third but it was late and we were starving.

I could go on about the how bad the food and how slow service was but the real problem was the manager lack of integrity.

Good Mac and chz, good salmon, good truffle chips, good crab cakes. Recommended as a solid meal with impeccable service, but it probably won't make your top 10 meals of all time list.

OK...Part 2.  Because EVERYTHING at MGM closes at 10pm (except this place), we ate here again the very next night.  We had the chinese chicken salad, brussel sprouts, chicken wings and the chopped veg salad.  Everything was great.  Food that is.  Service was uneven.

The bartender was polite but put everyone at the bar before me for some reason. I kept having to call him over for more water & tea. It seemed as though he thought I wouldn't tip as much as the others or something.

I ordered the pizza which was the least successful out of all the dishes I tried.

The pizza is on par with other pizzas, but more pricey. You're better off trying other dishes on the menu.

I had a couple bites of a sweet corn and cheese ravioli which was fantastic. Everything on the plate balanced really well together and you could tell the fresh quality of the ingredients on the plate. A friend also ordered a halibut with spinach which was amazing. I'd recommend trying those!

We've been walking past this place for YEARS and the kids FINALLy convinced our parents to give it a chance instead of dim sum at Pearl or chinese at Grand Wok again. and OHHH VICTORY WAS OURS =D

_Tuna Tartare_
perfectly crisped chips, fresh tuna and avocado chunks, delicious sauce. YUM.

_Crab cakes_
I'm getting giddy thinkin about these! I LOVE crab cakes! and boy do they do it RIGHT. it's not your usual crab cake with tartar sauce. oh no. it's 4 lightly crumbed/fried wondercakes set atop a delicious pesto sauce and topped with a juicy tomato salsa and watercress. what a wonderful twist!

_all other entrees (salmon, chicken, steak)_
delicious. each with their own unique and well complemented sauces. 

_pizza_ 
Love the crust. freshly toasted from their oven behind the bar.
toppings are fresh but it didnt have that stringy cheese that I like =[

_Chocolate Souffle_
OH YUM. =D
it comes in a huge ramekin and baked to perfection. puffy top. soft and steamy cake layer enveloping the melty steamy gooey inside. served with a side of vanilla bean ice cream. AMAZING =D Better than Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. but a step behind Nobhill's banana souffle!

Delicious meat, loved the horseradish spread, which wasn't too strong, and the  bread was just the right amount of crunchy.

Super cute decor and good vibe, until we were greeted, or should I say not greeted by our server. It seemed as if we were bothering her by sitting down. Crappy attitude from the minute we sat down. Total ruined our vibe instantly. We tried to stay focussed on fun and not her crappy attitude. 

I asked a few questions about the wine and she acted as though I was a complete idiot. She did not even understand my questions. Ok, moving on. Our food came before our drinks...WTF? We are in Vegas! Ok, they bring two out of four plates of food, then drinks, then the other two plates, over a 8-9 minute stretch. Frustrating! 

My mushroom raviolis were good ($25.00) , my friends gnocchi was soft and mushy. Spaghetti;s were fine. 

Manager happens to stop by our table and asks how things are. I decided to tell him what a bad experience we were having. He was apologetic and said he would make it better. He asked if we needed more drinks and kind of pushed that we all have another. We said ok. It was as if he was going to buy us a round for our troubles.The waitress never came back, he served us the rest of our meal. 

Bill comes, he did not comp us even one thing. He acted as if he was going to and then nothing. Whenever a manager gets involved usually at least one think is comped. It was actually shocking. We had explained how we were here for business and how she ruined the whole vibe...anyways. We then said how disappointed in the whole night and especially our bill, when he pushed drinks on us and then didn't even comp them.

Obviously it's a little on the pricier side because it's Wolfgang Puck but I thought the flavors were super good and consistent.  We definitely paid for quality and taste.  Actually, the portion sizes were generous as well.

The first time here, my friend and I ordered the Pork Belly BLT and the Garlic-Chili Glazed Wings.  Holy hell.  Both were really good.  The BLT was delicious especially with the use of arugula instead of typical lettuce and the pork belly was very flavorful.  Even though it was good, I still felt like it was lacking something.  Maybe a stronger sauce or more pork belly?  Not sure.  But the pasta that came with it was lackluster, next time I would ask them to sub it out with fries or something.  We barely touched it, better to save our calories for more tequila ;)

As for the garlic-chili wings, they were really yummy and good-sized wings.  I liked the flavor on them.  So much so that we ordered them again after our night at Tabu Lounge.  One of my friends got a different salad each time she went and she really enjoyed them.  My favorite was the Caesar salad with no white anchovies.  The cheese that accompanied it was potent but in such a good way :P  We were able to split the salad three ways no problem :)

2) Drinks: Mixed reviews..... Margarita strong and tasted ok. Cranberry Mojito was yummy tasting but pretty weak.

4692377,2010-06-22,1,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"We found ourselves still awake, a little drunk, and starving at 4am on a Thursday morning while staying at MGM and realized there were only two options for food.  McDonalds (ugh) or Wolfgang Pucks.  Wolfgang Pucks totally overexposed itself.  I think of WP and think of airport food or frozen pizza.  Or well.. just commercialized bullsh*t.  

But, there was no way we were going to McDonalds.

We found our seats at the bar, told the bartender we had a Prima card and he immediately put in a free order of Truffled Potato Chips with Maytag Blue Cheese and Chives.  Looking through the menu we stopped on the ""Croque Madame"" - Grilled Ham and Gruyere with Fried Egg and Mixed Green Salad and both decided that we should each get one.  I mean, come on, who can split a croque madame.

Now here was go.  The potato chips?  Stupid good.  Truffle sauce lined the bottom of the plate.  The blue cheese was soft and scoopable and we finished every last morsel on the plate.  Amazing.

But the croque madame was the winner.  Actually it was the food winner of the entire vacation.  Never in my life have I tasted something so sinfully delicious.. ham, gruyere, bechamel, the perfect fried egg... holy heaven.  The thing was bigger than my head.  The side salad was tossed with a dressing that actually tasted like a breakfast salad.   I finished the entire thing and still wanted more.  My opinion of Wolfgang has been forever changed back to the great chef, leader and brand we knew him to be.

If you're in Vegas, I swear to god you need to stay up late - go to Wolfgang Puck - order the croque madame and potato chips... and your trip to Vegas will be worth every dime that you lost in Vegas.",jnQ6HKXkDqebDu-HpohFnA,1,0,5,mqZyB-GIZWT1y1Gv_lnDcg

However, I've always enjoyed my meal.  The space is a bit cramped at the bar.  It seems the space wasn't well planned.  Casinos need more bar space as there are a lot more single patrons.

So can you trust my 4 AM-in-Vegas mac 'n cheese testimonial? Absolutely! That was some damn good macaroni and four cheeses. Hot, creamy, and salty...and tucked into the perfect little cast iron pot to safely house some 1500 or so calories. Exactly what I had wanted.

And then there was the, ""I just want something small"" - famous last words of a man. My husband ordered a wood oven pizza with prosciutto, Kalamata olives, oven dried tomatoes, basil pesto, and goat cheese. After unattractively housing my dish, I tried a piece of the pizza (sans crust - tummy was starting to protest), which was fantastic. Kalamata olives blow me away every time I eat them on a pizza or flatbread. Just delicious. My husband apparently agreed; he ate all but two slices of the rest...and then we went upstairs to our room and he ate those two. Gross, but not really...it WAS that good.

We were in and out pretty quickly and all cravings were satisfied! Definitely loved it.

Who knows. But the pizza was good. But usually always is. Simple ingredients. Can't really mess it up. The bf had the fish of the day which happened to be halibut. It had to be the smallest portion ever! With no sides. It had a sweet corn puree under it and nothing else! For 30 bucks!? Soo not worth it. 

I don't think you get much of an experience from Wolfgang so I can't say even if the food is cruddy that you'd have fun. But if you really must try it then I guess there's no stopping you.",B9lDn4yYQrazBbAeb4Zn5w,1,2,2,4iqhGWOY5IuuZeSfmcv3_Q

I say overpriced, but shockingly they also have one of the cheapest items around as well: their pizza. The pizza was ridiculously cheap compared to everything else, was under $20 and was more than enough for two people (we had a box to take the rest home).

The people near us had a burger and steak, and neither seemed too happy with their choices. The burger was cooked beyond recognition, looked like a huge hunk of coal.

Their pasta looked good, but not almost $30 a plate good.

Oh, and our pizza was decent, a little plain though. The crust was ridiculously basic, no flavor or spices added to it, overall didn't have a ton of flavor, but if you're drunk or high I'm sure it tastes pretty good. Just don't order a soda or anything, they're like $5 each or some nonsense.

We ordered the Butter Lettuce ""Caesar Salad"", MEATBALL WOOD OVEN PIZZA, and HOUSE MADE SPAGHETTINI PASTA. The salad was fresh. The Humboldt Fog Cheese was too strong for Bryan and I. But it was a good salad.

The homemade pasta dish had the simplest ingredients, which were tomatoes, basils, and garlic. It looked so simple that I didn't even take a picture. But the dish was amazing! The pasta was fresh and al dente. The sauce was packed with flavors. I couldn't stop eating. The meatball pizza was another surprise. The first bite was like a party in my mouth, which I didn't expect at all! There were layers of flavors, like the creamy Mozzarella, the sweet tomatoes, the fresh basil, and the tasty meatball. Everything went so well together. My husband loved the pizza absolutely.

Even though we were a bit full, I just couldn't pass the dessert. We got the RASPBERRY CHOCOLATE CHIP SOUFFLE. Wow..... It was light, a little tart, and very chocolatey. It was the best souffle ever! That was the perfect sweet ending.

Overall, my husband and I were very satisfied. For the two of us, our check was about $65. It wasn't expensive for a famous chef's restaurant! The food was simple. It wasn't some expensive ingredients, but everything was delicious. A simple meal can go a long way if food is cooked right. It was a very memorable meal. I couldn't wait to go back.

The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. Even the bus boy was great with taking away plates. 

I had a really good experience here, and I felt like the food was priced right and was a good value. Check it out if you happen to be near the MGM.",yHKVmPE2YCZD_vd9-QCLag,0,0,5,OEnQTMUI9tll0VTmhuwlLw
4958312,2013-03-26,1,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I ate lunch at Bar & Grill on Thursday during the first day of the NCAA tourney.  I sat at the bar, which was served by a single bartender.  She appeared to be VERY busy to the point I think they should have had someone else over there.  But, for the most part, she managed.  I didn't have to wait on water refills or anything like that.  But, she was in need of some help I think.

I had the BBQ chicken panini with fries.  On the side, I requested the maytag blue cheese sauce they served with their potato chip appetizer.  The sandwich was very good, and large.  The onions were caramelized nicely and the sauce was more sweet, but didn't totally lack for flavor.  I prefer things a little spicier.  The fries were thin and had herbs sprinkled on them.  They needed salt and pepper, and were really good when those were added.  Large order.

The maytag blue cheese sauce is crazy good.  They clearly just made it, as the bowl was warm and there were still a couple of chunks of cheese that hadn't melted.  The blue cheese flavor comes through and the herbs they add complement it well.  This is an excellent dipping sauce, get it if you come.  They charged me $3.33 for it, which was fine, but I was not told that when I ordered it.  So, that was surprising to find on the bill, but it's worth it.  I just would prefer they mention it when I ordered it.

The beer selection left a lot to be desired.  Only 6 on tap.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,0,0,3,3OcH9dJuOcTcqgjXFFKcbQ

The first time, we came here for supper at around 12+ am. We ordered the tuna tartare and steamed black mussels. The tuna tartare was really good, definitely a must try. The black mussels was slightly salty and the toast with bearnaise didnt really work. Neither did the fries with bearnaise/ ketchup sauce. Actually, everything just tasted extremely salty that night, even the bread.

Since we were fans of mussels, we decided to give it another chance by coming here for lunch again. This time, the mussels were perfectly cooked (although the toast, fries and bearnaise still didnt work). We also ordered the crab cakes which were so amazing - this is how crab cakes should be done!! The grilled shrimps on the capellini were also pretty good.

The service, however, really needs some work. They were either too eager to clear our plates, or didnt bother to clear them at all. The waiters are slow, and it is extremely difficult to catch their eye. 

I would come back not for the service, but for the appetisers and mussels and almost round the clock opening hours. Then again, I'm biased towards mussels. I'm giving this place a 3.5 stars, but am picking 3 for the crappy service.",bqJNDwrpF-vULjAVAh_LyQ,3,2,3,_W0OB-bfeSndwtR9k-gApA

The restaurant is clean and has nice decor. We ordered the ""Tempura Battered Fish"". It was not tempura battered, definitely beer battered.

I had a pineapple-ginger mojito (really good!), the 3-cheese mac & cheese (very large portion, I could have eaten it as a meal, or it's a very good size to share) and the flat iron steak entree.

I really liked the 3 cheese mac & cheese, it comes with a cavatappi pasta, melted cheese, and breadcrumbs on top - although there was a minor implementation issue - it comes in a deep cast iron dish about 6"" x 3"" x 3"" or so.  The cheese on top was boiling when I got it... but there were a couple cold bites in the middle.  They weren't *hard* cold per se, just not fully heated.  Not enough to bother sending it back because other than that it was terrific, and there were probably only about 2 bites of the whole thing that were cold.

The flatiron steak was good too, it came with fries and a few green beans and had a wine sauce & a teensy bit of blue cheese butter.  I really only had one bite that tasted like blue cheese at all, would have liked a little more of that, but the steak had good flavor and the wine sauce actually worked really well to allow the fries to soak into.  

Service at the bar was friendly, not as 'in-depth' as you're going to get at a table, but no complaints.

The server was raving about their pastas so I had the special - lobster ravioli - and my wife ordered grilled salmon with roasted corn salad.

Sounds great right?  Well, not so much.  My lobster ravioli was actually three (3!) cheese ravioli served with a bland ""lobster"" sauce and chewy bits of spiny lobster (langouste, actually as much a crawfish as a lobster).  The ravioli were chewy (not al dente), the langouste were rubbery and the sauce had little/no lobster taste.  

Three ravioli for $36, $12 apiece for undercooked cheese ravioli and chewy rock lobster bits.  Had we not waited so long for the food to show up I would have sent it back.

The salmon was small but well cooked.  Flavor was pretty good, but the corn salad accompaniment was nothing special.  Cost $33.

The basket of breads was good, and the seasonal soup (chicken tortilla) was really well prepared - the only item we had that was worth the price ($12).

Two and a half star food at four-star prices.  Rated R (Ripoff).

We asked the hostess what her favorites were currently which was the chicken wings and chicken milanese. So we ordered that and a pepperoni pizza.

The wings were $16 which was a little expensive, but they tasted amazing. They were lightly sweet with a Latin fish sauce and had chilies (which brought the entire dish together). 5/5

However, that was the only thing about the meal that was good.

The pizza came and when we tried taking a bite of it, the toppings (cheese and all) just slid off. Granted it was hot, but i do not prefer eating pizza with a fork and knife. 3/5

The chicken milanese was overcooked and dry. I have had chicken milanese before and it was flavorful. At WPB, it was lacking in seasoning, flavor and tenderness. The salad on top was overdressed and overly salty. I did try it together and it did not do it for me. I have a feeling instead of it being pan fried, it was deep fried by the dryness of it. 1/5

We didn't order cocktails, as there are places with more reasonable prices. I mean $17 for a muscow mule, which is: vodka, ginger beer and a little lime. We just went to whiskey down and had amazing whisky at that price.

I would say, get the wings and maybe some fries and then get out, not worth the price for the quality of the food.",6Tuw7lr7Zg1nzBpG2mJNtQ,1,0,2,noQF4hwdzC_RxEdR3GfB1w

food though? disappointing. 

i tried some of my friend's truffle chips and it was good! chips were perfectly fried, the truffle oil and cheese complemented the potatos chips very well.

i also had a few bites of my friends mac and cheese, and it was delicious! no crispy top layer, but it was cheesy and subtle.

three people on my side of the table ordered the linguine and clams dish and...it was terrible. it's basically linguine and clams with some chili flakes and pancetta. just reading it off the menu, we were all sold...but then we were disappointed. i barely put a dent into my meal because it was EXTREMELY SALTY. i'm pretty sure my blood pressure rose with each bite. i thought it was just mine, but the others agreed that it was on the salty side; unfortunately, i think my salt tolerance was lower than theirs so it really wasn't edible. we thought about saying something, but i didn't want to be difficult... the pasta was salty and i'm sure the pancetta (bacon!!!!) didn't help. i didn't taste the heat from the chili pepper either. was pretty disappointed to pay nearly $30 for this dish. i didn't even bother taking it to go.

It is an open restaurant in the casino of the MGM. It wasn't loud when we went, due to the hour. There were only a couple other tables occupied & one server to the whole place. However, service was amazing! The waiter was friendly and courteous in demeanor, and very attentive. The busboy was also very attentive and kept our waters filled and other needs met. 

My boyfriend ordered the chicken salad sandwich, which came with a lemon-y vinaigrette side salad. The sandwich was unique, but tasted good to him, and include grapes, and a hearty fruit & nut bread.

We started with the blue cheese truffle potato chips that everyone was raving about. I actually sent them back. I was so excited to try these as I love truffle & blue cheese! But to me, it didn't quite work. The chips were very oily. The sauce was warm & creamy, kind of like alfredo, & there were large chunks of blue cheese, which I actually felt was overwhelming! The warm sauce also made the chips in the middle a bit soggy. The waiter was incredibly gracious when he took away the dish & insisted that we not pay for anything we don't love.

For my meal, I got the wild mushroom pizza, which I ate for the next 2 days! It was very flavorful with the addition of leeks, broccolini, & some garlic. It was a bit oily, but after a couple blots it was good.The crust was also the perfect thickness.

The staff are excellent!! The hostesses were sweet as pie, and the waiters were fast, friendly, and fun.  This is a great group to have in Vegas, and I will definitely be back next time I'm there.  As a matter of fact, we loved it so much, this was the only place we really ate.  (Unless you count our liquid diet.)  ;)

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  I love the openness of it, with the colorful dividers.  A great way to showcase the dining room, but still let us see the casino.

The food was so good, but the item that really sticks out to me is the corn beef sandwich on pretzel bread.  Yes you read that correctly.  It was so good!  I asked for no cole slaw, so the sandwich was corn beef, melted cheese, and spicy mustard.  ON PRETZEL BREAD.  This is one of those rare food items that I don't even care about the caloric content.  I just want to shove it in my face!  The potato salad was excellent, and the pasta salad was fresh and summery, but filling enough to soak up some of those dangerous pool drinks.

Open until 6 am so its a life saver when drunk and hangry! 

Pretty decent cheeseburger here. Big and filling. Fries are shoestring style and just ok. A few craft beers on tap about six or so such as Full Sail Amber.

Plenty of seating surrounding the floor, and a nice bar area I sat at. The bartender on duty that night was attentive enough and got me my food and drink pretty quickly.

We ordered the prosciutto pizza and it was really good. My favorite part of it was actually the arugula on top since it cut the richness of all the cheese and added a freshness to the pizza. We also got two of the pastas to share; the rigatoni and spaghetti & meatballs. Both were excellent and very flavorful, I liked the spaghetti more. 

To end our meal we shared the chocolate soufflé. I was hesitant on if I should get it or not at first since I was extremely full but I'm so glad I chose to. It was one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had. It had a nice crunchy top with a nice fluffy and rich inside. It also came with a caramel ice cream which went really well with the soufflé.

They had some cool and unusual drinks... this won't be much help, but I got an unique mojito that was very good. It's on the menu, or at least was. Boy, am I drinking now too? Sheesh.

Came around for dinner and were seated, water glasses filled, and drink orders taken almost immediately. They have unlimited, complimentary bread, which was delicious! Majority of the menu was either spaghetti, pizza, or meat (burger, fish, steak). We all ordered a different type of spaghetti. I'd highly recommend the linguini with Manila Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Chili, Wild Oregano because out of all four dishes, that one was the best. My friend did add lemon to give it a little kick.

We ordered two marinara sauces - Housemade spaghetti and spaghetti&meatballs. They're your generic spaghetti with basil, tomatoes, and garlic, only differences was the type of tomatoes and that one had meatballs and one did not. Both of these dishes were so, so, SO salty that I drank about three giant gulps of water per spaghetti bite. And normally, I LOVE salt, BUT I had pee like crazy pregnant woman afterwards. o___o Too much salt!

The last dish we ordered was the Wild Mushroom Agnolotti, Sweet Peas, Caramelized Shallots, Parmesan. It was pretty good if you like more dough-y, lightly sauced pasta. I personally did not like it and felt it could be more flavorful, but each to their own. Also, they don't put salt or pepper shakers on the table (arrogant? or doing a classy look?) and they did not offer parmesan (even though they offered the table next to us parmesan. hmm why?).

5297989,2015-03-20,1,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"I made reservations 2 weeks ahead prior to my trip to Las Vegas. I would recommend reservations, for Wolfgang gets pretty packed. This restaurant attracts many being located by the MGM casino. It is located by KA ticket booth as well as MGM's concierge. 

We arrived here to dine before a show and waited a few minutes before being seated even with reservations. Our waiter comes shortly afterwards with onion bread and butter. My friends couldn't stop eating the bread.

I quickly ordered the Truffled Potato chips (3/5), thinking it would be amazing from previous Yelpers dining here. These chips are drizzled with Maytag Bleu Cheese. I was quite disappointed when I took the first bite, for there was some factor lacking in this appetizer. We asked for Tabasco sauce and jalapeños, which made the chips taste x10 better than previously. The waiter gave us 4 cute travel sized Tobasco bottles! I had to take one home. Anyways, these chips are great for munching on in front of a TV, not at a restaurant.

Unfortunately, we were quite full from our lunch several hours before. We decided to order another appetizer, Mesquite Grilled Steak Skewers (4/5) served over a bed of coleslaw. I enjoyed these more than the chips. The steak skewers (5 of them) were juicy, like the juices were crying out when the steak was being cut. The house steak sauce was neither spicy nor sweet. It was between the middle, which went well with the coleslaw. 

Our waiter refilled our bread basket when we asked for more that he gave us some for to-go as well. My friend was pretty happy. The atmosphere is casual but still modern/contemporary-like inside.

Truffled Potato Chips:
Homemade potato chips with blue cheese sauce drizzled with truffle oil, Served hot and crispy. I'm not a fan of blue cheese but I liked this because of the truffle oil. 5/5

Steamed Black Mussels:
Comes with grilled sourdough, chorizo, white wine, garlic and smoked paprika Bernaise. Very interesting twist to a boring bivalve. 4/5

Barbecued Pacific Salmon:
Served with caramelized white corn, peas, baby heirloom tomatoes,arugula and crispy onion rings on top. I don't like peas so I was busy sorting my peas from my corn.  The crispy onions saved the dish. 3/5

Bass: 
Comes with baby artichokes, white beans in tomato-olive vinaigrette and Romesco sauce. This was more interesting than the salmon. 4/5

Chocolate Beignets:
Dusted with powdered sugar and omes with a caramel dipping sauce and vanilla ice cream. They look like chocolate cake doughnut holes but they're less dense. 3/5

Banoffee:
It has the consistency of a cheesecake. Not too sweet. I was very intrigued by this as I've always wanted to try banoffee pie. This is my first taste of it and I was not impressed.

Overall, I think this is a great place to eat dinner if you want something other than a buffet and are not really feeling the desire to splurge lots of money on food.",29cwCgCiTFAU2v0Pti9hAw,0,0,4,ASc8_a4a5xNP1fJYShacOA

I could not get anywhere near this bar to get a drink. It was like a straight bum rush to the bar. The bartenders looked a little overwhelmed.

It was not even worth trying. I am sure they make great drinks here and I would love to come back and get a drink that was made without a rush. I would also like to sit and enjoy it.

I can't remember what we all got, but it was along the lines of pizzas. All of them were good, not great, but still delicious. They can't be that outstanding if I don't care to recall exactly what they were.

I DOOOOOOO remember our appetizer though. We saw a tables nearby with all the same thing!! So we wanted it too. Turns out their truffle chips with blue cheese was one of the most popular items on the menu. After biting into one, I could see why. Explosion of flavor with every bite. It became too much when you kept eating it without alternating flavors.

the bread basket was one of the best parts of my meal...they give u 3-4 differ types of bread...i got to try the pizza which was OK but def didnt make my list of favorites...the clam linguine had some thick pieces of thick bacon...i think there was too much bacon which made the pasta dish too salty but thats a personal preference...i'm sure some people would enjoy it more than me....i got the mushroom aglotoni pasta...nice consistency, mild in flavor and decent amount of wild mushrooms so this was one of the best picks on the evening...

service was a bit slow...we had to constantly flag down our server to request for refills, other condiments, etc... the server seemed like she was being busy running around to other tables so she wasnt being lazy...but the fact that we had to be the ones flagging her down multiple times rather than she just coming to check in on us once in a while made the dinner experience less appetizing...

5370086,2008-05-15,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Thinking of the tuna tartare is making me moist. The menu here, especially the appetizers, is brilliant. This is one of my favorite lunch time restaurants in Vegas. 

The atmosphere of Wolfgang's is incredibly trendy. The restaurant is almost all white and features lots of curves. The tables were nice and chairs were pretty comfortable. The menu's were also presented very uniquely as they were posted on a wooden board and held on by a rubber band. 

The service was exceptional. Our waiter originally thought they were out of the tuna tartare (I was completely distraught and screamed like a little girl) but then checked and reported to us that they just got a new shipment. Appetizers were served promptly with the entrees coming just as we finished up. My soda glass was always atleast half full. 

I definitely recommend the appetizers. I've already mentioned the tuna tartare which is one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life. It's a spicy tuna topped with avocado and served with lightly fried tortillas and a little bit of the most amazing chile sauce I've ever had. Seriously, the thought of the tuna tartare brings my buddy to tears. It's that good. 

We also enjoyed the crab cake appetizer which was also quite exceptional.

For my entree I've had the mussels and the fish and chips. The mussels were served in a lemon garlic sauce with foccacia bread. The portions were extremely generous and it was a meal that I enjoyed very much. The fish and chips were disappointing because this restaurant does not have malt vinegar! Luckily the fries were the bomb. You also get one of those mini catsup bottles to impress the ladies. 

Overall this is a breathtaking lunch and is highly recommended. Poker comps work here! Get the tuna tartare please.",iOyh9Rq4xcvlBnK5dgQ62g,1,0,5,XfkOtxs-LksyVl9ZbWE0ig
5370689,2013-12-22,0,N0apJkxIem2E8irTBRKnHw,"Great little place right in the heart of the MGM casino! We decided to eat dinner here before playing a little and the location is super convenient. The service was very friendly- there was a short wait but the very friendly hostess provided the option of texting your cellphone when a table is ready which lets you wander around the casino floor while you wait. 

Food was really good. There isn't a huge selection but what they do have they do well. They brought a basket of warm bread to start which was delicious. We started off with the Calamari which was tasty and cooked just right. We then shared a the prosciutto topped pizza which was amazingly delicious and more than enough for the both of us to share.

My only word of caution is that you best avoid this place if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke. This restaurant is literally in the middle of the casino with no walls separating it from the action and so you do have players lighting up all around. But then again if you're sensitive to cigarette smoke then you shouldn't be anywhere near a Vegas casino in the first place. 

I'd have to respectfully disagree with those the have criticized the pricing- for Wolfgang Puck in a Vegas Casino this was very reasonable priced. The pizza was the most expensive one on the menu priced at around $18 and the Calamari around $14- that's a bargain for a nice restaurant located in a Vegas Casino.

The food is delicious, but what made it better was the overall service. At points they were inattentive, but the complete experience was not bad. The fact that we shared everything and did not have to ask for anything to be split or an extra plate was amazing. They served our crab cakes, burger, and kabocha pumpkin agnolotti pasta as separate items for us. That simple gesture was impressive to me. 

The crab cake came in an order of four. The light mixture of tomatoes and basil enhanced the sweetness of the crab well. The burger was salty. It is not a knock your socks off type of ordeal. The pasta was my favorite. The kabocha resembles a butternut squash and takes on the flavor of the brown butter sage sauce. The toast hazelnuts adds a much needed textural variation. 

We ended our meal with the chocolate beignets. NOT A BEIGNET! It is more of a chocolate lava cake doughnut hole. They are good if you look at them like that, but as a beignet they failed.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,3,4,As56KWoibdlh3FSucBNbhQ

We had crab cakes, veal ravioli, rib eye, salmon, chinois chicken salad, and calamari. Everything was delicious, although the veal ravioli was not seasoned enough for my taste.

We stayed at the MGM Grand Signature Suites and walked down to the MGM Grand from our room, to find somewhere for dinner. Unfortunately, everything actually closes at 10:00 pm and this was the only thing still open for dinner in the hotel. We regretted not eating earlier, but what a happy mistake this turned out to be! 

Prices were higher than I thought they would be for a restaurant labeled a ""bar and grill."" The appearance of the restaurant does not give you the feeling that it is a fine dining or gourmet establishment. However, upon receiving our food I was pleasantly surprised. Also, the service was very good, our server was a young Asian woman who was friendly, extremely helpful and polite. She was also very diligent about keeping us aware on the status of our food, refilling drinks, etc. Very impressive considering that our table was in a corner far from the kitchen. We also got complimentary warm bread and whipped butter before our meal.

What we ordered: For an appetizer we ordered the House Chips, which were ""truffled potato chips, Maytag blue cheese sauce"" (about $12). Great portion, outstanding flavor. For entrees, I ordered the Mustard-crusted pork chop, which came covered in a  rhubarb chutney, on a bed of semolina ""fondue"" with aged balsamic and a side of patty pan squash. My boyfriend ordered the Pancetta Wrapped Meatloaf, Mushroom Gravy, Yukon Gold Potato Puree, Fried Onions. (Both of our entrees were around $32). For dessert, we planned to take it to go but the souffle could not be done to go because it is served in the same dish it is baked in. It took about 10 minutes, because it is prepared to order, and was well worth the wait. It came out in a large bake dish the size of a large soup bowl, with two ramekins of ice cream and a large saucer of hot chocolate sauce. The server did a ""table service"" and prepared the souffle for us, cutting it open and pouring in the ice creams and chocolate. Slowly, the wonderful souffle puffed up and expanded before we quickly consumed it. To go, I ordered the Chocolate Beignets, which are small chocolate filled donut holes with a side of caramel sauce and ice cream. This was prepared to go and we ate it in our room. 

The portions and food quality here were amazing. It was very rich, but not sickening, was not overly salted, not under or over cooked and everything was well balanced, nicely plated and extremely delicious. I would definitely eat here again.",lyXhYab9FikpcLwPVL4XWQ,0,0,5,lYh8q-wvhmeBkevZS0do5g

The staff was very friendly and brought us things in a fairly timely manner, and was good to us despite the guaranteed gratuity (since we were 15 or so strong).

The menu as someone else pointed out is standard Wolfgang Puck fare - pizzas, pasta dishes, a couple meat and fish dishes. The menu is almost like Postrio's. We ordered several pizzas for the appetizer and I had a slice of the tomato/burata mozarella/basil one - pretty good, the cheese was very gooey, and it was thin crust. I'm not a huge pizza fan, so it wasn't a big deal for me.

I must say though, I really liked the breads they brought out, with the soft room temperature butter. Mmm.

I ordered the chicken milanese for my main course, and it was huge. Instead of one chicken breast, it looked like four chicken breasts had been hammered thin, breaded, and fried. It was very delicious, along with the spinach/tomato salad. I was surprised that I liked this dish, seeing as how I usually don't like breaded chicken.

For dessert we had warm cookie plates that came with oatmeal raisin, almond tea cookies, chocolate brownie like biscotti, chocolate chip, and possibly some others. So good!! Also had chocolate brownie bar, which is a bar made with chocolate mousse and had a brownie bottom, with raspberries.

Entrees
-Linguini, Manila Clams, Garlic, Pancetta, Fresh Chili, Wild Oregano

 I ordered the crab cakes and the antipasti plate. The crab cakes were delicious! Full of nice chunks of crab and it went perfectly with the fresh basil aioli it came with. The antipasti plate was very good, great selection of cured meats. The prosciutto and salami were spectacular and so was the fresh BURRATA!  This plate also came with some marinated vegetables and some grilled bread. It all went very well together. My only complaint is that they only give you 3 slices of grilled bread for the whole plate of antipasti, the meat to bread ratio was a little off. My boyfriend got the Prime Burger and i had a bite, it was soooo good! The meat was cooked perfectly and the condiments it came with made it even better, I especially liked the coleslaw the put in the burger.

The atmosphere was nice but unimpressive; partially because it is located inside of a casino with flashing lights and lots of noise, and partially because it is a small venue within a large casino and it felt a little crowded and claustrophobic. Regardless of the overall atmosphere our group received a great table, a little more private than the others, and next to the open kitchen. 

The menu didn't seem to impressive at first; pizza, burgers, potato chips... seemed just like a regular bar. So why was the food for of pricey and what made this place so much better than a regular bar. It was the food! Who would of known that pizza didn't have to taste so average and that potato chips could be so outstanding.

I had to go back a few months later, for business again, and this time I brought my husband.

Unfortunately though, by the time I could grab dinner (10pm), my options were limited, especially since I wasn't in the mood to wander far.  Insert Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, whose namesake I'd long been curious about, but had never bothered trying.  But hey, if work is going to pay for it, why not?

Beyond my curiosity about Wolfgang Puck, coming here was also driven by how easy it was to grab a table, as well as their hours (11:30am to 6:00am?!).  Looking over the menu, several things caught my eye (they have appetizers, salads, pastas, pizzas, and a mix of entrees), but I wasn't quite sure what to get since I wasn't familiar with what their namesake is known for (as in dishes, not his multitude of restaurants).

(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wolfgang-puck-bar-and-grill-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=F0ijYEWTingrcT077Zbeqg)
Not sure what to make of this one.  The sprouts and kale were fine and the bacon added a nice saltiness.  However, the bacon wasn't a pleasant surprise if you don't eat pork (it's not listed on the menu) and made the dish both greasy and a bit sweet (it might have had maple on it).

-- RIGATONI with Fennel Sausage Bolognese, Parmesan, and Italian Parsley...$26
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wolfgang-puck-bar-and-grill-las-vegas-las-vegas?select=RdAVp_Cwk0W6DhijCnqcTw)
I would've been happy with something warm and comforting, but this was great!  The portion was quite fair and it tasted fantastic!  The pasta was well cooked and not overly sauced, but the bolognese was the star - not super sweet, well seasoned, and just a bit meaty.  Well worth ordering!

As far as service goes, it was pretty awesome, but still had one major flaw.  While the hostess and ""assistant"" servers were super friendly and helpful, my primary server was lacking on the latter.  Particularly when it came to answer questions about what they/Wolfgang Puck are known for; sorry, but, ""Uhh...depends on what you like"", ""he's good at everything he makes"", and ""pizzas seem popular"" don't really do much.

Other than my primary server, as well as that sprouts dish, my experience here was surprisingly satisfying.  I may not have had high expectations, but it was still a solid meal and I'd be happy to get the rigatoni again (or to try something new).

So no one told us that you could starve to death on a Monday night in Vegas. After midnight, we gratefully stumbled in, happy to get anything at all to eat. 

Hopes were high. Although this place is in the middle of the casino, the design feels chic and modern. But then reality set in.

The waitress actually snickered at my husband's cocktail order, and it wasn't even a girly drink! He was a bit taken aback. (The weird thing is, the waitress snickered again later, a propos of nothing. So I think the snickering is some nervous tic, an unfortunate one when you're dealing with the public, but nothing personal.)

We ordered the Italian sausage pizza. How to put this? It was awful: a drooping, oily, tasteless mess. It was not possible, physically or psychologically, to eat it.

But this place is awesome. Don't see why some of 2 stars are complaining so much. This is Vegas!! Pricing of food is high everywhere come on now.

Food was good and the service was great!!! Your cup was filled up before it was below half way, if you got up to use the restroom the waiter would come by and fix/fold your napkin. The guys were on it. We had a party of 12 so I made a reservation just on case. They had a waiter on each side of the table taking the orders which was cool, and at the end of the meal the waiter asked if we wanted separate checks. I thought that was pretty cool.

Everyone was treated great and I would recommend coming here. Steak was good, pizza was good, ravioli was good and the burger was good lol.",eLv-z5jhlAMPP3MP4CtOpw,4,4,5,Tyq-Kh0hJRWzuVICq2S8TA

Mmmmm, martinis. It had been a ridiculously long week and I really wanted to have a relaxing late-night dinner with some smooth, wonderful martinis. Ahhhh, martinis.

We ended up at Wolfgang Puck while wandering through the MGM Grand, so hungry that we were too delirious to make a real decision. Luckily, everything was fantastic. I had some of the best gnocchi ever - even the sausage in the sauce was good, and I don't even like sausage - and Jess had a hamburger, which she kindly gave me 1/4 of, and it was so yummy. For dessert, we split the chocolate souffle, which is easily enough to feed ten people and their horses.

But the martinis! Seriously! Everything I had been dreaming about and more. Jess tried something raspberry-ish that was quite tasty, but I had the pear, and it was EXACTLY LIKE BITING INTO A PEAR, except there was no biting involved. Just delightful, relaxing sipping.

My friend insisted that we tried the truffle potato chips from the rave reviews she got from yelp, so we did. Extremely underwhelming... It was not even hot. The chips didn't feel super crispy.

Tips:
- We ordered the ribeye and told them we would be sharing. They will split everything (vegetables, steak, etc.) for you without an additional cost. Nicer restaurants typically do this for their customers, but some will charge a fee.

Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill is a bit misleading in it's complexity.  One quick look would expect a great place to grab a quick drink and some pub food, and you wouldn't be wrong in that regard, but you'd miss the other amazing entrees covering seafood, pasta, and more.

I started my meal with the tuna tartar.  The fish was packed with flavor, topped with fresh avocado and a spicy sriracha aïoli sauce that blended savory and spicy with just a hint of tart.  For my main course, I split their mushroom pizza and seafood pasta.  The pizza, more catered to the bar lover's food, consisted of a variety of wild mushrooms, layered evenly so that each bit had a different flavor, then topped with a black truffle sauce for added punch.  The seafood pasta was loaded with shrimp, scallops, and fish, covered in a creamy tomato sauce that felt rich and satisfying.  

And while you can get free drinks at any of the slot machines, I recommend enjoying one of Wolfgang's cocktails.  Their moscow mule was packed with smooth vodka that went down easy and refreshed me for a night of partying.

I have to admit, I was a bit worried about how the food, ambiance and service would be, considering the celebrity chef name, but I was not diappointed.  

I love the layout of the restaurant.  First, it is located close to the KA theater, so is really convenient for a pre or post show bite to eat.  The restaurant itself also has really nice decor and is open to the casino, but is not loud or smoky.  There is a bar when you first enter, and you can order food there as well.

The menu is pretty diverse.  I love the burger, the wood fired pizzas, the chinese chicken salad, the apple salad.  Most of all I LOVE the truffled potato chips.  I pray that they NEVER remove these from the menu.  They are so damn delicious.  The chips are fresh and covered in blue cheese and truffle oil and just amazing.  The restaurant has a decent beer and wine selection and the staff is always friendly and knowledgable as well.

The other great thing is that they are open LATE.  They have a graveyard menu and close at 6am, then reopen at 11am for lunch.

I stumbled upon this place and couldn't be happier. The environment and decor of this place makes you feel like you are in Vegas, not at some cheapo place. 

The entrees range from about $12-25, but the ""cheap"" part of it is the pizzas. A pizza is large enough for 2 people to share and they are only $12-15 each! But if you have a big appetite, you can get your own pizza and it's still a pretty good deal. I got the chicken, eggplant, cilantro, and pepper pizza. My boyfriend got the Italian sausage, pepperoni, and tomato pizza. Both were very fresh and served hot. 

We also ordered dessert--chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. It was light in texture but rich in flavor! My boyfriend ordered a Dos Equis on draft and it was $9.

I didn't expect to have such a great experience because we ate here just to kill time before catching the KA show, but I was proven otherwise. We did have to wait a little even with reservations but it wasn't too bad. One thing that didn't make sense is their layout, where people were literally standing around waiting for their tables around other diners who are eating at their tables. There wasn't really a good place to stand around to wait aside from around the other diners near the hostess desk, so either you go to the casino floor and play the slots machine or you go to the packed bar which you also need to be seated for.

But once we were taken to our table everything else went smoothly. The food was great. We had the fish of the day which was halibut over this creamy sweet corn sauce and the Grilled Salmon with artichoke puree accompanied by a delightful blood orange champagne and a drink we can't remember the name of but was some version of the mojito. We ended dinner with the most delicious banana and toffee cream pie with yummy toasty crust.

Service was a little slow but attentive. We understood that they were very busy. They also had this small wine cellar room which we saw an intimate wedding party mid-celebration. It was very romantic.

He seems to have a restaurant in every casino on the Las Vegas strip (am exaggerating but you get the idea).  My boyfriend ate something with pancetta in it last year and it changed his life.  He kept talking about it all year long so we decided to reawaken his taste buds by returning to Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill.

There seems to always be a wait but never a long one.  The restaurant is practically smack dab in the middle of the casino making it easy to find.  Unfortunately I was sitting right next to this giant light in the ground that blinded me every time I shifted in my seat.  I was tempted to ask to be seated elsewhere but I was too hungry to move so I just sucked it up.  But the next time you're about to get seated next to this giant twine sculpture with the light in the ground, I advise you to ask to be seated elsewhere before you plant your bottom.

We were disappointed to see that the menu has changed since the last time we were there and my boyfriend could not find his heavenly pancetta risotto dish and settled for a pancetta wrapped meatloaf instead.  I quickly snuck a peek at yelp to see whats good and decided on a wild mushroom ravioli.  The waiter sadly informed me that the dish was no longer available and recommended the gnocchi with a bolognese sauce.  Although I was a bit disappointed, I went with his suggestion.  We also decided to start with the crab cakes as we were both ravishingly hungry by this time.

The crab cakes came out in four tiny little cakes.  Albeit rather small, they were packed with flavor.  I would return just to get three orders of the crab cakes for myself.  The pancetta wrapped meatloaf was nothing like your mother used to make.  The pancetta was baked to a nice crisp while the meatloaf was soft and juicy.  My gnocchi was good but I probably wouldn't get it again.  It was not very memorable and it was just so-so to me.  I think I was just bummed that I didn't get to try the ravioli that my fellow yelpers raved about.",umSm9RjNataX1h9D-wa6Kw,0,0,4,EBu7XJ0Bdc43ek_YJbEV9Q

Our waiter came over immediately to take our drink orders (tap water) and informed us of the specials.  Complimentary bread (onion focaccia and Italian) and butter was served. The focaccia was excellent, Italian somewhat dry.

We opted to share the Asian Chicken Salad and the Sausage and spinach pizza. The Asian Chicken salad was excellent and they split the salad onto two plates (a nice/convenient touch) and was very filling.  Shortly after, the pizza came out and it was piping hot and very good.   A little hard to cut with our butter knives but very good.  A perfect amount of food for two.

The Cobb salad had good amounts of everything, super quality ingredients. However, I found the vinaigrette very assertive with acid. If I ate more than two bites of lettuce without something else between, my tongue was burning.

Our host was wonderful and attentive--I met him the day before when I dropped off the cake server, champagne glasses, cake toppers, and placecards.  We chatted for about 20 minutes the day before about why we had chosen Vegas to get married and that sort of thing--on the day of, he was super sweet and he made sure everyone was taken care of completely.  Our party was in the small private room, with the wine cabinet against one wall, and it was very nice.

The only reason they don't get 5 stars was due to a mixup with how the cake was to be paid (I'd faxed the info in about 6 weeks prior and I have no idea what happened to it).

I was craving breakfast at 2 in the afternoon and even though they weren't serving it, they had a buttermilk biscuit egg sandwich with sausage and cheddar on the menu that was calling my name, one of the best I've had hands down. 

The bartender was on point, he kept the wine coming and the water flowing as I was dehydrated and probably needed about six glasses by the end of lunch.

Felt there wasn't much to it just potato chips topped with a truffle cream sauce and chunks of blue cheese. For the main course my boyfriend and I ordered the sausage pizza with a sliced peppers, white sauce and a green veggie that I think was either kale or spinach and we also ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.

Ambiance: Just okay. There isn't anything special about the decor or ambiance.

Service: Our server was nice and friendly. Food came out quickly.

Food: Nothing special....this is where Wolfgang (consistently) falls short.

-- Vegetable Salad - just okay and a bit on the salty side. For $16 they could have at least thrown some avocado in it!
-- Linguini with Shrimp - good flavor, especially the cherry tomatoes, but the shrimp was rubbery. 
-- Chinese Chicken Salad - my cousin seemed to enjoy this, I didn't taste it.

After being told there was an hour wait, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated after only 15 minutes. The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is beautiful. Cocktails are overpriced, but what do you expect in Vegas?

We had the truffle potato chips with blue cheese sauce. It was very rich, unusual, and delicious. If you like blue cheese, I highly recommend trying these.

My husband had the grilled steak skewers as an entree, while I had the organic chicken. The steak was tender, flavored well, and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. The organic chicken was beautiful, not just in presentation but also in terms of taste. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were the perfect match but the crispy, light chicken.

Overall, we had a great experience and I would definitely go back.",CEoMgtYwcskmU6VOeDAwVw,1,1,5,1sxtMd5z_8npVFyi0xkqOw

For the last 10 years, I have shared wonderful delicious meals with both my family and my girlfriend by enjoying the soft tender delicious chicken, the flavorful fettucini alfredo, and of course the crispy, tasty French fries that cannot be overlooked.

When I saw the sign of this restaurant at the early hours of 2AM in Vegas, I at first thought to myself, I must be drunk, this place cannot possibly exist here and be open at this time. Well on this Thursday night/Friday morning at 2AM, Wolfgang Puck was open for business! Me and my girlfriend were quickly seated at one of the tables with a several people around the restaurant enjoying a late snack. Unlike my previous experiences with Wolfgang Puck, this menu they provided was much fancier and lacking my usual orders. Seeing a to the complexity of the menu and not knowing what each selection contained, we played it safe and ordered a regular cheese pizza. Despite my ailing tummy and pulsating, painful headache, I managed to enjoy one slice of pizza. In the moment that I could taste the slice, it provoked thoughts about the good old Wolfgang Puck days in SF. I wish I could have had more pizza, but my body denied it. It was a nice to taste once again was Wolfgang puck meals were like and sad to see how this economic downturn we are still consenting has ruined places such as Wolfgang Puck.

The service was good, the single slice of cheese I had was great, and my hope for a new Wolfgang Puck in SF remains.",JsKX_lPX1IEvL6egQILlAQ,0,0,4,-QX5tmzDkU6mJyrgcsCYFg

The food can be a tad expensive, but its Vegas! Plus, its Wolfgang Puck. Definitely give the pizza choices there a try, as well as their pasta dishes. Think those two were what we loved the most about our experience there. I recommend the Italian Sausage, Crème Fraiche, Mozzarella, Red Onion, Fresno Chilies , Baby Spinach pizza, as well as the Linguine, Steamed Manila Clams, White Wine-Garlic Sauce, Tuscan Olive Oil Pasta. Those two were our favorite dishes. 

Service was a little slow, despite it not being very busy during the time we were eating there, but the food definitely made up for it. Think our first waitress was training someone, and we did trouble our second waitress the next day a bit, so i can't really be mad at them about their service quality.

Multiple times they would come out with food that was ""extra"" and give them to folks at the bar to share.  Nice way to go about sampling and building camaraderie.

My dinner was really good.  Huge braised short rib, cooked perfectly with a nice creme fraiche horseradish sauce.  Underneath was a really good crispy spätzle that added nice texture to the food overall.  I also opted for the roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon confit.  A little too seasoned for my tastes but cooked well and still enjoyable.

The glass of Sangiovese was not great, the cocktails were very good.

Pricing was very reasonable for a casino and named restaurant.  All the food and drink mentioned was around $65 pre tip.  Rare to see a short rib dish around here for $30 norm seems to be around $40

Good meal and service, one note is that they are not owned by MGM so if You're an M Life member you won't get points, but the bartender told me that they will add them at the desk upon presentation of receipt.

Making this review two stars because at least our food was good. The wings were solid - though not the best I had in LV - and the crab cakes were moist. But they were way over priced for the size, which was basically 4 mini bites. Thank goodness there was (hard) bread to eat.

More than 3x did someone come and try to take our plates before we were done. Kristin quickly put down the bill and said, ""There's no rush"" and smiled quickly - but too quick for us to see her scowl.
