2722270,2018-04-30,0,Tl9dhHhmJBl6PGSVk-OpMA,"This may be the BEST McDonalds in NLV, maybe in all of Southern Nevada. The buns are always fresh. The food always is served HOT. It seems like they cook everything to order, not grabbed out of a warming bin. Never skimpy on the sauces. The location is a bit in the hood, but inside it's just about the nicest and cleanest you'll ever find. Seriously, if you craving McD's go the extra mile for this location. I let the only one I'll go to.",2dC0IpwKcKKjYc0Suu7miA,0,0,5,jZBGghAVODOcQC1t2XwIFA

4202851,2012-06-20,0,Tl9dhHhmJBl6PGSVk-OpMA,A great place in the am and mid day.  At night the staff is rude and the place dirty.  It just seems like at night they are more interested in playing then the customer.,UK_1WY6M9cXpEF-O62hlFA,0,0,3,g-tv_IyuGUHvwh9Eo_WVHQ
4739278,2014-07-21,8,Tl9dhHhmJBl6PGSVk-OpMA,"I only come to this location when I go to Nellis AFB and it's never that great. Customer service needs some help, two polite employees does not make up for ten rude ones unfortunately. It's a nightmare going inside and the time it's dirty. I prefer the drive-thru but I can sit there for ever saying hello and no one responds or I'll get a response to wait, not a please at all!!! That makes me kinda angry. I know some would not care but I've worked customer service before and it's not polite when you add a rude tone and attitude on top!!!

I don't make it to breakfast often. It's been a long time since I've ordered an Egg McMuffin, so I indulged. I paid $1.19 drink upgrade for a large orange juice and I got a watered down juice so I went they the drive-thru and the lady was rude like I was the picky customer, I only want what I pay for and a little dash of politeness since they get paid for it!!!",XT06McUUgrEVvkJZyN26WQ,6,5,1,OSj8KRZZ6cb2GSAr3zCEhQ

I'm told that I can only get a refill if I eat in. That's what a did. Unbelievable. What happened McDonald's. Poor Ray. He's turning over again.,K6SwU-RKlxh_n1Sp_Rw77g,0,1,1,ou91Nnwav-UjtKMIEXZBTw
