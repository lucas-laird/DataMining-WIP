Clean casual restaurant, fast service (which is necessary with our young kids) and tasty food!  We liked it so much we ordered catering trays for a birthday party.  My only complaint is that the servings are too small and when my hungry husband comes here, he doesn't get totally full on one dish (and he's not a really relatively big man or eater).  It's our go-to place when we're out and about and want to stop somewhere for a quick lunch or dinner.",aXQg9h6gBQwGacYkuMGIyA,0,1,4,KbH0S9JsJVgVdrHpHnY-hg

It was excellent, especially the dressing.  I took my family there two days later and everything we ordered was delicious.  My wife, who is very critical, loved the clay pot with seafood and tofu.  We decided to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday there a week later. We had 12 people and we enjoyed everything we ordered except for the steamed chicken with rice.

It was pretty good, they separate the meats and veggies from the rice.  I was not used to that.

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, a great place to escape from a chilly evening outside.  Wendy, the owner and an extremely friendly waitstaff Tammy greeted us to a very clean and bright dining area.

We were immediately given hot jasmine tea and a little dish of salted peanuts to warm our cold hands.

Things we ordered:

-Shanghai dumplings: came with a tangy ginger vinegar sauce and had the requisite hot soupy surprise when you bit into the steaming noodle ball.

-E fu noodles with pork and mushrooms: well salted (not overly so) and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  With plenty of sliced pork and shitake mushrooms along with the house chili oil condiment, it was hard to stop eating.

-Won ton noodle soup w/duck: I couldn't decide between the won ton or duck noodle soup so Tammy our cheerful waitress offered to combine the two.  Wow, the broth was amazing like previously mentioned in other reviews and I think they managed to put almost half a duck in the bowl.  I inhaled the al dente egg noodles and then savored the amazing broth.  You can't find a better cold weather dish.

-Hong Kong-style milk tea with red beans: We couldn't resist Tammy's recommendation and weren't disappointed.  Crushed ice, lots of sweet stewed red beans, little cubes of grass jelly surprises and a strong, well-flavored tea was a great ending to the meal.

Tammy was always eager to help without being intrusive.  At the end of the meal, Wendy came by again and thanked us for visiting.  

Bottom line:  Affordable, authentic and bowl-tipping-can't-waste-a-drop delicious.  Comparable in taste to something you'd find in a Hong Kong cafe or Taiwanese night market stall.  Can't wait to stop by again the next time we're in town to try more dishes and say hi to our new friends.  Thank you Yelpers for yet another great find.",SmabICOC4cQaIzy4sQAVXQ,1,0,5,k8bEBqVP9yJfFt0ALIvTAg

The fried rice with the salted fish was excellent. The waitress, seeing I am not at all Asian, asked if I was sure I wanted it with the salted fish. An acquired taste usually common to those who are accustomed to that cuisine. Of course I wanted it! And it made all the difference. I also had the wonton soup. You can actually see the ingredients inside the wonton, and it has big chunks of real shrimp. They also senve French coffee with sweetened condensed milk. I am accustomed to this being called Thai coffee, and it was great. I hate it when places put so much sweetened condensed milk that the sugariness puckers your mouth after the first sip.

Wendy might have snuck in a few addictive ingredients to keep clients like myself and the bf keep coming back for dinner almost every night!!

I happen to like the lo mein as well(add some sriracha for a little kick!) and their assorted mushrooms with bok choy hot pot! The only thing that left us disappointed was the dessert.

This is why:
1) SERVICE (beginning) They forgot 2 of our orders while my 5 other family members are already finishing their dishes up. We mentioned it to one of the guy waiters and he came back to tell us that they were still working on it. They never once apologized on their delay or tell us why it took so long. Oh and did I mention, we saw a couple in front of us requesting to have their orders taken but because they took so long and felt ignored, they straight walked out.
2) FOOD: In one of our Chowfun stirfry, my bf found an old and dried up piece of sharp and thick rice noodle that stabbed him in the mouth. The sharp clear item resembled a fish bone (the length of your thumb!). We also ordered their signature wonton noodle soup and it came with only 1 tiny piece of veggie and the soup was just terribly bland. My sister had to add in so much sauces herself to compensate for her tasteless noodles soup. We also ordered a seafood pan fried noodle, which was suppose to be a crispy dish but was brought to us like a heavily sauce covered noodle soup. The other dishes were nothing memorable either. 
3) SERVICE (towards the end): No service whatsoever! They never came back to us to check on us after they knew they messed up on our orders. When we asked for the check, the same waitress who messed up on our order walked up and loudly said ""Gratuity is already included"" and dropped the bill on the table then to walk away. No ""thank you"" at all and a Mandatory 15% gratuity circled large and clear on the bill? There was no where in the menus that mentioned your mandatory gratuity policy. And a mandatory gratuity for your kind of service? Um, I don't think so.

1. Red Bean Delight: yummy sweet drink with red beans and jelly. Somewhat like che ba mau, but less colorful.
2. Shanghai Dumplings: delicious, hot dumplings that are a little soupy inside.
3. Sweet Potato Fries w/ Black Sesame: cute take on sliced sweet potatoes.
4. Salt & Pepper Calamari: not bad, not exceptional. just fine.
5. Hammered Chicken w/ Rice: the chicken was better than our expectations, but the rice was different (made with tomatoes). It came with steamed vegetables, which were both things we didn't care for.

Overall, the good score comes from the atmosphere + service + Red Bean + Dumplings. Their menu is unique, e.g. spaghetti, and because of the affordable prices, you can try many dishes.",-NIopdD4X-FX7V0ucTg2Vg,2,0,4,y9jv2vSn9QRFNIhvT129Uw

They have so much on the shaved ice such as mango and a great variety of fruits and different toppings. The dessert drinks are also good. Like root beer floats? Like coffee?

When he requested it the gentleman who was serving us reacted as if he did not understand or it was a joke. It took him a while and when he came back with the knife he stared at us as he walked away.

** ONLY EAT HERE IF THIS IS THE LAAAAST PLACE YOU CAN FIND CHINESE FOOOD**

Let me advise you why not to come here:
- first walked in, stood there and waited at the entrance for a good 6-7 minutes for someone to acknowledge my existence although 4 staff members made contact with me as well as it not being busy.

-when my family and I were seated, table next to us had seemingly waited patiently for someone to take their orders. The women and her grandma asked they can please order. The staff members never came around and so they walked out on their table. We were totally shocked.

-Service was worse than most Chinese restaurants which makes me very tolerable to bad service. But, their servers fit in the category of extreme. They give you attitude, they ignore your requests of their service even when you scream out ""hi, excuse me!"" while raising your arm. Worst of all was when everyone finished their food with the first two entrees ordered had been forgotten, the lady denied of with such a strong passion that they didn't forget about the two entrees. Six of us were all finished before the two had even got their food. No apologies, no nothing. 

-then, they asked for the check and they slapped it on the table while saying, ""gratuity is included"". No thank you, no smile, not even a slight glance before walking away. We reread the menu to double check if they ever mentioned a gratuity policy with a certain number of people. Nope! None.


-MOST IMPORTANTLY...THEIR FOOD. The Sui kaow wonton egg noodle soup was mediocre. It had only 1 choy with 5 pieces and was very small. Looked like something you can make at home. Not worth it. Seafood pan friend noodles had too much gravy which made the noodles very soggy. The egg drop beef over rice was horrible. It literally looked like a plate of rice, 7-10 small chunks of beef with scrambled egg then clear gravy poured right on top with it the whole dish being very bland. Our XO chow fun was super bland but overly covered in chilli flakes. Worst of all was finding a dried clump of vermicelli that had chili on it randomly on one of our entrees that had no no vermicelli. It means they're dirty because it was right on top when they placed the entree down.

This is not the place to go if you want a good meal and experience with very valuable family time. They wasted our time.",MmsY8RFfdVJf7FmJ9uzoYg,8,1,1,kgu01tXszHPvRTAJD7gIjg

Wendy's has potential- they really do. However: 

1. $7.50 for a greasy plate of ginger chunks, rice, and egg is too much. Yelp advertises this as $ but it's really $$. We spent close to $40 for two of us. 

2. Entrees came out way before the appetizer. 

3. The server was either A. Having a bad day or B. Really bad at her job.  She didn't come by once to see how our meal was, we had to flag her down to pay, and her attitude towards us was less than desirable. 

On a good note: 

1. The soups looked great and my handsome date loved it.

Wendy's Noodle Cafe has just become my favorite place called ""Wendys.""  Sorry other Wendys; even though you're the spicy chicken mecca, I've found another.

Everything we ordered was spectacular, and the friendly service sealed the deal, Wendy's is fantastic.  

Our Order:

Pot Stickers - Perfect crisp on the dumpling and delicious pork/scallion stuffing.  Best Potsticker I've had in Las Vegas.


Beef Short Ribs - Wendy's take on Kalbi - The beef had a nice sear on it while not being dry.  Not as good as Kalbi at many Korean spots, but still a very good appetizer.

Shredded Chicken w/ Vermicelli (noodle soup) - DELICIOUS combination of cilantro, kaffir Lime, and Chili.  This satisfying yet light soup is like your mom's chicken noodle soup with a passport. 

Malaysian Fried Rice - Served with chicken wings and squid balls.  The rice was really nice, tasting of subtle garlic, onion, turmeric, and lime.  It was moist without being mushy, and very wholesome.  The chicken wings were good not great, and the squid balls were forgettable.  The rice itself is a definite order though.

We were excited to get the tea that they automatically brought to us last time, but instead we were served some ice water on a cold windy day. We looked around and all other tables had tea, so my boyfriend asked for some tea for us and the lady waitress rolled her eyes at him!! So weird. Anyway, we got the spicy wings , they were BOMB! Best wings ever. I got the shanghai dumplings and I love them, my boyfriend had mixed feelings about the juices inside the dumpling. We also got the fried rice and singapore noodles. The rice was delicious and had a good amount of shrimp in it. The noodles had a nice spice in them, but were tiny bit salty. I would ask for a fried egg on top next time too. 

We ordered the mung bean, red bean, jelly and coconut milk drink for desert, it was amazing!

The salt and pepper shrimp appetizer was inedible: all of the shell was left on underneath the crispy fried coating.

The potstickers and the beef chow fun lacked any flavor whatsoever.

Give her 15 mins. Shortly after, she came back with a beautiful fruit  tart. I paid $32+ for the tart and left. It turns out the tart was just fruit and whipped cream. It did not have the delicious custard base that came with the previous order. The tart was hardly eaten. I called and spoke with the owner after the birthday dinner. She actually outright lied that the tarts from her restaurant are not made with the egg custard base. I searched through the pictures on Yelp and  lo and behold, the tarts do have the yellowish egg custard. How can you make custard in 10 mins and let it cool to use as a base for the tart? Well you can't. So instead of doing the honorable thing by apologizing and telling me I have to come back  later, she went out and fill the tart with whipped cream and decorated with fruits and send me on my way.

Chicken congee: (4 stars) 
fairly thick congee with chicken. Consistency of the congee was good and it was garnished with green onion and ginger. 

Chinese donut (3.5 stars)
donut was crunchy but kind of thin. price was ok but used to more in china town for just about the same cost. Still not bad flavor wise.

BBQ pork wonton egg noodle: (4.5 stars)
BBQ pork could have been better but the noodles were fantastic. The broth was clear and typical of what you would expect for this dish. This place isn't know for their chinese meat delicacy so not a 5 but not bad either. Noodles were springy and chewy, cooked just the right amount of time.

1361071,2011-05-12,0,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"This place is outstanding.  A perfect example of what every city and town in the US needs.  A perfect example of what great Chinese food can taste like and priced right.  So simple and easy and yet most Chinese restaurants that dot the US are those terrible, terrible all-you-can-eat buffets.

My friends and I ate here our 1st night in Vegas.  We started with the sweet potato fries appetizer.  Not very impressive, a 2.  Definitely would not order this again.  An ominous beginning.  But our entrees!

We got the assorted meat and shrimp with rice noodles, ginger and egg fried rice, a porridge dish (I forget which one) and the shredded chicken with rice noodles.

They were all really excellent.  James ordered just the rice.  The rice was extremely well balanced between the egg and the ginger.  I was really amazed.  It wasn't overpowering in ginger, had just the right amount.  I recommended to James to order the eggplant dish to compliment the rice.  I think with any kind of meat dish the meat would have overpowered the ginger.  The eggplant hit it dead on-he absolutely agreed with my decision after combining the two.

My dish was the meat and shrimp rice noodle dish.  It was an extremely well balanced bowl of taste.  Again, I was really amazed.  It's difficult to mix all that in and balance it.  I could taste everything and the broth is light and not heavy in any way.

Art had the chicken and noodle dish and that's not even his thing.  He prefers rice dishes but thought it was excellent.

John got the porridge and gave me a sip.  It's got fish sauce already mixed in it so it's got a lot of flavor in addition to the other ingredients they added to it.  I was really impressed.  It's kinda hard to make a great tasting rice porridge bowl when by definition this is not the tastiest food.

So overall we were really impressed with the place.  An absolute solid 4 rating.  Again, this is the type of Chinese restaurant I wished existed everywhere in the States so that people would really understand how excellent Chinese food can be.

And the last thing about this place?  Totally affordable.  Each plate is about $7-8.  Ridiculous.  If I lived here in Vegas I think I'd almost come here every week.",np_PA4ejejVhk4klYvnMDA,0,0,4,6sfnvpeqKuub2UokntO6XA

They start you off with peanuts and hot jasmine tea.  Hmm odd combo but I enjoyed.

So on our first visit, we ordered (per recommendations off yelp): 

Grilled chicken wings- pretty good. Nice presentation too with lemongrass on top.

Beef cubes in blackpepper sauce -decent, good flavor, steak was not overcooked (better at Pho Kim though), 

Seafood & pork  noodle soup (26) - a bit bland, but after adding a smudge of hoisen and chilli oil and paste it was better.  Eating fish cake and fish ball is always a mystery cause you don't exactly know how it's made but I fairly enjoy it.  It also had pieces of squid, shrimp, and pork. 

 Wonton with egg noodle soup (47i think). -far tastier.  The egg noodles were perfect with scrumptious pieces of wonton.  The casing was soft and delicate, the inside was meaty and flavorful. 

Mango Crepe - Mango was sweet topped with hWhipped cream and wrapped in a crepe.  Pretty good but nothing crazy ah-mazing.
(""why are you putting so much emphasis on the H?'' 'say cool whip""..""cool hwip"" -brian & Stewie)

The staff was friendly and quick. We had at least 3 people stop by and ask if everything was okay throughout the meal. Great Team work Wendy's noodle cafe!   We told the lady we enjoyed and asked if she was Wendy. She sadly said know but she was happy with enjoyed the food.

I have never been to a place that has actually gotten the perfect spice level/flavor to get my taste buds dancing the Jed Clampett!
It happened the other night at Wendy's Noodle Cafe.

We started off the night greeted by the lovely staff and were sat down as a party of two at a four top at the far wall. Then quickly after we were given hot tea :) yummmmm :) it's chilly now so they read my mind!

Taking one glance at the menu WOW! A huge menu!

We started the dinner with veggie spring rolls...one bite and hubby said ""yummm these are the BEST I have ever had!"" wow they were good. Crisp and flaky on the outside and soft and tender wow, on the inside. What is that on the inside? I swear it was a little white cheese? on the inside with the veggies? hmmmm... anyway it is served with a standard sweet chili sauce on the side.

Hubby ordered hammered chicken with rice and chicken chow fun with gravy. I don't eat chicken (that often) but I tried the noodle part of the chow fun and it was REALLY good. Light gravy sauce yummmmm. I will def have to order veggie next time :) And I also taste the rice and a green bean off his hammered chicken dish. YUM! The green beans were fresh,wok tossed and crisp sprinkled with sesame seeds. The rice was a red/orange color and I saw a small grilled onion in it. It taste like maybe a saffron or paprika. I know those two flavors are totally different but it was really tasty but I had eaten a lot of my (spicy) dish when I sampled it.

I ordered the spicy seafood udon soup. OMMMMGGGGG it was delish. The whitefish, the shrimp, the squid, udon allllllll cooked to perfection. HUGE amount of seafood in the bowl and lots of udon. Tender and long. I slurped and slurped on that soup like it was the last meal on Earth. Tools of a fork, soup spoon, chopsticks and tons of napkins, I had the broth all over the place. I have never in my life had someone spice my dish that perfect. I like it ""on the edge of no turning back"". It was spicy yet not uncomfortable. Flavored yet not too spicy...but still very spicy. 
AMAZING. I was floored how the broth was a bright red orange color of all the spicy as soon as it got to the table. It was the same color I always turn my soup when I season it myself! It's always soooo embarrassing to add THAT MUCH additives to a soup. I always feel bad about it :D like it's an insult or something :D Not here. Wendy or the chef already did it for me :)

Even though we were BEYOND stuffed and did not even finish our plates...I knew I had to have the warm, sesame mochi in my mouth...and I was again...not disappointed. They let us know it takes about 4-5 to make them...YUM even better :D
The homemade, warm, black filled sesame goodness, with a little caramel and crushed salted peanuts on top.....WAS TO DIE FOR...they were perfect...I wished I had ordered coffee to go with them but it was later so I did not want to stay up all night.

The moral of this review is...I want to go here again...and soon. I'm still kicking myself in the butt for not going to Christina W.'s UYE :( ugh!

The menu is soo big it almost was a turn off and I worried about the freshness and quality that usually comes with a huge menu like hers...nope. PS I have a MSG built in sensor (aka I get an intense migraine instantly). NONE in the food I taste/ate. NOT here.

As I was leaving I saw a green wrap/crepe looking thing in a desert case she has by the door...DURIAN WRAP...ummm I need it in my mouth!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,3,4,5,kDiHyEMb4dH7EkfpaHa3fQ

We started with potstickers, and I had the wonton noodle soup and my friend had the shredded chicken with rice noodle soup. Then we both washed it all down with $5.00 honey lemon tea. 

I personally enjoyed the wonton noodle soup - but I did eat 1 wonton and it had a bone in it...awkward. Also, it's hard to mess up wonton noodle soup. Either way, pretty legit. I just had a little taste of my friend's soup and I thought it was good, but she's a harsher critic so she just said it was okay. I'm sure she would've given this restaurant 3 stars so we can average it out to a solid 3.5 stars.

Food: NASTY! I ordered a ""hammered chicken something"" with pasta. The chicken composed of three equally thick ( to be correct I mean thin) layers, batter meat batter. And the meat tasted like pork. The pasta was just plain, no sauce. And when I asked for sauce, the lady told me that they didn't have sauce?!! Ridiculous! My boyfriend ordered a noodle dish, and it just looked and tasted like it was microwaved! It wasn't even steamy!

Drink: We ordered a red bean slush, and it did taste pretty good, but from the texture you can tell that it was pre-made and sat in the fridge. Again NASTY!

Service: Horrible! I think they thought we were just poor kids, very other table had a peanut dish started (not those you order, it's the tiny starter dishes) and they didn't even ask us if we wanted one. I speak Chinese not Cantonese, and after I ordered in Chinese, the lady started talking to me in Cantonese, which I could not understand! I told her that I don't speak Cantonese, but she just kept on going....

Overall: I will not go back to that place every again!",sce9H82Hm6xxxjPHBhGUwg,2,1,1,IEMjy4_paNwtWomKcBr3-w

I've been here a few times. A couple times for dinner, and a couple times just for dessert.

Everything is fantastic. Try the fried chicken wings, the smashed chicken and any of their soups. All are delicious and amazing. For dessert, the lychee ice cream with mochi is nice. Also the shaved ice is fantastic.

The menu is mostly Hong Kong style with a few variations. Everything is prepared fresh, and if you want something that isn't on the menu, just ask for Wendy, the owner. She is super nice and friendly.

I really do love this place and would recommend it to anyone looking for chinese food.

The prices are VERY reasonable, the portion sizes are perfect (not too little and not so much that you will overeat yourself into obesity).",Wi0VgIrbb8vqU6weyVw6tg,3,3,5,91TKrzQLZVzXSYbrmsoRJA

- Mushroom Noodles
- Wonton Noodles
- Grilled Chicken Wings
- XO Four Season Beans
- Assorted Vegetable Chow Fun
- Chiu Chow Style Rice Cakes

I saw good reviews and decided to give it a try. We walked in and only saw a few customers besides a large party of probably about 15-20 people. They did not get their food yet which kind of worried me because they would have to cook for that table first. 

We had a seat and I found the waitresses to be very attentive constantly coming around for water and ask if we are ok. That I appreciated. I did find something strange-I had to ask for tea when it seemed other tables had it, but we were never offered. Once I asked, I got it. Kind of made me wonder why we were not offered tea like the other customers. 

A waitress came up to us and seemed to be in a rush when I was not ready to order. We got assorted seafood chow mein cooked crispy style and seafood soup. When the soup came out (which took a very long time by the way), it was duck soup. What?? =( I don't like duck! Not only do I not like duck, but I dont' like duck bones. This duck had no meat, it was mainly bones! Yuck. I told the waitress and she brought over the bill and showed us some Chinese writing and repeated ""duck soup"" and I repeated ""No, I ordered seafood soup."" She seemed like it was a major hassle to take it back. She did apologize but walked away. When she returned I still was not happy and mentioned something again. She said something about taking it back but it did not make me feel comfortable enough to send it back. So I let it be and ate since I was hungry. 

The chow mein was good. The soup was decent but of course that is basing it on simply the broth and noodles. I did not want to take off too many stars because I see this restaurant as having potential if we ordered the right thing. My review would have been 2 stars but the owner Wendy came by and was very nice. I told her what happened. She did not take it off our bill but she did offer dessert for free.

FOOD:
Chow Fun with XO Sauce (3 stars): Okay, thought it would be better. Not as much flavor as I hoped for. 

Udon Seafood with XO Sauce (4 stars): I love udon. I thought I would like the chow fun more because it looked better, but this had more flavor. 

Duck and Egg Noodle Soup (2.5 stars): Wasn't a big fan of this soup. I didn't like the broth. 

String beans with XO sauce (3.5 stars): Had to have some veggies. But again not much flavor with the sauce. 

Shanghai Dumplings (4 stars): These were good. Love how you get soupy broth in the inside, be careful not the break it when you scoop it up. 

Anyways, I don't have that much background in authentic Chinese food, but my friend does, and she thought it was just okay also. 

Service (5 stars):
The ladies were really nice and on top of our requests. One specifically looked at me, the least Asian in the group, to see if I needed a fork instead of chopsticks. Pretty funny, but I can use chopsticks just fine (=

Atmosphere:
Medium sized restaurant. Very clean. If you come with a group they have round tables with the Lazy Susan's to make it easy to share. 

Parking:

their food is above average, and the portions are well enough. every dish ive tried there so far ive really enjoyed.

only downside to this place is they have a minimum of $15 for you to use your card. however its better than most asian restaurants that are cash only, so i cant complain too much.

1861705,2015-08-16,3,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"Food here is reasonably priced and generally either a hit or miss in terms of taste. They do have some really good dishes here if you know what to order. Service is also a hit or miss, sometimes super friendly and sometimes standoffish or awkward. If I were to rename it, I'd call it Wendy's Bipolar Noodle Cafe. I really want to give it 4 stars but due to the all around inconsistency of everything, I'm going with the middle A-OK 3 star rating. 

The Seafood chow fun- delicious. I love the flavor, the sauce, and the texture of the noodles. I can probably finish the whole plate by myself if I tried. 

Rib eye bao burgers- Dish comes with 3 and includes a small salad. The ""bao"" reminds me of the dish with peking duck. Instead of duck, you get rib eye. Unfortunately, this one is a miss for me even though there are raving reviews for it. It is incredibly greasy and rather mediocre. 

Beef cubes with rice cakes and ramen- This one is decent, although I had higher expectations. The beef cubes can get a bit chewy. I love rice cakes so you can't go wrong with that. Ramen was okay although I'm generally not a big fan of ramen. 

Seafood with rice noodles- I thought that was pretty good. The rice noodles are delicious. Seafood is okay. Soup is quite tasty.

The waitresses were sweet, wonderful and hard working, the owner is also wonderful and keeps an eagle eye out on everything going on. The food came very quick and hot. Shrimp Chow Fun was very good, just ever so slightly bland, the eight decent sized shrimp cooked just enough.

Granted I've been in a HK Café deprived area (UCI campus), the food here is pretty kick ass. The restaurant is in kind of a marketplace and has plenty of parking when I went. It kind of smelled like Boiling Crab, but then Cravin' Cajun is right across the street. As we walked in, I noticed that the whole restaurant was really nice, from décor, to cleanliness, to ambiance and we were welcomed quickly and shown to our table.

I'm guessing it's more of a family owned restaurant, the people who looked like owners had a table towards the counter and was always discussing something with the waitresses. Regardless the waiter and waitresses were always a willing to accommodate requests and one of the waitresses ALWAYS refilled my water. I don't know if I have noted this before but I always down water like a water buffalo and I swear she refilled it every time it got close to low. 

Above and beyond? Fasho, especially for a Chinese restaurant. 

I have most definitely noted this before in other reviews, but I hate rating places based on service, but service is outstanding, so had to point it out.

We ordered:

Salty Fish with Chicken fried Rice
Shredded Chicken with Rice Noodles
Chef's Special Fried Chicken Wings
Seafood and Rice Soup
Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce

I'm not entirely sure why my friends and I (3 of us) ordered so much food but we were so full afterwards, the portions are generous and made spectacularly. I was skeptical of the Seafood and rice soup since it wasn't the porridge, just rice and seafood in soup but it was pretty good, salted well and they weren't cheap with the seafood either. The chicken wings were so crispy and delicious, and actually had a bit of salt and pepper kick to it. Not too spicy though, my friend who doesn't eat spicy at all ( like literally none) handled it pretty well.

The Chinese broccoli wasn't boiled to death, and they didn't use crap chicken with the shredded chicken with rice noodles. Not something I'd exactly order again since I can go to an actual chicken noodle place to get it but it was not bad, noodles were soft and not broken either. Oh the Salty Fish with Chicken Fried rice was kick ass too. It wasn't extremely salty fish and it was cooked and seasoned pretty well. Might make yo breath stank, but hey, quality over almost everything else.

Went here with a buddy for a late night snack. Kinda nice they open till 11pm. We were seated very quickly and given glasses of warm tea along with a small tray of peanuts. Where else do they give you a tray of peanuts in vegas?

Oyster Omelet 
Quite nice actually, not greasy, the cilantro help to give a brightness to it, pickled chinese radish gave a crunchy texture as well as a bit of sourness that matches well. Oysters were minced into smaller pieces but distributed fairly evenly.

Mango Slush
VERY nice. Had a natural sweetness to it, the tapioca used wasn't the large black types commonly sold overpriced in pearl tea shops they were the small dessert ones which was nice and complimented the drink. Topping the drink was shaved ice with some coconut cream and chunks of mango.

Free Soup
We were given a beef and lotus broth. Very natural tasting. Like something you make at home for your family.

Third time we went here: SHANGHAI DUMPLINGS (appetizer) is awesome! Reminds us of the Xiao Lang Bao in Dumpling House in San Diego. GRILLED BEEF RIBS (tapas) is regular Galbi/Kalbi, and was alright. SKEWERS WITH CURRY SAUCE (tapas) is really good, especially with the curry sauce. PEPPER GLAZED RIBS CLAY POT is delicious!!!! RADISH AND CHINESE SAUSAGE FRIED RICE is just okay.

Found this place on yelp and decided to try it - hoping that it's better than KJ Kitchen - cause that place got four stars but it was definitely not four stars for me. Luckily this was a hit!

There were only a few tables of diners when we got there (8:45pm) but then it got busier as it got later. So we each ordered different dishes:

I got Black Pepper Ox Tongue Spaghetti: the ox tongue was super tender and soft and instead of putting the black pepper sauce on the ox tongue, they used it as a spaghetti sauce which was really tasty and different. thumbs up!

My dad got the Sampan Porridge: the porridge was cooked to the right texture - not too thin and not too thick. Seem like my dad really liked it. 

My mom got some kind of noodles but for some reason I can't recall which one....so can't tell you how it was but I'm pretty sure it was good too.

The service was great - the waitress was nice and patient when we took a while to order - even suggested dishes to us. The dishes weren't expensive - average and reasonable prices for pretty good portions.

It's as if I'm back home when I'm eating here. Basically, they have a huge variety of hong kong style cuisine to choose from, along with a decent handful of dessert options. I really like the variety here more than anything else.

If you are family-styling a meal here, I would get the pan fried rice cake with soy sauce and egg as one of your dishes, as it's a great appetizer to share.

Portuguese Curry Baked with Pork $8.50

The wontons were juicy, plumb, just the right amount of pork to shrimp. The noodles were perfectly al dente. The broth was tasty. All in all it was satisfying and delish.

We also had yang chow fried rice and it was done right. Great 'wok hay' and filled with bits of BBQ pork and shrimp.

The porridge/congee/jook was the perfect consistency. The rice was broken down and smooth. This was jook done right.

A warm atmosphere, prompt and friendly service, very reasonable prices, and a pleasantly varied menu of delicious foods makes this restaurant one of my favorites.

After a long chilly day of holiday shopping we stopped by for dinner. We ordered a pork, salty fish and salty egg hot pot to warm ourselves up.

I was there with my family, and they give out complimentary peanuts to the tables to munch on while waiting for their food. We had a party of 9, and they only gave us one small dish. We asked for another and the server said we need to charge for an extra dish (keep in mind parties of 2 next to us were able to get the same sized dish we had). Then she goes to the back and brings an extra dish out saying, ""nevermind, here's another one 'FREE OF CHARGE'""... It seemed from there she was already annoyed at us?

Anyway, I had the wonton noodle soup. Simple enough, right? Wrong! The broth and noodles were nothing special, just what you'd expect. It came one one piece of vegetable. I mean come on, it's not too expensive to toss in another piece or two, right? But my real complaint comes with the wontons. They tasted like they have been sitting there for at least a week in the fridge and the meat has started to go bad. I couldn't even finish my first one.

Then we had a rice dish served in a clay pot. This is where the server brings it out, mixes it for you, and then serves it to you in bowls. Upon first bite, my aunt found a strand of white hair and we immediately notified the waitress. From then on, the service dropped significantly. She did the routine ""did you want to change the dish to something else?"" in which we decided to change to a fried rice dish (which was fine, no complaints there). Later on, she came back and said, with a bad attitude, ""That wasn't hair, it was a piece of glass noodle,"" and just stomped off.  First of all, our family works in the food industry. We can DEFINITELY tell what is hair and what is 'glass noodle'. She never apologized for her attitude, nor the fact that there was hair in our food.

When we received our bill, they charged us for the fried rice, AND the rice dish in the clay pot, in which we refuted because we only took one bite out of it and returned it. We will gladly pay for the fried rice dish, but definitely not the clay pot dish.  We had to get the manager/owner? over to get everything sorted out. At least she was helpful and apologized for her server's behavior (hence the extra star). I've never had such a poor experience with this place. Probably won't be back again.

(on a side note, all of our other dishes we ordered were of edible quality. We had udon noodles with xo sauce, fried chicken wings, chow fun, etc. Not the best, but at least it was edible.)",RoDHuFS54UO8uw8Xw9Wk3Q,4,1,2,zcDn_bVY-udiysvZRte71A

Ok, time to talk about the food. First thing I liked about this place is that they their lunch includes Chinese soup that actually have pretty solid flavor and a good amount of meat and Chinese veggies in it. So it's not just watered down, flavorless soup that you usually get as a starter. 

The Stir Fried Udon and Seafood with XO Sauce was surprisingly delicious. The noodles were chewy and coated with XO sauce. The seafood included plentiful fish, shrimp, and squid. Plus for 7.95, you get enough food for two meals!

My aunt and uncle got rice plates that were tasty and huge in portions as well. We ended not finishing any of our entrees due to the sheer amount of food they give you and had tons of take-out for the next day.

We were seated and we ordered the most popular things according to the yelp reviews-- including the steak cubes with ramen noodles! For some reason, this always looked intriguing and when it finally arrived at our table I was rather disappointed. It wasn't horrible, but it definitely wasn't deserving of all the raving yelp reviews! We also ordered the chicken wings and they were okay. Also had some beef noodle soup thing (can't remember the name) and that was just okay. When ordering I asked the server what the difference in noodles were and she just said they were noodles-- uhhh okay. I know I'm asian and I should know my asian food, but I am not a noodle expert. The soup was decent. I mean, its soup. How can you go wrong with soup? 

Overall, dinner was just okay. We waited a long time for the server to come back to the table to take our order and to bring us the check-- it was one of those dinners that lasted for like 2 hours for no reason. Meh.",q93KSB8PtxchdgcY17bH8Q,9,7,2,GayBDGkJQpdzCTsvFWoUkw

SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and tasty. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff. 

The things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.

The menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu. 

Service was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait.

It's probably the most tender BBQ pork I've had since most other places seem to overcook it or leave it sitting too long. I even like that they drizzled sauce on the meat/rice as well. There was a decent crowd while I was there, but it never got crowded inside.

WHERE'S THE SALT?!

Seriously, my taste buds is a bit on the lighter side when it comes to salt but this dish was bland! I have never went to a Chinese restaurant where I had to ADD salt into my food.

We ordered the chicken and thousand year old egg congee, singapore noodles, and a Chinese Tteokbokki dish with ramen and steak. All were delicious in my opinion and listed from my most favorite to least. The congee hit the spot for me. It reminded me of the congee my mother would make for me when I was sick at home. It was flavorful, light, and brought back childhood memories. Unlike most restaurants, the congee tasted perfect without having to dumb half a bottle of soy sauce into it! Next, the singapore noodles tasted rather spicy. I'm not sure if it was the overload of pepper or curry, but it was nonetheless very tasty--I definitely recommend. Lastly, the Tteokbokki dish was just mediocre. The dish was more sweet than savory. The prices are pretty affordable and I can't wait to come back here to try all the other dishes on their menu.

2630836,2011-01-27,0,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"OVERALL PROS:
- Incredibly authentic Chinese food.
- Very friendly service (though my mom is way too extroverted and will just make friend with anyone).
- Great dessert menu - reminded me of all those wonderful dessert spots in China I miss so much (lots of black rice, shaved ice, custards, etc).
- MUST-HAVES: Ribeye noodle soup, Stir-fried beef, Seafood & tofu claypot.
- Very, very affordable. Even for dinner, most items on the menuwere under $10.

OVERALL CONS:
- The plaza Wendy's is located in is not the best or the most lively, but at least Wendy's has its own standalone building in the lot and it's very nice & casual.
- We got a HK style mango crepe to go - it's nice they have that option. But they basically took one of the stale ones that's been sitting in their to-go display case up front because it's already boxed. It did not taste good.

WHAT WE ORDERED:
* Sliced Ribeye Noodle Soup (rice noodles) - So good! The noodles were soft (we could tell it wasn't made in-house though), beef was delicious, you can add bean sprouts and lime. The broth was a tiny tiny bit light on flavor, but my mom (the expert, of course) said it was perfect.

* Flaming Hot Stir-Fried Beef - Came out hot & sizzling, tons of flavor & spice, very well done. Bravo.

* Seafood & Tofu Claypot - I loved this dish. The tofu was cooked with a layer of fried skin and there was tons of delicious seafood. I just wish there were some peas - I've had it w/ peas at other restaurants and it adds a perfect bit of sweetness.

* Hong Kong Style Mango Crepe - Like I said, we got a pre-boxed one that'd been sitting in their display case. It was a stale crepe with whipped cream and canned, flavorless mango. Not worth it. (but I must say we got this because of the to-go option. I wanted the shaved ice and it looked awesome when the table next to us got it)",eIa4QJXp5ZNmuFORnuPvDA,1,1,4,Y9LOEnvfQkYaNggX_Z2QXg

We had the:
1. Chicken wings: 6 wings that were favored pretty well. Size was pretty small compared to other wing places.
2. House chow mein: Pretty small for the price and didn't have too much taste.
3. Pan fried rice cake with egg: An extra $1 for a cracked egg on top. The egg on top was worth the extra $1. This was the best dish we had here. It was something different and had good taste.
4. Shrimp chow fun: Pretty small but tasted pretty good.

The four of us were still a bit hungry afterwards and the bill was a bit pricey for what we ate. We didn't want to get the dessert and preferred to go elsewhere. They has shaved ice, but after seeing their dishes we didn't want to take a chance.The workers were friendly but a bit clumsy. All in all, I don't see myself going off the strip to this place again.

The seafood was all tender and well seasoned, the noodles were perfect and had just enough bite to them.  I'm not sure if they make their noodles in house or not but they are really good.

They have all kinds of other random stuff too like sweet potato fries and popcorn chicken but it is kinda cool because they are a little more creative than traditional places.

My very picky eater Mom came along (yay!) and thoroughly enjoyed the chicken, fried rice and even tried lotus root (""tastes like water chestnut"" hmm not, but maybe texture)

With 20+ of us sharing two large tables and copious amounts of food, it would have been a perfect evening. Christina asked that we bring an unwrapped toy, baby items or canned goods for HELP of SN and it looks like Yelpers Helped yet again with many donations. But, Arvin C & his Dad & the incredibly adorable Kirstie M and her Dad sang, played guitar and keyboards and entertained with a variety of music throughout the evening. The highlight for me & Mom was when Bobby Y sat in and played his unique, mind bending rock violin...jaws dropped to the floor (my Mom is STILL telling everyone she talks to about ""this young man who played the violin like I've never heard before"") Mom enjoyed a rare night out and putting faces to names. Christina, Kirstie & I chatted and got teary eyed as Arv belted out some soulful stuff. 

My favorite dish of the evening was definitely steamed fish with tofu = simple and perfect. Second: the squid, a little kick to it and not a hint of grease though it was deep fried. The presentation of the yummy pineapple fried rice - in a pineapple was super and the taste was light and memorable. 

Will definitely return to try other dishes, Wendy and her team were welcoming and very attentive and the free standing spot (right under 168 Plaza sign: yes, we got lost :) is quite airy and inviting. 

Thanks to Christina for setting this up and the Yelperazzi for making my Mom feel so welcome (especially Jin aka ""the tall, very handsome one who remembered my name"" per Mom :)) Extra thanks to Jade W for commemorating the chicken head that kept ending up staring at me from the lazy Susan all night!!!

2662787,2014-07-24,11,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"This might be news to you, but I'm asian and eating fried rice sounds boring to me. I mean, I grew up on the stuff, so I can easily whip it up at home (with my eyes closed). Well, get this, my boyfriend and I decided to go out on a limb and try Wendy's ingenious Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice ($10.95). Holy freaking amazeballs #%^*!! It was incredible!

Seriously. Close your eyes and imagine this: Lemongrass+tender seafood+sweet+sour+spicy+comfort+warmth+dancing taste buds. 

Ok, now, what did you imagine? Tom Yum soup right? Right! That's what this fried rice is all about. They added a whole bunch of seafood (squid, shrimp, white fish) and they were all cooked flawlessly - moist, tender, juicy and seasoned well! They even had crispy charred bits that popped in my mouth and added explosive flavor. Also, the rice was moist and had incredible lemongrass flavor; the spices were all very flavorful. There was a raging party in my mouf! I need to thank Wendy for reawakening my love for what I thought was boring fried rice, I will forever be grateful.

The other dishes we ordered were also tasty:
- House Special Chow Mein (Crispy Noodles) with tender beef and veggies ($7.99) - Huge portion and very flavorful gravy sauce. Let's be real, the gravy sauce makes or breaks the dish, well, they seasoned it amazing here. They packed it with a lot of noodles and beef. Not too many veggies, but that's ok with us!

- Rib Eye and white shimeji roll (from the tapas menu) (about $4)- So simple, but it really surprised us. The ribeye was juicy, tender and the flavor of the meat shined! The buttery mushrooms were cooked perfectly and had a lovely buttery bite.

- Rib Eye bao burger ($9.99) - Great rib eye flavor, super fluffy and soft bao buns, and comes with a side of tangy fresh salad that tastes great when you stuff it into the bao burgers! Also try dipping it in Hoisen plum sauce for extra flavor!

- Pepper glazed spare ribs clay pot ($9.99) - this dish is a classic! It really brings me back to my childhood (Vietnamese has a same dish called ""thit kho to"" - It comes out bubbling hot and served with white rice (check out my video!) It's an explosion of sweet and salty flavor. (Note: they have lots of small bones attached, so be extra cautious when chewing/swallowing) 

- Spicy steak cubes and rice cake with ramen ($8.99) - I typically don't like rice cakes because they are too plain, filling, and bland, but my boyfriend loves them. They were cut into smaller pieces and not too chewy (that's a good thing.) The sauce was deliciously sweet, not to spicy at all in our opinion (we eat chili peppers for breakfast!) and the beef was very tender. My biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough sauce. :/

- Mung Bean, Red Bean, Jelly, Coconut Milk and crushed ice drink! ($3.99) - Yessss!!! This dessert drink was the perfect ending to our meal. I really enjoyed the mung bean, red bean, and jelly bits and texture while slurping them up with the wide boba straw. Sweet, refreshing, and cheap!

Wendy has great prices! I mean, the house special chow mein noodles is cheap! For $7.99, the amount of noodles and beef they gave us was enough for 2 starving adults to get their fill. And $4 for a icy delicious dessert drink is a nice price point if you ask me. My wallet thinks so...",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,13,9,5,8zUeA8W6miGIhX-DwyX54w

The restaurant is super CLEAN.  I can't get over how clean the place was.. everything from the plates and spoons to tables and chairs.  The wait staff was very friendly and menus were nice and easy to read in English with photos. 

As for the food, my table got:

Wonton Noodle Soup - Really high quality and top notch.  No ""mystery"" ingredients in the wonton like some places.  Broth and noodles were fantastic too.  Some of the best I've had. 

Beef Chow Foon - The best beef chow foon I've ever had.  Beef chow foon has to be somewhat greasy to be good and this place got it perfect.  Just the right amount of grease (not too much like a lot of places do which makes everything brown and soggy).  Ingredients again were really high quality and the noodles were the perfect size/width. 

Shanghai Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) - Really good.  Not as good as the ones I've had over in Asia but still very tasty.

Dessert - Don't remember what it was called on the menu (you'll see it in the big picture on the menu) but it was a bowl of dessert tofu, sweet red beans, black jelly, tapioca with coconut milk, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I love all those things separately.. served together it was amazing!  Definitely try it if you like that type of dessert. 

Overall, I'd highly recommend giving this place a try if you're in Vegas.  The food was high quality and super affordable (like $7-8 a dish).  It's a great value and I'd easily be here once a week if I lived in Vegas!",5DQlx35Ak-xoFi8gfDua8w,0,0,5,lmH-6K7F9nKfOC5PRGbR1A

The front of the house is a different story. They have serious service problems. I know Asian restaurants are notorious for lousy service, but I refuse to give them a pass just because they're Chinese. I went there on a slow weekday afternoon, and I was one of four other tables. There was no one to greet me and show me to a table so I just wandered in. It took a few minutes for the servers to realize I was even sitting there. I observed another couple who also seated themselves and had to get their own menus and napkins. The servers seemed distracted and disorganized (or just plain incompetent) and didn't show any warmth or friendliness towards me. And there was a busboy who wandered about aimlessly, dripping a trail of dirty water behind him. I assume he didn't speak English because he didn't respond to any questions or requests, either from me or the people seated next to me. Needless to say, I didn't leave a tip and I doubt I'll be back.

Here's an idea. Only hire experienced servers who speak fluent English, understand proper etiquette and genuinely care about the dining experience. Take a lesson from the Strip, good food does not make up for lousy service. Unless you just want to be a carry-out place, put as much, if not more, effort into the front of the house as you do the back.",bkJRLZ9yANhJI6iRU3k4VQ,0,0,3,J414udHBVGfbP5gz2L8w8w

The waiters brought out the red bean drinks so late. We were pretty much done eating by the time we got our drinks!

The spicy seafood udon was unbelievably bland. The porridge was untraditional, lacking certain ingredients.

Absolutely horrible, steak was so gamy I barely eat it, the rice cake in it supposed to be soft but because they use the solid rice cake roll so it makes it so chewy, sauce they use was not helping at all.

-Salt and pepper tofu was pretty tasty. The cubes were a bit on the smaller side though. I could get on board with this dish in the future. Good flavor.

-Flat noodles were okay. I thought the noodles were a bit on the small (not wide) side. I would have liked it if they were a lot bigger. Flavor was decent. I liked the beef.

Can't say enough how diverse their menu is. I expected a variety of noodles but they had some great fried rice and pasta as well. They served a small portion of peanuts while we were waiting which was pretty cool. I had the Wonton Noodle and the Yum Tom Goong Fried Rice, which comes with an assortment of fish, veggies and egg strips. While the Wonton was decent, I thought the noodles and broth were just meh. The Wonton dumplings are a little chewy and unusually large. the Tom Goong dish, on the other hand, was great. It has a spicy yet sweet taste, very unique. The value of the dishes are excellent, ranging from $5 tapas to $10 for a regular dish. The service was friendly, food comes out in a few minutes and never had to wait for a refill of water.

2999589,2014-07-07,0,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"Wendy's is a fusion-type place with a great and varied selection, but I've come to love one of the more authentic Chinese dishes! I came here with a tutoring student a year or so ago and she knew Wendy from another establishment, and I've been going back whenever I can since. I live a bit far from the location but if I can put up with the drive it can't be beat. Everything I've had here has been excellent! The only complaint I've had was actually from my aunt, who just can't seem to find Singapore Noodles to her liking here in Las Vegas. My favorite dish to get is the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce but I've also gotten to a point where I won't eat chow mein from any other restaurant because I like how Wendy's Noodle Cafe does it the best.

Also, this might sound funny since Wendy's is primarily Chinese/Cantonese cuisine, but I hadn't found an appreciation for kimchi until I had it here with their grilled beef short ribs.

Customer service here is great, especially considering how busy it can get in the evenings. Everyone is friendly from the owner to the staff and they're really sweet about putting up with me since I drink water by the gallon whenever I eat, so kudos for that. I always get a funny look when I order dishes without bean sprouts (I've had traumatic experiences with them, I'm sorry!) There are always complimentary peanuts (that I swear taste better than any peanuts I've ever bought? Where do I get these peanuts??) and people checking in on you, even when the restaurant is a bit busier. The place is clean and has a great atmosphere, and there's a TV typically playing music shows from China/Hong Kong or Korean music videos that are quiet enough to complement rather than interrupt your meal.

I highly recommend the pan fried rice noodles with XO sauce - and ask for extra sauce on the side, if you're a fan of the taste like I am. The Korean-inspired BBQ short ribs are a good deal for their price and I honestly order all the more customizable dishes here (like noodles and rice) with chicken because it's perfectly juicy and tender and I've never encountered so much as a bite of gristle. The complaints about things being under-seasoned in other reviews are valid--I've had my share of more mild dishes here than I'm used to, but considering I can just ask for more sauce on the dish I'm obsessed with, it's never bothered me. Plus, I've got heart problems, so the less salt the better!",7WgmtfyZ4eBKNFJ2T5w4YQ,0,0,5,nn-l_Udp24ZJeRLa7eHl1A

We ordered the Beef Pan Fried Noodles again: This time requested less salt and it came out perfect. This dish is also a must because they cook is just right. With the perfect crisp, and taste to it. I'm impressed that they got everything correct.

The broth in the #26 was good but I have had better (Hu Tieu in OC, on Newhope), and the wontons in my dad's noodles were a disaster. The meat in it had a smell that indicated that it is old and pretty much going bad. My seafood udon was not very spicy and not very flavorful. There was not a lot of noodles in it either. I also got the assorted vegetable chow fun. It was seriously lacking in flavor and very greasy. I ended up tossing most of it. Overall, I would not come back for any of the noodles here.

For dessert, we decided to try the durian crepe. For all durian lovers, this is a must! I believe they used real durian to make the crepe as there was a tint of bitterness in the crepe which is typical taste of the durian.

Since my cousin wanted to eat Wendy's Noodle Cafe and she kept mentioning about it, I decided to give it another chance. We came with a group of three this time that is me, my cousin, and our friend on Thursday, January 25, 2018 around 8:20 p.m. We were greeted by Wendy, the owner. One of the server took us right in to our table and we were seated.

We tooked a look at the menu and knew what we wanted to eat. A few minutes later, the server took our order. We ordered:
- Salty Fish Fried Rice
- House Combination Crispy Chow Mein (Pork, Seafood, and Vegetables)
- Pepper Glazed Spare Ribs Clay Pot
- Wonton Noodle Soup

They of course still have the complimentary hot tea which I like especially this cold Winter weather. Within 10 minutes, all our food was coming out quick! We all digged in.

I gotta say, it has been a while since I ate Wendy's. ALL THEIR FOOD WAS GOOD AND SIZZLING HOT! My tastebuds were mouthwatering with great taste.

At the end, we all finished our dinner with nothing leftover. Surprised right? Our stomach was full of happiness.

As for the service, the servers were responsive. Wendy kept coming to our table to make sure we were satisfied with our dishes and drinks. And yes, we were very satisfied.

My friends and I were looking for a good place to eat around Chinatown. We wanted to try something new, so I went to Yelp and found this little gem. We went to their website and looked over the menu, which was extensive and had a range of items from Noodle Soups to Porridges to Sandwiches and everything else in between set at very reasonable prices. The pictures featured on their website were tantalizing to look at, enough so that my friends immediately knew what they were going to order.

Wendy's Noodle Cafe is located in the plaza where 168 Market is,  but may be hard to find because it's a standalone building with no obvious signage. After finding the restaurant, we walked in and were kindly greeted by our server who then seated us. We were given complimentary salted peanuts, which tasted great and were addicting, but probably not so healthy due to the oil & salt that covered them. Anyways, after looking over the extensive menu, I narrowed down to two choices- the House Steamed Chicken over rice and Assorted Meat & Shrimp w/ Clear Noodles. In the end, with the help of our server, I chose the noodle dish.

Assorted Meat & Shrimp w/ Clear Noodles ($6.50): Delicious! The broth was light yet flavorful, and there were a lot of things to eat other than noodles in my soup. I especially enjoyed the greens, the pork, the shrimp & the squid, along with the fish cake slices & the itty bitty pieces of fried, crackling pig skin which gave texture to the soup. The fish balls were not my favorite, however. One thing I thought could've been better was the noodles themselves- they were a tad overcooked, making for too soft noodles that I couldn't really enjoy. If the noodles had been chewier, I think this soup would've been perfect. 

My friend ordered the Egg Noodles Pan Fried w/ Soy Sauce ($6.50) and asked our server if they could put chicken & veggies in it, which she said of course to. My friend said this was really good, and I have to agree with her as I tried a little bit. The sauce wasn't too thick or too oily, the noodles were perfectly crisp, and the assortment of vegetables made me happy. She definitely could not finish all of it, so they took what was left back to the kitchen and wrapped it up for her to take home. 

Prices are amazing considering the portion sizes; service is great; and the food is delicious. I am definitely coming back here again!",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,5,1,4,j6IPDbNh9xa4Ub3bHT6rmQ

I ordered the rice noodles with soy sauce and egg (they told me I should get extra egg and I did). It's a chef special so I assumed it was good. And damn right it was good! It's a flat rice noodle times a hundred.. So really, it's a THICK rice noodle pan fried with egg and soy sauce. Could have been a bit more crispy but it was still bomb.com! I didn't really need a sweet/sour sauce that accompanied it.

I also ordered just a simple rice noodle soup. No meat. No nothing. Just a bit of greens... The soup was delicious. Not overly oily. Just the right amount of flavor. Delish!!!

The restaurant is well lit and much cleaner than similar cafes in the area.  The menu is extensive and has more than enough choices to satisfy any palate.   My favorite would have to be the ""trieu chou pan fried cake with egg"", the best I have ever had!  The chicken wings are definitely a must have, lightly battered and smothered with deep fried minced garlic, spices, and chili.  The ""shaken beef tenderloin"" was moist, flavorful, and super tender.   The wontons are made fresh everyday and are just like I remember how my grandfather and mom used to make.

Wendy's was a tough review. I really wanted to give it 4 stars because a few of the dishes I ordered were quite good, but in general the full meals just didn't have enough variety in them. The basis of each dish was great, but didn't really constitute a dish in my mind, just a good piece of food. For instance, the BBQ pork was some of the best in the city and pretty cheap for under $7, but it came pretty dryly marinated and on a bed of rice, with only a few small pieces of Chinese broccoli on the side. The egg noodles were fantastic as well, but didn't have many vegetables or protein, so although the noodles tasted great (hence the restaurant's name) the dish didn't compare. I need to check back and see if they have a lunch special where it's more 1-2 ingredient based rather than dinner where I expect more. Prices are reasonable too. I would recommend Wendy's, but order some side dishes to accompany the main food on your plate.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,PpWudglbLzdsCG3TxuoxOg

He never asked us if we wanted something beyond water. Oops! A big beverage oops if I was the owner. The manager was too busy talking too loud about a past incident with a mistaken order to a friend near the door to even notice us or ask us if we were happy with everything.

Located in Chinatown at the same shopping center as 168 Market.  Wendy's Noodle Cafe is its own house, literally.  

The place is small, but there's never a line and there's always a place to sit.  It gets busy, but good thing it doesn't get super packed.

I come here for the egg noodle soup.  My favorite is the sui kai dumpling soup with egg noodles.  The sui kai dumplings have shrimp, pork, and chives on the inside.  It comes in a big bowl, but I always end up finishing the whole thing.  It's that good!

I've also had their roast duck and egg custard desserts.  Yummy.

The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the service.  There were many servers, but it took some time for our food to arrive each time I go there.  Whenever I need to ask for extras (like sauces, silverware, chop sticks, etc), it took some time to get a server's attention.  I think they could be a little more attentive and responsive.

Service has always been friendly and attentive.. I must compliment Tina, we are not even locals and she remembers us every time we are in town.

Anyway, about the food, their seafood noodle soup is very good, you can request egg noodles instead  as we always do. I highly recommend the lamb chop appetizer. Awesome. House special Chow mein (pan fried Cantonese style) is also great..

If you ever read my reviews, I had a review for a restaurant specializing in Clay pot rice dishes. I was really sad it closed down. Amazingly Wendy's Noodle Cafe also offers similar dishes. You do need to call ahead because it takes about 30 minutes to prepare.Unless you don't mind the wait. .But it's GOOD!

It's really more a local restaurant therefore not so much for visitors. But if you drive there with your own transportation, I suggest you try it. A great alternative from casino food if you are staying for more than a day or two.. It's close to Vegas Chinatown district. Very close to the strips.

3577102,2011-01-22,0,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"I decided to visit Wendy's Noodle Cafe after doing a search near my zip code for the highest rated restaurants.  All I can say is, wow, yelpers were right on the money with this one.  Another good Asian restaurant near Spring Mountain Road?  Say it ain't so! 

I went with a friend around 1 PM on a Friday.  The place is pretty easy to find, on the west side of Jones a bit north of Spring Mountain.  We got the feeling that the building used to be a Pizza Hut or something similar just from the size and shape of it.  There's seating for about 75 people inside, and about 15 were there when we came in.  The decor is a bit sparse, but it's clean and quite spacious.  There was a TV tuned in to Cops, strangely enough, a few Buddha statues and a mechanical maneki neko.

You can view the menu on their website, so I don't need to go into details about the kind of food they offer.   They say it's Hong Kong cuisine, and obviously they have a ton of noodle dishes, but they have other things as well.  I already knew, from having read other Yelp reviews, that I was going to get the beef in pepper sauce and rice (#61 as of the time of this writing), part of the ""East Meets West"" portion of their menu.  We also got some chicken wings as appetizers and the Chef's Spicy Chicken, which I asked for as hot as they could possibly make it.  You get some water and a small plate of salted peanuts (like straight out of Planter's) before you order.  

The chicken wings were good, with a decent amount of pepper on them, and they were very large.  Compared to Lotus of Siam's chicken wing appetizers they were easily twice the size.  The spicy chicken was good and it comes with a small bowl of rice.  I'd say it's just under the level of spiciness of the hottest flavor of Ma's Spicy Diced Chicken from Dong Ting Spring.  

The beef and rice, however, was utterly amazing.  It is easily one of the two or three best dishes I've had in my 2 years of being in Vegas.  It's the kind of dish that makes you say ""if I wanted to, I could choose to never go to the store again and come here for this dish for every meal.""  It's that good.  When you first pick up the beef it feels like the texture is not going to be good in your mouth, but it's absolutely perfect.  The sauce is very savory and goes perfect with the beef and the rice.  The rice itself is slightly red and on the menu it says it's supposed to have a tomato flavor.  I didn't really taste it but I will say the rice is perfect too.  It wasn't overly sticky or dry or hard, it was just right.  The dish also comes with string beans but I am not a fan of string beans so I passed.  My friend, who got the same dish, said they were very good, done all the way but still crunchy.  The soup of the day is also served with the beef and rice, and it was turnip and carrot soup which neither of us was willing to try -- sorry!

The only possibly bad thing I could say about the place is that the sodas are given to you in cans.  They do give you a glass with ice, but obviously there are no free refills and I wonder why if they go through the trouble of giving you a glass in the first place if they're going the can route.

The prices are amazingly low.  For 3 sodas, 3 dishes, and an appetizer we only spent $35.  Service was very quick and we were checked on numerous times throughout the meal by at least two servers and I presume the manager or owner as well.   I went in with high expectations from the reviews and said expectations were exceeded by far.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,5,PKlrwJFatDFg3mxs0-Cthg

We came in a got greeted properly. Some people on Yelp posted about the complimentary peanuts but we unfortunately  did not get any. We went through the menu and there were soooo much to choose from. They have appetizers ranging from around $5-7. As you can see,we ordered the Shanghai Dumpling. The Pepper Steak with Fried rice omelet caught my attention and ofcourse we got the Rib eye Bao Burger.

Shanghai Dumpling- more like a soup dumpling with a weird cherry like sauce on the side but I suggest dipping it in soy sauce instead:)
Pepper steak with fried rice omelet- tender steak since mine was medium with a peppery gravy like sauce while the fried rice was cooked to perfection. Good portion size as well. 
Rib eye bao burger- a bit dry but still packed with sweet bbq flavor with a really soft and moist bun. Also with a sauce if refreshing salad. 
Thai tea float- bomb as f*ck! Ask for less or no ice with extra caramel sauce.

Overall we were very full and more than satisfied with the meal. I have it four stars because the service was kind ""Bleh"" like the sever didnt ask what we wanted to drink. Our food came in and we finished it before we got the dumplings(appetizer) and no one ever checked up on us to see if we're doing okay or we need anything.

Like others have mentioned, clean great service, etc, and the menu items looked good
so we asked our waitress for suggestions and favorites. We ordered the following according to her recommendations:

Seafood Noodle Soup- pretty standard, okay tasting, and egg noodles were good, but the noodle/broth ratio was off. I was fishing for more noodles in my big bowl of broth.
Shanghai Dumplings-One bite of this left a weird aftertaste in the filling. I really wanted to enjoy this, I tried another one, and I was done. We were more grossed out by the fat that solidified on the vinegar dipping sauce a few minutes later.

We made the mistake of trying the baked spaghetti which was overly sweet like the Jolibee version which I also don't care for, also with a wierd aftertaste. By the end of our lunch, we were filled more from their delicious hot Jasmine Tea...ALOHA!!!

The owner replaced my mother's dish for something else she wanted, which she did not have too much motivation to, but in the end she had the curry fish ball appetizers which was decent.

First things first, hands down, the best youtiao I ever had. Each piece was fried just right, brimming with crispy, oily perfection. And it costs only $1.95 and was definitely  a favorite among my friends and I. 

The wonton noodle soup was delicious as well. I was looking for something brothy and warm, since I needed to recuperate from the night before. The wontons were crafted perfectly, with a generous helping of meat in the interior and slippery, soft wonton skin on the outside. Even though the dish is advertised with thin egg noodle, you can just inform the waitress of your choice of noodle. The broth is light but flavorful and was perfect for warming up my stomach. 

Curry fish balls were delicious too! Small, yellow fish balls served with a sweet  thai-curry inspired sauce made for a wonderful appetizer.

What I want to base this review on today though is their brand new addition of a happy hour and new menu items. The Wendy's Grilled Salmon is beautifully grilled and sits on top a bed of black sticky rice and assorted mushrooms with a sweet, sour, aromatic, and slightly spicy sauce drizzled on top. By far one of the best dish I've eaten in my lifetime of food adventures.
In addition, I also recommend their Pork Belly Bao Burgers, Shanghai Dumplings, Pan Fried Rice Cake with Soy Sauce & Egg (bot chien) for those seeking comfort Chinese/Vietnamese food.
For those looking for something a bit more western, Wendy's menu also covers a wide variety of fusion dishes, my favorites are: Rib-eye and Rice stone pot with assorted mushrooms and Black Pepper Steak & Rice Omelet.
Wendy's Noodle Cafe never disappoints me whether I am dining out with a pair or a large party, they always ensure that the food and quality of service is excellent.

When I got my food, it wasn't exactly what I expected. I normally order Hu Tieu Nam Vang which is Assorted meat and shrimp on rice noodles. On their menu, it says Assorted pork and seafood. I order it dry which means the noodles come dry with the soup on the side. When my noodles came out, it was bland. Not enough soy sauce or sriracha could have saved my noodles. The soup was okay but it came out nearly cold. Soup is supposed to come out steaming hot! 

I also ordered the fried rice cake with egg. The rice cake with egg was too fried, felt like I was eating crispy rice instead of the normal softer rice cake I'm used to.

Since I dragged him along to Vegas for a soccer tournament I was playing in, and he would be forced to pretend to enjoy watching me play in the sweltering heat for several hours each day, I decided to oblige his love of Chinese food and get dinner in Chinatown.

He chose Wendy's Noodle Cafe, based on the great Yelp reviews.  They had a couple of vegetarian options, but not tons.  Your usual options were there - veggie spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, vegetable chow mein.

We ordered the veggie spring rolls, vegetable chow mein, and my old man got something that was seafood and noodles - it might have been called seafood and noodles.  The seafood included squid, fish, and shrimp.

I thought the spring rolls were particularly good - it is difficult to make an outstanding spring roll, they are generally all good, but few are great.  These were great.

The vegetable chow mein was not as good.  I didn't like the sauce, I felt it had too much corn starch or something...couldn't really put my finger on it, but there was something about the sauce I wasn't into.  Also, the noodles were very thin, and I like thicker noodles.  Not a major failure, just not my cup of tea.

My old man loved the seafood noodles thing.  He said the shrimp was perfectly cooked, and he even had an entire conversation with our server about how well-cooked and fresh the squid was.  She said they get it fresh each day, it comes whole, and they prepare and cut it there.

I would definitely like to try Wendy's again, but I would not order the vegetable chow mein.  Although they don't have a ton of vegetarian options, I'm sure they would change up a recipe for me if I asked - the staff seemed very friendly and accommodating.

Compared to the $$$ and $$$$ places on the strip, this joint is heaven on price, quality, and quantity. We ordered the grapefruit salad, which was simply amazing. It's not Chinese, but they managed to make the dressing wonderful and it was better than any fruit salad I've tried. We got the Chef's special tofu clay pot and this was my favorite dish of the night. The tofu was tender and the broth it was cooked in was aromatic but not overwhelming, exactly what we needed after a physically strenuous day. The spicy stir fried beef was also decent, but not quite as astonishing as the clay pot. Maybe I just thought they could've gone crazier with the spices. Oyster sauce broccoli was a welcomed veggie dish, though it was pretty standard in terms of taste. Our least favorite dish was the seafood noodles. Compared to every other dish which was rich in flavor, the noodle, broth, and seafood were all on the bland side. Oh, and rice came with the dishes, you didn't have to order it (really it should always be that way!). 

Finally, for dessert we ordered the rice mochi with peanut and caramel. I actually did not see any caramel in it. Maybe it was just the light lines of caramel sauce drizzled over the plate. These were bite-size mochi filled with peanut filling (the same kind you'd get in rice balls). These were steamed, I was told, and I highly recommend them !

Ordered everything I wanted to order plus a French ice coffee. They served us complimentary soup, which was nice... The soup was bland however so neither of us finished it. 

Out came my dripped French coffee... Reminds me of the vietnamese coffee with condensed milk & you pour it over ice after letting the coffee drip from the filter... The coffee was a little too sweet for me & I wasn't a fan. I'm a huge coffee addict & I love how vietnamese drip coffee has a strong taste to it... However this French coffee was just too sweet & I could hardly taste the coffee. 0/5

Next the server brought the ramen noodle dish, to be honest... The ramen noodle was nothing special, you can easily make that at home. I'm not a fan the rice cakes so I hardly ate that. As for the beef, super tender. The best part of this dish, I just rather eat if with rice. Nothing special about this dish but the beef was delicious. 2/5

Then came the beef wrapped around mushroom... As the server put this dish towards the table she spilled some of the juice on the table... And my purse that was on the empty chair!!!  she just walked away after. I just got the purse too, so deep down I was a little pissed off, but didn't say anything. However the dish was good, tender and flavorful. 3/5

After came the fried rice cakes with extra eggs... It looks a lot better in pictures. I've had better at home 3/5.

Lastly was the Tom yum fried rice... It was good but reminded my friend and I of a fried rice we had at a thai restaurant, I wish it was more flavorful. However at this point I was stuff. The fried rice was good as well. 3/5.

I probably won't crave to go back anytime soon unfortunately. Food was ok & service was ok, they were good but they keep spilling as they serve food and even when they take away empty plates they drop it on the floor................. I've never experienced servers being so clumsy... I don't mind if it's once or twice but almost every time you stop by the table?!",17f-n5Rouu89FSKuc4c7xw,5,1,2,vPxHgr7fS7Rnjf4kh9lA7A

A fusion of east and middle East flavors which were well worth the price...most things on the menu are under $20....and of the 7 dishes our family sampled, all exceeded the price in flavor, freshness, and complexity...however, the durian crêpes were exactly as inhospitable as I expected them to be....but wife, being from the Philippines wouldn't let us pass on an attempt at them...lol...this restaurant is definitely a great place for a date, or just a really great Chinese dinner",teYu8_eZEJQKttJenJDQnA,0,0,4,JFhW5-rHjVwS9m6Z8CXxew

Today, we came in and requested for the big round table because we always order big. We like different varieties of food. The older man (I think he's the owner) said it was reserved. Okay...the whole time we were there...no one came to sit in that big round table. 

We always order congee and wonton and this time they came in very small bowl...hmmmm seriously! We asked the waiter why they changed the size of the bowl...he said it always came in that size bowl. Ummmm no it didn't! Our food also came out at different times. Oh and when we finished eating the Chinese donuts that we ordered...which we ordered 3 plates, came out last! We didn't even eat it! Plus it looked like it was absorbed with lots of oil and looked retried. Gross! My steak and fried rice omelet that I always order...the steak came out cold! And my fried rice omelet was filled with white rice...not fried rice. The spicy rice cake noodle tasted old! Gross! Food quality literally sucks ass today!

Food: 4/5
Actually it was pretty good.  I had the Chiu Chow Seafood rice noodle soup (yes, it was 110 degrees), but it was a decent late night meal.  We also had dumplings noodle, and that was OK.  I was more impressed with the rice noodle soup since it was up-to-par with the Chiu Chow Restaurants I've been to in my neck of the woods.

We also had they rice balls dessert dish, and that was good, too. They make it fresh from order, and the rice balls (warm and chewy) came with a nice serving of red rice.

Several of us gathered here to try a number of dishes.  We ordered:

Curry fish meat balls
Shanghai dumplings
Honey glazed eggplant
Sweet potato fries with black sesame
Kung pao assorted mushrooms
Pork with preserved egg porridge
Pan fried noodles
Walnut prawns
Rice omelette with seafood Alfredo
Grilled ox tongue
Spicy steak cubes and rice cake with ramen
Chef's special fried chicken wings
Fresh fruit Napoleon
Hong Kong style mango crêpe
Snow flower sundae

I'd recommend these dishes:

Curry fish balls, Pork with preserved egg porridge, walnut prawns, grilled ox tongue, and the chicken wings.  Avoid the sweet potato fries, the pan fried noodles, and the rice omelette with seafood Alfredo.  For me to recommend chicken wings is an uncommon thing.  Good flavor on the wings and the jalapeños served with the dish were great!

As for the desserts, perhaps sharing made it harder for two of the three dishes.  The snow flower sundae is a two person kind of dessert and the Napoleon had fresh fruit but crispy layers that broke in small pieces.  The mango crêpe was good and it comes in a plastic box so you could take it home if you wanted.

The restaurant was not busy but service was a bit lacking.  I'd list this in my OK category.  It might be worth another try sometime but I won't hurry back.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,7,3,v_CCcX5b2hJZWVvbGMlFRQ

Fried dumplings appetizer - nothing to write home about.  Even the sauce had no inspiration.

Shredded chicken noodle soup - cousin ate this.  Said it was good.

Thai tea - not good, Red bean milk tea - eh, kid enjoyed the pineapple/mango/something something shake

As you walk up to it, there's not much glitz and glamour as most averaged sized Chinese restaurants are. We were quickly seated and given cold waters to relieve us from the heat outside. We ordered and the food came out quickly.

I ordered the the Stir Fried Udon and Seafood with XO Sauce and it was delicious! The udon was perfectly chewy and held the spicy XO sauce well. The flavor was tangy and savory and consistently spread through each bite. There was also a good amount of fish, squid, and other seafood on top!

My friend ordered the Black Pepper Steak and Rice Omelet. The steak was flavored great and the rice omelet was light and fluffy. It's literally a omelet with rice inside but it wasn't super heavy or cheap feeling so that was good.

For appetizer we decided to get the Pan Fried Rice Cake with Soy Sauce & Egg. It was literally a dish of rice cake cuts pan fried in egg and soy sauce. As basic as this sounds, it was actually really tasty. Not too salty, and the rice cake was chewy but bite-able.

As for the chow mein, the noodles were fried crispy on the edges and mixed with carrots, cuttlefish, BBQ pork, chicken, shrimp, more Chinese broccoli, and mushrooms in a thickened brown sauce. Hot, crunchy, and chewy all at once.  These noodles will definitely fill you with goodness.  The shanghai dumplings are served steaming in a bamboo steamer with a vibrant red pickled Ginger sauce.  They were very flavorful on their own with just enough of that soup dumpling quality. They didn't need that sauce or soy sauce. They were perfy on their own.

Hot  tea is complimentary. 

The restaurant is super bright, like a dentist office; however, it's immaculate. The chairs are custom carved with noodle bowls. Service was fast and effective.  They even offered suggestions and answered questions; rare for a chinese place.  Filled our drinks without asking.  Very friendly.

Came here for dinner during the week with some friends and this place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately. However we had to wait around for someone to come and take our drink order. My friend eventually had to flag down someone to come over as no one seemed to know we were there. The person at the register had to call to the back to get someone to wait on us..not very impressed so far. 

Our waiter finally came out from the back and ask what we wanted to drink. Since we were there so long waiting, we also put in our food order at the same time so we didn't have ti wait for him to come back before ordering. 

I decided on the Shrimp Lo Mein and their Chicken Rice Noodle soup. We waited around about 20 minutes before our food came out. Everything looked fresh and delicious. Even though we had to wait around at the beginning, the food was well worth the wait. My soup was well flavored with just the right amount of chicken. I would've liked more rice noodles in my soup, but still good. Next time I'll just try and remember to ask for extra noodles. The Shrimp Lo Mein was perfect. Just the right amount of shrimp and the flavor was on point. 

Waiter came around several times to refill drinks and to check if we needed anything. When it was time to pay for our meal, we asked to have our checks separate but when he returned he just brought out one. Kind of frustrating, but one if us just paid for it and the rest if us paid her our parts.

I came in intent on having just the Shangai Dumplings, and hitting the road, but I failed miserably, because it smelled so good in here that I ordered 3 dishes AND dessert hahaha. Place was nice and clean, with K-pop and C-pop playing on TV. Portions are generous mostly. 

Shangai Dumplings - I want more! So, this is my first experience with soup dumplings and I've got nothing to compare it to, but these were so good, and fun to eat. Biting into the dumpling and getting into that broth : ) They're like little individual wonton soups! They serve it with vinegar, but I ate them all as is, the broth and meat were so tasty. (Ok, no joke; As I was writing this review, the memory of these made me drive over and order these again!)

Honey-glazed Eggplant - Pretty good. Battered and fried, with a honey glaze and sesame seeds. Tastes how it sounds, the eggplant was just a little too soft for me, but the batter was crispy. 

Spicy Steak Cubes and Rice Cake with Ramen - Sweet and spicy. Most of the meat was mostly tender, just a couple of cubes I had to put some work into. Rice cake was kinda just there to munch on, not really adding flavor. 

Dessert: Chinese Herbal Jelly with Longan - generous helping of herbal jelly with coconut milk, topped with shaved ice and longan (similar to lychee). Good. The bitterness of the jelly worked well with the sweetness of the coconut milk and fruit, and the shaved ice was refreshing.

The bf went with the duck with rice noodles and let me tell you...they weren't stingy with the duck. The duck was really good too....and the broth was just as good if not better than mine.

-chef's special fried chicken wings. Seasoning is not overly salty, and has strong hints of curry which gives it a kick. 
-E-fu Noodles. I really enjoyed this one. I've had it with just mushroom before and another time with pork. The texture of this noodle reminds me of instant ramen, and that's probably why I really enjoy it. The sauce isn't too heavy. I wish it were more condensed and that more was used though because these noodles could easily get boring to eat. I'd recommend getting a meat dish along with this. 
-Chow fun with gravy and without. Pretty good! The beef is very tender and dry Noodles aromatic. However, the gravy could use a little more flavor. My mom loves their chow fun too, and she's very picky.

They have ramen, chow mien and many other Chinese dishes if you aren't in the mood for soup. I ordered their rice noodles with seafood and added in wantons. This totaled to around $10.50. My friends ordered their pan fried egg noodles and chicken ramen. Our food was ready and well-packaged in about 15 minutes. Keep in mind that they require a $15 minimum for credit/debit cards. 

The soup base was pretty bland but had potential. Had I been given some flavorful and spicy sauces to throw in it it could've been alright. The rice noodles were well cooked and the wantons were alright too. I was over it in about 10 minutes and ended up passing on the rest to a friend. I hadn't eaten much that day and was starving so the fact that I didn't even finish it should tell you something. I noticed my friends didn't finish their meals either.

Because there are people like me who feel embarrassed to take business associates to locations like KJ Kitchen, Bosa 1, Pho So 1, Cathay House, or Orchid Garden etc. 

So the pluses of Wendy's:
1. Cleanliness
2. Wonton noodle soup and roast duck. The skin of the duck remained crispy in the broth when it was served. AMAZING!
3. Fluffy fried rice 
4. Service. We had two waitresses tending to our every needs. The owner Wendy came out to greet us and share her knowledge of the next best thing.

Jasmine tea (hot) was served with every meal and it is delightful if you have never had it and as good as anywhere I have had it before or since.

If you are coming to vegas head here to eat, then head over to the giant Asian market next door to shop for some supplies for your stay.   You will not regret either decision.

While I was reading through the reviews the Mushroom Noodles , Beef and Tomato Rice, and the Chicken Wings stood out so I ordered them. The servings were more than enough for two.

The Mushroom noodles had too much of a pronounced mushroom taste for me. Don't get me wrong I love mushrooms but after a certain point I get nauseated. These tasted better the next day with a dash of Siracha. 

The Beef and Tomato Rice was delicious! It's like nothing I've tasted before. It had tender pieces of beef with tomato gravy over rice. I would come back just for that dish alone. 

The Crispy Chicken was nice and crunchy just the way I like it! They are the best wings I've had in Vegas at an Asian food place. 

I wanted to be adventurous so I tried the Durian Crepe. When I was ordering I forgot that it was known as ""the stinky fruit"". The creme inside of it was good but when the waitress kept saying I was brave to try the Durian because many people think it smells. I started to see why after two bites.

4506606,2011-11-02,0,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"Wendy's Noodle Cafe, located at the Western edge of Chinatown in Las Vegas, is a non-descript looking building... in which it, in it's former life, was a Pizza restaurant. Wendy, herself, is a middle-aged Asian lady, who re-located from San Diego a couple of year's ago.

First impression upon entering... Small place, nothing fancy... most of the patrons were androgynous college-aged Asians. Thought to myself... glad my kids didn't go through this fashion phase! I think, when they were this age... baggy pants were the fashion statement.


Onto the food...

Mango Pudding (**) No Asian restaurant that I've been to prepares Mango Pudding like this!

Wendy's Mango Pudding is a triple-layered Pudding made with Gelatin... not Milk-based that you'll find at most other Asian restaurants.

The Pudding looked OK. Triple-layered... Top and bottom layer were more opaque than the center layer, which contained bits of Mango. OK in flavor... but I didn't order J-E-L-L-O!!! All the layers were made with Gelatin... all previous Mango Pudding ordered at Asian restaurants were never made like this.

Rating on Yelp reduced to 3-Stars based mainly on this disappointment...

#82 Singapore Noodles (**** 1/2) Perfectly made... On a 6"" square porcelain plate you'll receive... thin Vermicelli Noodles with Bean Sprouts, slivers of Green Onion, Red and Green Bell Peppers... stir-fried with Medium-sized Shrimp, and slivers of Chinese BBQ Pork! Smaller portion than at most Asian restaurants.

Salt & Pepper Tofu (**** 1/2) The square cubes of Tofu are prepared like any other Salt & Pepper entree - fried at a high temperature until the Tofu looks like small Sandstone colored bricks. The Chef then tops off the entree with Green Onions, and most impoerantly some sliced Jalapeno Peppers which gives this entree a real kick. Very, very good! I think the kids had some trepidations upon my ordering this entree... but it became the most popular...

Let's start from the beginning. My friend and I walked in, waited about a minute until the server recognized us and without saying anything motioned with his hand the number 2. I nodded and he wave his hand to the half of the restaurant where he wanted us to sit and then proceeded to go to the kitchen. Well hello to you too.


As we sat down the server came back and without saying anything, put the menu on the table and left. He came back a bit later with hot tea. My friend and I ordered butter lemon chicken,  assorted seafood and pork with rice noodle soup, NY steak with rice and the beef cube sauteed with rice and green beans. I would've loved to know how the butter lemon chicken tastes like but sadly our server never gave it to us. I loved the soup it tasted very clean. The NY steak and beef cubes were well seasoned.


I should also mention that NOT once did our server or anyone other employee working the front asked "" How is everything"" "" how does the food taste"" ""would you like some water"" ""did you need anything"". NOTHING. I would've loved to get another bowl and spoon so my friend and I could share the soup, but we made do by taking turns eating for the serving bowl. Each employee had a dead look to their faces and seemed annoyed when you ask them a question.

-They used to give out a small dish of peanuts as an appetizer. No longer.
-Dishes ""appear"" smaller even when the head cook is there (see below) as observed over the past few months.

For a long term customer (been coming since opening week), this is dissapointing to make these small cuts. Also, the size of the dishes are getting smaller so it seems. Perhaps it was the afternoon cook (we arrived at 5:15). We noticed the main cook arriving and the dishes for the table next to us were larger (but not as before). I asked if the Singapore Noodles can be made with rice noodles (fun) instead of rice stick noodles, the server went to ask and was told the head cook was not there so it couldn't be done. Really?

They have a huge menu.  You have small appetizers for yourself, appetizers to share, they still break down the menu by veggies, chicken, beef, noodles, rice dishes, etc.  Great for when you are trying to decide on variety.  Its really hard to choose what to eat because they have chef specials, a lot of photos around the restaurant to get inspired from too.  

For you light eaters, try their mango shrimp salad.  Not as much greens as I would of expected, but still a good enough portion.  Flavorful shrimp and slices of mango.  It was clear dressing (thumbs up), a citrus type of flavor.  

I've shared the fried chicken.  Its basically salt and pepper style fried chicken.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but its still good.  

I have tried the Nang Yang noodles.  Mmmm, Nang Yang noodles, yummy.  Huuuuge portion, could probably feed about 4-5 people.  It's chowfun noodles with peanut butter flavoring, beef, and some veggies.  This is very heavy, so a dish I highly suggest to share. 

Steamed fish wasn't a disappointment.  I thought it was a small portion, but with the amount of food we had (party of 3) we still ended up bringing leftovers home.

My favorites were the chicken wings and the fried rice cake appetizer. The wings had a great dry seasoning (which I love more than sauces) and it was moist and crispy. I love rice cake and I love this preparation - the toasted and slightly crunchy exterior and chewy, soft interior. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the dish, although I thought the scrambled eggs was an odd accompaniment. The porridge (congee) was yummy and I love that they have so many different choices! I am a big fan of porridge and this did not disappoint. The fried rice and calamari were good, but I didn't love them. I did like the flavors of the fried rice, especially from the lemongrass, which is different than rices I've had.

We also had a soup before our meal (not sure what it was, but it was good) and a warm dessert soup with sweet potatoes after our meal (great flavor, not a big fan of sweet potatoes though).

House chow fun dry 
Half a roast duck 
Beef cubes with pepper sauce, green beans & french rice 

Ordered take out and everything was ready in 20 mins. Packed nicely & got a side of salad & steamed white rice, which we didn't know we would get. 

Curry fish meatball skewers- comes with 3 sticks, each has 4 meatballs on it and a side of the curry sauce. It was good but nothing special, I've tasted better ones before. 3/5 

Rib eye bao bun- comes with 3 buns with the meat inside. Very delicious & juicy. Good amount of meat in the bun. Probably wouldn't order again though because it's sort of pricy for 3 buns. 4/5 

House chow fun- I'm not a big fan of chow fun but was craving it and this definitely satisfied my craving. Had the wok taste to it and was very good. Got it dry because I don't like it drenched in sauce. 4/5

Half a roast duck- Good portion. On the website it said $10.99 and in the store we got charged $13.99 I believe. Comes with the sauce that duck usually has. Nice and juicy. But I have had other places with duck that has more flavor. 3.5/5 

Beef cubes w/ green beans & french rice- If you've never had french rice, you need to try it !!! They have it at pho places and it usually comes with chicken or beef. Beef cubes were really good and the black pepper sauce was tasty. I didn't realize the beef was sort of medium rare, and I would have preferred it well done.

The tomato beef dish was kind of just okay. 
It wasn't something I would order but my friend wanted it and even she said there was nothing special about it. I think that may have just needed a bit more salt to taste actually. 
The green beans, though were fantastic!! Omg, they were soooo good!!! Proably our favorite dish out of what we picked. Plenty of garlic and other flavors going on. I will gladly go back another say and try other items. 
The did notice the manager (or possibly the owner) stop by our table and other tables, to check how everything was. That was actually really nice and it's appreciated when they take the time to do that. 
The restaurant was very clean and decor is tasteful. Bathrooms were very clean as well. 
We will certainly be back! Thank you!",g2ne7kPY3ttcd3uf0vqz-Q,2,2,5,6-1FeXHDyXAyNWFIn0fk5w

Don't order pho here since it's a Vietnamese dish and these are Chinese chefs who excel at the Cantonese flavors.

The interior is spacious and the staff is friendly. They have a lot of unique dishes that you will have trouble finding elsewhere.

We started with two appetizers that the waitress recommended and we were not disappointed.

Grilled Beef Shortribs 5/5
Well seasoned and marinated in what tasted like a lemongrass Asian BBQ sauce, char grilled. Delicious and a fun texture experience.

Shanghai Dumplings 5/5
Served in a steamer, these dumplings are awesome. The meat filling is seasoned perfectly but the real treat is the liquid soup-type filling. I wasn't expecting it so the first one I bit into went all over my plate. After that I started eating them whole, and wow they were so good. I will definitely come back for these.

Salt and Pepper Fried Fish 4/5
The fish tasted fresh and the breading was crispy, but there was so much salt this dish was a little hard to keep eating. It tasted like this dish may have had a lot of MSG, not sure but you may want ask if it concerns you.

Assorted Seafood Noodle Soup 3/5
The noodles were good and broth was fine. The fish balls were good but the squid did not taste very fresh and spoiled this dish for me.

Sesame Mochi with Black Sweet Rice 4/5
Unique house made dessert. Delicious black forbidden rice with sweet coconut milk, soft sticky mochi balls with black sesame filling. Yummy.",5rL-YgU3CXHbQA3Txzdd9g,1,2,4,-0ZsgcSz3t8EtAgkLwdtjQ

Wendy's Noodle Cafe is technical a chinese restaurant, but their menu contains items that you might not be able to find it other chinese restaurants. I think their Tapas items are good and reasonably priced. For those who like sweat deserts, you gotta try their shaved ice or red bean float, they are so freaking good, much better than the boba drinks that ya'll probably have drank so many times now.

I think all of the items on the menu are reasonably priced and good, except one item in my opinion. The soup they use for ""noodle soup"" has pretty much no flavor and bland, so stay away from their soup based items. Other than that, I think you will like their food.

I had heard good things about Wendy's so it was a good second choice pick!
There was a bit of a language barrier with the servers but they did their best and also gave us some complimentary peanuts and some sort of broth with pork in it while we waited for our food so that was very nice..

Our dishes came out 1 by 1 but to be honest, as I write this review, I can't really remember how anything tasted.. The food didn't taste bad, it's just that nothing was very memorable or Yelp-worthy to me.. We tried the wonton noodle soup, tom yum fried rice, dry chicken chow fun & salted fish + chicken + tofu + eggplant hot pot.. 

I applaud them for having different fusion dishes on their menu and I may be back to try those dishes.. But as far as the Chinese food that we tried it was all just very average..

I am always on a quest to find some decent Chinese food in the valley.  Here are my takeways for this place:

1.  Service - Wow, I am impressed.  Normally the service from a Chinese place is not the priority, the food is.  However, here, the service is great and very friendly / family oriented. 

2.  Food -  We had oodles of noodles and they were great.  

a.  Beef Stew with Egg Noodle - Very tender Beef Stew, nice flavor and texture.
b.  Seafood with Egg Noodle - Plenty of seafood and a very clear and pleasant broth.
c.  Roast Duck with Egg Noodle - The roast duck reminds me of the ones I would order when home in San Francisco. Very nice taste, good parts with meat and not just the fatty chewy bits.
d.  Beef Chow Fun (Dry) - One of my favorites and this place serves it very, very good.  We ordered two servings to take home. 
e.   Beef Tomato over Rice - Also a simple favorite of our's and I haven't found this on very many menus in the valley.  A simple home style dish and it was tasty.


3.  Fellow Yelper My T advised that the toilets here were clean.  Hey now, I must say that the toilets were in fact pretty decent. That makes this 4 star place a 5 star because that is nearly impossible to do in a Chinese restaurant!

GK says, check this place out.  Inexpensive food, very home style and tasty.  This is real Chinese food at it's most basic family style and not the Americanized style you find at so many places.  Yep, they don't have orange chicken and broccoli beef!!!!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,2,1,5,fSCYwL7BAL0p2sHjDgqK1A

Chef's Special Fried Chicken Wings were absolutely delicious. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The flavors were great too.

Lotus Root with Cured Meat was my favorite! The crunchy texture of the lotus root coupled with the saltiness of the cured meat is the perfect accompaniment for a bowl of steamed rice! I wish we could get something like this in Orange County. 

We also ordered Stir fried A vegetable which was highly needed since we never eat enough vegetables when traveling.

Baos were my least favorite even though the server said it was their house specialty. I thought the bun was way too thick and really hindered the eating experience. The stir fried beef strips with onions were way too wet and made the bun very soggy very quickly. Perhaps a drier version with a little bit of greenery will make it more attractive as well.

One of the biggest indicators that the place is good or not is if you can see the ducks/chickens hanging, and they butcher them in front of you.  That was not the case with the roasted duck and chicken we ordered.  There was a clear indication that these items were cooked way earlier in the day, and they were microwaved to heat them up when we ordered.

The rice that came out was also terrible.  It was hard, and definitely not jasmine rice.

Other than that, there weren't too many authentic items, and it was somewhat expensive for the quality of food.

Go to Sam Woo instead and try the duck and chicken there.  The difference is night and day.",5otjbT9Iss5tdlBoaSLkPA,1,1,2,BMgdt8USyFNA7--8fB4awA
4975616,2010-01-24,1,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"Another Chinese restaurant joins us in Vegas - it's pretty modern in there with nice furniture and all.

Came in a little after 10 pm, and after taking a seat, peanuts and hot tea arrived shortly.

The Husband ordered Wonton with Egg Noodles ($5.95) - pretty standard with some greens.  Can't go too wrong with that.

I ordered the Assorted Vegetable Chow Fun ($6.50), and specifically asked for it to be done 'dry-style'.  However, when it arrived, it came out 'wet-style'.  They didn't have a problem changing it though, thank goodness.  (Which always worries me about sending food back at Asian restaurants.)  I appreciated that there were actual vegetables in it - broccoli, carrots, straw mushrooms, etc.  Sometimes when I order chow fun 'vegetarian', they just don't add the beef which means you end up with only onions and beansprouts (and you pay the same price).  So, I thought it was a decent size portion for chow fun too, and the noodles were not glued together (which means they took the time to really loosen them up).

Overall, it was a good experience.  A bit pricey for what we got and they did come around and ask if we wanted more tea.

Their menu has a bunch of Asian desserts - however the pictures on the menu don't exactly much what's on there...which makes me not sure exactly what they offer.  There's also a section on the menu called ""French Style Rice Platter"" that offers things like 'Hammered Chicken with Rice' and 'Shrimp with Lemon Grass Kabob with Rice'.

5 stars
1.  The preserved egg and pork porridge.  So amazing and perfectly salty and thick.  Love the meat and the flavorful eggs.  This is my favorite dish there.

2.  On the appetizer list they have a fried rice cake with egg that is really good.  Dip it in hot sauce and enjoy!

3.  Their red bean drink with grass jelly and ice cream.  Perfect way to end the meal.  Its big so share with friends

4 stars
1.  Wonton noodle soup.  Hits the spot but I've had had better
2.  Ton Yum fried rice - I like it but it tastes more like tomato friend rice.  I like sweet.  My friends were expecting this to be spicy though.  Also squid was a little slimy
3.  Clay pot spare ribs - also very sweet but good.  The one complaint is that there wasn't enough meat on the bones. 
4.  Their rice cake and ramen with beef dish.  I like it but tis sweet..so don't order if you like savory
5.  veggies - standard I guess

3 starts
1.  Singapore noodles - good but wayyyy tooo salty.  Maybe it was just our batch

1 star
1.  Their beef with flat noodles.  This is such a staple in restaurants but they messed it up big time.  The noodles were slimy and the dish tasted like ALMOND flavoring.  SUch weird flavor.  Our whole table agreed.  Needed to put a lot of hotsauce and vinegar and soy sauce to mask the flavor.

5052253,2013-02-20,1,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"Still one of my favorite Chinese places. Good friendly service, clean and bright space, good consistently food. The owner is always so cheery and humble and remembers us each time and comes by to say hello. There are some unexpected fusion type dishes, but also traditional foods too (though this is not your average Chinese menu, more like Chaozhou style). Everything is fresh and comes piping hot, in large portions. There really isn't much over $10 so I feel this place is also good value on top of it being on with flavors. Since I come with fair regularity, I figured I should just make a running tally of what I'm ordering. 

Favorites - 
E-fu noodles: I have a thing for e-fu. It's a soft noodle with very subtle flavors, but comforting to me. 
Honey Glazed Eggplant - It's like honey walnut shrimp, but eggplant and less mayo-y. A bit of hot sauce and this crispy bite is a guilty pleasure.
Lotus root w/ pork - this isn't on any of the menus, but the black board menu all in Chinese. I've only ever had lotus root in soups so I had no clue it was crunchy. Thanks to Christina W. this became my favorite, though it's hard to order it since I don't know the Chinese name. I show them the picture I took! Haha. 
BBQ Pork Rice Plate - their bbq pork here is juicy and perfect. Comes with rice, and steamed veggies. 
Singapore Noodles - not on the menu anymore, but they have all the ingredients and still make it for me. This is my favorite place to get it actually, just the right amount of curry flavor, has that yummy bbq pork slices and shrimp on it. 
Fish filet salt & pepper - theirs is really nicely crisp and I like they make it smaller pieces than larger filets so easy to split, and plenty of crunchy surface. 

Other stuff I've tried worth mentioning - 

Nan Yang Chow Noodles- I've only had this once so far, but it was interesting and good. I didn't know what it was so figured, what the heck? It's wide noodles in a rich peanutty, spicy XO sauce. I would order this again. 
Crab with XO sauce vermicelli - I'm not too keen on vermicelli, but somehow between this and Singapore noodles, Wendy's sells me on it. 
Seafood XO sauce stir fried udon - This is like, chow meins  spicy, savory cousin for foodies. I think I just like anything in XO sauce. It's that umami spiciness that is irresistible. You can also do this with thin rice noodles, but have not tried it that way. 
Spare rib black bean sauce hot pot - I love those spare ribs at dim sum, but I just wanted a whole bowl full on rice. Finally a place with it in a entree size just for meeee!  
Pan fried rice cake w/ egg - The BF isn't a fan so I never get to order it, but I love crispy rice cake and with the over easy egg on it and dipped in a bit of soy and red vinegar - yum! 
Salty fish rice with chicken - their fried rice is fluffy and not greasy at all here so even if salty fish isn't your thing, try another fried rice and I don't think you will be disappointed. 

Also their desserts here always look great and interesting but I never have the room for it. One day. One day I will have a dessert. I've also never really ventured much in terms of their soups, though I always see people ordering it up. 

I know I've forgetting a few things I liked. I try to order 1 new thing and 1 favorite when I visit so I'm sure I'll be updating this review a few times.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,2,5,P6YeISaIM2GB2tMdX6qp3A

I knew from reviews I wanted to try the Rib Eye Bao Burger and crispy noodles as I'm obsessed with crispy noodles. We waited at least 10 minutes for water and for our order to be taken. I know this place was busy but there were plenty of staff and they passed us several times. My significant other wanted a noodle soup and went with the pork and seafood noodle soup. The soup came out first and had absolutely no flavor to the broth. Flavor rating .5 stars out of 5. The rib eye Bao burger was just ok. Meat was tender but missing something. Hoisin and chili sauce couldn't even fix this. The salad that was served with it had the most awful dressing I've ever had and although we dont waste food we didn't finish that. Lastly I was hoping the crispy noodles could save this disastrous meal but I was left wanting more sauce for my noodle and pondering the taste of the gravy like sauce on top. It had a salty Taste to it and I've never had a salty soy tasting sauce on my crispy noodles before. I was going to order another dish as we were so unsatisfied with what we were served we didn't even bother. Between the service and the terrible food I wouldn't give them another shot. There's plenty of other Chinese places I could think of to go to. This is not one of them. They're doing their namesake a disservice by calling themselves a noodle cafe.,r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,3,2,1,sGCWLwV6NuOjRY-IAEiO-w

And I must say ... Good indeed..

We ordered the salt and pepper calamari, which was really good, had no tentacles which I love! I usually dont eat the tentacles anyways.

Next we also ordered the Rib Eye Bao burger which is TO DIE FOR! NO JOKE! I love it I love it! if You guys are ever in Wendy's make sure you guys order this..

Next we also ordered the Shanghai dumplings which is to die for as well. I suggest you order this too..

Then finally decided to try the Kimchie rice cakes. Was not a fan but it was different.. Im use to having rice cake as a dessert not as a entree. 

Overall the service was great. This is located in front of the 168 supermarket.

I have been here several times now and have never found it to be busy.  The service is one of the best with the owner or manager occasionally coming out to talk to you personally about the food.

My favorite noodles are the seafood with rice (egg) noodles and roast duck with egg noodles.  Don't worry if you're not in to noodles because they serve other great dishes too besides noodles, like their oyster omelette and a combination of american/chinese food on their east meets west menu category.  Their website is great too because it shows all the food with pictures.  Here check it out at http://www.wendysnoodlecafe.com/

Wendy's Noodle Cafe is an Asian fusion restaurant with lots of creative dishes.  They have gone where no other Chinese restaurant has gone, at least in the Southern California area.  Unfortunately, I was not brave enough to try their fusion dishes.  We stuck with their Chinese dishes.  The 8 year old daughter absolutely loved their Beef Chow Fun with gravy.  She normally is a very small eater.  She almost finished the entire plate of noodles by herself.  We also got their Seafood and Salty Fish with Dry Scallop Fried Rice.  Because the daughter dislikes rice, we hardly eat anything with rice in it.  Their fried rice was awesome.  The Poached Pork Kidney with ginger and scallion was cooked and seasoned wonderfully.  My only complaint was that their portion was so small.

Let's start off with the negatives and ""meh's"" :

Ordered the Curry Duck :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=_KJsI8uT_LdFvFdiniBg7A#_KJsI8uT_LdFvFdiniBg7A

Yeah, that's Roasted Duck...not Curry Duck lol.  When I brought it to the servers attention, he laughed and said it was not curry...obviously.  No offer to replace the dish or fix the misunderstanding...

And this duck was super lean...not too much meat on those bones, and the little that was there felt overcooked.  The meat didn't have too much juices on those bones, and the skin was so crispy that I couldn't enjoy it and ate around it.

Pork short ribs Stir-Fried with Bitter Melon :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=fMzqWY6oLJ6CWJ9lry_eWw#fMzqWY6oLJ6CWJ9lry_eWw

My first time eating bitter melon...it's bitter LOL. The pork ribs were good but tiny.  I'm not holding the bitter melon against the dish, because it is probably made well for what it is...just for the people that aren't familiar with it like me, be prepared to most likely not enjoy it.

Wonton with Egg Noodles and BBQ Pork :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=fpLfQZatF0B0eiSWVd7kgQ#fpLfQZatF0B0eiSWVd7kgQ

It wasn't bad...wasn't great.  Just meh to me.  

French Style Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce & Tomato Rice :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=wayufB5zBNxOkcYYn6zJKg#wayufB5zBNxOkcYYn6zJKg

This was not bad...I didn't find it very tender, but good taste!  I thought the beef was a little chewy, but it's not a bad choice overall with the tomato rice.

The goods :

Salt and Pepper Shrimp :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=BYjmWx0BTbm0Yc1tZvGGCw#BYjmWx0BTbm0Yc1tZvGGCw

This was the tapas portion, which is a good value at only $5...less than $1 a shrimp.  I have definitely had better elsewhere, but this was good bang for your buck variety, and since I was the only one eating them, I didn't feel like I had to splurge on a $12-13 platter of them.

Rib Eye Bao Burgers :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=DqRiuTVf0Xt0LdDM0AxIxw#DqRiuTVf0Xt0LdDM0AxIxw

Probably my second favorite dish here!  Some may find the marinade too sweet overall, but I enjoyed it, and the bao themselves were super fluffy and soft.

Hong Kong Style Mango Crepe :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=k55QCCal89lUCW2e55WudA#k55QCCal89lUCW2e55WudA

Great taste here...large chunks of mango inside!  I would recommend it, but liked this better :

Thai Iced Tea Float :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=UHf2q7kS4-GFt4bFhXyYfA#UHf2q7kS4-GFt4bFhXyYfA

This was great!  Dessert in a glass :)

And best for last....Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wendys-noodle-cafe-las-vegas?select=AomUQn8DvGqHZHpqc4UTrg

This was great...my highlight of the night. Very juicy insides and plenty of flavor.  This will be a must order if/when we come back for more.


I will give them another try...hope I can bump the review.  But there was a lot of ""meh"" and ""I've had better"" that distracted me from fully enjoying the experience here...the misunderstanding on the order and how they handled the problem was the icing on the cake.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,4,3,3,XQuQjxZ47Zj-uiCchIHA6g

Instead, I decided we ate Chinese food since that's really what would be open during this day here in Vegas.  First I drove to China Ginger  but decided to go a different route after reading some of the reviews.

I found Wendy's Noodle Cafe through Yelp, thanks!  The lady that greeted me was really nice and friendly and seemed to go above and beyond her duties.  She was helpful and patient with me as I looked at their menu trying to find something good to order.  Finally, I ordered French Style Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce & Rice $7.95, Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce $5.50, and Walnut Shrimp $12.95.  

After I made my order, the host served me some green tea as I was waiting for my food.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It didn't take too long before my food was ready which then I rushed home so my bf and I could eat.  The food was awesome.  Everything was as Yelp members said it would be and I would go back over and over again to try all the other food.  The meat and shrimp were tender and seasoned perfectly.  The Chinese broccoli had just enough and right amount of oyster sauce, and the rice was cooked perfectly.  

Hands down, I'm coming back.  One of my bf's friend's talked about Chinese porridge and they do have it in their menu.  This will be my next item to choose when I come back here.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,8,8,5,AhFWRxM6SexeXOQ41kUXvQ

Just tested the waters with our ordering: Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce (not in menu, but they made it for us!)...gots to get those greens in somehow. 
Ribeye bao burger...surprised actually - this was sooo good like the super best part of a cheesesteak without the cheese. 
Chefs special wings..greasy in a yumm way And ...XLB!! Coolio that only pork so all at the table may partake! Okay, no soup in most ...but..we are not on either coast either..!?@&!

While I haven't ordered any of her ""fusion"" items, I am always tempted and the creative menu options make me smile. I can say the same about their entire dessert and drink menu. Red Bean float? Oh, it's only a matter of time until I own you!

Until then, we have been making regular stops at Wendy's because we enjoy the fresh ingredients, clean surroundings and friendly service. Plus, I can easily guzzle a gallon of their hot tea with it's light jasmine flavor. 

We haven't really delved deep into the menu, partially because we can't really find the exact thing we're looking for (it's not your average Chinese menu, which is cool), but we've come to rely on some solid choices:

1. Meat Ball soup: This is for the husband.
2. Daily soup: It changes, but has always been delicious and hearty.
3. Stir fried Chinese lettuce in garlic sauce: It is never too greasy and always swimming in garlic! The only mild complaint is that once it was a bit overcooked and bitter. 
4. Noodles! Just tell them what you want, and don't be ashamed if it's straight up lo mein. We have also tried a rolled noodle specialty that was delicious, but without any vegetables. The best part is that the noodles have never been greasy.

On our last visit, we also sampled her soup dumplings, and I must stay they were solid, probably the best I have personally had in Vegas. And, we tried their XO String Beans. They could have been spicier, but they were fresh and delicious just the same.

If you're a clam-lover, they've got options with some big, juicy clams. 

I also happen to love their white rice. It is a small grain and has just the right amount of stickiness. Although, I have been refraining from white rice, I couldn't stop myself from using my chopsticks to shovel it down my throat on my last visit.

Long on the Chinatown 'to-do' list and recommended by several folks as one of the better places to share plates in the area, it was with four friends and one youngster that lunch took place at Wendy's Noodle Café on South Jones Boulevard, the menu embracing everything from ""fusion"" to traditional favorites with results that were somewhat variable.

One of the few free-standing restaurants in a high-density area where places seem to come and go with the wind, Wendy's Noodle Café has been enticing diners since 2009 when its owner left her position at Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine and Dim Sum, the restaurant slowly morphing over time to entice Western palates in addition to more traditional clientele while simultaneously growing its menu to more than one hundred options.

Divided into sections ranging from ""small plates/tapas"" to fusion, chef's specials, rice plates, noodles and more a first glimpse at Wendy's menu can seem overwhelming to those not doing prior research, the staff's limited English - though certainly better than any foreign language skills at our table - seeing the order largely predetermined by the suggestions of others with fifteen plates divided over three courses.

Not particularly focused on noodles, but rather a variety of plates divided across the breadth of the menu to see how well the kitchen performs, it was with a large bowl of creamy Congee that the meal got started and with plenty of Pork as well as Century Egg included the rice was imbued with a deep sapor, the same to be said of the Kung Pao Mushrooms that were far less heated than some may favor, though that fact allowed the dish's umami to instead come to the fore.

Ordering a plate of simple wok-fried noodles for the pickiest diner at the table, texture on-point though flavor was expectedly lacking, better bites were found in the densely packed Fish Balls paired with thick Curry paste, the Honey sweetened Eggplant a truly addictive dish while the Sweet Potato fries would have been greatly benefitted by the salty egg-yolk featured at other similar places.

Moving on to more plates, the total bill $145.34 before tip, XLB fell far short of expectations due to a thick and sticky wrapping with soup that lacked much depth, the 'tapas' of Chef's Special Fried Chicken Wings and Grilled Ox Tongue each fairing better with the former crisp and spicy while the later was smooth and tender with a salty-sweet finish.

Offering a sizable portion of Walnut Prawns for just $14.99, the quality on par to those at Jasmine where prices run double for fewer, more good bites were found in the spicy Steak and springy Rice Cakes with Ramen as well as the unique Omelet folded around fluffy rice topped in a thick white sauce teaming with Shrimp, Squid and Scallops.

A bit weary of desserts at such a place, though pleased by the variety offered, three sweet items were selected to round out the afternoon and although the make-to-order Napoleon was far less layered than many of its French counterparts the Berries were indeed fresh amidst light Cream while the Mango Crepe ate something like a Fruit Roll-Up wrapped around more cream and with a ripe and juicy center, the Snow Flower Sundae putting an unset Custard base beneath Vanilla Shave Ice, Red Bean, cubes of Herbal Jelly.

THREE STARS:  Expectedly lax in service, even with the restaurant less than 1/8 full, Wendy's Noodle Café falls somewhere in the middle of the pack for Las Vegas Chinatown, the best bet undoubtedly going with a group in order to sample many things with a focus on less finesse-oriented plates",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,3,3,-02mFJ4ByhzFK2_fH3DmKQ

5307801,2014-05-30,2,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"Wendy's tastes like home cooking. It's different than a place like KJ's; this is more of a Shanghai/Hong Kong style, with a little fusion (e.g. tom yum fried rice). 

Her restaurant is clean, with very good style for an Asian restaurant. Dish presentations are good as well. And it feels homey here, too, when Wendy comes around to say hello, see how the dishes are. The servers are attentive as well.

Green beans with XO sauce
Pan fried noodles with XO sauce
Spicy Chicken
Wonton Noodle soup

All of these dishes were cooked well and were entirely flavorful. I could eat the green beans everyday, it's that good. They're crunchy with a little bit of a scorch from the wok. The pan fried noodles are rolls of noodles cut into bite sized pieces. Both of these dishes have good XO flavor. I really enjoyed the burnt chili pepper flavor of the spicy chicken, where you cook a dried chili in oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. The wonton noodles aren't mind-blowing by any means, but they hit a certain comfort spot.

If I think about past dishes I've tried here, the only thing I didn't care for was the dish with the thinner noodles, crab, and XO sauce. I felt the crab to bell pepper ratio was disproportional.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,3,3,4,zXsyPRf3chzzAQ7Q8PysjA

I asked one waitress if I could charge my phone, and she took it and said she'd charge it. I asked for a Tsingtao, and the waitress acknowledged it. 15 minutes later, no beer. They started bringing out all our food, so I asked another waitress for my Tsingtao. She nodded, then walked away and went nowhere near the beer section. I asked her again, and she said, ""Oh, Chingdao!"" So it was because she didn't understand me. Okay... then she walks away and goes nowhere near it again. I had to stand up and ask the dude in the back for it, and he finally brought it. After we ate, which was pretty good, they gave me back my phone, uncharged.

We got there a few minutes before they opened at 11am. We ordered items that are on the ""safe"" side. We ordered Salt and Pepper Calamari, Salt and Pepper Prawns, Curry Duck...but we got served Roasted Duck instead, Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce, Wonton with Egg Noodles and BBQ Pork, Pork with Bitter Melon, Rib Eye Bao Burger and Mango Crepe.  Overall, it was a 3.5-star experience.
 
THE THINGS I LIKED:
Thai Iced Tea Float: I love Thai Iced Tea...add vanilla ice cream and it becomes an extra creamy drink. 5/5

Salt and Pepper Calamari: tender pieces of calamari lightly breaded and fried. Garlicky and tasty. 5/5

Roasted Duck: we can agree to disagree on this one.  I'm not a fan of animal fat unless it's bacon. This duck was lean and lacked a lot fat which is why I liked it. 4/5

Beef Cubes with Black Pepper Sauce: tender cubes of lean beef served with rice and green beans. 4/5

Mango crepe: so yummy! Fresh juicy mangoes with cream. A light dessert. 5/5


The Rib Eye Bao Burger was too sweet.  The Pork with Bitter Melon was not my choice - I was reminded why I refused to eat bitter melon when I was a kid.  Blech! The rest were alright and non-remarkable. 

The service was pretty good and our server was very attentive.  The only hiccup was we ordered Curry Duck but he was given Roasted Duck instead.  Oops!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,2,4,FvMXuCz0PAon9Ack8EcnHw

However, Wendy's is an excellent choice when needing a large variety of dishes but delicious and satisfying. The great thing about this place is the various dishes that are offered, from Chinese to various Southeast Asian Cuisine like Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian. 

A few of my favorites and must try:
Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice- Spicy and a bit sweet, so good and I would personally come back for this dish.
Shanghai Dumplings- Balanced with a good amount of filling and not too much flour. 
Chicken Wings- Delicious sweet and tangy flavor and great crispy texture.
Coffee Float- Balanced coffee flavor that is not too strong but paired well with the vanilla ice cream. 

The ambience is simple and modern. Most times the staff are attentive but they seemed overwhelmed during busy hours. However, the owner Wendy is very friendly and is usually around at the restaurant. She is a pleasant person and will do whatever she can to make sure your enjoying a great meal. For my siblings and I, Wendy is like an Auntie who has seen us grow up throughout the years. It will be a special place for us whenever we want good Asian comfort food.

I'd highly recommend the Tom Yum Goong Fried Rice (picture on the wall), it is a strong thai-fusion style that is so hot, fresh, and perfectly crisp!  We ordered a pleasant rice noodle soup which had a flavorful, clear broth and fresh veggies.  Also tried curry fish balls, which were my least favorite of the bunch.  Probably frozen and re-heated, but it did come with a nice soy-paste sauce that was slightly on the salty side.  Lastly we ordered a clay pot rice which came last (cook time is longest) -- very fresh, and the soy sauce the waitress poured in as she stirred the rice tied the entire dish together.

I came by myself during lunch time after doing some errands around Chinatown. The restaurant only had three other parties and both servers were quick to get me a menu, roasted salted peanuts, and water. When I had asked if they had any specials, one waitress laughed and said that everything was special. She caught on that I was asking about lunch specials and informed me that there aren't any. Her reaction was not meant to be disrespectful and was probably my favorite exchange throughout the whole meal.

I ordered the curry duck leg with egg noodles instead of vermicelli. The request for substitution was not meet with hesitance or a dirty look, instead accompanied by a ""no problem"" and a smile. My food came out in a matter of minutes. The large bowl had chunks of carrots and potatoes, then topped with a massive duck leg. On the side was a pile of bean sprouts and a lime wedge. The curry base was loose with the right amount of creaminess. The flavor was not too strong, nor overpowering. Easily eaten in the summer without feeling too heavy. For $7.95, it is about the average price you will pay for any noodle soup, but the quality is excellent.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,4,i6cB7KgbTcwgYQjkVhQb8w

Of course I kid.  But this was my 2nd visit and I must say I was completely underwhelmed the first time having ordered the Seafood Chow Fun.   I found the taste to be fairly bland which was about the last thing I expected.

It took me a while to return but this time I went with a Wonton with Egg Noodle Soup (because nothing is more comforting in 102 degree weather than a steaming hot bowl of soup).   When I made the take-out call the woman pressured me heavily (by asking ""Do you want Duck with that?"") to get added Duck to the soup.   A few minutes later and I was on my way.

Redemption complete Wendy's!   I love that for my take out order they separated the broth from the noodles/wontons/duck.   I rarely order soups like this take-out so I dont know if it's the norm, but I loved the option of constructing the soup myself.  It makes me feel like a Top Chef Master.  The star of the soup to me was the duck.  I'm a big fan of duck so it doesn't take much to please me other than simply providing the duck to begin with, but there were several nice pieces and the flavor was extraordinary.   I thought the noodles and wontons were fine, but had I not gotten the duck it probably would have kept the meal at a 3 star level so I was glad she asked me if I wanted it.   

Overall Wendy's sits at about a 3.5 for me, but I'm rounding up because the service was pleasant and the prices are fair.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,4,8LUqqBYZgJkb5XXVMvSEMA

My husband is with me and per our usual agreement with family style restaurants, he'll make the selections. I may hint at a particular dish, but will let him decide. 

So tonight we began with a refreshing cool honeydew melon and tapioca drink. There was a little bit of shaved ice on top with about five melon balls. Overall, the drink was both a delight to look at and to taste. 

Next came our steamed dumplings, followed by noodle dish. Both had no visual appear but taste was good. We then got spicy beef and spare ribs with preserved vegetables. The spicy beef was spicy! Instead of the long sliced green pieces being green pepper, it turned out to be jalapeno peppers and that added to the spice! The spare ribs with preserved vegetables wasn't my thing and I did try it, but didn't care for the bitterness to it. 

We had a few more dishes but other than the duck, not much else was worth eating again. But then we decided to try the desserts! The hong kong crepe with kiwi and the ice cream sundae with mango was delicious! What a way to cool the pallet after eating all of the spicy beef!

The beef cubes shrank after about 5 mins and the rice was just ketchup flavored rice. Overall lacked flavor. 

House special chow mein was suppose to be crispy and it wasn't. 

Baked pork chop rice was cut up pieces of pork over a bed of fried rice topped with a cheesy tomato sauce. 

It's called noodle house. Maybe next time we'll just try something from their entire page dedicated to noodle soups.

By the end of the lunch we had 4 sapporos, 3 appetizers and 4 lunches and got out of there for $23.00 per person.  

There were salted nuts on the table as an appetizer to warm us up.  We had friendly, quick and helpful staff despite the place being crowded.  We ordered the salt & pepper calamari, some ribs, and chicken wings.  The calamari was awesome. Just the right mix of salt, pepper and hot sauce or teryaki on the side.  The ribs were a little tough but the chicken wings were also perfectly crisp with just enough flavor.  The main dishes we tried were the flaming hot beef and rice, seafood chow fun and some sort of asian omelet that looked like an egg burrito.

The flaming hot beef and rice was perfect.  The beef was sweet with just a hint of the red peppers and if you wanted the kick, there were plenty of peppers mixed for you to bite into.  The seafood chow fun was lightly dusted with XO sauce giving it just a bit of a kick.  Swirls of calamari, talapia, shrimp and scallops were generously thrown into the chow fun.   The omelet was thin and heavily loaded with rice.  I had no room to try it but one of our biggest eaters could not even finish it.

I stuck with old trusty (Nan Yang Chow Fun), especially since it has been awhile since I came through.  I took a co worker over and he got a little adventurous with ordering the sliced rib eye noodle soup.  I hadn't had the chance to taste it but it sure looked like a Chinese version of pho.  A side order of short ribs were added along with some veggie spring rolls.  The kalbi was a bit on the salty, otherwise, can't be beat it at $4 and some change.  The rolls were average, but both dishes came hot, which is a plus in y book.

I believe that this is still a great Chinese fusion spot that gets it done right.  Wendy did her rounds as well and was socializing with the patrons.  I highly recommend this place to friends, fam and those visiting.  Hen hao chi!!!",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,2,0,5,Fz7e835tcXH_ODQAvMIQ9g

I need a volunteer who can show me what to order at Chinese restaurants like this.  I can order at panda express, but these type of places I am confused.

So. I just point at a few things on the menu.  I got a pork cutlet and some noodle dish.  I had the whole shrimp fried - I am not a fan of that.  Overall - The food was good.  I was happy.

Then, some real Chinese people sitting next to me got their order.  It looked so good!!!  I almost asked if I could buy in on there dinner and eat with them.

The place was super clean.  Probably the best service at an Asian restaurant in Las Vegas, too.

I had the delicious mango shrimp salad, always a favorite choice that never disappoints.  We also brought our own birthday cake for Chad, his favorite Red Velvet from a different restaurant.

- Indonesian fried rice: under seasoned and cooked with frozen vegetables. But I gotta say, the chicken wings that came with the rice were bomb.
- Rice cake and ramen with beef: beef was a little chewy, overall the dish needed a little more sauce and spice. Since it's based on a Korean dish, I was expecting more kick.
- String beans with XO sauce: beans were way too old to be eaten... They were super hard so we couldn't even chew some of them.

It looks like they just cooked the noodles and dump the sauce & chicken over the noodles. That's it. It wasn't baked at all and you can tell. We even asked the server if it was baked.. it's really not and the way he answered was whatever too. The proper way is to have it baked in the oven.

I'm a huge fan of noodles and noodle based dishes, so the assorted seafood and pork soup with noodles is what I just had to try.  While it was well put together, it was somewhat bland.  The noodles lacked a base flavor, so the taste of flour was very apparent.  The mini scallops were also rubbery.  They didn't hold back on the pork however.

I did save room for the mango crepes.  Quite good, but presentation was lacking.  They could at least try to remove them from the pre-packaged box.

The workers here are very friendly, particularly the lady with the glasses. She has always served us every time I'm here and she's very quick and helpful with what to get since we weren't so familiar with the menu. 

The restaurant:
Very clean and spacious. Every time I'm eating here, they're always mopping the floor. Shows how clean the front of the house is. I do enjoy the Korean music that they play here as well. 

Menu and food:
The menu is pretty big. A lot of varieties to choose from and it's not so expensive at all. Most of the things on the menu are between 3-15 dollars. What a deal! The portions are also big too. Every time we go here, we always love trying new things. So we ordered the beef egg drop over rice, combination pan fried noodle, and salt and pepper calamari. Here's the breakdown for you guys. 

Beef egg drop over rice with an egg on top? WOW.. I have no words to how delicious this was. If you're a big fan of egg drop soup, you'll definitely love this dish. Hot egg drop soup over rice, beef slices, and an egg.. Need I say more? Really filling. 10/10

Combination pan fried : consisted of crunch noodles, shrimp, squid, fish, pork, chicken, beef, mushrooms, carrots, and the greens! It was pretty filling, but it was just okay. 5/10

Salt and pepper calamari was very well breaded. The only problem I had with this was that it was tooooooooooo salty. Every time I ate a piece, I had to drink water. Ugh.. Probably drank three glasses full just from the calamari. 

Overall, everything came up to 30 dollars which is such a deal. My experience here has always been consistent. There's definitely some items on the menu that I would love to try.

I was expecting a more traditional authentic Hong Kong cafe style restaurant but this place is more of a fusion place. We ordered the ramen, rice cake and beef dish and honestly wasn't anything all that special. The Portuguese pork cutlet tasted good but had a really strange consistency to the sauce. It's as if they used way too much corn starch so the sauce was almost like stringy melted cheese, wasn't appealing to the eye at all. The soup dumplings were good although far from the best.

Honey glazed eggplant- 5 stars. WUUUUUUUUUHHHHH!!! this was a must before I got here, and I already believed that it would be amazing. So awesome and the rest of the group was shocked at how good it was. People. Eggplant is bomb if you know how to cook it right, and when It has some crispy stuff outside, it's even more glorious!!!!! I made my table a believer. 

Jalapeño in black bean sauce- 5 stars. Damn, this was no joke. It was spicy, but it was a really really good sauce. They should pour this stuff over rice or noodles and make it into a dish. 

Seafood chow fun in XO sauce- 2.5 stars. It was meh. I love chow fun, XO sauce was weak, and it lacked flavor. 

Crispy fried rice cakes- 3 stars. It's good, but I wasn't too fond of the vinegar sauce. I think it's just my personal taste issue as others loved it. 

Milk tea boba was awesome but thai iced tea float (which looked fantabulous in theory) was NOT good. That was a shocker.

5918952,2010-06-28,1,966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA,"First off, just wanted to say that this restaurant gets a solid 4-stars rating from me a Vegas local living on the SW part of town.  And below is my breakdown:

What I like or love:
* The portions of the fried rice and chow mein/fun are big. A typical person will not be able to finish it alone in one sitting. And the price is reasonable, considering the yummy & large portion of food you get. Food is good and perfect for lunch and dinner.
* The decor is really nice, especially in comparison to the other restaurants this category.  My Caucasian friend that I went with even said that the restaurant made her feels comfortable to go to, and not be afraid that you will not be able to get good service because you are not Chinese or Asian.
* It is super clean and tidy.  There's a lot of natural lighting coming in from the many tinted windows during the day.
* Waitstaff (most) spoke perfectly good English, and can obviously speak Chinese too (for sure Mandarin, and I am positive they speak Cantonese as well).  And they are friendly and attentive, without being intrusive.
* Convenient location in a parking lot that has ample parking.
* No substitutions on menu items, but in the end the kitchen did it anyway.  (Specifics: wanted the veggie fried rice with a little chicken which is not on the menu, so suggested ordering the salty fish and chicken fried rice and omitting the salty fish, and it has a little vegetables in it already. What we were served: Chicken fried rice with more broccoli.  Thank you kitchen staff for accommodating our request!)

What I didn't really like:
* Only UNLV students and staff gets the 10% discount.  Kinda suck if you are a student or instructor at one of the other schools (CSN, local high schools, etc.).  Okay I am being really picky here, just so I can have something negative to put down here.
* Some of the menu items have weird English translations (you will spot it right away when you look at it), but the Chinese names are fine and native speakers/readers will know what they are ordering.  But our non-Chinese friends maybe a little confused.
There are still a large portion of the menu that I have yet to sample, so I will definitely come back.  And being just a few miles from home makes it even better for me!

Who should patronize this restaurant:
1) Locals!  This little family owned restaurant is a must try, if you live or work in the SW.
2) Out of towners:
  a) Have own transpiration:  this will be a perfect off-strip, non-tourist trap restaurant to try.
  b) If you have to take a cab, it may be a bit out of the way depending on which casino you are coming from, so do a quick Google map search before deciding if the location is convenient/cost effective to visit.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,4,ZfuA8BXaj2C-aXB9C6Ta2A

It's really everything you'd want in a stereotypical chinese joint...the smell of cooked oil right when you walk in, down to the mediocre service from the awkward employees. They came by really early to see if we wanted to order, but had a lot of trouble helping us with recommendations or even what we wanted when we were finally ready...it was like they really didn't want to talk to us. Which maybe they didn't lol.

Anyway, food-wise, also very stereotypical...ultra greasy string beans, they were glistening under the lights and the oil pooled on the bottom of the plate. Flavor wise was okay though, and they didn't give a whole lot of veggies for the price. Crispy noodle dish was okay, not too much to say on that one...not bad, but definitely not great. We also ordered the salty fish seafood fried rice, which I liked the most. Very separated rice, not the chunky texture that sticks to each other, so depending how you like your fried rice could be good or bad. Lots of extra salty fish, which I thought made the dish a wee bit too salty, but the rest was not too bad.

Try their sweet potato fries for a healthier alternative for fries.

They came to take our orders pretty quickly despite sending them away several times because we were chatting so much we were too distracted to actually pick something to eat from the littany of menu options. Our table started with some xiao long bao and steak baos for appetizers. I didn't get a chance to try either of these, but my friends raved about them. I ordered a Thai tea with boba and the noodles in xo sauce. The food came out quickly and and everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My noodles were nice and spicy and had a great texture. There wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't enjoy. 

There are many things to love about this place. The prices were beyond reasonable, their menu selection is extensive and everything we ordered was tasty. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of the noodle soups and desserts on the menu. Great little spot I'm glad I rediscovered.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,19,15,5,at6fT8MKvcHfDq5BnBI6CA

Parking is easy since it's in the middle of a shopping center. When we came it was busy, but we were quickly acknowledged and showed to a table within a minute or two. The menu is so diverse that everyone is bound to find something they like. Everything we ordered was outstanding and I look forward to returning. I would recommend coming with a large group so you can order a lot of things and have a bite or two of everything. We came with 3 people and only got to try 3 things.",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,2,1,4,hMQzg9DkSHGN5XfuQKvYGA

The service was fast and good. It was crowded but it took least that 5 minutess for them to take our order serve drinks and we had our meals within another few minutes. Both dishes were very good and large.  The price was great and we'll definitely be back. Next time for dinner.",MgLj0LbomT596QgfMoTVPg,0,0,4,BNatK7pztSMYww2jJ3LtUg

We were surprised at how quickly we were seated, served, and how attentive the server was. We ordered Yong chow fried rice, pan fried noodles, and the calamari. Everything came in family sized portions so we actually had a lot of left overs. 

Everything was really good. My favorite dish was the pan fried noodles. Also, the calamari was not as I was expecting. It came out in bigger pieces. Overall, lunch prices were fair for the portions that were served and the service was great for the place being quite busy around the time we went.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,0GnQFLkH26pm1O3PNiGBOg
