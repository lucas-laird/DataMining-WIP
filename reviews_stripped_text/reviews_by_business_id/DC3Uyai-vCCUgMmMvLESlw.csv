The Not-So-Good: Sometimes (Not all the time!) some of the female bartenders, NOT ALL!, are too busy flirting with the gamers and their friends, that my friends and I have been put on ignore for way too long. 
We have walked in and have sat there for 5-10 minutes before being acknowledged at all. We have sat there for 5-10 minutes with empty glasses before being asked ""Would you like another?"" 
There's been times when I've had too wave my hand and say ""excuse me"" in order to get noticed and get some service, whether it be to order a drink or food.

I understand that flirting with the lonely guys to make them think they might have a shot at getting some action so they'll keep pumping $20's into the machines is part of their job but so is providing good service to everyone.
The best bartender they ever had, IMO, was Jesse. She always showed us a good time simply by laughing, joking around, and making conversation.",K3hMHY8QXe2KB08ZQM-pNQ,0,0,3,zkzIP0Kz2H1rwLd_irK19Q
182535,2014-01-29,0,DC3Uyai-vCCUgMmMvLESlw,"This review is for this one specific visit I had on Saturday 1/25/14. I used to visit Home Plate on a regular basis to watch hockey because they have good size TVs and you get your personal speaker at your table for the tv you're watching.

I have to say that I'm not a fan of the server Amber. She was not happy to be there and made every small request seem like a big deal. Obviously she doesn't remember me being a regular from before! I asked her to change the channel, and assumed she would bring me a speaker. She had a little bit of an attitude when I made the request, because apparently she wasn't ""my server"". This has been her attitude since the first time I went there.

My server (short blonde, didn't get a name) was a sweetheart. Since there were only 2 servers in the dining room and it was pretty busy with parties, I wasn't too upset that I wasn't shown too much attention. (Plus I was watching the game, so I wasn't worried about the speedy service.) The food was good and the atmosphere is always nice. Probably won't go back any time soon since I live in the northwest, especially if I'm risking having Amber as my server.",QmkyZNoC6gQUfPYeMhnQBQ,1,0,3,UcqvtQYzHPVSnrQbGr4AYg

It was fairly busy, so getting the bartender's attention was a challenge.  While I was waiting, I noticed the Lobster Zone game, which is just so depressing that I almost left before I even picked up my order.

It's too dark inside for me to comment fairly on cleanliness, but I did catch wind of an odor that I can only describe as sweaty.

As for the pizza, it was nothing special at all.  The sauce was OK, but the burnt crust and virtually tasteless toppings conspired to ruin my pizza.

Quite honestly, my last visit to Papa John's was more satisfying.  And I NEVER thought I'd say that!",AyQGp98s5BCd_JctzsOYGw,0,0,1,xJ0P8LjvEOI6gmMLG3uqOw

Tonight I phoned in an ordered the ""Famous Chili Verde burrito"" which comes with rice pilaf, corn and chips. Pretty good and pretty spicy. I wish it was a little bit warmer but other then that it was just ok I would try something else next time not to crazy about it to hurry and order it again it was about $11.99 the chips on the other hand was bomb! 

My wife got the Crispy chicken ranch wrap which she ordered it with wheat tortilla and we added bacon for $1.50 but I guess it was suppose to be a $2 add on. In the end there was only 1 maybe 2 and that's a BIG maybe stripes of bacon that we were able to fine in the whole wrap. She too said it was ok and nothing she would run back for. The fries that came with it was suppose to be season fries with season salt which was almost non existence and was very boring. It was about $10 on the other hand we have ordered the fries before with wings and they were pretty good. It might just have been an off night. Side note we checked in and got free garlic knots FREE and they we soooooo bomb!!! 

Other then the food the bar is a bar lots of smoke, dark, space to drink and eat but the food side it great for families. It is clean with games, TVs and smoke free zone. Service was not bad but not great either because I ask what the togo charge was on the receipt she had no idea. She just told me she didn't know and that it just automatically does that....ok I guess? So all in all not a bad place and I will return but there are other bars near by that I might give a go first before coming back.

Service was decent and the pizza was good enough for me to come back for some more.  The crust was thin, and the cheese to sauce ratio was on par, with good flavor.  We dined in the restaurant area, which was clean and comfortable.

My next experience was lackluster.  After work (3am), I stopped in to order take out.  The place had two other patrons at this time.  I was immediately greeted by the bartender and ordered a drink from him.  Remembering the last time I had their pizza, I decided to relive the experience.  So I ordered a pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni, to go.  My order was placed.  A few of the cook's friends stopped in to visit and were chatting for about a half hour.  The bartender said my pizza should be done in a few minutes.  Pretty long time to cook a pie, don't ya think?  Finally, my pie was boxed and in my arms, hallelujah!  I get home, my pizza is burnt to a crisp! Black!  I tried to scrape off the bottom of the pizza crust because I was so hungry.  Needless to say that didn't work to well, so after a slice and a half, my large pizza was thrown in the trash :(.  I chalked that experience up to a misfortune and realized that if I ever try to order pizza there again, check it before walking out.  No big deal.

Last night, I was in the mood for Italian take out.  I was craving penne ala vodka and mozzarella sticks.  Let's just say the mozzarella sticks were the best things my husband and I ordered.  I got my penne ala vodka and he got the baked ziti with garlic bread on the side.  My penne pasta was cooked well but the sauce was pink like it should be but...weird.  There were chunks of tomato, onion, and ham in the sauce, which is fine, but the sauce was not flattering whatsoever.  The vodka was definitely not cooked enough, leaving a bad vodka taste.  The viscosity of the sauce was also very thin.  I highly do NOT recommend this dish.  The baked ziti, was just that, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese and ricotta.  There were loads of diced tomatoes and onion in there as well.  We didn't mind the veggies in the ziti but they were raw when they were thrown in the dish, when they should've been sauteed or carmelized.  The garlic bread that was served with our dishes, was less than to be desired.  You could tell it had at once actually been a good roll that was sliced into quarters with butter and garlic, but the toasting of it made it taste like charcoal.  Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.  They were your average bar cheese sticks with marinara.

I'm sorry Home Plate, but because of these epic food failures, we will not be returning except for drinks (maybe).",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,2,1,1,eIZpUYwXJhhbq8bhcSg_NA

The waitress suggested we order a pizza or a calzone because they're supposed to be the best items on their menu, but I remembered their fettuccine being pretty good last time I went, so I ordered it again and it was delicious. The portion is also pretty big, so I had a good amount to take home this time and last. Donald was feeling a bit under the weather when we went, so he just got a bowl of cream of broccoli soup (my favorite). It was very flavorful and creamy; it definitely warmed him up a little.

First off, they're a sports bar mostly and they have SEVERAL televisions around the entire establishment with every kind of sporting event on.  I got to watch Preseason Football, Baseball and a Hockey game all at once.

Second, their smoke free dining section and bar is separated by a glass partition.  So, you can eat your food, in peace, with no musty smoke to ruin your appetite and still watch the televisions in the bar area.

Third, their food is AMAZING!  Probably the best pizza I have ever had in Las Vegas.

Fourth (and most important, in my opinion), their customer service is top notch.  The waitresses seem genuinely happy to help the customers with anything and the owner even went from table to table to ensure that guests were satisfied.

I've been looking for a Monday Night Football dive for a while to make our regular place and I think I finally have.  I'll definitely be back several times throughout the football and baseball seasons.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,8,3,5,tGZHAci1_dPqUwAKPoKafw

My second visit was last night/early this morning and my two friends & I were staarving! We came in & I don't remember them having more than one golden tee. There was two or three different versions of golden tee & the tv screens are 20 some inches big :O it looks awesome.. We wanted to play but we had to order some food first.

We shared the garlic knots & I ordered the philly cheesesteak. The garlic knots were freakin amazing, it came with marinara sauce but there was a good amount of thick garlic sauce that the knots already had on it :9 I think that by itself could make you full. The philly was really good too, lots of steak falling out of my hoagie & the fries were seasoned perfectly. The other two ordered pizzas for each of them & I didn't want to bother asking for a slice because I knew I wasn't going to finish my philly. We ended up getting tired & sleepy so we skipped out on the golden tee games & boxed up our food.

Boyfriend decided to start with the shrimp. It was overly seasoned so we sent it back. The spaghetti sauce was also overly seasoned with pepper. But at that point I was hungry and just finished what I could. Plus we had plans for the ride and we didn't want to waste the day. 

Later that afternoon while riding near Boulder Highway I all of a sudden needed to use the restroom. I thought it was just me so I didn't think anything of it. But when boyfriend started to have stomach pains also we put two and two together and found the culprit.

My group was here in the restaurant to eat some food and not watch the fight, thus got a table away from all the TVs. They still charged a $10 cover even though there was maybe 10 minutes left in the fight when arrived and no clear view of the TV. $7.50 pitchers we found were $14 after the pour. Could not get a waitress to serve us food. The lady who collected the $10 had a smart and vindictive response to everything. Bathrooms smell horrible. Maybe the worst experience on Blue Diamond? Maybe this place has a better and friendlier wait staff at non peak times? Would not recommend to anyone who wants a cheap drink and good atmosphere.

@Glen - Take things personal much? How about not mocking customers and be situational with it? If one person asked if there was a problem at the time, that would go a long way towards displaying good customer service. Just saying.",HUIJqZ7xgpMGrS4UF65hBA,3,1,1,APynOiwwQq7NratuLnK7Ww

So I used to frequent this place 3 years ago during football season.  I guess watching the games at the bar and having breakfast in the summer are completely different.

This morning was a disaster.  Firstly, there were half the tables that I remember in their smoke free dining room (extra star for this), but they were replaced by a junky buffet and lots of arcade machines. It is very family friendly (never a good combination for a successful Sports ""BAR"")

The food though, was not good at all.  I spent $27 on an inedible mess. 

Steak and eggs review: Kale, really? Kale?  So 1990s.  Salt and pepper is your friend!  The hash browns were cooked only one side and as I just said, under seasoned.  The steak (ordered medium rare) came out black and blue. The steak was cold and raw on the inside and burnt to hell on the outside. Too much oil on the steak before putting it on the grill caused it to flame up and burn the oil, rookie mistake.  The eggs (ordered over easy) were over medium (borderline over well), hard to mix with the hash browns.  Two thumbs down

Something about a ""favorite"" omelet review:  Obviously, I cannot remember the name of this dish. It was highlighted by outlining it on the menu; however, should really be avoided.   This was a tomato omelet topped with the signature chili verde.  Yuck, bad, cough, puke if you will.   The dog food on top of the omelet was horrible.  I scraped it off after my first bite.  The meat in the chili verde tasted like canned steamed stew meat.  It had no texture, sear or caramelization.    The omelet could not be eaten as it was cooked again at too high a heat and the egg scorched and after two bites; I thought the tomatoes in the omelet were old and spoiled.  By old I mean that yesterday's product was mixed with anything chopped today (that is my benefit of a doubt) for the cook who was there, but they were not tasty by any means.  The hash browns were the same as on our steak and eggs, under seasoned and not very crispy.  I didn't eat much of the meal at all.  Anything in addition to my thumbs that can be turned down, IS!

Service:  it was barely considered OK, the waitress was nice, but we were the only (did I say only?) table in the dining room for over 35 minutes.  She was not knowledgeable about the menu or what she needed to do.  She told us that she ""doesn't usually work breakfast"".  Why does that concern the guest?  I overheard the cook ask her if he ""needed to show her how to work the toaster?"" Based on his previous cooking display, working the toaster may be too much for him too!

Now, just because I myself am a server and work in a restaurant doesn't mean I'm picking on her.  She herself said to me 'am I ignoring you guys alot tonight?' ummmmmmmmm yeah!!!!!!!!! 

The little game area was ok, although the machines kept taking my money and I  had to keep getting someone to fix it.  Annoying!  

Food was ok too.  Loved the house salad.  My pizza kinda sucked, was suppose to be thick crust and was thin.  We had to ask three times for more dressing.  My mom ordered a wheat beer and she was brought ??? well it wasnt  wheat beer, so she ordered something else.  Ten minutes later, still no beer.

We got mixed results.  However, it was never great.  We get take-out a lot.  The wings are small and soggy, not crispy.  The pizza is decent but has a weird almost cookie-like textured crust, which is not to my liking.  The sauce is weird too.  I remembered I ordered a chicken breast Philly cheese steak sandwich one time and by the time I got it home, I realize it was a half a roll with two dried up pieces of chicken, some onions and peppers, and no cheese.  I usually don't get upset but I was pissed.  There wasn't a lot of fries with my order either.  $9 for a piece of stale bread and dried up meat.  We don't order from there any more.  Rounders on Blue Diamond is a little further from us but well worth the drive.

Suggesting and doing a bit extra always stands out to me.  As to pouring drinks the right way for that specific and proper taste to your beer.  To just being an overall pal.  I like the crowd here.  And I can only say that because of him the vibe for me at Home plate was on point!  I'm definitely going to continue being a regular. If you're around, or just wanting to find a chill spot, Come on down!",NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,3,2,5,CB_4Los4WcXP9zLCA4ilWQ

You can't be so worried about undercooking them that you creamate them. I like the place and the sports and my kids love it. The waitresses are typically good with them.

Also had the garlic cheese pizza with a side of marinara and that was the best $5 I ever spent. A little much on the garlic side but it was still very good and I was really hungry.

4620705,2010-10-12,0,DC3Uyai-vCCUgMmMvLESlw,"I'm a fan of this place simply because of the bartenders. My friend happens to know one of them fairly well, but looking around, it seems that they treat all of their patrons with the same generosity.

A couple of weekends ago, I watched some Sunday morning NFL here with said friend. I ordered the 2-2-2, which is your basic 2 eggs, 2 bacon/sausage, 2 pancake deal. They accidentally brought out the wrong plate, but it looked similar enough, so I just started eating it. When they realized the mistake, they brought out the right plate in addition. So basically, I was sitting there staring at way too much bacon and eggs. Needless to say, I didn't eat it all, but this is just a small example of how awesome the bartenders are. Also, when my check came out, it was less than the price listed in the menu. And I wasn't charged for my drink.

The only downside for me is that it's actually a little difficult to watch games on their screens. They have plenty of them, but they are in a variety of places that aren't always easy to see. Other than that, I definitely need to come here more often.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,17,4,4,l5TTvqvUmfoLrQbYoYc1Hw
4689720,2013-02-25,0,DC3Uyai-vCCUgMmMvLESlw,"Came here with a friend to order some breakfast- kind of weird because I didn't think that there was a bar/restaurant that would be open 24/7. 
When I walked in there were arcade games to my right- which I thought was kind of nice. Being able to bring the kids while having something to eat or a drink or two at the bar. 
When we sat down it took the waitress a while to give us the menu and serve us our drinks since she was the only server there. 
We ordered our food but ended up waiting for at least a half hour- not too bad since she was the only waitress. 

I ordered the Souvlaki breakfast while my friend ordered the three egg breakfast. 
I'm not sure if it was the cook or the food that I ordered but the chicken was not appetizing at all and had so much seasoning that I couldn't even taste the chicken. I ended up substituting the chicken for a ham steak (which came out pretty quickly). All in all the waitress was nice and the people were friendly. The food was okay but I wouldn't mind giving this place another try. 

Maybe don't order the Souvlaki breakfast next time :)",9WIeWh90iyB_tgvhe1hlWA,2,0,3,O4UDn-u0cBn7drRpmV7dxg

When I asked for my tab he told us just to leave. One of my friends tried asking him if he was actually serious (we had been joking most of the night) and he said ""yes, just get the fuck out"". If I owned this bar, I would question the sober ness of my bartenders and how they treated guests. This alcoholic took a 180 and I will never be back. This bar is close to my house and several friends go there, it's just sad this bartender couldn't handle his own drinks while working and made the entire bar uncomfortable.",8pauUILIi-w8QwcuP50viQ,0,0,1,2HO0Zt3PQceC4a-29Zt_pA

I've been here on a number of occasions and the majority of my visits happen to be when I'm 100% sober, so my palate isn't being biased. They're perfectly crisp topped with fresh garlic and parmesan (none of that pasty stuff like BWW or Hooters) and fairly priced knowing you're getting your money's worth with every wing or leg. Never tried anything else from the menu but from what I've heard, it's pretty good for bar food. As far as garlic parmesan wings goes, this place does not disappoint!

He loves the chicken parm. He's Italian and claims it's among the best he's ever eaten.  I always get the souvlaki. It tastes like a back east Greek diner. The food was great and the service is always fantastic. I highly recommend Home Plate for a local, close to home dinner. The only negative is I think it's a tad pricy for a locals place.

I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that, I just don't typically like to end my night by spilling beers in my lap like I saw some patrons doing here. There's always nice cars parked in the lot, but I don't know who's driving them.

The food is pretty gnarly, but I mean, it's bar food. It was really salty.

If you want drinks with any haste, I'd recommend going to the bar to order them. We sat in a booth and the bartender was making a point to ignore and otherwise tick off our waiter.

It's a small place, and one in a million crappy sports bars in Vegas.

Also, they were inexplicably playing ""Dancer in the Dark"" on three of their TVs. WTF? That's like one of the saddest movies of all time. It stars Bjork. Really? At a sports bar?",C2LrqqSUDPKZW1AlRcqnuQ,7,2,3,FGPNcsWGqtdqmCVJJmkg8Q

We check in for the free garlic knots.  Waitress was really quick and attentive.  In fact, she saw me on my phone and while she grabbed our drink order - she put in the garlic knots.  Our drinks never went dry.  She was awesome!  I even left her a cute note on the credit card receipt.

The hubby ordered his meatball sandwich with French fries overflowing the plate.  Awesome!!  I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken.  It comes with two pieces of garlic toast.  I started eating the toast with the Alfredo sauce...  Eating the pasta...  And after about 1/3 of the noodles are eaten, I move over to eat a piece of chicken that was mixed in with the pasta.  At first I thought it was a piece of garlic.  Nope!  It was an odd tasting piece of chicken.  Unsure but sure about the chicken, I decided to eat a piece of the chicken that was sliced on he side.  It was tough, smelled sour, and has a slimy taste.  I was done.

The waitress brought back the pasta and said that maybe the cook put lemon on it or didn't season it.  The cook had a piece and said it tasted very chicken.  What is that supposed to mean?!

I spent 1 hour praying to the porcelain gods that my stomach cramps, shakes and exploding rear end would stop.  

Will we be back?  Maybe in a few months.  Maybe in a year.  I dunno.  This might have sealed the deal on ever coming back!",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,1,0,1,Zv1W9xB1XJ0pH0X3GZfmyA

Ok, this is my favorite hangover stop and that is my excuse for not having more check ins here; I know I've been at least 8-10 times but only have one check in? will have to try harder to remember but its tough sometimes. Whenever I wake up early and want a good breakfast without a crazy crowd I come here; great wait staff and cooks; My Girlfriend liked the Bloody Mary here and we both had a blast playing ski ball and video games the last time we were there. We must have had a couple hundred tickets collected and we handed them to a little girl and her father to redeem for prizes and made her day. 

They have old bay spiced shrimp! One of only a few places in town that serve them seasoned this way and it says me a drive down to Crab Corner; I haven't had a bad meal here and have tried both breakfast and lunch.
