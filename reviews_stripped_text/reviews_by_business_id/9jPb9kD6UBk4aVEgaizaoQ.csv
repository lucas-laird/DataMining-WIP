It's like 4am so I wasn't willing to go far to get something to eat. I want something right away! My stomach hurt so badly with the hunger so I went down to this cafe downstairs to grab a bite. I got the New York steak and egg. I asked for medium well on the stead and over-hard on the egg. The food came out clean and nicely done in the way I requested. Maybe I was super hungry, the egg was just so good (it's basically just egg). They didn't over-cook or under-cook the steak. And the meat quality was good (well of course not as good as what you can get at a steakhouse, but as good as what I can make at home). In general, the food was as good as a good home cooking meal, and I was able to calm my stomach after eating. Then I went back to my room and sleep again. It's very convenient and the food wasn't expensive. I am glad I didn't have to go outside of the hotel to get cheap decent food at late night while staying at El Cortez.

I give Cafe Cortez 4 stars for a late late night option. I am not comparing this to fine dining places.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,1,1,4,cHSgNGB-WXAyqS8O7AHpAQ

161542,2013-08-07,0,9jPb9kD6UBk4aVEgaizaoQ,"After finding a parking spot at the very top of their tiny, old school parking garage, I made my way through the smoky, outdated casino into the depths of the casino floor to find the café. I believe I was in the minority age group based on the clientele I walked past, and probably the only person in the entire building without a cigarette in my hand. Café Cortez features the same bland ceiling tiles, muted paint colors and basic yet functional light fixtures that decorate the rest of the casino, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The space is quite large, filled with many 2 and 4 person tables, and probably gets pretty packed late night after First Friday. Even during my lunch time visit the place was fairly populated. The menu offers pretty much any type of food option as you would expect from your typical casino café, and serves up a pretty great matza ball soup. 

As advertised on their website I came to try their $5 burger deal, which comes with a 1/2lb Café Cortez burger, chips and 12oz domestic draught beer. What is served is basically your simple back yard burger, but really good. The char flavor was prominent; the patty was of the more generic variety but really good overall. The LTO and pickles were all fresh, the bun was basic but perfectly fine as well. In all this is nothing gourmet, but certainly better than some places that try to tout a much fancier burger, and certainly fine for $5.

I wasn't initially thrilled about getting chips over my go-to fries, but after having a few of my friends I thought twice about that. The fries weren't quite shoe string, but a little too small and not that great to accompany any burger. The chips were of your generic Lays variety, and served their purpose just fine in this case. This meal is certainly not intending to be anything fancy or out of this world, but they still make an effort to serve something of good quality and not overcharge you for it as some casinos might. This is definitely better and cheaper than what is served down the street at Binion's, and also probably more acceptable than what's served at Park on Fremont because it includes a full beer for only $5. So if you're looking for a cheap late night meal, or just an old school Vegas scene downtown, definitely check out Café Cortez.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,4,oNqemfJO8dmq-FBaixpYjA
350420,2013-04-26,0,9jPb9kD6UBk4aVEgaizaoQ,"the #1 rule of cafe cortez is ""don't look at your food, just eat it.""  

the food is not only good, it's REALLY good.  straight forward american fare (this would be a great place for euros to get a TRUE american experience).  there are some things, in particular, that stand out:
* burgers -- especially the breakfast burger
* tuna melt
* prime rib -- uneven, but tends to be more hit than miss
* motzo ball soup -- the undisputed best in town since canter's closed ... kenny epstein owns this place ... think about the kind of soup HE would want
* hash browns

there are two soups that are the best of their kind:
beef barley (monday only)
lentil (sunday only)

with the exception of anything having to do with potatoes, stay away from the vegetables (although i really like their super-soggy corn on the cob).

the entire casino floor is like a time machine into 1965.  downtown is booming, partially because of the eC's involvement with everything down there ... you better believe that sitting at the cafe cortez you're in a living museum and that entire area is just getting more and more valuable ... economics won't let it last forever ... enjoy it while you can.",xrNxg9m5v_IvOvIqF74d4w,1,1,4,43Y44bcuD8dXRoumC3F7lg

I can still remember that scene - they were all eating baloney sandwiches, egg salad and old dead wilted green beans for dinner. I had the grilled herb chicken and green beans.   The chicken was dried out and tasteless, and the green beans had been boiled way too long, and were probably frozen to begin with.  I had to ask for extra butter just to be able to get them down.  The food also took a long time to  arrive.  There was an old guy slumped over sleeping at the table next to ours, pretty danged close by.  I was worried that he was going to be ok.   The one bright spot was the busboy.  If you want to experience Bubba Ho-Tep like old folks home food, falling down sleeping old guys, and an eternity of waiting, go eat here!

936106,2014-02-02,1,9jPb9kD6UBk4aVEgaizaoQ,"I don't imagine this being a restaurant that you would go to unless you were a guest at the El Cortez hotel, or happened to be hanging around the hotel casino, got hungry, and decided you wanted to eat diner food.  In short, this place is a downscale version of Denny's.  It's not very fancy, but the food is good and cheap.  

Just like Denny's, the place is open 24 hours, and they serve everything on their menu all day.  When I went, I had the scrambled eggs (egg whites only) with homestyle potatoes and toast.  My order was supposed to come with bacon or sausage, but I'm vegetarian and declined it.  The waitress was very kind to let me have fruit in lieu of the meat.  I got my food about five minutes after I ordered it, and it tasted very similar to what I would eat at Denny's.

The El Cortez is a very low-rent hotel in Downtown Las Vegas, so don't expect to see any high rollers sitting around this restaurant.  When I was eating here, I noticed that most of the other patrons were elderly people.  I don't like to make assumptions, but most of them didn't seem like they had lots of disposable income, and probably shouldn't be hanging around a casino, gambling with money they can't really afford to lose.  But I suppose that's none of my business.

If diner food is what you're looking for, this is a decent place to find it.  If you're looking for something a little more up-scale or exotic, walk outside to Fremont Street.  There are many good restaurants within a short walk of this place.  However, I would eat here again.",n6n3RnhXjdFKxVntanRGWw,2,1,3,F8I0L5txFo63JZ1eT4zhwQ

You really can't mess up if you come here, Binion's Cafe, Magnolia's Veranda or Market Street Cafe, but as you might guess these all are found in iconic Las Vegas hotels, so tradition tends to serve up the best traditional breakfasts if that's what suits your taste.

Obviously the only reason I'll be here is cause I was partying downtown and was craving some prime rib.

It's actually a  pretty decent prime rib for the price, not amazing but satisfies the stomach like when I need to induldge in some super nachos at the end of a night of drinking. When ordering make sure you mention that you want the prime rib special for $10 cause if you don't they'll try to pull a fast one on you and charge  $15 for it, which happened to a group of us once.

I've only had their prime rib but I've seen other's order steak and eggs and some other dishes which were all about $10 and they were satisfied.

So we all got the $5 Burger and Beer deal (which is offered all day every day). Note, if you want to add cheese, it's an additional $0.50.  The meal comes with a bag of Lays potato chips and if you want to substitute for fries, then it's an additional $2. You can also substitute the beer for a soda (with no extra charge).

First of all, you can't go wrong with $5.  You can't even get a meal at McDonalds/In-n-Out/Burger King, etc. for $5!  On top of that, this was a freshly grilled burger (decent sized, I think 1/2 lb) with fresh vegetables and a beer (Bud, Bud Light or a dark, Greek beer) in a sit down restaurant.

It was good enough that we even went back the next day.  I ended up getting the Mushroom Swiss Burger the next day because I wanted fries.

This is one of those places, you can get a meal that probably hasn't changed in the last 40 years.

Their prime rib roast beef sandwich was a joke. The beef was gray and the prime rib was not prime. I really wish I just stuck to the burger or the wings. They do those items well. Do not go for their roast beef... you will be very disappointed. Their jus was watered down.

I ordered their 2 egg breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon extra crispy, country potatoes and sourdough toast.  My food came out exactly as ordered (even with extra crispy bacon which a lot of places still screw up  even if you ask for it extra crispy).  They really don't make good scrambled eggs.  I think they put the eggs in the pan (or on the griddle or whatever) and then kind of stir them up in an attempt to scramble them.  Both mornings I ended up with sections of white and sections of yellow - neverly thoroughly mixed before cooking.  Their potatoes were good (needed salt), bacon was a bit salty but cooked exactly how I like it.  Toast was also good.  Overall it's an average cafe with average food, nothing too bad.  They do have a special advertised on a board out front of the casino for a beer and burger for $5.  We were never there in the middle of the day to try that but it sounded like a good deal.  Our service was ok the first morning - the servers were more concerned with talking amongst themselves than talking to customers.  The second morning our server was very attentive and polite - we liked her a lot better.

The parking garage elevator takes you right down to the small casino floor (always seems busy- and you know this, because the parking garage was kinda crowded too).

The drink lady was quick to come by but couldn't take our order.  Five minutes later (8 min after being sat) the lady came to take the order.  Two prime rib specials medium rare.  

Both came out after FORTY minutes!!  Medium-well to well, no pink.  We sent both back. They came back again medium  (warm pink center) even after explaining that medium rare was cool red center.  We ate it any way.

Check took even longer.  The whole dinner took over 1 hour.

The manager was not willing to act as a cashier and made guests wait while the cashier was in the bathroom.  When the cashier returned the manager returned to the back room.  

I gave the cashier my debit card from a local bank and she asked for my ID.  The receipt did not print my name and the cashier proceeded to pull out a1990s imprint machine to take an imprint of my card.  When I refused to allow my debit card to be imprinted the manager was called over from the kitchen.

She said their machines had just  been updated but I still refused to have an inprint taken of my debit card.  This is ridiculous!!  It's not 1990, and you don't imprint a debit card.  She took my license information and was very rude about it.  She treated me like a criminal because HER SYSTEM was outdated.

I signed the debit card and left cash on the table for the tip. I told her she needs to learn to manage her business better.  Laycee Lewis-Caldwelll, the ""manager"", needs to learn about ticket times and customer service.  A manager does not just stand around and watch.

I was furious with the way I was treated and as a local this place can't afford to lose business from locals.",5XxElS_QM90f7t3ap9vsag,1,0,1,eBjYTRxoEerzKB7SvcmOiw

5778809,2011-07-14,1,9jPb9kD6UBk4aVEgaizaoQ,"This isn't a place I'd ever walk into on my own, and probably wont be back. My roommies grandma likes to gamble here so I brought her after the farmers market across the street. 

The staff was exceptionally nice, friendly and quick. Our server Luba was handling several tables but was still on top of things the whole time. Our busser Perfecto was also exceedingly friendly and drew me into a conversation about Hawaii.  His daughter lives there and guess he could tell I was from Hawaii somehow. So 5 stars for service!

1 star for the food. I halfed a pastrami on rye w grandma - bread was pretty stale, pastrami was REALLY salty and as you can see doesn't even look appetizing. Shoestring fries were great - fresh, super crispy and perfectly salted. Grandma was pretty happy with the short stack of pancakes she ordered at least. Only plus is that the diet Pepsi didn't taste funky like fountain diet soda so often does. And my new friend perfecto brought me a brand new glass when I asked for a refill. 

Only strike against service is that when I paid the cashier on the way out, she stopped to rub her eye for 30 sec then proceeded to grab the coins for my change with the same fingers! Pretty gross so I threw away the loose change without touching it. Luckily she had the bills in her other hand. 

The cafe was pretty full and the other customers looked satisfied. I'm sure they do a decent breakfast so I'd probably recommend it if you're in the area anyway. I may have ordered the wrong thing, but the great service really made up for a lot.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,1,3,U6kgJevvZNfK3lB_g8ZwKw
5791310,2015-04-19,0,9jPb9kD6UBk4aVEgaizaoQ,Biggest disappointment EVER!!!!  ordered the fried chicken asked for all dark meat (waiters name was desory) he said ok once bringing all the plates of food except the fried chicken plate he tells me if I get all dark meat I can only have one leg and they don't have thighs  I then asked how are you going to bring everyone else's food and then ask me if I want the one chicken leg or something else he then said it only takes ten seconds to cook the chicken I then asked if the chicken was pretty made he said well if it was fresh it would take an hour to cook  I said bull I'm a cook there is no way it takes an hour to fry chicken he should have brought that to my attention long before he brought my friends their food and should have never lied about how long it takes to fry chicken,rzVvjG60SH0mWRecW44SXQ,1,0,1,WVcKxuVM97mHGk9vRRPVzA
5838001,2015-01-27,0,9jPb9kD6UBk4aVEgaizaoQ,"My single meal here started off well with a Shrimp Cocktail composed of very good plump and large shrimps, followed by a bowl of excellent Matzo Ball Soup filled with lots of chicken.  In fact, the soup was more like an entree than an opener.  An Iceberg Wedge was also of superior quality with creamy and rich Bleu Cheese Dressing adorning the edible green edifice.  Fries were also good.  

But after this fine buildup, alas my entree of Chopped Steak that was suitably covered in onions, and accompanied on the plate by good Mashed Potatoes along with lip-smackin' tasty Brown Gravy in a small dish, arrived cooked medium well rather than medium rare as ordered.  And if the entree is subpar the whole experience is brought down a peg, as occurred on this night.    

A better cooked entree or perhaps a different choice of entree could have sustained the momentum begun with the promising initial courses.  So I will give Cafe Cortez another chance.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,2,3,Ir0laK4oqoO50qlbc1G63Q

A friend of mine had a free night with dining comps at the El Cortez so we had a stay-cation for the night. We gambled and had drinks so we decided at 1am to stop in for some grub.

I was in the mood for breakfast so I ordered a Denver omelet, hashed browns and bagel w/cream cheese. My guy ordered a chicken Caesar salad. His salad greens were limp and soggy and the chicken was that of what comes out of a container of lunch meat. 

The service sucks, the staff is clearly burned out and make it clear that they are in no mood to be friendly.

The food is not good, I could have made the same food at my condo in my kitchen way better than what they presented as meals.

My omelet was dry and brown, hashed browns were soggy and my bagel was toasted to oblivion!

I will never make the mistake of eating here again, I don't care how late it is or how convenient it is, it will NOT happen.

We only ate here because it was free using his free dining comps. 

Café Cortez, you bent me over this time, however never again!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,4,0,1,NVx6aGttX9k2s7EfYIAF6g
