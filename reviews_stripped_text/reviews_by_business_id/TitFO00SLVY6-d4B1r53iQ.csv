I love what they did with the building, but i hate how how they blast music into the streets. East Fremont used to be a place to get away from the typical tourist noise, but it seems what used to be the heart of downtown culture has died with this place. This isn't the Strip.",XkF3_q7-ZCX8xGRsWOzRSQ,0,0,3,wq1ymHOwApioMtCV2KllpA
261644,2014-01-31,8,TitFO00SLVY6-d4B1r53iQ,"I was trying to kill some time Downtown last night while waiting to meet my husband for dinner.  I stopped at The Beat to look at some vinyl, talked to some homeless guy that was standing in the middle of Fremont Street... you know, the normal Downtown Thursday night stuff.  I was on my way to grab a happy hour special or two at Park on Fremont when I noticed the new coffee shop/news stand at Inspire Theater was finally open.  So I took a chance over there instead.

The coffee shop just opened up a couple days ago and was still pretty quiet inside.  They offered a large menu of hot and chilled caffeinated beverages, as well as hot chocolate and some other drinks for those who aren't caffeine junkies.  I'm honestly not a coffee person, but will have one on a rare occasion and so I ordered a Caramel Macchiato Frappe.  A small is $5 and a large is $6.  They don't provide ounces for the sizes on their menu and since I'm not a Starbucks person I don't have anything to compare it to for you folks at home.  Sorry!

Despite being a brand new coffee place, the girl behind the counter knew exactly what she was doing and had my order ready for me in no time.  It was delicious and had plenty of whipped cream and caramel drizzle to satisfy my inner fatty.  I took a seat inside and enjoyed the expansive, bright space not known to many coffee shops.  There were magazines galore hanging on the walls and great music playing overhead (AC/DC, Van Morrison, and Pearl Jam to name a few).  This is definitely my kind of place.

The only thing that I couldn't figure out is if you can take down the magazines from the walls to read.  I guess I could have asked, but since I had a book with me I didn't bother.  I'm assuming you can (they were all current, why else would they be there?), but being new and with only a couple people inside, not one magazine was out of place.  I would feel safe saying that will all change soon.

After reading some articles online, it looks as though they will eventually have some to-go options for food available down the road.  I didn't see any of that last night.  Also, this is supposed to be a news stand with the largest newspaper selection in town.  Again, I didn't see any of that.  It's possible I missed these things, so be on the lookout for them!

A great new addition to Downtown- but like all things Downtown, it will quickly become trendy and crowded.  Get there soon before that happens!",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,16,13,4,zgK58mE5fo1_NTbaCA3xCQ

1271298,2015-09-27,0,TitFO00SLVY6-d4B1r53iQ,"This is seriously an amazing spot, I don't know much about the cafe because I have only ventured here at night. This place makes you want to keep coming back because of the great venue & crowd. If you enjoy bands, & DJs you have got it all here depending on which day it is off the week. 

Some of the things I honestly love is that you have a quiet space away from the band or DJ to sit down and talk to friends and when you decide to get up you can walk over and be closer to the DJ or Band. 

If you haven't already do check out this hidden gem. Highly recommended getting bottle service as well. Bartenders are friendly, security is on point, and there's a guy there, skinny short dude, that's seriously the best bar back I have ever seen.

Needs some quick healthy food options to be a complete cafe. The place was almost empty when I was there, which made it very comfortable, but I can see that if it was packed, it would be a pain. The coffee stand is a one-person operation, and the overall seating is good, but the comfortable cushioned seating is limited. Although many won't mind sitting on hard wood stairs, I can't do that for very long. The sofa & chairs are new enough to be comfy though. 

When the bar opens, the cafe closes, and it's probably just the designer in me, but I loved the way they shift the space from one to the other. Really cool.",O11n5wP5sq_NtxEGF6dwMA,1,1,4,7UbXvL4SnVEDtx8oJbbuhw
1476040,2015-05-02,1,TitFO00SLVY6-d4B1r53iQ,"This is hands down the coldest coffee shop I've been in- I mean that both literally and figuratively. Popped in after a 5K downtown and was freezing during my short visit, both from the inside temperature and blasting AC as well as the frosty service.

As others have said, this place has potential. It's a great location, but they really miss the (admittedly limited) morning crowd by not opening til 9PM. Their rear door is covered up by wooden fold-out doors covered with concert ads- I guess this is meant to be part of their ""industrial"" style, but it just makes the location look like it's still under construction. 

Menus are available on clipboards at the front counter. Not sure why there isn't a posted menu? Service was not welcoming (completely silent except for taking my order, they were the only employee and I was the only customer), and though the variety of magazines on display is impressive, it is unclear whether customers are allowed to read them or if they're just for purchase.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,3,3,UHzSCEdVzdNkUpC91k6zZA

1935310,2014-02-10,0,TitFO00SLVY6-d4B1r53iQ,"Good coffee and a really cool atmosphere! I was confused when I walked in because the coffee counter was in a little nook that I walked right past. I almost tried to awkwardly order from the fellow standing at the ready to print books with the Espresso Book Machine (I think that's what it is called). There is no food yet, but I think he may have implied there will be in the future. Pastry would have been an awesome addition to the caramel macchiato, which was not overly sweet.

The design is very aesthetically pleasing with Danish modern and midcentury furniture and an otherwise semi-industrial look. The magazines all over the walls call out to be perused, and there is a wooden stair/riser contraption with cushions. The layout is a bit awkward, with two-person cafe tables parked in front of couches. The space would benefit from a bit of rearrangenent to accommodate the crowd that will inevitably want to spend time here.

It makes me think of a library in the best way (I am a former librarian, so of course I love that). I was somewhat unclear, though, on whether it's cool to just loaf around and sample magazines at the tables or whether you are expected to purchase for that pleasure.

I read that there will be a pop-up bookstore nearby soon. A very welcome addition!",4i2o4rwwFe0i8V6NODcDyA,2,0,4,aEC-wQA6ZWPVLdu2DbzdZQ

The space looks really nice, I especially liked the wooden stairs with the magazine stands behind it. It has a modern and clean aesthetic to it, without being too cold. I would like some nice, comfy couches to lounge on though.

The coffee is a tad bit expensive for the size of the beverage, but it was nice and strong! The coffee is from Illy, and the mugs were designed by Pedro Almodovar. LOVE!

The first time I came here I wandered around looking at all of the magazines. They have an expertly curated selection of magazines, ranging in subjects like art ps and humanities, to domestic and foreign policy and everything in between. FYI, they magazines are for purchase (I had to ask!). I could've bought five, they all looked so pretty and  interesting, but they were kind of expensive. BUT I want to say that some might be small, independent little magazines publishers, so you'd be helping a local publisher (by local I mean U.S.). Next time perhaps. May I suggest they try carrying David Chang's glorious venture Lucky Peach? That would be a hit with Yelpers.

I am most excited about coming to the cafe during the day, those big windows are just screaming to let the sunshine in and illuminate the area and inspire future playwrights and poets. And lo and behold, they have a printing press! 

Definitely a must for any visit to the DTLV area to hang out or wait for a show upstairs at the Inspire Theater.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,3,4,4,BqGozoNEFwBeZGQ8I7Kg6g

  In the heart of Las Vegas, Inspire beats to a different drum. Inspire News Cafe is exactly at the epicenter of downtown Las Vegas at the crossroads of Las Vegas Boulevard (becomes the Strip) and Fremont Street. Inspire News Cafe is different from the coffee shop competition by also serving as a newsstand destination and the only spot in Las Vegas offering an espresso book machine. 

   Where a Seven Eleven and a couple of businesses once stood, Inspire News Cafe is a symbol of the revitalization that is transforming the Fremont Street East into an entertainment and cultural district. In the heart of Las Vegas you might say Oh Thank Heaven there is no 7-Eleven. 

   In the crossroads of Las Vegas, a couple of Saturdays ago, I decided to meet up with my brother in Inspire. This makes for a nice spot to meet up with people near the Fremont Street Experience before 7 pm. Inspire is a unique spot to hang out in. When I walked inside Inspire, it was like walking into one of the theater  I recently reviewed in Chicago. It makes sense because this is also Inspire Theatre where upstairs there are shows. So, the diminutive stand where I ordered my cup of Illy coffee reminded me of a theatre ticket counter. In the room to the right is where the action took place. Apparently there wasn't much action. It was sparsely occupied. Regardless the room was interesting. How many coffee shops do you know of that have benches with pillows and a disco ball on the ceiling? How many coffee shops do you know of where the center feature of one of the walls is an ATM and HD TV? This is an interesting room to drink a cup of Illy coffee and just take in the scenery. Hanging from the walls are racks that display the sundry of magazines for sale. The list of magazines from National Geographic to Rolling Stone is commendable. The magazines for sale are incorporated in the interior design. There is a variety of furniture from couches to tables to chairs. From the window this is a spot to watch the people walking along Fremont Street. Sometimes there would be rowdy people walking along Fremont Street that would tap on the window. There is definitely a Fremont Street presence that adds to the experience of being in this unique place. Then there was the staircase leading up to the closed off second level that created a sense of mystique to the experience. It was a similar feeling to being inside the Oatman Hotel and looking up at a closed off second floor. Was it haunted? The closed off second floor that had my curiosity running in overdrive is a theatre, gateway to a rooftop bar, theatre, and lounge during certain times. Hopefully I get to see it soon because I am still curious. 

   What I failed to observe, probably because it might be upstairs is that Inspire has the distinction of having the one and only espresso book machine in Las Vegas. This is a machine where you can cut, print, and bind a paperback book on demand. Or you can cut, print, and bind your very own paperback or coffee table book. How cool would it be to print all of your Yelp reviews then go here have a cup of Illy's Coffee then walk to the espresso book machine to cut, print, and bind your very own coffee table book of Yelp reviews or anything that you have worked on? This is getting my curiosity running in overdrive again. I am adding half a star for an environment that sparks curiosity. 

   Inspire is a unique contribution to the beat that keeps the energy of the downtown Las Vegas scene running. This is a distinctive place to drink coffee and possibly create your own paperback.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,10,3,FeA1GdNKLxrHREdq-Rkx_w

There is a small.  repeat, small coffee stand just in the hallway of the cafe.  Although the website says they have snacks and grab and go items, I didn't see any, nor was anyone manning the coffee stand.  If they had little protein lunches like other chains or mini sandwiches, I would have stayed instead of wandering out to Freemont.  

Still, this is a different place than your usual coffee shop and for Freemont Street it is quite unique.  I hope it does well and stays.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,4,1,3,3C8x2jKrs5oFCiezJwMqbg
