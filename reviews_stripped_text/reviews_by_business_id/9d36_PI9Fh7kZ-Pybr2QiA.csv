157033,2015-01-08,1,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"GREAT ESTABLISHMENT TO HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS BUT CAN OFFER BETTER SERVICE

I order take out from this place often. In the beginning, I was receiving great service and tipping on every take out order but lately it has been very non-chalant.  In fact, there was a mishap with my last to go order. I picked up my order and the lady I had to interact with was rude and careless with my to go bag. I had to rearrange my to go bag before entering my car because my food containers were already leaking. So, as I was doing that, I discovered I had no utensils and napkins which wasn't a problem. I understand people forget things- we're human. But, then I notice a plastic bag inside my to go bag and it was my pita bread! Yes, the pita bread was served to me in it's original wholesale plastic bag. You know, the same plastic bag that bread from a grocery store comes in. Now, my past to go orders had my pita bread in foil which kept it very warm and this pita bread in the plastic bag was warm but getting cold. So, I went back inside to get utensils and napkins and to ask about the pita bread. When I get inside, I asked the server for utensils and napkins and she had an attitude that I even asked. So then I asked her if my pita bread was at least warmed up because I couldn't tell with it being in a plastic bag and she replies back by saying yea.... So I thought, wow maybe this is normal to receive bread like this because she never seemed surprised that it was being served to me, the customer, like that. I'm even thinking, maybe this is an old school way of doing things. I don't know. I just thought it was odd. So I called up the place and spoke to Reen and she said that wasn't normal and offered to take care of my next order...

So I called today to place an order with Reen and advised her that I was on my way from work and wanted my roommate (who also places to go orders time to time) to pick it up for me and she was fine with that. Well, when I got home I was not welcomed with a happy camper. My roommate looked annoyed and irritated. Apparently, there was a new girl who was there who was also rude... This new girl advised my roommate that the order was free of charge and my roommate thanked her and asked for change for a 20 dollar bill. And the girl takes the 20 and gets Reen and Reen comes to the cashier area to tell my roommate that it was free of charge. And my roommate told her that all he wanted was change for the 20 dollar bill. As Reen was getting change for my roommate the original lady that I personally had to interact with from the to go mishap comes up to the cashier area and says ""this is free of charge right?"" ............................  
And then my roommate tells me that the worst part was he witnessed the servers talking about him while he was leaving the establishment from a reflection. So, I respond to my roommate and said it's ok we won't go to that establishment again. And then I take the bag from him and open it up and of course NO UTENSILS NOR NAPKINS.... *rolls eyes*

392079,2013-08-03,1,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"Some places are worth a second chance:

Lately I have been stopping by the Olive hookah lounge on Sunset. It is a great place for hookah and to hang out. 
The hookah is on par, it doesn't get harsh too quickly and tends to last a while (which is a plus) and for the most part the ""coal guys"" come around frequently to check if the hookah is good for coals, if it is too harsh, etc. The alcohol and food is reasonably priced and good. My favorite thing on the menu so far is the Lebneh which is a type of Mediterranean yogurt dip that's ridiculously good! The hummus is great and I heard their version of a grilled cheese is good too. The chicken shawarma is just okay, sometimes the chicken tends to be over cooked and dry and the seasoning is lackluster, they should think about getting the recipe from the cook at the Almaza Hookah Lounge for how to cook chicken. 
The DJ nights are really cool and the Wonder Ground is a good time for mini magic shows. They have a belly dancer would is their resident dancer and she is great! The only day I would say to avoid is Sunday because they have a singer that sounds like he is gargling water and sometimes they ask for a cover to listen to this guy. 
My final comments:
I would say is the servers are great, attentive and friendly the owner, Mona, first off should take notes from her staff on customer service because she reminds me of Raz from Monster's Inc. you know, ""Don't forget to file your paperwooork"" ...she is typically DRY and RUDE. I would like to also mention that if you are going to the Olive I would recommend wearing clothes that you are planning to wash or burn (just kidding) because it's kind of like subway...there is an Olive-Stench that tends to linger on your clothing if you are planning on staying a while. Soak, Wash, Dry, Repeat.
Other than that, the place is all around a good time, great atmosphere, and a great hangout spot for hookah and drinks.",DeVGYEz5dMJOXasYeemNUQ,1,1,4,pfkiv4RuAsc5DhGSSv3Sng

I came in all of the time and got Candyland flavor, which is delicious, an recently have actually been hanging out and smoking hookah here more recently. I decided to write a review hoping management would see it and make some changes to better their business. 

First if all, Cuzzins tobacco is blah. It isn't bad tasting, it just seems to lose flavor really fast compared to ANY other brand i have smoked. (Which is practically all of them..) I know its their ""signature"" flavor, so there isn't much else to say here. 

Service is what brought them down a star from the 5 they would have gotten originally. More times that's not, I have to actually get up and go ask for my check or a new hookah due to the fact they rarely come check. They do at first, but it tapers off near the end of your visit. Many times I come in during the least busiest times and I still have this problem. The servers are amazing and extremely friendly, but they could check up on you're frequently. 

As for atmosphere, it is truly a beautiful lounge. Plenty of seating, amazing decor, and ambient music all make it a delight to
lounge at.

Quickly searched for other mediterranean places nearby and called Olive to find out if the place was open. The guy on the phone seemed very friendly and asked me what I would like to order and he could have it ready for pickup. I asked him if I could taste the chicken before ordering it and he said that would be fine. I am a new and very reluctant chicken eater in my quest to eat more protein so based on this info, I decided to head over to this place.

The billing desk was swamped with several waitresses, and yet it took me a few minutes to request for someone's assistance and look at the menu. It took even longer to get someone to take my order.  The girl I spoke to, told me that they did not have sample options and I could not taste to see. I understood but told her about my phone convo few minutes ago with someone at their restaurant. She went to get an older lady who was possibly the manager or something, Mona. The woman told me that they could not me taste anything as they need to prepare big batches of food for each order seperately. Her tone seemed condescending and even though I was ready to walk out of the place, I decided to order the chicken na na as they told me it was good.
The chicken na na was supposed to be a tender marinated chicken served with lettuce and tomato and house garlic sauce. I asked for the dish without the pita bread, to take out. Now, I may be wrong here but I think I read the price as 6.95 but the waitress charged 8.95 plus tax for this.

The only thing worth mentioning in the dish was the garlic sauce in a yogurt base and it was pretty good. The chicken was dry with what seemed like herbs and spices thrown over. There was nothing tender about the chicken and I ended up taking a few bites and wasting the rest.

Cannot comment on the ambience as I took my order to go. They could seriously benefit by having a few customer oriented staff members and improving the quality of food.

I had the garlic pita with a cucumber yogurt dip that was fantastic, a five star dish and a spicy chicken sandwich that was served quesadilla style with rich spicy Mediterranean spices, a three and a half star dish. The waitress was pretty exotic looking and was very attentive, greeted me, kept the water full and even gave me some extra pitas in case the garlic was too strong for me (it wasn't, I was in garlic heaven!). There were a lot of characters in suits walking around behind the bar and in the lounge that gave it a great flavor, and there's some pool tables next door that made me want to come back after work.

The staff is wonderful and accommodating. Sunday nights is a MUST because they have belly dancers for an Arabian-themed night. Next time we are in LV, a reservation will be made.

It would have been nice if she had told me they didn't have coffee and would I like something else instead of ignoring us.) but the guy who tended the hookah and the other servers running around made up for it.

 No one greeted me when I walked in so I seated myself. There was plenty of seating as it was not busy at 8:30 pm. After my friends arrived we ordered drinks, hookah and food.  An older woman came up to me as my friends were in the middle of eating our dinner and smoking hookah and rudely asked us to move. I told her no we are in the middle of eating, why would you ask us to move after we had been sitting here for 30 minutes waiting for our food?  She got angry with me and actually told me that i just sat myself anyway and shouldn't have. There were plenty of empty couches and tables available.

This was the first time I have ever been treated like that at the olive! My friends and I felt very uncomfortable for the remainder of the evening because this woman was clearly pointing at us and talking about us to other employees and making comments to us every time she passed by.

1420409,2016-05-23,11,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"The majority of good reviews are based on the nightlife.
The majority of poor reviews refer to the service.
My experience was in line with both.

First attempt: Didn't realize they weren't open for lunch, so when I called in for takeout, employee stated they weren't open yet. Rearranged my day and called back to order dinner, then was told that they didn't have food ready yet, then that they didn't do takeout. It was such a headache I felt like they just didn't want to do it, at 5PM on a weekend. Went elsewhere.

Second visit: Got over the first experience and decided to go in person. The bouncer smoking, eating, and checking IDs at the door set an uncomfortable tone and seemed entirely unnecessary. Waited at hostess stand for over five minutes, never acknowledged or approached. Seated ourselves at a couch, then was never approached for food, drinks, or hookah. Tons of servers, all hanging out and talking or just checking on the same couple of tables. Dancers and musicians were great, but I came to eat dinner... so we left and went elsewhere.

Third strike: Came in earlier in the evening, before the entertainment. No bouncer, yay. Hostess was actually doing her job, cool. But again, servers wandered around talking to each other and didn't seem to have any interest in customers. We were given drinks but had to ask for menus, took her a good 10 minutes to bring them by, didn't seem to want to take our orders... I'm over it. I've spent three times as much at nearby restaurants because they just don't want to take and make orders.

At this point, they should just shorten the name to The Olive and be a bar/lounge with live entertainment rather than consistently half-assing the ""Mediterranean Grill"" portion of the business.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,13,2,MbQjEy2FgvQQWzpY1pT-sQ

There is a separate area for those who are just eating... so if you're worried about the smell of smoke, it isn't really crazy in here. Once you go into the lounge area, it's a different world. Still, not to smokey... but the mood definitely changes. The lighting is more dim (windows have darker curtains, so it's not crazy sunny) and the seating screams ""RELAX!"" There were 3 tvs (at least) for you to watch if you show up alone - as I did.

The hookah itself hit nice...the flavor was a little, off, from what I'm used to. I didn't ask what brand they served... I will have to next time. They may have multiple brands. They use the washable hoses...which I'm noticing a lot of establishments are switching to. I must have stopped in for a happy hour because with a bottled water, my total was only $12 when I had read the hookahs were $14. I was there before 4p on a weekday - so keep that in mind. :)

1648013,2017-03-31,2,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"This review is for the food/grill only! I have not patronized the Hookah Lounge.. But upon walking in and ordering, I encountered quite a few problems.

On Wednesday 3/29 - I ordered 1 Chicken Wrap (Chicken NaNa), 1 order of Stuffed Grape Leaves, and a 1/2 order of Tabouleh and that came out to $20.

They automatically charged my card an 18% tip, pushing my to-go order to almost $30. ($27.56) was what was charged to my card. Not that I wouldn't have tipped but they didn't ask, they didn't give outstanding customer service, and I still waited about 15 minutes for my ""to-go"" order. The hookah lounge and dining area are not separate so I ended up waiting in a smoke filled area even though I didn't want to partake in that part of the restaurant.. they should stop trying to say it's separate because it is not. 

I left, took the food home, which was for my 15 year old daughter that had been wanting Greek/Mediterranean food. When she opened it, we discovered that the STUFFED GRAPE LEAVES WERE FROZEN! Fresh Mediterranean, I think not! But my daughter was like, ehh no big deal, popped them in the microwave and warmed them up. I said, well okay that's fine but I'm still going to call them tomorrow to let them know that the supposed fresh grape leaves were FROZEN. 

Thursday 3/30 - I called and I spoke with a manager buy the name of Nicki, she was polite and ensured me that they do not freeze the stuffed grape leaves.. BUT that she had heard a similar complaint, and was gonna go back in the kitchen and check the refrigerator. Great! Thank you for not being rude, and for actually trying to solve the problem! She also stated that if I could come back in, she'd not only replace the Grape Leaves, but also the Chicken Wrap for the inconvenience. I thanked her, gave her my name, and said I'd come another day. 

Friday 3/31 (TODAY) - I told my daughter that the Mediterranean place would replace her grape leaves and sandwich if she wanted to go in. I told her to give them my name and to also let them know she was the one that had originally ordered the food and experienced the FROZEN GRAPE LEAVES. The first cashier, said oh yeah, I remember talking to your mom, let me go back and get your items replaced.. out of nowhere a mad woman by the name of ""Lisa"" claiming to be the owner/manager starts CUSSING at my 15 year old daughter, calling her a ""fu**ing liar!"" and a ""fu**ing bullsh*tter"".. screaming that she doesn't serve frozen food.. and how dare she say her food was frozen.. and that she wasn't replacing a damn thing. The cashier proceeded to stick up for my daughter, and managed to at least get her the grape leaves.. my daughter walked to the car in tears with Grape leaves in her hand and said Mom, the lady cussed me out, I don't even want these, and I never want to eat here again.. 

Needless to say, it took everything in me to not go back into that restaurant and come across that counter and beat the crap outta that woman!! Who are you that you can't take some criticism on your FROZEN ASS FOOD?! Worried because someone is exposing that your ""Fresh Mediterranean Grill"" may not be so damn fresh?! In all honesty it was probably a fridge situation, especially if someone else complained about the same thing. Learn to check your temper, and don't scream and cuss at your customers or their kids. After this post I am calling the Better Business Bureau, and whatever other agency there is in Nevada that regulates places such as this, just because I can. And you hurt my child's feelings. And because if I did come in there and confront you, I'd probably be arrested! 

Thank you to the cashier that took my call, and that tried to help my daughter. Your customer service is highly appreciated, sorry you have to deal with a maniac like that!",ftNEIPXN0C8dSf7ZJBEacA,3,1,1,DMMA8Cm_hjnazQmNCR6P5g

Walked in the front door and immediately thought it was weird. A few empty tables. Then there was the party room that was being decorated for the New Years festivities. There was no host, no designated server, just people walking around and preparing the place. Decorations for a balloon drop at midnight and the DJ stage. According to one person who worked there, it was sold out.

The place was empty but I felt like I was intruding. ""Well, you can sit in there but we're getting ready for the party."" Uh, it's 6:30 already and there wasn't a soul in there. Finally, she agreed to seat us where we wanted, right in the middle of it all. I didn' t want to be in a boring room with no action.

Food was OK, nothing great. I had a Greek salad that was satisfactory. The server ended up being friendly and willing to answer questions about the menu and the plan for the evening. We weren't invited however.

So, if you're planning and preparing for a party and you don't really want to hassle with any patrons, then lock the door. I wouldn't have been insulted had you been closed.

We came for dinner and  didn't sample the hookah, so I can't comment on that. J had the chicken shawarma and enjoyed it, especially the yogurt sauce that came with it. It was still under $10 and enough for two meals, so that's a plus. I had the chicken nana, which I felt was a bit too dry. It had a nice spice rub but I pilfered some of J's yogurt sauce and that made a huge difference. My sandwich was also big enough to save half for lunch the next day, so I had a happy lunch at work. 

Yay for Almaza! They also serve a drink called the ""mediterranean islands"" that is killer. It's pretty sweet but it does the job. Turkish coffee is another thing worth mentioning.

Being in the industry we completely understand but at least tell us don't be shady about it. We ordered a bunch of food and drinks .We even bought a shot for the musicians which by the way only saw 3 on stage and had 4 shots on our bill.

When you order ""The Olive Mediterranean Combo"" you get bottomless fresh warm pita bread, hummus, tabbouleh, baba ghanoush, yogurt salad, feta cheese, cucumbers, kalamata olives and grape leaves wrapped around rice and meat. The combo is $15.95 but can easily be split between 2-3 people. I also like to order the garlic pita which comes slightly toasted and they don't skimp on the garlic. 

Just take a look at the delicious looking pictures and go ahead and plan your next lunch here!

If you are interested in live music or hookah they have an extensive seating area to the left of the restaurant with a nice hookah menu and they also offer some interesting sounding beverages: like the blue bazooka, bunny bomb, cookie monster, surfer on acid and tons of others I would have to order an  Uber home if I were to try!",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,9,9,4,0G8ths1mY-s2m6tGPaUZ6g

The lazy ass security will come over exactly at closing time to kick u out. Dumped out the hookah literally as I was smoking it telling me I need to leave. Very rude.

A small group of us came last Friday evening and I absolutely loved the vibe here. They were playing the best throwback jams too! If you're looking for a chill and low key place to hang out, this is the spot!

There's lots of seating and we were lucky enough to snag a small table surrounded by comfy couches. From what I've heard, this place can get extremely crowded, especially on the weekend!

The staff is very friendly and the service is great. One of the hostesses recommended the Godfather shisha and it was amazing. If you're not sure what to choose, look no further. They always made sure our coals were hot and our drinks were filled!

If you want to snack on something while smoking, the appetizers are delicious. My personal fav was the Falafel and Baba Ghanoush. The Falafel was so crispy and flavorful! As for the Baba Ghanoush, I'm definitely no fan of eggplant, but this, this is a different story. You must try it! Perfect for dipping the warm pita bread.

We went to The Olive tonight, party of 5 on 3 separate checks.  Right off the bat we understand for parties of five or larger there is an automatic 18% gratuity. No problem! We enjoy the awesome food, the fantastic entertainment (Barry Black is amazing!) good drinks and excellent service. 
Our check comes and our gracious waitress explains that we can pay however we choose, they only held our card and did not charge it.  I review the bill and a stamp that says GRATUITY INCLUDED was stamped across the check.  After looking at the bill I ask the waitress what the additional $15 charge was, she replies...the gratuity. Apparently they charge you tax then the 18% gratuity on the taxed amount and then round up to the nearest dollar.  Our REAL total was $68 and some change and after tax came out to $74 and some change.  The ""I'm only the manager and this is what my updated register said"" insists that they ""ALWAYS"" round up and it is only a few cents.  
Averaging that this place is always busy, rounding up and charging an 18% gratuity puts this ""family owned business"" up a few hundred dollars a night.  If your hard earned dollars mean something to you, CHECK YOUR BILL.  
P.S. I left a 25% gratuity just to prove that it wasn't about the auto-grat but the principle.  If I altered a guests check I would be fired immediately!",-CYCBZZSEDADzm5M5O9xyA,1,0,1,kU0Pcev9ONcIfQFdduRZZg

2796266,2018-04-01,0,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"The Olive has such great potential.  My girl and I went last night and have a few thoughts.  The music was great, really digged the live music. We had hummus, and a hookah and those were both great.  What brings this place down is the staff.  The first thing I notice walking through the door is 3 giant bouncers sitting in the cafe part of the place.  I can understand maybe needing a bouncer, but 3? And they weren't like manning the door, they were sitting at a table.  So this place is so bad you need 3 giant bouncers?  What happens in here?  But ok whatever.  The hostess asks if we have reservations, no we just stopped in, and she walks us to small table,  great didn't know we needed reservations but great. She wasnt super friendly though.  The waitress comes up and hands us a tattered menu and coldly asks what can we start? We explain we've never done a hookah and it's our first time here what does she recommend and we'll start with just water.  We go with her recommendation for the hookah and she never recommended food or a drink.  The hookah comes and they out the coals on top and I ask a couple questions.  The guy, who looks lost just shakes his head. We realize he doesn't speak English.  Ok great, no prob we just won't ask that dude any questions. The place begins to fill up a couple sits next to us and our waitress explains its Arab night and explains some things to them. Why didn't we get that?  But no worries I just listened in to know what's happening.  A couple gets seated at the couches on the other side of us and their waiter, well their waiter high fives them, is smiling and in general good spirits that one might associate with a hookah lounge. That couple is having a completely different experience to us and those with the waitress serving us.  Some time goes by we are smoking and drinking our waters, we decide to order food, just some hummus. Our waitress essentially ignores us, even though I'm trying to grab her attention,  so I grab the waiter. He says I'll grab your server, who is standing right behind him and he disappears and then she disappears not even looking in our direction.  She come back, ""you want to order something""?  I'm thinking to order you a personality, is what I thought. Now, they have several different hummuses and I say I'm thinking some hummus which one.... and she leaves. Doesn't explain the differences or if it comes with anything nothing. Cuts me off and leaves. She arrives back with the hummus and my soda. Doesn't say a word when she deposited the food and drink on the table and leaves again.  Meanwhile, the waiter with the couple on the couches is still high fiving the couple smiling, joking with them is ever present and attentive to that couples experience. Some more time goes by, and our waitress comes back, ""everything ok""? And before I could ask for refills, or comment on the food she splits.  Doesn't even let me answer her.  It's nearing closing, it's 1230 and they close at 1.  Suddenly she appears with the check.  By this time my girl had decided she wanted a shot.  The waitress deposits the check on the table and I go oh we are gonna order a shot. She seems put out by that and snatches up the check and says ""what do you want""?  What do I want?? I want someone who wants to be at their job that's what I want.  Anyway, she returns with the drink and the check again. And, then comes back a few minutes later asks if the check is ready.  Now, she's barley paid any attention to us the whole night, yet when she wants the money suddenly she's paying attention?   I say no it's not. It's now about 115am.  The music does down, one of the bouncer starts pulling hookahs off tables and she returns. I give her the check, not a hope you had a great time, how was everything, hope to see you again no kind of interaction at all.  I leave no tip.  

The waiter who was great is talking with the people he had been serving and I grab him, he what's your name, Vico, you were really great, our waitress was terrible, I can see you actually care about people's experience and if we come back we want to request you.  You're great. He says I'm so sorry you had that.  A man, hears me complimenting the dude and he says hey thanks it's always great to hear ""my employees"" doing good.  And I tell him about how awful the waitress was, no personality and how different of an experience those with Vico had.  He apologized but seemed to know that was the case.  

So in summary, I like the place. It has really great hummus, and the vibe is great too.  The service, is inconsistent and if you are on the lower side of the service, you're gonna have a terrible experience, if you have one of the good servers, you're gonna have a great time.  So 2 stars and ZERO tip as we were in the low end of service.

I took 2 of my girls here last Monday night and, as usual, it was spot  on.  Barry was in his usual form (loved his rendition of Corrinne Bailey Rae's ""Like A Star""...and his version of Marvin Gaye's 'Sexual Healing"" was brilliant); and the food was still great (the lentil soup had a wonderful tanginess this time -- loved it!).

At one point, one of my girls started tearing up... and, no, it wasn't b/c of Barry's melodious voice.  Rather, the hookah smoke was really getting to her.

2894185,2016-05-31,0,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"Oh, The Olive... I have a loooong history with this place that goes back many years. My best friend was a regular at this place (before he passed away), and was the one that introduced me to it. In fact I used to do open mic nights back when they first started doing that, before the expansion. It's definitely an intimate, family-run type business where if you're a regular, they all know you in that ""Cheers"" sort of way. From the coal guy (who I still only know as 'cousin', to Mona the owner, a lot of the same faces have been here for a long time.

It was my first experience with Hookah that happened here, and I have yet to find another place as consistent as them when it comes to having great, well mixed bowls, as well as very good authentic hummus. While it's been a loooong time since I'd been back (especially since I don't live in Vegas anymore), luckily when I decided to visit again, it was a good experience thanks to the great service and well made hookah. Some of the old-timers can be very hit or miss, especially with the owner, Mona. (Again, if you're a regular, she'll greet you with a friendly smile and hug. If not... There's times where she can be... Let's say, a bit rough around the edges :/). But with our server that night, Bianca, it was a great experience. Even though it was kind of busy that night, you could tell she was working her ass off running around and was super attentive to us, and was patient to explain the pricing and menu changes to us.

I think The Olive is just one of those places where you can end up having a really great experience, or a really bad one depending on who you get, but at least with our server that night, it was a nice little homecoming. So if you ever do decide to stop by, just keep an open mind, ask for Bianca, and don't piss off the owner. Best advice I can give haha. It's changed a lot through the years, but a consistent product and great service while you're there definitely keeps you coming back for more.

We started with martinis and the appetizer sampler. The martinis had waaaay to much vermouth. We mentioned something to our server and she said it looked like the bartender over did it when she watched him make them. It made me laugh. They quickly changed our drinks with out a fuss. The food here is very casual. You're not going to find a pretentious or over dressed plate on the menu. The appetizers do seem to be a touch better than the sandwiches and plates. The food isn't what makes this place. The band and hookah are. 

The hookah prices look like they've gone up a touch from some other reviews, but it's still amongst the best deals in town for hookah. We tried the Yahalla at the recommendation of our server, but saw some really interesting combos. I'm going with ""The Crazy Mexican"" next time. It's blueberry, pumpkin, and mint. I can't wait. 

The band came on about 8:40 and really delivered. I'm not sure that they would be successful in a lot venues, but they really work at The Olive. We we're highly entertained!

made us a litte akward but oh well we moved.

3258377,2012-08-21,0,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"I'm going to start off by saying that this review is pretty much exclusively for the service. I have been here several times with my boyfriend (we have never had a service issue until now) and the hookah is always good, the drinks are so-so but reasonably priced and I absolutely LOVE the decor. However, after last night, I'm not sure I will ever patronize this place again. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. 

My boyfriend and I were meeting up with his uncle and friend who were already there. When we got there, we needed to be moved to a bigger table since they were sitting at a two seat one. It took us 5 minutes to get the waitress to come over, despite that there were only three other small groups in the place. When she did come over, she rolled her eyes and made a snarky comment about us moving table (the only thing we had was a hookah that needed to be moved...and she put us at the next table over so I would think that wouldn't be a big deal).

After we moved, she disappeared for 20 minutes. When we were finally able to get drinks, she disappeared for another 45 minutes (this is not an exaggeration either). 

During the whole visit, this server made us feel like we were inconveniencing her by being in her breathing space when we asked her for anything. Her attitude made the whole group uncomfortable every time she would come over and, though we had intended to get some dinner as well while we were there, we finally got tired of being scared to ask her for anything so we just requested the bill. When we nicely asked her to split it (and I was being beyond patient at this point. I'm not someone who loses my temper with servers), she gave us a disgusted look and took an incredibly short, nasty tone with us but ultimately did it. 

This was, no embellishing, the worst and rudest service I have ever received in my life. My boyfriend and I were more than happy to leave and go across the street the Blue Fin, where they were more than happy to have our business.",ZD3_a2-bcugIQfh_0rWqIQ,4,0,1,tjMfmcVRNp_ZKFCCk3My4w

3303863,2013-02-26,2,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"Well I am pleased to report things have changed since my last review - and changed for the better!

I complained about the hookah and service last time, but they have really upped their game. What used to be inconsistent hookah has really become more uniform. They switched to coconut coals which has made a huge difference. The hookahs are much smoother and last longer. Check out some of their custom mixes, candyland is my fave.  Plus they are on top of providing new coals when needed. 

The party atmosphere has improved greatly in recent months. There is something going on almost every night: live bands, bellydancers, magic shows you name it. The place does get loud but thankfully there are multiple rooms if the volume is too much for ya. 

On a side note: ask for Bladen, one of the best servers there! Always on point with re-fills and recommendations.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,4,0,5,wL4KTOKOBrDt-1znQbTeUA

There's plenty of seating.  It's a big hookah lounge; however, the waitress was really slow.  She wasn't very attentive at all, and I had to raise my hand a few times to get her attention.  When she noticed me the first time, she told me she would be right back because she had to help the ""VIP"" section.  She could've just told us that she will be right back instead of saying that the VIP section was a priority.   We are still customers too paying to be there!  

I've been to other hookah places where the servers were attentive to us and making sure that our hookahs were working at all times.  Not this place.  I think the guy who brought us the hookahs only came once.

We had heard so many great things about this place so we were so excited to finally try it out. When we arrived, we were seated at a small table that didn't have enough chairs for our entire party so the hostess said she would go grab 2 more chairs. She never came so we grabbed chairs from some corner table across the lounge. 

Our waitress came by and we asked for water, since you know its 100 something degrees outside and as soon as we said it she cut us off and said ""There is a $25 minimum and if you're not gonna meet that you're gonna be moved to the cafe."" WE HAVE LITERALLY BEEN HERE FOR 5 MINUTES?!?! How can we order if we were never even given a menu??? 

Once she brought those menu's she didn't return another 30 minutes. She gave us attitude every time we asked a question. Fast forward, we have been at the lounge for about 2.5 hours and our coals were completely burnt out. We asked the waitress if she could send someone to change our coals since they had not been changed once. The guy with the coals proceeds to change EVERY tables coals around us except ours. I flagged him down and all he could do was roll his eyes.

The greek salad was pretty good but the tiramisu was still frozen, we had to let it thaw out at our table for about 15 minutes.

Overall, service was horrendous. Food and hookah were eh. Wouldn't recommend anyone here.",Z0VqsrgbShf7tQxkE1bFvA,2,0,1,iO5ggwomTMfEA0GoVq-BfQ
3394536,2017-03-06,0,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"This is one of my favorite hookah places in Vegas. The ambience of their main room is killer. It is decorated beautiful in a Moroccan theme/India theme with comfy couches and chairs. There are special cabana like tables on the side with veiled canopies to accommodate larger parties. It is dimly lit with a gentle red glow and lasers that don't distract but add. The room is large, but creates a nice intimate setting for you and your friends. 

The hookahs are reasonably priced and last a long time. They have a wide array of flavors, and use regular coal, not the self-starting kind. 

The service is great, depending on your server. And sometimes they can be slow to keep up on your hookah, but they are all super nice and will jump to help you if you ask them. There is a server named Nicki who has been there for years, and she is my favorite because she is like your brash diner waitress who will harp on you for just getting water, but she is incredibly endearing and I love when she is working. 

The food is good, but unremarkable. I go here for the ambience and the hookah, but their hummus and falafel aren't bad if you are looking to munch. The pita isn't my favorite. 

They often have live entertainment as well, either a band or a hafla with belly dancers. The entertainment can be loud though, so if you were looking for some time just to be with friends, go during the time their isn't entertainment. That being said, the entertainment has always been amazing with talented folks.",uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g,0,1,5,X6PQIck4BPxmwzW_weirSQ

Interesting to note that Olive did deliver to her place (her place is a short distance from the restaurant but still, kudos for that)....I believe the cost came up to be somewhere around $10 per person which is highly reasonable.

We had bowls of Baba Ganoush (the best I've ever had), Yogurt and Cucumber Dip, Hummus, Tahini, Tabouleh Salad, jaw-dropping tasty grape leaves stuffed with rice and Falafel Sandwiches (wrapped in pita really). All extremely fresh and yummmm. 

I'm definitely a fan of their catering in addition to their Monday night music, comfy lentil soup and delectable Falafel Sandwiches.

3467814,2015-12-31,0,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"I have been going to Olive for 8 years, almost 9. So keep in mind that my review is a comprehensive look at what I consider to be like my second home. I have seen many changes in staff, in service, and of course, in infrastructure/couches. Hehe. 

1) Lets talk about food: Even though their menu leaves much to be desired, order anything Mediterranean and you won't regret. My personal faves are the hummus, Greek salad, and wraps.  You can NEVER go wrong with chicken fingers and fries, either. The quality is fresh, the taste delicious, and the presentation adequate. 4/5 stars for food. :)
2) The atmosphere is TOO NOTCH. Whether you are looking for a lunch at the cafe in the entrance, a relaxing lounge, a weekend nightclub, or a quiet place to study-Olive has it all. Great size for larger parties, as well. The decor is nice and relaxing, gray lighting for a lounge feel. It is a little loud in the lounge on weekends, but if you love great, local, live music...you are in for a treat! 
3) The service there makes you feel like part of the family. Go enough, treat people like human beings, and joke around with everyone and you'll soon be welcomed into the Olive team. The waitstaff and hookah hosts are so friendly and responsive, not to mention engaging. 
4) The location is about 10 minutes from the airport, easily accessible from the 95, and very central. Great overflow parking for the busy nights. 

I go to olive approximately 10x/month. Lunch is a cheap, quiet place to check-out of the office for an hour. I recommend this to everyone I know, even people who are just in town visiting. There are plenty of places, but if you are friendly, outgoing, and like a chill place to relax for a while, this is the place to be!",GRC4W0kLBxvLVR9uw-QGvQ,3,1,5,AXLM6Vo6hUetAlTC2i6ppQ

The reason I don't give it any more is because of management and because their best hookah server, Joe, left. I was a regular here for a while and whenever Joe worked, he made sure that my hookahs were packed to perfection. He also never let me run down on coals. Prompt and precise. Since he left, the hookah service sucks. On more than one occasion have I had to ask the food servers for coals and the hookah servers would come around, LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND STILL SKIP OVER ME. The owner also isn't pleasant in the least. She always either ignores me or when she couldn't avoid me, she would give me an attitude with words and her expressions. I'm tired of getting treated with lower service than everyone else.

We head in and there's no clear host stand, however I do hear someone mumble in my general direction- no employees are visible. Finally after standing there looking around like an idiot I see the security guy sitting at a table with customers. I say ""Did you ask for my ID?"" Him and this table just laugh. Bad start. 

We ask where we should have if we have reservations he points to a doorway (clearly this guy was employee of the month) we are led into a huge room with fabulous live music. We twist and turn through walkways and are seated up front- awesome. The waitress comes by and asks what we would like, we request a menu and there is a list of house drinks with no prices- so to make sure I don't get carried away I ask what vodkas they have she seems to only be sure they carry Ciroc. I ask if they have Stoli and how much it is, she says $9- sweet I order a drink. A few hours and drinks later and turns out my Stoli and Sprite's were actually $11. Normally this wouldn't be a huge issue but I specifically asked for pricing, and if she wasn't sure she could have just said that and gotten back to me instead of making up a price point.

It has more of a nightclub feel than a casual hookah lounge, which is perfect for a Saturday night.

The service was amazing (especially compared to other hookah places in town). They came by constantly to take drink orders, food orders, give us new coals, etc. We didn't order much food because none of us were very hungry, but what we ordered was delicious: baba ganoush (this one was the best), hummus with meat and pine nuts, lentil soup, labneh, chicken fingers. I didn't like their pita bread - it was really thin and I prefer doughier pita.

The hookahs were smooth and really long-lasting. We ordered a jasmine-mint and one of the special ones from the menu (I can't remember the name, but it was all of our favorite).

4085491,2016-07-13,3,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"I've experienced many different hookah lounges. You have the chill ones with the meditation type music. You get the trendier ones. Then you get whatever this is. It feels like this place has two owners. One that really wants a trendy hookah lounge with good live music and an owner who really wants a PTs. The motif never settles on either.

The place is very open and the hookah lounge area is very comfortable. The seating is nice and it is conducive for conversations until the music starts up. The constant annoyance in this place is that while the hookah lounge area is dark and cool, you have the bar area lit up with harsh florescent lighting. For some reason, the bar is lit up like if NDOT was adding lanes to the bar or something. Plus, the bar was enormous and looked better suited in a Coyote Ugly.

The staff, unfortunately, also fell into the PTs type category. You have these diner waitresses, older women with permanent scowls, scurrying about the place. They loathe their jobs. We wanted to eat but every waitress couldn't be bothered with taking our order. Even when we wanted to pay for our drinks, it was a hassle just getting them to stop. You know your waitress is horrible when they don't even want to take your money. 

The dealbreaker for most people will be the music. I don't particularly care for music in a hookah lounge as I'm usually trying to talk to people. I will admit the singer and acoustic guitar player they had when we went were very good. The music was melodic but not overpowering. You could still have a conversation, it just took a little more effort. People who don't care for live music, avoid this place as live music apparently happens quite often.

Very reasonably priced for a party 15. We ordered Sangria, which was pretty good, and Mediterranean sampler platters, which were so good, just the right blend and not over fragrant, some restaurants over do it, but not The Olive. The hookah was fun and  exciting for most of us who had never tried it. We went on a Monday night and the live band was Barry Black and the Sensuals and they made the night even better, they are hot, hot, hot!

4263661,2015-12-31,1,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"Olive is one of my most favorite places. I have been going there since it practically opened. It is my home away from home, my office space when I need a quiet place to work, and a great place to meet up with friends for any occasion. 

What we ordered...Normally hookah, salad, and fries. Depends on the mood, but always a hookah. 

1) You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The pita chips and salsa is awesome, hummus is fresh, and they have chicken fingers and fries for those of us that aren't as adventurous. Overall 4.5/5 stars
2) There are 4 different spaces for seating at Olive. The main cafe and pool (table) rooms are quiet all day. They also have another 2 rooms, the lounge and the space behind it, that are quiet during the day and have live music at night. There are couches, chairs, and booths that are all comfortable. The lounge is great for large groups too! The live music is great addition and they have a great variety throughout the month. I have spent many of hours there working on papers for grad school or other work and always feels just like home.  Overall 5/5 stars
3) I've never had an issue with the service here. If you go often enough and get to know the staff  you will be treated just like family. It's a wonderful feeling walking in and they not only know your name, but your regular order as well. 
Overall 5/5
4) Location is great. Close to the airport, the 95 and the 215 (sort of). The parking is ample with overflow parking close as well. Overall 5/5

Would I go again? Heck yes! 
Would I recommend to friends? Double heck yes! I recommend this place to people who are my friends and to strangers. 

This place is great. More importantly it's locally owned and operated. They are a wonderful family, who takes great pride in their business and it shows. I go to Olive (on average) about 2 or 3 times a week, which should tell you how committed I am to the place.",Wp6_Wa_ZgvqoZ6u2PHWI6w,2,1,5,GWmcxC9yTYip8mrv0ik7Nw

Tonight we had a group of 10 and when we got our tab, 9 of us threw in cash and the 10th person (who was a little tipsy) threw his card in the little book with all of the cash and the bill. The waitress takes the book with the card and about $200+ in cash, she comes back a few minutes later and says the card was declined and ALL OF THE CASH WAS GONE. Another guy in the group offers to cover the declined card but when we ask about the cash in the book, she tells us we didn't give her any cash. There was 10 of us at that table and only one person was pretty drunk. We all saw the cash go in the book and we all saw the waitress take it. But she stuck to her story and denied the 10 of us ever giving her any cash. After talking with the manager of the place, he would not check the cameras that are right above his register to see if any cash made it back there. Being a retail manager for over 10 years, there's no reason to show customers the footage but anytime a customer accuses any type of money loss, you check the cameras. He wouldn't. He wouldn't do much to help at all and kept taking the waitress' word even though there are now 10 other adults who all saw the cash leave in her hands. We were not that tipsy to not notice that we handed over $200 in cash to someone. And then the nerve of tryin to charge us again after we handed over all of that cash. I've never been so disrespected in any type of establishment. I've never had a server take money from me and then say they didn't take it. In the end, the manager said that he would void out our transaction and our tab would be comped. But we did not recover our cash that was given so technically we paid for our ""comped"" tab with the cash that was surprisingly never given to our server. Please believe that everyone I know in Vegas, along with the people that the other 9 customers I were with know, will hear about the horrible AND last experience we've had at the olive. If you continue to contribute to this awful place, don't get too drunk here and always pay with a card.

There were bouncers at the door checking IDs and the first thing I noticed was the dumb disco ball/laser lights that created little red dots, like sniper rifle type dots, everywhere. It was weird and successfully annoyed me the whole time we were there. 
Anyways, we went in and there's a seating section for the 18-20 yr olds and then a different club like area for the 21+ crowd. And crowd there was! Holy shit man. There were tables and couches and seats everywhere and so many people! It was so hard to walk around in there to go to the bar or the bathroom or anywhere really. But what kinda killed it for me was the noise level. It was so loud in there my friend and I were literally yelling at eachother just to communicate (i.e. I'm going to the bathroom). Speaking of, the bathroom was a one toilet only kinda deal and lines started to form. My friend and I went in together so we could talk for a second without yelling and as we were walking out some other girl opened the door to walk in (faulty lock?). It was pretty awesome because her face conveyed pure shock/embarrassment/surprise like she thought we were hooking up or something so I winked at her and grabbed my friends hand as we marched out.
Anyways, my friend knew someone so we scored a table in the back where it was a little quieter and more intimate. We got hummus and pita (best ever, most likely!) and tahzikti (cucumber yogurt dip) which was alright. 
Though they were packed the service was on point and I never had to wait long to ask for a drink or anything. And the wait people were really friendly so that was good. 
I tried two different hookahs and they were alright. I don't like hookah so I'm not really a good source but my friends really enjoyed it.
Also- there was a live band that was killing it! They were all relatively cute, very talented and played an awesome variety. I would go back.",kuqjomfx-Pc0RtrMsX5Rag,2,2,4,EgLIRbbZmSx_F8nZL1JiQQ

This is a hookah place so most everyone there is smoking hookah which is very cool, they have an amazing system to keep everyone happy and smoking.  

The food is just what the name implies and is actually pretty good.  The service was kind of strange, a lot of girls standing around talking to the bartender and really not helping each other out.  Our server was trying very hard to keep her head above water, it just would have been nice if the other servers could have helped out when they passed your table.  there was one other table other then ours who asked someone else for something, they said they would tell our server instead of being a team player and just bringing it out to you.  Needless to say, the requests were never passed on to our server.

Other the that, overall everything was really good here and this is a place we will definitely come back to because the food is good, the menu is not extensive but the music at least on the night we were there was really good.  You get LARGE portions and don't be fooled if you order more then one plate per person you will be taking food home.

We arrived and were notified of some show there with live bands and belly dancers.  The cost was $10. With that you got a drink.  None of us wanted to pay due to the time.  Luckily, there was space available where we didn't have to pay and they were kind enough to seat our large party. The place is pretty big and has separate rooms.  I wasn't able to go into the big room, due to the event, but I did take a peek and from what I saw, it seemed big and colorful.  Low lighting sets a chill atmosphere.  

My plan was to not spend any money, but that didn't happen.  We looked at the menu and said, ""Ohh, that looks good...and that!"" so my plan of not spending any money went up in the smoke of the hookah.  We ordered the Olive Mediterranean Combo which came with hummus, baba ganoush, feta cheese, cucumber, yogurt salad, tomatoes, olives and tabouleh along with 2 orders of fries.  My, my I went to town on this combo! They serve warm pita bread with this too and I can't tell you how many I ate.  There was only one of these minis that didn't agree with my taste buds.  The combo was awesome and you can't beat the price either for all that food.  The lady who was helping us said we were one of the liveliest groups she's had in a while and loved us.  

We loved her as the service was excellent!  She and co-workers checked in to see how we were doing.  They checked the hookahs of others and if we needed anything, they made it happen.

Location Overview:
This hookah lounge can be found on Sunset and Sandhill behind Panda Express. Each room is decorated a little differently and compliments one another so well.

Customer Service:
After coming here for several years my friends and I came to know the owners and staff so well. It was a great overwhelming feeling to be back after 3 years. While most of the staff did not remember me, they were still very welcoming and took care of my table.

Quality/Quantity:
The quality of the hookah has gone down just a little, it seemed that the hookah did not hit as well as it normally should and I was consistently asking for new coals. The chicken fingers and hummus are as good as they always have been. 

Side Notes:
Voted one of the best spots for locals. Check it out.",e6FGtUMpBp18xfZOmpbw8w,1,1,5,RsiAELi4mQM3mNvh7fbRqg

Wait. I lied. It can be terribly wrong! 

But The Olive has one up on catastrophe by having Mr. Barry Black on payroll,  he is phenomenal!! What a voice! His set was amazing and his entire team had me in awe. 


The hookah menu was great, the godfather and mint=sexy 

Service was amazing, the waitress kept my drink on tap (I don't drink soooo limes and club soda), her eyes were on us the entire time. My friends always had their drinks topped off.

5029205,2013-03-27,2,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"I came here for a friends surprise birthday party. I arrived around 9 pm so it was pretty empty in the place. I was surprised at the size and amount of chairs they have to seat people. Very nice, dark layout. It could deem as a great place to chill and hang out with friends after a long day. However, the service here is a bit lacking. 

There were a lot of waitresses that night and they were huddling around the bar anticipating whether or not it'd be a busy night as I heard through their conversations. It was really dead and it was my first time there so I had no idea how it was on a busy night. I was really hungry while waiting for more people to arrive so I ordered a beef wrap and some hummus. Both weren't bad at all. I thought it was weird that the server took my card and opened up a tab for me as I was intentionally planning on not drinking that night, but I didn't say anything about it to her anyway. 

More people started arriving about an hour later and the lounge gradually started filling up as well. We had a whole row of seats and couches for our party, but as more people started showing up the servers started to get anxious as we were flowing out of the specific area they had for us. There were also several hookahs out. It seemed as if they didn't want all that business for them or couldn't handle that many people. 

They ended up making all of us get up and relocate into this bland side room which was away from all the music so it was a really weird atmosphere. It wasn't as comfortable as the lounge seating they had for typical guests, but they said we were taking up too much room out there apparently. 

We did not get much service in this room either. I understand it turned into a pretty busy night, but I think they could've used another waitress or two to staff our large party. When I finally received my tab at the end of the night, I noticed they double charged me on my bill. The waitress seemed a little upset about this even though it wasn't my fault claiming that someone else had charged me extra, not her, but she refunded me in cash so it was okay. The whole ordeal and events of the night made me feel like I never wanted to come back again. At least the people I was with made the night a little more enjoyable.",runIV_idgvT6jeNcT1CyMQ,5,1,1,Ydj3zDBEpPkzXQEMmhO1Vw

The food there is always really good. My favorites being The Chicken NaNa, the spicy Mediterranean chicken wrap and the hummus. They also have great teas and coffees that are always enjoyable.

The hookah is the real reason I go there though. They have a great selection with really great quality tobacco. Some of my favorite mixed being Pumkin and vanilla, sweet november, bunny bomb, Saphire, and Godfather grape mint.

My one complaint is that on the weekends it turns into a club environment. When I go I like to go to chill and relax. The DJ is usually so loud on the weekends that you cant even have a conversation with someone sitting right next to you, which also makes ordering a pain in the ass. 

Overall though, a great place with great prices.  .",yzJsP6cnek8ALrQLCTfaYw,0,1,5,tKeYHUj05kNKcryF8rfbMQ

Ok, so I act like this was my first time! LOL I always seem to congregate to this place when a bunch of us want to enjoy some hookah.  Tonight was no different.  Hookah and The Olive was the perfect remedy after a long and work-filled week.  Usually I'll just get something from the bar and hookah.  Today was a little different.  Along with the usual, we were also hungry...

So to start off, my friends got the skittles flavored hookah which is highly recommended.  I don't usually get specialty drinks, so I have no room to judge their full service bar, although I will say that our server was a little impatient and screwed up my end tab.  She was in a rush and didn't split the check as requested when we arrived, so I ended up paying for the entire table.  It's a good thing I loved everyone there.  LOL.

For food, we got a few appetizers:  The hummus with pine nuts and beef for $5.95, the seasoned fries for $3.95 and the regular fries for the same cost (only because we wanted another basket of seasoned fries but they ran out, so we had to settle with the regular basket).  To start off with the regular fries, they were crispy, shoe string type fries served with ranch and ketchup.  Although I love shoe strings, it was like your typical basket of fries.  The best way to describe the seasoned fries was that it tasted exactly like the seasoned curly fries at Jack in the Box, but these fries were straight and thicker.  I LOVE Jack's seasoned curly fries, so this basket was ON POINT for me!  

Finally, I think the hummus deserves it's own paragraph.   First start off with the most fluffiest homeade pita bread.  Then top it with their phenominal hummus (pureed garbanzo beans with tahini sauce, olive oil for the hummus amateurs out there...although I have a feeling there aren't that many).  This hummus is accompanied with olive oil, pine nuts and Mediterranean flavored beef.  Talk about a WINNING combination.  It was a Mediterranean sandwich explosion of flavors!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  

Overall, the atmosphere is really dark and the furniture has seen some better days.  When you have time to sit and absorb the energy in the room however, you're going to realize that this place is loved amongst the surrounding locals.

5198915,2011-02-13,9,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"Falafel alert! Falafel alert! 

I rarely make it to this side of town, so when I was in the hood I wasn't sure where to eat. Thank goodness for this thing called Yelp. Based on the reviews, we decided to try Olive. 

I will admit that when I walked in I was afraid yelpers had been reviewing the party quotient and perhaps not the food, as the atmosphere was dark, bar-like and a little rough around the edges. My expectation for the food was low based on the atmosphere. It seemed like a great place for a Friday night throw down, but perhaps not for a weekday lunch. They have beer pong, pool, and an expansive hookah room.

I almost didn't order falafel, as I was pretty sure I would be disappointed. However, I couldn't resist, so I ended up with falafel and a baba ganoush. The baba ganoush arrived on the scene with a basket of pita. I expected average pita to be lurking in that basket, but boy was I wrong! There were warm, pillowy pockets of divine dough... soft and fresh. As soon as I snuck may hand into the basket and retrieved a pita, I knew things were gonna be real good. Seriously, the pita is probably the softest in town. The baba was excellent with the right balance of creaminess and smokiness. 

Now, for the falafel. I had the appetizer plate and my husband had ordered the ""sandwich."" When his hit the table, I thought ""oh no"" because it was in a wrap and pressed, not in a pita. However, this presentation ended up being brilliant- the perfect vehicle for delivering falafel, like a falafel burrito! When I cut into my piping hot bean ball, my eyes lit up because I saw green! Prior to this, I had not seen a falafel in Vegas with parsley and/or cilantro to give it a nice green color. The falafel was a great consistency, and the flavor was pretty delicious. They may have been a tad salty, but overall, I was impressed. Perhaps it was because my expectations had been low, but I really want to go back and try them again. They are a strong contender.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,6,4,D_7swpb_a-1pZPhp6TBUGA

5227737,2014-10-20,3,9d36_PI9Fh7kZ-Pybr2QiA,"This review is going to be a testament of how AMAZING service can make up for a horrible beginning of a night.

I used to come to The Olive years ago, when I lived near their location.  I always enjoyed the food, and the service was nice.

Saturday night, I came out with a friend for the first time in probably 5 years.
We were there for a belly dance show, and after walking in, said hello to a few people, and looked for a seat.  One of the girls who helped organize the event pointed me to a covered couch section that had 2 people sitting there, and NO RESERVED SIGN.  There were many tables with signs that said ""Reserved"" but this one did not.  We asked if we could join the couple, and sat down.

The couple got up and moved a little while later, to sit closer to where the girls would be dancing, and shortly after we were approached by the owner.  

She said to us, with a TON of attitude:  ""THIS section is reserved.  WE didn't seat you here.  You can't sit here.""  (I felt like I was in ""Mean Girls""!  ""YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US!!!"")

I replied, nicely, ""Um...ok...we were told it was ok to sit here, since there wasn't a ""reserved"" sign...and there was no one seating anyone when we came in.""

She says again, with a huge amount of attitude, like somehow we're inconveniencing her by trying to sit in her restaurant and spend money ""Well WE didn't seat you here.  You can sit over at the bar or at a small table, but ALL OF THIS is reserved.""

Well excuse the h*** out of me.  I already explained to you that there was not  a ""reserved"" sign on the table.  If you want your staff to seat people, maybe you should have a sign at the door saying ""Please wait to be seated."" 

So, my friend and I looked for seats, and decided to just sit at the bar.  

This is where the review gets the extra 2 stars, because based on my interaction with the owner, I wanted to leave, and would have left a 1 star review. 

The bartenders, Chris and Ashley, were amazing.  
First of all, Ashley had a small table reserved that she offered to us.  She said she wasn't supposed to be working, and that she just hadn't released the table yet, but it was ours if we wanted it.
We declined, as the seating at the bar was fine for us, and would allow us to order drinks and hookah without having to wait.

We ordered an AMF hookah, and two shots, and then had a couple more drinks a little later, which were all very good, and very strong.  We also ordered a second hookah towards the end of the night.
We had a few snags when it came to getting more coal for the hookah, which turned out to be a good thing (bellydancers with veils+coal= probably not a good situation).  

Chris and Ashley were the saviors of the night. They were personable, funny, and gave incredible service.  
I would be willing to come back JUST for them.

As it stands right now, I probably won't return for a while, until there's another event for the dance community.  The owner's attitude really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I understand being stressed out about a big turn out, or even just needing the space, but it is not MY fault that your staff didn't put a reserved sign down, and its not my fault that there was no signage stating to wait to be seated, or anyone at the door to let us know to wait.  A little less attitude, and a simple ""I'm sorry, but this spot is actually reserved, can we find you another table"" would have been sufficient.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,4,3,-d16kCN7FkGdjXzW9l7meg

The Olive has something for everyone. It is the perfect combination of a hookah lounge, restaurant, and bar. It's also slightly club-like on weekends with DJ Bushido spinning top 40, techno beats, and club music. 

If you want to relax and smoke hookah while working on your laptop, you can sit on their comfortable sofas and enjoy their free Wi-fi. Hookahs are $13 a bowl, $10 for refills - $10 and $7 during happy hour before 5pm. They let you fix your own coals, too, which - for any hookah connoisseur - is a major plus to a hookah lounge. 

If you're hungry, you can dive into some of the best Mediterranean food this city has to offer for a very fair price. With their house salad and tabouleh and pita bread, you can't go wrong. Shawarma sandwiches are also quite tasty.

If you want to be an alcoholic, there is a full bar with delicious mint mojitos, Lebanese beer, as well as their own specialty cocktails and all of the standard drinks for hum-drums who aren't willing to try anything new. ;)

If you want to dance, or watch girls with questionable morals grind on strange men - come late night on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays for some hip-shaking to the energizing beats of DJ Bushido. They also have belly-dancer Mylissa, with special guests, on Saturday nights. 

Overall - give it a shot! I drive across town weekly to hang out here. They have activities through the week as well, such as Soulful Mondays with the smooth acoustic sound of Barry Black.

The hookah is the best in town, but the place can get pretty noisy, at least on Saturday nights when we come. So if you're in an up beat mood and want to go where all the hipsters and party people smoke hookah then this is your place. 

They even have a separate area for 18-20 crowd with pool tables.

It's a pretty cool place overall.",l_yEb3Q-q7C5Eq1HReCrzw,1,1,4,k-IIXZKcue_Ls_uNm_6cUQ

Very chill atmosphere dark we also ordered a hookah and I must say the Godfather blend with guava is very good!!!!! Loved it! It was very refreshing almost like a menthol after taste very nice  the First DJ was good played a mixture of everything got me moving in my seat lol the 2nd DJ kinda killed the mood played too much Dubstep just wasn't feeling it but other than that it's a very chill place will go again on different night  I gave it 4 stars cause I didn't try the food and the DJ got carried away on a mood I wasn't feeling .",mjZYPVZ-g8Irq2I_xueTfg,1,0,4,rHIRXYW24uwiKfYipbRLEA

She's constantly checking on me, laughing/joking and just making the environment fun. I usually get the chicken fingers, Greek salad or Caesar salad. I have never ever been disappointed with The Olive!",7-HXZ37A6P5Dr9wmcakKew,0,0,5,RNng5-z61f0RMgQoNPQZVQ

I was stunned at how beautiful the lounge and restaurant were inside. We ordered an array of food and some champagne. It was a lovely time. Good food and good people. Who could ask for anything more.",CScKVOGaZ-kbdJXOgt8l8A,2,0,5,oF-BGorYSC7gewffQLHCvg
