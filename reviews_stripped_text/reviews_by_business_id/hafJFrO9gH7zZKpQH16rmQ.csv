347043,2017-05-12,0,hafJFrO9gH7zZKpQH16rmQ,Lucky to get one fucking star. 35 minutes in the drive thru for them to give me nothing close to my order. Especially when my order has to be specific due to allergies and health reasons. Fuck you Taco Bell. Close this location.,q3GhIJlAfZfN0UDP_zOMDQ,1,0,1,YBkZt2WuadaheMHLTD0Obg
578502,2017-03-30,0,hafJFrO9gH7zZKpQH16rmQ,"Horrible! I went there the day after their ""Grand Opening"" day for lunch with a coworker. This was the most wasted lunch money since I've worked in the area and I definitely felt cheated. 

They charge extra for things that used to be included with the dish I ordered. The ""meat"" was practically missing in action. 

The only thing good about the place was that it is a newly constructed site so there was no chance of it being dirty yet. 

The food certainly was not worth what I paid and we won't be dining there again. 

Very disappointing because we were so very badly in need of a new place to eat around MLK & W. Lake Mead. Thank goodness for El Pollo Loco across the street.",96ZAk96BR0xlN1QTVJsrag,5,0,1,1ixp1W6yxRXVut_kWu-qYg
724638,2017-05-30,0,hafJFrO9gH7zZKpQH16rmQ,Everytime I come to this location their always getting my food wrong. I ordered a Gordita chicken supreme and they over charged me with a Cheesy Gordita crunch. I went back inside and said politely that this wasn't not what I ordered. Along with 2 cheesy bean and rice burritos. They only had 3 crew memebers and 1 manager working at this location last night. The only thing that I like about this location is that it's close by my home in walking distance. They need to hire more people to this location. Stop messing up my orders sheesh ! They gave me the messed up order to keep which I appreciated though. That let's me know that customers can get away with almost anything.,De4uNnWfd-s8ji1dDPmUyg,0,0,1,Zpj6BFdAeE4ZGXcQC06Jqw

I stayed at the drive through waiting and no one came...as I proceeded to drive off the cashier was standing outside getting something from her car. I drove by and asked, ""are you closing early tonight?"" And she responded with its 1am... which now it was 10 minutes till. Then I told her it's not even time yet, and then she proceeded to lie that they ran out of meat?! This is ridiculous. I had to cancel my order and drove out for nothing. Whoever owns this specific franchise needs to keep a close eye on the workers since they are going home early.",7uOzXt_jqMlRi7Rk9pM5Pw,0,0,1,B9HGeb1FUOdHkoTGav5ELQ
2914430,2017-06-23,3,hafJFrO9gH7zZKpQH16rmQ,This is the slowest Taco Bell ever! I'm pretty sure the cashiers are all high. I was given about 25 hot sauce packets for 1 burrito. The owner of this Taco Bell should be ashamed. So excited to get this in this neighborhood and now I can't come back. I came in today as the drive thru takes 45 minutes to go thru no matter what. Unacceptable.,iMVHqFAY79af29FgZceOGA,1,0,1,bvXqceQ7HXgkHg1EMe_bgA

Lots of issues getting simple orders placed and received. When I finally got my food, the girl didn't want to give me my receipt back. She said ""we keep receipts"". Um, no. GIVE ME MY RECEIPT SO I CAN REPORT YOUR POOR SERVICE. 

When I got to my destination, the food was horrible and did not taste like other locations. So trust, I shall never go to or recommend this location ever again.",LWxR64_-iziF1fjGhAURHw,2,0,1,VutiBPFlyY2ELzmfE8lV5w

5863369,2017-05-03,0,hafJFrO9gH7zZKpQH16rmQ,"I sadly regret wasting time and money at this Taco Bell.  
I went today May 2, 2017 @ about 7:50 pm. I ordered a 7 layer burrito with no rice. They forgot to put cheese in it. They only put 10 little pieces of lettuce, 9 pieces of chopped tomatoes. I am extremely disappointed. A definition of ""a layer"" needs to be explained. I have been ordering the 7 layer burrito for about a decade. Today's 7 layer burrito was the smallest one I have ever had. 
We also ordered a taco-burrito and 2 burritos for the kids. I wanted to call them but their contact information is not updated on yelp.

How can I give them half a star? They are brave opening up in the hood. At this location they forget that loyal customers don't come to incompetent businesses.",Qb-9RF9o-jp16hqVlu_myQ,1,0,1,zr1MQ04UJQD5H3aZ1NtrUg
