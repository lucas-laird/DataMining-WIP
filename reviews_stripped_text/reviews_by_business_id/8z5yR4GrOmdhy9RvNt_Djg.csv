Must try the Manny Pacquaio tacos they are deliciously good. As for the garlic fries, they were loaded with flavor but you better make sure to bring some gum cause your breath is gonna be kickin. I didn't have room to try anymore of their food but I will definitely try them out again.

Approached the truck, no line, ordered three bunz: bacon bird, Mac n cheese, & a plain along with some truffle tots. I have to say this is the first food truck where I did not finish all of my food. The tots were greasy & not very flavorful. The bunz were meh! I just did not like them, there was very little filling, & when there was filling it was not good. I had a credit on Groupon so I actually got my Groupon & meal for free, but I feel that free is way too much to pay for this! Also, the crew was not as friendly as other food trucks were. I mean I am coming out of my way to find your truck, you can smile or say hi or something! 

On a better note, located next to this truck was Grouchy Johns. I only had a couple bucks on me & was looking for their most inexpensive cold drink. I was immediately greeted by the owners when I approached the truck. I was reading the menu to myself, but aloud, and saw sweet tea. I told them I only had a couple of bucks & they took it & gave me a large sweet tea! Nice! That is the kind of service I'm used to from food trucks. I'll go out of my way to find Grouchy Johns...I'll drive right by TastyBunz.",g7sMYyJ30Gk1BV_9qfiKAQ,0,1,1,p5u0NCNdtVZI1jYhoZrfEQ

That said it took them 30 minutes to get us our food. The Mac N Cheese and McCheezy Buns were a bit undercooked. The dough felt a bit sticky. The mac n cheese didnt taste cheezy and it was a bit bland. I'll give it another try perhaps after work hours when its not rushed.",0S6OtXUGAZX__HuXlqIO0g,0,0,2,z86kYhbzdcFjB19543QcSQ

Nowhere on the Groupon did it say this was a food truck and not an actual restaurant. The address is in a sketchy area anyway so I thought I would check it out. I drove up and down that street looking for this place. I finally pulled into Costco.
I asked the guy where the TastyBunz restaurant is. He laughed and said it was not a restaurant but he is usually parked here. He said it looks like he is not here today. I can't believe Groupon would offer their services to some guy riding around in a food truck. I looked it up on my phone and called. It rang for a long time and someone answered with just hello. I asked if this was TastyBunz he said yes. I asked were they were because they were on the Deal Now Groupon. He just said...""oh we didn't come out today."" I was stunned. Has a promo running on Groupon to promote his business and he didn't feel like going to work. Now that is comedy. I wasted an hour of my time trying to find a greasy food truck that didn't even bother to show up. I called Groupon to let them know they need to check these things out a little better. I don't care how good his TastyBunz taste I am getting my money back. How anyone can run a business like that is beyond me. Good luck with that.

pulled - pork - can't remember the name but it was a pulled pork filling that was ok but again - the dough was too much for me.

2261589,2011-03-21,1,8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg,"I was really excited about this food truck.  The concept is definitely unique and who wouldn't like a bun stuffed with mac and cheese.  The staff is really nice and I really like the sides.  The truffle tater tots are to die for and the Frisco garlic fries are also great.  But the buns are pretty bland.

I came to the grand opening at Costco and I've tried to visit every time they are at Costco so I could try all the buns.  I've tried everything except the sloppy bun, a bun stuffed with spaghetti, which I am eager to try but they've been out.

The pork special (now called Hot Pig?) is ok but not spicy.  

Dad's picadilly is interesting, but not very tasty.  Like taco meat with some vegetables in it.  There is dill in the bun, but I couldn't really taste it.

Mac and cheese bun (now McCheesy, I think) is mac and cheese in a bun.  There is supposed to be mushrooms and/or truffle in the bun but I could not taste either.  But the second time I tried it, I got more truffle flavor in the mac and cheese. But I think I built this one up too much in my head and it just disappointed me in the end.

BBQ rib bun was ok.  There is cilantro in the bun, but I can't really taste it.

The bacon bird bun is probably my favorite so far.  Nice bacon flavor and very creamy.  But again, not getting much flavor from the bun.

I also tried the Me fries but they are a little overwhelming with the egg.  I could not finish it all.  I'll probably stick with the Frisco fries.

The dessert potstickers are super sweet.  So sweet they hurt my teeth somehow.  Unfortunately I just can't deal with the sweetness, but I've only tried the smores potstickers, which are fried pastry potstickers stuffed with chocolate and covered with condensed milk and graham crackers. Maybe others are less sweet.  You can try all three if you order the happy ending.  Cute.

This is the only food truck I've encountered anywhere that does not include tax in the price.  So bring change or expect to get a lot back.  3 buns are $6 without tax but $6.49 with tax, if that helps.

That being said, it's a new truck and has a lot of potential.  It looks like they are changing up the menu and making new items.  So I'll likely be back for the sloppy bun and other menu items. If something strikes my fancy, I'll definitely re-review.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,8,6,3,3obJGsof9qsHLfmiv-0Mzw

It was hard as hail to read their marker writings for the menu selections on their see through windows, but I came across the word.. Tots and a photo of it on the truck. What got my undivided attention, which people with A.D.D indeed are less prone in having... a Truffle flavored Tots with fancy Truffle Sauce... Hmmm Veeery Interesting I told myself. Something else caught my eyes, but that's something left to my imagination. Ordered one and it was steaming hot.. all packed up in a sturdy white box and had the utensils inside all ready for chow down. I thought just that was appealing to see.

As I received my Truffle Tatter Tots, the aroma filled my nose with deep heavy scent of Truffles. It even made me salivate from inhaling this flavored Tots. The portion and size was beyond generous... amazing outer crust crunch. Crisp and light... the center was soft and steamy. I literally made the Oh face hot look. I like the fact that even when 20 mins. went by.. those Tots were still packed with steam. The flavor was sexy, fun, jammin'!!! Absolutely the best Truffle Tatter Tots to date. It was the perfect blend without the crazy salt or spice. I loved it!

The service was exceptional. He was ready to take my order right when I walked up. Very attentive and made sure that's all I wanted. If the service is warm and welcoming... it can bring Anybody back.

2732716,2011-05-25,0,8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg,"My opinion? Get the Manny P taco (crispy pata/fried pork in a taco with special sauce), and the ME Tots (tots with cheese, bacon, sauce, a fried egg) if you're in the mood for some indulgence. 

The buns are okay, a little expensive for me but good to try at least once. I liked the sisig ones, but I kind of ran out of money before I could try the other ones. 

The fried desserts are good too, except that they priced them at an odd amount (something that ended in $.95) and it just seemed weird for a food truck to give back nickels in change. The desserts themselves are tasty, but also small for the price. But again, good to try at least once.

For being the only truck to serve tater tots (which I'm a sucker for), and the Manny P taco (which I'm now obsessed with), for me it's worth hunting down. But only IF I have the cash. But like I've said before, it's good to try at least once. Also, the owners are super nice and are always very gracious to their customers.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,0,0,4,LSNgDROtoXNJnLMb19IAag

I'm quite enthusiastic about bite sized cakes/pastries/cookies so these were right up my alley. The s'more's potstickers were good, but then again, who wouldn't like deep fried chocolate goodness?

My coworker shared her truffle tots with me and they were quite delish. Not quite what I would order but I'm not a truffle fanatic. They were the deluxe order so it was topped with bacon and a fried egg. She really enjoyed them but commented, ""The sauce was a bit over powering."" I was all about the garlic fries. I think the creamy sauce and the slivers of garlic are what did it for me. 

Now I bet you are thinking, ""What about buns, when are you going to get to the buns, isn't that what their name sake is?"" The buns, hmm ... I frankly have to say ""I think they need work."" I showed up thinking I was going to score some soft fluffy Filipino siopao the size of softballs cut in half like my mom makes. Image my surprise when I lift this small palm sized muffin top out of the box. And even though it was savory (the Bacon Bird) it was coated with a sweet sticky glaze ?? The dough, not bad a little heavy, the filling flavorful but dry instead of creamy. I also think that they needed to be a little more golden brown on the top. These were as pale as Louis in Interview with the Vampire.

So in all, not a bad jaunt to try something new. At the very least, if I see them around town, I will pop over for some fries and cake balls.

Since I'm not a drinker anymore, I asked them if anybody wanted to check out the it out the food truck fest at Tommy Rockers. and get a beer there.    I couldn't budge them at all, because they found seats at a casino bar,  and didn't want to walk to the garage.    

At this point, it was a long day of watching College Football, and just wanted to checkout  these collection of mobile  gourmet  for a second time, then crash right after.   So I bailed out and head down the I-15 to seek out what I been hearing about TastyBunz.   

I found parking pretty fast behind the other buildings, and tracked down all of the all of those incredible mobiles; but it was Bunz truck that had my focus on them,  after all I was having a Tattor Totz attack, and heard so much about the Garlic Truffle Totz; so that order was a given, but I seen a few other choices on bunz.    I was a little taken back because of the many choices of them, but I settled on the Chicken with white sauce.

The Garlic Truffle Totz are totally OFF THE WALL!   That sauce could be put on burger, and it would kill.   Not to mention, it was quite a bit totz for an order. because of that  It was a great deal!    The bun was a little small, but tasty...and worth it too.    The  bread  reminds me of the Char sui bao from CBS Seafood restaurant in downtown Chinatown (Los Angeles); which has a slight sweetness to it, but the TastyBunz filling was quite good, and enjoyed every bite.

Service was very quick, and I got my order within two minutes, even thought it was busy for them at that time.

Finally got to try this truck at the strEATS festival the other night... 
What a great concept... the truck and the festival.  :)
How convenient that you can get bread and meat... at the same time and it's not your typical sandwich.  

The buns are on the small side... probably about 3 bites eat unless you have a big mouth and take big bites.  

Ordered:
* Lumpia - not the kind that my family usually makes with meat and veggies... this was all seasoned meat in a lumpia wrapper... and Boy, Oh Boy was it savory, juicy and tasty!  Didn't need the dipping sauce at all.

* Hot Pig - pulled pork with jalapenos... I was expecting it to be 'hotter' but it wasn't... still... it was savory and I'd like to get me some more

* MacCheesy - truffle mac and cheese inside a bun... sign me up!  The truffle flavor was slight which was good (I think) because truffle can be strong and overpowering... in this case... you could taste the mac n cheese and savor every bite and taste the flavors without one flavor dominating the other

* BBQ Rib - a little dry so I dipped it in the lumpia swee/sour sauce... I'd still get it again

The buns are soft and yummy.... again... I just love the concept.

Nice people, and the food has potential, but I was a little disappointed.",BCfzyrMne5E9SKo6YT6aiw,1,0,3,tTmnBrPXnfIuaXCp5fTkJQ
3503786,2011-11-06,7,8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg,"I'd like to share my experience out at the Food Truck Feast on Saturday 11/5/11 .  Stood in line for a nominal amount of time (most trucks had lines)...saw a lot of people standing around...so I thought...this must be the BIZNEEZ.  Made my order and they gave me a number...60.  What number were they on?  Almost immediately I hear 'Number 22' effffffffffffff.  Ok well maybe they're cranking these out pretty fast.  At this point, the smell of tasty bunz disspiates and the food zombies that surround me come into focus....did i teleport to the DMV? 

...in my 45 minute wait (yes you heard right) I encountered:
A person that stood in line, ordered, and received their food from 2 other trucks (lucky bastard)
A person that waited about 25 minutes and decided to give his number away (and donated his $6 to tasty bunz)
A person that wrote an entire blog post while waiting
A person that went back to the register and demanded her money back because they didn't even slightly indicate the wait that she had ahead of her.
Several people that stuck it out and waited for their food walking away saying ""this is it?""
At least 20+ people that got out of line when they found out how long the wait was.

Minute 45 almost on the dot...""number 60"" woot!...nevermind they called my number before 59.  But yes!  I didn't even look in the box...just ran away sheilding my food from the enraged mob.

Now for the reveal.........

Y u so small?  Ok whatever...the french do small portions right...small delcious portions.  The taste:  meh...I guess ur good.  But how hard is it to make Mac & Cheese not delicious?  Ok Garlic fries....wow...thats allotta garlic.  Fortunately I wasn't born a vampire and love me some garlic.  So A+ for that mess.  How about the tempura fried oreos with caramel sauce....yes this is what is going to kill me.  this exact thing.

Bottom line is...A)these people need to work on serving large crowds.  There's no shame in limiting your menu for large events.  Most places did this and I'd be willing to bet they made more revenue. B) If you make people wait that long...the shiz better be delicious and memorable.  The most memorable thing I got from you, I could pretty much make myself...hello oreos, tempura batter, caramel...got it.

Thanks for the story tasty bunz but there are a lot of food trucks in Vegas now...the only place I might be following you from now on...is twitter. ooo sweet burn :)",ZZc-pFlOH85eRoUqbtz2Nw,4,3,2,dw9T_R_seZ9Pmj-jvzW2PQ
3517312,2011-04-10,1,8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg,"I love the concept of this truck -- delicious buns filled with a variety of savory options. The folks running the truck are great also. But the execution needs some work, in my opinion. My main gripe is that there was too much dough and not enough filling. Talk about carb loading...

My two favorite buns were the ""BBQ rib"" (cilantro infused dough with BBQ beef) and the ""bacon bird"" (cheese infused dough with a creamy bacon chicken filling). The ""hot pig"" (jalapeño infused dough with Asian pork) was decent and had a bit of a kick to it and the ""McCheezy"" (mushroom dough with mushroom truffle mac 'n cheese) was a little bland for my taste.

Without a doubt, all the dough was top notch. The outsides were a little crispy and the interior of the buns were all chewy and warm. But again, I just wanted more meat.

The one dessert I tried was the ""Sticky Nanas"" (banana chocolate filled potstickers). If you have a sweet tooth, this is one dessert you need to try! It's incredibly sweet, rich and delicious and the smell of these bad boys is intoxicating. But, you'll want to brush your teeth afterwards because there is a ton of sugar in each bite.

If you're looking for a quick bite, this is a great food truck to hit up. These buns aren't cooked to order, afterall. So you can order and be on your way in a couple minutes. It's great if you have to eat and run. At $12.97 (for 4 buns and one dessert) it was a pricey lunch that still left me a little hungry.

3617583,2011-03-25,0,8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg,"So my initial reaction when I heard about TastyBunz was ""LITTLE BUNS STUFFED WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN CHINESE BBQ PORK? I'M DOWN"". A bun stuffed with mac & cheese with truffles? Who wouldn't be down for that. TastyBunz has a cool concept and I can appreciate the work that goes into making each of the unique buns, but it falls a bit short for me. 

I guess what first falls is that tax is separate from their prices so.. 1 bun for $3 to $3.24, 3 buns for $6 to $6.49, and 6 buns for $11 to $11.89. A litle bit pricey, but what can you do? They don't accept card so you will have some change. The buns are pretty bite size and the ratio of dough to meat is somewhat leaning on the dough side, but maybe thats the only way to cook it?

 The McCheesy is stuffed with mac & cheese with truffles, but it didn't seem to have a dominant truffle flavor. 

The bbq rib bun was interesting, cilantro mixed into the dough and the rib was still moist, rib was tasty, but couldn't taste the cilantro.

The bacon bird is probably my favorite of the ones I've tried, reminded of a chicken bake from Costco because it had a nice creamy chicken and bacon filling.

I haven't had the sloppy bun (spaghetti filled) yet because they've always been out.. arghhhh. 

The bacon dog (~$4 something) was pretty delish, it is split fried, and has a heavy garlic aioli sauce.

The packaging is pretty cool and a custom sticker to seal it is a nice touch. I'll probably visit again to get the sloppy bun and try some of their desserts.

Anytime I get a chance to run into them (usually at the food truck festivals) I always see to it that I grab some of these buntastic delights! I mean whoever thought of the idea of putting these wonderful concoctions inside a beautifully and deliciously made bun is genius! Only thing missing here is a restaurant with a bunch of metal carts being pushed around by fun servers during lunch. If that idea is ever invented sometime around, let me know, and I'll order two of everything!!!

I had the The Blu which has this wonderful chicken and cheese combination inside. It was delicious and went great with the sweet soft taste of the bun. It really complements each other well. I also had the Piz-a-pizza which is filled with pepperoni slices and a nice marinara sauce. My personal favorite is the truffle mac and cheese. Its just full of that cheesy goodness that keeps you wanting more and more! Also, good thing to know is that they do take card. So if you feel like you're dying for some heavenly goodness, but have no cash at hand? Fear not for they have a wonderful device that reads your magnetic swipe. SSSSHHHAAAWWWIIINNNGGG!!!

My favorite of the BUNZ was the pulled pork and the marinated BEEF one. They have the most flavor and best bun to filling ratio out of the lot.

The mac and cheese bun needs work on its filling content. Its a great idea..just needs the flavor dialed up a few notches.

The me tots....are just awesome IMO. Its just a mindblowing mix of flavors and a heaping for a serving.

The yhave dabbled into other areas including dessert and sadly I have not tried any of those other items but will update when I do,

It was ok. The dough was very good, but may have been too sweet. I actually could have used more flavor from the mac and cheese inside the bun- i didn't think it was cheesy enough. But the mere idea of this is absolutely amazing.

On the way home, I wanted to get a snack for the road, so I stopped by here and ordered the SF garlic fries. This is why i'm giving them 4 stars. they were SICK. They were basically shoestring fries, tossed in salt and garlic powder, topped with a garlic mayo-creme sauce and parsley. DELICIOUS. out of this world!

It was 3 mini potstickers fried with mashed bananas inside and drizzled with caramel and white chocolate. It was OK - it was really small - maybe because it was so hot outside I needed a cold sweet treat - I don't think I would order this again - it tasted like something I could make at home.

Sure, you could argue that you're not going to find spaghetti filled buns while eating dim sum, but that's beside the point!  Here's a breakdown of the menu: (pictured here http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=MZ000fT2g5Ww9Tw8OkCtYg)

Bacon Bird - cheese dough w/ creamy chicken & bacon filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=UB2iCvcS_b-gaEbgQ1K1Gw)  Probably my second favorite.  I'd probably like it with more cream sauce and bacon, but that's the glutton in me talking.

McCheesy - mushroom dough w/ truffle mac-n-cheese filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=TJH2HWSRDAAnawTsC3QSJQ) Dominant truffle flavor, not as cheesy as I would have hoped, but still tasty with that mushroom bun.

Sloppy Bun - thyme dough w/ spaghetti filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=ZcKOhk0T89Of2_HxyR2JXg)  This was my favorite!  Maria L. was spot on with her comparison to scooping up the last bit of spaghetti with your bread.

BBQ Rib - cilantro dough w/ Mom's BBQ beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=M21vsLD4RpfI6WtqpzNLCw)  I was surprised at how moist the beef was inside the bun.

The Dilly - green onion dough w/ Pop's ground beef filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=IEV7U49flzyc4QKdInZnpA)  Not my preference, it was okay.

Hot Pig -  jalapeno dough w/ spicy pork filling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8z5yR4GrOmdhy9RvNt_Djg?select=bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg)  I didn't really get any spice.

The Sloppy Bun, Bacon Bird and McCheesy were my favorites; you could eat these blindfolded and know what they were easily.  The other three didn't seem to have a distinctive flavor profile; yes, I knew that the main meat was (shredded beef/ground beef/pork) but it didn't excite the taste buds.  On my next trip I'll have to try the truffle tator tots and some dessert!

My one suggestion for eating at TastyBunz is this: don't come here on an empty stomach.  I ordered six buns for $11, and ended up eating them all!  In the end I was satisfied, and not overly full.  TastyBunz seems like the perfect spot to hit up with a couple of friends when you want a snack.  Split the cost, get the tots, try some desserts; I think it's more economical than spending $11 on one meal!

I'll be sure to try the sides and desserts on my next visit!",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,10,4,4,F6iizoDo87U7RQaIcYrtPA

The BF and I tried 3 buns. It took us a while since the menu was written down but not quite in a organized manner so you have to focus in on what's what. 

Truffle Mac&Cheese- these had a good truffle flavor to it. I was apprehensive about macaroni, but it went with the chewy texture. It was a nice surprise and pretty tasty.

Hot Pig- this was okay, but I was expecting hot pig/jalapeno would have a bit of kick. 

Beef curry- This was a good idea, however I was feeling like the curry was very ""raw"" tasting. When you cook curry and don't blend and cook well, it kinda is a bit sharp. I wouldn't get this one again.

I like the texture of the sticky bread and would get the truffle mac&cheese again. I think it's rather small for the price, but it's not like you can get these type of buns in Chinatown or anywhere else.

It's not TastyBunz fault he drove around Costco like a dummy.  I mean, I confess I had one issue in the past where I didn't eat at the place and I gave them one star, but that was because I came inside and I treated poorly directly from the staff and I walked out, not because I couldn't find the place.

Truffled Mac and Cheese with Mushroom Bun-
You had me at hello.  It was super moist and blended perfectly.  It was also served nice and hot, unlike some trucks where they serve their food cold.

SF Garlic Fries-
Just the name alone makes me smile.  Glad to see a bay dish in Vegas.  It was served super hot and you can tell it was a fresh batch and it hasn't been sitting around.  It was extra Garlic-y, just how I like it.  Reminded me of good ole' baseball fries.

Sweet O's (Tempura fried oreo's with a white chocolate and caramel sauce)-
Okay maybe I still need maternity pants or overalls after eating here.  My first time trying pretty much, deep friend Oreo's.  Worth the triple trips to the gym.  I don't recommend it if you aren't a sweet tooth kind of person.  But if you are a diabetic in training, such as myself, eat with caution.

I picked up three of the bunz and a bacon-stuffed hot dog to take back with me as my contribution to our little impromptu soiree.

I wish I could remember exactly what we had (I can't tell from my own photos; I usually snap the menu, just in case)... but one was a curried chicken, one was a pesto (?) chicken and the other was, I think, a pulled pork. (Shoot, was it the mac?)

The important part is that everything was executed PERFECTLY. Just the right amount of bun and stuffing. The flavors were amazing. The texture of the bunz today? Spot-freaking- on. A light crisp to the outside, tender and soft on the inside without being doughy (exactly what I said previously that I was hoping for), and the infused flavors (sun dried tomato!) were excellent. Two very happy thumbs up!

The bacon-stuffed hot dog, I have to say, was the winner for me. Maybe it's because I can't enjoy the bread like everyone else, or maybe it was the kicked up (really spicy in the best way!) garlic aioli.

Anyway, the slider had a lot of flavor, but I've had better.  And the truffle tater tots were a disappointment.  They tasted like the tater tots you can buy frozen at the grocery store.  I love love truffle, but the tater tots did not have a lot of truffle flavor.",UcmjgcFV2wTwoNAQTSfffw,0,0,1,Q3WUyttkfo7_7cClxDxv1A

I think it was called the McCheesy which was a Truffle mac n cheese. It was wonderful!

I actually have passed you a few times on the way to work and wanted to pull around and follow you just so I could get some great food when you set up. This is a great place to pick up a sweet treat and you won't be disappointed with their other items as well.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,5,LZmeZqi9QhqnSZ3wD6UJRw
