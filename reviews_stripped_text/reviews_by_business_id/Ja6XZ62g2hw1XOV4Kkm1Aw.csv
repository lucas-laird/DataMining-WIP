So, as usual, a snack makes the time go faster ... a garlic-parmesan pretzel with some cheddar dip plus a soda (their idea of a combination meal).  As another reviewer stated, it's a mall pretzel.  But, presented professionally, cheerfully and as promptly as possible (of course, with the Great Bearded Bird's typical luck, I came up right after a rush; they were making fresh pretzels, and I had to wait a few minutes).  While waiting, I fell into conversation with John, the store manager, who was making the pretzels.  We found out we had some background in common, and I discovered he is a professional, cheerful, competent old-school individual.  (No surprise; staff usually mirrors management.)

A three-star pretzel, plus a full star for the boss.  Well done, folks; I will be back.

The samples given are always beyond delicious--very flavorful and just the right temperature--you can't help but want to get in line for your own. But the ones that they have for sale always pale in comparison when it comes to the sample. The flavor is vague, so I'm sure they make sure that the samples that go out are tossed and tossed again to make sure they get the most on it.",uU2B1vrqkpWJI30xoooabw,0,0,2,f8QKFx2RO27gf_2klFu5dw

Then says ""oh why is everyone standing in line?!""  How do you work somewhere and not get the concept of a line?! The customer who cut everyone took the last of what was made. Place didn't deserve my money and waiting even longer.",afg-LBNpXpW1buMAVv9_qQ,0,0,1,_m3EDYVZ1_e-qlk-XY5Ivw
