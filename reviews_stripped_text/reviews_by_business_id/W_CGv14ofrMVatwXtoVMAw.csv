Edwin greeted me and I didn't know there hrs and they were about to close but they still took care of me 5 min before closing. I ordered 6 piece hot combo, 6 piece mild and 9 piece Cajun ranch combo (they just ran out of Cajun ranch so I got the hot instead. ) and banana pudding. The food came out fresh and Edwin actuallly helped me to the car with the food. 
When I got home the wings were still crisp and fries were good too ! And they make their ranch I was pleasantly happy with my food and will be back !",TWjMEPa_E5anUSMEnCP_fw,1,0,5,Vl7kM7blvP8UCrWwdAjE7A

I was so excited when I found out they were opening this location near my house! They have THE BEST lemon pepper wings. To the point where I always want to unhealthily just suck all of the flavor off the wing. I tried the voodoo wing and I didn't like it.. strange mix between siracha and bbq Asian sauce. Idk. Wasn't my thing. Cajun ranch was nice and creamy but if you're not a fan of strong cajun spice, you probably won't like it. Service is good and the inside is always very clean. Sometimes I order off Postmates also and it's still delicious!! I look forward to trying their other flavors.",xTimtxT3p1zKrtfP9JRuZA,1,0,5,_CxY0vGbJ_1Jk7DJOxfixA

I got the lemon pepper and garlic Parmesan, just like I always get for wing flavors and he got the Cajun ranch. He liked his wings and he got fries which were overly salted. I got fried pickles which were amazing. But my wings smelt so gross like not going to exaggerate to be mean to this business but like cat pee. I was starving but it just made me sick to my stomach I tried to eat more but couldn't. I should of said something but the shy person I am I didn't. The girl up front could tell I didn't like my food but didn't really engage with us. It was very slow as well the food took about 15 minutes. Later on about an hour or two my stomach was killing me I literally was in and out the bathroom. Unfortunately we will not give this place another try. I hope since it was super slow that there wings we were served were fresh but my stomach and the smell of the wings seem to think they weren't...",C059VwjQ3XoH7cxJuW1OeQ,0,0,2,EQq25lAat-zXapSPwnnQIw

Every place we wanted to eat had an hour and a half wait!  I was frustrated calling places and my boyfriend went on yelp to see a new place had opened 5 weeks ago.  I said, ""oh yeah I remember seeing the new sign when we got off the 215 beltway at Town Center heading east.""


I went with 9 boneless wings tossed in garlic parmesan with ranch.  We ordered a side of fries and I split them with a friend.  When I tell you we needed this business in this area I'm not even joking!  We used to drive all the way to Rainbow & 215 for Hooters wings.  Then Wing king was built and we walked in we weren't even acknowledged by anybody in 7 minutes so we left.


The chicken is so freakin' juicy, crispy but not overly crunchy.  The flavors just thinking about this place is making my mouth water. Garlic parmesan wasn't spicy which is perfect I didn't want it to be.  They don't even need a side to dip they're delicious all by themselves.  Now the fries I was thinking I wouldn't like them because so many places have the same boring straight cut fries.  These fries are crispy, seasoned perfectly and remind me of large curly fries from Arby's but WAY better.

The only thing the fries needed were some GOOD nacho cheese and I would of been over the moon.  The chief really cooks with love.

We live right up the road and will for sure be back since this makes Hooters last place in my book.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,0,0,5,fl1inzLixqQudORhAYFhHQ

Came with our two little ones which were getting hungry and Jan was so kind to recommend her In-House Banana Pudding. The kids (and I) scarfed it down and will definitely be getting it our next visit. The staff was so friendly and came out a few times to make sure we were enjoying our meal. 
They had 3 tv's which were easy to view the Knights game. Don't know if they served alcohol, but would be nice with chicken wings. 
Will be eating here again!",vvyIYBvszbyiaLGBB7izdg,3,0,5,RcbalVbOTAbPTUnI7cxFiQ

Only negative I have is that I wasn't crazy about the cole slaw, it was a little too soupy and sweet for my tastes.",Nrxse9AoBKKLGHrf7I2fKQ,0,0,5,JCNf5kiHXEUIyNRSQ4Xzvw

I did boneless wings they were perfect, tender and the Cajun Ranch flavor and Sweet Heat hit it out the park. They also have awesome Fried Pickles as a side and the Banana Pudding is top notch. Great Staff and Great Food.  Thank you guys. See you again soon.",8yVq8OwHqSKOxL7oflIZgg,0,0,5,g2l-Eryvo51q69l_0JvyFQ
