From looking at the place I figured it was just a middle of the road Italian place where we could get a halfway decent pizza and a pasta dish that didn't make me want to vomit.

To my surprise the food was exceptional.  Our waiter was very accomodating and suggested some specials,which I took advantage of and ordered a dish which I think was called Chicken Arigosta.  It was chicken breast wrapped in lobster with a lobster sauce and vegtables.  I tried a piece of their pizza which was excellent as well.

Everything was reasonably priced, the service was great, and the food was fantastic.",KOCvyILJBKXIqaEgHm3WVw,2,0,5,-kQJSy-rVaLUTZlU_y6Kng

The salad with the eggplant and bacon wrapped shrimp and calamari was fantastic.  The bolognese pasta was good.  Marsala chicken was crap, but that was probably the only thing I didn't like.  I have no idea what it cost because someone else paid.  Pretty good place.  Not outstanding.",NFO6OTzgHkpR2k9xNYs11w,0,0,3,ceW3uoCgnckJmE9HK87peA
2973499,2011-09-10,0,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,"My friends and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning... and it was one of the most horrible experiences ever.

First of all, it should NEVER take 45 minutes to get breakfast.  Wanna know why?  Because that stuff is premade in the kitchen!  We should've known not to eat here after it took about 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, which SOUNDED amazing, but it was really disgusting.  Who drips honey on chicken? :(  

Let's see what else sucked here... Oh, they spilled a bunch of syrup on the floor and then tried to wipe it up with a napkin... they brought out your food, and then a minute later--brought out your bill.  No one refilled our glasses of water.  And they ignored you the whole time... until they brought your bill out (so they could remind you to tip big :P).

All in all a horrible experience.  With so many wonderful restaurants on the strip, there is no way I would come back here.",lHnMp5AxsBHyky2RG238Uw,1,0,1,P1zZzPwxMlE6BW-24hShCA
3360682,2008-02-19,0,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,"With the unexciting and unrevealing name and the tiled ""pizza"" and ""pasta"" words in the decor, we weren't expecting anything but to keep walking on past as we skimmed Market Street Caffe's menu while staying recently at the Monte Carlo hotel. It was the antipasti bar that caught our eye, pleased our palate, and brought back memories of excellent pizzerie in Italy. That our meal was so unexpectedly near-authentic and pleasing for its simplicity in a city so inauthentic and overblown I had to bump this review up a star. 

For about $20 a person, not including drinks, we each enjoyed our own wood fired pizza and a couple trips to the antipasti bar. (Though one can make as many trips to the antipasti bar as one pleases.) The ""appetizer"" vegetable dishes were very fresh-tasting and simple, with options from the light and refreshing, like fennel with grapefruit, to the more pungent, like roasted garlic with oil-cured olives, and many options in between. In the middle of February to enjoy produce that tasted this well was a sensual delight. The pizze were appropriately simple. If they could have delivered a thin Roman-style crust like we ordered, with the edges charred from the fire, I would have raved even more than I'm doing. Still, the Neopolitan-style crusted pizze were quite delicious in their simplicity contrasted against the vegetable delights from the bar. 

Given the many amazing gastronomically elite restaurants in this area of the Vegas Strip, it was a pleasure to enjoy such an unexpectedly satisfying if simple Italian meal to our senses for this price. Market Street Caffe, besides changing its name, could still improve in the little details --like the quality of the breadsticks, oil and balsamic that greet you as you sit down to a table-- to further make this a stellar gem of an eatery. Even still I will definitely visit again for its antipasti and pizze, and perhaps even to try its ""fancier"" dishes.",PqcCOVTDn2ni30CesN44Yg,0,0,4,QbdtgFjbDNn80ZIosEErww
3472983,2018-03-30,0,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,"Found this place while looking for prime rib downtown. The prime rib is $9.99 there and is the best deal EVER! The meal comes with an open salad bar also a baked potato side and a cherry jubilee dessert (which we were too full to have.) The prime rib was delicious, juicy and cooked to perfection. The place was pretty packed so we sat at the counter. The service was good. We will be recommending this place to anyone and everyone looking for a great prime rib!",UAWmXzHWLkTzlEzkmJ8OJw,0,0,5,kR4lyLioHyFsTbt52pv_MQ
4319978,2008-03-30,0,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,went her for a very late dinner. i ordered the bowtie lamb ragu and it was ok. my wife ordered the shrimp in the picture above. I tried it and the first bite was a 5. but she gave me a 2nd and 3rd bite from different shrimp. the 2nd bite tasted gross like the grill and the 3rd bite was blah. So i dont know what was up with that.,6oJzbP6dqPYoaSuCNKaITw,0,0,3,0qUPscL_j8TeRXP49ETGCg
4815082,2008-01-09,0,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,"Had my wedding dinner here and we were seated in the far back where the halfway curtains divided the room from the regular eatery seating. We had a 6-7 course meal which I'd say was good. The waitress who mainly communicated with me was professional and I'd say the service was on point.

They covered the main table seating with gold fabric. I wish they had all the chairs covered, but that's alright.  I provided them with all the decorations for the event as well as the seating arrangement and everything went well as planned.  We also had open bar which was nice.  Aside from all the chairs not being covered, I wish the room was more private and by that, I mean the curtains shouldn't be half @ssed. Rather they should reach all the way to the ground so it isn't hitting people's heads. Also, there is another room for a smaller party in which you have to enter our room to get to it so that's what I mean by wanting more privacy. Other than that, service was great. It was certainly a memorable night!",_vUC1P0GfLAD5UrMPAEwjA,0,0,4,JcpC0_uTayT13llapA7JxQ
4972447,2006-04-20,0,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,"Unimposing decor and not-over-loud music make this Italian eatery a decent destination if you're staying at the Monte Carlo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/5iSmZO0SrKU6EoXK_1M8Kw?hrid=Whqii9JW7q3XE1hVsNx3Pw).  Greasy breadsticks are served in a glass with dipping oil (we asked for balsamic) but no bread plates, so we made a mess with crumbs.  The bruschetta and market salad were good (both with no cheese).  The tomatoes on the caprese were underripe.  The steak was overpriced, but came with fat potato wedges and a small bed of spinach.

Vegan report: The bean soup has chicken stock in it.

Our waiter didn't even see us when we sat down (apparently another party so big was blocking our table). He didn't really pay any attention to us either, when we needed the check. And my chicken pasta was quite dry. It actually tasted like chalk. But the rest of the pasta was ok.",eZbcmXsKnruoFmUdsMi8gg,1,0,2,M-adGdaeVy4IyLMNUn8kBg
5840538,2008-07-15,1,ppmYIHMCIL5bocUsJSsDWA,"We visited this place for brunch and was seated at this booth in an alcove.  It was nice & intimate, but service was slow (thankfully we weren't in a rush to get anywhere).  I'm a huge fan of panini & immediately knew what I wanted - the Panini Di Melanzane (eggplant).  

When I received it, I was both disappointed & amazed.  It wasn't a grilled panini like I'm used to, but it was a large sandwich (possibly 10-12 in) that tasted delicious!",11f-LcmU54IIf-HUqMDeBg,1,1,4,8fAvrC4s2f6bOmJkKYoimw
