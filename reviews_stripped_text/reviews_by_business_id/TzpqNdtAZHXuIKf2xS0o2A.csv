We got the deluxe nachos are a pre game appetizer. It was delicious and it works as an appetizer for 2-3 people. The shredded beff quesadillas are decent enough and the chicken soft tacos are excellent. 
The prices were reasonable, but not the best.
My only complaint was that it took a while for the food to come out, but there were quite a few people there so it's understandable.

Honestly our experience was pretty good, I was not highly impressed but the flavors were pretty good. 
You walk up to the counter and order and they give you a buzzer with your drinks and you sit down and wait for the buzzer to go off. Once it does, you pick up your food. The menu items are limited to tacos, salads, enchiladas, chimichangas and a few soups. I believe I saw deserts too.

I ordered the Iguana chicken bowl which was pretty flavorful and was packed with black beans(my favorite), also rice, cheese and Pico de gallo. My daughter got two tacos al pastor.

I'm super-picky about chicken, especially at random Mexican joints and even more so in a tourist filled atmoshphere. My chicken has to be white meat and if they can stew it and it becomes shredded even better. THis actually is pretty rare (at least in Vegas) and I wasn't expecting much after watching a plate of nachos come out of the kitchen with that heavy cheese wiz sauce drenched on top of the chips. Ok, so 3 tacos are only $6 bucks and I went with soft shells and oh what a surprise and great value. THe chicken was stewed in the traditional mexican sauce of tomatoes and other spices and there were chunks of white chicken and shredded chicken overflowing on my three huge soft corn tortillas - yes soft corn. THe tacos were adorned simply with lettuce and shredded cheese, but the flavor of the meat was so good that i couldn't get enough. On my second night there, I tried the guac and all sides are just $1. The guac was chunky and had tomatoes and scallions and it was nice and cold and the chicken was equally good that night as well. This is solid homemade stuff and a shocking find for any fans of good Mexican cooking.

After hours with the kids at Adventuredome, we had worked up quite an appetite. Not wanting the typical carnival food being served there, but also wanting to return to more fun at the Adventuredome, we decided on this place since it was inside Circus Circus. 

Please slap me if I EVER try a new place without reading some Yelp reviews first. Had I done so, I would have gone back inside for a burger and fries. All of the horrible reviews you're reading are true! 

I had the  Iguana Chicken Bowl. The pico de gallo was the only thing I actually liked in the bowl. The chicken was dry. The beans were clearly from a can and the rice was completely lacking flavor.

My son had the shredded beef tacos. They were full of fat chunks and looked disgusting. 

Those in my party who had the shredded beef burrito thought it was good, but I suspect that the flavor was enhanced by the extra $1.99 I paid for guacamole to be added to the burrito. 

The guacamole! They were selling it with a few tortilla chips for FIVE DOLLARS!!!!
Not a nice big bowl of it. No. A tiny plastic cup of it. Barely larger than the cups they give you at Pollo Loco for salsa. 

FIVE DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!

You've got to be kidding me. 

And if all of that isn't enough for you to walk away from this place, the service was not friendly and the food took FOREVER to be prepared. I'm willing to wait for a decent meal, but if a dining establishment is going to serve SLOP, I expect the food to be ready in under 15 minutes.

Came here to eat last night because we were headed to Adventuredome and figured we would grab something near there. First of all the selections at Circus Circus are minimal. We settled on this place. Literally stood in line for 35 minutes. Got our food about 15 minutes later. 

Chips and salsa- 4.99 for this. The ""hot"" salsa tasted disgusting, and they literally give you about 15 chips.  Not worth it at all.

Burrito Grande- all I could taste in it was cheese, hardly any rice or beans in it. I only ate a few bites.

3 deep fried tacos- guess it was the only thing at our table that was edible. Bf said he wouldn't eat it again though. More of a survival eating lol.

Rolled tacos- this was for the kids. My daughter took a bite and spit it out and said it was disgusting. She usually loooooves taquitos. My son (2) took a bite and said it was fish. I told him it was chicken. Bf tried it and spit it out and said the chicken is old. I smelled it and omg it smelled disgusting. We felt so bad for giving it to our kids. I went to the front and they asked if I wanted to order something else...ummm no thanks.. Not trying to up our odds of getting food poisoning at this restaurant. They ended up giving us $10.25 refund (we also added the rice and beans to it).

My son who ate a couple bites was up all night gagging. Please avoid this place like the plague. Even if you are on the tip of death from starvation, I would suggest eating out of a dumpster before you eat at this place!!!",0AHEW2Rzvx23bluhbbPncA,6,0,1,lTwzsew0C_LQNJ_cHbeVLA

It would be slightly more forgivable if the restaurant were in, say, Pennsylvania, but Las Vegas is about as far West as you can get!  We both got burritos chimichanga style, which just meant there was some sort of bland, bright red, ketchup-looking sauce dribbled on top.  My husband didn't even finish his chicken burrito, which we both noted was a first.  But nothing tops (or bottoms?) the chips and salsa, which, in my opinion, is pretty hard to mess up.  My husband describes the chips as what you might find in an expired bag sitting in the back of a shelf at a 99 Cents store (not good enough for Dollar Tree, he says).  I would just describe them as cardboard.  Needless to say, we were sorely disappointed by the entire experience!

3170933,2018-01-20,0,TzpqNdtAZHXuIKf2xS0o2A,"So this review is definitely late, I stayed at circus circus back in June 2016 for EDC that year & let me tell you...I still think about my meal to this day.

Now first let me give you some back story. I'm Hispanic, I grew up a stones throw away from the border & my abuela on my fathers side was from Mexico & her food was the absolute best. Even people not related to her said so! So the food I'm going to review is not the typical basic Starbucks girl meal level of food, because that is not what I ate while there. Though I would like to note that that is what I saw most people ordering (things like burrito bowls & nachos).

The first good sign while I waited in line, all the ladies in the kitchen were older, brown skinned & speaking to each other in Spanish. Next, they had jarritos sodas on ice. And finally as I looked over the menu I saw Menudo & Elote (Mexican Street corn). And that is exactly what I ordered. And as I ordered it, the young brown lady behind the counter gave me that special grin/nod of recognition & I returned it.

Anyone familiar with menudo whose had a long night of drinking can tell you that a bowl of it the following morning is a life saver. And although I do not drink & rave, my body still felt like utter crap (I'm already a month away from being 30 by this point ok). Guys, that bowl of menudo legit breathed new life into me. The carne was so tender & juicy, the broth was the perfect level of greasy & had that beautiful pungent flavor that, when others make it, it can sometimes lack. The only drawback was they had no freshly cut jalapeño (this is why my rating is 4 stars instead of 5), it was canned. Thankfully though there was freshly cut onion, cilantro & lime. Despite lacking the fresh jalapeño, the menudo was still bomb AF & remains to this day, some of the best menudo I have ever had. I honestly can't remember if my corn tortillas were freshly pressed or not, but they were still very tasty.

The elote was great, but I'm not going to lie, it was my first time having it. I've never had elote from a street vendor in Mexico, so if others find it lacking, my apologies. I will say however that I have since tried recreating the recipe, it is now a staple at family barbecues & it is loved by all. I paired all of that with an mandarin flavored jarrito & a water & after that I was good to go. Had an awesome nap back in my room & woke up ready & full of energy for EDC day (night) 2. I didn't have the energy to return in 2017 as the hotel I stayed in that year was further up the strip & it was just too much of a walk after a long night of raving...but I would definitely stay at circus circus again just to be in close proximity to the blue iguana.",Rj6AT4rp338FN4OJvMayzA,0,0,4,_n5mjTDC-gS0WbREpbbj-Q

It was also the only ""taco sauce"" offered for my soft tacos but the ""taco sauce"" was really the same as the ""salsa"". I asked the cashier for condiments like sour cream and was told it was in the bag along with the ""taco sauce (haha)"" , chips and salsa and sour cream.
