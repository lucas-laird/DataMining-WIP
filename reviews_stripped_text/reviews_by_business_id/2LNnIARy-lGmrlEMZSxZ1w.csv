It's a drawing of the backside of a fat baker with enormous BUTTOCKS while he (or she, god help her) is bending over an oven.  

It was good for a smile.

Then I went inside and was in the bakery version of Disneyland. 

Too many choices.  I was on vacation and staying in a hotel room.  What was I going to get?  Because I could have bought out the store.  

I settled on an everything bagel, a soft pretzel, a cheese roll and a sourdough roll.

All of them were fantastic.  I wish there was a joint like this in my neighborhood.  Maybe it's best there isn't.  

Because maybe my buns would look like the logo.

If you live in Vegas, go there for bread.  You'd be crazy not to.

If you're out of town and driving home, stop there on the way.  You can nibble the crunchy crusts on that boring drive back to So Cal.  It'll make the time go by faster.

Note to the owners:  If you can, try and sell some butter and cream cheese on site.  You'd be doing us a big favor!",SJjW-Uat5Z3JIPwktHtmKA,2,0,5,KQbK4tHMys1j30E6mAOhLA

I wanted sweets so went straight for the raspberry Danish, an apple turnover, two rocky road brownies, a cinnamon roll and two muffin tops. Had a taste of everything and they were superb! My favorite was the rocky road brownies and muffin tops. Definitely fulfilled my sweet tooth :)

It is worth mentioning that more than half of the huge store was making fresh bread such as loafs, rolls etc. If I were in the market for some I'm sure those would have been great as well. It sure smelled fantastic!

---------

Hidden in the back of a little industrial park, the amusingly named Great Buns Bakery specializes in fresh-baked breads. 

I should warn you that there's nothing artisanal about this place; it's a large-scale operation, with all the baking done on site in a thoroughly charm-free industrial bakery. One of the employees told us that they supply bread to ""90% of the restaurants"" in the area, and there certainly were dozens of pallets of rolls and loaves stacked up right on the retail floor, tagged with the names of local shops and eateries. 

But 'big' doesn't necessarily mean 'bad': The breads I've tried all taste great -- the ciabatta in particular - and the prices are competitive. We picked up a loaf of day-old bread for $0.99 today, and it tasted just fine. 

I'll just ignore the fact that all the staff wear aprons that say ""Keep your hands off my Great Buns"".",xdk_0qlKbsrYQv7NLTU2jA,2,1,3,Jemuxbb4FVnc5V1D8KspTg

I ended up purchasing a jumbo cinnamon roll (this cinnamon roll was pretty big), a croissant, cinnamon stick that had a taste like a churro, a few raspberry filled pastries and a small shortbread cookie. Everything was really good, even the next day. I was surprised to find that some of our baked treats were not stale the next day.

We narrowed it down to two:  pineapple upside down cake and the cherry crumb cake and I picked them up on Friday, December 7th.

The pineapple upside down cake was, I hear, a HIT at my sister's house last night (my super sweet man brought me home a piece which I'm preparing to taste after my tea is ready).  What I can tell you right now, is that it is dense, looks amazing, and unbelievably priced at $11.00 (I rounded up a few cents).

The cherry crumb cake was wonderful!  It's amazing the difference you can taste in fresh pastries.  What I love about Great Buns is their pastries aren't too sweet, and they were very generous with the cherries in this crumb cake.

I also picked up some rolls for hamburgers.  Again, I love the difference you taste when you're easting fresh bread.  The rolls were fresh, large, soft but not mushy, and a good deal at $2.49 for a dozen especially considering the quality.

You walk in and immediately know by the aroma they are baking everything fresh. They seem to have every type of bread imaginable, from classic French bread to bagels to artisan raisin Rye bread. For pastries, they had Bundt cakes, cookies, muffins, cupcakes, and much more.

I went and grabbed a couple bagels, and after eyeing the pastries, I purchased the Black & White Cookie, chocolate Bavarian cupcake with white chocolate, and a banana Bundt cake.

My grand total - less than $6.00. Sweet!

The employees were pretty busy but very friendly, even when I asked pestering questions about what's popular in their store. There were a good number of customers buying enormous amounts of bread. I guess things sell out. Not hard to believe.

The bagels I tried were cinnamon raisin & sesame, and they were soft and delicious. I wanted to love the pastries just as much, but I didn't care for them, sadly. Very sweet frostings with not-so-good batter. Weird after-taste after a bite of the Bundt cake. :( 

I thought my experience at first gave Great Buns more than 5 stars easy. Even though I was disappointed by the pastries, I believe maybe the other items were fully capable of being delicious, just as the bagels were.

Then it's time to shop!  Great Buns is a commercial bakery - they supply many of the restaurants and casino F&B operations in town - with a retail outlet for you, and what an outlet it is.  Whether it's sliced loaves of sandwich bread (whatever you like; sourdough, marble rye, multigrain, etc.) ... or dinner rolls (regular, wheat, raisin, cheddar, etc.) ... or sandwich rolls (too many to name) ... big loaves of kalamata olive or raisin bread, foccaccias, and PASTRIES.  Strudels, danishes, you name it.  I haven't tried their fresh pastas, but they do make pasta on site as well.  Everything is very reasonable - they also have a day-old rack if you are on a budget - no more than chain-grocery prices, for a much fresher and tastier product.  Everything is delicious.

A classic to Las Vegas and I can see why. The prices are great and the Almond ring thing is OMG bomb! 

If you have been here you must. A huge family operated bread bakery wholesale open to the public. 

The Great Bun Bakery have been serving Vegas since 1982. The store front is super convenient and the goodies are yummy. My favorite is the Almond ring and the Black and White cookies. The Toasted Almond are crunchy and the soft buttery flaky crossing bread thing is perfection and to top it off the drizzle of the sweet frosting brings it all together!!!! The lightly sweeten frosting is paired perfectly with the soft sugar cookie that is not too sweet and not too bland. Yum factor 5stars. The eclair is pretty dang good as the Cannoli.

I imagined a mom and pop shop with a name as cute as ""great buns""  but actually found a full industrial bakery inside. There is so much bread in there, I couldn't wrap my mind around it. 

Forced to make some choices, I picked out a berry danish, flat bread with jalapeno cheese, pound cake, and a blueberry muffin. Best danish I have ever bitten into! Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The berry filling was not overly sweet or overwhelming, just right. The muffin could have used some more berries though, but the actual muffin cake was also sweet and fluffy.

All of this for less than nine bucks! I couldn't believe it - that only gets you a drink and a slice of pastry at Starbucks. This is the only place I'll go for bread products from now on.",umZPUpLSJuCTXLckxA4nmg,1,3,5,Oh71VUFWe0zMOzuyBwhDkw

I want to squeeze some buns in a bad way when I come here.    Hell, I want to put my face in a few buns and shake like a Magic Johnson's bobble head doll, and bite them in the sweet spot!    Okay, I'm not going to destroy a Apple pie like Jim in the first American pie movie, but  this place is really that good.

Great buns was so hot that it burnt down in 2007, and thankfully so because if it didn't, I would have not known about it.    By the grace of god, the bad news on channel 8, turned me into a new customer when it reopened.    It's a like a marriage coming to this place, you love doing the nasty, but hate working on the small details; So in other words, it's like eating a Bavarian ding dong and then working out for a couple of hours on the treadmill to burn it off.   

Great buns isn't your usual stand alone bakery, because you're self serving the majority of items, but like what Chris Tucker said in Rush Hour 2, "" you don't jump in front of black man in a buffet line""   (it stand true for me even thought I'm not soul brother number #1)...because some damn old lady snake the last Apple danish ($1.29) from me when I got there.   I should have put the smack down on her, and sang The Rock's WWE rendition of "" You look beautiful tonight"" while  taking it from her, but I'm a gentleman, and even opened the front door for her.   If I didn't open the door, that danish would have been MINE!     But then a ray of light shined down on me,  and another customer decided that they didn't need another Apple Strudel ($4.59)....SO I GRAB IT like quicksilver.    When I got it home, it was gone in 60 seconds!    It was buttery and flaky, and tasted like a Zippy apple napple! 

Then the next plan of attack was the white chocolate raspberry bread ($3.59), and a few ding dongs.   Those items are behind counter, and this bread made a great french toast.    The ding dongs ($1.39)  are King Kong sized compared to the  hostess type, and need to be kept cold because of the Bavarian cream....what the hell, the temperature currently in Las Vegas doesn't feel like hell at the moment, and getting them home is like stealing candy from a baby.

It seem this place has some kind of happy hour after 4:00 pm, and a good number of item are cut half off by that time.    I never quite make it here during that  time of the day, because most of the pastries are MIA or KIA in someone stomach by that time.   Most of their products are so sinfully good, that majority of them are naughtier than the crowd at Hard Rock's Rehab.  

Why a four star?   because if I don't make it there in time....it's gone till the next day.   Finally, for that Grandma who snake the danish from me.   I hope you broke your dentures on it, because I'm craving that darn thing right now like how Woody Harrison was craving Twinkies in Zombieland.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,8,6,4,Jdnp4sVBpcM6eUTo58T_Gg

I don't have great buns. If I eat here too much I might have great big buns though. A girl can dream, right?

Back to the bakery. Great Buns is really great. 
Great prices: 
$1.65 for pastries the size of the Sun
$.60 bagels 
$.95 Black and White cookies. These are my favorite because surprisingly they are a normal size unlike most deli ones and quite tasty, too. 

Great flavor. Everything is homemade and you can taste it. Am I a huge fan of the cheese danish? No. The pastry part tastes like pure butter if that's your thing. Also the Loch Ness Monster could be swimming in the tasty cheese part because there's just so damn much of it. You need floaties just to make your way through it. Every other item I've tried I love. Especially the coffee cakes. You cannot beat their taste and value. Perfect to bribe coworkers with or sabotage their fight to fit in that bikini. 

Great Service- I am not going to say they are great, but hey, they give me my sweets at a killer price. That's enough service for me. 

Only reason this isn't a five star for me is because of the Everything Bagel. Here is why. The bagel doesn't seem to have that strong salt flavor or garlic kick. It has tons of toppings, just not the ones that make Everything my drug of choice. Do I still get one every single time I'm here? What do you think? Also, they do not have cream cheese for sale.

On the plus side, I enjoyed these little artisan cheese rolls. They kinda tasted like cheese bagels, which I like. They seemed to have a great selection of different breads.. I almost bought the marble rye sliced bread but I didn't get it....

I also thought the large Apple pastries looked good, and I did get one and it was probably the best out of all of the things I purchased. It had a criss-crossed lattice layer on top, and a good amount of apple filling, and it was a very large size, and it was about $5. There was something called an Apple Horn that was $8 that looked good also.

On the negative side, the almond croissant was like.. not flaky or buttery at all like a real croissant. I would suggest Jean Philippe at Aria/Bellagio for a good parisian almond croissant.  These pastries kinda seem like the kind you would buy pre-packaged in a supermarket, the ones that have preservatives in them too...",vh8v72MaEqUCsNwWsslibg,0,0,2,g21jRhCeEuSnyhFzMmvxLg

They had a large wall of day old bread for 1.49$ a bag, I didn't look closely but I plan to on my next visit! They had bins of bagels and rolls and all kinds of other bread that you could by per piece or by the dozen. I think I even spied bread bowls which will be fab come winter! They had Danishes and cinnamon rolls that were seriously the size of a salad plate!
They require a minimum 5.00 purchase to debit and since I really was just planning on grabbing something for breakfast I had to alter my plan a bit..I got 5 Sesame Bagels, a mini chocolate swirl pound cake and a chocolate coconut muffin..for $5.60!

She told him it had no sugar added to it and it was whole grain. He brought home a bag and it was so good that he and I are both spoiled now. We don't want to eat any other bread. You really should try their farm bread. It is really tasty. We even have it with our dinner. Put a little butter or margarine on it and it is just to die for! DELICIOUS!

They have a great selection there - everything from dinner rolls to bagels to donuts to sandwich bread to all sorts of pastries. The pastries range from full-size to individual, and are mostly delicious, from what I've tried. They always have a great selection, and are always churning out more from the back (this is a serious bakery, and they provide lots of breads to local restaurants).
I always get the pastries, so I can't comment too much on the regular breads, but I know pastry prices are really good. You can get mini-strudels for like 50 or 60 cents, or a big danish for about $1.50. 
You fix your own bag and then check out at the register, so it's pretty fast, but it does lack some of that charm you may get in a smaller place. 
They are running specials all the time, especially on weekends when they lower the price on whatever is left over.
Ambience is like that of an actual commercial bakery, which is cool, but don't expect to sit down on the patio and eat your pastries while sipping a latte...definitely more of a to-go place.

Closed sunday. Day old bread is marked down on a tall rack on your right as you enter the bakery (so cheap, making it harder to resist). Different size buns, assorted rolls, baguettes, bagels, coffee cake, and assorted pastries are among the long list of available freshly baked goods. If you were planning to make sandwiches, the possibilities are endless. It's self service with the breads, complete with tongs, baggies, and ties. You get the pastries at the counter, where you pay. Also available here are black and white cookies (my husband likes this version better than Freed's)- but this one sells out pretty fast.

This is not the place for you if you're trying to avoid carbs. It's hard for us to buy bread in large quantities (unless we freeze it) since it's just the two of us. But it's great for large families, parties, especially a barbeque since it's budget friendly ($5 gets you a lot here). Get here early for the best selection (mon-sat 7 am to 5 pm) and know that this place is very popular with the older set- we're usually the youngest ones here, besides some staff. After all, it's the best place to get fresh baked bread in the entire city- non-Asian, anyway. The staff is busy but still remain friendly and pleasant.

I think they are extremely affordable, especially since it is fresh baked locally and not sitting on a shelf after being shipped from who knows where. Even when I have left with a full bag of goodies I don't think I've ever spent more than $5-10.

They have excellent breads and rolls. My husband is a huge fan of their Pretzel buns, but I'm partial to their pumpernickel bread which is hard to find in most grocery stores. They have an amazing cheesy focaccia bread. Fantastic coconut macaroons. Honestly, I have loved everything I've tried so far.

The best part of the whole bakery besides the freshness and selection are the prices! Very very affordable. Since the bakery supplies to hotels, restaurants and casinos, the sheer volume they bake means the public can buy these goods at an exceptionally great price. I bought several brownies, danishes, and cannolis for about $12 which at any given coffee? shop bakery would of cost me at least twice as much. Everyone was so sweet and helpful too. Some items are not self serve like the cannolis and brownies so the lady behind the counter had to box it up for me. She was very professional and friendly.

Apple turnovers: Hostess' & McDonald's are better (seriously); very little apple filling. 
Chocolate muffin: no flavor whatsoever. 
Black and White Cookie: below average. Anyone on the hunt for good B&W cookies will NOT find them here. Order some from these places if you're craving the real thing: http://newyork.cbslocal.com/top-lists/nycs-5-best-black-white-cookies/",KQrxa3RFlpFEYZEqmI9ySA,2,1,2,7f7joPVpfNoME6r_mb8bSg

They had a ton of fresh bakery products, from bread, rolls, pastries, cakes, etc.  The selection is abundant and is made in mass quantities.  That's where I think I was let down.  I got a cinnamon roll, cheese danish, almond croissant, and a muffin.  I could already tell that the quality generic just by looking at it, but I wanted to actually taste it.  Overall, the pastries were dry and practically tasteless.  I was hoping the cinnamon roll would've had cream cheese frosting, but it was just straight up a sugar glaze.  The cheese danish reminded me of when I was a kid and ate those Entenmann's danished wrapped in plastic.  On the bright side, the muffin was good, and their sandwich rolls looked tempting.

Prices, yeah I can't fault them at all, it's CHEAP!  I'd maybe come back here if I were given a task to buy 4 dozen pastries for a club, on the cheap.

I love my pastries, breads, croissants, donuts, cakes, etc.  And I really had such high hopes for GBB.  I'm not comparing it to Jean Philippe Patisserie, Bouchon, or even Paris Baguette but man, it's sad that I've had better tasting bakery products from Safeway.

Opened in 1982 and baking fresh bread on East Tropicana for more than ten hours a day from Monday through Saturday since 1988 it was finally on Saturday morning that I made my way to Great Buns Bakery and although often exalted by locals as some of the Valley's best bread my experience unfortunately proved average at best, the high-scale production and bargain basement prices harkening ingredients and methods no more impressive than that of the average corner store.  Owned and operated by ""4th generation bakers"" per the in-store propaganda and prominently displaying its New York-Italian roots in several of its offerings it was to a quarter-full store that I arrived just moments shy of 9:30 and with elderly servers otherwise occupied I took my time to peruse, the largely automated operation whirring in the background as several younger staff members took turns restocking shelves.  Treated to samples of crumbly sour-cream cake on the backside of the counter as I wandered past a pair of chillers it was only after ten minutes that I finally crafted my order and although neither the red velvet cupcakes nor cornbread I'd desired were yet ready a half-dozen items tallying $7.26 were soon boxed and ready to go, my first taste of a still-warm pretzel roll enjoyed as I exited the shop originally giving me hope of things to come but eventually proving to be the only standout of the bunch.   Clearly not expecting the quality of Bouchon or Bonjour given the obvious discrepancy in price and production it was after a short drive and with coffee in hand that my sampling continued and starting small with an entremet of apple strudel the taste simply fell flat, a dry puff pastry with artificial tasting filling that carried right over a slightly superior tart again compromised by a core I'm rather certain was Smucker's supplied.  At this point with expectations decidedly dwindling it was into a soft almond croissant that teeth tore and discarding more than half of the doughy debacle before tasting a fairly forgettable black & white cookie I thankfully found some solace in the sticky pecan bun with ample notes of butter beneath a lacquer of cinnamon-sugar drizzled nuts.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,2,2,zivQS1XtCQx7SQ0GScYQJw

All this came to only $7. I've paid $7 for only one tasty treat at many establishments they were just mediocre. You cannot and will not beat Great Buns wholesale prices, nor the quality.

Sure, there are a number of fancy ""patisserie"" places, but fewer traditional bakeries of this caliber.  They also had an array of various breads and other sweet pastries in the American/European tradition.

However, the best part of this visit was that I had my apple turnover, Danish, and cinnamon stick all at around 1:30PM...no need to wake up extra early for fresh baked, since the stuff moves so quickly out of the door that they keep the ovens going constantly.

From bakery to bakery you will find that the sugar content changes even when comparing what you think are ""like"" products. For instance, a cream puff, if you are at a french bakery the cream puff may look the same but they generally go lighter on the sugar ingredient so you may even be able to detect a slight egg taste in the pastry, Jewish bakeries and Mexican bakeries also tend to go lighter on the sugar so although it is a tasy treat I often walk away thinking it was good but I have had better. Great Buns bakes the way I like it. The Cream Puffs a light and fluffy and sweet like I believe a dessert should be. Not sugary, mind you, just sweet and delicious. Obviously there are bakeries that have slightly changed their recipes to meet the American sweet tooth market and this is one of those bakeries.

As an extra bonus, if you call them and tell them you are looking for a certain treat such as a Napolean, if they don't have them available that day they will try to accomodate your request by making them the following day or day after.  They have always been wonderful about trying to fill your sweet tooth cravings for you.  BTW Napoleans are very hard to find around town and theirs are to die for!!

I highly recommend this bakery to everyone!,2Rn8O1u9i0LdKHGY_uulig,0,0,5,bXCdELgHNoOKu7LvmlMEBQ
