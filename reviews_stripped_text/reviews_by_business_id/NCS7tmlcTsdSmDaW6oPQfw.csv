239379,2017-12-23,1,NCS7tmlcTsdSmDaW6oPQfw,"Alright, so today was my 2nd try here, and I'll give it to them, they are new and still working out the kinks, cool I get it. Now the 2nd time coming, I really gotta say that the workers who are working the line up front NEED to communicate with the cook in the back, or at least write the orders down so that way people aren't only getting half of there order and the cook not knowing about the other half. This happened the first time, and now the second time, not with just me but with others too, getting the wrong order or not all of it. Also, when the cashier handed me my sandwiches and I didn't get my fries with it, they were trying to tell me it doesn't come with fries? Uhm, then why does your menu say ""Sandwich combo's served w/ French fries""? Luckily I believe the owner or manager stepped in and corrected it by giving me my fries, little annoying but ok. 

Now, the food is good, but nothing super crazy. I'm a fan of the Frita Cubana (Burger), good flavor and the sauce is very flavorful. I also ordered the Pan Con Lechon (Pork Sandwich), now this was a huge let down cause it looks good but it had no salt or very little, nor any sauce to moisten the meat at all, it was just bread and shredded pork. Could have been a fluke with the cook cause he did look a little flustered with orders, but come on now that's basics. The fries that I did end up getting were steak fries, again with no salt. Bummer. 

In all honesty, I do feel the place has potential, but it just seems like there are a lot of people who are very inexperienced working there that are hurting the business, not to mention it's ""Cash Only"". The place inside looks nice, and spacious but maybe instead of investing in how the place looks, maybe throw some attention to staffing, at least with an experienced kitchen worker who knows how to multitask and communicate with his cook so that way orders aren't being forgotten. 

I wish this place the best, maybe they'll figure it out later down the line, but at the moment, I can't say I'll be spending my money here.",6cqR0iGintrGB7tkhcj-wg,5,1,3,Z3oisOd1Hf0bdLb4-acbjQ

and you only get 2 sides (versus 3 sides both at
Carlito's Cuban Food # 1 and El Tinajon. Also,
the workers at Havana Express are terrible when
compared to the family operation at El Tinajon
and the super efficient and friendly workers at
Carlito's Cuban Food # 1. I had hoped Havana
Express would be OK too but I am not likely to
return anytime soon.",MPlMQddB2VlkpE7DtxJh9Q,3,2,1,qj4200nc7DDqlbO__FJcNw

Prices aren't bad but then the food reflects the prices. Food was indeed bland and fries were chewy. Nothing I ate was fresh. Felt like a leftovers meal. Just being honest. Never really ate cuban food so def disappointing.",AVn_anp_BMadEU1FNrQL7g,2,2,2,d49ceavgfo30xLRbyD0ViA

It be nice to know cash only before you stand in line for 10 minutes before they show you a little sign that says ""cash only"".  Service was ok. Just opened so ill give you another try pretty soon. Im all about supporting my Cuban community,  but please get it together. Thank you.",dnxZqcAJeHY2_TeXv1tyqw,0,0,3,7zdHWhVALpOS3y4NHgiPRg

2735280,2018-05-13,1,NCS7tmlcTsdSmDaW6oPQfw,"I had seen this place a while ago. Stopped by a few times to see if it was open. Nothing. Then my friend and I were running errands and noticed people inside so we decided to stop and order cafe con leche ( coffee with milk) and a guava pastry. 

Delicious!!! Coffee was hot and sweet. Guava pastry was crisp and recently baked. 

Customer service overall can definitely use a pick me up. 
Following day went in again. Ordered the same thing cafe con leche but instead of a guava pastry I ordered toast with butter. Took them 30 min to get that ready! 

This place has great potential! They seriously need to get someone to train them and figure their stuff out.",kg4vJpfrblZRMVSAR8CEkA,0,0,3,dbMJf9bBcC0IFoCnxE6yZg

Sitting here eating hearing the Cubans speak around me gives me that home feeling and I love it. I will be back for sure.

3114057,2017-12-19,0,NCS7tmlcTsdSmDaW6oPQfw,"I like to support my cuban community, and like many Cubans a cuban sandwich is the perfect lunch meal. Unfortunately this place is not great, or good. Or even mediocre. I had the cuban sandwich and it was just terrible. Bread was not cuban bread, way too much mustard, Swiss cheese was not melted there was a ton of ham and barely any pork (lechon). The taste was awful, or rather lack thereof. I wish it ended there. But it goes on to even the smallest of cuban items. The ham Crogueta were mush inside and so soft on the outside it fell to the ground. I would be upset if it was worth it. But it wasn't, seeing it fall to the floor was a blessing. This place is spending alot of money on the facility, they need to spend money on quality. I'll give them another try, but with 3 other cuban places up the street is gonna be hard for them to stay open. Save your money and go to Cuba cafe where the food is a bit better. I recommend this place to make a trip to California and try a Portos cuban sandwich. Maybe they'll learn how to make it. At this point, I'll just stick to making them at home. Thanks for trying. Wish this place the best.",6lmpr-WllUmPk094mpvQ_w,7,2,1,Y84QH9J7YmubPqkPGu6EJA

Pricing is very good and affordable .  The manager William Villanueva is so helpful team player always helps his staff clean or help ring up customers. Very nice person. Food is always fresh here not like Carlito restaurant where food seems like it's reheated from day before though out the day. And you come smelling stinky and have to have a shower right after you eat there. Also what I love about Havana express is that they have so much Cuban culture in there restaurant. Another plus is that they have AC . That's a big plus for me especially living in vegas with this heat is AC. Carlito it's super hot inside there only a few tables to eat at and your sweating while eating your food. I really recommend this restaurant ignore what these other comments are saying it's a great restaurant. Very clean , people are nice and have amazing food. If your looking for something to eat that's authentic and cheap come to Havana express they really take care of you with there large portions.",nWpMTIbtxbq0FtT2L10NPw,0,0,5,BIluOoypO_pqszXUYhZGPw

Mainly you are served food from whatever they have prepped on the food line and it's always good. I seem to be there a lot because it's good.

Just like eating at someone's home, flavors & cooking styles may vary among restaurants. 

I had a great low cost meal on Th 5/17/18. Service was great. I was greeted right away & allowed time to decide on my meal (I hate being rushed). 

I had the pollo asada, moros, & maduros 
(Roast chicken, black beans & rice cooked together, fried ripe plantains).

This $5 combo: Real food, was good, the price was right. 

I'll be back to try some other dishes.",wIH9huA5PCkvoOSycvK5oQ,0,0,4,AKa4IFoRbAQdcfJLURwdgQ
