1357591,2018-06-05,0,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,"My job moved offices to Summerlin and we all decided to try chinese food. I ordered chicken fried rice and it came in one of those cartons. There wss alot as there was no way I could finish it all. 

I can't speak on the service or the ease of ordering but I know she placed the order and they were there fairly quickly. We now work at a secured building so she had to go down and get the food since they couldn't come up. 

Now onto the taste. It was very bland, no flavor, dull, and not worth my money. I will never order from this place again. But beggars can't be choosey and we were hungry so this is what we got unfortunately.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,1,0,2,qraMbfhQijkb6eE5wHZ0Ig

Very attentive and food always comes out very fresh! I've been to various China go go places but this one is great! After a Red Rock hike this definitely hits the right spot. Not to mention a chill atmosphere. Good job guys!",rC_ib_qwwZfymrkBhiXakA,1,0,5,zhsVHP9aBNK4HLinadjyHg
1890148,2018-04-18,2,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,Great food for a great price. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but VERY good. Worth it to fulfill a craving.,gO3rmVzHqfF3qXS6vJhw8Q,1,0,4,O2Oejs3Rg7pqIgrsxmKANQ

2827488,2018-04-19,1,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,"Not gourmet by any means but among the best quick Americanized Chinese food places in area.  Kung Pao chicken was spicy but flavorful.  Not just hot.  Beef and broccoli had fresh veggies and lots of meat. Lunch specials are a fantastic value.  Get soup, rice, noodles and entree for 8 bucks or so. Cheaper than Panda and light years better. Service was quick and efficient.  Friendly staff.",VfLnL3x7WvpzOTZzpGdipQ,2,0,5,Fh_jxGqKHjFnBBgf5ZyauA

Don't let the out of they way area fool you.  Ordered for the first time here & was impressed by how fresh the food was & how delicious!  The best Chinese food in the area & I have tried all of them during my visits to this side of Vegas.  The price is on point & the people were friendly.  The Pad Thai was yummy.  My husband loved the sauteed garden
vegetables!  The veggies were cooked perfectly, crisp & flavorful.  The steamed rice that came with the meals were fluffy not hard like the other places.  Looking forward to trying out the other dishes.  Thank you China A GO GO, will be back for more.",Jtv25cE7ZTfJCkLtlz41uw,0,0,5,Q9es3RsLzRrHhC1olVQCmQ
3127947,2018-04-25,0,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,"Had tea duck, ribs and wings. Tea duck tasted like putrid carcass, ribs were drenched in corn syrup sauce, and wings were tasteless but covered in numbing jalape√±o and scallion topping to mask the lack of flavor. Went there for take out to accompany a movie late night and I highly regret trusting the high reviews. It turns out the place gives out fried rangoons to those who ""show"" their Yelp reviews. This place should be taken off the list. Yes, it is that bad.",343T9Czi4k-D4cBch9baow,1,0,1,cE5LpJgyOQfjo7eXCmyoOQ

3362319,2018-06-23,0,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,"Later than dinner should be on a Friday night, Hubby & I headed down the hill to our neighborhood Chinese fast food spot. No longer China One, we had a bit of trepidation about this newcomer, China A GoGo. We shouldn't have been afraid - the hostess treated us royally & threw in an order of egg rolls, just so we could try them. Completed fresh, not oily, good quality of meat, fast, served with a smile... what more could I wish for?  Had plenty to take home for tomorrow's lunch and at a very reasonable price. Next time, if we're feeling it, we'll order in & eat in our pj's. For tonight, heading over there was a nice break from cooling off in the pool & listening to music. Nothing incredibly special, just the perfect meal for a chill Friday night. Thanks for taking the reins so aptly, China A GoGo!  We'll be back!",JX1oFRvbUZ3GdCCcl3gAnQ,0,0,5,Yx54GrZUkl6hhj2Q14arDQ

4448759,2018-04-17,0,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,Today was the second time we ordered takeout from this location since this new restaurant has been here ( formerly China One). Our first experience was very good. We had wonton soup and chicken with asparagus both times. The first time the wonton soup was good and this time the wontons were soggy. The chicken dish had white breast meat the first time and thigh meat this time. We weren't sure if the dish was even cooked fresh. We were disappointed to say the least with our dinner tonight. I hope our next dinner there will be better. It will be a while before we return. The staff is friendly and the manager was a nice gentleman when I met him our first time around.,UudAzJ5K5Inq7ItxY_3bJQ,2,0,3,ukIkLoMG4cRtpWspe8-bFw

The banner outside says 'NOW OPEN' so I'm not sure if they just opened up or are now just under new management. But I can tell you this, the people who work there are super nice and very friendly!! The food is delicious and made fresh! The portions per plate are very generous and they cook everything pretty fast and are accommodating to food and allergy needs! 

I know this is a franchise so I'm not sure what the other locations are like, but I can highly recommend this location!",ocM0Pge7viQv-UZDRvzCwA,2,3,5,9rpYTZS9mG5onXafk3yD-g
5121944,2018-06-14,0,6WRVv6S1IWR0nt4Lr2w7Og,Awesome taste and excellent value! We stopped in after an exhausting hike in nearby Red Rock Canyon. The Mongolian beef lunch combo was made to order to my personal level of spiciness. The texture of the beef was perfect with the mix of onions and green peppers. Lots of fried rice (with plenty of vegetables) and lo mein were included. The lunch even included a nice fried pastry dessert and fortune cookie!
