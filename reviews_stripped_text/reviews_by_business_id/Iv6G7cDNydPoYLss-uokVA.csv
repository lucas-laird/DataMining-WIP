955080,2017-05-22,0,Iv6G7cDNydPoYLss-uokVA,"My daughter was hungry after school last Wednesday and wanted Carne Asada fries so I took her to Roberto's on Nellis and Vegas Valley. The place was very clean, spacious, and there's plenty of seating there if you want dine-in. 

In addition to the Carne Asada fries, I ordered two Carne Asada burritos, and four chicken tacos ($1 on Wednesday's). The burritos come with only steak, guacamole, and salsa. To me, they were just OK. The meat didn't have the grilled flavor or much flavor. I also wish they'd add rice or cheese or just something else to the burritos. I will say that they are a decent size, though. Very filling. As for the chicken tacos- the meat was dry and flavorless but they give you plenty of it. And, they're only a $1 on Wednesday's, so I guess I can't complain too much. To add flavor I just added the green sauce that they have in the self serve area. 

My daughter loved the Carne fries! We even went back today to get her some. The fries looked amazing! Lots of meat, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and picco. They come with beans too, but she requested they exclude them. You get so much! 

I like how they place utensils, straws, and napkins out so that customers can get the amount they need instead of having to ask for it. 

As long as my daughter keeps wanting their fries, and service is up to par, then I'll be back. She loves this place.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,1,0,4,bh4KoMhTCEZOxpdRgb0Fcg

2477799,2012-10-13,1,Iv6G7cDNydPoYLss-uokVA,"Picking up a few things around the corner at CVS, Bear and I were trying to figure out what to have for dinner.  He found Fatburger across the way, but neither one of us was in the mood for THAT. What he wanted was good Mexican food, which sounded alright to me.  That's when I remembered that a co-worker of mine, who's also a local, RAVED about Roberto's.  We'd already seen a few of them around, but hadn't yet taken the plunge, so it was settled.

NOW I get the raves.  Quality-wise, this is DA MUY BUENO BOMB-DIGGETY. Bear had the chicken burrito - which was HUGE - while I settled on the chicken chimichanga, which was REDONKULOUS. Paired with a beef quesadilla, it looked (and felt like) enough to feed an army...and at a reasonable price! Yet unlike your typical fast Mexican food, say, that place with the bell and the chihuahua? THIS was good stuff, yet not at all heavy or greasy.  It took some time to finish so we didn't have leftovers, (which we couldn't have taken with us, anyway), but I didn't feel like I needed the entire defensive line of the Atlanta Falcons to help roll my ass outta there when we were done.

The place was pretty clean and the service surprisingly fast for a place run by just two guys behind the counter.  As a local myself now, I sure am glad there's a bazillion Roberto's around town, so we can find one whenever we need one!",_Mz4d66zzJUX830jTwCgIQ,2,2,4,2XFTpD9MCLYFq1ah16VbJg

Of course, the service will always differ between the various locations around the city. But this Roberto's, in a rather unassuming neighborhood of East Vegas, offers an excellent mix of all the good things you come to expect from the chain.

A recent remodeling may have had an impact on this place. I don't know what it looked like before, but it looks good now and I think that has an affect on the staff as they are friendly and do an all-around good job.

The last time I trekked to this Roberto's it was probably 4 or 5 years ago. I remember it being a kind of greasy taco shop in need of a major upgrade. Ya, the food was okay, and the place was... eh.

But I came here today for a torta and the shop is really nice. The tables are clean and the entire kitchen has been turned around. The employees are nice too and my food was served up quick. I was the only one there at the time.

I ordered a carne asada torta with everything. I enjoyed this torta. I felt as though it was well made, like they actually put thought into it. I have had so many tortas that I felt were just thrown together and the guac was dripping out the sides, the pico was all runny and gross. But not this torta! It helps that it was wrapped up very tightly in the waxy-paper and then the aluminum foil. Plus the bread was hefty. It wasn't a light bread. Therefore, even though the sandwich is juicy, the bread is holding up to it. I have had a lot of tortas when I got to the bottom I just tossed the damn thing because the bread was SO mushy and gross. Not this torta. The bread was only just a bit of mush, so I could eat it with no problem.

I didn't realize this Roberto's had had a little renaissance. Now that I know, I'll probably be back more than once every 4 years.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,4,IyFI4fkG4gITgUGoNzqDfw

I wasn't crazy about the tacos but the burrito was great.  A couple of my friends had the same thing and another had a torta.  She raved about it.  So, next time I go that will be the move I make.

The folks working here could use a little more personality, in the kitchen there's a stack of tortillas 3 feet high, the burritos are smaller than what I see in SoCal, the prices are about the same and the joint is cleaner than most.
