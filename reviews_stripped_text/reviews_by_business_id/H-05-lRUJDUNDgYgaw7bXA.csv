Food was excellent, but it took forever to get to us. Two servers on a Saturday night? Really? It looked as though the place was regularly frequented by after party people. You can't accommodate for that?

It was Christmas day, and Ihop was very very packed.. we waited for 20 mins to be seated. Ok, understandable. 

What was not understandable was we had to wait another 10 mins to even get greeted. Someone came to our table and said, "" what would you guys like to drink?"" 
We politely answered ""water"" and let him know we were ready to order. He said, ""Well I'm actually off work and just helping [insert name here]. She's the one that will be taking your order."" Okay, whatever.. 

Another 5 minute wait, and [insert name here arrives]. She takes our order, and we're good.. or so I thought.

Chris points out that none of the tables in our section have their food. Red Flag.. we really should have left right there and then. They were here first and that meant they would get served first before us.

Needless to say, the guy that was off work already helped our server, thus making it a somewhat faster process. We did get free oj, compliments from our server, which was nice. Food was good. We quickly ate our food and headed back to our hotel room. Just in time for check-out. 

Since we did go during a busy period, I do not know if this is how slow it usually is. I did read other reviews, and apparently they are slow.

Every time I've come here the service is horrible. The wait staff seems like they have better things to do than their job and I've truly felt like I was intruding on them for a sec until I realize that yes, I'm in a restaurant. Usually when I've come there's three, maybe four tables occupied in the place. It might as well be twenty with the lack of follow up or any other presence after serving the food. Perhaps each table should come with a bell, as I'm uncomfortable peeking my head in the kitchen or wherever their hideout is.

I want to give them no stars but that's not an option, so I am giving them one star because I was never approached by a waiter/waitress after we were seated. We were seated in a booth in the corner and it was a little a busy when we arrived but the patrons that we were seated by had all been served and we're getting ready to leave. The table that arrived after us and were seated next to us were approached first. The waiter took their drink orders and left. He returned and delivered their drinks and left again. By that point we have been sitting there for more than 15 minutes. We waited a couple more minutes thinking he was going to come back take our drink orders and he didn't. So we just got up and left. 
I will not be coming back to this IHOP again. None of the waiters acknowledged us at our table even to say we'll be right with you. We had the menus open and the kids were doodling on their kid paper kid menus asking when they will get to order their food. I had to explain to my kids why we were leaving because they asked on the way out the door. I told them it seems like they don't want to serve us so we're going to eat somewhere else. 
If you are the management of this establishment you need to teach all your employees customer service. If someone at the restaurant came up and said someone will be right with you we probably would have stayed.

The waiter was pushing me to order, I guess within his own time frame.  It's $3 for crappy coffee.  IHOP does not stand for creative cooking but their only dish with egg whites is so unimaginative my dog could have cooked it.  I gave the waiter a $100 bill.  I was owed back $87.31, and the waiter gave me back only $87.  The manager? noticed I had a quizzed look, I told him I wanted my 31 cents, so he went to the cash register and gave it  to me.

I arrived on a Sunday morning at 11am and put my name in.  Table for three was available about 11:30.   Service was quick and we ordered immediately.

Despite the menu noting that my breakfast came with hashbrowns, the waitress returned 10 minutes later telling me that it did not.  I said fine, then tack one on.  10 minutes later, the hashbrowns showed up.  That was it though.  I let them sit, waiting for the rest of my food, waiting for my friends' food, and there they sat, cold and sad.

Another 10 minutes passed and the waitress came by, noted we didn't have food (she hasn't been by since telling me my blueberry pancakes didn't come with hash browns).  Another 15 minutes passed and then our food arrived.  12:05.  My pancakes were wicked cold, as was most of our food.  My friend received scrabbled eggs instead of overhard.  The waitress said she'd bring him new eggs but instructed him ""don't eat those.""  Like what they were going to bring them back and serve them to someone else?  It was at least five, but probably another 10 minutes before his eggs returned.

We ate quickly (we had somewhere to be) and then spoke to the manager on the way out.  He did cut the bill in half, which was nice.  Otherwise my OJ, pancakes and hashbrowns would have been $15 or something.  Yeah, umm, no.  I wouldn't be back.",BYRv-SvbYvV-f9udppsrog,0,0,1,5dpc3dodmqEfTyBKPJ7xdw

 It was one of those epic drink-all-night, gouge-your-eyes-out in the morning type of nights. We had been drunk for twelve consecutive hours. The clock inside Ihop read 4am by then, and we had just crash landed. Smoking cigarettes in the sweet morning making haste down the back streets of Maryland Parkway. We had a fierce need for pancakes and coffee in ceramic mugs. 
 I could hear the plastic clock tick away on the wall as they tried to sit us in a booth next to a crazed, screaming child.
 ""No dice,"" I told them, as they told me about their no smoking policy.
 We sat at our booth isolated, alone but for our coffees. Outside, behind shades I acted sober. But internal intoxication was driving me to madness, urging me to act out wildly.
 But we sat and ate our overpriced breakfast with great delight as the the staff loomed over us keeping each coffee mug full. Processed breakfast high fructose corn syrup is a devilish delight, even after this much debauchery.  
 Just as things were starting to get comfortable, in strolls a couple in their late 20's with two children. The youngest was carried by the dad and they strode in first. Behind them was mom, handling the reins of a five year old. Leashed to his captor, the child barged in quickly but was pulled to the floor by his bonds. The child wailed like a stuck pig, a sound which increased by about five decibels as the mother grasped for control of the leash.
 Unable to maintain control, our group burst out laughing with no restraint. The Hostess, also unable to restrain her self cracked the smallest of smiles, that the mother instantly reacted to. The family scowled back at us and the mother swore at us across the once wholesome restaurant, ""I'll spit in your coffee you fucking freaks!""
 Just like that, the event degenerated into chaos. Immediately the Ihop management leaped into action to regain control. The staff seated them next to the other crying baby from before. We were clearly on our way out as the corporate mangers circled us, telling us we had to leave. I could only retort to the mother:
 ""Monkeys have more freedom than your kid.""
Outside we offered to pay, but to our surprise, we found our sacrifice rewarded as we were told did not have to pay. We packed into our beat up sedan muttering; ""Nice way to get a free meal"" and then ""Who's ready for another drink?.""",bCBZRE1Jo_LnJkdrNSc6KA,0,2,5,Kyv6V60LMG15A0lfQQusOg

This location was a little over a mile away from our hotel, so we were here in a flash and walked in just before noon for some breakfast.

Parking in the huge lot that they share with Firestone was a snap, and we were immediately seated at a booth in their air conditioned environment.

The menu was bigger than I expected - with tempting pictures.  It's been decades since I've even uttered the word IHOP in a serious way, so my tummy sat up and took notice.

I passed up the T-Bone Steak & Eggs and the Sirloin Tips & Eggs and eyed the omelettes.  The regular omelettes' egg batter has pancake mix in it, to ""make them more fluffy"", so I chose to get the healthy and fit omelette (not served with pancakes like the regular omelettes, but served with fruit instead).  It's made with egg substitute:

Spinach, Mushroom and Onion Omelette, add steak, no salt - served with a mix of cantaloupe, honeydew and grapes, this omelette had fresh leaf spinach, big mushroom slices, and diced onions and tomatoes.  It was fresh, tasty, and the added steak was pretty good. 

Bf had the Sampler - bacon, sausage, eggs,  hash browns and his beloved pancakes, which were indeed fluffy and yummy.

Bf's OJ wasn't fresh squeezed, but the service was very attenttive and the food was so frrsh that I won't fault them too much for the juice.

I think its proximity to the Strip lends a hand to how busy it is most of the time. You can come in this IHOP any day of the week and at any time and you will find quite a few patrons. 

I've been here late at night after clubbing on a few occasions (many years ago). Most recently I went with my husband for a mid-morning breakfast on Saturday. It was busy, they had all the sections open and plenty of wait-staff to attend to the amount of patrons.

I ordered an omelet of some kind, my husband ordered something similar. IHOP's menu doesn't change much, besides their addition of specials, which usually run congruently to whatever kid's movie is out at the time. 

Our food was decent, came out quick enough and the waitress was nice. Overall, it was a generic IHOP visit that I am sure is within its corporate restaurant standards.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,4,L6WNTmavjjCN8UAkRtfwZA

5641011,2015-02-19,2,H-05-lRUJDUNDgYgaw7bXA,"Made the mistake of stopping by for breakfast during our last trip to Vegas. This IHOP's location is a couple of miles off the strip so we chose it thinking that it would be less crowded but when we reached it was packed with a bunch of folks waiting outside. We put our names down and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. As that did not seem too bad we decided to wait it out. Finally after 30 minutes we got a table but as the servers were in over their head things just progressively kept going downhill. First they took out drink orders and then after a long wait got our drinks, then disappeared without taking our food orders. We had to literally corner someone to take our food orders followed by a long wait to get the food and finally another long wait just to get the check.

The food itself was terrible. You could see that something was just thrown together so that it could be sent out the door. I got the country Fried Steak ($12.99) while my friends got the Classis Breakfast crepes and the Californian Scramble. Only my order was delivered correctly mainly because I took it as-is without customization. The other orders either had incorrect sides or wrong ingredients, but were consumed as-is as we did not want to wait another hour to get replacements. Taste was pathetic. I like IHOP but this was literally the worst meal that I have ever had in an IHOP period. The egg's were burnt on one side and undercooked on the other, the hash browns were looking for an excuse to fall apart, the steak was dry as a rock and the sauce had absolutely no flavor finally pancakes seemed soggy and flat. Feedback on other dishes were similar. Crepes were soft and mushy while the California scramble lacked seasoning. One of us got a Vanilla milkshake which was the only decent thing that was served to us that day. I don't even know what to write about service. Each round we had to deal with someone else. Asked for water no ice, got it with ice, asked for hot sauce, got it at the end of the meal, did not even dare to ask to correct mistakes in the dishes served. It was not like there weren't enough people, just that they were running around clueless.

Without exaggeration it took more than three and a half hours to get a breakfast which gobbled up half our day in Vegas. If you plan to come to Vegas to spend half a day eating breakfast please do make this IHOP your destination.

As we started looking around we realized that there was still a huge waiting line in front meanwhile there was about 10 open seats right where we were seated. Most of the guests that were seated befor us still hadn't received their food.
