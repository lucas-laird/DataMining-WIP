64566,2017-12-09,0,N95IG-T9bbR2iNL9_an1SQ,One of the best fast food taco places I have ever ate at.  I originally received an email for one free taco after signing up for their newsletter.  My husband and I tried it out for lunch and it was so good we went back for dinner.  Then a week ago I was a winner and received a $25 gift card.  Today we went for lunch had the tacos again and a caramel churro.  The bill was over by about $3 and they called it even.  There are not many places that have amazing food and great customer service.  This place has both.  Definitely will be frequently Me Gusta Tacos!!!  Can't wait to try them for breakfast!,zEBbl5itGxRWWnNmHAQnow,0,0,5,rx8pRWmSElGjOiSRNiJ6kQ

Before I could respond, I was already being asked for my order.  I informed the counter person that it was my first visit and asked him what was good.  He started describing every taco on the menu which is fine, but I can also read.  Finally he revealed that the Bahn me taco was the most popular, and that the chicken was, well, chicken. Whew, I thought it was gonna be something other than chicken.....I ordered the Bahn me, the fish and the carnitas.  2.50 for a soda! Now I know why every single reason there had a water cup.  You've been warned! Bahn me taco-spit about half the filling out as it was to hard to even chew. Carnitas taco-became carnitas in a bowl as the tortilla was so soggy it disintegrated on first bite, however the flavor was good. Fish taco- the fish was so small it couldnt be seen under the mountain of red cabbage. No surprise they were trying to hide it, as fish should not be clear unless it is bad.  And the taco fell apart on fist bite. Oh, I also got a side of rice....2.50, again.  Burnt grains in the top, half cooked and crunchy on the bottom.  If I had to guess, I'd say it was about 2, maybe 3 days old. The salsas are good, especially the habanero...overall I'd say pass, unless that all sounds good to you.....",4d_MNc0bCJ0ZVyVmSYbZEg,0,0,2,ghcGdU-QHOr5oL91-Tfsyg

I was NOT impressed with the food at all.. very very disappointed.. chicken taco was extremely dry.. Carne asada taco WASNT EVEN CARNE ASADA.. the texture was so gross and squishy like jack & the box meat... And carnitas was to salty. I couldn't even put limon on my tacos either since they are greedy with those as well. For 3 tacos they gave me 1 half of a half lime.. wth!! The only thing exceptional was the salsa! Very spicy but delish. I would never go back there and eat again. Not worth my money. If the owner revamped the menu and put some Mexican love in the food it would be amazing.

I got the California burrito with the carne asada. I love the concept of putting tater tots on the burrito. It was delicious but the carne asada was not anywhere near the best I've ever had. Pretty dry. But overall I liked it. The green salsa is amazing but they don't give you a lot. They should have containers near the salsa station so you can take some to go.
My boyfriend loved his burrito but said the habanero salsa was a bit too sweet. He liked how spicy it was.
We also ordered the shrimp ceviche. It was nothing special. Still good but wouldn't order again.

1400152,2017-11-19,1,N95IG-T9bbR2iNL9_an1SQ,"Me Gusta Tacos are fusion taco and burrito geniuses. We were lucky enough to try their food during their first day of business and it was so good that our whole office had to go back for lunch the following day! I always had their Henderson location on my bookmarks but never had the chance to make it out there so I was ecstatic to find out they are open really close to my workplace. This is probably going to be a dangerous thing for me because I'm probably going to end up eating here every lunch break. The service is extremely friendly and you can tell they're really passionate about their food. 

Their Kalbi Mission Burrito consists of sweet, Korean kalbi paired with pico de gallo, guacamole, cheese and spanish rice. I was also able to try the Carnitas Mission Burrito and the meat is so flavorful and tender. The Carne Asada Taco has queso fresco crumbles and it's really refreshing since I'm used to usual places just adding the typical shredded cheese.

Their salsas are awesome! Mildest to hottest-- Roja, Verde and Habanero. I'm not a fan of super spicy but a little bit of habanero on my burrito gave it an extra kick. It's sweet at first then somehow, it hits you hard at the end. It's reaaaally good. 

I also loved their Pineapple Basil Agua Fresca. You can really taste the basil but it doesn't overpower the sweetness of the pineapple juice. I was also able to try all their churros-- original, caramel filled and bavarian cream filled. All had a sweet cinnamon sugar exterior and the texture was crunchy not soggy or chewy. My favorite would have to be the bavarian cream. I think the caramel was a bit too sweet for my liking and the bavarian cream balanced out the cinnamon sugar more so I prefer that. 

You know it's so good when you're still eating your food but you're already thinking of what you'll order next when you come back. Be back real soon, Me Gusta Tacos!",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,2,1,5,0Dtgt77MJXY5qvqvXDLoiw

Tried: galbi taco, carne asada taco, and the banhmi taco. My favorite was probably the galbi. It had the most flavor, and good balance of meat, sweetness and slaw. The banhmi tasted more like a bulgogi taco than it did banhmi, but good nonetheless.

Also tasted the black bean salad. It was good, but after a few bites of it, didn't care for it as much. Maybe good to share when eating tacos...

The fish taco is also amazing and not heavy at all, fresh citrusy fish and a hint of horseradish. Now I don't like horseradish normally, but for some reason the small amount works well. Burritos are also pretty good. If I'm feeling like I want cheat, their burrito with the tater tots is dammmmn good.

Walking in, the establishment is clean and bright with a flair of green decor and with plenty of space! 

We were greeted and offered to try their agua fresca right off the bat, yes please! They had four flavors to choose from: pinapple basil, hibiscus, pepperment horchata, and watermelon. The drinks vary each day though.
I ended up picking the pinapple basil flavor for its refreshing yet mildly sweet taste.

I had the 3 tacos for 9.50, and it did not disappoint! One thing I noticed is that the menu incorporates Asian food, I was so excited to try their ""kind of"" fusion menu at that point. The three tacos I selected was the korean kalbi, pork belly banh mi, and carnitas.
The kalbi taco was my favorite, they marinated that beef with the best sweet flavor you can imagine. There is a generous portion too! It actually spilled out for me, but I didn't mind picking the spilt goods with my chips.
The pork belly banh mi taco definitely tasted like traditional banh mi sandwhich, minus the baguette and pate paste. The pork belly went well with the white radish/daikon and pickled carrots.
Now the carnitas, very tender and tasty! Not the best carnitas I've had, but it'll do.

You can also pick your sauces in the back left hand side. They come is squirt bottle, and there's enough for everyone! You can pick between salsa roja (spicy level 4), salsa verde (spicy level 6), and the salsa habanero (spicy level 9). The roja and verde salsa was not spicy at all to me, so it's perfect if you're not all about that spice. But the habanero kicked a good punch in terms of flavor and spice!

I liked how the staff came to check on us, asking if the food was alright. Keep it up! I can't wait to come back to try all the other tacos, and give a go at their churros... I will be back!",AAUPbv9rhQs8LDeqGgWVCQ,2,1,5,v5aSExroZr0MV7kE-eiOfA

They offered samples of the aqua frescas as we walked in. The hibiscus  was good but the cantaloupe was calling my name. It was refreshing and a delicious compliment to the habanero salsa. We ordered 2 plates of 3 tacos & it comes with chips. The chips are comparable to Chipotle & just as good. We went classic on my son's tacos & more adventurous on mine. They were all very tasty! Our least favorite was the vegetarian & barbacoa. Originally from South Texas, we do barbacoa very well. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't comparable. The vegetarian made for a great salsa for my chips after adding the habanero salsa. It was stuffed with the tiny cut veggies. Very pretty and colorful-the standouts were just so phenomenal! Our favorites-the Korean kalbi (never had before so can't compare it), the delicious roasted corn with bacon (a side you MUST get), & the Pork Belly Banh Mi.  OMG!!! I love the flavor of pork belly but can't stand the thick pieces of fat. This was cooked so beautifully that you get the flavor of the pork with a few crispy edges, minus chewy fat. Wow! The banh mi vegetables tame any taste of fat with their crisp, tangy accent. I highly suggest!!! I usually judge a taco joint by their salsas. I didn't even let a drop touch my 1st two favorite tacos! That's saying a lot for this Texas girl! We loved this place.",TEu0-O9zELyZZcNdFEehEg,0,0,5,3QLTjjXu18eZ24fPV2WMaw

I ended up getting one each of the Pork Belly Banh Me, Korean Kalbi, and Fish Taco. The Pork Belly was cooked to perfection combine it with Veitnamese Slaw perfect marriage. The Korean Kalbi another favorite the meat cook on point with nice flavor (I could have had just the kalbi action by itself and be happy) and again Asian Cabbage Slaw so good. Just fan of nice slaw compliment protein brings true taco to another level. The Fish taco  just might have been my favorite if had pick on of the three. You get a nice piece of fish again cooked on point. The wasabi creme gives it different twist then normal fish taco. The warm Tortillas chips come with is hell of addicting. 

The house salsa they have three different ones from Roja, Verde, and Habanero. The Habanero warning it legit HOT!  I know with heat and salsa every restaurant different. It up there for my experience comes to the hottest salsa ever tasted. All you need is couple drops good. The Roja is very mild but nice depth of flavor. The Verde had nice balance between the two. They keep them all in squeeze bottle in little refrigerator. I thought that was pretty cool. Not like salsa station fill up cups. They had ample amount of bottles. In the bottle perfect way get even salsa across your taco. 

Don't forget use your yelp check in. I forgot so never tried the Agua Fresca. 

The restaurant I like the interior very spacious, clean, and great place to hang out with friends. I plan on coming back cause the menu has a nice diversity from Burritos, Bowls, Sides, and Churros section that sounds hell of good.

The entire family likes coming here, meaning even my super picky 11 year old. The food is always fresh and good. It's not traditional Mexican food, which is a nice change from what you usually find around.  

My favorite item is actually a bean salad with carne asada. The tacos can be ordered individually or three, and you can pick a different meat for each one if you want. My other favorite item is the roasted corn, that comes with bacon and cotija cheese on top. 

They have four different ""juices"" that change regularly. I like the basil pineapple and usually stick with that one. I tried the peppermint horchata and it wasn't bad, but not for me. Those two flavors just weren't meant to be together in my opinion. 

I think they are reasonably priced for eating out and getting really good fresh food quickly. Probably $8-12/per person. Go. You'll like it. And try the salad at this taco place.",1GbtKqRpDAfv13fUYIBBmA,2,1,5,sLl0ITQOrqUzoYMSiEiWPA

I ordered three tacos; two Korean Kalbi and one Vegetarian. My boyfriend ordered the California Burrito which was delicious. I liked the Kalbi Tacos because they were flavorful, juicy, and nicely portioned. The Vegetarian was lacking flavor so I wouldn't suggest that taco. Even with hot salsa.

However, their website specifically states it's Mexican style food. So back to the day I went, I went hoping to have some ""Mexican style"" tacos and boy was I disappointed!!! These tacos are in no way Mexican style. I would perhaps give them a higher star review if they were a fusion since they have kalbi tacos and other different types of meats and ingredients. I also had their carne asada tacos, which were really unpleasant to my taste. My husband in his side didn't mind them but said they had no flavor. The tacos he had were barbacoa and those weren't terrible, the carnitas tasted like cinnamon in the meat, personally I did not like them and neither did he. The drinks were also disappointing in our opinion. He had peppermint orchata and it tasted more like a peppermint with water and milk.

This particular review is going to be on the Carne Me Gusta Bowl and pineapple basil drink I personally had. I really recommend this since it is a very healthy alternative to an actual burrito without getting the carb guilt. The bowl came with soft quinoa, crunchy cabbage, tender steak and tangy mango dressing. I added my two favorite salsa's the green and habanero for the extra spice and enjoyed every bit of this dish. When the spice would get high I would took a sip of the pineapple basil agua fresca and cooled off with this cold refreshment.

My second time here, so there's a lot of pros and cons. Haven't tasted everything yet, but well on my way.

First off, the staff and interior. Just great on both counts. Everyone I came in contact with was nice. And by nice I don't mean Polite. Well trained cordial staff is one thing. This is different. People here are nice, jovial, and just very laid back while still providing great customer service. Not forced at all.  To go along with this the interior of the establishment is spotless and well designed. Very bright and open, with everything  being in the right place.

Now the food. Overall, the best tacos I have ever had, with a few dishes trailing in the back. Let's start with the stars of the show.

Korean Kalbi. I've had this twice and if there was a more perfect taco I don't know what it is. Just the right amount of beef, seasonings and veggies. I normally don't care for corn tortillas, but these little babies are the right consistency to hold up to a semi-wet filling. I could eat these things every single day and not complain.

Char Broiled Carne Asada. There's not a lot of times that I can almost complain about too much beef, but this one's right on the cusp. For a little taco, there's so much flavor and volume to this thing it's almost ridiculous. Subtle char flavor on some nice cuts of meat. My second favorite for sure.

Barbacoa. This is the most traditional of the dishes I think, and they nailed it beautifully. Rations of beef to toppings is spot on. Little juicy so prepare for some mess, but it's well worth it.

Fish. My least favorite. Not much taste. More like a fish stick with a little bit of salad. Overdone and no flavor. Definitely a pass.

Ceviche. I have mixed feelings about this. The dish itself was fresh, and had the right proportions of shrimp to onions and avocado. However, they added some spice to it I cannot quite put my finger on. Neither cumin nor cilantro. Just not sure what it is, but it ruins the dish. Whatever it is it overwhelmed everything else, including the sour lime taste. If I can't taste the lime in a raw fish dish, I'm definitely out. 100%.

Nachos. I know I say perfect a lot in this review, but I really have to lay one down here. These are nachos. Just the right amount of cheese to guac to black olives and black beans. That's right folks; no olives and black beans equals no mas nachos. These bad boys are the real deal and should be in the dictionary as the very definition of what nachos should be.

Aqua Fresca. This is an unqualified review since I've never had it before, but this might be my favorite new drink in the entire world. I asked for the pineapple fresca and it was amazing. I think there might be pineapple and basil in it, I'm not sure. Regardless, it is so delicious I might visit just for this drink. 

Salsa. Whoever makes the salsa here should get a congressional medal. It is the best salsa I've ever had. Their green salsa is fantastic, but the habaneros is my new obsession. It is sweet to start out with (mango maybe?) and then it lights your a$$ up something fierce. Not a lingerer, but definitely a solid face puncher. Super, fantastically hot, and then just mellows right out. I know some pepper heads just want the ultra hot rush, but this delivers a great taste with a great experience. Ask for an extra serving and then put it on your eggs the next day. Super, Duper, Delish.

Two major complaints to put out there. 

One; someone fix the freaking tables! They wobble more than a six year old getting off of the Teacup ride at Disneyland.

Two; change your location. Y'all are literally a 90 second car ride from my place. You're way too close to be this great. :)

We love tacos, and each chose 3/$9....they come in an environmentally friendly container with chips. 
Sorry, I don't remember exact names but between us we had veggie, pork belly, bahn mi, and another pork choice. Every meat was marinated and cooked perfectly. The vegetables and slaw topping were very fresh. 
There was also 3 house made salsas, verde, roja and our favorite habanero....it was sweet with hints of orange peel? and very spicy...sooo good. 
The restaurant was very clean with modern minimalist decor....and the gentleman who was at the counter was courteuous, knowledgeable and stopped by our table to ask about our experience.

3519521,2017-12-27,38,N95IG-T9bbR2iNL9_an1SQ,"I recently came by this Me Gusta Tacos location for lunch with some friends. The manager was nice enough to let us push some tables together so we could all sit together. Inside was clean and there's a good amount of tables. The menu says they offer all natural meats, sustainable fish and real fruit agua fresca. The food definitely tasted fresh and the salsa that's made from scratch on site each day is very good. One friend couldn't get enough of the salsa verde while I couldn't get enough of the salsa roja. They have a ""spicy level"" on each jar, but everyone at our table agreed that it's off because the spiciness simply wasn't there like indicated, though still fresh and delicious tasting.

Stacked Tater Tots ($7) - Tater tots, mild cheddar cheese, guacamole and sour cream. The tots were crispy and tasty. I really liked the fresh taste of the guacamole, but there was a lot of cheese melted at the bottom and I'd have liked the cheese to be put on more evenly on the tots. 

Roasted Corn with Bacon ($4) - This was very flavorful. Bacon was freshly cooked, the cheese added great flavor and the corn had a nicely roasted taste. The burritos are so big that the corn was enough for a couple of us to share making the price reasonable for such a fresh and tasty side. 

Me Gusta Bowl ($7) - Quinoa, roasted corn, red cabbage, avocado, queso fresco with mango dressing and your choice of meat. I chose the shredded chicken and it had good flavor. This whole dish had great flavor and I didn't even add the dressing. 

Carnitas Tacos ($9.50 for 3 tacos) - Pork, pico de gallo and avocado on a corn tortilla. The tacos were filled with meat and tasted great. The fresh avocado slices really capped it off. A side of tortilla chips came with the tacos, so don't forget to use some of the fresh salsas on the tables on them. You can get small plastic containers of salsa for take out orders. 

Steak and Egg Burrito ($8.50) - Carne asada, scrambled eggs, guacamole and mile cheddar cheese. This burrito also comes with a side of Breakfast Tater Tots, that have cinnamon or some sort of seasoning on them that tasted really good. The burrito was filled with a good amount of meat and eggs and was my favorite of what I have tried from here. Great price for the portion. 

Korean Kalbi Tacos ($9.50 for 3 tacos) - Korean steak and Asian cabbage slaw served on a corn tortilla. Others liked this at my table, but I didn't. Hubby found a long black hair in his (it was remade with no problem) and some of the meat was still raw which isn't something I am a fan of.

Caramel and Bavarian Cream Churros ($2.50) - There was a good amount of cinnamon and sugar, but these churros could have benefited from something to dip them in like maybe whipped cream. Chocolate sauce would be great too. The caramel churros had enough ""wet"" in the middle to work, but the bavarian ceam churros were a bit dry for me. At $2.50 each I don't think a dollop of whipped cream would hurt. 

Some of the other items tried was the Shrimp Burrito which some felt had more rice than shrimp, the California Burrito that was filled with tons of meat and flavorful, and Fish Tacos that I didn't try, but others seemed to like. I'm interested in coming back to try the Spicy Bacon Burrito. Since they are focused on serving healthy items, you will not find any refried beans on the menu and instead they serve black beans.

My husband had the kalbi, barbacoa and carne asada tacos. I had the fish, carnitas and pork belly banh mi tacos. 
Our first reaction is that these are just a hair bigger than street tacos but almost twice the cost. 3 for $9.50 or 1 for $3.50. However, after tasting most of them, we agreed it was worth it.
He really liked the 3 he had.
The carnitas taco was pretty good.
The fish taco had zero salt on it so the only thing I could taste was a faint hint of wasabi in the crema. It looked really good but I couldn't taste anything on it.
The banh mi taco was to die for. The pork belly was deliciously and perfectly cooked. Combined with the pickled carrot and daikon, this pairing was heavenly.
We both agreed that the tortilla chips served alongside the tacos were amazing. They have that homemade taste and feel. Very fragile and thinly crunchy, expertly done. They also have that almost-too-salty taste that I just adore, especially when mixed with their delicious green salsa.
Will be back for some more of those banh mi tacos and tortilla chips, when we can save up again.

The meat of the Carne Asada, Pork Belly, and Korean Kalbi were really well seasoned however I do feel like the tacos overall were lacking in toppings. I do like that the star of the dish is the meat, but I do feel that the tacos need additional toppings or sauces to bring it all together and I do feel like this is where some other places like Bruno excels in.

I'm not a tater tot eater. But something made me go for those stacked tots. Definitely one of my better decisions in recent memory.  Gooey, cheesy, guacy deliciousness.  Highly recommended, especially if you are nursing a hangover.  I was not and chose them on a work day, sending myself into a food coma and an afternoon siesta. Whatta way to go. Yum, yum, yum.

I've also tried the California burrito. While tasty, it was a little on the heavy side for my taste, probably the combination of a flour tortilla AND tots inside. Me Gusta is pleasing to my belly. It's prices are on point, the food tastes fresh and a place like this was much needed in the SouthWest. Welcome to the neighborhood.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,2,0,4,oNqtZpK4sgeHXgyF-agZCg

4182722,2017-11-29,0,N95IG-T9bbR2iNL9_an1SQ,"I love tacos and this place just reaffirms that. I had 3 tacos that came with a side of chips. I ate the pork belly, kalbi, and carne asada tacos. They are just a little bigger than a street taco so 3 was plenty for a meal, especially with the side of chips. 

In the restaurant there's a little mini fridge with some salsas you can bring back to your table. A red salsa, green salsa, and habanero. Each salsa is labeled with the level of spice where red is 4/10, green is 6/10 and habanero is 9/10. They all taste amazing! The habanero is definitely 9/10. Though, I feel like the red and green are backwards. The green is a sweet salsa, and I'd give it 2/10 for a spice level. The red has a little kick, but it's not really spicy. That one I'd give a 4/10. 

I also dig the decor of the place. It felt modern and clean. Interesting take on the fake grass on the walls. I lot of taco joints always feel a little ""cheap"", for a lack of a better term, that make you say ""yup, this is how I picture a taco join"". Me gusta is more of ""this is how a taco joint should be"". I can't wait to bring some people in to try it out.",1csYUsGUX4vwHH-YmRTgQg,2,1,5,-gTXVQFwUGtJOj4K7ntRJg

After ordering the California Burrito we went to get our soda. They have a small cooler with freshly made salsas, each a different heat level. We had to try all three!

The burrito came with chips. Not sure if they were homemade, but they may have been. They were good, nice and crispy. We split our burrito. It was very full, and with nice flavor. Our favorite ended up being the Salsa Verde. It had excellent flavor. The fact that it was chilled was a really nice treat. 

The shredded cheese inside of the burrito was not melted at all, but it was still pretty tasty. 

I love that they use recyclable trays/bowls for their food. No Styrofoam here!!! 

The atmosphere here, the cleanliness, the great staff...oh, 3 different people came to check on us to see how we were doing!!!, the fresh food...this is the reason why we will be coming back.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,7,2,5,9N1RBw_tIEubIh1IvZ4Vsw

Also, they have a unique selection of agua frecas, including a strawberry lemonade one that was the perfect addition to my taco plate.

The Nachos were a tasty, perfect, blend of chips, sharp cheese, Black Beans, diced tomatoes, sour cream and a generous portion of homemade Guacamole.   Altogether, the Nachos were a healthy combination of texture and flavors.

I had three tacos.  They are ""street taco"" size, but if you're expecting a hole-in-the-wall, greasy taco, you're going to be disappointed.  

These tacos are a fresh and modern take on an Old World favorite.  I had Carnitas, Korean and Fish.  The corn tortillas were soft and pliable. The meat and their appropriate spice blend were tasty. The cabbage or other greens were crisp, fresh, and in the correct ratio to the taco size.

The Korean tacos are unique and like nothing I have had before. They are great... They also have barvarian cream filled churros which are a must. The salsa is in bottles and the habanero one is pretty hot which is great. It is an interesting idea to not have a salsa bar and have the salsa's in bottles.

I have tried the  Pork Belly Banh Mi, Charbroiled Carne Asada, and Korean Kalbi tacos so far and I got to say that my favorite is the Pork Belly. As for burritos, I have tried the shrimp burrito and it is the best shrimp burrito I have ever tasted. The shrimp's seasoning definitely gives me a Vietnamese take and I absolutely love the Mexican-Asian fusion available on their menu.

Now open for 19 months at The District at Green Valley Ranch and recently expanding westward to 7425 South Durango Drive just across the road from Glazier's it was for lunch on Friday that a visit was made to Me Gusta Tacos, the clean and spacious build-out from a prior occupant giving the place a somewhat sterile feel that is quickly remedied by friendly service.

Best described as fusion, the ownership previously involved with Rachel's Kitchen deciding to expand their fresh and healthy eating portfolio to Mexican food given an eastern twist, guests entering Me Gusta Tacos will immediately find themselves greeted by a pair of servers who offer to help first-timers navigate a menu divided into several sections with Tacos front and center, seven types of Meat plus a Vegetarian option made daily on site in addition to three styles of Salsa made ""at least twice a day"" depending on demand.

Joining the quick-casual movement that many diners seem to enjoy white keeping lights bright and offering both an ""I love Tacos"" mirror as well as wall signage for Instagrammers, it is after payment that patrons are given a number and offered the choice of high-tops or standard seating, a spot at the window overlooking the parking lot selected with food arriving in less than five minutes, a housemade Agua Fresca proving very clean and herbal without a lot of unnecessary sweetness. 

Changing up beverages daily, though the best-selling Pineapple-Basil is apparently a mainstay, it was as baskets were delivered that squeeze bottles of Salsa were additionally offered, the flavors bold and descriptions of spice level entirely accurate despite the fact that labels were accidentally switched around with both the Roja and Verde compelling enough to warrant eating two accompanying orders of crispy Tortilla Chips.

Starting off three Tacos, a $9.50 value with Chips as each Taco is individually sold for $3.50 otherwise, it was in an attempt to sample as widely as possible that the tasting got started with shredded Pollo topped in Pico de Gallo, Cheddar and Avocado, the flavor of the Chicken unfortunately a little overwhelmed by the toppings though this certainly was not an issue for the spicy Barbacoa and tangy Kalbi with both cuts of Beef tender, moist and nicely accentuated by their condiments.

Equally intrigued by the Burritos as by the Tacos and Bowls, everything available in a healthy or Gluten-friendly version by way of simply removing the Tortilla, it was after some debate between Mission or California-style that the latter was selected, Queso Fresco subbed for Sour Cream making the housemade Tots stand out even more boldly in terms of texture while the slow-cooked pork was aromatic and succulent.

Rounding out the afternoon with one of three Churros, a version filled with Caramel selected over Bavarian Cream or traditional Cinnamon and Sugar for no particular reason, suffice it to say that those who've experienced Churros in Mexico City or Barcelona will likely be unimpressed by the texture as oil penetrates deep, thus making everything a bit too heavy, though the flavor itself is as sweet and decadent as the ingredients would make one suspect.

****Not claiming to be ""authentic"" in any way, the focus instead on quality ingredients and preparations that can be adjusted to fit most dietary restrictions, Me Gusta Tacos offers another locally owned and healthy option for those seeking an affordable lunch or dinner option in the rapidly developing Southwest.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,7,4,L9oT-SlEIxm0vS-bNuHIlw

This location is much larger than their first location at The District at Green Valley Ranch, but parking may be a little hard during the lunch rush hour. 

The food here is very simple. Simple tacos, simple burritos, simple churros. If you get too complex, it's a little overwhelming. Me Gusta Tacos got it right! They also have three salsas with three different degrees of spiciness. I do like that they keep the salsa in the refrigerator to keep them cool! 

I would admit, Me Gusta Tacos wouldn't be the first place I'd go to get tacos. But it's still a great place to eat at if you're close by and just want something simple! Or if you want warm, crunchy churros!",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,6,2,4,0TNad_aoFlFq59UexMaRsw

Pork Belly Banh Mi Tacos - Interesting take on tacos and done well.

Shredded Pollo Tacos - Exactly what it is, nothing over the top.

Kalbi Tacos - Probably my favorite choice of meat as it had the most flavor and was tender...similar to Kogi...havent had Kogi in 4 years but I want to say they are similar...

Carne Asada California Burrito - Ok in flavor but I hate that fake guacamole super smooth shit....just like I hate nacho cheese sauce or places that put fake cheese on their nachos.

Roasted Corn with Bacon - Good and has that same tangy taste as some Mexican candy....

Pineapple Basil Agua Fresca - Sooo good and the flavor is something new and unique. This and the kalbi are the highlights of this place for sure

5492474,2017-12-19,2,N95IG-T9bbR2iNL9_an1SQ,"I don't really get this place...maybe I was expecting some more authentic flavors or just better quality.  The carne asada was flavorful but the tortillas were completely falling apart as I was eating them.  Most of the places double layer them to prevent this from happening but not here.  The salsa we had seemed very watered down, even salsa from a jar tastes better.  The kalbi burrito was also completely underwhelming, it didn't really taste like kalbi.  Th chips were in the take out containers....maybe that's why they were slightly chewy.  Most places put the chips in a separate bag so they don't get wet or soggy from the hot elements.  Anyways the only highlight of the meal was the churro, pretty delicious...but could have used more bavarian cream inside.  I think they were pretty stingy with the cream, quite a few bites of churro with no cream.  Maybe breakfast burritos are better here....",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,5,1,2,vePeE24nQ3QLdlk7GLTjnw

I love Me Gusta Tacos Food, every time I am at the District I have to stop by, especially during the summer they are right next to the splash pad, so it was on for the summer.  Even if I didnt order there food items, I would alway go in for some refreshing drinks, I love homemade fresh drinks, my favorite is the watermelon, it's so darn good and it would alway quench my thirst.  I really wish I could grab a Beer and enjoy it while I watched my son frolic in the water, but drinking in the heat is alway a no go for me.  My absolute thing to order here is the Korean tacos- they have a very sweet and savory flavor- plus I love marinated KOrean bbq, so converting it into a taco is genius idea. I love the slaw that is layered on top and even putting some of their homemade salsa is a must!  Plus I love the fact that my son can grab an inexpensive kids meal (cheese quesadilla) and he's set!

Firstly I live in Rhodes Ranch and ordered via UberEats. It came in record time so you would think it would have been nice and warm-think again. The carne asada burrito had hardly any meat in it and was cold, the rice was used to fill it. Looking at it looked so promising but actually taking a bite made me say; WHY DID I NOT GO TO TACO BELL AND SAVE 20 DOLLARS? My son's quesadilla was cold, the carne asada taco was miniscule. Chips were used a lot as filler for the plates to make them look good. My daughter loves guacamole and this is about  the only thing I can truly say was done right (and the salsa at least had a ""bite"" to it). Otherwise I will definitely be heading for the boarder....TACO BELL next time. Very disappointing considering I wanted a non fast food taco place to get good Mexican.
