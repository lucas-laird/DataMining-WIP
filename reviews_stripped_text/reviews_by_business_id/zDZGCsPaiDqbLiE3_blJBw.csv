She spent two days in our hotel room suffering so i called her DR in California. We came close to going to the ER but decided to follow her Nurses Instructions. The hotel had to help us with her as she couldn't get up . Shame on you all for selling such awe full food to customers, shes 83!! The hotel had to help us get her to our car to get her home . Four hour drive to get home to California this ruined our vacation .",a5ULuzCZ_hsrGuZcTrH3ew,1,1,1,wQ8ip0Ezg5Sjm3sPpfJAHA

We walked in to the first available eatery and it happend to be one of the greatest food experiences of our lives! We had the Chinese cuisine: the server was hilarious and was very friendly and outgoing. The food itself was more than enough to keep me coming back! Very large portions and every morsel was a tantalizing delight. We loved it and highly recommend.  Hopefully the tacos and pizza will be as good as the Chinese food for the next time we come to Vegas!

If it's early in the evening, just get the single soft taco of your choice (made from an assortment of barnyard animals and their parts) while you're on the go.  If it's late, you might go for the three taco plate with a dollop of rice and beans for under $8. The tacos are relatively small and are ""street"" sized.  And, if you need more beer, they serve it.

At first thought, it has a mall food court feel. Multiple genre of foods which is served quickly. I been here on multiple occasion and every time, I am never disappointed.

2921747,2015-01-17,5,zDZGCsPaiDqbLiE3_blJBw,"While walking along the Fremont Street Experience I noticed the International Eatery food court.  It is located in the Neonopolis building across of Wall greens.  On Tuesday night I walked into the food court for dinner and noticed the pizza booth, the Chinese booth, and the Mexican booth.  I opted to try the Mexican booth. Other customers came into the eatery and they opted for the pizza booth as well as the Mexican booth. The workers at the Chinese booth was luring customers with free samples of pork or chicken to gain business.

As I was looking at the menu items at DJ's Tacos I noticed MENUDO and asked the server what it is in menudo.  He told me that menudo consisted of tripe and corn.  I told the server that I have been a fan of MENUDO the music group and that I never had menudo the dish. He then offered me a sample of menudo the dish. 

I ordered my menudo dish as well as the tacos. Can't go wrong on $2.00 taco. Since there were three small tacos I asked for three different meat fillings. Chicken, pork, and beef with mild sauce topped with lettuce and cheese (there are other topping ingredients for individuals who want more on the tacos).  I also ordered a large beverage drink to go with my meal. 

Since the International Eatery is a food court I checked out the public restroom. Both the men and women restrooms are locked and individuals need codes to access the restroom.  I received the code from the server at the Mexican booth. Once I opened the restroom I noticed that the floor was littered in certain spots with paper towel and toilet paper. The toilet stall that I ended up using was out of toilet paper. Really??!?? No toilet paper....loose money. Some previous customers even left their cup drinks on the floor and sink area of the restroom.

Overall it was an average food court with little food booths to choose from.  I just wish the janitors would check up on the restroom area more often.",OO4O6q-jI8pnDEQt4WvRhw,8,6,3,UJyJMFvDzC61BrFzjdBHJg
3236173,2017-09-14,0,zDZGCsPaiDqbLiE3_blJBw,"I came here when they first opened and I can't tell you how happy I was.

While at work, I get cravings for some Chinese food & Chinamax provides that for me.

I love their fried rice, bourbon chicken and egg rolls. 

There are two other restaurants in here, a Mexican place & American food station.

Now, I haven't eaten at the Mexican place but I did have a pizza slice that was amazing! Topping tasted fresh and the portion is good for the price.

This review is about the Chinese food. I had recommended this place to my coworkers and they agreed, this eatery has good Chinese food and the price is just right.

The service is friendly, and specialty dishes are made to order.

If you find yourself in downtown Fremont, this food court is centrally located in the beginning of the Fremont experience & know that for a low cost, you can get your Chinese food cravings, Mexican, or Mexican dishes in one place.

There is also seating available inside with air conditioning to keep you cool from the Las Vegas heat.

Recently opened is also a juicery stand to get refreshing blended Boba or fruit juice to keep you refreshed as you explore Fremont.

Enjoy!

No cares about the people that just ordered, only caring about getting things cleaned up and going home. This continued all the way till they locked the doors.

5946166,2014-11-12,1,zDZGCsPaiDqbLiE3_blJBw,"I am not a big fan of this place. I have eaten at each of the counters within the International eatery, and was not impressed at any of them. 

The Italian food was reheated. I ordered pizza, and the server had burned the crust, but still served it to me. When I asked for a different piece, the next one was lukewarm coming ""right out of the oven"". I'm assuming the burned piece was to get the pizza to temperature when reheating it. Either way, totally gross.

The Mexican counter is okay, and definitely the better of the 3. I had a burrito, which was humongous and impossible to eat by hand. It was bursting at the seems and quickly fell apart. But at least it tasted good after I asked for a plate and fork. The server was...less than stellar. And their soda machine was broken of all the drinks except water or lemonade. I wish I had known this before ordering a combo and realizing my options were very limited. 

The Chinese food was not the business. I grabbed a plate to-go so I could take it with me on my lunch break. I stuck to my usual staples at a Chinese restaurant. But the meat (both the chicken and beef) was extremely fatty and off-putting. I ended up throwing it out, and my money down the drain. 

Now that the company I work for has moved two blocks further away, I don't feel the need to make the walk to grab some food from this place, as there are definitely better places to eat. I guess it was take it or leave it after all.",Q1s8saWck0a5pGbi4Xe0cA,0,0,2,OSBQ16sXgr1KqTm9Yen4-w
