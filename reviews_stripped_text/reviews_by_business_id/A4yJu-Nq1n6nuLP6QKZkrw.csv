293636,2014-09-20,0,A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw,"So i went there tonight and after waiting forever in the drive thru, i ordered crunchy chicken tacos and some mashed potatoes. After spending 15+ mins in the drive thru, i was handed a bag and made the mistake of driving away. 

First, i was handed two chicken meals. I decide to pull around and go in because the drive thru line was still long. As im walking in the drive thru girl says ""oh the drive thru lady is here"". i replied ""yeah...this definitely is not what i ordered"" and set the food on the counter. She comes and grabs the bag from me and walks away, no word at all. 

After five additional minutes of waiting with nobody telling me whats going on, i asked for the manager because it had been a ridiculous amount of time to wait. He comes over and tells me that they DONT HAVE ANY CRUNCHY TACOS!! I ask why in the heck i was sold something they didnt have for one, mention the fact that not only did she not apologize, she never told me i would be recieving my order, and nobody had told me anything since. He apologizes and tries to talk me into something else. I told him that was what I had come there for and asked if he was going to make this right. He told me he could offer me a refund and that was it. I said he should be offering me free food and a refund since this was their mistake and i have now wasted a half hour total and he absolutely refuses.

CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT EXIST HERE!!! and I watched them re-serve the bag i brought in. NASTY i could have touched it!!",RYIKVU0CajiNUMIjG9fUrw,0,0,1,QqnTvLS7Yb5T2cIcbYz6Fw

The teenage kid running the register had way too much on his plate and did not know how to handle the fast paced volume of the restaurant. They seemed very understaffed. After 15 mins, I finally got my food. I went to get salsa and the spicy guacamole and cilantro was completely gone. The salsa bar had not been cleaned in a very long time as there were spills all over. I asked the kid to replace the salsa which was never done or cleaned the entire time I ate. The kid needed help however no manager assisted him even though the line was very long. The people in line after me still had not been served by the time I left and several people were served the wrong food. Not sure how the service is any other night but do not go on a Saturday night, the food was good but the service was terrible. Save your money.",3S3u4e_HY0769SSWID4EOw,0,0,1,kGqjmisO5dx9P1A2OuaNEA

1276941,2018-04-22,0,A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw,"If anyone is looking to have great customer service and prompt service, don't go to this location. They have hired kids to run this restaurant. They are in there playing, joking around and not taking their duties seriously. I live around the corner from this one so I go to this one at least once a week. The store hours on google says that they are open until 11pm every night, but I don't think the young adults that work there know that. They literally start shutting down at around 9:30/10. One night around 9:45p I waited 5 minutes (and yes I was watching my clock) before someone came on to say, ""how may I help you"". I was saying ""hello"" into the speaker the entire time. The girl was laughing when she finally cane on. I was actually about to just drive up to the window before they came on. 

Last night 4/22 at 10:20p (looking at my receipt) it took about 3-4 minutes for a young man to come on the speaker and when he did he was laughing. Another time at night also I did indeed have to drive up to the actual window due to no one coming on the speaker, and when i did a young man told me that they've already started cleaning up (yet it was not 11p). From what I can see there are literally no adults (anyone qualified enough to be in charge) that works there. This is just a few of my experiences, but again I go there once a week so I have a lot more. I have literally never gotten quick service or excellent customer service here. It's always subpar, kind of like you ruined the fun they were having. When people are coming to my house and ask ""what do you want me to pick up to eat"" I have stopped saying El Pollo Loco. We as adults complain about Millennials, but yet we allow them to run our businesses without proper training nor do we go and do check-in's on them and see how they are really doing. We allow them to run stores without supervision. So who's fault is it really that these young adults/kids are running a muck at this store? It's sad and unfortunate bcus I work late and this is the only health appt close to my house opened as late as they are, but I refuse to keep getting bad service.",GT_m5_pK2AE8reVAPEdnEA,0,0,2,y1YmpD6Jj_8UpNbBdSMNaw

1508286,2016-03-14,0,A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw,The drive thru service at this location is ridiculous. Took a while till they asked us for our order.. they waited for the person in front of us to get her order before attending us. Even the lady in front complained because they wanted her to wait some more before she got her total for her order and she said she would drive up to the window instead since there was no cars in front of her. Not sure what they are doing inside since the drive thru is not busy at all and it seems that having a drive thru is useless what's the point? maybe they are understaffed or need to redo their training for drive thru customer service! My family comes to this location 3-4 a month and we are going to look for another location or other eatery because they have been doing unsatisfactory service in the drive thru for a while now.

I like that the service is very no nonsense and straight forward, not any of that overly friendly stuff. I mention this because my wife and I have very different views on what good service is. This time we got the 10 piece family meal with 2 sides for 3 dollars more, the two sides we got were black beans & rice. Now if you order from the drive-thru they don't give you the condiments, so we always go in and order to also get things such as salsa, cilantro, etc. The service was fast, the chicken nicely done, and the black beans & rice flavorful.

2868501,2011-10-13,1,A4yJu-Nq1n6nuLP6QKZkrw,"Just came back from El Pollo Loco ...  Love it !

Pros:
 * Juicy chicken
 * Cilantro Cream Sauce is bomb!!
 * huge tostadas
 * quick service

Cons:
 * dirty bathrooms w/ no mirrors
 * their natural ice tea has a weird taste to it
 * they don't carry Choco Tacos anymore (okay that's super old school, but it must have been outrageously good because I remember ha).

Overall:
  I go to El Pollo Loco when I feel like eating out, but attempt to be healthy at the same time.  During this visit I ordered the Chicken Tostada with no sour cream plus a side of the creamy cilantro sauce.  The cilantro sauce is pretty thick in consistency and really doesn't seem to healthy, but I couldn't resist.  It's so hard to resist (that alongside the avocado salsa).  What's up with the tea?  I can't describe the taste, but there was definitely some type of funk to it ?  Egh, nonetheless I'll be back for more.
** 4 Celestial Spheres **

Tips:
 * if you are actually looking to count your calorie intake, the menu lists the caloric value of every item next to it (you might have to squint a bit).
*  Opt for the cilantro dressing... trust me on this one!
* Odelay, El Pollo Loco has a dollar menu! 
* $9.99 Family meal deal special going on right now",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,1,2,4,KLQx8af80wkli4HQYOQoYw

I've now travelled to this location twice for some drive-thru action and both times were very favorable. I actually had some coupon codes to use as I complained about the consistently crap-tastic service and food at the CH location, so I came here for my free food, hoping another EPL location could turn it around for me. This location certainly made me appreciate this particular chain all over again. I`m not gonna lie y'all: I love me some crazy chicken.

Both times the drive thru moved quickly(this was between the hours of 11 a.m. - 1 p.m.), the drive thru employee was friendly and did not give me any grief about using the coupon codes I had, they gave me plenty of napkins, and the food came out of the window quickly. I was SO relieved when I got home to check out my pollo bowl and realized, both times, that the rice was cooked well(unlike the other location which kept giving me underdone, mushy rice), there was plenty of delicious chicken without gross chewy fat pieces(like I had been given at the other location), and the salsa was actually made well. My gripe with the location near my house is that sometimes, whoever is making the salsa, forgets to take out the jalapeno seeds and it ends up being TOO spicy. Like, whoa. I like spicy food, but the amount of spice just ruined the entire bowl on the occasions when they wouldn`t remove the seeds. Rude. So, overall, I am super happy with the two pollo bowls I've gotten here. The tortillas are fine and I usually get horchata, which is also pretty tasty here as well.

It IS fast food, but if I had to choose a chain to be ""bad"" at, I would definitely choose this one, and in particular this location.",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,3,2,3,uYFL8gfi5RECibKSR6M7Pg

The floor was stickier and more gross than that of a movie theatre.  I was handed a cup and then told the ice machine was broken.  They did offer to fill it with ice in the back but it seems to me that should have been done before handing me an empty cup.  They did not have any iced tea or horchata from the looks of it.  And the soda was all coming out with little more than water and a splash of syrup.  It was watered down and extremely flat.  This place has really gone down hill lately.  The one saving grace was that they did, infact, honor the coupon that brought me in there.  I received an accurate order and it was good.

When I drove up, I attempted to place my order and I must have sat there for approximately 2 minutes before I was acknowledged. After I attempted to place my order, the person at the window answered ""we don't have enough of the ingredients to make that dish"". I tried to choose another option and was told again ""we don't have all of the ingredients"". The worst part, was that after I was told that neither of those options were available, he said, ""We are closing soon. You have 1 min and 58 seconds to place your order."" I was beyond appalled and extremely disappointed. Needless to say, I told him to forget my order and drove somewhere else to get my late night dinner. 

I added 1 star because I mentioned this unfortunate experience on Twitter and El Pollo Loco promptly replied, which is a plus in my book. Unfortunately, this experience was beyond unacceptable and first impressions last a very long time.",NYDvprxYyDm1dJj8g_G0RA,4,0,2,1T0GklZmD0yFumVezTmK3w

This location is not the cleanest, especially the bathrooms. But I am willing to overlook that because I know they are super busy and I have never had a bad meal from here.

But when I went for my last visit it was early. I checked their website to see when they opened and it said 9am-11am. I jumped in the car for my mini road trip and when I arrived they were closed. The sign said they opened at 10am. WHAT??? Of course I went crazy in the car, full of sadness and anger. There was no way I could wait over 30 minutes. I just came from the gym and I was starving.

I had to leave and go somewhere I really didn't want to go. This is a simple mistake that should not have happened and they should fix right away. Now  I will have to put them on speed dial and call before I come.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,5,2,3,7pZc-5osqcjWUVtwALgl4g
