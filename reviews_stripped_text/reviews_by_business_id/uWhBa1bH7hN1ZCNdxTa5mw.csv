I've been visiting Las Vegas for a few weeks now for work . This provides an opportunity to sample a whole variety of food. 

This food is the most ""home like "" Indian food, because it's in fact home cooked food. This is most unlike the food you would eat in an Indian restaurant. No Tandoori Chicken or Naan Bread here. This is food from Gujarat , a state in western india. 

This cuisine has just the right blend of sweet and spice. A single plate ""thali"" in Gujarati parlance consists of an appetizer ( samosas or khaman dhoklas ) , daal or kadhi , a couple of vegetables , rotli ( thin soft bread that's distinctly different from the rubbery Naan's you get in Indian restaurants ) , rice , dessert and garlic chutney .

Don't plan to do any work after eating this . It's pure siesta time. 

The only challenge to this is that you need to order a minimum of 2 plates which can be a challenge when you're just by yourself.  They were nice enough to give me 2 distinct meals so I wouldn't have to eat the same food for 2 days. They do offer room delivery for an additional charge.

I shared the thalis with a friend and both of us were completely satisfied at the end of the meal.

Whether you're an expatriate Gujarati or Jain wanting a taste of home while in Vegas or just someone that wants to try Indian food but hate the grease, this is a must try meal.

I'm quite sure I will be visiting them soon to get my fix of Gujarati food.",24Ki2EO6uYJdxuhTGtgB5w,3,3,5,Io4e4C9qDahWREh9F9EruQ

This is my first review on Yelp. I came to Vegas for an office conference and my wife found this place when she did a google search. 

One line review - we absolutely loved the homemade food and service. For more details read on -

We ordered three Thalis as that's the minimum. The owner arrived at the hotel address 30 min before time and waited for me at the hotel lobby. He seemed to be a very respectable man and got a little cart to help get the 'boxed' thalis to the hotel room. He assumed I was Gujarati :) and when I said that I wasn't he said had he known about it he would have got a slightly different mix in the the thalis. But I am a fan of Gujarati food so I wouldn't want it changed.

The food - amazing rotis guys, got to trust me on this - Gujarati dal, home made dhoklas and yummy srikhand - all packed separately. One mixed veg and one dry lentil sabji and some cabbage sabji. Finally, the Thali also had a small packet of  'Mukhwaas' :)

The portions - decent sized portions.

Plan to order more in the coming week!!!",g_WzNIXmfHaaxcT7N9--aw,3,1,5,xOnUkyzDZ_nLNH09JfYvsw

The thali comes with 5 Rotis (awesome), with Dal, Shaak, khaman (my favorite), rice, Shrikhand, salad, chutney and Mukhwas. The food was delicious and wholesome. Also included a bonus gift -- selfie stick!",d48BxEKfl4O2rwdj7RHfRQ,0,0,5,48HlF4uSNtsCdOX2JdDYoQ

This was more than just some food for lunch and reminded me of my mother's food. Absolutely delicious and I could say it was made with a lot of care :)",z7f451NJ4DKGhOSY1OO6kw,1,0,5,RWK0B7xRDhcmZjrrM1kuig

Indian food in USA is synonymous with the typical greasy (and tasty of course!) lunch buffets and ala carte, but thakkar thali is different. It  is simple, home-cooked food which makes you nostalgic for mom cooked food. It comes with one appetizer, two sabzi/curry, one daal/sambar, four small chapati and one small dessert. The preparation is gujrati style, so folks not used to the cuisine will find it sweeter than other Indian cuisines. The portion size was good for me, but it is lesser than typical portion size of main course elsewhere.",f_raNSKjAEjMO4D-zA1kZQ,3,2,5,NLiCCPG0brlcOR9lF4byPA
