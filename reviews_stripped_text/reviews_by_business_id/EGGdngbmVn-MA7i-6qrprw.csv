32427,2008-09-02,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Ok. So this will probably be the longest review I write because I have been here with my boss about 5 times so far.  Let me tell you, every time I have been there, it has been a blessing.

The first time I had gone was when I was a little bit buzzed from Red square in mandalay bay.  I got there and was introduced to one of my bosses friends who is a waiter there.  I guess my experience with the staff there has been very good since I know some of them now.  My first meal was the lobster pot pie.  It is a soufflé that is cooked in an all copper pot...ok...so let me tell you that it is just insanely perfect.  Yes it costs a pretty penny like the copper pot in comes in but the way the sauce is, it just matches the lobster perfectly.  You also get a lot of food and actual lobster inside of the dish.  Everything is cooked well and nothing is too crunchy or too soft.

My other meals were tenderloins, some fish, all worth noting but here is my best meal of my life.  The appetizers started out with a seafood sampler with oysters, dungeness crab,  shrimp, and lobster claws.  Then there is the kobe beef tartare...american style but the chips and sauce that it comes with...youll want to eat this yourself.  Then I had seared foie gras over sea scallops which was just so intense my mouth was going to burst.  All the while I was drinking a bottle of chambolle-musigny.  Then the main course came....You know how Harold and Kumar felt when they finally got white castle?  Yea..similar feelings.  I had kobe beef.   Yea..it was wagyu...and I cried.  You will never ever have a better piece of meat in your life.  I had 8 ounces of perfectly cut, medium rare, wholesome goodness.  They were just perfectly seared all around and just left juicy red in the middle.  All bundled with 4 different types of mashed potatoes...  
For dessert, they brought out some special chocolates, and homemade icecream.  By that time I had become delirious from the goodness of the kobe so I cant remember what it was exactly called.  Ice wine is always welcome too at the end of a great meal.

So if you go, be prepared to shell out a lot of dough.  If you had a bad experience with the staff..Im sorry since I have had such good luck here.  If you go, please contact Patrick and he will take good care of you.",_nQxEhtkMeNyutmwmrCpzw,1,0,5,ug6p2IbYkf0RAGiVYoJ6nQ

We ordered the tasting menu. The app that first arrived was so good! The mini-lobster pot pie was my favorite favorite dish of all! Then came the duck.... ehh, compared to everything else, not so much. The steak (and I am not a big meat eater) was really good but I was too full to finish it by then. The wine was great, dessert was great.

When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess staff who were friendly enough. 

Our server, a Buddy Holly look alike, was very friendly and professional. When we ordered our dinner, he made great recommendations but was not pushy. While waiting for food, they brought an assortment of bread. I can't remember two off the three but the cheddar biscuit was amazing!!! I tried not to eat too much bread because I wanted to save room for meal but I did have a bit of everything and loved them all.

Once our food arrived, we were all in heaven. None of us could change anything about the meal, it was perfect. I had the BBQ pork bites and truffled mac and cheese. Each was amazing but I would highly recommend the mac and cheese. 

I wish I would've had room for dessert because everything on the dessert menu looked amazing.

79695,2010-07-20,1,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"3 stars somehow feels very different to me than A-OK. So I'll begin by clarifying that in my mind 3 stars is more like: ""leaves something to be desired"". I see why it is less catchy than A-OK, but 2 stars feels much too harsh to me. 

So can we compromise on describing Nobhill Tavern as being B-OK?

Maybe its because I came from San Francisco, Nobhill tavern, I felt, doesn't do justice to Nobhill. I mean it's fine. The food is fine but doesn't match up with its price and the same goes for the service. It's fine. 

We ordered the halibut, the ribs, the shrimp appetizer, and brussles sprouts and cream spinach as sides and a half bottle of a Beale petite syrah.

We stumbled upon this place when searching for a quick drink before a show. We were pleasantly surprised! We walked in and sat at the bar around 5:30pm. First order of business was half a dozen oysters. Then my guest ordered a ""Cable Car"" and I had a lovely house creation called ""Grey Matter"". 

The Cable Car was pure bliss. The sugar was heated to perfection on the rim and it was served cold and frothy. VERY easy to drink and it took me back to the days of orange cream-sicles.
 
The Grey Matter was amazing. The house infuses black tea with Nolet's Dry Gin... If you like black tea, the martini is heaven in a glass. It was a quite a contrast to the Cable Car.

The oysters were plump and fresh. The house mignonette was sweet and tangy. They were the perfect treat before the show. I would definitely order these again and highly recommend them. 

The real highlight of the night was the service. The gentleman behind the bar, Michael, took the time to explain the specialty cocktails to us, made recommendations and was very personable. He is a true artist and you can taste that is every sip. I can't wait to go back. Maybe next time we will order more than just drinks and oysters.

DO: Order a specialty cocktail, not a rum and coke.
DO  NOT: Come here in a rush, enjoy your drink.",D3H5vWylA7bHOEBbyTkIGA,4,1,5,cxDTGNlQZVIlTCSelXKaAA

first course was a spring pea soup with creme fraiche. The taste was subtle, but the freshness was very apparent. The creme fraiche was unlike others I've had - very solid - perhaps over refrigerated.

Main course of short ribs were braised to a savory softness. I loved potted meats.

I asked the server to pick her favorite dessert and got the goat cheese cheesecake. Great choice.

148452,2010-02-15,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"What can I say. Disappointed!! Very disappointed. Especially after reading the Yelp reviews. I did a lot of research on where to eat in Las Vegas. I did not want to pay the $200.00 plus price tag of some of the top top rated places, but, I am a foodie and wanted a memorable meal. 
First, my partner and I had a reservation, and were seated at an extremely large 4-6 top table (I usually appreciate a big table) however, this was completely impersonal. By the way we were eating at 6:30 p.m. so it was not crowded. We asked for another table and were seated at a banquette. The server arrived, but acted as if he was not expecting company. 
The best experience was with the sommelier, whose name unfortunately I cannot remember. He gave great recommendations for glasses of wine and even brought tastes for my partner. He was very friendly and nice to talk to(more later).
My partner ordered the kobe beef burger and I ordered the San Francisco Cioppino (imagining that this would be stellar given Michael Mina's roots).  The burger was terrific, the fries however, were over salted(I am a salt lover, so really too much) and frankly pretty ordinary. 
Now to my Cioppino, first, it was obvious from the first bite that the fish and shellfish were pre-cooked, no, really. I could not believe it, also, the temperature of the whole dish was off. The ""broth"" which is actually more like a tomato saucea was not hot enough, too thick and just bland and ordinary tasting. The combination of the pre-cooked fish and shellfish was really not good. I only ate the lobster tail and the scallop(also not cooked correctly). The sommelier came by towards the end of the meal and asked how everything was (the server never returned to ask). I asked him if he really wanted to know and I told him about the above. I saw him tell the server, who never asked us and just brought us a trio of sorbets (the chocolate was yummy but the peach and mango tasted like Sharon's.) 
Overall, I would never recommend this restaurant or eat here again. I was glad to take the complimentary copy of WIne Spectator with Michael Mina on the cover, but would be reticent to try his restaurants again.",5XgJlgZUc1rORlO0uFjZiA,0,0,2,rKCR1F-BcnZgMpvMlDeYkA
188975,2010-06-24,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Beware of the lauded lobster pot pie - it was highly recommended by other yelp users, but the price was notably absent from the reviews. While the average entree price was around $39, the market price of the lobster that day was $89. I was on a business trip and had the pot pie and a beer - my bill? $127. That was tough to explain on the expense report.

The pot pie was good, but not $90 good. It was also a full lobster - so try sharing it.

But Nobhill didn't lose stars because of the price, they lost it because the bartender never told me the price, never mentioned it was better for sharing, and gave some of the most horrendous service I've ever had.

We stumbled upon this amazing gem at the MGM almost 6 years ago trying to decide on a place to have a nice sit down early dinner.  So we opened up the MGM dining book and saw the most delicious photo of Seafood Cioppino.  Now, visiting from San Francisco - I knew that I had to try this dish!

The restaurant menu is very small but everything is very good!  The Seafood Cioppino was and is still one of my favorite dishes.  They sometimes have specials and I highly recommend you to order whatever it is because almost every time we've dined here, it's never been disappointing.  Believe me, we eat here a lot!!

Another item  to consider is the Lobster pot pie.. It gets brought out to you literally in a copper pot and served to you at the table! YUMMO!  It's really big too, enough to share for two!  

For Appetizer, go for the deluxe tier!  Comes with Filet Beef cubes, coconut shrimp and crab/artichoke dip.

You must order the chocolate souffle for dessert.  Place your order at the beginning of dinner so by the time you are finish, so will your dessert!

A Big Plus on this place, they'll let you take your bottle of wine/champagne with you if you didn't finish over dinner WITHOUT any weird looks or judgment like other places!

I was there for a dinner with a vendor and since we were a party of 16, we had a prefixed menu.  I am giving 3 stars because I wasn't impressed with the NY Strip that I received.  I am always upset when a steak never comes out the way you asked for it to be cooked - why ask for a tempreature then?  I asked for Med-Rare and got Medium but I ate it.  But worse than the temperature was the over-usage of salt.  This steak was over salted which took away from the natural flavors.  The appetizer of New England Crab & Lobster Rolls were good but they were so small that it was more of 2 bites than 2 rolls.  As for the desert - it certainely wasn't what I ordered but since everyone got the same thing, I figured, they ran out of the other option.  But it wasn't anything that one couldn't make at home (bananas, ice cream, chopped nuts and chocolate syrup).  

The decor was very nice and the service by the staff was exceptional.  Again, since it was a prefixed menu - I am not sure of the cost but it did seem pricey and based off of my meal, not sure it was worth the price.

We approached the hostess and were able to get a table within about 10 minutes of arriving on a Saturday night. The cocktail menu had some nice creations on there if you are the mixology sort. We were seated in a glass enclosed booth with its own address written on the door which I thought was very unique and added to the ""cool factor"" of the restaurant. The waiter we had was very quick and to the point when waiting on us which is the style I prefer. I had a very nice medium-rare pork chop for dinner with a side helping of farro which was very well seasoned. The shared side that sticked out to me was the truffle mac & cheese. It was very savory and just the right amount of cheesy.  If you are in the MGM area and want a very solid nice dinner without venturing into the 80+ per person range I recommend this establishment.

249087,2010-01-01,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"This is the first time at Nob Hill Tavern for us; however, it is the 4th Michael Mina restuarant that I have been too.  Unfortunately, it was the worst and we will never go back.  

We were staying at the MGM and had tickets to KA that night so we wanted to eat somewhere close to the show so that we did not have to rush through dinner.  Our reservations were at 7 pm and the show was at 9:30 pm and the theater was right around the corner, less than a 5 minute walk, but the service was so horrendous that we did not even have time for dessert and were still rushing to get to the show right at 9:30.

It was a Tuesday night during non peak season and were unlucky enough to be the guinea pigs for a new waiter ... it was his first night on the floor alone.  Don't get me wrong ... we understand everyone gets nervous and may make mistakes their first night out, but this waiter kept making mistakes all night:

1)  First, it took him about 15 minutes to even take our orders.  When he finally did, I had asked him about a certain appetizer and he said that he had not tasted that dish yet, but he would find out and get back to me.  Well, he never came back to tell me so I ended up with no appetizer.

2)  My husband ordered the Tasting Menu with the wine pairing.  His first course came out and was eaten and we realized that there was no wine pairing that came with it.  Had to ask the waiter about it and then we got it, but so much for the ""pairing"" since the course was already eaten.

3)  Our friend had ordered the filet and had asked for the Sweet Onion sauce to come on the side, well, another mistake .. the filet came with the sauce on top of it.  We could not wait for another steak to come since we did not get our entrees until 8:30 pm (remember, we had tickets to KA for the 9:30 showing, which we mentioned to both the manager and the waiter when we sat down).

4)  There were 4 of us, two couples, so to make the billing issue easier, we had asked the waiter for separate bills when we first ordered.  He said ""no problem sir"" .. but when the bill came, it was not separated.  We asked again and when the waiter brought back the separated bill, yes, it was separated, but there were no prices ... it would have been nice if this meant that our entire dinner was comped, but of course it wasn't.  

With all of the problems that we experienced ... new waiter or not ... I would think that at a Michael Mina restaurant, the manager would come over to apologize, but that did not even happen.  Very disapointing since our dinner for 4 cost us $600+ (and that did not even include dessert since we did not have time to even order any).

The food was tasty, but not mind-blowing enough to get the bad taste of such horrible service out of our mouths.    

Sorry Mr Mina .. but your wait staff need quite a bit more training  before sending them out on their own.  And maybe your restuarant managers need some additional training also?",ds9fZuQZIYFkOb3wsQKEuA,0,0,1,WYkKnOnj0pp3vxaxErpyMQ

Knowing Mina's reputation I felt this restaurant would be a real treat and must say I was severely disappointed.....disappointed enough to sign up for yelp specifically to write this review.

The good points (earning this the one star instead of -2).  Nice fresh-out-of-the-oven-bread served.  Waiter was pleasant and tried to help us with our complaints later.  End of good points.

The food was overpriced and deplorable.  I had the monkfish for $38.  The portion of fish on my plate could not have been more than 3 ounces which was mostly bone.  I managed to scrape a small amount of fish off the bone which was slightly overcooked and very bland.  There was what may have amounted to a tablespoon of some type of mushroom scattered around the plate and a small cast iron pan of pinto beans on the side which tasted like the worst canned beans I've ever had and ""spiced up"" with what could only have been a half cup of salt.

My sister had the $35 salmon, which was of smaller than average size and according to her tasted ""OK, but nothing special"".  This was the third time she had had a salmon dish on our trip (twice in SF) and was the worst of the three and at least $10 more expensive.

My brother-in-law had the only fairly priced and edible dish of the three of us.  A $20 Kobe beef burger with enough fries to fill up both my sister's and my still growling stomachs.  I had steered away from the burger for ""something special"", sadly this was probably the best thing on the menu.

When we told our waiter of our dissatisfaction, he went to the managers to see if he could do something (again, he was the only highlight of the evening besides the bread).;  The managers took one look at us and figured we weren't Vegas regulars and decided immediately not to do anything to make us feel a little less taken advantage of......this is the modus operandi of the restaurant.  They know they have an unlimited supply of first-time rubes to come in and get fleeced once...they do not need to rely on repeat customers.  If this restaurant were located in San Francisco it wouldn't last 2 months....but in Vegas it is able to feed unsuspecting tourists crappy food based on the name of a well known chef for years on end...

If Michael Mina reads this I would suggest he investigate the restaurant that he seems to have lost control of, his SF restaurants are excellent and this place can only serve to destroy his reputation.  I would hope that he is not implicit in this ruse and simply view this as a cash cow instead of worrying about his reputation.  I have had many meals at many restaurants around the US and Europe.  I have no problem paying good money for good food, but I felt like this place was simply set up to fleece unsuspecting tourists.  I would stay far away from this place, and if you happen to find yourself there right now...do yourself a favor and forget the ""something special"" on the menu and go for the $20 burger...you'll be the only one not feeling completely ripped off and your dinner mates can at least sustain themselves from your enormous portion of fries...",qXwFJK9KMUkhwaBlRzw7IA,0,0,1,6YiFwAPic4GX4lf66rin-w

We made this our ""fancy night"" because we knew the bill would not be cheap. Well... I guess nothing on the strip is going to be cheap other than the fast food. Anyways, we love Michael Mina so we thought we'd give it a go.

This is in the heart of the MGM Grand, so unless you go to this place frequently you won't find by just find it by walking down the the strip. The outside is nice, so we decide to eat here for our Friday night out. We made a reservation before hand, but there was plenty of seating, so we didn't need to. The inside is nice and the music is casual.

We sit down and order drinks. After that we look at the menus. We decided to order small plates because that is what is he is known for. For seafood, we order the crab, oysters, and lobster rolls. We also order a salad, Korean chicken wings, pulled pork sandwiches, French fries, and for desert those donut things.

The food came very fast so if you're trying to catch a show (in which we were going to Ka, which was just an okay show) this is a good place to go. The salad and bread came first. Just an ordinary salad. Just ordinary bread. Everything else came out after that because we only ordered appetizers.

I went right to the lobster rolls because I heard they were to die for. They were. It's lobster meat on a soft roll. Best lobster I ever had. I try a pulled pork sandwich. I didn't mention that the serving are very small so if you are getting small plates get a lot. The sandwiches are about as big as a large coin. They were not bad.

The chicken wings I thought were very good. The skin was crispy and a had a good amount of kick to them. Defiantly think about getting those. The French fries I would say were good. Not much else to say about them. 

I didn't try it, but my cousin said the oysters were very good. I did try the crab. You get five crab leg pieces. You don't need to give any effort to get the meat out of the shell, it comes right out. It was very tender and fresh. Good plate.

For desert we got those donut things. I don't know what they're called, but they were very good. With it came a small portion of salted carmal ice cream with melted carmal poured around it. The desert I'd give a thumbs up.

This was a great place to go to on a night out. Great service. Great food. There's not much else to say about this restaurant. So far, this is the place I would recommend most to those who are traveling to Vegas.",hQRMvn7CVlss8Ao9fWUneg,0,0,4,tIPQfTBFcHkkrfE3gsxV-g

All of it was DELICIOUS!  My husband ordered the shrimp louie salad and pork chop (which came with an arugula side with beans).  YUM!!!

The service was excellent as well as their signature cocktail, the cablecar - HIGHLY recommend it!

420670,2009-08-24,1,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"One Sentence Review:  Uniquely terrible service, average food.

So, here is the story:

I had reservations for 6 at 8:00 on a Saturday night.  I walked up to the hostess with my date.  She ignored us.  It was as if we were in the wrong place, so I walked up to the door, just in case there was a second host station.  There wasn't.  I walked back to the the host station and, after introducing myself to the hostess (she never did welcome us), I was informed that two other members of our party were at the bar.  Cold.  Really cold. 

We wait at the bar for a while and then start asking to be seated.  We had to ask four different people within the course of 30 minutes before anyone seated us.  The table we ultimately were seated in had been empty the entire time.  No explanation, let alone apology, for the delay.

We sit down.  Two members of our party had to leave at 10:00 for a show.  We informed the server.  He said no problem.  

At about 9:30, yes 1.5 hours after our reservation time, the appetizers arrive.  By the time entrees arrive the two of us who had a show to go to were on the way out the door.  They never did get more than a bite or two.  We noticed a manager-type speaking to them on their way out and handing them an envelope, and so assumed they were taken care of and continued with out now excruciatingly long meal. (note:  having done the tour at Alinea, the longer tasting menu at per se, 20 courses at Moto, etc., long meals are just fine by me.  But, averaging less than a course an hour is just ridiculous)  

The rest of our entrees arrive, along with the deserts for the two of us that had to depart (clearly no communication between servers and kitchen).  I don't have a fork, but that is just the same as my pork chop is so raw that it would be unsafe to eat.  Not that I could have eaten it because the chop was surrounded by uncooked fat which no human could chew sufficiently to consume.  I excuse myself to the restroom and spit out the nastiness, return to the table, and eat the entrees left behind by our recently departed guests.

I will save you the details of additional disasters (drinks that were mis-made, chairs so short that I looked like a child in need of a booster seat, laughably large candles at the table that prevented cross-table conversation, food coming out in the wrong order)

This was, by far, the work dining experience I have ever had.  But the real kicker occurred the next morning when we realized that, instead of taking care of the two folks who, because of their service, were able to eat only their appetizers, the manager had given them a coupon to return for a free desert!  Seriously, a free desert!  

Nothing we ate (5 different small plates, five different appetizers, five different entrees, and two deserts) was any better than the food at one of Vegas' buffets.  In fact, all I can remember are the things that went horribly wrong.

The wait staff contrasts the look with off-white shirts and vests. 

My date and I were immediately sat for our 7:30pm reservation. We were sat and instantly greeted at the table by last name. 
I ordered a bottle of Stag's Leap Petite Syrah and the charcutierie plate which consisted of salami, prosciutto, speck, pate, gherkins, mustard and buttery toasted brioche. The bread basket had black pepper biscuits, grilled foccacia and toasted ciabatta bread. They too went well with the charcutierie plate. 
For entrees my lady had the prime rib, with a side of whipped horseradish potatoes. I had the Kurobuta pork chop with toasted farro, and braised Swiss chard with BACON! 

The prime rib was cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with whipped horseradish creme fraiche. It was a simple dish, cooked to perfection. My pork chop was awesome. Moist, well seasoned and crisp on out side. 
For dessert I took one for the team and ordered the chocolate mousse cake (Anyone who knows me, knows I HATE chocolate with a passion). The cake was served with Strawberry sorbet and adorned with strawberries, micro arugula and balsamic syrup. An awesome chocolate dessert.

528127,2011-09-06,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"So it was a little ironic that I traveled to Las Vegas to go to the San Francisco-style Nob Hill Tavern by Michael Mina, but I have no regrets! It was actually one of the best meals of my life. I ate at Michael Mina in San Francisco years ago and it was a really nice, expensive 11-course meal. Nob Hill Tavern is definitely more casual and little bit lighter on the wallet.

We were celebrating my best friend Anne's belated birthday and I requested a special table. The first few tables in the restaurant are a little bit more private and can fit 2-4 people in a booth. There's a larger common room in the back. I was really impressed with the intimate feel of the booth (I felt like I was on a fancy date with Anne) and the great service!

Started the meal with raw oysters and they were some of the best oysters I've ever had. Even though they were smaller, the oysters were still plump, juicy and creamy. The waiter told us that the oysters came from British Columbia, but I can't remember the name. Anne had the chilled cucumber gazpacho soup with dungeness crab and a little bit of lemon oil. The soup was light and refreshing and a great palate cleanser. I had to order the seared foie gras (I can never pass it up when I see it on the menu) and it was served with large pieces of toast and mango chutney. The foie gras was cooked perfectly with a buttery texture and rich taste. I actually wasn't a big fan of the toast and the chutney. I thought the bread was too thick and a little too overwhelming for the foie gras. I actually cut the bread in half so that I could enjoy the combination better. While the chutney wasn't bad, I'm a traditionalist when it comes to foie gras brulee. I like it more when it comes with poached pears or apples. I still managed to eat everything on my plate though.

For our main courses, I ordered the day boat scallops served on top of a bed of braised radicchio and topped with grapes and toasted almonds. I was immediately impressed by how thick the scallops were. Those succulent morsels melted in my mouth and I found myself cutting the scallops in smaller and smaller bites so I could extend the eating experience. The radicchio was almost caramelized, but the sweetness was also balanced out with a slight bitterness. We ordered the truffle mac and cheese and I almost felt like it wasn't cheesy enough. I wouldn't order that again.

My favorite part of the meal was actually Anne's dish, chicken breast served with pole beans, lemon chickpea fritters, shallot marmalade, swimming in chicken jus. This was the best chicken dish I have ever had in my life. The chicken was incredibly tender and moist, and the skin was crispy. It was out of this world. I asked the waiter how they cooked it and he explained that they first sear the chicken, sous-vide* it, and finally crisp up the skin (*sous-vide is when you cook the food in a plastic bag in a water bed). If you go to Nob Hill Tavern, you must order the chicken!

Our waiter was super nice and I ordered a Grand Marnier souffle when Anne left the table. We surprised her with a candle and a sign, and it was delicious! The souffle was light and fluffy (almost like a cloud), but I wish it came with some sauce (creme anglaise would have been killer).

Overall, I was super happy with our meal at Nob Hill Tavern and I would totally recommend it! Totally appreciated the excellent service, nicer table and special birthday dessert.

My entree was the special pork chop served over white cheddar grits and a jamon sauce with cabbage.  By far the best food I've had in a loooonngg time.  My friend got the scallops and although they were good, they did not compare to my dish.  For desert we ordered the raspberry creme brulee after making sure it wasn't just creme brulee with raspberries on top.  Sure enough, the raspberries are baked right in.  Very yummy.

845652,2008-05-20,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"What a great experience (twice)!  We went for supper on a busy night and ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  It was a perfect dining affair: Each dish was presented beautifully and tasted even better, the wine was gorgeous and the service was flawless.  Yes, the chef's tasting menu is bit pricier than ordering a standard three-course meal a la carte, but when you factor in the cost of the lobster pot pie alone, it actually comes out to a great deal.

This dish is one of Michael Mina's signatures and now I see what all the hype is about.  It's deconstructed, so it's cooked in a pot, and placed on your dish directly from that pot, with all the parts (crust, vegetables, perfectly cooked lobster).  Don't expect a bunch of creamy filling like something from the freezer section of your local grocery.  It's a pot pie EVOLUTIONIZED.  I am not usually a big lobster fan, but I would order this again, on it's own, any day.  I won't go into detail on the other dishes, but they too were amazing.

After a few pre-dinner drinks at the bar and all the wine pairing, I was pretty looped by the time we got to dessert.  So excited was I about the Hungarian Tokaji that was our dessert pairing that I knocked it over after just two sips.  The server, knowing how much I had looked forward to that moment was kind enough to pour me another glass, even fuller than the first one.  Another memo on the service: So many restaurants think that the definition of good service is only to be pleasant and knowledgeable (which are important), but I also believe that an integral part of an extraordinary meal is attentiveness.  The wait staff had everything timed succinctly, from serving and taking away dishes, to making sure they didn't come over too early or ask questions while we had food in our mouths.  And yes, my water glass was also replenished before it was gone.

*Note: If you can get a booth instead of a table in the dining room, go for it.  It's cozy, comfortable and great for people watching.

The second night we were having supper somewhere else, but stopped in for drinks before hand (let's face it, cocktails at the casino bars are just boring).  The hostess, bartender and waiter all remembered us from the night before.  We started off ordering some of the specialty drinks from their drinks menu, then the bartender/drink master started making custom concoctions for us and we ended for staying for 2 hours and just barely made it to our dinner reservations.  *Disclosure: One would have to assume that when your bar bill is a few C-notes, the drinks and the service better be good.

(He said they do buy their steaks from the same butcher just they do not age them).   

The waiter recommended the lobster pot pie, the sturgeon and the pork belly.     Majority of the group ordered the lobster pot pie, the hamburger and the Colorado lamb...so I decided to try the pork belly.   While the pork belly was good, I really preferred the lobster pot pie and the lamb that my friends shared with me.   Next time I go back, I will definitely go w/ the 2lb. lobster pot pie (even if it costs $85).   

The best part of the meal for me were the appetizers.   We ordered quite a few different appetizers and side dishes.   Their break basket was very good, cured meats were tasty,  lobster rolls were excellent and the beer battered shrimp were gone so fast I couldn't get any :)  My friends said they were really good.   The truffled fries and truffled mac and cheese both are great.    Wilted spinach had lots of garlic which I like, but it was nothing amazing.   Best part of the meal for me was the fondue pot w/ a cream of tomato soup that you dunk mini grilled cheese cubes into... it was phenomenal.",dRAMzraeziw6S6vonDMqFw,0,0,4,yyRoskRpGfXHQ6ggvtoqng

I'm not sure what the big deal is about this cablecar cocktail. Its definitely not a big deal. The bartender then made me this Cucumber cocktail which is not on their menu anymore and it was pretty damn refreshing, more of a spring or summer cocktail. Then I got a mojito but the bartender suggested I get it made with Ginger beer rather than soda water. what a difference that makes. 

Overall, the cablecar cocktail is nothing special. I would rather go to The Henry at the Cosmopolitan or even Fiamma at the MGM because I feel like they have better cocktails. Although not fancy, my go to drink you can get anywhere is Goose and Grapefruit juice.

We had skipped dinner to make the show on time and were looking forward to a substantial meal and some alcoholic drinks to get us ready for the rest of our night of partying. 

We walked in and were seated immediately and told that we could now only order from the late menu, which consists of bar type food only. Not exactly what we were looking for but it was late and beggars can't be choosers right? 

The menu was rather small, but we were able to find things that appealed to us. We ordered the beer battered shrimp,grilled veggie flat bread, frites with truffle aoili and the BBQ pork spare ribs. ( Did I mention we were starving?) 

The food was so over salted that it was almost inedible. I was left with the impression that you had to be really drunk to enjoy such over salted food. I had one bite of the shrimp and almost spat it back out. The flat bread was bland and mushy. And the pork ribs were salty,salty,salty and yet somehow devoid of flavor. All I could taste was sodium. The only thing I had more than one bite of were the frites, which were crispy and ok. 

To add insult to injury, our waiter was rude and inattentive and at one point came over and slammed our bottle of Perrier on the table. I guess he got tired of topping of our water and wanted us to do it for ourselves?

The most recent visits were a group dinner in december ( a freebie ) and then last night the roomie and i tried the winter tasting menu ( $59/person, 3 courses - app.,main, dessert add $31 for the wine pairng.) 

If not for last nights visit i would give Nob Hill 4-5 stars but the service was soooooo slow, the food luke warm ( presumably due to the slow service ) and the managers solution for the debacle ( can i offer a free glass of dessert wine ? yeah, right, thanks but no thanks. how about a free dessert on your next visit ? ok, but i doubt i'll return ) 

Roomie went with the scallop fritter, the cioppino and the apple cobbler. I tried the sunchoke soup w/ pork belly, the short rib and the citrus tasting ( lemoncurd ice cream, orange souffle and grand marinier gelee .) 

the highlights : the cioppino, the short rib. 
the average : everything else. The fritter was room temperature which did affect the texture, the soup - the pork belly taste was overpowering, the cobbler - boring, the citrus tasting was missing the gelee. 

the pre-meal cocktail - i order some sort of cherry dealio but they were out of bing cherries - not a biggie except it took them 5 minutes to tell me this - why ? 

the bread basket - ok .

There was no one else there to seat so that comment from the hostess was just bizarre and laughable unless they were going for the ""let's create the image we are in high demand"" angle.

The service was pretty attentive at first but then it took a severe turn for the worse after appetizers. There were plenty of people who worked there around to provide service but we sat there for what seemed eternity before we could grab someone's attention to check on us and service our table, including clearing plates and also having to remind them about drink orders already placed that had failed to appear for some time.

Our group was from San Francisco and there were comments that this is sort of like a San Fran-for-non-SFers kind of a place, i.e. California comfort food with an emphasis on ingredients but not particularly trendy or adventurous. I actually liked that, but it depends what you're looking for.

The truffled mac and cheese is one of those things that always sounds better than it actually is unless it's really really amazing, which it wasn't, but it was still fine.

If you like cocktails, order one, because they were very well made. Praline sundae for dessert also surprised us with how irresistible it was, despite how full we were.

Variation after variation, experimentation upon experimentation. Pushing the boundaries of taste and sensation.

But sometimes you only have 45 minutes to cut to the chase, knock it out and hit the road.

That was the case with Nobhill Tavern.

After consecutive 3 hour tastings at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (http://www.yelp.com/biz/latelier-de-joel-robuchon-las-vegas-2#hrid:hhI-P-rlC0nh3ePOvUsoNA) and Fleur de Lys (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fleur-de-lys-las-vegas#hrid:ssAizDirPAyAkLFt-cFexg) over the past two nights, I had 45 minutes for a final meal in Vegas. It was either that or stop on the drive home at Baker or Barstow and their fine dining options are limited. And by limited I mean non-existent. There was no way I was ending my Vegas eating adventure with drive-thru.

And then Nobhill beckoned. Inviting, warm, familiar. And with the promise of quick and easy satisfaction.

Who was I to say no?

Walking through her doors, I was welcomed by a comfortable and warmly lit space. On the right are semi-private booths, separated by glass and curtains. On the left, a long narrow wooden bar with padded leather stools, rows of bottles and glasses lining backlit bookcases behind it. Explore further and the space opens into a larger dining room at the rear of the restaurant. I chose the private booth for our brief liaison, something I would highly recommend. Decorated in warm shades of brown and tan, leather, suede and wood, Nobhill Tavern feels at once neighborhoody and familiar. Kinda like Cheers for foodies.

The food here is Michael Mina's take on modern American tavern fare. It serves as a counterpoint to Mina's other Las Vegas restaurants: Michael Mina (the Vegas outpost of his signature San Francisco restaurant), Stripsteak (steak) and Seablue (seafood).

Being on a tight schedule, I skipped the foreplay of appetizers and cut right to the main course. Braised short ribs with whipped potatoes, a Worchestershire sauce and glazed mirepoix. The short ribs were deliciously tender, moist and flavorful. For a simple dish, one of the best executions of braised short ribs in recent memory. The mashed potatoes were creamy and silky smooth, forming a perfect pillow under the generous square of short rib and soaking up the sauce as it flowed off the meat. The glazed vegetables and greens were good too but I was here for a different kind of satisfaction. And this dish did not disappoint.

My dining partner ordered the American Kobe burger, ""secret sauce"" and balsamic onions, with a side of fries. As good as my short ribs were, I have to say this was one of the best Kobe burgers I have ever had. Nothing too fancy in its construction, basically just patty, lightly toasted sesame seed bun, with some caramelized onions, tomato and ""secret sauce"" (i.e. some form of mayo), it was the quality of the patty that really made the burger. Again, moist, dripping with flavor, and well seasoned. The fries were also excellent. Thin cut and double, maybe triple, fried for crispiness. We actually took the remainder of the fries with us for the road.

I would have stayed for a drink but couldn't linger. Payment was made for services very well rendered and a generous tip for extras.

I hit the road feeling both satiated and excited to come back for a longer session next time I'm in Vegas. In the meantime, I've already made a booking for XIV back in LA.

BBQ Pulled Pork Finger Sandwiches - delicious. Coming from one of the top BBQ states, I can firmly state that these are some yummy Q! Tender pork, just-sweet-enough sauce... Definitely a keeper!

Grilled Quail - also delicious. ""Don't be delicate, pick it up with your fingers and eat it off of the bone"" our server said. Yes. Do. slurp every little tender bit of meat off of that tiny yard bird. Then wish you had another one, it's that good.

Truffled Mac and Cheese - YES. Now THAT is what a mac and cheese should be. Perfectly al dente corkscrew pasta, light yet creamy cheese sauce, and the perfect amount of truffling. So good I wanted to smack everyone who makes half-assed mac-n-cheese.

Grilled Summer Vegetables - the only fail of the night. Mushy, nothing to really write home about - I wish the server had steered us away from these.

Then I ordered some decaf coffee, and they brought me my own french press!  Nice touch.

My boyfriend ordered the oysters and then Braised Short Rib.  The short rib was so tender that you could cut into it with your fork.  Delicious!  He thought the oysters were good, but not the best that he's ever had. He also ordered the bread pudding for dessert.

I had the $26 Alaskan halibut with eggplant and ratatouille because halibut sounded healthier than scallops wrapped in bacon (although it sounded so so so good I almost cried)...  I expected the halibut to be dry and gross, but healthy, which is why I didn't even bother asking the waiter, but what.  Michael Mina is awesome?  Why yes he is because everything is good here.

I tried some of my friend's mac & cheese - wow, when I was 3 years old I had NO IDEA what I was in for in the future...  Adults have it good!  FREE bread is always good because it's FREE, but this FREE bread was some darn classy FREE bread.  haha.  Love the all caps FREE?  My mom taught me well. 

This sourdough bread was warm and grilled, complete with the grill marks to prove that each piece was individually grilled.  Wow.  No doubt, we had no problem asking for another helping of greasy carby goodness.

And out came my halibut: I was SURPRISED.  This has got to be one of the best slabs of fish I have ever had in my entire life.  Life altering.  Time stopping.  Amazing.  It was a little crisp on the outside but so mouthwatering moist on the inside.  The fish was perched on a slab of delicious eggplant, and the waiter brought out a little iron bowl of ratatouille, and scooped out a bit on top of the fish.

1534966,2009-03-13,2,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"How could I forget to review this place? How can you forget a Lobster Pot Pie that has a whole Maine Lobster? Let's see if we can make this up. 

The Maine Lobster Pot Pie comes out in the All-Clad pot it was baked in topped with a flaky pastry crust. It is then plated table-side by the waiter. He removes the pastry crust from the pot, cuts a perfect circle out, and places it in the center of the plain white dish. He then carefully reconstructs the whole lobster piece by piece minus the head, but with the claw meat which is already shelled. He then adorns the succulent shellfish with pearl onions, baby carrots, parsnips, and potatoes from the pot. It's then finished off with the brandied cream which I dare to say had a hint of truffle. 

How's that for memory? I had that dish about a month ago when all the boys went to Vegas to watch Georges St. Pierre treat BJ Penn like a rag-doll. But I digress. Getting back to the lobster... if memory serves me right, it was @#%in' delicious. I have perpetual ""Entree Envy"" Syndrome, and for once I can confidently say everyone else had Entree Envy. 

As for everything else the Colorado Lamb has good, but the Rib-eye was almost forgettable. For a high grade dry-aged cut, it didn't live up to its hype. One of the other guys also had the Sucking Pig which was good. We also have a few appetizers, but again I can't remember much about it. 

Although it's not best to write a review about a restaurant a month and a half after you dine, it does really tell you how memorable it was. A place like Nobhill or any Michael Mina restaurant is more than a meal, it's an experience. And hopefully a memorable one at that. When you look into you memory, you generally remember what was really bad or really good. 

To sum up Nobhill, nothing was bad, most of it was above average, but the Maine Lobster Pot Pie was damn memorable... in a really good way.

Grilled Quail (Caraway and Black Pepper Rub, Lemon Puree, Arugula and Radish -$20): The quail itself was light, tender and perfectly accented with a hint of acidity from the lemon puree and minor spice notes from the caraway and black pepper rub.  Initially, we were just going to drink, but this dish convinced us otherwise.

Wood Grilled Sausages ($13): There are quite a few different types of meat present in this dish (I believe both bison and rabbit were included), and each of the spicy sausage slices is drained in a delectably heavy white cream sauce.  

Scottish Salmon Tartare (Beet, Horseradish, Pita - $18): Scotch egg covered tartare served with thin slices of slightly warm pita.  Use the beets and horseradish to make yourself delicious tartare sandwiches.  

Salmon Creek Pork Belly (Duck Fat Potatoes, Truffle Puree Frisee and Apple Salad -$35): The belly has nice tenderness and was not overdone (as it is at most restaurants that place it on the menu).  Still, it wasn't as light and fatty as some places where I have tried this dish.  The complementing flavors were fine but not extraordinarily memorable.

 I finished it off with a couple of the house's version of the Sazerac cocktail (easily the best one I found in the MGM Grand).  These cocktails were made appropriately with just a small hint of simple syrup and the correct notes of absinthe.  

In closing, NobHill certainly has quite a bit to offer.  As it is, I think I'd like to go again to try that lobster pot pie and a number of other appetizers.  Strongly recommended if you are eating within the MGM Grand.",K7thO1n-vZ9PFYiC7nTR2w,4,4,4,777sAHNGuq19Qf10Z3UEvg

When I had a chance to visit Vegas for a night, I decided to give his Vegas place a try, Nobhill Tavern.   After all, it was recommended by a foodie friend.

Sadly, Nobhill Tavern does not do the Michael Mina name right.   Our service was quite slow and just.. off... in most ways.   The restaurant wasn't extremely busy, but it seemed extremely difficult to catch the eye of a waiter.

Food.  Started with the foie gras mousse and cheese fondue.  The foie gras was a terrine, not a mousse, and wasn't really that great.  Like a terrine, it was cold and difficult to spread, whereas we were expecting a more malleable format.  Tasted good, though.  Cheese fondue was nice, tasty, but really, it's a vat of melted cheese.  Tough to go wrong.

Main courses.   Opted for the short ribs, which were actually really, really good, although the lighting in the restaurant makes it difficult to photograph.  The mashed potatoes were smooth and silky and the vegetables cooked very well.   Could have been prettier, but short ribs are never really pretty.    Nearly opted for the $85 (!!!) lobster pot pie, but didn't.  I'm glad, too.   It didn't look nearly as good as I was hoping it would. 

Dessert.   Let down.  Opted for the salty strawberry ice cream, which looked strange, had strange textures, and overall just didn't mesh well together.    The table next got souffles, which looked great.  Maybe that's a better way to go.

The food:  It was very good to excellent and you have to be in Vegas at these prices.

I wont regurgitate the reviews on the lobster pot pie but they are dead-on and it was excellent.

It has been several years since I dined here, yet I still compare all other foo foo dining experiences to that night - and even the mighty have still come up short.

Tiers of things with crab and a giant shrimp, a waiter fucking fed me wine from a cup like a naughty food communion, I ate slippery foie gras with my fingers.  Steak. Reductions.  Words I couldn't pronounce. Truffled mac n cheese.  Shit was set ablaze before me. And then came the lobster pot pie.  Brought out through darkness and steam by my waiter (was he even still wearing a shirt by that point....) in a shiny copper pot, he then sliced open the butter crust atop and reconstructed the entire meat of the lobster on the plate before me. There are no words.  I'm sure there was some sort of dessert, maybe even two, how would I know.  Four bites in of the lobster was the climax of the whole meal.

After...I walked into the light.  The perfectly small portions had not left me full - no food baby consequences - but my head was spinning, my face was plastered with a dopey smile and my hair was mussed.

I've only eaten here the one time and with the six courses I would think there would be at least one item that would have caught my attention but there wasn't.   I would say your money could be spent better someplace else.   This was a very, very expensive meal and a good time but I wouldn't recommend it.",3n7udMf0jLa38ZPrG3JM3w,1,0,2,mKPIZB5ZVT8HODVK-S1jvA

I waited a bit for anyone to come by and when my waiter did come he was disinterested and unhelpful. When I asked how the Brussels Sprouts were prepared he said they were grilled but in a tone that indicated I was stupid for asking. I shook it off and ordered the chilled English pea soup, beer-battered shrimp appetizer & Brussels sprouts side dish. I was slightly annoyed when everything arrived at once but the waiter who delivered everything was quite helpful in explaining key elements of the dish. The soup was served with creme fraiche and was quite refreshing.  The Brussel sprouts are served in a small cast iron skillet with pork, something my apathetic waiter might have wanted to mention. Nevertheless they were very good. The clear star was the shrimp, perfectly fried and seasoned. They were accompanied by delicous yucca steps and an avocado sauce. I ate each dish one by one and my waiter failed to remove a single dish from the table. He gave me a refill and never removed a dish, he brought the check and never removed a dish. The table actually got cleared when the maitre d' was walking by and picked up the menagerie of empty dishes after I received and signed the check.. I will add that I was sitting in the lounge and there was only one other table.

Nobhill is just that, not a bad thing per se, but just no POP.  

Dining room is very sparse, with a few isolated booths available adjacent from the bar.  We were seated at a large square table next to the bar and the main walkway: huge foot traffic.  

Water & wine were requested on several occasions through the evening, but our server Ryan made the best out of a busy evening of parties heading out to the show @ the Garden Arena.  

Tasting menu: only ONE, the COOKBOOK menu, MM's signature.  BORING.  It's at TWO of his other restaurants.  VERY disappointing. 

Amuse: A lightly fried ball of risotto.  A salty ball of guilty pleasure.

So we opted for our own 'tasting':

1. 'Palace' Green Goddess Salad w/Watercress, parmesan, red onion marmalade, simple, fresh ingredients, the perfect amount of dressing.  I would have liked some other texture in addition to all the leaves and cheese.

2. Red Lentil Soup w/curry, wonderfully thick, hearty & robust.  Reminded me of the season.  Tiny diver scallops were seared and tossed in as a nice surprise element. 

3. Seared Hamachi, buttery, so much as to say it was remiscent of otoro.

4. 'Solari's Grill' Dungeness Crab Louie w/baby hearts of romaine, avo, & Louie dressing, three lettuce wraps, good, but the Louie sauce was a bit creamy & overwhelming for the sweet crab.

5. Lobstertail w/a balsalmic reduction.  Liked the reduction, but the nothing was special about the dish or the crustacean.  

6. Foie Gras atop Scallops, good, but really how can you go wrong with this heart stopping dish?!?

7. Black Cod, w/broth & Israeli cous cous, had this at MM SF & I liked it more the second time around, fabulous light broth, beautiful piece of fish & I love Israel's version of the grain!  Five types of mash came separately on the side, whimsical, but unnecessary.

8. Apple Trio: fritter, sorbet & cider.  Eh.  Everything was sticky sweet. 

Price, not so bad, we ordered to our hearts desire + 6 glasses of wine & a double espresso for under 4 bills. 

All in all a good experience and quality food.  I would NOT pick this for a special occasion, more for a biz function.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,1,2,4,jz-OVetKyyzrnfONjllUfw

The decor is impressive.  Even though we didn't get one of the secluded booths, if we make it back to Vegas, we will be sure to request one of these. 

The wine list is extensive and includes something for everyone.  Great selection.

We started with the Charcuterie platter.  This included their house-made pate which was amazing.  Great platter to start off a great meal.

My wife ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Kobe burger.  I vowed before we came to Vegas that I would have Kobe and this seemed like the best time to try it.  It may have been one of the best burgers that I've ever had.  It was like velvet, and perfectly prepared.  It came with an overwhelming side of frites, which were delicious.  I also ordered a side of the Truffle Mac and Cheese.  Amazing.

2008429,2010-09-15,1,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"The good: 
1) Nice location, particularly if you are staying at the MGM Grand or Signature.  If you're somewhere else on the strip it might be a bit farther though.
2) Friendly service
3) Nice decor -- it's more of a romantic place than maybe a place for a bunch of loud girls though
4) The french onion soup was fantastic, it came with the soup and instead of the cheese and crouton on top, it came with a grilled cheese sandwich.  Very nice touch.  Very tasty (although possibly too salty for some, perfect for me)
5) The lobster pot pie -- nice presentation, the crust was flaky and buttery, the lobster was tasty
6) I liked the chard that came with my meal!
7) The cheesy bread was my favorite part of the meal.  Which is actually really sad if you think about it.

The bad:
1) I ordered the pork, it was tough and very bland to me.  It was really disappointing
2) A friend ordered the short ribs -- she enjoyed them, I also thought they were really underwhelming.  Not tender, not flavorful.  They weren't awful, but pretty disappointing.
3) The lobster was sadly $85 -- but this might be worth it to some people.
4) Here's the most disappointing part for me -- we were offered still or sparking water, we took still.  What they didn't mention that it was bottled water and they were charging $8/bottle.


They apparently served us 5 bottles of water totaling $40 (this was for 6 people) which means adding on tip (18%) and tax (9%) meant we spent $50.8 on WATER.

Ok, that's not bad, that's ridiculous.
and it makes me feel very angry.  They talk about restaurants charging two or three times the cost of a bottle of wine -- well how about the 4-8 times for an all ready overly inflated cost of water?

The meal was way too expensive especially considering it wasn't that great and the fact that washing the proverbial bad taste was a significant cost.

We aren't in China or Switzerland.  You ask your patrons if they would like bottled or tap water -- 

terrible experience.

2013703,2011-08-18,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Had a nice decadent Vegas dinner at this joint over the weekend.  We sat in the separated booths behind the bar, which was probably a good thing since the dining room looked packed.  Our table was quiet and intimate so we got a little break from Vegas.  The sommelier was awesome.  He recommended a frech white that paired very well with the lobster pot pie.  I have to give the sommelier props for reading us correctly and suggesting wines at a wide variety of pricepoints.    

We did the appetizer sampler which was a fun way to get a variety of tastes, I liked everything on the plate.  In retrospect the lobster roll before the lobster pot pie was a bit much.  

The lobster pot pie itself was good, but this is where I'm taking the fifth star away.  One of the best parts of a pot pie is the pastry crust, in this case the pie crust was a little dense and hard for my liking.  I wasn't too upset because I was too full to eat it and the items in the pie were amazing.  

After taking a break we couldn't resist the marscapone cheesecake, it was so good.  I've been inspired to go home and start practiciing my cheesecake because I have been inspired to take it to the next level.  Very simple, but well executed cheesecake.

2018374,2013-02-19,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Nobhill Tavern is an upscale take on tavern food (read: kicked-up comfort food with a few diversions). The restaurant was very busy but it was not difficult to get a Saturday night reservation. Keeping with the tavern theme, the restaurant is decorated modern furnishings in dark woods and dark earth tones, with low light, giving the whole place a masculine ambience.

The menu has lots of interesting choices, but is not overwhelming. The wine list, on the other hand, is very extensive. It was late (9 pm) and we weren't in the mood for a heavy dinner, so we settled on a shared main course and a variety of appetizers and side dishes instead. We really wanted to try the lobster pot pie that others had raved about, but they were out of it. Disappointing!! Instead, the server suggested the braised lamb shank, served with a cinnamon infused couscous with golden raisins. We also ordered steamed spinach, truffle mac and cheese, crab and lobster rolls, and bbq pulled pork finger sandwiches. 

For the crab and lobster rolls, a dollop of crab and lobster salad was served atop a soft roll. Each of the rolls could be eaten in two bites (or one if you're really ambitious), and there were three rolls on the plate, for $17. A bit pricy, but they were delicious! The crab and lobster salad was bound with creme fraiche, delicately flavored with chives and tarragon. 

Pulled pork in a rich bbq sauce was served on what looked like the bottom of a slider bun, and so weren't really ""sandwiches"". The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, but not too bad. I've definitely had better pulled pork bbq. 

The truffled mac and cheese was very rich, consisting of elbow macaroni in a truffle oil infused cheese sauce, and mixed with shiitake mushrooms and broccoli. We were told there were black truffle shavings in it, but we didn't detect any. Though a bit of a splurge (in calories mainly), this was a great side dish.

The lamb shank had a nice coating of herbs and spices, and was served with a rich sauce infused with warm spices. The lamb was fork tender and melted in your mouth, but really needed some salt. Unfortunately, the lamb was the centerpiece of the meal, and so dragged our whole experience down a bit.

On the whole, the meal was good, but there were a few missteps. If we come back, we'll come earlier for the lobster pot pie!",XgC-tldjfHKrN5EOQxEBQg,0,0,4,_BuThV6OuTeZk-XsL9TvDA

I know the economy sucks right now, and I know that they probably have a ton of expensive bottles sitting in their cellar with little hope of being ordered anytime soon.  I did not appreciate the dismissive attitude when I said I was probably going to order a glass or a half bottle.  My wife wanted seafood and I wanted the short ribs, so there weren't going to be too many reasonably priced bottles that were going to work for both of us.

We arrived at 5:15, and were greeted promptly and guided to the bar while we waited to be seated. We ordered a bottle of wine while we waited, a mere $140. I don't think there was a bottle of wine under $60 with most in the $100-$200 range. 

At 5:30, the host came over and we were seated in one of the several private booths across from the bar area. It was nice to have a little bit of privacy, although the restaurant wasn't that loud, since it was early and on a weekday. The 'theme' of this restaurant is San Francisco, being part of the Michael Minna group. All the booths were named after streets in San Francisco. Our was Jones, which happens to be our last name. It think this was intentional on their part.

The waiter brought out the menus, and we spent a few minutes looking over it. For appetizer I chose the Corn Soup. A little pricey at $21 but I figured it must be damn good soup if they can charge that much. My parents ordered salads. My dad got a Crab Louie salad, and my mom a  ""Palace"" Green Goddess Salad with Organic Watercress & Aged Parmesan. 

For entree,  I was a little disappointed as I didn't see any steak on the menu. However, when the waiter came back he announce some specials, which included  a 16oz Bone in Ribeye ($78), and an 8 oz Kobe Rib Roast ($85). After salivating all over the table, I ordered the Ribeye, and my Mom orderes the Kobe Beef. My dad went with the Rack of Lamb ($61).

To start with the waiter brought out an Amuse Bouche, which was a chilled Seared scallop, served on some micro greens with a sesame oil and pomegranate dressing. I'm not a seafood nut, but enjoyed this thoroughly.

The appetizers were outstanding. The waiter brought out a bowl for my soup which has a small pile of bell pepper and 2 large shrimp. The soup was in a 'pitcher', and poured into my bowl tableside. The soup was extremely smooth, and creamy, with several corn kernels submerged in it. The shrimp were a little over salted for my liking, but still not the worst shrimp I'd ever had in my life. My parent devoured their salads in minutes. The portion for the goddess salad was large, more than my mom was expecting for an appetizer. 

When the entrees arrived we all looked at each other an smiled. We knew this was going to be good. The ribeye was cooked to perfection,  with great marbling. The flavor was outstanding. However, I was still dying to try some of my moms Kobe Beef. I cut a small piece, and as I bit into it, I died and went to heaven.  It actually didn't even taste like beef. It was something completely new,something I had never tasted before. Like a whole new animal. The only draw back was that it was 8oz. My mom was very happy. This was actually the first time she had tried Kobe beef, and didn't really know what it was. Once i recovered from the Kobe beef sampling, I finished my ribeye, along with the vegetable and potatoes  it was served with. It was also served with a home made Worcestershire Sauce ( or Wuster sauce as we Brits call it). Much better than the Lea and Perrins bottled stuff. 

My dads enjoyed his lamb, although the portion seemed a little small. But still a hearty meal. They also brought out a platter of mashed potato for us all to share. It was served on a heating tray, with I think 5 or six different flavors of mashed potato. 

By the time dessert came around, my mom and I were stuffed, but my dad opted for a chocolate banana pudding, with chocolate sorbet. My dad didn't even offer to share it with us. It was gone in 60 seconds. 

With our after dinner coffee, they brought us a plate of small madeleines, which were light and fluffy, and easy to eat after such a heavy meal. 

The total bill came out to almost $490, but was definitely worth it. I would certainly go back again there someday.",6nIo6Ekhlzv6r8T9X_LC0A,5,3,5,SvvlqOqwNkxqOwriVOdqZQ

2178512,2011-09-30,3,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"This is a review of their late night happy hour.

The Skinny: albeit the majority are Lilliputian sized servings, the American comfort food classics are flavourful...don't miss the fries with truffle aioli! (3.5), the service is a little slow, FYI - the service is a little better at the bar (3), value: considering the caliber of the cuisine, $64 to try all 8 dishes was a steal (5).

It's a rare thing for something to convince me to stay out past 10 pm (girls need their beauty sleep!). The happy hour at Nob Hill was just added to that list.

We were lucky enough to have two other people joining us on our late night culinary excursion so it made a perfect group to try the entire happy hour menu. 

The menu consists of 8 items for $8 each. On the menu: fries with truffle aioli, beer battered shrimp with avocado lime dipping sauce, rhubard mixed green salad, red pepper and spinach flatbread with mixed greens, asian styled chicken wings, pulled pork sandwiches, lobster roll, and a charcuterie plate. 

Best deal of the bunch? The fries with truffle aioli... hands down. The fries are golden, mildly nutty, and perfectly crispy even after they had gotten a little cold.  Paired with the truffle aioli, this heaping mound of magic (and yes! it is a large heaping mound!) is a must order when  you come here.

I would say that the remaining items are much smaller portion sizes. 

The pulled pork sandwiches were a highlight of the meal. The saucy little morsels are remarkably tender, slightly smoky and sweet with a mild kick of heat from the jalapeno. It was comfort food in a bite.

The rhubarb mixed green salad was delightful because of the combination of sweet and sour on the plate. The firm texture of the rhubarb was a wonderful touch and added an different take than your usual stewed versions.

The beer batter shrimp were light, crunchy with just enough batter. However, I would like to mention that the accompanying avocado-lime dipping sauce was a little too heavy for me and needed more acidity to brighten the flavours.

The charcuterie plate was your standard lovely plate of various pates and cold cuts. Nothing extraordinary and could have definitely used more accompanying bread.

The lobster roll was okay - perhaps a little too much on the mayo and too little of the lobster, it seemed a little overpriced. Juxtaposed with the wonderful pulled porkies, it seemed a little underwhelming.

The red pepper and spinach flatbread was a little bland, and the crust was a little too dense and thin for our tastes. The mixed greens it came with were nothing special either.

The Asian-styled chicken wings had a poor texture despite being fried up. The P.F. Chang-esque sweet/sour/spicy sauce didn't really help either. Thumbs down.

Overall,  there were some great items (ie, fries with truffle aioli) and some ""what were they thinking when they put this on the menu"" (ie, Asian-style chicken wings) which is why the cuisine rates a 3.5.  However, factoring the cost for some of the outstanding items, it evens this joint to a four starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,3,4,-JdawW3c2SMlpZheo3CK1g

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!",HCP1pR_44Pw5_BiWAp47-Q,48,46,4,crBMZA0iMUWSRjt7nYj4_g

We made reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival. It took our server a little while to actually get over to us (close to 10 minutes), which is a bummer when you're thirsty after walking pregnantly down the Strip...but not a huge deal. We eventually got water and all was well again.

For food I went what I guess is the signature house dish - the lobster pot pie. This entree is sort of an event in itself. A server brings it out on a cart, cuts off the pot pie top and puts it on a plate, and then ladles out the lobster-ness on top of it. Creamy, fresh, and yummy, for sure. However, this dish is INCREDIBLY pricey, even for lobster - as in $85 pricey. There was enough lobster to share this dish between two people, so if you're interested in trying it, I would recommend going that route. 

Boyfriend had pork chops, which, in all honesty, we both liked better than the lobster pot pie - and I'm not even a huge pork chop fan. We also both shared the truffle mac and cheese, which was good. 

I was a little bummed overall by our server. There are some servers in the world who will immediately judge a table as soon as they order water to drink. I get it. I used to wait tables and I get that sometimes there are certain customer stereotypes that usually start with ordering water. But I'm pregnant, guys. Your wine list looks amazing, but I'm pregnant. Plus I'm ordering an $85 lobster thingy. And I'm going to leave you a big tip. And I'm a nice human being who deserves great service, even when trying to hydrate in the simplest of ways. You don't need to pay me less attention than your other customers just because I'm ordering water. 

Anyway.

Luckily, I had been to Nobhill for a bachelorette dinner back in September, and after a wonderful experience that night, I knew this would be a hit for all. 

Nobhill did not disappoint. 

First of all, I love the dark & cozy decor in Nobhill, and while they call it a tavern, it is definitely one of the most upscale ""taverns"" I have ever been in.

The trio of breads in the basket were delicious and came with herb infused olive oil for dipping. This was a great little starter as all of us were pretty hungry. 

We opted not to get a bottle of wine because I couldn't imagine paying that much for a bottle when we could get individual drinks much more reasonably and this worked out well for our party since we were all being ""good"" anyway :)

The bf ordered the Kobe burger, which came with fries and he enjoyed it. He said the secret sauce was good and hearty, so the burger really filled him up. The Kobe burger came with fries also, which we didn't expect because it wasn't listed on the menu. 

I had the chicken with risotto, which was some of the best chicken I have ever had. So moist and juicy and just all around delicious. I am a huge fan of anything with rice, so the mushroom risotto was outstanding. 

Not expecting sides on our plates, the bf and I ordered the truffle mac & cheese and the side of mushrooms. The mushrooms were a nice mix of different types and were amazing. The truffle mac & cheese was good, but not really memorable for me. I think I had much higher expectations there. 

My parents split the short ribs and they couldn't stop raving about them.  Since the portions are large, splitting was plenty of food for both of them and they left very full.

In the end, each of us loved the food and were so enthralled with our own food that we couldn't even look at anyone else's plate to taste test other dishes.  We couldn't even order desserts!!

The food was definitely the highlight of the experience and the ambiance was incredible. 

One low point was that our waiter was a little lax with us in the beginning, which made us a little nervous being that we had to leave by a certain time to be at our show. Did we need to order a bottle of wine to make us feel worth his while?  I'm not sure but it kind of felt that way.
The manager came over to check in with us before we had ordered and we expressed our time concern, so he started taking our order and then our waiter quickly came over and took over from there. 
Too bad that he needed a little kick in the butt to get started, but at least we were able to be to our show on time with very happy taste buds and stomachs!",R38P1VuvydpcfNnThg9bHw,0,0,5,_G2xcxMpTbFRA9yqNKYrAQ

The menu has been changed to appeal to a younger crowd from the best I can tell.  The cocktails are now prohibition-esque & the menu is primarily simple comfort food, done in an upscale fashion.  It's a nice Vegas take on the increasingly popular SF gastropub.  The cocktails were delicious as usual, and the food was on point.  We ordered the three course tasting (around $55) and a couple appetizers.  Word to the wise: you don't need any extra appetizers!  All the tasting menu items are the full size menu portion despite the much lower price.  The restaurant was happy to serve my pork medium-rare which was a thrill to me :-D

LATE NIGHT HAPPY HOUR: 1000PM-MIDNIGHT!

$8 Food Items!  We got the ""Lobster Rolls""...which was really Lobster Salad on top of warm soft bread.  Very good but also very small: Only Three 3-inch long pieces.  I loved the nice bartenders though, they totally warned me on what was small and what wasn't before ordered...they also got sliders, fladbread, and other snacks for $8...good when it comes to Vegas prices.  

$8 Cocktails! Hard to find even in my native San Diego, more or less in Vegas! I highly reccommend the Bourbon Crusta and Cucumber Gimlet.  They also got domestic beers for $4.  

Atmosphere is very classy, elegant, candle lit, and quiet(It was a Wednesday night).  The regular restaurant menu looks reasonable and delicious too.  I tried to get a ""Buy 1 Get 1 Free"" Cert from the Tix4Dinner.com booth, but I was too late and they sold out.  I hope to try this famous ""Lobster Pot Pie"" someday...better luck next time!

2466885,2008-09-27,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"The last of the Michael Mina restaurants in Las Vegas for me to try out. I have to say, it was quite disappointing.   I found the food to be average and not up to par as his other restaurants.   Ordered was the Trio of shellfish, Trio of American Kobe Beef, the duck with foie-gras, and suckling pig with perigord truffles. 

Of the trio appetizers, the best shellfish dish was the lobster carpaccio and from the beef appetizer, the pho broth, Vietnamese salad.  The broth was really good. 

I really didn't care for my dish, the suckling pig. And my friend gave me the foie-gras from his duck dish.   Now, I love foie-gras, especially seared, but this one needed salt and just tasted fatty and oily (duh).

From past experience at his other restaurants, I don't expect much from his desserts.  And the dessert ordered also agreed with my opinion.  We both shared the Farmers Market Strawberries with candied fennel, pistachio sorbet, creme fraiche sorbet.  Only the pistachio sorbet was tasty, the rest was just blah.  The coffee that they serve on the other hand was good.  It is his own blend from LAMILL.   I wonder if they will sell it to the public?

I went with my cousin and a friend and we began with a bottle of wine, which the sommelier suggested.  I believe it was a JJ Prum Riesling.  The riesling was probably the best I have had (good thing too since it cost us $100).  I also ordered a cable car because apparently that is one of their signature cocktails.  The cable car definitely tasted better than I expected.  

We ordered the appetizer sampler, which came with beef skewers (the best tasting item of the trio, very tender and flavorful), duck confit egg rolls (ehh weren't that great, not much taste) and the crab truffles (again, not very memorable).  I of course had to order the lobster pot pie since everyone raves about it.  At $95, I expected it to be AMAZING.  Unfortunately, I don't think it met my expectations.  The lobster was well cooked and tender, and the top crust of the pot pie was buttery-flaky goodness, but it just didn't WOW me.  I didn't feel like I just ate something worth my money.  I actually felt that the pot pie was a little too rich.  My cousin and friend ordered the sonoma fried chicken, which was okay (I didn't have that much of it, but the truffle mac n cheese was good).  

For dessert we ordered a souffle, which was really good.  It came with peppermint ice-cream, and the ice cream was probably one of the worst ice-creams I have ever had.  It didn't taste like peppermint at all, and my friend compared it to ""a skunk"".  We informed our server and he brought us out three scoops of the maple flavor we said we would like to try instead.  The maple ice cream was much better.
The server was also made aware that it was my birthday, so he brought out three ginger mojito amuse bouches.

The menu isn't extensive but excellent. For the exceptional quality of the food, the prices are quite reasonable - especially compared to the other high end restaurants at MGM.

We tried the shrimp cocktail, pate and cheese fondue appetizers and all were excellent. We also had the onion soup and seared fois gras. Be prepared for the fact that some of Michael Mina's dishes are ""deconstructed."" As an example, the onion soup came with the melted cheese placed between two slices of wonderful bread. You are then to dip this into the soup and eat it. It was very good. The seared fois gras was also very good, but overpriced, at $25.00, compared to the prices of the other items on the menu - this was the only disappointment.

We came over for dinner to this restaurant before a show at the Ka Theater, and the food here was amazing. 
We started off dinner with the Swiss Gruyere Cheese Fondue- for me it was the highlight of the meal, the cheese was was delicious on its own, but when paired with the fresh sourdough bread (imported from San Francisco), it made the combinations amazing! This is a must try! In addition, the meal was complimented with a basket of fresh baked bread,  which consisted of sourdough, focacia, and a biscuit of some sort- also great in the fondue.

The bar area looked really cool and is a great place to get a drink and enjoy the 'feel' of the location, the design, etc.

I did notice that some folks complain about showing up late and realizing that they aren't serving the full menu, but instead a special late night menu.  I don't see this as a problem at all, just understand if you roll up pretty late in the evening that they won't still be serving dinner.",chbFEnHl6pWSSUsgKxFjIA,1,0,4,Eu3O36ep_S9oB4HsvubpjQ
2787069,2008-09-22,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Lynn & I first came to Nob Hill a year ago.  We came in for a drink when we arrived early for our reservations at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, and thought we should come back for dinner . . . so we did.

There IS a theory that (see Kayla's review) people will make fun of you or that you shouldn't eat here or be wowed here if you live in the City (or in the SF Bay area).  But Nob Hill is better than Michael Mina's restaurant in the St. Francis.  Seriously.

The wine list is serious, AND seriously overpriced.  BUT, I do have to say, a careful review of the list CAN find some serious bargains.  (Indeed, the sommelier came over after half-way through our meal to ask who ordered the wine -- and complimented me on the Champagne and the white Burgundy I selected.)

The lobster pot pie is FANTASTIC!  Yes, it's a signature dish; yes, it's a bit of a cliche.  But damn! it's amazingly rich, flavorful, and to-die-for . . . .

Rumour has it the menu and/or the concept is soon changing here.  So get it while you can.

Only complaint:  it is ridiculously expensive.  So figure it's really four-and-a-half stars . . .",BhwaJuqrwt_Stlf4XndzzQ,0,0,4,Hi5g9NnC9vpf6xZyX9Essw

- order a 3 course prix fixe dinner from nobhill for $40

2797626,2012-02-27,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"I came here with a large group because I wanted to try one of Michael Mina's restaurants and liked the SF themed menu. Between the 12 of us, we ordered a significant variety of food, all of which was delicious. I ordered the pork belly (which was incredible), my wife ordered the spare ribs (which were also great), and we shared a salad (which was equally as delicious). Other notable orders within the group were, Kobe burger (and sliders), lobster rolls, NY steak, caesar salad, and chicken. Overall, the food tasted very fresh and true to its flavors. Also, the service was impeccable. My wife ordered a cucumber Collins, and the bar did not initially have a cucumber on hand to make the drink so our waiter suggested a very close alternative to my wife, which she loved. Thereafter, he had gone to get a cucumber so that they would have it on hand in the event she ordered another (which she did). I will definitely make this a regular stop for us in Vegas. 

There is one negative from the entire experience, which was merely with regards to policy. In order to make a reservation for a group of 11 or more (even in the main dinning room without any preset menu) there is a nonrefundable booking fee of $125 that is a flat fee and does not go towards the bill. Additionally, there is a $500 deposit (which does go towards the bill) and a minimum of $75/ person and the average per person cost for our group was $60-$70, after tax and tip. We ended up making two reservations for 6 and requested to be next to one another, however, they were not able to so (although a party of 13, divided into a group of 6 and 7, were able to be seated right next to each and were even allowed to push the tables next to each other to make one long table for all 13 - the only difference between our groups was that theirs was comprised of all middle aged white males).",Yaon8ONFW9YfyWvmrf1N1Q,3,0,5,9kMEv3Ugct1-Pz-IU5L0Yw

The front desk did not have our reservations in their system when we first walked in. Nonetheless, the hostess was very accomodating and friendly and had us sit at the bar until she could figure out a table for us. We both had delicious drinks at the bar and were seated promptly.

The wine list was extensive but not unbearably so. I chose the Michael Minna sparkling wine from Napa upon the waiter's recommendation. It was dry and had a light citrus taste, and it went perfectly with the seared foie gras I chose as an appetizer. The foie was generous and seared to perfection, served with a canelle of cranberry relish and two sizable toasted pieces of brioche. Excellent!

For the main I chose the Truffled Lobster Pot Pie..WOW! I was surprised when the runner/lobster server person wheeled out on a cart, the actual copper pot itself, topped with a pastry puff! If you have never had this signature dish before, you really must..it was to die for!! The young man adeptly cut around the top of the pastry and set it down as a base for the lobster on the plate he then proceeded to extract what seemed an endless array of lobster parts and braised vegetables from the gleaming copper pot. He topped it all off with a delicious ragu of brown truffled sauciness .... mmm. My mouth is watering just thinking about it..

I couldn't eat another bite after that, although I would have loved to try thier desert menu. My dining partner had the Grilled Short Ribs served with grits and coleslaw..which also looked and tasted amazing..Our server was very knowledgeable and humorous without being over the top.

2958024,2007-08-21,2,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"There are restaurants and then there are Restaurants.  Nobhill is not just a restaurant.  It is a Restaurant -- with a capital R.  It is the kind of place you wish you could dine at on a regular basis not just because it would mean you have more money than you know is morally right for you, but because it is the type of sanctuary that can actually make you feel as though you are a better person.

Some people go to the spa to relax, others lay out by the pool, others still might want just to soak in the tub.  But for me, take me to Nobhill and all my problems will melt away.  Screw Calgon; NOBHILL, TAKE ME AWAY!

One of the reasons why I think Nobhill is a Restaurant, and not just restaurant, is because of the decor.  Simply put, the decor is both subtle and sophisticated.  Swathed in modern yet elegent taupes and browns, there is very little in the dining room to distract you from the delicious food and the flawless service.  With the exception of a few silver-toned accents and art pieces, the walls are remarkably bare.  Some restaurants try too hard wth their decor, and in doing so they become obnoxious as a result their extravagance.  Not Nobhill.  This Restaurant is so tastefully appointed that it is, in many ways, a very un-Vegas Vegas restaurant.  In this case, less was definitely more.

Dinner began with some wine instructions.  I brought with me a 2003 Les Forts de Latour (the second label of Chateau Latour) and asked them to decant it in advance of our meal, which they did, and without any hesitation or callous snobbery.

Likewise, our order was also taken without any kind of artificial attitude.  As a side note: I don't care what people thought of Steven from Top Chef Season 1, but the people at this Restaurant, which is where he works, are not slimeballs.  Unlike at some high-end restaurants, our server was neither pretentious nor obsequious.  He neither pushed us towards the expensive items on the menu, nor discouraged sharing.  He was, in fact, very welcoming and down to earth -- neither reserved nor a shill.

Someone has already mentioned the bread and butter, so I won't go into details here, but I thought it was very cool how they would bake the bread right there in dining room and then serve it on a heated slab of granite.  It would then remain warm by resting on the votive box in the middle of the table.

As is the case with all Michael Mina Restaurants, we were treated to an amuse bouche at the start of our dinner, which this time was a little sliver of foie gras topped with minced Asian pears.  It was both salty and sweet, creamy and crunchy.  What an incredible way to begin the meal!

For our first course, we shared the Dungeness Crab Louis, served on a bed of baby hearts of romaine and avocado.  The salad was light, yet creamy, and not at all what I was expecting.  I had always thought that Crab Louis was just crab and a kind of thousand island dressing.  But this dressing was not as sweet and had a nice little kick of spice, which paired very nicely with our glasses of Henriot champagne.

Our main courses were the Angus Beef, with Seared Foie Gras, Potato Cakes and a Pinot Reduction, and the Olive Oil Poached Lamb Loin, with Goat Cheese Puffs and a Garbanzo Bean and Spring Onion Medley.  Both were amazing, in both texture and taste.  The seemingly modest bean and onion medley was, in fact, so good that I could have eaten a whole bowl of it!  I may have left some of the lamb on my plate, but damn if wasn't going to eat up every last bit of my veggies!

For dessert, we shared a Tangerine Souffle, which was topped with a tangerine and vanilla sorbet.  Although they did not have anything that seemed to pair well with our dessert on the wine list, our server made the effort to find some German eiswein at the bar, which ended up being a match made in heaven!  Both were delicious on their own, but together ... ahh ... Nobhill, take me away!

As I mentioned at the outset, the service was flawless, but not in a swift-and-efficient-yet-robotic kind of way.  Our server was actually very engaging and friendly and made me feel like I deserved to be there.  It turns out that he grew up in Orange County, so throughout our meal, we chatted with him about OC living, talked about the wine (we gave him a glass), and before we left he gave me the names of some people at Studio at the Montage, Mozambique, and Maestro's Ocean Club.  He said that if I mentioned his name, they would do something special for us.

So as I rolled out of Nobhill and into the vacuous din of the MGM casino, I could not help but feel like I was going to miss this place.  Even though I was stuffed to the gills, I almost did not want to leave.  Why?  Because it is a Restaurant.",cWVsDzn7L7dwL9c5tubwaQ,3,4,5,KhbSPypAZcRzNUxtVRzayw

The Main Lobster Pot Pie is overhyped.  There.  I said it (*ducking*).

If the lobster pot pie cost half of the current market price ($85 this past weekend), then it would taste a whole lot better.  But I split a pie with my friend and it was just sad to see spread out in front of me 3 small chunks of lobster and a lobster tail and know that I was paying 40+ for my portion of that.  The lobster had some truffle cream sauce around it, but it wasn't exactly swimming in it as I had expected.  The lobster chunks tasted fresh, and the truffle cream sauce was good.  But the crust - the beautifully golden crust looked so promising when the pie was rolled out on the serving cart.  Unfortunately, the crust was so flavorless and dry that once I ran out of the truffle cream sauce to dip it in (and that didn't take long because there was not much to begin with), I had to gulp down water in order to wash down the crust.  I'm not saying don't order the lobster pot pie  - just don't go in like I did expecting it to rock your palate.

If you plan to split lobster pot pie, you will probably need appetizers to fill you up. These appetizers are not to be missed: Chilled Cucumber Soup, Seared Foie Gras, Tomato Fondue (especially the latter!).  

The Braised Beef Short Rib was decent - the best part being the peas and carrots and not the short rib.  My friend got the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna and said that was one of the least appetizing tuna dishes he's ever ordered at a restaurant.  

Service was excellent, except the kitchen forgot one of our orders (so we just cancelled it).  My friends really enjoyed the wine.",eDne98UiRXevZmWPzRfegw,4,2,3,JjvHnRf7MSoZbBB660EyrA

Caesar salad was delicious, very cold and crisp lettuce and one of the best dressings in a long time but I don't care for the long whole pieces but thats just a detail, still an excellent salad. Soup was good but the least favorite of the apps. For Mains we had a Lobster Pot Pie, Osso Buccos, Scallops and Skirt steaks. The Pot Pie lived up to it's reputation. The presentation is pretty fab and the portion is large and cooked perfectly. Osso Buccos were a hit, fork tender, rich sauce and a very big serving. Scallops looked beautiful, had a perfect sear and nearly melted in your mouth - excellent. Steaks were fine, cooked to order. I didn't taste them but looked very good. Mains, except for the lobster pot pie, came with really good sides. We also had Creamed Spinach and Truffled Mac and Cheese for the table.

Delicious bourbon cream sauce, meaty lobster, hefty price ($85, which was the current market price).  If you're watching your wallet, this dish is definitely enough to split between two people as it contains an entire lobster.  Ask for another helping of their tasty bread (and dam was their bread good) and dip to your satisfaction.

We also ordered the Cioppino which couldn't really compare to the main event.  The scallops/shrimp were undercooked in my opinion, but the clams and mussels were tasty.  The Cioppino broth was pretty delicious, so I'll give points for that.  

We also had a side of Brussel Sprouts and while the waitress told us that it was amazing, it was just average at best.  The sprouts were way too oily and weren't caramelized as much as I liked.  The pancetta they used were fantastic however.

3434844,2012-01-12,13,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"UPDATE: We want to thank Nobhill Tavern's bartender extraordinaire, Michael, for making our wedding's cocktail hour so spectacular. You see, Michael, maker of my favorite cocktail in the world, the Cable Car, aka spiked Orange Bang, aka spiked Orange Julius, gave us a crash course last fall on how to make these frothy wonder drinks. From our first sip, two years ago, to our 50th, all made by him, we knew that this was what we wanted for our signature drink. Michael graciously made that happen for us.

He took a good chunk of time out of his day to show us step-by-step directions, tricks and tips. It probably helped that since we see him EVERY TIME we're in Vegas and knows us by name, we're almost family. The reason he was so vital is because Nobhill Tavern's Cable Car can't be duplicated. Trust me, I've searched, tried and sipped. We even had one at Caesar's Palace, just to compare, and it was absolute swill. 

Everyone we've ever taken to Nobhill Tavern has gotten absolutely hooked on their Cable Cars. I'm not talking, ""yeah, that was pretty good,"" I'm talking, ""do we have time to go back to Nobhill Tavern?"" and ""since we're in Vegas, can we stop by MGM and get some Cable Cars?"" Nobhill Tavern really crafts a work of art and we can't thank Michael enough for making our signature drink, the toast of our big day! 

PS Their food is pretty damn good too, unfortunately, since those super tasty Cable Cars sneak up on you, I can't recall specifics from any of my meals other than I recall it being yum. I def do recall that the service was spectacular because those Cable Cars were coming out to our table lighting fast as if on a conveyor belt.

3442701,2013-01-23,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"In fairness, I would've given this restaurant 2.5, but since the biggest detractor to me was the food, rounded down accordingly.

I have to say, the service was spectacular; our waiter was incredibly attentive and accommodating, friendly yet professional.  Definitely an asset to the restaurant.  The ambiance was good, nice vibe, good volume level, cool decor.  And, the booking was easy to do - booked reservation for 12 people via OpenTable - easy as pie.  :)

Now for the critical feedback: 1) table setup; 2) food.  The tables were arranged with 2 long, rectangular tables placed next to each other.  It provided a sort of square for everyone to sit around.  However, you couldn't talk to anyone aside from those on your immediate left or right without literally shouting.  It would have been SO much better had they just sat the 12 of us around 1 of those tables, or decided to go longer instead of wider.  Took away from the experience by not being able to talk to more than 1-2 people.

The food was not at all worth the price, and we tried many different things.  The biggest disappointment was the truffle mac&cheese - it was a joke.  It was like a soupy cream sauce poured over some elbow macaroni.  In addition to the lackluster look and texture, it was flavorless.  For what so many of us were excited about and ordered, it wasn't good at all.  My husband got the breaded pork chop which was also mediocre.  I asked if the chicken option was on the bone; the waiter explained it was, but that there was a delicious, special he could have made for me - chicken breast with leeks and butternut squash risotto.  I literally had 2 bites of the chicken and left the rest on the plate - it was gross.  I had a few bites of the risotto but that was it.  The filet was good, but even my friend who got the $85 lobster pot pie - the presentation was amazing, I must say - said it was average tasting.

We ended up spending approx $1200 on food and drinks, and just expected more.  Likely won't go back.",6wZAJTWpHzzh-I7heu6CQQ,1,0,2,_dfSRsyf0a1uQh5BM912uA

Outside the restaurant is a special $59 3-course tasting menu. This is a function of not enough customers, so restaurants are left competing for whoever is around. It looked good, and it's what we wanted.

We were given wine menus, a different tasting menu, and the regular menu. When we asked for the $59 menu, it was practically thrown at the table, only one copy was left, and it seems like service tanked from there.

We sat around for more than 15 minutes and during that time, no one came over to find out if we wanted anything to drink or if we were ready to order. We tried staring down various staff, even got some eye contact, but still no one came over to us. The restaurant was NOT busy.

We finally got up. There are lots of restaurants eager for business right now and if this wasn't one of them, we had other options.

As we were putting our coats on, they came over to find out what was up and got an earful. 

""Please let us make it up to you?!""

We sat back down.

Frankly, the only thing that improved was the staff suddenly became attentive and even a bit obsequious. Our dessert was included, but a glass of wine or SOMETHING by way of apology, would have been more meaningful  than just some words given how steamed I was.

I also did the wine pairings and frankly, with the exception of one choice, the pairings didn't much seem to relate to the food. 

I'm sure you can read the other reviews to find out about the food.

The decor of this posh spot did our fine city justice... polished wood, earthy tones, sparkling glass, black & white photos, and a wall-sized piece of art to jazz up the atmosphere.  We had reservations but they needed a moment to ""set up"" our table, so they ushered us into the lounge.  We were barely seated before the bartender came over to get us drinks while we waited.  We ordered a round and received them just as the hostess conveniently had our table ready... choreographed to perfection.

We were seated at our ""set up"" table... white linen and crystal among other equally ""set up"" vacant tables. They immediately brought out a selection of breads, which they placed on a heater in the middle of the table, and a variety of butters.  As we took a look at the wine list, we realized nothing was under a buck!  We settled on a half bottle and some appetizers- classic cheese fondue and heirloom salad.  The fondue was perfect but the heirlooms were a disappointment...  the natural flavor was wiped out with balsamic vinegar and cheese.  Yet, the menu looked promising... Michael Mina creations that intended to capture the taste of SF.  We each chose a main course- North Beach Cioppino, Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna, and Seared Duck Breast.  The cioppino was surprisingly delectable... big chunks of crab and mussels in a yummy tomato broth.  The tuna was eh... the sauce they used to compliment dulled out the fish.  The duck breast was pretty run of the mill... nothin' to yelp about.  We ordered another half bottle and enjoyed the quiet ambiance, some convo, and an after dinner drink.

On a recent stay in Vegas we were given a $50 dining credit to be spend on a ""Fine Dining"" restaurant in the MGM Grand.  We chose this restaurant because they had the broadest selection of food given the choices.

From the hostess stand outside, and the decor, it gives you the appearance of Fine Dining, but I'd have to say different parts of the experience don't say fine dining.   In my book to qualify for fine dining, music should be soft in the background and you shouldn't notice it it should just be a light soundtrack.   Music was a little loud and they played an electric selection.  Also to be fine dining, tables should be far enough spaced apart so you can talk in a normal inside voice and not hear your neighbors conversation and also be far enough away that you can make a graceful exit to the ladies room without bits of your body being in front of the people at the next table. Also, long sleeved flannel shirts shouldn't be allowed.

The waitress and serving staff were very professional, my water glass never got lower than half, and they didn't get that snooty ignore-you-attitude  because we didn't order alcohol.

Menu choices ranged from burgers to seafood to chops which was nice, there is something for just about everyone.

To start they bring you grilled bread that has been grilled on actual wood which was tasty, but we only got 2 pieces and we noticed the tables next to us (which are so close you can't help but notice what is going on) got a basket  full.  Luckily one of the servers came over right away and asked if we would like more.

For entrees I got the kurobuta pork chop which came with swiss chard and toasted farro salad.  My dining companion chose bacon wrapped scallops which came with sauteed vegetables and lentils.  I do not eat seafood, so I didn't taste the scallops, but they were larger, and my dining companion said they were delicious.  I got a taste of the vegetables that weren't near the scallops, and they were various shades of carrots sauteed in butter and they were good.  The lentils came out in a small iron crock which made it easy to share, unfortunately they were not share-worthy.  Basic plain, meh lentils with not much other flavor.

The pork chop was cooked over wood, nicely charred on the outside but juicy on the inside.  It was my first time with kurobuta pork and while it was nice and juicy, I can't say the flavor was any better than regular pork.  The swiss chard was braised and delicious and the toasted farro salad was really, really good.  I'd never had farro before but based on this I am now a big fan.

To cap off the night a delicious silky smooth maple creme brulee which had a nice maple flavor without being overpowering or artificial tasting.

On the way out, all the servers we had made a point to wish us a good night which I thought was nice.

I'd like to go back again, and perhaps try other dishes, I would have liked it better if we weren't packed in like sardines with tables being six inches away from each other, I was close enough to hold hands with the person next to me.

I wasn't sure I would be able to eat anything there but the manager ended up coming out and talking with me about the menu and giving me some suggestions on gluten free food items.

I decided to get a burger without the bun and french fries. I haven't had french fries in so long because most places cook them in the same fryer as other breaded items which then prevents me from having some.

The burger came out really fancy with some cole slaw on top and cheese. It was pretty fantastic.

The french fries were little skinny fries which were cooked really crispy (my favorite kind). I could only finish about half of the meal because the burger was really big and there were enough french fries for 2 or 3 people as an individual serving.

This is the only restaurant I felt funny after eating in the whole trip. I did get a bit of a stomach ache and had to run to the restroom at one of the night clubs we went to that night. It didn't ruin the night but put a little damper on the mood and really made me long for my pajama's and some tea while we were out partying. Thinking about it, it could have been the cole slaw depending on what they used to make the sauce.

I didn't get joint pain or a headache and I only had to use the restroom one time so I'm wondering if it was more a lactose issue or a gluten issue. Likely lactose since the problem resolved itself pretty quickly.

I'd say I'm indifferent to recommending this restaurant to you as a gluten free option. I think there were a few other places at MGM offering more knowledge and food options than the Nobhill Tavern. I give it a maybe ;)",aWoleC-dZWLcKPn3joeQ8w,2,1,4,gWnvwFM2ULGGZ0_yAfHhvQ

The beef cheek sliders were a little decieving, too small to be called sliders but rather pieces of meat on small crackers-not too bad in taste though. The fries came in a huge amount! They were obvioiusly cheap and used as fillers. And the last dish were the sausage weenies. Ok but tasted like a breakfast item.

After our food arrived and our drinks were served the guys behind the bar vanished. So that eliminates getting another drink right? I asked the bar-back cleaning and restocking if the restaurant was closed, hence all the hustle and bustle when we arrived, and he said ""No, the bar is open all night"". So we just went back to chatting and snacking and hoped to snag a bartender for another drink soon. 

But alas, when our bartender/server did show up again he informed us to ""eat quickly"" because the restaurant was now closed for half an hour! Wow!!!! So we asked for our check, tipped him appropriately for the work done, and left never to return.

Boo, I really expected better. And if I would have know that they were closing/closed I wouldn't have mosied on in expecting to relax over a drink and some food. I wish the hostess that seated us at the bar told us that......I didn't see any ""hours of operation"" signs when I left, but now I know better! I feel that overall our visit could have been handled differently and the server could have been nicer. I'm sure he figured that out too when he looked at the bill compared to his tip!",mBoHJmzVWvvV5EIBhkj0yg,1,1,2,nYHcXsZZqm9KiIx7e918QQ

Nothing really stuck out to me when I came here for dinner.  The service was slightly above average, which was quite disappointing in such a respectable establishment.  I also noted a slight air of arrogance among the servers, which I really did not understand nor appreciate -- so strange!  =/

Table service was hasty and sloppy.  While being poured wine, the server dripped a good amount on my arm and did not bother to apologize.  The service was just very lacking and not attentive.  Not all of the tables were even full so it couldn't have been because it was a busy night. 

For appetizers, we had the ahi tuna salad, the beer-battered shrimp, and the oysters.  The shrimp were pretty big and juicy and well-battered.  The other two appetizers were decent, but did not stand out.  I ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops, which were quite savory and fairly well prepared.  However, a couple of them were a tad overcooked.  I also tried the veal along with the halibut.  Both of these dishes seemed quite mediocre, like the appetizers.

Overall, the ""redeeming"" factor, I would have to say, would be the pricing of the dishes.  The entrees were in the general range from $20-35, which considering their presentation, is quite reasonable.  The portions were pretty good as well.

Service:  We had one of those servers who think nothing is more impressive than not writing down our orders.  I told him three times I wanted the little wedge salad with NO BACON.  When the salad came, it had bacon.  Of course.  Everything else we ordered arrived, and he came to check on us after we had finished.  We told him we never got our flatbread.  Obviously, he forgot to put it in, but instead of fessing up he told us it takes a long time because they make each one fresh.  So...does that mean everything else we got was just sitting around?  When the flatbread came a few minutes later, it wasn't even warm.  There was nothing about it that would have taken any longer than the rest of our order.

Food:  We ordered the beer battered shrimp, two lobster rolls, the little gem wedge salad, flatbread, and house made chips and dip.  The chips and dip came first, and were the best I've ever had - ah, we had such high hopes for Nobhill!  However, the shrimp were nothing special, and $8 for four pieces of shrimp is nuts if there is nothing special about them.  The lobster rolls had a weird fake-lemon taste, in a bad way.  The wedge salad came with four halves of grape tomatoes (so only two tomatoes total), three small pieces of bacon (that I didn't want), and three chunks of iceberg lettuce with a flavorless blue cheese dressing.  The flatbread was basically a cracker with a spinach/tomato topping.  It was all mediocre, the lobster rolls were actually on the bad side.  Everything was $8 for the late night menu, but the chips and dip were $5.

I couldn't take a second bite. The only word that comes to mind when I think of the sausages is NASTY. They were rubbery and had no flavor.

What we got was a top-flight dining experience at a pretty good price, thanks to the Summer Menu that the restaurant was offering.  Many restaurants will offer sub-par selections for something like this, but not Nob Hill.  We got a generous sampling of appetizers to start, which went well with our cocktails.  This was followed (for me) by a spicy pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon, mashed turnips, and a slice of pure heaven, known to some as pork belly.   It was crispy and buttery in all the right places, and was a delightful surprise when it was brought to the table.   Also a delight was the quintet of mashed potatoes brought to us from the kitchen - flavored with things like hearts of palm, horseradish, and other amazing flavors.

I've been three times.. First and second were a booze-filled business dinner, so I don't remember much other than having the short ribs, which were good.

Last time was my kid sister's birthday dinner and I had the kurobuta pork chops (I can't even remember if it was one or two), and as soon as I called the tab, the rest of the table (party of 5), ordered the lobster pot pie, LOL.  We ordered the charcuterie board, which I always get if I see it on a menu- great house pate and blood sausage; sliders, one was some sort of pulled pork with a jalapeno slice which was nice, shrimp, and some really tasty mini lobster rolls.. I'm pretty sure there were a few other things, but if I can't remember them, they probably weren't worth mentioning anyway.  My chops were tough :( , and the round of pot pie's made me jealous.  I copped a taste and I know I'm coming back for that next visit.  Desserts were chocolate cake, panna cotta, and some kind of passion fruit semifreddo- a seasonal special.  I do not have a sweet tooth, but the chocolate cake and panna cotta were great, I especially liked the kind of bitter chocolate ice cream that was served with the cake (as I don't like sweets all that much), but boy did that passion fruit semifreddo suck ass.  It tasted strange, not even like actual passion fruit, it was like a pineapple mango cough syrup semifreddo with splenda and it sat in a pool of something pinkish with some mint, and ugh, I don't even want to finish remembering what that was, but it made me want to scrub my tongue with 20 grit sandpaper dipped in vodka (yeah, that bad).  Before I forget, the bartender had a nice heavy hand and our server was attentive.  They've got a nice wine list.  Dinner was great.

I should say I don't like long walks to restaurants unless I'm outdoors.  That said, this is a long walk (so is everything in the MGM).  It's not ""sexy"", there aren't any abstract hanging glass ornaments or random neon purple lit anything here.  It's got this kind of up-cycled pub-meets-chicago law office look... Like you turned Baker & McKenzie's into a lounge- hardwood floors, glass and stone booths, and leather.

I would have given a 5, but that passion fruit dessert was totally inedible and my chop was tough (I gnawed through two bites and gave up... the server came by and offered to take it back- by the book.  I lied, saying it was fine... I was really almost full from the starters anyway).

We originally did not plan on dining here but after attending a time share meeting, we were give free vouchers for dining (it wasn't really free but the refunded portion of our money which we got back after attending the timeshare presentation with an additional $25) but were limited to whatever was on the list. After hearing so much about the lobster pot pie we decided we would splurge and made reservations for dinner

Now, everything was going fine up until our lobster pot pie finally came. Please note that this dish cost $85 bucks and that it mostly consists of lobster, sauce and very little pastry puff.

So the waiter brings our our lobster pot pie and splits it between us on two plates. I begin eating mine and half way through find that besides the small claw pieces, I could not chew through the larger lobster meat. How can any overcook a lobster and not expect to be fully refunded when it cost as much as it did?

Well, given that we had a show to attend that night, we could not wait for another one to be made and asked to speak to a manager. Once I explained how tough and over cooked the lobster meat was he did not seem particularly apologetic, although our waiter seemed to be. In the end they only took half the price of the lobster dish off the tab when in fact MOST of it was overdone and was inedible. For a place that charges this much and is owned by Michael MIna of San Francisco, you would expect a higher degree of service and accommodation. Instead, they still charged us half the price of the lobster, in addition to our side dishes which we had to eat on their own and were still left feeling quite hungry. We felt that it would have been proper to either take the entire lobster off the tab or at least come us for the side dishes which we no longer had an entree to go with. What was more irritating was that my husband booked this as an early anniversary and despite knowing this, when it came time to order dessert (again note that we had just complained about our lobster and just wanted to get our check and get out of there) they offered us a menu with dessert options and we had though this was going to be a complimentary gesture on their part for both messing up the lobster and because it was a special evening we were celebrating. Well, we were wrong, the dessert still showed up on our bill, despite having normally gotten a free dessert at other upscale dining places for our anniversary. It wasn't that we expected anything free but considering that they ruined a very special evening for us, it would have been a kind gesture to try and make things right.

We decided on the oysters, fried goat cheese salad, bacon wrapped scallops, braised short ribs, and a side of the truffle mac n cheese.
Service was prompt, and we got the salad and oysters inmediately. This was along with the delcious ciabatta bread that was perfectly browner but still a little doughy. The oysters were perfection, and I loved the bits of fried artichoke on top of the salad. After we finished, we received our entrees within minutes. The short ribs were perfectly tender and the scallops were amazing. I was pissed the bf got the scallops. They came with lentils cooked in bacon! Oh...my taste buds were in heaven. The mac and cheese was good, but I love gooey homemade mac and cheese so I have higher standards.
The portions are huge, and I couldn't come close to finishing half of what I ordered. Of course this doesn't mean I didn't save room for another drink and dessert.
Now anyone who knows me, knows I have the rule that everyone at the table gets a dessert, plus a community one (just for me) for everyone to share. But I was so full that we only got two.

4176825,2009-09-21,1,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Not sure where to begin other than ""wow"". Had a fantastic meal and great dining experience here Saturday night. MGM was insanely busy due to the fight so we made our reservations on the later side (8:15). Earlier in the day we were wandering around reading menus and decided on Nobhill, but they were not yet open. A server saw us poking around outside at the hostess booth and came out to inform us that the hostess was not in yet but he would leave her a message for us. He did exactly that and about 30 minutes later I received a call from the hostess confirming our reservation. We were off to a good start.

The meal: 
The service begins with thin slices of grilled bread and a small dish of olive oil accented with rosemary sprigs and a small clove of garlic. I saved my bread for dipping into all the yummy basil sauce that came with my entree.

I ordered the Alaskan halibut entree. The fish was perfectly cooked - flaky and silky inside with a slightly caramelized, crisped outside, and served in a beautifully light basil sauce. On the side was an extremely generous portion of ratatouille served in its own crock, which the server spooned on top of the fish as part of the presentation. This ratatouille was so delicious I could have had it as a meal on its own. The fish was accompanied on the plate by a breaded eggplant half that while delicious, seemed a bit superfluous given the amount of ratatouille provided.

My dining companion ordered the Prime Rib entree. He was extremely pleased with the meat, stating many times how perfectly cooked and tender it was. I sampled his mashed potatoes and vegetables. The potatoes were incredibly smooth, buttery and silky. The vegetables were well-seasoned and served in a generous portion with thick slices of zucchini, carrot, and baby corn. My normally veggie-phobic friend gushed that he would eat vegetables with every meal ""if they were all like this"".

For dessert we enjoyed the maple creme brulee. It was absolutely perfect in texture and flavor, with subtle hints of maple. It was garnished beautifully with cream and a large piece of almond roca candy. The dessert was creamy, sweet, cool, and the perfect ending to our meal.

The service was superior. I will not go into all the details, but the staff certainly exceeded our expectations. Yelp shows the price range as $$$$ but I would consider it more like a $$$. Other restaurants in MGM like Craftsteak and Joel Robuchon are far more expensive.

We wanted to do a nice dinner before heading to a show so we decided to try the Spring Tasting Menu. This included four course, beginning with the cheese fondue and Sourdough, which was delicious. It was a little puzzling because they also brought a basket of grilled rosemary bread and biscuits, I think it was a little overkill and would have simply been fine with the fondue and sourdough.

The next course was a greens salad with some amazing beets, a huge block of goat cheese sat in the middle. I thought this course was also very good - I loved the combination of the beets and goat cheese. However, again it was a little too much, and i left half of the block of goat cheese.

The third course was the short ribs - a huge chunk of meat. I have never really had short ribs like this. At first it tasted good with the bbq type sauce and puree (I also liked the pearl onions it came with) but it was again too much - also cutting into it - it had a flaccid unappealing look to it. I have definitely had much better short ribs (Try Huber Keller's Fleur de Lys)

The fourth course was bread pudding, my husband really liked it, I thought it was just ok. It had bananas, caramel and cream so of course it was good but it was a little too much like french toast for me.

Overall, the servers were friendly but the food took forever.  If I ever came back I would just order an entree because the tasting menu is way too much food - they need to downsize the portions from what they normally serve - and the entree was a little disappointing.",i1hm79umc0yMTSgmQAuB_g,0,0,3,A_ezVnaXA13CzM1jwHNuBQ

It's been years since I've been back to the bay area, so what better way to get a nostalgic fix than at a restaurant named after one of the  best neighborhoods in SF? After checking out all the other restaurants at the MGM, this one won my heart (afterall, I did leave it in San Francisco). 

Everything from the subtle ambience, food and service was impeccable. This was such a great restaurant that it was a shame to dine alone. But that didn't stop me from having a wonderful meal and indulging in being called ""Miss"" throughout the whole time. Vegas has got their service act together!

Culinary  Explorer's Guide to Picking Out a Restaurant in Vegas:

2. Choose a restaurant that reminds you something you love.

4241280,2011-02-04,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"The thing I like about NobHill Tavern is its late-nite happy hour menu. I'm one of those people who like to eat late: I don't usually get off work til after 10pm, and by then almost all the restaurants on the Strip have closed for the night. Mostly, your choices at that hour are coffee shops, which are fine, but... what if you want to nosh on something a little swankier? 

NobHill Tavern is a stylish little spot with a late nite happy hour menu from 10-midnight, with drink specials and appetizers/small plates for just $8 apiece. The apps include comfort food selections with a fancy Michael Mina twist, like lobster rolls, pork sliders, spare ribs and beer-battered shrimp. It's good late-night, stick-to-your-tibs-type fare that's great for either soaking up all those cocktails you just guzzled at regular happy hour, or for laying down a good base for all the cocktails you're ABOUT to drink at the nightclub.

I also really like the ambiance here: the lounge area (which serves the happy hour menu) is retro-swanky, with textured glass booths and a real Mad-Men vibe. It's the perfect place to have a drink or three and some old-school cocktails: retro favorites like the Moscow Mule and the Sidecar are on the happy hour menu, and make the perfect accompaniment to those sliders and lobster rolls. In fact, if you're into the whole Mad Men vibe, I recommend starting out with drinks over at the fabulously retro West Wing Bar, then heading down the hallway to NobHill for more drinks and apps.

The one thing I wish they had at NobHill (and West Wing Bar, too, for that matter) is a little jazz trio or something playing in the lounge. I'm a big fan of hanging out in lounges to booze & talk, but it seems like most lounges in Vegas these days are so LOUD that you can't carry on a conversation. A little jazz would be just the thing to complement the swanky vibe at NobHill and make it an even better place to hang out in the later half of the evening, while you either wind down or get revved up for the night ahead. 

P.S. I have also had occasion to try NobHill's Kobe burger, which is not on the happy hour menu...but is freaking DELICIOUS and also highly recommended!",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,3,3,5,eytTdEVWwNdsnn031d_rOA

Order Scottish Salmon and was surprised they asked how I liked it- medium or medium well. Hmmm, how would I like me salmon?!? Asked for it well and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. Just like red meat, it was cooked at the right temperature where it was soft and not overly dry. I was thrown off and can't say it was great, but my friends loved it very much. The balsamic rice was alright, pretty typical. But the eggplant was cook just as perrrfectly as the salmon. It was not mushy or still hard, right in between of both.

My friend had the Maine Lobster Pot Pie and don't be fooled as I was, it is much better than I imagine. It came out in its entirely- as in the pot still. The process is great, the server cuts the top off and reconstructs the lobster to the plate again. So your entree looks like a real dish and not just a pot pie. And for $85 it is well worth the money. And actually enough to not have to share. =)

We also ordered American Kobe Burgers and that was tasty. The glazed grilled onions were somewhat sweet and compliemented the dressing well. However the fries were not good. Way Toooo Much Salt. It seemed as though they threw in the whole salt container. That was a disappointment. How can a nice establishment mess up on French fries!
The Truffle Mac and Cheese is pretty good too. Not overly cheesy too. The top layer is salty as well. So to prevent the need to drink a gallon of water avoid the top.

Our show was at 9:30 and our reservations were at 7:45 giving us plenty of time to relax ... or so I thought.

The restaurant decor was very nice and the host told us right away that it was quite busy and that our table wasn't ready.  We waited about 15 minutes and the hostess gave us 3 glasses of complimentary champagne, which was a nice gesture given the wait.

We finally got seated and ordered a bottle of sumptous Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc and the rest of the wine list looked good.  We shared a small appetizer of truffle mac and cheese and one of my companions remarked that it was the best he's ever tasted. 

We ordered two chicken and dumplings and I ordered the seafood cioppino.  This was at about 8:10PM and there were a lot of large groups because of the tradeshow we were attending.  We had informed the waitress that we had KA tickets and that we had to be at the show on time at 9:30.  Then the waiting started.  At about 9:00PM, the manager came by to let us know ours were coming out in a few minutes.  Then another 15 minutes went by and finally our food arrived at 9:15 giving us 10-12 minutes to eat.  

I scarfed down my ciopinno and the fish was done well, rare in the center for tuna and well done for the salmon.  The scallop was a bit undercooked but the problem was the tomato broth that severely underseasoned and lacked in robustness.  This was especially needed since the seafood was not very seasoned so the dish tasted slightly bland.  My companions remarked the chicken was good but the dumplings were unevenly salted with some bites saltier than others.

Food 5 stars 

Complimentary San Francisco Sourdough- The large loaf of bread was cut into large pieces and cooked in olive oil. My parents said it tasted great, but I was saving room for my entree. 

1. Chicken and dumplings- My dad was very bold to go for this item and he succeeded. He said it was the best piece of chicken he had ever tasted, and he talked about throughout the whole weekend. He said the chicken was very tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. It was flavored just to his liking. He even like the gnocchi which was surprising, because he usually doesn't. It even came with a small side of creamed broccoli and carrots which complimented the dish very well. 

2. Striped bass- Good thing I didn't get the same reaction as I would get when I eat sea bass. I always get a stomach discomfort every time I eat sea bass, so I was I glad I left with a happy tummy. The fish was cooked so soft and without a fishy smell there usually is in striped bass. It came with a side of beans which I usually hate, but now I love. I guess there is always a time to try something new. 

3. Salmon- It looked absolutely beautiful. It was a thick and square piece of fish and lightly pink in the center. It's texture was cooked perfectly and it wasn't rare. My mom cooks the best piece of salmon in the world and she said that it tasted great. Unfortunately I didn't get a bite. 

4. Brussels Sprouts- I wouldn't order this again the next time I come back. Way to much fatty bacon and oil in this dish. Good thing the entrees were very pleasant.",UyLlO1HNrr0XSvSa6Ea9CA,2,1,5,OyMv5W5lmLEkT9NY6j8VkA

Located just off the casino floor in the MGM Grand, Nobhill Tavern is the lovechild of a traditional Scottish tavern and a modern New American New York restaurant. The inside is all dark wood, lantern light, and textured glass with semi-private booths just off the bar, providing intimacy but not isolation.

I was practically giddy after reading the extensive specialty cocktail list--my favorite Moscow Mule (vodka, ginger beer, lime) with plenty of other creative and not gooey sweet drinks. My boyfriend adored the Scottish Aperitif (Hendrick's gin, Lagavulin single-malt, dry vermouth, blue cheese olives served with a side of scotch). Nice Vegas restaurants usually push wine, and they had a good list, but Nobhill did not disappoint liquor drinkers like me.

And the food, oh Lordy, the food. From a classic Caesar with house-made dressing to the truffle mac and cheese to the absurdly delicious bread pudding, the food at Nobhill made me consider moving to Las Vegas and living by their dumpster just to get daily leftovers. I ordered the chicken tetrazzini, even though I'm not usually a chicken-lover, and it was the best chicken I've ever had in my life--moist, flavorful, and with the perfect crunchy outside. My boyfriend had the Kobe burger that came with a cone of fresh, hot french fries. Oh--and try the Market Salad just for the pumpkinseed brittle!

Honestly, I was expecting more from a Michael Mina restaurant.  The best part of the meal was my salmon, a very important part, but I thought everything would be outstanding.

My boyfriend had the bacon wrapped scallops served with lentils and carrots, really I could have made this at home.  The scallops tasted like a beginner had cooked them.  There was absolutely nothing stand out about this dish.

I had the pre-fixe menu which starts off with cheese fondue to share.  I had the market salad with beets and goat cheese with a citrus vinaigrette.  The dressing was too citrus-y and overpowering.  My salmon on the other hand was amazing.  I normally don't order salmon at restaurants, but this was what caught my eye.  I had it prepared medium rare and it was pan sauteed and then roasted for a crispy outside.  It was served with shitake mushrooms and white asparagus with a mushroom emulsion.

For dessert we ordered the bread pudding with caramel pecan ice cream.  It was ok.  I like my bread pudding to have some texture and not just be mush.  It needed way more ice cream than it came with. 

Service was standard, nothing special.  Wine list is WAY WAY overpriced.  A glass of Chalone Pinot Noir costs $17 and I know that whole bottle costs like $14.

The food itself was yummy!  Make sure that someone in your party gets the Lobster Pot Pie. The presentation and the actual dish itself was amazing. Most of the sides were really great.  

Our only downfall was dessert.  We were not happy with any of the desserts, which is a definite ""no no"" for a group of women.  We tried several and we were bummed because the food was so good.

Our table for two had one of us against the wall and the other in a chair.  Clearly standard, but the extra long table was not.  We were so far away from each other that we could barely converse.  The couple next to us had actually turned their table and were sitting next to each other against the wall to combat this issue.  

Our service was AWFUL.  The waiter barely checked in on us and when we asked him questions about the menu he provided little additional detail and was actually fairly aloof.

The food was actually worse than the table and the waiter.  I had the short rib and it was completely charred.  So overdone that I couldn't get down more than 5 bites.  When I informed the waiter how poor it was he said that they could offer us a free dessert.  Somehow at the end of a terrible meal the last thing I want is more food from you!

My husband had the lobster pot pie, which was decent but not nearly as good as you would expect for a signature dish at a restaurant of this price point.  We also tried the horseradish whipped potatoes, which I did not enjoy but that may just be due to heavy horseradish more than a universal issue.  We also had the lobster rolls and cheese fondue, which were both good.  We saw many other diners eating the Kobe burger and fries entree.  We would clearly never go back here, but I would recommend other diners stick to the less expensive and more basic options, as they seem to be more successful.",dBtv_J4bD0WG62ZZD8mu4Q,1,0,1,8DehQ_R22-pgFgjr6ufm6A

The world needs more bartenders like these guys. You know what I'm talking about... the kind of guys who actually seem to enjoy chatting you up, making special concoctions and even letting you sample little tastes of things they've created.

We enjoyed our appetizers and drinks so much, we ended up returning the next day for pre l'Atelier drinks. 

First night: we had the truffle mac n' cheese (cliche but awesome), the beer battered shrimp (more of a perfect tempura than a beer batter) and the crispy Korean chicken wings (great sauce!).

On the second night we stuck with cocktails... BTW, these guys make the most perfect martini (icy, slightly citrusy and just enough vermouth). 

The ambiance of the restaurant and bar is perfect. It's dark and you'll quickly forget you're just steps from the hustle and bustle of the casino.

we had the summer tasting menu, which was the economical choice at under $100 for appetizers/entree/dessert. the appetizer sampler offered us delicious beef skewers, yummy crab crostini balls and this foie gras spring roll (too bad i hate spring rolls, i thought it was a waste of foie). the crispy chicken was up next, with some of the best (truffled) mac&cheese i've had in my life. the meat was oh-so-juicy and the skin was crisp and delicious. i rounded out the night with the strawberry salad. let me just say that candied pistachio nuts are a total win in my book. i didn't particularly like the creme fraiche. while it had my familiar pinkberry tang, the consistency was denser and less cold than i would have liked.

We rolled out of ""KA"" at the MGM, and began walking the restaurants to see which menu spoke to us. My girlfriend and I decided that a lobster pot pie from Michael Mina was a MUST.

The hostess informed us that the restaurant was full, but we could sit in the bar with dinner service. This was really our lucky night... as that's where the coolest bartender (Tim) is stationed!

We nabbed the best table, where we were able to see the action in the bar, as well as watch the bustle of the casino. SWEET! Fortunately, our dinner matched our view.

Appetizer:

- Charcuterie tasting plate for 2: an Atkins designed plate of tasty meats, mustard and tiny addicting pickles. There were also the most heavenly pieces of toasted warm bread to use... which were out of this world.

Dinner:

- Maine Lobster Pot Pie: This is the show stopper people! I wasn't sure what to expect, but when they wheeled out the ""Shrek-sized"" pot, I almost fell off my chair! This is almost a deconstructed pot pie, as they slice off the top, lay it on the plate then pile the ingredients on top. The lobster tail is in the shell, sliced into pieces. They artfully reassemble it on the plate with the tasty veggies. Worth every penny of the $90.00 price tag. It was practically the meal AND the entertainment!

- Bacon Wrapped Scallops: cooked to perfection, and delish. The apple strings on top make the dish. They held their own to the lobster, but just weren't as cool on the presentation.

And if all of this sweet chow wasn't enough? Our prince of a bartender was making himself busy, bringing us his recommended concoctions. Their signature ""Cable Car"" martini was one the the best cocktails I've ever experienced. Seriously, it had carmelized sugar around the ring!!

Upon walking in, I noticed they have super cute booths across from the bar, perfect for couples or parties of 4. The main dining area didn't look anything spectacular. Dim lighting on hardwood floors, big tables were round. Good for big and smaller parties. 

We ordered the bbq puled pork finger sandwich for appetiser that comes in 3s. $10. They somehow charged us $19 for 5. doesn't make too much sense. we could've just gotten 6 for $20....
The pellegrino sparkling water also came to $8 a bottle, $4 per person for one SMALL CUP. meh!  

I shared the lobster pot pie. It looked HUGE when it arrived. but don't let this deceive you, it's quite a bit for one, but to share, it wasn't really that much. In that big pot, you only get a layer of pastry, which was somewhat filling, but the lobster was at max 3lbs. I only got like 3 pieces of meat shared. That for $85? I could've gotten 3X that amount at newport tan clan, same freshness. Indeed it was fresh, and baked to perfection. There wasn't an overload on dressing so the lobster was refreshing with the right amount of crunch. Everything was cut and easy to eat with knife and fork. Came with minimal vegetables, some mushrooms and spinach. It was still not $40 worth shared

I tried some of my friend's ribs which was topped with corn and veggies, I believe her entree was $39? Tender, but nothing spectacular.
Service was nothing special. I didn't feel any one of them was extra nice or eloquent even. I expected more from a Michael Mina restaurant.

Tip: Everyone praises the lobster pot pie, ask for market price but it should range 80-90. They split your card 4-way max.

Favourites: Fresh lobster

Do not want: No spectacular dish. Lobster was small

4741081,2009-03-10,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"I had a wonderful experience. We came here for our final ladies dinner in Vegas. I made reservations about a week ago and told them that there would be 5 of us including a 4 year old little boy. I also asked them if they had mac and cheese b/c it is pretty much the only thing that he eats. Everything about this meal was amazing, from the food to the music playing in the dining room. 

We walked in and they had our table ready. The little guy wasn't feeling well so we asked if we could move to a bench. No problem, the said it would just be a few minutes to put the table together. We were brought back to the table and right away the waiter told us he would get the Mac and Cheese started. I was WOWed! We didn't even say anything to them when we walked in. I just mentioned that he only ate Mac and Cheese when making the reservations. 

The waiter handed us our menus which was the regular menu and the wine menu. I then asked the waiter for the tasting menu outside. He said oh yes, and handed us those menus. We already had a plan to order the WHOLE tasting menu. There were for of us and 4 options for each course so it worked out perfectly. I told the waiter that we wanted to try it all and he said no problem they will bring it out so we can eat family style. OOOO BOY!!! Just what we like.... 

First Course from best to wost: 
Bacon-Wrapped Scallop Fritter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=_NlTafDD7uLd6gRzPIkleQ: This was melt in your mouth AMAZING.. So tasty and the texture was so good. If you come for the tasting option get this dish. 

Heirloom Beet Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=KX4KSRTvxVVrBy1oOqDN8Q): I love beets and these were nice and sweet. My mother is allergic to all pork dishes and dairy. We made sure to let him know this beforehand so he made sure to put those items on the side of the dish when possible. This was really good to eat together: Beets, cheese and prosciutto. 

Bigeye Tuna Niçoise (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=oSmdpwXBzEuMDQuSJKvj5A): Good.. it was sort of like a sashimi salad with a quail egg and beans. The sashimi was good my mother even tried it and the salad was tasty and light. 

Caramelized Sunchoke Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=lHbkubQGbjX8_niryjXGDA): This was my least favorite of all the first course items. I'm not sure what it was but I think the flavor was a little bland. Maybe I just don't like Sunchoke b/c I know I've never had it before. It comes out with the bacon on the bottom of the bowl and then they pour the soup on top. Even though it was fancy.. it was definitely my least favorite. 

Main Course: The first three courses were pretty much tied for first. They were all good. 

Prime Short Rib (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=9uJyWg7AOer4yetkKXUx1A) :  Wow talk about melt in your mouth. The meat was so tender and the BBQ sauce was very delicious! 

Sonoma Chicken Tetrazzi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=Taii1V9r0z34E355lK8ISA): This was really good. The chicken was very tender and the truffle Mac n Cheese mouth watering amazing. I had tried my cousin's baby's Mac n Cheese and thought that one was good.. but this one was great. The truffle flavor really showed through but wasn't over powering. 

North Beach Cioppino (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=g2puWLYc47qvruxayKa3Rw): This came out in a way similar to the soup. They seafood was on the dish and they poured the tomato sauce on top. All of the seafood was cooked to perfection. Everything tender but nothing fell apart.  

Tasmanian Ocean Trout (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=Taii1V9r0z34E355lK8ISA): This was our least favorite of the main dishes. The trout pretty much just tasted like Salmon to me. The sides weren't that memorable either.... Get one of the other three dishes if you come for the tasting. 

Final Course:

Apple Cobbler (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=0LUc6s5FPw8wXMA4J83_gg): This was very yummie and wasn't in the normal ramekin. It was sort of constructed on the plate with some Brown Sugar ice cream. YUM! I think I liked this one b/c of the nuts. I love apples and nuts!

Citrus Tasting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=8tF-gQNbYJPXq9FLM3RjJg) It was sort of a free standing orange souffle. But a little better b/c the outside has a little bit of a crunch. 

Trio of Artisan Cheese (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=3IQdcOoBxDTKz1nU88PK8g): This came with a fruit/nut bread. It was good w/ the wine! 

Coconut Candy Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw?select=OD8VBn_7mGNChfyHSzMacw) Our least favorite dessert. I think its b/c we're not big coconut fans... it's also a bit rich. Go with the Citrus Tasting.. Much better!",3jyJ7VIRuKiZDr6WwAvovg,0,0,5,samPOncQt6pfWyPLBb9d9w
4772760,2011-06-14,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Damn that was a great meal. Nobhill capped off a fantastic Vegas trip and I was really, really impressed. The service was incredible, the restaurant beautiful and the food...all sorts of amazing. For those who say it's expensive - well, it is, so be prepared for that in advance. 

If you're in the mood for a drinky, Nobhill has a great wine list and a very creative cocktail list too. While hubs went for some oysters to start, I held back so I could fully dig into my entree...the lobster pot pie. While I was a bit skeptical that it would be ""that good,"" it was. Every last bite of it. Even the presentation is pretty fab - the server cuts off the top of the flaky pot pie, places in another dishes and ladles all of the lobster-y goodness on top. 

A few things to consider about this dish: 1) it's damn pricey (my market price was $85 at the end of May), 2) it's totally shareable, even if you're hungry 3) you really do get a *lot* of lobster. Consider points two and three, I felt ok about the price. Would I pop in and order it every week? Hell no. I'd be broke. But it's an incredible indulgence and it's creamy, fresh and delicious. 

To finish off the meal, I chose the chocolate tart with salted caramel peanut brittle and Guinness chocolate ice cream. The tart was rich perfection - the perfect consistency, and the peanut brittle was swoon worthy. The only item I pushed aside was the Guinness ice cream, I didn't feel like it went with the dish and wasn't a huge fan of the taste or texture. Suffice it to say, though, I had no problem cracking into that chocolate tart. 

Next time I'm in Vegas I will absolutely go back to Nobhill for another great dinner and perhaps one more helping of that lobster pot pie.",qlC607Cyp0Mj91vDFvkp3Q,2,0,5,rY3LRuMiGyR_h4300SkkVg

Charcuterie Sampler:  The selection of dried meats were good but the pate was the star of the night.  I love pate so this was literally a no-brainer.  I could eat their pate everyday for the rest of my life.  

NY Strip:  Cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Juicy, bloody, tender, and full of flavor.

Duck Fat Fries:  To be honest I really couldn't tell the difference between fries cooked in duck fat compared to fries cooked with regular oil.  They were good though.

Truffle Mac and Cheese:  Paired awesome with the broccoli and had a nice hint of truffle flavor to it.

Brussels Sprouts:  I'm a brussels sprouts whore so this was another no-brainer dish for me.  Delicious.

We got the fondue appetizer, chicken tetrazini with truffle mac and cheese, and a desert sampler. The fondue and the chicken were a bit too salty for my taste but the bread served before our meal was A-FREAKING-mazing!

I've been looking forward to trying this place for a long time. I like the idea of eating semi-upscale food in a semi-downscale/comfortable environment. 

A friend and I arrived around 7:00 on a Tuesday with no reservations and were seated right away. She's a fish-loving pescetarian and I'm a fish-hating carnivore, yet we were somehow able to agree on a few things to share as well as our own entrees. After perusing the menu for a good 5 minutes, we both gasped simultaneously. ""Tomato Fondue"". We were definitely getting that. After a bit of back and forth, we decided to order the asparagus salad, crab & lobster rolls (for her) and a Kobe burger (for me). I was surprised & relieved to learn that the Kobe burger already included fries. 

We ordered our first round of cocktails. Hers was a somewhat forgettable cucumber...thing. I hesitantly ordered a cable car, having never had one before. It was divine and when it came time for round two, that's what both of us got. We shamelessly licked the cinnamon sugar off of the glass rims (thanks in part to the way each booth is extremely secluded). 

The tomato fondue arrived...grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup. And not even the best tomato soup (but the sandwich was pretty good), and fairly difficult to eat to boot. My friend kept saying ""I think he forgot our asparagus"", but I had faith. A different server brought out our lobster/crab rolls and burger. When I asked for ranch to go with the fries, he seemed a bit taken aback. I know this is kinda an upscale joint, but what makes the ramekin of ketchup that came with the fries any better? He said he'd look around, and luckily, he was able to find some. Speaking of the fries, they were lackluster. I know they're just fries, but people are doing all sorts of fun things with them these days. I'm not asking for them to be fried in duck fat or anything, but it would've been nice if they looked fresh cut rather than completely indiscernible from McDonald's fries. Or some parsley maybe. Work with me here, Michael Mina. The Kobe burger was delicious and perfectly cooked, however, and the small bite I tried of my friend's dish wasn't so bad (which coming from this seafood-hater means that it was pretty brilliant). As we were eating our main courses, a basket of bread with some olive oil arrived. Very curious. 

The asparagus still hadn't arrived, so we reminded our server. We asked that the speck be served on the side, as my friend doesn't eat meat. It arrived about 10 minutes later, speckled with speck. We hate sending stuff back. No, really, we do. She is a server and I am a pushover, so we accept quite a bit more than the average diner. We were not about to spend 15 dollars on 9 asparagus spears that she couldn't even eat though. When it arrived another 10 minutes later, it was delicious. 

$125 + a not-super-generous tip later, we were at least able to walk away with full bellies, which doesn't always happen at these fancy schmancy places. 

And this, ladies and gentleman, is why I've waited so long to write my first review. I don't know how to STFU.",3ZmS3VXGb5GEXV1Lt1FJZQ,0,0,3,F2N9f9ebg8PMSEUovj39HA
4813898,2007-07-17,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Nobhill is definitely a cool place to go. Michael Mina's got a good thing going here. However some of the dishes I found really salty. It was cool because it was last minute and I was ready to get my grub on. But sitting down and being used to eating anything that fits in a small bowl, the food was very filling. As an employee special I was able to get a Chef's tasting menu. It was ok. I was actually expecting more, but for what it is, it isn't bad. The staff was very friendly, it's casual friendly walking in. Dress code - no flip flops - no hats. 
Bread was brought to the table, a walnut bread, classic sourdough, and olive loaf. It was accompanied by a creamed butter, a roasted red pepper butter, and a toasted coconut butter. The trio was definitely excellent. The appetizers came with a vengence. Ok I got cheesed out on the classic cheese fondue with San Fransisco sourdough. Very good flavors. The cheese started burning though...There was a garlic clove that I devoured and a fresh bay leaf in the fondue pot. Very traditional and tasty. The roasted yello bell pepper soup was delicious with it's langosteen pieces. They don't tell you that in the menu. But definitely one of the best soups I've had. The crme fraische was subtle and it cut on the salt. The filet of beef was good. It was kobe. Thinkin American. Very tender. Shallot potato cakes came in a trio, one with grilled asparagus another with looked like trumpet mushrooms, and finally greens. Not sure what kind though. I had the cioppino. It came with clams, mussels, crab, shrimp, salmon, and sea bass. Then they pour this tomato broth over it. Different from any cioppino I've had. But it was a huge dish. Lots of pieces of fish. They also had a diver scallop in it cooked to perfection. 
A tasting of creamed potatoes accompanied both dishes. - YEP tiny portions but really I was full already. There was traditional mashed potatoes(eh a lil salty for my taste), wasabi(a lil sweet with some heat), horseradish(WHOA way too strong), sour cream and chives(Yums), bacon and cheddar(Mmm) but I'm kinda dieting right now...
Desert came in a trio of strawberries with sorbet and a basalmic reduction. The strawberry slices were the sweetest I've ever had. The raspberry cheesecake was tastey. Not too sweet. Thick crust and great raspberry puree. There was a molten chocolate cake which is starting to be a staple of zzzz....only because really....WHO DOESN'T HAVE MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE...or LAVA CAKE? But whatever, please the tourists. The chocolate was a little bitter. Not too sweet. Eh. It wasn't my favorite. The first two definitely got a devouring from me. 
It's a tough call with this place. I don't think it deserves 5 stars. Maybe 3.5 cuz of the saltiness of some dishes. Not too consistant. But I'll probably round this one up to 4.",UvY0E6Wuhv_0Bita52RPOw,0,0,4,p8NQi4sHcSkquxUAcT2B8Q

WOW!

That's the word for this evening. 

WOW!

We had been here before, for happy hour, every Tuesday-Friday, all night long! And we had enjoyed it immensely, altho the HH cocktails were rather short on substance. (I'd order one or two HH cocktails, then one off the menu for the fun of it.)

This time, tho, spouse and I came here to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of our official ""commitment"". (You see, we can't legally marry in this country, or at least in this state.) We had spent anniversary 32 and 31 in very pathetic circumstances (new to Vegas, too poor to splurge, etc). BUT THIS EVENING MADE UP FOR THOSE BAD ANNIVERSARIES!

What we had.

Cocktails: I had the La Louisanne, spouse had the Not Your Old Fashioned. Both outstanding.

Opener: We shared two dishes. The Housemade Pate, which was excellent. (Not too gamey, perfect balance.) Also the Shaved Octopus & Calamari, which turned out to be a ceviche. Incredibly light & refreshing.

Mains: I went with 2 appetizers. First, the Seared Foie Gras w/ ""seasonal accompaniment"", this time I believe gooseberries, which as the best Foie I've had since I moved here 2.25 years ago. Then came the Grilled Quail Valley Quail w/ pickled pumpkin, brown butter & spiced pumpkin seeds. Every bite was perfection for me. I was paired by the somm with a Tokaji 5 Puttonyos for the Foie, an Albrecht Rose for the quail. Both great choices. Spouse went with the Phyllo-Crusted ""Fish & Chips"" w/ malt vinegar butter, brandade, russet crisps and an egg on top! This dish was a revelation. It was 2 sole fillets (yes, this was a BIG portion of food), they were SO beautifully cooked, I was severely jealous! And that brandade, OMG. They don't offer that as a ""side"", but they should, it's incredible, tons of chunks of cod strewn throughout the mashed potatoes. The best fish & chips (albeit unorthodox) spouse had ever had, and he's been to many great chip shops in England. The somm suggested 2 half-glasses of Chardonnay (can you believe that, they charged for only 1 glass of wine, even tho he got 2 tastings!), as that's what spouse thought would pair nicely. Well, the Talbott Sleepy Hollow didn't really work, a bit too oaky, but the William Fevre Chablis was GENIUS with this dish.

Sides: We got a side of Duck Fat Fries, because we wanted to try them, and I didn't have a starch. WOW! (There's that word again!) But a HUGE portion, you need at least 3 people to finish them. We also got the Brussel Sprouts w/ Hobb's Bacon. Delicious.

Dessert: We ordered the pain perdue w/ apples, pear, applesauce & hibiscus leaves. Perfect ending. Not too heavy, not too light, just right.

This was one of the best meals we've had in Las Vegas since moving here 2.25 years ago.

AND YET THEY'RE CLOSING, MARCH 30 2013!

FOREVER!

NO MORE FINE DINING FROM MICHAEL MINA IN THE MGM GRAND!

Our advice: GO! NOW!

PS We actually came to share their legendary Maine Lobster Pot Pie w/ Baby Vegetables & Truffle Cream, but at $84 we were hesitant at the beginning of the evening. But NOW, since we ate so many fantastic dishes in one evening, we want to return with 2 more people and share one of those puppies. But we have yet to find any takers. :(",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,2,1,5,rBcSSYOg7rtjw9f2dIDVHw
4824279,2013-02-03,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"I came here with some coworkers earlier this week for a team dinner, and I had a blast. Here's a recollection of my thoughts:

Pros:
+ Ambiance is very nice. Very romantic setting. 
+Staff is very nice! Loved the host who walked us to the table, the waiter was very amicable and helpful, and the sommelier was also very helpful and friendly.
+The bread basket consisted of really yummy fresh breads. I particularly liked the cheesy bun.
+I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. Really good fresh lobster, great creamy sauce, nice presentation
+They had vegetarian options, including a non-menu item. They can cook something up for you if you are a non-meat eater.
+Bone marrow was deliciously juicy
+Skirt steak was really good too, although the coworker who ordered it thought that it was a little too salty
+Great wine selection, and if you aren't too familiar with wines, the sommelier is very friendly and will walk you through the menu and make suggestions.

Cons:
- Nothing",6JOD7pAVHb3oC7gYWuOLkA,1,0,4,1QcQEpWuUFM9SQ2HkEZ8dw
4827118,2011-03-01,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"After a concert at the MGM one night, I couldn't help but catch the Happy Hour menu for Nobhill Tavern. The prices were reasonable, the food items looked good, and my fiancée and I were feeling like a snack. Seeing the Michael Mina name on the restaurant piqued our interests even more, so we decided to grab a seat by the bar.

We looked at the menu, and immediately noticed the lobster rolls and the BBQ pork sliders, so we ordered both, and within a matter of minutes, we were presented with the lobster rolls, which were served on a little carving board rather than a plate -- a nice touch, though completely cosmetic. And after one bite of those rolls, we were completely sold on the restaurant.

Those tiny, bite-sized lobster rolls were everything I could ever hope for in a lobster roll. The roll itself was soft and buttery with a light crust, and the lobster itself was light and flaky, capturing the full flavor of the lobster without being rubbery in any way. They were topped with a dash of fresh herbs that added a terrific, herbaceous bite on top of the buttery roll and the lobster meat, which was surprisingly light considering it was tossed in dressing. While eating them, we could not stop raving about these rolls, and the BBQ pork sliders hadn't even shown up yet! Even before finishing the snack, we were already talking about placing another order for the lobster rolls.

And that's when another order of lobster rolls magically appeared on our table. Only thing was that we hadn't asked for a second order, and there was still no sign of the sliders. We explained it to our server, who was deeply sorry for the mix-up, and was able to get us our order of BBQ pork sliders within minutes of explaining things to her. To our surprise, she also let us know that we could keep the extra plate of lobster rolls that we were served as her treat, and that the BBQ pork sliders would be taken off the bill. Call it telepathy or call it excellent service, but I call it an excellent way to end a Saturday night.

The BBQ pork sliders were delicious as well, as the pork was perfectly shredded and served in a tangy BBQ sauce, topped with cheddar for richness and a slice of red chili for an added bite. But the night was all about that lobster roll, which my fiancée and I have continued to rave about months after our visit. It was easily the best single bite of food we had on the trip, and I'm sure we'll be making a trip back to the restaurant on our next Vegas endeavor.",GKvNaZsjY46086gsVslf3A,0,0,5,dcM3QS81MvX_fJS4kxwDSA
4900416,2011-06-09,2,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!  There are two standout dishes that I've ordered on separate occasions. 

1) The fork tender Braised Short Ribs.  They frequently change up the accompaniments... on one occasion, they sat on a bed of whipped potatoes w/ a medley of green beans, corn, peas, and carrots.  On another occasion, it was topped with Foie Gras... it was like a picnic in my mouth.  It floats atop a savory broth of pasta pearls.  The Foie Gras was perfectly pan seared, Short Ribs brilliantly braised, and the pearls are textured to the tasting.

2) The Maine Lobster Pot Pie is the other notable dish.  At ""market price"" (usually around $85+), this dish comes wheeled out by a waiter.  It's set in a medium copper pot shrooming with a golden brown crust topping.  The server breaks the pastry, and then serves the creamy goodness onto your plate.  In addition to the whole 2 lb lobster meat, there's also fingerling potatoes, carrots, green beans and truffle cream.  To die for!  It's a very hearty meal.  Big enough for two to share.  

In addition, don't forget to order a side of the truffles mac n' cheese.  They use corkscrew shaped pasta as opposed to an elbow pasta.  The truffle flavor was evident but not overwhelmingly so. The porcini mushrooms added a subtle earthy flavor to this dish.",0_flT2OUiuHe7OAdRVVrdQ,6,4,5,tiIrN8cOKuWE_sVWdiJ7OQ

4972426,2010-03-18,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Everything on the menu sounded amazing, but I ended up with the pork chop and it was delicious.  The pork was juicy and tender and the jus was just concentrated flavor.  The Swiss chard was cooked just right and mixed with the salty chunks of bacon tasted beyond anything I expected.  The toasted farro salad offered just the right complement, mild but still tasty and hearty enough to stand up to the other strong flavors on the plate.  The farro is served in a fun little metal pot and spooned by the server onto your plate at the table.  The dish is very generous as far as portions go, too, I took half of it home with me.  

My friend said she enjoyed the salmon as well.  My other friend got the Kobe beef burger and it was good though very tall, which made eating it a tad difficult.  It came with a giant cone of fries in a stand.  The fries were perfectly done, golden, crispy, and flavorful; they were cut fast-food style but so much better.

We were seated near the bread prep station which was fun to watch and got me looking forward to our bread basket.  It came with three kinds of bread (mm the focaccia) and a great garlic olive oil.

We walked in around 9:30 on a Saturday night and were seated immediately.  The staff were totally accommodating, even when half our party failed to show up.  They just shrunk our table (at our preference).  Only quibble was a little bit of a long wait for our check after we were done, but only noticeable due to the otherwise impeccable experience and because we were in a hurry (after having waited for the rest of the party for so long).

5016253,2010-12-06,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"Meh.  Nobhill Tavern wasn't what I hoped it would be.  Another Michael Mina disappointment. My boyfriend didn't think it was that great either.

For starters, my boyfriend ordered the classic french onion soup which was served with gruyere grilled cheese on the side.  The soup was pretty good and the mini grilled cheese sandwiches were a nice touch.  I had a salad, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was or if was good.  Apparently not.   

For dinner my boyfriend ordered the grilled beef short rib entree.  I ordered the kurobuta pork chop which braised swiss chard.  My pork chop was really good, but the short rib was very disappointing.  It wasn't tender at all.  Definitely not worth $29.

I haven't been to Michael Mina in SF, I hear it is amazing.  Unfortunately, I'm hesitant to go there after my disappointing experiences at Nobhill Tavern and Arcadia.",mmgiD9RKnAasJorjSqmpNA,1,0,3,05iDjwROWX0JGRa88__vtw

Cheeseburger sliders - Juicy patty. Good flavor
Crispy Korean BBQ Wings - Proly my favorite thing. Great crunch on the wing (they brine the wings for a substantial amount of time ahead of frying) and great flavor.
Pulled Pork Sliders - I liked these but a buddy didnt. Had a jalapeno on top for a little spice and I liked that the sauce was non traditional.

Our appetizers came right after that.  My bf and I shared the pulled pork sandwiches.  Wow, they were super delicious.  I would definitely order this again.  My bf had the chicken and dumplings and I had the scallops.  My bf said it was the best chicken he had ever had.

For dinner, I had the halibut because I wanted something very light.  It was the perfect choice.  Fish was very flavorful and was topped with almost a light salsa along with a side of beans and chorizo.  I'm not a big fan of beans, however, this mix meshed well together and complimented the fish perfectly.  

My husband ordered the steak for dinner, which I tried and it was quite flavorful as well.  The steak was cooked perfectly with the right amount of pink in the middle.  Our friend ordered the lobster pot pie, which is Nobhill's known dish, apparently.  Man, was that dish to die for!  It was so freaking yummy!  The menu says market price, unless you are planning on paying $130 incl. tax and tip, then I say order something else.  Dish is big enough to be shared between two and I say go for it, cause it's really that good.  

Dinner for two can easily be $150 plus dependent on what you order.  I think this is definitely a romantic place, perfect for a date!  I'd definitely come again for a nice dinner when around this area in Vegas!",MyRkSyp5BwHqfu58FZ6Iyw,1,0,4,Far35tVpGyE83ZXZgjSv1g

Now, I am the first to admit that I am a somewhat lazy Yelper, only really Yelping about something that is either really good, or really bad.
Having said that, this is yet another example of poor customer service ruining what could have been a great meal, but we never got that far.
My wife and I approached the hostess station, and the hostess looked up and made eye contact, without a hello, and waited for me to start speaking. The second I opened my mouth, she blurts out, ""I'll be with you in a minute!"". It was as if she was setting me up, waiting for me to speak, just so she could shut me down.
So, I waited. Then when she was ready, she said ""Can I help you?"", to which I started to ask what time they started serving dinner, but all I got out was ""What time do...."", before she interrupted smugly with ""Do you have a reservation?"".
I managed to get out ""No, but...."", before her final declaration...""My first available is at 8pm"", (it was 5:15pm) followed by a snooty stare that seemed to say, next time, think ahead, moron.
My wife and I walked away with our tails between our legs, embarrassed, and went somewhere else, where we had a great meal, then wrote this review.
I'd have given them a one, but I threw in an extra star for having a great menu. I'll bet the food was good, but I'll never know.",Dq2LXHfErN9LDy3CAQAC1Q,2,1,2,J7ugYVMseL52qeTk4-vq1Q

We had a really nice dinner there, including some cheeseburger sliders for appetizers and a chocolate crepe for dessert, but by far, the best thing we ordered was the lobster pot pie.  It was a pretty amazing dish - not cheap at $85 but it could be shared easily between two people.  They basically have a pot with lobster and this nice cream sauce baked with a pastry on top.  The waiter will take out this dish, cut off the top of the crust, and serve you portions of the lobster at your table.  I think this is one of those types of dishes that you must just try once in your life.  The food was great and it's definitely worth trying at least once.  I've still not been to Michael Mina but am looking forward to going even more after this meal.

5388095,2012-10-09,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"I finally got my foie gras fix since the foie gras ban happened here in Cali. We made reservations for Nobhill Tavern since it was one of the restaurants that wasn't too too pricey and within walking distance inside our hotel.

The ambiance is quite romantic with the restaurant's dim lighting and huge comfy chairs and couch-like benches up against the walls. 

Our waitress was very nice and efficient. She shared the specials with us and made some quick recommendations. 

I ordered the seared foie gras of course as the appetizer and the Shelton Farms Chicken Breast as my entree. Yes, I wanted to be sorta ""clean"" that night. I'd have to the say, the foie gras didn't really WOW me too much. I thought I would take a small bite of it and seriously have an orgasmic foodie attack, but unfortunately that didn't happen. Now I know if I don't have foie gras again for a long while, I won't feel deprived at all. My chicken entree was A-OK...the chicken was slightly too salty for me. Maybe cuz I'm bias, since the SBBF bakes the best and most moist chicken for us at home on a weekly basis. I did like the cauliflower puree and roasted cauliflower that accompanied my entree.

One minor issue I had during our dining experience was when they seated a table of 4-5 LOUD and not very ""dressy"" lookin' senior citizens right behind us, and there were plenty of other tables to seat them at. When we dine out at a restaurant that's 3 dollar signs or more, I honestly expect to have it somewhat quiet for me to enjoy the conversation that I'm trying to have.

I honestly would have given Nobhill Tavern 2 stars if it weren't for the delicious basket of bread they brought out with this flavorful olive oil. The little rolls they had were like pockets of carb heaven! Yummers.

I'd probably only come back here if I really wanted some good snack-sized bread. Yeah, obviously that's not gonna happen cuz I'm sure I can get just as good of bread elsewhere.",nmqX1cxPOYHwql5e4U9LuA,3,0,3,iEJPizWTUW5_DNRcB5etkA

I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed everything I've sampled.  They've billed their deal as the ""all night happy hour"" which runs Tuesday-Friday from 5:30pm to close.  

They have lots of great snacks and finger foods to munch on.  Each of them go for $6 with the duck fat fries being the only one that would fill you up.  The fries are huge and it might be the perfect fry for me.  But it's all about quality over quantity with these dishes.  The beef shortrib sliders have some of the most tender mini slices of meat ever.  I also like the crispy chicken wings a lot and also the beer battered shrimp.  

Drink specials include $3 PBR's because they're trying to keep it real and make Dennis Hopper happy in heaven.  They also offer several cocktails like the ""Whiskey Smash"" with Makers Mark, lime, mint and sugar.  My wife likes the ""Perfect Effen Drop"" which consists of Effen Black Cherry Vodka, fresh sour and creme de cassis whatever the heck that is.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable with the menu and very friendly.  

Happy hour bled into dinner the last time I was here as we imbibed a little more than we probably should have.  The bartender strongly urged I order the ""Harissa Glazed Lamb Shank"" and that was right on the money.  No knife was necessary for this perfect piece of lamb.  It was juicy, tender, almost fall off the bone awesome. It was accompanied with cous cous and raisins.  I could've used some pita and yogurt sauce if they had it.  

The clear star entree had to be the ""Lobster Pot Pie"" with truffle cream and vegetables.  We didn't have it but couldn't miss a few of the customers getting it.  The server rolls out this baby tableside while everything is still in the pot.

The venue itself is simple yet amazing as it is nestled inside the MGM that is home to so many great restaurants. The staff was very friendly, from the hostess to the bartender and the many different wait staff that attended to our needs.

We all decided to go with the tasting menu, with my friends wife asking for the vegetarian tasting menu which I must say looked very good even for someone who is a meat and potatoes person. The wine list looked good from the peak I had at it, my friend ordered all three bottle of wine which were all fantastic, one of which was super pricey and I couldn't tell a huge difference between that and the less expensive bottles. The lobster pot pie was absolutely amazing, I would go back just to eat that again. I wasn't as impressed with the quail, although that is something I wouldn't normally order. The kobe beef was very good, although I wouldn't rank it up there as high as the steaks I had the night before just down the hall at craft steak.

We took a chance, however, enjoying all of our previous forays into the Michael Mina restaurant group.  

After arriving for late dinner (10:00 Friday night), were seated and we peeked at the menu.  For a few minutes, none of the offered mains stood out to either of us, to which I thought might be a sign that I was going to regret booking this reservation.  My boyfriend said, ""I'm not going to come to a place like this and get a burger!""

However, we took a second look and decided that the Shelton Farms chicken breast sounded simple, yet yummy, paired with cauliflower two ways.  (I say this knowing that I very rarely, if ever, order chicken when dining out.)  However, I'm getting ahead of myself.  We started with the Market Salad (him) and the Tomato Fondue (her).  He was pleased with the Drunken Goat featured in the uber fresh salad.  The Tomato Fondue was a new way of enjoyed a grilled cheese and tomato bisque, with whimsical presentation and a great twist on a classic pairing. 

When both of our Mains arrived, we were pleasantly surprised at how delectable the chicken looked, crisped skin and all.  Served on a cauliflower puree with roasted multicolor cauliflower florets and golden raisins.  We later found out after discussing with our waiter that the chicken was primarily prepared via sous vide, with brief searing prior and a quick roast in the oven to crisp up the skin.  So so juicy and flavorful.   This kitchen made me believe in chicken when dining out again. 

We topped it all off with some house-made ice creams and the chocolate whiskey cake, although I feel as if (while writing this), I'd have rather have enjoyed the beignets myself.  Maybe next time?  

Speaking to our service experience, it was excellent,  the staff was attentive enough yet not overbearing.

I mean, I was going to be dining at Joel Robuchon's the next night, after all. When I looked at the online menu, I realized it was a Michael Mina establishment, so that triggered some interest. 

Then I saw three magnificent words:

LOBSTER POT PIE.

I was immediately sold. 

Indeed, I ordered this dish, even at the hefty price tag of $85. The waiter wheeled the pot pie over on a cart, still in it's beautiful copper pot. He then began the ""reconstruction."" He expertly removed the top of the pie and used it for the base. He arranged the lobster claws and tail in its original shape and spread the seasonal baby vegetables (which included Brussel sprouts and carrots) expertly around the crustacean. He drizzled the truffle cream sauce over the entire dish and delivered it to my seat. 

It did not disappoint. The lobster was cooked perfectly cooked. 

I began the night with the Alaskan king crab from the raw bar. It was probably just 1 leg broken up into 6 pieces. I would have liked a bigger portion, but the crab was deliciously sweet. 

My husband had the cioppino, which at $32 was a bargain compared to my lobster pot pie. It had a generous sampling of salmon, snapper (I think it was snapper, anyway) mussels, little necks, and scallops. The waiter pours the soup into the dish tableside.

There are cheaper options here if you want to save your money for the casino. The fall tasting menu (app/main course/dessert) was $49. The whole table has to do the tasting menu, however. They also have a late night happy hour and a nice sampling of small sandwiches, including lobster rolls, pulled pork, and sliders. 

We had a group of 13, and the restaurant was very accommodating. They sat us at a large banquet table in the back of the restaurant, which on a Sunday night was surprisingly empty. I suppose there are a lot of restaurants to choose from. They took up to 6 credit cards.

Oh, and a quick tip: 
If you are going to be spending more than $500 in the MGM or any of their properties (NYNY, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Aria, etc), make sure to do the Prima  VIP deal at check-in.

Nice location, albeit with subpar food.  For the price, I did expect something better.  But I was also struck with a feeling that Chef Michael Mina, was not exactly hands-on with the dining experience at the MGM.  Oh well.

A sumptuously designed restaurant distilling the essence of what a tavern should be by adding a modern twist.  Alcoholic beverages to accomodate  weary travelers and a comprehensive fusion cuisine to satisfy any palate.   The long walls of panelled glass draped in a dark forest green fine haberdashery provided the intimate dining cubicles complete with soft lit lighting and music to soothe the spirit. 

What I tasted from the menu: 

Shared lobster rolls- perfectly seasoned and just the right homemade mayo and herbs to highlight the sweet lobster meat on light pillow bread. Delicious. 

Striped bass cooked perfectly crispy skin and translucent white meat, simply salt and pepper seasoning- perfect with delicious broth. Sides of Green kale and cannelloni and kidney beans ( a bit too salty). 

The highly recommended lobster pot pie was as sublime as what our server described it as being. It is comparable to the Plaza Athenee Lobster except the domed buttery pastry covering the lobster ""stew"" was replaced by a heavenly souffle. The lobster consomme was delicious and velvety smooth with hints of the remaining essence of cognac stewed in the mirepoix juices for hours and hours. 

Dessert I tried was the Tarte Tatin- but found it substantially redone that it lost the simple goodness of what this tart should have been. Just full bold caramelization of the apples on a buttery dough. Their dough was hard and overly seasoned cinnamon and cloves. It doesn't need to be a purist to really say that it was just a poor rendition. Minus one star.

And...we always wanted to try Nobhill because of the Lobster Pot Pie.

Doing the math, we did the Michael Mina Cookbook Tasting menu because 1) had things we wanted to try and 2) we're suckers for prix fixe menus:
American Caviar Parfait 
Smoked Salmon, Shallot-Potato Cake, Chive Crème Fraîche
The caviar saltiness was offset by the butteryness of the creme fraiche. The shallot potato cake had a good crunch to it so you weren't biting into a thick pudding type food.

Maine Lobster Pot Pie 
My favorited. They came in small copper pots (big ones if you ordered the regular one). The server assembles it so skillfully and the bisque is so delicious.

Fried Sonoma Chicken 
Truffled Macaroni and Cheese, Caramelized Onion Sauce
The downside is you don't get the full presentation but I eyed other people receive their full chicken on a stove type tray where the server will cut the meat off the bone and serve it. Ours was plated. I think chicken is chicken but this was really flavorful and you can not go wrong with anything that has truffle in it. 

Butter Poached Kobe Beef Rib-eye 
Seared Foie Gras, Pinot Noir Reduction
A nice med-rare tender piece of meat sliced. I usually don't like foie gras and since there wasn't too much of it, it was edible. if i had a bigger chunk, i'd call it a day. My husband didn't care for the foie gras but he sure gobbled up that beef quick. 

Banana Tarte Tatin 
Maple Crème Anglaise, Maple Sugar Ice Cream
So good and love the maple sugar ice cream. It was  warm, with a bit of a crust and sooo good.

As if my ending couldn't get any happier we had a taste of coconut pana cotta in a little espresso sized glass. There was a little crunch with a litte bit of rice-krispies or the fancier version.

They had 3 types of bread olive, sourdough, and walnut and 3 types of butter, regular, cherry, and sesame. We had mojitos and they were kinda slushy though good fresh fruit choices.

5839012,2013-03-19,0,EGGdngbmVn-MA7i-6qrprw,"I had dinner at Nobhill tavern on my last night of a VERY long business trip to Vegas. My co-workers had been looking for the cheapest place to eat all week and I was Jonesin for some real food. I had s nice little table in the back and was surprised at how empty the place was. After perusing the menu and chatting with my waiter I decided on the antipasti meats and cheese to start and the lobster pot pie. The meats ad cheese were really nice and they were served with this fabulous grilled bread. I probably should've just made that my meal. 

The lobster pot pie is very nicely presented. They bring out this huge copper pot with pastry draped over the too and sides,. I was a little worried when I saw the size of the pot, but once they cut the top off they show you that the pot pie doesn't come s lose to filling it, which was a relief. You do get a whole lobster , it's in a nicer light sauce, Netherlands heavy sauce that you usually think of with pot pie, and some nice  vegetables. 

I must say that I was a little surprised when I got my bill. Of course it's my fault for not asking what the 'market price'  was, but I was nit expecting it to be $85. It was good, but not worth $85 in my opinion.",rsQ8-0wabCe0IsB55gnwtA,1,0,3,uaqC3UmDMw_Fa1UHzcgSYA

APPETIZERS
I usually get a salad or the seared scallops for appetizers, or both. Once we even ordered seared foie gras for the table (a la carte/off menu). It was 1.5lb and I was in foie gras heaven. Nob Hill makes some of the best foie gras I've ever had.

MAIN COURSE
I'm kind of boring because I always get the Maine Lobster Pot Pie. I just love it too much to pass it up whenever I come here. The crust is always flaky and buttery, baked to perfection. The lobster and vegetables are always perfectly cooked. The lobster meat is always fresh and tender, the sauce is to die for--flavorful and compliments the dish perfectly. I tried some of the Japanese Kobe once. It was also excellent. We ordered it medium-rare and it was so tender that it almost melted in your mouth. But I'm a seafood person, and I still order my lobster pot pie every time.

DESSERT
I'm also boring when it comes to dessert because I'm a sucker for souffle. So I always order the souffle every time as well. It's always baked just right, fluffy and hot when it comes out, complimented very well with the side of ice cream.

Service is always good as well. Never had a problem. I love this place. Can't wait to come back over and over again...",irlefzOmbcjqJLVQihA_vQ,1,1,5,XnHM8Ely2Wm6i1lQNzKWzQ

The service is very intimate to go along with the atmosphere, they always fill up your drinks, always on the look out for when you need them. The food? Awesome! I had the beef and it was juicy and tender and the sauce it came with, I was honestly scared, it was carrot puree, but it want that bad and there are sweet and tender carrot pieces
to decorate the plate with it. They have a huge cocktail menu which includes 30 year old scotch to $700 cognac! I have to add that, since I am picky, I never go to high end restaurants, but the waiter was very helpful, if I wanted to switch my aides to a different side with that entree, and there is a no rush feeling! So it makes you feel like you can realllly take your time to ear drink and talk with great company. A must try if you are staying at the hotel or just in Vegas!!

We made reservations a week earlier thinking this place would be busy but it wasn't. Our server was pretty awesome and earned every bit of his 18% tip. We got the winter tasting menu, but I was the only one who ordered from it. Boyfriend ordered straight off the menu.

French Onion Soup with grilled cheese sandwich: DELICIOUS! The sandwich was made with guiere (probably spelled that wrong) cheese. It had a strong taste but went really well with the french onion soup. Boyfriend liked it, but he wanted my potato leek soup more

Potato Leek Soup: This was just ok. The truffle overpowered the soup for me, but my boyfriend liked it. We ended up switching our appetizers.

Short Ribs: This was fantastic! It had great flavor and fell right off the fork. Mmm Mmmm MMMM! Boyfriend wasn't a fan of the grits, but he would have finished it off anyway because it was good just not what he wanted.

Salmon: Salmon was good the greenish soup around it wasn't. It tasted like fish... not cooked fish but the smell of fish. I really didn't like it (boyfriend did and polished the soup off). This is where our server came into play. He went and go me another plate for the salmon and brought me fresh vegetables to go with it. He even asked if i wanted another dish completely, but I wasn't about to give up the salmon so I declined. 

Creme Brulee with apple fritters: BEST THING OF THE NIGHT! We were skeptical about finishing this as we were really full (we had wicked spoon earlier in the day) but boy did we polish this thing off. It had great crunch and flavor. The apple fritters were fantastic as well. LOVED IT!

Some thing I didn't like.. how freaking dark it is in here but I had a thing against dimly lit restaurants. Lol",AVl_4qzgm3LJZJ__wQI0Wg,0,0,4,OD2HvKi2q4c7zy4m_9OjFg
