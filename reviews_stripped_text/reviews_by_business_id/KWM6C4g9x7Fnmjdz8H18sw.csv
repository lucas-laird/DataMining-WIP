2279,2014-12-31,1,KWM6C4g9x7Fnmjdz8H18sw,"Okay Let me start by saying that reason I am giving this place a two star was service first thing I call to ask if they serve food all night and what the hours were the bartender on the phone was a female this is her exact words ""Yes this is a BAR we are 24hrs and serve food all day"" I said okay thank you and she hung up no good bye or thank nada! So, I am starving I just got home from working on the strip and I work at Bar too that closes at one in the morning that is why I called to ask. My husband and I walk inside and sit right in front of the bar at one of the high tops it was 15 mins before anyone came to greet us or give us any menus. Finally, a male bartender came and greeted us he was friendly but was in a rush to get our order he just handed us the menu and asked ""Do you know what you want?"" We needed a min and did not ask if we wanted some thing to drink or nothing just ""I assumed you been here before"". Retarded how can you say that to a guest. So, he came around sooner than I thought to take our order the way it was going we asked for it to go. I ordered the chicken dinner with rice and veggies; my man got a bucket of buffalo wings with extra buffalo on the side and an order of fried cheese. Then he asks do you want a drink while you wait we both said no it is okay.( In my head you'd probably bring it when the food is ready anyway.)  So it took 30 to 45 mins for the bar food to come out; we had paid before hand too and had to go up to the bar to ask the bartender how much longer that's when he finally got the food. I guess he noticed we gave him 20% and was extremely fast and nice I walked out My husband stayed to get some ranch to go. When we get home his wings were PLAIN we hand to melt butter and mix it with franks to toss the wings in to make them buffalo. Other than that the food was good the veggies did not seem fresh if anything they are frozen or canned. This review got two stars because the male bartender was nice and food was okay.",8bFE3u1dMoYXkS7ORqlssw,1,0,2,JTtNF48bAxhc5hKNkRr_rA

Came in, sat down, was served pretty quickly. Atmosphere is a cross between Irish Pub / Sports Bar. Beers came, then we ordered. Took 30 minutes for food to arrive - a Ruben and some Corned Beef. Too long to wait, in this reviewer's opinion. Food was OK; the Ruben and onion rings was good, the Corned Beef tasted like it was sweetened.

The environment is clean and inviting. The interior will allow you to feel like you are not in Nevada. There are a lot of Irish appointments and the staff are pleasantly social with their guests.

The Guiness is well-poured and the sliders are very tasty. 

The one thing I would like to see upgraded is the bathrooms. The bathrooms were very clean and well stocked though.

Since it has changed to Sean Patrick's I have been finding myself going back more and more, I like the new stools and the new bar rail (simple stuff like padded bar rails and nice padded seats mean more to me than I thought), the cigar room is nice and even though I do not smoke cigars I can see the attraction to it.
I love the 2015 golden tee and the HUGE shuffle board table, the beers are good, nice and cold and the new menu although typical bar food, burgers, wing's and sandwiches the food I have ordered has all been good and HUGE portions.
I only go during lunchtime as I work nights but Delores the bartender has always been chatty and nice and very eager to please.

We were so disappointed that the 17%  of smokers were considered more important than the other 83% of non-smokers.

Staff was very accommodating and attentive.  Food under the supervision of Chef Char is not disappointing,very tasty with good potions.
4 stars only because I  can not bring my grandkids who I'm visiting to lunch,here (21 and over place).",5YDjHzvKs6KRvAVJT6A7bQ,0,0,4,sLVlwbHDmkBY-Cct-1gzug

The first time I ate here I was moderately impressed- I had the Reuben skins appetizer and it was very good. I love all things Reubenesque, so that was a must try! It was a good appetizer but needs a little more flavor. 
My dining partner had the pot stickers, and that plate presentation was show worthy! A mountain of cole slaw held the pot stickers, and siracha was painted onto the plate. This was a very good appetizer also. 

The decor is Irish/typical poker bar and there is plenty of seating throughout. Our server was quite friendly and helpful throughout our visit. They had football specials ($3 select drafts, $3 select shots) even though it wasn't a game night- who does that?? The menu has lots of promise and I plan to return to try a few other items.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,3,4,4,sgenqtecuiIgmZfrvE_i-w
