I decided I just had to compliment this business as it's top-notch all around with well-prepared food, fresh ingredients, and the friendliest service in a quick-casual restaurant I've come across. 
I highly recommend this Quiznos and agree with a previous reviewer -- it IS one of a kind. If you are anywhere near Flamingo & Maryland Pkwy you won't regret checking it out.",9fVRbFk-nximMMTJyaCWBg,0,0,5,puDJOk8Hf80g9FFv39vj9w

I've never had a bad experience.  My sandwiches are always good and because they seem to have a better selection of sauce they put on them and their chicken doesn't taste processed I'm more willing to step outside my box and try other sandwich selections.  The Caesar salad is amazing too.  It could stand up in a taste test next to one prepared by a fancy smancy restaurant any day!

When checking out they're always eager to give you coupons for savings on your next visit.

Definitely recommend this Quiznos if you're in the area.",tzIlxRJz_Y3gXA9eNP7QAQ,4,1,5,9uIwTgGOmVRgIPxMphFiRg
