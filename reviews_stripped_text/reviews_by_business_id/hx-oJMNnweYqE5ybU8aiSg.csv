My father and I were headed to get some crab, before my father could get a piece a lady rushes up to us and tells us that it is ""dinner only"". We were confused, we paid the dinner price and the lady kept on demanding on telling us that it was dinner only. We calmly asked her to double check as we felt humiliated as the rest of the 5 customers in the entirety of the restaurant heard EvERYTHING. When she found out, she admitted her mistake. However, the awkward experience overall still haunts me and my father. Yikes.",O7sxXpAU4dML8A5zuDLlBw,5,0,2,q6V7Z1dtV0G4udGfYm0eRQ

from, they brought fresh food in constantly. I don't understand often the negative comments people sometimes have on restaurants that are completely unwarranted in my opinion. Sometimes I wonder if they are objective or just wants to air some grievance and write negative. There are dozens of choices, try to tell me nothing was good at all. About food being cold, no idea when that was because every time I had a problem taking photo's due to the hot steam under the tray to keep the food warm!!    
I tried the hibachi/grill food too, picked some simple ingredients and the end result was not bad at all. Only thing I don't understand is the jar for tips there.

The service was excellent whenever my wife and I were there. If the food there was so bad then I wonder why Chinese travel agencies from China end up there with their tourist in busloads!! I have eaten in most of the hotels on the strip for buffet and laying out $30-$60 a person for a buffet, but this restaurant with their prices doesn't have to hold their head down for the quality of their food, so they have no Italian,American or Mexican food, it's Chinese buffet and they compare damn good with the other. I'm not from Las Vegas, I have traveled and eaten all over the world so it's not that I'm not able to compare restaurants, in fact I keep a small special notebook with me where I put the business cards in and write my opinion about service and food. If they have a takeout order sheet I take that too just to compare different restaurants and their prices.I gave them 4 stars and not 5 due to the fact that each restaurant can have an improvement somewhere, somehow, of the hundreds of restaurants that I visited there are maybe a handful that have the 5 stars.

I have to do a correction here, as mentioned everything was fantastic except it seems I have to agree with Travis B. concerning the rice, I did not eat the white rice, eat it every day at home so why should I have it in a restaurant, my wife however had it and she informed me that the rice was sticky and burnt, poor quality of rice.",1ngQE9AUfXva12Selv5PAw,4,1,4,pa8X4nMAd8FCYVcrdfzdeg

Lee's has a big, clean room with 4 small rows of selections plus a sushi section.  The sushi rolls were o.k. and pretty fresh, better than supermarket sushi but of course not as good as a top sushi restaurant.  I also liked the marinated musrooms and cucumbers.  The mongolian beef had very chewy beef, I didn't want to try the beef & broccoli beef but did get the broccoli and it had a pretty good flavor. They were constantly refreshing the dishes which was good to see.  They had several different Chinese dishes, plus onion rings, fries and pizza which was weird but my intention was to not pig out today so I didn't try everything.  The server was super quick and friendly and removed plates and refilled water quickly.  They had a fruit and dessert station and frozen yogurt which I also didnt try but didnt look too special.

The only thing I didn't like that almost makes me not want to go back is the rude hostess.  When I went to pay my check she snatched the $10 bill out of my hand. I thought maybe that was an accident, but when I gave her another $10 and asked for change to leave the server a better tip, she did it again!  When she gave me change she didnt say a word or make eye contact, no 'thank you,' no 'come again' and definitely no 'have a nice day!'

We got there last night for a late dinner. Had been there before for brunch and it was ok, nothing special but ok. Last night was terrible!!!

We had the feeling to eat leftovers. The food had been standing on the buffet for hours I guess because most of it was stuck on the plates, very dry, so dry.... Looking not nice and not tasty at all either. The chow mein had no flavor and was over-cooked, fried rice looked like regular white rice, almost nothing in it. Even the simple French fries (yes you have to be in America to have fries, pizza etc on a Chinese buffet!) were so dry that we couldn't even chew them.  

Even the fortune cookies were strange. We all got the same message saying ""you need a second fortune go on www.SecondFortune.com"" LOL!

Staff was barely friendly moping the floor while we were eating. No idea of customer service and respect I presume....!

3351668,2015-07-06,0,hx-oJMNnweYqE5ybU8aiSg,"Was out and about, looking for a quick bite when I saw that the once-defunct Lee's Buffet was now open as Vegas Buffet.  Price was very reasonable at $7.99 for lunch, so I took chance.  When all was said and done, I think I finally found the worst dining experience in Las Vegas.

Service is not really non-existent, it is clueless.  The owner-manager, a middle-aged woman, was hardly at the front counter, so a wait is involved even when you are the only one in line.   You then have the pleasure of hearing her berating staff anywhere in the restaurant, in loud Chinese.  Even one of the cooks who is clearly Hispanic came in for a withering chastisement from her holiness.  I first went to the men's room, to wash up, only to discover no paper towels.  I mentioned this to THREE employees, including the manager-yeller and by the time I departed... still no towels.  In fact, when I informed her highness of this lack of drying supplies, her reply was, ""Oh, that's ok.""  Clearly a Rhodes Scholar.  In fact, throughout my meal, she was glued to the floor, literally standing next to me, loudly castigating someone.  When I finally turned to her and asked, sarcastically, ""I'm not bothering you, am I?""  She replied, ""No.""  A waiter got the message and motioned for her to move.  She was back within 5 minutes.

While the service is abysmal, the food is atrocious.  Cold.  Watery.  Mislabeled, if labeled at all.  When the best dish on a multi-offering buffet are fried desert noodles, something is terribly wrong.  I started with the sushi, which was surprisingly a notch above mediocre.  The tempura item, whatever it was, as there was no label, was another pleasant surprise.  Considering its location just across the street from the vaunted Yama Sushi, whose lunch buffet, with tax, is a shade above $22, one could conceivably make a decent meal here from the cold-rice offerings.  There is a Mongolian barbecue station adjacent to the sushi, but no one ever came to the counter to take an order.  

From the hot buffet:  Astringent ""stuffed"" crabs, the size of  a Ritz cracker, which, coincidentally, may be its main ingredient.  Mongolian Beef was spongy and chewy to the extreme.  Fried items were hit and much miss.  Mini Spring Rolls were less than lukewarm and flavorless, while the cream cheese-filled wontons were passable, but just barely.  Skewers of over-done, roasted chicken breast were surprisingly flavorful, if tough and dryer than a good Champagne.  Shrimp in many guises were competent but not memorable.  The ghastly, artificially-yellow egg drop soup was salt-free, though not labeled as such.  And the pork chop was that in name alone, as there was no discernible flavor in any bite.

The deserts are as wanting as anything else, save for the crispy noodles baked in some type of honey/sweet sauce and covered with sesame.  The 'ice cream' - and I am being generous here in my phraseology -  was less creamy than a hard avocado.  The filled cake roll, whose middle was unidentifiable was stale, and the banana pudding should have been left in the box in which the mix came.

Came time to check out, the loud manager never once asked how things were, nor did she offer a thank you.  I thanked her plenty by informing a carload of visiting out-of-staters who were deciding where to eat to brave the line at Yama, or, better yet, hit McDonalds.  At least you know what your getting, in advance.

Vegas Buffet's website is another indicator of their less than stellar service philosophy, as no link works and the prices listed are different than those in-store.  While I will agree with their touting their prices as ""one third"" of those on the Strip, I would take umbrage at their usage of the word ""Enjoy.""",wlNagcXk2dFxjt9QAATNbw,0,0,1,QF4prY-nFLUaze7SEmm7hQ

What I really liked about this place is that they kept the crab legs coming.  You eat 'em, they keep bringing 'em!  Same goes for their whole fried shrimp.  That being said, neither the crab legs or shrimp have any flavor other than what nature has intended.

I'm totally bummed I didn't see the Mongolian BBQ station until I had already filled my gut with all the other items they had.  Mainly because they offer shrimp in the Mongolian BBQ.  Now, this is a relatively small station with limited veggie and sauce choices but....SHRIMP!

I wasn't a fan of the baked salmon or the stuffed clam shells.  They both had a flavor of mayonnaise I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy. 

The sushi bar was small but decent.  No sashimi offered here but they will place the same pieces you'd get in sashimi form atop a small pinch of rice (you know, to fill you up). All the other rolls are some play on a California roll (some deep fried, sub cream cheese) ,etc.)

I wasn't told that a drink was included in the cost of the buffet so I was surprised when I was charged for one despite that I never ordered one, or was even offered one.  We asked for napkins three times and never received them (which, when dinning with children under age 5, c'mon, you know we needed those napkins).",bmOuwh_dy0n3GIccYJpZ5g,3,1,3,k4yW3WxYXJg2l1LUCDHvMQ

This review may REALLY scare the crap out of you, and it has nothing to with Halloween coming up. Quite frankly-  this review should not be read anyone with young children nearby, or anyone with a heart condition. Let me just start with this : This restaurant was disturbingly bad. The food had basically no flavor and you could not even distinguish between what was supposed to be ""Asian"" food and something that was not even food at all. Okay, now as i warned you earlier... this is going to get REAL scary. However, i first must admit, that i took a complete chance on this place. I read nothing about it in advance. Our Uber driver simply said it was likely ""okay"". The simple fact is this , this was only place within a short walk to our final destination and my teenage son was really complaining about being hungry. We were going to the visit the Atomic Bomb museum. (that was worth going to) In retrospect, I now wonder if any old nuclear fallout impacted the owners judgement in cooking. FINAL WARNING: Read on at your own risk. After eating several very bland and very poorly tasting items, (including the white rice) I went to back up to the food warmers to see if i missed the one ""good"" tasting item. Much to my dismay, i nearly fell to the ground when i thought i saw what appeared to be tiny ducks hatching in the tray of hard boiled eggs. The white eggs were just slightly brown and were all crackled - kind of like that faux italian wallpaper or floor tile you find at Home Depot. Rather than touch the eggs or get any closer, i took a photo them. This appeared to be the most bizarre and nasty food of the Philippines. It is called Balut. Go to Wikipedia on your own time to learn more about it. I won't describe it beyond it's name. Suffice to say this, It is just totally and 100 percent completely gross. It is legally banned in numerous states and countries. Be afraid, be very afraid of it. It was even on the TV show Survivor years ago as a tribal challenge....and guess what.....the tribe members puked on it.
