I ordered a beer (great selection) and the Angus Burger.  The beer was delivered promptly.  After 30 minutes, my burger and fries arrive.  I ordered the burger Medium and it came out quite well done and very dried out.  I was offered ketchup or a side of mayo to ""help"". The obvious question you just asked is, ""Why didn't you send it back?""  A) I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for a burger and B) by then a large group had arrived and the wait staff was in a frenzy. The fries were crisp, not greasy and not over salted. Very good.  Needless to say, I finished I the beer and fries, not so much the burger. Lower rating also due to the waitress showed no interest in being proactive with the food and was solely focused on boosting the drink orders.

195881,2011-07-30,0,jhjmgnCYsTpIe-XOMZR-vA,"This is my favorite Irish pub in town.  It has a very authentic feel for being attached to a casino, (probably due in no small part to the fact that the interior was reassembled from a true Irish pub deconstructed and shipped here,) and it doesn't try to be more than what it is - a pub.  No gimmicks.  The service is good and the appetizers are in my opinion better than the entrees, (as it should be for a pub.)  Try the sausage bites or the fries with white gravy.  Depending on when you're there, the atmosphere can get lively, too.  Lots of locals.  For the person looking for an honest pub, this is your spot.",GOWBkpDlkJY4jvHL0xWGlg,0,0,4,ANAn2nqUPZwg08CANNgSPg

We arrived about 8pm on a Friday evening and the place seemed fairly busy.  We waited at the door for a hostess to serve us, but after several minutes with no acknowledgement of our existence, we walked in and got the attention of a server, and she sat us in her station.  She was very friendly and seemed to be in good spirits.  It is always nice to have a server with a happy disposition!

We both started with a cup of their roasted corn chowder with bacon and it was thick, flavorful and very satisfying. For my entree, I went with their grilled vegetable salad and added grilled salmon to it for $3 which was a bargain, because it was a good-sized filet (about 6 oz).  Our server said the salad was really good, but I am going to have to say it was just good.  While the salmon was cooked perfectly, the vegetables were just OK. Some were rather bland and the lemon caper dressing was a little boring too. Salt and pepper helped, but couldn't make up for an uninspired salad.  And while the menu lists asparagus as the first ingredient, there were only 3 very skinny spears, which was a bit disappointing.

My date chose the shephard's pie, which was a bit of a let down too.  It tasted like canned chili with mashed potatoes on top. I've had shepard's pie before, and they usually have a beef stew flavor, not a beef chili flavor.  Oh well.  He ate all of it anyway.

Our dessert was actually quite good ... We shared the apple crisp and it was a generous serving of Granny Smith apples baked with cinnamon and sugar and topped with pastry crumbles and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Very tasty and the apples were cooked just right.

Overall, it is an ""A-OK"" place and I would eat there again if I was in the area, but I don't think I would make a special trip for the food.",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,0,1,3,PDnJUvKwxsN1JxPI7vtxnQ

Hub and I came here on a Friday night to grab a few bites on the cheap to wash good Irish beer down with.....this hit the spot!
Got here at 5pm, our server, Jack, let us know that 16oz beers were on happy hour for 2.50.   All of them I exclaimed? YES!  Black and Tan please.....while the hubby got a Smithswicks...(likely spelled that wrong...)
Delicious beers arrived as we asked about the five dollar options for happy hour.  We decided to get the chicken fingers with buffalo sauce and the pretzels.   Food arrived.....was delish!
The star of the show were the piping hot pretzels with a beer cheese and mustard dipping sauce....so dang good!  I neglected my chicken fingers in order to eat my pretzel. (2 come with an order and they were big)!
We ordered one more set of 2.50 beers.....pinch me please!
Not understanding the bad reviews...great beer, great pub grub and an awesome Jack to take care of you......we are definitely coming back!
Oh yeah, my tab for 2 people: 2 beers, 2 apps...20 dollars!  Plenty of food!

3577017,2017-03-05,0,jhjmgnCYsTpIe-XOMZR-vA,"Went here on a comp with my wife.  We were seated and our orders taken relatively quickly.  It wasn't super busy, but we literally did not interact for our server, Aileen (or Ilene) for the remainder of the time we were there.

It took nearly 30 minutes to get our food, and the appetizer we ordered -- a large soft pretzel -- was actually the last thing that came out!  We never received refills and after 25 minutes of my wife having an empty glass I finally went up to the bar to get a soda refill myself.  I'll note that the place was not more than half full and that the server went multiple times to the tables around us.

As for the food, it was OK.  Pretzel was decent and the shepard's [sic] pie was OK, but we weren't big fans of the sausage rolls.  

At the end of the meal we were getting up to go find a manager and finally our server said ""do you need your check?""  We spoke to the manager who apologized, but then tried to defend our server THREE TIMES by saying she was busy in the kitchen trying to get our order.  Perhaps they made it wrong and I can understand that -- it happens.  However it's inexcusable to never return to your customers to tell them about delays.  Furthermore, the manager should absolutely not have repeatedly defended the server's actions.  Unbelievable.

We gave her the comp slip and left.  Oddly enough we bumped into the manager later in the casino and she gave the comp slip back.  It's a nice gesture, but probably one that should have happened while we were talking to her in the restaurant, not half an hour later.  She also informed us that this place is shutting down in about a month or so.  

I'm sure our experience isn't indicative of the level of service most people receive here, but still it was pretty awful for us.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,2,0,1,ZLtvr37NpMQWGMW7FbKH5g

The food isn't great.  It's an Irish bar, but their Shepherd's pie is bland!  That should be one of their specialties!  Tonight, I had a teriyaki chicken sandwich.  The chicken patty was one of those frozen ones that have the fake grill marks on it and the teriyaki sauce was so salty, I had to scrape it off.  And the drinks aren't that great a price, either.  My glass of house wine was $8!!!!

Also, the service just isn't there.  We waited at least 10 minutes for a waitress to come by, then heard the couple next to us ask for their check.  This is how that conversation went:
""Hey, we haven't seen our waitress in a long time and need our check.""
""OK, what's her name?""
""Ummm, I don't know.""
""Well, if you don't know her name, I can't get her."" (umm, wtf?)
""We just want our check.""
""I can't access other people's checks.""
""Can you just get a manager to give us our check?""

...and the waitress walked away.  They were just left there, hopelessly waiting for their waitress to come back.

We like the food a lot, especially the special burger, which has a lot of good seasoning.  DH really likes the Shepherd's Pie.  The best part of the food, though, are those fabulous potato croquettes, which you can get as a side instead of the usual fries that are served everywhere else.  If I could order a plate of those, I might consider killing the diet for them!

Our favorite attraction, though, is John Windsor, a British/Irish singer and guitar player, who's terrific.  He plays on Wednesday and Thursday nights, and does a lot of traditional and fun Irish numbers, as well as a lot of contemporary stuff.  He has a really nice voice and is a very accomplished guitarist.  

My rave for Wooloughan's doesn't extend to the Rampart Casino.  It's close to where we live, so we were going there quite often for our low-roller gambling adventures.  But it took me too long to realize that the Casino does not value its loyal customers.  All those visits and never a single freebie or comp or anything.  Unfortunately, this has translated to many fewer visits to the Pub, since it now requires an AHAH moment to remind us that it's there, it's nearby, and that we haven't been there in a while.

My husband and I found this cozy nook to sit in that had it's own television. It's nice having privacy after a long day at work! The inside is practically all dark wood . It looked so warm and inviting It made me feel like I was stepping in from the blistering cold into a warm cozy pub. We all know it was like 109 degrees outside though! 

The waiter stopped by to get our drink order. I asked for Mountain Dew he gave me Sprite. My husband said they might have not had Mountain Dew and just replaced it with something equal . In my book nothing is equal to the Dew! I found out later while we were paying our bill that they do have Mountain Dew! It's okay though the waiter was tending bar too so it was an honest mistake. 

The appetizers looked yummy so I ordered those instead of a full meal. I started with the Potato Croquettes which were like fried mashed potatoes . They served them with Ranch sauce and their home made mustard. The mustard was really good! 

I had the Pretzel which was okay it was like the ones you get at the movie theater. They served it with what tasted like a beer cheese sauce. I found myself dipping more into the mustard then the cheese sauce. The sauce tasted too bland for me. 

We ended the meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding . It was plum cake drizzled with warm butter toffee and served with candied walnuts and Devon cream. It was delicious! 

I would want to come back and try their other offerings on the menu like their Steak Tips or their Corned Beef and Cabbage. I'm always up for something new!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,4,TT9gAhbLSr-44d25MUSHeQ

The decor is very irish and they have a stage in the dining area. I like the authentic Irish feel to the place. 

We started off with fried pickles.  I was expecting them to be round sliced pickles but these were large pickle spears.  The breading tasted homemade. I'm not usually a fan of fried food but this stuff was pretty good. 

Our server was Jasmine and she was on top of things the entire evening. Boyfriend and I shared some Dublin nachos next (no meat, natch!) They were not typical irish nachos (thank goodness) - you know the kind, with potato chips instead of tortilla chips. No, this was much better! They were multicolored corn chips and melted cheddar cheese, plus black olives, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  The guacamole was disappointing. It tasted like it came out of a bag and had zero flavor. The salsa I ate was very mild. My boyfriend had salsa with red pepper flakes and it was pretty good. I didn't overall like the cheese. Why cheddar cheese?? It is the greasiest cheese ever and doesn't seem to belong melted on top of chips. And then it cools off and hardens like shellac. Yuck.

While I can't say that its the best pub food I've ever eat, its defiantly in my top 3. If you are looking for a decently priced simple place in Vegas with good food, then check it out.  While its probably not worth the drive from the strip just for the eats, its great if you want a change of pace.",fQcfRZkcOO-MXFYD5umf2w,1,0,4,BPcRcg0YitKLy8P36MWWUQ

Quaint decor, dark wood  dart boards, it's what you would expect in a reproduction Irish pub. It's fine.

Seat yourself in a booth or table, your choice. We were served by Monika, a delightful server who made us and our angelic boys extremely welcome. 

Food; it's ok, the menu is not large but has the staples expected in an Irish pub. Bangers, Pies, Fish & Chips. I had a steak, nicely cooked with mushrooms and onions and a side of mash. Wifee had sausage rolls which she raved over. Kids had chicken tender/finger/nugget things. What else?


Guinness was cold, there were a table of noisy New Yorkers adjacent who kept us amused. Great night, we will return.",hRzmJCPmV1_ggM5jSxq2bA,1,0,4,OezFVX_iRxCnzle8-HhN1w

This time I had a $10 food comp, and got the Reuben. They make a decent Reuben, but with not enough 1000 Island for my taste. I like my sandwich swimming in 1000 Island.
My request for extra dressing was met, to my delight. I sat at the bar, as they added gaming 3 or so months ago. So, comped Guinness & Fruli (that's a chocolate strawberry) to boot, that makes my day. And, good luck finding a decent draft at the casino bars. So, I applaud the casino for adding those machines right under the taps! 
There are many beers to choose from here, and for a pseudo beer snob like me, I will be back to try other Guiness concoctions while playing a little poker. 
There was a decent crowd here, and the bartender was busy and took care of me and the one other person at the machines. This really is a quaint, inviting place with better than average food, drinks, and NEW- NOW WITH GAMING!",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,0,2,4,1J4_LfB_1mYbY0RzCy6h-Q

I am staying at the JW Marriott next to the casino. The casino staff will tell you 9 times out of 10 that this is the place to go on the property. The chips or fries are very good. The fish and chips is pretty good but if you are in Las Vegas and love fish and chips, go to Ri Ra at Mandalay Place. The tar tar sauce and coleslaw are nothing special. The breading on the fish is tasty and crisp. The fish is good but only 3 small fingers come underneath the chips. It's a friendly place but tends to get only business conventioneers who tend to be clique-ish. Try the weekend crowd to socialize. I originally gave 3 stars but would like to modify to 4 stars because the price is excellent.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,0,0,4,_qF_PTuzxbYHlJKaJH5I3w
