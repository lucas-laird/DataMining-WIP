766531,2013-08-04,0,EhdkogSUSDLx5JufCAtm8A,"Been searching for the best sushi in town since I moved to Vegas two years and ran across Yellow Fin this weekend (saw other 5 star reviews on Yelp)...this is an amazing find!! The best non-tourist sushi place in town by far, great service, and ambiance. Don't let the Sapphire Club next door scare you away, this place is definitely off the beaten path....but, we'll be going back often. I've had sushi all over Las Vegas....on and off the strip, this is easily the best sushi bar off the strip and goes head to head with other top rated sushi bars on the strip. Yellow Fin beats all others for price, quality and service. Don't miss out, if you love great sushi and sashimi this is the place for you. The cooked dished are great too!! A fun place with tasty food, you can't beat it.",WCqXTDo6PbmswqCnBUUj3Q,0,0,5,o5I-bZVl9E2Y8zFbcH7G8g

The artistic presentation of the sushi was the best I have seen anywhere as this is an art, not a science. I cannot recommend this restaurant more strongly and look forward to returning on my next trip back to Las Vegas.",8xwW96kPlm5YOQYOo1P4KA,1,0,5,YhlAdALGD55p7xzfNNX3pQ
