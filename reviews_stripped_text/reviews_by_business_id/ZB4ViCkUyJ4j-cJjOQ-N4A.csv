This was some of the best hot and sour soup I've had, with lots of egg and tofu in it and a good broth that had just the right combination of hot and sour.  I also ordered the ""empty center"" vegetable (kong xin cai) - it was not bad but not sure I would order it again.

I don't usually like hot and sour soup, but theirs is edible to me, and I've heard many others call it fantastic.  

I would not take out the soup dumplings as they need to be eaten fresh and hot.  The soup buns might be ok to take with though.  Pretty much everything else would be perfect for takeout.

1352507,2011-04-08,0,ZB4ViCkUyJ4j-cJjOQ-N4A,"Had came here one day with friends after a few of them told me it being pretty good. Had been a while since i had shanghai style food so had hopes up =] 

So the restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the Pacfic Asian? Mall on the south side of Spring Mountain near Decatur, by the ""old"" SF market. The restaurant took the spot of where the old Champion restaurant used to be.

Service was decent. Food was pretty good. Decent priced. Menu is kind of small and they are not an authentic full shanghai style restaurant. Reason why i said their menu is small and not an fully authenic shanghai style restaurant is because there is a few dishes i always order when i go to a shanghai style restaurant, which includes the shanghai style stir fried noodles and the shanghai style rice cake.

But anyways, of a party of 5, we had ordered a few things like the Xiao Long Bao, beef rolls, mapo tofu, and Shang Qian Bao. Some of these items were on their Lunch Special menu which is maybe a dollar more than the normal price but it comes with a choice of a soup (Hot and Sour Soup, Curry beef noodle soup, or this other noodle soup) and the main dish. 

Lets begin with my favorite Xiao Long Bao. Its a popular dumpling dish that usually come in 8 in a steamer rack. What makes them so popular is that it is a pork dumpling that has a ""pouch"" of soup that gets formed after the steaming process at the bottom of the dumpling. Extreme care when picking this up when its hot because the wrapper of the dumpling is more prone to breaking open because it is soft. Luckily for me, after many years of eating these, im quite skilled now to pick these up without it breaking and losing all that yummy soup. good tip is to slightly nudge in all direction with chopsticks on the top part where they had ""Closed"" the dumpling to lift the dumpling off the wax paper. With the use of both a spoon and chopsticks, lift it up from the top ""knot"" part and place onto spoon then bring back to your bowl. Be careful ! its hot but thats what makes it good too. Their Xiao Long Bao was made using a very thin wrapper (which is good). Also they contain possibly the MOST soup in each dumpling i have ever had which is quite surprising considering the thin wrapper too. Very nice and flavorful. Great eaten with vinegar (and ginger for those who like ginger, i personally dont haha)

Next is the beef rolls. One of my friends favorite item. 2 long wrap style rolls cut into portions. Nicely wrapped so it doesnt fall apart easily. Flavorful and good balance between the beef and the cilanto inside the wrap. 

Next is the mapo tofu. There are many ways of making this and ive tried quite a few from different restaurants around the world as well as home-made ones. Some like to add minced meat, or more spice, or more of the popular sichuan style spice which gives the ""numbing"" effect. This restaurants style is a plain cubed tofu with the mapo tofu sauce. Their style is more on the sweet than spicy side. Tofu used was a soft/silk style so its very smooth. 

Last but not least is the Shang Qian Bao. Its a bun style dumpling with probably the same filling as the XIao Long Bao that was pan fried so the bottom has a nice crisp. Topped with green onions and black sesame, their size is pretty good. Like the Xiao Long Bao, they contain soup inside to (so be careful when eating this one too). Nice and flavorful as well. 

Overall, the experience at eating at this restaurant was pretty good. Everything was decently price, fairly average for this style of cuisine. They currently have the best Xiao Long Bao in the city from the places i have tried. Would like to come here again =]",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,0,4,Z-D404m6y3_6kgcnJxexqg

I've been here like 3 consecutive times since I've heard about this place. The soup dumplings are amazing! Also- it's always funny to bring friends and see them eat the steaming soup dumplings thinking they aren't that hot, but when the dumpling bursts open, all the soupy contents *hot* mind you spills onto their palates is quite the comedy to see.  They give complimentary hot tea :) 

The beef roll is amazing too. It is this flat tortilla like material wrapped with beef and cilantro, dipped in the sauce they provide which is this dark vinegar sauce. 

For the soup dumplings, tried the house soup dumpings and the special soup dumplings, one differs from the other in that the broth is chicken broth and not pork broth. House I believe is made with the chicken broth. 

The pan fried dumplings-omg. So good too! I didn't know they were soup dumplings as well, so I was excited to order them and then soon enough find them nearly burning my mouth as well! 


Needless to say, order the soup dumplings and be cautious cause they're extremely hot and/or film your friends eat them. :P",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,3,2,4,Vav5XSOZqkN5RGMzHDEFbQ

1602880,2012-08-31,0,ZB4ViCkUyJ4j-cJjOQ-N4A,"First things first, the food is great.  This is the only Shanghai place in Chinatown (I think) and their food is as close to authentic as Vegas can get.  I especially love their specials menu on the back where if you order one entree, you can get a soup for a little extra charge.  You can get a lot of food for under $10.  

When I went here, I ordered these noodles with beans, peanuts, mushrooms, tofu, and meat in a special sauce.  I think they're called Eight Noodles or something, but I love these.  Only Three Village serves these noodles.  Slightly spicy, piping hot, and al dente noodles, this was my favorite dish.  

I ordered it with the hot and sour soup.  Normally, restaurants add too much sour and corn starch so it becomes almost gelatinous.  Here, the texture of the soup was perfect as well as the balance between sour and spicy. 

The worst part of the restaurant, however, is the service.  Never before has the service been such a killer of my good-food feel.  I'm pretty tolerant of bad service, too, but the waitress ignored our table the entire time.  Even worse, there is only one waitress.  When I went, there was only one other table, and she spent 15-20 minutes conversing with the table while I had to get up and service myself.  Worst service.

The steamed xiao long bao wasn't bad, I think they should have steamed it a little longer but the flavors were there and the best part is the juicy soup instead of the dumpling with some black vinegar - the only way to eat them!
The fried ones were pretty good, the dough to meat ratio was good and I just love the way the dough tastes with the juices on the inside.
The beef roll was pretty tasty, not too crazy oily, so that was good.
I could have done without the noodle dish because there should have been more sauce and there were indeed 8 ingredients, but they were a little cheap on it.  The noodles were freshly made, so that was a plus.
The chicken dish was horrible; it first came out with no flavor whatsoever.  We sent it back - instead of making another fresh dish, they re-cooked it adding more ""flavor"", but the meat got tough and there was slight flavor the second time.  It also just tasted like old chicken and something they probably cooked a couple times before.  We told one of the servers our problem with the chicken dish.  It seems like it went out the other ear because it was still on the bill.  We told another server the problem with the chicken and it still being on our bill and he went to take it off.  That just left a bad taste in our mouth since it was obvious that we didn't eat the chicken and all that.

We'll be back because of the xiao long bao.",upNep4Q2mMownruMWtUVGA,0,0,3,Pt18_E_nNKHxfXXPiYBTdw

When you go to China Mama or Wendy's, the XLB are shriveled up and sometimes completely dried out.   The XLB at Three Village are probably at least 33% bigger in size and does not look like it was frozen.   These are handmade.

The pan fried XLB are also delicious but very filling.   I prefer the steamed but many will like the pan fried especially if you're a fan of the pan fried noodles.

We also ordered the lamb dumplings which were very addicting.  We will soon return within 15 hours as we're returning the next day to try their vegetable and fish dumplings.   The Shanghai Stir fried noodles were extremely flavorful but a little oily.  Still very good.

I'm amazed this place has only 3.5 stars.   This should be at least 4 stars.  They have combos where you can get xiao long bao along with a soup for maybe 1-2 dollars more.  We had some hot and sour soup which was decent but the star of the show is the dumplings.   

Prior to coming here I would go to Noodle Pot for dumplings.  Their dumplings are very good - very homestyle, simple.   These dumplings are Shanghai style more refined.  They're both great options but in terms of Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, this is the new king.

I must say first this, you need to understand that it is nearly impossible to get the same kind of food you get when you're either in China or Taiwan, probably because it something in the water, or just that the best cooks stay in their home country! ;-)  

This place however, comes close at satisfying those cravings for the things I love to eat in Asia!  

A few of my favorites here are the beef rolls, wrapped in green onion pancakes, the xiao long bao (little soup dumplings), the fish dumplings, stir-fry rice cakes (shanghainese style), and the Jing Dong bing (which is a type of pancake with pork inside).  

Each bite was sooo nostalgic to Asia!  Although it cannot compare to the places I've eaten at in Taiwan, it was pretty close and I can't complain...It is much much cheaper to drive to spring mountain to grab a quick bite than to fly to Asia for a long trip! ;-) Am I right? 

Service is a bit slow at this place, but that's probably because there's only 1 lady running the entire restaurant in the front (or at least that what it seemed to me when I was there).  I understand hard work and the amount of stress it is to be in that position, so I decided to just jump in and help her with refilling the tea pots at my table and grabbing some take out boxes!  She didn't seem to mind, and in fact, she seemed pretty happy to see so many of my friends and I enjoy the food at her restaurant.  

I am definitely coming back here again to get my cravings satisfied! =D",n_UcypOj7YW8gdR43XIUSQ,1,0,4,AypdtMvztedFF_mUxvh5Xw

So I read from other reviews that its kind of difficult to find because the sign is in Chinese, however I think that was awhile back ago because there is a huge sign now in English that says 3 Village. It's actually big enough to be seen from down the parking lot and even when driving on Spring Mtn. None the less, the restaurant is located upstairs just south of the elevator. My friend and I came during a week day for lunch and I would say it was about 75% filled to occupancy and that's a good amount considering it was a week day. Also all the patrons looked Chinese except us, which implies this place is authentic right? We both order the specials that comes with the soup. The fried tofu was really delicious with a home made taste, but modified for a restaurant. Loved it! We also had the pork dumpling and beef roll. The dumpling was AMAZING because you immediately know these are made in house and they even have some broth inside of them?! Really unique because I've never had dumplings with liquid inside. The beef roll was really good too. I was expecting this to be like a spring roll but it was kind of different because it was some type of thin savory pancake they rolled the beef in. Lastly both the soup and beef roll had cilantro in them and I love cilantro so it really added the taste of freshness to both dishes. Highly recommend this place, the only down side it that the service is terrible. Probably because there was only 1 server taking care of the entire front of the house? We asked for water- never got it, didn't check up on us after receiving our food and it took awhile for us to get our check. I was actually going to order something to-go, but I gave up.

Beef roll was not greasy at all despite the way it looks - yummy, but something I can pass on next time.

Our hiking group went here today for our annual Chinese New Year lunch.  One of our hiking group is Chinese and she ordered the same thing for us all.  We had a choice of the soup we wanted--I chose hot and sour soup--and everyone got an order of Xiao Long Bao, the soup dumplings about which many of the reviews mention.

The soup and dumplings were both very good.  I've had Xiao Long Bao before at another restaurant and these were on par or even a bit better.  The hot and sour soup was tasty.  

Finding the place was a bit hard.  There was no sign that I saw--certainly none from the parking lot.  I knew it was on the second floor of this shopping plaza in Chinatown, but I didn't know to head down the little area that runs south from the elevator.

There were 10 of us at the round table.  Service was adequate--nothing special.  They delivered the dishes we ordered but did not bring refills of water and we had to ask for more tea.  One pot for a table of 10?

In all, it was a nice lunch to celebrate the Year of the Dragon.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,2,3,d-PkAQqwh-_wM6GSsfHOPw

My sis and I had two orders of the XLB combo: The tofu noodle soup was weak with a few small piece of deep fried tofu and no noodles while the curry noodle soup had that flavor you'd find in the top ramen package.  

The soup inside the XLB taste a bit off, but the dumplings were filling and delicious after i drained it.  I also like how the dumpling skins stayed intact as i picked them up.  I absolutely HATE seeing my soup goes to waste before my spoon make the assist.  I'll start punching walls and shit.  You have no idea.  I need help.

We also ordered the Scallion Pancakes since we're familiar with it and discovered that it was quite bland.  Outside has a nice crunchy texture with a doughy interior but again it gets old after a couple bite.  

Beef Roll is like the pancake but rolled up with beef and has that oyster, BBQ flavor similar to Cha Siu Bao (Pork Steam Bun).  It was huge but i wouldn't order it again. 

Judging from the menu they have some items that may be more suitable for the adventurous crowd, but overall I don't think I'd be back anytime soon.  I think I'm too American for this place, hence our orders were simple.  Don't let that door hit you on the way out.  Seriously, it swing shut faster than you can get by.

4131116,2012-05-10,0,ZB4ViCkUyJ4j-cJjOQ-N4A,"So I have been here many times just finally writing a review.  I take a lot of out of town guests here to try something new they won't find at home.  We traveled across the world to have the original dumplings in Shanghai both fried and steamed they are street food there but to find them good here it is an experience.  We have searched the country over to find them in the US San Francisco, Chicago, New York and LA the only place that has come close was New York and LA.  So needless to say I was so happy to find better then New York or LA here in Vegas!  

The steamed dumplings (Xiao Long Bao)  in my opinion are the closest to the ones in Shanghai. Now here is the thing the fried soup dumplings (not sure of the actual name in Chinese) we have never found in the US are amazing here and just like the ones we had in Shanghai.  The owner who works in the kitchen is from Shanghai and makes the dumplings himself if you get there late they will be sold out of the fried ones.  I am almost always the only white person here so you know the food is good!   A few of the other things we always order is the Lamb Cumin and the Beef Roll also very good.

Most of the places we have found that have Xiao Long Bao the wrapping is thick, sticky and stale.  The trick to these dumplings is the wrapping is thin and it has to have an even mixture so the flavors fully come through or it is just a waste of time.  The wrapper here is so thin if you have heavy hands you will tear the wrapper and all the soup comes out!  Party Foul!!!!  So be very gentle picking it up put it softly in your soup spoon and bite a little off the top to let it cool.  Pour a bit of black vinegar in the opening and add your ginger to your liking.  Now If you let them sit too long in the tin they will start to stick to the bottom and the whole experience is ruined because you will never get any soup.  The pan Fried dumplings are thicker, bigger and have more meat in it.  You do not have to be careful picking these up but still gentle.  Do not let these sit to long either or the soup will absorb into the breading.

This place is a bit hard to find the name of the restaurant is written in chinese it is on the second floor kinda heading towards the back.  I just park of the second floor and head right in.  This is an authentic chinese restaurant so if you want nice waiters and tables that are constantly being bussed then this isn't your place.

They don't really serve the traditional Dim Sum with the metal carts.  The menu calls some of their dishes Dim Sum.

There was only one server running his tail off. He brought me complimentary hot tea, the food, and the bill.  Those were the only times he came to my table.

The Beef Roll was okay.  There were 2 rolls on a plate which were sliced.  The sliced beef was unusual.  The beef and cilantro were rolled in a grilled wrap.  I used a lot of chili paste to give it flavor.

The 8 steamed hot soup dumplings were okay.  This was the first time I have had something like this.  I was prepared for the soup to squirt out as I bit into the dumpling.

Also, the steamed soup dumplings that everyone raved about.... definitely just a 3. Have you tried these dumplings in NYC or LA? Honestly, they are incomparable. 

My visit here was still very much rewarding because I devoured their noodles in black bean sauce. I've always been a big fan of this dish, but many Chinese restaurants tend to screw it up... making it too bland or too salty. They did a great job here! The noodles were sticking together a bit too much, but that didn't stop me from finishing the entire bowl! It was delicious. 

My other favorite item had to be their hot and sour soup. Not too salty, great flavor, hearty, generous portion, and it certainly made me happy :). 

For a Chinese restaurant, the food took WAYYY too long. The hot and sour soup came first, but not for a little while. Probably at least 10-15 minutes. Soup at a Chinese restaurant is usually at your table within the first couple minutes tops. It took another 10 minutes or so for the noodles with black bean sauce. Thank goodness this dish was so damn good, otherwise I would've gotten irritated at how much longer the dumplings took. Once the dumplings got there, we realized we are getting pretty full. Then, perhaps 30 minutes after the dumplings arrived, when we were pretty much done eating, the beef roll was put on our table. Ummm... oops. Forgot we even ordered that! We technically should've just sent it back politely letting them know that we are done eating already, and over 45 minutes for a not-so-complex dish is unacceptable. Instead, we went the more civil route and boxed it up to take home. 

So overall, the prices here are fair, the ambiance is average (definitely doesn't feel like a Chinese restaurant though), and the mood is pretty dull. The workers were super unfriendly, swamped with only a few tables, and inattentive. They have a lot to work on, but some of their dishes are so good that they're worth going back for.",WpZTKVU09--Fb2qFneqkZg,0,0,3,VBvK4n4AaVmIF54G6nxTfA

The place was clean and the staff was helpful.  The first time we came, they only had two high chairs for kids.  We had 3 babies that needed high chairs.  Luckily, one of our friends brought their portable infant seat, so no problems.  The reason why I mentioned this is that the 2nd time we went, the week after, they had 5 high chairs.  Talk about addressing the customer's needs.  =)

We had the Pork Dumpling with Supreme soup.  This is basically a pork dumpling that has broth/soup inside and comes out when you bite into it.  I normally pick up the dumpling and put it into a soup spoon, so I don't lose the broth when I bite into it.  It lets me slurp up the broth that falls into the spoon after.  My buddy puts the dumpling into a small bowl, so that the broth doesn't escape.  To each their own.  =)  I found the broth tasty and the dumpling delicious.  Note, this is the first time I have tried this dish anywhere, so I have nothing to compare it to.  Regardless, my taste buds liked it.  =) 

We got the Pork Dumpling with Supreme soup combination, which lets you pick from one of four soups they offer, I think...  I had the hot and sour soup.  The first week, it wasn't sour enough and was kinda bland.  The 2nd time it was fine for me.  I'll have to come back and see if they get consistent.  However, the bowl size is pretty large and just for an extra $1 with the combination, I'm not complaining.

Another dish we tried was the twice cooked pork.  If you like pork belly, do not get grossed out with fat, and not health conscious, I suggest you try this dish.  The pork belly and tofu is thinly sliced an tastes so good.  It is served in black bean sauce I think, so it has a slightly salty taste.  Note, it is normally served spicy, but we asked that the dish not be served spicy.

If you are looking for a comprehensive dim sum with carts of piping hot dim sum navigating the tight spaces between tables, this place is not one of them. However, if you're looking for some authentic Shanghai style dim sum and food, definitely check this place out.

We ended up ordering an order of Shanghai Style Noodle and  3 different style dim sum, Pan Fried Xiao Long Bao, Steam Xiao Long Bao and Fried Pork & Vegetable Dumpling. 

All the dishes were good and it did take a while for our dish to arrive so I can only surmise that the dumplings were made/cook to order? It tasted as much as the dumplings where hot and juicy but the wrappers where not soggy, a tell-tell sign of frozen dumplings. 

The dish that stood out the most and highly recommended was the Pan Fried Xiao Long Bao. I've never had these before so when the waiter brought them out, I was a bit surprised. They didn't look like the usual steamed ones I'm accustomed to eating.

 Instead, these look like tiny little Hum Baos with sesame sea and chives on top. Once you bite into them, the soup begins to ooze out. I can't stop thinking about them.

Their dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) are to die for.  They offer them steamed or pan-fried.  Both varieties are good, but I prefer the steamed, as the pan-fried are much larger and seem to be more wrapper, making it harder to enjoy the flavor of the pork filling.  We've loved every variety that we've tried, Shang hai style (pork), house, seafood, and lamb.  The pork belly is so freaking good too.   I enjoy their beef roll pie, which is a green onion pancake stuffed with beef & fresh cilantro, but be warned that it is very filling.  If you order any of their combo dishes, you get a choice of soup with your dish : hot & sour, beef noodle curry, or tofu noodle curry.  I'm a big fan of the beef noodle curry.

Be very careful when eating the steamed dumplings; they come out VERY fresh and VERY hot.  My technique is to poke a small hole in the top to allow it to cool for a minute before attempting to eat it.

This place is such a great value, as every time we come we pig out, but when the bill comes it's so cheap for all of the delicious dumplings that we put away.

I'd been wanting to try Three Village for quite some time ever since I'd read some of the extremely positive reviews of their XLB or Soup Dumplings as us normal people call them (kidding).   I used to frequent China Mama regularly and really loved their version, so I was excited to try these as they seem to be more popular.  I ordered the Shanghai Soup Dumpling Combo with The Beef Curry Noodle Soup, and my friend ordered some noodle dish that I can't find any evidence of what it was called here on the site.  I should have paid more attention.  He got the Hot and Sour soup just so he could be different from me.  We also shared a Beef Roll.

First up was my soup in a much larger than I anticipated bowl.  I figured since it was part of the combo special it'd be a small serving.  I actually thought they might have made a mistake and brought out the same soup for my friend and I thinking we'd ordered the same kind.  It had a great mild curry flavor, and had quite a bit of noodle and not enough beef for my liking, but is there EVER enough beef for my liking?  Really loved the flavor on this.  Next came the soup dumplings and my friend's noodle dish at once, so now we were certain they'd forgotten his hot and sour soup.  I wasn't quite ready to bring it up.  Naturally I loved the soup dumplings.  They were every bit as good as I remember the China Mama version, but the advantage Three Village has is that they seemed more carefully made.  At Mama I had a lot of experience with dumplings that would burst open upon merely being touched by a chopstick, and the wrapper would just seem almost too thin and soft if that's even possible.  Many a shirt have been ruined by myself there.  Here, I didn't have one soup spillage incident.  Every single dumpling made it to my spoon for me to carefully bite the small hole into it myself.  Same great taste, less ruined shirts.  PLUS, I got to see my friend attempt to just simply pop one into his mouth even as I warned him against it.  I really wish I hated my friend so I could have enjoyed this experience more.  I'd advise anyone to bring their most hated enemy that doesn't know about soup dumplings to do this

Moving on, I really liked my friend's noodle dish as well.  It had all kinds of ingredients that I could see, including but not limited to tofu and I believe shrimp?  If I don't order it, I don't pay enough attention.   I really thought I'd find a pic of it in the pictures here on yelp, but no.   Then came my friend's hot and sour soup and the beef roll.   I wasn't too fond of his soup.  I explained I prefer it to be much more vinegary as I'm used to it at potentially more Americanized Chinese restaurants.  He said this was more traditional.   I don't know if I should believe a man who didn't even know how to eat soup dumplings, but okay.  It wasn't by any means bad, but I just like more SOUR in my hot and sour soup that I don't think this provided.  The beef roll was magical.  I'd had this dish several times at Mama but I gotta say I much prefer this version.  Much less greasy, but with all the amazing flavor I recall.  A must order.

Service was friendly, fast, and efficient.  The only extremely minor gripe might be the order in which the food came out seemed haphazard and random, but really when all the food is as good as it was, I didn't really mind.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,5,yp9lEeeh7lX1PQsGrDKteQ

I'm a big fan of the beef rolls here, especially since they are consistently crispy on the outside unlike noodle pot which is hit or miss depending on how busy.  The shanghai fried noodles were flavorful and the pork in the dish is really tender.  The xiao long bao is also better than Wendy's...so all in all solid place for food.  The downside is the service....don't get me wrong very friendly server....but it was one guy serving 9 tables.  Not just serving the tables, but seating, cleaning the tables, grabbing the check...refilling water....it felt like a real life version of the cooking mama game.  Despite the slow service, I'd still return for the food.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,5,1,4,lYK17bVviWMjCcCFHAbsPA

Like several other places I've been to in Vegas, they only take cash.  If they took credit cards, I'd give another star.",VKFsJOGLn0l_8dNYLthRqA,0,0,3,K2fKGQ7LmrOHO4YcnPPxnw

I've been back here a number of times since with my friends and we like to order the beef rolls and the xiao long bao. It's very fragile and hot so when you pick it up to eat, you have to be very careful.

Otherwise, the service has been better. When I get the cravings for beef rolls, I head here.

If you want to pay with a credit card, there's a $20 minimum charge. Too high. :(",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,4,O_ZVj1FfiyHDvqrzBTlDtQ

For this special combo you get to select one of three soup or soup noodles (Fried Tofu Thin Noodle Soup, Curry Beef Thin Noodle Soup or Hot & Sour Soup) plus another select menu items, such as Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup, Sliced Beef Roll, Pan Fried Pork Bun.  The portions are generous and you will definitely be full and satisfy selecting one of the All Day Special Combo.

Review of the food:
Fried Tofu Thin Noodle Soup - The broth is pleasant and mild, didn't cared much for the fried tofu pieces as garnish.
Curry Beef Thin Noodle Soup - Nice flavor with subtle curry taste.
Pork Dumpling with Supreme Soup - Not the greatest I have had, but perhaps one of the best available in Las Vegas, it is however definitely the best for the price.
Sliced Beef Roll - tastes good and fairly comparable to those offered at China Mama's, but I think the portion is more generous here.

Décor - almost none, except the lucky Buddha statue at the entrance.  1/5

Capacity - seats roughly 80 people, with 5 large round tables and 7 small 4-tops.

Service - Friendly, but you can tell they are barely keeping up with the demand of the busy restaurant. 3.5/5

Value - Fair to good. 3.5/5

Taste - Good.  4/5",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,6,4,2HYAqGSh45RUnur-VtAThA

And because the sign isn't in English, I was expecting authentic Chinese food that would transport me back to China.  Maybe I ordered the wrong items, because it was just OK.  I have had freshly made xiao long bao, and these did not taste fresh at all.  

The service, however, was the most disappointing part.  There was only 1 other table besides my family in the restaurant, and every time I attempted to get 1 of the 2 servers' attention, it was like hailing a cab in New York City.  They were just too busy talking to each other.  I am used to not so warm service in Chinese restaurants, but being completely ignored is unacceptable.",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,0,0,2,Ot8MAZnNTocPfjdIPrAFBw
