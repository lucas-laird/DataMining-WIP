Being from San Diego, CA I absolutely love authentic Mexican food and this place is the closest to what I would get back home. Tons of options and the last time my girlfriend and I went in, we found out they have a vegan burrito for a super awesome price. We tried it out and got it enchilada style and oh my goodness it was the size of my arm and so flavorful. Their salsas are incredible as well. Housemade pico de gallo, super fresh verde sauce, a smoky spicy red and a habanero sauce that's sure to get you reaching for more. We will definitely be back! Thank you habaneros

The taste was good not something to wow about but still had a good taste. It did take a while for the employees to come to the front counter and help us, I actually had to waive to the surveillance cameras for them to see me. Besides that, my tacos seemed to be thrown together fairly quickly and without much thought. I actually had some pieces of different meat scattered around my plate. My true rating would be a 3.5 but without that being available, this quick eat is better than 3 rating hence my 4 rating. Hope this helps!",WHsHvBxOZUbiHNZgffCjtw,0,0,4,_RzG8v4hZRwIgaGOZ1AemQ

I walked in there was nobody on the inside so I walked straight to the counter...there was nobody there. After about 2 mins Richard tells me he will be right with me. When he does come up I let him know I'm there for a pickup. He tells me ok the hadn't started I'll need to wait 10 mins keep in mind it was phoned in and was supposed to be ready by 9:40 it was now 9:45. At 9:48 they marked the food ready to go but no food. At 9:55 after watching 3 people come and go and cars go through the drive through I walk up again and Richard says how can I help u. I was like um I'm with doordash im here for a delivery he said oh yeah it will be 10 mins we have people ahead of you... I just about lost it I messaged support where they informed me they would call and find out. Once off the phone Richard tells me they didn't seem to be concerned. I was infuriated by this because it was just rude. He then tells me he's not worried about it either it's his uncles place and it's not a big deal to him either. I waited for another 10mins before finally getting the food. I asked for the managers name he said his uncle owned it I said ok my I have his number he said he doesn't have one. So I decided to put it all on social media. And I will be filing a formal complaint with the BBB . One service alone I would never eat there I don't care how good the food was. Richard if that's what his name really was should no be allowed to assist people in my opinion because that's not how people should be treated.

But I've come by a couple of times and never seem to get an itemized receipt. The ""daily special"" bacon breakfast burrito never seems to ring up the same price twice.

I tend to order it everytime even when I intend  to order a new dish. Their shredded chicken is juicy, fresh and incredibly spiced. 

Just today I ordered the Carnitas plate. It came with this huge, thick and awesome flour tortilla. The Carnitas almost melted in my mouth and I think I ascended to my ancestors where I was welcomed with open arms. It was so perfect and no other place comes close to the quality. I definitely recommend it. 

Feeling cheap? Dollar tacos on Tuesdays and Monday's. These aren't some Taco Bell bullshit tacos. These are real, juicy and perfectly fried tacos. They use this thick corn tortilla and add a bunch of grilled chicken or beef. My wife's even loves this place and she's the pickiest eater in the world.

Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is they have HOT chile. So many Mexican places have this tomatoe soup for chile and it sucks. Habaneros has habanero chile! It tastes amazing as well and being genuinely hot.",YhiCPAdwUd8IrDHGbQBxrQ,0,0,5,ftxYilUiszEbG0K4Vq35wA

All chairs were up so we weren't sure if it was even open.
The food took forever to be ready!
Customer service was decent, not that great.

Food is okay. The way it was packaged was good.

I asked for the salsa that was already packaged and they told me to get my own from the salsa bar.
But the one in the salsa bar had stuff inside it and I dont like that, my pickiness kicked in.
The cucumber looked dry and old.
Same as the radish.

He could have just given me the packaged salsa from the fridge. It was going to take more than a second.

I rather make the drive to Pepe's tacos.",tGuMHXSvqcLTA7rifH_3_w,0,1,3,BZJweds1KbnM3iTpBqiOAg

Food wasn't prepared properly, Cheese not melted so the stuck it in the microwave and melted the Styrofoam plate to my food and ruined my lettuce.  Overcharged me but already ran my card so I just said keep it.  Twice in a row I ordered to eat in and they boxed it to go. Super Combos come with drink but worker didn't think combo meals were super combo but he didn't know what a super combo is.  Won't go back.",Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA,1,0,1,jvfNPcWzeS2HjduMBulGHg

Menudo was large enough to share also. We got cheesecake and two churros I recommend the churros.
