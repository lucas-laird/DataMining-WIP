Great flour tortillas, fatty sized. Love that they do potato tacos! SoCal style, like my favorite Snapper Jacks would make. Living here locally, I actually go out of my to the Palms to grab either a burrito or a few tacos. I have no clue why the other reviewer compared it to Chipotle, who I think is way overrated. Oh, and since I can't stand that cilantro white rice, I'm glad they also serve good ol Spanish style rice! Oh and for meat eaters, I'm told their tortas are xcellent.
So, locals and visitors, if you want no frills,SoCal style Mexican food, stop by Chronic Tacos in the Palms casino. Or, if your in SoCal, they have quote a few locations.",wK2zqc_uBocyU8rb-rurFQ,1,1,5,64X8zG6fw5Vfr7lgkPrU2w

Service is what killed it for me. Middle-aged Asian lady who had been building my bowl for me asked me as I was paying, ""did you get fajitas veggies?"" I replied, ""no."" And she said, ""because it's an extra charge. Are you sure?"" I asked her if she was accusing me of lying and then her other co-worker came over and I said that she can double check with her but I did not get the super fancy veggies.

I should not be treated this way just because the 3 ppl who work there are not organized. They should mark down if ppl get extras like guac or fajitas vegs if they are so concerned. Their system is flawed and their customers pay for it.

Wow been to chronic tacos many times in Newport Beach area and never have I had such a bad experience. I do not appreciate this kind of suspicious attitude towards the patrons here.

You'll see an awesome gothic neon sign in the Palm Casino's Eatery, aka food court, that reads Chronic Tacos. There's a chipotlesque assembly line that offers tacos, burritos, and burrito bowls.  I tried the al pastor burrito ($7) with Spanish rice, black beans, cilantro, cheese, pico de gallo, salsa verde.  Sadly, I forgot to ask for sour cream. 

The al pastor roasting spike was nowhere in sight, and the spiced pork came from a collecting bin. The pork had little depth of flavor, but the bits of pineapple added bursts of sweet brightness. The rest of the burrito was pretty decent and filling. 

The cashier lady told me they didn't do water cups, and told me to go to Earl of Sandwich next door. But my friend got a water cup from Chronic Taco... hmmmmm. 

In conclusion, if you're in the mood for Mexican and you find yourself in Palm's, then Chronic Taco is not a bad choice.  Don't forget there's also Earl's though!  They got awesome sandwiches, and water cups!",lmh3fL1LYx-DXIY0znmo7A,1,0,3,PvC4twyo3-Tb4x26Ox2fvg

At first glance, what I take this place to be is a place similar to Chipotle and Qdoba by telling the first person what you want, and then going in a line to pick which specific fillings you want in your dish. It seems a little different, and so I thought I should give it a try, why not right? Here, they offer two different kinds of rice, 2 different kinds of beans I believe, and the rest is honestly similar to Chipotle and Qdoba by picking cheese, lettuce, etc. The people helping me out seemed a little impatient and not necessarily happy to be there, and so that was just a little bit annoying to deal with. Compared to Chipotle, I like Chipotle a lot better, and generally, the service is a little bit better too. I more than likely wouldn't come back here, due to similar prices compared to Chipotle and the food is not more authentic than any other place that offers Mexican food.

So, I got the soft shell with pork.  The meat was the driest I've probably had in my life.  Tasted like it had been sitting there for a week.

5056972,2013-05-16,0,ZAqgv1gply0m_4fHAIffWA,"Located inside the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino. Chronic Tacos opened their 2nd location in Las Vegas this past Monday. Never having tried Chronic, I decided to give it a go since it's nearby.
The spot looked nice enough. Prices reasonable. I got the burrito with Al Pastor, and made it a meal. The meal included chips, salsa, rice, beans & a drink. Came out to $10 which isn't too bad. They had no trays available since I was dining in, so I had to carry 4 separate things to a table.
The burrito(pun intended) was a fatty! It was almost as wide as it was long. It's what I would imagine I'd look like if I was a burrito. The meal sides of spanish rice & pinto beans were decent tasting. The burrito alone probably would have sufficed. I only finished about half of the meal and had to take the rest home. I asked the lady at the Chronic register if I could get a plastic bag to carry my stuff home and she said they had none. Odd.
Except for no trays or plastic takeout bags it was good. I will have to go back and give a few of the other options a try. They had a good selection of meats/seafood to choose from. Steak, chicken, fish, shrimp and even veggie, to name a few.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,1,0,3,4MZd5GoBBgV-143eZxKbig

What you have here is them covering up their lack of quality with an attempt at mexican spices which they fail at.  I'm a white guy but living in vegas I know mexican and southwestern food...and this is a laughing stock if thats what you call it.  This is food for dumb americans.  Its completely inauthentic.  And they literally call themselves mexican food...at least chipotle doesn't do that.  

They drench their food in lime and spices to cover up the fact that its got no real flavor or quality.  Its pathetic.  And somehow theyre more expensive than chipotle!  And yet they skimp on ingredients and its obvious that this place is incredibly cheap when it comes to quality.  When I ordered there and asked for peppers they gave me a tiny spoonful of what were overcooked shrivelled up pathetic looking peppers that were obviously day old.  Disguisting.  I had to ask for new ones and wait for them to make them.  

Then when I tasted the food I was astonished that all I tasted was lime juice and red pepper.  I absolutely love lime but my god theres a limit people.  

I tried going back a second time and getting something else but didnt even make it through the ordering process because when I was asking about the ingredients I was getting completely different answers than I had from the first person who served me....super sketchy...you don't even know what your eating its completely untrustworthy.

First, they were out of quite a few items.   Now I understand if it were later at night but it was 7pm.  They should not be out of carne asada at this time.   I think that that's an item you must keep constantly stocked on a Friday at 7pm.

Also the line they kept the food in was a little disheveled and dirty looking.   I know it gets busy especially if there's any event at the pearl but cleanliness is important.   The guy tried to clean up a little but then didn't change his gloves to start touching the food again.

My experience reminded me of a less healthy, less flavorful, less quality wannabe Chipotle. They should change the name to ""Chronic cold burritos"" because that is what they sold me. The canned beans, meat and rice were cold and I questioned the health standards by the looks of meat sitting in a tin uncovered and exposed. This joint was a hot mess as their store bought packages of tortillas lay all around and meat, cheese, salsa were all over the place, you would think that one of the 10 motionless employees standing back there would think to wipe up the residue and food scraps laying all over the damn place. I am beyond disappointed and want my money back for the two burritos we bought as I feel ripped off. 

The service sucks ass and is not the friendly excited crew that you would think Steve-O would have operate his joint. This staff had the personality of a Nun being presented with a dildo, it lacked enthusiasm or any sort of care in the world. Just because you have tattoos does not make you automatically cool, I have a few as well big deal so what I like to draw on myself.

Store bought tortillas heated up and stuffed with canned beans, cold meat and hard tasteless rice does not settle right on my stomach. This was our first and last visit to this joint. We will continue giving Chipotle our business, where the food is hot, fresh, tasty and clean that comes with great service.
