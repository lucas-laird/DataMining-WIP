It was busier than expected. I sat down and it took about 20 minutes for anyone to take our drink orders. I didn't mind waiting at the time because I was with family and took it as bonding time before dinner. We flagged our waitress down because she wouldn't come even close to our table to take our orders. Takes over an hour to bring the first plate to our table. Then another plate every ten minutes it seemed like. Our family ate one at a time. The food was either over cooked, under cooked or no flavor at all. I had the garlic shrimp that were just bathed in butter with no garlic flavor at all. Our shrimp empanadas were sent back because they were still frozen in the middle. Then the bacon wrapped shrimp were beyond fried dry. I was upset and let them know but from what I was told there was no manager on site at the time. I had a horrible time there.

990830,2010-12-28,0,ti1bb30WwnkDLuVvpTM6fQ,"Seafood/Fish is a food I'm trying to eat more of.  I recently had family in town and a cousin of mine that lives here recommended this place to my brother-in-law.  So we drove to the Mariscos Las Islitas on North Pecos.  It is located in the Town Square shopping plaza.  I wasn't sure what to expect but since I was trying to discover seafood I figured what the heck.  

I was blown away not only by the portions but by how delicious the fish was.  I had the grilled salmon.  The menu confused me a bit.  I thought I had ordered something else but was so glad I got what I did.  The fish was tender and the grilled parts of the fish added that fresh grilled taste from a bbq grill.  It was accompanied with rice with veggies mixed in (sooo good) and with steamed vegetables.  I couldn't eat it all so I brought the rest home.  I have been craving more fish since then.  

The only thing I didn't care for was the guys (musicians) looking to perform while you ate.  Once you tell them no thank you they leave you alone.  Not a deal breaker to have them there I just don't care for it.  The prices may be a little intimidating.  I paid $15.00 for my grilled salmon.  While a bit on the pricey side for my range I was ok with it since I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.

The staff is super friendly. I can't wait to go back.",Q5XeE2gkRJ_gbNc46bc5uA,1,1,5,CPE5i7JKkt_ZtjNCk0oTPA

We arrived and were seated immediately! Tables were already set up and just had to add a couple more as more family members showed up! Had drink orders and appetizers on the table quickly! Had Mariachi music blaring in my ear! It was great! :)

Finally our food arrived! My niece and I both ordered the Seafood Molcajete and the Carne Molcajete! So we could taste each others dish! They were huge! Everything was delicious! Everything we ordered was great! The oysters, Agua Chiles, and an appetizer with avocado and shrimp that was really good! 

Great service from the waitress! She was very quick with our requests and dishes! The Mariachi was great too! 15 dollars a song! You bet they were singing their hearts out!

I ordered a Tostada De Camaron (cosido) and Tostada De Ceviche (de camaron)
However, I didn't eat the ceviche since it was straight raw shrimp! Don't get me wrong, I love a good shrimp ceviche but it has to be marinated in lime juice (aka ""cooked"" in the citrus) But if you're ok with the raw shrimp, you'll probably love it. The presentation of it was perfect, with red onions & avocado...
The actual cooked camaron tostada was horrible!! No flavor whatsoever!! No salt, no lime, no salsa, nothing!! It simply taste like they just boiled the shrimp in water and threw it on the tostada with chopped cucumbers and tomatoes... I must've added at least 4 lemon slices with half a tsp of salt and still did nothing to give that tostada any flavor...

3600159,2011-07-01,1,ti1bb30WwnkDLuVvpTM6fQ,"Yet another dissappointment in my quest to find Mexican food with soul...

Not far from The Broadacres Swap Meet, we drive towards this big sign that reads"" Las Islitas Mariscos Estillo Nayarit""...The Region of Nayarit, Mexico is well known for their seafood specialities, so we thought
This has gotta be good!

The first good sign-a PACKED parking Lot

We step inside, I'm hoping not to see abuelita upfront making tortillas a mano(fingers crossed)-YES! another good sign....

Instead, tables are packed with the majority being Hispanics(Go where the locals go,right?) and not one, not two, but THREE different bands are going table to table(2 Mariachi bands and 1 Ranchero Band) taking song requests as you dine.

Service staff are hustling in and out of the kitchen with all kinds of seafood specialities trying to get orders to the guests ASAP....We finally get sat at a tiny booth in the corner and I'm eager to see the menu.

So we decide on a mixed seafood Campechana-seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, oysters, and abalone, and a plate of Pulpitos, or sauteed baby octopus as suggested by our waitress.

I guess the dissapointment set in after the first bite. Both dishes looked better than they tasted....the octopus was rubbery from being overcooked.

The Campechana tasted watered down and lacked flavor even with all that seafood inside. we kept having to season it with condiments on our table. Even worse was the unadvertised addition of imitation
crab meat!

Did we order the wrong things? Kitchen have an off day?  Hard to say,but hard to say if this restaurant does Nayarit any justice...ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,3,1,2,IhTC21XPraPqO6Shk80UAw

*Almost always busy, the wait time to be seated could be a while but people still wait. You can tell the employees want to get their customers seated as quickly as possible.
*There's live mariachi playing so this is no place to have an extensive conversation with someone... it is however, great for charades and miming. More like a big happy family eatery.
*The waitress we had would take a bit, but that just may be because of how busy it was when we went (Sunday). They did take our drink and food order quickly.
*Food presentation is fantastic, they use different kinds of platters, bowls and even a big Mexican mortar is used to serve some dishes.",-vTyk14-nNsK_ELozcNz8g,0,0,3,_Urvx5ZQWkbxxR62sooWvw

I order a molcajetes it came out still cooking, it was so good.  They have the best micheladas I have ever had!!!!!

5246459,2015-02-27,0,ti1bb30WwnkDLuVvpTM6fQ,"Well... don't come here expecting a fancy seafood restaurant, they have plastic silverware. However, I really enjoy the seafood from there and I hope it's clean. I always order the shrimp tostadas (they have a good selection of bottled salsas) and the camaron al aguachile.  Every time I go there I have to drink a Pacifico preparada (similar to a bloody mary but replace the vodka with beer). In my opinion, they have the best preparadas in town. 

There are three different locations, most are in the Northern side of town. I would definitely go more often if they had a location that was closer. They also have a band play or guitarists that will sing you a song.",PMH1nqUza6ODLWbojaw18A,0,1,4,Nq2rmq_YxEyN9_iBQeBJ5w

We had the Piña mix seafood and the shrimp empanadas with the ""free"" deep fried ice cream (just for checking in on Yelp).  Didn't really care for the Piña since the pineapple made the dish a little sweeter than I liked.  The wife enjoyed the empanadas with her Micheladas.  Our daughter had the carne burritos, but nothing to write home about.  All in all... 2.5-3 stars due to slow, but nice service.   At least they had a couple of big screens on the wall playing the NBA finals and international soccer games.  

However, 2 for 1 Micheladas will most likely have the wife and in-laws wanting to frequent this joint, but I think my daughter and I will say... ""thank you, but no thank you please"".",Mv55A30nEcAl3vk4qow5dA,1,0,3,9GK3Uyw1DiytDHZG8XP39w

The food is decent nice proportions ok priced. We normally get shrimp ceviche, shrimp coctel, and oysters. This time around my mom got some fish tacos which looked really good. The shrimp empanadas are also pretty good. 

The only thing I hate about this place is when they have music. They got a jukebox and most of the time 2 or so groups playing music. If you're sitting in the middle you can hear the jukebox and the bands playing. All that makes it so loud you have to talk very loud for the people to hear you.",Lqa-U3bSO1wtYXnHLLjXCg,2,2,4,wf87t0sddnM4J9rDtY-ZUg

The food is great, except the customer service does need some help. Perhaps they were just a little short staffed.


Agauchiles, oysters, shrimp tacos is what I had :)",XSHj15tElZSv-TTKNH3pgw,1,0,4,5qYJAPLJ1iljpTDhV-ixnA
