159101,2015-12-20,0,dMEo-GjWAmTVzq3_qeQX2g,Just because this location is in a mall on the Strip doesn't justify charging almost $2 more than other locations in town. That's theft. No wonder no one was there during lunch! Even Subway across the court is reasonable. For what Wendys charges you may as well go to Nordstrom Cafe instead.,9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,1,3,43QTAXh98QPziAUweAOGtg

Their chicken nuggets tasted as awesome as they normally do and so did the frosty. If you need that quick Wendy's fix when your on the strip and your strapped for cash, this place is a winner! 5th star is for being right across the street from the hotel where I had stayed (Wynn).",LmeLBoWlOVMRgcNQtBGzCQ,1,1,5,pUkQuCVDNL-BJcJExns38w

There were five people behind the counter . One was on her phone , the other 4 were laughing and telling jokes about a previous customer they didn't like. They were standing in a circle talking while there were 4 orders on the screen that hadn't been touched !!! 

They scowled at a girl who asked for a refund because they were taking so long. They also lost our orders, so they asked to see our receipts so they knew what to make after standing there for 20 mins.

Perfect description of worst customer service ever.!",SucyL03Ejr0QqjR7BX8-5A,1,0,1,68Xmdvq1NoiwdRoViqtfxg

I'll get a burger with everything, burger with mustard, chicken sandwich...  Definition of Durp. Their receipts print the taunting statement of ""Concerns please call"" and no number.",_5tVs8qUE-HgcpDmWO3Vtw,0,0,1,Wxkaj-w5PvM-xXxz3UXvhA

I go around eating at many places in the mall. This is one of my favorite places! I visit them frequently.


Most of the staff already knows my order. I am treated very well with every visit.

The quality of food is very equal to any other Wendy's location. 

I've never had bad service at this location. All the employees are friendly, & efficient. 

There are some negative aspects to visiting this location. The prices are higher than any location I've ever visited. Another bad thing is 99% of the time they don't have trays, so you get your food in a bag, even if you're dining in.

It's a great place to get a meal, at a reasonable price, if you're staying in the area.",VNYmMD-TYQM0qXdrA_Omhg,0,0,4,O2BKYihHt2LPQAGPUEgnVA
2056813,2017-02-08,8,dMEo-GjWAmTVzq3_qeQX2g,"I was starving.

I saw the poor reviews, yet I was to the point of starvation that I was contemplating chewing on my arm which is why I came here.

I am glad I did because my food was fresh, hot and tasty.  I had the spicy chicken sandwich.

Customer service was friendly.

Yes the prices are higher than a regular Wendy's, but you are at the airport.  It's to be expected.",VZdjfp53dguI6xDjz7AQxg,9,9,4,v5nBAVHBaZWOUaSbgsJHcg

I ordered a jr bacon cheeseburger to hold me over for dinner and it took 20 min. Insane!!!!  I should've got a frosty cone and called it a day. Not to mention the woman to the side of me kept coughing without covering her mouth. ALL reasons I dislike large crowds, especially at the mall. Bunch of mongaloids work here. I shouldn't be so mean, but Christ on a cracker. At least the woman on her cell phone apologized about the long wait. Now that's GREAT customer service. 
Less talky and more communication would be even better.",UsnVveOndIxCpxvHARI8AA,0,0,3,aAqUQ_E1MjRuFLhaQlPr4w

Service was really fast, though. Food tasted alright.

Not much else to say, lol. Sorry.",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,0,0,2,J4I_qjPUyJdD-l7V5BgaIg

4072231,2015-04-27,1,dMEo-GjWAmTVzq3_qeQX2g,"I love Wendy's but this was ridiculous. There was at least 8 people I front of me waiting to order their food and the cashier was so clueless. If it was his first day then I understand but at least have someone help him. I waited exactly 20 mins to order. And then I had to get a new drink because he was holding my cup with his hand inside the cup and rubbing inside of it. Gross. Then no one made fries. He said I had to wait for someone to put the fries on. Like if you see 10+ people waiting in line, wouldn't you make fries? I've been a returning customer because I love Wendy's. I've seen it when the letter grading was a ""B"" and a ""C"" rating. Now it's an ""A"" but it'll probably change. There's even a guy who works there that wears a SnapBack hat. Not a Wendy's hat.",pJkyXoBe6yjBP-hyhxvSTg,0,0,1,dAr7qv1vrap1jEU9wQPOqQ

I thought I'd eat some and save some for later.  Nope, I ate the whole thing at one sitting; the fries were too healthy and not that great.  I asked the cashier for a handful of ketchup.  She told me I couldn't.  Turned out to be a mean joke lol.  And Vegas food prices are ridiculously expensive.",bN25cOkFDluT1NjMNkWqAQ,1,0,4,hcZO7hIcWxhqrp3XgpfogA
5853802,2017-07-11,0,dMEo-GjWAmTVzq3_qeQX2g,"My wife and I ordered food from here just because all the other food places were too busy. We're literally the only customers, there were 4 employees. 2 guys in the back making the burgers, 1 guy texting on his phone while making fries, and 1 lady to take orders and pretend to be manager.
Our orders came 15 minutes later, the burger guys handed my sandwich over to the fries guy
While the fries guy was texting, he threw my sandwich over his shoulder. Wth. One of those guys that just work just to say they work, end up working in a fast food joint for the rest of his life type of guys, anyways. If the manager doesn't care about his actions, shows a lot about an establishment.
