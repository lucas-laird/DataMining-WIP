If its after dark either dont go alone, or eat in your car!",qCr6cLbNFJsr9U26DspXwQ,0,0,4,xmaemA_NJElcd-7Ra0IRUA

I don't know how many of y'all have gone to Nayarit and had real authentic mariscos, but this place legit meets all that and more. Tejuino! Aguachile! Empanadas de camaron! Oh man, they have it all. The tacos: made with fresh masa tortillas to the order. Can't get a better burrito in Las Vegas then right here. I constantly take spontaneous drives out here all the way from Los Angeles! Worth it every time. 10/10 5 stars.",wg3TELCakuSKj0OUdmey1g,0,0,5,9JRxMh2Bg6RJPPcHzOU4dQ
