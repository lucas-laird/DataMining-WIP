Prices are reasonable, store is clean, and service is friendly. However, service also speaks limited English, so you may need to use hand gestures to order. 

Minus one star because the parking lot is dangerous: not because it's a sketchy area (it's fine), but the spaces are tiny and the lot has narrow entrance/exits, without signs.

The inside is surprisingly clean and I question whether it's from lack of customers or because an employee is going around frequently sweeping the floors and wiping down the tables. 

I ordered the mango banana oatmeal sweetened with honey. While I was sitting down waiting for my smoothie to be made, the male employee asked me if he should use juice or milk and I told him whatever the recipe calls for. He pulls out a book to see how to make the smoothie.

When I tasted the smoothie, the ratios were off. There was too much ice which made every ingredient taste watered down and gave the smoothie a slush like consistency. I could hardly make out the banana or mango and even though the menu says sweetened with honey it tasted artificially sweetened. 

The lack of fresh fruits and low quality ingredients make the smoothies taste icy  and artificial.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,2,1,2,r8gGZBTyTHWdyPAhsK6KBw

Smoothies: ""All Berries""  delicious and so is the ""Strawberry Bannana.""  The taste is natural and healthy.The Mango Banana is also delicious! Honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of their smoothies. 

Chicken Buffalo Panini....so toasty and cheesy! This is by far my favorite! All of their sandwiches are amazing but this one is particular is a MUST. It's got a little kick of spice, the chicken is nice and tender and the balsamic not too strong-PERFECFT! I came here with coworkers about a year ago and they all were beyond satisfied with their food and this second time of me coming, nothing has changed.

Not bad, but I do think for it's size a nice can of soda could go well with it as a combo.

They always have their lunch specials displayed and their employees are always super nice. I've been wanting to try their raspados however they are kind of costly for a drink I would get in L.A. for about a $1.00 

Great for a quick lunch or quick lunch date. Community is kind of ghetto and plaza is located in a super small and confusing parking lot.

4142232,2013-08-27,7,5TeA1dyLR7MIor-DfIrYog,"Cherry Berries is a cute little cafe!  I grew up on this side of town and remember that nothing cute or new ever moved in except for taco shop after taco shop.  Now I love a good taco, but I don't want tacos every day.  A girl needs some variety in her food options!  I am happy this side of town is finally getting some new business love!

I actually noticed the sign for Cherry Berries as I was driving past to run some errands with my mom, who still lives over here.  I hadn't heard about it, but I am always on the look out for new places.  I stopped on my way back to pop inside and check it out.  We had eaten earlier, so we were more interested in desserts this time around.  I did check out the food menu while waiting for our order though, and a lot of things looked like they would be tasty for a lunch meal.

We both got smoothies this time.  My mom had the piña colada and I had the orange vanilla one.  The piña colada tasted like the ones you get in Mazatlan while you are sitting on the beach relaxing.  It was very refreshing and tropical.  The orange vanilla one tasted exactly like it's name.  I really liked the huge amount of oranges that went into the smoothie though.  My kid is not into eating but will never turn down a ice cream.  I ordered this one because I knew it would be close to ice cream and I could get her to drink some.  It definitely worked because she drank more than half before I got it back.  So yeah for sneaking some fruit into her diet!  Sneaky, but it works!

They also have a decent selection of Dryer's ice cream for sale for when you aren't trying to trick your kid into eating something healthy.  The servings are big and the prices are low.  Yummy and a good deal!

The staff was friendly too, which is always nice.  The service is slow though.  I only ordered 2 smoothies but it took 10 minutes to get them and I was the only one in there.  They tasted great and you could tell they were made after I ordered them, but keep it in mind if you are in a rush.  

I would definitely come back to try out their food for lunch, if I was in the area.  I know if  I lived closer to this place, I would be here pretty regularly.  Go check it out if you are near Sahara/Eastern.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,12,9,4,gNcuyvwOTL2UDuEUHNYhIw

4686831,2012-08-02,0,5TeA1dyLR7MIor-DfIrYog,"While Cherry Berries makes great desserts and smoothies, I'm on the lookout for new lunch options. Yesterday was a madhouse for me and I needed a quick lunch so I decided to give their Paninis a try. Parking in front was not even possible, the traffic to the 7-11 had cars 3 deep backed out onto Eastern trying to get in. I ended up parking around back, having to pass by the stinky trash cans and a homeless man to go in. 

I ended up ordering a Chicken Pesto panini: Chicken breast, muenster cheese, pesto sauce, mayo, tomato, balsamic onion, and lettuce. I also bought the meal deal with chips but upgraded to an ""All Berry"" smoothie for the drink, it came out to about $10. 

The smoothie came out first, but the panini seemed to take forever. I did have a hectic day yesterday so my sense of space and time may have been distorted but I started getting antsy that I was going to run out of time for lunch. When I got the panini it wasn't pretty like Panera Bread does theirs, but appearance is secondary, taste is everything. And the panini tasted... well it wasn't bad, but with pesto sauce and balsamic onions in it I just expected a little more zip, something to wake my mouth up a bit. This panini didn't have that. It was just good, but not great. 

So will I go back? For smoothies, absolutely. For paninis? I'll add it to my list as an option but my first impression was ho-hum. But they do have an extensive list of paninis and the staff always provides service with a smile so I'll give them another try.",HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,4,4,4,l318aWpMl6FnMiTaKW1vwg

Happen to see this place in a sketchy corner, but my boyfriend suggested we just go in and try it. It was very small inside, I believe there were 2-3 small tables with foldable chairs, and the menu was creative looking but ""different""...they had random food choices from greek salads, elote's, to being a juice bar...We just weren't too positive on how this place was creating all of this fresh food and drinks with one adult worker and 2 kids walking back and forth behind counter and partially helping the adult with the orders. The adult also spoke limited English, so we ended up just getting a banana split, handed it to us in a meal size styrofoam container, nothing like the picture we saw on their site, it was a good regular banana split, of course because its ice cream.. but definitely not worth $7...Sonic makes bigger and better for cheaper. The people before us ordered a drink that had scooped in fruit with juice, a salad, which looked like a flat, quick, put-together salad with pieces of chicken and some veggies... anyway, that was our experience, nothing worth us raving about to anyone and may not go back. Maybe there isn't too many places to choose from around that area. I gave it 2 stars because it states a ""meh. I've experienced better"".",-bTVl_9LUAOCTogy_CcaZQ,1,0,2,ma54hm3PmGui0RMg0qiDAQ

I say somewhat, because the smoothies tasted sugared up, and I prefer simple fruit in my smoothie, not a Slurpee. Also had a veggie panini and it was good. Another negative (besides the sugar in the smoothies) was that the chip options were totally 80's junk. No baked chips or healthy option or trendy brand, like ""Food Should Taste Good"", or even just Sun Chips. I passed on having any Lay's or Cheetos, even though they came with the meal. My mom really liked the panini, though. The juices were good, and didn't taste like anything was added. Loved the sweet gal at the counter; nice people.
