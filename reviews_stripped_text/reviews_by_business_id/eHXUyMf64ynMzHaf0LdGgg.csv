I ordered an egg salad on wheat which when upon returning to my office I found had been put on wheat toast and served with stale chips and missing the pickle that was supposed to come with it.  The sandwich was dry even though I'd ordered it with extra mayo.  Five people came in after me and there was only one employee working.

1169778,2016-11-23,0,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"If I can make a sandwich at home, then why should I get one out? Sandwiches like these are the answer. 

The service here is wonderful. Everyone is kind and more than willing to accommodate anything you need or want. They aren't the fastest, but if I was in a hurry, I would have called ahead to place an order. 

We tried three sandwiches - the mac and cheese panini, the spicy skylar, and the pesto chicken and bacon. 

The mac and cheese panini was my least favorite. It was a little bland. The mac and cheese needed more seasoning. 

The spicy skylar was really good. It had the right amount of kick and the perfect combination of meats and cheese. I wouldn't change anything about it.

I ordered the pesto chicken and bacon as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and I was so pleased with my choice. The sandwich was stuffed with chicken and cheese. The pesto wasn't overwhelming. It was subtle. The cheese and chicken were the stars. 

The sandwiches are about $10, but they are huge, so I don't mind paying that. 

Overall, this is a good place. I hope they can do well, but the shopping center location could be a challenge.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,0,0,5,v5L9eWRzQrOSCq-Eh8pTQA

1576985,2016-07-03,5,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"The GF and I were out and about in the kingdom of Hendo.  When there was a lull in the action and hunger needed to be destroyed, the infamous question...""Where do you want to eat?"" was thrown out into the universe.

So one begins to bracket......when it's all said and done.....the digital sorcerer pulls from the pocket.....the digital stone of knowledge that is yelp.

Tups presented it's self with numerous happy reviews and so this would be the order of the day.

We made our way down to this obscure shopping center on the southeast corner of Eastern & Windmill.  Obscure for some...but upon further self reflection...I have have been her numerous times.  I have sought everything from avocados, to cough syrup, to a spinal adjustment.  Familiar.....yes.

When we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, Tups was empty.  But quickly another couple would roll in behind us and so would a take-out order.  Tups is cozy.  I would imagine this place during a weekend day would fill up quickly.  Don't let this discourage...more on that later...

There is a simple but complex menu presentation.  This was explained by the nice lady behind the counter.  The said that she had tried to downsize the menu but when something is taken off....the butterfly effect happens and those seeking a particular Tups sandwich are automatically crying out.  Not a bad problem to have for a business owner, and so it remains on the menu.

I ordered up the ""The Spicy Skyler""-An Italian roll with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, capicola, ham, ghost pepper & provolone cheese, roasted peppers and hot giardiniera spread (http://www.whatsuptups.com/#!menu/soabe).  This a panini and it was delicious!  FRESH tasting & delicious!

My meal fell with the happy hour established by the establishment.  A major bonus is you get a fountain drink (I ordered a Pellegrino..does not count) and a bag of chips for FREE!  The mac salad was a cup of carb laden, sweet, starchy goodness!

I chatted up the nice lady (she is not Tups...Tups is gone) and found out she and her husband are the new owners for the past four months.  Clearly....a solid small business is continuing to continue on....even though it's changed hands.

Billed as a specialty sandwich shop, I think the Village Greek Salad ($11) is the best in town. It's huge and easily makes two meals for me, even without the side of pita bread. The feta vinagrette is amazing, and made in house.

They recommended the spicy panini to me, but I'm sensitive to spicy foods, so they were able to mix the cheeses to tone down the spicy.

I chatted with the new owners for quite a while and got to know them a bit. And to keep this update brief, I want to happily report that the quality is the same as Scott had it before he left. As always, my lunch was delicious and I'm always glad I came back.

I have ordered from this mom and pop deli several times as I live near by and have always had nothing but great service and delicious food.  I love supporting any local business. If I was writing this review any other time it would have been 5 stars, but had issues today. First off, the sandwiches always came with chips and either coleslaw or potato salad. I received neither. They said they changed their menu two months ago, but I had an order a month ago and still received it. If I was told no more chips, I would've gladly purchased them. They forgot to include my coleslaw or potato salad on my Jan chicken parm, although the sandwich was still amazing. My turkey avocado, I asked with no bacon, as I don't eat pork, well they included it so as much as I wanted to try it, I threw it out because of the bacon, and again missing the coleslaw or potato salad that comes with my meal.

2970776,2015-09-24,6,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"What does ""Tups"" mean? Is it a nickname, inside joke or the secret ingredient in their Giardiniera recipe? 

Tups is located in a funky shopping center, which by the way Google maps will point you in the wrong direction if you're heading east on Windmill, just a heads up. 

This small family owned deli only has only a few seats inside to sit and enjoy your lunch, so if you plan on dining-in watch out for those busy feasting hours. They offer the basic deli menu items; soups, salads, sandwiches, coffee and espresso. I ordered the half roast beef sandwich and The Greek Village salad. When I ordered my sandwich I was asked if I want everything on it, I said yes to this, just no onions and mayo. When posed with a question like that you assume your meal will be stacked with plenty of veggies, cheese and maybe an in-house tapenade, nope. I basically got two slices of roast beef, a tomato and some wilted lettuce, it' s like my 6-year-old niece made lunch for me. Believe it or not the Greek salad saved the day. 

The Greek Village salad was about $10, but this thing could easily feed a small  of Mediterranean food lovers. It comes filled to the brim with romaine, tomato, cucumber, red onion, green pepper, feta cheese & kalamata olives dressed with olive oil, oregano and parsley vinaigrette and served with three pieces of soft Pita bread. This alone was enough to feed me for lunch and as a side salad during dinner. Totally worth the price tag. 

The customer service here is well above most snacking spots from beginning to end, which is more than I can say for most of the 5 star dining spots in the Valley. I'm not fully sold on this place as a solid go-to sandwich location, but that could change with my next visit.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,18,12,4,qPGFlqb78DpJ0cX09fGPSA

Man this place has an incredible amount of options. I counted 8 Salads, 12 Sandwiches, and 11 Panini's! Everything is also priced around $5.99-$10.99 as well! Awesome! 

Mac & Cheese Panini $7.99- This is the one that grabbed my attention first so I went with this! Mac & Cheese with bacon, tomato, and provolone all warmed between two toasty pieces of bread! Soo gooey and tasty and was the perfect sandwich if you're craving comfort food. The portion was also really great sized so I took the other half home with me.

The Spicy Skyler $9.99- This is what my boyfriend ordered and comes with salami, pepperoni, mortadella, capicola, fire roasted ham, ghost pepper & provolone provolone cheese, roasted peppers and hot giardiniera spread. They told us they would put the giardiniera spread on the side since we've never tried it so we could adjust the heat on our own. This was also soo tasty! Like a Meatlover's Pizza!

All sandwiches also come with their homemade macaroni salad (super slaw) and normally I don't really care for potato salad or macaroni salad but theirs was soo good! It was somehow very fresh yet being rich without any kind of mayonnaise flavor, super good!

Turkey avocado sandwich for $10 had chinzy amount of turkey coldcut (not actual turkey, which I expected given how much people love this place), there was a little more turkey on one side but the other had only 1 thin slice of turkey that didn't even reach the side of the bread. Avocado? literally zero--as in zilch--avocado. And the man did not even tell me they were out. Disappointing. The sandwich was dry a bone--toasted bread was too big, and hardly any mayo, only a few pieces of cucumber, and a few crumbles of bacon. The chocolate chip cookie was tiny but very good/homemade.

Staff was very friendly, and I enjoyed their enthusiastic personality when I had questions regarding their menu.  They all were very excited and happy to explain the menu for you!

Mac N Cheese panini only took about 10 mins to make.  Includes bacon on the inside as well.  Very hot when it was served.  It was easy to eat, and the flavor tasted like homemade mac n cheese with some bacon to make it better.  Comes with coleslaw and pickle.

I settled on the roast beef panini and my mom had the Reuben.  It was all very good.  Sandwiches are served with chips and a pickle.  There is a selection of canned soda or Snapple for beverage choices.  

The only issue I had was with the restroom.  It had a terrible sewer smell and someone had clogged the toilet.  So, it wasn't greatly maintained.

Came here with a friend for lunch earlier and we were both very impressed! The menu held a great variety but wasn't overwhelming at all.

The sandwiches were filled with flavor and I couldn't think of a single ingredient that could make either of the two better. 

The restaurant itself is very small with about 5 two-top tables for dine in. There was one person working- taking orders and making the sandwiches; he was kind, worked quickly, and provided great suggestions.

They even named a veggie sandwich after me (I got to create it myself), apparently it's gotten very popular, just ask for the ""Tom"" (its not listed on the board yet). Just to warn you though, it isn't a huge place and there's only so many places to sit. So don't go right at lunchtime if you expect to find a place to sit.

4039938,2016-07-06,1,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"Tups is a local sandwich shop that got new owners around March of 2016. I stopped in to check them out after checking on Yelp and I was so pleasantly surprised.

Quick note! They have a happy hour from 3-5 pm everyday which includes free chips and a drink. Awesome deal! 

They have cold sandwiches, salads, and paninis. The sandwiches and salads can all be made into a wrap as well. Prices start around $9-$12 per item. 

Today I shared a Zack Attack (cold sandwich), the Mac and cheese grilled cheese panini, and a Greek salad. This came out to about $30 and some change. There was so much food that we took home half of everything. Their menu is huge and unique and I had a hard time choosing. They have over 20 sandwich choices.

The food was really good. It was fresh, flavorful, and unique. It's like a sandwich shop with their own unique twist on everything. I thought the price point was just a smidgen high, but after tasting the food, talking to the staff, and wanting to go back I thought it was great and well price pointed ESPECIALLY if you go during happy hour. You could get a drink, entree, and chips for about $10. I do recommend both of these sandwiches. The grilled Mac and cheese sandwich had bacon and tomato and was delicious.

I gave the place a solid 5 because of the interaction with the staff and the quality they are putting out. One of the employees heard the ice machine wasn't producing more ice so they offered to get me ice before I said anything. It's a family owned place without the hole in the wall feel even down to their take out boxes and I just dug it.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,9,3,5,mL-a5WGAflMl31nIK-FmQA

4219177,2016-05-21,0,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"Very East Coast-style sandwich shop. Not much seating but quick service for a busy Saturday afternoon. 

The quality of sandwich ingredients were a bit of a letdown for the reputation of this place and the amount of meat for $10-11 average price was poorly adequate. A sample of the three-mustard egg salad was worth it because it was not good. A little similar to egg salad on a poor buffet with no hint of mustard, nevermind 3 mustard at all. Very dry in texture, if that makes sense. 

Classic roast beef definitely used old/poor roast beef that was not rare and sported that iridescent sheen/fish scale-looking film. Maybe that's why there was a special offering a free iced latte with the classic roast beef? For a sandwich shop, this is kind of unacceptable to have crappy roast beef. Hot pastrami sandwich was good albeit a little fatty in quality. The breads they use are fresh and tasty but when a sandwich uses thick-sliced bread and only has a 1/2"" layer of meat in between, you are eating mostly bread. The veggies on the sandwiches are fresh and good; tomatoes a bit cheap in quality. Another letdown when you have a few vegetarian sandwiches on your menu. Pickle spears are excellent! The best part of the lunch was the triple chocolate cookie.

I can't wait to go back with Josie and have her try a few things. This to me is a dine in just because of the hot sandwiches you would want to eat them hot off the grill.

5325123,2017-08-26,0,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"Tups is located in the Smith's shopping center on Windmill and Eastern.   

Under new owners, the menu is still pretty similar.  We ordered 2 hot sandwiches.  The spicy skylar and the little ruby.   Both sandwiches were served with chips and a pickle.  

4 stars for freshness.  The sandwich did take a bit of time to make, so call ahead if your not into waiting.  

3 stars for taste.  Both sandwiches were ok.  Nothing blew my socks off, but it wasn't terrible either.   

I felt they were both a bit heavy.   Just my personal opinion.   I definitely see why ppl love the sandwiches here, just not my style.",zsJLk34mTDMyuVS_EaBLxw,0,0,4,AMjuP7qX61jfQezQmvygMw

Their coleslaw is probably the most unique and flavorful coleslaw one could get around town. My personal favorite is their hot pastrami on rye and their tuna sandwich. And to top it off, they have a refreshing yoghurt parfait. Definitely recommend it for lunch!",XfTJvTjYK6yb2iqq2n0Lmg,0,0,5,KtPSfL8pAL6btAm6BNg6EA
5375494,2016-06-06,0,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,Ok.  My wife and I use Yelp all the time but we've never written one before but I had to this time.  My wife and kids and I were visiting our family in Vegas and we wanted something not too expensive but not fast food and processed.  Looked at the reviews and gave it a shot.  It was amazing!  It was the best panini I ever had and the Greek salad was fresh and HUGE.  The two ladies there (I think it was a mother daughter team) were so welcoming and friendly.  We are texting our family to try it.  If you go there you will NOT be disappointed!,tg22UTjW0bwoJc0B0A3D8w,1,0,5,GPh9L_w5NCGa1Wxt8fQu8w
5390342,2016-04-20,0,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"I love this place! First, every person who works there is so kind and so helpful (shout-out to Nikki and Mary!). Second (which should also be first), it is so delicious. A co-worker and I had lunch from there first. I had the Zack Attack - AMAZING. She had a salad that was so big she was able to save the rest for another whole meal. 

Then I tried their catering and delivery service for a small meeting I was hosting for 10 people. They were so accommodating. All I had to say was my budget, the number of people, and the salads/sandwiches I was interested in getting, and they made it happen like magic. They included plenty of side items too (macaroni salad, cole slaw, and pickles). We had the classic beef, turkey avocado (no bacon), the vegetarian sandwich, and the greek salad. It was PLENTY of food, we had left overs for the office to have for lunch the next day. Mary called me with plenty of time before the delivery was scheduled for to let me know she had all the utensils and napkins, but no plates. She said if I needed them, she would pick some up before the delivery. I didn't need her too, but thought this was so nice of her to offer and to really think of everything. 

I am so curious as to know where they get their bread from, it is so good. I will 100% be eating there/ordering there again. They are a great, family-owned and operated place that we need so desperately in this area.",rufNGqIVND_a-BkF8J0-vw,1,1,5,YH-7xYhesr1_REcCQx2x7Q

If you like simple made sandwiches and paninis then this place got you covered..

i had the chicken Parmesan panini.. and like i said.. very simple.. it came with some chips and a piece of sliced pickle.. 

a little over-priced for a simple sandwich / panini / salad.. 

the guy working there didn't seem like he wanted to be there.. (maybe having a bad day).. but did check on us to see how the sandwich was.. 

overall.. not bad.. bread was a little hard and chewy.. chicken was good.. 

probably come back and try something else",A0Sy2srGc-AhXEuFoErDkw,0,0,3,l_YTGipv2IjSdiI6_PTtYw

5660046,2016-08-14,2,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"The mac & cheese panini from here showed up as a featured item on Yelp. Little did I know, this place is literally within walking distance of my house! I decided to give it a try and stopped by to grab that delicious looking mac & cheese panini. 
The place is very small and has about 2 or 3 tables if you want to eat there. It's your standard small sandwich shop, very similar to what you can find in New York. 
The panini was so good! The mac & cheese alone was amazing so when you mix that with fresh tomato and crispy bacon it is absolute perfection. You can choose a side of macaroni salad or cole slaw. I chose macaroni salad and wasn't very impressed with it. I think they add cinnamon to it which made it taste really weird.  It also came with a pickle that tasted like it wasn't pickled long enough. I've never had a pickle that tasted half like a pickle and half like a cucumber. This is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5. I will definitely be back to try more!",lHFkt91UFwQUywggO8yDHA,2,1,4,skVOHaFvJb6HPivclJMNGw

5821403,2016-10-26,3,eHXUyMf64ynMzHaf0LdGgg,"Panini can go one way or the other. AMAZING or just WHATEVER. There's a lot of mediocre paninis out there, and a part of me may have given up a bit. Gotta try the TUPS when I'm in the area, right?

The SPICY SKYLAR is THE ULTIMATE for those who love a kick and spicy foods. It was so amazingly delicious, I quickly regretted swapping my half with her grilled cheese panini with bell peppers. It was NOT even a comparison to have a sandwich full of flavor from the meats, to the mayo and butter on the bread, and the extra kick, followed by this super SIMPLE (kinda bland after eating something so flavorful) grilled cheese sandwich. Now, I'm not knocking it out. If I've never had a car, I'd be content with a civic. But if I've test driven a BMW, the Civic is gonna be plain. 

This sandwich was in fact so good that I wanted to come back the next day to eat it one more time. It is VERY filling, and half is enough. 

MY AWARD TO BEST PANINI OF MY LIFE goes to TUPS. I would love to come back and try their tuna sandwich and the melts. MMM MM GOOOOOOOD.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,9,5,5,B-6HqX5sQtAkFASU1SIJ_g
