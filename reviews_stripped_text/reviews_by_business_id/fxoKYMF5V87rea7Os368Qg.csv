$8.99 for a burger and fries (+$1 ea for bacon, cheese, mushroom, etc)
$8.99 for steak and egg with hash browns and toast

It used to be $3.99 for the burger, but then they raised it to $5.99... NOW, it's $8.99... BUT STILL WORTH IT!

I had their burger and I added the bacon, cheese, and mushroom because that's what I like! LOL! The burger was HUGE! It was definitely filling! The fries were amazing! Totally caught me off guard. They were perfectly crispy and seasoned really well. My burger was delish! My boyfriend had the steak and egg. It was pretty good, too. Granted, the steak was a bit bland, but it was perfectly cooked. The hash browns were a bit different than what I'm used to. They were CHEWY! I couldn't figure out how or why, but it was interesting. I'm always FOR trying new things! 

This place is located in the Flamingo. You have to walk through the casino to get to it, but it's worth it. This was my first time here, at the Burger Joint, and I was a bit surprised that it was THAT GOOD! The staff were so warm and inviting. Overall, this place is a good place to go for a late night snack on the strip...even on a weeknight!",gNRLQhdAci5PEs8orOaGrA,0,0,4,K2HMM9hQsQbZ_iQZcxvHpg

No fancy folie gras or truffles here, but the mix and match concept is the same.You pick your bun, your burger, your cheese and your toppings, mix and match. I had a regular burger, with mushrooms, cheddar and crispy onion strings. The burger was nice and juicy (which isn't always the case when you ask for it well done like I did). Fries were good too. The place is cute, with a black, white and hot pink decor. The service was very attentive. I didn't have a shake, but boy, did they look good!

A few buddies and I went here for a bite before we hit the strip. The restaurant was about half full and there was no reason I could see for the sloooooow service we received. What should have been at most a 45-minute experience turned into a 2 hour experience, in which most of that time was spent waiting to order, waiting for the server to take four other orders before even putting ours into the POS system, waiting for the water she never brought after the food arrived, and waiting to get my correct change for the privilege of eating here.

And here's the icing on the cake: after the already poor experience, the waitress helped herself to a over a $10 tip! We had told her to split our tab into three and to charge two of the credit cards with $15 and take the rest out of the $40 cash I provided. Instead, she had told the cashier to put all the cash towards the meal, plus $15 on each credit card! Absolutely unacceptable. The reaction of the management lady did not alleviate the situation either, as she made us wait until 5 other people in line had finished paying before correcting our situation. 

Absolutely horrible experience. That's not how a restaurant should be run.",ebB33c5RuFdr-6vXzw3utQ,1,0,1,-Ik5JG0LuKRdJV4j0xpu5Q

We ended up eating at The Burger Joint every night that we were there and it wasn't because we loved it.  The reason we ate there every night is because almost every restaurant closed around 11:00 p.m. to midnight!  We would trek around town looking for somewhere to eat, and with no luck, we would return to The Burger Joint.

Each time we went, there was no wait so that was fantastic.  The first night, I tried their breakfast, which was great!  For the money, you got a lot of food.  The waitress was alright.  Nothing fantastic.

The second night, we had no wait again and had a party of seven.  I tried the chicken tenders, which were alright.  I've had better at Burger King.  The waitress that night was great!

As for the third night, we decided to order a pizza (which isn't on the menu and comes from the pizza restaurant next door that closes at 11 p.m., but they still serve pizza?  Confusing.)  Anyway, we decided to carry it out, but they still made us sit at a table instead of letting us order room service.  So, they wasted a table of seven just so we could sit and wait for our pizza.  It didn't make sense.  Then the waiter had big attitude for no reason and yelled at my dad who was just watching the TVs around the restaurant.  As for the pizza, it was good.  Extremely cheesy and good.

As first timers to Vegas, we thought every thing stayed open late, so needless to say we were surprised!

So I can clearly recall my experience. It was 3am, we waited in a 10 minute line filled with groups who had probably just finished clubbing, then were greeted by a seemingly disgruntled waiter who may have been fighting depression. We quickly ordered the steak deal and were surprised that the waiter did not ask how we wanted the steak cooked. Possibly because he was depressed; possibly because the steak is poor-quality. Probably both.

Turns out the steak only comes 1 way: sawed in half (horizontally), and well-done. That's right, sawed in half. They should call this the ""Half steak, well done, and eggs"" deal. Though half a steak at this ungodly hour is probably a better idea since you're likely to hit the sack right after this meal. But still, call it what it is.

The waitress couldn't even remember our simple drink order - she came back about two seconds later to ask again. When the food came out, the orders were completely messed up. They got the bread and toppings wrong on our burgers. However, to avoid waiting any longer, we just ate what we had. The kaiser roll's on the burgers were completely stale and hard as rocks. With that said, the burger (I got the turkey burger) itself was pretty decent tasting. I also didn't like that the burgers didn't come with any side - no fries, chips, nothing. Considering the burger prices ranged between $10-$15, I definitely think they should have come with some kind of side dish.

The brains behind Flamingo took the hip Voga restaurant, kept the decor intact, hung some Miller Lite flags on the railing, hung some plasma TV's on the wall with sports, took the good booze out of the bar, added a couple of diner tables along a wall, and gave us Burger Joint.

I had the Kobe beef on one visit and it was no more special than what you get at Jack In The Box.

The fact that we were staying at the Flamingo definitely made this place better as it was way more convenient.

The first time we were able to really sit down, enjoy and got a good recommendation from our server.  They have a lot of different ""Signature Creations"" that made it difficult to choose so our server suggested we split the 6-pack of sliders and try 3.  What a great idea!  It was like having a little tasting party of our own.  We order a pair of each: Italian Stallion (Oregano Crusted Beef Patty, Pepperoni, Marinara, Homemade Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, served on House Made Tomato Herb Bu), The Cure (BJ House Blended Fresh Beef Patty, Grilled Ham, American Cheese, Applewood Bacon, Fried Egg, Sriracha Aïol), and Bugsy's Side Kicks (House Blend Slider Patties topped with American Cheese, served on Fresh Baked Slider Buns--this one was a safety one just in case the other ones were too fancy for me).

All ended up being amazing and the next night, even though we were running SUPER late due to being uncontrollably drunk during the day and needing SOMETHING in our stomach before we drank somewhere at Marquee, we felt the need to order from here and take it to-go.  They don't actually do it to-go so we still had to get seated but when we told the server we were in a rush and if he could just box it up for us, that's exactly what he did!  Maybe it would've been faster to eat somewhere else but these burgers were too damn good!  And quite frankly, more worth it than Marquee itself.  We ate all our sliders in the cab ride to Aria.

First time was for a late night bite after the clubs and second time was for a bite to eat in the evening. It's nice to know that this place is opened late aside from Denny's or steak and eggs. Never a wait, but there is a decent amount of people every time, no matter what time of day. 

They have a lot of different types of burgers and options for buns/extras. I chose a veggie burger on wheat. Too much guac, but other than that it was alright. My burger came with fries and they were pretty good, but that could have been because I was really hungry. Lettuce wraps are Americanized (what do you expect at a burger joint? But I was craving it!). P.F. Changs can make better lettuce wraps, trust me. The lettuce cups were quite small too. Sweet potato fries were delicious, thin, and crispy. Calamari was pretty good as well. 

They do have a lot of TVs around the restaurant, so you won't have to worry about missing your baseball, football, or some other type of sports game.

Out came two baskets of fries, each weighing enough to do a bench press with. They should have warned us how large an order of fries is so we could share one order between ourselves and a few strangers.

Our sandwiches were also comically large. His burger must have been a full half pound and my pulled pork was the size of a hub cap. Unfortunately, the pork itself was mostly just fatty bits with insanely sweet BBQ sauce all over it with no hint of any spice of any kind. And medium rare beef at The Burger Joint means extra-well-done, apparently.

We left full after finishing a third of our meals, but unsatisfied. If you want a real burger, I recommend trying I Heart Burgers up the strip at the Palazzo. But that's just me.",3KYpsCjlw9Nnxnn2lSbQHg,0,0,1,xJ0P4X4Au-x7qi5M2SUHng

I was hungry and after looking over the menu decided to stop for a quick snack.  I got the 2 slider appetizer and we ended up having to wait like 15-20 min for my order (my boyfriend didn't order anything) to arrive.  There was a waiter that refilled our glasses every few min or so and we never had to worry about refills (it was great!).  Although it seemed like a while for just two little sliders I don't think it was a huge deal.  We had waiters walking by every so often.  The waiter told us about their special glass promotion (we could purchase the glasses like the one we were drinking from for only $2! that was like woohoo for me! so I purchased one to take home...they are the coolest!).  The time we ate here was between 12 and 1pm.  I think the appetizer may have been slightly overpriced $7 (or if your a rewards member only $6) but what food isn't in Vegas?

You gotta give the guy credit for being honest. The burger wasn't bad either. It was a tad bit dry, and served one way. You got it...well done!!! It was served with thick cut fries that were OK too.

Service was pretty slow at 10 at night, but my expectations weren't too high.  I was tired, and after a long night of wandering the casinos, a greasy burger was called for.   An Atomic Burger set me back $12 and a side of fries $4.  I'd asked for it medium rare, and it arrived medium --  hardly a sin, but we weren't off to a great start.  

The burger was quite enormous, and, the bread, as promised, seemed freshly baked and was a perfect foil for the array of condiments.  I'd consider the burger on a par with what I've received at Fuddrucker's - juicy, fresh, served piping hot.  I'm at a quandary about whether or not it's worth the $12 charged.  In a town like Vegas, there are probably similarly good places with burgers just as tasty that will leave you with a little more green in your pocket to waste in the casino.

The sides are enormous -- too much in fact.  It bothers me a little that during their non-special hours that you have to purchase the sides separately in a mammoth portion.  Pricing issues aside, however, they, too, were freshly made.  A crisp exterior gave way to a creamy interior, just the way a good french fry ought to be.  Split a side with a friend, you'll be glad you did.  

The server never arrived with my requested drink refill, which didn't surprise me too much after how long it took to receive my order in the first place.  

My recommendation?  If you're here, and it's past 11, drop by for a burger special.  For $8.99 with fries included, it seems like a great deal, even with slow service.

I wasnt even going to review this place, I just looked this place up now just to see what others had to say and after reading them I figured I'd throw my two sense in.  From the previous reviews it seems Turkey Burgers good, Kobe burgers bad.....well I had the Turkey Burger and a Caesar's Salad. 

The first time I went here was on saturday evening about 6:30pm.  I really didnt want anything heavy so I ordered the Casears salad with chicken. ok a few things, 1) The salad came in a bowl that was tilted, this was for aesthetic value i presume but here is the problem 2) they dont chop the lettuce very well, there were huge chunks of lettuce that had to be cut to fit in my mouth, i dont know whose mouth hunks like that would fit in besides a seasoned porn star i suppose...but i digress.  So trying to cut up lettuce in a tilted bowl was all bad. I wasted some of the salad on the table when it flew out the bowl while trying to cut.  3) It took them a while just for a salad.  Now i realize this is a burger place now a salad place, but a gentleman walked in after me, ordered after me and received his burger before me.  That kind of pissed me off because i was thinking you got this ordered after you got my order but you were able to whip up a burger faster than you did throwing together some not even cut lettuce in a bowl and mixing it with dressing...i didnt understand that.

The second time I went here was the same night/morning because at that point it was 1:30am on Sunday morning.  I just wanted to go back to my room, which i did after the Burger Joint told me i couldnt get anything to go and i went up to my room to find that room service said it would be a 1:30 wait cuz they were really busy so i just came back down.  This time I had the turkey burger and it was very good. It was moist and tasted just fine for a turkey burger. the bun was a little greasy but hey. I dont like whatever little grassy things they put in the burger. I dont know what they are, but it literally looked and tasted like grass to me so I pulled those all off.  And service was fast this time.

Steak and eggs: Steak was too fatty on the side, yet kinda dry on the inside. How that works, I'm not sure. I wasn't too fond of it. It's a good deal though for midnight steak and eggs (around $10). You also get toast and eggs and potatoes. 

Fruit bowl: Fruit with a banana nut muffin and yogurt. Yogurt tasted like Dannon's strawberry yogurt. Muffin was a bit tough, but flavor wasn't too bad. Fruit was plentiful and good. 

Service was very slow, considering there were only about 4 tables in the entire restaurant. We really had to wave down the waitresses, who would be clumped together at the front every 5 minutes. 

I personally wouldn't like to come here again, but if I wanted steak and eggs at midnight for a cheap price and I was too drunk to mind how it tasted, mmm maybe.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,1,0,2,bB4PhEoEMqPFw4FtSsNvVQ
