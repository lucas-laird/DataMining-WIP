I always get the chunky monkey protein smoothy. It's quick and it's 24hrs. I wish there were more of these is the city.,kp4ES15mhsPHR1uIx2AYHA,0,0,5,uNBHUbeg8jYlkuuvpzWhdQ

I had the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was delicious and a generous portion! It didn't have BBQ or isn't your typical BBQ but the flavors all matched and the toppings gave it variety and texture.

The food is delicious and most of the staff pleasant but I have to agree with another reviewer that the bartender was unpleasant, if the same one? I think she had a nose ring or some other facial piercing. Asked for a Diet Coke and she asked if Pepsi was ok and I said no thank you and she gave me a sour look. I don't like Pepsi, ok!? At any rate, the food is delicious, juices are also great (9 bucks a pop though, no surprise there for LV).",s3ZOgV3fFSGtQALC7AurGg,0,0,4,AC5_cWn0NTIT3zjxOKzZZg

So I just came here with a friend just to watch a show and we had plenty of time to kill. The bottomless mimosas were absolutely amazing. The bartender Lizzy was so nice and genuine and had the most funniest conversations with us ever. Also Glen who is a waiter there is great as well. These people have amazing customer service and made me and my friend have nothing but an amazing experience full of laughter and fun with these people. They are so wonderful at customer interaction and multitasking. If you are going to go to the bar, I would put in a request for Lizzy. If you are looking for a sit down, Glen is great too. In my personal opinion, this place is the best for a breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I would definitely come back here again. Atmospheres great and so are the employees.

Surprisingly bad. Took forever to get drinks, took forever to get food. Server was apologetic and nice and friendly, but that only goes so far.

My friend got a burger. Asked for jalapeños on the side. Told it would be extra, no problem. Jalapeños never showed up, we complained. By the time the server returned my friend had already finished his burger. Server came to explain they ran out of jalapeños. Burger itself was a bad, obviously frozen patty. Oh, and they forgot the fries as well, which were uninspiring.

My salad was fine, a C+/B- level type meal.

I'd be shocked if that initial 5-star review was not a shill post. This place was baaaaaaad.",I_HmKYwFFK_0LXM5Upnf7A,4,1,1,-47KCsOUfxmDd6hPEb-x8A
124297,2013-07-19,0,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"Taking over the giant old space that was once Red, White and Blue, Citizens was designed by a 'famous' design firm for the Light group. The space is huge, and comprised of all hard surfaces; hard floors, hard ceilings, and hard walls. What this equates to is an extremely loud dining experience, even if it's not that full. The vaulted ceilings, light fixtures and finishes are all cool, but this place is just huge. I would also point out that if you want comfort, do not sit on the incorrectly proportioned backless bar chairs at the bar, and instead get yourself a table.  More importantly this place is overpriced; you'll notice that just about everything on the menu is about $2-3 more than you'd be willing to spend. I had this gripe when I ate at Mandalay's noodle shop a few weeks ago when my lunch special was an astonishing $18 for a soup and lunch-portioned dish. Apparently the property really likes to take advantage of their massive convention crowds. With everything from breakfasts, salads, burgers, entrees and desserts you can certainly find something you'd like, just expect to pay handsomely for it. Also, they use the words 'specialty' and 'signature' quite a bit on their menu, but looking around at other people's dishes and based on my meal this definition seems to be based around providing mediocre, high priced sandwiches.

My classic hamburger was placed in front of me and looked as mediocre as it tasted. The bun was dry and a bit too big, but well-proportioned to the patty. Not sure if you have a choice of cheeses, but when I asked for a cheeseburger I wasn't offered any options and was given American cheese. The presumably frozen patty had ok char flavor, but was of your extremely generic back yard BBQ variety, and very overcooked at that. But I guess one of this quality shouldn't be ordered any other way. One small slice of not too fresh tomato didn't provide much coverage, but I had plenty of pickles, lettuce and red onion at my disposal. Overall this had nothing great going on. 

My waffle fries sucked as they always do, and considering the menu gives you the option of skinny fries, potato salad or coleslaw I'm not quite sure why I got these stupid fries. They're clearly never fresh due to how they're made, so why bother? Plus, $21 for a burger and iced tea is about $9 more than you should pay for this, even in a casino setting capitalizing on desperate conventioneers. After this awful experience, combined with Burger Bar's drop off, I can probably now claim that there are no decent burger options south of Tropicana along the Strip until you get much more south away from the casinos. If you're at Mandalay I would still recommend Burger Bar over this as you get far better quality for the money, but I can't promise anything there anymore.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,6,1,1,1Ypql0qdSQhVtv3PTZOCTw

163110,2014-02-22,1,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"Truly a 3-star restaurant. Citizens has a down to earth vibe that reminds you of a Classic American diner...until you see the $4 price for a cup of coffee. But then again, you're not really in America, you're in Vegas. 

Unlike other Mandalay spots, this is a good spot if you know how to order. The $8 side of eggs during brunch is RIDICULOUS. Don't do it. Interestingly, the $2 side of toast is worth it: two slices so large they are a breakfast in themselves. My regular way to start the day at a Vegas trade show at Mandalay is with the chocolate peanut butter smoothie ($9) and that side of toast ($2). For $11, it's a great starter to an intense day on your feet. 

And speaking of being on your feet, the floors in Mandalay leading into Citizens are crazy slippery. I'm shocked people aren't breaking their hips on a regular basis. I ate at Citizens twice this week while in town for the Project trade show and nearly fell over another guest waiting in line for a table. 

The service at Citizens definitely makes up for the overpriced menu. Servers are cheery but not cheesy and just conversational enough. Not bad, but really overpriced (isn't everything in Vegas), so definitely NOT great.",t95f8GfhdYT0RKoiRWXaeg,1,1,3,X69yhlxAzfBLBN77645YMw

The next morning I went there for coffee and here is where the problem arose. I eat oatmeal as I have a special diet for breakfast. 
I asked for hot water with my coffee and after a discussion with I guess her manager, the waitress came back and said I could have the coffee but would have to eat the oatmeal elsewhere. I mean they are not crowded, I'm at the Bar so I don't take up a precious table. Won't be eating there again this trip just to reward their service.

But 10am hungers could be just for breakfast foods now. Vegas is known for its edgy entertainment, gaudy bling, and top notch reviewed eaterys. Despite that flashy sign, this one is average, and I will only wonder what that Burger at 10am would have tasted like.

Lox and cream cheese, side of hashbrowns: Nice platter, medium smoked salmon, nice smooth shreddable texture, just enough to cover that not so thick plain bagel. Need more cream cheese - the design squares are nice, but not functional. Easy on the red onions was good, and a nice pile of capers is always good too. Maybe it was the not typical squirt of lemon from me, but the usual salty flavors weren't there in harmony as usual.

SIde of hashbrowns was nice. Perfect portion sized tater tot crumbled hash nicely mixed with peppers.

It arrived quickly and piping hot.  There were multiple different cheeses, an abundance of fresh tasting spinach and they had enough chips where we didn't have to worry about running out of chips with a lot of dip left (a huge pet peeve of ours). We would go out of our way to order this again.

Our dinner entrees were delicious and promptly served after our appetizer was completed. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. The manager, Andrea, even stopped by and not only asked about how our meal was, but asked us about how we were enjoying our time in Vegas and gave us a couple additional ideas of things to do.

She asked why we didn't enjoy our food and asked if we would like another dish but had an unfriendly demeanor. We felt really awkward and just wanted to leave.

BUT I CAN REMEMBER HOW SHITTY BOTH MY VISITS HERE WERE!
The first time, I ordered a pretty basic burger that ended up coming to the table late and undercooked.  While I would typically eat it if it was anything else (my standards of food are pretty low), I would probably have yakked it out if I decided to eat it.  I asked for it to be recooked, but the waiter was pretty unresponsive about me getting a new one, so I didn't even end up eating it as my group was in a rush.  I gave up and decided to never come back again....

But I did, several months later.  This time, our group was much bigger (about 10) so understandably, it would take a while to get our food.  However, we were there for maybe a half hour-45 AFTER ordering and our waitress passed by our table once, only after we all spent time staring at her from across the room.  Finally got the food and it was cold as Antarctica.  Wow! It's like they cooked it on time but left it on the counter to hang out or something.  Some people at my table refused to eat most of their food so I asked (shamelessly) if they ""were gonna eat that"" so I could doggy bag it.  Even the boxes took some effort to acquire.  I was determined to salvage as much as I could from this experience and never return again!

I called them at 5 AM asking about the menu options at that hour and they said that the to go part was open and what I wanted to order was available when I told her. Once I got there and made my order(Turkey avocado sandwich), they said they were out of the cranberry walnut bread it's normally served on, which is part of why I wanted to go there to try it and they should've told me that on the phone. Whatever, I got it on sourdough instead. Then I ordered a chicken Caesar salad, the chicken soup and the green mean juice shake. They said that they wouldn't serve me the soup because it had been sitting there all day..... Ok then why have it on a late night menu if you're not going to serve it? 

Once I got home I realize there was no avocado in my turkey avocado sandwich...again annoying...to pay for something I didn't get and not wanting to drive all the way back for it. Anyways, the food still tasted good and I could tell was fresh. 

My bill was $35 for a salad, sandwich and drink.....pretty pricy but I don't mind paying to bad because the quality was good. I will definitely come back here to try it again.

All of this for $49 per person!  We saw this as quite a bargain, especially considering that the glass of wine costs about $10 by itself. 

The hostess told us at the door that the prime rib would be 8 ounces, but it turned out to be a whopping 14!  Our waiter laughed with us as our jaws dropped when the entrees arrived. (He was friendly and provided great service throughout our meal.)

Wow, I've never eaten so much beef in one sitting. It was cooked to a perfect medium as requested, but could have used a bit more seasoning and the quality of the meat wasn't that great. It had a somewhat grainy texture. Considering the price of the dinner deal though, we couldn't expect the best cut of beef. For something more top notch, StripSteak is down the hall, but at much steeper prices of course. You get what you pay for! As for the side items, our portions of Caesar salad were generous, crisp and fresh. The baked potato was huge, topped with cheese, sour cream and some chives, but was still unfortunately dry and starchy inside as opposed to being fluffy.

Citizens is open 24 hours and serves typical American fare day and night. Peering around at neighboring tables, their burgers and fries looked delicious so I'd recommend just based on appearance!

I ordered the French Dip with french fries and a side of macaroni and cheese, and it was extremely delicious!  However, there really isn't much else I would have ordered from this restaurant.  Our server was friendly, but nothing too spectacular.

THE FRENCH DIP WAS THE BEST FRENCH DIP I HAVE EVER HAD!  The meat was of high quality, the au jus was tasty, and the bread was delicious as well.  It all went together so perfectly, although a tad bit salty (which was to be expected).  The french fries were sliced thinly and crispy, with some kind of seasoning that was perfect!  The macaroni and cheese was extremely tasty with peas and ham inside.  The cheese was so creamy and flavorful and the breadcrumbs that topped the dish was perfectly sprinkled with herbs.  

Citizens is a very casual barstaurant with an interesting atmosphere.  My meal was served on a silver tray that was reminiscent of a elementary school cafeteria tray.  My friend's sandwich was served on a cutting board.  The ""kitchen"" theme here is very prevalent and unique in Las Vegas.

I would definitely go back to Citizens again.  I went for lunch, so I would be interesting in checking out their drinks one night as well.  Or perhaps to try their 24 sliders in 24 minutes challenge!",VjmDfDsK9iogVNuaGIBMvw,0,0,4,wsyvJZjrnlAKxjl2hgLGBw

I ordered the Corn-beef Rueben, it was good  and goes perfectly well with the coleslaw I got. The price was decent comparing to other options in the hotel. 

The Corn-beef Rueben was delicious, slightly on the heavy taste, but the flavor wise was good. I personally think it would have goes well with some mustard on the side just get a little kick to it. We also ordered chicken-noodle soup which is perfect for a hangover remedy. Last but not least, the nacho with chicken that comes in double size is not bad but it would have been better to have little bit more cheese and pico de gallo.

For lunch I had the turkey burger which was about $20. It was nothing special but not terrible either. The cocktails we had at lunch were pretty decent. 

Breakfast we had waffles and eggs... its hard to screw those up. 

At 4am I don't recall exactly what we were eating.. I think it was probably waffles and french fries. The point is, they were open at 4 am and serving the entire menu! We couldn't get room service at the Delano at that time so Citizens saved us.

1590073,2013-02-08,0,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"Yes, we went on their opening day but still, 2 hours for a lunch that consisted of a couple of sandwiches and a salad is completely unacceptable.  Since this place was Red, White and Blue like 5 minutes ago, I'm 99% sure they just re-branded the place and didn't replace their entire staff.  Of course, I could be completely wrong about that.  Even so, for a restaurant that was less than half full, they should have it together enough to throw some sandwiches on a plate.

On the bright side, our server was nice and always had our drinks refilled.  The food, once we got it, was decent.  My Greek salad was huge, although, I'm not sure it was Greek so much as an Italian chopped salad like the kind you'd get at your favorite pizza joint.  The salmon that I ordered with it was, despite being heavily over seasoned, cooked very well and pretty good.  The portions are huge but for the $32 I spent on a salad and an iced tea, I still think it's pretty steep, although probably on par with the rest of the hotel outlets.

It does look like they've put some thought and effort into their beverage program, which I appreciate.  I've been dying to try the new Bombay Sapphire East, which they have here and nowhere else that I've seen in the hotel.  They've also come up with a cocktail menu that looks like they've tried to put twists on some of what seem to be Vegas' most popular drinks.  If I hadn't been working, I would have given them a go.

Honestly, I probably won't ever come back for lunch because I will most likely be fired for being gone so long again.  Since I basically live at the Mandalay Bay for work, I'm sure I'll be back at some point.  Hopefully with a lot of time on my hands.",j_xdpXxPdSVhlwTJ7roKag,4,0,3,cNR_A_6vdIyAW9WXkDeHDA

1628264,2015-05-18,0,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"First time here. As a Vegas local, I usually try to avoid the Strip places, as from what I've seen they're usually overpriced tourist traps. I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised by Citizens. I had been considering Citizens as an after-concert choice (Neil Diamond!), since it's open 24 hours. We arrived at Mandalay Bay early and had an hour and a half to kill, so we decided to eat before the show instead.

After checking out the menu board outside and getting on the list, we waited about 3 minutes and we were seated in the outer ""patio"" area. Our server, Nick, greeted us very shortly thereafter and brought us our drinks, offering to answer any questions we had about the menu sections. I decided against spending $40 on a 14 oz NY sirloin steak and went with the bacon burger (medium done, add cheese, hold the onions) & fries. My wife chose the NY-style pastrami sandwich. Being that it was 5:45 pm, I expected to wait a bit for my order to come out. After 15 minutes or so Nick came back to the table and apologized for the wait, explaining that they were very busy and that he would see to our orders ASAP. I thought that was really cool of him, because I cannot tell how many times I have been sitting in a restaurant, getting aggravated looking at my watch over and over, while the wait staff hangs around chatting or walks by us over and over like we haven't been sitting there sipping our drinks for over a half hour. The food arrived a few minutes later and it was time to dig in.

My burger platter, served on what looked like a cookie sheet, was the perfect size for the $20 price tag: a good-size, nicely stacked burger with tomato and shredded lettuce, cooked and prepared exactly as I had requested and skewered through the top bun with a large pepperoncini that would make Papa John cry, a decently-sized ""bucket"" of shoestring fries and a half pickle slice. My wife's equally-priced sandwich was huge (the half she couldn't finish wound up in the car in a to-go box before we went to the show), stuffed with perfectly lean pastrami, along with a side bowl of potato salad (or fries or cole slaw) and also sporting that pepperoncini and pickle slice. Both orders were delicious and appropriately priced for the portions we received. When it came time to settle the bill, I jokingly asked if they do employee discounts for fellow MGM employees, to which Nick said he would go check. He returned a couple of minutes later with, to my surprise, a new bill reflecting a 20% discount (which I kicked back to Nick on top of the original tip for his great service) - a definite high-five to Citizens for that!

All in all, I still generally think Strip dining establishments are tourist traps, but I also think they have not yet seen the last of me at Citizens - it seemed to be, at least to me, one of the few exceptions to the rule.",w5p02wAC5NXh0iwV2zHvSQ,0,0,4,yASIMLdriuChncisVbndug

Review from Feb 2, 2013.

The scene:

Citizens Kitchen & Bar
Hotel: Mandalay Bay
Date: Saturday, February 2, 2013
Time: 12:00 pm
There was a UFC fight the same day. Picture lots of men on steroids with tons of testosterone, pent up rage and Affliction t-shirts.  HA
Food: 1 Turkey Sandwich, 2 Iced Teas and Chicken Soup= $66.00

I was craving some comfort food to help revitalize my energy levels. I had a giant sandwich on my mind, so I walked through the Casino in hopes of eating at the Red, White and Blue Restaurant. I come to find out that my favorite sandwich spot is closed and Citizen's Kitchen & Bar has replaced my go-to sandwich spot. Citizens prides itself on non fancy, REAL comfort food. The vibe is new American mixed with old fashioned comfort.  The environment was great, the service and food..not so much. When we arrived for lunch, there was one other group at the bar. We were told by our server that we were the first lunch customers EVER. 

Since we were the first lunch customers, I didn't come with ridiculously high standards. I was here with the most relaxed group of foodies. I grew up in a restaurant, so I'm always pretty calm and understanding when things go wrong, however there were so many mistakes and unkept promises, I was embarrassed for the restaurant. Charles Barkley showed up 1 hour after us and still got served before us. Haha  It took us 2 hours to get a cup of chicken noodle soup and a hot turkey sandwich. We were told 6 times that our food would be out soon. The hot turkey sandwich with gravy was COLD. One turkey sandwich, one cup of soup and 2 iced teas cost us $66.00, no joke. 

The manager did not listen to us and acted as if we were an inconvenience.  We didn't get a discount, but they offered us free pastries. We  were not interested. We won't be coming back here. 

Tip of the day: You are better off going to Subway or a food court for lunch.  Take your $66.00 to STK, getting a mouthwatering steak + the mac and cheese and enjoy ridiculously superb service.",mGefFqC3PkOAR8HGdBsgnw,6,2,3,R6jbr5bNo6C1B25wqVePgQ

I will note, they ended up getting the cheeses mixed up when our food was brought out. (Not a big deal, but thought I'd mention it, and they did remove the cheese from our bill.) 

When the food finally did arrive, the omelette from the looks of it - was a little thin. It looked like it was made with egg substitute rather than real eggs. 

Round it off with 2 (maybe) 8oz orange juices and 1 coffee the bill came out to over $40.

Conclusion:
The place is okay, but a little pricey. Dimly lite like the rest of the places we've been to in Vegas so far.",f1BCgyHffNR0Er8nNZz-Dg,0,0,3,p8gytT9md8ykHq_p5ACXZQ

Sandwiches & fries done perfectly~ hot, crispy, good flavor. Had the Frisco Melt, a Reuben, Open faced roast beef with mashed potatoes. Gravy on the potatoes was a tad too salty, but the bun was garlicky delish, meats were tender & yummy. Went a couple times during our stay, and probably because of the off-hour it wasn't busy, and service was fine and attentive. Not impressed with the spinach dip & (abundance of) chips.

1943652,2013-10-29,2,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"This restaurant is so Vegas. What do I mean by that? I mean this place embodies the whole high/low theme that is Vegas. This place is set up like a diner but the menu items have high-end prices. Any entrée cost anywhere from between $40-$60. It's located conveniently next to the club Light so you go at 4AM you will see a lot of drunk, post-clubbers (like me). 

I ordered a filet mignon and fries which was around $58 (another high/low thing). The steak fries were delicious! Nothing better than some comfort food after drinking! The filet mignon was very tender and juicy too, but for some reason I filled up on the fries. I found it a bit hilarious that the filet mignon came with fries instead of mashed potatoes or creamed corn like traditional steakhouses, but, hey, that's Vegas for ya. 

Overall the environment of the restaurant was not that memorable, but the food was pretty decent. I did find it rather funny that this place looked so casual but the menu items would be something that an upscale (okay, at least business casual) restaurant would serve. I would probably end up here again if I went to Light, but not something I would go out of my way for. Plus, it's also rather pricey considering what you get, but that's Vegas *shrugs*.

The service was pretty good too. I don't have any memorable stories, but my other friends actually came here as well and saw me eating with someone and told the waitress that they were going to leave because they saw someone they knew. The waitress replied, ""Don't worry, I'll hide you.""  That's top notch service right there!

Yelp should really do half stars. I would give this place 3.5 stars but I rounded down to 3 because I was less than impressed with the decor.",1lfaNzMa7xj--SdnUyJ0Ag,2,2,3,eYKFlmCgI3vVEuuESWxmKg

Ate here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service. 

The breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like ""diner plus"" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a ""signature"" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless.

It was one of the closest food spots next to the conference rooms. It also was one of the few full menu places in Mandalay that stayed open late. Surprisingly most of the food spots shut down at around midnight. 

Citizens was a bit of a hit and miss. Two of the four times I came it was great. The other two were just ok. I liked that they had 3 sections (bar, restaurant and counter). The counter was a quick line that basically had sandwich, salad, coffee and other quick items available for immediate purchase. This was convenient for conference breaks as I was able to just run over, grab some pre-made foods and coffee before heading back. The restaurant and bar were nice for late night dinners. We came here twice to eat at the restaurant portion. The food was ok. The only thing I ordered here that I hated was the mixed green salad. The leaves were very bitter and the dressing was sub-par. Most of the other dishes we ordered were good, but nothing stood out as extraordinary. 

Everything here was overpriced. As I mentioned it's a convenient spot and it's open late so they're able to get away with the prices... But don't expect the quality to match the price.

Hearty plates. We tried a couple dishes which were decent to share or sample. Rather pricey, though, for mostly standard fare IMO. Relatively spendy menu prices aren't exactly budget friendly because Vegas, but the food should fill nicely whether before or after your bender. There are bargains to be found if you're motivated to pinch pennies elsewhere.

-$21 Fish tacos. Nicely battered fish and not oily/greasy. Fresh veggie mix and soft tortillas. Good, but not so much 21 dollars great. Southern California is still tops for best fish tacos and value priced to match.
-$18 Corned beef pastrami sandwich. A nice stack of toasty, melty, meaty, deli goodness that even a New Yorker might appreciate. The consensus winner from our table. The cole slaw side was ok, but probably should've gone with the fries.
-$18 Bacon cheeseburger. Three slices of fine bacon makes for a tasty cheeseburger and the fries were served hot and crispy. Now we need some luck at the tables to recoup the steeply marked up lunch tab.

The staff are polite and efficient, but the restaurant has a quick turnover feel to it and you do feel a scoosh rushed, however looking at the sea of people passing by you understand their desire to capitalize on the moneymaking potential.

We ended up visiting Citizens twice during our stay in Vegas and tried the following:

* Calamari appetizer: excellent.  I usually hate Marinara sauce with my calamari, preferred the gentle kiss of lemon juice, but their spicy sauce was a nice accompaniment.
* BBQ Chicken Salad: basic but well done, although the chicken had a dry 'cooked earlier in the day & added at the last minute' feel.  Pretty to look at, well sized and filling.
* Mushroom Blue Burger: this was a messy, messy meal that I enjoyed every second of.  Towering high, barely held together by a skewer, this rapidly fell apart and more napkins gave their lives here than for any other meal in Vegas.  Their sacrifice was not in vain.
* Chicken Club Sandwich: the sourdough bread was the champion here, besides that it was a Club that wasn't any more or less tasty than any other Club sandwich, and the accompanying side of fries were delicious.

Prices are higher than you'd expect for somewhere that feels like a lunch place, however I rapidly learned that everything is a little pricier in Vegas, so this is a good average priced choice by Vegas standards.  

The food is tasty but not life changing, however by Vegas standards this is a great low-key place for grabbing a quick bite to eat.",2TeE-QxklSur_lHRpThSaQ,1,0,3,jC4ELUPbFmToTqK7e4Jk2w

Never have I had such terrible service but what makes it worst is that it was from multiple people (including the manager) WOW!! Only reason this place has 2 stars and not 1 is becasue it is located in a cool hotel. No way no how will not ever stop by at this place again. Incredibly rude and unhelpful people. I was appalled at the way the manager or supervisor lady we spoke to runs this place. We walked by on the weekend of my birthday before heading back to LA around 11:30am on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that they were currently not seating anyone and to check back in about 20 minutes. We tried to ask if we can just sit at a table and have a drink but again she was persistant with more or less the same answer but in a much more rude way.  So we took a walk around Mandalay for a bit then upon our return around 12 we were told the same thing. At this point we were a bit frustrated and mad so we asked to speak to their manager. The lady came out and explained to us that they were changing cooks so could not seat anyone. But not only that in a very rude and snarky type of way, almost as if speaking and explainng was painful. We just wanted to sit out by the patio area and have a few drinks and people watch. But apperantly thats way to much to ask for these people. We finally ended up getting a table after somewhat of a heated confrontation from the bitter clueless manager. We had a few drinks and bought a few bread items/pastries from inside but could definitely feel the unpleasent welcome. How difficult is it to say sorry the kitchen is currently closed but if you wish to sit outside and enjoy some drinks go ahead. I mean geez it is freaking VEGAS how can you deny people drinks, she was very clear and did not want to let us sit in the patio table area she said we could sit at the bar but I guess customer service and making money is not exactly their first priority here... If I were the owner or person in charge I would seriously think about training the employees better. I know the hostess was just following directions but one would expect a person such as the female manager/supervisor to be a bit more competent with customer service as apposed to chasing money away.

After looking at the outrageous prices at some of the other restaurants we decided on eating here as it wasn't crowded at 1pm on Saturday afternoon. Average price of a meal was somewhere between $10-16 and they had a very quick moving to go line. 
Came here on a sat around 1:30 with 6 people, 5 min wait to be seated. The food was a different story. Ray was our server. He was so sweet but we waited over 30min for our food even though the restaurant was less than 1/2 full. 
As my friend said: ""this is the quintessential restaurant that needs to serve bread or chips."" The waiting time was horrible as everyone in the restaurant can see the kitchen and see the food being lined up and just waiting to come to the table. 
We ordered fish tacos, loco moco and frisco melt.
1)Fish tacos came with 3 tacos and all the fixings: gauc, salsa and sour cream
2)Locomoco was a substantial size but pretty pricey for 17$ and IT IS NOT A BURGER. it is literally rice served with a hamburger patty and gravy and an egg overeasy. Really not sure why it is listed under the burger section
3) 2 of us order the FRISCO MELT: totally bomb and the price of 16$ on the strip was great. Melty melty cheese with sourdough bread and fried onions served with mayo and ketchup and French fries on the side. 
Mouth already watering even just thinking about it. Great meal for a pre-drinking night on the strip.

""Objects in the mirror appear closer than they are."" Everything's bigger when I'm there, including my appetite once Jamie W. and I settled into a comfortable junior suite at Mandalay Bay. After a long drive and just before Jamie arrived, I was feeling mighty peckish but recognized dining options at a pricey resort are not so inclusive of solitary cheapskates like me. As I strolled among the restaurants and the hostesses in their strapless gowns, I came upon Citizens which turned out to be a slightly upscale 24-hour diner and bar. It's about three years old, so I wasn't familiar with the place.

I took a look at the menu and noticed it was all-American comfort food with Vegas prices. I have to say I was starving since I had not eaten since an early morning breakfast at SFO airport. The $15 Caesar sounded good to me, but I didn't want to use up room in my belly reserved for meat. The server offered a small version for $5, which was frankly quite abundant by itself with plenty of romaine drenched in a lemon garlic dressing topped with a Parmesan crisp (photo: http://bit.ly/21GGabO). It wasn't an artful plate but it certainly hit the spot. Now back to the size thing I was alluding to before. I decided to throw caution to the wind and ordered the $36 Citizens Prime Rib Dinner, oh yes, by far the most expensive thing on the menu.

What came out was a sizable cut of beef on the rare side but slow roasted apparently for 18 hours. It was satisfying enough with a nice crust though not as juicy or laden with au jus as I was hoping. There was a bit of sour cream on the side though surprisingly no horseradish. I should have asked for it, but the place was starting to hop at that hour. It came with a loaded baked potato heavy with a molten cheddar though the spud itself was a tad on the lukewarm side, while the steamed broccoli turned out to be one chewy stalk that required a sawing motion to get it into digestible portions (photo: http://bit.ly/1pnnNuG). I couldn't finish the meat, so I took the rest back to the room where there was serious gnawing throughout the weekend.

FOOD - 3 stars...hits the spot when you're hungry and portions are abundant (consider the prices) but nothing really transcended

SERVICE - 3.5 stars...servers buzz around a lot but pay attention when it matters

The staff was friendly and remembered me after I came back the next day to order again.  

The first night we ordered the BBQ Ribs, the Truffle Cream Prosciutto Penne Pasta w/ Chicken, and Mac N Cheese.   

The BBQ ribs came at a full rack, there was so much food that it's hard to complain about but the BBQ sauce was just overwhelming with hotness and spice that I had to take some of it off the meat.  

The truffle pasta was REALLY good.  The really strong truffle scent could be smelled through the carryout tray and bag.  Each bite was so delicious.  This was really good that I had to get it again the next day.  What I found though was the consistency of the ingredients was off.  The second time I ordered this, there was far less prosciutto in the dish.  The chicken was  fine though and there were also peas which gave the pasta some color.  

The Mac N Cheese was pretty good too.  Mixed w/ ham and peas and crunchy bread crumbs on top, it was a good side dish.

While the food was not bad, the price was astronomical.  The pasta, for example, was $30 w/ chicken.   While it was enough pasta to probably feed two people, I can't help but feel bad afterwards for spending that much on one pasta in a place that's not really 'fancy'.  Of course, this is the Strip we're talking about.  So while staying at the Mandalay Bay, I suppose I'd go here again.

I visited here twice during my stay, both times only using the counter service. The first time was late night for dessert. It took about 20 minutes for them to box up 2 pieces of cake and deliver them from the kitchen. That seems a little excessive to me. Good thing they quickly made me a tasty decaf mocha to sip on while waiting.

The second time for breakfast. It is nice to have healthy options, so I indulged in a fresh made juice and a breakfast sandwich. Juice was good (I would hope so for $9!) and the sandwich was just ok as it was warmed in the microwave. We waited again about 20 minutes for the juice and the sandwich.

Also nabbed the crudite veggies and tossed the ranch dressing. Pricey, but I was happy for some fresh veggies!
The sit-down side got me through breakfast with a tasty CA omelette. I got the eggs fried (and requested them cooked in butter not oil) with avocado, sour cream and pico de gallo on top.

That's just one example.  I could cite more.   All the waitstaff are like that.  Efficient, accommodating and super friendly.

The food is a little more expensive here than the coffee shop.  Breakfasts are $17-$20.  I always get the Eggs Benedict, which is always prepared perfectly.  The Hollandaise has a subtle herb flavor that sets it apart from the typical version.  The breakfast potatoes are simple, yet delicious.  If you order anything with breakfast potatoes be sure to get a side of their sausage gravy.  It's outstanding and absolutely loaded with sausage.

My wife typically gets some sort of fresh fruit bowl.   I can verify the berries were fresh and delicious.  My nephew had the french toast, which comes topped with those same fresh berries, and it looked really good.  

They serve Lavazza for their house coffee here.  They use it for their espresso beverages, too.  Good stuff!

But we will definately not be going there again and I will let everyone know what happened so they don't have to experience it themselves.

It took them 3 weeks to refund the $45 while I had to text and call everyday.

My friend had the nachos and we would never have guessed they would be a mountain of nachos.  Leftovers were taken home.

Our waiter who was the bar person did move with urgency, but after we had ordered, his attention seemed to grow less patient with us and he engaged with us much less than everyone else around us. This was most noticeable when asking to box up the leftovers. He made a comment to boxing the nachos that seemed to imply he didn't want to waste his time if we were not going to take it home.  His facial expression and tone made it seem like we were going to waste his time by asking to box the nachos.  Even the gentleman sitting next to us caught wind of it and was slightly put off by the remark.

None of us have ever been here and we love trying out new places to eat. Breakfast was on our minds and we were happy to have chosen this place.

I'll be honest, the food was amazing but I felt that it is just shy of being unique. The menu had some really great ideas but I feel like some items could be easily found in other restaurants. I think I may have to come back in the future and see if they've found their true character and add new items that would showcase the true essence of what this restaurant could be.

For that reason, I gave 4 stars.

But, let me share what I did love. The customer  experience. From the hostesses who greeted us and our waitress Jenna who was the most gracious host, was very attentive and made sure we were doing well throughout the whole time we were there.

The food was delicious. My cheesecake and creme brûlée French toast was delicious. Huge in portion with fresh fruit and a nice orange creme was really good. I think to take this dish up a notch would be maybe add the brûlée experience. 

My coworkers ordered the Ham and eggs plate, bagels lox, & the crab cake Benedict (great idea).

The pastry counter wasn't really impressive, many of the items resemble pastries I could purchase at a commercial cafe chain.

The food and experience though, was just right for myself and my colleagues.

The first time we went, we stopped for lunch and sat on the patio. My coworker ordered a burger and asked for no onions on it. I ordered the fish tacos. We waited a good 25 minutes for our food, which is an eternity in lunch hour time, and the restaurant wasn't even close to full. When our food arrived, my coworkers burger had onions on it. He stated this to the waitress and she just gave him a dead stare and then walked off. He picked them off, and said the rest of the burger was ok. 

The fish tacos were itty bitty. I was confused and wondered if I had accidentally ordered off the appetizer menu, but nope....they were listed as one of the lunch specialities of the place. The three tiniest fish tacos of my life were not worth the $24 price tag attached to them, especially since my only ""sides"" were tiny cups of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole to put on the tiny tacos. If, after spending $24 on three tacos I have to stop somewhere else to get something to eat so I don't pass out from hunger by 2:00, we have a problem. Our waitress ignored us, and we had to ask for every single drink refill we got. 

I was ready to boycott the place for life, but my coworker is a more kind and forgiving soul than I am (or a glutton for punishment), so we went back for breakfast a couple of days later. We each ordered an omelet. My coworker asked for no guacamole on his....and they messed up his order.....again. I ordered a denver omelet and washed it down with some of the worst coffee of my life (which was $4...yes, for a cup of black coffee.....yes, you read that right). 

My coworker bought both of these meals, and I can't say I would ever come back, even if the food was being paid for by someone else. I am giving the place two stars because the decor inside is nice and the fish tacos (all six bites of 'em) were tasty.

I always order over the phone so that the food would be ready. Over the phone would be great if they answered their phones.  I've tried three times to place phone orders, the first time after 43 min of calling and getting the hotel involved they would not answer their phone, I ended up driving down there to place my order.  Second time I came here I decided to try calling again. Yayyyy they picked up the phone...then put me on hold... an hour and 38 min later I drove down still being on hold to show them that no one is answering and that I was on hold for an hour and 38 min.  I spoke with the manager (Shawn) and  he apologized and said there must be something wrong with the phones.  I called as he was standing there and voila they worked fine.  Weird.  Today a month later, I decided to try my luck one more time.  Driving past state line I called and someone answered the phone yayyyyy... NOPE. Again placed on hold and drove all the way to the Mandalay again to show the same manager that I've been on hold 38 min.    He apologized and again gave me there must be something wrong with the phone schpeal.  Tried calling while standing there and holy cow the phones worked.   When I was on hold all of these times I tried calling on three way to see if they would pick up and the phone just rang and rang. 

Back to today, I placed my order to be told they are all out of the bread that my 5 sandwiches come on..  I asked for a croissant instead and a girl named  Heather said you need to pay extra for that.  Super condescending and rude.  The only one that handled this professionally was Sarah.  Jessica decided to come to me and directly  say you need to move your bags(the food) they just brought out to me off the counter.  She argued in front of the customers and two other customers stated that the customer service is horrible.  Was this girl for real??? After everything I've been put through she is raising her voice in front of other guest and telling me to move my food bags in a condescending voice.  Ughhh.  So sad the food is really good here but they need to clean house and hire staff that knows how to work with guests.  Thanks Sarah for your help!   Shawn the manager just kind of looked at me glossy eyed  both times I spoke to him so I'm not sure he's going to address the issues at hand.  Some how the staff acted as if I was in the wrong here.

The calamari was tasty and lightly beaded. It was great even without the two sauces it comes with - cocktail and Thai chili. The salad was crisp and as fresh as you'd expect with a couple of large croutons. The French onion soup was savory with shredded onions and a layer of gooey cheese. No croutons in the soup and it was on the slightly sweeter side. The steak itself was good. I ordered it medium and it was a full 16oz steak. The fruit bowl was a nice way to finish it all off.

The penne was cooked perfectly but the sauce to pasta ratio was way off, the penne was swimming. After the club I had the fish and chips. The cod is nice and large but its the breading that killed the dish for me. The cod was beer battered but there was so much beer in the batter, it made my fish taste like fried bud light.

Nice décor inside, relaxing, place felt comfy and welcoming for all. Menu looked pretty good with burgers, sandwiches, salads, some signature entrees and a bonus that they serve breakfast all day. My coworkers and I ordered a round of drinks first, they too have a nice beer list, cocktails and wine list to get you going.  

We decided to get some potato skins as an appetizer and it was pretty good, thick cut potato wedge with some bacon sprinkled on top and of course melty cheese on top with green onions. 
You get 4 per order with guac, sour cream and pico.  We were quite hungry so we devoured it in minutes.  

As for my main, I got the Mahi Tacos, 3 grilled Mahi pieces with all the normal fixin's such as pico de gallo, cabbage and avocado slices. Served with their usual friends of guac, sour cream and more pico. Fish was nicely cooked and good sized pieces and flavorful.  Anything with avocado or guacamole makes it that much better.  

Forgot what my coworkers ordered but they enjoyed their first Vegas meal very much. Stayed a bit longer to have a few more drinks so no room for dessert.

So disappointing. After an amazing show at House of Blues, my friends and I were starving. We wandered through our hotel looking to see what was open and had a menu of lighter fare and found Citizens. They could seat us right away so we went for it.

The service was horrific. Slow, and when our waiter did show up he was so quiet you could barely hear him and anything we did understand, he was a but rude. We ordered our sandwiches, soups, pastas, etc. and he disappeared. Drinks were barely filled and it took ages to get our food.

Once we actually got our food, it was nothing to write home about - although my club-like sandwich was huge. However, it was so dry it was very hard to get through. My pasta salad was pretty decent, but not really what you want to be excited about when you order a sandwich. 

This is definitely on my list to avoid in the future - I'd probably have to be desperate to eat here again.  Pretty disappointing since it seemed like it should have been a good experience.",hTEKSL52x8cUUlHpUEx4lw,3,2,2,7XWTZlg9D2NLQQjPRyfYVA

I was raising that concern to my friend until the cashier barked at us ""SINCE YOU GUYS ARE MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS, JUST TAKE THE WATER AND DON'T PAY. IT'S FREE"".  Incredibly rude.

I tried to not overreact and ignored her flagrant unprofessionalism, and proceeded to sit down to eat my sandwich.

I looked around to see if the indoor tables were closed or something, but there were a bunch of people sitting around us.

I want to first say that our server was amazing and tried his best to give us the best service ever. Thank you!! 

My friend and I were hungry after a late night on the town, we were staying at MB and were craving burgers. We got there and were seated right away. My friend ordered the French Dip Steak and it was horrible! The meat was dryer than the Las Vegas heat, no taste! The soup that came with it was bland and the pasta was disgusting. Meanwhile I had the hamburger that had no taste to it. 

Now usually if we were paying a cheap price, you get what you pay for. But these orders were $20 bucks a piece. And I understand that it's late at night, but either lower the price or give us fresh food. We let our server know that we didn't like our food (we couldn't even finish it) and didn't want anything else. Then the manager came and basically told us that they did ask us if we wanted anything else and ""apologized"". Yeah, whatever dude.

Just bring family or friends to make a dent in it. The creme brulee French toast is another exceptional rendition on a classic with bread dense enough to soak up and retain plenty of custard and a well crusted exterior that provides plenty of crunch. 

For savory options the kobe chili cheese fries were good -- particularly the light, crispy waffle fries that held up well under the meaty chili. They don't skimp with portion sizes on that dish or the big meatball parm, which is a single baseball sized hunk of beef and pork topped with a dollop of ricotta and sitting in a pool of sauce. A less than stellar dish is their ultimate tots -- standard tater tots covered in cheese and gravy. The chicken and waffles also proved to be decent, but far less memorable than the other dishes we tried.

Ending the meal was an excellent house-made carrot cake. It's moist and dense spice cake foundation with subtle hints of carrot were complimented by plenty of sweetness from a smooth and creamy cream cheese icing.

There was really nothing good about this dining experience. Let's start with the waiter, ""Erick"".  Someone needs to explain to him that good customer service does not include a phony, smarmy attitude. Erick didn't seem to comprehend that when a customer has an issue, he needs to respond, not just give lip service. Citizen's Kitchen is supposed to offer comfort food. But it isn't comfortable on any level. After I was seated, it took Erick quite a while to approach. I ordered the potato skins appetizer and the BLT & A sandwich. It took forever for the appetizer to be brought to the table. The potato skins looked great, but were cut so thick that the potato remained raw and hard. Difficult to eat and cold and bland. To make matters worse, the sandwich came out within two minutes of the appetizer, forcing me to try and quickly eat the appetizers so I could get to the sandwich and fries before they turned cold. When I mentioned this to Erick, I got a blank stare and an apology. But no action. Sure enough, by the time I got done with the appetizer, the sandwich and fries were cold and hard. Again, Erick didn't seem able to comprehend why this was an issue. No action. Eventually the manager ""PJ"" came by and I asked him why they served appetizers and entrees together. He stated they didn't. I explained my situation. He apologized and offered to correct the situation. But by that time, it was too late. Raw potato skins and cold BLT aren't a great meal. In fairness, PJ did take 10% off my bill. But I'd rather have a good meal than a discount.

After we got our food, we noticed the waitress so involved with Mia Hamm and her guest. We finally made eye contact and asked for our bill. When I gave her my credit card, the waitress came back with my reciepts to be signed. I was writing a tip and calculating my total when the waitress came back. She apologized and said she accidentally put Mia Hamm's table on my credit card. She said, since they didn't close the bill, my credit card will not be charged. WRONG! I went on my bank statement that day and I seen two charges for Citizen's. One charge finally dropped off two days later. 

I wouldn't come back again. There food is ridicously over priced for what it is. There are a ton of other great restaurants in Vegas.",XMmAJfiKPkXTZGs5QIwycA,2,0,2,B_wA_zdNcQ7K0X_7mSx-Ug

I shared the Tarragon Chicken Salad Sandwich (with a side of potato salad) and the Kobe Beef Fries with a friend. The sandwich was really good! It comes on toasted bread which works well with the texture of the chicken salad. It's a good size too. The potato salad was ok, but nothing special. 

The fries were actually really good, but I don't know if they are worth the price. I think you lose some of the kobe flavor when you mix it with chili. Still, really tasty!

Service was really great too. Our waiter was on top of his stuff, and he was straightforward about everything in the menu and his suggestions (which I have grown to appreciate in a waiter).",-RApyq06DMBii7ovXtQnfw,1,0,4,fyDlJHi0Xfg7EywNBoR8Cg
3722148,2018-02-14,0,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"My friend and I were staying at the Delano and by night three of the trip, we were exhausted from all of our fun. It was around 9pm and we hadn't had dinner so we decided on Citizens because it was close and easy. It was by far the worst meal we had all weekend.

Pros: The service was excellent. Our waitress was really friendly and checked in throughout the meal. The food was brought out quickly. We split a salad and they were nice enough to portion it onto two plates in the kitchen.

Cons: The food was bad and expensive. The mixed greens salad was as described on the menu, lettuce with carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes, but like 95% lettuce. To be fair, it was a very large portion. The dressing could've been better. The Teriyaki Bowl was literally a bowl of brown rice with maybe a half a cup of vegetables on top, for $22. It felt like something a student would make to save money. The nachos were the worst. They were basically inedible, but again, huge portion. How do you mess up nachos?? I think most of it came from using cheese sauce rather than real cheese.

Overall, I was let down by the quality. Our bill came to around $100 for two (2 glasses of wine, 1 salad, 2 mains + tip) We ate next door at Lupo the night before for about the same amount and the food was SO much better.

The burger was not at all what I expected. First, the server simply dropped our food off and scurried away quickly. He didn't check in on us until half of our food was gone.

Next, I never received my potato salad. Instead, I received plain fries like my friend did.

Most of the portions are large enough to split, so keep that in mind and ask your server if you are unsure. The sandwiches are tasty, we usually stop in and grab something to go to take to the pool but Thursday after we checked in we decided to eat at the restaurant. Honestly we've had way better service and the waitress had a bit of an attitude but I think she may have been a little overwhelmed with the amount of tables she was waiting on. Plus she had to deal with a few people who purchased food at the take out counter then decided it was ok to sit in the restaurant - I blame the hostess for this, neither seemed to know what they were doing. I can't remember what sandwich we ordered but we asked to split it and we each got our own fries - no split there! We also ordered the mixed green salad and the white balsamic dressing was fantastic. With the sandwich, salad and two drinks I think our bill was a little over $20. We also stopped in for breakfast one morning, the omelet was a disappointment so just skip that all together. No flavor, weird texture, not worth the $$$. My husband ordered the French Toast and that was amazing, it came with an orange flavored whip cream that was light, citrusy and paired well with the French Toast and berries. 

To sum this up:
1. make the walk back from the pool and get take out. trust me you'll be happier with this then ordering food from the pool.

The breakfast potatoes were soggy when they should've been crisp. Definitely taken out of a warming tray. 

The pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me. 

Coffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that.

We visit Vegas about 3-4 times per year, most times staying at Delano. We've sometimes had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here in a single day just because we know we could always get a super solid meal no matter the time of day or night, even late late night since it's 24 hours. A few weekends ago we were here and were so incredibly disappointed with the Ruben. It tasted like minced meat. Like as if we got the last of the. corned beef shavings. The fries were tasteless and cold. Last weekend when we were here in Vegas, we passed. We are back again this weekend and thought we'd give it a go HOPING it was a ""one-off"" a few weeks ago. Nope. We were sadly disappointed.  Tonight we had a tuna melt and fries along with chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was decent. The chicken noodle soup is $11! Yep. It's a lot right? But in the past...SO worth the $11!! Tonight I just couldn't do it. I couldn't eat it. I suggested to our server that I was given some sort of beef broth type soup. She insisted it was chicken noodle. There's NO way what was served was chicken and chicken noodle soup at that. She said it was dark meat. If it was it had a beefy taste and the broth tasted like beef and the broth was brown. I couldn't pay $11 to not eat it.

The burger itself was wonderful.  The meat was flavorful and juicy with just the right amount of spice to it.   I am not sure if they add peppers or something but it had a nice kick.  The bun was soft and pillowy - the perfect complement to the rich burger.  I usually take off the wilted lettuce and unripe tomato, but both were fresh and delicious here!  The ketchup even tasted homemade!  I really enjoyed the fries and left the restaurant a happy camper!

My server, Tony, answered some questions I had about the menu and he told me about some specials.  I ordered a small Caesar salad for a starter.  For the main, he recommended the fish tacos and I went with that.  For dessert, I again took his recommendation and ordered the carrot cake.  It was good following his advice!

The Cesar salad was a normal one, nothing special.  They could have left the hard piece of bread with baked cheese on it.  The bread was indeed hard and there was no cheese flavor.  It looked better than it tasted.

I have only gotten fish tacos once before so this was almost a new entrée for me.  The tacos were filled to the brim.  The mahi mahi was tasty, there was some slaw, and each taco had a slice of avocado along with some chipotle aioli.  There were three side containers of sour cream, guacamole, and pico.  The tacos were juicy and messy eating, but worth it.  

The carrot cake was a gigantic slice of goodness.  It was rich cake with a good cream cheese icing and nuts sprinkled liberally on the icing.

You are paying Strip prices for tacos you could get from a street vendor for much less.  The restaurant was almost empty and the quiet was enjoyable.  Tony was a great server and I'm glad I gave Citizens a try.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,7,3,6xW0pAQDezfDORZ1C9WrHA

Your selections are slim for food. Alcoholic beverage are what most places offer at this time with alcohol snacks. But wait, the Citizens Kitchen and Bar is open. 

There are two parts to this restaurant. There is a ""to go"" side where you sit on bar stools to wait for your order and there is a ""sit in"" restaurant side, which is what my wife and I picked. 

Our waitress Lotus was very friendly and and checked up on us frequently despite being very busy. Although, it was a sit in type of restaurant, the menu was very slim. It was basically a card, no bigger than a greeting card with less 10 options. All sandwiches, hand burgers and breakfast burritos. 

My wife ordered the breakfast burritos which came with nacho chips. The chips arrived warm, hinting they were freshly made. The burrito was filling for my starving wife and she could only eat half of it. I ordered the egg and ham croissant. It was good. But it arrived warm cold at best like it was sitting for about 15-20 minutes. The potatoes squares that it came with was cold. It was sitting for at least 30 minutes are more. I couldn't even finish it. 

They were pretty busy at the time, I'll give them that. But, it also got them a 3 Star at best. Would I try them again, probably not anytime soon.",x2_IKB_JMqgduri3TGn60A,2,1,3,BnEFd2kaUuTeGSNKi3GKWA

4140447,2015-01-05,3,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"Yelpers have rated Citizens at 3 out of 5 stars.  When that's the aggregate rating out of hundreds of reviews, for me personally I begin to think the establishment might be shitty.   Especially when there is a sprinkling of reviews that are at 1 star with all kinds of jacked up things being written.  ""3"" may be ""A-OK"" according to Yelp, to me it means the place is questionable.  

So if you don't want to fuck around with Citizens and risk disappointment, here's my advice:  Go to the the takeout counter and order either the Reuben or else the turkey avocado sandwich.  Simple as that.    

These sandwiches are so good.   The ingredients, the breads, the thinly-sliced soft and moist deli meat... Adds up to an amazing sandwich that I go out of my way for.   Trust me.   

Yes, these sandwiches are expensive.   Around $15 for one sandwich to give you some idea.    But damn worth it, and I keep going back for it.  For the times I drive in to Vegas from So Cal, I typically order extra sandwiches to go as a snack later on.   

But if the price still seems completely outrageous to you, I won't fault you.  Just do it if you're comfortable.   However, to put it in perspective, what did cost you to get a bottle of Grey Goose last night at Hakkasan?   Or even one cocktail at Light... How much did that cost?  How much money did you put out in the casino?   What did you spend on the stripper with your buddies?

Exactly.      So shut the hell up and get one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat!!!",GsXEiAQqEFKGJpAmECKI-Q,4,4,4,2lWX4q1M4qsMXbJbAdgVOQ

The eggs were definitely not over easy. I expressed concerns about the wait time to the manager on duty Amanda who instead of apologizing for the wait said the ticket was dinner in 20 minutes. It might have been printed in 20 minutes but that's not when I ordered my meal. My daughter's volleyball team was seated next to ours and they ordered and finished eating their meals and or food had not come out. I can appreciate a place being busy. What I can't appreciate is the look that this manager gave me when I told her the eggs were not over easy. She wasn't too concerned about improving my experience. The pancakes were very blonde looking and tasted like rubber. There are many other places to eat in Vegas go head over there. I should have went to Hash House. Lesson learned.

We sat down right away and the waiter greeted us and got us drinks. He came back a few times but we weren't ready yet, but I appreciate that kind of service. When we did order I got the half chicken over mashed potatoes. The chicken was pretty good and moist and it came with a generous helping of potatoes and also a ginormous head of broccoli which was good. On top of that I ordered a side of brown rice to fill me up because eat larabars all day couldn't fill me up. The food itself was a 3.5-4 not knock your socks off but not terrible. What pulled this down to a 3 was the amount of time the food took to come out considering the place was relatively empty when we were there. I think the chef forgot our order. They actually sent out a Caesar salad to apologize so that was a nice gesture, would rather have had them discount the meal given I'm not eating the creamy dressings on salads anymore. 

Hey if you need a quicker meal, you don't want to pay $80 for a salad and Le Fluer then give Citizens a shot, I'm sure the food order being overlooked isn't common and I'd change he review in the future if so.",WoNszw4S_j9BAIiQf1DrTQ,3,1,3,OIKMvelOTe-xuoZjrapDzg

A bottle of water was $5 - bringing our small-ish lunch to share to $40.

My All American comfort meal the Blue Beat, included Blue Cheese, Red Wine Mushrooms & Cherry Peppers. Although the burger was cooked to perfect (medium rare).

I just wrote a review for the Citizens Kitchen & Bar last week.  I mentioned that the waiter George was ""AMAZING!""   I retract my statement.  He is unethical and unprofessional.  He automatically included an 18% tip in our bill (see my original review) and not tell us about it (he got a 40% or an $80 tip on a $210 total bill).   We would have been OK with the 18% tip for a party of 8, but just tell us about it so we wouldn't double tip you!

We just checked our credit card statements, and George DOUBLE CHARGED us when we asked him to split our bills.  This means that he charged us 150% for our food and drink bill!  UNETHICAL!  Here's a summary of this horrible restaurant:

1)  We weren't told that Waiter George included an 18% tip on our bill.
2)  We added an additional 20% tip, raising his tip to $85+ on a $210 bill.
3)  We were charged an additional 50% for our food, bringing our total charge to $300+ on a food tab of $168.
4)  To top it off, the food is HORRIBLE here!

AVOID!  Shame on the owners and wait staff of Citizens Kitchen & Bar!  We're working with the credit card companies to resolve this mess!

Price: Pretty high as a quick bite casual place. Of course, this is in Vegas. But Wynn has much better casual restaurants with the same price level.

Service: If you are planning to order something over the counter, don't expect to get treated nicely. Just think you are at the local $3 burger shop, but the price is 5 times higher. First, the cashier / hostess at the counter, is not professional (I don't think they are rude. It seems like they just didn't get trained enough about how to serve customers politely).

This means that pickup lunch to carry with me is pretty important and having something that doesn't taste extremely processed or like it's been sitting in the glass showcase for days is also important. Here's where Citizens comes in. 

For breakfast, they are ok. The early morning staff doesn't seem to be very helpful, perhaps that's because the coffee is pretty weak. There is a decent amount of confusion when it comes to seating and they are pretty unfriendly. Service was pretty slow - so do I recommend coming here to sit down? Not really. 

BUT!!!! The sandwiches and salads are SO GOOD! I highly recommend the quinoa or the kale salad - both of them top my list as does the turkey sandwich. But if I had to go with one, I would choose one of their amazing salads. 

The staff here is ok and the confusion due to long lines in the restaurant can get annoying but I say that salads are worth it, just take them to go or be prepared to sit there for a very long time. Also, cocktail of choice is the Berry Wise.

They had their menu on the outside and I saw they had a lobster roll. That is all I needed. So I went to the hostess and got seated. I was told a server would be by shortly. Um not what happened. Now the place was virtually empty and I noticed my server had looked over and saw me sitting there waiting but he never came up and offered me a drink or anything. He just kept staring at me and carried on conversations with his co workers. It made me very uncomfortable. Then he finally comes up and asks me if I am ready. He offers no apology for the wait or the fact that he saw me sitting there and did nothing. He did not ask me if I wanted a drink or anything like servers normally ask first he just asked me if I was ready and had a huge attitude when he asked. The annoying tone in his voice was like I had kept him waiting while I stared at the menu forever or something like that. His attitude surprised me considering I knew what I wanted from the second I walked in and I was the one who was kept waiting but ok. I also wanted to get to the Shark Reef aquarium before I started collecting my social security so if anyone should've been annoyed it should have been me. I ordered my food and guess what more waiting. Again he was too busy doing his own thing to go check on my food. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. I know it was not the kitchen for one thing the lobster is served cold so is not like they have to cook the lobster and heat it up or anything and my side was coleslaw. How long does that take? I had already thought it was a mistake coming there because my server acted like a complete asshole but it was even worse after I tried this pitiful excuse for a lobster roll. It was disgusting. After I picked through my food I waited and waited for the server to bring me my check. I had to flag him down at some point because if not I would have sat there forever. Well wanting my check must have been a problem because Mr. Attitude acted even more stuck up when I flagged him down and asked for my check. Needless to say after $23 for that lunch I felt leaving unsatisfied and downright stupid for wasting my time and money there. The food was shitty and the customer service was even shittier. others many have a better experience but personally for me I will not ever waste my time and energy here again.

The food itself is decent.  My wife usually goes for the eggs benedict and she enjoys it - she gives them a 4/5 (and she eats them just about everywhere).  I've had a number of different breakfast dishes and find them to be good, but not any better than anywhere else.  

I find the service to be very inconsistent however.  Like others have written when they are busy service can be really slow (I know it's difficult when it is busy - but this is Vegas and you know weekends will be extremely busy - you should plan around that).  So if it looks busy and you're in a rush you might want to avoid this place. 

The weird part is that even when they're not busy service is hit and miss.  Most recently they couldn't get our order straight.  My wife was offered fruit or hash browns with her meal - she ended up being given both (although it looked like a half order of each).  I asked for bacon with mine and ended up with ham.

The Prime rib was AWESOME!  Highly recommended.  
The Mahi mahi fish taco was ok and had a spicy kick in it. 
The Cheese dip chips was amazing!  The dipping of cheese and chili was perfect filling for the late night cravings.
The Buffalo wings were ok.  It was a bit acidic for a late night food but the taste was still good.

Server was really busy and the whole place was understaffed.  On a Saturday night, one large section was held down by only one server.  He seemed very collected but I can tell, he was a little overwhelmed with the requests from each table.  We didn't bother him much but there was a tables that had many requests every time he walks by- not sure if the server forgot and had to be reminded or it was simply the patrons asking for different stuff each time.

Then my friends ordered roast beef sandwich and chicken salad but when our ordered came it was a roast beef  sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich we questioned them and they stated it was a misunderstanding so what the lady did took the bread in-front  of us toss it into the trash and said there your salad  and we ask there is a difference the lady stated yes ask for the $2

I ordered their French Onion Soup to start, which was pretty good.  It was definitely cheesy and baked to perfection but the broth wasn't as robust as I'd hope it would be, however, they sure didn't skimp on the onions!  Soup was $12.

For my entree, I had their Lobster Roll w/Pasta Salad.  I've had my taste of what a true Lobster Roll tastes like from a couple spots in the East Coast.  Unfortunately, this Lobster Roll had more pieces of celery than lobster; it was really disappointing, especially with a $23 price tag. The Pasta Salad also seemed like it was under cooked; the pasta that is.

Hungry after a night of partying and wanting something of sustenance in our systems before hitting Daylight, our group wandered into Citizens to pick up some food.

Between Boyfriend and I, we got a bottle of water, a fresh fruit bowl and a croissant. And it totaled to just over $16. WHAT. WHAAAT. The bottle of water itself was $5. FIVE DOLLARS. Even my croissant was only $3.50 (ONLY, she says). My poor wallet.

At least the food was okay. The croissant was light, flaky and huge, so I suppose it kind of made up for the price. The fruit was pretty good -- but unless it's spoiled, it's kind of hard to mess that up.

The other members of our group got various salads (I distinctly remember seeing the quinoa salad) and a tuna sandwich. Their food looked pretty good, but I didn't try it. Regardless, I didn't hear any complaints, so I suppose it was decent enough to satisfy our appetites.

It is an in-house establishment staffed by Mandalay Bay. I mainly came here because I wanted to use the credits I got from staying at Mandalay Bay. I have to conclude that if you aren't spending credits from the hotel, avoid using your hard earned money here.

The first day, I had the Chicken Salad Wrap ($10) and a latte ($5). The wrap wasn't too bad, but it was extremely plain. I wouldn't eat it....if it wasn't ""free."" Mcdonald's make better lattes (from its machines). Maybe it was, unfortunately, the person who was making drinks that day.

The Turkey Avocado, doesn't have actual Avocados. I believe it's a dressing. I had already left the premise to go back for questioning.

The smoothies are $10 each. I am from LA, but I'm not sure I felt my 'cold pressed uprising' agrees they are 'worth it.' They are prepared fresh.

Reflecting, I think my expectations for Citizens is a little too high. While the prices are high to reflect the convenience of eating at the hotel, I just feel it lacks so much. In Vegas, there are many eateries and lots of options if you are willing to look.  I definitely think sitting down at Citizens might have been a smarter choice, but the starting plate is about $17.

After waiting a minute with no acknowledgement,  I walked all the way up to her, and said excuse me, but we'd like to have breakfast.  She looked at me like I kicked her buns, then said just two of you?.  I said yes, and thank you. She said sternly, stand close!

I've been here at least 3 different times on 3 different visits and it's been consistently decent.  On our last visit, Greg took our order and was really cool and gave us attentive and thoughtful service.  The food was not bad and was definitely good enough for a cafe type of restaurant.  I liked the chicken soup a lot.

Iced tea is brewed which is a surprise because the buffet and Raffles both serve crappy soda fountain iced tea.  The sandwiches are filling and pretty good.  The presentation is nice and the fries are tasty. 

I personally prefer the tables away from the entrance but if people watching is your thing, the front location is the best part because you can see all sorts of people coming from the clubs and the arena when there's an event going on.  It's loud and lively and good to go at 2am for some steak and eggs or other late night fare.",7J6Hb7VuTsJq50iiNwqvCg,6,6,4,11sxBLuToeVcEeaGuFGnQw

The drink I got was one of their special cocktails -- I can't remember its name, but it was whiskey with some sort of fruit flavor served in a martini glass and a sugar rim. It was strong and tasted pretty awesome, but the sugar rim wasn't necessary at all. 

The smoothie I got was carrot, ginger, apple, and agave nectar -- again, my forgetful ass can't remember the name. It was pretty decent, but nothing great. I mostly say that because I didn't taste any ginger at all. It was like a carrot and apple smoothie. Meh.

We went to order at the counter. The chick at the register is super rude. I don't know what she was doing, but it didn't look like anything except looking down at something. So we waited there for her to take our order, she didn't say ""Please hold on"" or anything. She just continued looking down for 5 minutes and then finally came up and said ""What do you want?"" I asked her what's the difference between their two menus - one is an a la carte sandwich menu, and the other includes a side. I didn't feel too hungry, so I got an a la carte wich, but my bf got a sandwich plate and a side. I don't know if the girl has a hearing problem or what, but she couldn't get my bf's order right even though he didn't get anything super special or altered. Finally the meals come out, we were sitting indoors and they said we can't sit there because it's full service for people who got something with a side. Excuse me!...my bf ordered something with a side so let us sit there already. We were already exhausted from being treated so rudely by the gal taking our order, now they're saying we can't sit where we rightfully have permission to. We then asked for everything to get packaged to go so we could sit outside as they demanded. 

The sandwiches themselves are decently sized but nothing special at all. Does it warrant a $13 price tag? HELL NO! I wish I could ask for our money back because this place left such a sour taste in our mouths. I got the Turkey, avocado, and sprouts sandwich. The ingredients are fresh seeming enough, but seriously nothing to write home about. My bf got the Reuben, which poorly assembled and just messy. This was the worst spent $40 of our lives.

We only had a 5 minute wait to be seated, so no sweat.

Citizens is washed in bright lighting and white decor. Me and my gal pal were seated at a small table amid all the hustle and bustle. Our waiter promptly arrived to take our drink orders. When I got to looking at the menu, I quickly realized Citizens wasn't really a vegetarian friendly kind of place. I wasn't too worried because I was hungry but not like starving or anything so I was fine with getting an appetizer. Artichoke dip and chips it is! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a photo because my phone had died. :( The food came out in less than 10 minutes and was a good sized serving. I wasn't able to finish it all and left full. The dip had a great consistency and tasted great. Chips were yummy too.

Perfectly fine with French food and well experienced with 'modernist' cuisine, both at local spots as well as internationally revered recipients of three Michelin Stars, but born in the Midwest and raised on anything but foie gras or liquid nitrogen cocktails suffice it to say that I'm a fan of the whole ""upscale American"" movement - the sort of food that takes the shake n' bake that mother used to make and turns it into something worth leaving the house for, the sort of food that critics love to critique even though they likely cannot make it as well themselves...the sort of food being served at Citizens Kitchen and Bar in Mandalay Bay.

Open 24/7, and still operated by Light Group despite the recent Hakkasan acquisition, it was just after 11am that a friend and I arrived at the Citizen hostess podium and dining as guests of the manager it was mere moments before we were led to a large four-top at the restaurant's back corner - the low-slung leather banquets of soft leather so comfortable that one might want to take a nap in them, particularly with the sounds of Dylan, Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd playing from the speaker system above.

Obviously a restaurant of dual personalities, the weekend brunch a casual and laid back affair while late nights are said to be a raucous mess of patrons exiting nearby Light Nightclub, it was under the watchful eye of a British gentleman named Tim that our meal took place and whether an effect of being known to the chef or simply the young man's mannerisms the service could not have been better - easily the best I've experienced in Mandalay Bay with plenty of whit and knowledge to compliment an eight plate feast with enough food that it could have fed two-to-three more.

Noting up front that the 'grab n' go' section is mostly devoid of housemade options, instead outsourcing all but the cookies and a few cakes due to kitchen constraints, it was with four savory dishes that the meal began and with plenty of par-for-the-course Lavazza to wash it all down the first round was a bit of a mixed bag - the chicken and waffles excessively priced at $24 with both items less crunchy than would be ideal, though the tots and waffle fries each proved crisp and quite capable of holding up to cheese and meats with substantial depth of flavor, an adult-fist of a meatball also standing out with impressive tenderness beneath a good sear in a bath of bright tomato sauce with grated cheese adding just enough salinity to make it all shine.

Moving next to a duo of sweets, it was somewhat surprising that the Red Velvet Pancakes were not to be found on the weekend menu, but with a simple request a substantial stack of three Frisbee-sized discs was produced with each proving exceptionally fluffy and loaded with cocoa beneath a checkerboard of cream cheese frosting, the neighboring French Toast another hefty option with a crunchy topcoat overlying four supple-centered slices dripping with custard as fresh cream and strawberries completed the picture - both plates on par with the best in the city, and the former amongst the best nationwide.

Unwilling to forgo desserts, and as such requesting the rest of the pancakes be packed up, it was with little hesitation that a slice of carrot cake was ordered and clocking in at probably 12-ounces the four layer slice would prove not only enormous but also outstanding, the moist base bespeckled with carrots, raisins, and nuts amidst a bold spice heavy in cinnamon and nutmeg - a pair of freshly made cookies proving equally delicious and thus leaving one to wonder just how much better Citizens could be if it brought the whole pastry department in house.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,5,4,4c7yC-fGNHf2kvVLj6dISw

It was also vastly overpriced.

My wife very much enjoyed her turkey avocado sandwich.  She said it was quite tasty and really loved the bread, sprouts, and muenster cheese.  She's not normally a potato salad person, but she even liked that.  The only thing she didn't like was the price.  It was $17.  Were it $11-14, that would have been better.

As for me... I wasn't much of a fan of my moco loco.  In fact, it might be the worst I've ever had.  The burger patty had no personality to it.  The rice was undercooked.  The gravy wasn't plentiful enough.  Also, it was $17.  Should have been closer to $11.  At least the over-easy egg was nice.

But really.... better to walk out onto the strip and take a short stroll to try your luck with fast food than to empty your wallet here.

Yeah, the food was that bad and that expensive...

1. Chicken Soup $10.00:  Ever had a $10 soup?  I have.  I believe one was a farm-to-table asparagus wonderland of flavors.  And I've had some others at various ultra-high-end restaurants, most of which very special and very delicious.  But... diluted canned chicken soup with some extra vegetables and spaghetti thrown in?  Seriously?--ten bucks!?  1/10

2. Frisco Melt $16.00 ""sourdough, grilled onions, swiss, thousand island dressing"":  And if the chicken soup didn't blow your brains, well, here we have a burger for $16... how do they top the ten dolla' canned soup with spaghetti?--with multi-day-old leftover over-cooked cardboard cheap frozen patties.  I couldn't eat it.  Took 3 bites and threw the rest away.  1/10

I dunno, maybe if you're high and couldn't make it to White Castle?...

Otherwise, just turn around.  Just don't.

The 3 times I had to eat here was all different, experience wise and food wise. I only utilized the take out counter, thinking that this would be the ""faster"" route but it's not necessarily.  Price wise it's all going to be pricey because you're at the Mandalay/on the strip, but again if you haven't eaten all day and you have not other options, a $16 sandwich is suddenly doable and you're at the mercy of their service. I'll sum up my review in my visits:

1st visit - Was 10pm, went in to grab a quick snack of fruit and a muffin. Really wanted ice cream but they don't serve that. Was expensive but at least service as quick as nothing needed to be prepped and there wasn't much of a line. Muffin was good, too. 

2nd visit - Was about 1pm, hubby ran in to grab a reuben sandwich, not sure how long his wait was but that reuben was way too salty! Could only handle 2 bites, not a fan...

3rd visit - It was 11pm and I have no idea what was happening but it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge my husband standing there at the take out counter! My husband has the patience of a saint and saw that they were extremely understaffed but why the hell does it take the manager 15 minutes to make one espresso? The poor dude who ordered the espresso just seemed amazed at the whole process too, but you can't badger someone who's touching your food, ya know? There was people just standing there waiting to pay for a canned soda and the one of only two employees behind the counter just said, ""take it"" and waived them off.  The more annoying thing? That there was other workers in that restaurant meandering around the take out area! Come on now, help them out! 

Anyways, I was ready to leave after the first 20 mins but my husband was really hungry and again, we're at the mercy of being out in BFE Mandalay at midnight. After being in there for over 30 minutes and not even having anything to show for it, I forced my husband to leave and bought him a banana and some Dibs ice cream in the sundries store to quiet his stomach until we could get a proper meal in the morning. 

Thank goodness we were checking out the next day as well.",ZmWLeLU_bGrNiqBVAGo-eg,3,1,2,e1QOyQS_lzLqUMDvWDkuiw

The concept is open with indoor and ""outdoor"" (walking area of hotel)seating as well as to-go options. Aesthetics could be described as a classy American diner.

When my coworker and I landed at night, we were starving and quickly decided on Citizens. I went for the French Onion Soup and a side of the Mac and Cheese. Be warned! The French Onion Soup is not meant to be an appetizer. It comes in a very large bowl and was a meal in and of itself-I'm sad to say much of it was wasted, as delicious as it was. The mac and cheese was also quite good. I also had a glass of red wine-which also came in a huge glass. Ok wine, but not worth the price tag. 

Days later, when my husband and I were enjoying the pool, we were looking for food options and decided on Citizens for take out by the pool. We opted for the chicken and cheese quesadillas which came with sides of guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. The portions were large once again and the quesadillas were excellent!

The service was sort of slow but our server was friendly. The only bummer is that, since the mini frig in the room is pre-stocked and full, we had no way to take our leftovers with us.

It was Saturday night and they needed to be somewhere by 11pm at the latest. Having 12 women, getting a table ANYWHERE was nearly impossible without AT LEAST an hour wait. We were just walking around trying to find a place to take us and we asked the hostess for a menu and asked her the wait time for 12. Just then the manager, Matt, walked up and told us politely it would probably be about an hour wait. With the group not wanting to wait that long, we said thank you and started to give our menus back. 

Just then he looked over at the ""closed"" lunch side of Citizen, and stopped us. He says ""You know what ladies, let me set up a table for you guys! Dont go anywhere""  
So we watched him go over to the ""closed"" side and set a table of 12 JUST FOR US!! We had a great server (and i feel horrible that I cant remember her name) 

She was attentive and took care of us! EVERYONE was extremely happy with their food. It may seem like steep pricing but the portions are pretty awesome! 

To make things better, he was constantly checking in on us to make sure we were being taken care of and happy with our food. He even brought to HUGE pieces of cake and ice cream for the bride to be (and the other half of the table too :) )

First of all, if you opt to dine in for dinner, at least the couple of times that I've gone (Sunday after 10pm), it gets really LOUD because of the band that plays just across the way.  Sometimes you just want to wind down with some good conversation, but you can't really do that with the extremely loud music playing.  If you have a headache, forget about coming here!  When we went back recently, we opted to just take our food to go.  Anyway, I like a cozy ambiance or a place with a trendy/sexy vibe; Citizens has neither.  So no problem not dining in that time.

On both of my visits, service was meh.  The hostess the time we dined in started to seat us out on their patio area closest to the live band. When we requested a quieter table inside, she sat us at a table right next to the patio making little difference in the noise level :/  There's definitely no service with a smile at Citizens, at least from my experience.

As for the food, I definitely wasn't impressed on my first visit.  I wasn't too hungry, so I opted for their french onion soup and got to taste my dining companion's penne prosciutto.  Again, meh.  Even though we weren't impressed on that visit, we went back to Citizens on a recent trip to Vegas since we were staying at the Four Seasons next door and our options were limited for late night dining.  We ordered at their to-go counter, and I chose their cheese quesadilla this time and their salted caramel parfait.  Their quesadilla I didn't care for but I did like the parfait.  I ended up coming back a few days later to pick up a blondie.  It had some toffee in it and was tasty overall and it did not disappoint!  (I forgot to take pics of the food I picked up to go.)

Overall, I would recommend Citizens for their treats at the to-go counter, or if it's late and you're not in the mood for fast food and there are no other options nearby.  Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to have a meal here.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,1,0,3,cTaCE4Urttz1WkkLSbaDFw

We entered the restaurant. I was greeted at the bar by a man that was quite muscularity toned and had a curly fancy mustache. He had a mildy creepy vibe about him, but he was nice. At this point I figured that I would just order a Reuben sandwich (one of my favorite go to's lately) 
The food came and though the exterior was only lukewarm, the interior sandwich was what seemed like 600+ degrees and nearly resulted in 3rd degree oral burns. As I bit into the sandwich, it had the consistency and taste of what I can only imagine a mixture of elmers glue, sawdust and corned beef meat flavoring would taste like. How can you fuck up a Reuben sandwich this badly!?

 It felt  like I was chewing sandpaper in my mouth. Remember now, my mouth is already burned by the hot coals of mysterious corned beef meat dust.  Unfortunately, this was all happening on top of loss of my overall perception of time and space. It was utterly horrible and terrifying as this moment started to replay over and over in my head. Mere seconds felt like hours.

I had to work very very VERY hard to eat through the sandwich that not only was shit, but also very highly priced. I proceeded to eat it because I was starving and wasn't going to be able to eat for a while. After complaining about the food with my buddy and also seeing that a fellow customer had walked out and complained about their food, we went onto the venue. It was at this point that I suddenly felt nauseously ill and proceeded to go to the bathroom to vomit profusely and watch this piece of shit sandwich enter the toilet in a plasmatic form all while mentally transforming through different layers of human existence and universes in my head due to the trip. After I had removed the majority of the sandwich from my system I realized that I had a little bit of coke left from the previous day.  I did a couple Trump bumps before exiting the bathroom.

Overall for food and atmosphere, I confidently rate this restaurant a - 1 out of 5. 

EDIT. I just remembered that I had forgotten how shitty the cold French fries were. -5 out of 5. That's zero for you math geeks out there.",B2WUIcRFM3w0v5MtWnVB8w,0,0,1,0U_406lAHbz5FkGl1RVu3w

The interesting thing about this place that I did not know at first is that they have an actual restaurant and they also have a to-go area where all of the salads and sandwiches are basically pre-made and ready to be sold. I came here twice on my most recent visit and ate once at the restaurant and I also got some food to-go the other time.

When I did eat at the restaurant, the service was great. The host was very nice and so was the server. The manager even stopped by to ask how my meal was going. They definitely take customer service seriously here which is a good thing!

Food:
Chicken Cobb Salad- Chicken, cheese, egg, cucumber, tomato and bacon. The salad was pretty good and refreshing. They also give you a choice of what dressing you want, but I stuck with the typical cobb salad dressing which is bleu cheese. $18

Turkey Avocado- Turkey, cheese, sprouts, tomato, lettuce, avocado, lemon aioli on a cranberry walnut bread. A really good sandwich for the most part. It tasted really healthy which is good since I always eat the worst food while I'm in Vegas. $18

French Dip Steak- Thin sliced prime rib, caramelized onions, provolone cheese and au jus. Served with cole slaw and a pickle. This was probably one of the best tasting French dips that I've had. Towards the end it started to be a little on the salty side, but overall I thought it was a delicious sandwich. $19

Typically, I would probably lower it to 3 stars since the prices are pretty high for the amount of food, but it is Vegas and nothing in Vegas is cheap. I've spent over $10 on a lousy piece of pizza before so I'd rather spend $20+ on a delicious sandwich!

The smoothie I got was the ""Green..."" something? I can't remember. But it had Kale and Avocado in it, and wasn't bad. My stomach wasn't feeling to great from a heavy dinner the night before, and it had a soothing effect. However it wan't the best kale smoothy I've had, and was probably the most expensive I've ever had at $9, so ehhh... 

The breakfast burrito wasn't particularly good, but it was hearty and satisfying. They are pre-made in the morning, so you can't change anything about them. And while they are pre-made they need to be grilled to order, so they take quite some time. The worst of both worlds overall, but still was the best option for a relatively quick and hearty breakfast in the morning. 

Still, we stopped by here almost every morning that we were staying at Mandalay bay for a business conference, as there really wasn't much competition for quick morning eats in the vicinity. 

I would likely stop by and get food here if I was attending morning conference sessions at the Mandalay Bay conference center again, but probably not outside of that circumstance.",NmiS4bkFJhCTNaUp-Y1vQg,3,2,3,kaNtoaobuz2kg6eS27Pf6Q

5522412,2014-12-08,1,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"Ate here with some friends whilst waiting for a show at the House of Blues; since parking in the Mandalay Bay either involves coming a little early and grabbing a spot next to the escalators in the parking garage or coming on time, driving around for thirty minutes as you scour every level of the monolithic parking structure trying to find a place you can only barely fit your compact car into because the rented Hummers on either side are straddling the lines, we opted to come early and have a bite while we waited.
The service was fairly good, though my iced tea ran out a few times during the meal. It wasn't hugely busy, but our waiter did have several tables concurrently and I can forgive that oversight. He was still friendly and courteous. It's service that sets most any restaurant on the Strip apart, since the food is usually pretty decent but often over-priced.
The food was quite good; I had the double burger that's on two grilled cheese sandwiches, which is to say that my fiance wondered whether we'd make it to the show or not when the ambulance was called. I survived by some miracle, and came out of it with a smile on my face and half the burger in a to-go box so that I could finish killing myself later after NASA got back to me with the calorie count calculation for the thing.

You can sit down in the restaurant and have a decent menu available to you or you can order from the counter.  The latter is better, over priced smaller bites.  The former has a wider selection - Vegas strip priced diner food.

Although the decor is actually quite nice and the pastries do look tasty (we didn't sample them) we were utterly underwhelmed by the delivery.  

Our server was friendly and honest( very much appreciated) and responded to our requests for suggestions very well but we got the impression our server had sampled all the offerings and was having a real struggle recommending anything to us.  

I started off with a drink called American Pie (you guessed it, apple flavored) which was the best thing I had all night, right down to the ring of cinnamon around the martini glass.

We shared a spinach artichoke dip which had a sprinkle of parmesan on top.  The chips were a mixed bag of tortilla chips and pita chips.  The problem were some chips were soggy and stale tasting and some were crisp and fresh. The pita was mostly hard with a few soft bites.  The dip itself was lacking in flavor but tasted ok.  

For our meal, at the server's suggestion we split an entree due to large portion size.   To our delight, the split entree was brought on two separate plates.  Some establishments do not separate it for you and I thought that was a nice touch.

However the blue cheese burger was quite disappointing.  The bun was boring, the burger dry and over cooked, and the blue cheese had no distinguishable flavor from a goat cheese.   The mac and cheese with hamhock also lacked any identifiable cheese flavor with only a light hint of a mild cheddar.  The side of fries were soggy matchstick size fries.

I expected more from an establishment in the Mandalay Bay.

There are a few interesting menu items but when we asked about them, the server hesitated to recommend them.

They do have a hangover brunch with $25 bottomless mimosas.
They also have a 24 burgers in 24 minutes challenge for $40.00 unless you eat them all and then it is free.

Food is overpriced and subpar but it was not a surprise. My friend asked if it was possible to get bolognese for her 10 months old. The waitress didn't even blink to tell her ""we don't do that"". We then asked another waiter for it and then our waitress came out again that she spoke to the chef and he agreed to make a one time exception and prepare a small portion of it but that it will be $7. We didn't care about that - she could have/should have said that from the beginning. Then, after a lifetime the famous order came out and it was super spicy. It was for a 10 month old. We haven't touched it - but of course we were charged and we paid the $7. We took it home and it ended up in the trash.

5597319,2015-04-16,0,Y-S2LhHefBdnX8VP5Bh_JA,"Vegas, in many, many ways, has it all wrong. Their motto should not be that it's some sort of city-wide ziplock sealing so tightly that not even vapors can escape, the metaphorically alluded-to ""municipality as black hole"". No. Their motto should be one more truthful and perhaps more pithy. That new motto of which I speak would go something like this: Nothing exceeds like excess.

And perhaps no place encapsulates that better than this place. Want to know what's in the dessert case? Well you can just walk (or waddle) yourself over there and go look. The dessert menu has five things on it (order any of these and they're huge). The dessert case has probably 5X that, but damn if they will tell you what that is. The menu itself has a number of things on it. Order any of them but appetizers and they come on a cookie sheet. This not only does wonders for the carefully crafted ambiance, but adds a flair of mystery to things. For instance, I can't begin to imagine the food waste this place must go through, but I'm betting they toss a lot more than anyone ever eats. 

Actually, given the flavor, this is almost a guarantee. I can almost hear you smacking your lips right now? You mean to say we can get a bunch of substandard - and here, this word is best - ""grub"", served by some very smarmy prick who looks vaguely like Fred Arminsen, but is far from funny or even amusing (wait, maybe it is Fred Arminsen!), yet has a full-tilt condescending attitude that all but insists we should be grateful he can be deigned to bother with us mere mortals. Maybe that's it. Maybe the wait staff in this elegantly laid out pristine and serene little oasis from the flood of body odor and stale cigarette smoke isn't here for us, but rather that we're here for them. Now I know why I flew here. I wonder if it would be an insult if I tipped 150%...I'm in but I have to get back out somehow.

Then again, it's a great deal, if you get a lot, right? It may be expensive, but at least it's mediocre! Expensive is the nature of the biz in Vegas and comes with the territory and so, apparently, does throwing any old thing in front of people.  This place clearly doesn't care about patrons coming in and out and is one of the more jaded places I've seen. Maybe they ought to just throw all in and go for ""Citizen"" by way of the old Soviet Union. I'm thinking a food line with metal bowls and plates. The only thing served will be potato soup with cabbage and garlic, along with a small roll that may or may not be moldy. Drink choices are cheap vodka or brackish water. If nothing else, it would at least accurately mirror the contempt for the customers this place clearly seems to have.

Also, like everything else in Vegas, this place is loud.",orHVoIN1Oj_rK3KDqcGBIQ,0,0,2,-Vt4iqsF4n417tDavaxkWA

Our waiter Giddeon, was amazing, he helped us with the choices on the menu and got our food out quickly and correctly.  I ordered a veggie bowl which contained rice, veggies and pieces of steak.  It was acceptable, but I wouldn't recommend it as one of their best dishes.  My coworkers had lasagna and the Citizens prime rib dinner.  Both are huge portions and both were delicious! I should've gone with one of those selections!  The lasagna was nice and tasty with a great short rib bolognese sauce, served with garlic toast, simply delicious.  The prime rib looked amazing, although I did not try it, the broccoli was nice and crunchy, cooked to perfection.  The steak fries were to die for.  Went back the next day and had the turkey avocado sandwich- exceptional! huge portion- was only able to eat half, but it was simply delicious served on cranberry bread. The mixture of the aioli and the sweetness of the bread was perfect.  My coworker order the mahi mahi fish tacos, I think it was 3 tacos to the order, they were a good size, served with fries, also very good.

One of the keys is finding solid meals, not meals where you want to stuff yourself but something just right to fill your stomach before an eventful night. Citizens got the job done for me on this visit. Their burgers specifically. 

The meat is quality meat, ordered it medium rare, medium and medium well, all 3 times cooked to my exact demands and each and every time it was mouth watering. 4.5/5

Ingredients were fresh each and every time as well, the one time I ordered the bacon burger, it came through too. No staleness in any part of my burger. 

Bun- Bun was good, maybe a 4/5 which is good for my standards. 

Fries- For being just normal fries they left a great impression on me. Crispy and tasteful, mm mm delicioso.

Customer service was very mediocre though. That's all there is to say about that here.

Justin, our waiter, was FANTASTIC!!!  He was very talkative and friendly, and checked up on us quite a bit to ensure that we had everything we needed.  He is an asset to the restaurant.

This time we had eaten a large late breakfast and missed lunch so we decided to grab an early dinner but looked for somewhere inside the Delano/Mandalay Bay complex where we were staying. We had never tried Citizens before and were also on a tighter budget and their prices fit our hotel credit balance better. Yeah, talk about cheap! Anyway, we decided we could live without steak and crab this time around.
Perhaps it was because of our timing, no apparent conventions in town, there was a marathon actually happening at that same time out on Las Vegas Blvd, and it was an early dinner but we got the best service anyone could ever expect. Erick ""with a C-K"" was funny, courteous, recommended his faves and left me thinking ""I'll come back here to eat again the next time we stay at the Delano"" unlike some of the other restaurants there.
The food: I started with French onion soup and had a French dip sandwich. Way too much delicious food. I couldn't finish it. Erick and I agreed we both like KFC coleslaw and he said Citizens was as good if not better and I had to agree.

We tried to go here twice. The first time was around midnight. The place was empty and I asked for another table so my sweetheart and I could sit side by side. There were probably 40 tables available. The hostess told me in an extra snotty manner that they are a 24 hour restaurant so they will need the four top table for another party. My sweetheart was offended by how she addressed me and suggested we leave immediately which we did. I should not have returned. 

The second time we returned I tried a side of mac and cheese and the French onion soup. The soup was meh. The mac and cheese was cold as if they didn't microwave it long enough. It was definitely microwaved. They were out of carrot cake. It was super super expensive- around $30 for one person. It was really really loud and hard to talk. Don't go here at all.

Like many new restaurants at the higher end casinos, the interior is re-done and has an upscale feel.  Service here was fantastic--our server was very accomodating to our unusual requests, and he was speedy.

How was the food?  Hmmm... I ordered one of their signature items: the meatball grinder (meatball, gravy, and provolone sandwich).  It was missing something... I would start with a thicker gravy with some added punch.  In any case, I got the feeling their recipe was missing a key ingredient(s) and was real close to being perfect--meatballs had decent flavor, lots of provolone, and good, soft bread...

The second visit was ridiculous. There was one person ahead of me who got her parfait and was on her way. We order a parfait, donut, hot tea, and fresh juice. Everything except for the juice was grabbed from the counter. The juice took over 15 minutes. Everything was already pre-cut in a cup, all the person had to do was add orange juice and blend.

They were clearly understaffed, and for the prices they charge there is no excuse.

Also, when I was paying the second day the girl working the register asked if I needed a receipt. When I said yes, she handed me the itemized receipt. I asked her where the credit card receipt was and she said she threw it away. I told her I needed it because this was a work expense.

The service here was good, and prices are pretty affordable for being on The Strip. It's a casual place that's not affiliated with a celebrity chef, so you'll never have to wait for a table. 

Items we tried:

- French Onion Soup: HUGE portion. I think this is easily a two person starter. It was very flavorful, and had lots of cheese. The previous Yelp reviews on this did not disappoint. 

- Kobe Chili Cheese Fries: I saw ""Kobe"" on the menu and knew I had to order it. Seasoned waffle fries came out with Kobe beef chili and a mini pitcher of nacho cheese. It was good, but it was very high in sodium (probably all chili cheese fries are). I would suggest trying this if you like chili cheese fries. 

- 2 Eggs Any Style Breakfast: Yum! The tater tots were delicious! I ordered scrambled eggs and they were good. Not rubbery at all. If you order bacon as your meat, you will get three slices. It's breakfast, so it's hard to really mess this up.

The Krispy Kreme doughnut was scrumptious but the other items (croissant, cheese Danish and apple tart) tasted stale.",-u6xIwd4In3KUXPKL_bjMw,0,0,2,riXotLTXsHBU_3C_9EfsTQ

The wait staff was mediocre, nothing special, nothing bad though.  I did however get a bad case of food poisoning though from my meal, which had their salmon in it.  I did not finish the meal entirely, and the food was also mediocre (3 star food at best), but the food poisoning did it for me.  C'mon guys, make sure that kitchen is clean and the food is cooked!",S-oatbN-h7SKiWwkTWw5QA,0,0,1,RflqlS9IvWwpIv_9WbwSTw

Coffee cups sat empty for 10 minutes.  Eggs benedict looked pathetic and had no taste.  Eggs were horribly overdone.

Toast... man, what is it with breakfasts in the U.S. and places not able to simply TOAST toast?  We were served cold bread... when we finally were able to ask for 'toast', they gave us cold bread again that was slightly tan on one side.",bDga4MH5qZ7syPWI-FVeBg,1,0,1,rPomrMralRfT5iUmLpZYKw

Although the place was packed, he was on top of his game, anticipating our needs and doing it all with a smile on his face. Food was great (BLAT and Nachos) and I would definitely return, especially if I saw Erick behind the bar.",PE58HHGLfUVqCqjbbDzMgQ,0,0,5,oW0PyFwZnQ48RBWttEVgkg

House of blues has a $9.99 breakfast special so you can avoid this place",Tj6hZ4fzASRE6MquLVYQ5A,1,0,2,YUMQQQtm4-63iVqhRbefDA

I was thinking that we had a good waitress, Melanie S., when I saw her stoop down and have a conversation with a sweet looking older lady sitting alone in the corner.  I was so impressed.  She definitely takes her job seriously and cares for her diners.  Ask for Melanie to have an even more special dining experience.",tAeVvcpYB-OMB6DqsRN_YA,0,0,4,WTlgCpG9IxkiRo1qF8ZfrA
