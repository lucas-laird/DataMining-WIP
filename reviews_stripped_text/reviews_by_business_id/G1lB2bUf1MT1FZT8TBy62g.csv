Well I have had an opportunity to visit Rubalcabas Taco Shop on just about ten occasions and have found their food in the first category each time. They offer good sized portions at a value. The food is tasty and often leaves me wondering how they do it. I can never finish the chicken burrito and manage to finish it the follow day. Every time, it is fantastic. The service is good and they also have a decent condiment bar with salsa, veggies and limes.
