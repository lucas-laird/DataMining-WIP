The bad: We got their a few minutes after they opened, and the table we sat at was dirty. That means it had not been cleaned since (at least) the day before. I looked around and other tables were dirty as well. My mom asked for a rag to clean the table, and the employee didn't even offer to clean it...he literally handed the wash rag to her, and she had to clean our table! 

Also, since were dining in, I think our food should have come in something a little more sturdy than the styrofoam to-go packages their take-out comes in. 


The ugly: The bathroom. Just gross. My husband had to hover our toddler over the toilet so as not to touch the disgusting filth on the toilet and in the bathroom. 

There were tons of boxes piled high that weren't broken down; they were in the dining area and completely visible to anybody who walked in.",4x0P08d5Wcp_kZuO6IDptQ,0,0,1,h5yCOE1WReXW3dxKZXZc6Q

When I got home I realized that half the order was the wrong order. When I called Dragon Wok the person that answered said bring it back and we will give you the right items. She also told me that I would owe $1.08 that is the difference in price for the correct food. I asked her to deliver the food. She said they would have to wait until the rain stopped and delivery would cost $3. I couldn't believe they wanted to charge me $3 for delivery when this was her mistake. I told her to take the $5 tip I gave her to offset the $3 plus the $1.08. She told me if I want the correct order I would have to pick it up and pay the difference - then she hung up on me. I called back and asked for the manager and was told the manager was not in. We ended up throwing the food away. Even the steamed rice was not good.

1154220,2009-06-10,6,ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q,"Our family has ordered lots of party trays from Dragon Wok for many of our get-togethers.  After last week, however, we will never order from Dragon Wok again.  

We ordered a party tray of Orange Chicken and a party tray of Crab Rangoon.  Simple, right?  NOT.  When the order was delivered at our house, the receipt had the correct order printed on it.  When we got the food inside, however, the tray of Crab Rangoon turned out to be a tray of Pot Stickers.  At the time, I thought it wasn't a huge deal, but I wanted Dragon Wok to correct their mistake.  I called immediately - within 2 minutes of it being delivered.  Here's where it gets bad.....

The woman I spoke to, Carol, insisted that I eat the Pot Stickers in place of the Crab Rangoon and they would give me a $3.00 credit (the difference in price between the two).  Although this might seem reasonable, I had many teenagers at my house who were expecting the Crab Rangoon.  I thought - it was your mistake, Dragon Wok - you should fix it.  I told Carol that we would prefer to have the Crab Rangoon delivered.  

After MUCH prodding, she agreed, but then insisted that they would have to pick the Pot Stickers up and take them back.  I was confused - I had already opened the container and picked one up - surely they weren't going to sell them again!!  Carol insisted that they needed the Pot Stickers back to make sure I wasn't being dishonest.  (I should've stopped the conversation right there - did Dragon Wok just call me dishonest?!?!)  I told her that the driver could come in and see the Pot Stickers when he brought the Crab Rangoon, but they had already been contaminated.  In fact, my 5 year old niece, not knowing any better - had already eaten two!  I figured, it was their mistake, they should fix it no matter what, right?!?  WRONG!  

The driver arrived with a tray of Crab Rangoon, but would not come in and see the Pot Stickers.  He got Carol on the phone and she proceeded to yell at me about returning the Pot Stickers, ""Or else.""  I tried to calmly explain to her that the driver could see them so she would know I wasn't being dishonest, but that a few hungry kids had already eaten them.  She wasn't going to serve them to anyone else, and it was their mistake in the first place!  She yelled that she would charge my credit card for the Crab Rangoon as well.  I told her that it would be fraud if she charged my credit card without my permission.  She then yelled that she would call the police.  WHAT?  Over Pot Stickers? 

 Again, at this point, I should've kindly said, ""Have a good day,"" and hung up.  It was important to me to eventually end up on the same page as this woman, however, so I stayed on the phone.  She called me a ""liar,"" told me that I was ""stealing"" from Dragon Wok, and then - here's the KICKER - told me that she was going to ""lose my job over this and it will be on your conscience.""  I said to her, ""EXCUSE me??  Why would you lose your job?  Carol - if you want me to speak to your boss to let them know it was a simple mistake, I will.  There is no need to make this into a bigger deal than it is.""  

*I was willing to speak to her boss and vouch for her!!*  

After she was causing SUCH a ruckus!  She again called me a ""liar"" and then muttered, ""I can't, I can't, I can't..."" and hung up on me.  HUNG UP ON ME!  

The driver didn't speak English very well, so the poor guy was really confused about what was going on.  (And rightfully so - Carol from Dragon Wok was being ridiculous.)  He took the phone back and left.  So far, I haven't noticed an additional charge on my credit card. 

I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW UNPROFESSIONAL, RUDE, AND MEAN DRAGON WOK WAS!  

If you ever order from them, you better hope they get your order right - because they won't fix it!  And, if they do - they might call you a liar.  

GEEZ!  What happened to customer SERVICE?!?  Fixing mistakes?

All but the orange chicken was bland and severely lacked salt.  The orange chicken was the only decent thing.  Way too pricey for the awful food...we ended up throwing it out and wishing we had gone to panda express instead.  At least panda express is consistently good.  We will never eat there again.

Over the last few years, the quality (and quantity) of the ingredients has been going downhill.  Years ago the chow mein was made with good-quality, thick noodles - which are now much thinner and (tonight) over-cooked.  I ordered Shrimp Chow Mein (which I used to love) for pick-up - when we got it back home we received a pound and a half of over-cooked noodles (I actually weighed it) along with approx. 1/4 cup of veggies comprised mainly of onions, a little carrot & some cabbage and literally 7 medium-small sized shrimp (I counted). Ridiculous noodle-to-anything-else-ratio. 

I'm pretty easy-going and I don't get miffed about my food much - but this kind of presentation and lack of quality just irritates the heck out of me.

3598430,2015-09-11,0,ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q,"A few months ago I had written a review for this place. I had mentioned it was ""irrelevant and forgettable"" well, it seems i have remembered to try this place one more time. 
It was a last minute dinner option, as I was too tired to cook, or do anything for that matter, so I decided to give this place another try. All I was craving was beef and broccoli, chow mein, and egg drop soup. Here's how it went:

Beef and broccoli: broccoli had a nice bite, not too soggy, not too crunchy. Beef had nice taste and not as chewy as last time. Sauce was tasty, but overall the dish was a bit bland as it could've used a pinch or ten of salt.

Chicken chow mein: noodles were a bit over cooked and almost turned to mush once I began to chew. I was a bit confused with the noodles as I noticed it was a mix of fettuccine noodles and chow mein noodles. The chicken pieces were not as prevalent in this dish, but still had a good taste. The overall flavor was good, but again missed the mark when it came down to seasoning as it was a bit too bland.

Egg drop soup: soup was nice and hot as it should be. It had an even egg:soup ratio, as opposed to others that I've had either had too much egg or not enough. This was perfect. This is probably the only dish that was on point with the seasoning. The soup was delicious. 

All in all, I would score this restaurant a 3.5 this time. Although the dishes lacked flavor, I had no real issue with this as I saw it as something a little soy sauce couldn't fix. The shining star was definitely the egg drop soup followed by the beef and broccoli. Higher points could've been scored had it not been for the over cooked noodles and lack of seasoning. I was quite surprised with the delivery time as well, as it took less than 20 minutes to arrive. I might order again from Dragon Wok in hopes that these inconsistencies are fixed in the future.",d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA,0,0,3,Piml9kFI3UNbfvHEZtRE8g

I am super upset because that totally defeats the purpose for me ordering take out! it has now been 40 minutes since I ordered my food.  Time is money don't waste my time.

Also, for the reviews below saying this is the best chinese food they ever had.  Well, you need to go outside your box (THERE ARE WAY BETTER PLACES) because the only thing good about this place is the price (during lunch hours).",GiqgOShn2usBTk_b0KH1oA,2,2,1,Pe-Hx6OqtIGVpof2JBvKzg
4655385,2016-07-09,4,ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q,"Dragon Wok is one of those places I stumbled upon by accident. I drove from Henderson toward  Lone Mountain to go hiking. On the way to the hike, I decided to stop at the Cliff Shadows at the 215 Chevron convenience store for water. Owing to the fact that the parking lot was filled up, I drove to the back of  Chevron then  into the parking lot for a small shopping center. In this small shopping center, I spotted Dragon Wok. 

  I was debated on delaying the hike and trying one of their lunch special. My original intention was to return to Chicago Brew Pub after the hike. Dragon Wok wasn't exactly breaking the Yelp ratings record. The ratings were low. Regardless I was in the mood for pepper steak. Mother Nature would make the decision for me when it started to downpour in the northwest valley. Now I had decided on giving Dragon Wok a try. 

   When I made my way inside, it was a few minutes after it opened around 11 A.M. The only people that were inside the small take-out style restaurant were the two that worked there. I exchanged around $8 and change for the pepper steak lunch combination that included egg drop soup and fried rice plus a fountain Coke. 

   The diminutive restaurant featured only a few tables with little to look at. However, it did have a prime view of the kitchen. From this prime view, the customers have the advantage of watching the Chef make their Chinese food. 

  As far as my food went, the Chef did a fantastic job. The pepper steak and onions were delicious. The Chef made the pepper steak and onions the way I like it.  The pepper steak was soft, flavorful, and juicy. This pepper steak was the antithesis of the rubbery stuff that some Chinese restaurants pass off as pepper steak. The sauce and onions were equally flavorful. The fried rice was outstanding. Additionally the bowl of egg drop soup was good.

   The service was satisfactory. Because I was the sole customer in the restaurant it is difficult to tell how the service is when it is busy. The man who took my order then served the food, which is in a styrofoam plate by the way, did ask how my food was. The one drawback in service was that after the man brought the pepper steak lunch to my table, I had to ask him for the egg drop soup that is included. 

   My Dragon Wok dining experience was one of those times that I was glad to have a down pour lead me inside. Mother Nature created a down pour  that led me to a Chinese take out restaurant that served me one of the better pepper steak lunches and fried rice that I have had in a while.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,12,4,MzfLpkjqvpbLx4cXTjrgVA

4967171,2013-08-08,0,ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q,"I'm all for your standard Americanized Chinese food but I was disappointed in Dragon Wok.

First off I was bummed that the menu didn't offer a dinner combination for just one person (at Ho Ho Ho Chinese it's $10 for the entree, fried rice/lo mein, soup, and one each of an egg roll, fried shrimp and cream cheese wonton). I also wish they had sesame tofu as I was really craving that tonight.

I ordered delivery and it arrived when I expected it to, but the food was lukewarm - nowhere near to being hot. Also, with the sweet and sour chicken there were only 2 pieces of pineapple, 2 pieces of green pepper, 3 slices of carrots and about 5 slices of onion for the entire dish - I mean, I guess it's good there was a lot of chicken, but the variety of veggies is part of why I like this dish so much. Then, I was sad to find out that my fortune cookie was stale :(.

I'll probably give it one more try since it's the closest Chinese place and I'm sure my fiance (who's out of town this week) will want to give it a shot, but I don't have high hopes for my repeat experience.",2i-vlvGFvy9JoVzGlursww,3,1,2,2vWHcOetVOyRiMZVQfrnkQ

5673274,2017-02-10,0,ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q,"I ""woked in"" pun intended, to Dragon Wok for the first time because I recently moved to the area. As another yelper's review said, "" the chairs were all over the place"". It looked like a wreck and it just opened 15min prior to me arriving and I was the only person there. For me the mark of a good Chinese restaurant is the ability for them to make a good dish of Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao chicken. I proceeded to order both and told the cashier that i was going to dine in. She took my order and I sat down. As I watched a cobweb on the ceiling gently blowing in the wind I could not help to noticed that the cashier/order taker was also the cook. She was the only one working in the establishment. 
As I waited for my order to be prepared and watching her long hair flop all over my food  I noticed that there were only 2 soy sauce bottles on the tables about 1/8 of the way full.  The tables were sticky. All the tables had salt but only 3 had pepper. Also the salt and pepper shakers had a oil/grease film on them. They obviously had not been washed in a long time.
My food was finely done and it came in a Styrofoam box with my plastic fork that kept bending and my 1 napkin. Actually I was glad because maybe the plates would not have been washed either. My order was at par with other OK type Chinese restaurants. Nothing special. I would have given 3 stars if I would have had it delivered and not seen the wreck of a restaurant that it is. Now that I think about it I never saw the health department grade hanging anywhere. Hmmmmmmm.",IAq1_6kwzG0eksSVqVePBw,0,0,2,K1s4Il1VRYfo1_LqsIOOIw

To anybody who goes here I would definitely recommend the Egg Drop Soup, House Fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mein, and the Shrimp Fried Rice! They also have very big portions sometimes even too much!!! My family and I are locals there and we know one of the employees very well ...Lisa. This place is great you must come here to Dragon Wok the best fresh Chinese food ever!!

Food arrived hot but one container had a lot of liquid in it and leaked all over everything else. Sweet and sour was a bit bland and the mongolian beef had was almost all peppers and onions with less beef than i thought appropriate.

They have coupons on the take out menus.. you can get something free ( egg rolls) for spending over $15..  but you need to ask for it.

5939269,2013-05-05,15,ujBk7cdEvo5FkD1e0Gzq1Q,"As you can see, I'm writing a lot of reviews these days because this is my last month on Yelp. Before I split, I wanna give credit to some of the unsung and under-appreciated small businesses in the NW area. DRAGON WOK is one of the better Chinese places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. And I believe it's even better than most places on Spring Mountain. Summerlin/NW does not have many traditional style Asian restaurants. But places like DRAGON WOK are the closest you will ever get. 

This is not a generic panda express-like joint where food just sits out in a warmer. They cook it when you order it. They got amazing noodles here and the Orange Beef is also really great! 

I know that I get a lot of criticism from other Yelpers about how I tend to give ""free"" 5-star reviews out if the restaurant is operated by an Asian-American. Maybe some of that is true, but you need to realize that I am a 4th generation Asian-American whose family were direct survivors of the internment.  I'm always going to support Asian-American owned small business. But, DRAGON WOK does deserve every star I give it.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,16,12,5,H5uz3lRvAsfbuS_RSiLMYg
