The specials are always great and the pasta dishes superb - with seemingly family sized portions for the price of a single entree.  And half price Monday specials on bottles of wine - what more do you need to know!

Just go, you'll agree with me.",ncErqrCS7NC5rB0qKBy11Q,0,0,5,XnQRAuMIIQCPH_ZwEFv8hg
317327,2016-01-27,0,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"I wanted to take my husband out for a quiet meal and asked him where he would like to go, and he said the old Grape Street even though we live five minutes from DTS.  So, arriving at the restaurant, we were seated in a cozy corner table but the lighting was much too bright.  The management quickly accommodated us by lowering the lights, thus creating a warm ambience.  The food was outstanding (much better than DTS) and the service was perfect, attentive but not intrusive.  The sound level was low even though a large party was next to us.  We enjoyed a lovely dining experience.  Only when we left did I notice the name change, and when I got home and researched it discovered that there was new ownership.  It is outstanding and well worth the extra drive.  There is convenient parking, the tables are not crowded together and you can actually have a conversation.  My only advice to new owners is to maintain the quality and keep those lights down! 


We went back again and it is even better!  The service was excellent and unrushed.  This will definitely be my favorite place to relax over a delicious meal.",J-bdQF6uPmM2U7oBGOVaMg,1,0,5,bd4lZN8KGmhxB_ufkBm77g
365392,2016-05-24,1,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"We've been here when it was the Grapewine cafe. Didn't care for it much so decided to try it again since it changed ownership. We started with the cheese and fruit plate. It had 5 thin and I mean see through thin pieces of cheese on it, a handful of chopped walnuts, a handful of grapes, 2 slices of hard pear and 6 slices of green apple, no fig as the menu stated. It was basically a fruit and nut plate since the amount of cheese couldn't even cover a cracker. For the entree we split the eggplant parmesan. I like that they split it for you and bring it on 2 separate plates, but it was very dry as there was hardly any marinara sauce on it. I don't understand why there are so many 4 and 5 stars reviews here raving about the food. Maybe it was because we had a groupon for $30 worth of food so we were shortchanged on the cheese and sauce. We did order 4 glasses of wine so it wasn't as if it was a small tab. We will never be back.",vtBQomaRGUNMn8t8az1IhA,1,0,2,UJV2FT3ju-SZ5EW-I2xoag

The drinks are great. I had two of their specialty wines by the glass and I was quite surprised by how good they were. The steak I had was one of the best ever. The flavors I experienced were amazing - It literally melted in my mouth... In a grandacious way. The desserts... Yum the desserts!! Best thing though is the service - the owner Linda is the most friendly and gracious hostess imaginable. My new go-to place in LV.,zcOljYP0QD-_9Vg_dUjr2A,0,0,5,xkEmy9t7xRNUY7zGPkUU5Q

1021504,2017-04-18,0,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"My boyfriend and I came here because we had a 50$ gift certificate. Unfortunately, the certificate was for grape street, but that address. I guess Grape Street transitioned to DT Summerlin and Grape Vine didn't honor it. This totally sucked, but I could tell the server genuinely felt bad and wished she could help out. 
Also, when we walked in there was no hostess at the host stand. We weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or what was going on. The bartender noticed, and he ran right over to seat us. Which was kind of him. 
Besides these things the experience was great. Our server was phenomenal. Always filled our water when we were getting low, way personable and attentive. She didn't even write down our order... it was all memorized, and came out exactly the way we asked. 
The food was memorable. My boyfriend had the house salad with their champagne dressing. I had a taste and it was amazingly refreshing. He ate the entire thing in 5 mins to say the least lol. 
We then shared the pene ala vodka with chicken. The sauce had a surprisingly new flavor that was really good and distinctly different than others I've had before. Then we shared the Margarita pizza. I'm a pizza fanatic so it wasn't hard to impress me in this category. The cheese was a perfect blend and melted in your mouth. Tomatoes weren't overpowering which I feel like happens a lot with this type of pizza and crust was flakey. Overall it was a great meal, and we left feeling so full. 
The scenery is filled with romantic tunes, it's not overly crowded and there are twinkling lights everywhere. It really sets a tone, with out coming off too fancy. Great cute/causal date night spot.",3BjkwAISuKTymGrNBDUO8Q,0,0,4,OPljtEmiNajSKC6TfhrmtA

It was the end of a long, busy vacation and was looking for something with a more relaxed atmosphere that we could all just enjoy good food and conversation. The ambiance filled that expectation of a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. The patio was spacious and inviting for all of us including the dog. The staff was attentive, friendly and never made is feel rushed. They truly made us feel like guests in their home. We ordered appetizers, salads and pasta, it was all prepared perfectly with small twists on dishes to call them their own. I wish I could get their recipe for their Penne Pasta a la Vodka, it was the best thing I had in a long time and have to thank our waiter Luis for such great recommendations for food/ wine pairings.

1122288,2016-03-02,1,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"So I haven't been back here for a few months and I noticed a few things different this time around. The service seems to be more attentive, the steak salad I normally order seems to be more fresh and steak meat in salad is more flavorful, and the portions are a little more generous. For example, I normally ask for extra dressing on the side and this time I didn't need it. The atmosphere seems to be more intimate like its run as a family business. 

I asked my waiter if they were under new management and he confirmed it's under new ownership. Well that explains it. I've always loved coming here. Even though I live 7 minutes away from the new one in Summerlin Downtown, I still find myself driving the extra 10 minutes to come back to this one. The new owner Linda stopped by to say hi and super nice by the way. She's all about quality and service. I was fine with the way it was before, but I have to say ""I love this place"" even more and will definitely be coming back to this one. The new one lacks quality and service and you pay a premium to dine/drink there. I don't have a problem paying the premium, but if you can get it all in one place, why not come to this one.

When we waved the server down he simply grabbed and extra side of it and brought it to us. No apology, or offer to retoss it in the salad. When we got our check, we had a coupon for a take 20% off a tab non happy hour prices. We gave him it and  he discounted the ticket with the 20% but the tab was more expensive than before! When we inquired he said that we wanted the 20% off and not the HH price which was absolutely ridiculous because it was about a 15$ difference. The greediness was ridiculous and can't say we will be back again.

When asking what was in a special he would say ""oh you know"" and a I think peppers and you know...clearly we didn't know that's why we asked! Food wasn't very flavorful. The happy hour wine was a good deal but they served it in a dirty glass with dish detergent or something in it. The manager argued it was settling of the wine...he actually tasted it and agreed it wasn't sugar settled. We spent about$100 and my date went home hungry. Unfortunately we won't be back...we purchased a Groupon and already have had it refunded.  So many better places for the money! We were hoping to find a new regular place to go but this one didn't make the cut.
UPDATE:
The owner private messaged me and accused me of trying to use a Groupon on happy hour and I only wrote this because it made me mad...you cannot use Groupon on happy hour as it's stated in the Groupon...I never tried to use the Groupon when the bill came...I returned the Groupon because we were never going back there due to the terrible service, dirty dishes, and poor food. She then tried to tell me the glass wasn't dirty and was settled wine (that only happens on a good bottle) as she would say. Again we both had 3 glasses of wine...none of them had the issue but the one glass...I told the man that came to the table to try it...he actually did in front of us and said...so sorry that is a dirty glass and not the crystals that can form! Instead of taking any fault the owner tried to say they're perfect and we got such a great discount on happy hour it shouldn't matter! If something isn't good it's not worth $1. Just because you put a high price tag on something doesn't mean it's worth it. The owner also said shame on me for leaving a 1 star review.

1757692,2016-07-18,4,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"The food is fine...but you can find as good or better nearby for similar prices.  Nice atmosphere so good for a date night..  I've been coming here for years, 7-8 times a year.  But here's the problem that occurred...causing me great embarrassment.  And the owner of the restaurant did nothing to help me (even though I'm a good customer).

I had purchased a $15 discount coupon for Grape Vine online from a well known, reputable company.  I included this with my cash payment for the bill (which included a generous tip - I like the servers to share in any discount I get!)  The server returned to the table, held up my coupon and informed me that they would not honor it - that there was a sign on their door about it (that I didn't see).  As you can imagine, this was embarrassing - especially in front of my date.

I contacted the owner a day later, and she explained that the coupon company had made an error in offering coupons for Grape Vine and it had been a problem for them.  She said that I would have to contact the company myself.

I suggested that if this happens again with other customers, it would be better to train their servers to not humiliate customers - for $15!  I also found out that Grape Vine DOES offer a 20% discount to the public via Val Pak - if this had been offered/applied, it would have covered the $15 no problem - without embarrassing me.  I consult on marketing/business for a living.  This would have made me a raving fan...instead of feeling like a pest.

So for a lousy $15, Grape Vine's owner feels that being ""right"" is more important than keeping a customer that spends $600-$800 there every year.  Over 10 years, that would be $6-8K.  Oh, and what about those I'll tell about this experience?  Conservatively, being right will cost them $15,000.00.

We love eggplant parmigiana, and most of the time it is so disappointing. Most recently we had it at Maggiano's in Downtown Summerlin. I can't even believe they call it eggplant parmigiana- a bowl of pasta topped with 3 measly pieces of eggplant- no mozzarella. It was terrible. 
The only place in Las Vegas that I've been happy to the eggplant is Grape Vine. Before it was Grape Vine it was Grape Street. And that is where I found the best eggplant parmigiana in Las Vegas. It seems that Grape Vine uses the same recipe, and I'm so glad.

Positives:
Value: good
Food: good
Wine: good
Raffle: good
Half off bottle discount: good 

Negatives:
Not everyone in the restaurant was apart of the wine dinner.  Wine dinner guests were spread out throughout the restaurant.  Kinda weird when table next to us were just trying to eat while wine dinner announcements were made. 

Raffle was good idea but... more is always better.  Four bottles were raffled. It would have been nice for more wine andrestaurant gift certificates to be raffled off as well. This is in comparison to Flemings wine dinners.  

It was also a disappointment that we were unable to revisit the wines provided.  We were told they were out, however bottles for sale?!? Huh.  Open one and pour. 

Overall I will be back for happy hour but will prob opt for Flemings wine dinner.  A bit pricier but worth the experience.",hJqBNS5Tdo9Du-s3DDpMqw,5,7,4,Ejs3__3OXizeI0mGzZXdkg

The certificate was valid and not expired, and was for the correct restaurant.  I'd be happy to post a picture of the unused certificate.

I love the atmosphere! It's as if you're dining in a rustic wine cellar. It really adds to the experience. But this isn't an HGTV show, so let's get to the food. 

Grape Vine's calamari is some of the better calamari I've had; tender, but not chewy, with just the right amount of breading and seasoning. Their mushroom risotto is HEAVENLY! It comes as a side dish with the lamb chops, but honestly, next time I'm asking if I can have an entree-sized portion, it's THAT good! The lamb chops are good too, but nothing amazing. You get six (three pairs of two) which seems above average compared to most places offering this dish at a similar price. 

If you're not eating gluten, they have a few meat options that include potatoes and vegetables. They also have a gluten free pizza crust! (But I have yet to try this)

One of Grape Vine's unfortunate weak spots is their pasta. I've never seemed to enjoy it; it's always too sticky or too gummy--almost overcooked, but I can't tell if it's done intentionally or not. 

The price is a little on the higher side, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. Get some calamari, some risotto, and try a few dishes for yourself!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,4,sgG066dEoqZlXyZLtNOlLw

This time on an average night where nothing was that busy, it took over 30 mins to place an order.  My glass remained empty for almost an hour.  Very disappointing.  Manager was sitting at the bar visiting with regulars and oblivious to the lack of service happening in the restaurant.  Not until someone who clearly knows the owner sat down did we see her get up to attend to customers.  Food is good, but be prepared to wait.  There are a lot of these kinds of places in Las Vegas, I will go there for better service as the food here is nothing unique nor grand.  Sorry GVC",MPdjtcD0AGoSxMiPwa7ikg,0,0,3,kKvkZ5LOUXSYULNtfYXiTw

4086876,2017-03-26,0,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"I am having trouble reviewing this place as 3 stars is ""A-OK"" but 4 is ""Yay, I'm a fan"".  Well, I'm a fan of some things and kinda disappointed with some others.  I say 3 stars due to the overall experience.

*  The place - the décor is inviting and ambience is nice.

*  The crowd - not too bad for a Friday night.  We got seated immediately.

*  The staff - for the most part, friendly - especially our last visit, but there has been other times it was only ""acceptable"" 

*  The food - the struggle here...  I had some items that were fantastic and some that were downright unacceptable.  

- Let's start with the bread that you traditionally get at an Italian restaurant.  This is nothing special.  A loaf, not toasted, not garlic and not even sliced.  They do give you some olive oil and balsamic (no other spices) to dip in.  Blah...if you're dieting, don't waste the carbs here.

- I have had the same thing 3 times in a row because when I go to an Italian place, my favorite thing is linguini in red clam sauce, so that's what I got here.  The first couple of times, this was ok but the other night, I got to eat the beach.  It seemed like no one bothered to rinse the clams and every bite I took was gritty.  My dogs got the majority of this meal.  So, for $20 for the entrée without sides, I would say this was the low point of my review

- I did have the clam chowder which was excellent and also for desert (because I saved most of my meal for the dogs and had the room), I had tiramisu and it was the best part of eating there that night.  It was fantastic!

Overall, for the price, I expected more than gritty linguini and clams.  $20 is $20 and that's ok if it's pretty good, but I can't rate the place higher due to the lack of care taken by the cooks.  I would rated a two if the other things were not very good.

I'm not sure I will come back after that.  I can get spaghetti lots of places for less money, but linguini with clams is not so common and I'm ruined on this place for that item now.

""A-OK"" it is.....",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,0,0,3,0qW8762UiBL_U3n5LpEXSA

1. New owners are experts in customer service and it shows from the moment you arrive.
2. Staff is happy and their service shows it
3.. Food is much better then before. Menus are primarily the same. The chalk boards are still available for easy ordering. Amazing dessert menu beckons a visit just for coffee and dessert after a movie. But dinner is a must.
4.Wine list is superior to the old owners choices, enjoyable Happy Hour

Made reservations for 6:45 but got off early so called to come in half hr earlier and it wasn't a problem. 
We walk in and the bar was full and the restaurant itself was about 40%. 
We order the Tapas as an appetizer (sorry forgot to take pic). The meatballs and artichoke fried in a pastry puff was amazeballs. Everything else was just ok. 
E ordered the bone in steak special (around $45). There was some sort of sauce on it. For the amount paid it was pretty fatty. I ordered the blackened chix alfredo. Had entirely too much garlic for me. I only ate about 1/4 of it. 
The restaurant is pretty dark. Felt bad taking pics bc my flash lit up the room lol. And beware the chairs are super heavy. No really, OMG heavy. Service was great. Our waiter was awesome and checked on us frequently but not so much as to be annoying. I think the owner (cldve been mgr) was walking around and asked how our meal was.

4573755,2016-11-28,1,F5BCXUpQpCRPeFmWnQmSJA,"Grape Vine Cafe (nee Grape Street). Though the restaurant has changed names slightly (and owners, too), this place is still recognizably a nice choice for a casual yet sophisticated meal. I've had dinner here a couple times this year and both times have left me happy and sated. 

Big wine menu, and for good reason, too. They also sell wine here in a retail setting. (It's a little like Marche in that regard). We shared a Kim Crawford Chard, and even though I generally prefer to stay with Cali or other West Coast wineries, it's tough to argue with Kim. 

Caesar Salad: Do it. Crisp and just garlicky enough. And, feel free to speak up if you'd like it a little less-dressed. A few of us at our table had the Caesar, and the kitchen had no trouble pulling back for one who requested it. Also, speak up if you like anchovies. I do, and often ask for them when I do a Caesar -- but most places can't accommodate. Grape Vine can and does. 

To the entrees: I had a special: Bone In Ribeye. Nicely prepared with a peppercorn sauce. 22oz, so it was perfect to save some for the next day. I can't say it was the most amazing steak ever, but it was very good, and at a very decent price point for the cut. Someone else at our table had the salmon (which they frequently enjoy here). Another had the veal parm - another winner. Still another tried manicotti for the first time ever - and they really enjoyed it as well. Portions are big, so be prepared for some possible leftovers.

If you can save room for dessert, get what we always get: The Chocolate Fondue. Depending on the size of our party, we might get two -- or bulk up on the cake part if we're just getting one. It's tasty and just sweet enough. A fine way to finish.

Grape Vine is in a Shopping Mall but don't let that throw you. Once inside, you'll hear good music (perhaps Frank), and your eyes will settle into the dark, attractive venue. The owners are sometimes visible, and are always interested in a chat - if you like.",yvXEJcXRtffR2GuWULbRjg,4,2,4,v4xZLCOzHOKvavcaK0WS4Q

As entree I tried the vodka sauce and I was really disappointed unfortunately. The pasta was way overcooked it felt apart as you tried to grab it with the fork and it was blend, it did not have the creamy rich flavor.  I will definitely try something different than pasta next time. My husband had the prosciutto pizza.

She showed it to him; he took it and a few minutes later a lady, who I assume is the manager, came out and apologized. She said part of the pastry brush had come off in the Brie. How can they not notice that? My husband and I have been coming here for at least 12 years. It has always been one of our favorite restaurants. Apparently, it has been going downhill under the new ownership. In addition to the Brie with a brush inside, my husband didn't get the salad he ordered. The four cheese pizza tastes like they are no longer using high quality ingredients and it took 45 minutes to get. They didn't charge us for the Brie, but that was it.

This place is very fairly price which we loved especially considering the ambiance. It is very romantic with perfect decor to match. 
We started our meal with an order of Brie $14 this is a must try and should be ordered with your drinks. We really dont like to wait 20 min for an appetizer but it was worth the wait. It was cooked to perfection, complemented with green apples, grapes, and hazelnuts. Its a must try!!
 Hazza to the chef!! The Blacken Chicken Alfredo $18 was delicious! Whenever we try a new Italian spot I always try the alfredo, if it meets my standards we will return to explore the menu further. I figure if they get it right everything else will be good too. It was so good I ate more bread so I could soak up more sauce! They also added pees which was a nice change and a good balance to the ACTUAL blacken chicken!! I finally found a place that does it right! It was not over cooked and definitely did not lack flavor. 
The prosciutto pizza $16 was pretty good considering its another item that is often done badly. The crust was delicious and crispy on the outside while still being soft inside and not thick. The cheese was portioned wonderfully. However, the sweet onions were a bit much and over powered the other flavors. Now to the main ingredient the prosciutto it was amazing but lacked in size and quantity. Over all we enjoyed it but with prosciutto the more the better! We would even pay more for more of it. 

It was a great dining experience and we will be back. It was a nice change and my tummy is very happy!! 

If your looking for a good Italian spot this is a must try.",-go-R_jzvYLYngQbfKN4_A,3,1,5,rKs041Vgu2b4O6skNb1LiA

The patio is completely covered so there is shade and plenty of spots for them to lay down. They even bring out a little water dish for Bob.  Although the service was good, their food wasn't.  Nothing tastes like it was homemade or doctored up with store bought items. 

Salad: the house salad that came with my entree looked a little sad because it wasn't bright green. Instead it was the iceberg lettuce that you can get in a bag at the grocery store for $0.99. They sprinkled some sort of vinaigrette but I didn't really like it. There's also chopped apples in it, but ehh. 

Bruschetta: I love that they add a lot of tomatoes and basil, but the goat cheese kinda threw me off. 

Shrimp cocktail: the shrimp were pretty big and juicy. It was the cocktail sauce that I wish was better because if tasted store bought. They also added more of that ugly light green lettuce in the glass. I should've asked for horseradish, but I was half way done already. 

Seared ahi tuna: I wish I read through the menu lord carefully, but I didn't remember seeing that the tuna would be crusted with sesame seeds. I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, but I ate them anyways because it took a while to serve us. I tried to cut around the sesame seeds, but I was wasting a lot of fish.

The baked brie does not disappoint! They bake the Brie in a flaky pastry, and once you open it, you will find sweet caramelized onions, toasted hazelnuts and apricot jam! They serve it with toast, pears and grapes! It is one of my favorite things to eat! Their pasta dishes and chocolate fondue is also a big must! The service is wonderful as well. Definitely worth a try!",dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,3,3,5,WRxgaKHuzLSFFBpvBGvL0g

Not exactly the best food in comparison to other restaurants, but acceptable. Customer service is good and prompt. Bartender told us to check out a special event they are having and some wine tasting before we left. We will come back again! Worthwhile to check out if you love fine dining!",Hubq8S0sM97OUpuaVcZdqA,0,0,4,lURPspMb5fUgTqmLu1j32w

Caesar Salad, Penne Vodka (shrimp were huge) and Burrata Platter were out of this world. Also enjoyed a bottle of wine hand selected by Mo. 

Highly recommended! Prices are great too!",NMx2Zxf2aLukc5SoDK5ypQ,1,0,5,5yKme8CzilmPKdwAl0rcyA
