Everyone says their shakes are made with real ice cream but most of the time it doesn' taste like.  This was legit.  Try the salted caramel shake.

Stayed at Rio a few days and this is a great location for a Smashburger that should be operating better.  I'm a Smash regular at various locations and I have no idea what's going on with this place.  At no point would they open up more than one register to take orders.  Tonight we tried again (Friday night at 7:30). 20+ people in line to order.   One person at the register.  We bailed on the line when we realized it was almost hopeless to wait through it all.  We went to the outskirts of the restaurant regroup and noticed what appeared to be a manager just standing at the back watching from a distance, and then retreating further away and not diving in to help, manage, guide, or anything.  Then he continued to look at his phone and turn his back on all of it while overlooking the casino floor down below.  Not sure why they have 4 registers if they are only going to operate one.

I ordered the classic hamburger and Baja spicy burger with garlic fries. 

The server brings it out to you on a metal tray opened. You just have to top it with ketchup, close up your burger and enjoy the deliciousness of it. 

I was a bit disappointed when I received the fries. It was seasoned. So the serve took it and came back with the fries all oily with a little bit of garlic powder on that. It looked nasty.

Located inside Rio hotel on the 2nd floor by the entrance. They open late, so I got midnight snack.I have never tried their burger and ordered simple burger. My burger was  drenched with oil. 

The cashier put sign CASH only on register, so I paid with cash. Before giving my change ($1.90) back to me, she asked if I need it my change , I said Yes. (why wouldn't I)

While I was eating , I noticed the cashier asked a few other patrons the same question if they want their change back.

I guess the purpose of the sign"" Cash Only"" was for her to get cash.

Unique to Las Vegas is the Sun City Burger, so that it what I ordered my first visit. I'm glad I tried it but wasn't as impressed with it as the guy who recommended it. Nor was I impressed with the speed of preparation - or with a cook showing other  kitchen staff a knob that broke off the grill. 

My second visit was better - although there was still a delay for receiving sweet potato fries - partly because I ordered something else and also because I used offers on the first receipt to get almost 3 times the food as my first visit almost the same price.

It's one of the few food spots open late at the Rio Hotel so I expected at best frozen burgers. I was pleasantly surprised to begin with the courteous service.  It was late (or early in the morning lol) and we wanted somewhat smaller portions so we ordered the kids meal with a cheeseburger. The two nights we came here the employees were courteous and helpful with our orders.  After placing our orders they brought our meals to our table and after tasting the burgers we realized this place was really good! I'm a big In-N-Out fan but this place was comparable in quality.  The fries were also good as they were thin and crispy with just the right amount of salt. They had fountain drinks and I was happy to see they had Vitamin Water as an option, as after a fun night of partying I was thankful for some good liquids to rehydrate with lol.  This spot is conveniently open until 4 am, tastes better and is more reasonably priced than the sports bar at the Rio.  I am still impressed with how friendly and patient the staff here is, as I can imagine all the drunks that they get to deal with night after night.

I ordered their truffle mushroom burger. The portion size was actually small (palm size), but surprisingly packed with flavor and juicy. What they lacked in staff, made up in flavor. 

They literally had one cash register open, and one person getting the food orders ready.  Surprisingly efficient, but still took forever to order since you had to stand in one line and wait your turn. 

The menu is at the overhead counter. Unless you had perfect vision, and/or 7 feet tall, you wouldn't be able to see the menu and decide ahead of time until you got to the counter. This just made the line go so much slower.

This was the time that totally pissed us off. 

The kitchen staff and the lady who was serving the food on the side were talking loud. We were sitting next to them. They kept saying that they gave us the food already. They REFUSED to give us the food that we paid for and waited for 20 minutes. Jazmin, even gave us the buffalo burger as a comp and delivered all of the food to us herself. Mind you, she was the cashier. 

First time at Smashburger and will never come back. All of the staff were extremely rude and professional. Fire all of them and keep Jazmin. At least Jazmin knows what customer service is about. If she was not pleasant, I would have resorted to talking to the manager or asked for a refund.

4889469,2017-11-05,0,JVTIY3KAIaIiL0fxY82SoQ,Had the guacamole bacon combo on my first visit to smash burger. I had the fries with the special seasoning on it which would've been better without it. The entree was free thanks to a deal with their app where you got the entree free with the purchase of an order of fries and a drink which saved me $9. The meal was overall decent but don't be fooled by the nice appearance of the restaurant as it it still fast food quality. Decent burgers. The fries are just whatever. Not the best spot but probably the best option for a low cost meal in the area.,QIb_1So2VpN-zd8rQTg6xw,0,0,3,IK2DO2uz-BaqnGk0GJbSkg

I had the big Sin City burger with a fried egg, bacon, grilled onions and onion strings. It was first rate. David had his usual big classic smash, and complained that it seemed smaller than before.

I opted for the big smash Burger and smash fries. The burger was solid. Probably a 3-3.5. better than most fast for places. The meat was slightly charred, but not overly crispy. The bacon was cooked perfectly and the haystacks were great. The egg unfortunately was cooked over hard. I didn't ask for sunny side up, but didn't get asked on preference either so I'm not sure if they typically do this. The fries were ok. Good flavor, but I'm not a fan of shoe string fries.",717xLjHppbYlJSjfRqW3rw,1,0,4,Gog2kbX33jYxHI3l6qqrbA

When staying at the RIO a lot of their food options don't open until 4pm or so (lame) so you are generally limited in your options unless you go offsite, room service, etc. Plus, when you're in Vegas for more than just a couple days, one can appreciate that you aren't going to pay a small fortune by eating at Smashburger. 

I got a classic smash with fries. The fries...I'm sorry folks, these were awful. Cold...pre-frozen, flavorless. 
The burger itself wasn't too bad. The house sauce is tasty and it was just the perfect amount. Beef patty was decently seasoned and the toppings were fresh. If I had to eat again, I'd just order something without the fries, no biggie. One cool thing about this place is that the receipt held a code for $2 off your next purchase (within a few days time) which I suppose is nice. 

This place is nothing to write home about and am a little sad they didn't really have options outside of a burger but you can't really complain when you can get a full meal for under $15.",A3Rahgq3ufx81IjbEfAbGg,1,1,3,_ZCpgqcOGqAH-9ul0udUbw

I want to talk about the over the top-AMAZNG-ethical-personable staff at this Smashburger at The Rio. We got in to Vegas very late. We were starving and tired. We got our food, scarfed it down and left to go check out the casino. When we went back to our room, my husband realized he had lost his phone. Panic set in, DEEP! We raced back to the casino to re trace our steps. We couldn't find it anywhere. I just knew it was long gone. I finally went back to Smashburger, the cashier recognized me(Emmanuel, I believe he said his name). He said they found a black phone and took it to security. As I was taking the escalator down Cedric (another Smashburger employee) recognized me and walked me over to the security desk (I was a little lost). Not only did he walk me over there but he waited with me until a security officer came over and described the phone to the officer. I am beyond words to say how thankful I am for the over the top customer service and honesty!!! Thank you Emmanuel, Cedric and Smashburger! You guys have an amazing team. Thank you!

Ordered the club burger with an egg bun. It came with avacado, bacon lettuce and tomato. Bacon was crisp, avacado was a decent portion. Also ordered the smash fries which are tossed in truffle oil and rosemary. The fries were thin and tasty but i would avoid the ranch dressing that tastes like processed Hidden Valley or similar! We also got the truffle burger which was amazing.
