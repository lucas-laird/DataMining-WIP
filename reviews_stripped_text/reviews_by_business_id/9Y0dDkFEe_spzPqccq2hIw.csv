Love the service and prizes! Prefer Patron over Ceasers any day! :)",k1-PcX4WCJzrr1pnEF45wQ,0,0,4,7rJHHgeAA82orZa2ZIqNoA

The person who took my order over the phone was hard to understand, with loud music playing in the background. I was expecting better pizza, by the info on their website. The website needs to be updated badly. Probably won't be eating here again.",QZa1yDj1vM-o94x5r3odBw,1,0,3,qiwcy8soRE-0leniOg_Byw

Loved it all.  Especially the wings! 

It's nice having some place good to eat when you work on this side of town.  It's BRAND new at the time of writing this, so my only complaint was the relative cluelessness of the staff. But they were friendly, which is good enough for me.

It's gonna be a regular place to eat lunch for me...",Zlav6Cah-JFd0d1vMQgHzw,0,0,4,f8bpXvRtSHs_Gdx3TEGR6g

For a $5 pizza, it is what you would expect it to be.  But I would actually prefer going to Little Caesars over this.  

I more than likely won't be coming back here again.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,2,1,2,y5BVM2h40VWqhVJCWqtSTA
