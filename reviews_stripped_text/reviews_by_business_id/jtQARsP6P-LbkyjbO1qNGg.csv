The menu looked pretty good but for some reason the fried catfish dinner was calling my name and not so much the BBQ. But I got the best of both worlds since my bf ordered the brisket dinner plate. I did love the catfish, it was battered just right not too salty and not too bland. The dinner did come with two sides and corn bread, I got the mac n cheese and the fried okra. The mac n cheese was okay it was too dry for me and the fried okra was yummy. The corn bread it came with didn't taste like anything at all...they need some work with that. As for the brisket that I tried it was very flavorful.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,5,0,3,yNpYCXpyivR1i4nIxx7isA

Ms. Toni makes this place like you're going home to mama's--that is if you grew up in the south.  The BBQ meals are dished out the way my grandma piled it up, the employees are thoughtful.

206587,2015-05-25,0,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,"Tried this hidden BBQ spot yesterday since I've driven by it a few times. We ordered it to go. We were assisted by a very nice young lady. I had their Sunday special dinner special smothered oxtail dinner special with collard greens and okra. The portions are very generous between the lunch and dinner portion. Okra was salted with a light sugar taste which gave the okra nice balance of sweet and salty.  Greens were bland. I was really looking forward to the cornbread, but it was ok as it was a bit dry. 

My wife had the brisket lunch portion with Mac and Cheese along with black eyed peas. I tried it and the brisket was very good in flavor. We asked about the mac and cheese and was told that it was made from scratch. It was made from scratch, but the flavor wasn't what I expected. Cheesy, but pretty tasteless. Black Eyed Peas had no flavor and it tasted like it came out of a can. I also ordered an extra brisket for my son and I asked for potato salad and corn. They gave me mashed potatoes instead of potato salad instead. 

My daughter had the BBQ chicken and we upgraded to ""white meat""which they charged us an extra dollar for, but didn't mind paying. When we got home they only gave us one chicken breast and gave us a wing. We expected all ""white meat"" so if you order ""white meat"" be specific so they don't give you a combo of white and dark. She had french fries and yams. She absolutely loved the yams! So definitely recommend that as a must get! 

Finally, we also ordered the banana bread pudding (small portion) which we almost didn't get, but the young lady who helped us chased us to our car and indicated that if we want to go through the drive thru she would get it to us. Definitely a must get! Overall, we will probably try again and try other items on the menu. I would recommend this BBQ place if you're hungry and want some ""southern style flavor"", but wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a 4 or 5 experience. I will,however, change my opinion if my next time I am here the food quality changes.",j7x4b7pvStOcQDaknTyROA,1,0,3,JHbCRcjrAueof-ODVACAkg

I fell in love with their ribs and would drive all the way down there to get some.  And then I learned that they had opened a restaurant in the northwest, much closer to me.  I absolutely love their ribs.  I've ordered their plates before, but I usually just go for straight ribs.  I prefer spare ribs over babybacks because they have more flavor, even if they aren't as tender.  

Every once in a while, I will try some other Las Vegas rib joint, but so far no one has equaled H & H for flavor.",pVcyglHUNrlYJ_2qmfSLZQ,0,0,4,nG3g-ctdSOarQrS3XGs2pA

What I mean is, when my daughter brought a bbq rib tip family dinner home from H&H, it was delicious! Prefect in every way. The meat was tender, juicy, and well seasoned. The potato salad, greens, yams, and corn bread were great! 

I was so happy to have a bbq place within walking distance of my house that has good food. Well, now I'm disappointed because after waiting a whole week and thinking about how good the food was,  I went to get a dinner and the meat was unevenly
 seasoned and unevenly cooked. I couldn't even chew most of the pieces because the meat was too tough. I had to give it to my cat and she even had a had time tearing the meat apart. 

What makes me even more upset is that I gave a tip based on the food my daughter brought to me but had I known that I wouldn't get to enjoy my meal....well, if I had known that I was getting a crappy meal, I wouldn't have bought it, let alone given a tip.

Too bad H&H PLUS 2, I probably would have been your best customer but now I can't take a chance on spending so much money on food that may end up in my cat's belly. #ABoxOfChocolates!",fZsDEEUaQ7t1lSFVbTFRgg,5,0,2,jH1Y8QJv2RzcmH418qMctg

My chicken was very good, smoky and had a delicious BBQ sauce on it. The mac n cheese was tasty, but, as other reviewers have said, it was a little bit on the dry side. It needs a little more sauce to make it creamier. The ranch beans had pieces of bacon in them and had a nice smoky flavor. My husband said his ribs were very good and the BBQ sauce on them was also good. I didn't try his potato salad, but he said he enjoyed it. He commented that the fries were a little bit soggy, but tasty. The corn muffins were light and crumbly.

We ordered our food to go.
Four people's opinions.
Brisket- was more like overdone roast beef. I have never seen brisket sliced the way this was sliced.
Pulled pork sandwich- tasteless, was supposed to have coleslaw on it but it didn't. Very little BBQ sauce was on it so there was no disguising the tasteless flavor.
Mac & cheese- the quantity was not worth the money (not even an ice cream scoops worth). Dry and boring.
French fries- Ore Ida? 
Greens - Good
Coleslaw- mayonnaise based. Not a fan. Nothing special.
Ribs- Good. Fall off the bone good. Sauce was ok but again nothing special.
Fried Okra- Good.
Cornbread- my cornbread was burnt, I mean black burnt. I can't believe they actually put it in my to go box. Others were very dry. 
We might retun to try other things and order the ribs again but probably not anytime soon.
But let me end in saying the gal at the counter was extremely nice.",1BsD4epUcB91vlzY88GBlw,2,0,2,WVeQKBGgqW7RL38inXvPfw

862094,2014-04-20,1,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,"Ok now for all you BBQ lovers out there let me tell you this , you can't lose by selecting this place for some good southern comfort food and when I say southern, I mean that good southern california back yard BBQ. That love and care you taste from grandpa and dad on the grill making it extra tender and juicy with patience.  With your aunt and mom in the kitchen peeling potatoes for potato salad with smiles and laughter. With grandma and one of the little cousins on the patio picking and curling off the collard greens in the pots looking out to all the family love and enjoying the ambiance of family get togethers.

This is everything I felt with every bite I had.  I will DEFINETLY tell you when it comes to southern food and BBQ , I am hard to please! This place has it gift wrapped for you foodies! "" Gift Wrapped "" ! I was not only taken back by the spacious and wonderfully cleaned restaurant, I too was greeted with a beautiful smiling woman who knew how to present the menu to me in its entirety. She turns around to the menu and explained so clearly to me,  what each category and meal had to offer . I was truly amazed by her thoroughness.  These days it is very hard to find clarity with any type of purchase.  So for me it was very enlightening. 

Back to the restaurant,  they have a wide open kitchen. I saw stainless steel for days. I can see their establishment is very clean and organized. As well as a very nice touch to be so transparent.  There is just something that erk's me about someone walking through a single door to get my food. . Lol 
I love that they have a variety of different tables inside to sit at. They have what appears to be a banquet room, that has a glass window partition all around it.  Lovely! I just really love the retro feel and look of this restaurant. For it to be sooo clean and look like new it's a pleasure to be in. I wish I want in such a hurry I would have stayed to eat . I tell you this though I will be back very soon and will definitely sit down and enjoy my meal.  
Before I forget to tell you I had the 3 pc combo meal with chicken, ribs, hot links, that came with two side ( collard greens,  potato salad) and a corn bread. All of which was very impressive! They have Pepsi self serve soda fountain products.  Now when have you ever seen a soul food place show Love like that? ?  I would choose this place and drive the extra miles any day over Lucille's any day. Lucille's became to dry and unappealing. Especially the lard apple butter. Yuk!  

OK also I got the catfish dinner which was very, very good too. 
So if your craving some good back home BBQ that only selected few can master the taste and texture and juiciest ribs ever,  you will be crazy not to partake this place. 
This establishment definitely has priority go to on my list. 

By the way , my daughter told me later she observed that the lady who greeted is was actually the owner. So I give the lovely owner Tony Terrell a special shot out, "" You are Awesome!  Thanks for the LOVE!!!",QN3LkHBPcUN2B1lXFf_wKQ,5,3,5,aXme_a5ZNRqKONpCIUo19A

969095,2013-06-10,2,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,"Decided to give this place a shot since the BBQ place down the way had closed its doors for good.  The BF and I were craving a BBQ sandwich for lunch so we were on a mission.  As we pulled up the parking was pretty full.  We thought that was a good sign to start.  Upon walking in we were greeted by a pretty young lady who asked if it was our first time there.  She explained the menu to us and the first thing I noticed was no BBQ Chicken sandwich.  All kinds of other sandwiches but no chicken.  Bummer.  My hopes just flew out the window.

In place of my craving for a chicken sandwich I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich with the slaw on the side and fries.  The BF ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich with mac and cheese.  The kids menu was weird for kids I thought.  The options were chicken, fish and something else.  I thought ""oh boy"" the daughter is not gonna want any of this but she just went with the chicken.  

We found a table and waited for our food to be prepared.  The place was real clean.  There were like three other tables occupied.  It was really warm in the restaurant which made it a little unpleasant being that we were trying to escape from the 110 degree weather.  They had a little party room which was closed off.  The place used to be an old Burger King so the little room looked like it was the old play area.

They called our name and went up to get our food.  As I was helping the daughter with trying to de-bone her chicken the family was digging on my French fries.  Wait a minute-I want those! Hi.  Before I could even look at my food I decided to order more fries and we needed a side of BBQ sauce.  I went up to the counter and ordered up the large fries and a side of BBQ sauce.  For a BBQ joint I was actually surprised that they actually charged me for the sauce.  Still scratching my head.

Here is a rundown of our meals:

Pork Sandwich with slaw on the side - The roll was cold, which I felt should have been toasted or warmed up and the pork was kind of fatty.  The slaw I didn't even eat.  

BBQ Brisket Sandwich with mac and cheese - Same kinda thing...cold roll, meat was a little better tastewise than the pork but still fatty.  The BF didn't care for the slaw and the mac and cheese was pretty darn yummy.  Both sandwiches didn't have enough sauce which is why we needed a side of sauce.

(Kids) BBQ chicken on the bone with corn on the cob - Chicken was great - We ordered white meat and it was a huge piece and the meat was tender and smokey. (aside from that I still think that the bones in a kids meal isn't that good of an idea)  She ate up the corn as that is always a hit for her.

Now for the star of the day - French Fries! - .they were the wrinkle style and were cooked perfectly-not too done and a little soft in the middle.  They were sprinkled with some kind of seasoning that made it a salty sweet.  Amazing with a unique taste.  The large fry we thought was gigantic (and $5.00).  It was so good we ate every last bite!  Enough said.

The sauce - had a little kick to it, was very thick and is served warm.  Still funny that they would charge us for a side.  It was pretty good though.

The service was good.  The girl taking our order was very nice as well as one of the cooks who made some conversation with me. I definitely think we will try this again....maybe stay away from the sandwiches next time.  I do think they should add a BBQ chicken sandwich still...still a little bummed about that....",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,3,2,3,nzrA4eH6kN1EyQTXCCsutg

The yams were amazing and I surprisingly liked the ranch beans even though I'm not really a beans dish lover. The brisket fell apart so it was tender but I felt like it was missing a little flavor. My friend had pulled pork with fried okra and mac-n-cheese. The fried okra was super delicious, I've personally never really ate okra before until this time, I really wanted to just order more because it blew me away! The mac-n-cheese was good too, made from scratch. But the pulled pork wasn't to my liking. It was really dry even with the bbq sauce they put in top. The corn bread they gave with the meal was a little hard and burnt. We also tried banana pudding and peach cobbler. Now those desserts blew my mind! They were so delicious! Really good customer service as well.",W2SljYahmLPc0c3TFNqh4Q,0,0,4,igsfIa3GxszDhQuJcw22Pw

I later wonder if that's the gimmick to have patrons come back. My second and third was not great but not too bad. I thought the third time would have been my last. Today I visit because I really wanted bbq and my first choice was John Mulls but of course they were closed. I settled for H &H hoping it would be like the first time. I ordered 3 meat combo: ribs, links, and brisket.  While I'm waiting, I hear only one person but apparently having a conversation with her employees.  I was wondering why was she so loud. What happens in her place of business and behind the scenes should not be public info. Meanwhile, there are a few customers eating. When my order comes up, I check my order and was surprised to see the hot links were chopped to pieces and looked more like a hot dog texture. The brisket had over an inch of fat and less than half an inch of meat attached to it.  I asked the gentleman did they change because my hot links were usually a whole link. The gentleman didn't get the chance to respond before the loud female yells out ""I'm the owner and this is how it's always been done and how would you like it done?"" I can tell then that was a real effort for her to even ask me that question. I told her whole. As I was trying to mention the fat on the brisket she became hostile.  ""Well I trim all that off but that's how it comes and what more do you want me to do for you?"" My response was my money back. She yelled out give her her money back. Told me I was a N***** at least 3 times or more in front of everyone.  Told me I was being sh*tty. She has a loud and overpowering voice. I never cursed at her or called her any racial remarks. I was shocked. I couldn't get my phone out fast enough because I really wanted to record her. I am so appalled. I felt humiliation, embarrassment, and degradation.  After reading the previous reviews of those that had bad customer service seem to have had the run in with the same person. I have never felt so disrespected in my entire life.

My hot dog bun on my beef hot link sandwich was dry, the link seemed as though it had been sitting for a while because the outside casing was really, really tough. It's a good thing it was drenched in bbq sauce or it would have been really dry as well. The mac and cheese was dry, but I have to admit it was at least somewhat flavorful. Overall not worth the $6.99 I spent. I hear the other place gives you corn bread? Well, not this one. 

Don't even think about getting the banana pudding. It's literally vanilla wafers and sliced fresh bananas in a soupy, liquid that taste like condensed milk. There is nothing ""pudding"" about it.

Didn't wait long at all before they called my order up. I decided to eat some of it there. It's a nice size portion of food for a lunch size. FYI : no drink is included with these platters.
The food was pretty good and tasty. I really liked the black eyes peas and mac&cheese. 
The only downfall I would comment on is that the food is a tad bit too oily for me.....you'll really notice it as you get to the bottom of your container. Also,  the rib tips are really fatty. The fat on the tips is equal, if not more, to the amount of meat. 
Other than that, it's a cool place. Sidenote: there's a random, separate room within the sitting area. The room has couches in it and chairs set up like a different business. It looks weird lol.",cpyf07RSNpjfSIg-pA99TA,0,0,4,GvzW7rl5973CJkKxuCiLGQ

The collard greens, yams and Mac and cheese was on the money. The only thing that I thought could've used some fixing was the cornbread, it was a bit dry for my liking . We spent a grand total of $35- that included lunch, drinks and desserts.

The service here was amazing, the women behind the counter were very friendly and always smiling.

I've been searching for decent BBQ throughout the West for years, haven't found much good BBQ west of Texas.  I was driving around Vegas looking for a lunch spot and literally stumbled upon H & H.  I ordered the chicken and ribs combo.  Damn, that was a lot of food.  
I never order ribs with sauce on them, in my opinion it's just a cover for meat that doesn't have much flavor. It was a busy day for me so I wasn't thinking and forgot to ask for sauce on the side until I noticed the sauce being poured on the ribs.  Damn.
They did not, however, drown the ribs in sauce and actually the bottom pieces didn't have any sauce, great.  These ribs do not need sauce, the flavor actually came through even with the sauce and the bones without sauce were really, really good.  Nice smokey flavor, visible smoke ring and very tender but not too tender.  The chicken was great too, very tender, I could eat it with a fork.  The sides were very good to but I was focused on the meats.  My plate had two huge breasts and a wig along with I think 5 ribs.
Best place I've had in Vegas so far and I've been to a lot there.  Everybody I talk to mentions Rollin Smoke and John Mulls, both are not very good, this place beats them hands down.

If you want smooth, efficient, basic food and service, go to Famous Dave's or something. This place is an experience, not just a restaurant.

3731332,2012-12-11,4,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,"Just tried H&H plus2 yesterday for the first time. As stated in other reviews, the building it's in is a old failed Burger King! Being this is a older area of the far North West, I was very excited to see a new business taking a chance on a older established building, not just moving to the nice new edge of town. Too many businesses abandon buildings and move to newer areas, like Timbers Bar and Grill did with their location on Ann & Simmons! Now a abandoned shanty. 

Getting back on track here, Sorry!
    
    The menu - Upon first glance I was a bit confused, not very reader friendly but after the very nice women behind the counter gave me a brief explanation it started to make sense. So I CAN order off the lunch menu at dinner time? Okay!

   All the staples were there, Brisket, pulled pork, chicken, catfish, hot links, Ribs! Lookin' good! Sides include, fried okra, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, baked beans, collared greens corn on the cob, french fries and rice with gravy. There is really too much on the menu to entirely list. including a section of sandwiches I didn't even get a chance to look at. I did see a Catfish Po Boy however.  I went with the brisket... After taking my order and getting my orange soda it was explained to me the brisket wouldn't be done for 15-20 minutes! BALLS!!! 

   Okay round 2, pulled pork with mac n cheese and baked beans it is. The pork was flavor full and juicy, drizzled on top was a delicious and bold BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce being just drizzled as opposed to mixed into the pork was a nice touch. It lets you sample the pork as it is by itself. Which was juicy and flavorful. No complaints there, A+!

   The Mac n Cheese was good, a bit dry but definitely had the qualities of a true home made Mac n Cheese, not some boxed gooey mess and nothing a lil' table side Louisiana hot sauce won't fix! I give it a solid B! The baked beans were good also. Nothing fancy, but exactly what I expected when I ordered. 

  The meal also comes with a little muffin of corn bread. Now not being a corn bread fan I don't have much to compare it too. I did try it tho. It didn't seem quite as sweet as I remember, but the sweetness of cornbread is what I dislike! I took that little muffin and soaked up every last morsel of anything left on that plate! Nothing to waste here!

 The portion size was perfect for a single meal, and like I stated earlier I order off the lunch menu which includes smaller portions. 

  After finishing up I did have just one problem. So I asked the nice cashier if I could speak with a manager. After hearing a bit of griping coming from the back of house about who wanted to speak with her, a women approached me, identified herself as the manger and with a smile asked me what she could help me with?
 
   I explained to her I just finished my meal and did have one complaint! With a very disconcerting look asked me what my issue was. I explained to her that my complaint was... ""This meal was TOO DAMN GOOD and she has forced me to have to come back!"" We all had a good laugh, she thanked me and I left happier than a Pig in...

3966849,2013-05-07,2,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,"Well if you saw my Hogs Heaven review you will know how I ended up here on a Sunday night literally 4 minutes before they closed. Now let me say this wasn't my 1st  or 2nd choice but considering the disastrous adventure I had been on to find BBQ this would have to do and thankfully I made it to them just in time. 

The place is a simple fast food looking place with a soda machine and some places to sit and eat. I think someone who reviewed it said it was an old Burger King so its interesting the kitchen is wide open and you can see everything. This is a family run business for sure....the young lady who took my order polite but I would say a pleasant personality is the daughter of the lady who owns the place. How do I know well she called her mother to give her the tale of the tap at the end day and also to share with her older brother the head cook her mother directives. So, it was nice to know I was supporting a small family run business. 

1st let me start by saying the restaurant was very clean it is clear they take pride in cleanliness which is very important. The menu was rather simple and start forward so I ordered the half slab which comes with 2 sides. They were close to closing and had run out of somethings but when I asked for fried okra without hesitation they fried up a fresh serving. Again the cashier was short on personality but very accommodating and polite. The food was prepared quickly and the cook (the owners son) let me and the other couple out and was very gracious wishing us a good and thanking us for coming in. So for service I would say they do a good job. 

Now about the food...the fried okra was hot, fresh and delicious! The corn muffin they give you was very tasty. Th fries were just fries ok. The most important part the ribs. Well I'll start by saying the sauce was very good sweet with a slight tang. The ribs were cooked really well the meat pulled right off the bone but didn't fall off the bone so you know they were grilled/smoked and not boiled. I hate places that boil the ribs then throw it on the grill for grill marks and call themselves a rib place. 

Even though everything was tasty I have to say the meat was really fatty! I'm not sure if that is just what is out there currently due drought issues and the bacon scare we had last year but they really need to look for a another purveyor because the ribs were easily 50% fat or more. No matter how great the service, how presentable the place, how good the sides or how well you cook the meat. If the quality is low there is nothing you can do to fix that.

Would I come back here....not until I try this rolling smoke place 1st and probably a few other places 1st to determine if this is the best the Valley has to offer.",gDy6k3AqlkcN4cEIkWnx_A,7,4,3,lQprtSr2atK3JyxxeZ15SA

I spoke to Toni who was a total gem!  She gave me a great deal & was so sweet.  I ended up staying and talking to Toni for about an hour.  The day of the baby brunch I was shocked to walk into the party room and see how Toni's daughter decorated.   It was so perfect and she did an amazing job with the decorations.   Toni and her staff stayed in the room with us to make sure our plates and drink cups were full.  It was supposed to be buffet style but often time the staff brought us our food.  They are hands down the most generous and polite group of people to work with. On top of that their professionalism was top notch.

Like other Yelpers have commented, it is a converted BK. You can see the kitchen which is very clean. Honestly, I go for the food and cleanliness. Not the interior decorating. The counter worker was VERY polite, helpful and respectful. It was nice to be treated like guest and not an annoyance. He obviously knew most of the customers and referred to them  by name. And in that time honored Southern tradition, he included, ""Miss"" before their name. The food. I had pork ribs and asked for the less fatty end cuts. I also asked for sauce on the side. The flavor of the ribs were spot on. Nice smokey flavor, but honestly, they were VERY dry. Dipping them in the delicious sauce improved the flavor but not the texture. As a side note, I want to bathe in their BBQ sauce. It had the perfect Umami for me. For sides I had mac and cheese and black eyed peas. The peas were good once I added a packet of hot sauce. The mac and cheese, while creamy, needed more seasoning. My daughter had the all white meat chicken dinner with mac and cheese and fries. The fries were your basic frozen crinkle cut fry, but they did add some sort of seasoning that the kid liked. She let me try the chicken breast. That too came with sauce on the side. OMG...it was to DIE for. It was so flavorful and perfect. I would order that for myself next time. A big disappointment was the side of corn on the cob that I ordered. It was four dollars and change for a large. I was shocked when I opened the container and literally saw ONE piece of overcooked corn cut in half. I thought for sure for that price I would get at least two whole ears of corn. VERY overpriced. It would have been almost nine dollars for two ears of corn for the kid and I.

I hope the lovely woman who owns the restaurant will read this review. If she would just tweak a few things like perfecting the smoking of the ribs and maybe experimenting with seasonings on the sides. Maybe adding a little bacon or ham hocks when cooking the beans.

Then the guy after us came in asked and they suddenly had 1 more order. Thats shady!!!  I liked what we ordered but the resturant was ruined by that shady behavior.  Theres many other resturants in Vegas that treat you well and have thier menu items current.",Ta0OYIgUFxPNXdO_ZAQYag,0,0,3,7q5L5EpdkQQ03zxhV4WNpQ
5537411,2015-08-13,1,jtQARsP6P-LbkyjbO1qNGg,Sad this place is a hit and miss I've been dealing with H&H for years starting at there civic center location loved that place until I seen it on dirty dining decided to give it another try At the new rancho location. Rib tips were very soft including the gristle which tells me it's been just sitting on heat or has been reheated day after day. Yams looked like baby food. Just mad me a little upset that they keep going further into bad business. Please read these comments.,rsmGwZ6MhctENKxxYwk4sg,5,1,2,Lvz75YSORDUPcQ8wEoVN6Q

Honestly sides have always been mediocre, so I bought meats and made my own sides. Today I asked my wife to stop by and get brisket. She gets home and she has the most pathetic brisket I've ever seen. Tough, like rubber to chew. No flavor other than the sauce, I was shocked. Never again will I ever buy anything here again.",x1VGulKYt1N2HmQsjac7sg,0,0,1,JLnxRrESJXHLcC7P1nyZ_g

They made the fried okra fresh which was like my grandma made. I could not have been more pleased with the portions as well as the sauce flavor. Outstanding. If you want ribs or a great sandwich this this the place. The ladies working up front were friendly and helpful In Helping us make a choice. 

Trust me this place is great.",dvm9soB_DsDSN5VS3avvkw,2,0,5,a2oHsnEnbV9Xns1up4eLGA

Our order:
BBQ pork sandwich with fries and slaw on the side
BBQ pork lunch with Mac n cheese and collard greens
BBQ brisket lunch with fried okra and ???
Sadly disappointed, so much I can't remember what the other side was on 
1. Food was either dry, salty, and most of all BBQ meat had no smoky flavor and not enough bbq sauce. I'm not even 
1 who likes a lot of sauce, but food needed it.",Yj79QbOyYO1q6ythwB3bvQ,1,0,1,LEFL9vmC0Zn2ZBR4qbhTrQ

I actually enjoy their food however I might find myself with high blood pressure if I continue to eat here. So my negative is that they ought to tone the level of salt down a bit! I recommend it but ask for no salt!",0Iy04fJxaKug-kYsi6gvWw,0,0,4,VsWpvgbtiK8j7PhtBJ_JQQ
