Some of their scrumptious appetizers include the chicken karaage and fried calamari. Both are served piping hot and crispy, as these tender morsels should be. Wouldn't recommend getting their buta kimchi since it's just a cut-up strip of pork belly that's baked on top of kimchi.

As for the sushi and entrees, they have the standard nigiri and rolls named after animals, places, or their unique in-house creations. Their selection isn't as extensive as other sushi places, but it's full of fresh and creative rolls. Don't get the roll with kiwi sauce unless you're feeling adventurous. Avoid the ramen too.

Unlike some other sushi restaurants, this peculiar place only does AYCE sashimi. The prices are pretty average for a sushi bar, but they have a 50% discount if you order at least three rolls and nigiri. Also, their service was timely, and they even offered to split our checks before we even got started.

Maybe it's just me, but I found Kaze to be average and I'd rather go to my regular sushi joints instead. However, it's a pretty good deal if you're in the area and can't eat all that seafood, rice, and nori that you can!",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,1,1,3,UkpoJmQKTxlIG7SY6T2H0g

We ordered two of their lunch specials consisting of full-size rainbow and caterpillar rolls with miso soup and salad ($10) and a tonkatsu bento box which included soup, salad, shrimp & veggie tempura, 4-piece California roll, and rice ($10.95). We enjoyed the rolls, although the rainbow roll was a bit light on the fish. The tempura and tonkatsu were nice and crispy. However, the portion size of the tonkatsu was a bit on the small side. Nevertheless, we felt that it was a very good value.

Service was friendly and prompt. We were served complimentary cups of hot green tea. The server and the owner both came by to check on us, and our Yelp deal was cheerfully accepted.

Next time, we are thinking of trying some of their classic sushi and rolls which are currently 50% off if you order at least 3 items. We are interested in trying their sashimi selections as well.

Overall, the food alone rates about 3.5 stars in our book, but the service and value bump it up to a solid 4 stars. We'll gladly return.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,2,2,4,6f9cr02y8vleWUrmDQZChw

We get an authentic Japanese greeting  each time we arrive and I really enjoy that welcome. The atmosphere is standard sushi restaurant style, nothing overly special. 

On to the food!
This place does do the AYCE, but it's only sashimi. At first, I thought that was great because most places don't do the AYCE for their sashimi. The downside however is this doesn't include appetizers or anything else but the sashimi. I wanted to get it, but I also want to try other things. So we skipped the AYCE. 

Hawaiian Roll - One of the most delicious rolls I've had in a while. It comes with a mango and eel sauce. They were awesome! They mixed really well with the sushi. This will without question be something I order on a regular basis. 

Sunkissed Roll - This roll was really good as well. The mayo sauce was a bit heavy, but the roll was still good. 

Cinderella Roll - For this roll it also included a double sauce. It was a kiwi sauce along with an eel sauce. I was a bit disappointed with the kiwi sauce because there wasn't really any flavor of kiwi. The mango sauce had such a pop of fruit flavor and this had none. The roll itself though was an excellent combination. I would probably get this roll again. 

Salmon Carpaccio - The salmon was incredibly fresh, but it was short lived because the minced garlic was way over-powering. 

Overall I would be happy to go back to this place. There is a lot to try, the staff is friendly, and they do have a quality product. There might be some issue with sauces, some okay but the others awesome. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot.",GQQieareg5cwIAHw7stigA,0,0,4,p4s9GneuMPhgmaSDBmuyQA

774576,2013-06-11,0,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"I have been here several times because I work near this sushi restaurant and they have 50% off rolls.  I ate here couple times before work because I was hungry.

The first time i tried this restaurant, I was with my sister to try their unlimited sashimi.  The fish were a little warm for sashimi, and very thick cuts!  I don't know about sushi or sashimi very well, but I know I don't like thick cuts... The fish change flavors in the mouth because I have to chew a little longer...  I would have preferred them if they slice it up a little thinner.  Also, colder fish would have been better too... I like feeling cold fish on my tongue.. not something room temp or whatnot.  FYI, I am not a sushi expert... these are all my opinions based on previous experiences with eating raw fish. So maybe they were served perfectly, I just didn't like them.

Their rolls are 50% off during certain hours.  I cannot remember when and which time slots.  I think during the weekdays...  I once ordered a rainbow roll (reg. $11) but paid half ($5.50).  If I can recall correctly, I think that day was Wednesday at 6pm. It was okay.  I only ate 4 rolls and the top part of the roll for the rest.  

I also ordered their small house hot sake once.  It is the worst sake I have ever had.  I can understand why they only charge $1.95 for it.  If you don't really care for the taste, then  go for it because it is definitely cheap and get you drunk if you drink enough of it.  However, I know I will never want to drink it again even if I really want to drink and that's the only alcoholic beverage available.  It is that bad.

I think I will go back there to eat cheaply before work if I am hungry... but I don't think I will go there with someone else to enjoy the food.  

Service-wise, the staff and sushi-men are attentive, nice and friendly.  But I wouldn't say it was the best service.  Decent.",ByU-4bg5ENiLgtEmkilicA,1,1,3,wMeSZv6fTFbitzPEon9DQg

Not too much rice in the rolls or the nigiri, and the fish tasted fresh! I even wanted to order seconds!

We got two orders of nigiri: tuna + yellowtail, it was really cause we were nervous about it not tasting fresh like last time we were here. And it was reaaal good, with only a tiny bit of rice and a big size of the fish. 

We saw a couple sitting next to us, they had ordered the unlimited sashimi and all of their orders looked real fresh- not to mention they were Japanese, eating this fresh sushi, so you know it had to be fresh ;) 

We also ordered three rolls, I was skeptical--BUT I checked (& even took a picture) of the rolls and how nicely they were made. This time around, they were made with precision. The rice wasn't too much and it was rolled perfectly. 

So tab came out to $19.73 all THAT for less than 20 bucks. Also happy because whenever I crave sushi, I don't have to drop 30 for AYCE. I can come in, get my fill & leave. :B

They put in so much bean sprout that it just became bean sprout ramen. Overall I would not come back because I feel like I don't really get the best bang for the buck.

unfortunately, i have little to nothing good to say.

first off, the ambiance is not pleasant.
sushi making is such a precise and delicate art that i feel that the restaurant that serves this type of delicacy should reflect that as well.
kaze's music selection is hard and loud so i picture the chefs making their sushi with hammers and mallets.
it was difficult for me to enjoy myself as i felt i was being attacked by their music selection.
this should typically not be something to mention at a restaurant but it was just THAT bad.

although they provide an ayce menu of sashimi at the sushi bar, i would dare not partake as the pieces of fish that i had were less than fresh and all had a very odd taste. 
they were also all cut improperly, with no precision nor consistency.

now for the sushi rice.
proper sushi rice can make or break a piece of sushi.
the rice here at kaze was undercooked, had no vinegar flavor, no umami.
each piece of sushi that i attempted to pick up simply fell apart because the rice was not sticky.
it also didn't help that each piece was drowned in some sort of sauce.
what i've learned from my sushi experiences is that a restaurant that drowns its fish in sauce, does not serve fresh fish as they are using the sauce to cover up the fishy flavor.

i won't be returning since there are plenty of other places that serve fresher, better quality items.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,9,2,2,LtyD3QJafFPA-3KLYSy61A

Monday, Wednesday and Friday are the days that Kaze receives their fish. So if you want the freshest of the fresh, I advise you to go then! I went on a Monday night. I ordered their albacore. So soft, so good! 

They have AYCE sashimi but this only applies at the bar. My party and I sat at a table and we tried our best to have the sashimi brought over to us for the AYCE price of $20. They wouldn't budge saying something about how the sushi chefs get confused with the sashimi orders if it's not at the bar. Keep in mind, however, Kaze does not have AYCE sushi. 

In celebration of their ""grand opening"", most of their nigiri and rolls are 50% off. Their nigiri quite good. Little rice, seasoned well. Nice cuts of fish. We got the salmon, tuna, seared albacore and yellowtail. All fresh and great quality. We also got the fatty tuna, which is not part of the 50% off deal. At $12 for 2 pieces, the fatty tuna was truly divine. Melted in my mouth. 

Their rolls don't disappoint, either. My favorites are the Sunkissed and the Garlic Crunch. We also ordered the Philadelphia and the deep fried California. My friend ordered the simple tako (octopus) roll and that was delicious as well. Perhaps the quality of their stuff elevates the taste!

For dessert, we ordered the green tea tempura ice cream (I posted a picture of this). They also offer vanilla tempura ice cream. The batter isn't too thick and the size of the dish is enough to share between 3 people. The 'ball' of the tempura ice cream is served on a plate of drizzled chocolate syrup.

I ordered a california roll (big portions + very well made), fatty tuna (very fresh!), large roll which consisted of shrimp, tamago, imitation crab and cucumber (HUGEE portion. surprisingly good even though it's something I usually won't order), ikura sushi (given free because the sushi chef made a mistake but it also was very fresh and vibrant orange), and salmon roll (i suggest putting in avocado instead of cucumber but the fish itself was very fresh).

The sushi chefs are both from SoCal and moved to Vegas for this restaurant. I don't know about you but I love just watching an expert doing their craft. They churned out rolls and sashimi slices flawlessly as they kept up conversation with their customers. 

My friends and I were very satisfied with our meal. This restaurant is worth venturing out of the strip for if you're looking to save some money while enjoying your food :)",OzgFpFtTo6WyPmGdx7q_Tg,1,1,5,pbN92caD_g7dqbu7JNZxmQ

I'm sure you all remember Lucky Fish and the few other owners this place was under.  With the high turnover I was skeptical, but last night I was so wonderfully surprised.  

Sashimi:  Thick cut, very fresh, fatty, the yellowtail pieces almost taste like Toro.
Nigiri: big cut with small amount of rice underneath, very fresh
Sushi:  Same thing!  tasty and very fresh!
Price:  50% off on most of the sushi items.  Sashimi plate, 2 rolls and 4 nigiri cost $45 (exclude tip)

I was tempted to keep this little gem a secret but the place was pretty empty on a Thursday night so I figured I'll spread the word to keep this place open!

Sat down and was never asked if i wanted anything to drink so I ordered a roll. So finally fed up I asked the sushi chef for some water.

My first roll was the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll it was mediocre at best the tuna was very mushy. Then orderd fried tofu which was ok, and also ordered the yellowtail which was ok, spicy tuna which again mushy and the california roll which was ok

waiter gave me the check while I was still eating didnt ask If i wanted anything else (not like I would of ordered anything else after all the dissapoinments) Had to ask for a water refill otherwise they would have dried me out! Left most of what I ordered at the table.

I was asked if everything was ok by 4 different people 8 times I dont know if thats good or bad! Didnt feel comfortable,felt rushed and I just wanted to leave.

So after all the dissapointments I had to cheer up somehow so I went across the street for a sure thing got some mango crepes which made my night!

My sister and I went on a sibling date to try this somewhat newly opened sushi restaurant. I had read and heard some mixed reviews but I figured I'd check it out for myself since... well, who can turn down 1/2 off on rolls and nigiri sushi?!

We first walked in and was greeted by a man who looked as though he was the owner or the manager. Either way, he was extremely friendly and super duper nice. It was extremely cold in the restaurant so if you get cold easily like me, you might want to bring a hefty jacket--good thing I brought a cardigan just in case.

The servers were definitely not as nice as the owner/manager but they were attentive enough, especially for a busy night like tonight so no complaints there. 

To be honest about the food, I'd give mixed reviews:

Yellow tail carpaccio- Oh my, the yellow tail was THICK and went well with the fried onions. It was a good mix of crunch and silky smooth fish. Yum!

Garlic calamari- This was fried well and there sure was more than enough for two people but it wasn't served with a sauce so I thought it was kinda lackluster. And I don't know if I'd include the ""garlic"" with its name since I didn't really get a noticeable garlic flavor.

Sunkissed roll- This roll was... alright. I don't really recall what was on it besides the mayo sauce because I remember dipping my garlic calamari in it. This roll was pretty bland and definitely not what I expected. 

Cinderella roll- This was my favorite roll of the night. It has yummy salmon and shrimp on top with some cream cheese in the middle. I usually don't like rolls with cream cheese because lots of places like to put LOTS of cream cheese for the relatively small size of the rolls but they really hit it on point. 

Snow White roll- I don't remember what type of fish it was but I remember it to be very yummy :) It is served with ponzu sauce which I don't really like because it's often too sour but I surprising enjoyed this roll more than I thought I would. 

Spicy Tuna roll- I don't know if I'd say that it was the best tasting spicy tuna roll but I must say that it was extremely tuna-centered and was covered by a thin layer of rice. 

This is where it gets good- nigiri sushi of yellow tail, salmon, and uni. I'D TOTALLY GO BACK JUST FOR THESE BABIES. The rice is in a tiny ball underneath a thick, mouthwatering slice of fish. I have never had nigiri like this, with a fabulous portion of fish and a small portion of rice so I don't have to fill my stomach with unnecessary ingredients. 

Overall, I'd definitely go back to have more of that delicious nigiri and perhaps to try the numerous other rolls they have to offer.",d3SolCjmhX6hEyy7IWP71w,0,0,4,dVoTWrph7hi1yGu6-dKkNw
4011969,2013-01-25,3,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"How did my bill come out to $60??  I thought I would be saving money!  I think they even felt bad because when I ordered an ice cream at the end they said it was on the house because it was a special day or promotion.  However I knew what I was doing and I purposely ran the price up there just so I could try their other items outside their unlimited sashimi special.

Located where the old Lucky Fish used to call home and next to such places as Cravin' Cajun, Cafe Moda, and Icy Juicy it's not hard to miss.  And as far as quality goes, they're really inconsistent.  The first day of their unlimited sashimi at the bar and I was there but I wasn't too happy with the quality so I started to throw out that I knew my shit.  Then a whole new menu opened up to me.  Then Senj became defensive with answers; ootoro, chutoro, where it came from, bluefin, big eye, albacore, Hawaii, Spain, fresh, grounded, how it comes in, if they prep it themselves, fillet themselves, etc.  

After it's been established I knew my stuff then it got better and everything else tasted better.  I ordered an extra Uni but nigiri and truth be told it tasted much fresher.  I ordered a pair of scallop nigiri and it was a good size and tasted great.  Wish he would have asked me how I wanted it but I asked for regular and seared, same went for toro.  

One of the big screen TV faces the sushi chef, the patrons eating at the sushi bar facing east has their back towards it.  No biggie but I bought enough beer, asahi draft, to test them and they charged me for individual beers rather than charge me for all you can drink beer.

There is no lack of motivation here though, they've taken insight from me on multiple visits and I'm sure from other customers as well.  From here on out I'll just come in and eat and not ask or make small talk.  I didn't use the Yelp check in deal, I never want any business to know I'm there with a Yelp review in mind.  Senj was awesome by the way, when I went to apply the tip on my check I asked Senj if he gets portion of the tips and he said no.  I put a $20 on the bar since there were no tip jars and $5 for the waitress.  Senj took care of me pretty much all night and I hope management let him keep it. 

A point deducted for sanitation reasons, the all you can eat sashimi was not served on new plates when I ordered more but I kept being asked to give him my wood sushi plate.  Don't like this method, cross contamination may occur when my possibly dirty plate keeps going back to the sushi counter over and over.  And when the chef handles my plate to receive and hand back to me?  I want clean hands to prepare my sushi please.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,13,5,3,WBx8WN3vz7kojqD7UWLdrA

4106857,2013-02-02,2,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"What an absolute revelation.

That description originally applied to just one tasty morsel, but I discovered multiple delights as I explored the special unlimited sashimi menu. I think the original wonder was one piece of uni, and it was easily the best I've ever had. Actually, the second piece was a little bit more of your run of the mill ""tastes like hot garbage"" sea urchin. Doesn't take away from the creamy savory first piece though.

The second revelation: holy mackerel! Really. The mackerel. It might be a little too fishy for some, and it definitely wasn't something I fancied too much at my favorite spot Goyemon, but the mackerel here was so juicy and bursting with flavor that it utterly shocked me. I was gonna offer extra pieces to my friends, but I decided to keep them all for my own tummy.

Not to be left out, the amaebi (sweet shrimp) was also the best that I've ever had. Great texture and flavor, not soft at all, and comes presented with the fried heads on the same plate. (Actually, the presentation in general was pretty solid with a mix of fish on julienne radish on each plate.) My next favorite was yellowtail (either best or second best hamachi I've had), followed by the second helping of salmon (didn't get much flavor on the first plate for whatever reason) and the octopus (great texture and flavored with lemon slices). I may be biased because I've never liked tuna, but the tuna was just okay for me.

Before I let you go, here's what you need to know: the unlimited sashimi is bar seating only (and there's also an unlimited drinks special, with sake and other goodies). Also, I believe it's only at lunch (11-2), and the owner mentioned that February may be the last month that they offer this special. But if they maintain the overall quality of today's fish, then I might just break from my AYCE ways once in a while.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,2,0,5,k_sHbSdU2FaXOAjYRAKr3g
4391494,2013-05-05,2,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"Had to ""roll"" out of here. 

I didn't feel like cooking tonight. Unfortunately, my roommate had dinner plans already, I wanted to pick a place where I didn't look completely pathetic eating alone (I just moved to Las Vegas, so I don't know anyone). I opt'ed for sushi, so I can eat at the bar, make small talk with the sushi chef, and feel somewhat like I have company. I decided to check out Kaze, because rumor has it they offered AYCE Sashimi. 

The parking to this shopping center is impossible. It shares the same lot as a couple karaoke joints, pool halls, and hookah lounge. There were 4-5 car vultures circling the lot trying to find a spot. Instead of joining the parking blood bath, I parked in the neighboring parking lot and walked over. 

The restaurant is new, cozy, with modern décor. I sat at the bar and ordered the sashimi AYCE special for 21.95. They offered a good variety of selection such as: Tuna, Salmon, Yellow Tail, Wahoo, Mackerel, Squid, Octopus, and seared albacore. I was surprised to see some premium stuff (although it's only 1 order per customer) like Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Halibut, and Red Snapper. Be warned, each order of fish comes with 5 pieces. I did not know, so I had to throw down 15 pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. I think on paper, AYCE sashimi sounds tasty, but in reality, after 25+ pieces of raw fish it starts making your stomach feel funny. I ended up ordering some ramen to balance things out. 

Overall, everything was pretty good. Some of the cuts of sashimi wasn't done very well, but the premium items were pretty good. The ramen noodles was delicious, but the broth was really bland. Service was prompt and the staff was friendly. The manager informed me on my way out that the AYCE sushi is going away after May 11th. Kind of a bummer. I think that's what would have kept me coming back. 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,1,2,3,RPtdw8Bu3QGC_SaocVWEkQ

So when I found out that the last day for AYCE sashimi ($21.95) was this past weekend I just knew I had to go! My girlfran and I try to do a sushi/sake catch up dinner at least once a month so I told her to meet me here! We went on a Friday night around 9:30 and it wasn't too busy. We were immediately greeted by the friendly sushi chefs and picked our spots at the bar.. The place is very clean looking but they were having plumbing issues so both restrooms were out of order the whole time haha  

We both got the AYCE sashimi and were pleasantly surprised at how fresh it all was! We tried the sake, maguro, uni, amaebi, ika, wahoo, hirame & Hamachi, seared albacore & snapper.. The stand out of the night was the amaebi (sweet shrimp) they didn't give us those skimpy small little things most places give.. They gave us fresh, plump, legit pieces of shrimp.. complete with the fried heads ;ppp Before I ordered I asked the chef to make the cuts thin for us and he definitely listened to my request! I don't know if we did the AYCD or if we just ordered bottle by bottle because we drank A LOT and the sushi chefs drank a lot with us too.. but the price for their large house hot sake is only $2.95! They even hooked it up with Sake Bombs & a baked salmon dish mmmmM the perks of being a woman haha 

I'm so sad that they have discontinued their AYCE sashimi special but I will still be going back for their fresh fish & AWESOMELY AMAZING service!!!

These were perfectly cooked and flavored.

Next we ordered salmon, yellowtail and tuna nigiri.  These didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.  Usually my favorite is salmon, and this time around, the only one I really liked was the tuna.  The yellowtail did not taste good and my friend wouldn't even eat his piece.

We also ordered the Tiger Roll.  This was decent, but I didn't like the eel sauce drizzled over it.  Next time, I would order it sans sauce.  Next up came the dynamite roll, which was just okay, and then the sweet shrimp sushi.  I had never had this before and thought I'd give it a try since my Asian friends love it so much.  I liked my sweet shrimp sushi, but my friend commented that it had too slimy of a texture for him.

I sat at the bar and wasn't feeling rolls and snacks, but the AYCE sashimi for $19.99 sounded good. Your choices include - salmon, tuna, seared albacore, yellowtail, mackerel, wahoo, squid, octopus and limit 1 order per person on uni, halibut, red snapper, and sweet shrimp. They also do AYCD for $15.99 on sakes and various beers, but I did not partake. 

I got a bowl of rice to add on and it came hot, I should have probably specified sushi rice so I let it sit until it got to room temperature. 

Salmon - I normally don't like salmon but this was so fresh and didn't have that gunky fatty flavor about salmon sushi that normally turns me off. 
Tuna - it was okay level of freshness, a bit irony 
Seared Albacore - I wasn't a fan, the sauce was kinda bland aside from being sweet when I prefer a bit tangy 
Yellowtail - acceptable level of freshness.
Mackerel - It's vinegary as I like... I don't like how salty it is in some places. 
Uni - was actually rather fresh and buttery
Halibut - Pretty decent.
Wahoo - I've actually never had wahoo before...it kinda reminds me of super white (sushi escolar kind) or like ono and was a bit smoky in flavor. Then I found out wahoo is ono which is what ""real"" super white tuna is. Confusing. Anyways, I rarely see this fish so kinda cool. 

My one thing about the fish here is the cuts on a lot of the fish were sloppy cut or felt like they were tail end scraps of cutting ala carte nigiri. The tuna was particularly badly cut. Some things were fine, and the salmon was neatly cut but also it's the easiest to do cleanly. After reading Kevin P.s review that once he showed he knew his stuff on sushi the quality got better and more carefully cut, it's kinda shitty to think about. Everyone should get a nice cut and service. 

The female servers were pretty friendly and filled my drink up fairly decently. Sushi service was friendly but was a bit hard to get. There were two people, but the one in front of me was doing prep and wasn't making eye contact and the other in the front of the U shaped bars was the one taking my orders. Since I wasn't in eye sight, sometimes it took a while for me to get noticed in between orders and when new parties came and got their initial orders, it set back waits. 

The idea of sashimi sounds good because no rice and such, but it got to be more one noted. At least in ayce sushi, you can break nigiri up with side dishes, rolls, etc. I think next time I'm here I'll try for a la carte or lunch specials instead.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,0,3,DJPHL_1WNYzrfEHBE-rc4w

Now, as you may or may not know, I am not a sushi addict. Even the slightest fishyness makes my stomach curl, so I generally don't go for a full sushi dinner or AYCE. Kaze is not a traditional AYCE. They do offer AYCE sashimi currently, but their primary model is something like buy 3 items, get 50% off additional sushi. However, there are some limitations.

Of the sushi I have sampled, most everything has been fresh. My recommendation is to ask your server what fish is the freshest. For example, last night they said salmon had come in that day, so we ordered the salmon carpaccio, and it was scrumptious.

So, for the non-sushi eaters, I have tried the chicken and salmon teriyaki. I was not a fan of the chicken teriyaki, as I felt the chicken quality was not the highest, a bit dry. However, the salmon teriyaki is a solid option. The piece of salmon is huge, and it tasted very fresh. It comes with a salad, miso soup and rice- all of which are great. 

Overall, we have visited 3-4 times, and while some things have been hit or miss, the one constant is the amazing service, and their commitment to provide the best experience possible. If something's not right, they will make it better.

They have some random fishes that I haven't seen elsewhere such as wahoo and striped bass.  I don't really eat rolls, so that part of the AYCE menu was overlooked by me.  The price is the same as all other AYCE.  While I still prefer Goyemon, what I don't prefer is the wait time and service there....so for attentive and quick service, I'd pick Kaze.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,1,0,4,z2d378vRyLrGkE89rZN4JQ

There's A LOT to like about Kaze Sushi!  Here's just a few things:  

- Doesn't seem like it gets very crowded often so seating is immediate
- 3 TV's to watch games while eating as opposed to Goyemon's lonely one behind the sushi bar
- A few unique offerings like chicken heart yakitori.  I really like chicken hearts a lot so I had multiple skewers and they were terrific.  
- They also steam their shumai, gyoza and other dumplings legitimately unlike others just nuking them or whatever the heck they do.

The service was very good.  Along with tending to unfilled drinks and empty plates expeditiously, they were also nice enough to change the channel for me since no one else was watching what was on.  

Some Japanese may not be down since it's Korean run but that doesn't bother me.  It would be nice if they stayed open later than 11pm but that's not a big deal.  All the fish I had was great and I will be back!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,8,3,4,Oub_2DDvKD8Z3szhpROjpA

I was skeptical at first because I tend to dislike rolls (too much rice, not enough fish) but the proportion of rice and fish was perfect. The rolls were also small and bite-sized which I liked as well. The second time I was there, they offered complementary salad or miso soup. I chose the salad and it was typical (but still yummy) of most Japanese eateries. Their fish is very fresh for a Vegas joint. The hot green tea is also free and delicious. 

Great service and definitely worth the price at this point. I have never been to a sushi place in Vegas with such nice and warm employees.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,1,0,5,O5j5EuBpiImG48W1HUxqfw
5688091,2013-04-14,11,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"So, my bff brought me Kaze sushi as a treat while I was at work.  She got spicy tuna, dynamite roll and the Helllo? Roll   .  Now Kaze is only a 10 min. Trip to where I work.  So first off we noticed they forgot the wasabi and pickled ginger. Well regardless of the elements they forgot I popped a spicy tuna piece in my mouth and I tAsted fishy salty insults upon the name Spicy tuna. It was horrible and the fish did not taste fresh by anymeans. So I think well who can mess up a dynamite roll? I look and some of the onions are charred black, the sauce is horrendous and when I ate it, it was even worse. It was super greasy, and the scallops were way over cooked and tough. The final roll the Hellol roll we really cannot remember the name however it is a california roll with spicy tuna on top and a sliced jalapeno on top.  The fried pieces on the bottom were so oily and greasy and not crunchy or edible. I was grossed out, it has to be some of the worse sushi known to mankind. Typically I stick to Nigiri but there is no way they make good Nigiri when they cannot make simple rolls.  I would not recommend any True Sushi eaters to eat here. Their 50% off is for a reason. If you like old smelly tuna and greasy rolls than this is the place for you. Otherwise BEWARE!",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,12,10,1,RB8OktjS1oOHffkkkRftYw
5789398,2013-07-02,1,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"THE BEST SUSHI PLACE IN VEGAS...

Where do I start.... Sushi chefs are excellent, service was awesome, and the owner Young is outstanding.

And the sushi.... wow. You can't get any fresher fish than here at Kaze. We went for AYCE and every piece of fish was superb. Kaze uses the best fish... I don't know how they are making business using the best quality fish while having low prices. The salmon literally melts in your mouth, tuna is high quality, ikura and uni.... the best ive ever had. The sunkissed and cinderella roll were both really good.. as well as appetizers fire cracker, kubota kimchi, poke tuna, and grilled calamari.

If you haven't checked out Kaze yet, I strongly recommend you to. Once you do, you won't be able to go back to the medium-grade sushi places that populate Vegas. The quality here at Kaze rivals the quality of fine dining sushi places, and in my opinion, tops it. Combined with low prices, it's no wonder I've been able to make Kaze my regular sushi place without hesitation.",eqlLRcgJts2N95imk-pJGg,4,1,5,i7l-JsJbmZg1LfxZcJlSeg

5918553,2012-12-14,6,bixMVkra8aJ1zcx026N8Bw,"Kaze Sushi, took over the sushi reign from Lucky Fish. And I am glad Bobby gave me a call to let me know about their soft opening, before I finished preparing dinner and eat at home.

The last minute decision to eat out was well worth it. Even if it meant that I have to eat ""leftovers"" tomorrow.  But fresh sushi prepared expertly and with care by a chef that is really knowledgable about his ingredients is always a treat.

Price is reasonable, especially with their promotion of 50% off on their entire Classic Sushi and Classic Rolls menu, when ordering at least 3 items. I think that requirement is easily accomplished for most people that go out for sushi.

Seared Scallops Sushi was my favorite, as searing it helps bring out its mild sweetness and flavor.

The salmon and Yellowtail Hamachi were very fresh.  The shrimp tempura in the Tiger Roll was fried to order, so it is still warm and tasty while surrounded by chilled fish and sushi rice.

This is definitely the place to go for a sushi snack, especially when you just want to have good sushi without the guilt of not stuffing your self silly to make that AYCE admission fee worthwhile.  

Also note this restaurant has just opened for 2 days of soft opening service, so the staff are still getting accustomed to working in the restaurant.  So be kind and patient if service is not yet up to par compared to an established restaurant.

Price/Value:  4.5/5  Definitely worth it with the half off selected portion of the sushi and rolls menu.  The rest is still competitively priced.

Taste: 4.5/5  Everything we ordered was fresh. But since it is only the 2nd day of soft opening service, the ingredients are also likely to be just 2 days old. 

Flavor:  4.5/5  Sushi and rolls are not over-sauced, so you can definitely taste the seafood.  That is a plus in my book.

Parking:  3/5  Clearly I don't hang out with the cool crowd. As I don't know where everyone is going to in the evening here, but the parking lot is always at 80%+ capacity.  During the day time, it is more like 15% capacity.  

Location:  West end of ""Chinatown"".  On Jones, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Rd. It is in the same plaza as China Mama, HK Star, and across the street from 168 Market.  

Rounding up for 5 stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,21,17,5,lCqoa19JaCvqfixwJ_6rNw
