My favorite item to order is the teriyaki burger which comes with white cheese. I've received it twice with American cheese and by the third time I just reminded them that it doesn't come with American cheese before they made it. That time they got it right but screwed up my boyfriend's burger. Ugh! Not to mention the terrible customer service. They are never apologetic when they mess up and every time I've gone through the drive thru the cashier hands me my bag, says nothing, and closes the small window. Umm? Very rude. Now I drive an extra 20 min to go to a different location.",cWaBb6Ngnflq2YsPrsn5jA,0,0,1,ioIXDZBlla2xJURtp8Notg
633262,2012-09-14,0,J_VOObYtNAsg8HQ5wViiPA,"Carl's Jr is may favorite fast food burger, it has a good grill flavor not like BK which to me taste like liquid smoke.  They have a hearty low carb burger that taste great and fills me up.
      They also have interesting featured burgers . The staff brings the food to you when dining in and clears your tray when your done , they always check to see if everything alright.",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,0,0,4,QnjDM7HwegnKo8ftSucEjA

The manager Angelina had no order and yelled at her employees making everyone feel very awkward. One woman waited 25 min for fries. The cook in the back dropped over a dozen buns on the floor and looked up to see who saw, Im sure if I didn't make eye contact she should of picked them up and used them! Horrible horrible never coming back.",Gh9gbUYXPYjcouyVQzV0IA,0,0,1,Q2SYvu1dTQ--BLJx1Qtc8Q
1330187,2016-10-03,0,J_VOObYtNAsg8HQ5wViiPA,"My and my little nephew went here on Thursday because I didn't feel like cooking.  We went through the drive thru because I was too lazy to walk in.  We ordered the western bacon cheeseburger combo, chicken tenders, and 2 orders of jalapeno poppers.  Everything came out to almost a whopping $25.00 sheesh but they have always been on the high end compared to others.

The lady that took my order was really nice and efficient.  It did take just a little longer to get our meal because they had to prepare the poppers and chicken tenders but we didn't mind as long as it was fresh.  And they got our order exactly right which I can truly appreciate.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,4,qohZKMwLV7H947k_3p6Zvw

It still is.  With all the choices in fast food burgers, Carl's is still one of the chains at the top of my list.  As a matter of fact, I think it sounds good for dinner tonight on my way to DeMolay.",Hd5h-uSjhGzSmH2GwFybXA,0,0,4,Ot9WXWzeBA5H9r9xQ4weTg
1891330,2017-11-28,0,J_VOObYtNAsg8HQ5wViiPA,"It's been 17 years since I had my favorite breakfast food at Hardee's (Carl's Jr.), so I decided to drive the 6 miles to get some.  I was living in Florida the last time I had it and I don't think the two companies had merged, yet. 

The menu item I'm writing about is their biscuit and gravy.  I ask for it to be fixed ""for here to go"" (meaning that the gravy is put on the biscuit in the to-go container, rather than it being served in a styrofoam bowl with a plastic lid -- you get more gravy with it prepared that way). 

I bought two of that item, plus an order of hash rounds. 

I got gone and was looking forward to the taste I'd been yearning for 17 years.  Wow.  Was I sorely disappointed in this ""food.""

The biscuits were burned/over cooked on the bottom, making it impossible to cut through with their supplied plastic fork. They (with the gravy) were microwaved to the point of steam burn, pretty much erasing any taste that I could expect. 

The hash rounds were cold and tasteless.  I only ate 3 and threw the rest away.  My dog wouldn't even eat one. 

I have to say that I'll never order biscuits and gravy again from Carl's Jr. (at least not at THAT location).",7jOJZi4ofZ2eplTPP0O6PQ,0,0,1,af1TOErNtV9xIthllhm63g
2150372,2018-04-30,0,J_VOObYtNAsg8HQ5wViiPA,"Went in through the drive thru order a Memphis burger single medium meal and then another Memphis burger but a double medium meal 

When I got home to eat before heading to work my fiance and I notice something weird about our food my burger was a western bacon burger and hers was just a pulled pork sandwich.

When I called the store to speak to a manager his attitude was like he didn't want to be bothered. I say this because when I made my complaint even after telling him I couldn't come back to the restaurant for a refund or a corrected order he told me to still come back. 

The only decent service we got was from Jodie. I have no idea why this guy has such a funky attitude but it's noted that he doesn't take pride in his customer/guest service.",Cv8NM0IzB1ySbJMm3EBsMA,0,0,1,x7FjbCty7TBt6224ZBaenw

Plain  boring order taker with no hat, messy hair and no name tag . After the order was taken we had gone to the table and sat but the table was filthy! There were like 5 tables not wiped down and floors not swept. I went over to ask the cashier for a sanitized towel and I saw the bucket on the counter. (Shouldn't it be on the floor?). Then she said to me ""ok I'll be right over"".I think she was the supervisor because she had a different shirt than the rest of them. I'm thinking she would be generous on giving me the towel because she was attending to another guest. I waited 5 more minutes for her to come by. Then she sends another person to wipe the table. Funny thing is that observing that there was more than one table that needed to be wiped she only wipes ours. LAZY!!!! They were not busy at all. Then they brought us our food and the fries were cold and the burger was awful!! The meat was hard and tasteless.My husband and I could hear the staff just messing around in the back. There was kid without a uniform just standing there looking over that small counter by the soda machine just smiling. After all my observation the lobby looked like crap. Staff, no sense of urgency to do a lobby check or sweep the whole time we were there. Fountain machine full of spills and the restroom with no soap to wash our hands with. Thinking to my self if there isn't any soap how would the staff was their hands after using the restroom??. Pretty gross!! As we left we saw the same kid with his uniform on this time but his uniform was so wrinkled. Did not look professional just looked really sloppy! 1. I didn't eat my food like I mean it. 2 the star lost its shine! This place really sucked and I will not be back! I give it a 1 star.  Who ever is the store manager of this store should really do some retraining or hire better people who is going to take their job seriously even when their bosses are not looking.",PH97jU2S-1hBqfvgugRBSg,0,0,1,R_x3ogd7bgP1AqHMXO63VA
4163809,2013-06-13,1,J_VOObYtNAsg8HQ5wViiPA,"So I don't typically eat at this particular fast food chain but since they have some promotional coupons at the moment I opted for the southwest turkey burger and the jalape単o turkey burger. The proportion is just right-I dislike eating a huge burger because it makes my self-esteem sad. Lol #bodyimagesabotage

Jalape単o burger: boy does this have kick! But I'm an idiot constantly thinking I can handle eating jalape単os when I know my taste buds can't handle it. Masochist dining. Fortunately I didn't suffer a runny nose. The lettuce didn't seem as fresh as the southwest burger.  

Southwest burger: it's a bit messy but I like this one better than the jalape単o one. Maybe it's because of the sauce or maybe it's because it's messy and I can imitate all the other A-List celebrity Carl's Jr commercials and lick my fingers and lips. 

Cross-cut fries: greasy like all true fast good fries. The initial bite is always good but the aftertaste-I no like! I hate that icky feeling of having grease on the roof of your mouth.",FBlKK57447Wt-EUR1TfENw,1,0,3,zP6tIbObcoRm5QUxoo0YJw
