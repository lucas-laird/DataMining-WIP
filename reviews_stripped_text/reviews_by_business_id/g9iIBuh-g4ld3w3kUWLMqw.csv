Understandable as they just opened.  As locals we were really looking forward to this restaurant providing another dining option downtown.  So we gave it a second try a few months later.

WORSE than the first time... !  Still the wine was not in stock and the beer we ordered was  not available.  Then waiting for the beer was painful  We could see the beautiful bar tender tending to everything except getting our beer as well as the beer for the adjacent table.  They ordered before we did.  The pizza quality was less than average.  I ordered a slice with peperoni and jalapeno.  The jalapeno looked as though it was thrown on the pizza as an afterthought.  It was not cooked into the pizza.

Then the exit, the wine that was not in stock had been charged to our bill, which required the manager to remove before we could pay with a credit card.  Wait, wait....wait.   No manager, no nothing...  Where does this manager hang out during lunch?  I offered to pay with cash and was told the manager still needed to remove the charge.  We gave them enough cash to cover the costs and left.

It seemed as a bother to the staff that we were there.  Too bad, we were really hoping for another eatery.  We will not be back!",F6t9_ITS3U6EziE8y8xDTw,0,0,1,Jrlq-uo1Y6TuIbsu8cP2YA

Ordered 3 beers and one coke. Got 2 beers and 1 coke. Asked about the other beer and got ""yes, it's on it's way"" as if the 3rd beer comes from a special place not near the other 2 beers. Ordered half pepperoni half sausage. Got half pepperoni half mushroom from a food runner. Said that was the wrong pizza. About 5 minutes later the waitress brought us the same wrong pizza. After another 20 or so minutes got the correct pizza. Never once asked if we wanted more drinks (there for over an hour), only saw the waitress to bring the pie and and check. The table behind us was ready to walk out after getting the wrong pizza 3 times, the manager came to their table and they stayed. Not sure if anything was offered to them. Manager never came to our table. I guess they are used to the wrong orders and that doesn't constitute a table visit.

178096,2013-06-12,0,g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw,"Hmmm, I am so torn...

If not for the pizza, this place would be a solid 4 stars. Usually, I'd only drop it down to three stars and say, ""stay away from the pizza,"" but, well, if you are a pizza joint, it just doesn't work that way.

The desserts here get 5 stars! I had a cannoli, it was perfect! The sweet ricotta was just the right level of sweet, the shell was firm, but not dry. One of my friends had a chocolate covered one and he said it was excellent as well. 

The sides are also very yummy. The garlic knots are well seasoned and melt in your mouth.

The setup is nice, with plenty of seating, including an outdoor patio and an indoor bar. The patio provides a view of Fremont. The bar has a decent selection of alcohol with a few more specialized liquors you won't necessarily find everywhere else.

The service is also good, with staff that is friendly and accommodating. even when the place is clearly slow and they're probably not making what they should be in the way of tips compared to other Fremont Street servers on a Friday night, they still stay cheery and aim to please.

But, the pizza. It's badly made and clearly with the wrong cheeses and wrong seasonings in the sauce. The pizza here tastes like the horribly over sweetened crap you get at dominos. Or used to get at dominos. I think even dominos has figured out how to make a better pizza at this point (not GOOD, mind you, just BETTER).

We ordered a white pizza and a regular one, so the problem was not one pizza alone. Everything was bad.

If you've already had dinner, it's a nice place to grab dessert and drinks on the patio. Just stay away from the pizza.",I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA,0,0,2,Q6k2GgJ4LKw_F_kKFzrBeQ
183325,2013-07-16,0,g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw,"As Vegas locals, we watched RCP fail at Tivoli in Summerlin and were disappointed when we had eaten there because the pizza was priced well above the average west coast slice and didn't seem to be worth it (even though we had high hopes that a Tivoli pizzeria would offer a up-scale option. When RCP moved downtown to East Fremont Street, we hoped they'd do well and decided to give them a try again. On our first visit with out-of-town friends at 11pm on a Saturday night, we waited 20-30 minutes for 4 slices of pizza, and after asking our server when the pizza slices would be ready, we were told that the ""kitchen missed receiving our order"".  We walked out as we were not willing to wait any longer for 4 slices of pizza.   My wife and I decided to give RCP yet another try a couple weeks ago, thinking maybe the service was slow/lacking on our previous visit as the East Fremont location had just opened at the time.  This second visit turned out to be no different than the first.  My wife and I sat at the bar, waiting for a server to come and take our drink and pizza order, while the restaurant was 50% full on a Friday night around 11pm.  Three servers/bartenders were huddled near the end of the bar, all laughing at something they were looking at on their cell phones, completely oblivious to the fact that we had sat down at the bar and were waiting for service.  After 5-10 minutes, we waved to the servers/bartender to try and get their attention, but were unsuccessful in doing so.  Once again, we walked out, and went across the street to Uncle Joe's pizza where we ordered drinks and slices of pizza and were seated and eating within 5 minutes.  I will not waste anymore time ever going to RCP again in the future, and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  We highly recommend going across the street to the real pizza parlor - Uncle Joe's if someone is looking for pizza in the downtown Fremont Street area!!

Our pizza showed up and it was quite mediocre. I've never had bad pepperoni pizza before but this one I had to force myself to eat. The mushrooms were not tasty either.

Made a reservation with the hostess got to the restaurant and reservation was never put in. Then we had to wait for 20 minutes for a table.

I told the waitress we rather pay then get the meal comped even though the whole place was horrible.

992620,2013-04-30,1,g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw,"Fremont East has a number of new eateries open recently. Le Thai, Comida and Park on Fremont are at the top of my list. Radio City Pizza had also piqued my interest so we grabbed dinner with friends Sunday night. When we walked inside, the bartender mentioned the A/C was broken, but we were welcome to take a seat. We asked if the beer was cold? ""Yes"" the bartender replied. That's all we needed to know. We figured we'd be in and out fairly quickly so the heat wouldn't be a bother (but we were wrong).
 
We were the only table seated, but service was slow from the start. It's a fairly long and narrow space with a long bar, open kitchen and tvs line the dining area. Oddly enough for a brand spanking new place the color isn't accurately adjusted on a single one. Anyhow, the beer selection is good. Unfortunately, the beers weren't nearly as cold as advertised and the quickly heated as a result of no A/C. After our first beer we chugged water to keep cool.
 
We started with parmesan fries, we devoured them before I thought to take a picture. They were real good, nice and crisp with a heavy dose of parmesan. We had to ask for the ranch  (weak) we ordered on the side a few times before we received it. Next, we ordered the Meat Stromboli and Pizza with sausage, mushrooms, olives  and green pepper. We waited forever for our order. There was filming taking place over by LVCS and the crew came in for a dozen pizzas. This must have backed up the kitchen. Our waiter never mentioned a thing, it's just our assumption based on observation. While waiting a couple in our group went to use the restroom, when they returned they noticed that Radio City has outside dining in back. We were a bit perturbed that it wasn't offered to us as an option when they mentioned the A/C was broke. We questioned our waiter and we were told that it was an owners private function. 

Back to the food, the stromboli and pizza looked appetizing. I was happy to see they use slices of italian sausage rather than sausage crumbles. The crumbles remind me of cafeteria food and weird me out a bit. I'll never understand why some places prefer it that way, but I digress. The crust was chewy and crisp about 3/4 through the pizza. It suffered the wet center that majority of NY Style pies do. Both the stromboli and pizza were extremely high in sodium. I couldn't get enough to drink. I retained enough water I could've soaked up Lake Mead. I've had worse pies, but just down the street at Pop Up Pizza inside Plaza they're doing a better job at a cheaper price. And they have A/C. Our friends picked up the tab, so I'm not sure what the final damage was, but if I recall accurately pizzas are $19, Stromboli is about ten bucks and the fries were $7. In any case, Radio City has some work to do. Starting with its customer service.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,3,0,2,tzPV1ZOnOILXw_GN23F0PA

I don't get it.) and the Mexican joint there was packed. Have three kids with me so I thought, can't go wrong with pizza. Only, yes, you can. Enter Radio City Pizza. 

Ordered the pizza special, two slices and a drink for $5. Good deal, I thought. And it is a good deal. Only, it isn't good pizza. Pizza came out really quickly, like within a minute so, it'd definitely been sitting around a while. At first sight, it reminded me of Costco pizza (and that's a good thing). Slices were both large, with the right amount of sauce and the right amount of cheese. But it really wasn't good. The cheese was congealed and the crust was hard. Not crispy or chewy. Just hard. My daughter actually said she wished we were at Pizza Hut. That bad.

I ordered the sausage and peppers appetizer but was told they were out of sausage. Ugh. So I looked at my other options and ordered the salmon salad. Oops, because they were out of salmon, too. Our server explained that by the end of the week, they're out of most things. It's Sunday, prime lunch time on Fremont St. Time to think about stocking up closer to the start of the weekend, rather than the end. Anyway, she suggested the apple salad with chicken added. Rather than going for a third strike and ordering something else from the menu which they were out of, I went with her suggestion. 

The salad is described as mixed greens, blue cheese crumbles, apple slices, whole walnuts, and cranberry-pomegranate dressing. What I got was a bed of mixed greens which were tossed in balsamic vinegar and a few slices of apples. Honestly, that was it. Not a single crumble of blue cheese, not a single walnut. And there is no way that dressing was anything other than balsamic and olive oil. It reminded of a salad you'd get at Carls Jr because you're trying to eat healthy. It was awful. And the added chicken was so, so, so bad. Chopped up tiny pieces of super dry chicken. Terrible.

Despite this place being really close to my office, I won't be back. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,4,0,1,d9z_lUPmSJe5R99XbeWKRQ

The service was good, but the kitchen was a bit slow -- not sure why with only two tables filled.

RCP is great for their affordable drink prices and single slices. It's not NY pizza (trust me, I'm from NY) but it is still very tasty none the less. Their gluten free pizzas, although on the pricy side, are very good. RCP is also great for their 2 cheese slices & a soda special which will only set you back $5!

Ciroq is the choice of drink for my wife when at RCP and at $5 a pop they're a steal! Think bud light bottles are only $3 but don't quote me.

Great place to have some drinks and watch the game or just kick it with their friendly staff at the bar.

They were ""out of beer and wine because of the holidays"" last time I went there, which just goes to show it's poorly managed. Because of the inconvenience of not having beer or wine they gave us ranch ""on the house"". A nice gesture... but do you really need to be charging for a 1 oz cup of ranch? During that same experience my friends and I ordered the fried macaroni balls -- they were still frozen in the middle.

Pizza is exactly what I wanted and needed and Radio City Pizza delivered, pun totally intended. The slices were big, pizza was thin, which I love. Great flavor, greasy but not to the point of where it was dripping all over the place. Cool thing was that there was 4 of us eating and they delivered an entire pizza plus 2 pieces. Considering it was almost 2am the service was great, our waitress was really nice. Not super attentive, but I wouldn't expect too much at that time of the night/morning. Great decor, a sports lovers paradise with a ton of TV's. Seems like it would be a great place to watch a few games on a Sunday.

At $12 it wasn't as crazy over-priced as some of the menu was and while it wasn't anything special (salmon, mixed greens, and Thousand Island on a bun), at least quality/freshness of the fish made it seem worthwhile (unfortunately the fries that came on side were definitely not - they seemed to be ""twice-fried"", sub-fast food quality - and for no obvious reason were served with a side marinara sauce & not ketchup...huh?). All of this wouldn't have been that offensive except the rest of the dining experience was rather uninviting: they were woefully understaffed even though they weren't very busy - the lone waitress was nice but beyond frazzled (we had to ask for utensils, which were pre-packaged plastic; then we never even got the napkins we asked for, having to grab them from the counter when we spotted some); the beers were all crazy ridiculously expensive (most of them were $10), so we opted to stick with water; and of course there were the obligatory amount of flat screens showing new/sports/etc and one was blaring so insanely loud that we couldn't hear each other and have a normal conversation (and neither could the waitress).

My husband picked up a few slices for dinner tonight and learned that the specialty slices (like the chicken pesto pizza I enjoyed so much last week) are no longer available- you can only get them as a full pie. We didn't want to wait so instead, I had two slices of cheese that were almost inedibly salty, with a tough, chewy crust.

We got the parmesan garlic chips again and they were absolutely horrible. It was seriously like eating crunchy pieces of deep-fried paper. They are no longer thick-cut and crispy-chewy... they are sliced paper-thin, so thin that they are transparent (not translucent, absolutely transparent). They taste like nothing. I see some cheese and herbs sprinkled in the bag but the chips retain no flavor whatsoever. It's a serious disappointment.

I don't know if this is just a fluke or if things will be like this from now on but next time I want pizza downtown, I will go elsewhere (maybe Pop-Up Pizza at the Plaza). Sigh. Another downtown disappointment.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,2,0,2,eq9qdQE__1GlMhzYzf3oow

We had the kids in tow, so we sat outside on the patio and opted for a traditional and a gourmet pie. Overall, I just plain didn't like the pizza. The traditional pepperoni/mushroom was super greasy, and I even like greasy pizza! For the specialty, we went with the pork pie or whatever the pork one is called, off the waitress' recommendation. I either didn't read the description closely or the ingredients were too gourmet for me to even know what they were. It came with a chorizo-y type of sausage on top, which I wasn't quite expecting, and which led to some serious grease. 
Service was friendly enough, but the patio is basically nonfunctional. The 3 tables were all super wobbly - like the bottoms and tops were both off kilter. Each table is so tiny, it can barely fit 2 plates and drinks, with the pizza up on one of their little stand thingys.

If this is the norm of service, I won't be back.  The pizza is ok but there's definitely other pizza joints on Fremont with much better service and much better pizza.  The beer was also overpriced.",KXCmtFEwKWuVh1Wm_f6kPg,0,0,1,XZUb4pXvAb1Dil_KUUAFfg

Are waitress was so incredible sweet (Mimi), very attentive & cheered up me & my partner after a bit of an upsetting event at another place. I would come back just for the great service alone.   

I had the veggie pizza on gluten free crust without cheese. One of my favourite things about this place was they don't charge to swap out toppings. I have a very restricting diet so this was great for me. They added extra sauce & jalape√±o & roasted garlic for no extra charge! The pizza was delicious! The sauce on it was amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly, the toppings were fresh. The pizza was a good size. My very hungry partner & I split this pizza. It was a good portion for the two of us! This pizza was $21. Normally I would think this was a little bit of a steep price but the quality of the pizza made it 100% worth it. 

The atmosphere was nice, they played kinda top 40 music, had oodles of T.Vs with sports one. It was very clean & organized. I liked it. 

I would say if you're in the area or feel like some really yummy pizza to check this place out. I hope I have time on this trip to go back!",hFy3pG3uBnWbzYk79nntVQ,0,1,5,wp4Y9c3Z8OUo_-_zybZ9BQ

We originally came here to watch the Women's FIFA final (one of my girlfriend's a soccer fanatic) and took a seat the bar. The bartender working greeted us right away and offered us water and menus. We asked if they would put on the soccer game for us and there was a male worker (possibly a server or the manager?) who tried to get the game on the TVs without any luck. After 5 minutes or so he let us know they were having technical difficulties and wouldn't be able to play the game and apologized. We thanked him for trying and headed out in search of another bar since my friend was determined to watch this game.

We were heading towards Fremont and just passed The Park when the guy working on the TVs came running after us to let us know they were able to get the game on! We were still debating on where to go and were indecisive so we happily went back to Radio City Pizzeria.

The bartender welcomed us back and we ordered some drinks. I stuck with the house white wine and my friends had beers and the house red. We ordered a build your own pizza which was GINORMOUS! The 19"" pizza was more than enough to feed the 4 of us. There were many toppings to choose from (although they ran out of mushrooms) and we all agreed on a small variety of meat and veggies. The taste of the pizza was slightly above average but when you see it come out freshly baked, you can't complain! 

The bartender was very attentive and ensured we always had a full alcoholic beverage and ice water in front of us. She was super sweet and engaged with us throughout the entire game. I didn't get her name but she had big, long wavy red hair. She definitely added to our pleasant experience at the pizzeria. 

Drinks were pretty average priced around $6-$10 per draft beer/glass of wine. If I was craving pizza downtown I'd still prefer Pizza Rock. 

I'd give this place 5 stars for their service and 3 for the food! I would give it an overall 3.5 if possible.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,4,3,3,fLRQepwVLcZ1vSw4gawiHg
4451885,2013-03-21,6,g9iIBuh-g4ld3w3kUWLMqw,"Pizza - GOOD!!!
Customer service - UGH.

My friend and I saw this place was opening up months ago and we were very excited to try it. We always happy hour downtown at Vanguard so we figured this would be a perfect place to grab a bite of pizza after drinking. We assumed they'd offer pizza by the slice because pretty much every pizza joint Downtown does.

Upon entering we noted a hostess stand outside, but no hostess, so we walked in. The space is SMALL. As soon as we walked in we were already in the pizza place. There is no area to stand around and not look like a fool if you don't know where you're going. Luckily a hostess (who would turn into our waitress arrived). She asked if it were for two and we said yes, she seated us in their restaurant section which is basically right next to their bar section.   As for decor, it's nicely set up, except for the fact that there is an overload of televisions. And every single one of them was on basketball. My friend and I came to the conclusion that their space over at Tivoli Village must have been bigger and they just weren't willing to give up all those flat screens, so hey, just put 'em everywhere. Seriously guys, lose some of the TVs. Your customers will not miss them.

The night we were there they were offering a limited menu and they were upfront about it, which was nice. At least we didn't go through their full menu and decide on something they did not have. BUT we were disappointed to see the menu offered no option for just ordering by the slice. We got over it and decided to order an 18"" Viva Las Vegas which had pepperoni, a meat I can't remember right now, onions, yellow peppers and white sauce. All of their specialty pizzas sound really good and I would like to go back and try more. Sometimes places do specialty pizzas and you're like WTF? No. But RCP has really good-sounding concoctions.

Our pizza comes out and it looks delicious and smells delicious. We dig right in. First off the crust (for me) was perfect, crunchy, but had that nice chewy texture you get with good NY style pizza. The toppings were salty and sweet and just made this wonderful little pizza-goodness opera in my mouth.

Then comes the downfall of our whole experience.... 

We noted the pizza had not been cut completely. There were slices that actually should have been two slices and not one. I picked one up and it was bigger than my face, so naturally, we just asked if we could have the pizza cut. Our waitress then laid a lovely little explanation/insult on us.

""Well, this is not Dominos or Pizza Hut, it's NY style pizza so it's bigger than you're used to.""

EXCUSE ME? My friend and I were aghast as our haughty little waitress took our pizza away to be cut ""Dominos-style"" to our peasant liking (apparently). Instead of just cutting our pizza she insults us. Nice touch.

And you know what? I like Dominos AND Pizza Hut so there. Oh and by the way - if there's one food I know pretty much everything about - it's PIZZA! And I certainly know what a NY style slice of pizza looks like. Okay? Pizza is (langauge) fucking pizza, all right? So just cut my fucking pizza.

I want to go back to try more, but obviously my Dominos-ass should stay home and order pizza to be delivered.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,3,2,eN7tm_SKnXcHCS3ZpCmLOw

I'm vegan, so both times I've ordered the calzone with Daiya cheese. The first time I visited RCP they got the order right with no problems and it was delicious. When I went yesterday, I again asked for the calzone with vegan cheese. When the order came out I discovered that the cook had used Daiya as well as Ricotta *and* Parmesan on top! I'm vegan for ethical reasons, but if I had been someone with a dairy allergy this would have been dangerous.

I spoke to the manager, who first blamed me for not clarifying that I didn't want the cow cheeses, though I think that's obvious from the fact that I asked for the *vegan* cheese. Then he blamed the poor waitress, who was new and just doing her best.

Facility:  This is a dark modern place, that has a rocky roll kinda feel. All the other patrons were dressed in black...not sure if that was s coincidence or not. They have about 12 TVs showing various movies and sporting events. Music is a mix and not too loud to have a good conversation. 

Service:  we got a cool waiter who was friendly, informative and easy on the eyes. 

Food:  we ordered the cheese sticks to share and they were good.  They were homemade and came with a small portion of fries too. 
Then we got two pizzas to share. The white pizza with mushrooms and the green pizza with eggplant. 
The white pizza was my fav of the two, but could have used something like chopped tomatoes or black olives to cut the richness of the cheese. 
The green pizza had a pesto sauce that was good, but the eggplant was flavorless. 
I also tried two beers. One was the Troublesome Gose, which was a good one. 
The other was the Bockor Vanderghinst. This one I really enjoyed.  It was a cross between grapefruit beer and a stout, but lighter.

When you walk into the place, you're pleasantly surprise by the clean lines of the restaurant.  Nice floors, separate bar area and dining area and the fact that there are many TVs in the establishments.  We were super excited to try the food!  Our servers were super nice as well.  I remember a tall guy with tattoos named Chase.  He was more the servers assistant but super cool.  Our server, with glasses and a fauxhawk, was super accommodating.  He was attentive and really kept coming back and checking on us.  

You're probably wondering why I gave the amount of stars.  It's because of the food.  We started off with a few appetizers:  garlic fries, garlic chips and wings.  The garlic fries and chips were flavorful, I'll give you that.  The problem was that it was DRENCHED in oil.  I could feel a new pimple pop out with every bite.  Definitely not something I would recommend.  If there was one that was better, it would be the fries because it seemed like less oil.  The wings were packed with flavor and wasn't hot, which is a good thing, but a little soggy and not crispy how I prefer wings.  Then there was the pizza.  We got the meat lovers which I was excited for.  The toppings were top notch.  You can tell they use great ingredients in this pizza.  The problem was the crust.  It didn't WOW me and almost seemed like it was a frozen crust rather than homemade.  Here's the plus:  The ranch!  I don't consider myself to have a super advanced palate, however, I know my taste buds love it.  The ranch along really saved a lot of the dishes for me.

Given the interior, staff and of course ranch, I didn't feel like they deserved a lower score, however, they need to focus on less greasier food.  I think it'll do well regardless because of the location, especially after a night full of drinking.  If you're looking for a sit down dinner, I wouldn't necessarily consider this place.

Second chance, we called in an order to go. Just a large pepperoni pizza, nothing too difficult. The girl on the phone sounded super confused like she didn't know what was going on and my husband even commented that he was worried we'd get there and there would be a problem with the order.

Everything on the menu is confusing and it's like it's in stereo. My wife and are locals and we frequent the downtown/Fremont Street area often. We hadn't had a chance to eat at RCP yet so we gave it a shot there while we were waiting for some friends to arrive in the area this past weekend. WOW were we disappointed. 

We walked in the restaurant at 1PM on a Saturday and the place was completely empty. We were politely told to seat ourselves and we did. The waitress hurried over and asked if we wanted anything to drink. This is where the frustrations started. My wife asked for an iced tea and was told they don't serve it there. WTF? What kind of restaurant doesn't serve iced tea???? She said water would be fine. I was lured by the special on the chalkboard outside which was 2 slices of pizza and a beer for $7.99. I asked if I could substitute a cider for the beer and was told that the beer choices were only bud or bud lite...so, basically, swill and lite swill. I said I would like a Sam Adams instead and was told they were out of that and three other beers. Oooookay. I just asked for a diet coke and left it at that. She leaves to get our drinks and comes back. The waters were in cheap plastic cups but the diet soda was in a glass. Very odd.

So we order. We decided to split their Italian Sausage platter as an appetizer and for an entree my wife orders a slice of the Chicken Pesto pizza and I decide to go for the cheaper special and get two slices of pizza and a soda for $5. I ordered a Supreme and Pepperoni slice. Nope...can't do that either. It has to be cheese to qualify for the special. ""Screw it, just bring me one slice of Supreme then!"" I said. A few refills on our drinks and then, when I thought our appetizer was coming out, here arrives our pizza. ""The cook said the sausage takes a bit longer so I'll bring that out when it's done, OK?""  Fine. We look, and both our pizza slices were on cheap paper plates. Very low class. We also notice that my wife's Chicken Pesto pizza was actually just a slice of cheese so the order was taken or made wrong. At this point, she just didn't care to say anything so she ate it. Both pizzas were OK but certainly nothing spectacular. If you told me it came from Dominos I wouldn't have been shocked. Five minutes later the sausages came out. On paper plates? Nope, this was served in a dish. Like I said, it's as if two people run the place and neither of them talk. The sausage platter looked nice but was extremely bland even though it was smothered in onions and peppers. Truly, it was made by someone with no tastebuds. 

We got our check and at least the waitress rang us up for a 2-slice and soda special but the order was wrong anyway so I'm not sure what to say there. The more we looked at the menu and specials though, the more we got confused. it's the only pizza place I've ever been to where a slice of cheese pizza is $3.50 but if you add pepperoni to it, it's only $3.00. So if you eat there, it's actually cheaper to order a pepperoni pizza and pick off the pepperoni if you only want cheese. Stupid. We left as soon as we could and would not go back until they get new recipes and someone who actually knows a little bit about how to run a menu.",W3fshc9xGnrYuA1QwF4sLw,0,0,2,DqbOjTwzOCEVwq_P5cGB4w

Service was super quick, polite, and knowledgeable.
I asked our server what he recommended, and he made a comment about the chorizo.

I ordered one slice with chorizo, olives, and mushrooms. 
Excellent choice. 

The toppings were great, and the pizza was really good, but I loved the crust the most!  Crispy, but not burnt, nice and thin, it was the perfect texture for a thin pizza. 

Fella thoroughly enjoyed his pizza as well. 

 $10.27 for 2 slices of pizza with 3 and 4 toppings each isn't bad.  I was shocked when I first saw it, but then I reminded myself that I AM downtown, after all, and things are a little pricey here.

Once we seen Radio City Pizzeria's by-the-slice window, we were sold. The pizza here starts at $4 per slice and is $0.50 extra for toppings. Fountain drinks were $3. Ordering was easy enough, but surprisingly enough they didn't have slices on hand. We waited about 10 minutes, and those pizza slices were literally fresh out of the oven.

While we were sitting out in the patio area waiting for our slices, we witnessed a verbal argument by two homeless males fighting over territory. Another toothless guy interrupted my husband mid-bite to ask him about his t-shirt (a Cannibal Corpse shirt may provoke some questions). You might want to eat inside and avoid the patio, just saying. 

The pizzas were pretty mediocre. There was something about them that was off. Plus, it irked me that our small meal cost $17! One more thing - the fountain drink cups are small. They only have one size, and I'm not sure if they give refills. At least the staff are friendly! The guy working at the window brought the pizzas to our table and gave us Parmesan cheese and red pepper shakes.      

Worth a Return Visit?
IMO, Pizza Rock Slices are waaay better. Radio City is convenient when you're in the area though. I'd probably come back if I was in a rush.

I am perplexed by how restaurants perpetually run out of products. It seemed like half the items we wanted were out that day.  The limited items that were available were decent.  

The Chili cheese fries were a hit and miss.  The fries are crispy. The Chili was good. The cheese was not the artificial sauce. It was half a slice of Kraft singles torn on top without being melted. 

The Caesar and caprese salads are nothing special. u don't really expect pizza places to serve a mean green option. One of these days maybe one will surprise me. 

The pizzas themselves had a good chewiness without being too doughy.  They are thinner yet not cracker like. Each 18 inch pie is cut into eight slices. I could only eat one slice after all the starters. The meat lovers was the first to go. The Supreme was more my style. If only they had the Mac'n Cheese pizza.  A fat kids dream. 

The Philly was okay.  Nothing special. 

The beers look overpriced. Once you see that they serve 22.5 ounce bottles instead of the normal 12, it makes sense.

She handed us our menus and she said that they just opened recently so they only have a limited menu. We were fine with that.

UGH!!!

At this point, I did not want to wait the five minutes. There was no guarantee that it would only take five minutes, what if it took 10 minutes? So, I asked her to cancel the whole order.

""Radicchio"" kicked off our meal with shaved root vegetables, herbs, and vinaigrette.  The plate wowed in its mix of color, delightful crunch of garden greens, and a bitter, acidic finish that I found surprisingly refreshing.  I could see how the bitterness could be off putting for some though.  This pummeled any lame lettuce, tomato, salad with dressing from a jar that the average pizzeria pushes out.

""Coniglio con Conchiglie"", basically a rich kid's mac and cheese, is filled with braised rabbit, sugo di formmagi, shell pasta, zucchini and coriander.  It's what initially piqued my interest to check out RCP again, and it'll be the dish that will have me coming back.  I resisted the urge to mix everything together to get more rabbit flavor, but that ended in mere minutes since the cheese sauce was so damn good.  I'd brush my teeth with that shit.

The calamari was also delicious.  The tender rings of saut√©ed squid with herbed parsnip puree, eggplant and crispy shallots went marvelously together.

I love me some sports.. especially basketball. They have nice big TVs all over the restaurant and a giant one over the bar. That's where I usually am.

When it comes to the pizza I am a HUUUUGGEE fan of the BBQ Chicken. Probably the best Ive ever had. The white is amazing too. Touching back on the ""convo with Lance"" comment, I asked for BBQ Chicken one night and he brought us Buffalo Chicken instead. I'm not a big fan of spicy, but guess what.... STILL AMAZING.

The owners are usually on site which is great. I was getting hassled and hit on once by a guy that was SUPER wasted drunk and Elias quietly had him and his comrades booted from the joint. No riffraff allowed here. Then we were given shots on the house and most of our bill was taken care of. I think we paid for maybe two slices out of our feast.
