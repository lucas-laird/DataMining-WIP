I swear I ordered the same salad this year (chicken avocado) and it was horrible while last year it was delicious.  I am not sure what happened but I was disappointed on my most recent visit.  The salad was just bland, the chicken flavorless, the toppings weak and the dressing watery.  The avocado, however, was very good.  I found the staff to be friendly and I like that all the drinks are served in plastic cups so you can take them with you.  In the future, I might return here but only for drinks and not for food.",tIP5tmJzK2jFKJh6lE-_Ag,1,0,2,xqX9kMtOAA1S0gYBS0k_Eg

Alright, other than the free WiFi courtesy of the McCarran Airport, this place is pretty lousy, except maybe for breakfast, which I couldn't taste at this time because they stop serving it at 10:30 (except for cheese omelette). The tables are puny small, the waiters are slow and I saw one person leave after being annoyed at how much they had been waiting, there are only 3 non-alcoholic drinks and all are sodas (Sprite, Diet Coke and some other stuff - no prices on the menu for these, BTW), and the menu is very limited. No ""lunch"" entree per se, only soup, sandwiches and salads. Still, the Southwestern Avocado Chicken Salad was good, and probably you're better off here than at Quiznos down the D gates.
