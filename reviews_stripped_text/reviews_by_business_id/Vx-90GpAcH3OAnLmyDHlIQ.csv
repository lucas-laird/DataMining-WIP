Interestingly enough, I'm not even a big fan of BBQ.  What's made me go more than once already then?  The people.  I remember them, and somehow they remembered me.

Yet let me tell you, this BBQ is nothing to scoff at either.  One can tell the ribs have had all that tender loving care to make them so... well tender.  The meat falls off the bone, but I had a hard time not gnawing at the bone either -- so I might have, just a little bit anyway.  The smoke ring was quite evident both visually and in flavor.  I'm more of a dry rub person (e.g. Memphis BBQ), so I tend to find sauces too sweet and lacking purpose.  Here was no different.

Second time around I was feeling cheap, so I ordered their pulled pork sandwich.  What in the world was I thinking? I don't even like pulled pork all that much.  Oh yeah, because it was cheap.  Well behold: the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.  They made a believer out of me.  Quality pork that for once wasn't swimming in sauce.  What really sent it over the top was the cole slaw on top.  It melded perfectly in flavor, and added a harmonious textural contrast.  The sucker wasn't small either; always a plus.

Now I'm going to take a moment to talk just about the establishment because it is so worthy.  One: it just smells as good as it should.  Two: the decor reflects the vibe poured into their service.  Three: the music is spot on.  Four: not only does the chef have skill not to be trifled with, but we share a similar haircut (he gets this).  Five: the ladies up front are darlings with every bit of southern hospitality right down to their accents.  I nearly missed out on this because my first attempt their were closed that day.  Luckily something drew me to try again (which is actually quite strange for me)... and then again for good measure.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,2,1,4,EdYKpABDFFLzpiZ6CBz7Hg
532814,2012-01-11,0,Vx-90GpAcH3OAnLmyDHlIQ,"I just absolutely love when I come across a place that surprises me like this one. When you first walk in there a few picnic tables and some benches with tables to sit on, but only a few. That's because Hogs Heaven's claim to fame is their delivery. But the place was packed anyway. The menu is a simple one that most Barbeque enthusiasts will love. Ribs, pulled pork and sides. A lot of people will tell you the only true Barbeque is Pork Shoulder. A finely cooked Pork Shoulder will make the best pulled pork sandwiches. Hogs Heaven has that as one of their signature dishes. I do have to say that I cannot tell you about the Pulled Pork this time. I did not try them, but there were a lot of happy customers eating them. I had to go for my favorite BBQ item as it was my first time at Hogs Heaven. My wife and I shared a full rack of Baby Back Ribs. (We had leftovers) I have to say that these ribs are in my top few of the best ribs I have ever eaten. When you grabbed onto them with your teeth they just came off the bone. They were so tender, juicy and succulent, and their Barbeque sauce was so tasty. Their Barbeque sauce is a vinegar based Barbeque sauce. I have found few of those in my lifetime that I have enjoyed. But, the vinegar taste was so understated that it just enhanced the flavors of the other ingredients and the ribs. Hogs Heaven has won me over to vinegar based Barbeque sauces.

As our sides of choice this time, my wife and I choose their BBQ Skillet Beans and a Corn on the Cob. The corn was fully cooked but still had a very nice crunch to it. The flavor of the corn was not overpowering at all. It just tasted like a good corn should. It was also very juicy. The beans were a big surprise. They looked like a regular serving of BBQ beans, but the flavor was indescribable. These were the best beans I have ever had. There was a little smokiness to them, but just a hint. It caught me off guard to see red Bell Peppers in the beans but they were a great addition with good flavor from the sauce. When I go back I will be sure to include the BBQ Skillet Beans every time. Their side dishes also include Potato Salad, Mac & Cheese, Coleslaw, Fried Okra, and Collard Greens. They also have Hog Fries to go with your meal. The menu also includes Buffalo and BBQ wings as well as a Mini Pulled Pork Sandwich, Mini BBQ Corn Dogs, and Animal Chic Fingers for the kids.

For dessert my wife and I shared a Peach Cobbler. I usually am not one for Peach Cobbler. But I enjoyed this one very much. The flavor of the peaches was subtle and combined well with the other ingredients. The crisp portion was a bit doughy and tasted more like a donut to me. My wife did not care for it that much, but I enjoyed it.

As I said, the place is small. But it is very cute. I enjoyed the ambiance. The staff are very friendly. They were by our table several times to make sure everything was OK. When we were ready to go they brought us a to-go container for our leftovers without our even having to ask. I asked about their delivery area and I was told that if you buy a minimum of $40.00 worth of food they will deliver anywhere in Las Vegas for only a $2.50 delivery fee. That is just two full racks of ribs if you are feeding four people.

I can tell you that I will be going back to Hogs Heaven again and again.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,0,0,4,VHfMl0IWPsdNl6OOt56_kA

BBQ is awesome, not smothered in sauce,just the right touch, falling off the bone delicious, side dishes, had friends with me so we shared many of the homemade side dishes are cooked to order-just a little wait time, but worth it, fried okra, collard greens fresh, nicely seasoned, baked beans delicious, mac and cheese was good, french fries with hog dippin sauce-yummie, honey corn bread muffins!, Pulled pork scrumptous, even the hot wings and hot link sandwich are finger lickin' delicious.  Peach cobbler absolutely delicious, his sister Sha-Sha makes homemade peach cobbler and sweet potatoe pie every morning - better get there early as they are all sold out at the end of the day.

Sigh...

Not what I expected.

OK, their customer service is top-notch.  Very nice people and a very clean place to eat bbq.

Also, their ribs are tender.  Nice and smokey.

Here's the problem: the bbq sauce.  I'm saucey!  I need mollasses-based bbq sauce.  Hogs Heaven uses tomato-based bbq sauce.  Worse, there is no choice in sauces.  Even more awful: you can't get extra bbq sauce.

You're stuck with the one sauce that they provide on the ribs.  So, if you like their 1 bbq sauce, then this place will rock your world!  If not, then you are going to leave hungry.

To be fair, their collard greens are a fantastic side dish.",qCZu-TpQ-VqhjK9BUtqtkQ,4,0,2,BAdnU1Dc5mXdGDTK7wFo6g

My father's pulled pork sandwich looked great with homade cole slaw on it (the right way).  Although I didn't try the sandwich he said it was one of the best he's ever had!

1272005,2010-07-27,2,Vx-90GpAcH3OAnLmyDHlIQ,"How lucky I was to miraculously find Hog's Heaven BBQ when in all actuality I was driving to a BBQ competitor close to my house Shanes rib shack.  Long story short one of the owners of Shanes passed away so they sold it to Hog's Heaven.  I used to love Hog's Heaven at their old location in Aliante but their spot was hidden and wasn't garnering enough business to stay open.  Sad day when  it closed, euphoria when I stumbled upon their new location.  Like the old location, the new kitchen is staffed with the same masters of mesquite and likewise the same jazz and blues music from their old location comes bellowing out of this kitchen.  You can sit down to eat or grab and go.  The service is remarkably professional for counter ordering and the restaurant is clean.  Ribs are a must get-amazing flavor ask for extra sauce.  Pulled pork sandwich is good but the ribs are the star of this show.  Sides are hit and miss, it's almost worth while to save room for MORE ribs.  Tried the cornbread but it's not homemade and I love fried okra but like the cornbread they were not homemade.  There's only so many hours in the day and the folks at hog's heaven spend it wisely on their ribs.  When these folks have a firmer grasp of the needs of their new location I would love to see them make more of their items in house.  Maybe I should be happy they don't though or else I would have BBQ pulsing thru my veins and be one fat pig.  For the time being though, I am back in Hog's Heaven !",6meoscPs8Jxly6Jz7f_aYg,2,2,4,jCpEoxC9CJBanKTz3epVhQ

Thanks to my ever so lovely and tasteful girlfriend, I've had the pleasure of partaking of such delicious southern style grubbage! I should warn you that eating here more often will cause addiction and once addiction sets in, you will experience bad withdrawals from the overflowing BBQ sauce!

The homestyle greetings from the front cashier, Marsha, already take you out of Las Vegas and into the flavorful and intriguing customs of the South! The walls are covered with components and shout-outs to Hog's Heaven for their return to the mountain side of Centennial Las Vegas. I called in the order one night and spoke extensively to Marsha about what I felt like sinking my teeth into and she suggested the full rack of ribs. I was a little apprehensive on $19.95 for a rack of ribs (12 bones) but the half rack was just a few dollars cheaper and I thought, ""If we don't finish it, I'll eat it tomorrow anyway!"" Can't have ribs with no sides so I went with Mac n Cheese! My girlfriend and I love their hot link sandwich so we decided to half that as our other side (hey! when we grub, we grub!) and she said their fries were pretty good so we got that with a side of hog sauce (YUM!). My girlfriend remembered that there was a discount for yelpers for 10% off so we smiled even bigger. We phoned in our order so we told them to start cooking 15 minutes after we hung up. Marsha asked about dessert but I politely declined because we had our own waiting. Marsha joked she wanted some of our homemade pumpkin gooey cake but we were serious about sharing :)

When we picked the food up, we were kind of sad Marsha was out on a delivery because we wanted to share our cake with her. We also asked the cashier (forgot her name!) if Marsha included the 10% off and she said she wasn't sure and told us to wait for her to do that. That almost threw the positive experience out the door but when Marsha came back, her winning attitude and Southern hospitality totally kicked it back into positive! Not only did she give 10% off, she gave a little bit more for the wait. I hope she enjoys that cake cuz it is SO GOOD! We destroyed half the rack (saved the rest)! Enjoyed the hot link sandwich as always and discovered a new sauce I like: Hog Sauce.

I will not only return here, but I will return with an appetite for the rest of their menu! Thanks again, Marsha!",bTTZzC8RvTxTOeGMvJ5icQ,8,7,4,v22B3dNnnRFYo3qK7MLDxw
2284836,2010-07-21,0,Vx-90GpAcH3OAnLmyDHlIQ,"Was there today for an early dinner with 2 friends. I thought it was a sit down and order place, but actually you just order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. As I have read in a review of it, the menu is quite limited, but that just means they are good at what they do right? Basically they have ribs, wings, pulled pork sandwich and hot links.

We tried the ribs, bbq wings and pulled pork sandwich. All the meat was GREAT! Quite a surprise. The ribs were falling off the bones. The pulled pork is A-May-Zing. The wings were flavorful! The wings came with steak fries and hogs sauce which was yummy. Also ordered muffins and mac n cheese on the side. Muffin was good, though I prefer famous dave's corn bread over it, yummy still. The mac n cheese is made differently, perhaps with ricotta cheese. We all loved it.. Couldn't save room for dessert, but I will definitely go back. Oh yeah, and they have mango tea, peach tea, and sweet tea. Mango tea didn't have much flavor but loved the peach tea! It really tastes like peaches.

Me and my friends are fans of BBQ, so this may become our neighborhood bbq joint. And one other thing, they deliver! How awesome. Only thing is, the food all comes in boxes (good for leftovers to take home right away) but food gets cold quick. It seems to be all premade and food came out quickly.

3068265,2012-03-09,0,Vx-90GpAcH3OAnLmyDHlIQ,"Having moved from a Midwest town - the thought of having BBQ ribs was making my mouth water. And when you are hungry, and passing this place, the smell is just awesome!! 

Sadly that's about as positive as I can be. 

We were on our way home and made a pit stop here to do a quick grab and go. First bad sign: 4 paying customers ahead of my hubby, and it takes about half an hour just to put an order in, on top of waiting for the food itself. Ok ce la vi - I can get over that issue - normally. 

Here's what we had:
     e)Rack of Ribs
     a) Fries
     d) BBQ Beans
     b) Mac 'n' Cheese
     c) corn bread

My critique on all of this: 

a) Fries were actually the best part of the meal! Pretty sad when a potato outranks the rib in my eye! 

b) Mac 'n' Cheese - pretty tasty for someone who prefers theirs kicked up a notch. They dump a bit of mustard into it, along with finely chopped onions, so you get quite an aftertaste. Not the most pleasant if you are craving just the usual creamy ooey gooey cheesyness. Less cheese flavor in this place.

c) Corn bread - light and fluffy - but tasted more like it was made from a box. Most BBQ joints really give you a hunk of really good tick homemade stuff; where you can really catch those cornmeal bits in your teeth.

d) Never in my life, have I been served COLD BBQ BEANS at ANY BBQ joint!!! Hubby dumped some on his plate, bit into it and promptly spit it back out on his plate. I proceeded to test the beans from the container - stone cold. NOT COOL! Not much BBQ flavor in them either. Seemed to be pretty watered down on the flavor - most BBQ beans have SOME form of caramelized flavor, but wasn't really picking up on it. I had a hint of the smoke taste, but sure does need some doctoring up.

e) One reviewer pinned it on the nail head stating that for all the good serious smoke flavors pouring onto the street - you could hardly pick up on ANY of that in the meat. We do a lot of BBQ Smoking ourselves, and we'll have a nice pink layer of smoky goodiness on our pork;  but this place - no pink at all! The meat is SUPER tender, and does have the tendency of falling off the bone so readily yet appears to be a bit more fatty that what I am used to elsewhere.

The wet mop used ON the ribs - is VERY good, and has a LOT of good smokey flavor. I prefer having a variety of sauces to try with my meat.

The Midwest spoiled me, since i know what excellent BBQ tastes and smells like.",iUds9-iyxd4PFW0jMh15TA,1,0,2,ILn07QxKL8StDh0mI6YDXw

Then several weeks ago we went and there was a sign on the door stating they were on vacation. OK. No big deal.

We tried again when they were supposed to be back and they were closed with no explanation.

And, the last time we tried they looked open during normal business hours, but the doors were locked and the people working made no effort to acknowledge us.

Prior to not being able to go there the last 3 times we've tried...I would have given this place 4 stars. I guess, if you can get in...it's great. I advise calling 1st!",4guhHcnzrximsz-DeEvskg,1,1,2,6xsHrYUQSEpnbT-k8B7eSg

Almost every single time we go, the ribs are cooked to perfection. There was one time the ribs were overcooked and a bit dry, but that was the only time it happened. The cornbread muffins and jalapeno mac & cheese on the side are really tasty too. The flavored iced teas available are quite good too (sweet and peach are two of the options).",q9drdpl33Gzbb1Yz3VfKow,0,0,5,4DDRbaVcdRpqKK9TEgDTqg

The meat was very tender but slightly smoked and I couldn't really taste much of the BBQ sauce.  The ribs are extremely pricey, but looked pretty good.

I love pulled pork sandwiches and beef brisket but with all the raving about the ribs here I just had to try and MAN am I glad I did.  The sauce is amazing and the meat just falls right off.  They are so meaty too.  This meal was amazing...  It was our first time there so we tried a little bit of everything.  We ordered a full rack of ribs, a hot link sandwich, wings, mac n cheese, fried okra, and potato salad.  Everything was absolutely phenomenal and the service is second to NONE!  You feel like you are visiting your Southern Aunt and Uncle.  The peach tea is to DIE FOR.  I am totally craving it right now!  We also sampled the Peach cobbler and the sweet potato pie.. YUM!!  Both were good but I really loved the peach cobbler.  You gotta go!!  It is my new favorite spot in town and its right around the corner form my house.

5009070,2012-08-05,1,Vx-90GpAcH3OAnLmyDHlIQ,"Went to this place because my husband was dying for some BBQ - he's from South Carolina and lived in Kansas City for 2 years. We thought a BBQ place in Vegas was too good to be true - turns out it was. We ordered a full rack of ribs, the pulled pork sandwich, the mac & cheese, and the collards.
The ribs - didn't see an obvious smoke line on the meat, but did have a smoky flavor. Were very tender and meaty, but there was WAY too much sauce. Also, the sauce was definitely not the best BBQ sauce I've tasted.
The pulled pork sandwich - again, too much sauce. Maybe we are biased, both of us like when BBQ is served sans sauce so the meat can speak for itself and you can add as much, or little, sauce as you want. We also like a variety of sauces. This place just has one flavor of very mediocre sauce.
The sides: these were actually the highlight of the meal - the mac and collards were actually pretty good.
Overall, will probably not come back here. As 'ok' as we think Famous Dave's is, we would rather drive there than here for some less than 'ok' BBQ.
On a high point, the service was good, but they just need to work a bit on their BBQ.",fnl_8VB0SWykurnB_nk7DA,0,0,2,7zkMu0iAADXnJe_3Co6suQ

My husband got the ribs and I got the wings.
I only ate one of the wings, because their ranch sauce was disgusting, so I ate the ribs instead and they were amazing.
The wings were great too, but I'll have to bring my own ranch. 
They should really think about changing their ranch though.",BFC_ZzgSUfnOdKQhSEzI9w,0,0,4,RG29GpS6eTyWxBI3Oc3auA

I was a little skeptical at first since the menu looked like not much to choose from and you order before sitting down like a fast food restaurant, but wow was I in for a treat! Everything we tried was awesome! The ribs, the wings, the Mac n cheese, the cornbread. Pure heaven!! And service was awesome. Being in the hospitality industry, I have high expectations and I gave them a ten in my book!!! Will definitely go back.",BtP80pkEWeW3aypxKfWE9g,0,0,5,I_rcvuS3dXgexi-UW35xSw

I want to put out a warning though:  This isn't really a full BBQ place.  Their only ""main course"" items are babyback ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and a hotlink sandwich.  Then they have wings and sides and stuff.  If you're expecting to go there and find 1/4 of a chicken and brisket options, you're going to be out of luck.

The food that they do have is tasty, but their options are very limited.",hheonc2P7Uao3zR5aTWJSg,1,0,4,hpswbnaIh9IdjriFbsxv1w
5961544,2010-07-25,0,Vx-90GpAcH3OAnLmyDHlIQ,"honestly some of the best ribs i have ever had anywhere in the country. very meaty ribs, meat falling of the bone....it's everything you ask for when eating ribs at a bbq place. i am a big guy and i love to eat...i ordered a half a rack and some fries and i finished the fries (thick cut steak fries with a salt and pepper seasoning) and barely half my order before i had to tap out. we went later on a saturday night and our food came out fast and hot. 

if the food isn't enough to keep you coming back, the staff will seal the deal for you. when deciding what to order, the lady at the register slid me a plate with a FREE rib on it to try it out before i bought it. after we ordered, sat down, and were served our racks of ribs and fries...the same wonderful lady brought out free cornbread and potato salad for our table! now, i am not saying to expect free food when you go there. but the generosity and polite nature of everyone there really makes you feel welcome. To top of a perfect meal there was some great blues music playing while we enjoyed our great food. 

las vegas has had slim pickings for quality bbq for a long time. this new addition has moved to the top of the pack in one visit. if you are ever on the 215 and see decatur do yourself a favor and take the exit north and give it a try. you'll be hooked",kittuNN8czCY1AVA_RvExQ,0,0,5,kfuJonp6WjiBJmVY4xNIjQ
