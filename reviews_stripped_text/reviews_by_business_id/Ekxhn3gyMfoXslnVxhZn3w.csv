Customer service is always fine.",vGDwl1oYxqRDeRgiqJcCpw,0,0,2,POhyuF_99NUwgWPYec_4YQ
962925,2016-04-10,0,Ekxhn3gyMfoXslnVxhZn3w,"Our first day arriving in Las Vegas we go to this Taco Bell and it's like 1 something in the morning so they have 24-hour drive-thru. We ordered a grande meal and a steak burrito for our family and the person at the window kept on telling us that there was no ground beef so we ask him to make tacos with chicken instead, hard tacos. 
The cashier said yes he gives us our total and they charged us 3 dollars more because because we wanted chicken. We pulled forward and I proceeded to ask him why are we getting charged $3 extra, it wasn't our fault they ran out of beef. But yet we want the deal to save money. He was a Rude man who said he couldn't do anything about it and it was store policy and that's the way it is.
I come to vegas to see my Grandchildren and my son and daughter in law. This city has the worse customer services I have ever seen or been apart of.",FmTyz43MJYLIhRj4EPbmyA,0,0,2,mrMMNaHJnFX4KwCfgOyXcw

1572398,2017-12-01,0,Ekxhn3gyMfoXslnVxhZn3w,Well for one it's tacohell what do you expect. Literally the only time I eat here is when I'm pregnant. For what ever reason I crave tacobell. It's fake meat and not even real Mexican food. That being said it's  exactly what I expected it to be and satisfied my odd pregnancy craving. They did forget my cheesy potatoes and empanada but when my husband went back they apologized and gave us free cinnamon twist. So that's cool with me.,U_v8mw7fFh3rGTT_r0NGWg,0,0,5,r8bS4S6CBjNz3L44XMIvng
2041691,2016-04-05,0,Ekxhn3gyMfoXslnVxhZn3w,"We ordered food from the drive thru and when we got our food, an entire combo order was missing. First, when we told the woman it was missing, she basically did not care or even apologize. Second, it was such an inconvenience having to go back and wait for our full order so we politely asked when we finally got the right order if there was ANY possible way we could have some form of compensation for our trouble..like simply just an extra taco or some cinnamon twists or maybe just an APOLOGY. The entire staff ignored us, stared at us from behind the counter and when we finally left, that's when they said sorry right before laughing from a distance. In general, this Taco Bell has some pretty inconsiderate customer service.",J6PV6LE7MMQj0ia0pW-L4Q,0,0,1,KBNx8ebdN3Zx7Bwu7VRatg

3077815,2018-06-24,0,Ekxhn3gyMfoXslnVxhZn3w,"Stopped by Taco Bell that clearly has Open sign lit up, around 2:55a. Pulled up to the order box and 'Idai' (her name) said they were closed. I asked 'isn't this place open 24hr?' She then replied 'we close at 3' A car right in front of us ordered their meal and she gave them no problem but turned us away. Also, there were NO cars in back of us. Not only did I have to wait behind the other cars till They got their meal, it is even more annoying that we had to reverse through drive thru just to get out. And as we left, we took a snap shot of the Open sign as it was past 3a at this point. I understand an employee would love to go home and shut their doors asap as I have worked in a similar environment but policy is you don't close until Closing time. but that's not good customer service and I would hope it had nothing to do with my race and hope if I come back, I'd be treated better.",YyjuCYqAd2_uWICVVGKGTw,0,0,1,iXlcMb08dgA3Lt05JbJcmg
3093793,2018-02-03,0,Ekxhn3gyMfoXslnVxhZn3w,"This location was recently renovated, it's much more modern and has a clean appeal. Every time we come it's empty never more then five people in. Which can be a good thing for us or a bad thing for business. 
Employees are all nice and make sure the food comes out in good time. On a side note: having to ask if you need a key to use the restroom and finding out that they have to push a button to unlock the door is a little off putting. I understand sometimes why companies do this but for one it's tacky to have to announce you having to use the rest room and must be annoying for the employees to stop what they are doing to push a button. Even though we laughed, it was a bit uncomfortable for my wife who dresses in boys clothes to indicate which restroom she like to use after being asked would you like to use the boys or girls restroom? ( I know everyone is making restrooms a big issue but she is not trans [we support ] she  is still a girl that just so happens to like to dress in boys clothes). Now on to the food : 

I came in to try the new nacho fries, I was sort of excited to try them built up from all the hype from both online and tv commercials. But sadly the tastes and flavor didn't hold up to the hype. I thought the fries would have more season on them and be more crispier. Even the photos of the fries look more appetizing.  If I were to rate the fries I would rate two stars",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,2,1,4,iD5n66nAElfo_R_LR74m3Q

I went through the drive thru, I couldn't understand the cashier because he was talking extremely fast as while mumbling. When I got to the window ise greeting was, ""Wassup Brah"". Excuse me, I don't know you as well as it's extremely unprofessional. My Naked Chicken Taco was disgusting, cold, hard, and tasted as if it had been fried in week old grease. My Doritos Locos Cheese Taco was cold and soggy. I'm not even going to stomach the 3rd taco. To top it all off there was a wait in the drive thru. If I'm going to wait, my food should be fresh.",Oyvf6_sK4HwwEwDkca0vYg,2,0,1,67Z8QVmszOTpmZjp6wuR4w
