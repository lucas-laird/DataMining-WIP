It's not the best in terms of ambience or parking or location but I come here for the food.  I usually get the carne asada torta and it's usually enough to hold me over until the next meal.  I like to mix the Pina and Jaimaca for my own little concoction, which I would recommend.  And they have taco specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

We ordered tacos de cabeza....which are delicious...I really didnt care for the tacos de carne asada...ive had better...but the cabeza was finger licking good. the awesome part is that you get free refills on horchata which you dont find that here in our town....

357664,2010-04-07,0,I22wQGTkLFGn6jTOhwoecQ,"There's something about a 24-hour restaurant that creeps me out a bit... You can't really apply the normal dining barometers, and have to guess:  What time's the food freshly made?  When's the best cook's shift?  And when, pray tell, when do they clean the kitchen?  

Pondered that when, while driving on a road consisting mostly of derelict auto dealership lots and liquor stores (Vegas, baby!) spotted blazing yellow Pepe's.  Being from San Diego, thought I could sniff out a Mexican gem in the rough, and pulled in...  Or maybe I just like bright shiny things.

Apparently, 11:30am is not rush hour at Pepe's.  Parking lot had a few cars in it, but they must've been at the Pawn Shop next door, cause it was empty.  Looked at the menu, typical enough.  They were running a special 4 tacos (street-style, soft) rice and beans for 6 bucks and change.  Not bad.  But then saw the chile relleno burrito and had to order that.  Found the Holy Grail of Chile Relleno burritos at Tere's on Melrose ave in LA, been trying to find another one since.

This wasn't it.

Decent.  Good cheesy filling with a touch of the chile's smokiness, enhanced by some great salsa verde from the salsa bar (the red salsa tasted weirdly metallic) that I dollop-ed on each bite.  Chips were hard and cold (maybe why that other previous reviewer pooped out a periodical element.)  Beans were okay, a bit lardy but not in a great lard-olicious way... 

I'm giving it three stars on potential.  Maybe I ordered wrong.  Maybe there was something soul-enriching simmering in a dented, over-sized aluminum pot back in the kitchen.  I just know one menu item that wasn't.",gE8G_nmQfr04QCYFp4Tlww,0,0,3,VyCmnF2GloLvPa15dOwa3g

1106820,2010-10-15,2,I22wQGTkLFGn6jTOhwoecQ,"After an aborted early morning trip to another eatery, I decided to drive down Fremont to Pepe's.

OK.  East Fremont isn't the best neighborhood around.  But Pepe's was nice and clean.  I arrived at 7:30 or so on a Sunday morning.  I was the lone sober, non-Spanish speaking patron in the establishment, I think.

I stood in the short line and perused the menu on the wall.  The owners were helpful enough to place English words behind each item on the menu... i.e. lengua = tongue, cabeza = head.  The drunk, 5'8"" dude with the Elvis do directly in front of me went with tres tacos lengua.  Nice.  I think I'll pass on the lengua today.

I ordered a couple of tacos al pastor and a cabeza taco.  The lady behind the counter pretended she didn't speak English, which is fine.  I don't think she liked the cut of my jib.  I threw a couple bucks in the tip jar and headed to a corner table.

I heard the lady yell SETENTEQUATRO SETENTEQUATRO SETENTEQUATRO!  Hey, that's me!

I grabbed the tacos and proceeded to devour them.  Solid food...and only $1.49 a throw for the tacos.

Wish they had 24 hour taco joints in the crud where I currently reside.

Don't know if I'll make it back, not the best area and I'm the whitest guy ever and from Minnesota, so I didn't feel very comfortable.

This visit I had a Carnitas (pork) and a Pollo taco.  They were both flavorful without being overly greasy.  I especially liked the crunch in the carnitas.  Hit up the condiment bar and add some pickled onions and salsa to give your tacos a lil' swagger.

But when it's crowded, it's completely difficult to get your food. It's a tight space to begin with, I must've bumped into 3 different ppl before I even ordered my food. They have two counters. Why not use them properly? Designate one ORDER HERE, the other PICK UP HERE. Other restaurants seem to grasp this concept I don't know why they do business this way. It's probably frustrating for everyone including the employees who looked overwhelmed themselves. Okay, enough of that. 

The food was average at best. Good if you're really hungry. I'll be honest, I only came here because the line for Tacos El Gordo was insane and the yelp reviews were positive. I ordered a quesadilla for my kids, very greasy but they seemed to like it. The carne asada fries I ordered had nacho cheese on them, ugh! Nacho cheese? It's carne asada fries, not nachos.

However, at THIS location, the food was SO greasy that it soaked through the paper AND the aluminum wrapped around the burrito. The tortilla barely held itself together and was practically translucent by the end of things. Delicious and totally satisfying? YES. Artery clogging and unfit for consumption in 'civilized' settings? YES.

This was the kind of burrito for when you are drunkski beyond all comprehension and need the perfect ratio of fat-protein-carbs to soak it all up & stagger through the night.

2321600,2017-05-02,6,I22wQGTkLFGn6jTOhwoecQ,"A GREAT PLACE TO GET FOOD POISONING!

The only thing I had to eat last Sunday was Pepe's Super Nachos with carne asada....It is Tuesday and I still am sick. I had to take off work for two days because of this place. I went to this place on a SOBER stomach and I have not eaten out in 4 days before this visit I might add. My food poisoning has been so debilitating that I am going out of my way to contact the Southern Nevada Health District as well as write this review on yelp in hopes that this doesn't happen to anyone else. 

If I were you I would take a good hard look at the bad reviews on here about this place. Everything they say I have experienced personally but lets break this down logically and not emotionally why you should not spend your money here.

Pros:
*Mildly mediocre food to fill you up when you are starving to death or have been drinking. 
*The carne asada usually tastes fine until you feel it a couple hours later lol.
*They have nice TV screens for the menu.
*The male employees are actually very helpful.
*Open 24/7 


Cons: 
*Racist female employees ""Adela"" and others behind the counter scowling at you before you even say hello. They will never say ""Hi"", ""Hello"", ""Welcome"", or anything to greet me personally when I order and will talk shit about me right in front of my face in Spanish as I am ordering as well. (They don't expect anyone who doesn't look Latino to understand Spanish). 
*Obnoxiously loud Latin Music blasting in your ears as you try to enjoy a meal
*Filthy Restrooms...it looks like a torture room from a SAW movie. 
*An almost impossible parking lot...SO TINY and a ridiculous location on cross streets with so many people trying to make u-turns from Fremont and others trying to enter and exit the diagonally awkward parking lot. This means someone is always honking at others to get out of their way and I've seen two verbal fights break out from just parking issues alone. 
*Homeless people inside and outside of the store ambushing you to ask for some of your food that you just bought or for money to buy their item (bicycle they stole or equipment they could not sell next door at the pawn shop). 
*The ordering and pick up system is never working the same, one day the pick up is the ordering side and the ordering side is the pick up side and some days they are both on the same side. It's not very organized and when it gets busy everyone is huddled around each other in uncomfortable awkward irritable silences. 
*No one watches their children in here and kids constantly put their filthy hands in the covered area with the limes, onions and cilantro grabbing limes and pieces of ice. 
*If you sit at the booth right under the air conditioning vent by the covered food area it will leak moisture on your food from the ceiling vent.
*They use nacho cheese instead of real queso, they should be ashamed of themselves for this lol really.
*The Chorizo they use is NOT Chorizo! Chorizo is not pink! Try a chorizo and egg breakfast burrito....you'll see.
*You can tell this place used to be an IHOP, who are they trying to fool? haha

Before anyone reads this and tells their friends reading this ""oh this is probably just one person who complains all the time"" actually I'm not, I eat here all the time but mostly when I am drunk and in a happy mood because its always open. I refuse to go anymore and would not want this case of food poisoning to be experienced by any of my worst enemies.

This is my second time ever coming to this location. I'm from SoCal so I was here last year in September and tried the carne asada quesadilla which was way to greasy and the asada was not the best. It was dry, hard and flavorless. 
I came here last night and ordered the combination burrito which was actually good and the carne asada fries which sucked. The asada was the same as last time. I knew I should of stayed away from the asada but I figured give it another try. 
The sour cream tasted way to sour to the point where I questioned if it was past due. The guacamole is not freshly made and the nacho cheese is watered down. Definitely not worth the price. This place is not on the cheap side. 
According to Pepe's, the asada fries are the best in Vegas? LoL WTF for reals? Nah I make the best and I've had a lot better. So sad if people in Vegas  consider these fries the best around town. 
The cashier was really, really nice. Hard to find that type of service now and days. 
Never thought I would be back to this spot, but since I'm now a Vegas residence for the time being and was in the area I decided to give them another shot. If I ever return I would definitely get the burrito again. Their is a condiment bar. The radishes looked old and had black spots all over them. The salsas lacked flavor. They offer horchata, jamaica, pina and sodas. The taste is ok. It's free refills, so I ain't tripping. You don't really see that anywhere else.

Came w rice,beans and Mexican salad is what I called it; lettuce and tomatoes. Portion was pretty big! Ordered extra sour cream like I always do everytime I eat Mexican food :) 

Husband ordered pastor taco and asada quesadillas. I think he enjoyed my enchiladas more than his food though because he kept on picking on mine.

I had a bout with that food poisoning for a week straight, total dehydration Doctor said I had to let it all pass... I was very sick and missed a whole week of work. 

Come last night, I go to Pepe's with a friend again, I order the same thing, and last night I had burps that smelled like death and the bubble guts again, terror crossed my mind as if maybe it wasn't the chicken, maybe it was this al pastor burrito that had caused the problems... lo and behold by 6am today i'm throwing out water out of the wrong end and it's not pretty, stomach grumbling, things churning, burping still continuing, even right now i can still smell the death in the burps.

Overall, I would not recommend this place.",z8yXk3TW1B6O7HYXpc_PIQ,2,0,2,cRI2ALIJBIURygtei-HvuA

On recommendation from my friend who brought me here I ordered the carne asada tacos (2) and got an order of fries (ay! very gringo of me! so said my friend). Oh well, I can't help it if I'm white and I like fries!

Glad my friend suggested the carne asada tacos, they were bursting with meat and were very flavorful. Got a few different salsas and slathered these little suckers with salsa and lime. Oh man, they were tasty. You're gonna want to get more than one that's for sure. The fries were pretty dang good too. They put some kind of spice on them that gives them a real good kick. You're gonna like it if you like different tastes. I definitely suggest getting an order of fries with whatever you get here.

Ya, the location is a tad ghetto (doesn't bother me), but the place was clean and there was a lot of families in here when we showed up (kinda late actually). 

It's a good little place to get some bomb tacos in my opinion.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,4,0qabqPNaN0Y2Oo7z4qk7JQ

Obviously they have lots of people going day and night to eat there but when it comes to trying to take some salsa home with your tacos they give you a small little container  or small bags and tell you to take it with that. It's pretty ridiculous to fill those small containers with salsa Whomever is the boss there get better containers.,0bW8nfCybipnG0hMwiSh1Q,0,0,2,S_BZBOiedxMjABOhT8v-eg

What is shitty about this place seems to be the employees & policy's , today I couldn't buy a side of avacado or add it to any of my food .... what the actual fuck, that's the stupidest shit.
Another thing that is really annoying when you call in to order the lady taking your phone is having 4 other conversations. They take your order down but won't make it until you get there and pay for it so I don't understand why they even take it over the phone .

4687027,2012-07-08,1,I22wQGTkLFGn6jTOhwoecQ,"Pepe's is not all that and a bag of chips. This is another place that's not far from where I work and it had some recommendations from people that I needed to try it. I'm just not impressed. 

Parking, especially at lunch sucks. If you end up parking behind the place over to the West it stinks, a combo smell of grease and sewer that will blast you the second you open your car door. Once you step inside to what looks like an ancient IHOP from the outside you'll find a busy kitchen, ample seating, serve yourself drink fountains, and 2 places to stand for the staff to take your order. And that's where things go South. I've had my order messed up 2 out of 3 times here due to it being lost in translation. The lunch special with 3 chicken tacos somehow ended up as beef tacos, not the lunch special, and at a higher cost. 

As you wait for your order you can check out the duo-salsa bar. 2 types of salsa and the typical pickled Jalapenos and stuff is all you get, and the tomatillo light salsa is the only one I like. It's great for pouring all over the greasy tacos that you'll get. Crunchy yes, but dang, sometimes they just don't taste good at all. 

I've been here a couple of times for lunch now but don't plan to keep them in my lunch rotation. Lindo Michaocan is not far away drive time wise, and they kick Pepe's to the curb in so many ways. If you happen to be driving down Fremont and are just dying for Mexican food this place won't kill you, but it ain't all that either.

4776614,2017-06-17,0,I22wQGTkLFGn6jTOhwoecQ,"This is a busy location. The set up of the counter and register plus the cart or table for the salsa bar is one of the worst choices I've seen. First the line to order forms just in front of the salsa bar and a group of booth tables. So those trying to order crash, collide, and have to navigate around each other. It bottlenecks. And if that is section is where you happen to sit to eat, then you are at Butt's level, meaning your view is of everyone else's derrière. Next another reviewer wrote that while she was eating an employee was cleaning with fabuloso cleaner and it put her off her food. Well when we were there, during what seemed like a dinner rush, that after it died down just a tad, and yet they were still busy, that mopping the floor was going to happen. I about lost my dinner from the smell of the cleaner. I've worked food service and, well, there are reasons why you shouldn't clean around the customers. Now if all of this doesn't put you off and you want to try, as the sign says, the best tacos, well... Only if you must. These are not the best tacos. I love tacos, have worked my way through the taco places in town and let me ask you - what self respecting Mexican restaurant uses caned cheese on their Nacho's?... If I wanted that I would go to taco bell, at least TB nacho cheese tastes like nacho cheese instead of bland watery cheese like goo.  The chicken tasted like they don't remove the skin before cooking. The flavor was OK, just the skin put me off. The carne asada was edible, slightly better than bland, the street tacos were a little pricey. And the only truly yummy the drink bar is self serve and has pineapple soda... I can get more food for the money that tastes better, at, at least 10 other places including taco bell, and in my opinion taco bell used to be pretty good 20+ years ago but has considerable gotten gross. So in comparison, I'd rather go to taco bell than Pepe's... But you have to at least try it for yourself, because I don't get how this place is so busy all the time. It can not be just the pineapple soda. I wish Pepe's tacos well. I do not like giving bad reviews.

Nothing really jumps out at you at Pepe's, which may actually be a good thing.  Don't expect the food to be spectacular, but neither is the food below average.  The lengua tacos are not overcooked but a bit bland. 

I would actually recommend the al pastor.  But my favorite about Pepes is that your order comes with chips and beans.  The beans are half smashed and half whole, and they taste delicious.  Pepes' chips are also surprisingly fresh.

Not the best mexican restaurant I've been to.  Everything was pretty average and though the carne asada fries weren't part of the menu, they still made it for me.  I prefer Roberto's Tacos carne asada fries over Pepe's and the burritos as well.  Nothing really special about this place.

Outside smells like effing sewage and Pepe's actually have their own song bumpin outside.  It goes something like this, ""aaay aay aaaaay Pepe's taco aaay aaay aaay"", with their traditional trumpet blastin' in the background.

Upon walking in, there is no customer service. In fact, we were kind of ignored and treated like we annoyed them. I even had to go and ask what numbers we were because they weren't given to us.

I spent $30 on two plates of food (taquito Plate and soft taco plate) and two drinks for my son and I and my girlfriend spent $15 on carne asada fries and a fish taco. 

The food is mehhhh! There is no flavor and everything is lacking salt. The taquitos were burnt and dried out. My son didn't even eat the three of them on the plate and he loves taquitos. The guac. had no salt, lacking lime juice or something. My tacos were tasteless, I added lime juice, hot sauce and whatever else I had on my plate just to try and get some flavor out of it. I gave up on the tacos, threw one away. I tried the rice and beans and man, those were better than the tacos but still lacked flavor. 

My girlfriend said the nacho cheese was probably the best thing about her fries as the carne was lacking flavor as well. The fish taco she said was awful. The sauce was sour and she only took two bites of it.

Needless to say, we were not happy with our $50 meal. We both went home and actually vomit from the way everything made us feel afterwards. Customer Service was definitely lacking and made us feel unwelcome. I wont be back.",4EcXeoU6_soBxm73UbDNRw,1,0,2,-Ju_FJLfrlqvF59c9jrB-A
