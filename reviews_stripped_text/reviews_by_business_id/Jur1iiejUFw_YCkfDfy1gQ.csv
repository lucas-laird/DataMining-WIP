Prices are a little higher than in the city where there are more ds options, but that's expected.  Mad props for serving all day dim sum, although not everything on the carts is piping hot if you come during an off time.  They have all the staples here, but you sometimes have to ask if you don't see your favs on the carts.  Shrimp puffs w/ scallions, sesame balls, shu mai, & sugar cane shrimp are some of my favs.  Delicious sweet cream buns (aka pineapple buns), worth the trip alone if you get them hot.  Love that they have noodles on the carts so that less adventurous eaters have a staple they don't need to order off the menu and wait for.  There always seems to be someone in my group who is super grateful for those noodles!  Definitely my go-to spot for dim sum, but I'd recommend coming during prime time (usually 11am on weekends and lunch or din time during the week) for the freshest selection, otherwise your experience might be more of a 2 or 3 star scenario.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,0,0,4,kD0k5A7d__1cyDNoBPUIZg

Overall the place was good, not the best dim sum ever, but pretty good.  Took a party of 7; half had never eaten this type of Chinese food, but they really liked it.

A couple really good things; 1) they serve dim sum all day not just morning/lunch time; you can get chow mein off the cart in individual sizes vs. having to order a huge plate.

Cart service was pretty quick and came by often, wait service was slow.

Paid $71 plus tip for 7 people.

128524,2013-03-25,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Finally, a restaurant that dares to defy traditional lunchtime dim sum hours!

They have the typical offerings like shu mai, har gow, and chicken feet, but the real kicker is that they have it all day!  For the most part, their food is tasty and filling for a low price. Go ahead, indulge in the char siu bao and sesame balls! Just note that the har gow and shrimp wrapped in rice noodle stick together and are scantily filled. Besides the portion size, another issue is that some of the dishes can be bland.

The vast, clean dining space accommodates both the diners and the little old Chinese ladies pushing their metal carts. These carts sure make their rounds quick! Pretty sure the same lady made a few laps before we ordered something from her cart. Plenty of parking is found in the front and back of the building. I like that there's room to maneuver around in and out of the restaurant, because it gets claustrophobic at Chang's.

Anyway, went on a Friday afternoon for lunch. It was about 1pm and it was actually quite empty. We got seated, and right away, the ladies are coming around with their carts full of delicious dim sum. I have the hardest time ordering stuff here because in Hawaii, we call everything by a different name! Its so confusing! haha.

We ordered:
Chicken Char-siu Bao (manapua!) - I thought it was good, they are mini and the filling wasn't char-siu but it was some sort of chicken. 
Shrimp Half moon - I really don't know what the chinese name of this is, but in Hawaii we call it half moon. 
Pork Hash - They were small but I thought they were kind of oily.. but good!
Shrimp Rolls: I call it look fun back home, but none of the ladies knew what the eff we were talking about. It is the shrimps wrapped with a sheet of rice paper with shoyu type sauce poured all over it. This is my favorite thing to order. 
Eggplant w/Shrimp Paste: This was kind of cold by the time we got it, but it was ok. I ordered the bellpepper stuffed with this paste previously.. but I like the eggplant one better.

The service is quick. If it is not too busy, the ladies will come up to you every single time they come around.. even if you said you didn't want what was on their cart. We had to ask a few times for the shrimp rolls in the flat rice noodle, after about the 3rd time asking, the lady went to find that cart and brought the dish to us. 

After about 6 plates, out bill was under $20. I've been wanting to try some other dim sum places.. but I like Orchids because its a big space and the dim sum is pretty good.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,2,0,4,YaASL9HToXJ5LguzUPaFZg

208930,2017-04-12,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"I grew up and lived in Los Angeles most of my life, so when it comes to Dim Sum, I admit to being a bit spoiled. For me, the bar has been set quite high by the variety and quality of Dim Sum available just east of LA.  Because of that and because I am realistic about living in a relatively provincial town compared to Los Angeles, I am willing to judge accordingly and be less critical. 

I have been to Orchid's Garden many times and it's usually passable Dim Sum. I've never walked out of there thinking, ""Wow, that was kick ass"".  That said, I was just glad that at least I could get some Dim Sum here in Las Vegas, albeit mediocre.  

I don't like writing bad reviews of restaurants, but I'm afraid that my last visit necessitates some serious venting. I actually left this dump feeling pissed off. There is almost nothing worse than seriously craving good Chinese food then having an absolutely crappy meal. In a way, it's like having sex and ending with a mistimed lackluster orgasm.  

It was partially my fault for having the temerity of eating at 4:30 in the afternoon. The place was fairly empty and only one sad lukewarm cart was being wheeled about.  Dim Sum is best when a place is overflowing with ravenous customers and hot steaming carts are careening about at the hands of hostile Chinese women who recoil at the thought of serving Gringos.  Oh, wait, I take that back. They were a little rancorous.

Everything we picked from the cart was room temperature at best. The selection was old, oily and diminutive.  With a little imagination, one might wonder if this is what Dim Sum is like when served in socialist Venezuela where people engage in small skirmishes just to get a loaf of bread.  

When I finally flagged down the waitress to get our check, I actually got very Gordon Ramsey on her and said, ""You should be embarrassed to serve crap like that."" My bitchy comment was returned with a blank, couldn't-give-a-shit, stare. 

Four of us in my party vowed to never go back. It was simply terrible. What a shame. Fortunately none of us got sick.",ngk1yxWvxCuO_lvJ87PReg,0,0,1,CqU777I6_DMhXCcWlLcQCQ

One waitress automatically pointed at the stack of menu's at the other end of the counter. My thoughts were ""OK, there are four of you, one is handling some customers paying for her food and the others are just standing there. Couldn't one of them just hand me a menu instead of me just having to make a wide berth around the customers to grab one?"". 

 I didn't say anything but just went went around the other customers and got the menu they pointed out. The menu was for regular Chinese food that I could get anywhere with those prices. There was no dim sum listed. I remembered from reading about this restaurant on Yelp that they must have a dim sum menu. There were no dim sum menu's around the counter, and I didn't get a chance to ask because the same counter people (whom were still just standing there not doing anything) were still focused on the customer they were billing. I'm sure if I waved a brightly colored flag they still wouldn't see me. So I just left, paper menu still in hand.  I really don't know if I'll go back there.

for some odd reason everytime they filled our teapot, they would not close it well, so i kept spilling tea out from the top.  the basic steam items were ok.  i do have to say my favorite chicken feet  in black bean sauce was hella tasty.  the chinese broccoli drowned in oyster was alright, how do you go wrong with that?  they did have shanghai dumplings, but the skin was a bit thick and took away the flavor of the meat inside.  they did have my favorite shark fin dumpling soup with the vinegar, but i was told that the shark fin that i have always thought to be in this dish was sometimes replaced with glass noodles...is it b/c im not chinese???   otherwise it did taste good.   i also had the yummy egg tarts and egg tarts w/fruit.  i also had the silky tofu in sugar-ginger soup....ooh  so warm to my belly.  i think its a good idea to come around 12:30pm, b/c the longer we stayed the more new dishes came out.  right before we were leaving, we saw the this pineapple bun filled yellow egg custard.  that was the first time i had that.  imagine, taking a bite on a sweet crusty bun and having creamy yellow egg custard squeeze into your mouth.  so for now, this place will have to do as i join my lovely dining companion for the search for the best place for dim sum in all of vegas...stay tuned b/c i have another restaurant in mind already.....",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,3,3,3,9ha7RqEisK39HAInEnIgUg

I took away one star for two reasons. 1. the place is a bit dirty and 2. the dim sum cart ladies are relentless. They come by your table if you even make accidental eye contact with them and start putting dishes on your table when you didn't even order it.

Orchid Garden looks very impressive as you pull in to the parking lot.  When I saw the sign advertising Dim Sum all day, I was elated.  It was like a snow day on a day you didn't do you homework.

I was seated in the busy restaurant and ready to nosh!  Dining here when it is busy reminded me of the crowded China Town streets of Chicago more than the food did.  Waitresses are running up and down the aisled with carts full of various small bites (Dim Sum).  While I liked the variety, I was not blown away by any one dish.

The pork buns, fried calamari, and shrimp puff all had very similar flavors, as if they were seasoned using the same ingredients.  They weren't bad, but did not taste that fresh.  I was reminded of buffet food, which is usually fine but not spectacular.  

The regular menu here has some very interesting and authentic dishes.  (Sea Cucumber, various fungi, etc..)  The Dim Sum is really just like going to a Chinese buffet and not getting out of your seat when you want more.

To dine here without waiting very long, try coming at off times or during lunch on a weekday.

The Shao Long Bao (Pork Mini Buns) were dry and nasty. The rice wrapped in lotus leaves tasted a bit odd and the Shu Mai and Chicken hands could have been much better prepared.

My family has been coming to this restaurant regularly for years (on average, we come in 3-5 times a month). We constantly come back simply because of our love for dim sum and only that. Since the first day we ate here, service has always been unreliable. Perhaps 1 out of every 5 visits here, we receive somewhat mediocre service. Every other time, we are faced with rude and dismissive servers, eager to just move through every table and complete their rotation. One server, who clearly had plenty more shumai in her cart, was extremely hesitant to give us more than one order. Shu mai is our family's favorite and we typically order at least 3 bowls. It seems as if every employee there would rather be somewhere else. Even the lady, who seems to be the manager, was on her phone before my brother personally went up to her asking for our check. Our table was right in front of her and we had finished eating atleast 10 minutes prior. The food is good, but we will consider going to another establishment next time.

One thing I noticed that even in a group of about 8 they would ask each person anytime they had food to offer drinks or needed more services. The food here was really great! Based on my friends' reactions I'd recommend the duck, we got it with buns. Surprisingly enough though it definitely was the fried tofu that was amazing and one of the best things I had to eat. 

My concerns are that while the staff was attentive when there, they were not often attentive throughout the night. The green tea served was also never replenished and with a large group that is something I would have appreciated.

1546874,2009-05-08,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"First, the plusses:  Orchids Garden offers Dim Sum all day, not just during the morning and lunch hours.  It's inexpensive.  Two of us staggered out for $18, including tax and a generous tip.
The minuses:  It's way too far away from my apartment near UNLV.  As in too many transfers, too long a bus ride.  The Dim Sum was okay.  We had a variety of dishes, but nothing was superb.
The neither-good-nor-bad:  Orchids Garden also has American-style Chinese food (Chow mein, sweet and sour something...).  I saw an Anglo couple (I'm Anglo, too) with those kinds of dishes on their table.  There were also plenty of Asians eating Dim Sum or real Chinese food.  If I were going out for Chinese food with a very mixed group (which would be my classmates, or my former colleagues), this would be a good choice because everyone could get something to their liking.",V33eN85b4PvAsPIQRaaecg,1,0,3,hnbCBA6bZ1RKg7Ppas0I4w

Was not to sure what this whole dim sum thing was about only that it was small portions that came to you on carts and you just picked what you wanted. Went with 2 girlfriends from school and we were hungry. We ended up getting 9 plates to share. It did not seem like a lot of food because everything came in 3s. Three small potstickers, three small pork balls, three small this, and that. Well we were so wrong.    After eating all the different things we had to be rolled out of there. 

Place was good, only problem is you don't know how much things cost when they are wheeling them around. They ask if you want it, you say yes, they give it to you then they take a stamp and place it on A,B,C etc.  at the end they take your ticket and bring you back your bill with the price. Everything in Chinese except the dollar amount.

1559846,2010-09-30,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Okay... I have only lived in Las Vegas for about 2 years now.  The only two places that I have had Dim Sum is at Cathay House (4x's) and Orchid Gardens (first time here).

Honestly, Cathay House has gotten a bit downhill.  So, after this experience, I kinda prefer this place now.  By the way, when I lived in London, we used to have Dim Sum with my clients every Sunday.  After a year of this, I don't frequent Dim Sum as much...lol..

Anyways, my aunt, uncle, and cousin invited me and the wife for a ""free"" lunch at Orchid Gardens.  Hey man, with a mortgage and expenses, the old saying, ""if it is free, it is for me"" truly applies.  Heck yeah, I accepted.  LOL...

We went on Sunday afternoon.  It was jammed pack.  We had to wait about 30 minutes.  When we got a table, it was difficult to maneuver through.  

Service -- Well, let's start with the good.  The cart comes around quite frequently.  And, the ladies are very nice.  By the way, they hardly speak a word of english.  I think they are either Vietnamese, Chinese, or a mix of other Asian ethnicity.  But, they are all sweet and polite.  As for getting water or drinks.... Good luck.  Sometimes, I often wish that I bring a big bright flashing red light to alert waiters or bus people to our station for water or any other needs.  Overall, I give this a 3.5 (due to the nice ladies)

Food -- okay, for the life of me, my wife loves chicken feet.  Why oh why?  It is basically bones and skin; but, she devours them.  For someone who weighs 85 pounds, I can understand why.  Personally, I like the Shumai, the pork rib bones, anything with shrimp stuffed in it, and sticky rice.  There are others; but, I don't know how to write it in english.  Overall, the food is very fresh and it is quite good.  By the way, I wish they had more vegetable dishes... i.e. chinese broccoli or bok choy.

After our meal, our tab for about 6 people was barely under $100.  Not bad. 

I would recommend this place.  Enjoy!",qy47UXcmGYsPhDSc6iHWPA,2,2,4,p0Vj5TpV2Z2pTcVt2Ch_og

This place is 4 stars for the dim sum and prices but 3 stars for regular Chinese food and the ambience/service.

Dim Sum is pretty good and really cheap compared to some of the Honolulu places.
We had 12/15 different dishes and the 4 of us dropped only 12 bucks each, all in.
They have both the steamed baskets and small dish plate servings.
Ladies roam around the large restaurant over and over again.  After awhile it got annoying, especially the harsh tone used as they yell at you what their cart has.  But they do have the green bottle soy sauce(low sodium)!

Of course, it could have been the lack of sleep on our part.  But I figure that if you say ""no, thank you - no need gin dui"" twice, you do not need to hear ""u like gin due?!?!"" over and over again repeatedly.   There were not that many tables at an early lunch so I was hoping they would remember that our table does not want gin dui!   oh well.  I bring sign next time - ""NO GIN DUI HERE"".  Some of my buddies say that in a Dim Sum place you do not need to respond to every call out to your table.  So, is it really OK to just ignore the cart aunties?  I was taught to try to respond to every request to you with ""yes, please, or no thank you"".  I guess I need to learn how to just ignore the cart aunties!

Big  corner sign and Big restaurant with good number of locals getting dim sum in and take out.
Overall, very filling cheap dim sum lunch.  Just get some sleep before going as you will need patience with the roaming aunties with carts!

Waitresses walk around with carts filled with plates of dimsum, and they stop at each table. You pay per plate by category. As you take plates, the watresses stamp your food bill:
A ($2.30) - our favorites are the Steamed BBQ Bun and for dessert: Baked Sweet Cream Bun and Red Bean Sesame Ball.
B ($3.10) - our favorites are Shrimp Hargow, Baked BBQ Pork Pie, Shrimp Pasted Eggplant (make sure you get the sauce), Pan Fried Chives Dumpling, Shrimp with Rice Noodle, and for dessert: Mango or Coconut Pudding (with sweetened condensed milk.)
C ($4.15) - Sugar Cane Shrimp
D ($6.15) - Chinese Broccoli, Seaweed Salad, and the Chow Mein.

The standouts are the Chow Mein (even though $6.15 is over-priced for noodles), the Steamed BBQ Bun is the best deal, Pan Fried Chives Dumplings were our favorite, and the best dessert is the Baked Sweet Cream Bun!

Who could ever expect this place to be in Las Vegas? Well, that's a factor in my opinion why reviewers trip out on Orchids. I rate my restaurants based on flavor more than any perceived authenticity and this place serves really tasty food!!!!

I've been to a really decent place in the San Gabriel Valley (SGV) called Ocean Star which is pretty much the best true dim sum I've had and I much prefer Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant. Let me also say that Ocean Star is one of the top four dim sum places in the SGV according to Yelpers. I also went to a really, really bad dim sum place in Las Vegas too. 

If you look at the Elite reviews for Orchids you will see that they are mostly three and four star ratings! Few dim sum places in the SGV do better than 3.5 stars overall! Trust me, Orchids is great!!!!

Lately, my BF and I have been to a bunch of places that do not serve Chinese brocoli - but they've got it here! We love our Chinese brocoli too! Just as in Los Angeles the dim sum arrives in carts. There is a great variety of items to eat and they were all good. My BF loves the seaweed wrapped stuffed rice here and he's really picky! All of the shrimp was fresh as can be! I really liked the dim sum sauces here. Another great thing about Orchids is that the dumplings do not fall apart nor ar they too sticky! They are alsonice and juicy! Not as great as Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles, but heck, few things are as great as Din Tai Fung haha! The tea was well steeped too! I really take my tea seriously and sometimes places serve yellowish and flavorless water. Not here!

The place is packed with a mixed crowd! Service was a little better than in Los Angeles SGV places! Lots of free parking!",VWmuhCSYSJyAuXRyckp1tA,18,16,5,_L8l0qG-FafH85Qm1hXb9g

The spare ribs are a bit fatty and greasy, and the one time I tried the fried squid, it was fairly chewy and a little oily, but everything else is delicious. The sesame balls are especially tasty!

While I've never tried to split a check here, I can imagine it would be problematic since Dim Sum by nature is food to be shared, and they just punch the card at your table when you ask for a dish. I guess if you really want to split a check they probably will, but if you're trying to keep your order separate from other people at the table, you might have trouble with it.

Love the authentic Chinese dishes, too. Definitely check it out. It's a great place for lunch or dinner.",_uO9Uo2GpxgjxG-FPezEhw,1,0,4,15M6PjPGEQy1iB4TRgj2wg

We devoured 21 dishes between the 4 of us.

I really like this place.  Dim sum can be bad if it's not fresh. But it is good here. A warning - you should get there before 1:30 or the number of dim sum carts hawked by their cart ladies declines after the peak of lunch.  They do advertise ""dim sum all day"".  So, you can order it on the phone or in person, and all of your stuff will come out freshly steamed or baked.  They do not take dim sum from the cart ladies for to go orders. 

This is a free standing building off Sahara west of Eyeglass World. The decor and ambiance isn't something you'd wow about.  The bathrooms aren't the cleanest, and the parking during peak times (noon - 1 PM) can be a challenge.  But overall, it was a nice place to be when you want some dim sum as well as traditional Chinese food.  A lot of first time customers get a puzzled look when they cart ladies come by, but often by the end of their meal, they're hooked.  

I don't like everything on the menu.  But there were lots of things our group loved.  We tried/shared all the different types of siu mai, egg rolls, har gow and  pork bun (steamed, baked).  Loved that gai lan, and enjoyed the porridge. We had their fried fish, noodles, and some desserts like custard pie, sweet rice cakes, sesame balls, and I forget the rest. We went  a1:15 PM so the stuff was pretty fresh and the little carts were still darting through the restaurant. Some of the ladies were hard to understand but it didn't matter as long as you could see what she had in her cart. We took what we didn't finish home.  But except for the desserts, they tasted much better in the restaurant.  Lucky for me being a sweet tooth, they made for a great after dinner snack.  Yummy

It's a hassle from where in OC I live to get to the decent dim sum places in LA county.  How I miss living in the SF Bay area where dim sum places in Oakland and SF Chinatown are plentiful and yummy.  But when visiting my relatives in Vegas, this is an excellent choice.

Dim Sum was a D+ at best - this is compared to all other Dim Sums.  If you have to choose something, get the pork siomai.  It's a solid C-, so it's the best you're gonna get here.

The entrees (Why order an entree at a Dim Sum place?  Shame on me, I know.) were not edible.  I really mean it.  The fried rice wasn't fried and the beef... well, it wasn't beef.

If you have thin skin, or like clean dishes, go elsewhere.  The ladies on the carts would give you some serious stink eye if you didn't take their grade D meat.  And if you ask for a fork without any residue, more stink eye!

Came in for an early dinner at about 6PM.
Love how they have the cart ladies circulating around with goodies- so many places in SF simply have you order from the menu and only have carts on Sundays or lunch service. Here you can do carts and also order menu dishes if you want.

We got probably half the menu, including shrimp shu mai (tasty), shark dumplings (have to try), shrimp noodle roll (personal fave), fried shrimp ball (BF's fave), crab ball (star of the night, at $7/a pair), steamed pork bun (mediocre), chinese broccoli (must-have) and duck (which we didn't need at all but was tasty- especially with the sauce).

Made the mistake of ordering the soup dumplings, which they said would take 10 minutes- and we waited and waited and waited. And my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I got steamed pork buns while I waited (way too sweet, did not even finish one).  The lady told us they were ""coming right out"" four times. Eventually it was a solid half hour to get our three soup dumplings- and they weren't very good, and only had about a sip of soup inside of them. Underwhelming, would not get again.

We spent just shy of $50, which is absurd for dim sum, but predictable for our over-ordering habits. It's probably also why we only have dim sum once every month or two. Dining room is nice, much larger than expected though you san see it's a large place from the outside.

1.  The place looks ok, I think they can fix it up a little, but it's not gross or anything.  Regular cloths, uncomfortable chairs, not too roomy to walk around.  It's not too bad, but definitely not a first date location.

2.  The service is pretty good.  They were attentative, fast, and courteous.  They brought us the dishes quickly and were eager to serve.  The water refills came every so often, and they brought us rice as well.

3.  The food was so fresh and delicious.  I don't know if it was because it was so fresh and I was hung over or if it is just the cooks there, but the food was PERFECT.  It was a perfect brunch for 12 of us.  We literally cleaned out all of their carts and the restaurant had to wait about 10 mins for more dim sum.  And once that came out, we did some damage to that too.  The total bill for us was $12.50 per person, and that's including tax and tip.  Seriously!  That cheap to feed all of us with delicious Chinese Brunch?  Win!!

This is definitely a great dim sum place for Vegas.  I'll hit this place up again for sure when I'm in the mood for something off the strip.",Uemt--n80WveCP2D1O5ILw,0,0,5,VjZQuVtxCCEN9GJEzcDSnQ

A friend invited several of us to celebrate her successful completion of her doctoral degree and to enjoy some dishes.  We chose a variety of dishes, including the chicken feet, the Chinese broccoli, the pork dumplings, turnip cakes, and Peking duck. 

Pros: plenty of parking, clean and updated bathroom (the sinks were those fancy glass basins that sit on top of the counter), and clean floor (yes, worth mentioning IMO!).  Service was pretty good, perhaps due to my friend being Taiwanese and speaking Cantonese!  The cart ladies came around often and prices seem reasonable, but I wouldn't know for certain because my friend treated us to dinner.  (Nice or what?)  

Cons: personally, I liked the broccoli, pork dumplings, and turnip cakes the best.  I found the chicken feet greasy and lacking in texture; the skin tasted cold and sort of like congealed fat.  Same with the duck; while I enjoyed the flavor of the actual duck meat with the accompanying sauce, I thought the skin was more limp than crisp, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.

Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out as stellar.  It was a fun evening with some friends and I'm glad to have sampled some dim sum again, but I think I'll check out another Asian eatery next time.",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,1,0,3,NYn9rl1TxQXaSyEYuRC-jw

There are many restaurants in the valley that serve dim sum, but Orchids Garden (in my opinion) offers the widest variety of tasty dim sum dishes and the most authentic dim sum eating atmosphere.

Never be shy about asking the ladies pushing the food carts what they have. They may be hard to understand, but they WANT you to order stuff from them, so they will be glad to show you.

Dan Tat - Egg tart - 2/5 - small and custard was too firm/chalky taste
Chow Mein - 2/5 - Oily but tasty
Pei Dan Sow Yook Jook - 1000 year old egg, pork congee - 3/5
Jeen Dui - Sesame Glutinous Ball - 2/5 - wheres the filling?
Boa Loa Bow - Pineapple Bun - 4/5 - Yum!
Fong Jou - Chicken Feet - 4/5 - Tasty

And a veggie steamed roll ...name escapes me in both Chinese and 'engrish'...lol4/5.

Atmosphere was typical Chinese dim sum with a few yells here and there from the servers.  Don't usually recommend sitting by the kitchen anywhere else, but its a prime spot for dim sum restaurants as you get the first picks/selections and everything is steaming hot.

Total with tip was $35 for 2 people.

The selection was certainly there and could of tried much more...aka spring rolls, veggie dishes, stuffed green peppers, tofu dessert...etc but 10 dishes for 2 people was 'pant sized-up' enough...lol.

Luckily, this place is very clean. 

Basically your typical dim sum place, which for all of you who don't know is kinda like tapas (small plates) of Chinese food. Servers come past the tables pushing carts full of food that you can choose from. They bill you at the end of the meal according to a little order card on your table, which they stamp/write on when you get each plate. 

We had the chow mein (fried noodles), the choy sum (Chinese broccoli), shumai (pork meatballs in egg wrapper), shrimp balls, shrimp potstickers, char siu bao (steamed pork bun), chive dumplings, and the crab balls. Make sure you get those crab balls. They have a crab claw sticking out of them to identify them and they look weird, but they are sooooooo juicy and delicious.

2361229,2011-05-20,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"I came here with my boyfriend and his friend (and friend's wife). Being Chinese, from NJ, and having spent a good amount of time having dim sum in Chinatown, NY or in Queens, I thought it was pretty good. We had a lot of the familiar dishes -- ha gow , loh bok goh, cha siu bao, siu mai (steamed shrimp dumplings, turnip cake, steamed pork buns, pork dumplings respectively)-- as well as others that I didn't know (and unfortunately, I don't remember what they were). I thought they were decent.

We also had dau fu fa (it's basically tofu with sweet syrup) except that I never had it the way this place served it: hot and with ginger-flavored syrup. Maybe it's not even called a syrup; it's waterier than what I'm used to. It was good, but I prefer it the way I've always gotten it in Chinatown, NY -- cold and just with the plain sweet syrup. Their tofu was also already broken down.  When my parents got us this snack (from here, I believe: http://www.yelp.com/biz/fong-inn-too-new-york), it was whole, in a deli pint container because we usually got them to go. It came with a few disposable condiment containers full of syrup. We sliced up the tofu ourselves and enjoyed it cold.

One thing I thought was weird was that they didn't have any oyster sauce  (ho yau). What Chinese establishment doesn't carry oyster sauce?! When you order loh bok goh in NY, you get oyster sauce with it. They said they didn't have any, but they offered to give me hoisin instead. I said okay, I'll try it. I was reluctant to eat it that way, but I dabbed a bit on the first piece, tasted it, and found that my expectations for this new combination were correct -- it was gross. I finished off that piece and ate the other two plain. Maybe next time I go, I should bring my own little container of oyster sauce so I can enjoy the loh bok goh way I always have.

Other than that, a good experience. I may try Ping Pang Pong someday. Like someone mentioned in a review for there, the name didn't seem to indicate authentic dim sum was served, but that reviewer said s/he was proven wrong.

I can't understand how this place got three and a half stars; the only explanation that comes to mind is that Vegas isn't the prime place for Asian food, but I don't think it's that unreasonable for people to have taste buds, much less standards.  Orchids boasts of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that's the source of all its problems. It's near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food is usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here is oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person. I could barely eat.

And most recently... DIM SUM & ALL DAY 

As soon as I heard it was an all day dim sum place my spidey sense went berserk. I tried mentioning other options like Noodle Palace, KFC, or even cyanide...but I didn't want to be rude to the birthday girl so off we went. 

1st Impression: It's 2pm on a Friday...this is SO not the time to go for dim sum. 

2nd Impression: Overflowing trashcan as soon as you walk in. ***getting nauseous*** 

3rd Impression: The smell of rancid oil. ***Mental note not to eat anything fried and getting more nauseous*** 

4th Impression: I bit down into a COLD piece of siu mai. ***Thinking happy thoughts to hold back chunks***

5th Impression: 'Why aren't we leaving?', I think to myself as we proceed to order MORE food. 

6th Impression: 1/2 the food that we order is cold and we are forced to ask the cart lady to get us hotter trays from the bottom of the cart ***Thinking about where I can locate and Epipen and wondering why we're still there*** 


In summary: This is one of the nastiest dim sum places I have EVER encountered. As I predicted, all day dim sum means a lot of their stuff is frozen and machine made (e.g. har gao, char siu bao, etc.). If you have no idea what good dim sum tastes like, don't like yourself very much, or are in a state where euthanasia is illegal then come on in.

So I tried it out again with my mother today and I have to say the food was not bad. It was a typical Chinese restaurant but definitely a couple steps higher than the Chinese buffet. I had the chicken chow mein which was rather salty but pretty good. My mother had the moo goo gai pan which was decent. 
The service definitely was bad to say the least. I understand that we're right at the edge of Chinatown, however there was an entire staff that had a giant language barrier with me and my mother. After being in business all these years in America, you would think that the English would be getting a little bit better and better. Not so much. We sat down to eat ordered our food and then they brought it out in a to go box. Maybe they were trying to gives a hint to leave? Maybe because I had my 18-month-old son with me and they were dreading having to clean up after him? Honestly whatever the reason was they didn't get that we were there to dying in considering they set us we placed our order. They then brought our food which was lukewarm out to us to our plates to service and never refilled our water. When we get ready to pay we waited in line go to the cashier and realize that they just recently got a B rating from the health District. I wasn't that much of a happy camper.

It has been YEARS since I've had dim sum in an actual dim sum restaurant so I was excited.  It was my companion's first time (ever) to a dim sum restaurant, and I think he liked it.

I gave 3 stars because there were a lot of carts and a lot of different items to choose from, but not very many just meat or just veggie options.  We were seated quickly and our water and hot tea were brought at promptly as was our plain steamed rice (for my semi-picky 2-year old)  Also, a lot of what we ordered was a little greasier than I expected it to be.  I don't know the exact names for the items but I'll try my best to describe them.

CHOW FUN: I think that is what the lady called it.  I'm used to chow fun being flat noodles cut finger-width and quickly sauteed with some meat and veggies and soy sauce.  This chow fun was kind of like one big sheet of rice noodle rolled up, then sliced into 1-inch logs and cooked in oil, soy sauce and chili.  Whatever it was, I liked it and would definitely order again.

FRIED CALAMARI: Crispy, chewy, crunchy with a little spice (from a small amount of diced jalapeno).  It was alright.  I've had better and I've had worse.  My daughter had fun eating this one.

PORK BUNS: We had two kinds. One steamed and I think the other was baked with honey on top.  Both had a sweet red pork filling.  I liked the steamed version while my companion preferred the softer, sweeter, baked version.

TURNIP CAKE:  Kinda mushy, warm and Turnip-y.  It was how I remembered turnip cake to be (only back home they would fry it to order in front of you).  My companion did not care for it, but it reminded me of home.  I guess its an acquired taste, or a textural preference.

EGGPLANT WITH SHRIMP PASTE:  I don't know if this is steamed or fried.  The shrimp part was alright; the eggplant was a little greasy and under-seasoned.  The server added a little mystery sauce (soy reduction or oyster sauce...I don't know) but that didn't really help.

PORK SHUMAI: tasted like shu-mai? Kind of like the calamari: I've had better and I've had worse.

CREAM  PUFF: that's what they called it.  It was a soft baked bun filled with a small amount of plain whipped butter and topped with shredded coconut.  We were disappointed.  It was alright, but not what we were expecting.

EGG TART: simple egg  custard baked in a puff pastry shell.  My personal favorite... a little skimpy on the filling, but I didn't  mind.

SESAME BALL:  it was just ok.  Crispy on the outside and semi-sweet on the inside.  The rice paste came out a little mushy/pasty instead of chewy.

The table next to us had some fried chicken wings but none of the carts we saw had them.  I did see some chicken feet pass by, though.

Dim Sum has always been one of my favorite Asian cuisines since I was little. :] I would always get excited with the steam carts that come rolling around because the food is not only ready when you say, but it's downright delicious. Can't stress that enough.

This restaurant has been around for several years now and I'm glad it still exists. Their dim sum is authentic and one of the best tasting. They may not have what you want from the steam cart all the time, but you can always order it fresh. Which is a good thing, so you know that it hasn't been sitting in the cart all day.

My absolute fave items are the shrimp noodle, shumai, hargow, beef tripe, shrimp dumplings, and shark fin dumplings. For dessert, make sure to order the sweet cream buns! So bomb. Their regular menu is good too.

I frequent this place so much, that the workers have become my friends. HAHA They know my big appetite for dim sum is real. Being a fellow Asian, I criticize every lil thing about this cuisine because I want it to taste the same every time. Now the only downfall is that some menu items are really oily, but steamed food is better than fried. Plus, dim sum portions are small so it's not the worse thing, but something to consider for those that watch for their oil and salt intakes.

The restaurant itself is not formal, but they occupy a big space. It's a whole building. lol Which is really great if you come here with a big group.

Give this place a try when your craving for dim sum is too much to handle. Let it become your go-to place when you want to order for pick-up too. It's a stand alone restaurant for a reason.",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,6,4,4,VsOADpZ53dSKS9G4iqfQcg

We always get the pan fried combination noodles when coming to a dim sum place, bao (pork bun) and siomai (dumpling). Today my sister ordered the crab ball which is basically crab meat balled and fried. It was pretty good actually, and they ask if you want the mayo dipping sauce to go along with it. My advice, ask for a couple spoon scoop fills if you like mayo or creamy dipping sauces so you'll have enough for 3 of the shrimp balls. Really does do the shrimp and crab balls justice.

3247603,2014-08-23,3,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Wow... Reading some of the negative reviews prior to writing this is a little perplexing as I encountered no such things. My standards too low? Or yours too high? Princesses, do you get treated rudely often? Do you see the common denominator there? (Cough cough.. You.) Might I suggest you mind your own tone of voice and body language when speaking to someone. Respect goes two ways. Servers are there to serve you food, not be your personal servant. There is a difference. And if you're going to use a rude tone to someone don't be so shocked when you get it back. Try being polite and courteous. It will make a world of a difference in not just the response you get from servers, but from people in general. Not sure what to make of the ""treated like crooks"" comments. Might be from the same group.. Perhaps you ever thought to yourself that they are that vigilant because they got ripped off one too many times?? And I have taste buds. Thanks for wondering. I'm also full Chinese. So I know my dim sum. Need a blood sample? how about a geneologic family tree? (Insert eye roll here).

I've been to many dim sum places in LA, SF, HI, Vancouver, and Vegas. Everywhere I travel I will find me a dim sum place to try out. On my most recent trip to Vegas I ate here twice. Found this place via Yelp. Thank you Yelp! There aren't many dim sum places in Vegas. The others I have been to are mediocre at best. Given the lack of competition Orchid Garden is the best in Vegas that I have tried. 

With that said.. Neither times that I came was I presented with rude behavior. They were actually quite pleasant and helpful. The first time it was around lunch (12:00 pm) and the second late breakfast (10:00 am). Both times our food was hot, fresh, and good tasting. Lots of options for dim sum. For that matter I have never been to a place with so many selections to choose from. Hence why I had to come twice so I could try as many as my little piggy heart desired. Well seasoned. Not overcooked. I really liked the shrimp ball on sugar cane skewer. The only dish I wasn't crazy about was the daikon/radish cake. The daikon was a bit bitter, which told me it was slightly undercooked. Otherwise just about everything we tried was yummy. 

From what I could see and tell this place was clean. No pieces of food stuck onto utensils. No dirty cups.  No fingers went into my water. I inspect my plate, cups, and silverware before eating everywhere I go. Bit of a germaphobe. The place is huge and just looked a little old. I would go back my next trip out to Sin City.",i7058savoJRN5RBeixLl0Q,4,2,4,jRlM-tJ_z3qtH291PMX3yw

Uhhh is that the only thing you have here at Orchids Garden?

After an entire weekend of debauchery, eating the greatest foods, a saturday night partying in XS, I expected so much more from a highly yelped place.

Dim Sum all day:
I don't understand this concept because i cannot fathom what happens right when we leave, more dimsum will either magically appear or you will close for a couple hours and reopen again for the hung-over and hung-ry.

Like my friend Jeff C. said last night, ""Shumai was like honey i shrunk the kids"" Because it was so little i questioned if i was really eating it or it was another Las Vegas desert mirage.

I've had bad dimsum before in San Diego, but man, it feels like, this is the absolute worst I have had. Its not that it was disgusting, but the whole idea of the little carts coming around and you choosing from a plethora of dim sum options was non existent and I was left sorely disapppointed. 

The only think i had here was a potential to meet some people that i apparently danced the night away with... If i could remember them.

Unlike a night of partying with some major cuties, Orchids Garden left me with the smallest figment of resonating memories.

And why does everyone who works here look strange... and not speak a lick of engrish.

And no, I do not want to try the Carl. You have offered it 8 times.

Sooty L., Did we go to the same place because the place you are describing, Jeff C. and I wish we went there instead.",GVn_BhCNwJsQzvPy5ECYvA,1,1,2,frqFtYuk3mkde-Wj-26Hpw
3298445,2013-08-02,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"From NYC.  I've had my fair share of both ""authentic"" Chinese (Flushing, Chinatown, etc) and my fair share of ""takeout style.""  But what on Earth is this?  I like new things/styles, but only if done right. This wasn't. 

Let's begin:
Upon entry, the smell of incense is present to mask the smell of urine pouring out the messy bathroom. Service was friendly, but incessant, to the point of annoying. 4 times within five minutes being asked if I want a refill on my Coke. I didn't. I'm on a diet. But I said yes, like tipping the ugly girl at a strip club so she goes away!

Now for the food. Where is the sauce?  The pork fried rice and chicken fried rice came out white. Looked steamed, not fried. Tasted bland as anything, flavored only by what tasted like a hint of butter. My wife's meal is traditionally served with a brown sauce (hoisin). However, there was nothing on it. Everything tasted boiled (in water) or steamed. I tried several Dim Sum dishes. The continual cart system was kinda neat, but many of the plates were indistinguishable from one another. Some were just gross, mushy, bland, ""mystery meat.""  One or two puréed shrimp dim sum dishes were decent, not too fishy (shrimp toast style).

The place had no ""dumpling sauce,"" a staple in Chinese takeout where I'm from. It's essentially warm soy, ginger, and scallions, maybe some brown sugar. They did present me with vinegar instead. On my half of the continent, the Chinese vinegars are dark in color, similar to balsamic. This vinegar was pink, tasting like something you'd use to clean your shower. 

Wontons were small with the very thin wrapper, halfheartedly twisted at the end as opposed to the kind that are closer to a thick, flavorful egg noodle, folded like a fortune cookie. They skimped on the soup contents, and I'm not sure why a wonton soup for one person is considered a half an order. What is this, Carmine's?  

Menu was lacking some things we all like to see. If you google ""Chinese food menu"" you will not see anything similar to what they have here, that's a takeout style menu. However, some things I like to see in authentic cuisine were missing, as in ""braised pork shoulder.""  

Ever go to a foreign country and try a McDonalds and things just aren't ""right?""  A comparable feeling at this place. 
Some pleasantries were missing: tea automatically brought to table, crispy noodles with duck sauce,etc. However, I asked for noodles for my soup and got a crispy noodle style I had never experienced. It was really tasty. 

They were friendly to my child, but I'll never visit again.",hzaGLORUDi4n5LTssbXmKg,1,1,1,wbeC0r3a-Y3pJ_DX09a6Vw

We ordered egg rolls, shrimp in lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken & chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, nothing to write home about which is sometimes a good thing. The shrimp in lobster sauce was a little more soupy than we expected, but it was a new dish to us so it was worth a try. The sweet & sour chicken, though, was AMAZING. I have NEVER had such tender chicken in my life. I seriously asked the waiter if this was really chicken. He laughed & said yes. I was completely blown away by how delicious this dish was. For that matter alone, I would go and will go back again.

The two items that stood out for me was the roasted duck and tripe. The roasted duck has the perfect crispiness to it accompanied with the perfect amount of fat. Every piece was greaZy and flavorful.

All Day Dim Sum

Justin Bieber Deported

US Men's National Team Advances to Quarterfinals of World Cup


Yes, all things that upon seeing we instantly know are too good to be true, except Orchids in Vegas actually does serve dim sum ALL DAY*

Granted, the mere act of eating dim sum during off hours doesn't make it taste any better. Orchids Garden is in the garden-variety 3 star quality level. Nevertheless, it's dim sum at night, I can't complain!

This is normally the part where I would tell you the har gow is superior to their disappointing sui mai, and that there was a lack of consistency on warmth levels on a few dishes, but like I said, I'm not gonna complain. Egg rolls were conspicuous by their absence, but the fried crab and fried wontons made up for it. The baked sweet cream bun was a pleasant surprise. A variety of BBQ pork options were available. Prices were also quite reasonable.

I assumed going in that the dinner menu would be limited and service would be minimal. But let your heart not be troubled, the carts come out at night, pass by often, drink refills are frequent, and you can order non dim sum dishes off the dinner menu.


*it's not actually ALL DAY, just all hours they're open, so not like at 4 in the morning",fG-K5NglgWxHg8PNu62afg,12,11,3,NHFORKQoz5EWMMyfRtGgqQ

It served Dim Sum all day. But as expected, the dim sums after the rush hour, i.e. at night, was awful. During lunch hours when the foods were fresh, and abundant. The variety has been standard. Nothing too surprising. Lots of fried foods for American.

The price, as in all Las Vegas, was higher for what it's worth. For 2 people the last time we ate there, it's $30 for 10 items. Egg tarts are medium price (all places I've been to charged low price). The chow mien was a bit bland. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was very tender on the stalk.

So diners, it's good to have dim sum here during busy hour. For tourists, it's Las Vegas. Get used to it.",P-CRYltpvp4aABRctIZWtg,0,0,3,u9x589gSFjhUAWKzHmghOA

I like the turnip cake that is made with shredded daikon radish and mixed with rice flour and flavored with ham, sausage, shrimp, or other vegetables before being pressed into cakes just melts in your mouth.

And the rice balls-stretchy, chewy texture like Japanese mochi which is essentially identical.They get coated with sesame seeds and deep-fried until they are puffed up and are then piped with a sweet red bean paste.

I really come here for their variety of dim sum. 
Several ladies push around carts of steaming dumplings to small plates of vegetables and shumai to name a few. My favorites are the har gow, steamed greens and shrimp pops. There is also desserts available distinguished with sweet glazes and sweet sticky rice cakes. 

My preferences are very simple...house pan fried noodles loaded with bok choy, mushrooms, greens and chicken, salty pork chops that compliment either steamed white rice or combination fried rice and pretty much any steamed vegetable.  So yummy you won't even feel like you over did it as expected when eating Chinese food.  The complementary oolong tea is a nice drink during the meal as well as a great finisher. 

Also, their Thai iced tea is large, tall and flavorful not watered down with too much ice. It goes great with just about everything they serve. 

One thing is for sure, the prices are reasonable and it's big enough to accomadate a large head count.

3720793,2015-12-29,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"TL;DR - Below average dimsum + Chinese restaurant in Vegas. Frozen, not fresh. Decent place to fill your dimsum craving, but you'll find better places around for a similar value.

So subpar. Dimsum of this quality would never fly in the Bay Area.

Today was surprisingly busy, but the wait wasn't long. 20 minutes for a table of 5 to be seated.

We ordered the basic dimsum - xiu mai, hargao, and shrimp noodle rolls. The xiu mai was a bit smaller than I was used to back in the Bay, but that didn't bother me much. Flavor was there; not impressive, but also didn't disappoint. But it didn't taste fresh...it looked frozen.

Hargao was also a little bit smaller than what I was used to. Flavor was actually subpar, as I tasted nothing. Also looked frozen, not fresh.

Shrimp noodle rolls were a huge disappointment. No flavor in the rolls, despite it being soaked in the soy sauce. Why is that? It's because the SHRIMP was so damn small! This is a sure sign that food in the kitchen is frozen, not fresh.

We also ordered other dimsum dishes, such as shrimp with eggplant, chicken feet, fried crab balls, fried meat balls, and steamed buns. In addition, hot and sour soup and honey walnut shrimp was ordered.

The shrimp with eggplant was actually decent. There was some flavor in the shrimp, but the eggplant elevated the dish just a little more.

Chicken feet was also decent. The sauce it was tossed / coated in was flavorful, but chicken was average; a bit dry and looked overcooked.

Fried crab balls had a lot of flavor in them, and the crab claw embedded in the ball elevated the presentation.

Fried meat balls were average - 95% batter and 5% actual meat filling. I wouldn't suggest getting this st any dimsum place ANYWHERE, as it is just too greasy and lacks a bunch of flavor.

The steamed bun I ordered was actually a Chinese sausage bun. Some flavor was present, but the sausage itself was so dry that it shouldn't be considered a sausage anymore. It's jerky.

The hot and sour soup was your standard hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant. Packed spice for sure, but flavor itself was average.

The honey walnut shrimp came to me as a pleasant surprise to me. Each puny shrimp was battered, deep-fried, then tossed in a bath of mayo. This is VERY different from honey walnut shrimp I'm used to in the Bay (large shrimp tossed in a lighter bath of mayo, and thank god it's not battered and deep-fried). Flavor was very much absent due to the batter, but mayo made up for some of what was missing. Walnuts were average, with a standard crunch.

Chinese broccoli with XO sauce was subpar. Completely soaked in sesame oil, which meant I missed out on the freshness of the vegetables. I didn't have any sauce, so I can't speak much on that. 

Service, for a lack of a better word, was slow and from what I observed, actually crappy. Rude hostess at the front killed the vibe I had for this restaurant. $110 for 5 people, from what we ordered, so it's not AS economically-friendly, but it's a better value than the places on the Strip.",cv5t03qvJkvdRYqh418qIg,0,0,2,VlKaq4_IKi-Tt6L-zQ6MXw

The shrimp dishes we tried were all great, and I really liked the dumplings. The service was also very friendly, and they were nice to explain what each dish was, for the most part.  

For a nice experience with Dim Sum off the Strip, give this place a try. Really, try it. Not just saying that. :)",9kIcMeveJXxWGVOVdXyQyg,2,1,4,dErsSF34zVDxQt7U4VkYLw

Lots of other dim sum restaurants usually only have carts at lunch then switch to a menu of entrees plus some select dim sum items at dinner. I appreciate that Orchids ALWAYS has carts going, especially when you have a dim sum dinner craving. I probably first came here around eight years ago, but I eat here every other month or so and they're very consistent. Dim sum here is good, affordable, and convenient. You could manage a quick lunch here if you work nearby. Service is typically great when I come here and the hostess is always nice. 

Lots of parking available right outside the restaurant. Also kind of random, but as a huge Final Fantasy fan I have to mention that they sometimes play orchestral versions of classic FF soundtracks from the games.

I don't know if its fair to compare this place to any Dim Sum spots that I've been to in a Chinatown in SF or LA. But I've tasted better, and I will. Honestly, the Dim Sum wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I walked in and it definitely looked and smelled like the usual Chinese restaurant but the food definitely didn't taste like one. The breaded shrimp balls were of usual size but it came with only two pieces. I don't think I've ever been to a Dim Sum spot where they only serve you two pieces of anything, its usually 4. This has to be bad Feng Shui. Like I brought up earlier, they were also serving the smallest shumai that I've EVER seen. The pork buns were delicious due to the fluffy white bread with glaze on top, but there was hardly any pork, they should just call it BUN! I know we are in a recession, but geez, don't make it so obvious! 

Its a bit far from the strip and the prices are decent. With the size of their dishes it better be affordable. This is the only Dim Sum place that I've tried in LV and I know all the other ones are a bit more pricey, so this may be a good spot for locals but not if you've been to any Chinatown before. I would only comeback if friends decide to comeback, otherwise I would pass.

The only positive is that we were able to sit 24 people instantly. Which is A-OK in my book!",pUmTc6CSKsQMbHgk4ZWvIQ,0,0,3,jC-Yn8u0wUiuyiNdqu6SDA

3871844,2016-07-21,0,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Dim sum available all day is their ad which makes me somewhat apprehensive on such a claim.  I didn't try going there in the evening for their dim sum, but during lunch hours.  Pay attention as you walk in, look for their day's specials.  There were two boards listing different specials.  One of the offered steamed or crispy flounder USD 20.95, which caught my attention for a steamed flounder.  Order this first from a waitress, as it takes maybe twenty minutes before it arrives.

Meantime, select dim sum plates as the rolling carts roll by, select one or two at time, finish those before adding more, else it's real easy to order more than you may comfortably eat.  Tea is complimentary here and is decent quality tea without a head charge for tea per person as some dim sum houses do.

Advise to not select starchy dishes (I.e. buns, noodles) as that tends to fill you, leaving less room for more dim sum plates.  Grab the dim sum prior to sitting at at table if you're concerned with their dim sum pricing which are broken down six groups, getting the dim sum menu demystifies this.

The steamed flounder turned out delicious.  Don't be shy about defining the whole flounder.  It's easy, or ask the waitress to define it for you.  Use the large tablespoon, insert into either the head or tail so bottom of the spoon comes in contact with the top of the fish bone structure and the top of the spoon contacts the bottom of the fish flesh, separating the flesh from the bone structure, carefully sliding the spoon from one end of the fish to the other end.  Save the sauce served on the fish, take it home in a sealed container for liquids or come with a quart sized sealable plastic baggie.  It goes well poured over steamed rice, much better than soy sauce, in my humbled opinion.

Dim sum personal favorites:  pan fried daikon cake A USD 2.25; steamed pork spareribs B USD 3; pan fried chive dumpling B USD 3; bean curd skin sheet roll B USD 3; baked egg tart B USD 3; pork siu mai B USD 3; shrimp har gow (has a nice thin translucent skin) B USD 3; shrimp paste in bell pepper B USD 3; shark fin dumpling B USD 3; sticky rice in lotus leaf C USD 4.1; deep fried taro C USD 4.1; salt and pepper calamari E USD 6.1.

Items that I wouldn't recommend here:  mango pudding B USD 3 tasted totally artificial with a gelatin consultancy and request milk added.  I've tasted better elsewhere.  Roast duck, didn't try try it, looked not very good.  Prices may change, credit cards accepted.

We saw custard tarts rolled by multiple times, but by the time I decided to order a plate, they were finished for the day on that dish which was around 1430 hours.  So if they out of that one dish, what else would they be out of by the time they close at 2230 hours?

4014605,2013-08-20,2,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"For good dim sum in Las Vegas, you probably won't find a much better place than Orchids Garden.  Because of their all day dim sum dining, the place is steadily busy!

We finally decided to try Orchids Garden because we kept hearing about it.  There are a ton of places on Spring Mountain that cater to the dim sum crowd but Orchids Garden off of Sahara kept coming up.  Off to dim sum we go!

The lady and I went on a Saturday for lunch time and it was no joke, the restaurant was full!  There were people shouting and whistling as carts full of wonderful dim sum were whizzing around the dining area.  There was steam and foul-sounding 
Chinese language everywhere!  Definitely nice to see the hustle and bustle.  Gotta get your dim sum order in before the cart runs out and you have to wait!

After being seated we were given a regular restaurant menu and the dim sum menu.  It was a nice touch, prices were given in categories, and pictures were used for the various dim sum to make it easier for patrons who are not familiar with the art of dumplings.  I've watched dim sum making before, and damn, it truly is an art because you gotta be patient and be able to put out quality dim sum in almost no time flat.  Oh my aching hands!

Orchids Garden dim sum is fairly priced.  Still a bit more than dim sum from places like Cali, but not bad for Vegas standards.  All dim sum dishes range from around $2 - $6 area, and there is something for just about everyone.  Me?  I love sticking to the cheap, cheap, cheap end of the dim sum spectrum.  I think all dim sum should be cheap!  It's supposed to be akin to street food!  Who the heck wants to pay $6 for friggin' Chinese broccoli?  I don't.  Some of our faves:

-Steamed chicken feet (love it)
-Steamed BBQ pork bun
-Pan fried daikon cake
-Baked BBQ pork bun (yummy)
-Shrimp har gow
-Pan fried chives dumpling (chive-y)
-Beef in rice noodle
-Mushroom shiu mai

The chicken feet here are fantastic!  Sticky, fatty, and delicious with a bowl of hot white rice.  We employ multiple orders of this whenever we go.  I am also a big fan of the chives dumpling since I am an onion lover.  Each of the dim sum above is in the $2 - $4 range for each serving.  Not too cheap but not so expensive it breaks the bank.  I've had better dim sum in other places but I think for Las Vegas it is pretty good.  Not to mention, dim sum all day?  It appeals to a lot of (drunk @$$)people here.  

I've seen the restaurant menu but have yet to try anything off of it.  But it does have a massive amount of choices which is good.  But for now, dim sum me up...baby!

Verdict?  Orchids Garden is a good spot for some decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim sum comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK, although some folks say the service can be a bit rude.  But then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  So the next time you have a dim sum craving and can't decide where to go, give Orchids Garden a try.

Sometimes when I am on my way to the movies I love popping in & grabbing a few dumplings & satisfying my tummy. It's quick and you never have to wait long for your food. 

My fave items I always get are: pork shiu mai, shark fin dumplings, sticky rice in lotus leaves, pan fried chive dumplings ( the best ever ) and baked bbq pork buns that are so heavenly,  with the perfect combo of sweet, salty, sticky, it's like heavenly crack!

Dim sum is served in carts. There are ladies pushing around carts of different types of dimsum. There is a steamed cart, fried cart, starch cart, sweets, and buns. 

You get a card and the things on each cart have a different price depending on the cart. When you get an item, the lady will put a stamp on your card. They add up the stamps and that is your food cost.

Be careful grabbing too much. The items have between 1-4 and cost over $2-$6 each, so that quickly adds up. They also have a normal menu.

I've been eating dim sum since I was a good and all of their dishes are good.

Nothing is necessarily great, but definitely good.

I would say definitely try to go during peak hours because the food is more fresh.

Most of the items are different forms of dumplings. 

They also have fried shrimp, Chinese broccoli, and other things aside from the dumings.

Try the fried stuff. Try the stuff with chili sauce, try the stuff with their mayo.

The cashier girl is super rude. She never says hi, thank you, or smiles.

Visited Vegas for independence weekend (2017) and after consuming buffets after buffets, the hubby and I wanted to venture outside of the strip. Found this little gem on yelp and decided to give it a try! We are avid dim sum eaters and seem to draw interest in trying a new place every time we travel outta town. 

From the exterior, this place is nothing special. Typical mom and pop restaurant that's stuck in ancient Asian decor. We were pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was and was seated right away. The manager (we think that's who it was) took our drink order and carts of food just started rolling our way. 

Let me tell you, everything was DELISH. We had 2 orders of shrimp/crab fried balls, 1 order of shrimp hakkou(?), 1 order of chicken feet, 2 orders of rolled pan fried noodles, 1 order of Chinese broccoli, 1 order for pork bbq buns, 1 order of egg custard cupcakes, 1 order of steamed cream buns and 1 order shrimp rice noodles. Our tab was just under $60. Not bad as we walked away with our bellies full and a great experience.

This is authentic Chinese Dim Sum and Dim Sum service if you do not know what you want by the looks of it you will not get much help from the cart ladies they are polite but curt and will just start handing you things.  I know that is a bit of an oxymoron but most who go here will understand.  Please do not let this deter you from enjoying the goodies they serve in their little tins of goodness.   I know what I want by looks and name so that is extremely helpful in these kind of situations! 

My thoughts on a restaurant of any ethnicity is seeing who eats there, if you see many people from the ethnicity of food you looking for you are usually on the right track this place in that aspect does not lie.  It seems as of late the word has gotten out because there are more and more people from other ethnicities visiting here they now just bring a fork instead of having to ask for one (I do not ever need one though but I know some of my friends and visitors do)  I also noticed a lot more smiles from the cart ladies as of late as well!  LOL I kinda like the grumpy, curt all about the food service of the past a bit.  However the food does not lie I do enjoy the Dim Sum and will continue to come back on a regular basis.

I have never even looked at the menu so I have no idea what else they have but who cares really its Dim Sum all day!

The shrimp was juicy and had that authentic snappiness to it, everything was well cooked and not unnecessarily greasy (as Chinese food inherently is...) The egg custards were so good we ordered a second round of them instead of trying something else, they're pretty much flan in a pie shell.

Everything is pretty reasonably priced - a huge dinner for 3 only ran us 50$ with drinks - and the menu on their site does have correct prices even though the first page says it's out of date. The few things we wanted that weren't visible on the carts when they came by (roast duck and mango pudding), all we had to do was ask the cart pusher lady  and she came back swiftly with them. 

Caveat: There is definitely a slight language barrier and a big cultural barrier here. The lower reviews that I saw claim the service is bad, the staff is unfriendly, etc but those people are too ethnocentric to even fathom that service has different meanings in different cultures. Yes, by American sugar-sweet service standards they are brusque and short and strictly businesslike but this place is MUCH more friendly and 'Americanized' service-wise than most more-authentic Chinese places I've been to. Anyone who feels they were treated rudely probably just can't fathom that anything that isn't bowing at their feet is directly attacking them.

Orchids Garden is Located on the Corner of Sahara and Lindell. They do have a Parking Lot that is also used with the Other Businesses in the Area. They have Restrooms located on the Right of the Entrance, and to the Left is the Restaurant. You Have to Wait to be Seated by the Cashier, * Just a Note: You May have to Wait a While, Depending on How Busy they are.

Once Seated, You will be Greeted by your Waitress, She will leave an Order Tab at your Table which will be used for when you start to order from the Carts that come around. * Get the Hot Green Tea, it's Delish!

You will Notice Servers pushing Carts around the Restaurant, that's where you Start Your Meal! It is Dim Sum, so don't expect Rice, Unless you Order it! The Dim Sum Selection is a Little Limited, and it Varies from Time to Time..You can Also Order ""Family Style"" just ask for a Menu!

When Ordering Dim Sum, the Order Tab will be Stamped by the Servers, and You get your Dim Sum, Hot & Ready! Depending on what you Order, it is usually 3-4 Pieces, Per Dim Sum. My faves are the BBQ Pork Bun, Pork Hash, And a Shrimp Dish with Spinach & Watercress, Wrapped & Steamed (looks like a Bigger version of the Pork Hash). Sorry, I don't know the Name of it...lol!

Look, I've never been to Chang's.  I've heard it's pretty good too...  but shoot, this place is pretty good.  It'll stand up decently too in San Francisco, where I'm from.  It won't be the best place -- but it'll be a place I'd frequent regularly for the quality and value of the food.

Why, you say?  Cuz their baked goods are, well, GOOD!  Try, for examples, the miniature baked BBQ pork in a buttery, flaky pastry.  Love it!  The miniature egg custard.  Well done!  The crust is good...  the custard... well, they could use a little more egg whites.  But in any case, their baked goods are excellent!

Har gow, Shumai, Lo mai kai, fried shrimp dumpling, chicken feet, cheung fun (you know, the regulars), these all are pretty good.  I stuffed myself with 5 plates and it cost me $12.50 + tips.

One last thing...  I haven't tried Chang's yet -- I'm going to.   But as far as I'm concerned, Orchid Garden is as authentic as it's going to get in LV.

""The options for Dim Sum are limted in Las Vegas"".  This as good as you are going to find for Dim Sum in Las Vegas. 

Unlike Cathy House, and other Chinese establishments in Las Vegas, the Dim Sum is prepared throughout the day, so you will get fresh, and not reheated, Dim Sum when the carts come around.

I always do the Dim Sum. My wife used to order Chinese entrees, until she finally realized they were not that good, and switched back to Dim Sum. 

The place is large, and at lunch time, very loud. Dinner is a little less hectic.

Service is on the slow side. In the Asian tradition, don't be affraid to raise your voice to get service at your table, or they may ignore you. 

They don't expect much of a tip, and don't appreciate a generous tip. Many of the Chinese patrons dont' tip; it's a cultural thing. 

If you are on a date, and want to impress someone with your knowledge for ""off the strip"" or ""local"" places, or simply to introduce some one to Dim Sum, this is a decent bet.

If you are thinking of impressing someone with atmosphere, and deep conversation, go to Tao, a Rich Man's PF Chang's.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,1,1,4,C6nmyTvccaFs28aPdGLRtA

We hadn't been here in a long while. Seems to have caught on with many other people, as the clientelle today was a huge mix of people: Asians of all types, Hawaiians, and Caucasians. Don't even come here on a holiday weekend as you will wait for about 30-45 minutes (we did that once- we won't make that mistake again).

It's still yummy! We had the chinese broccoli (steamed just right), sio mai, shrimp balls (mmm, another favorite), shrimp on the sugar cane (one of my hubby's favorites), pork buns (another hubby's favorite), egg tarts (one of my favorites, but then I saw the sesame balls... darn), and rice cakes (love this!). I had the hot tea (good stuff, so fragrant) while he had water. We didn't finish everything- we had leftovers. Less than $26.00 plus tip. Maybe next time we won't wait so long, to come again.  (BTW, there's way more other dishes (noodles, chicken feet, tripe, rice, wide noodles with shrimp, soup, etc.) that they have- the ones that we get, just happens to be our favorites.) 

The service is very good. We were seated right away, maybe because were just a party of two. The server brought us drinks right away (and refills too). Although, very busy, the servers are pretty quick, pushing the heavy food-filled carts to every table in the restaurant. Some of them speak english, some do not. If you're not clear (repeat yourself) you might get another dish by mistake. They stamp your card accordingly after you make your selections. When you have empty plates or containers on your table, someone comes over and grabs them. 

There are two sections to the restaurant. A bathroom is located in the lobby. There are TVs all around, but because there are so many diners, you only just see the screens and can't hear them. But that's ok, because you're in the company of good eats! 

This place has been around for years; the name might have changed a few times, but the food is still top notch. Definitely still The place for Dim Sum. I'm getting the sesame balls next time instead of the egg tarts.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,3,5,kQcaeNY0glwGjuZsBxGUog

The service is prompt, the food is delicious, and it's just plain dim sum yumminess. 

Upon sitting down, the carts are at your table. There's no time to waste on Dim Sum Sunday! They clean your tables pretty fast too, but don't let them rush you. Enjoy it.

Most places use a lot of sesame oil in their dim sum items, not Orchid Garden. You leave satisfied... full.... but not wanting to sit in stretchy pants.

Their pork buns (the ones in my picture) are lightly brushed with honey. The bun is fluffy and the pork isn't too ""saucy"". The mushroom shu mai is my favorite over the regular shu mai. It actually tastes like there is meat inside. If you're a fan of eggplant, try the fried eggplant (seen in my picture).  I'm not a huge fan, but even I loved this tasty morsel. The red bean sesame rolls are unreal - crunchy outside, steamy chewy inside, and the slightly sweet bite of red bean in the middle. The seaweed salad is meh.

I have to say the staff has always been a tad rude, but since we really like Dim Sum we kept going. Today we went and there were 9 of us. My husband and I sat together, and our 17 year old daughter and her six out of town girlfriends sat together. After we finished we walked over to the girl's table and told them we were going to go start the cars. I was standing by the table trying to stay out of one of the woman's way who had a cart. Out of nowhere she literally yelled at me to move. I was a bit put off and said it really wasn't necessary to yell and we went outside. 
Ten mins later the girl's came out to the car and our daughter said she was yelled at when they paid. They paid with cash and the woman who took the money came back to the table and sat down their change- approximately $2-$3. They told her to keep it as a tip. Granted, it wasn't a big tip, but they are young girl's and frankly tipping isn't a requirement. She started scolding them and yelling how they needed to pay 10% tip - she called them imbeciles over and over. They are young girl's and should not have been intimated into leaving a larger tip, and definitely not called imbeciles. What type of restaurant employee calls their customer an imbecile?
Our oldest daughter is a server and we get the importance of tipping. However, it's up to the customer on what to tip ( and here there isn't much service) . I didn't see anywhere here that a tip is ""required"". I can tell you our daughter would NEVER yell at a customer for not tipping. 
I thought about going back in to complain or call, but know it would have been pointless as the one who yelled at them appears to be the manager. So, instead I leave my review and let people decide.

Here's my tip:
You need a battle plan. The prime time to visit is 10:30 AM. This is when 90% of the time the food is hot. The crowd has yet to form. If you miss this time try your best to sit in the room in the east (left room from entrance). This is where the carts come out and you're most likely to get the hottest items.

4510005,2009-04-16,8,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Dim Sum is a traditional Chinese cuisine in which small portions of a variety of foods, including an assortment of steamed or fried dumplings, are served in succession.  

Easter Sunday and it was my cousin Manny, my mother and I eating out for lunch.  Usually Easter is dominated by hotels, casinos offering the standard higher priced brunch  However, we decided on Dim Sum (not a tradition) but I was willing to try it because it will please my mother and I am the one visiting Vegas.  

The place itself is in northwest of the strip on Sahara and was not really far from where my mom and Manny lived (if there was no traffic) we got there in plenty of time to get a number and wait.  The proportion of Chinese speaking patrons were probably  90 to 1 to non Chinese.  The newspapers outside the lobby was chinese, all the writing on the menu board is chinese..  The good thing about dim sum is point and taste.  If you picked something you didn't like then you are fine to eat something else.

So steamed or fried.  Most of the items we did get were steamed (not as in angry) but were in a metal or wood container, it's like lunch a la carte but they move the food around and ask you if you want something (sometimes the same thing several times).  Of course if you like it, then you can get more of the same.  

We picked a range of food from simple short ribs, pork roast, pork and shrimp dumplings.  But Manny my cousin was apt for the challenge, he said I like chicken feet so we ordered it.  In all my experiences in eating Chinese or Asian food, chicken feet has never touched this lips.  However convinced by my cousin to try this slightly battered (coating not beat up) chicken feet.  I tried it, it was not as bad as I thought.  It was gelatinous and easy to eat and spit.  Now I can say I ate chicken feet but would I try it again, maybe next time when its deep fried and I have had several beers.

Overally service was hectic but good.  The only caveat is the long wait for the check to be completed.  We thought they would rush us out but because the restaurant had slowed down since we came in, the new customers were getting the attention, we were just waiting.  Always drink tea when you are eating dim sum, it helps with the greasy food you are ingesting.  Oh, we did eat chinese broccoli, the designated vegetable.  We also had some smelt, my mom' s favorite (not crunchy or seasoned enough for me)

The ultimate surprise which I always try to look for dim sum is the tofu.  This is not the tofu you buy in the supermarket, this is one is silky and warm and with a little syrup and was delicious - taho in the Philippines.

Overall, for the clientele who believe this is good enough for them and good enough for us.  It cost us about 60 bucks which is 20 per person (no I didn't make my Mom pay - Manny and I split it)..  I had a good and new experience in Las Vegas away from the strip and the namebrand chef cuisine.",MAatw6IQHYCqeATbHHMz1w,11,10,4,1D8HeSrbCoJdAhvZ53BnWw

They did mention Orchids Garden as a close alternative. So lunch time hits and here I am. The staff was friendly I was seated right away and the carts immediately came to my table. I tried the same dishes as Chang's which were shiu mai, har gow and rice noodle rolls with shrimp. I also tried the fried shrimp ball with fried sugar cane sticks  which I did not see on Chang's menu. The shiu mai was fresh and delicious, very comparable to places back home as was the har gow. The rice noodle rolls were equally tasty and slightly better than back home. We have a different version of the sugar cane shrimp roll back home that has a crab leg in place of the fried sugar cane stick. The shrimp used in this item had a great flavor and the texture to the shrimp ball was perfect. 5 stars and this is definitely going to be my regular dim sum spot!!!",7E7dzrDRZHVvigx94OrL2w,2,1,5,3TP2I8KY-jsSSmUxq88AGQ

Fruit custard tarts: pretty average, didn't feel freshly made. I would stick to the main dishes which dim sum places excel at. 
A variety of dumplings (we tried the fried pork and chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns, pan-fried pork dumplings, and glutinous rice footballs with meat): all of the dumplings were good and satisfied the grease and meat craving that we all had after a Friday night out. My favorite was the glutinous rice footballs, which are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and contains a bit of pork meat on the inside as well.
Chinese broccoli with seafood sauce: quite good. It was nice to have a purely vegetable dish, but the veggies were coated in oil so I'm not sure how much healthier they are. 
Siu mai: delicious!
Xiao long bao: on the small side and not filled with much delicious broth. I've definitely had much better XLB elsewhere. 
Zhong zi: quite good, but again not filled with as much meat and goodies as I have had elsewhere.

Overall service was fast and efficient, and the value was great ($63 to feed 6 of us, so only about $10 a person for everyone to be pleasantly satisfied but not uncomfortably full).

Finally, they didn't have the dessert that our group was hoping for. Instead, we just got a plate of oranges.

My family and I went on Sunday for an early dinner and unlike dumplings which were usually served during tea time a.k.a. 'Yum Tsa' back in Hong Kong, this place served them all day and all night! We ordered the crab balls, siu mai, egg tarts and from the menu, house special pan fried noodles as well as chicken fried rice. 

Once they arrived, we stared at our plates as the food glistened in all that oil! No doubt it tasted pretttttttty good! The crab balls went perfectly with the fried rice and the egg tarts were a great way to end the night. With a cute serving of 3, my parents and I had one each!

Very poor customer service and high noise level. Orchids Gardens have both. They will come around and force their food on you. Every cart claims to  have the best food.

4702524,2015-08-07,1,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"I've been here twice during the day and twice at night. I definitely prefer dining during the day since the restaurant is much busier, so the food is fresh and there's a better selection. Unfortunately, I get a hankering for dim sum and we can only visit for dinner. I'm sure it's fine during dinner if it's busy, but I seem to keep missing the crowd. During our last dinner visit, the dim sum was cold and had obviously been out for some time. I didn't mind terribly, but I would hate to have that situation again.

What continues to draw me back here is the service. It's much, much better than service I've received at other dim sum establishments. I'm not ignored and the carts visit often. Also, they're very accommodating when I ask for a dish and it's not available on the carts. They even inform you of how long it'll be for the dish to come out.

The food is all right. It's not the best dim sum I've had, but most of the dishes are decent and still hits the spot when I'm really craving it.

Group D ($6.25)
Chinese Broccoli 
Pan Fried XO Noodle

I like the Pan Fried Daikon Cake, Deep Fried Meat Ball, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed Pork Shiu Mai, Shrimp Har Gow, Bean Curd Skin Roll, Fried Shrimp Puff, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Beef Rice Noodle, and Pan Fried XO Noodle.

I don't mind their other dumplings, but they're just okay. Not the best skin, but good fillings. Daikon (Turnip) Cake is one of my favorite dim sum and although I'll still eat theirs, it's doesn't have the best texture and it's slightly mushy. I like the flavor of their Pork Spareribs, but there is so, so much fat in relation to how much actual meat is available. I also don't like their Steamed BBQ Pork Bun as it's really dry. Stick to their baked version if you want Char Siu Bao. The only dish that I really don't care for is the Steamed Beef Ball; it's such a weird texture. 

We spent a little over $50 for two people (including tax and tip). You tend to spend less money with groups of 3-4 since you're sharing more and tend to get less food overall. Also, most plates come with 3-4 pieces.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,8,2,3,wyxHGLH8y2YL22wc2nHozA

dim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..

Only table who did the family style order got their food as their order.

Forever food:
Pork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing. 

Ordering:
Try to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant

Sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting. Recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu. We never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the ""complainers"". It's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside.  Thank goodness my mom knows her math, cuz I just pay a bill when I get it. Well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it. When we forced them to re-add, they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing. They corrected the amount, put it on the table and walked away. We definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go, keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill.

- Steamed beef ribs

The food per se was pretty tasty. I wish there were more sauces to dip the dim sum in but I was only given soy sauce. I also wish the plates we finishes were cleared from the table faster since we had stacks of plates in the middle.

The carts started to roll our way and it had most of the stuff we were wanting to eat so that was a plus.

The har gaw was slightly above average (compared to the rest of Vegas) and the soy sheet rolls weren't bad at all. My fave was the fact that they had 'ma lai go' and it was the authentic kind -- tan brown in color rather than sponge cake yellow.

Like what the other reviewers have mentioned it's dirty and the bathrooms are filthy.

We arrived a little after 10:30 and by the time we left (before noon), the place was pretty packed.  They did a good job at pushing carts around to every table and stocking up whenever they ran out.

True to nature, he wanted Chinese food for lunch, specifically dim sum. There was a restaurant that they had eaten at four years ago and ""the people were really nice"" and ""the food really good"" but ""I can't remember the name of it"", something with the name Orchid in it.

No problem said Son #1 (that's me). I'll just punch in Orchid in Las Vegas, Nv and see what Yelp comes up with. Oh, could it be Orchids Garden Chinese Restaurant? Yes? No? Maybe? Look, here are some pictures to look at. Oh? That's the one. Terrific!

Naturally, when I pulled into the parking lot, the voice from the back seat goes, ""where are we? We've never been here before!"" Argggghhhhhhhhhhh!!!

So we bravely trooped into the restaurant anyway. We were greeted and seated relatively quickly. I ordered the type of tea that I like (Gook Bo, which is a blend of Gook Fah and Bo Li). It was actually pretty decent. The steam carts came around as well as women carrying small trays of food. Pretty much, a typical dim sum scene.

We don't recall seeing anything ""new"" or ""unusual"". Mostly the standard fare. We did notice that the portions were smaller than we were used to seeing. Flavors were okay but nothing really stood out. We had all the ""standards"" except we didn't order any buns.

Har gow (shrimp dumpling), shui mai  (pork & shrimp dumpling), pi gwat (pork spare ribs), fung jow (chicken feet), naw mei fan (sticky rice tamale), ngow een (beef meatball), hom sui gok (deep fried meat dumpling) and many more.

Service was okay but I think we confused the servers as we always tend to. They look at the parents and start to speak Cantonese and then they look at me and my wife and switch to English or Chinglish depending on their proficiency.

I'd say that if you're in Vegas and must have dim sum, you could do worse but don't expect the same quality that you'd find in Alhambra, Montereay Park or San Francisco.",FV8qKMVjuufEf4ys9MxIkA,1,1,3,AN0w4F5T__DKMTOMAH9zbg

Overall, I thought the dim sum was just ok.  I've had much better in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Actually, I think that the dim sum at Chang's (Vegas) is better too.  

Price is about the same as Chang's.  Portions seemed to be slightly smaller.  However, the service at Orchids is much better than Chang's.  When you ask for something at Orchids, it comes right away.  Whereas, we have waited 15 minutes for our check at Chang's.  I just wish the dim sum was better at Orchids in both the size and taste.

4975605,2006-12-14,3,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"On the quest to find decent dim sum in the desert, Orchids Garden was my next try.  They get major points for constantly having carts of food roll by.  The only problem was that the selection was to the minimum.  I would get all excited every time I see a cart, only to discover each lady had the same exact thing as the lady before her.  Bummer.  

I give them major points for having Shanghai dumplings.  However, they were horrendous!  The skin was unusually thick and you'll never find me ordering that here again.  They also had the very special Shark Fin Dumpling Soup (Goon Tong Gow,  to fill with liquid, soup, dumpling) that you have to special order.  It comes with red vinegar and ginger slices for you to dump into the soup.  Yes, major props for having it, but it didn't taste that great either.  And instead of shark fin, they had glass noodles instead!

Their standard shrimp dumplings and pork dumplings were decent.  Their chicken feet in black bean sauce was flavorful.  Their bean curd wrapped seafood thing was okay, some of it over steamed though.  The Chinese broccoli was slippery as heck and the shrimp rice noodle was decent too.

The tricky thing was that as we hung out after we paid our bill, we noticed different stuff coming out!  I saw the Pineapple Bun and inquired if there was yellow egg custard in it, and the lady confirmed there was!  Since discovering this yummy bun only recently, I had to get some.  And it was oh so good, and piping hot too!  (It's the marriage of the Bolo Bao and the Nai Wong Bao!)  

I only had the small egg custard tarts and this other fruit tart that I wouldn't usually see in a dim sum restaurant for dessert.  They did have the soft tofu, but the lady scooping it caught too much water in there, drowning out the syrupy taste.

Overall, Orchids Garden was a decent place for dim sum on a Saturday morning.  It's a huge place with lots of Chinese (ethnic Chinese, as I could hear Cantonese being spoken everywhere) and non-Chinese customers dining here.  I like that you can see non-Chinese families dining here as it can often be intimidating at these huge dim sum operations.  

And the prices were pretty decent too. With a party of four, it came out to about $65 total, and we definitely stuffed ourselves pretty good too.

Until I find another place better, you'll find me here again.  The wait was minimal too. And there's parking in the back as well!

Update: 01/03/07 - I've been back twice already since this review!  And it's not because the food is so fabulous, but I have yet to find a better one.  You can easily fit 14 people at a table with minimal wait too!  And their Pineapple Egg Custard buns are so worthy waiting for!  Get them while they are hot and take them all if you can!  They are THAT good.

Update: 11/05/07 - Went back yesterday for dim sum.  Their chicken's feet was pretty good, and the deep fried calamari was a surprise hit too.  The BF really like the roasted pork that came with pickled veggies.  Their chive and shrimp dumpling is good when it's hot, and thank goodness the Shanghai dumplings never came out since I forgot our bad experience with it the first time!  The pineapple egg custard bun was present, but not quite as good when it's not piping hot.  So, only get it when it's hot hot hot!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,8,4,3,aU3RP30FNJmzdi1e-Ksa-g

Or Gung Hee Fat Chow, depending on your dialect.  

The outside of the building transport you to an authentic city in China.  Chinese lettering and a huge sign that read, ""Dim Sum all day"" really brought us in.  The carpet is definitely outdated, older tables as well.  Adding yellow lining lights on the ceiling and you're now transported to 1960's China.  Definitely needs a revitalization.  The staff is cordial.  Definitely not as pushy to sell you more Dim Sum as I've experienced in other cities.  They also explain the dishes thoroughly in English so you know what you're getting.  Here's what we got:

Chow Mein - probably like 4 plates altogether.  A little oily but so good.  Small crispy noodles with grilled onions.  

Fried Shrimp Puff - Got 3 plates of this in all.  Crispy gyoza like dumplings filled with shrimp.  Super yummy!  Served with a dollop of mayonnaise.    

Juicy Pork Dumpling - Watch out!  The juicy liquid is hot so don't just stick it in your mouth so quickly!  Perfectly steamed.

Steamed Pork Shiu Mai - Reminds me of pork hash from back home in Hawaii.  LOVE.

Shrimp Shiu Mai -  Exactly like the pork, just with shrimp.  Still love.

Shrimp Paste in Green Bell Pepper - They actually shaped the paste into a ball and placed it on top of a big square of steamed bell pepper. The pepper was a little odd.

Pork and Chive Shiu Mai - SUPER OILY.  I had to wipe it down with my napkin.

All in all, a little too oily.  My hands were constantly oily all night.  Not the best experience, I've had better dim sum.  Don't take my word for it.  Please come by and see if you feel the same!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,4,1,3,5PxI_fMaMraxGCNwqD1EkA

Our dishes-

Har Gao- good, but small compared to other dimsum places.
Shu Mai- decent and was juicy,
Guk Char Siu Bao-  BBQ pork bun in sweet bun instead of white fluffy buns. These were were good, nice chewy, sweet buns and the pork was nicely seasoned
Har Cheung Fun- fresh shrimp in large roll noodles with sweet soy. These were good, but the soy needed to be a tad more sweet and light....I think they might have not put the right sauce since that tasted more like seasoning soy.
Yeung Qi Dze-  eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste served with a black bean sauce. It was okay, I don't know if I like it like that since there isn't much taste to the eggplant aside from the sauce outside. I like cooking eggplant in sauce better- it then takes the flavor...Better yet, get a eggplant hot pot- delish! 
Pai gwat- pork spareribs. One of my favorite dimsum dishes...theirs was good, soft meat with a little fat and yummy black beans. 
Fried Shrimp Balls- I dunno the Chinese name of this, but it''s fried crispy outside, shrimp inside and mayo for dipping...whats not to like? 
Sin Chet Kuen- bean curd rolls with pork,mushroom and bamboo shoot inside and braised in a light sauce. These are one of my favorites as a kid....haven't had in a while and it brought me back.
Dan Tat- egg custard pastry cups. Not bad, but not the best I've had. Needed more egg to pastry ratio I think, but the pastry was quite nice and flaky. 
Mang gwo bu ding- pretty good mango pudding. It's a nice touch they put milk on top of it...this is how I eat it at home, but most places do not put milk on it.

Yes, there was only me and the BF. Today we were fatties and had a dim sum feast. I haven't done this in all the time I've lived in Vegas (3 years) so it was quite nice to do on a occasion...it was a monthly tradition growing up in LA. 

The plus here is the service. Even though the carts are limited they keep them coming. Seriously, you are bombarded,in a friendly manner, with carts declaring their offerings every few minutes. If you are looking for something on the dimsum list that isn't on the carts, don't be afraid to ask as they are friendly here and will gladly get it for you if it's available. A server also comes around and checks on everyone often and was on our drink refills. This is absolutely refreshing after some rude treatment and being ignored at Changs (see my review).

Funny that this place runs all day and has just about as much dimsum selection as Changs as well. Limited, but in this situation it's acceptable for an all day dimsum to have just more of the popular dishes and not the ""imperial"" selections. Just a note, but lunch/regular dim sum time is cheaper until 3 pm, and the prices for dimsum go up after that. Still, it is still reasonable prices for late night dimsum 3-10pm. I have yet to come before 3 during lunch, but I imagine there will be more selection with a busier clientele at that time. 

I have not tried Ping Pang Pongs...but I think this is the preferred spot for dim sum so far and might be the better of the places simply because we night folk can come have it anytime. Look, it's nothing like anything in LA, but it's good enough. If I keep comparing it then I set myself up for a bad day....it's like comparing a Honda Civic, good and reliable to a delicious, polished Audi S6. It's just on a different level.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,4,4,DPBPb-x0r54PFlAB0pACiA

Definitely not the best when compared to the kick ass dim sum places in Cali but I find myself somewhat satisfied when I come here, it's a quick fix when those pesky cravings kick in.

They have your dim sum staples: BBQ pork buns, shumai, spare ribs, shrimp har gow, chicken feet, desserts etc. I love their Baked cream bun here though, I can eat them for days! They have a pretty good selection if you come earlier, as the day goes the variety dwindles down to just a few unappetizing plates. I find it to my advantage to call ahead of time to make sure they have my Baked buns and a few other choice items. They also have a sizeable menu to order ala carte from.

Prices are reasonable and in line with the quality. Coming here is entertaining for me as well, I crack up when the ladies pushing the carts practically shove food in your faces and are very assertive with pushy high pressure selling tactics hahaha.

You know it's authentic when all the waitresses are yelling at each other, look pissed off and pass your table without stopping to see if you want anything on their cart. This is how we Asians communicate, don't take it personal. :-P It's quite comedic actually. 

More of a 3.5 stars. I have been here a few times before, but that was a while ago. After having dim sum in San Francisco and LA, the dim sum here were okay. 

- I suggest going during lunch, as the prices are much cheaper for the same selections. 

- Not everything on the menu are on the carts, just ask and they'll make it for you. 

- Some of the dim sum options are good and others could be done better. 

- Dim Sum selections: Shark Fin was delicious and worth getting. The Shrimp Har Gow not as good, the outer layer was too thick. Shumai was good. We got a few other items, I don't remember the names, those were mediocre. See photos. 

- Pass on the pork buns, sesame balls -- better quality at Diamond Bakery in Chinatown. 

- The fried rice and calamari were better than I've had at other dim sum and Chinese restaurants. Fried rice was oily and made fresh. Calamari pieces were huge and had a nice flavor to it. Those were my favorites among the non-dim sum items. 

- A little a cheaper on some items than the last dim sum restaurant I went to (in LA.) Our bill came out to $40, more than enough to feed 3 people and have left overs. 

We came in at the right time. esp during Dec. TV was airing Star Wars A New Hope. 

TIP: keep track of what they stamp on your ticket. Sometimes, they accidentally charge you for more than you ordered. This happens at most dim sum places. 

- We went yesterday, Saturday (Dec 17) around dinner time 5pm. It wasn't busy. 

Free tea was delicious. It was either chrysanthemum or jasmine tea. We asked and she said it a few times: ""chrysanth-jasmine."" If you ask again, you'll most likely get the same answer. haha.

BONUS: Get a free cute Chinese calendar during December, while supplies last.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,12,8,3,zKpk83YI7rq0ekj84fJ7FQ

i will say this place is reasonably priced and there is a couple things that i find very tasty here.. 

Chicken Feet (4/5)
Beef tendon (4/5) Both of these dishes are awesome and taste great. 

fried taro puffs my favorite thing (3/5 sometimes when you bite into this it leaves an iodine type smell that i find annoying sometimes)

Now SHUMAI AND HAR-GO ( also my favorites) i rate 2/5 they need some work in this area this is your go to items and they should shine

Tofu Fa( hot tofu sweet dessert or starter ) 4/5 this is pretty good here its perfectly sweet and the tofu is very smooth. the issue i have sometimes at places when they dont execute this dish is that the texture of the tofu is grainy so i tend not to finsih but here i do .

BEST THING ON THE MENU
( Baked Bbq pork Cha Su Bao) the sticky one 5/5 this is my favorite thing here its so tasty and they put this sticky glaze on it to finish the first bite of this dish is awesome and i always tend to order this to go or i stack my table with 3 orders and take the rest home. its a good leftover as well

5279975,2018-02-26,2,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Though many will contest that there is ""no good Dim Sum in Las Vegas"" that notion seems largely rooted in folks from Southern California who grew up less than an hour from the San Gabriel Valley, the vast majority of natives and those born east of the Mississippi generally easier to please as Dim Sum did not even exist in their home town, nor did any Chinese Restaurant differentiating Szechuan from Cantonese.

Usually restricting the search for such Food to Spring Mountain Road, the rich diversity of Asian eateries in a three-mile stretch of pavement rivaling many American Chinatowns in terms of number but with more diversity, it was instead for a friend's birthday that the car was navigated to the corner of Sahara and Lindell, Orchids Garden gleaming in neon just as it has for over fifteen years.

Known as one of the few locations in town for all-day Dim Sum plus traditional Cantonese Cuisine, the same ownership and servers in place for several years ensuring a better service experience than most, it was just prior to 6:30pm that six guests entered the space prior to several others, a total of three tables with 10+ persons each sitting in celebration as silver carts navigated the premises.

Clean in terms of décor and populated by a largely Asian clientele, both good signs as are the well-maintained Fish tank and restrooms, it was less than five minutes after taking a seat that Water arrived and Tea was offered, the former only filled on request and often running empty though the staff did a good job of making certain that Tea Pots were filled regularly.

Sticking to Dim Sum for the evening, a truncated version of the daytime collection offered  but unfortunately already sold out of a few selections, it was as friends were still trickling in that Dinner began with steamed selections, the Shark Fin Dumplings named after their shape rather than contents an early highlight as were whole Fried Shrimp to follow while the Bone-in Duck was unfortunately not only limp on the surface, but more pricey than the portion should be for eight dollars.

Difficult to say whether Orchids Garden uses previously frozen Dim Sum or makes the items fresh on-site, likely a mixture of both given the homogeneity of certain items and odd consistency of their Shrimp Paste, it was after watching everyone at the table pass on Sticky Rice in a Lotus Leaf that a bundle was taken, the random bits of Pork ranging from ground to slices of Sausage actually quite good while both the Bell Pepper and Eggplant were not as a result of the gelatinous Paste.

Finding the Sugarcane Shrimp and Crab Claws virtually indistinguishable despite a $3.54 price difference, ten grams of Snow Crab completely lost at the center of the fried ball, those looking for something better would be well advised to order a few plates of Shrimp Balls covered with crispy Phyllo at three for the price of two, the Pan Fried Chive Dumpling also packed with Shrimp and better than its steamed counterpart, as well.

Never really understanding the point of Vegetables at Dim Sum, though every person of Asian ancestry seems to prioritize String Beans or Broccoli as part of the experience, both options at Orchids Garden were good despite the former being a little flaccid, an issue also noted in the skin of roast Pork that the waitress warned would not be crispy but someone opted to order anyway.

Falling short again with Pork Spareribs, the majority of each piece Bone and the rest of it stringy, those looking for Noodles on Orchids Garden's menu would do well to pass on flavorless Chow Mein and instead request pan-fried Rice Noodles in X.O. Sauce that is funky but not too hot and thus well suited for those with limited spice tolerance.

Rounding out the savories with fried Calamari and Smelt plus steamed Buns containing BBQ Pork plus Sausage, both of the latter plus Custard Buns rousing suspicion that frozen Dim Sum is being used based on their consistency, it was in sweet selections that the experience concluded, both styles of Sesame Balls sticky and good with a lot of filling while Mochi and Mango Pudding were fine, the later served complimentary with a candle.

**1/2:  While it may indeed be true that Las Vegas lacks world-class Dim Sum outside of holiday events at Jasmine and Wing Lei those looking for their fix can still fare well by ordering selectively at a place like Orchids Garden, though dollar-for-dollar better experiences can be found at Chang's or KJ.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,4,3,ZSyxbdbaiwyg8IeEREpimA
5295260,2008-09-02,5,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"I must say that Dim Sum in Vegas is definitely an adventure. One has to find a balance between good quality and value. The best authentic dim sum place? I would definitely say Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine. The problem? Its pricey. The worst? I would say Harbor Palace. I would not ever go back there again. The middle ground? Orchid's Garden. 

Dont get me wrong. This place is definitely not a five star kinda place... but it gets the job done. If I'm going, I always (and I mean ALWAYS) go on a Saturday morning around 11-Noon. I think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most tolerable. On Sundays, I feel the food is recycled from the day before and the workers try to rush you in and out like cattle.

They have the normal dim sum fare. Nothing too spectacular. The food is pretty consistent and I know what I'm in store for. The cart pushing ladies are pretty nice to me now since I'm a familiar face. What I mean by that is now they dont try to force dishes on my table or recommend stuff that is catered towards the novice.

If I had friends in town, I would most likely bring them someplace nicer. If its just me and my buddies, this place is fine. Why go to Changs and pay up to double for a slightly higher quality when you can go to Orchids Garden and possibly taste a few extra dishes instead?

To put it in layman's terms, Changs is like a Wynn/Bellagio Buffet while Orchid's Garden would be a Planet Hollywood/Mirage Buffet. Easy enough?",0ObIfSgndeeR_kGlo1S7Ww,9,10,3,DppdMCy-1CmyRhlCCMZMlQ

- Wimpy dim sum. shrimp balls are so so tiny! its laughable. shrimp noodle (one of my faves. its the clear wrapper around shrimp where you put sauce on top) only had one piece of shrimp and the noodle was not fresh. seemed old and not soft how it should be.

Wait:
Was actually not bad, waited about 10 minutes during lunch time, for them to set up a table for 4.

Service:
1.The server came to get our drink orders shortly after we sat down. Didn't have to wave anyone down just for tea.
2. Probably due to lunch time, the carts came around but a lot of the food was not available and had to wait until the carts refill.
3. Servers came around frequently to clear empty plates and refill the drinks, which is very good.

Food:
*Shumai (pork dumpling) was not of the authentic/traditional flavor, it carries a Western flavor to it. Not to my taste.
*XiaoLongBao (Shanghai Dumpling) was OK, a bit too dry. This dish should have soup when biting into it.

ChangFen (Steamed Rice Noodle), was made very well. It was soft and thin, but didn't fall apart when I picked it up with chopsticks. It is not easy to get it to that texture.

They also offer a few dishes that are not served at other dim sum restaurants. I missed eating them!
*ShengJianBao (Pan-fried Pork Bun). I haven't been to a place that served this for years! It was delicious, the bun was soft and fluffy, the meat was juicy inside.
*BaiTangGao (Rice Cake). Fluffy and not very sweet, just like it should be. It had nice thin layers, whereas other places make it a big chunk.

What's good about dim sum is that each dish is inexpensive and you can sample a variety of food. I always get Chinese broccoli, shumai, BBQ pork buns, stir-fried noodles, shrimp wontons, shrimp balls, minced meat balls, sesame balls...and whatever balls they have. These are my favorites and what I would normally get at any restaurant that serves dim sum. Their shrimp wontons aren't the best. 

Now, what really turns me off with this place is that they nuke their food in the microwave. I love roast pork and that's just one of the best examples of food they microwave. The meat is warm but the skin gets chewy, no crisp and just unenjoyable.

5339876,2013-06-11,1,Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ,"Let's be honest:
Is this my favorite dim sum place? No. 
Is this the dim sum place I most frequent? Yes!

When it comes to dim sum, I have a specific set of items that I order. I love shrimp. If it has shrimp in it, I must have it.
When it comes to dim sum, my husband has a specific set of items that he orders. He hates fish. Loves meat. If it doesn't have fish, and just meat, he must have it.
Could I tell you the exact name of our favorites? No clue - but I could describe it:
shrimp dumplings, some shrimp dumpling with green stuff in it (chives maybe?), shrimp ball with a sugar cane in it, har gow (I goggled this so that IS the actual name). For my hubs, he loooooooves the BBQ pork buns and the sticky pork buns!

Needless to say, we do not share what we order and after coming to Orchids Garden  over 4 times, we have the place down to a science.

#1 Come early. I have never been to this place on a week day and I have never been to the place over an hour from it's opening time. I read the reviews of the place, and I immediately learned that I don't think I would enjoy it as much in the middle of the week or for a late lunch. I have already noticed the difference between their Sunday service and their Saturday and have learned from friends' experiences - Sunday morning is the best time to go.

#2 don't order anything from a person who's cart is almost empty. The cart ladies work hard and if most of the stuff is gone from the cart, it's safe to assume that they've been around the block a few times. I have made the mistake and had lukewarm shrimp balls and no- they are not good.

#3 A friend of mine had said they had a bad experience because almost every minute someone stopped by their table with cart asking if they wanted something. I think he was complaining that it was hard to have a conversation when they were being interrupted repeatedly. My advice to my friend was - don't go to dim sum then. Dim sum is all about the food. In my opinion, the expectations should be a variety of hot food readily available to you when you sit down. It's not about how friendly the lady pushing the cart is, or how many times you were bothered after you were clearly full.

I am a regular at Orchids Garden because of it's easy-to-get-to location, consistency of food quality, and most of all - the price. Plus, our water glasses are always full, the bathrooms are clean, and we never have to wait to get our bill.

While there are plenty of great dim sum places around town (Ping Pang Pong to name one), Orchids Gardens is my go to spot for early afternoon cravings. It hasn't let me down once.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,7,2,4,eZTYt5P9PXG-b2UpJuqRVA

After wandering (for 2 years in Las Vegas), we finally decided to make our way into Orchids this year.  I am so glad that we did!  The dim sum is reasonably priced and the selection is abundant.  I would best compare it to Happy Day Chinese Restaurant on Waialae Ave in Honolulu.  FYI, Saturday lunches are always so busy!  Expect to wait a few minutes to be seated.

If you are looking for more ""authentic"" dim sum, then this isn't it, although they do have their fair share of dim sum from chicken feet in black bean sauce to steamed char siu bao.  My kids enjoy the shumai and the rice wrapped in lotus leaf the most.  But what they really go there for is the sweets!  Lotus bean jin dui (sesame balls filled with lotus or red bean) is ever so present there, just like in Hawaii (yay!).  And often, but not always, they have the cart going around serving you this sweet tofu dessert.  It's a freshly made silken tofu served hot in a sweet ginger-infused syrup.  I'm not sure what they call it in Chinese, but the cart ladies go around asking ""sweet tofu?  sweet tofu?""  I know it's made there fresh, because the owner (I think she is one), always reminds us (she knows us that much) that a fresh one is being made ready in 5 minutes or so.

The one thing we would love to see happen is Orchids being open for morning breakfast/brunch.  In Hawaii, it is common to have dim sum for breakfast.  But here in Las Vegas, not so common.  Too bad.

The staff is friendly, as friendly as any Chinese restaurant staff could be...if you haven't been to a Chinese restaurant, don't expect too much in polite, unhurried style of service.  They don't speak English very well, but I would still recommend to stick it out and try it, or just go with someone who knows how and what to order.

If you're from Hawaii, you will probably run into a few local residents who used to live in Hawaii.  That's what I like about Orchids...feels like as if we were home again...",xozBOvi6cWO_p1OdteF9zw,1,1,4,ay-dxX3o7Jn4TeXGkfqlbw

Dim sum is fine, but after each of the three times I've been here, I've had a stomachache and slight nausea afterwards. Food is kinda greasy/oily even for dim sum! I've had my fair share of dimsum, and don't get me wrong, I love me some msg & enough oil to make a dish taste good, but you don't have to overdo it to the point of feeling discomfort afterwards. 

It's loud, there's always a wait regardless of the time of day, and good luck getting any kind of minimal service here (& I'm not expecting much service at dimsum anyways). Last time I was here, a server lady poured soy sauce on a dish from three feet up (slight exaggeration but hardly). It splashed up from the plate (duh), but there was no change in behavior from server or apology for her actions. 

However, having said all the above, if you're craving dim sum, this is the place to satisfy it, sadly. 

Side rant: Can we start a petition to get rid of the loud banquet hall style Chinese restaurants? Like some quieter ones where diners don't have to shout to each other to be heard would be awesome.",mHp4g3_z2dmD9UPXzuE8bQ,2,0,3,9n3_hDjqqB1mBMz8MPUeZQ

Honestly, I only come here for a couple things. Rice cake and their Manapua. The rice cake (aka honeycomb cake) is the closest fix I can get for my 808nostalgia. Nothing comes close in this state to finding the kind of rice cakes we get back in HI. 

I know, I know...we aren't in HI. So that's why this will make-do. The rice cake comes in 3 thin slices for...darn, I don't ever remember the price because I do one of those order and just pay (don't worry...it's not a bad habit I practice). But I think it's in the dollar area. 

Their Manapua (char siu bao) comes in 3 pcs as well. It's dimsum so you can't expect a huge stuffing. But they're pretty good. Their baked Manapua is drizzled in honey. Sooo good! I never thought Manapua and honey could work so well together--it does. 

We always order to-go just to have something to stuff our mouths in on our drive. I don't really care for dimsum here because they usually offer items I'm allergic to or am not interested in eating. I end up just eating manapua, their chow mein, and rice cake. Then I don't think of ordering an ala carte entree because if I'm at a dimsum, despite my food aversion, I want to try to experience it the most I can.

We came here for an early dinner, 4:30ish, so we figured we were either going to get the fresh stuff they began preparing for dinner, or the bottom-of-the-barrel leftover from the lunch crowd.  Well, either they continuously make them or we got the first dinner batch, because everything was fresh.  

After the somewhat frustrating experience at Ping Pang Pong with not enough of what I wanted, I was not-so-secretly hoping the menu would be more to my liking.  I was not disappointed.  Plenty of shu mai, dumplings, and har gows to satisfy my cravings.  The pork and shrimp based pieces were fresh and tasty, with a couple of complaints;  1) the rice wrappings on the har gow and rice noodle rolls had too much flour-y taste to them, and 2) the rice noodle rolls had too much of the rice noodles for the amount of shrimp.  Not sure there should be flour taste in rice noodles...  But otherwise, the shu mais and dumplings were great, and the pimento stuffed with shrimp dim sum was fantastic.  And the sweet cream buns were yummy too.  

Clean setting, fresh and mostly delish dim sums, and timeliness all add up to a satisfying experience.  Service is typically terse for dim sum joints, although there were spots of smiles and courtesy here and there.  We might also want to try some regular menus here, although I'm not sure how we'd resist the temptation of the rolling carts!

Solid dim sum restaurant in Vegas!

My boyfriend wanted to get dim sum while we in Vegas, so we did a little Yelping and found this to be one of the better places in the area. NOTE: If you do not have a car and are staying around the Strip area, this may be hard for you to get to. It is about a 10-15 min drive away from the Strip in a random shopping center.

We came this past Sunday a little after noon and the place was packed. However, we must have only waited 5-10 min. tops before being seated!

I love dim sum places where they push around all of the different dishes on little carts. There's something satisfying about being able to see your options and pick and choose what you want, and having it brought straight to your table rather than selecting from a menu book of pictures of all the different dishes. 

This place had a great selection of dim sum! We got a TON of different dishes. From what I can remember, I saw:

ha/har gow
siu mai
wu gok
cha siu bao (baked + steamed)
cheong fan
lo baak gou
fung zao
daan taat
jin deui
do fu fa
lai wong bau

We got lucky and were seated right by the kitchen, which was awesome because we basically got first dibs on all of the hot and fresh food that came out of there! 

I also liked how frequent the women pushing the carts came by. I felt like I was constantly checking out the carts and the dishes, and there was always a decent amount of food on our table. I've been at other dim sum places where it seems like you have to wait forever for another person to come by with a different cart. They were on top of their game here!

Overall, I had a great experience at Orchids Garden. Would definitely return whenever I'm back in Vegas. Worth visiting if you love dim sum!",Wd4FRRD30avk-Mj6C_O2ow,18,17,5,lD-YZKDkTrso7gSU7xq64g

We were unaware of the two choices they have 1) off the regular menu or 2) off the ""rolling cart"" menu.  We were a bit confused, so we decided to do the ""rolling cart"" menu.  It was challenging understanding the woman offering us the menu choices.  There is a menu that has pictures, but a lot of the menu items looked the same.  
Overall, the food was absolutely NASTY.  It was old and greasy.  The calamari was cold, so we sent it back.  All they did was throw it back in the fryer.  So now it was hot but overcooked.  My husband, who always tries to find something positive, did like the Fried Rice.  It was very greasy.  
When I woke at 2:30 am with a very queasy stomach, I realized it was from thinking about the food I had eaten at the Orchids Garden.  I definitely would not recommend this restaurant.  Still looking for a decent Chinese Restaurant.",_2rRSDaeAmn3v4YOaS1PLg,0,0,1,HNM91JP72-abb_cxlLQheg

We were sat where not a lot of people were at first so the dim sum carts passed us by a few times before actually coming to us. I can't remember the first thing we got because the lady said it in Chinese and kinda looked at us and expected us to know what it was. All I got from what she said was shrimp and wonton so we got one of those and two shumai baskets. We also later got noodles and Chinese broccoli. We thought the shrimp was delicious so choose to actually get another one of those and even had a few left overs in the end. 

Overall, everything was tasty. It did take quite some time for someone to come back in the end to check on us so we could get a box and the check though. Our experience was good and the restaurant was clean and has an Asian theme to it.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,0,3,WQVTdc1m6aEiPl4zDo24fw
