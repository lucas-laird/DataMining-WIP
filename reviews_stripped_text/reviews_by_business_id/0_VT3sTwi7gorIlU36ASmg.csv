The only problem and it's a biggie. The seating sucks. Hard  uncomfortable. With the prices you want to stay a while. The food is so good that if the seats were comfortable I'd have stayed longer and we would have eaten again. My butt was numb so had to sit on the floor in the play area.

Pros:  lots of fun things for toddlers to do. Jungle gyms, slides, foam shooters, etc. the food quality is great for a kids place.  Very clean and lots of staff watching the kids. 

Cons:  Pricing. $30 for two kids plus another $5 for an additional adult is a bit pricey. You can leave and come back but only within 2 hrs. The kids birthday parties are way over priced. $565 for 12 kids and 12 adults seems excessive. 

Overall a fun place to visit right now because it wasn't busy but I would suggest they drop the extra adult charge (and make up the difference with parents buying food/drinks) while they watch their kids play.",rMxN0I52AJVBxue4tdAzlw,1,0,4,1mG2dP06KNZukXE_TLhOPg

Went here with some friends & their child, along with my brother & son.

Next we ordered a pizza which we waited 30 mins for & found hair in it(because the chefs had beards with no face nets to cover) returned it and waited another 15ish minutes, lastly as we leave we asked for our bins & the lady asked to check all of our bands i asked why very rudely she stated 'to make sure hes yours' i appreciate the caution but say it with a concerned tone then....

1012956,2017-04-01,0,0_VT3sTwi7gorIlU36ASmg,"Probably one of the best indoor play areas of this type in Vegas.  After you sign a waiver & pay for admission they have you place your shoes in bins which they keep behind the counter, they scan you w/ a metal detector to check for weapons then its play time!  They have a large jungle gym w/ various activities; slides, trampolines, netting to climb, shooting area w/ soft foam balls, swing, toddler zone w/ ball pit for kids 4 & under and a cafe w/ lounge area.  Our 4yr old absolutely loves this place.  My husband & I took him this afternoon and he played for nearly 6 hours, no joke!  He did take a little break to eat and refuel.  We ate at their cafe since it was super convenient.  The food was your typical fast food fare.  It was priced very reasonably,    ~$23 for a large roasted veggie pizza, generous serving of skinny cut seasoned fries and 3 drinks.  Admission fee for all day play for the three of us was only ~$18 since they provide 20% military discounts.  Kudos to LOL Kids Club for honoring our heroes, I love that.  The only negative that I experienced was the staff didn't check our wristbands upon us leaving, which was a little disappointing.  Hopefully today was just an oversight.",pI_njybTKxqScZ0-60mI5Q,0,0,5,CGtIYRR6Thu_5mSOGq5FIQ

Not only is  admittance pricey, the food is too and takes forever to get, it took them 45 minutes to get us our 2 drinks!!! 

I will say that the place is great for kids, it's huge and has lots of room for kids to run around and play. It has enough to keep kiddos entertained for hours. They keep it very clean and the manager that we dealt with, Javan, was very very nice he did refund us our money after complaining of course and their food almost killed my cousin after we told them explicitly about the peanut allergy they still served food that had peanut allergy warning on after supposedly checking it, really! 3 people in my family including myself, had an allergic reaction after ingesting food and beverage items from here. The kitchen and it's staff need to get it together or they will be encountering law suits!

The pricing is ridiculous, they charge parents to go in there just to sit $5 bucks! I was charged full price for my teenage daughters who weren't going to do anything except sit for the birthday party we attended.

We signed the waiver form weeks ahead of time. They found my name and my daughter's name and not my husband or my son. So they asked me to check in again and fill out form again despite of the long and crowded line all going to the party, to avoid any troubles I did and they couldn't find it again. So I did it again, and they couldn't find it again. My kids are ready to cry coz they have been waiting and wanting to play. Just to check in is approx 25-30
Mins. Wtf! Right? I almost left, but saw my brother who paid so much money for this shitty place! And they all of a sudden found my name and my kids. They give you bracelets to claim ur shoes but that's it. They never check if band numbers to match the kids your taking out. But they check it for shoes. Wow what a security right? I'm not going to be surprised if kids are being kidnapped from this place. Chuck E. Cheese's is better they give u stamp that matched ur kids stamp. In here you can walk in and walk out with a kid, nobody will know. Play area is nice but it can get crowded on a Tuesday! Aside from the incompetent workers the food that was ordered here for the birthday party is so bad. Burnt chicken fingers, no taste salad and the pizza are bad. The taste is like flour that's it. With some BBQ sauce. It's nasty. So cheap that they use plastic cup and plastic plates that they reuse, kinda dirty! Will never use this for party. And will never come back for my kids to play in an indoor playground. Because Here due to stupidity of the workers. They are Too lazy to find my name and my kids... so they made everyone redo their waivers. disorganized and bad security.

There is a guy there named Deven, and he was working his butt off... he's really the only person I see working. Others are just standing around talking to eachother.

1199461,2018-03-27,0,0_VT3sTwi7gorIlU36ASmg,This place is clean and has a great play area. It is good for kids of all ages and is not too hard for parents to maneuver around in. The staff monitored the play area to make sure kids were being safe. The reason I only give it two stars is because when you leave they are supposed to check your wristband and your child's wristband to make sure the numbers match when you retrieve your shoes. The staff member did not check ours. If you don't stop for shoes then no one checks that kids are leaving with the appropriate adult or with any adult for that matter. This place is huge and it is very easy to lose track of your child. I have a two year old so I stay with her at all times to help her around but most kids are playing independently and it would be very easy for a child to wander off or for someone to just take a child. I think maybe a better system could be put in place. I'd rather wait in line to be checked out and know my child is safe than just to leave at will.,1wmD8KM3o4biT-AtXbV6tg,1,0,2,x71ufyne27fPWO62u89y3Q

I understand that this is a new place so I try to be as patient as possible. Another ten minutes goes by and nothing. Keep in mind that this was on a Monday morning and this place was pretty empty. Bottom line is, that it didn't only take more than 30 minutes for the food to arrive but it was also blend and cold. I spoke to the general manager and he apologized but I feel that this long of a wait in such a slow day is just unacceptable.

I asked to speak to a manager. She came out with arms crossed and a scowl on her face. She proceeded to tell me that the cleaning supplies are essential oils so they are safe. No they aren't. My daughters asthma is triggered by things like that. And if your employee has a mask on, how can it be safe for kids? Then she told me that they have somebody watching he under four area. We have been here twice and both times nobody was watching that area. It as unsafe. The manager was rude and disrespectful and continued to disagree with me about what I know about my daughters health. She didn't seem concerned at all that a boy who was likely 8 or 9 and twice the size of my daughter jumped on her three times until I could get across to her.

I'm writing this review because I can't get over how nice of the staff here. Working in retail, I realize how important to have the right employees represent your business. This place does absolute incredible job in hiring their employees. First, the lady named Cris who is always helpful every time we are there( first time - I lost my phone and she wasn't hesitate to help me look for it). Yesterday, my son pulled his neck from jumping, Cris was the first one noticing it and offered us ice right away. Then Trinity who is at the Cafe area is super friendly and patient with every customer. She would go above and beyond to walk over to the table to serve us food. Lastly, Patricia who is so nice and really know how to deal with kids. She even asked us an hour later if my son's neck got better. 
This made me smile the whole time I was there and I kept wondering if all the staff here love children! :) 
The place is constantly cleaned and there are plenty of staff around the playground to make sure it is safe for everyone.

Now I get that they have a kitchen. I think that's a great thing. But lower your pricing! $4 for broccoli. Really.

It's super clean, absolutely massive and has SO much to do! I have two boys ages 8 and 2.5. They loved every minute of it! Definitely one of the biggest play places I've been to out here, and with the most variety of things to do. 

However I'm only giving 4 stars because the price tag on this place is absolutely RIDICULOUS!!!! I actually wasn't going to come at all being that it's a good 20ish minute drive from my house PLUS had a $30 price tag just for my two kids. And get this, THEY CHARGE FOR ADULTS! What?! Why?! That's insane. I've never, ever heard of indoor playgrounds charging for adults! First parent is free so if you plan on bringing anyone else with you plan on spending an additional $5 PER ADULT.

I'm happy I gave this place a try but I will definitely only be coming here when my older one is at school and my husband is at work. (I'd rather take them to the comparable, and less expensive Kangamoo or Fun Lane, when we have the whole family). 

Also, because of the huge price tag on admission it definitely was a deterrent from ordering any food here. This isn't really worth $50+ for admission, food and drinks. When Chuck-E-Cheese and Peter Piper Pizza have food/play packages for less than that.

LOL would totally be the complete 5 Star package if they lowered admission and completely stopped charging for adults! I would be more inclined to spend more money once inside (food, drinks, etc).

The good:
The venue is gargantuan! Wow. Talk about hours and hours of playtime for your kids. There are cars to drive around, guns to shoot, a ball pit, w slides, lots of tunnels and a couple of good spiral slides.

The venue is clean. There were employees that were constantly putting cars back in its parking lot area. There were people dusting the tops and wiping the bottoms.

The best thing about this place, for adults... small adults like myself at least... is that at least half of their jungle gym is tall enough for parents to crouch and not feel the need to crawl everywhere. When i say 50% of the gym... i mean that you will eventually run into an area where you are going to have to crawl in a tight space. But with my minor lower back issues, i was fine running around with my kiddo. 

The snack bar had a lot of options and variety but we didnt have a chance to give it a whirl.

The bad:
Price. 4 people that consisted of 2 adults, 2 kids was approximately $30. For what its worth, you get what you pay for... and this place is worth it. 

Location. I live in the N. LV area, so a 30-40 min drive is a long drive for a indoor playground. I heard they are opening another location... hopefully its on the north side.

Recommendations for the management:

More seating areas scattered around the jungle gym. Give the option to parents to be somewhat close or within eyes view of their kids. Since its so big in there its almost impossible to always have eyes on your kids from the eating area.

closest to the play area entrance.

We've been here a few times. They are a tad pricey but the food is good. We've never had any issues with the staff before this day.

My daughter needed to nurse at one point while I was alone at the table with her. 
While I was was nursing a female employee came up to me and told me I had to cover up. She mentioned that they usually let people nurse in a private room but those were all rented out for parties. Feeling shocked and vulnerable I found a pair of my sons extra shorts from my diaper bag and made a feeble attempt to cover my daughter until the woman left.

After I gained composure, I made sure to let her know that what she just did was illegal. She didn't show any reaction, simply saying, ""I'll tell my manager."" 

We had just ordered food and my sons were having a blast so I decided to wait to see if the management would do anything to rectify the situation. I'm not sure exactly how long we were there after (45-60min). 

No one else approached me. 

Before we left I asked to speak with the manager. I informed her of the law and how I had been treated. 

She clearly knew about the situation. She did not make eye contact with me and repeated, ""I apologize, that's just what we were told.""  So apparently it is a policy to break the law??

This is a family establishment in which mothers who breastfeed frequent. The staff need to be educated in this matter. LOL Kids how is this going to be addressed?",Dd3jkRJJ4eh1D44_NIpobQ,7,0,1,StsPznNb2AP6c6um71pY7w

Even when it started to fill up, the play area was so spacious and the kids had a lot of fun.  It was worth the $17. I think we will consider the membership next time.  It is a bit in the pricier side, but there are more attendants and actual workers cleaning up.  
I highly suggest the food too. The chicken salad sandwich was delicious with in house made bread.  The Chef was originally a pastry chef and the food is fresh. Also a bit pricier, but worth it.  The pizza was good, fresh made but not as tasty. Bring socks- or they're $3. 

Had a party here and it was for about 30+ kids with the deluxe package. I ordered extra food and the host Habbey was awesome.  It ran us about $1000, with tip and extra food, it was well worth it.

I am impressed with how clean they keep the place. Not so much the restroom, but the playground area. I was also pleased to see their menu wasn't outrageously priced and the food was pretty decent. They have a big selection of food, snacks, and desserts.

I highly recommend coming at non-peak times. It's quite enjoyable. I don't think I'd be able to handle this place on a Saturday, but that's me.

Second, I walked in with a sense of dread because 1. Lots of kids in one place= germs galore and 2. Play places just creep me out most of the time.  But, it was my daughter's birthday and she had been begging to come here... so here we were!
I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  You can complete an online waiver before arrival to make your check in process faster.  I definitely recommend doing that to prevent your kiddos from becoming antsy!  After, that shoes off and placed in a bin, wrist bands assigned and you're good to go in.  There is also a sign that notes only water and coffee are allowed- no outside food.
The play area is huge and so is the section for parents with plenty of table space! They also have quite a few party rooms.  
The play area features a toddler section for kids ages 4 and under, plus a HUGE climbing structure filled with slides and other fun obstacles for kids about 4+.  I think my child went down the big red slide about 72 times to be exact because she loved it so much.
They also provide a little walk up restaurant that features a WIDE variety of food... I'm talking everything from boba to bento to chicken nuggets.  Price point is a little high, but not too bad and quality was decent.  
I was impressed by the active amount of cleaning that the staff was doing while the kids were playing.  This definitely helped me get over the gross germ factor.  Only downside was that they had a huge ladder set up right next to a slide for some time that I felt was a safety hazard.  But, other than that I was very happy.

We went to a birthday party. If you opt for a table that's not in a private to you can stay at the table as long as you want. Private rooms are limited to 2 hours. So clearly you don't go to a place like this for the Food but the food here was really not good. The ranch dressing for the salad tasted spoiled and the pizza was a bit tough. I'm sure the kids didn't mind at all, however. 

While we were there we did experience 2 different vomit sessions by different kids. Honestly, it is very big so it did make me wonder how clean and sanitary is this place? Just a thought.

I thought KangaMoo was big until we visited this one. This is by far the biggest and the best indoor play Vegas has to offer. 

Is the fee for admission expensive? Yes. On a regular day, it is $16.95 for the first kid and $12.95 for each additional kid. However, if you check it out on Tuesday and Thursday it is only $8 (Happy Hour price which is more than reasonable). Other in-door play places you go to $10 is average, and it is not close to the size of this. They also have free frozen yogurt on certain days from 1:30 - 4 p.m.

The both times I have taken my kids (3) here they spent at least 2-3 hours just running around and going on the same slide. Other places I have been to they get bored after the 1st hour or so.

I have yet to try the food but you can always leave to grab real food and get admitted back in. They have a spacious dining area to eat at and seats on the side of the play area to watch your kids. 

If you are looking for a place for your little ones to have fun, I would highly recommend this place (for kids 10 and under) on a Tuesday or Thursday. We have memberships to the Discovery Children's Museum and Cowabunga Bay too (and my kids would rather go here). 

The only reason for the 4-star is the regular admission prices. They also charge the 2nd adult ($5).",_L4W_EyPTXFqUumsFgQ8hQ,0,0,4,qgoyMbEKWJYS3QEFvlddnw

Our party host Jimi was great and attentive. She was very patient and made sure we had everything we needed. The food came on time, was good and was very presentable. You get your own private room for the full two hours and it's all ready and set up with your decorations even before the party starts. When your time was up in the room, the host simply let you know but wasn't rude about it nor did she rush you out if you were straggling to pack and/or trying to end conversations with your guests. Good job! Only issue would be the waivers for guests who aren't tech savvy (i.e. my older parents) may find it difficult to fill out and once filled out, you have to wait in line again...I know waivers can be pre filled before the party but some don't have the time or resources to do that...maybe a quick sheet with the information where they can just write and sign their name and give number/email would be easier?

just my opinion but compared between chuck e cheese, kangamoo and lol kid's club i would probably book a party at lol kids club. chuck e cheese is just SO overplayed with the crappy game prizes and lame chuck e shows. kangamoo is in my opinion more or less a pit stop to drop your kid to play for a bit and give mom a quick break with all the ammenities offered for parents [dont get me wrong, love it!] but lol kids club has a cool multi level play area to let the kids run wild for 2ish hours, then eat, do cake/presents and call it a day. great addition to the neighborhood!",L4qTcN8qRw62ZSrHvUg1uw,0,0,3,y0b9x28UlKZ1ZmcU6IhWHQ

Now the biggest problem is -which is why I'm giving 2.5 star i meant to give despite the positive things- how the management handle problem kids. This place is so big and not all the parents follow their kids around. I was just there with my 3 year old boy at 1pm. Even though it was during school hours, there were bigger children looking about 6-7 years of age. I saw these 2 bigger boys hitting a 2 year old looking little girl, which the girl's mom saw and stopped the boys, and immediately informed the staff. Later one of the same boys was bullying and intimidating my son who was merely walking his way past that boy. My son was totally stunned and scared and just froze, not knowing what to do. I yelled and stopped the boy, told him you're here to play, not to bully other little kids. I also went and told the staff the same boys that hit a girl earlier are going around intimidating little ones. The staff including the manager told me they are aware and been watching them. I was told that the boys been doing that ALL DAY and when they talk to the parents (who were just sitting around at dining area looking careless of their own children), the parents gave attitude. No surprise that their boys are so ignorant and bad mannered. I was so surprised LOL didn't take any action about these boys other than ""keeping eye on"". I've seen how Kangamoo kick that kind of problem kid immediately. I've heard Kangamoo staff saying they won't tolerate that kind of behavior. I strongly believe what they are doing is so right. These indoor playrooms' utmost priority should be children's safety. Worried about offending parents by kicking their children out? What about innocent well-behaved children that get physically or emotionally hurt?? You don't worry about offending the parents of children who get bullied or hurt???  I really think LOL should seriously reconsider setting up a policy about this and take a strong action against problem behaviors before anyone gets severely hurt. This is why today was only the 2nd time I took my son to LOL when I live 2 mins away,, and I take my son to Kangamoo more frequently although it's 20 mins away from home.",bw7svEB2wItKKMdIynFdRg,1,0,3,9SIvbgpxiEeQmSnF2vlssw

Food part on the other hand, I highly disappointed. I ordered fruits tart that was in the chilled show case. When I was about to eat 2/3 part of it, I saw mold on orange. I returned to the counter and showed it to the female clerk, she went back to kitchen and asked whoever responsible, and she returned and told me that it's not mold and it's from kiwi... it is Mold and it's called A fungus of the Rhizopus genus(common on bread). Yes part of it is my fault that I didn't check the food before eat which I probably should and eat 2/3 of it already, what was not helping the situation was that other employees that were also in the counter clearly talked about me like ""what do you want after you eat so much?!"".. 
I didn't ask for replacement or refund, just wanted to warn you all.

All day play for the kids after your party is over is another bonus! It was totally worth the cost. The kids all had a blast! The only negative thing I can say is that when I called the morning of the party to add more food, I was told they couldn't find my party because whoever took the reservation didn't put it in. It gave me a mild panic attack the morning of the party. And whoever I spoke with on the phone didn't seem very professional in handling the mess up. And that added to my stress.

 I cannot say the same thing for the day beforehand. I had reserved the rooms about 2 1/2 months prior to the event, and although one day before my son's big day I get a call from them saying they had made a mistake on the rooms I had rented, they completely made up for it. 
 They decorated my son's rooms galaxy/space theme and our party host Niyla had the best customer service anyone can ask for. She went out of her way to have my guests and I satisfied. Not to mention, Javan, the manager went above and beyond in making our event happen. 
 I recommend this place for parents who are looking for a place to take their kids for a day of fun, or as big as having a birthday party. 
 They will take all the stress away from you and make it an awesome day for your friends & family. Now that summer is around the corner, in Vegas you have to plan for indoor fun.

I expected it to be busier than normal considering most schools were out for a week for Thanksgiving, however, it seemed as if they were understaffed.  Checking in was a nightmare.  I couldn't understand why only one register was open when there were two people behind the counter.  Our food took an hour to get and the grilled cheese we ordered was cold and no longer melted.  They don't get the orders out fast enough because there are not enough people working behind the counter.  Also, they have different drink sizes, but only had one size available.  

On the plus side, they did try to keep the eating area clean and someone came by regularly to sweep.  The play area is huge and they had employees there monitoring for safety.  I did like that it catered to older kids unlike a lot of the indoor playgrounds around town.

But finally, the last downside, what was the point of matching my bracelet number with the kids if they don't check it as we walk out.  

There are definitely certain flaws in their system that they need to work out.  They also should be aware and prepared for holidays and such and expect bigger crowds especially on really cold, really hot or rainy days.",RsM1c8oyqWrIFm18bQhKEA,0,0,3,9kRIVeO6-2kIV-KN2Xp43Q

3492376,2018-02-18,0,0_VT3sTwi7gorIlU36ASmg,"My review is based on my experience? with the party planning/hosting of this place. 

A month before my daughter's birthday party, my little family and I went inside to check it out and ask some questions. We have been there before but never inquired about parties. SISSY was kind enough to show us prices and answer any questions we had. One thing she mentioned, was that we had to book our party soon, as they get very busy on the weekends. I booked my child's party January 13th online. When you book a party, It tells you to wait for a confirmation e-mail. I waited for 2 days, and I didn't receive any confirmation e-mail. I called every day, and once I even spoke to someone and they said she would confirm my party, and that I WAS NOT supposed to receive an email for confirmation. Thinking that the party for Feb 11 was all set, I tried to put my guest list in and again it said that my party was not confirmed. I tried calling them for about a week and a half, with no answer?. I left voicemails? and called multiple times and I even went there after work to see what was going on with my party. Just when we were ready to call it quits and cancel, Amanda called us and gave us peace of mind that the party was going to go on without a problem. It was truly a stress to get a reply from them. After I spoke with Amanda on Jan 31st, we would e-mail back and forth regarding the upcoming? party. With just 1 week and 1/2 away, we were able to give them details regarding? food and other things we needed for that day. We added extra food the Thursday before the party when we dropped off the decorations. When we first toured with Sissy, she gave us a brochure with pictures on the front of prior parties and decorations, I mentioned to her that we wanted to have an arch of balloons at our party as well (like a picture on the brochure), and she said that they could absolutely accommodate? with that. The Thursday? before the party, I again mentioned to Sissy that we brought the balloons and things for the arch and she said we had to go it ourselves? because they charge $1 to blow up any kind of balloons, not just helium. A great detail she forgot to mention the time we toured their playground.

The day of the party, everything seemed to be going smooth, until we checked in, entered the room and spoke to the party host. One of the main reasons we got the rooms that we did (the first 2 rooms) was because Sissy mentioned that we can play Netflix? and put the Trolls movie on. Come to find out, they didn't have wi-fi and we can't play Netflix. One of my guests had to figure out how to connect her phone to the television in order to play the movie. We were allowed to go in our room 20 minutes before our party started (rooms were booked from 7:30 PM- 9:30 PM). Our party host did a great job with the decorations, and the cake was to die for! The food is soo good! Although, we had yet another miscommunication and they didn't add the food from the previous? mentioned Thursday?, So I had to get out of my party and go pay for 3 pizzas and 1 tray of sandwiches, $113 more. To be honest, I was irritated, but we were already there and we were expecting more people so I had to do it. The staff just kept saying sorry, but didn't offer anything else but that. We liked our party host and she did a good job, but a suggestion for any future parties: If a party is more that one room you should consider having 2 party hosts as one can be overhemled by everything needed. We were the only party booked in a room the day for that time. One of the main selling points for us was that they would handle everything and we could enjoy the party, but at least for me, that was not the case. I wouldn't come back to book a party anytime soon, but I would definetly come back to play and eat here. Highly recommend the pesto alfredo, the BLT on croissant, the pizza, and if you can, get the cake made here! The children enjoyed it and we got to see Juju (the panda mascot).

I would say for over $1,000+ spent for a deluxe package was not worth so much miscommunication and stress,. They do a great job but you have to be on them. I feel like I was too trusting in what I was initially told, so I wasn't worried about it too much until everything started to go downhill. 

I will add names of party host and chef later, I am currently waiting for an e-mail from Amanda with details.",FTbs_GQLZ3Uq1K-9Zf7T8g,1,0,3,SoXn5R9n2xbfydr7p-sJ7w

Great for an active 2yo...but probably more for a 3-10, some up to 12 yo. Depends on how the child plays with younger kids. Lots of different activities. There is a section for toddlers - ball pit and slides, though some older kids play in it. Go on their website and watch how they clean the balls...it's well maintained. The rest is a three-story dream for the child (or adult) who loves to climb, slide, jump. There are different obstacles and ways around. Gets your workout in. Soft ball gun section is a blast. 

There are five party rooms, and can be opened onto larger ones of needed. Lots of seating outside them too. They have a full restaurant - reasonable and yummy. Chicken nuggets/mini digs are always a winner for the kids. Thai salad is delicious. And bento boxes are a great balance and different from the usual pizza (which they also have). 

Recommendations for improvement: allow for 2 free parents. They only allow for 1. The 2nd parent is $5. Also the check-in process can take long when several events are happening at the same time.",rBpEEgJ_lzQaXeoaynmgeg,1,1,4,OlOIa1_z-iNHdZpKJwwfdw

We took my 18mo old and her 2 yr old friend last Saturday since they have a ""toddler area"",  which in theory would have been perfect for them to play in the ball pit, go down the mini slides, climb through play gym, etc. but there were big kids everywhere and nobody to ask them to leave the 4 and under area. We asked one of the workers once he walked by and he was kind enough to ask them to leave but as soon as he left they came back. So needless to say, myself and the other mom I was with were on defense the entire time trying to guard our little peanuts from being jumped on. Paid full day price for only an hour of ""play"". On the positive side- they do have a pretty good security checkpoint to make sure babies are leaving with who brought them in.",GIWm0JnYF42wfvaUnr9BXQ,0,0,2,3UUc9ZLz_FZK6o6GVFMNqw
3839122,2017-02-26,0,0_VT3sTwi7gorIlU36ASmg,"This place is great for the kids! My daughter had so much fun! I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends/family that want to just do something fun with their kids on a random day! 

First things first-- makes sure your child has socks or you'd have to purchase one of their socks. On your first visit you need to electronically sign a waiver. It was pretty hectic at first because everyone was just standing around waiting to sign the waiver since they only had 2 open screens to do it (I believe you can do it online as well prior to getting there but we weren't aware of that option and exactly how that works). It took about 15 minutes just to get inside waiting for everyone in my group to sign that waiver because literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON going inside signs that waiver (from new born to elders) regardless if you're going to be playing or not. The good thing is once you sign that waiver you never have to sign it again-- you would be stored in their system and they'll search you via name/email/phone number the next time you come back. Once you sign the waiver you pay-- this place is pretty pricey in my opinion. $16.95 for the first child and 1 adult free, $12.95 for an additional child and $5 additional adult-- good thing I only have 1 child. The admission is good for all day play-- you may even leave the facility for a max of 2 hours and be able to come back and not have to pay again. After that they provide you with a bucket to keep your stuff in (shoes, jackets, etc). Then they will metal detector you before going inside. 

Finally-- we're inside the play area. As soon as we get in we order food because we're starving! Decent pricing for the food which is comparable to the food pricing at any other kids place you go to therefore I don't believe it was overly priced at all. My boo got the chicken fingers and fries which was good-- chicken not overly cooked and fries cooked to perfection. I got the salmon bento that came with rice, salmon, a side of vegetables, and a side of salad-- the salmon was real good but the rice was made wet and sticky so I didn't touch the rice. My daughter got the bubble waffles-- it was soooooo good and not overly sweet at all!! My girlfriend got the chicken side salad with brown rice-- also delicious and the brown rice was way better than the white rice.

After we ate we played. So much fun! The slides for the kids were so fun especially the slide that goes into the ball pit. Falling in those balls hurt a bit-- maybe only from an adults perspective since it is for kids hahaha. They have a little ""nerf gun"" section which is hilarious because we were just shooting at anyone. My daughter is in gymnastics so she was loving the trampoline inside of there. They have little swings. And a ball pit area for the kids. My daughter and my friends kids all had fun and once we left they were knocked out on the car-- that's how you know they all had a great time! Too bad this place is far from where we live or we'd probably be regulars. 

Oh and they have slippers in front of the bathroom so you don't walk into the bathroom with just your socks because how gross is that!!! That was pretty different which is cool. hahaha",XX--i6RiqjGGTUg4XFNxfQ,0,1,4,9sJw8-whso2_xZsG3kD6lg

First of all don't book the party online. Made the reservation took my credit card number but come to find out 2 weeks later it never saved and they told me that this happens. If they don't charge u deposit immediately it does not save FYI

I booked for the middle option for 24 kids. In the beginning there were 2 Party hosts and the 2nd one left to go home 10 mins after the party started. So this one host might be doing a great job but not enough for the amount of work for the amount of people to serve.
Only one interactive game . And not enough yogurt to go around. They only brought in maybe 8 in the beginning and some kids were upset so I had to ask for more. I brought in few paper plates and cups to go with the theme but they never brought our extras and I was having to go down at the Cafe myself to get more . Drinks needed to be refill and my mom had to go down to the cafe a few times to ask for more.
More adults showed up than anticipated to I felt the food was running low . Asked the chef if I could order more and he told me that because of the add ons I added that morning I got him one hour behind. I was speechless! And upset that I got this response . Wish he could've said it might be a while but we can work on that instead I felt panic that we're gonna run out of food. He came back 20 mins later with a nicer attitude and asked me what I wanted to add 

Over all I was stressed out. 2 hours went by quick . It really could've been great but it just wasn't enough help. The indoor playground was great tho and kids loved it. And food was pretty good. But decorations were all me. They just put it up for you. For almost $1400 spent Parents shouldn't really have stressed out",mZgrKXEr2BOyDFLZxZ3I5g,2,0,3,ChlB4tary-rnHOylcCIhBw

We got two of their party rooms and two awesome party hosts, Brian and Patricia. THEY ARE JUST AWESOME combo who made sure we are all having a great time. From the party decorations to attending to our guests, this is the place to celebrate your kid's party. Every single guest enjoyed the Scavenger hunt in the ball pit area that even the parents ended up joining. And, the amazing dance party that made us all feel like a kid again. Also thanks to Chef Randy and Amanda who prepared us some mouthwatering food that every single guest enjoyed. I can hear them say ""the food surprisingly tastes good."" And that is a plus for the parents. The sweets are just too pretty to eat!

All in all, this is far better than our pick for our daughter's party last year (Chuck e cheese).

I found this place on Groupon. 4 kids & 2 adults $36. I had never been, so I decided to give it a shot!

This place is in Southwest located behind the Autozone. It's clearly marked with flags so it was easy to find. ITS HUGE. Upon entry, they have a line for people to fill out waivers if you're a first time guest. It's all on the computer and pretty easy, so that was nice and a breeze. 

Something to note: EVERYONE MUST HAVE SOCKS. IF YOU DONT, THEYRE $3 A PAIR. 

After signing waivers, I went to the front and showed my Groupon. I know some places are weird about groupons, but I didn't call ahead and had no issues using it. Sweet! Another thing; my kid could not hold it for another second and they let him go in and use the bathroom before we checked in, so that's nice customer service on their part. :) everyone gets a wristband and you can only leave if the wristbands match. 

Finally, we're in! It wasn't packed lines but we noticed how many kids there was! It wasn't too bad though as this place is spacious. Enough space for everyone to run around. There's rows of tables/benches so everyone has a place to sit. Along the back are the party rooms, and I think I'd be a great place for a birthday party. 

The pictures will show the playground. It's sweet and definitely made me wish I had something like this when I was younger! It was awesome and I love that the adults can accompany their kids too. 

The food is good and pretty moderately priced. They offer a big menu, with someone for everyone. They even have buffalo cauliflower for vegetarians/vegans? 

Either way, I got a pizza (8 slices) and 6 chicken wings and a large drink for $16.00. Not too bad. Plus. You get free froyo for the kids before 4pm. Sweet!

I'd say this place is ideal for kids 5-10. There's a lot of them to do, and it's like a updated up version of Kangamoo (which I also love!) it's unlimited play time so a great way to spend the day.

As it turned out though I did end up running around and climbing that crazy jungle gym! It's pretty enormous so how with a ton of different types of play. No body is a fan of the whole ball pit idea but they really put some great twists on it. I couldn't believe the kids played 3 hours straight without losing interest even knowing they had presents and cake waiting for them at home. I went down the slides, shot all the ball pit guns and climbed like a child all throughout that jungle gym labyrinth. We did have a few problems with bullies so it's a good idea to keep a close eye on your kids. We reported one of them the moment the kids stated playing and the manager came a removed the child and took him to his parents. They left shortly after. All the kids had a blast! We were very happy with the experience. The pizza is pretty good and much better than Chuck Cheese! Their onion rings were excellent! The service was great and they had the while place decorated for Halloween. They even had a pumpkin patch! $5 dollar pumpkins. We took 2 home! I find the place to be rather pricey.

8AM-10PM open daily! Awesome hours! 
I have an almost 2 yr old and a 6 1/2 year old. 

Let's talk about prices first. Most reviews complain of the higher cost. This place is much bigger than typical play places that means higher rent and utilities. (Not even close to comparing to kangamoo in my opinion) Maybe this is a once in awhile place instead of a weekly thing. I did not see group rates or a member pricing sheet. General admission:
1st child $16.95 
additional child $12.95, 
children 9months and under are free, 
1st adult free, 
2nd adult $5
This should be ALL DAY play. It's not. If you leave and arrive back within 2 hours you can continue to play but if not you pay half price to get back in. 

$5 isn't much for an adult but I'd be annoyed if I couldn't play so let's go into what an adult can do. I'm a smaller adult (4ft 11in) and was able to climb all the way to the top (4 levels) through the smaller squares. I don't see how anyone much bigger would be able to but there's plenty to do! There's a long four lane slide 2 levels up adults can climb to landing in a ball pit, a ball shooting area that was our family favorite, ball pit for toddlers towards the front with slides parents can participate in, two trampoline shared area. 

The rest of the place is crawl space, things for kids to explore. We were here for three hours and I played the entire time with my kids. I really love this place! Staff were all awesome and friendly. They interacted with our kids and showed them hidden things. The staff at the snack area looked bored. Maybe a rotation would be fun for them. I found a broken zipper on a toy and they tended to it right away. We had such an amazing time! 

Snack area, I'll include a photo of the menu. They have that fancy cola machine that can make custom drinks, hello Vanilla Coke! They have 1 boba tea, coffee and several other food and drink related options. 

Birthday packages are ""a bit"" overpriced. The starting package is $565 for 13 kids and 1 adult per kid. That doesn't even get you the entire place to yourself. I was really disappointed to see this. 

I did not find the check in process hard, being new they have long lines but we were the second people there this morning. Easy basic info and accept the waiver. Done! They have bins for your belongings, they match to your wrist band number. It felt safe so I didn't worry about anyone taking my things. The window on the other side is where to go when you want to get them back, easy process. 

My suggestions: 
1. All day play for entry. 
2. There's typos all over the signs, fb and website. ""Playgorund"" for an example listed on the tv rules. 
3. Rotation for staff would be nice for them!",XdLQep9R3V7EHwW2fjgK-g,28,21,5,PTIjRB3WMDzyp7IkcuKMwA

We had to stand and wait for twenty minutes to register each kids into their computer and then an additional ten minutes to get them checked in and pay. We came on a Thursday when it's only $8 per child, which is a great price for unlimited play and a free frozen yogurt with two toppings for each kid, but I think paying more than $12 per kid on regular days is a bit too pricey (LOL charges $16.95 for the first kid and $12.95 per additional kid-YIKES!!).

The first time I was here it was for a birthday party. Their attention to detail is impeccable. From keeping things on schedule, the delicious food and the fun staff - it was great! 

I've also been here just to have my daughter play on a weekday. She had a great time!

Pros: 

VERY clean. Not just clean - it's VERY clean! 
The staff is welcoming, friendly and helpful - they all seem to really enjoy their jobs
Food is outstanding! It's nice to have more options than a cardboard tasting pretzel with fake cheese - like so many other competitors serve. They serve real food and make it fresh. 
They have ""small"" toilets for the little ones - as a mom this is a big wow for me.

Party room is laughable ($1000 2 hours) staff is not very knowledgeable. Polina (blonde girl at food station) is incredibly rude. Not knowledgeable even in the size of a kids pizza. Rolling her eyes multiple times to PAYING customers. She is incredibly too comfortable in a sense of being disrespectful to guest and acting as though she's being burdened. I sat and watched her demeanor the entire time I waited for the kids pizza and while my children ate and every guest after me was exactly as I stated... a burden to her. Not really what I would expect from a new place that should want return customers. I also waited 15 minutes just for a kids pizza... that's a little excessive being no one else had placed an order before or after me. It's even more irritating when your staff is standing around in groups of three having personal conversations and you've got multiple dirty empty dining tables. when prices are so high customer service should be through the roof.,yWQ8cCUa6_fGR5wTWVmF4w,2,0,3,xftJoEgek5DVISk3nzlyNg

I don't know if I would attempt this place on the weekend except with an older child. Even with two kids would probably be a challenge as the place is so big and I am a complete helicopter parent. The facility was very clean for an indoor playground. I constantly saw people cleaning all around. 

The facility itself is very large and has 4 stories of play areas. They have shooting airguns, trampolines, ball pits, huge slides everywhere, obstacle courses, play cars, and lots of cool lights. They do have a specific toddler area which was really nice as well. The bathrooms were clean and they of course have a changing table. They have shoes that you can wear when you walk in so you do not have to wear your socks in the bathrooms. Very nice touch. 

I know they sell socks there for like $3, but I'm cheap and shop a lot at Dollar tree and knew they had socks there for a buck, so went over there before I went in to buy socks. 

We did order some food. We ordered chicken tenders which came with a creamy balsamic type sauce and a side of ranch. We also ordered the steak bento box. The steak was super chewy and we couldn't really eat it. It also came out pretty cold. Was not happy with it. The tenders were ok, just a lot of breading on the chicken. They do offer a lot of items such as specialty type drinks including boba, juices, soda with flavors, etc. They have a pretty wide variety of food, which I don't know if I will end up trying. 

You can do their waiver form online before you go if you do not want to deal with it when you get there. I would recommend it because it was a pain trying to do it with an impatient kid that wants to go inside to play. They will give you a bin to store your shoes and any personal items.

 The check out process needs a better setup as well. I waited 10 min just to get my shoes. Most places just have cubbies to get it yourself, so much easier when trying to wrangle kids to leave.

They have many party rooms with space, seating/food area and many plush seating areas around the play area itself. Only issue I had with seating was that their party activities should I say overflowed out onto the food seating area. Their party was crammed in a small area while they danced and followed along with staff.

They have separate areas for young kids versus bigger. They also cater to a larger age group than my regular indoor playyard. Going all the way up to adult. They have an awesome and CLEAN system or keeping track of your belongings/shoes AND children. You get a wrist band that lists your #. Your corresponding box has the same number and should you lose a child in all the fun, they are able to ask the parent whose ""wearing a red wrist band with #112"" to come claim their lost child. 

There is an awesome employee named Jeremy who makes this place LIVE. If he doesn't get promoted to management then management itself is crazy! He's the ONLY reason we stayed as long as we did. 

Their entrance price is ASTRONOMICAL! $16.95 for 1st kid, $12.95 for additional kids. 1st parent is free, any additional is $5. Granted, they offer a 10% military discount, I do feel like they should offer some form of weekly or monthly pass. They have some yearly membership thing where you pay $25 and then everything you spend while there goes towards a future discount. I already get a 10% discount so no point in buying the membership because you then would need to spend $500 just to get a 20% discount. Meaning I would have to roll up on this place 18x 1st.

If you thought their entrance price was high... Wait until you look at their food prices. This place isn't worth the money spent if you can to continue to spend money once in. They don't allow outside food or drinks yet expect you to pay 5 course meal prices. They're charging Vegas strip prices 15+ miles away!

I drove from Centennial Hills. In my opinion, I'll take an indoor less advanced and far than to spend $50-75 each trip here.",QCGi-M-5vceWRUWwZcGrKA,1,0,3,P00rxfqGfpE82u8t7AxLrA

If you have little kids, I recommend you to go to kangamoo instead of this place.",H3RAZEK-iQ9MtwDu0lBlNg,8,0,1,VujLcT0JAiVX4Ekc_E7bLw

They got sections for the little ones, but even this section is super cool and interesting for my 31 year old self!  

The only downfall to this place is the sanitation of dirty diapers! Parents need to make sure their kids aren't running around in their dirty diapers...the place was lingering fresh poopy smell the first 15 minutes we were there. Lol.

5309668,2017-03-13,0,0_VT3sTwi7gorIlU36ASmg,"I have been waiting for this place to open and a finally a few weeks ago, it did. I invited my cousins and their kids to come. We arrived at 2:15pm and half of us didn't leave until 7pm. 

Place is HUGE and clean. Staff was scattered throughout and constantly cleaning. It was packed but even when it was there was plenty of places for you to play and sit. 

I have an 8 yo and a 16mo old. There were times my youngest and I were in the toddler area and it's suppose to be for kids 4yo and younger but there were definitely big kids there. Workers didn't say anything which I found weird. Big kids didn't do any harm....yet but should be avoided. 

We ordered food at 4:12pm and at 4:35pm the GM came to us saying our food would be another 10-15mins bc their pizzas are never frozen and is always fresh. Um ok. We didn't notice the time until he had said something which prompted us to check our receipt. I did ask the GM to have our pizza double cut. I went to the cafe and asked why it's taking so long and why another party received their food before us when we ordered before them. I spoke to the head cook which was Nick and he apologized bc his staff missed our check. I appreciated his honestly. He asked how he can fix the error. I said comp our next refill for drinks and a basket of fries. Basket of fries came out shortly after but it was like 15 pieces. If this is a side order that costs $3 then NVM. Not worth it. Pizza and chicken tenders were good. Also when Nick brought our pizza out it was not double cut and he had to bring it back to kitchen to get cut. SMH  Price was decent but drink prices are outrageous. 

Wish the GM took pride in his job and just told us the truth versus lying. If another employee lied and we had an issue with it. We would go to management. Him being the GM who would we go to? The owner?

Another thing, leaving the facility should have some type of security system. I walked out with my kids and my cousins kids. How do they know those are my kids? They should do a stamp thing like CEC or check if our wristbands have the same #s. This could definitely be a potential problem. 

Also, prices are higher than most places but it's big and cold and CLEAN! Regardless, I think they would get more business if they don't charge for multiple adults and if they charge a bit less overall. $16.95 for first child and $12.95 for additional kids. $5 for 2nd adult. It does cost a lot when you have multiple kids. Entrance and food would definitely break the bank and would not allow families to come as often as they'd like. 

Change your prices and I bet you'll be in business a lot longer than you think. 

Overall, it was a good experience. I understand it's their soft opening. They definitely have some improvements to work on.",kgGYqH5_wCWr3EK1rxllGw,2,0,4,tUPjN2kpIZ8mw2KMH65QsA

5367382,2018-03-26,1,0_VT3sTwi7gorIlU36ASmg,"First day of spring break and we decided to have some fun indoors since it was a little too windy outside. I guess everyone else had the same idea because it was BUSY! The check-in process is quick and easy - sign a waiver for yourself and any children who are with you, pay (or use your Groupon like we did), and place all of your shoes in an assigned bucket - yes, everyone must take off their shoes so be sure to wear decent socks! Everyone gets a wristband with their bucket number written on it so you can claim your items and also as a security measure when your group leaves (similar to Chuck E. Cheese) to ensure the right kids are leaving with the right adults. 

As soon as you walk in, there's the dining area and all of the private party rooms. You can order the standard kids play place items like pizza and burgers. But, they also have other ""upscale"" items like bento boxes and slush drinks with boba. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, mozzarella sticks, 2 icees, and a large fountain drink. Total came up to just under $32, which isn't too bad. The pizza was super cheesy but really, really oily. I don't typically blot my pizza, because it's pizza and I know what I'm getting into, but I did with this one because it was a bit much, even for me. 

To the side of the dining area is the massive play area. Tons of fun things to do - huge slides, a ""shooting"" area with soft foam balls that don't hurt at all, swings, trampolines, and even an area just for toddlers. They had plenty of staff walking around, checking every area for safety. They also made an announcement to remind the bigger kids that the toddler area was only for those 4 and under. It was nice to see staff really paying attention. Along the walls are benches for adults to sit and watch but adults are also invited to join in on the fun. 

I've been to plenty of these kids play places and I'm pretty impressed with this one. We'll definitely be back, especially since my kiddo has already decided she'll be throwing her next birthday party here.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,1,1,4,tABM-5z0LTawxekyKfWcNA

That being said , I would say that LOL is probably the best indoor playground in Vegas. This place is massive With a ton of play areas , structures, ball pit and a cool air gun system.  This place also has a soft foamy floor throughout the facility (socks only when inside ). 

I enjoy that the structure are big enough to where an adult can navigate them without waking up with a sore back the next day. I also like the steepness of the slides and how their structure has four interconnected levels. 

The place was very clean when I was here (including the bathrooms).  The staff seemed friendly and cordial. 

I didn't get a chance to try the food but they seem to have an extensive menu with dedicated ""chefs/cooks"". They also have a ton of desserts. 

The price point is probably the highest of any playground in Vegas at $16.xx for myself and my kid but considering the amount of she had , I'm okay with the price. 

PROs: MASSIVE, foamy floor , multi level play structure , multiple slides with nice inclines for a fun ride , clean , not too busy

My baby was 3 months old at that time and she was hungry too. I didn't want to feed her in front of a bunch of screaming kids or resort to going into my van just to breast feed. She informed the rest of the staff that I would be in the room (so no one would bother me) with the lights off to breast feed. Thank you! The dim lights and quiet really helped baby settle down. 

I would give it a 5 star just from that alone, but I always visit places twice before making a review... the 4 star rating is only because we break our wallets eating here. The food prices for the amount of food served are a little too high for our liking. The other reason why the 4 and not a 5 is they had issues with our members card the second time we came.

I've seen an awful decline in food and customer service. Which makes me very sad. 
I want to also mention that they use to have some stellar coffee from a fancy coffee machine. Now they have  brewed coffee that cost almost $3 a cup and it's awful. 
The food quality has gotten worse Over the past year as well. They refuse to let you bring your own food but want to force you to eat not so great food and pay a fortune. 
They say no except for outside food or drinks, what about picky kids or kids on a special diet? 
I'm not sure what happened to Joven (believe hat was his name) but when he was always here employees were friendlier, food quality was better and garbage cans were plentiful and close so we don't have to take a hike to throw something away. 
I can say they still keep up the cleanliness of the play equipment and repairs.

Ownership, however, needs to do better maintenance. The one thing I notice every time we go is how it is more or less ""worn"" and that is not down to staff, it is a maintenance issue. If they are told something is wrong they fix it immediately, the kitchen staff and food is also VERY GOOD. 
To the issue of maintenance, it is a ""corporate"" issue. They have worn out balls in the toddler pit as well as the ""foam"" balls in the shooting (airgun) area, they have a lot of the zip ties loose, the safety issue of kids sliding into other kids is an issue (and also adults sliding down into kids) and just small things. It is a great place but ownership should definitely be on top of some of these issues, they make plenty of money.",DmtgMXZTKmTILg6OyzhJbQ,0,0,3,7CyBGt1CTkOpPahrbs1uDQ

It turned out to be a great substitute because there is a lot of things for the kids to do. I highly recommend coming and spending at least a few hours in here for the price they charge. I paid almost $40 bucks because everyone has to pay. The first kids is $17, second kid is $13 and adults are $5 each. Adults can run around in the play area too but still it's a bit pricey. 

Our kiddos had a blast since there were guns that could shoot out soft balls, slides (small and big), air machines to shoot out balls, a big ball pit for little kids, bouncy animals you could sit on and bounce everywhere, swings hanging from the play area, balance beams through out the play area and it is multi-leveled so it is a bit of a workout. 

They have food in here too but we weren't hungry and all we grabbed were waters. 

The workers here were very friendly.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,12,12,3,DfP-ztq8P9KQIgbBxsrEpQ

Pros:
-The floor staff is very attentive and always seem to be watching the kids
-food! It's so nice to have an option to get lunch at an indoor playground 
-super clean! 
-hours! Open early and late 

Cons
-pricing!!! I just can't get over the fact that they charge 5$ for a 2nd adult and ultimately that's why I can only give them 4 stars
-the venue is almost too big for toddlers. Once my son gets up too far it becomes more of a work out for me chasing after him. They do have a ""toddler area"" but it is not closed off 
-no incentives, no Stamp cards 

Bottom line if you are looking for an indoor playground for a kid under 3 check out Kinderland Cafe on Sahara and Fort Apache. It's large enough to let them roam but small enough to where you can keep your eye on your toddler the entire time and they have a 10 visit stamp card for 85$.",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,3,1,4,c91TBO7Tola1fKTPCHLvvw

I loved how they let us determine what time to do the Birthday timeline and let us use the Bluetooth speaker to enhance our Birthday experience. The kids loved the ball pit, slides, and all the fun adventure this place has to offer. 
This is definitely a 5 Star experience and I will highly recommend this place to others.",r4C1eJM_pcdNFpXFc3eI9w,0,0,5,0DFQFplKCmUsYL8p_zDfGw
