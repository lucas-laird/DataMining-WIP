They could never get our orders right.  When we tried ordering online, our food was never ready at the promised time.  

Last night, we ordered the chicken salad and pork salad and again...it was not ready at the promised time. After finally getting it home, we discovered there was no pork in the pork salad. We brought it back and asked to speak to the manager. She was apologetic but offered nothing to keep our business.

Someone yelled out and said we dont have that order. She then told me my order isn't ready.

I told her about this being the second time and I if they would offer something to me for my inconvenience such as a discount,  free drinks, free appetizer? All I got in response was im not authorized to do that. I asked ""well, who is?"". Esmeralda said the manager. I proceeded to ask to speak to the manager.  The manager walked over and I explained the situation.  He said the PICK UP time was when the order was released to them. Are you serious?  Do you honestly think I am that naive that I would believe that explanation?  I said ""No, its the PICK UP time, not order release time!"". I then asked for his name, Geraldo.  Then asked him for the corporate office number. He pointed to the survey number on my receipt. Ummm that's not the corporate office number Mr Manager.

I'm sure it wasnt up to standard.  The portions were smaller than normal & the quality of the prep was sad. Im sure its because I asked for the corporate office number.

You tell the person what you want, pick your meat and toppings and then pay at the end. The service is usually good and they aren't stingy with the toppings.

Now for the food. Mark my words. Cafe Rio has some of the BEST Barbacoa on this earth. Whether it's in a burrito or topping a salad or nachos you can't go wrong. I've tried the fire-grilled chicken and steak and it just can't compete with the Pork. If you order a burrito you can get it enchilada style (covered in sauce) or regular. The burrito is huge and almost enough for 2 meals. The salads are definitely enough for 2 meals. Just yesterday I ate the greens out of the salad for one meal, then rolled it up into a burrito for a 2nd meal. The nachos are amazing. Loaded and nice crispy house-made chips.

These are great, but they can't even compare to the greatness that is Cafe Rio's Queso Dip. Once you have it, it is life-changing. I like to call it spackle for your insides. Once you eat it, it fills every nook and cranny in your stomach leaving you full and satisfied. It's hard to put how good it is in words.

It's just honestly a shame when the whole dining experience has to be trumped by people who clearly do not want to be working there and represent the company so poorly. I will honestly not be opting to eat at Cafe Rio if this is the area I'm around. In terms of what to order:

FOR HER: I always order the SWEET PORK BARBACOA SALAD. The meat is so flavorful -- I am not a pork eater but there is no contest in terms of what to order in my eyes at this place. Comes with rice, beans (black or pinto; none for me personally!), a generous amount of lettuce, pico de gallo, cilantro, grated cheese, a scoop of guacamole, a lime and corn chip strips. The creamy house dressing is straight crack! So good. 

FOR HIM: He always gets the same thing too: a STEAK SALAD. A fan of the beans, he says its best to ask for the beans on the side -- as the liquid they're in tends to make the tortilla placed underneath and the rice very soggy. He also asks for half the house creamy tomatillo dressing and half of the cilantro lime vinaigrette so that he gets an even mix of both savory flavors. He also often orders an extra tortilla. They make them fresh & by hand, and you get 2 for $0.99! 

Just do yourself a favor...
Eat at a different location. ;)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,6,3,2,159_x06V_gjWo78XWj1Dfw

FOOD
Like a Chipotle but with a fresh tortilla. That's what makes it. The chicken was also really juicy. Didn't try the other meats though. 

Chicken tacos (4 stars): They put a good amount of chicken in there. You can taste the tortilla more since it's not covered with ingredients. 

Chicken salad (4 stars): They put a fresh tortilla on the bottom. Comes with guacamole too. Only thing is the tortilla on the bottom is soggy from everything on top, so ask for it on the side if you want. House dressing is good!

SERVICE

It started when I ordered with the Cafe Rio app and they ""didn't receive the order"" but I didn't find that out until AFTER I paid for the order that had been called in by someone else. The order was similar to mine but there were some differences (regular quesadilla instead of the free Nino quesadilla). When I tried to tell them that the order was wrong they told me ""well, that's what you ordered so that's what we made"". After I paid and got the receipt I noticed that the name and phone number on the top of the receipt was not mine. I mentioned that to the employee and she, and who I'm guessing was the manager, was reluctant to give me a refund. When I finally got the refund they told me that I needed to get in line and order my food again, which I did. When I got to the end of the line I was still trying to be as nice and respectful as I could but it appeared like I was ""inconveniencing"" them. I took my drink cup and went over to the soda fountain and I could smell the dirty bathroom! With how bad it smelled I can't even imagine what they looked like! 

When I got the food home I ate half of my salad (which the meat wasn't even close to how flavorful it usually is) and saved the rest for later. When I got around to eating the rest of my salad, I felt something in my mouth that was very crunchy. Knowing that I had eaten all of the lettuce and chips earlier I started to get a little worried. When I spit the object out of my mouth I almost threw up. IT WAS A BUG! I was too disgusted and angry about the lack of customer service that I didn't even want to call and have them try to tell me that it was somehow my fault.

Cafe Rio is a crumby version of all of your local Hispanic and South American foods, crammed into one bland menu.

I was asked to stop here on my way to an event. Upon trying to order for a couple people, I learned that there is no flexibility in the items. You can take what they offer in only certain arrangements, otherwise, everything is full price and cannot be made with other toppings. 

They got the order wrong twice, then looked at me like I had 3 heads and a tail when I told them that I did not want chips, beans, and rice with the meal. 

All that stress for drastically over priced, low quality food.

BUT, oh man the chile beef is so tender. And I love the handmade right-in-front-of-your-eyes flour tortillas. I want that rotating tortilla cooker! I like how you only get meat, rice and beans in your tortilla and then lettuce and pico on the outside. It's nice if you prefer your hot food to stay hot and your cold food to stay cold. But I do miss the corn salsa from Chipotle, and I think their salsas are better there too. But I like how at Rio your burrito gets put through a toaster thing, but this holds up the line.

I also notice they put a lot more meat in the burrito than Chipotle, but then again, prices are higher. The guy in front of us ordered steak and they put a shit ton of it in there. The most popular seems to be the barbacoa pork, which we tried, and didn't like. It's way too sweet, but most Americans seem to like everything on the sweet side.

I've been to both the locations in Centennial, and I like this location better. They don't charge for the creamy tomatillo sauce, in fact they gave us two. The other location across from In N Out on Centennial Pkwy charges for it. Also the Decatur location gave us three stamps on the stamp card for some reason for getting two burritos, and the other location gave us one.

Enchilada style is not really needed, as there is a lot of salsa and cheese on the inside already, and you'll be adding on another buck for that extra splash of salsa verde on top.

Cafe Rio is kind of like an overpriced Chipotle, where you can order burritos, tostadas, etc and they'll make the food right in front of you. The meats seem kind of dry to me and the burritos are pretty plain..only meat, sauce and cheese...really? There is also no option on the menu to order just a bowl so I have to get the burrito. Did I mention it was dry? They do offer a stamp card so your meal is free after I believe 10 stamps. I never bring it in since I come here a handful of times a year. For the price at over 10 bucks for a burrito and small drink, I don't think it's that great of a place...I'll stick with my Chipotle any day",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,1,3,U7827uW1JKz5C76gSBl-tg

Their salads are what I usually order, and they can be very filling depending on the ingredients you choose. Their tacos, not so great, but their quesadillas are cheesy and gooey. 

Now, how about that service? I must have been going on the off-days when most Yelpers mentioned they've had horrendous experiences. Each time I've gone, the service was OK. During my last visit, the staff was unfocused and did a sloppy job. The lady taking my order seemed a bit frazzled and was missing steps in the ordering process. She was stressing over the shortage of tortillas and the time it was taking to make them, and she also forgot to include lettuce and other toppings to my platter. 

The other server screwed up my boyfriend's order by adding pico de gallo to his salad after my boyfriend mentioned several times that he didn't want any. After our orders were completed, the server dropped them onto our tray and went back to talking to his coworker. It really frustrated me to have to go through all that and then pay at the end, and the food here isn't cheap.

Haven't tried other offerings yet, because we almost always go for the burritos. Skip the boring chicken and go for the Pork Barbacoa or the Chile Roasted Beef. They're both very tasty options. Also, enchilada style(AKA wet burrito) is the way to go, topped with salsa verde and cheese. Drink selections there are plentiful too.

Beware of other extras and add-ons though, or you could end up with a pricey meal!
If you just HAVE TO get your sour cream, pico, or their addicting house dressing,(AKA Salsa Verde mixed with Ranch) they are big enough to share.

I was surprised that they put rice on their Nachos.  I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.

My friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.

One cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.

I'll talk about one instance I came by myself. It was around 7:30pm on a slow Friday. Good for me, no long lines. I get served my sweet barbacoa pork tostada, & I get to the part where they ask you what sauce you would like. (I usually get mild) so I said mild, the gentleman then informs me ""we don't have any at the moment, actually just the hot"". Well I'm a person that hates anything spicy. I asked ""so I don't really have a choice?"" 
""Yea we don't have any"" 
3 things wrong with that 
1. Why didn't you inform me before I started ordering what if I'm a stickler & can't eat my food without the ONLY sauce I like 
2. Why didn't you offer me an option like ""would you mind waiting for a new one"" but instead nothing, didn't even bother asking the people in the back to make any!!!!
3. No apology for not letting me know in advance or for not having it PERIOD!! What a moron. 

Already dissatisfied, I get to the cashier, PAY. & not a single time did anyone ask how I was doing, not a single smile from the employees, or an apology for not having an item that pretty much everyone uses. 
I get it you guys are 2 hours away from closing but don't treat me like I'm a customer that will ignore something like this. Mind you I'm more upset about the customer service than them really not having that sauce.

So the next day I walked in around 12:30 to see if there was anything they could do. The girl was nice enough to have them remake the entire salad. I asked for everything in it except avocados since I'm allergic. Got home expecting my normal salad. But no, still pretty bland, and still the same dressing as the night before, pretty watered down and weird tasting. Then I realize there's no rice or beans either even though I asked for everything.  I may or may not come back to this one location. It's pretty close to my house, so I may give them one more shot. Don't expect consistency. It may be good or it may be pretty bland and weird.

I usually swing by on my way home from work anywhere from 7-10pm and about 30-40% of the time they don't have something prepared or ready. I've been there when they've ran out of barbacoa, steak, queso and sauce. How do you run out of sauce? I get not cooking more meat based off the time/demand but not when you are open for another hour or two. I'm also the kind of person that doesn't go to places when they're only open for less than 30 minutes to try and avoid these issue.

Here are some guidelines:
Come before 8:00pm
If the line reaches the black stanchions just leave (guaranteed 20-30 min wait as they don't utilize the other register) unless you really want Barbacoa. That and the queso are the only superior items they have over other build your own burrito or mexican places. 
Run out of meat: Go to Chipotle across the 215. Don't reward them for bad practices make a note to tell them nicely and leave. 
I want to say a change of management would improve this place so much which is sad because I think they're relatively nice people. 
Also, please greet the next person in line or the only person in line. Doing other duties while talking In Spanish to other coworkers doesn't bother me as long as I know that you've registered that I exist and am not just standing there for a minute.

We stood there for 5-7 minutes before someone peeked out from behind a door and told him to help us. He stopped cleaning and went to wash his hands, and cracked a joke about them being closed already. Which made us feel very uncomfortable, and unwelcome, so we left without ordering.

Somewhere along the way, I became a converted fan of Cafe Rio. I say convert because I was not a fan of Cafe Rio previously. I guess all I needed to do was give Cafe Rio a second chance!

First off, the burritos and salads are huge. Bigger portions sizes make my fat girl heart happy. Second, the tortillas are freshly made. In fact, they're so fresh sometimes I have flour dust on my hands! Cafe Rio's tortillas beat out all the competition IMO. 

VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($7.79): Comes with ""double"" beans and rice. I get mine with black beans with hot AND mild sauce. This location loads the burrito up with cheese. Yassss! Guacamole comes with the veggie burrito, but I pass on that. I wish they'd let me sub sour cream instead! Also, Cafe Rio's burritos are best eaten with a fork and knife. I learned that the hard way. 

Price wise, Cafe Rio is a bit on the expensive side for a fast food burrito place. It's probably around $10-$12 per person, depending on how many ""extras"" you get.

UPDATE: OMG OMG Cafe Rio has the best military discount ever! 25% off your entire purchase. That's one of the biggest discounts I've come across at a fast food chain. Way to go Cafe Rio!   

Worth a Return Visit?
Yup.

5504352,2016-03-12,0,Wbi-x-1Nbn6LFCMOSN6F5Q,"I love this chain restaurant.  My favorite item is the sweet pork barbacoa salad. It's a huge salad that I usually share.. It's made with a huge fresh made flour tortilla that's placed in a takeout tin bowl. They add the cheese and put it in the rolling oven. Then place the meat ,beans of your choice,black or pinto. I usually get pinto, and on occasion get the black. Rice ,lettuce and sides of guacamole,sour cream,and Pico de gallo are added. Of course you can get all or none, but I usually get everything, because I like things in my salad. you get a choice of 2 dressings which is a cilantro lime vinaigrette or the house which is a creamy avocado. Both are excellent but the vinaigrette flavor just so stays on my taste buds.

They have daily specials which is a good price because it comes with a drink.the day I went it was the  chicken tostada salad which is similar to the pork salad except it's on a corn tortilla. But since they ask what meat you want, I like to get the pork always. I have tried the beefs and chicken, but the pork is my fave.

The girl had no clue what I was talking about even though a picture was right there. My wife ordered the chicken soup and ONE coconut shrimp taco, not the meal. Again we had a very difficult time explaining to 4 people she only wanted 1 taco. They put black beans in the tin; which we didn't want and threw out. They gave us a drink cup for soda we didn't take and said it's part of the meal. I tried one last time to explain ""we only want 1 taco"".  I wound up paying for the shrimp taco meal and only received 1 taco. Emailed customer service and have been ignored.

The last time I got a burrito...enchilada style. It was a gross mushy mess.  The rice was so mushy and overcooked.  It had rice, black beans, and 8 measly little strips of steak.  They dumped some green sauce all over it and threw it in a warmer.  Yuck.  Did not like. Waste of $8.79.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day!!!

I live less then 5 mins away and while I didn't expect it to be super hot I also didn't expect it to be room temperature.

This establishment is clean but not spotless, the restrooms have a clean appearance but a small odor to it. The outdoor dining area doesn't have a trash can and people seem to just leave their waste on the tables.

Hospitality: 4 Stars
The employees were kind, and made eye contact while I placed my order. However, it appears they are understaffed or lacked leadership as most were quick to the point with customers but openly joking amongst one another at the expense of the customer. 

Food: 3 stars
Consistent with quality, and flavor. Only draw back is the food isn't as good for take out. The dishes seem to get cold fast and needed to be reheated. 

Overall: 4 stars
Be prepared to be patient in line, and double check your order. The food is worth some of the shenanigans that seem to be normal with this restaurant.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,0,0,4,9GFt_sbI_abbvFZ6XiHPiA

Reason why is because when I tried to order my usual salad, they weren't able to put the coconut shrimp on it because they could only put that on tacos. Honestly, it's not a big deal to me. But when you tell me it's against the policy to put shrimp in a non taco form even when I INSISTED on paying for it on the side.. That's so freaking absurd!! I've been and dined in cafe rio plenty of times and not once have I heard this kind of policy! There were no signs indicating it at all. When I couldn't get my coconut shrimp, I asked for steak.. Then they told me it wasn't ready and they still have to cook it. There were no people at the restaurant and you still have to prepare steak?  After 7-8 minutes, I finally received my salad. The staff, overall,  looked to dumbfounded besides the cashier. She was nice lol. 

Ugh I don't know about you guys but based on the reviews here as well, this location is a joke. You're better off going to the Robertos across the street.",YN_wyoau6tTyLeF_ZHIB2Q,8,2,1,vwCKXMcRvDfyOphUVLSY0g

You most definitely get your moneys worth with the amount of food you get. I'm still trying to figure out who gets any appetizers and a meal. That's how much food you get when you order. I guess maybe if you just got an appetizer and nothing else. If you like Chipotle then you will like this place. Good food, friendly staff. This is a must stop if you've never been here before.

I flew into LV that morning and had just spent over three hours waiting at the DMV down the street, so I was really ready to eat anything. The restaurant has a pretty large space, but I feel like they really packed in the tables. Thank goodness it wasn't busy that afternoon. Since I was there during the day, there was a whole lot of natural light coming in through the windows, so it was nice and bright. The music was alright, but a little more solemn than I prefer, but whatevs. I honestly can't imagine being here late night if it's busy. It would probably be really crowded, dim and loud with all the chattering and the music.. 

There were a lot of drink choices (I just drank water, though): Strawberry lemonade, mint limeade, southwest limeade, and Horchata (which most people go crazy over). 

I ordered a sweet pork enchilada with medium hot sauce, black beans, tomatoes, lettuce and rice. The pork was too sweet. The medium sauce that came with my order was not hot at all and was totally masked by the sweetness of the pork. There were a lot of additional hot sauces available on the counter with the utensils and napkins. A LOT. I tried putting more on my enchilada, but I didn't taste a satisfying difference. 

The service and food prep was super fast. They put the meat on the enchilada, folded it, put sauce on top and threw on the beans, lettuce, tomatoes and rice. The add-ons were nice, but presentation could have been better. I mean, they literally just throw it in your tray. I didn't feel that the enchilada and the experience were worth the price I paid.",d91uV57XH-IcA_NSQMBT2Q,0,0,2,GcpUh6WdMVcPoL85pUGeSg

Also, it really was just too dirty in there for the amount of people on the clock and no body else but me in there. Management should've been on top of that, especially with the kitchen visible to paying customers.

Lousy staff.
Lousy service.
Dirty restaurant.

The food in all honestly wasn't bad, and it usually never is here. I enjoy cafe rios food. It was just the experience here that threw me off. And that in my opinion can make or break you.
