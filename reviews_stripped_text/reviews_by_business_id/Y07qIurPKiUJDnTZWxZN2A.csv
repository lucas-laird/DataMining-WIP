Get eggs/omelette any style and made to order at breakfast. That same station will whip up pasta made to order with your favorite ingredients at lunch or dinner. 
The ONLY buffet I have eaten at, where biscuits and croissants taste freshly made. 
They serve items perfectly portioned.  
Dessert selections are brilliantly fresh and delish!
I eat here whether I stay at the Palms Place or anywhere else.  
Staff is friendly and attentive. Not a huge place.  I have never had to wait in line more than 15 minutes. NOT A FAN OF WAITING IN LINE FOR FOOD!",NQT68XPL0xqxDt3EVVYylw,2,2,5,Lcir_pQQ6gJ2ij4FzXOnwg

The food selection was decent.  They even had prime rib and snow crab legs.  However, it was the food quality that was horrible.  Everything tasted either too salty or just bland.  By the looks of it, most of food seemed to be sitting out too long.  The service wasn't that great either.  Our server came by at the most two times.  We needed refills on drinks that we never got.  

The buffet does unlimited beer.  We are not fans of Miller High-Life so we decided to pass on that. 

All in all, we will never go back again.  There are far too many buffets in Vegas to venture to if we ever are in the mood.  This place just doesn't have what it takes.",EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,1,0,1,8yUCALu0ITg15HsUM-U-bQ

And when we walked in at 10.42 am most of the dishes were switched to lunch already and omelet station was closed as well. When we spoke to manager a guy name JEREMY told us that omelet station closed at 10.45 am which was a lie.

70161,2011-12-02,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"We went to the Bistro Buffet at the Palms so I could get my once every six months craving for buffet out of the way. I like to try different ones each time since it's really about getting to eat as many different tasty things at once. Frankly, I'm glad I won't be experiencing the Bistro again.

My biggest problem was that the food was bland. Nothing had spices, or even just salt and pepper. My second problem was that there were about 6-7 options for barbecued meats, and not a lot else for meat. I could have overlooked this but again, the barbecue sauce was not very flavorful.

The final problem with this buffet had to do with service. Both times I tried to get carved meat, no one was there. I waited the second time for about 3-4 minutes, and no one every offered to help me, even though they were nearby. They also keep very few pies sliced and waiting. Instead, you have to wait for someone to slice is for you. For some pies this is nice as it keeps them cool, but the apple pie was downright cold, and would have benefited from sitting out of the cooler. The only good service we got was from our waitress, who kept our six cups full, and our dirty plates picked up.

The only saving grace for me was the baklava, a special dessert for the night. If you like snow crab legs, they looked good, but no one at my table wanted to try them.

Overall, the Bistro Buffet is not worth leaving the Strip for if you are visiting. The buffets at Wynn and the Cosmo are better, even if they do cost more. For locals, I would put the Bistro Buffet about on par with any Station Casino buffet, and we all know how those can go.

One tip for saving some money, anyone with the Palms players card gets a discount if they pay in cash so that can save you a few buck.",lXCZe0xAd7DwV5aARJu92g,1,0,2,z0_X0Qygg9ru0a3mQ99Q_w

The food was nothing special.  I felt the selection was small compared to the other buffets on the strip.  The only reason this isn't two stars is because of the unlimited beer and wine that came with the deal.

This is dinner were talking about..so keep in mind that people get agitated and annoyed and cranky cause this line seems like it doesn't move fast enough and people are always cutting to get to whoever is trying to hold their place in line. 

Price - personally its reasonable for AYCE seafood night - but this isn't the best in Vegas. I'm sure you can find a better deal with better food. TIP: get a club card so you can get $6 off your meal. 

They have a variety of global foods - Mexican, Chinese, Italian, southern, Hawaiian, Thai, your normal roasts, crab legs, and then dessert. 

Their salt and pepper calamari was pretty legit. Their spicy garlic peel and eat shrimp was like crack, and their dessert were decent and flavorful.  

I do have to say that towards the end of the night, someone in the back got lazy as fcuk and started using the small ready peeled shrimp for the peel and eat (like wtf the name is peel and eat). Yes - no shell means easier to eat but the taste just wasn't the same. It was as if the flavor wasn't there anymore and it was bland and tasted cheap.  The batch with the shell tasted just like bubba gumps peel and eat and it was even better than BG's because it was just swimming in that awesome garlic sauce soaking it up. 

The roasts weren't to die for all. The lechon was so tough you couldn't even cut it down to bite sizes. 

I didn't get to try the crab but everyone and their moms were eating it.

I just had Sunday brunch at the buffet and I will say it was the biggest waste of money so far this trip to Vegas. 
I have no problem spending money if what I'm spending it on is worth it this buffet was far from worth it. 
First the buffet offers fried and baked/rotisserie chicken that's fine only if you like dark meat. They do not serve white meat and the chicken they did have was was old, cold, and dry. 
I had to wait 6 min for someone to notice that I was waiting at the omelette station only to be given a sigh like I was bothering them asking for an omelette. 
The biscuits were burnt and hard.
The steak was very though and cold. 
Overall if I wouldn't of embarrassed my friends I would of walked out and asked for a refund. 
The Bistro buffet was a total waste of money, save that and your time go somewhere else.

789837,2009-08-04,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"If I had written this review 6 months ago - there would be one and half stars and Id be counting the ways as to why you should avoid the place. The food, which looked good, with a gourmet slant, was nearly inedible across the board. I went twice to make sure I hadn't caught them on a bad day, give them another chance, but no, it was far worse the second time around. Since then, Ive avoided the Palms Buffet like the plague, even though it is the closest buffet to my house, and even though I go there several times a week for other reasons.

I have eaten at the Buffet twice in the past week (because I got free buffet comps for giving blood), and I am happy to tell all - the quality of the food has vastly improved. And the speed of the front operations as well as service has also improved. So much so, I had to personally find the Chef d'cuisine and compliment him and the staff. 

Granted, this is a small buffet, and because of the realities of buffet service, we're not giving out Michelin stars here. BUT. The fresh meats and breads are truly gourmet level. The fish, beef, chicken are prepared in ways that are comparable to very expensive restaurants, not simply done by rote. For example - they have a ""Spicy Chicken"", which looks like fried chicken  patties. Oh my god - I have not such tender chicken in YEARS. The flavors came out in complex waves, the spiciness not making itself known until LAST. The pieces were garnished with fresh bell peppers and tomatoes and cheese which did not overpower the flavor of the marinated meat and spiced batter, which I can tell is far more than flour and eggs.

The snow crab legs were tender. The popcorn shrimp popped with katsu flakes, light and tender, not at all overcooked. The Salisbury steak was meaty (although doused with BBQ sauce, not properly made gravy). Even the SUSHI. Normally, I don't like my sushi made and then put in the freezer, but the rolls were oh so fresh, very fresh fish that I would've dined all day on them.

I could go on and on - but you get the idea. It was EXCELLENT.

So, I am sad to give the reason I left a star off this review:

I am not fond of ice cold deserts, except for ice cream. Like the sushi and other pieces in the salad area, the deserts were made before service and stored in cold freezers, then taken out just before the start of service. Which is a shame, for I had fresh fruit tarts that should win competitions, cake that gave me a contact high and cream things that would sell for 10 bux apiece on the open market.

In 6 months, changes have been made at the Palms Bistro Buffet for the better. It has gone from a place I swore I would never spend my hard earned again, to a place I plan on going back whenever I want to treat myself. 

It has gotten that good. I hope it is that way 6 months from now.",djtt7Eug7FKvtAjkJ3WLrA,1,0,4,f5uzIg-KKE1oedhWZ-mZqw

797157,2011-05-11,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"Hit or Miss... 

Sadly, my fav buffet has slipped down the list. 
Misses: 
Once fabulous smoked salmon has been replaced by 'Hawaiian Fish'. Sometimes there is a wait for crab (dinner) and what is left in the serving tray is luck of the draw. There is a great self-serve coffee machine...when it is operational. Desserts? Often nothing much left. You are then forced to wait for a 'chef' to serve you pie from the case. Salad bar is usually fresh,but has always been lacking in variety and size. Sushi is very limited in selection and of only average quality. 

Hits: 
The Lebanese selections,though limited,are generally very good. 
Chinese area has a good basic rotating selection. It's nice to see the more authentic lemon-chicken over the Americanized 'orange-chicken'. 
Most dishes are still above average...believe it or not from this review. 

Service: 
Again very inconsistent. Table service has almost always been the best employee/ customer contact. Good drink refills and plate clearing by friendly staff. Now free wine/beer to forget declining quality. 
Cashiers. I almost have left on more than one occasion before even eating, having to deal with the cashiers. Hint! if you hate customer service, please go work in the kitchen! 

Summary: There has been a good 'SALE' for a couple months. It is a great value now. Give it a try again. However,if you are trying to use something like a $20 food credit from the player's card, be warned they will not honor the full value in combination with the reduced price.",n2ScZUdbmD5wTm5Hfs84EQ,0,0,3,3e5yybFvLkgIHIRWO7Rcqg

Since I had family travelling with, who are not much of a foodie, I thought of deciding upon a small yet graceful buffet without hitting heavy on my pocket. After some research I decided upon Bistro buffet. Few reasons - they are renovating - generally with renovation I have noticed the service improves, good price with Palms Club Card (free for anybody more than 21 at Club Palms counter with your valid id) and close to strip.

We reached there at 1:40 pm on a hot Monday afternoon, collected our Palms Club cards and stood in the line for an entry into buffet area. $7.99/person (regular price is $12.99 without Club card) for Lunch on weekday with unlimited Beer and Wine. We were soon seated into our table.

From outside the buffet area looked small, my initial expectation was something like a Hometown buffet. After being greeted by our waitress, I sprang on my feet and went to venture though the offerings. To my surprise, there were plethora of food from different parts of the world. They were having a Hawaiian theme so those special dishes were also there.

I started with salad bar, there were normal varieties of salads along with Mediterranean offerings like Tabbouleh, Hummus etc. On the side there were Ahi Tuna Poke and Salmon salad. Chunks of fresh Tuna and the spices in that salad was out of the world. Same follows for the salmon salad. Everything was fresh and the vegetables were crisp.

Now off to Hawaiian offerings. Kalbi ribs (yes for $7.99, with that Tuna Poke, Salmon and Kalbi - they have already made up for the price) was soft, flavorful and fresh. Oxtail soup was out of the world. It was tender and fall of the bone with right mix of spice. I mostly savored through small quantities of other seafood items (whole lot of seafood in American/Italian/Thai cuisine). Grilled Salmon, Lau Lau, whole Pig in Hawaiian style, Battered Cod, Thai Shrimp Curry, Breaded Shrimp Fry, Baked Trout, top notch out of the oven steak - are my special mentions. 

There were many more but could not divulge into everything. The best thing about whatever I have tasted was, each offered their unique taste just the way they would have been offered in any gourmet restaurant.

Finally Desserts were ecstatic. The decoration, the taste, the variety were top of the line.

Next time I am in Vegas, I would not venture out for those $40-50 buffets but will give Bistro buffet one more visit.",VTbvps0DQbnRaJJZUo2l0w,7,1,5,Kky_qMtgnlKoWYmaVDhTCA

1194213,2011-08-29,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"The best way to sum up the Bistro Buffet, is Quality over quantity.

If you spend some time checking out Palms, you'll see that its very hip and stylish. It's got some hot clubs, bars, and a solid concert venue. It only makes sense that their buffet isn't your typical americana buffet.

Their selection of entrees is diverse and a little eclectic. If that sounds like your thing, you will enjoy this place. Stuff like fried plantains, and stuffed grape leaves, and lebanese chicken. Everything I tasted was done well. But they also have some classic buffet staples like prime rib, and crab legs.

Real bacon bits in the salad bar is usually a good indication of a quality buffet. Try the tiramisu for dessert! And if its your first time at the hotel, get a players card, and you'll get $10 free slot play, and $10 match play on table games.",sOsiYjWGmS9KjAJeqyKKbQ,1,0,4,t6y-EfGTlCcpW4jK71X6-g

Some more interesting choices compared to many of the other buffets(such as Mediterranean offerings, Lumpia, etc....).

Cons:
Service can be rude
Overpriced at face.
VERY hit and miss.
Very small.

The only reason why I ever really come here is because I seem to always be in The Palms for one reason or another. While it's definitely MUCH MUCH better than it's original incarnation the ~Fantasy Market(seriously, WTF type of name for a restaurant is that???), it's still sorely lacking. Seeing that the unofficial theme for the Palms is the 7 Deadly Sins, I personally think that they decided to focus on Gluttony the least since the fat belly that results from gluttinous acts doesn't fit in with their main focuses of Vanity and Lust.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,1,0,3,FisHktCDyagoLQr1_KS6DQ

What the Bistro Buffet is, is a buffet for someone on a budget, or someone trying to take a bunch of their college buddies out for a good value, or for just an economical meal, (in my opinion). If you go on the weekends, (which is the only time we go), you have unlimited crab legs and other seafood offerings which becomes the entire meal for my wife and me. 

You have to sign up for a players card, if you don't you'll be charged I believe $14 extra for a couple for dinner, and if you pay that much you might as well visit one of the places that is a higher end buffet. You can also hunt around the restaurant coupon places if you'd like, and typically we end up paying roughly $20 total, (pre- tip), for all you can drink Miller Lite, and all you can eat crab legs for two. 

This is not the Bally's Sterling Brunch, Aria's Buffet, or the Buffet at the Bellagio, but it is a great value if you use the players card/ coupons/ and end up with a really economical, casual, fun time with friends and family, and a bunch of crab and beer.",FRR_Bwj5Es_3_OgAaJmIgQ,1,0,3,SU0cziYGRyNA0Bobcv4O9g

The Bistro Buffet is a run of the mill buffet that is average at best.  The food choices are nothing to rave about.  The quality of food is acceptable for a $15 buffet.  And to my surprise, it's $15 for dinner (assuming you have a Palms player card).  I presume that's reasonable and good value for a buffet in Vegas (especially considering that the price includes alcohol as well).  Nonetheless, this place is a miss in terms of food choices and quality.

Outside of the food, the experience was nice.  There was no line wait (but the dining area was packed).  The service is very attentive.

1494174,2013-08-03,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"This must be the most under-rated buffet in Las Vegas. We went late on a Friday for lunch, and left so full that I had to skip dinner.  By only taking a single bite out of every dish, I managed to try 33 of them - and there were probably twice as many that I had to skip.  I can say that while the meats were generally dry - maybe a result of the buffet having been open for 3 hours before we got there -, the dishes almost universally had very good flavor.  The two things I would skip altogether were the potato pancakes, which tasted as if they'd been in the fridge uncovered for a while, and the chocolate cream pie, which lack chocolate flavor.  Everything else went from good to delicious.

The stars of the buffet are the kalbi short ribs (in the Hawaiian section) and the Delmonico potatoes in a blue-cheese sauce.  If you were served those in a five star restaurant, you'd leave happy.  For dessert, don't miss the warm, moist, perfect bread pudding.  Just don't be a fool and add either of the overly sweet, otherwise flavorless sauces.  The pudding is wonderful by itself.

Other recommendations are any of the Thai curries (refreshing and authentic, the pork loin and madagascar beef, both in mustard cream sauces) and the tri-tip, which is marinated in a chimichurri-like sauce.  

Lunch prices are very reasonable, $8 for adults if you get a free Palms players club card.  Kids, however, are $10.   There are coupons at restaurant.com and travelzoo for perhaps better deals.

They just removed the discount for folks who don't gamble a lot, so now prices are $10 for breakfast, $14 for lunch and I think $21 or so for dinner. Still good prices compared to the on Strip properties but now much too high to be a deal.

On top of that, there has been a slow but noticeable decline in food quality and food offerings. From a rotating menu of delicious dishes equal to many of the better kitchens in town they have gone down in quality and now offering a processed nacho cheese stations. Instead of baked whole salmon on their carving station, they now have super fatty pork, and from gorgeous interesting salads they have changed to serving  iceberg wedges. Desserts are now inedible.

When you combine the fact that they have increased prices, dramatically decreased quality of ingredients and taste of food, and now have eliminated the discount for having a Player's Card, I think it is well on its way to being one of worst buffets in town.

When I visited on Saturday for lunch, the place was pretty empty and the food had been sitting out too long.

It's pretty clear that the management of the buffet has changed. The kitchen is no longer preparing as many interesting and usual and tasty dishes and replacing it little by little with the standard cafeteria quality pre=cooked crap of the worst buffets in town,

So although the service is still good, it can't make up for the awful combination of bad food at bad prices.

The salad bar was lacking, the Asian food - Panda Express puts them to shame, the meat carving station only had two offerings, and the desserts were just nothing to write home about...It was simply sad.

So we ended up staying for the fast buffet I have ever had. We were done eating in like 40 mins. Normally I can enjoy my food while talking to my wife. Not today, we literally had to rush out of there. My record at a buffet was 4 hrs at the Carnival buffet at the Rio. We got there for breakfast & finished with dinner lol

I came by here again and they decide to cut losses (they haven't been doing as good as they used to many years ago. No more clubs here and now changing many other things). 

So they decide no more discounts with the players card unless you get the next card level. To top it off, they changed up their menu. I was wondering why there is no more long lines to this buffet like it used to. Now i know why.

In terms of menu, they decide to make it more fancy and did a little wicked spoon buffet style (at the cosmopolitan) with the food in little individual trays. First of all, they are not wicked spoon. Second, don't think they are prepped and equipped for it as way they did it was to have silver covers to cover the serving area to place those little plates on which in turn cuts down on their selections they used to have. I loved it when they had lots more choices. Another example of not being equipped is by placing food on top of those covers, there isn't heat coming from bottom of them nor heat lamps above, which makes most of the individual dishes i got were COLD. The risotto was a lil warm but the meat loaf was cold! Lastly, don't know if they changed out chefs but some of the new and changed items are not bad while others were too salty.

They should've done a trial run of changing things one step at a time with food first then prices a little later. With the increase in prices, cut down on selections and cold foods, sucks to say but don't think this used to be regular visitor will be coming back anymore unless they change things back.",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,2,0,2,ltHEHMzjJbHrTZfoOvrNVw

We were staying at the Palms a few weeks ago and decided to try out Bistro Buffet since if you take 2 minutes to sign up for Club Palms (free) it's a paltry $8 for lunch. For that price I didn't expect it to be amazing, but was hoping it would at least be decent.

It was way beyond decent.  I wouldn't quite put it up there with Wicked Spoon or the best of the best, but in terms of quality for value, it might be tops.  We ended up eating there two days in a row and I stuffed my face with many different kinds of delicious food from beef to chicken to ham to pastas and desserts.

As someone who loves food maybe a little too much, I was impressed with the quality. Anyone who reviews Bistro Buffet and complains about it being expensive is Not Doing It Right.  For example, on Mother's Day the prices predictably shot way up, but guess which day I didn't eat there?  Be smart, people.

Hell I've eaten lunch at Wendy's for more than $8.  This is an outright steal.

I doubt anyone who isn't staying at the Palms is going to make a special trip there to go here, but if you ARE staying there, I can't think of any reason you wouldn't want to, and that's even WITH the other also very good places to eat that they offer.

Effort seemed to be made for presentation but not so much for flavor. I am not a fan of how loud this location is, right on the casino floor with a half-wall surround- it's like sitting next to a slot machine.

PROS: Lots of seafood dishes even on a weeknight, made-to-order pasta and stir fry stations, attentive service, house beer and wine included in dinner price. Even at 8:30, half an hour before close, staff were bringing out fresh food and replenishing dishes. Dessert section was better than expected.

CONS: Whoever rolled the sushi doesn't know what they're doing- even AYCE spots that are intentionally trying to pack in the rice aren't this obvious about it. Some dishes were just improperly made, like the jambalaya and paella dishes that each had unpeeled shrimp, with legs falling off and getting all over the pan. Many dishes were barely lukewarm. 

As I left, I was waffling between two and three stars and intending to round up- it's not a place I'd return without a discount, and I prefer Red Rock for similar price and off-Strip location.

I'd like to review the food but I didn't even make it in.  We wanted a cheap buffet on our last day in Vegas and this one seemed to fit the bill from the listing in the magazine from our hotel.  $7.99, why not.

I'm mobility impaired (knee trouble) but the walk in from valet was easy.  Waiting in line got a bit tough but we got to the cashier fairly quickly...only to be informed that we needed a club card or it would be an extra $5 each.   $5?  There was an upcharge at the Flamingo, a whopping $1, which we gladly paid to avoid the hassle of a new club card.  So, off I gimped to the club signup area only to wait in line 15 minutes with only five people in line.  While there one of their VIP clients came up but the one person dedicated to that area spent about 5-8 minutes trying to get a printer to work, totally ignoring the VIP the entire time.

Finally I get to the front and get a card.  I gimp back, now painfully, to the buffet.  My wife and kid are already there.  As I walk up, the cashier says, ""one club card, ONE discount...""  I blew my top.  EVERY person needs a club card or they'll be charged $5 extra?   Was my kid supposed to sign up too, seeing as she's 10?  We left, and went back to Ellis Island which had treated us well the night before.  

Casinos offer buffets to get people to check out their casinos.  Well, we went, and quickly saw the worst of the Palms.  If they treat potential new customers poorly and keep VIPs waiting, why would anyone want to go there?",itlHEnyo8j0KPI1qnX2wMg,4,0,1,yZQa9H9tE350R6LTjf6kXA

When I saw that the Bistro Buffet was only $19.99 for brunch ($12.99 with a free Palms player card), I had to give it a shot.

First observation- ""This line is taking forever!"" Granted, it was January 1st, but the medium-sized line moved at a glacial pace. We had to wait nearly 30-40 minutes to be seated.

Second observation- ""This is a pretty average buffet."" The old adage of ""you get what you pay for"" definitely rang true. Bistro Buffet has everything you would expect from a buffet: salad bar, soups, Asian food, Mexican food,Southern food, seafood, and mini-desserts. Nearly all of these options were average at best. But, hey, average tastes a lot better when it's super affordable.

Third observation- ""This server is doing an awesome job."" At most buffets, I'd be satisfied if the server stopped by more than once to check on us.

At first this place looked promising. Smelled really good outside the buffet, and had so many seafood dishes, meat galore, lots of dishes. Then after trying a few dishes, I found many of them were overcooked. There were tons of seafood dishes, but every dish was mussels and squid.

The Thai curries were good at first, but after a few bites, it was SO salty!

Carving station was hit or miss. The tri tip was actually very good according to bf. The turkey was cold. The pork belly was dry and the crispy skin was cold and hard.

The salad bar didn't have cottage cheese or beets (two of my favorites for my salad). And the fruit bowl was never replenished the whole time we were there. All the watermelon was gone, as was most the honey dew. But there was a whole bunch of cantelope left, which proves that it's gross. The wild rice salad was totally undercooked. So hard I had to spit it out. The steamed veggies in the American section was so bland. Just plain steamed frozen looking veggies. Those are the type of veggies that make kids hate eating veggies!

Another thing I didn't like was that several condiments aren't placed near the dish they are for. For example, horseradish and tartar sauce was hidden next to the salad dressings. They do have some sauces next to their dishes so this is possible, they just don't do it.

Jook (rice congee) and stewed pork belly and eggs were lukewarm due to the heating element so far below the pot. Plus the pork belly wasn't that tender. I make a better one at home.

I also hated how they wrote the dishes' name on the glass with a marker. The orangey-pink color was very hard for me to read, and thus made me hold up the line.  Plus it made it hard to distinguish which name was for what platter. And a bunch of stuff wasn't even labeled. I got this fried thing in the seafood section (not labeled) and it turned out to be deep fried pork belly. What? Yuck!

Now for the good:
What we did enjoy was the kalbi ribs (if you love this, it is worth it). A tad sweet but great with their good and sour kim chi, but totally tender enough to cut with the butter knife. The roasted whole garlic cloves in the grilled veggies platter were fantastic. Also I got seconds of the creamed corn. If the best dish at a buffet is the creamed corn you know you're in trouble.

$8 for a buffet lunch is not bad, but it's the same price at Red Rock and it's so much better!

(It's also available Friday!) My group of 9 actually sat at two separate tables. They wanted to charge us 18% gratuity for sitting together. We decided to sit apart since we were mostly going to be getting up often to get food anyways.

There was a line to get the crab legs so I didn't bother with that. However, I did get the prime rib, which was cooked medium rare. The shrimp in the shrimp fajitas were super tiny. There is also a condiment bar with different toppings for your fajitas nearby, along with tortillas. I tried to sample a little bit of everything. Nothing really stood out to me. It was just mediocre and some of the items were bland. The pasta that was out looked like it was sitting there for a while. I got a small key lime pie tart for dessert. It was okay. There is unlimited beer and wine here so I got Miller Lite, which was the only beer they had that was unlimited. 

Overall, I was very underwhelmed with the food. I'm glad that I didn't actually pay full price for dinner.

Came here around 8:15 with my parents as we just drove into Vegas shortly before that. We were feeling lazy to go look for something to eat, and decided to head downstairs to our hotel where we stumbled upon this buffet. I'll be honest, at first my expectations were pretty low. There are so many buffets in Vegas, and a lot of them are mediocre at best. And with the dinner price tag of $15, I was expecting your average-just-ok buffet. 

However, I was pleasantly surprised. Let me pre-face by saying that if you get the right things, this place is good! They're trying to do a global cuisine type of ordeal, so different sections have different foods from all over the world. There were your typical stations such as Italian, Mexican, Chinese, and American.

 I started with a salad and carved turkey. Normally, turkeys at places like this can be dry, but not this one! It was tender and moist. My dad got the carved beef and again, claimed that it was not only delicious, but also cooked well. Huge plus for the carving station! My mom then went to the Mongolian BBQ area where she had some had some fun with that. For dinner, they also have shrimp on top of your regular chicken, pork, and beef. A few short minutes later, and bam! Out came our piping hot BBQ. We didn't end up getting noodles, but still delicious. 

I can see a few of the things here being super meh such as the Mexican, soups, sushi, and some of the Chinese and Italian. I also noticed someone saying that there were no heating lamps for the food, but when we went there definitely were! All in all, for $15, this buffet is really worth the price if you play your cards right!",p8VlaSVW1cLCNA9RHNP90w,2,2,4,vYDLrFTC7vqcu_n39uyCbQ

It's a solid buffet that's suffered the slump as the casino has aged - particularly in the desserts which used to be above average and feature weird items like mango cream tarts and now just seems to have the usual buffet bullshit.

For a modern-built buffet, this line is very small too. 

The bonuses: it is cheap and has all you can eat crab. There is a Mediterranean section, though I think the quality of the Med section is terrible. There's a serve-your-own-damn-self coffee machine which makes a solid mocha. The prime rib is usually pretty great here though - they don't skimp on the seasoning for the crust which is important. 

Weird feature: unless you opt for the coffee machine you have to give them your drink order when you pay. 

Other weird feature: famous people at the buffet. Last time we saw a basketball player and someone who was obviously a hooker. A couple of times before that we saw a moderately famous rapper from the 1980s who hasn't been on a reality show and we had to explain to my dad who he was.

2703438,2017-06-17,9,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"I've eaten here, at the Bistro Buffet, once.  I was taken here because my friend, a local, knows where the food deals are, both on and off the beaten path in Sin City.

Well, I'm glad that someone else paid.  The Palms seems like a nice casino tower.  The casino floor area isn't too shabby, either, and the buffet area, right next to it, is bright and welcoming.  It must have been welcoming because there was one helluva line on this particular day and at this time slot for the lunch buffet.

I know I've got some loons who probably follow my reviews to scour for off kilter content.  Well, let's go there right away.  For some reason, the Bistro Buffet seems to pull in a larger than average Asian clientele, and it seemed that a chunk of them were locals.  So far, that's o.k.  Take note that, for whatever reason, some universities pull in disproportionate numbers of (graduate) students from certain countries.  At a major Big 10 (yes 10, not 12) school, I ran into noticeable numbers of Greeks and Austrians.  I think that it's partly a concerted marketing effort and partly a word of mouth thing.  The same could be true of this hotel and the Bistro Buffet.

That said, the Asian food offerings represented a larger than average portion of their buffet line.  Why was this an issue for me?  I don't do sushi and I don't even like looking at it.  They did have some of the basic Chinese staples I like, such as lo mein and items along the lines of beef broccoli, so I helped myself to those.  That was after stocking up the plate with traditional American food and other ethnic cuisines I tend to gravitate toward.  I believe there was some Mexican food, but not much of it.

The food I put onto my plate(s) was good, but far from memorable.  However, it was better than the lunch buffet I once had at the Monte Carlo, which surprisingly was just on par with cafeteria food.  I gave that one 2 stars.  The desserts here, however, were safe and fairly good.  The buffet was very crowded, so whatever service was conducted by a server (coffee, drinks, etc.) was a little slow but still effective.

I don't care what a deal it was and that someone took me here.  If in Las Vegas again, this buffet has been crossed off the list.  There are too many others to try.  I might have given the Bistro Buffet 2 stars but I'm going to go with 3 stars because of their deals, specials, and pricing.",_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,9,8,3,XFlnMrN1FjcIcQLSLw3xCA

So 21 bucks a person when it is normally 26.99 sounds like a good deal. Nope. Its not such a good deal when everything we had was bland. 

Me and the wifey went for dinner on a wednesday night. There was no line so we thought that was a good sign. It should of been a warning. Nevertheless we were hungry and anything was good at the moment.

When we handed the cashier our voucher, the first thing she said was that there were no crab legs today. Crab legs are only served on tuesdays along with seafood Fridays and Saturdays. Huh? Who the heck serves crab on a particular weekday? Weird. Also we had to pay 2 bucks per person for tax. Again, huh? I have used a Groupon voucher before at other restaurants and don't remember ever having to pay sales tax because it is usually already included in the voucher price.

As usual, any time we do up a buffet, we grab a plate and do a little scoping around. Some things looked ok. I came back with a couple slices of ummm well done rare prime rib? Let me explain. The outer part of the meat was so well done that it was actually crispy. The inner part was blood red. I think what happened was that they cooked it at a really high temperature so it looked like it was done from the outside. I don't think they even bothered to use a meat thermometer. If you refer to my pic, my description is 100 percent accurate. Im a carnivore so what they did to that poor peace of meat was pure travesty. Only bright spot was the outer crispy part was mainly seasoned fat which was surprisingly good because raw meat does not have any flavor. And no, I did not try to eat the super red bloody middle part. Well, maybe a little bit of outer part next to it that was medium rare. Still no flavor. 

Wow. I cant believe I just wasted a whole paragraph on improperly cooked prime rib. In other news, we also tried some of the Chinese items like Kung Pao Chicken and Chinese Spare Ribs. They all tasted the same. Dry and rubbery. There were pork spare ribs which looked like it gave me hope but it turned out like the rest only this time they tried to smother it in barbeque sauce. imagine barbeque flavored chewing gum. They had some bacon mac n cheese in a separate little bowl which I thought was kind of cute. Only problem was that the so called bacon part of it was just a couple sprinkles of imitation bacon bits. The cheese sauce itself was watery when you dipped your spoon towards the bottom. The elbow macaroni was surprisingly cooked all the way through.

For those that aren't familiar with the Mongolian style of cooking you basically get vegetables and seasoning together in a bowl. Then you give it to the cook and tell them what type of meat you want cooked with it on a round table type of grill. I put garlic and some chili seasoning on there but still could not get any flavor out of it after the first bite.

Dessert? Maybe it should be called deserted because it looks like the employees just threw some cream and sugar together and put it on display. To play it safe, we got the crème brulee. Its basically flan that has the top glazed with a torch. Unfortunately the top part of it was the only part that was cooked. As soon as we stuck our spoons into it, it was very watery and didn't have any kind of consistency all through out.

The one bright spot from our experience was that our server Rosa was excellent. She consistently filled our sodas and took our plates of mostly uneaten food away. I was thinking she was going to say something about our wasted food but I think by now she is used to seeing people not even try to finish their plates. We gave her a 10 dollar tip because not only did she give us good service, we felt bad for her for having to deal with cleaning up all this bad food on a nightly basis.

In the end, the only things worth mentioning that didn't disappoint were the crispy seasoned fat renderings from the prime rib and our diet cokes which I was surprised was not flat at all the way things were going. The only thing that I can think of that would be worth the price we paid would be that if you were an alcoholic then the all you can drink wine and beer would be right down your alley. I don't drink so im not really sure if getting wasted at a buffet is something special. Bottom line is I DONT RECOMMEND EATING HERE EVEN IF IT WAS FREE! Shame on the Palms for letting a piece of dump like this exist in such a nice casino hotel. Memo to whoever from the Palms that might respond to this. Go ahead. I would like to know your explanation as to why the food here is so horrible. Oh, and don't bother offering me a comped meal. I don't think I can eat there any more because me and the misses are now traumatized and might need therapy. If we do, maybe you guys can foot the bill. That's the least you can do.

I'm not gonna lie, you almost lost me at that 30 minute wait and open seating for about 50 people. I felt myself getting hot! with anger. But the good news is, about ten people left the line! Which now puts me third to next! Score..

So the price for a buffet breakfast was about $7 and lunch is about $10 perfect Pricing!  Seems like the cheapest buffet in town! 

Same setting set up as most buffets, same process of the line. Great selection of breakfast items, all your basics were covered. Bacon (check) omelet station (check) waffles and French toast (check) donuts, yup and grits! My favorite (check) 
I was able to see and enjoy the lunch buffet as well just due to the time I got inside was a little in between time, I noticed great dessert selections, a cutting board of ham, I seen soul food like greens, yams, catfish, Mac and cheese, hush puppies, all my Asian favs like orange chicken, egg fried rice, pad Thai noodles, pot stickers.. all the basics covered! 
I would come again for the price and bring a magazine next time for the wait! I was not prepared for that",8hbMyONy7kQEVosswobVtQ,8,3,3,kqqcA9ZTY2ZCY-kQ1xT7_Q

I received 1/2 off, so figured I would try it. Guess what? It was $11 still...and not worth $5 unfortunately. 
Some feedback to the buffet staff. Keep clean utensils on the buffet...EVERY single one was sticky and dirty to the point of being gummed up! Disgusting...cannot get past how filthy it was.  I even brought napkins up to wrap handles...had to leave a couple cause they were stuck. Wow.

The food quality was just ok. Some items were very good, others...should have just not had if they were going to be done so poorly.

Although they had a variety of food, it did not look fresh. The food looked like it had been sitting out, and was not refreshed. I am not going to eat, nevertheless gorge myself on something that looks unappetizing. I suppose you get what you paid for. If I was staying on the strip, I would not venture out of my way to go to this buffet, and if I stay at the Palms again, I will not return to the Bistro Buffet. If you are a visual eater like myself I would steer clear of this place regardless of the price, but if you are that kind of person who will eat anything then this is a good place to go. 

One thing that I found very irritating about the line to get into the buffet was that they did not make hotel guests priority. They had two lines for non-hotel guests, and hotel guests, but it didn't matter because they just took one group from each line after another.  I think that if you are staying at a hotel, then the hotel guest should be the first priority to getting a seat.",eFMFHZdc3-QjEC_wn3JQew,1,0,2,wyO-VhANsiZbMWzjbYUGZg

The food quality is really good, especially the mini portions served on individual plates like their mac and cheese and creamy polenta dishes (reminds me of the Wicked Spoon). They also have 3 carved meat options with a crunchy outside/tender inside pork belly, turkey and roast beef. The dinner menu has a NY steak that is excellent, super tender and flavorful. The only reason that I wouldn't give this place a 5th star would be that there isn't enough excellent dishes  (like the steak) to be a perfect experience, although everything is above average.

The desserts are pretty good as well with the only complaint being that there's no ice cream, only the standard buffet soft serve fair. I like their waffle cone for the soft serve and their mini eclairs.

Dinner was good, don't get me wrong. Pretty good selections. The only thing is that every night is seafood night. At least during the weekday so the price goes up to $25 per person. That's a little steep for this place. 

Now, breakfast! My wife and i arrived 30 mins before breakfast was over. They had really good selections and the food was fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed it. And for $8.99...that's awesome!

2956082,2011-06-22,2,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"Sorry but honestly, this is a pass.

The crab legs are probably the only noteworthy dish here, except they seem to taste saltier and saltier as I go to get more.  Do they intentionally marinate the crab with the saltwater it came with so the customers get tired of eating it? I don't know..

The Asian dishes are terrible, like always in many buffets.  Even the dessert section was pretty sad.  A couple of standard cakes here and there, a ice cream machine.

The western section was pretty alright, they have a modest variety of meat.  Also the pizza was pretty good, thin crust and cooked crispy to my liking.  But it did little to help the experience.

The thing that really blew this place for me was the service.  Yeah, the service.  How you can get bad service from a buffet, you ask? As I was reaching to grab a slice of turkey, the chef snatches the thong from my hand and gives me one that was cleaned up.  I understand they might be busy and just want to cycle out the meat crusted thongs that's been lying around all day, but seriously, at least ask for it..I can hand it over to you just fine, you don't need to snatch it from my hand :[

As for the waitress, my cup remained empty for I don't even know how long.  Waving my hand in the air in desperation does little to help.  And the salty crab legs didn't help either.  I would've choked on my food if I didn't calm it down with some ice cream.  I know it was lunch time and it's a buffet, but I've had better service at much busier venues.

All in all, not really recommending it.

PRO: Some variety, Palms is a relatively nice venue

Selection was decent for Sunday brunch, which included seafood options and beer or champagne as well. 

We weren't rushed to finish right away when we were dining with the grandparents. Honestly, we must have been there close to 3 hours...

They do not offer discounts for regular players cards (just the higher level card members).

I know there is a lot of lazy people out there that want to enjoy food with very little effort needed.  So let me just get this off my chest, I HATE WHEN BUFFETS CUT THE LEGS IN HALF.  Not only is the meat cold by the time you get back to the table but they are dried up.  The only way to eat crab legs is keeping them whole and cracking them yourself.  I know what people are thinking......""I hate cold crab legs and that is the only time they are whole"".  WRONG.  AT the bistro buffet you get the whole cold crab legs and hand them to the cook.  He then will steam them for about 1 minute and the result.....perfect hot crab legs that I miss so much.  Well done bistro buffet. 

In addition to the crab legs all the other food is amazing and cooked perfect.  The selection is huge and I would highly recommend this buffet before some of the other expensive ones.

On a side note, always be aware of your surroundings for dangerous crab leg crackers.  Its very easy to get shot in the face by some crab meat.  Its happened to me many times.  My girlfriend has gotten the best distance I've ever seen.  She cracked a leg and meat shot sideways over this guys head about 5 feet and he had no idea this happened.  I spit my wine out of my mouth because it was so funny.  SEE it can be so much fun eating food :)",KOhY3tPR-YBZJNrjxrDCVQ,7,5,5,7aQzcZ478EhHDmu1MW2yuw

Selection is pretty good. However the pizzas were kinda dry and bland. My number one beef with this buffet was that damn coffee/cappuccino maker! Now I love the idea that you can make your own latte, mocha, French vanilla, hot chocolate, etc. just by pushing a button and placing your cup beneath the nozzle. However, this machine malfunctioned several times: would only fill up the cup halfway and would spurt coffee at you. I didn't realize it until I sat down: found coffee stains all over my new dress. So fail. 

Wouldn't come back.

It's usually a problem to find food that's delicious for the price you pay.  I've tried their breakfast buffet & left unsatisfied with our money back. 

8/26/14  at 4:30 pm on a Tuesday.  I was surprised,  staff was in a decent good mood except for the cashier, Ivelina. She wasn't happy, greeted us but she was very short with us. Wasn't personable at all. That's not a way to set the mood of the customer's buffet experience. 

I tried the mixed greens first.  Added black olive, chick peas, mushrooms & very light Italian dressing. I was kind of grossed out by the serving spoons. I had to get the attention of the lady wiping down the counter.  I did let her know they were filthy & she thanked me for letting her know.

Then I made tacos in a lettuce wrap. I saw the iceberg chopped lettuce in the center with tomatoes.  I asked for assistance so I didn't touch the food. I grabbed big iceberg leaves, added black olives from the salad bar.  Went to the taco station where I skipped the refried beans, wasn't impressed the last time it was watery hardly any beans in it.  Added taco meat,  & shredded cheese on top. 

Round 3 I was lost what to try next.  Had a slice of tri tip (over cooked) & ham on my plate. I was looking at the chicken parm dissatisfied with the selection.  I guess Robert could read my displeasure on my face.  I really love chick parm but it's breaded & usually has what flour or corn starch. 

Robert strikes up a conservation with just asking how I was.  I replied ""good, but disappointed"". He asked why?  I told him the selection is limited for someone with food allergies.  He said I should try the Mongolian cook to order station. I said I wouldn't know where to start I don't normally eat Mongolian.  I'm not adventurous, ha. Creature of habit. 

I grabbed brocoli, peppers & sprouts (I think they look like white roots). David came right over & made the cook to order meal with beef & chicken because I couldn't decide. He asked me why I was disappointed, because Robert mentioned it.  I told him the list of allergies.  He shook his head,  asked me before he put anything on the meat if I could have soy. I said it was fine. He added soy sauce to them & teriyaki. 

Really great service. I can't remember our servers name shoot. She was from El Salvador. She saw me wiping my hands with my own wet towelette.  She set down on the table 4 more because she knew I had complained about how sticky the serving spoons were up there.  She was the sweetest. 

Your staff is so kind.  I wish the cashiers were as delightfully pleasant as the rest of the staff. Still 5 stars just because the price is right & service was excellent.",_ykg4Fp8j_tU83q2tYC2FQ,4,0,5,N_WF-HACsfgCLRtDppAfIQ

Once paid, we headed to the gate where we wait to be seated. The hostess asked how many we were so i told her 20 but don't worry about moving seats and tables because we can just sit in the same area without moving anything. She said she will try her best.

Then, this very RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL floor manager (FAITH) comes and said she cannot sit us together since we did not pay the 18% gratuity fot more than 10 people.

They advertise NY strip steak at the buffet on a large video screen. 

Not wanting to miss super bowl I checked out the Buffett at lunch - they had steak. So I picked this for dinner during super bowl .


It was super bowl Sunday and at 4pm right when the Buffett opened. I asked about gluten free options. They were few  gluten free protein choices other than steak and chicken wings . Most of the staff didn't even know what gluten was, that's howpoorly trained they were.

So I patiently WAITED for the NY STRIP steak to come out.... No steak.  They never intended to serve ANY NY STRIP STEAK AT ALL DURING THE ENTIRE MEAL! BUT THEY STILL ADVERTISE IT! I saw some during lunch and they are tiny pieces about the size of a regular McDonald's hamburger bearing no resemblance to the steak shown on the video ads and in the hotel rooms.

The restaurant doesn't have butter, just the "" butter flavor"" liquid they use on popcorn. Took them 10 minutes to go to another restaurant to get butter... And they serve corn on the cob! 

No food was ""kept to temperature"" 140 degrees ( all was cold- no steam)   , cold despite me coming in right when the Buffett started and the food was cold at the core too . Many items like the corn in the cob, chicken wings, ribs were previously frozen .

Indian casinos do a much better job. 

$22.71 to be bait and switched from NY STRIP to chicken wings. It made my super bowl a crappy experience .

I asked the hostess for a refund and she said she would get a manager - the manager said ""We NEVER ISSUE REFUNDS"" 

I think this restaurant is representative of the Palms Experience you can expect here . I have stayed at South Pointe which is lack luster compared to the rest of the strip , I gotta say South Pointe is a far better experience . We personally know George Maloof ( a friend from Aspen Colorado) who would simply not stand for this.  

I then asked the hotel to credit me and they also refused. Don't expect American customer service here .

Too bad The Palms has become a place for "" low rollers "" only.

Don't say I didn't warn you about this Buffett .

Unfortunately that's where my negative review starts. They claim on Groupon that the normal price for two is $90+ and that you're saving about 50% buying a Groupon for $42. When my girlfriend and I went to the buffet to use the Groupon, I was sorely disappointed seeing the normal price at $20.99 per person. So I pretty much spent the same amount when I thought I was getting a good deal.

Second, in its Groupon description it mentioned prime rib and crab legs. But we called ahead assuming that they'd have those premium items on certain nights only. I was right. Prime rib was on Tuesdays while Seafood was on another night. I elected for prime rib. Another huge disappointment was seeing roast beef where the prime rib should be. Not trying to be a food snob, but roast beef is NOT prime rib. 

Its sad cause the actual place looks comparable to the elite Vegas buffets. They even use that new trends that the nice buffets have in plating some of their signature dishes in separate little plates and containers. But as nice as the presentation is, the food is mediocre at best. It took me a lot of walking back and forth for me to pick up my first item cause nothing really appealed to me. 

The only thing that wasn't terrible was the service. We got our drinks and refills when needed. And our empty plates didn't sit on the table long. But I wasn't surprised since the buffet was only 25% occupied. I guess its cause most of Vegas knows to stay away from this buffet. As should you.",yU1TBUbI85SaIMN_EZnjQg,6,2,1,1CX7qQqFR63syBUqjLDW7g

I get it, it's the theme of the casino, but doesn't really pop for me when looking for a place to eat.  In this case, we went for the dinner.

Anyways, as buffets go, it somewhat small, as even many Indian casino buffets seem larger.   The food was decent, if uninspiring.  Nothing really stood out taste wise and the look of the buffet itself had a look not unlike a school cafeteria.   The buffet was rather lightly attended, patron wise, which made for a least a more relaxed sitting.

What bothered me was that the help seemed really uninterested in their jobs.   One chef/server actually turned and walked away as  I and another approached the dessert bar, as if he had something better to do.  The guy manning the carvery saw that, stood at the meats for a while then came over, shaking his head.  Whether it was from thinking of his coworker or being bothered by having to cover for him I'm not sure, but it doesn't make for the greatest experience for a diner.

The table waiter did okay, neither distinguishing himself or taking away from the experience.

There may not be many options, but what they got is cooked perfectly. I was surprised to see that they had Pad Thai here and it was pretty good. They also had Curry chicken and the chicken was very moist. They had Ribs and Korean Short Ribs which were both tender and had that fall off the bone goodness. I was in heaven.

They have a whole turkey dinner with all the fixins. The turkey and the stuffing were very moist and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were nicely seasoned with herbs. The mac and cheese was amazing!!! Super cheesy and super tasty. I would be happy with just these options, Like a nice home cooked meal.

The only thing they don't have a good selection of is dessert. They have standard pies and ice cream. It's okay though. I was so full from all the deliciousness that I didn't have room for dessert.

I've seen the price drop from $32 bucks to now $12.99 with your stations players card. I was warned to do only breakfast or lunch but after vommiting from the dinner buffet for an hour I learned the hard way. 

Service: Even at 7pm on Friday there was no line no waiting. However,  I didnt get served a drink till 20min later and two rounds of food. It seemed a little busy inside with kids.

Food: The salads looked ok. The menudo like dog food. The soups and desserts looked stale. Nothing special with asian or italian section or sliced meats.
The pizza tasted like rubber. The mac and cheese was actually really good. 

Drinks: I opted out for soda and got weird smelling orange juice. This was exchanged for apple juice which tasted better. I miss the alcohol that was once here.

I've had the station's buffet at Red Rock and Green Valley which is not bad, but this venue was more like Palace Station. If your stomach was built for Caesars Bachannal buffet,Cosmo or Aria then this place might be a problem.

They offered tri tip, ny steak, and Kalbi ribs along with their usual meat carvings (ham and turkey). They also offered Lebanese dishes that day as well. Oh! Hawaiian pork and cabbage and oxtail soup was offered as well. Hooray! I was so excited.

They have a nice selection of desserts. Usual pies and cakes. They have brownies, cookies, and baklava as well. Best part though was the latte and coffee machine! Sweet.

Only downside was that the food dries up sometimes (like the pad thai. Dont try the pad thai. Not worth taking up stomach space for) and the serving spoons and tongs were SUPER hot that I couldn't hold them. Mainly because they sit under the light for so long.

I agree with Kevin K, the buffet has a nice open feel with good service, but the food will not overwhelm you.

But is it the best food I ever had for under $20 and sometimes under $10, just about. I stayed at Palms Place last weekend and as we explored the Palms Casino we saw this buffet. I noticed that if you got a players card(free), you could get points and discounts at food places including the buffet. Seeing that the buffet breakfast was under $10 and there was a champagne brunch with seafood on Sunday for $19.99, I knew I was coming here for a couple meals.

Breakfast only- They had the basics like oatmeal, grits, eggs, bacon, fruit, cereal, etc. but they also had Asian inspired breakfast dishes and I thought those were really good. If you've ever stayed at the embassy suites and had their free breakfast...that's what it reminded me of.

Brunch- It had all the breakfast stuff PLUS a taco fajita section, Thai and other Asian dishes, a carving area, omelette station, Oysters, muscles, crab legs, shrimp, and desserts like cupcakes, tarts, ice cream and bread pudding. I think the highlight was the included all you can drink champagne and mimosas. Other people may have given this buffet lower ratings, but I've never paid under $20 for all of that (one drink in vegas is $10 and up).

Atmosphere- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of buffets because I'm funny about germs and people coughing or licking their fingers while touching stuff, but I survived my experience here. Yes it does have a cafeteria feel, but as you can tell from what I've said before, I'm eating here for the value. The place was clean and servers were nice...good enough for me.

All in all I think this place is worth having a meal at. You're going to spend the same thing at a fast food place so you might as well get all you can eat and more selection.

At first glance, you might mistake this place for a hospital cafeteria. After your first bite, you'd wish you were in one. Shrimp cocktail minus the cocktail sauce, pasta noodles sat out for so long they were actually stuck together in one clump, and I do believe the only part of the New York steak they served was the fat they trimmed off the steaks served in one of the fancier restaraunts at the Palms. Food had been dropped into other food dishes and strewn about the buffet counter and no one bothered to clean it up.

Every food item we tried (steak, fried chicken, ribs, pasta, etc) was wasted because it was inedible. The desserts were ok, with the creme brule bordering on good.

I had some Thai red curry chicken, a piece of thin steak they called NY sirloin, some Hawaiian style pork, shrimp pad Thai, among other things.  The curry chicken was about the best thing I had.  It had a good curry zip but not enough to intimidate those who don't like spicy food.  I would have liked to have had spicier, but then it wouldn't appeal to the masses.

Since we were at the end of the lunch time frame, desserts were flying of the shelves en masse.  What was left was good.  Mostly mini cupcakes and mini cake squares.

Now, the Bistro Buffet has turned into...I can't say it any better...a Station Casinos buffet!  Really, it has.  And right now for the most part it's pretty BLAND.  Either it's the transition of ownership, or the fact that right now the buffet is open 24 hours because the café is still under construction.  The food is really not on par right now.

We went for dinner and the price for a near The Strip buffet is actually very cheap.  So I guess we are supposed to consider The Palms more of a locals casino now?  Price reflects that.  But come on guys...the FOOD!  Work on the FOOD!  It is very reminiscent to me now of my days of the Dining Commons back when I was a UNLV young'un.  BARELY decent.

Dinner menu was OK but seemed fairly limited.  The salad bar looked nice & fresh, but the other stations looked just so skimpy with dish choices.  There's a Mexican station, an Asian station, an Italian station, an American station (more like a carving section), and a Mongolian stir-fry station.

I had some spaghetti and meatballs and honestly it was alright.  Sauce was on the watery side and light on flavor.  The Asian section didn't fare well with me either, everything looked like it came from a package or a box.  The fish I got was dry and flavorless too.  The carnitas were decent though and thankfully not dry (thanks pork fat).  The best thing I ate that night was the create-your-own Mongolian stir-fry...probably because technically I made it?  LOL!  It came it a pretty red bowl too, probably a reason why it tasted better than most of my meal.

I would definitely return again because it is such a great price for a buffet. You won't paying for this place after your done. 

Quality food for a great price. Selection isn't huge but I personally don't mind because usually the quantity makes the quality go down. And also if theres too much food then you can never really taste anything. You end up just sampling a bunch of stuff. I would take quality over quantity!

It isn't the absolute best buffet in Vegas BUT it is the best valued buffet. It beats paying 30 for an underwhelming buffet. For example the Rio wasn't as good and it is way more expensive.

4260158,2013-04-15,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"This review is for 4.5 stars. We went for lunch (11a-3p) recently, last last saturday (crowded- many people were using a promotional mailed coupon), and I was pretty impressed (I do NOT use this word a lot with many area casino buffets, mind you) with the overall quality of the seafood (not dry, rubbery, or bad tasting) and the asian food (I avoid these dishes at most buffets because they usually fail), as well as having a large variety of offerings- salads- green, ceasar, fruit, & pasta, mexican- make your own tacos, enchiladas, and bbq- ribs, fried chicken, etc.- there were more ethnic choices, i just didn't get everything, I'm a little picky at buffets. I usually find the quality at most casino buffets as average or nothing special (there are a handful that I would go back to- rio seafood, sam's town, the M resort, bally's). But this one really stood out- I'd even come here without a coupon, $12.99 for lunch (get the Palms club card). (Especially since we went to The Orleans recently; a very sharp contrast.) 

Let me tell you which casino buffets I've visited over the years of my residency here in Las Vegas: Rio's Carnival & Rio's Seafood, The Orleans, Sunset Station, Boulder Station, Palace Station, Texas Station, the M Resort, Terrible's, Fremont, Main Street Station, Imperial Palace, Sahara, Circus Circus, Bellagio, Fiesta Henderson, Treasure Island, Sam's Town, Bally's, Tropicana, Harrah's, Stratosphere, and the Stardust. I may be missing some other ones in this list. But I just wanted to show you how many I've been to, in town. Yes, that is a lot. I'm not saying I am expert or anything; I just wanted to let you know that I do have a lot of comparison/background.

This said, there were several standouts here for me- the beer battered cod- perfectly browned white fish, not greasy either, tri tip, freshly carved- juicy, not fatty, and just a little pink (usually there is a big layer of fat at other buffets), seafood paella- not over-salty, with a good amount of seafood, and the steamed clams- which were not overdone, while my husband really enjoyed the mac & cheese (had just been prepared, and was uber-cheesy) , the fried rice and the cod. There were many asian dishes, and I sampled the shrimp pancit (signature Filipino noodle dish), which was pretty good, considering I hardly ever touch asian dishes at casino buffets- I am really really picky about having Filipino food, because my family cooked it really well, and was not very greasy. There was a Mongolian station (you select your raw goodies and the chef prepares it in front of you) and a dessert station- mini iced cupcakes- red velvet, chocolate, and shot glasses (*samples, because they are only filled halfway) of tiramisu- mmm!, along with creme brulee, and an ice cream station at the very end (to the right). So, we were full, but not over-the-top, but we always do some walking after a meal.  

The atmosphere/ambiance is surprisingly elegant for a casino buffet- rich browns and silver metal. Not many casinos work on the decor aspect of seating. I also appreciate the fact that the dining area is somewhat private in that people walking through the lobby can't fishbowl into you stuffing your face (unless they peer over the wall). Food areas are pretty clean and maintained pretty well. Plates are easy to find- middle front of the floor. The staff is attentive. The beverage server was nice and did stop by a few times. The only thing I didn't like was there was so much ice in my iced tea. I scooped out the excess and placed them in the dirty bowls or plates. Someone came by often to get the dirty plates. Because it was crowded, it was pretty loud. And our baby slept through it all! 

My strategy with buffets in general, is I take a small sampling of unknowns (1st time-tries; this way, I don't waste much food), so then if I really like something, I return for more. I also limit my plates to a couple. If I still have some room in my belly, I take a small selection of desserts. I learned a long time ago, if I eat too much, I get bloated and feel icky. 

This is a Yummy thumbs-up. I'm pretty picky with casino buffets. I was impressed. with this one. We do plan on coming back, and soon, too.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,4,0,4,ibLn7aRete4q5pp2bUv8Ew

The salad bar is pretty pathetic (but you'd be wasting your money if you spent too much time at the salad bar anyways).  Dessert bar is a bit boring too.

The food here is subpar and the servers are hit or miss. The pricing is weird, it depends on which level of players card you are BUT if you have a coupon you pay the normal price which is crappy.

I've had brunch and dinner here and both are pretty much let downs. 

Brunch has the normal items, salad bar, omelet area, and desserts. Before they used to serve NY strips and had a carving station with ham and prime rib but that is no longer offered. Instead you get omelettes and pretty much no protein anywhere. The majority of the items have been sitting there for a bit because they have the weird glaze over them.

Goods:
Salads
Pancit
Pancakes
Country fried steak (which a lot of places do not have)

Dinner does have the carving stations and all the regular fares.

The service here is hit or miss. We came here for brunch last week and 2 servers attended our table of 2... but very sporadically. They were more interested in the larger groups of people... thanks for that.

For starters - the price is not bad. I see other comments on here about $21 for a buffet. As a hotel guest I typically get a $4 comp applied to my bill. The most expensive thing I had here was brunch, which was $14.

Overall I'd give this buffet a 5 out of 10...it's good food, kept fresh, but it won't win any awards.  

Here's a rundown:

PROTEINS

These vary from day to day with some items remaining consistent. You can expect a variety of fish - usually sea bass and in some cases a whitefish prepared different ways. There's roasted turkey and either prime rib or brisket. There is almost always some form of bacon (hooray!) and I personally enjoy the turkey / beef hamburger patties when available. 

BONUS: On Sundays you can get unlimited snow crab legs!

SALAD

There's an expansive salad bar that's kept fresh. You can find just about whatever you'd want from a salad bar here.

CHINESE

There's a small chinese food section of the bar. This seems to change items day to day.

DESSERT

As usual, there's a wide variety of dessert options, from full sized cakes to mini cheesecakes. There's also ice cream, etc. 

BEVERAGES

The restaurant has a very nice look to it. It is modern in appearance, and has an upscale cafeteria feel about it. It is one of the smallest buffets that I have been to in Las Vegas, but getting seated was not an issue. 

The food was not very good. Most of it was cold, and tasted as though it had been sitting around for hours. Condiments were very hard to find, and the whole setup in general seemed disorganized. The one highlight from the food selection was the crab legs. They were fairly big and pre-cut to make them easier to peel open and eat. 

The other highlight of eating here was that the service was excellent. Our waiter kept our cups filled and cleared our dishes whenever we finished a plate. He was very accommodating and was able to help us with whatever we needed. The service made up a little bit for the food being sub par.

- I was with children age 7 and 3.  The three YO ate for free.
- I was with my husband and our meals came with our room at the Palm.

The good things I liked about this BREAKFAST (won't be going for dinner or lunch) buffet:

 - the QUALITY of the food was good.  Everything I got was tasty.
- my favorite was the Thai congee.  I know that sounds weird, but I seriously can have congee everyday for breakfast and never tire of it.  I was apprehensive at first, but it was seasoned extremely well, simple, but really delicious.
- wasn't the best omelett station I've seen, but the service was quick and friendly
- our drinks guy was the best.  He quickly served our drinks, filled them up when they were just 1/2 way down, and took away our dishes literally the SECOND we were done.  That's TOP SERVICE.
- it was a clean, non-trendy, not flashy ambiance.  I don't know about you, but when a place start to create too much ambiance, I start to wonder about the food quality.
- they have a good selection of what I call ""southern breakfast"".  Biscuit and gravy, chicken fried steak and gravy, fritters, home fries with steak, etc.  My husband esp. liked that.
- it's kid-friendly.  How many places can you say that about?  Though our munchkins were the only ones around, they were not shirked at for being loud kids or anything.
- it also has a good selection of ""cold stuff"": yogurt, granola, lots of fruit (though I only saw maybe 4 different fruits total, they were all naturally ripe and sweet), etc.  So if you're wanting to eat healthy (oh yeah, they had oatmeal and crack of wheat, too), this is a good place to go.

And when you think about it, $9 for all of that is NOT bad at all.  I spend $9 at IHOP or Marie Calendar's and I would NOT get the kind of selection or even quality I experienced here.

I definitely would eat here again for breakfast.",NLCaCHNVMmQPakXpWIF_sQ,2,0,4,bzC_Sf_izMllrOFTphg8Ag

I could go on.... We had such a great experience here!  So don't believe the negative reviews!  Also, we got the travelzoo deal and only paid $35 for two at this place.  Such an amazing deal!",73aPoG7ssBYxhrOCnhwvRg,0,0,5,B8ckrr0Otw5uUCD3cLzQ6Q

And this came a day after I had a disappointing lunch at Bacchanal at Ceasar's Palace, which is known as ""the best buffet in Vegas"" right now. Don't think so! I felt ripped off after spending so much at Bacchanal and enjoying myself more at Bistro.

The complimentary wine and beer aren't great, but hey, it's free booze (if that's what you're looking for). I didn't drink much of it, but the food made the experience worthwhile. The Asian section in particular was wonderful (great orange and sweet & sour chicken), and the curry and pad thai were my favorite! Best yellow curry I've pretty much ever had, believe it or not. My only gripe from this buffet was that the desserts were absolutely nothing to look at, but that's probably better for me anyway since I was stuffed from two plates already.

I'll be back for sure! The line is a little hefty but overall great food, great service, great bang for your buck :)",COUfiZtTTKyTPPZVMwzOcQ,1,1,4,S9Oc91sOIdfJoG-xzu11Cg
4411673,2016-04-18,1,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"A $8 buffet masquerading as a $22 brunch buffet.  Honestly, I've been here before and don't remember it being this bad. We went on sunday for the brunch. The line wasn't long but it took forever to get in because there is only one cashier. Request to our drink server for a set of missing utensils was ignored and after flagging down another server to no avail, I finally walked up to the cashier area where they had a couple of forks and got it myself.

A walk around the spread and I couldn't believe how stingy they've become. There were hardly any options. Sure there are crab legs, but barely defrosted stringy crab meat is not really my thing. I believe wine and mimosas come free with the sunday brunch but we don't drink so it's worthless to us. The salad bar was paltry, as were the Chinese and Mexican sections. There was no carving station. The only fish options were tilapia and catfish. One person was manning both the omelet and the Mongolian stir fry station, so you can imagine the wait.  Of the little plates, I tried the lasagna and the chile verde. They look fancy but taste subpar. I used to like their bread pudding, but there were only some dried bits left at the bottom of the tray. I kept waiting for it to be refilled or a fresh batch brought out...and it never happened. There is nothing left to redeem this buffet in my eye.

Our server (yeah the one that forgot to bring me my fork) walked by a couple of times and not even once bothered to re-fill our empty cups with water. Yup, Bistro buffet, I think this is goodbye for good.",ZKwO9lkpAnOnQlBL1fXf1w,0,0,2,_BuBWy1aBsZ2TZJkWBQUVQ

I started with the desserts.  I tried a mini Creme Brulee, mini apple tart, mini cream puff, and mini chocolate eclair.  The Creme Brulee had a crunchy burnt sugar topping.  I ended up eating 4 of them.  The mini apple tart was pretty with the lattice topping.  The 2 other desserts were meh.

Its a great deal. It really is,14 dollars for an all you can eat buffet? After a long night out on the strip? Sign me up! I wish I could say it was as delicious as it is affordable.

There were a few dishes that were downright fantastic, the BBQ Pork Ribs were mouthwatering and delicious, and the Dijon Meatballs were quite tasty as well. But overall everything seemed to be a little too salty, a little too dry, or a little too tough. A shame since last year (before I was a yelper) I would have raved up and down what a hidden gem this was, apparently things change and not always for the better.

The service was less than prompt, but when they did arrive they were kind. I wasn't expecting much. The drink selection is good including beer and wine, so again, great bargain!

I can't eat any of that stuff without white rice. On my second visit I found the white rice in this big silver pot near the curry. I finally got the nerve to try the curry and it was excellent!  It had just enough spice and the texture was nice. I also like that they have a station where you can customize your own chow mien. 

The dessert was always tasty here and it still is! Even though the Buffet was smaller than most there are a few items that are made really well here. I can get full off rice, chow mien and the curry alone!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,4,1,4,x1Ull9epYw3pIzQsfndfpw

4523308,2013-06-26,2,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"First off, sign up to be a card member (even if you don't want to gamble, DO IT). Then go for a lunch buffet. You get $5 off of $12.99 so you basically pay like $8. 

First dish I go for is their salad (this is a weird habit of mine that I always start off with salad). Their salad selection is decent. They basically have everything you need. I added romaine greens with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, olives, and beets with Ranch. On my way back, I also get their clam chowder. It was VERY VERY salty. Also, it lacked a lot of potatoes. However, there were a lot of baby clams (I guess to make up for their lack of potatoes). 

My second round, I try their porridge (because I'm asian I just had, to). It was terrible. It was too wattery and had a ton load of msg. I'm used to homemade porridge without msg, so I have an especially good taste bud for msg. Bottom line, don't get it. 

Mexican selection: overall not bad. I think it was the best out of the other cuisines. I tried their chicken enchilada which was very tasty. Their carnitas were also good, tender and moist but again, VERY salty. Interestingly though, they had no guacamole... How can they not have guacamole?!?!

Asian selection: The typical asian dishes. I tried their orange chicken. At least this tasted better than Panda Express ... Potsticker was alright. The stuffing (not even sure what was inside) was just ok ... They had a lot of fried food in this section. Bottom line, as an asian person, I think their noodles was the best thing there.

Pizza: They had like 3 different types of pizza (pepperoni, mushroom, and cheese). I tried their cheese. It was decent. Looking at the three types, I can see that they lacked toppings though.

Thai: A good variety of curry. I tried their yellow shrimp curry because it was the most worth it. Basically a lot of peeled shrimp with curry. I would recommend getting this.

Tri tip/Pork belly: Make sure you ask the carver for the good side. I got my meat rare. Had a very good meat taste with loads of juice. So good .... Pork belly was better though. Although very fatty, the skin was so crunchy and meat was moist. 

Mongolian: This section is pretty good because you can create your own noodle with whatever veggies they have and with a choice of three meats (chicken, pork, and beef). even though I was super full, I had to give this a try. With my stir fried noodle, I added onion, mushroom, bean sprout, chicken, and a spoonfuls of garlic. The chef cooked it in front of me. The final product smelled SO good. It was probably due to the amount of garlic I put. Bottom line, try this section. You can add however amount you want, so no lose here.

Finally, we move on to their desert. Tiramisu was small which was perfect size. I like it. It was sweet but not overly sweet. Lastly, I also had their flan. It was also small but a perfect size. The flan tasted similar to their creme brulee. 

In conclusion: It was just an OK buffet. Nothing to die for. But for the price I paid ($8) it was well worth the selection. If I had to pay full price I'd be 50/50 about coming here. Overall, Palms is pretty off the strip so who would wanna go off the strip to come here? But I guess if you were to stay around here, this isn't a bad place. I would give this place a 3 star, BUT because they had unlimited red wine, chardonnay, and beer for what I paid, I gave this place a 4 star.
***Their serving spoon was pretty dirty. So there were many times my hands would be greasy.

Did not sample the crab legs, which seems to be their most popular item. (Too much work for too little payoff)

Not at all a gourmet salad bar but had adequate options of fresh produce to build a healthy salad (think greens, legumes, nuts) vs. a hoggy salad (think meats, cheeses, eggs, pasta/potato salads, etc.). Some of the highlights: 3 greens options (spinach, mixed greens, romaine), tomatoes, mushrooms, kidney beans, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and decent dressing choices. Lots of fresh fruit as well.

I did not try many of the hot food options but I really liked their pizzas (2-3 different types), tofu with brown sauce (Asian), and Mexican options (chips, salsas - Pico de Gallo and tomatillo, onion/cilantro mix, etc.). Desserts were standard GFS options but really enjoyed the ice cream with candy toppings. 

Clean restaurant and friendly servers.

No ""Wicked Mac and Cheese"" or fancy Sliders with gourmet sauces.  This is good old Americanized International Food.   Orange Chicken - one of my favs.  The pizza is actually a thicker type crust - a nice change from this cheap, er, I mean, gourmet pizza's some buffet's try to pass as pizza so they can validate their higher prices. They had normal (OK, to me that means Americanized) Mexican meat so I enjoy a nice soft taco.

Do they have as many selections as others buffet's?  No.  It is a Seafood Buffet?  No, although they do have some seafood.  While their desert area is small, it contained pretty much everything you needed.  Heck, even the Bellagio has gone to soft-serve ice cream now so don't expect Gelato at this level.  (Check out the pictures, you can see they have individual rows of items instead an entire tray filled.  It's possible they have any many deserts as bigger buffet's, they just don't place it all out in front of you.)

This buffet is also reasonably priced.  Again, no $39-$54 price point like some others.  If you earn enough points, I think you also earn a free buffet that day, but don't quote me.  These offers change quickly.

*****
Now that I've been seated & had my first plate of food, I'm much less anxious, but the above review is still correct & im not going to change it.

The bistro buffet manager was apologizing to people in line, and I believe I overheard him telling people that on Thursdays they now offer some sort of senior citizen discount, so that the place is extra-busy on Thursdays.

If that's the case, then the establishment should plan accordingly, having extra staff on hand.  Again, there were plenty of open tables of various sizes -- what bogged things down was just one cashier & perhaps not enough servers.    Instead of apologizing, the manager should have been managing the situation by helping the cashier or seating people. 

I'm used to lines, especially at buffets. But the problem here is the unreasonable length of time everyone had to wait in line.

Even the bacon was horrible. How can you mess up bacon?! They only got two stars because their free WiFi is much faster than the one at the Palms.

5121664,2011-02-19,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"I whole heartedly believe this is one of the better buffets in Las Vegas.  The food is varied and tasty, the prices are good and the atmosphere is also nice!
We like coming back here whenever we go to Las Vegas, we know for sure we won't be disappointed.

We usually attend the lunch buffet.  This is because I'm not a fan of shellfish and lobster/crab etc, which is usually the difference between lunch and dinner buffets, so we tend to stick with the cheaper lunch buffet rather than pay more for entrees we won't be eating.

Anyway, the selection @ the Bistro Buffet may not be as varied as other hotels, BUT everything is good! It's a case of quality over quantity. (But don't get me wrong though, there is PLENTY of food to choose from!! Any picky eater will find something to eat!)  They have a small salad bar and a couple of types of soups to choose from, they have an International station which usually features a taco bar, mediterranean cuisine (such as falafel, lamb gyro, lebanese rice, tahini sauce..... & more.. usually a chef's special), Chinese food (eggrolls, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, a couple of soups), a really tasty carving station (very nice, juicy turkey, prime rib.... and ham) with the proper side dishes (today was whipped potatoes, deep fried creamed corn (yum!), gravy, stuffing....) and an American food section with various meat & potatoes dishes, like chicken, steaks, sauteed veggies etc.

THEN .... there's desserts.  Their dessert section is awesome.  First of all... frozen yogurt machine.  All the ice cream you can eat. I mean... no buffet is complete without it!   They also have a good selection of petits fours, cookies, puddings & Jello.... but the best part about the dessert section at the Palms is their bakery counter!  There are probably 20-30 different types of cakes and pies behind that counter, and upon request you can have a slice (or more) of whichever cakes or pies you choose.  They're not stingy so if you wanna sample 10 cakes, they'll let you.  So far, any cakes/pies I've had there have been nothing but excellent.

Service & staff at the Bistro Buffet is always very good, their waiters are always nearby to top off your drinks & clean dirty plates.

I know there are probably better buffets in Las Vegas, such as the Bellagio and the Wynn.... but if you combine price AND food and take all that into consideration, I highly believe that this buffet deserves 5 stars.

We went on April 12th, a Tuesday, when they were supposed to have crab legs. Not only did they not have crab legs but they still charged ""Seafood Tuesday"" prices and replaced crab legs with old gray rancid tuna nigiri in a boat. More than one person who took a look at it while I was up there commented about how unappealing it was and that they'd be afraid to eat it...embarrassingly disgusting. Management should look into this, it's that bad.

They also changed the quality of the New York strip...was thinner and less tender than before...no thanks.

There was also a film coating some of the individual plates near the wok station that shouted out ""Hey! No one's touched me for hours, please throw me out!""

The only reason this experience didn't get one star is because the short, elder brunette lady server who takes care of our drinks is super friendly and always an all-star.

 We went for lunch, and I am sad to say the great buffet of the palms of about 6 years ago is gone.... the decor is nice but does it matter if you want anything good to eat? Nope.
 The lebanese was the best thing there, a lot of the food is stir fry, fried and greasy or not cooked right. The cut beef was so red I almost named the cow it came from. I didn't dare touch the salad bar since the desserts looked old.
 The macaroni and cheese looked great but was so salty it was disgusting, as in it made you wonder if someone just dumped the salt shaker over while cooking it. Um exactly how can you mess up mac n cheese???!! ( I believe the complaints about the breakfasts).
 All in all it is worth the price and it's still better than Goldcoast unless they've stepped it up since I've been there last.

I have recorded a full STEADY HD video of the Palms buffet on my youtube channel or you can click on the link below or go on youtube and type ""Slow and Steady Palms buffet tour.""

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnji8NWzYzQ


Very Cheap Buffet in Las Vegas in term of quality food like on the Vegas Strip. Dinner usually costs 21 bucks, but with your Palms reward membership card you can eat dinner for less than 13 or 14 bucks.

I went there this past presidents' day weekend for dinner and enjoyed the buffet for only 13 bucks with Palms card. What makes it so good was the fact that you get to enjoy snow crab legs for only 14 bucks instead of paying more than 30 bucks for dinner on the Vegas strip just to eat Crab legs.

The buffet is very small compared to other hotels. But, it's still somewhat the same amount of food as other hotels because they put a lot of food on one table station.

The dining room area looks very clean and modern. The desert bar is somewhat small but tasted good.

The server was great. He would always come and clear the plate in the most efficient manner.

As I said above, if you want to see how the buffet looks like before you go here the video:

The texture of these two items were so similar to the soft texture of the creme brule that it was hard to distinguish between the three!

Anyhoo, it was decent food. Just the typical breakfast food. Breakfast food stops serving at 10:30am.",y59Xrg0WcjNsXtmXbYwXgA,0,0,3,s6n_Y9Rei2-1vseJhkFxhA
5662690,2014-04-14,0,Y07qIurPKiUJDnTZWxZN2A,"The Bistro Buffet at the Palms Hotel is REALLY GOOD. 

We get two free breakfast buffets with the room each day and it's always good; even the biscuits and gravy are good and that's hard to find in California or Nevada, even in a country café. The bacon is very tasty, too, as are the grits. 

The dinner buffet is also very good. We haven't been there for a seafood buffet (Tuesday, Friday and Saturday nights) yet, but by most accounts it's worth every penny.

Notes on the dinner buffet:

The tri-tip is a bit dry and  tough, as is the Chinese BBQ Pork, but I've only had each one once, so I don't know if they're always on the tough side.

The Seafood Linguine is a must-have. Other Yelpers noted how good this was and they were right. It's so good I had seconds.

Hubs loves creamed corn and he said this was the best he's ever had. He's not wrong. I wish they'd give out the recipe for this; I'd definitely make it at home.

If you go on a night when Steak Diane is on the buffet, you've hit the jackpot. Add mashed potatoes (be sure to put some of the Diane sauce over them) and you've got a scrumptious meal. I had seconds of this and was tempted to go for thirds.

I also had some bok choy that was very good and a tasty spring roll. 

The dessert selection is small compared to other buffets, but I never have room for dessert anyway... EXCEPT for the bread pudding with whiskey sauce.

Special note about the bread pudding with whiskey sauce: HAVE SOME. Then have some more. This stuff is addictive. It's almost as good as the Golden Nugget's (THE best I've ever had).

Now, before you eat at the Bistro Buffet, be sure to sign up for the player's club card. It's free and with the card you get a discount on the buffet. You'll have to pay cash to get the discount (along with the player's club card), but it's a good deal so do it. NOTE: Each person over 21 has to have their own card to get the discount.",M1fHucXZNwdxNUjoidP6GA,4,0,4,aJeDAZuMn22qC3YKeZ_hIA

The prime rib was cooked a medium well so it wasn't too bad but not great. It wasn't too tough to chew and it did have tons of flavor.. maybe because I put tons of aui ju and salt. =) Their sushi selection wasn't great but the ones they had were tasty. I felt they could have put more sushi in stead of having the roll be 85% rice. The snow crab legs were great...very sweet and easy to open. Their desert area was pretty good.

For the food itself, we went on the seafood night. The crab legs were okay. Everything else was pretty terrible. The risotto was sour. You can taste that the quality of the food is low and I had suspicions that some were going rancid.

You certainly can't compare it to the Wynn or Wicked Spoon or Studio B. But for what I paid and the zero wait, I would definitely come back.

This is one of the smallest casino buffets I've ever been to, not that many tables compare to other buffet. I really enjoyed the Seafood congee they served at both breakfast and dinner.

I really like the Palms incentives you get when signing up for their player's club card. You can get some great food promotions and neat free gifts as well.

We really enjoyed this buffet more than we were expecting to as I had read the Yelp reviews prior and still decided to check it out. Maybe my expectations were so low that it ended up making it seem better than it was? 

I like the free beer and wine! The ice cold Miller Light in a big tall glass was Awesome and enjoyable with our dinner.

The food was hot, fresh, tasty and the selection was good! I really liked the cantonese/chinese selections. We got super full as we tried a lot of items. Everything from fried shrimp to pad thai noodles. 

The desserts were very good, my sweetheart really liked the mini apple pies. I liked all of the desserts as they paid extra special attention to detail and flavor! Mmmmmm yum!

If you get there expect to wait in a line to pay & also to be seated. The buffet is open 4-8pm, I think. We got there at 4:15ish & there was already a line there. They need a bigger waiting area for the people that have already paid & that are waiting to be seated because it was just sooooo cramped by the time we paid. We were combining with line that has yet to pay. 

When we were seated we went for the kill. lol. They have little sections for different types of food, ie: American, Asian, International, Mexican... etc. 

I lose at buffets I only ate one plate & a bowl of miso soup. The miso soup was pretty good but how could you go wrong with miso soup, right? Had their salmon which was yummy! Their egg rolls were alright, my mom's is better. lol. I'm a little biased. 

Their dessert buffet was soooooooooo bomb! I had their:
Mini Chocolate Eclair: YUM!
Mini Banana Cream Cupcake: YUM!
Mini White Chocolate Mousse: YUM!
Mini Creme Brulee: YUM!

The Chinese food all looked better than it tasted as the beans and noodles were undercooked but the mongolian chicken was excellent, nice and tenderized. The pasta was overcooked to the point that the penne fell apart and there were dry bits as it had not been turned in a long time but the tomato sauce was excellent. The lebanese chicken and rice was a definite hit and the prime rib and yams were good too but their whipped potatoes looked like glue and the pizza crust was not very good. Their sushi was sad, it looked like yesterdays all piled onto a mound like a mess, they shouldn't even serve it. Their crab legs were warmed up, the way I like them, and they even had crab openers. There were a ton of pies (not my favorite) and other deserts that I didn't care for but their soft ice cream was very tasty. 

My favorite of all was the automatic hot drink dispensing machine. It made the most large, strong, great tasting Mochas I have ever had from a machine and I went back several times, I wish I had one at home.

Decent variety, not the best quality. Very inexpensive. Beats Denny's for a similar price.
___________________________________

The first time we stayed at the beautiful Palms Place (NOTE: allow me to reiterate that the Palms Place is not the same as the Palms Casino Hotel, which apparently is now partially renovated), we did so in 2011 thanks to a Bloomspot deal for $109/night  that included a studio suite, $50 at Simon and breakfast for 2 at the Bistro Buffet.

The original price for this buffet was somewhere around $7-$8 or so, which is appropriate for the type of food they served. IMO, this buffet is a better alternative than Denny's. 

On the plus side, they offer fruits and other healthy alternatives for those of you who either like to start their day with something a little healthier or at least balance out the epic carbage with things that might possibly contain vitamins.

On Mondays-Saturdays, breakfast is available from 8am-10am. They take all the food off the buffet tables for 30mins then switch to the lunch menu at 10:30am.

We stayed for 2 nights but only made it to the buffet once, since the 10am cut-off was far too early for a typical Vegas day.",BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg,5,3,2,jT7Xvbl0bDL1nA2HRaVRCg

But I'll give it a half star more for the reasons below.

Bang for your Buck.

Why? Well, let me start off by saying that I've had dinner here and it's $20 a person...sure you can do better with $20 in Vegas but if you're looking at buffets in Vegas, $20 is on the inexpensive side. Now that your expectations are set, this is what you should know:

There are no lines...I mean really, unless you are staying at the Palms you wouldn't go out of your way for this buffet.

However, this buffet is better than almost any buffet you could find locally. (If you're into veggies, Souplantation is where you should really be headed)  But other than that, you'll come here and find a decent selection of items for your stomach's disposal. You do not get the variety or international flavor at say a Paris or Bellagio, but you can focus on....

ALL you can eat Crab Legs, Prime Rib and Strawberries. This is where you'll eat your money's worth (which is hard to do at other buffets).

But I kid you not, if you have some energy and willing to spend more you should head on over to the Rio buffet. In fact this summer there is a deal where you can pay $35-$40 daily  for unlimited access to six top buffets in Vegas (Paris, Rio, PH, Caeser's etc.)",7fBJkqfPSIm50MT7lMHxvQ,0,0,2,3zTZjp0ePqgrGAH5jDk94w

There really isn't much to say about this place. The food is just ok, bordering on blah. It's on par with the buffet at Palace Station or Gold Coast. Just generic food that wasn't particularly appetizing and lacked any sort of appealing flavors. 

I stuck with the crab legs, which weren't particularly fresh or tasty and made sure to make my price of admission back with juice and soda refills! Hah The service was good, our waiter came by to check on us regularly with refills and to clear away plates.

Luckily, we had a coupon, so this is the only reason we ate here. If you have a comp or a coupon, by all means, partake... otherwise, just walk on by.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,1,2,7DBNbGcwwYUD8qRajKl1RQ

The food is so good and cater more to Asian  side. Their cold Crab legs are fresh. Their hot Crabs in Oyster Sauce (too die for!) tasted like how it is in Jakarta. They also have Kahlua Pork and some other Hawaiian dishes which not very common to find.
