Food is great as always, just be patient, it takes a while from the time you order till it's served. (20 to 25 minute wait) Otherwise the wait is worth it.

I forgot to take pictures, next time. My favorite is the house Kitfo, an Ethiopian version of steak tartare.",8SxkPsBBN9EbTRKShDUv1A,2,1,4,WYe9pPIligzlIHnRN82KeQ

1503551,2018-04-09,10,F6ScBoyzVPhuvyJUUdUZ9Q,"For those who like eating with their hands*, Ethiopian food might be your new favorite thing. Platters of flavorful mixtures are served atop and alongside rolled injera bread that you tear and wrap around individual bites and pop into your mouth. If you haven't had it before, Merkato is a good place to check it out.

Indoor and outdoor seating available, along with a menu that has options suitable for most dietary restrictions- the vegetarian in our group enjoyed the samosas (beef version also available) while the pescatarian loved the fish goulash (great grilled flavor!), I devoured the house kitfo (basically beef tartare), and we all shared the veggie platter (make sure you get the tomato firfir). Pricing is extremely reasonable, $10-15/pp with generous portions. 

Location is in an industrial area and can be hard to find. Service is attentive but Ethiopian dining is a social event so expect to ask for the check as you will be left to socialize as long as you like. Traditional coffee service also available!

*Okay, sidenote: in Ethiopian culture, you actually are only supposed to use your right hand to eat. Thanks to Brian G for droppin' the knowledge.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,17,4,B1Gkf5yubyTm1v2KEKJMXw

We had the #11 (veggie platter), #31 (meat platter) and a lamb dish. Veggies and meat all on one platter. I must say...I enjoyed the dinner.
Music-Set the environment and chilled the mood.
Decor-Awesome and authentic
Cool points- There's this fancy coffee thingy that smells INCREDIBLE, even if you're not having coffee. 
Best part- We got taught how to eat our food the RIGHT way w/o utensils by our wonderful hostess. She was so sweet and helped us figure out what to order. AWESOME. 

Verdict??? Will return ESPECIALLY for the coffee ceremony. $20...seems awesome. Total spent $40ish for 3 people and SIGNIFICANT leftovers!!!!",WQjwX2ln6fFgl3HgaiOuHg,0,0,4,9BP-6FQoh5BIVWvN_9XuJA

This is a little hole in the wall place and it appears to be run by a family. I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food, so we gave it a shot. We were the only people in the place and were greeted warmly. We didn't know what we wanted, but the girl taking our order helped us out. We got the vegetarian combo with the grilled beef (see my picture). 

The beef was wonderful! It is seasoned and spicy, but not super spicy. The beef was served in the middle with all the vegetarian goodies out the outer part of the platter. The vegetarian dishes were super delicious as well. It was a lot of beans, dips, potatoes and spinach. 

They serve the platter with a basket of Ethiopian flat bread (called Injera). There is no silverware or utensils, you unroll the Injera and pull off a section, then pick up the beef and other sides with the bread. The Injera is a spongy kind of bread with almost no flavor, it has more of a practical purpose. That platter of beef and the sides was more than enough for my wife and myself. Very filling and absolutely delicious.

One thing to note is that there was no ice. This has also been my experience in Indian restaurants as well. I had two Diet Cokes and they brought me the can and an empty glass.

What a fantastic find, love this place. If you want to give Ethiopian food a try, come here. Very highly recommended.",p_V_zLZgw7nvR5XDeilU_w,4,3,5,daDKiNXo3G5uZ3Mk2uRv-Q

I have not seen another restaurant offer tomato firfir. Thinking about it makes my mouth water!
Service here is fast & great as well with friendly employees, and the menu is easy to read and to choose from.

Portions were smaller than I remember, food was generally less seasoned or spiced, and it was runny (veggie combo). Some of our old standbys were missing. It was like a different restaurant and cook/chef altogether. Service was slow and inattentive.  Really disappointed. 

The real kicker was when we got about 15 minutes away, my husband started to complain his stomach hurt and felt strange. Fast forward a few hours and now, I am sitting up in bed after taking pepto with a burning feeling in my stomach and hoping I don't throw up.

Unfortunately I never left a review until now after they've moved to the new location off Trop on Arville. I'm not a fan of this new location. It's a third of the size of the old place and the food tastes different. I've been to the new location twice and both times didn't compare to what I've grown used to from the old restaurant. I'm guessing they have a new cook??? On my last visit I ordered the vegetarian sampler. It was just ok. There were a few items on the platter I wasn't too fond of. With the samplers they change the options often and they don't list exactly what each dish is. For that reason I think I'll keep trying other places until I find the perfect sampler lol! I hate wasting food especially Ethiopian which I love! I'll likely come back here for the Tibs and Special Kitfo which I love but not for the veggie sampler.,s-y7Mm6s3LjaF4fvdxE7cg,1,0,3,GClTyqQkce9H0SXn5mVl8Q
