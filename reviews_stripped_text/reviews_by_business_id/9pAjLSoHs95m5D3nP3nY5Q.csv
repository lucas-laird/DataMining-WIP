Out of cookies...out of oil! No avacado. All at 11:30 am! Before lunch rush even!!",QVg9LF4bWScS6emi3qQoDw,0,0,1,JLGIBAHUzkT3JkTPcjoKbA

Whoever owns this place is proof that its hilariously easy to make money in america. If this owner can keep this embarassing subway open, anyone can succeed.",3PG9sm9f9qgXll8HdbAobg,0,0,1,GmYCl24MXHRDvY7Nki1NlQ

Extra to not have meat I have never heard of it in my life do not go to this location the staff was not nice a women in front of me ordered the same special and did not want the cookie so the lady said I have to charge you full price for each think which is $5.70 instead of $5.00 once again charged more for less I don't get it at all,Rt6AYMONWgSPEO4XHsxFlw,0,0,2,5thDKsaUhKElSFcFlL_agg

Husband ordered Italian Hero, she had no clue how to make it, even though the sign has what kind of cheese goes on it. Finally go to pay, she can't take our phone number for the reward program THAT EVERY SUBWAY DOES! So we see the REWARD card sign-up and ask to start a new one since she doesn't know how to enter a phone number. NOPE. THEY HAVE THE REWARD CARD NEXT TO THE REGISTER AND SHE SAYS THEY DON'T DO IT AT THIS SUBWAY?! THEN AT LEAST DO NOT ADVERTISE A REWARD CARD PROGRAM AT THE REGISTER. Absolutely disappointing and frustrated at the lack of not only bread, but customer service. And a broken panini machine. So trashy in such a nice neighborhood. You'd think the owner would take some pride and fix the machine! Three times false advertising at this place. DO NOT GO HERE! Drive the extra mile and find a NICE, FRIENDLY SUBWAY!",E7FXwHNl1ItIpANnoP3wTQ,0,0,1,6DlXOhBvJn6QsAWYgYZtZQ
2406695,2011-03-22,0,9pAjLSoHs95m5D3nP3nY5Q,"I have lunch about 2 or 3 times a week at this Subway.  What I am most impressed with is how clean the store is and that they have low staff turnover.  In the last 2 years I have only seen 4 employees here, and they remember what I like.

When I come into the store they immediately greet me and start making my sandwich.  This is extremely important if I am on the phone and can't take a break to order.

Of all the Subway stores in Las Vegas, this one is my favorite, so 5 stars!",Khk-EmlzFBCFjSWIMuNt3Q,1,0,5,KDqmmPEpYbKkgeR7eggNUA

As you walk in there are two Hispanic ladies that just stare at you in a weird way then just ask ""what do you want,"" no customer service at all. As always, they never have buffalo sauce. Maritza can't hear so I raised my voice, she then gets defensive telling me to not yell at her. To make matters worse, while making the sandwich, she has a very dirty apron, when she bends over to get veggies, her apron touches the sandwich which grosses me out! Don't recommend coming to this location. Consistently annoying during the mornings. I have a better experience when I come at night.",cYbHhHesPLYZPiLVw-UmmQ,2,0,1,OXjeDoD9uJYPwGB1Y6B5zw

There's another on flamingo I usually go to, but I was nearby so I came here... there were bugs on the banana peppers, what looked like mold on some pickles, and half of the vegetables were frozen because they're being kept too cold. The lady who worked here clearly did not give a shit about her job. Dude, what the fuck, this place needs to get shut down and have something at least halfway decent built in its place. Whoever owns this location should be goddamned ashamed of themselves, and the subway franchise should do a better job managing and overseeing their franchise owners. Get a regional manager out here to fix this shit or shut it the fuck down.",FPnlsxJ0gHyGBA6l1si6aA,0,0,1,kCW_I0Vq9GwMflfUwnbgJw

Sing it with me!

FIVE...FIVE DOLLAR...FIVE DOLLAR FOOT LOOOOONG!

Yes, I am singing.  My choice is the Oven Roasted Chicken Foot Long on Nine Grain Wheat Bread. Make it toasted, with provolone cheese, onion, bell pepper, lettuce, tomato and sweet onion sauce.

The restaurant is nice and clean and the people behind the counter are extremely friendly.

Where to go to lunch today?  I definitely would agree to Subway any day of the week.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,0,0,4,73e3jYCfh_elR4o3MYN5AQ

4224401,2017-07-28,0,9pAjLSoHs95m5D3nP3nY5Q,"This subway is conveniently located in the Walmart shopping plaza by Panera Bread, and Panda Express. I usually visit this location after the gym when I am to exhausted to cook dinner for the night, but from my recent experience I will just go to Panera instead. I often visit the store two hours before closing and there is no line. 

The store is somewhat clean but I feel that it could be a lot cleaner. The employees are somewhat nice because they greet you when you come in but hold little to no conversation with you while they are fixing your food. On my recent visit they were out of turkey. How does a sandwich place that specializes  in sandwiches don't have turkey. The employee told me this after I was half way done with my finances order.

On my most recent visit I felt as if I had received horrible customer service and the women simply hated her job. Other times I have visited this location and their was a man working and he was so nice and friendly and the restaurant was always clean.  

I am unsure if I will ever return to this location.",dIHHaoF-yyIvBFEOyEQ8Pw,0,0,3,Vt29xcgLoOaFZUhUQJFAVA

I ordered a salad and asked for all spinach. I like the way they mix the salad and break it up into small pieces. The lady that was making my salad was generous with the toppings as well and I appreciate it when I don't have to ask for more. The salad was really yummy and I was surprised at how much I liked it b/c the last time I had a salad from Subway was years ago and it wasn't nearly as tasty. That could very well have been my fault, but irregardless, I'll be back for a healthy lunch on the go.

I do wish they had some patio seating here, but Panda Express is 2 doors down and they have a large outside eating area out front if you care to venture outdoors.",NYDvprxYyDm1dJj8g_G0RA,0,0,3,U-3T0U5jvROnF5f9TX-12g

We are semi new to this area and the last two times we went to this location the ladies that work there in the day time are so rude and none caring !! They roll their eyes and have no customer service skills what so ever... They don't even put the right amount of meat on the sandwich and the bread is dried out and doesn't taste good at all... It wasn't even busy and this is the way we were treated BOTH TIMES we went!!I don't suggest going here but that is just my opinion... Horrible customer service and we will not be returning.,IPbbNLGFFekq1qk08xSNdA,0,0,1,2lNZSgBc5Sqajw7iBqL4lA
