I took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    While the pizza was worth $10, I would've felt a little ripped off had I paid the normal price (closer to $18 I believe).  The dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- I found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  While there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just ""so-so"" such that I don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  Such is the case here.",4BN6fq_Glvkgx6Su8dUiAQ,0,0,2,whUo85dM8pg0RUMvjMH3hw

The cheesy garlic bread was good with a hint of garlic and good layer of yummy cheese! Also, enjoyed it because it wasn't greasy at all, sometimes restaurants put too much butter on the bread, making it soggy- this wasn't the case.  I enjoyed the pizza sauce that came with it too, thick and fresh!  The pizza was very good too- fresh toppings, good amount of cheese, liked the sauce, and tasty, light crust.

Visited tonight for the first time and was not disappointed. I was fearful it wouldn't match my memories, but they really nailed it, especially their unique dough and the family recipe sausage. Met the staff and they were awesome and treated me and my friends as if I was back in my hometown again.  If you long for the real pizza stylings of the Midwest/Chicago/Great Lakes region, make a point to visit Bruno's and enjoy the great food and friendly atmosphere. If you've only known pizza from the West Coast/Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and give Bruno's a try and taste pizza that is founded on quality ingredients, culinary skills, and the passion of the family that created it!

It's amazing how so few people know pizza (either that or something funny is going on). I guess if you're comparing it to chain pizzas, it's passable. But it's also a lot more expensive.  

The crust is very similar to chain pizza. Bland, not much flavor and too thick. I did not see the oven but definitely tastes and feels like it came out of a conveyor belt type oven such as the chains use as opposed to a real pizza oven.

Likewise, the cheese is bland. The sauce is too thick and not very plentiful.

It's basically chain pizza at a premium price.",WldhqiMbu3CUqBAUM6meXg,1,0,1,WNsd5EH-5vyumHZ-sIC0qw

1049831,2016-08-01,0,BrclERrbZrQNRyBmDGawQQ,"Not good. Decided to try it because we had a Groupon to get $40 worth of pizza (2 14"" + ""appetizers"") for $20. I'd rather have gotten a $5 Little Caeser's. Only ate a couple slices and threw the rest away. The sauce has no flavor and the crust went into the trash, which I typically like as much as the rest of the pizza. They don't really even have appetizers - no mozzarella sticks or calamari or anything like that. They don't classify their chicken wings as appetizers, so I didn't get to try them under the Groupon. That was disappointing. Their garlic cheese bread was OK, but the sauce was just a cold, flavorless paste. The pepperoni sticks were also not good - tasteless bread with a couple pepperonis cooked on top.

1086549,2015-12-08,0,BrclERrbZrQNRyBmDGawQQ,"This is excellent pizza.  You can tell that care is put into making the pizza and they use quality ingredients.  The crust is thicker than a standard New York style pizza, but the outside is crispy and the inside is soft and doughy.  The sauce had a nice tomato zing to it, which gave it good flavor.  There was a lot of cheese on it for a normal order, extra cheese would of been too much.

The pizza is very filling and heavy for its size.  They have excellent specials which make the entire meal very affordable.  We got two large pizzas, 2 orders of breadsticks, and a 2 liter soda for $22.00.  That price is a steal!

Give this place a try, it is very clean and has a personal feel to it.  The owners are very friendly and even thought it is technically a chain from Indiana, it has a hometown feel to it.",YrlH8p-BIadJpE5cx2wYrg,0,0,5,z--ujSwWQqE2Nx5wnXO5qQ

It's not an oily or flimsy pizza that can hardly withstand the ingredients either! This is an all around great quality pizza for a fair price. A large pizza will run you $22.00-$23.00. 

My favorite pizza is the Real Deal. It has pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions. 

While waiting for our pizzas, we enjoyed some breadsticks. These are also made fresh in the restaurant. They offer two selections of dipping sauces. The red marinara or a cheese dip. Both were good and the breadsticks were top notch.

They just starting serving wings as well. They are butcher fresh wings - never frozen. They are well-cooked and meaty. They are a $1.00 a wing and well worth it!!

1462099,2015-10-20,0,BrclERrbZrQNRyBmDGawQQ,"Happened to find this place through Yelp looking for close restaurants. The employees from start to finish were hospitable, friendly, and thankful. 
We ordered The Real Deal (pepperoni, mushroom, onions, sausage, green peppers). From the ingredients alone, one would normally think that the pizza would be greasy. From the moment the pizza was never greasy. Most other pizza places you can instantly tell the meat and cheese are cheap when the oils flood out as it cooks, and near the end of the meal, the pizza is salty and soggy and you feel gross. The pizza at Bruno's, however, was consistent from the time it landed on the table to the time the last quarter of the pizza was placed in the box. It tastes clean, never tasted salty, and most importantly, I don't feel disgusting afterwards. The pizza does not need towels, let alone a single piece of napkin, to remove excess amounts of grease a usual cheap pizza would normally need. 
The dough itself is not spongy, yet has a great chewy dough texture that is chewy, not soggy, and yet crisp from start to finish.
Prices are definitely reasonable. Offers pizza by the slice. Simple menu yet still has diverse options for toppings. Friendly owners and employees. Definitely check it out.",WxSvajzScKV7nUS5JPAAug,1,0,5,g_l_MDl-2O6wrSvwEl_PBA

We've only ordered pepperoni pizza, bread sticks and wings. The pizza we typically will order original crust which is not too thin, not too thick. Thinner than Pizza Hut, for example... but thicker than your average NY style slice. I love it as it creates a really good balance for the toppings. The pizza has not been too greasy nor too dry and also reheats well. 

The breadsticks are a bit greasy for me, but some may enjoy them. The wings are pretty good as well. I prefer a little crunch to my wings and Bruno's wings have just that!

I order a large pepperoni pizza and garlic bread sticks. The pizza was a pretty good size for a large and had many slices to share from. The cheese was nice and thick and stretched every time you took a bite! The pizza was also on the more thicker and fluffier side. The pizza also could had a little more sauce on it since there was a lot of cheese on it and bread. 

The bread sticks were only okay to me. They seemed a little over cooked! 

WORST THING EVER: they forgot to pack red peppers and Parmesan :(",w15NByGsVedQLmpydJ7gPg,2,4,4,6PdxIJnSSkVIhEgB-yFtjw

One of the folks at our martial arts school is from the same place Bruno's comes from and she thankfully made us aware.  Prior to Bruno's opening she brought some pizza in that they made while working out the finer points of the dough recipe for the climate here in Vegas.  It smelled great, they offered a couple of slices, and I found a new favorite.  It was just cheese pizza, and it was probably the best cheese pizza I can remember eating.  Ever.

Excited that they finally had their soft opening on October 1st, we went in to try more of what they do, and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered the cheese pizza for my son and the meat lover's pizza for the two of us.  A side of garlic breadsticks and soft drinks complemented the pies and in no time we had our happy pizza faces on.

The toppings were delicious and the crust was amazing even thought they'll tell you they're not quite content with it just yet.  Even more amazing:  no grease sitting on the pie or under the crust.  The meat pizza was delicious, the toppings were tender, and somehow they've found a way to get rid of all the grease and oil that seems to settle on pizzas like this.

They're still getting their rhythm down, but Bruno's is a must visit place if you're on the southwest side of the valley.  Go enjoy a pizza, and help them hit their stride as they approach their grand opening and a full menu.

Note: there used to be another pizza joint in the same location, so don't miss that it's a new place now.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,22,15,5,Kj4ALpQheU5DNd8cht6nRQ

It was just wonderful and you can smell from the crust how it was cooked traditionally not one of those conveyor thingies.

The cheese, you could tell was high quality.

We were very happy to be able to get away from the strip for a day to eat at this location, by the way it is on the way to Red Rock Canyon so was a convenient location for us. Just a short jot down flamingo or Tropicana Avenue and you're there, for my friends back home here in Indiana , if you go to Vegas you must get a Bruno's pizza.",OipTuX1ZDfZQ630e6MOWhg,0,0,5,G52MVdPOXCjnYzvPWFcU-w

The complimentary breadsticks and sauce appetizer was tasty; the sauce had a nice sweet quality.  I ordered a half-vegetarian, half bar-b-que chicken pizza. It was delicious with a light, fluffy crust, and every bite delighted my taste buds.  Service was excellent -- Mark, one of the owners, was great.  I plan to be back again and again and the next time I'll bring my friends to enjoy Bruno's pizza!

10/28/16, Update: Bruno's has closed.

I am so over commercial pizza places like pizza hut & dominio's so I had to search for a hand crafted pizza place. Bruno's Pizza most defiantly deliver on my order. I ordered a large meat lovers pizza, buffalo wings, and received two free garlic breads, and EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS.

When ordering my pizza the staff was nice and friendly, and very helpful. The inside of this establishment is pretty small. They have a few chairs and tables sat up if you want to eat, but I think I would just order take out. If Bruno's pizza would add a few TV's & have Sunday football beer specials.

Ordered chicken wings with garlic ranch. Omg so glad we did,  it was amazing. The chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did I mentioned the garlic.  It was so delicious!

The XL pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite.  The topping were really tasty with half of it topped with pepperoni,  black olives, and sausages.  The other half had pepperoni,  onions,  and bacon.

Another perk... the owner. Mark the owner was here during our meal and made us feel so welcomed and at home. Where can you go and get that kind of service now a days...? Here.

Las Vegas is quickly becoming the best pizza city on the planet . Sure some would argue New York, Chicago etc. But, Las Vegas gets the best Pizza places from every city that migrates here and opens up a shop. Bruno's is one of those shops. Here is a classic 1970's pizza place that understands that you need great ingredients to make a great pie. The best dough, a unique flavorful sauce , great cheese and toppings. Everything is top quality. The guy below who gave a 1 Star review doesn't know what he's talking about. First , who would dare talk smack about free pizza brought to their work. But to talk smack about what is easily one of the top pizza places in Las Vegas. He must be a hater for sure. Ignore his review . Trust me and the others on here . This pizza place deserves a visit . The people who live around there should be rejoicing . These are owners who care about their product and customers . I came in with my two kids and they brought us out cinnamon rolls on the house . Bite squad delivers and I'm sure Postmates will too. Pizza lovers you need to come and try this for yourself . 


Helpful advice : 

My only advice to them would be to carry more rare and hard to find bottled sodas and root beers. Those would warrant the price you are asking . Or lower it a buck. Just my two cents",yx-IGx7ZI3L8Y0w9NsJtKg,1,0,5,a0d7ZH53MLUGety7uelAbw

While you have the finest restaurants in the world in Las Vegas, yet sprisingly, finding a shop that makes a decent pie isn't an easy task. Over the five years my husband and I have lived here we tried countless restaurants and finally when we were visiting a friend in this area we stumbled upon the restaurant to via yelp. Needless to say this place took our breath away! The pizza was of the utmost quality! A crisp crust quality homemade sauce and a variety of the most delicious cheeses I've ever had. Well we normally never order chicken wings when it comes to pizza delivery we decided to roll the dice and order some of their traditional barbecue wings. All I can say, is OMG! 
This place makes wing stop and any other restaurant that specializes in chicken wings seem like Autre crap. The chicken wings that they serve here are moist thick juicy, and some of the biggest chicken wings I've ever seen. I don't know what kind of sauce they use but I either want the recipe or I I need to buy a vat of it! This place is truly a hidden gem and I've already been back here countless times since then, yet I've never made the point to write a review.
To be completely honest, I was a bit hesitant as my husband and I feared that if this place received too many positive reviews and people found out about this incredible shop, then we'd never be able to order a decent pie and have to wait forever for a pizza of supreme quality. But we decided to not be a stubborn selfish kids and share our experience with you.

Long Review: We had a card for a free pizza and finally got a chance to get over there to check it out. Cute little place, very clean and everybody was really friendly. The waitress actually told me about checking in on Yelp to get a free breadsticks appetizer which I thought was very nice especially since our pizza was already free.

The chef even came out and talked to my husband for a while and seemed to be out and about in the dining area talking to people (and even refilled sodas!) which always makes me feel like they really care about what they are making, so I thought that was great. 

On to the pizza, I was worried when first going that it was going to be that flat greasy type of pizza that everyone seems to love (and I hate) but it wasn't at all. It was really poofy (for lack of a better word, lol) and the large was HUGE! It was really good, and VERY filling! Not a skimpy pizza at all, we didn't even finish half between 3 of us! I really liked the crust and everything tasted very fresh. The breadsticks were also really yummy, lots of garlic, which I love :-)

Prices are very reasonable, especially considering how filling the pizza is. A large will easily feed a family of 4, probably with leftovers. We also noticed they had a lunch special, 2 slices and a drink or 1 slice, salad and a drink, for $6 (I think) which I think is really a great price for the quality of pizza, so we are looking forward to coming in for that one day.

We are definitely glad we checked them out and I think this will be our new go to for pizza night, between the price and the quality I think they would be hard to beat!",YJNVwDdzwjwhptzh9y2vBg,2,2,4,CDOLMg6Kj6eeKyEhNrziUg
