She is terrible! Never again wil I sit at the bar with her behind it!",KdROdSqq-wxbCBZDszU9CQ,0,0,3,2e9TdCN-7R89rlGTU4KMBQ

During our recent visit, we searched for the restaurant and found they closed but had another location. Caught Uber from the Strip (10min drive) and my craving for a homemade breakfast was satisfied.

Cheap eats but not fine dining or anything fancy.

I ordered the Deuces Wild which includes eggs, hashbrown, sausage AND bacon along with 2 buttery pancakes courtesy of Ms. Esther. Hope you enjoy your visit!",uM8YOJ7tuvFD3dPo9bipYA,0,1,4,S4ng_8N10qi4oXkQ9pNgNQ

2276355,2016-10-16,1,UdC4xRKTFQPOhkc6vPVwvA,So disappointed in this place.  I come here a lot but it's going down hill. Now I ask them to turn the tv to the game I want to watch and they said no.  No one is watching this tv but me!  I'm leaving and done with Loose Caboose.,iCJMQp3WZuRON4AmzXJmZA,1,0,1,Q0xnvrRSlWl-Lr2jgkofsg

Drinks aren't watered down at all & the bartender's really chill too. He made it a point to call us by name & make good conversation. He even gave us 2 free drinks on a $22 tab. Really nice dude. Didn't try the food but saw others eating what seems to be decent bar grub. Definitely gonna come back!",2V8lslhb-OF9ayHNAwgwqg,0,2,4,e-CCiK6M_H-drBg5AxVgRQ

The woman server was nice and nobody else to serve so was always around. 

They have a tv in the dining room area and we ordered some nachos and watched tv. The nachos were good. Lots of cheese, and toppings. 

I will return",T1XUUXIEU5uj3NmdWAdIlA,1,2,4,n6H8BN5NgipOPDZvjuI-eA

5219571,2017-01-15,0,UdC4xRKTFQPOhkc6vPVwvA,"My boyfriend and I come here during football season since it's close to our home. Beer is cold and food is cheap especially during football season. They have a restaurant section separate from the bar area; good for those who would like to dine away from the bar in a smoke free area. You can of course, enjoy your meal in the bar area while you play on some electronic gambling machines. 

Can't beat the specials they have in food during football games. Five bucks for 2 hot dogs and fries, $3 for a huge basket of fries and $7 for sliders and fries to name a few. Typical car food but it comes out nice and hot and the service is very welcoming. They seem to have a lot of regulars but new customers will feel welcome also. The bar is clean and they serve well drinks as well as some top shelf stuff.",XQOWYd0VM9gDEepzzcRNEg,0,0,4,KpBITSpt-dh2sd03evx58Q
