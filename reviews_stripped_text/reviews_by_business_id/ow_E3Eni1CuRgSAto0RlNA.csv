We ordered the beef jerky & the famous spinach ""salad"" for appetizer; and both dishes were fantastic with amazing flavors. For main entrees, we ordered the Drunken noodles & Basil chicken, which were incredible as well.

Honestly, I think the location is a bit random. It's located in the far end of a commercial plaza. If you see Peet's and  some sort of workout place, you're headed in the right direction.

Order at the counter. Somehow they magically remember who ordered what. I've had the grilled pork skewers, pad see ew, green curry, basil chicken, panang beef, fried mussels, and famous spinach salad. Overall, I really don't have complaints about this place. Flavors are explosive but also refreshing. They manage to make the potentially-heavy fried spinach into a refreshing dish with their tart sauce. The panang beef fell flat for me; while the flavors were similar to the green curry, the beef was tough and leathery. If I had to choose a favorite dish so far, it'd be the grilled pork skewers!!

On the menu, most entrees are shown to have a vegetarian option. I always crave curry, so I asked if it could be made without fish sauce. The cashier replied that they don't use fish sauce in their curries. I ordered the Bangkok fried rice for my daughter, a veggie panang curry, and the famous crispy spinach to share.

The fried rice comes with a fried egg on top. I forgot to ask them to cook it through because my daughter doesn't eat yolk. The famous spinach salad is just crispy fried batter with a few spinach leaves adding some green color. The dipping sauce has chicken in it. I probably wouldn't order this dish again, but had to try it out of curiosity. I added a few ""leaves"" to my curry for a nice crunchy texture.

The panang curry was spicy! I wasn't asked for a heat level, but this was at least a medium. I was expecting tofu, but received only vegetables, which were fresh and well cooked.

We ordered the spinach salad and Bangkok fried rice. Both were cooked to perfection. The spinach salad was crispy, super addicting, and paired perfectly with the spicy chili sauce that it came with. The Bangkok fried rice was also flavorful and had so much chicken....more than any other fried rice dishes I've ordered in Vegas! Not just that, the chicken was cooked evenly. Juicy and flavorful, not stringy or dry or bland.

The service was great, with our food brought out to us hot and fresh. It didn't come out at the same time, but that's no problem as we knew they were cooking our orders fresh. Every now and then, we were asked if we needed anything else and once finished, had our used plates taken away for us. We appreciate this kind of attention for this kind of place.

The prices were the only reason I knocked off a star. For the portion that we got, $11 was a bit much for fried rice, but I guess that's why there was so much chicken...

They bring it out as soon as it's made so one person may get their order before another at the same table.

3332561,2018-04-19,0,ow_E3Eni1CuRgSAto0RlNA,"Block 9 is legitimately good Thai food.  They say street, but I just say good portioned and tasty.  Not too spicy and very easy on the palate.  We had the spinach salad, the red curry, and the drunken noodle.  The spinach salad was more a tempura than a traditional salad.  The dipping sauce was phenomenal with a little kick and Thai peanuts and dressing.  The spinach was fine but an appetizer for sure.  The red curry had your normal Thai chili taste.  Some kick if you bit into a pepper, but other than that just a good portioned dish.  It did come with bamboo which seemed interesting in a curry dish.  Finally, the notorious drunken noodle that even Nittaya is known for.  This dish was humongous.  Easily will feed you for dinner and lunch the next day.  As was Nittaya's the dish isn't the most exciting in terms of ingredients, but the noodles are chewy and the sauce is sticky.  Spice level was very mild (though I asked for extra hot), but still a very nice dish.  Add some house pepper sauce if you need the heat.

Block 9 is a nice location right off 215 and Town Center.  Easy in and out for take out, or a nice area for sit down with a back patio area and some good beer for $4 or less if you eat in.

4146512,2018-05-27,0,ow_E3Eni1CuRgSAto0RlNA,"I'm so glad there is a Thai restaurant only 5 minutes from my house. We had Pad See Ieew, mint basil chicken, Prik something that was pork with green beans. It was solid. The owners also own Nittaya's Kitchen which is on Rampart & Lake Mead and has a following. It's good but I also think Archie's is good as well. 

I love Arawan and Lotus of Siam for Thai food. Actually, I love the food in Thailand - best papaya salad is at the outdoor festival in Chang Mai and it cost me less than a $1, served on a paper plate with a plastic fork. 

So, when I say something is good or bad, it's unfortunately be compared with something else. For Las Vegas, many of the Thai restaurants are delicious. Pinkao on Lake Mead has been there forever. 

Back to Block 9 - their menu is limited, but Block 9 is more like a take-out place. They have seats and tables, and the decor is industrial, but I think it is friendly. They serve alcohol. It's casual. 

The prices are a few dollars more than Thai Noodle House #2 (the one on Tropicana - the only one I like of that brand), but the taste is about the same with Block 9 with a smidgeon more on the details to flavor. For example, when I want something really spicy at Thai Noodle House, they usually use chili flakes that really ruins the texture rather than using the actual Thai chilis which Block 9 does. 

The spicy green bean with pork - that's called Prik something -- I don't have time to look it up for you -- but that was more like a curry flavor than what I'm used to, but it was still good. A new find for my son who usually sticks with the noodle dishes.

4786280,2018-04-30,1,ow_E3Eni1CuRgSAto0RlNA,"Cashier looks like a younger introverted Jimmy Fallon look alike sporting a disinterested attitude.  When we walked in, he was drawing on the back of a Costco receipt, and did not greet us until a few minutes after he felt like he reached a good stopping point of his doodle.

He barely uses his voice so you have to keep asking him to repeat and even lean into over the counter and read lips if you want to understand him.  The man is like an energy suckhole that is encapsulated by the overgrown shaggy hair and hunched poster.  An attitude perhaps more appropriate for Haight-Ashbury on a gloomy overcast day in San Francisco than thr exciting, energetic, and happening streets of Thai markets.

Endless loops of twangy country music plays in the background again exposed spray painted ceiling and wooden bench tables with rustic pops of teal and brown chairs.  All food are served on disposable paper plates, paper bowls, plastic utensils.  

The food is served scolding hot.  Someone in our party burned their tongue on the curry bowl even after letting it sit for 10mins.  Very good coconut flavor with a hint of spice.

While there are bottled beer and wine available, it is quite confusing as to why one would do a business meeting or lunch here.  Aside from ordering your food from the counter and an employee drop it off at your table as they pick up the number and metal stand, there are no service or interaction.  The employees spend more time with their backs to the customer to chat and hang out with kitchen staff over the wall cutout than to check in with dine in customers.  Not once did they wipe anything down or straighten out chairs.  

The set up and atmosphere is more like a cafeteria with a mean lunch lady while pretending to be a 'wine bistro'.  Paper plates and plastic utensils is not the place I'd be sipping on wine.  Overall, a mish-mash throw together that fail to understand their identity asides from a convenient decent Thai takeout spot.",1y1T-gONnhnC68JlR6RNgA,4,0,3,e0mXCoy6SVy4ay6wOQ8CsA

5094785,2018-06-12,22,ow_E3Eni1CuRgSAto0RlNA,"""What makes you different from Nittaya's Secret Kitchen?"" I as the person behind the counter.

""Our name and location"" the incredulous reply.

SMH.

Bottom line, it is Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, without table service.  Paper plates, Styrofoam bowls, disposable plastic cups and plastic utensils are the norm.  Smaller portions and single serving dishes designed for a quick meal for one or take away.  Prices are slightly lower.

TIP:  Do not take out the food.  Fresh veg and herbs quickly become overcooked and crispy items (ie crispy deep fried spinach salad) become soggy.

The  ""World Famous Spinach Salad"" still great eats. Essentially a light tempura batter coated, deep fried spinach leaves that turn into crisp spinach chips perfect for dipping into the vinegary, spicy, nutty ""dressing"".

Other noteworthy dishes, the garlic spice rubbed then deep fried spare ribs, good.  Cooked medium,  packs a lot of flavor into a small bite.  The grilled marinated pork skewers also solid.  Slightly sweet, grilled mid well and still plenty juicy, works well with the accompanying tamarind chili sauce.  Finally the beef jerky, also deeply marinated, sweet soy flavor, slightly chewy but still moist; the fat being the best part, also good eats.

No complaints on either the yellow or green curries.   Lots of Thai basil, decently tender chicken and not overcooked veg.  Oily but agreeable pad thai, hints of wok hei, fresh and vibrant with lots of fresh sprouts.

Small craft beer list if you must.

Local counter service.

All told, if you're a fan of Nittya's food, you're better off going there. Too lazy to drive the extra 10 minutes, this will do.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,29,27,3,xnWOZjfegoCtTw-8gh17YQ

5356574,2018-04-07,1,ow_E3Eni1CuRgSAto0RlNA,"Surprise!  It was good news that Nittaya's (on Rampart) decided to give us peons a much less expensive place for dining... with a very uninviting name of Block 9 (think cell block?) & all entrees would be $11.00.

My partner & I arrived @ 5:30 on Friday night & it wasn't yet busy.  I stood at the counter to place our orders & when inserting my Visa, a pop-up appeared with ""Tip: ___ 15%, ___ 20%"" & I heard later there was a box for ""no tip"" - some psychology, hmm?  The ambiance is gaudy, with steel chairs minus cushions (but insult comes a bit later.)  

Our orders consisted of green curry chicken (said to come only one way but ""not very hot"") & chicken Pad Thai.  The wait wasn't long but one order came 10 mins. after the other.  To say we were shocked by white paper plates for the rice & paper cups with the sauce, as well as plastic silverware, is an understatement.  My curry, though good, was so spicy it felt like my tongue was burning.  Since that dish was my reason for coming, my partner didn't touch his Pad Thai & instead asked for our money back.

So, maybe Block 9 is delicious & $11.00 is a fair price.  But when you feel insulted in several ways & management didn't offer to comp any of it, I say ""no next time"" folks.  I can take myself down to Jones for 2 whole blocks of darn righteous Asian food.  Or, better yet, over to Lotus of Siam.",kFFhw53ZEPoDo6okPU4eRg,1,1,3,PnqRTgVsyT25JMeaNqbJmw

Small place . Cool design and decor. 

Food... simply amazing. As in, I'm not sure I've had better in Vegas. We had the pork skewers that come with this sauce I could drink as well as sticky rice alongside. Great to share. 

Coconut soup was our side order. It was full of flavor though not enough to really share so keep that in mind. 
 
Panang Curry ( we did chicken ) was stellar. Perfect heat and just amazing. 

So why only four stars ....

Greeting was less than stellar in sort of an irritated, surprised to see you sort of way. We asked a few questions and got short answers 

We choose the patio which is nice though next to busy freeway so not quiet . When the staff brought the food ( young kid ) he basically just dumped it down and walked away. So then it's back inside for extra plates ( we were sharing, bowls , napkins etc ) would have expected a ""need anything else ?""

I love me some spinach salad-and it was good as usual. Most of the dishes are chicken or I think there's a beef panang. If you're looking for her seafood dishes, you won't find it here. You can get some wine--the screw top bottle version. The male staff is weird, I think I may have seen one of them as a waiter at the restaurant, but I felt like he had a chip on his shoulder and was definitely not friendly. The gal took my order but missed the drink so I had to get back up and order it again, she apologized...which is fine...but it's not like there was anyone else in the place..hate to see an order on a busy moment. The paper plates they gave out to eat on didn't have lids to take it home with, only on the paper they serve it on...I like to eat it in a family style serving but its definitely packaged for an individual. They had some take home boxes laying on the counter.. they didn't tell me about them--I just helped myself. I asked for a lid for the sauce that comes with the spinach and the male not so happy guy makes a remark about how I should have received it with a lid--well I don't care I have no lid, just help me locate one please. 

I definitely prefer the full service restaurant. I like shrimp and it wasn't available here so a little downgrade of stars for that and the weird dude. 

I took the bread pudding home and I think it's the size that only a Barbie doll could love ha ha. The basil chicken was great and so was the yellow curry. But there's something funky about all these saucy foods sitting in a paper serving dish-soggy beyond belief and just doesn't make it appetizing.

5994075,2018-04-16,0,ow_E3Eni1CuRgSAto0RlNA,"This place is a pleasant surprise! I've been reading a lot about Block 9, but I've been a bit hesitant to visit as most places are sadly not as authentic as they purport to be. And after walking in, and first tasting their pad see iew, I thought that it was just another mediocre Thai restaurant. Though they were generous with the fish sauce in the basic dish, where was the heat? Where was the sugar? 

However, we were pleasantly surprised to find that all of that was available to add to the dish - and once we did we were transported to the streets of Bangkok. 

This restaurant is the real deal. They serve a simple menu of many of the typical street food in Bangkok. Though at first service, the heat you find in the food in Bangkok is missing, they make it easy to add the heat with authentic Thai chili powder/flakes (make sure you ask for it). Add a little chili and a little sugar and you've got the real deal.  The owner is a wonderful woman who's been in LV fo many years but originally hails from Bangkok. She frequently flies home to update her own personal repertoire of recipes so that it reflects the current street food trends of Bangkok. 

We also ordered Moo Yang (grilled pork skewers) and this too was typical of Bangkok street food (once you add the heat). The sauce was vinegary,  sweet and just a bit spicy. Again, add more heat for that authentic touch. 

Lastly, we got the green curry on the owner's advice. We were not disappointed. While it did not contain the scrumptious little round Thai eggplant, it had bamboo shoots, generous amount of basil and a green curry base that is fresh and tasty. 

To temper the heat of the food, order the Thai ice tea - this too is the real deal. 

I'm not a fan of egg rolls (though we ordered it) so I can't say anything positive or negative about it. 

On the whole, this is a great place to come for authentic Thai street eats.  If you have a chance, (and the space in your belly) get the fried mussels as well. 

Oh! And the place is SUPER CLEAN! 

I'd come again in a heartbeat.",60OhUP904CWpFUOWKdI1gg,0,0,4,Qm_-Mvdz0I7L59q9SwSDHw
