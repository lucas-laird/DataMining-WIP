I have hit all the top wonton cities: Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Vancouver, L.A., S.F. and found some of the best shrimp wontons at The Big Wong in Vegas, who knew??? Wonton lovers, you won't be disappointed. :D  

We also tried their fried pork chops served with a freshly made sauce,  excellent and their Roti (a sweet fried crepe Thai dessert) was to die for.

Was staying down the road to Big Wongs so decided to give it a try for brunch. First impression is a very dingey looking asian joint, but that was quickly dismissed once we got the food. 

We ordered fried pork chop/rice and a hainan chicken/rice for only $4.95 each! Cant really go wrong! 

Serving size is great and tastes great as well. So good in fact we went back 2 days later.

He then pointed to a table, and tossed the menu onto the table. He did not say a word to us. Not even to say welcome to Big Wong's or what can I get you to drink. Not a word. My dad then ordered tea and water. The tea tasted was cold and tasted like dish water. Then my dad tried talking to the man in chinese, and he replied in a rude manner saying I don't speak chinese. And my dad also asked in english what number was the prata, and he said sharply and rudely #8 and my dad didn't like his tone and we walked out.

Then you try Chinatown food looking for a familiar setting you can find comfort in while being away from home, but all you find are high priced food ($8-14/dish) that the tastes good enough. Until you find Big Wong! 
This authentic restaurant screams, ""feed my soul with your warm food.""  You will find specials postered on their walls, a small joint that seems like only locals know about, to appreciate the scent of satay pan as you bite into your garlic infused ong choy, and enjoy the classic no b.s. attitude of the waitress ( which reminds me of ok service, but great food). 
No glitz, no glam kind of place. Just sit back, chill, and dine until it hit the spot! On average their price ~$4-6/item, can of pop $1, rice bowl $1. Can't beat that. They keep the menu short and serve quick. Waitress says, ""we have a lil bit of everything, but we don't have everything."" Meaning= Pan-Asian menu, no fried rice! Don't ask, you'll get yelled at.

We ordered salt pepper pork chop and fried pork chop - both not so good. I think something is wrong with the breading. The $1 milk tea and lemon tea is like the one I take a tea bag and make it at home then add milk.

First off the little actually well pretty tall for an old Asian man with the hat is super cool he's got jokes especially if you take the time to get to know him. Not only that did you ever stop to think that maybe his English isn't that great maybe that's why he seems a little rude I only know this because he reminds me of my grandma and when she first came to America all she wanted was a burger and would drive around all the drive thrus asking for a Big Mac and people would say we don't have that here and she would just drive off now she sticks to making food at home even tho I know she wants that burger every now and then sadly she only knows it as a Big Mac. What I'm trying to say is he's a cool guy and almost always the only server cut him some slack show some respect he's a hard working man just trying to make it like everyone else.,UJrxRDK1OhisCqM0VdGUCQ,0,0,5,ymsJfJOKQrrsg5aCErPF_w

101069,2015-09-19,1,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Maybe I ordered the wrong things? Having grown up eating Chinese/Taiwanese food, this place just seemed so...bleh. I would honestly pick a run of the mill Americanized Chinese restaurant over this place. So what went wrong?

We ordered fried shrimp wontons, stewed beef in oyster sauce, pork ribs in black beans sauce and the salt and pepper chicken wings. The wontons were greasy, the beef stew had too much cornstarch so the sauce was like jello, the ribs weren't cooked long enough and had no flavor, and the chicken wings weren't seasoned. Am I being hyper-critical? I don't think so, my white husband also thought the food was below average. 

Then there's the service. I know many Chinese restaurants don't win over customers with friendly service but this guy really takes the cake. He doesn't greet you, just points to a table and tells you to go sit. I heard him speak Chinese speak with his kitchen staff but when customers speak to him in Chinese he pretends he doesn't understand. Then an old man comes in and asks to sit in a corner, but he forces the customer to sit at a table by the kitchen and shakes his head like the customer was a pest.

129775,2014-01-07,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"I totally echoed with some other reviewers, the service really sucked there! They never smiled and sometimes I feel that customers are paying them to treat customers badly. It's like they don't care if you give them business or not. The price is very attractive but then after visting there for couple times, I eventually figured that it's not worth it because I never ate comfortably in the restaurant when their faces (the only lady who served customers and the kitchen staff, especially the female cook) always look upset. Why can't they smile a little more? Like another reviewer said, we always said thank you, when being seated, when the drinks came, when the food came, we said thank you. But there was no acknowledgement of our thanks, and the face was like ""whatever"".

The first time I went there I asked very politely if they have a bathroom (i asked after placing orders), and the lady was giving me an irritated look, as if I was a fool to ask.

I think the food is cheap because they only have so few employees there. And I guess that's why there is no good service, I think anyone could go postal if one has to do everything with no help. I did see that ""only lady"" taking orders, serving drinks, bringing out food, sweeping the floor, etc, all by herself. Poor thing.....and poor customers too. I guess that's why the ""only lady"" always has an irritated face. Though I can be empathetic, I still disagree with such kind of service. But I still can't figure out why the female cook has an irritated face. The male cook doesn't have an irritated look. But then he works in the kitchen mostly, so can't really compensate the unpleasant aura caused by the other 2 ladies. By the way, the female cook doesn't come out often either, but for that one time she did came out, she looked at me as if I was an eye sore for her, and I was just eating, not doing anything wrong though.

I think I would rather be starved instead of going back again....way too much discomfort to eat with that unpleasant aura. It's not worth it though the food is cheap.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,2,1,2,jiY0TpEGNYSQjYH6kEOc6g

Shrimp wontons were bland and a bit overcooked.  Chicken curry roti - the roti were a bit too greasy and the chicken curry came in a small cup which had many more potato chunks than chicken.  Hainan chicken came in a decent portion but very bland and a bit dry.  

Other than that the place was clean and service was great and friendly.  True a lot of the dishes were $5, but given the lack of taste I wouldn't mind pay a little more for better tasting food.",ieP9RDJDO4i2oL583ZI8MQ,1,0,2,ghRuTNNz5d7mBzwzNj4oOA

131926,2012-06-24,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Ok, so...I gave it a second try before writing this review.  I would say that for the beef ramen...I love the noodles that they use it is really good.  Not much broth flavor but you can doctor it up with the condiments if they had the right kind...may be they will get some like what pho restaurants offers.  The beef is tasty and they will ask if you want tendons or not...cool...

Hainan chicken w rice...it was decent, sauce could be better.  Of course I am judging this with my experience from eating this famous dish in Thailand.  I will come here for this dish bc again I will not make it at home due to too much work, and I like that you can ask for white meat w/o extra charge.  I had Ong choy vegetables this was decent too.  Then we ended with sweet roti, it was ok.
  
2nd visit...

Good wonton soup, I would get this again.  Fish ball curry, well I guess I don't like Malaysian style curry I won't get any curry dishes since Malay is the base for their curry. Chicken wings, umm...really salty and not any other flavor...

I want to like this place.  The restuarant is really, really clean.  I think the lady owner has OCD in a good way, she spays and clean table right after customers leave...a BIG THUMBS UP!!!  They are really nice and courteous and the cook is constantly asking me what he can do to make this place better.  I told him the price is right so far, they will have more business if they can improve the flavor of the food.

If you want relaxing, excellent customer services, then you are at the wrong place, the strip is the place you should go.

I came here due to the Yelp's reviews for dinner, it is not a very big restaurant, the table seating setup is good for group of 4 to 6 persons, if you have more than 6 in your group, then you are expecting a longer wait, or separating into 2 tables.

Now for the food, we ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and the fried shrimp wonton. The Hainan Chicken Rice is the best I tasted so far in West Coast. Their Hainan Chicken Rice is very similar to Thai style chicken rice, I would say about 95% similar. The chicken meat has very good tender, not too soft or too hard, and I believe the rice is steam cooked with the chicken soup, because by just eating the rice itself, it is already very tasty. For the fried shrimp wonton, it is very crispy and the shrimp is fresh too. I would recommended these two choices.

For services, I would agree they are out-staff, so you have to be patient with them. Especially the lady waitress, she has to do everything from taking order, serving, cleaning/setup table, take phone order and cashier. So be patient.

We even came back the next day for our lunch. For the food, I would come back again. Oh! I forgot to mention one more thing, the price! it is unbelievable cheap!",69FBomLIevAJL2C6SfODLw,1,1,5,rDiUv06pJhp1iaa6DV22lg

1) The prices are reasonable
2) The Latino gentleman who delivered our food was professional and courteous.
The negatives:
1) Why would you put a MAN suffering from PMS as the hostess?  Seriously, he doesn't want to be there.  He exudes discontent for life and negativity.  
2) I think they are trying to make fusion food (definition: they can't cook authentic food).  The curry has something sour in it.  I have had Indian/Malay/Japan/Chinese curries and their version is completely unique in flavor.  As for their beef stew noodle soup, the temperature wasn't even near hot.  
3) This comment is not the fault of the restaurant but it is extremely difficult to find a parking spot during meal times.

I ate my food at home and everything was still hot and tasty!

The peppered wings had little bits of jalapeño on them, they were crispy and juicy and a perfect amount of spicy!
The deep fried pork was alright good texture thoroughly cooked, and the rice was the same, like I said previously the amount of food was really great for the price!
It also came with some sort of garlic sauce? I haven't asked what that is but it has a really strong taste, makes the pork even juicier.

This isn't a five star restaurant. I found this place by asking the dealers and staff at the various casinos I went to. Where's the best and cheapest authentic Asian food around? Good number of them said Big Wong. I started to laugh since we had one in NYC.  

I decided to check it out with my friends.  Yes I admit the service is a bit slow but then again we ate there on a Saturday night when the place was full. One waitress working and she looked stress out. I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I can relate. Food came out hot though and was surprisingly tasty. I was very surprise since I'm from the East coast and I think Asian food there is the best in the USA. Yes I'm a little bias. 

The environment was plain and not flashy, nothing spectacular about it.  They didn't rush us out and we just hung out talking about our plans for the evening.  Our total cost was about $40 dollars for 4 grown men and trust me we can all eat. I was laughing about the price. It's unreal and I don't know how this place can stay afloat with these prices. We tip the waitress $8 dollars bringing each of our totals to $12 dollars for a full meal. Still cheaper than any restaurant I know in NYC. The waitress was shocked and thought we made a mistake. I ask her why?  Standard tip in NY is about 15% to 20% so this was right. I guess people in Vegas tip much less? Perhaps it's a West coast thing. Maybe that's why you get the service you do. Who knows? 

As long as the food is good and served hot. I really don't care too much about the service. The food did come out pretty fast even though I didn't get a smile.  
Any event if you want good Chinese food.  I would suggest this place. It's as good as it gets for the price and not the décor or the service which many complain about.

          The first time I had the Hainan chicken and the shrimp won tons with ramen  The hainan chicken and the dipping sauce was  solid and the rice was flavorful. 
          Shrimp won ton ramen was tasty, the won tons had whole pieces of shrimp inside. I know some people rave about this but I prefer a  minced shrimp filling with water chestnuts , green onions etc.  The broth was clear and flavorful , the ramen was cooked perfectly.       
         
            My second trip ordered the crispy pork chop, but got the crispy chicken instead, no problem I can adapt. The problem was the chicken lacked flavor and the dipping sauce was the pan drippings and was not very good.   I also had the beef curry  with rice and no tendons,  ,glad they asked  if I wanted tendon's given choice I rather eat meat then tendons.  I'll eat tendons if I'm still hungry and its the only thing left on my plate.
             The beef curry was very good and more then made up for the crispy chicken.  I rate the food a very solid  3 stars and with the great service and super value it gets another star .

But because the food is priced so right, and the plaza is booming from the other restaurants.. business is picking up and service is completely nonexistent.

Sorry lady, please don't be too danm miseriable, the energy is not good. They need to hire a few teenagers to help run the business or something.  As good as anybody can be, being the hostess, server, busser, cashier and trying to answer the phone is plain ridiculous.

Add some music or a tv for some noise, the silence makes waiting more irritating.. 

Sorry for the rant but a business establishment needs to run efficiently in other for the customer to be satisfied

Service is slow since there's only 2 people working hand in hand and that just means I have to time to look around  and observe this place. Well, I found that the server was doing everything in the front from giving utensils, order, bills, and cleaning it up. But, hmmm one time he was picking his nose and then grab the plastic cups and then serve it to the guest. It would have been ok if he grabbed the bottom part from a stacked plastic cups but huwaaa it was on the mouth part. And I just bowed my head coz this is the part I am really expecting it to happen. I know sanitary wise this place won't meet my standard. 

I think they should hire another employee who will deliver the order to the table/wash the dishes so that the host would only touch base the billing, setting up the table. Bad part of it if there's only 2 employee, the host goes to the kitchen and grabbed the food while there's a line for guest paying their bills and that's how he is touching money again and then grabbed another order which he just touched the bill and onto the plate. It's okay if he can do everything like this as long he would sanitize his hands every now and then.

I was here twice during my short stay in Vegas.  First time we had the wonton soup (good), chicken curry and pancakes (mediocre), chicken wings (yummy), and something else I can't remember.   The next day, before driving back to SoCal, my fiance and I picked up some food to eat that night since we knew we would be tired after the long drive home.   We got their Hainan chicken,  fried wonton, and baby bok choy.  Holy cow!!!
Everything was so yummy (even though we munched tirelessly in the car and the food was cold by dinnertime), especially their chicken and bok choy.    

Im glad i discovered Big Wong and told friends and family about it. Their price is extremely reasonable and would confidently recommend Big Wong to anyone wanting some good Hong Kong style cafe foods in Vegas.

Ps: there was only one server when we dined in.  She seemed a little overwhelmed but the service is like many other Asian restaurants.   It's yummy, hot food for the price of a burger and fries- don't come expecting a red carpet service.",yxuaYXZYufjV3Qoryrnwqg,0,0,5,uaPiLf0IRA23WF2NlGqLDA

Always try not to be bias on one visit but been to this place 3 times and it was all awful. Poor service and mediocre food, I can make better food at home. Wouldn't have given this place a try but thought hey they got pretty good reviews. Sorry yelpers, not sure why it was great? 1st visit there with a party of 6 during dinner hour and was greeted by a grumpy middle age woman, she was busy calculating tickets and told us ""you have to wait"" when I told her we have a party of 6, her awful tone of voice made me feel like I was scolded by mom! Not the way you would greet your guest! Took her forever to service us after we got a table and they were not super busy. Just gave me the feeling she didn't like working there. The food was very simple, basic and bland! That's why I think I can make better tasting food at home. Maybe because the price was cheap thats why people are okay with it? Another time was just our family of 4 during a late lunch hour around 3:00 service was slow because there's only one guy running the show for maybe 3 tables there. Felt bad for him having to do tables and cook the food but he wasn't too friendly either. Well came here 3 times and my husband said ""shame on us for not learning the 1st 2 time""! Don't waste your $5! That's how bad.

A side note, if I was the owner I would at least provide a bit of friendly service to my customers. A smile and Thank You wouldn't hurt, we are paying customers and not beggars for us to be treated this way. IMO",XybrvLEZUD6lJpsy5P3gSA,0,0,1,mlY-fHr8Tzpildt1LPGMXQ

We then decided to come back, craving some curry, however, the chef decided to up his petty ass game and decided to give not only waters to the three tables of ~6 people but also took their orders even though they came in about 10 minutes after us. 
We decided to leave and as we exited, we heard the chef laugh. 

This came as a surprise seeing as I, an obvious Asian, frequented this place nearly every day with my ASIAN FAMILY and were treated with utmost respect and even with occasional jokes from the chef. 

Honestly, I hate playing the race card but my party wasn't 100% Asian. We were the only group comprised of non-asians and it was blatantly obvious that we were treated differently. 

If y'all want some quality food, just go across the plaza to Japanese Zen Curry. We were seated immediately and enjoyed the great customer service that made us feel welcomed and the entire place has a 10/10 vibe.

I no longer frequent this restaurant because of my last visit. The older gentleman that took our order was extremely friendly and our dishes came out quickly. I then noticed that he spilled something on the floor, cleaned it with paper towels, and then proceeded to grab food from the kitchen with the same gloves on to bring out to customers. To my surprise, he even boxed up our food for us with those same gloves on. We decided to just ask for the check and leave. Again, the money was handled with the same gloves on...

Went last night with the hubby around 10:30 pm (they close at 11pm) there were two tables of customers one of which the owner was sitting at. She got up quickly and welcomed us in. We ordered several dishes to share. Beef ramen, shrimp wonton soup(no noodles), salt and pepper chicken wings and fried shrimp wontons.The order of fried wontons came out in less than 5 minutes! they were all shrimp and delicious but just a tad bit greasy. Beef ramen and wonton soup came next. Hubby started to eat the ramen and I could tell after two bites he was so not into it. My wonton soup was great..filled with tender all shrimp wontons nice greens and a very soothing broth. I said lets switch. He gladly gave me the big bowl of ramen( have to say the portion for 4.95 is quite large) The noodles were okay(not overcooked which for me would be a huge sin for ramen) the beef was tender but fatty and the broth..eww just not for us. Then came the chicken wings just in time to save the day! OMG! So delicious! Perfectly crispy skin and amazingly juicy with just the right amount of spice. Would go again just for the wings! The chef and owner came by to ask how everything was and noticed right away the still full bowl of ramen and asked what was wrong. We told them the noodles were good and beef was okay ..the broth just not to our taste. They explained to us they use plain broth in their ramen (not seasoned and no msg). We said no problem three out of four is not bad . We were soon finished and got the check. I was a little surprised they didn't take the ramen off the bill but I didn't feel that bad cause it was only 4.95. But having been a small business owner myself..I would have instantly taken it off the bill. Nonetheless I think they might get a second visit from me. Three out of four dishes being good and the prices being so affordable..I am eager to try more dishes especially the whole dungeness crab.",LUrMJLH1GfNXUWYR458mVw,3,1,3,BzdKYkRgEUXgmvzV25mu6w

For all the wonderful ratings, I was amazed at the piss-poor service I got. Out of 200+ yelp reviews I've written, this is the worst service I've ever experienced in my entire life, from the owner nonetheless.

Let's start with the prices. Yes, this is the cheapest food you'll find on the planet. $5-6 for a full size entree including rice, meat, and veggies. Food comes out hot and fresh and presented nicely. Because of the low prices, the restaurant itself looks shabby. Sticky tables, uninspiring lighting, crappy chairs. 

The food tastes decent. I wasn't blown away by it, but for 5 bucks I could come here for lunch every day and leave happy.

Now, the service. The instant we sat down, hungry with expectations, the owner strutted over wearing his white chef's hat. He threw the menus on the table without even looking at us. Lazily, he strutted away without uttering a word. He deposited water on the table. We asked for hot water. He scowled and left without a backwards glance.

We ordered and he wrote it down, again silent. No smile, no acknowledgement we had even been heard. When the food came, he shoved it at us. A member of my party was reading a newspaper; he shoved the food into the newspaper. Disgusting.",dJh6gcvrZR2UqM645CNthw,2,0,1,P_ppOz_dfQ_EyNS2VYZLzA

Read about the place in an old Las Vegas Weekly mag and put it on the list of 'places to try'. My guy was hungry for beef ramen, so we had beef ramen, hoi nam chicken with special rice, and salt n pepper chicken wings. The beef ramen was tasty but um... it tasted like pho. The broth had that distinct 'anise' flavor that adding 'five spice' brings. Our first tip off should have been when our chubby waitress said ""you want tendons with that?"" (we did). If you want your ramen to taste like pho, this is the place. The hoi nam chicken came with special rice and 2 sauces. The rice and sauces made the poached chicken very yummy. The star was the salt n pepper chicken wings. I would go back for them wings and for anything else they serve 'salt n pepper'  style. That was the winner! Our 3 orders set us back about $15, less than a drink at a hi-style restaurant on the Strip, so no complaints about the price. The service was a joke. The chubby waitress with the pony tail and glasses was/is the quintessential inefficient wait help: slow to come over and take your order, slow in bringing the check, all the while acting flustered like she is overwhelmed (the place doesn't have a zillion tables).

I have a deep appreciation for this restaurant as it shares the same last name as me so I held it to very high expectations. 

The place inside definitely reminds you of a ""cheap"" Chinese restaurant as it is pretty basic inside and they use styrofoam cups for water and plastic utensils. They actually just got new menus and some new pictures on the wall I think. Passing the savings on to the consumer? I am all for it. One small thing is that the prices have increased on their menu over the past year or so. 

All in all, you can never go wrong with their hainam chicken or soup noodles especially for the price! (~$6) I wouldn't come in here expecting even a four star quality meal but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. I recommend getting the dark meat with the rice since it's a lot more tender than the white meat and not typical dark meat in chicken.

Their Beef Ramen is essentially just the typical Chinese beef brisket noodle soup. If you are looking for Japanese ramen you will be very disappointed. You can even 'substitute' the ramen with the normal rice noodle. It wasn't bad. The brisket could be more tender.

The specialty Hai Nan Chicken Rice was reasonably tasty. For those of you not familiar, the rice accompanying this dish is just as, if not more, important than the chicken itself. I found the rice here quite nice. It has right amount of subtle flavors and not overly greasy. The sauce for the chicken was mellow. The flavors could really be stronger.

For one, the food is not drenched in oil or extremely salty... everything has a unique flavor I can't say I find in any other Chinese place. Everything is extremely reasonably priced as well! 

TO START: Get the SHRIMP WONTONS. Fried to a perfect crisp, these babies are so flavorful. I can't put my finger on it, but they are just so addicting. One order comes with 10 pieces, are a good size and comes with a light sweet n' sour sauce. Do it!

FOR HER: I swear by their HOUSE SPECIAL SHRIMP WONTON WITH NOODLE SOUP. The soup is a broth that is not too salty but so savory. Comes with thin noodles, Chinese broccoli and steamed shrimp wontons. So extremely satisfying every time! 

FOR HIM: He ordered the BEEF RAMEN WITH TENDON. The beef was so tender and was seasoned perfectly, and the soup again was not too salty but absolutely perfect. Not a fan of tendon texture, but he ate everything and said it was all so good!

TO FINISH: We tried the ALMOND PUDDING just to get a little sweet fix. A small cup portion, but it wasn't too sugary!

1258088,2015-10-23,2,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Yesterday, me and my girl were in search of a cheap place for lunch in China town. Fueled by good yelp reviews and low prices, we found ourselves at Big Wong.  While the reviews rang true:  the place is 'cheap,' the portions ample, and the service friendly, I found myself disappointed with the lack of color and flavor in each dish.  None of our dishes came with ANY type of veggies, and common sauces found in Asian food (General Tsao's, Sweet n Sour, Orange, etc.)were completely absent from the selection.  We started with the Salt n' Pepper wings, which were the only item I tried that were actually quite tasty.  The downside is they only serve the smaller wing piece, no drums.  Then, we ordered a smorgasbord so that we could sample a bit of this and that.  
Beef Ramen:  The beef was tasty, but had just as many pieces of fat as actual meat.  The noodles were a great consistency and the broth had hints of cinnamon.   We realized almost too late that they did give us some green onions on the side to amp up the flavor.  
Chicken Curry:  Sandra said it was delicious.  It looked too unappealing for me to try, plus I could tell it was made with stringy dark meat.
Fried Chicken with 'Seasoned' Rice:  This was one of the many times our server told me 'NO'.  No, they don't have a fried rice option, No, there are no veggies in the dish.  No, I can't add a few pieces of broccoli to it.  Instead, if I wanted any vegetables, I would have to pay an additional $5.95 for an entire veggie stir fry lunch. 
I paid the additional charge for the white meat chicken, which actually had a nice light crunchy coating but had absolutely no seasoning on it.  I found myself wishing I could have this flavored like the Salt n' Pepper wings.  The 'seasoned' rice seemed to have been cooked in a simple broth.  Again, no actual seasoning, no hints of veggies, nada.  This was also served with a questionable looking 'partially boiled egg' that neither of us was willing to try.
The Veggie Stir fry:  Because I actually LOVE veggies WAY more than most people, I sprang for the extra full-price charge to have the veggie plate, which was a simple dish of some cross between broccoli rabe and spinach.  There were just as many huge chunks of stalk as leaves.  I cut up some of the leaves and some of the jalapenos that garnished the aforementioned wings, added that to my chicken and rice dish--now I had some flavor.  
Did I love Big Wong?  No.  Did I hate it?  No.  Did I take the leftovers home and doctor them up with some peppers, onion, mushroom, sesame oil, soy sauce, pepper, garlic, and cayenne?  You better believe it----that shizzle was delicious.  
Bottom line:  If you don't mind your lunch plate consisting of several different shades of beige and/or are eating on a budget, you should find this spot ideal.

I don't know if this was just an every day thing or a holiday thing, but the server gave us tea in styrofoam cups. Odd. Very odd. What restaurant actually does that? Mm..

The lady server we had gotten didn't seem friendly. If anything, she seemed annoyed when she took our order. There was 10 of us so maybe that was overwhelming, but it just looked like we were troubling her by our order or something. 

The styrofoam cups should have gave me a clue. Besides their plates and bowls, everything else we had gotten was plastic. I had ordered their hoi nam chicken rice with white breast meat and oh man, it was... super dry. The sauce they gave me for it didn't even help hide the dryness of it. Ugh. I washed down the rest of the chicken while promising myself that I will never get this again. The rice it came with was good, but it didn't save the chicken.

1368871,2016-07-08,3,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Pardon the novel, but after reading through many of the negative reviews, I decided I needed to write my own, because I've grown to love this place after feeling the same sort of way, as many of the less than 3 star reviews, in the beginning.

Here's the deal...the prices are amazing, the food is consistent and delicious, the portions are well beyond their prices, the service could be improved (from a new guest's standpoint) and no, they don't serve their drinks in fancy glasses or give you nice silverware. I'm a big fan of good food and a bigger fan of good food at a great price (this is not to say I don't enjoy my fancy meals, too). I don't care that I'm not drinking out of crystal...and for those of you that complain about the plastic forks...maybe you should learn to use chopsticks. :P

Yes, when my friend and I first started going, we were hesitant to think much of the place because it seems to be a crazy environment. However, after going time and time again, it's just how they work. They work morning through night with little help and still manage to keep the doors open. How many of you could do that day in and day out?? After building a rapport, I see the kind and humorous side in Connie (the lady that we all know) and Paul (the guy with the ""fluffy chef's hat"" ). Even the guy who gets louder (whose name I don't know) can have a softer side when he's not going crazy with orders.

No, we don't always have our water refilled, yes, the orders sometimes do take long to even be taken, and we used to comment among ourselves, but this place has become a staple for us to dine in during our lunch break. We gave it time, not just one...or even three times...but more because the food/prices kept us coming back. But each time you go, you understand the dynamic more and learn to appreciate, or even find the humor in it.

Many of the negative reviews are regarding their service standards and that some of their dishes being bland. One of the main dishes that I noticed people commenting on is the Hoi Nam chicken, better known as Singaporean Hainanese chicken. The chicken is meant to be prepared that way (bland) with sauces to accompany. And that sauce that goes along with...delicious! Do I like the dish? Let's just say that I don't hate it, but it's not something I would typically order for the very same reason that many of you have commented. But this does NOT mean that all foods are created equal.

But, I do recommend some of the following dishes as they are also our go-to's:

Salt and pepper chicken wings - they're crispy, salty and the addition of the jalapenos (usually) pack a good amount of punch!

Salt and pepper pork chop - same as the chicken wings in flavor - 99% of the time, it's been the most moist pork I've ever had

Thin rib eye - yes, it's fatty but some people like that; yes, it's served with potatoes and it seems odd; no, it doesn't seem like Asian food - how many of you like Asian food but have partners or friends that don't? Well, then maybe that will answer your question as to why this is on their menu...

Curry Chicken - you need to realize that this isn't your typical Thai or Indian curry chicken, it's Malaysian, and yes, it tastes different than what you're used to, and that's amazing - stop comparing apples to oranges

Chicken with mushroom and Chinese sausage - this dish takes a long time to prepare, so be warned, but it's worth it; the chicken is tender, the broth is rich, and Chinese sausage as well as some veggies are just served on the side. The veggies have no seasoning, but it's meant to be dipped into the broth. (In fact, I left during this review to eat there and had it.)

Steamed fish filet - we got this only because we saw it on the new picture menu on the wall and again, without the sauce, it would be bland, BUT it's tender and delicious with the ginger soy sauce. I've ordered it twice, now.

So, for those of you that gave negative reviews...I suggest you give it another shot and get something you know will be good. For those of you that haven't tried, go with the S&P wings and/or pork chop and Steamed chicken and mushroom w/Chinese sausage. Though, I'm sure some of you will still be tough to please.",nTtSXvrWWQ0NNuJfadRNPQ,0,1,5,aW1qni2wSB8ceFrflLfVxg

When we got there, there was a hostess/waitress who looked really irritated to see us. She promptly sat us down and we said thanks and she doesn't even acknowledge it, just walks off. I was a little put off by the service but I just shrugged it off. We looked at the menu and we ordered a plate of the chicken wings to share between us, the beef ramen for my boyfriend, the double
Fish ball noodle soup for me, and two Thai teas. 
We got our drinks in a styrofoam cup. It was weird but I guess that's their norm. I drank it pretty quickly since it was small, and had to ask for a water within 5 minutes. Also a styrofoam cup. 
We then got our food. My boyfriend thought his ramen was okay, nothing special. I thought my noodle soup was bland beyond words. The soup tasted really watered down, I had to put in a ton of sriracha to give it any flavor at all. The wings were really good though, that was worth every penny. 

Some things bugged me a little during our visit there though. The kitchen is within full view to the restaurant which means I can hear the staff in there talking. At one point, I heard one of the guys in there raise his voice to another guy about not working hard enough? It was pretty loud and was a little unprofessional. 
Also, the waitress who was unfriendly the whole time, was on the verge of unpleasant. She seemed like she didn't want to be there serving us the whole time and I felt the negative vibe.

The prices here are ridiculously cheap with awesome speedy service. 

The beef ramen is a must try and it's one of their popular items on the menu. I can never finish the bowl no matter how much I was hungry on that day.

If you are a big fan of Hainan chicken, it's no doubt that you have heard of the famous Savoy Kitchen in Los Angeles. However, Vegas doesn't serve very tasty Hainan chicken but Big Wong definitely will satisfy your craving if you cannot make it to Savoy Kitchen instantly! 

I always order the Hainan chicken rice and seasonal stir-fry vegetables. I also really love the salt and pepper chicken wings, chicken curry with roti, and the sweet roti with condensed milk. There are quite a few things I don't particularly like from here, such as the beef noodles thatt tasted very bland when I tried it. However, the good things weigh out the bad and you cannot beat the price of their dishes! 

I don't suggest coming here if you are someone who is looking for a spot with excellent customer service, as many authentic Asian places don't carry that to begin with. Give this place a try and I'm sure you'll enjoy the food and won't leave with a hole in your wallet!",KLUvRyRDUftXgFvUx50Kyg,2,1,4,PKAlN70ZHjJxyAzlYCSCQg

I haven't tried a lot of their other items because I only come here for the curry, but their vegetables are also very tasty. I recommend ordering the Bok Choy with your curry.

Their curry has the perfect amount of spice for me and a good ratio of meat/potatoes/rice. I usually get the beef curry or chicken curry w/ roti pancakes (only 4.95)

Now I have read that people don't really get the best service here, which is true. Personally, I just come here to quickly satisfy my curry craving and the food comes out so fast that I don't even care about extra service. This place is definitely worth the price and even if you don't like it, your wallet won't be crying.",utjpVFySRyXGM-X9znTq0Q,1,0,3,3jMoVBnBwzpdw58rI-W3Ug
1571220,2014-12-30,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Came here with a group of 5 in the early evening before the dinner rush. Ordered a bunch of things on the menu including the Hainan chicken and rice, braised beef, salt and pepper shrimp, steamed fish fillet, and wonton soup, as well as various stir fried veggies.

The food is good for the value, there is no doubt. The least impressive item was the braised beef, which featured small pieces of beef drowning in bland beef sludge. 

The service is some of the worst I have seen, and I am no stranger to the curt, no nonsense style that is typical to Chinese restaurants. The lady who was working the counter and taking orders was just plain mean. I saw her yell at a group of customers for wanting to sit at a different table...she literally glared at them for a minute and then finally brought them their menus. We wanted to order more food halfway through the meal. After failing to get her attention we went up to the counter, and were told that our order would be placed at the very end of the queue in this crowded restaurant. Fine! No more food! So we asked for more rice, which was brought over in a huff and slammed on our table. Kind of made for a tense dining experience, if you ask me.

1589243,2011-08-12,1,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"I was gonna give this place a 5 star rating for their awesome curry chicken, but the service really made a difference. There was only one person working in the front trying to handle 7 tables. I'd be irritated if I were in their place, but wasn't an excuse for her unfriendly attitude towards customers. 

She ended up spilling a cup of water on my cousin as she arrived with his food. Then she left the empty cup on our table and spill on the floor for about 5 minutes before doing anything about it, which seemed potentially hazardous.

My bill was $9.90 and when I went up to pay, the lady was like, ""minimum $10 to use a card."" I said, ""What if I add tip to the card?"" and she said, ""No."" I was like, ""Really? Why don't you just add 10 cents to my bill then?"" She proceeded to give me a dirty look, and just swiped my card and charged me $9.90 - but wait a minute, I thought $10 was the minimum, Lol.

Anyway, service aside, the food is excellent and the prices are really cheap for the portion that you get. If you can look past the quality of service and some of the tackiness about the place (it felt like they weren't using A/C, their water and tea is served in styrofoam cups, and there's multicolored posterboard [the same that people use for yard sales] with menu items written down and taped to the wall), then I'd recommend coming here to eat if you're in the mood for various, cheap Asian-style food.",WNly4HJku_yWLBfdXpxyUQ,2,1,2,a_6W4OEgAK5jGXxN25MAHw

- house special shrimp wonton with ramen soup (came with 5 shrimp wontons; loved the broth - just the right taste to my liking, wasn't too salty; did not skimp on the ramen)
- special deep fried chicken over rice (chicken was fried just right.. really juicy and really liked how it was boneless.. however we weren't not crazy about the sauce it came with. We just dipped our chicken in the curry from the prior dish.)

Our meal with an order of 2 sodas came to just over $16.00! What a deal! Our server (who may be one of the owners) was pretty friendly as well. Not an extensive selection of items on the menu, but we are still looking forward to our next visit & trying different items.

Being Chinese I know I shouldn't expect the service to be good because that's how most Chinese restaurants are. But this one, they don't give a damn about their customers.

 I also ordered some of the Beef Ramen it tasted somewhat buttery with an after taste of what I can only describe as Vaseline intense care hand lotion. I know that sounds weird but I could barely eat it with the after taste it left me.

4. Wonton noodles - simple basic and gets the job done. My dads a vegetarian and can eat 2 big bowl of noodles so the noodles were for him. The wontons are very basic not a huge piece of shrimp or anything. I do think it has more skin than meat but it was not bad. I probably wouldn't order this dish again and try the other ones!

I ordered the Shrimp Wonton soup. Steamed wontons in a very delicious broth. I was recovering from a cold, so this was very necessary. 

Everything was simply perfect, down to the addition of baby bok choy in the soup.

- Beef Stew - Oh comfort food.  This is it!  It had a slightly spicy kick with the sauce.  Even in warm weather, this was comforting.
- Veggies and Oyster Sauce - This dish was a little sub par.  Veggies were chopped to 2"" chunks which left the fun out of eating our greens!

It is served in a sizzling platter so you get the crunchiness of the sear.
Curry chicken is good with the roti.  Fried chicken wings are tasty but pass on the salt and pepper pork.  Also lacking in flavor.

1772191,2017-10-15,4,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"The bountiful glowing reviews for this place greatly confuse me. I came with my family on Friday night; it was pretty early, so there were only three other parties in the restaurant. The setup of the place is very clean and simple; nothing to complain about.

On to the menu, the dishes here are obscenely cheap! Especially considering that this is a mom and pop shop, I wonder how they manage to make any money. We ordered four ""Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice,"" large ribeye with a side of bok choy, and choy sum with oyster sauce. Portions were generous, which I also appreciated. And....that's about all of the accolades I can give this place.

I have not had hainan chicken anywhere else in Vegas; HOWEVER, I have had this dish plenty of times at multiple different places in Southern California--and it is a dish frequently made at home. An AUTHENTIC version of this dish uses free range chicken where the chicken does not feel very tough when boiled. That was not the case here. I get that it's probably what's keeping the price so low, but c'monnnn, can you not advertise it as authentic then? Additionally, the rice was overly mushy--too much chicken stock/water was used to cook it. The rice was not very fragrant; they could've benefited from throwing in garlic and ginger into the mix. Sauces were okay--nothing to write home about. The ribeye was a great deal for $12. It was pretty fatty, but hey, it's $12 bucks, so I won't complain too much. Choy sum was literally just blanched and then had oyster sauce poured over it; it would've been better if they had sauteed the veggies with the oyster sauce. Pouring it directly over just makes the dish super salty. I know I'm being super nit picky, given that this is a super cheap place. Food was passable. If judging on food alone, I would come back every so often.

So why the 2 stars? My biggest gripe with this place is the service. I've been to plenty of Chinese restaurants and know that service is not priority. What annoyed me the most was that we never got a friendly smile out of our waiter--and I definitely saw him smile at other patrons. My aunt tried ordering in Chinese (because hellooooo, Chinese restaurant with part of menu written in Chinese)--and the waiter rudely interrupts, ""English only. I'm not Chinese."" Okay. I have nothing against not being able to speak a language, but there's definitely a more tactful way of conveying that to your patrons. Then, as we were ordering our dishes, he stops us mid-order and tells us we are ordering too much food and that three chicken dishes + extra rice is sufficient for our party of four. O.K. So if I overorder, can I not bring it home? Isn't it beneficial for the business for patrons to order more food? More orders = more money? If I was concerned about portions, then I would ask you about the portion sizes, no? But okay. 

TL;DR
Super cheap food. Passable food. But you better have super thick skin x239028390 for the awful service/free advice on how much you should be eating.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,8,2,2,XNIsDDxGebbJP3Dozcgmfg

The server was very friendly.  From where I sat I could see directly into the kitchen and that entertained me watching the chef prepare the dishes.  Everything seemed to be clean, orderly and efficiently handled by both the server and the chef.

My food came out and was very satisfying.  The chicken wings had a generous amount of jalapenos and that made me happy.  The bok choy was generously seasoned with garlic.  It was good but glad I didn't have to kiss anybody that day!  I liked that the bok choy was very young and so it made it easy to eat.

As I was sipping on my tea looking around I began to notice a few things.  There are a number of brightly colored posters on the walls.  A suggestion to the management if I may:  I don't see your patrons going around and reading the posters.  The posters don't send a positive marketing message overall.  I think it would look better to take them down and either don't replace with anything or maybe a few pictures on a theme.  I also noticed that while the kitchen and the table I was eating on seemed very clean, the backs of the chairs were not clean and the floors and baseboards need a good scrubbing.  I hope management will think about my suggestions.

I was very satisfied with my meal and I look forward to going back to such a friendly restaurant.",VtLdzz_1olnpRU6AuSsEVg,5,2,3,giD_45KCS85u3Yyq15U_Lw

Heard the spicy wings were great and they were! Perfectly done! Had a huge punch. Had to get something my picky son would eat and he likes curry so got him chicken curry with rice. It was good just like how my mom would've made it. Homey and a bit too much potatoes. I am not a huge fan of Hunan chicken but it's not easy to find a good one so I wanted to introduce that to the rest of the family. This one was done perfectly and they liked it. My fishball loving son of course loved the soup. It was actually recommended my the waitress/owner? Since they ran out of porridge :( the soup base and noodles were great and the shrimp wontons were one of the best we have had. My kids loved noodles so we got another soup noodle dish, beef tendon. It was fatty but tasty. 
We enjoyed it all a lot despite it being a very small place and even though our family was large she sat us by ourselves but the tables were very near so it didn't feel that comfortable but hey we came here to eat. Water tasted fine and restrooms weren't that dirty. But yes it seemed like she's the only one working there but still the food came out quick. She seemed very busy and a bit stressed and absentminded but still got our orders and dishes as prompt as possible. Felt a tad bad for her lol
The price was reasonable even though the dishes weren't that big. But we just had a huge lunch buffet so if it wasn't for that we may had to order some more. 
This was a fun find. I loved it most because I knew how these dishes were supposed to taste and they were on point.

The food was excellent all around but the broth in the spicy shrimp soup was the best I've had in a long time!  

One thing to note - the roti bread that comes with the chicken curry is not the typical South Asian variety you find at an Indian restaurant.  Rather, it is a flaky sesame ""bing"" (Chinese pancake) - the type you can buy frozen from the Asian market for $1.  Still very good, just FYI.

Next time, I'm going to try the soy sauce chicken. The table next to ours ordered it just before we finished our meal and it looked delicious!",TFOQIIHa9Zeb-PbFWlwAGQ,1,1,4,_qsFcuJkUu--OBdak_1qyA

Service is attentive and food is out quick.
Soups are all fabulous: the wonton skins used are not cheap and the quality is evident when you bite into the shrimp-packed parcels. Broth was very flavorful and had just a bit of a spicy kick to it. Strongly prefer the udon noodles to the ramen noodles that are your other option. Both the WONTON SOUP and the HOUSE SEAFOOD NOODLE SOUP are good picks.

BEEF STEW is hearty and delicious, and the gravy had undertones of flavor that were reminiscent of pho. Not sure if they include bone broth in the gravy or if it's a particular aromatic, but the gravy had good flavor and the meat was tender.
STEAMED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOMS AND SAUSAGE is a solid, filling dish, served with rice and greens. Flavorful sauce is light, sausage is salty, and flavors complement one another for a balanced dish.
SALT AND PEPPER WINGS are very salty and very peppery. Pretty sure this is not a dish you could order by itself, as even to eat just three of them I had to space out bites of wing with that of other dishes- if you have HBP you might want to steer clear, as the salt in this dish was quite high.

Vegetable dishes here are solid: the baby bok choy in garlic sauce is my favorite (second only to the one at Ichiza but the portion here is  three times the size), and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce is a staple as well.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,10,4,4,U2YlVttXPLPl1frW7UJTrw

Looking through the menu, most of the items are under $5.00... my college fund definitely goes a long way in this place!!  I decided to try out their hainanese chicken since that is what the restaurant is mainly known for.  Being it my first time having such dish, I thought it was actually quite delicious!

Also tried their chicken curry with roti and a fried pork dish... but thought I would rather get those elsewhere.

Would I go back to this place with their normal prices? Probably. 
Would I come back here often? Probably not. 

On my first visit I indulged and ordered two items. First off was the fried pork chop. It was disappointing to say the least. It was kind of bland and chewy. The sauce that accompanied it was pretty tasty though.The highlight of the dish was the perfecly cooked boiled egg that came with it, which provided for a nice surprise. The second item ordered was their wonton soup. This was actually quite good. The wontons were cooked well and the broth was good. It had nice flavor without being too salty. 

The second time going, I ordered their hainan chicken [which is served cold by the way, as it helps keep the chicken tender]. The chicken was mediocre. But how nice can cold steamed chicken really get? The rice that accompanies it is supposed to be 'seasoned.' I didn't taste much of a difference between that and their regular white rice though. I guess the highlight of the dish were the two sauces that come with. Mix em together, and you have a killer sauce which makes up for the rest of the dish. I'd probably order this dish again, just to get the sauce. 

All in all, the service is pretty good. I was surprised that everyone was being so friendly, considering the hectic days they must have had opening the restaurant. And the quickness of the food coming out was great as well. Their prices are pretty decent as well. There's nothing for more than five dollars, and all prices are tax included. 

So, if you want a cheap Chinese meal, definitely come here. And just a side note - if you go hungry, I'd avoid ordering the pork chop. The serving size is a lot smaller compared to the chicken. When I ordered the pork & wonton soup, I easily ate both [& I hate to admit it, because it makes me seem like a fatty, but I could've eaten more. =p].

We also got an order of the roti and chinese broccoli to share. The Hainan chicken rice was...mediocre. I really wanted it to be amazing. The chicken was OK. It wasn't quite a moist and silky as I was hoping. The rice could have been a bit more fragrant. I know I can't really be that picky when it comes to Hainanese Chicken rice as there aren't too many options. The chicken curry was flavorful, but would have liked it to be a bit spicier (or spicy at all). Finally, we ordered the stir fried chinese broccoli that came on a hot place.

The Mom and Pop restaurant houses a relatively simple space that serves a variety of rice, noodle, and soup dishes.  

Prices are great with everything under $10 and the orders come out fast.  Appears popular with the Chinese speaking crowd. 

Beef Ramen - several reviews mention this so we had to order.  In reality, it's just Chinese beef noodle soup but using ramen noodles.  Perhaps an attempt by the owners to capitalize on the ramen craze. Overall, broth was clear and tasty but not as flavorful as most top ramen places in California or NYC.   Beef pieces were very tender and the tendons were melt in your mouth. 

Hainan Chicken - tender boneless dark chicken meat.  Had to ask for the minced garlic.  Overall found the dish a bit muted in flavor but better with the sauces. 

Baby bok choy - stir fried in wok.  Standard fare.  

Salt and pepper chicken wings - delicious.  Nice slices of pepper.  Perfectly deep fried. Good stuff. 

Overall we had a good meal.  Big Wong isn't in the league of any joint in SF, LA, Vancouver or NYC but for Vegas, it's a nice find.  Their soy sauce chicken looks fantastic...maybe next time.

It's cheap, it's good, it's fast, it's served piping hot & it hasn't made me sick the 3 times I've tried it.  Easily my favorite wonton soup in the valley.  The added greens are a nice touch.  All the other times I've had wonton soup, it was just the wontons.

Granted, I need to try other things on their menu, but I always fill up on the wonton & am satisfied.  Don't expect anything fancy when you arrive.  I simply come here for a quick & delicious bowl of soup...not the decor.  

If you don't feel like waiting to be seated at Monta...give this place (in the same strip mall/parking lot) a shot.",0E2Q9mJsMdQ0hRkKTVWuag,5,2,4,9xfPmiqAq7bEnB-dG_Id1Q
2345980,2015-10-31,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"My family comes here every time we're in Vegas. And let's just say that I can't recall a month in the last year that my family hasn't spontaneously decided on a trip to Vegas. Yeah, we're here so often that we might as well be considered locals. Heck, ask my sisters for directions and she can point you in the precise direction. 

I'm going to  just come out and say that I'm not exactly a big fan of Big Wong in terms of food. Everytime, the food just looks so darn appetizing. And then I bite into it and am filled with disappointment. I'm not a fan of the Hoi nam chicken, the pork chop with rice, and the ribeye with pasta. The Hoi nam chicken is underseasoned (but the sauces and the rice are delicious), the pork chop can be more crispy, and the sauce that is supposed to go with the pasta provides no taste for the pasta. So yeah, there is a huge lack of flavor sometimes. 

So why 4 stars? Lord, the prices. Most of the dishes are $4.95. Yes. There is still a place in Las Vegas you can eat for $5 that does not consist of In-n-out or tiny slices of pizza. Despite my less than stellar experience with the foods previously listed, there are some standout dishes that you should definitely try. The chicken wings are superb. the ribeye is actually pretty good and I usually just order that and take the noodles to go (then douse it with something else), the sizzling plate veggies are amazing (ask the old Asian guy who does everything for it!), the shrimp wontons hit the right spot, and the beef ramen is a combination of college dorm life and fancy gourmet ramen shop. You are guaranteed to leave STUFFED.

Just a warning though. Don't come here and expect perfect customer service. This is a Chinese restaurant son! The one guy who does it all, the old Asian guy with the white hat, doesn't smile (unless you have a giggling baby in your arms), and doesn't speak Chinese. Expect comfort food at insanely cheap prices and you'll leave a happy customer. 

The parking also sucks because Big Wong shares the same parking lot with Vegas favorites, Kung Fu Tea and Monta Ramen. Be patient and if that doesn't work out, there's a deserted furniture store to the left of Big Wong's. Take the risk and park there if you want.

If you want take out be sure to call your order in before showing up to avoid being questioned why you didn't call in advance. And when dining in, don't ask for split checks because this just pisses off the lady too and she'll likely tell you off like she did to us. Prices also have gone up in the last few months because they now charge sales tax, whereas before it was always included in the price.

I usually get the same few things when coming here: hoi nam chicken w/ seasoned rice, fried chicken or the chicken wings. I've been avoiding the fried items lately because I'm always told that it takes an extra 20-30 min...is it never prepped in advance? Very odd. The only thing I would NOT recommend getting is the beef ramen because this is a Chinese place and they don't make it right. I think they're only offering it to compete with Monta next door and it's definitely not worth getting despite the cheap $5.95 price tag.

People think this place is fast but it's really not. I'm always waiting a while for my food whether I'm dining in or taking out.

Parking can be difficult to find, but there's a lot right across the street you can probably park at. 

The atmosphere is a whole different story. I would have rated this place with 2 stars if it weren't for the good food. It's a smaller restaurant where the kitchen is right by the seating area, and there isn't a door or anything that separates the 2 rooms. The service isn't bad, but there is only one main server running the entire restaurant with 2 other guys helping. The wait time to order, have our food served, and everything overall was short considering how short staffed they were. Then there's the main guy who seems to be the manager, directing everyone what to do and what tables to serve. Except he isn't talking to them in an indoor voice... he's literally shouting at them and the entire restaurant is listening. It's like they were putting on a show for us. I get that he's trying to run the restaurant efficiently, which he was, but they need to have a door separating the rooms. He needs to understand that this does not create a peaceful dining experience for his customers.

The incentive to quality control this new eatery was that if you paid a dollar for your beverage (and mind you if you're reading this review 5/17/11-5/18/11 it's still going on), your entree was FREE! 

No, that's not a typo, it's true. FREE. The three amigos ate for $3 dollars (plus tip) last night.

We received our food, one dish at a time and about 5 to 15 minutes in between each other, but I would say despite the wait, the food was actually quite tasty! 

I will give them a small exception that it was in fact their opening night and all, but common..Your menu is tiny, your items are numbered and the Restaurant seats about 10 tables MAX. Perhaps I'm being harsh but I don't see what the struggle to get food out in a timely fashion was all about..just sayin.

I ordered the curry with rice, curry with pancakes, salt and pepper chicken, shrimp won tons, and the boneless chicken!!

Curry with rice: average. Nothing special. Def didn't give enough curry sauce because the bowl was quite small and lots of chicken was in there. 5/10. Wouldn't order again bc I'd rather try other items. 

Curry with pancakes: same as above. 5/10. Pancakes were smokin hot though haha

Salt and pepper chicken: 9/10 grab this. Order it. Suck on the bones and the skin until you crave more. Spicy as heck but delicious as heck too. Put this shit in ur mouth. Bite it. Swallow it. So good man. Enough said. 

Shrimp won tons: 6.5/10 nothing special. I am from Orange County so we have Westminster which makes better stuff than this so its prob good for Vegas but eh for where I'm from. 

Boneless chicken: 8/10 wow the two sauces are awesome. Chicken was tender and juicy. Order this for sure guys

Also I thought this place was family style but it looks like each item is for a person except for the chicken wings. Everything is cheap, like $4.99 for everything so I couldn't resist not ordering many times. 

Worth the drive from the Vegas strip in my opinion. Yummy. Snowflake shaved ice is in the same area so that's a plus too.

2472442,2017-01-23,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"I liked that the chef was trying to serve food too. They desperately need servers. There were zero servers, hostess, and busers. Zero front of house! It was obvios too that the cooks were not happy because I can see how they worked and I am a chef myself. No harmony . No team. 

I liked the fact that there was no fried rice, egg rolls, chow mein, sweet and sour or orange chicken. Pretty authentic and prices are $5.50 for an order of eight wings. $7 for 8 little nuggets of black bean pork ribs. The to-go boxes were high quality plastic. However, they were too small. The Chinese box containers would hold more and are more affordable. Soy sauce,salt, sirracha, and pepper are not on the table but are available on request. 

So with no front of the house staff, this place gets only 3 stars due to service operating only at 20% of where it should be and that unhappy back of the house means super slow service too. There was only 3 other tables(maybe a four top , two top, and a one top). I do not recommend dining here if you don't have more than a hour to spare and if there are more than 12 people total dining here(including you).",R23W-ZXt0x71qY5cdwrxVA,0,0,3,83dYUoYdgseVQiYaFUU3Mw

This spot is in a pretty popular little strip mall on Spring Mountain. I've frequented Snow Flake Shavery which is just across the parking lot, but I never quite made it into Big Wong's, until now! 
Came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by all the great, CHEAP eats! 
We ordered 
Salt and pepper chicken wings: these were nicely fried and MOIST! Is that your favorite word?! They were JOOOOSAY! And they were accompanied by sliced jalapenos. YAAAS! 
Salt and pepper pork chops: these were also nicely fried with the lovely jalapeños as well AND they came out SLICED, unlike other places, so I really did appreciate that! 
Steamed Chicken and rice: this is a pretty basic dish. Steamed chicken! What do you expect?! You can feel nice and healthy eating it tho and it comes with a dipping sauce. The chicken rice thingy was very good too! Had a hint of chicken flavor and MOIST! 
Ong choy (light garlic): This veg is SO damn good. I mean REALLY!!! I believe it's called Water Spinach in the English language and i could just it ALL damn day! 
Wonton Soup: I'm not really a fan of wonton soup anyway, this wasn't very exciting for me, but I forgive them!

Beef Curry--It tasted more like a beef stew with curry hints to it. Keep in mind, I love curry but I don't like beef stew so I didn't really like this dish. It was a bit salty for me. 

Hainan Chicken-- You can't go wrong with it but I've definitely had better. The rice wasn't flavored as much as I would have liked it and the chicken was decent. I like the sauce that comes with it.

Even after a very hot August day doing manual labor in a non air conditioned warehouse: I HAD to try the much lauded shrimp wonton with ramen. 

So many people bitch about Yelp hype...these delicate dumplings filled with perfectly cooked, whole shrimp were in a word: divine. The noodles are firm and springy and hold up against any of the hipster noodle joints IMHO. Such a simple dish that is the best I've had outside of Asia! Being a big fan of bok choy, I was going to order it, but the very friendly waitress suggested I try the Chinese Broccoli: fantastic. Each of us enjoyed our respective dishes and I left with two large take away boxes for a treat later on. And, since it is in Chinatown = inexpensive and made fresh under $10 for 2 meals!

Lives up to and beyond the hype. I'm all about the Big Wong. Parking can be tricky as it shares space with many popular spots in a very busy lot but get yoself over there ASAP. Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall, all ya gotta do is call and I'll be there at the Big Wong, yes I will, you've got a fan ;)))

2662758,2015-01-19,6,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Big Wong: not to be confused with Big Wong King, Big Wang's Sports Bar or Lucky Chengs Drag Queen Cabaret - My pal Chan wanted to throw together a little UYE (unofficial yelp event) at Big Wong's; but in his message to me, it indicated we should eat at: his Big Wong? Hahahaha. I died of laughter. Good thing I've had ""Big Wong"" on the radar so our miscommunication was short lived and our friendship was spared.

The UYE was a success and of course, we over-ordered: have you seen those prices!?! The restaurant is a small, unassuming, very hole-in-the-wall, but tidy Chinese spot located in the prime of Chinatown near the likes of Kung Fu Tea (my go-to Boba shop) and other heavy food-hitters like Raku and Curry House Zen.

I ordered a nice dinner-sized portion of (Hai Nam or Hoi Nam on their menu) chicken rice and it was only $4.95! Other known as Hainanese chicken rice, the chicken is poached and then the rich stock cooks and gives aromatic flavor to the rice. Here you can choose between all white meat, dark meat without bone, or dark meat with bone. I went for the dark meat without bone and it was pretty legit. The chicken was plentiful, very moist and the dark meat had lots of flavor. I felt that the rice could have used a little bit more seasoning and aromatic flavor, though the 2 dipping sauces made up for it. There was a slightly sweet, dark soy sauce and also a reddish ginger sauce - that was my favorite. The ginger was extremely aromatic and gave the chicken a lot of freshness and pops of character. Flavor rating: 4/5

We also tried:
Garlic steamed bok choy - very good! The steamed bok choy, still had a slight bite to them and soaked up a lot flavor from all of the garlic bits. Flavor rating: 5/5

Shrimp and wonton noodle soup - We felt that this noodle soup was average. The wontons committed the worst offense: not enough filling. Don't skimp! The egg noodles were abundant and cooked al dente and the broth was simple, but decent. The whole shrimp also had a strange, off-putting mealy texture to them. Flavor rating: 2/5

Ribs in Black Bean sauce - the meat was tender but overall flavor was muted so we weren't too sure what to make of the black bean sauce? This was our least favorite dish. Flavor rating: 2/5

Roti with curry $4.95 - Malaysian style crispy and buttery flat bread/ pancake that is served glistening, crisp and hot. The curry had lovely spices and a tad bit of heat. Plus, they did not skimp on the chicken and potatoes - there were huge chunks in the bowl. Flavor rating: 4/5

The crispy Roti pancakes were my favorite and truly the best I've ever had. They are super flaky, not too oily, and had an extremely addictive butter flavor that almost tasted like a buttery croissant! Flavor rating: 5/5

Big Wong is doing something different in Vegas; keeping it homey, keeping it simple, keeping it affordable. This New York style Chinese joint is a welcome addition to our diverse Las Vegas Chinatown!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,7,4,nChdQb3ppjDrhH-xOw7UVA

Big Wong is your take on HK style eatery. Cheap, filling and no frills. My boy and I got an order of their house special wonton noodle soup, salt and pepper chicken wings and order of ong choy ( water spinach ) made with garlic. 

The wontons were fresh and the snap to the shrimp were on point. The egg noodles were a bit too springy for me and wasn't what I was used to. Broth wise, It was slightly herbaly and lacked standard wonton noodle broth taste. The chicken wings were delish but after 2, It became way too salty. Best dish to be shared.

Seriously, a really good bowl of soup.  It's a broth unlike anything I could compare it with.   The wontons were made with all shrimp filling and the shrimp on top of that makes this a super value at under $8. 

I also ordered some veggies this time.  They did not have any ong choy so I ordered the gai lan cooked in garlic.   The sizzling plate it comes with was nice to see and the aroma of the garlic was in the air.  Loved it.  Gai lan is a bit bitter with the leaves and next time I hope they have the ong choy.

Let me just say that those chicken wings are super addicting and I've been dreaming about them since I first tried it 3 weeks ago. Crunchy, crispy, hot, tender and juicy on the inside... totally to die for. The beef ramen had nice big chunks of tendon-y cuts of beef that taste like they've been stewing for a long time. They're tender and are NOT chewy, AND they ask you if you want tendons in your soup. (UH, HELL YES I DO!) The broth is clear and perfectly seasoned, and the noodles are the eggy hong-kong style that I wish I had more experience in reviewing. But they were really tasty to me.

Was gonna go to SnowFlake Shavery but didn't have dinner yet so we decided to check out this Wong place. After looking over the menu, I was astounded by how simple it was laid out and explained. Most dishes were around the 5 to 6 dollar range. I was excited that it was pretty cheap and at the same time cautious because of the quality you might get because of it. 

First visit I ordered the Shrimp Wonton with Udon noodles and the wifey ordered the Rice Vermiccelli Noodle Soup which she shared with my youngest son. We were all amazed at how hot and fresh both dishes were especially with how fast we received it too. The Shrimp Wonton mixed with Udon Noodles were some of the best Wonton I have had in a while. As for the the other dish my wife and son shared, it was basically a pho bowl, which was pretty good as well.

I was impressed so we came back the next day for lunch to try some of the other items. Our second visit verified that this place was gonna be one of our go to places for good, cheap fast food. What we got this time was the Beef Ramen, Salt n Pepper Porkchop, and Thinly Sliced Ribeye over Rice.  

The Beef Ramen has your basic Ramen Noodles accompanied by tender chunks of Beef Brisket which gave the overall taste of the soup tremendous flavor. The Salt n Pepper Porkchop was exactly that. A deep fried Porkchop lightly coated in salt and pepper, then sliced and garnished with thinly sliced sauteed jalapenos. When you bite into it, all the flavors put together are like a really good orchestra playing in your mouth. I asked for some sweet chili sauce on the side to dip it in and some steamed white rice to accompany it. As for the Thinly Sliced Ribeye, it comes with an au jus type of of gravy to dip it in and then you eat it it with the steamed white rice. Really good flavors from this as well.

The overall total with tax and tip was around 20 dollars. Not bad for all the food I just mentioned! 

Service was decent. They would come around refilling our drinks every so often so I never really had to ask for any refills.

* Beef curry with roti- Since this seemed to be one of the popular dishes raved about we tried it.  Not the most flavorful, kinda bland actually.  I think I can make a better curry than this (and it's made from curry cubes ala box!).

In short, things just don't taste fresh, and they aren't Chinese ENOUGH. 

Salt and pepper chicken wings that people rave about? They're okay. Coming out of the fryer sizzling hot, they do taste good, but nothing about them makes them great. They lack a fresh element. Everything here appears that it can be purchased and stored in bulk via freezer or dry storage. 

Ordered the beef ""ramen,"" which was overly cinnamon-y in flavor and lacking of anything else, including any sort of vegetable or garnish. Even a toss of chopped cilantro could have spruced this plain dish up some, but instead it's just one note and unenjoyable to eat.

Staff was quite angry at each other. Angry, passive-aggressive Chinese guy cooking needs to NOT yell at the woman working front of house. I can understand all of it, and no one else certainly needs to speak Chinese to understand that you're yelling at someone else that you work with.

They also have a steak special that is Under $10, the steak is good (cooked on a flat top so it's a little different) and the sides are fresh (the baby bok choi is amazing)!

We were there when they were not busy and the staff was super friendly and helpful to us picking out dishes.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and even discovered a delicious type of chili sauce that they have on the tables that I have since purchased and use at home.

1) Hainan chicken: this portion size was huge but the chicken was basically just boiled and then put on the platter. good thing they give 2 different sauces to dip the chicken; otherwise - it wouldn't have been tasty. this is not a usual hainan style chicken we've had in los angeles! 3 stars
2) beef ramen w/ shrimp wontons: soup was quite flavorful and shrimp wontons were legit; beef cubes were very soft and tastes great. the ramen noodles were plentiful; couldn't even finish 3.5 stars

I enjoyed the shrimp wontons, but could have done without the fish balls. I was hoping the fish balls were filled w/ minced meat but nope. egg noodles were chewy but soup was lacking in flavor. 3 stars

I ordered one of the new menu items: the Fried Shrimp Wontons (10 for $4.95)- Large pieces of shrimp only lovingly wrapped in delicate wonton wrappers, and then deep fried to crunchy perfection. Served with a sweet & sour sauce. Delicious! I would order this again!

I also tried some of the Chicken Curry and Roti, which was yummy. The curry was spicy and full of hearty potatoes and quality chicken. The roti was both crispy and chewy, and was the perfect dipping tool for the curry.

Commitment to fresh and good-quality ingredients, low-priced meals, nice plastic containers (New York style), and most dishes for only five dollars with tax included wins Big Wong's five stars.

I  first came during their dollar extravaganza days, tried their chicken roti, hoi nam chicken, beef ramen, wonton soup, and have since those days gone back about three different times. They do most things quite well, and probably do most things best in Las Vegas.

They are a café different from KJ's Kitchen, Wendy's Café and U&Me Café. Different doesn't mean better. Different just means different. 

I enjoyed their salt and pepper chicken wings. I heard from the owner that his recipe is 25-30 years old. The skin is very crispy, and the chili slices add much flavor to the skin. But to be fair, how can you go wrong with chicken wings and salt and pepper?

My favorite dish is the curry chicken roti. The day that I went, they ran out of curry chicken, but they let me do the beef curry and just pay $1.50 more for extra roti. It was so delicious! The curry is not too thin or thick, just the right texture for you to dip your roti. The chicken is tender and moist, even beneath the curry.

Another notable offering they have is the fried wonton. The shrimp inside was so juicy, the skin outside was so crisp, and everything just worked so well together with the tangy sauce. 

The hoi nam chicken can come on the bone or deboned with dark meat or white meat, so it's up to you to choose. We got dark meat on the bone, but have also tried boneless. It comes with no extra sauce. The rice is pretty good. I'd have to say that my favorite Hainan (Hoi Nam) chicken rice is still from Savoy in Alhambra, CA. However, in Las Vegas, this is a pretty good version. U&Me Café also has an okay version.

Definitely, when you're done with your meal, order their mango or almond jello. I have tried both. The jellos are extravagance in a cup. There's real fruit inside of the jello cup, and it looks so simple, but if you really think about it, the flavor pairings are simply culinary genius: real longan inside of almond jello. Mm... yum!

My favorite thing about Big Wong's is that the chef really prides himself in not compromising in quality for quantity. He provides both those things. 

Service is great. Connie is very quick to take your order, and quick to deliver your food. I believe another waitress, Winnie, is also there and she helps to run food as well.

This place is great for large groups, couples, or for a quick solo lunch. Prices are so affordable, that I can go back again and again without my wallet hurting, unlike its surrounding restaurants.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,5,1,5,9LXqXcvVGYQvV2WcuTSLhA

My boyfriend and I come here every so often and order the same appetizer, entree and dessert every single time. 

Appetizer: 10 piece fried shrimp wontons. These are quite addicting. Just like how you open up a box of Pringles or start munching on some microwavable popcorn and you cant stop? Yeah, that addicting. Each simple wonton has a huge piece of shrimp and are perfectly fried, accompanied by sweet and sour sauce.   

Entree: Just when we're about to order more shrimp wontons, our Thin Rib-eye over Pasta is sent to our table. For $4.95, this dish is absolute heaven, both for our bellies and our wallet. They don't skimp out on the meat and comes with a side of steamed potatoes. We like to pour the brown sauce (some type of beef broth thing) all over the plate to tie the rib-eye, pasta and potatoes together.  

Dessert: Sweet roti drizzled in condensed milk is the way to go! My boyfriend is lactose intolerant so I end up eating most of this myself. The almond pudding is also divine. So refreshing - it's the perfect end note to the meal. You can't go wrong with these two items for a grand total of $2.25. 

This place is located in a small strip mall with minimal decor and menu items handwritten on neon poster boards all over their walls. Don't judge a book by its cover, though. The food is seriously amazing for what you pay for. 

Oh yeah, if you end up ordering to-go or box up your leftovers, their to-go boxes are top notch and reusable. Fancy plastic to use again and again!",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,1,1,5,rrj2H1iJK0GGSlZ0oiqz2Q

I also gave the wonton soup a try and that hit the spot with its Savory broth and I'm not sure what the veggies in the soup was but it tasted like green onions and some other type of kale like green in it that work pretty well as they gave a bitter contrast. 

To drink I recommend getting the jasmine tea.

Now to the review. Big Wong specializes in regional cuisine, as such the menu is limited. Though it looks long upon first sight, most Re just renditions of the same chicken or fish dish and then a different sauce, cooking style, etc. 

We ordered the basic white meat chicken, salt and pepper fish, and baby Bok Choy stir fried. The chicken was very basic considering it was their regional specialty. The salt and pepper fish came deep fried (unexpected) but was remarkably good, especially dipped in one of he provided spicy sauces. The Bok Choy was relatively basic taste wise but cooked to perfection. 

All in all the food came out quickly, the prices were great, and the experience went well. A downside is no alcohol, but for a quick meal at a good price I think you can handle it.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,4,Q5BYh62RJ-nIa9Am1yH_Bw

We were seated and our menu was brought to us. It had no pictures but pictures of the food were on the wall. My parents don't speak or read Chinese or English so it was difficult for them to convey what they wanted to eat. After about 15 minutes, after going through and explaining what was available, we ordered about 4-5 dishes to try. 

The waitor came to give us our drinks then the next half hour in 5 minute intervals, they brought out the food. Everything was just ok. Some items weren't seasoned well or didn't have the flavors we were expecting. The shrimp wonton soup was the most delicious item we had that night. It was flavorful and hot, cooked to perfection. 

Overall, it's a nice place to try but my parents thought it was the worst meal we had in Vegas because everything was so bland.

I didn't think that a restaurant named Big Wong would serve good food.  Boy was I wrong.  My friends went here and told me that the food was legit and the prices were amazing.  After finally giving it a taste, I came back 3 days in a row.  

Getting full off of a $5 meal?!?  ADDICTED!

Here are the dishes I tried:

1.  Thin rib eye over rice $4.95 - Thinly sliced rib eye is served with yummy dipping sauce.  The rice comes on a separate plate and comes with some steamed potato slices.  A great deal for rib eye!

2.  Steamed chicken, mushrooms, chinese sausage, and vegetables $5.95 - There are a lot of components to this dish that kept me from getting bored.  The chicken is served in a bowl of broth separately from the sausage, rice, and veggies.  Pour it over your rice to get some soupy chicken rice.  Gotta love the lop chong (spelling?) - 5th generation Chinese, I apologize.

3.  Hoi nam chicken (dark meat, boneless) $4.95 - Excellent!  Soft steamed chicken without any bones.  Comes with the yummy flavored rice and 2 dipping sauces.  A soy based sauce and a red spicy one.  

4.  Salt and pepper chicken wings $4.95 - I love the saltiness of this one.  Tiny jalepenos are sprinkled on top as well.  Great appetizer to share with the group.

5.  Salt and pepper pork $4.95 - Thin slices of pork deep fried and then sliced.  Very similar to the salt and pepper wings but a little less salty.  I prefer the chicken wings.

6.  Beef ramen $5.95 - Ok.  Cantonese style beef ramen with all the tendon and chunks that you can ask for.  Not my thang personally.

7.  Mango pudding $1.25 - So good!  A great way to end your super cheap meal, with a super cheap dessert!  Chunks of mango are actually in the cup too :D

8.  Sweet roti $1.25? - A thin roti or bread thingy with condensed milk, powdered sugar, and other sweet goodness on top.  Gotta try it at least once.

Other random tid-bits:
They always give you extra scallions in a metal tin.
Easy parking.
Cheap everything.  Tax is included in the price on the menu!
Mom and pop store.  The wife is the server and her husband is the chef.  He wears a giant chef hat too!

First, I'm NOT a fried won ton fan, because I can make them better than most Chinese restaurants. (True) BUT THIS PLACE makes won tons like they are SUPPOSED to be made! These are NOT the usual fried thick, greasy won ton wrappers full of over-seasoned fillers of minced indistinguishable shrimp mixed with egg white and minced bamboo shoots. Instead, THIN, delicate crisp wrappers, and the flavor of FRESH REAL plump chunks of shrimp are allowed to shine through in each bite. When you use fresh, quality shrimp, the flavor of the fresh shrimp is what shines through!

I had the steamed chicken accompanied by gai lan (Chinese broccoli), lap cheong (slices of Chinese sausage) and steamed rice. The vegetables were perfectly crisp tender, the sausage was of good quality (meaning not fatty & salty), and fluffy steamed rice. The dish was a great balance of flavors with the delicately flavorful broth from the steamed chicken.

The prices are cheap, and portions generous, but that does NOT mean this place skimps on quality! If you want Chinese food made with FRESH ingredients and not full of bloating MSG, come here! Even the tea is great: a slightly sweet jasmine tea!

We also split the shrimp dumpling soup with noodles. In hindsight, I could have skipped the noodles, especially since we had carbs from the rice. Broth was very clean and delicious tasting. Chinese broccoli was a very nice touch. Dumplings were tasty.

The Shrimp Wonton were OK, but nothing else special about the noodle soup.

Hainan Chicken lacked flavor and was dry.  The rice didn't have that great hainan chicken flavor to it and the sauces they gave were just a spicy sauce and what seemed to be the soy sauce chicken marinade.

The Gai Lan was good with lots of garlic.

I think this is a no nonsense place that serves very greasy but tasty food.  Big Wong fell short of my expectations but I don't think it's bad at all, just not as great as everyone else thinks it is.  The chicken wings and shrimp wontons came out hot & fresh but not super crunchy, almost like the grease wasn't hot enough.  I felt that my shrimp wonton it could have just a little more veggies, maybe a few spriklings of green onions even would have been good.  the wontons itself was really good, fresh shrimp with a hint of sesame oil but so boring. My husband's beef ramen was not good.  There's strong beef flavor but tastes to me more from boullion than slow cooked beef broth.  And once again, plain, beef & noodles and no garnishes... It's not bad but not the best either.  And sadly they did not have the congee that I really wanted to try.  The service was just that 1 man and it was pleasant, no complaint there.

Salt and pepper fish was okay, but kind of bland. You can't taste any salt or pepper seasoning. The portion was big, though.

Hainan chicken rice was disappointing. Chicken was super tough and dry. Also, no ginger sauce. 

Roti with curry sauce was actually not bad. Roti was soft and crispy, curry beef was tender and the sauce was good and thick. 

Chinese broccoli with garlic was so overcooked and burnt. Also, extremely salted.

Fried pork chop with rice was okay. Pork was seasoned well and the sauce with it was good.",LlKFjGIyGiBHCjud8fkA5A,2,1,2,StJnrHBcC821dHuliNOteA

I expected at least a little spice (had a chili pepper next to it), but the red colored soup was nothing but an illusion of blandness... A lot of toppings though I must say. But that did not make up for the runs I had after consuming 3/4 of the bowl...

The won ton egg noodle soup was the most bland I've ever had - and I had pretty high expectations since this is rated 4 stars on Yelp - disappointing. Everything was subpar except for the shrimp won tons.

If you're looking for dirt cheap food and don't care about the quality, then this is your place. There are definitely other places nearby that serve much better quality and authentic food.

To begin on a positive note, my boyfriend and I ordered Fried Shrimp Wontons as an appetizer. Crunchy and deep fried, it's almost impossible to screw this up. These tasted great with the sweet chili sauce. 

We also requested the stir fry bok choy. This ties with the fried wontons as being my favorite item. I loved the strong garlic flavor and aroma. 

 Thin Rib Eye Over Rice was another dish we shared. This was pallid with dark grill marks (how does this happen?!) For a rib eye supposedly cooked at medium rare, it was surprisingly dry.

I ordered the Shrimp Wonton Soup with Noodles as my main meal. I liked the wontons, noodles, and Chinese broccoli. As for the broth, not so much; it was bland.

Lastly, service was peculiar. When I asked our server if the food was large enough to share between two people, he told me to look at what the other patrons were eating (nope, not going to be a weirdo). Once all of our food was delivered, he never returned. 

On the upside, I'd say the the majority of the food on the menu is affordable, and the restaurant stays open until the early morning hours.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,10,6,2,DMTNJSW013XWXJrxMdwkjA

When I saw the prices on the menu, I had to blink a few times to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me. I ordered the Special Shrimp Wonton with Udon Soup and my husband got the Curry Chicken.  The waitress recommended the Salt and Pepper Chicken for an appetizer so we agreed. The food came out super fast. My husband enjoyed the Curry Chicken and had some leftover to take home. My soup was good. I enjoyed the seafood-y broth. I found some shrimp poop in a few of my shrimp so that was a little turn off. I just scraped it out and continued eating. The Salt and Pepper Chicken was also good but not the best I've had.

I gave this place 3 stars because the food was solid and good portioned. The waitress was a little short. When I asked if they had dungeness crab, she simply said no and walked away while I still had another question. I'm used to that type of service in Chinatown so that didn't bother me much.

My favorite has to be the curry chicken with roti (pancakes).  The chicken in the curry is oh-so tender. Take a piece of that chicken, put it on a piece of the warm fluffy crispy roti, dip that into the curry...yum yum yum.  The curry has so much flavor.

The Hoi Nam chicken with rice, on the other hand, was a tad bit dry.  The rice was delicious though.  Maybe because we got the white meat??? Either way, I will give dark meat a try next time.

Pork Chop over rice...the main star for us, however, is the egg.  How did  the chef got the yolk of the hard boiled egg to be soft and fluffy beats me...it was definitely interesting in the good way.  The pork chop tasted good with that gravy that accompanied it.

Beef ramen was actually tasty.  I am not a big fan of beef, but I thought it was season nicely, with tender tendon and beef brisket.  There was a lot of noodles in there too.  We got really full.

- Chicken curry with Roti pancakes...my FAVORITE.  The curry was so flavorful and the Roti pancakes are my new obsession.
- Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings...my second favorite.  Really salty, but in a good way.
- Salt and Pepper Pork Ribs...not so great.  Really salty, but in a bad way.
- Steamed chicken with mushrooms and sausage.  Oh my goodness, the mushrooms in this were to die for.  The broth had really good flavor, and the chicken was so tender.

I also have to give some big props to our waitress.  She knew the menu extensively and even suggested we change some items in our order to avoid getting too much rice (hence the Roti pancakes).

3738636,2016-02-17,14,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"So I was looking at Chinese food in Las Vegas, and this was the first one that popped up. Okay yeah sure leggo try it.

It was a big and very wong mistake to do so.

Came in before leaving to go back to the LA area and had a lunch here. I looked at the empty place and I was like ummmmm. okay. I see 4 stars and this is close to Kung Fu Tea so we'll stay and try it.

I ordered #8- roti with a curry that included chicken and potatoes. I forget the name of the dish but that's what I remember eating.

The positives here are that the roti (similar to a green onion pancake) was decent. It had the bread taste. The potatoes- the curry supplied all the flavor. When you bit inside and ate inside, you got absolutely zippo taste. Nothing, Nada. Zilch. It was bland. The chicken was a bit better, because it was soft, and it was in strips so the curry could actually soak into the chicken, but wasn't too impressed. Curry was watered down. A lot.

Had one shrimp wonton because there were many reviews about it. You can taste the shrimp but it was just missing some flavor to the point of being decent.

The reason why Big Wong is popular is because of them having really cheap prices. Which they do. Shrimp wonton is $4.95, and most of the prices do go along that route. The food comes out in a timely manner and service comes quickly.

BIG portion! I barely finished it and had food coma later.

My friend and I came here Monday during our lunch break from CSN. Perfect prices for starving college students. To our surprise the interior of the place was really nice and clean. My friend was expecting something iffy inside since the windows were all black on the outside. Right when we walk in, a man sitting at a table points to tables that are apparently hit with the air conditioned well. Then our waitress asks for our drinks, when she came back she immediately asked if we were ready to order. Since we were both first timers we asked for more time to look over the menu. She left as soon as we answered and then she literally walked to the cash register and came right back to ask us if we were ready to order for the second time. This was kind of irritating especially since the gap she gave us was practically 30 seconds. None the less we ordered. I ordered the rib eye over pasta, while my friend ordered the curry beef. The orders came pretty fast, which was good since we were both hungry. However the food wasn't as pleasing as we had hoped. 

steak over pasta- no special char on the steak, which makes me think it was cooked on a regular skillet (similar to how my parents would cook it in the kitchen) and then the pasta was angel hairwith some sauce on the side. We both expected some type of asian noodles rather than angel hair, oh well . The sauce did give the dish a little flavor but overall it was still kinda bland. This dish was okay, I don't think I would order it again. 

curry beef- the color of the beef was brown while were expecting a mustard color.  None the less there was still faint taste of curry. It wasn't as strong as we like. Yet again another dish I don't think I would order again. 

Although the prices are extremely cheap, I don't know if I recommend anyone else to come here. But I always do like to give places with great reviews a second chance and I probably will since it's so cheap. I mean what do I have to lose, right?",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,0,0,2,z59pRsveybIbE67Y2GnrBA

The fried chicken aside, most of their dishes don't classify as ""greasy Chinese food."" Here are some of my favorites:

- Hoi nam (Hainan) chicken over rice: This is one of my favorites. The seasoned rice is the bee's knees. It comes in three variations: white meat, dark meat, and bone-in dark meat.

- Special deep fried chicken over rice: This rice isn't seasoned, but it does come with a pretty tasty sauce. The fried chicken is more flavorful than the steeped Hainan chicken, but also more greasy. I like the dark meat version of this dish.

- Curry chicken served with (3) roti pancakes: The roti pancakes are amazing. A great curry dish if you're craving something more Malaysian. 

- Beef ramen: This is possibly the most underrated dish on the entire menu. The eggs are perfectly soft-boiled and I love the beef. Each piece is super tender and probably braised for a long time. 

- Salt and pepper chicken wings: Perfectly fried and a great appetizer or side to share with the table.

I was greeted promptly on arrival and asked if I was getting take out or eating in.  The woman told me to sit anywhere I wanted because I was eating in and she gave me their small menu.  I had seen several people rave about the curry chicken with roti so that's what I ordered.  In a short time, the cook brought out a bowl of curry chicken and a plate with three very hot, fresh roti.  

The curry chicken was good but it would be better named curry potato with chicken and roti.  I had two large chunks of potato, one large cube of chicken (smaller that either of the two potato pieces), while the rest was curry sauce with some chicken shreds.  The curry was tasty and the roti were very good.

As I waited for my dinner to be brought, I noticed on their wall--which has a lot of homemade signs for new dishes--that the curry chicken was listed under appetizers.  No wonder the price is only $4.95.  No wonder the portion is much less than a curry chicken you'd get in a Thai restaurant, and for $4.95 I wasn't expecting that.

I was going to order something else, perhaps some ramen or just a pudding for dessert.  There were two customers including myself in this small place that has a maximum capacity of 68 people.  All the time I waited for my order and ate, the woman was on the phone--not taking orders--but chatting.  If she wasn't on the phone, she was putting business cards in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engrossed with that task rather than all two of her customers--the other who ordered directly from the cook and had no interaction with the woman.

After waiting approximately five minutes for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so I could get her attention, I got up to leave.  I approached the counter and she told whomever was on the phone to hold, she took, my money, gave me change, and went back to her telephone.

I don't think I'll return.  If it's like this when they're two people there, what would it be like when they're busy--say ten people.  It's just not worth it.  And as for dessert, I drove up Spring Mountain Road and stopped at McDonald's and had a McFlurry!  Better than her pudding I'd be willing to wager even sight unseen!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,2,3,jajD7L7IiY6WNCEFgx4YVw

As advertised, their beef ramen dish was prominently displayed on the walls . The restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived so it was surprising that there was no one at the counter to seat me. After a few minutes, the hostess appeared from the back and allowed me to choose my seat. 

I didn't bother to look at the menu and just asked for the beef ramen. The waitress mentioned their other new items, such as shrimp wontons. I was tempted but decided to wait till next time. My order was brought out after a few minutes. It is basically a version of my favorite dish: braised beef in soup with noodles only the soup in this case is clear[er] instead of dark. The soup was just okay, you could definitely tell it was a beef broth/stock and it wasn't too salty. I do wish there was more beef flavor in the broth. The noodles were okay as well, not too chewy or soggy. I had the waitress add some tendon in addition to the meat since I wanted to see if they stewed the meat long enough. Big Wong did pass with flying colors in this department. The meat and tendon were cooked until nice tender and soft. The dish also came with a small dish of chopped green onions and hot sauce if you wanted. I did notice the waitress giving other tables small containers of chopped green onions as opposed to the small dish I got. *boooh!*

This is just to help them improve.

Their service sucks.

Everything is about $5 dollars.

The lady who has helped us both times is always alone. I'm sure it sucks for her. This is a prime location in the surrounding China Town area so I know it gets busy. There's about twenty people in here now. 

Anyways the food I really good. I've had their special spicy seafood soup with wontons and their beef ramen. Both were pretty good. The shrimp and wontons in the soup were of good quality. The beef ramen has a pretty basic beef flavor. There isn't even any taste of like ginger or even onion. The beef itself is cooked really soft. I've tried their chicken wings and their shrimp won tons. Both were good. The wings are seasoned well and came out hot quick and fresh. The shrimp wontons are also good. Both are good sizes for $5 each.

Anyways they give you super small water cups.

So here is my gripe. They have a menu item called 5., 5a, and 5b. It's their special deep fried chicken. One is bone in dark meat, One is bone out dark meat, and they have a boneless white meat. The dish is really good. The dark meat takes 25 minutes but it's worth it. 

So my sister got the bone out dark and my cousin the bone out white meat.

The server comes out and brings pork chops. So we spoke amongst ourselves like who ordered this?

And she's like it's number three deep fried pork chops.

I ordered soup so I know it's not mine.

But we are all positive that they got chicken.

She just walks off and says well you ordered that and shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

No arguing with that right?

So she ends up walking back and says it's wrong it goes somewhere else.

Needless to say she messed up.

There was no apology for the mix up or for blaming us.

Also we never got our drinks refilled. Not once.

Anyways I'll probably just order take out from here. I can't imaging coming here when their service sucks. 

Also I witnessed her have an attitude with another client because they requested a specific table for their large party.

We tried the things that everybody mentioned: beef ramen and shrimp wontons, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Actually, the beef ramen isn't really 'ramen' per se, but it is a beef soup with noodles. Actually, that's all it is because there literally are no other ingredients. Same situation with the wontons - yeah they're fine, but I can get a fine fried wonton lots of places. And I can actually get a good one some places, too!
The main thing Big Wong's has going for it is the price - everything's pretty cheap. For 2 dishes and 3 drinks, our bill was like $10. Also, the service was very fast and friendly. I asked if they had milk for the kids, and even though they don't serve it, the waitress was nice enough to get a couple glasses for us for $1 each.

Yes. Yes. A million times yes. I don't know why I didn't start going to this place until recently because this place is literally a treasure. 

It's located in probably the best food plaza on Spring Mountain so it easily gets overshadowed by Monta, Curry Zen, and Raku but wow! If you were to ask me to grab a quick bite to eat, I would choose Big Wong every single time now. 

The menu items are based off of each other so if you're a lover of let's stay pork chop, you can literally have pork chop with rice or pork chop with noodle soup or even pork chop on its own! It's how they keep their prices so low but hey, I'm not complaining. 

My go to order at Big Wong: Rib-eye over pasta and a side order of Roti. Whatever is in the rib-eye sauce has got me hooked. You get a good portion of meat, pasta, and potatoes for only $5! The Roti is a pancake that basically can go with anything (and it's only a dollar!!!). 

The service is great as well! They seem to have only 5 people on staff per shift but they make it work. The older gentleman who seems to be the owner is able to cook, serve, and clean! He's quite the animated man whenever he interacted with us.

They only have 14 items on the menu so we had already decided what we were going to order before we sat down.  I got the Hoi Nam Chicken over seasoned rice, my friends got deep fried pork chop over rice, fried pork chop with udon noodle soup and curry chicken over rice.

My Hoi Nam chicken was moist, the dipping sauce was delish but the seasoned rice was the best!

We all tried each others dishes- the curry chicken had great flavor, it was more Japanese style (which I like) but was a tad greasy.

The fried pork chops were also good, but better when you dip in this sauce they give that has a beef stock taste to it.

We also ordered some vegetables in oyster sauce that was okay, nothing special since it was just steamed/boiled Chinese broccoli with sauce.

I thought my shrimp wonton noodles (4.5/5) were just as they should be. The wontons weren't very big, but they did contain an ample amount of shrimp. The broth was a very simple chicken broth with nothing special added (not even scallions!) and there was a decent amount of noodles. Solid comfort food if you ask me.

Other entrees ordered included:
Fried pork chop noodles (2/5) - incredibly salty.
House special steamed chicken over rice (1/5) - just terrible. Do not order.
Shrimp wonton and beef stew in clear broth with noodle (4.5/5) 

Additionally, the salt and pepper wings were very good (4.5/5). While flavor didn't penetrate the interior very well, the wings were perfectly crisp and amazingly juicy inside. Also for $4.95, this plate came with (9) jumbo wings - unheard of!

This game-changing dish was the ~$5 Hainan boneless dark meat chicken with seasoned rice (#2 on the menu). We actually split an extra order of seasoned rice, leaving us plenty to go around. The chicken and rice were both quite tasty and sufficiently seasoned, and I liked both the soy and the spicy sauces that accompanied the dish. I would certainly recommend this place as a cheap lunch (and an excuse to hit up Snowflake Shavery for dessert).

So I got the Special Shrimp Soup and added shrimp wontons for an over-the-top shrimpy meal. The food came out fast and my first impression was the broth was pretty shrimpy w/ a little bit of spice to it. It also contained udon noodles and chopped Chinese broccoli. 

Coming in, I was starving and at the end I didn't even finish all my noodles. So don't be fooled! The portion size is deceiving because of all the substance they throw into the bowl. 

On the minus side, they serve their drinks in styrofoam cups. And that's something I'll always frown upon. I guess it's cheap but couldn't you save more with washable plastic cups? C'mon guys. 

Service was abrupt but attentive. The restaurant was arranged to sit groups of up to 6-8 people.

The chicken didn't have any Hainan flavor to it at all, it was just bland steamed chicken with soy sauce on the side.

When I arrived, I ended up ordering chicken rice, chicken wings, and Chinese broccoli.  I ordered all of this with the plan of taking half of it home as leftovers.  The rice itself was very tasty, but the chicken was on the dry side.  You can pick between dark and white meat chicken - but can't do half and half.  The dipping sauces are tasty, especially the sesame oil sauce.  The chicken was not the best, but for $5, you can't lose.  The fried chicken wings were absolutely delicious - 8 for $5.  The Chinese broccoli was very good - sauteed in garlic and oyster sauce.  The food here wasn't the best ever, but it was really cheap!

The service was a little weird.  All of the food came out at different times and the employees are pretty cold and unwelcoming.  But, this is pretty typical of Asian restaurants, right??",kFYEp9HvN-yTStS7YD_bVQ,5,3,4,MEhQcmx_BeC3VSmyCzR5cg

We are now insisting that she has more birthdays each year so we can come back again. And again. And again. We're all fans.

Six people in our group and we all ordered something different. An order of fried shrimp wontons. Ribeye over roce with potatoes.  Curry chicken with noodle soup (that would be my order). Beef ramen. Stir fried vegetables with Chinese broccoli. Shrimp wonton soup. We didn't really share so I can't tell you about the five dishes I did not order. I can tell you that everybody seemed please with their meals and for the most part finished everything.

My curry chicken with noodle soup was absolutely perfect for me. I had been craving curry and this satisfied the craving without fail. There were big chunks of tender chicke and potato. A rich red curry sauce/broth. Different than other more pungent Chinese curries I've had. This was more of a cross between Indian and Thai curry. My two favorites. Beneath the curry chicken goodness was a dense bed of thin rice noodles. I topped it off with copious amounts of green onion and called it soup. And when I was done I slid deeply onto the post-curry zen zone so typical of when I eat a good curry. And life was good. At least until we all got back to the office.

Big Wong does not appear to have lunch specials. But with the prices and portions they are serving up, they don't need lunch specials. Six of us ate a filling and phenominal lunch for a grand total of $42 and change. It is hard to beat that.

The Chicken rice is alright, their porridge was good, big portion and tasted legit.

The high light must be their beef ramen.  The soup is not as bold but since they put different type of spices in it, thats why it is not as bold taste as others but it is definitely good.  The ramen was a bit letdown since i wish they can use thicker noodle but for the price, I am not complaining

Their shrimp wonton is good!!  All shrimp wonton in a bowl for $4.95. Crazy.  I wish we have similiar quality wonton in LA but the last good one shut down years ago.

4205662,2012-08-30,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"After an exhausting weekend of alcoholic sins and gluttonous,late-night dining, my friends and I were looking for a simple, wallet-friendly meal before heading home.  Thanks to our trusty Yelp app, we fond Big Wong's and was impressed by the # of positive reviews for a place that has seemingly RIDICULOUSLY low prices!  I'm from the San Gabriel area so I'm accustomed to cheap food, but Big Wong's pricing is almost TGTBT and makes you question what ingredients they use....

However, 3 days after my meal, I have survived w/o any gastrointestinal isues and in fact, feel pretty good (thanks to my cheap meal @ Big Wong's!)

As for the venue itself, it is located in the heart of the Las Vegas ""Chinatown"" (but feels more like Westminster) area and is within a smal strip mall with numerous other asian-based restaurants and businesses (foot massage anyone?)  Once you enter Big Wong, you'll see a traditionally simple restaurant, clean, bare, and most likely somewhat empty.  However don't be offput by the lack of lines like at Marquee or XS, this is a good thing :)

The menu options are actually quite expansive, and include many many recognizable (and comfortable when you're tired/hungover) items.  I had the ""thin ribeye with rice"" dish that was okay in taste; a bit lean on the meat, heavy on the white rice, but my standard were so freaking low that I was still happy.  The sauce it comes with is a bit bland....so I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you are really looking to eat light.  

My companions tried the Hainan chicken, which was average..but my standards are based on Savoy's kitchen which has the best Hainan Chicken known to my existanec.  My other friend had a pho-like noodle dish that he said tasted good and it was pretty sizeable.  Finally, we all shared a portion of crispy chicken wings which I actually enjoyed! Not too oily or greasy, nice and flavorful with unidentifiable spices/seasonings.  

Every single item we ordered was $4.95 which INCLUDES TAX!!! OMFG deal of the century in las vegas (even better than the $6.99 steak and eggs @ Bills).  Total cost after tip

I rate 3STARS for one reason only...the SHRIMP WONTONS, um DELISH yea!  It's nothing super fancy, very simple item.

""I'm sorry lady, my mistake, I thought all Chinese Food restaurant serve egg rolls, they do in California.""  Ok, I'm getting sidetracked here.....so no egg rolls but she suggested that I tried their Shrimp Wontons instead... 

-Shrimp - Wonton Wrappers - Deep Fried Goodness - served w/ a sweet and sour chili sauce.  all for $4.95 - 8pcs

Crispy, not soggy or saturated w/ oil.  Made to order, I always do take out, they are sealed in a foil heat bag to keep them warm and crunchy.  

This is so a MOM and POP joint, no fancy digs here.  I have never tried anything else on the menu because it does not appeal to me, I go there for one thing and one thing ONLY!!! SHRIMP WONTONS (simple deliciousness)

For starters, I ordered an regular iced tea to go with my meal. Disappointingly, it just turned out to be a canned Lipton Brisk tea. Not my usual forte; but then again, the meal was too cheap to make any complaints about. Service still remained to be prompt and friendly.

For the entrée, I went with the chicken curry. It tasted a lot like my home cooking. You'd think that'd be complementary, but I am a terrible cook. In terms of flavors, it was average. But, it ended up being a filling meal. Don't count on waiting for your food, since it was practically served to me as quickly as the drink came out.

We were seated pretty fast, the waitress was kind of rude but no biggie. The prices looked good. We ordered and got our food pretty fast. We all got an order of shrimp wontons, first bite was full of grease and the shrimp was rubbery. I tried the beef ramen, it was no better than the kind you buy at the store for less than a dollar. My friend got a shrimp ramen and everyone who tried it said it tasted like dog food. The chicken wings were OK, not great but OK compared to everything else we ordered. Nobody ate more than a couple bites of what they ordered. 

We joked that if we ever wanted to dine and dash this would be the place as we could not justify paying for the garbage we were presented with. Nonetheless, we made our way to the counter to pay and as we walked passed the other tables there were full plates of food left on almost every table.

The wifey, sister-in-law, and I came here during our last Vegas trip. We wanted to get away from the strip and eat some good and cheap food. This place really hit the spot. We ordered the Chicken Wings, House Seafood Noodle Soup, Curry w/ Roku, and Han-Nan Chicken. All I can say is damn. The Chicken Wings were freshly fried, hot and crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Well seasoned and packed with a lot of flavor. The house seafood soup was a very generous portion - loaded with fish, crab meat, tempura/oden/fish balls. Great chewy consistency on the noodles and served in a light seafood broth. The curry was tasty, loaded with spices, but I think the large chunks of potatoes took away from the meal. The Roku pancakes it was served with was a delicious dipping tool. Lastly, and probably my favorite, was the Han-Nan Chicken. Tender cuts of steamed chicken served with two dipping sauce and accompanied by the most tasty chicken broth rice I've ever had. The best part of this place is our total for 3 entrees and a side came out to be 18 dollars total. I will be back!

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,2,1,5,CB8qlAWNsbxx80uVkYfJ2Q

Walked in... it is an empty restaurant at peak dinner time. This is the first red flag but I pressed on and hoping for good faith, support small local business, and trusting the reviews. Again, all wrong. 

An Asian looking guy in a tall white chef hat walked out without a word and instructed us to sit. He brings the menus over without a word. 

The menu is listed in both English and Traditional Chinese. This is like a Hong Kong Cafe menu (cha Chan Ten). I spoke Chinese to him to tell him that we are ready to order when he put down the tea. He said, what did you say?  I responded quickly and say sorry and speak in English. He took the order and left without another word. 

Our orders arrived. The wonton noodle is soft and the broth is like instant noodle soup. The wontons  are ... don't know if it is fresh or not. 

Yelpers bragged about the beef over rice is so good and stuff. That's what we ordered. WTF!  What's wrong with these people!  The dish came in with white rice, skinless boiled potatoes on the side. In another smaller dish is one paper thin Beef looking thing and a small bowl of brown sauce next to it. 

After two bites of each dishes, we paid and left. 

The same guy returned the changes to us.  He tossed the money on the counter for no reason. We never exchange another word other than ordering food. I never complain about anything. We were discrete. What is up with the attitude!

4521175,2011-06-01,1,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Big Wong is BIG on value. Though we missed the ""Dollar Dining,"" we are very happy to have discovered this place. Luckily, my parents saved the flyer and after seeing the prices on their menu, we asked, ""why not?"" We went there this past Sunday evening and met the owners Wai (or was it Wayne?) and Connie and their ""regulars"" Judd and Lynn. Luck would have it, we are all avid cruisers. Woo Hoo...one can never have too few cruising buddies! 

Back to why we are here: the food. Big Wong's menu is limited to one page and some posted specials on the wall. After discussing the menu with Wai and Connie, their philosophy is to keep the menu simple and ensure their food is always consistent and at a reasonable price. Mission accomplished! 

I had the Hainan Chicken and my wife had the Curry Chicken. The flavoring of the Hainan style chicken was delicate and tender. You dip the chicken into the accompanying chili sauce or soy/sesame oil sauce. The included seasoned rice was fluffy and also delicately seasoned. The chicken curry was wonderful and included potatoes, however, I like a little more ""kick"" in my curry. Spiciness is such a subjective matter and I understand you cannot please everyone. Some people may just complain that it is too spicy. You can't subtract spiciness, but you can always add. Connie also brought a sample of their beef stew and let me tell you, the beef was so tender and delicious! Both of our portions are satisfying and don't let the price fool you. You definitely get your money's worth here! 

Looking forward to becoming regulars at Big Wong and try out their ramen and wontons.

Update 6/5/11-Since writing this review, we have been back two more times and today with my parents. I have had the Beef Ramen, Ribeye over Pasta, and my wife had the Shrimp Wontons twice. Big Wong's Beef Ramen is exquisite. They spend a lot of time preparing the bite-size chunks of beef and tendons by trimming out the fat and un-chewable membrane that you find in Chinese style beef stew. Every piece is satisfyingly tender. I asked Wai how is the broth prepared and he told me directly from the stew. Delicious and hearty. No MSG after taste here.

The wontons (immersed in a flavorful broth) are loaded with shrimp and no pork filler used here. The ribeye is also very tender and juicy (cooked medium) and comes with a pepper style gravy that you pour yourself and a sliced herbed potato.

6/17/11-Went to our first UYE here at Big Wongs. It was great to meet other Yelpers.

6/19/11-Wai has been telling me about his Dungeness Crab over rice noodles (horfun) special and I had to give it a try so we came back today. The fresh crab is steamed with ginger and served over the rice noodles with it's natural sweet crab juice. Simply delicious.",HxdCh7lvfe86M8eQ7qeb8A,1,1,5,npjzpuBPp3QFi6ErT1u6Hg

Now I don't give a crap where we sit buuuut don't yell at my family please, thank you. This is about the time my hubby started giving me the stink eye. Took all of about 15 seconds after walking in. The lady comes back with the menus and I pretty much had an idea of what I wanted but hubby had to peruse. We ordered tea with lemon, sprite, and a water for my kids. She brought our drinks and my daughter(shes 4) started taking the lid off the lady was like ""no no no, I spent all morning cleaning the floors, keep the lid on"" now if this lady had been playing around it would be one thing. BUT SHE WASN'T!! Don't parent my children! 

Now on to the food.
Salt and pepper chicken wings-awesome. The only really good thing we ordered. 

Deep fried pork chop-it was ok. The sauce that came with was down right gross. Thank goodness it was on the side. 

Shrimp won ton soup with udon-easy to explain, are ya ready? Shrimp wonton, udon, and a few greens floating in water. This soup had ZERO flavor. 

Ribeye-so my hubby ordered this and I don't know why. It was excessively fatty and pretty tough. They tryed to pass off raw as medium. I work at a steak house so um when the meat is purple it's definitely not medium. So he asked for it to be cooked longer. Came back burned. 

All in all I guess its cheap and you get what you pay for. The cashier/server lady needs some customer service lessons. Sorry Big Wong you get a worthy one star.",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,4,2,1,AMPiFX1M_a2L4PUOU0a5uw

The spicy sauce was killer - after I finished the chicken and the cucumber I poured the sauce on the rice and ate it last.  It was pretty good.  The only time I had similar food was at a food cart in Portland.

Tien had the curry chix with roti and Anthony had the thin ribeye with rice/potatoes.  Definitely worth the buck.  Tien graciously treated me with his stack of quarters.

We tried the choy sum with oyster sauce, fried fish filet, special seafood noodle soup, salt and pepper wings, salt and pepper shrimp, and of course the Hoi Nam chicken. There was nothing we didn't like! My favorites had to be the Hoi Nam chicken and the choy sum. The seafood noodle soup had real crab and tasted a lot like lobster, fried fish filet was soft yet crispy, and the salt and pepper dishes were done very well. I love how they leave most of the head of the shrimp on - it has so much flavor. The rice that accompanied the Hoi Nam chicken was very fragrant and you could taste the chicken broth and ginger. I honestly don't know why rice isn't cooked with chicken broth more often. With the Hoi Nam, definitely get the boneless dark meat option with the seasoned rice!

Already tried a few dishes: the beef ramen $5.95, the pork chop with udon $4.95, 2 different chicken and rice dishes $4.95 ea., steak and rice dish $4.95... the chef is more than willing to adjust a dish to your needs (for example, I order everything extra spicy. He doesn't just throw in hot sauce either, he actually cooks the broth spicy!). 

There is a great selection on the menu... rice, noodles, soups, curries, vegetables, etc. A daily special is listed on the wall. 

Their ramen and udon noodle soups are FANTASTIC; however, they are missing vegetables. It's just noodles and broth with meat in the bowl or on the side. They do provide a metal container of green onions to add to the soup, but I think the dishes would be 5 stars if they had more substance (onions, cabbage, bamboo, etc..)

Everything on their menu is $4.95 with one item coming in at $3.95. You'd think that you were looking at the lunch menu, but no my friends. This is their regular menu. If this place was open after midnight, it would be the new unquestioned late night king.

SERVICE:
We came at 4pm on a Monday so it was dead inside. There was only one other party of 2 and 3 empty tables left with dirty dishes on them. After receiving our order, which came out pretty quickly, we waited to ask for water. However, no one came out for a while, so we had to go up to the register and wave into the kitchen for service. Actually had to get up and wave them down a few times throughout our meal. Not cool.
ALSO can they please get some real utensils?? The plastic stuff bends when you pick up food. No bueno  -__- 

FOOD:
-Chicken and Rice: I got this because of the good yelp reviews. Compared to a lot of other places that serve this, Big Wong does it all wrong! It comes with no condiments, unless you specifically ask them for each one. Chicken was dry and didn't seem very flavorful and the rice wasn't hot.

-Wonton Soup: The portion size is good, not too huge, but enough to fill you up. The soup was bland though, we added soy sauce, pepper, ginger sauce, chili oil...basically whatever was on the table just to give it some flavor.

- Dark Meat Hoi Nam Chicken over Special Seasoned Rice- this is pretty much Hainan chicken, which is cold/room temp chicken served with a delicious chicken broth-flavored rice and dipping sauces of soy sauce and oil and mild chili garlic paste, great portion of chicken, would say they could add more rice though
- Fried salt and pepper chicken wings- comes with some fried pieces of jalapeno, maybe 10-12 wings per plate, pretty flavorful and not too much batter

My son had the special shrimp wonton soup and Mr. Picky-eater scarfed most of it down. We brought the leftovers home & he just finished off the last of it. My husband had the beef ramen and salt & pepper chicken wings. He proclaimed it all delicious. We split the fresh vegetables in oyster sauce and I have to say, they were perfectly steamed with just the right amount of oyster sauce, not swimming in it. Lastly, I topped it off with the almond pudding. Heavenly with a nice amount of lychees mixed in. 2 appetizers, 3 substantial main courses, 1 side dish enough for all three of us, and dessert came in right at $30.

The restaurant was small, but very clean and they keep the kitchen open to view, and it was very evident the owners take a lot of pride in keeping things clean and hygienic. The ladies restroom was a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and very clean. Usually, restrooms in most restaurants can be a bit scary. I say if the owners put this much attention on cleanliness and quality in their restrooms, an area often overlooked by other eating establishments, then they must put even more emphasis on cleanliness in the kitchen and the quality of the food. In this case, I'm right. All through the meal, I heard the chef (owner?) directing the cooks with cautions on not to overcook this, oversteam that, etc...

This is definitely a dish I'd recommend, especially with added green onion. The employees were pretty cool and chill and were respectful to their fellow employees and the customers. And also, the name Big Wong is very unique and memorable. Definitely a good place to grab some nicely priced, good food in Vegas! I definitely recommend it!",Dbgd3YNTgVQQwO-t5g2geA,0,0,5,Jq53g6WGoBUL0mExbqvQPQ

There was a new person that was working as the waiter/ host it was not busy but the lady that seemed to clearly be giving the direction did not have full control of the establishment. She seemed overwhelmed. It took until 7:15 to get our order in. We asked the gentleman if we could order and he stated that he couldn't put in orders only the other lady could. Also the other people that were seated after us got their orders in before we did and it is ridiculous. It is extremely bad customer service and I have never been to a place more unorganized than this. She was overwhelmed and orders were missing. There is no communication and sync between the front of house and back of house. I am very dissatisfied with this place and its service.

Although my food was not oily as compared to regular Chinese food, I did not like it. Their hoi nam chicken was dry and bland even with all the sauces. The deep fried pork chop was tender and had some good flavors, but it did not hit the mark for me.

We tried the chicken curry with roti cause I read soooo many reviews about it but unfortunately, nothing about it wowed me! :( 
We also tried the salt and pepper shrimp and I won't say it was horrible...but I was not impressed. Leaving the head and shell on was quite a deal breaker for me.

The pro is that this place is more than affordable but unfortunately the lady/probably owner isn't that friendly. Another thing I found really weird was that they would use real plates, but give you plastic utensils, which is a strange concept to me. This place is really only 3.5 stars worthy but thinking about the dessert roti makes it 4.

4851247,2015-01-19,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"I always try to find something good about a place, even after a bad experience. My ""love / hate"" relationship with Chinatown continues as I explore all of its places to dine and enjoy all things spicy and unbland. The love part is the incredible food and drink, which is often so very affordable, and hate is the sometimes incredibly horrible service from the wait staff. I often chalk the latter up to ""cultural differences"", which I often have to remind myself isn't personal, and push through, because more often than not, the food is simply worth it!. But last night was different...

Our usual spot was dark for some reason, and the backup location was jam packed, so a quick check on Yelp revealed Big Wong Restaurant. The reviews were solid, and the food appeared somewhat authentic and non-standard, as some menus tend to be. Big Wong shares a parking lot with a few culinary heavy hitters, and despite the lot being full and crowds waiting outside of a few other restaurants, we entered the restaurant and found several open tables and no wait.

Let me fast forward to the food. The prices at Big Wong are very low, and despite this, the food is good. We ordered deep fried shrimp wontons, pork chop and chicken, and enjoyed the food. The menu is not your standard Chinese food, so don't bother looking for sweet & sour pork or chow mein. 

From the moment we stepped foot inside the restaurant, the service was terrible. The woman who was behind the cash register was not only the hostess, she was also the waitress and food server. And she was completely overwhelmed, to point of being overtly rude to the customers, especially me and the family! Like I said, I try not to take it personally, but after being sat down with such haste, there wasn't even a drink order taken. We sat at the table for about 10 minutes while she scurried around and struggled to figure out how to triage the food service. Keep in mind, the restaurant was not full and half the tables were well underway with eating dinner. Just as we stood to walk out (there was minimal eye contact the whole time, as though if she didn't look at the problem, maybe it would just go away!) she came over and took the food and drink order. 

Once the order was placed, the food and drinks actually arrived fairly quickly. But there was no follow up during dinner, and I, along with all the other customers had to walk over and grab condiments and napkins from the counter. The best part was when a family of about six walked in. The waitress escorted the family to the table and then turned so quickly to get away from them, she actually crashed into the dad who was still directly behind her, causing quite a ruckus! Another couple entered the restaurant, were seated, and after being ignored for 10 minutes, finally got up and walked out.

Not sure if I'll try this place again with so much to choose from in China Town. If you decide to go, hopefully you'll have better service.",2cuoUfAC3rhRS3nj9cf0Cg,3,0,2,-Ib7Jx8UF5Fu43QvHxfOQg
4853444,2016-01-05,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,This place is great for authentic Chinese food at a very reasonable price. I have been here several times. I usually get the hoi nam chicken with seasoned rice (boneless dark meat). The seasoned rice is a nice steer away from plain white rice. The chicken is always tender. The two sauces that comes with the dish is what really gives its flavor. The chicken wings are also da-bomb. They're so crispy and are seasoned very well. I also like the sliced jalapeños that comes with the wings. The fried pork with rice is also pretty good. I would also recommend trying the pork congee if you're able to get your hands on some (they are usually out of it). The flavor is decent but you can't beat the price (about $4!) I wouldn't get the fish congee... It was a little too fishy taste for me. The beef ramen could be better. I would recommend either paying a little more to go to a ramen place or making your own ramen. Overall this place is a must try... You will be pleasantly surprised and won't break the bank.

This was literally the first time that I have ever eaten curry chicken without being fearful of biting into pieces of bone.  That was so awesome.  The curry was thick, and tasted hearty.  The chicken was moist and slow cooked.  The chicken wings were top notch.  They were crisp, and the seasoning was on point.  The diced jalapenos added a kick that tied all the flavors together.

First off, we decided to come here based on the idea that it was cheap, had great reviews, looked good and was far from the strip (I.e. We'd get a table fast and wouldn't break the bank for brunch).

Walked in at about 1p and there were about two or three tables with customers, so we asked if we could sit at a larger table bc we planned on ordering a lot. The person who seated us said they were busy and couldn't do that, but we ended up getting a regular four person table (since there were two person ones too). What? That was such a bizarre comment to me. 

Upon ordering, the waitress/employee rushed us through and was SUPER Chinese about it which means, she was pretty rude. We had a couple of questions and everything we asked was answers in haste and with attitude. But I mean, I guess we have to expect that a Chinese place would be that way. It's all good. 

We decided not to get too much and we were glad. 
Our items:
Fried porkchop 
Fried chicken wings
Bokchoy
Rice

The porkchop was quite juicy, almost as if it wasn't cooked enough (soft soft texture). It wasn't crispy at all, but in general, it had a good flavor. I decided against eating it because it was too pink and too soft for my liking. It came with rice and a marinated egg, though - good stuff. 

The chicken wings were the best thing on our menu. They were super crispy, but really oily and very salty. The jalapeños in it were a good touch. It was also the most expensive part of the meal, which is weird. 

Bokchoy: good, as expected. They ran out of ong choy (water spinach), so we opted for this veggie. Good, but not mind blowing. 

Rice: so old, not fresh, and we had to pay extra for it! Blah. I hate places that charge for rice because it really doesn't cost that much to make and to supply it! Darn you, 21st century capitalists!

Prices are darn cheap, though, so that was a huge plus. It ended up being $20 after tax and tip. 

Parking is plentiful - there's a shared lot for the businesses, but if that gets to be a cluster, park on the street, you'll be fine. 

I don't mind going back to this place, but I'm not sold on the food. Maybe if we get better things next time, I'll consider the change in rating.",xUA8uhSreDk8000tL5vMHA,12,8,3,d_1Ddv8Dz-c3-nidxFXrNQ

We were concerned with how packed this place would be during their opening week, but we easily got a table with no wait.  Lucky us...the news was just spreading!

What surprised us most was the pleasant and welcoming reception we received when we walked in.  Yes, it may have had to do with the non-Asian face smiling at us as we walked in, but it definitely gave us a different impression of how our meal was going to be.

Getting our drink beverage orders out of the way, it was easy to decide amongst their 15 item menu.

I went for their Hoi Nam Chicken ($4.95).  They have three variations of it and I went for the Boneless Dark Meat version.  It was surprisingly moist and decent portioned.  Yes, I've had better and I've also had a lot worse (especially in Vegas) but it was decent.  The seasoned rice that accompanied it could be a bit more seasoned but it worked.

The Husband had their Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.95).  This soup came with six generous all shrimp dumplings and some Chinese vegetables.  You have to give them credit for making it a very shrimpy dumpling with no filler.  

We didn't realize that their grand opening special was limited to one per person per visit, so we went ahead and ordered another beverage to score a couple more free entrees.

This time I went for the Curry Chicken with Roti Pancakes ($4.95).  I loved their version of the roti, not overly greasy and had a nice flaky texture and crunch.  The curry with chicken and potatoes had a good flavor too.

The Husband tried their Deep Fried Pork Chop ($4.95) and found it to be disappointing.  It wasn't quite what we expected and it was dried out.  Too bad about that one.  (Apparently you have to request crispy if you want it that way...but that's news to us!)

When it came time to pay, we then discovered that we were going to be charged for the second entrees.  Due to a waitress's mistake, they took it off the bill without any hassle, which is something we really appreciated.  They didn't even charge us for the second round of beverages, rather telling us to leave it for our server instead.  Now, you gotta love that! 

Overall, you can't complain for the price you're getting.  A decent size portion for less than five bucks, and that's including tax!  (I heard they are adding to their menu next week, so we'll see how that goes.)  A quick bite without the fuss - a simple and straight forward menu!

No.  But was hoping this was that rare place that served good food at super low prices.  Basically, a place where they realizes their prices are too low but are too afraid to alienate their new customers.

Verdict?  Kind of.

Had the pork chop over rice and beef ramen.
1) Pork chop over rice - I'm told you have to ask for it crispy to get it...crispy.  Not sure why they do that.  I did not know this when ordering so was disappointed at the lack of...crispiness.  It was also underseasoned.  Definitely added a lot of salt to this bad boy.  Otherwise it was pretty good.  The egg that came with it had a nice, soft yolk in the middle.  My mom just learned how to cook the eggs that way and we both agree it's awesome.  Ask for this dish crispy and you won't be disappointed.
2) Beef ramen - Again....underseasoned.  But have to say this is some of the best beef I've had here in Las Vegas.  Nice and soft with a lot of flavor.  Just wish they added more salt or soy sauce to the soup base.  The noodles themselves aren't great - basically the ramen you'd get in most instant ramen.  Nothing like the ramen at Monta.  But the overall dish is pretty awesome.  Definitely a step below Monta but at half the price.  I could eat that beef with any dish and be happy.

Overall....a good option and happy they opened.  I can't say that about most of the Asian restaurants in town.  Most of what we have is a dime a dozen.  Big Wong stands out for quality for the price.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,1,1,4,NQe_-ON5g_xatvCksoAX_g

I ordered a special shrimp soup wonton with udon or ramen, I asked the guy if they had egg noodle, they did, so I went with that. I might have misread the title on the menu, because I was expecting regular wonton noodle soup with shrimp, which is what my other two friends had gotten, but what I got was actually shrimp soup. The broth was a rich red color and tasted exactly like shrimp. I probably wouldn't order that again because it was just too much for me to enjoy the soup, my mistake...but other than that, the noodles were great, wish they gave more wontons, but also I feel like the wonton were a tad overcooked, and the shrimp seemed mushy, but it actually wasn't.

They had bok coy cooked 2 ways I believe, decided to go with garlic, and I thought that was their best thing there, also under $6, most Chinese places would probably charge like $9+ for that, unless you get it during like a special lunch item. But ya, the bok choy was flavored well, didn't taste or look old, it had that nice bright green color, good crips, I would definitely order that again.

I think everything on their menu is 10 dollars or less. They have preserved egg and salted pork congee for 4 bucks, lots of chicken and pork dishes for 5, and sliced ribeye and seafood dishes for 10. Their portions are huge!  I ordered the deep fried pork and it came in two plates!  Pork was crispy and delicious. The egg that was served was cook Japanese style where it's soft boiled so the yolk is still creamy on the inside.  My friend ordered the hai nam chicken. Again huge portions. I think she got at least 1/4 of a chicken. I love the sauces that come with this dish and the garlicky rice is sooo satisfying.

The special was 2 for 1 Beef Ramen so I partnered up with Paolo to grab the deal. The whole thing was a cross of different kinda of soups- between a pho soup and oxtail soup with ramen noodles. The meat and tendon (you can ask with or without) was plentiful and tender so it was stewed long enough. Ramen noodles was quite a lot (more than Monta next door) and had good bite. Soup base was clear and clean broth, but that meant to me I needed to dress it up a bit with green onion, soy sauce, hot sauce to suit my taste. I was hungry since I didn't have lunch and this was super filling. 

Some people came at different times so we just kinda sat and hung out for hours. By the time people were trickling out the BF was there off work so it was dinner time. 

We shared-

Deep Fried Pork Chop (asked crispy)- Pretty good meat and I like the gravy sauce they give you and the soy boiled egg. 

Thin Sliced Ribeye- it was tender meat with a bit of fat on it so it's not for the lean beef sliced people. C'mon- it's ribeye. This also came with the gravy sauce and I think it went even better with the ribeye than the chop. 

Chicken curry w/ roti- the curry had good flavor and had a good sized piece of chicken (bone in) and potato. The roti was light, flaky and very hot so it's made to order. This was both my BF and my favorite and I will definitely grab this again. 

I had lunch here (about $3 for my half of the 2 for 1), dinner here and the BF had dinner here ($16 for 3 plates and 2 drinks).  I spent about $25 total with tax and tip....that's crazy! Food ranges from $4.95- $8max so its cheap and filling. 

The service here was friendly and good. We were checked on, water cups were filled often. We weren't rushed out even though we were there for hours on end and I really want to give a shoutout for the hospitality from Wai, Connie and staff!

With prices so cheap you really can't go wrong here and if you hate the food at least you won't break your wallet. 

Small little restraunt but always enough seating. The owner doubles as cashier and waitress as well as the cooks. Even though it's not heavily staffed I've never had an issue with customer service or any problems here for that matter. 

Small menu probably to keep prices down and it makes sense.

Everything I've had here is yummy never had anything here that wasn't good and for the price it's well portioned. Nothing is huge here just remember that. 

Beef Ramen - I'm not a ramen fan so this I actually did enjoy. Not salty with chunks of beef brisket and tendon and noodles not overdone. I hate soggy noodles. Broth has a different flavor that I can't explain but is very comforting to the palette. Almost has a star anise flavor to it. 

Baby bok choy - not sure if it was stir fried or steamed but I love veggies especially chinese greens. Still has bite which I liked. 

Chicken Curry - not overly spiced has dark meat chicken and chunks of potato served with roti. 

Roti - you could order this alone and be happy it's so buttery and flaky perfect for dipping in the curry. I could eat this all day everyday it's so bomb ! 

Fried chicken - this is an 18 minute wait and they will tell you before you order. It's crispy chicken they serve with a gravy. Kind of reminded me of jollibee fried chicken except jollibee has crispier KFC kind of crust on the chicken. This chicken is coated with a flour mixture. It's ok. Nothing too special about it. 

Fried Shrimp Wontons - crispy wontons stuffed with shrimp what's not to love. I don't even like shrimp and I liked them. Mostly I liked the crispy fried wrapper.

Pork chop standard pork chop fried served with rice also served with gravy. Nothing too stand outish about this either.

Cheap Chinese Food doesn't have a positive ring to it. But this place is all about good food, good prices, good quality.

Right next door to Monta, they're not there to have a ramen battle. Their ramen is NOT Japanese style; its a cross between pho & oxtail soup with ramen noodles thrown in.

The only thing price wise that I believe didn't make sense was the fact that my fried fish dish didn't come with rice so they charged me an extra dollar for a side of rice. Most Asian restaurants have the protein come alongside with the rice. But it was still fine. I just found it odd.
My husband ordered the beef tendon noodle soup. He said it lacked flavor but he asked for soy sauce and sriracha which was an easy fix.
We ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer. It was crispy and good.
It was packed in this little restaurant but the food came out in a timely manner. My food came out a little bit later than my husband's, but I was fine because I wasn't at the point of being hangry, HAHA.
Anyway. The reason why I would give this place 3 stars instead of 4 is because it was hard to enjoy the meal due to the people yelling in the kitchen. There was a man yelling at all of the kitchen staff very aggressively. He kept yelling for the cooks to hurry up and same with the food runners. I suppose there was a moment when the cooks asked for the next order and the main man who was yelling yelled at the server, ""SPIT IT OUT! THEY'RE READY!"" Really? Just looking and hearing from the outside, it is like their establishment is noy organized at all. I work in a restaurant too so I know how it feels to be under pressure and I know myself that I could not handle a work enviornment like that.
As my husband and I continued eating, I even heard the lady who took my order yelling. She told the staff that how busy it was today compared to Christmas is nothing. She yelled, ""If you guys can handle Christmas, you can handle this too!""
It just didn't give a professional outlook. When I went to the front to pay, I asked him to break my 20 dollar bill so I can tip and he didn't have cash in the drawer so he pulled out his wallet to give me change. I was stunned. I had never seen when employees have to use their own money for exchanging for change for the customers.
All in all, if you want something cheap that is not fast food, then I would say this place is for you.

whats wrong with the dish?
1. not free range chicken
2. no flavor
3. over cooked chicken, chicken was though, like they boiled the heck out of the chicken or rushed in the cooking process.
4. rice was dry a, bits of uncooked rice

big portion and cheap price does not make up the this ill cooked meal.",RJEYnbtZ2ySvtxei0HfimQ,3,0,1,CFiqBmPjYnrX-FstyeQ5cA
5158609,2013-06-16,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Found this place based on a recommendation by a Taiwanese friend of mine.  Later I had taken the whole family during the beginning of a road trip and they loved the food.  It was quite nice because my dad who has worked in a Chinese restaurant for over thirty five years himself is a very difficult person to please when it comes to eating out and he had nothing but praises, especially for their gravy, saying they did everything right.

Pro: Great affordable prices, perfectly deep fried foods, home cooked style, personable service.

Con: Smaller operation, therefore service can be slow at times; or it can even be more of a hustle and bustle type of place.

Unique: Mango pudding and the almond with lychee, both desserts made with real fruit and not artificial like most Asian places.  They have the best Thai Coffee in town, works better than any other coffee out there in all of Clark County.

It is steamed chicken, very juicy and tender, over a bed of garlic rice. It comes with a ginger sauce and is absolutely excellent with the chicken broth, only $1! The salt and pepper porkchops were also very yummy. Not as crispy as I would like, however very flavorful and no bones. We also ordered the garlic Gai Lan which was cooked to perfection..

I was going to give this place 3 stars, but after reading my review of the food, quickly demoted it to 2 stars.  Really 2.5 stars because the food is so cheap.

My coworkers always talked about this ""good Chinese food"" place near my work, so I figured why not try it out on Thanksgiving since it's one of the only places I could find that was open.

To my amazement, most everything on the menu was $4.95. Score for awesome prices, but of course you get what you pay for. 

Ordered the steak with rice, salt + pepper chicken and the shrimp wonton soup. The steak was soft, like it was boiled ,and it didn't have that lightly charred crust. Salt + pepper chicken was ok - nothing to rave about.  The wonton soup was pretty bland and so were the egg noodles I ordered with it. 

This food is AVERAGE/sub-par at best.  Not sure why people think this is a hidden gem? My mom certainly cooks better food than this. I can cook better food than this. 

Would I go out of my way to eat here? NO.
I would only come here if coworkers wanted a cheap place to eat during lunch hour...and even then I'd reconsider and suggest going to Monta Ramen next door. HA.",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,0,0,2,j4QrREjz0WvwgF-1-MNSrw
5193581,2017-09-04,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Decided to give this place a try based on a good friend's love of it, and wanting to try a new place. The shrimp wonton noodle soup, as previously reviewed, was VERY good. I actually added a bit of soy sauce to it as I thought it a bit bland, and I rarely have that problem, but still give it 5 stars. 

The 3-star review is for the fact that they gave us BURNT chicken wings. Burnt. As in my husband picked up one of the pieces and said ""What is that?"" And he's one of those people that don't mind if something's slightly burned. He calls them the ""toastier version."" He said the flavor was good enough where he didn't mind the fact that they. Were. BURNT! We got the chicken wings based on the photos we saw on Yelp and nope, ours didn't look like those at all.

We got our order to-go, and while I hate to think it, I feel like they purposely gave us the burnt order as they knew it wouldn't ""fly"" if they were to serve it to someone dining at the restaurant. It's like they knew or hoped that we wouldn't bother to drive back to ask for another order.

In spite of the wing incident, we'll go back, because the wonton soup is damn good. We'll most likely order it to-go again, but I'm gonna make darn sure I check the food before leaving the premises!",FLZVbNL6gLji3ghze303Fg,1,0,3,bgXgELekxt-HiERYWeIuiQ

5199577,2012-11-28,9,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Cheap and friendly are the two big selling points for Big Wong! We were planning on Ramen Sora, but there was a wait at lunch time. I was too hungry to wait, so we decided to give the Beef Ramen at Big Wong a twirl. 

We were greeted super warmly and given two big cups of steaming, delicious tea. We didn't want to go all in on the ramen, so we ordered one ramen ($5.99) and one garlic stir-fried choy sum ($4 and change). 

Just to be clear: this is not beef ramen. It is really more of a beef noodle soup prepared with thin ramen-like noodles. As beef noodle soups go, it is decent for a quick, cheap fix. The flavor is pretty rich, and the beef is definitely tender and tasty. Overall, the soup is very simple: broth, beef and noodles. 

The vegetables were delicious, just like I like with heaps of garlic and not too much oil. Granted, there are only 2-3 green vegetables to select from, but any green is delicious when prepared with this much garlic. When the chef brought it out, he told us next time we should order the vegetable ""Thai style"" because he is Thai. I didn't get the specifics, but given his warm smile and clear passion for preparing the dish, I definitely want to go back and try.

I would consider returning just for a lunch of well-prepared vegetables! I took my glass of tea with me, and as we were leaving, they were eager to top off my glass with hot tea.

But look, if you want something hearty, yummy, and cheap, it's like... as good as it gets (assuming you want Chinese food lol).  We arrived to Vegas during our recent trip pretty late (a story in itself) and missed our reservation in another restaurant.  After a quick browsing in Yelp, we decided to give Big Wong a try.  Because it was pretty late for dinner, the restaurant was pretty quiet.  There were maybe 2-3 tables.  We ordered several dishes to try, including salt and pepper shrimp, hah-nan chicken, curry dish, wonton soup, and probably something else that I forgot.  Everything was really delicious.  

Mind you, it's not a fine dining kinda establishment.  So there is no 'excellent service', 'artistic plating', white table cloth to speak of.  But you get a great, down to earth, delicious meal for a fraction of what you would otherwise need to pay for, it's pretty kick butt.

I also like ordering the noodle soups, which come in various combinations. My favorite is the House Special Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup ($5.50!!!). As a salty- flavored lover, the broth can be a little bland to me, but still good. The wonton is very tasty.

I don't recommend their porridge though, it tasted more like rice, which means they probably did not make the meat broth properly.

Originally opened in the middle of 2011 and largely unchanged in terms of decoration or menu over the intervening 6.5 years as judged by photographs, the interior clean and brightly lit with images of the Restaurant's cuisine hanging on walls, guests entering Big Wong can expect to be greeted quickly by a man standing at the counter, his directions as to where to sit gauged by party size with a server quickly emerging to provide laminated menus.

Small in size and more limited in scope that other nearby Restaurants, the double-sided menu featuring some sixty choices largely revolving around items such as Chicken, Beef, Pork or Shrimp in a variety of preparations including a Starch and Curry or Soup, it was after being told that no Congee was available at 7:00pm that the decision was instead made to focus elsewhere, a total of three plates plus Rice, extra Noodles and Water tallying just $30.

Unsurprisingly not packed given the holiday, but still doing brisk take-out business to an almost universally Asian clientele, it was just as Water was refilled by request that plates came forth from the kitchen one after another, the portion-sizes about what one would expect for the area with the bowl of Curry Beef and Ramen easily enough to feed two given the ample amount of springy Noodles and tender braised Meat floating in a pool of Orange Broth.

Having not really paid attention to tablemate's orders after being disappointed regarding the Rice Porridge, a second-choice of store-bought Fish Balls presented similar to the Beef but without Noodles for $1.50 less, it was atop a Soy-slicked scoop of Rice that the mild orbs made rich by Curry and Turmeric were enjoyed before turning attention to a smaller cup of boiled Chicken, the blend of Dark Meat and Breast well-cooked, juicy throughout and delicious whether on its own or atop crispy fried Roti.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,7,3,2_ADwqAg5IBgoy14P_ZW7A

CHINESE FOOD IN VEGAS SUCKS!
I lived in both NY and California for years.
Most restaurants in NY is good.
Some in California is good.
Vegas if GOD AWFUL.

All the head chefs in Vegas are the untalented sioux chefs from the real restaurants in NY or LA.  This is FACT not a rumor.
Anyone who says otherwise has never tasted what real standards are and also give ""in N out burger"" 5 stars.

Big Wong's is a hole in the wall but its cheaper and actually does taste better than 95% of all the other restaurants in Chinatown.
Its a super casual honk kong style wonton noodle joint.
Its real Chinese fast food, and the food is FAST.
So if you want service, HOLLAR.  What's rude in the US is normal in a cheap place.  Its supposed to be informal, noisy, WTF do you want, Don't waste my time, attitude.  You're not paying top dollar and they don't expect huge tips, so don't get annoyed, get loud, and get service.

The Hainan chicken rice dishes are good.
The cheap rib eye is decent.
Shrimp noodle is very flavourful.
Curry is a unique traditional style.  Its not thai or indian or malaysian.
I can't explain it, but their curry is different,  its not bad, its just different.
It's not coconut based.

They have Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian and Taiwanese dishes.  We got the chicken curry with roti, rib eye steak and beef ramen (the beef was so tender and broth had a good flavor).  They were good.  I really enjoyed the beef ramen.  We also got Thai iced tea which were in small 8oz styrofoam cups.  Everything about this place screams ASIAN!!!  The service, the cigarette smell coming from the kitchen and unpretentiousness.  The food was very cheap.  We only paid a bit over $20 for everything we got.  We were stuffed.

5320642,2013-02-16,1,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Big Wong is located on Spring Mountain Rd. in the same shopping center as top competitors such as Monta and Raku. At first, I was hesitant to dine there because I thought it was going to be the same as most other Chinese restaurants. It took me several times passing by until I finally gave it a try and now, I dine there almost every week! (no joke!)

This place is AMAZING!

Granted, upon walking in, the establishment is not as nicely decorated as most other restaurants. BUT DON'T LET THE LACK OF INTERIOR DESIGN FOOL YOU!  The food here is delicious and the cheapest in town (NO TAX ! ) 

I always order their fried shrimp wonton ($4.95 .. 10-12 pieces) The wontons are served with sweet chili sauce. What makes them so good is the whole shrimp that is stuffed inside. They are also super, super crispy and delicious as appetizers.

I also suggest getting their beef ramen, or wonton soup. ($5.95) .. The broth they make is very sweet and flavorful. It isn't bland like other places. The portions they give you is also very considerate.

I also love their sizzling garlic sauteed vegetables. (only $6.95) They serve it on an iron plate that they bring out to you smoking and sizzling. Every time someone orders it, the whole restaurant smells like garlic! It is so delicious and perfect to eat with rice! You can also order it with thai chili which adds an amazing spice. The blend of garlic and chili is absolutely perfect.

The last thing I would definitely recommend is their Authentic Hai Nam Chicken. The rice that is served is cooked in chicken broth so you get the full flavor of chicken in every bite. The chicken itself (cut in pieces, either dark or white meat) is steamed in ginger and garlic. I love this plate! The aroma of the marinated chicken is so flavorful in your mouth. You get two different types of dipping sauce with the dish. A semi sweet soy sauce and an amazing semi sweet chili dipping sauce. Both of these sauces are great with the chicken!.. The portions are also very filling!

As for desserts, I would recommend their sweet Rotti ($1) .. It is pretty much a crispy fried tortilla with condense milk and powdered sugar. I was super surprised how delicious these 3 combinations taste together!I It is very simple but very tasty!
---

The only con I would give to BW is that they don't have a very extensive drink/ dessert menu. Just be prepared for can sodas and about only 3 selections of desserts. However, the entree selections are plentiful. 

Overall, if you haven't tried BW yet, you are missing out! My girlfriends and I always overindulge ourselves when eating there and every time, our bill is under $25 (we always go with 3 or more ppl!)",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,3,2,5,6xFpKRWt8306epXY8zRr0A

From the outside, Big Wong's looks kinda iffy coz it's in a semi-ghetto looking strip mall and the windows are all blacked out. Plus the signage outside makes you think twice but on the inside it's super clean, cute and newer! Yay! Looked more like a café setting than your typical Chinese food place. You can tell they're still messing with their menu coz they have hella neon signs on the wall advertising what's NOT on the plastic menu. They really should just quit playing and invest on new menus. We got:

-Steamed fished 2 large fillets: $9.95 - Very good and super fresh/fluffy like a steamed fish should be like
-Fried Salt Pepper Shrimp: $7.95 - Excellent dish, lots of good sized shrimp for the price and so nicely crispy without being oily. They even cleaned out the head and snipped the ""whisker"" of the shrimp so you could eat it all! 
-Won Ton Noodle Soup - $4.95 - Enough to feed two people with other dishes but was bit underwhelmed by this one. It was good but wasn't exciting. 
-Garlic stir fried Gai Lan- $4.95 - This had to be my favorite dish, it was unbelievably flavorful and came on a sizzling platter. 

Pros:
-CHEAP! Super freshly made food at cheap prices. Cheaper and better than a Panda Express that's for sure.
-Everything was tasty and fresh, good portioned, not too big, not too small but just right.
-Quick service (coz nobody was there)
-Inside is light, bright and clean

I don't go to Big Wong very often but sometimes I do when I want some cheap Chinese food. My most recent visit, my brother and I came here for lunch after he picked me up from work. 

My brother got their wanton noodle soup and I settled for their hainan chicken with rice. They have several options for it: you can get white meat, dark meat, and each of those also have a bone in option. I went with the boneless dark meat version because I'm lazy.

They gave such a hearty portion with the dish. It's a dish of rice and a dish of chicken. They give you some hot sauce, soy sauce, but they don't automatically give you the ginger sauce? I had to ask for it. Their rice was really yummy -- it had enough flavor. It was a bit on the softer side though. Chicken, on the other hand, is very normal. It's just boiled chicken but they cooked it too long I think because the texture was a bit tough.

Their wantons were really good though! Very classic -- full of shrimp goodness instead. 

Sometimes, I actually like to just stop by and buy some stir fried veggies to go. They sell tong choy for like $7 a dish versus $15 like some places. I have also had their congee but unfortunately, their congee needs more salt hahaha.

5361437,2011-07-24,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"**Summary**
       - Flavor - The slow cooked beef in the beef ramen is definitely a head turner. Some of their other items are a bit hit or miss.
       - Value - You can't go wrong with most of the dishes being under $5. This place is, without a doubt, a good value
       - Decor - The inside is simple and reminds me a lot of the hole in the wall restaurants in cali. However, those places are also really good.
**Ordered**
       - $5.95 #15 Beef Ramen - Slow cooked fork tender beef brisket in ramen. The broth really has the flavor of the beef in it. This is a must try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=_Ol_FjEJS3TDp11m7amNLQ).
       - $4.95 #21 Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings - The chicken was moist and delicious. I tend to like salty foods so this was perfectly seasoned for me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=MOolbZ9HluooQUfoGXmCeQ).
       - $4.95 #2 Authentic Hoi Nam Chicken Over Special Seasoned Rice - The chicken comes with a soy based sauce and a chili sauce rather than the usual ginger and green onion sauce. The chicken was a little dry, but the sauce and rice were tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=vLkVcA20AojLDusn38f2fA).
       - $4.95 #8 Authentic Curry Chicken Service with 3 Roti Pancakes - Chicken was a little dry and the potatoes were under cooked. The curry was OK, but the roti pancakes, if you don't mind a bit of oil, were spectacular. I'd order the pancakes alone if I could (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA?select=Mrul8D6-5mwJ-26rna6d5w).
**Recommendations**

That would be enough for me to turn around and show myself out, but I remembered how good the food was the last time. Instead of turning heel, I sat in the corner table upfront. 10 minutes pass, no one came in. I really had this place to myself. Out comes my beef ramen with tendon and I questioned why it was dead at 4:30 on a Thursday. 

The beef was plentiful, tender, juicy, large chunks. The tendon were melt in your mouth good. There were double takes to make sure I was not devouring colossal pieces of fat. The noodles had more of a chew than my tendons. Take that as a compliment, because there is nothing worst than over cooked noodles. These had the perfect bite. The broth is simple and flavorful. Sriracha and green onions are the condiments provided and that was enough flavor to get me to pick up the bowl and slurp down every last drop. I ended my meal with a mango pudding. The bits of mango floating within was a nice touch.

Now let me go all Rachel Ray on everybody; Beef Ramen $5.95, Mango Pudding $1.25, and tip=$10. That is a meal that is easy on the wallet.

The waitress is very soft spoken and meek. With that being said, she was extremely nice, very unlike other Chinese restaurants.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,8,7,5,Jqzum_QFhW61M-X4jW7PEg

Thoughts: A side from the cheap price in food, I don't know how this place would get a 4.5 star rating.

Do not order congee. As all 5 members in my group did and were very disappointed.  Then again it was mid-summer in Las Vegas with 114 degree who would want to have congee in such hot weather?  The congee were  terrible, as some of the rice was sticking like a lump of melted coal with very little for topping in the soup. It could be mid-day, so they might not have a fresh pot of congee, but avoid ordering if possible. 

I had ordered the traditional wonton noodle soup. The soup was like warm and very bland even for me, leaving displeasured for our 1st meal in Las Vegas. Each dish was approx $5 dollars, so it was super cheap but disappointing.

 Service was also very slow and poor. I would not go back, unless you lost all your $ in gambling and need a cheap meal.",Bf4b8kPWKFnzk5oSkGt8jQ,1,0,1,sBP1_jc00eGhaqDMOXXKRg

I see why it's cheap cause you get what you order from the price range. The beef ramen has a strange weird smell and taste. Its fresh but it just had that strange taste and smell. The fish balls wasn't real fish, it tasted very generic and fake, almost like a hot dog shape like balls, the texture is like the hotdog inside texture. The shrimp wontons are great as I said earlier, the deep fried pork on rice was good. I feel like I wasted money, I spent 24 dollars and I tip them 5 dollars and so altogether 27 dollars.

That got old reeeaaal fast. So I began frequenting somewhere familiar - I had been to Big Wong several times and it was the perfect fit...

The downlow: It's cheap, filling, and tasty.

I don't know what's better than 8 pieces of salt and pepper chicken wings (topped with jalapeños) for 4 dollars. That's 50 cents a wing!! Cheaper than BWW's 60 cent deal and also much larger and more delicious.

Besides the wings, I like to get shrimp wonton soup with egg noodles ($4) or the chicken with rice ($4). You can even choose the cuts of chicken you want, so I always go dark. When I'm eating with others, I like to get the sizzling ong choy ($5) which is a surprisingly HUGE hot plate. It's stir fried morning glory and tastes just like home. Portions are always generous. Seriously, I ordered the shrimp wonton soup thinking it would hold me over until my next meal but it got me stuffed! That little bowl is quite deceiving.

Other notable dishes are the chicken or beef curry, which you can dip roti (Asian crispy pancake) in and the sirloin beef with rice. Pretty much everything you order here will be good or reeeaaally good. It's no-frills food for those that are on a budget. The only thing I don't like that much is the salt and pepper pork because it isn't crispy. 

Fare warning, the service isn't that spectacular. It's always the same lady working as cashier and serving/bussing tables so be patient. Aside from that, her brusque manner of speaking can be off-putting for those that put service as a priority.

Overall, the decor and ambiance would normally get a deduction of a point from me, but the LOW prices get extra credit earning the star back.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,3,1,5,KrmKBHw2nrAwYrJf5UDGcg

Big wongs is one of my favorite weekly eats.

I always order the number one. I don't like spicy so I ask for the soy sauce only which is tasty. 
I try other things on the menu. Soups, noodles, pork chops, beef brisket. All are safe choices. 
Cheap comfort food.

5765934,2017-01-08,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Overall: Big Wong serves pretty damn good Hainan Chicken for an astonishingly low price (at least to this Californian). If only there were one in Orange County...

Food: 5

Hainan Chicken with Seasoned Rice: I don't think that they use Vietnamese free-range chickens (Ga Di Bo), but they do an excellent job of cooking it as if it were. The meat is moist and it retains the firmness of free-range chicken. The meat portion is HUGE. The rice is also perfectly cooked. The grains are separated but not dry, and it taste like chicken and ginger.

Salt and Pepper Wings: Although it's a little fatty for my taste, this is a good option for those who like wings. It's crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. It's a good appetizer, or it can be eaten as a meal if you order a bowl of rice.

Service: 3

I don't expect much from Asian servers, so the service was alright to me. The waitress was a little brusque, but she got our order right and brought us anything that we asked for. That's good enough for me.

Ambiance: 4

It's located in a small plaza with several restaurants and a boba shop. You can already see how parking might be a pain, but we didn't have a problem on a Saturday afternoon. Inside, the restaurant is surprisingly clean for a Chinese restaurant.",scWPwwaZeZsk0OzJ856z-w,4,0,5,6EBurckakAMVrtJS-kewLw

It was $16 for the whole crab, and was pretty good but I wouldn't get it again. It was a steamed crab served over flat rice noodles with a soy ginger dipping sauce on the side. The crab itself was kind of small and the head was emptied, which is a shame since the best part is mixing rice into whatever juice is in the crabs head. 

Chicken wings were as delicious as they look -  crunchy, slight heat from the jalapenos. I'm thinking it has a lot of msg, which is fine w me. It was prepared basically how salt and pepper pork chops are in Chinese restaurants. 

I was a little disappointed in the noodle soup. The brisket was great just like in the curry - fork tender and full of flavor. Noodles were good, but the broth was pretty bland. I just tried some of my friends, but its probably good if you add siracha hot sauce and soy sauce. 

They've added the specials written on the wall to their menu, which is a huge help. Another positive is that they have fun soft drinks! We had Welch's grape soda and Sunkist orange soda! Can't go wrong with that.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,1,1,4,F7AjQYU7W3XX4I6PWCsrMQ

Big Wong serves the type of food your grandparents and parents cook for you growing up in a Chinese household. The food is not super fancy, but it's the type of food that's comforting and nostalgic to have. 

Some of my favorite things that they offer here include:
- Chicken curry with Roti: if you haven't had roti yet, you're missing out. Roti is flaky and soft in the middle, but has a crisp surface. Dip your roti in curry (or even condensed milk if you wanna have some dessert) & it's seriously bomb. The chicken curry here has mild spice too, for those who can't handle spicy. 
- Hainan Chicken: for $7, this is SUCH a good deal. I personally prefer dark meat, so I always get the Hainan Chicken & Rice w/ only dark meat. The chicken is honestly not super flavorful, so it's great that they include dipping sauces for it. However, the rice is yummy, as it's got some of that broth flavor alongside with some ginger. 
- Fried chicken wings: delicious! It came out piping hot, fresh, & the meat was super juicy!! Sometimes I get annoyed at places that fry their wings and the meat becomes super tough to eat & dry, but they definitely fry it right here!

Customer Service: pretty quick and minimal interactions with the server (he'll take your order & refill waters as needed but he won't be trying to chat that much with you in my experience) 

There's plenty more that you can try and can't go wrong with here, but of the times I've been here (basically go at least 1-2x when I'm in Vegas), I just stick to these basics & have been very content.

We were staying at the Wynn and the hotel's buffet had a 3 hour wait just to get to the VIP line!  We had tickets for Love so we had to find a place to eat and fast.  My Mom Yelped this place and suggested we give it a try.  I'm super happy that we did. 

They had a short menu.  But I can understand that - just have a few things on the menu and get it right.  Everything we ordered tasted great.  I ordered the Hainanese chicken rice.  I've traveled to Singapore and had chicken rice at chatterbox among other hawker stores.  In the US, we just don't have the chickens like they do in Asia.  Big Wong did a good job at sending me back there.  The chicken skin had a nice crisp.  The rice was super flavorful just like S'pore, they used the same authentic hot sauce, and the plate even came with cucumber slices.  The kids got the roti and chicken curry.  The roti was great and the sauce robust.  The roti was so good we ordered an extra order of it.  But with these kinds of prices you can splurge like crazy and still come out spending comparable to a cheap fast food joint.  

When I got back, I was telling my co-workers about this place.

Kudos to him for the original name of the restaurant and not falling into the trap of Big Wang. I'm serious. Do a search. There are about 5 billion results. Now search for Big Wong. It's the first result. Now, it could be that I'm in Vegas and the local results are being pushed to me, but I prefer not to think in such pessismistic terms. Being the #1 Big Wong is a massive accomplishment.

Of course, I don't come for the conversation. I'm a frequent diner here with my classmates. Why? Where else can you get salt and pepper chicken wings for $4.95? This kinda thing doesn't even happen in the SGV. My friends from Taiwan and China approve of Big Wong. That's gotta be worth something. It's comfort food at its finest. They even accept credit cards. 

-The wings come out smoking from the deep fryer the second they're cooked. I've personally witnessed this. The chef in the back makes a hand signal, the wings are rushed onto the griddle, and the owner rushes it to your table. They're extra crispy with just the right amount of salt and copious amounts of thinly sliced peppers.

-The Ong Choy is always crunchy, fresh, and would not cause me concern if it were to come from my mom's hands. Multiple options are also offered -- get it garlic cooked, Thai style, or with soy paste. All is not perfect though -- the dish is sometimes served with too many stems, and not enough leaves. Still a great value at $5.95. 

-The seasoned rice tastes great. I would eat it by itself. Combine it with ribeye for $4.95. FOUR-NINETY-FIVE. See the theme yet? Extraordinary. Just extraordinary.

But we came here after our Airbnb friend and fellow Yelper, Chan, hosted a Meetup for LV Airbnb hosts and also set up a UYE for Big Wong.  And we were delighted to participate in this trifecta:  meeting new local hosts, meeting Yelper Antonia R., and getting to try a new Asian restaurant to add to our woefully inadequate go-to list.

True to form, Big Wong lacks atmosphere, but makes it up with an interesting menu and very cheap prices.  Sure, some of the dishes are small, but the low cost lets you try a greater variety of their offerings.

I ordered the Shrimp Soup with noodles.  My husband, who was suddenly gripped with some mysterious illness (not food related!!), needed some broth, so he ordered a plain cup of chicken broth and I shared the huge quantity of noodles in my soup.  But after seeing the wonton in someone else's shrimp soup, which looked fabulous, I was sorry I hadn't gone for that one.  Still, my soup was amazing, and a great size for the 4.95 price.  Next time it'll be the wonton version.  We also got a Curry Chicken with Roti pancakes, and I loved that combination; it was a big change from the usual rice. Unfortunately for me, the hubs wasn't so sick that he gobbled it all up before I could get more than one bite of chicken, but that one nibble was moist and tender.  I also got to sample the baby bok choy in garlic that Chan ordered, something that I had never knew existed, and it was astounding.

My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.

The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.

Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more ""seasoned"".

I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.

The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.

The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the ""greasy"" side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.

Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.

And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.

Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).

I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.

The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant.

Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.

Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self.

Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.

Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!

Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.

Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.  Great for customers and I hope it works out for the restaurant.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,5,4,1_SIcvCjth2VlVcx22yGvA

Everything is so fast paced and crowded during their dinner rush. You can hear the cooks yelling out the orders and my fiance and I had a great time just watching all the action. THIS is a reality show folks! 

The food is O-K. Nothing that wows, but for the price, I'm not complaining. On a cold Vegas winter night, the wonton soup will warm you up and fill you up for the rest of the evening. The wings were CRISPY but a bit salty. Pork chop was a bit soggy and salty for my tastes. I'll definitely come back for the wings though.

The utensils are plastic forks and spoons and the water comes in paper cups.  Since we were just visiting and couldn't take leftovers with us, we came here for a light dinner.  We ordered the salt n pepper chicken wings, wonton noodle soup, and steamed chicken with mushrooms.  The chicken wings were tasty.  The wonton meat was a bit soggy.  I liked how they chopped the veggies in very small pieces for the wonton noodle.  The service needs a little improvement since it seems like there is only one person handling the front and phone orders and the dining area. I felt bad each time I had to ask for something.  I saw someone just getting his own refill on the iced water.",cU1u8UtJLqpcMtwc48F9Tg,0,0,3,743L0EiWYUW0rvzWehrukA

The first thing that will catch your attention will be the price, with each dish averaging around $5(tax is already incorporated in the price) you are probably asking yourself...is this a Kid's meal? Will the food be good? What the heck, all I've got to lose is 5 bucks...so why am I hesitant to give it a try? & tried we did (Monta was packed & the wait was long & i was hungry!) The Star of our dinner was definitely the fried chicken, definitely worth the 18 minute wait! The beef ramen was ok, the fried pork chop was ok, would've been better if it was golden brown & not pale, I loved the plain udon soup, salt & pepper shrimp ok, Mango pudding ok...roti with chicken curry ok...in short, this place is AVERAGE, not super great but not bad at all as well. It is a retry decent meal considering the price. I would probably come back here, but as far as craving it, not really. This would be PERFECT though to have blind dates because what if ""You are just not that into her/him?"" at least you did not spend that much! (be sure to bring your own set of utensils though and your own glass!) they only have plastic spoons & forks etc.  and styropore cups????

5941779,2017-01-18,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"Big Wong is that 1 place my family & I always find ourselves going back to. Their food is  good, but affordable ($5 dishes) & fresh. They are consistent: the quality of their food has remained the same since we discovered them over a year ago.

Hubby & I always order the same thing: seasoned rice & fried shrimp wontons, which are both phenomenal. They know exactly how to make the FSW's (ancient Chinese secret?), & seem to have the recipe down to a science. While I don't know the recipe for it, I believe they roll out the fresh wonton wrapper to a precise thinness, & then fry it in fresh oil at a specific temperature, for X number of minutes. This method results in a crispy (yet not exceedingly greasy) wonton wrapper. If you've eaten a lot of mediocre & MSG-laden Chinese food, you'll notice the difference.

The place itself is small & simple, so unassuming that it's the perfect facade for a magical kitchen where the chopsticks & wonton wrappers (probably) come to life to sing & dance at night. Srsly though, we saw Nicolas Cage by Big Wong once, & that's made Big Wong even more memorable for us. We've eaten at Big Wong so many times that we've kind of become friends with the main server, a Thai guy named Paul.

What does baffle us about BW is how it never seems to be as packed as we figure it ought to be. In a way, we like that, but we honestly believe that anyone that hasn't tried their food is missing out.",qUk-Qa1JYnuK4VmmEbSYsA,3,2,5,VD67iSqZUxDdTKpVvEEg_g

We ordered the curry chicken with roti, beef ramen and sweet roti for dessert. They have a much more extensive menu than before and they also have daily specials that look delightful. All the food is still incredibly cheap for the portions and quality, which you just can't argue with. I enjoyed this visit quite a bit more than our first visit and I'm already craving some more of their cheap eats. 

There aren't many places that you can have a sit down meal, including dessert and a drink for under $14 and still leave satisfied. Sometimes good prices makes food just taste that much better.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,6,5,rP6zo6aTp0s5OTdf4KPdGg

5973629,2012-02-06,0,1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA,"I am so glad that I gave Big Wong a second chance because the first time I came during opening week I was NOT a fan.  In fact, I was shocked that this restaurant was getting such rave reviews.  Perhaps I had come on a bad day.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes.  Anyways, I decided to give it another try because I was craving Ramen and the wait at Monta was ridiculous.  And I am now grateful that Monta was so busy because I am a converted fan.  My husband and in-laws ordered the Beef Ramen with tendons.  The broth was so delicious, the tender beef was plentiful, as was the tendons.  Just a perfect bowl of soup on a cold winter night.  

I had plans to order the Ramen also, but when I saw the ""Special shrimp soup with wontons"" advertised on the wall- I just could not resist.  The broth was just bursting with shrimpyness.  My husband didn't  like it for that exact reason, but I was swooning.  It must have taken a lot of shrimp heads to pack that much flavor into that bowl.  I usually never ever finish my bowls of soup, but I just could not stop eating it.  I was already full, but thought it would be such a shame to let this deliciousness go to waste.  

Thank you Monta for being so crowded because Big Wong has found a new loyal fan in me.  Even my VERY Chinese in-laws who we literally had just picked up from the airport after a long flight from Hong Kong gave it 2 thumbs up.
