44755,2010-09-17,0,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,"Kai is one of my favorite sushi places to eat because the staff is very friendly. Also, the chefs will recommend you the most popular rolls, based on what they sell the most which is very helpful. However, they don't offer a whole lot of rolls to choose from but the rolls they do have are yummy. Kai is one of the sushi places I enjoy eating the rolls, all I can say is I'm not a sushi roll eater I'm just plain Jane sushi eater. 

My family and I (total of 20 people) all had AYCE without any rush. Other restaurants will rush you, since they do time you. But when you have a big group you should be able to take your time since everything doesn't come out all at once. If your not an AYCE fan they have a la cart for a really reasonable price. 

Recommend for Appetizer: 
Green Mussels 
Oyster Shooter 
Baby Tako 

Yummy Rolls that you must try: 
Stacie Roll 
Spicy Shrimp Roll 
Lobster hand roll (sorry not AYCE, but totally worth the $7) 
Vampire Roll 
Island Roll 
Jamie Special 
Japanese Lasagna 

On the sweet side: 
Kona Coffee Mochi",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,0,5,iUT_ijSBKhaLM3NGof1GyA

Unfortunately, this place was empty. But that meant the sushi chef will take his time and cater to us.  Our server was a korean lady, she seemed a little gruff but topped our drinks often. 

Joey, the sushi chef was very nice.  So nice, he gave us tips on other sushi joints he frequents.

It will take you a while to eat here so open up some time and go with a friend you haven't seen in a while (that you like obviously, it's easy to have awkward silences here wondering where that roll you ordered an hour ago has gone.)  

In my stomach: 
surf and turf -- albacore tuna covered in medium rare kobe beef (mmm)
birthday roll -- YUM
spider roll -- NO. LAME. WITHOUT FLAVOR.
beef teriyaki -- Not bad...generic beef available everywhere...but it's good if you're not into sushi.
stacie roll -- came with the combo beef. SUPER GOOD. 

They have mochi ice cream which I love, but they only give you one, which isn't standard anywhere else. But they had red bean which made my mom happy. Not a date place to make a good impression -- this is like -- you have to take someone out because of some stupid meeting, or maybe you just need something decent with friends.",BMEmpeosi4LfwRlAMgtjbg,6,6,3,tE9bTciLO7hyC4TnKQFsQA

 This is our second visit. The first time the food was good and the service was bad, but i am all for second chances.
Second time was an absolute nightmare! When we got there there were only 3 or four other tables there, and we got a few rolls pretty quickly. Then a large party came in and the other tables filled up. The place is not that big. It was over an hour before we got anything. We kept asking our waitress and all she would say is ""sorry sorry"" I asked at least 5 times to get our ticket back to see what we still had coming. It had been so long we forgot what we had left. Other tables were having problems too. We saw one table wait about 20 mins before anyone even took a drink order. Another table walked out after waiting so long to put in their order. I asked for the manager and she told me I sould have asked her. She said she just assumed we were finished since we had been sitting there so long. I told her the tablenext to us had come during our hour plus hiatus from service. And her explanation was well they are kitchen staff, they work here, that's why they got their food first. We negotiated a discount  and she promised to take care of us. Well now it took another 30 min to get our next roll and everything is coming with an attitude. I ask 3 more times for our ticket to see what we have coming and she tells me only a couple more items. I know of 5 we haven't got at this point. I was over waiting for anyone to refill our drinks so i started getiing them myself. I even had to start putting our orders in to the sushi chef, and by now the restauant is almost empty only 4 people left!
Never Never will go back, and I hope you don't either, places that treat their customer so bad should be out of business.",BpV-KsJG8ojaT13JIzG8KA,2,1,1,PrEbWc3g4_IUDuCHkm_xTw

1004222,2011-07-12,0,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,"I actually don't like to get in sushi debates with friends. It usually ends with someone stomping off yelling something about shoving a hand roll in my face. People are VERY protective of ""their"" fave sushi spot. That being said, Kai (or at least its staff) introduced me to the world of sushi and they've never let me down. 

Quick history lesson, Kai used to be a different sushi place entirely, located across from the Galleria. One day on our weekly voyage the owner told us they were closing and moving to Summerlin. We were elated since we lived over that way. A few months later we set out to search for the new location. All we knew was it was on Durango somewhere. Have you ever looked for a random sushi place on Durango? It's like saying, ""I'm at PT's."". Impossible to find. Thankfully the owner called us and let us know their location and they were open! 

The sushi is seriously so fresh and wonderful and they're willing to alter spice level or use soy paper for any of the rolls. They resisted the AYCE deal for a while but I'm glad they caved because it's worth every cent. My faves are the Moon Roll, Dynamite Roll and the Sue Roll. The green mussels are phenom and the baby tako is totally addicting. It's octopus, but don't be scared. 

The service is great and they'll remember you if you go more than once. Their sister location is Sin City Sushi over on Eastern and Serene, same exact food and quality. YUM I'm starving now. :-)",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,0,1,5,NB5BhMbYcby_i1G_85lj3Q

It was a slow night for them, only one person at the sushi bar and one at the tatami tables in the back.  We sat at a table and our waitress brought us some Sapporro and sake which were surprisingly cheap.

We started out with Gyoza and a salmon skin roll which were pretty good.  Then we had a Stacy roll, which the waitress said was their most popular.  It wasn't bad, I just prefer raw stuff.  The Stacy roll is shrimp tempura and cucumber with crab on the outside.  I thought my BF would like it because he doesn't eat raw stuff but he just thought it was so-so. The best part of the meal for me came next which was the Nabeyaki Udon. I was pretty impressed by their udon.  It came with a bunch of tempura, including two pieces of shrimp.  Inside the bowl was mushroom, tofu, onion, egg, chicken, and noodles.  Pretty good I have to say.  We also had the beef curry, which was a bit runny and bland.

Overall, it was an ok place.  On the plus side everything is reasonably priced.  I'll have to ammend my review when I go back to try their raw stuff.",J8el3Irc7EXoiXwpaM463A,1,0,3,GA9RF0MP34Rup9NU1rM5qg

3203630,2011-01-10,30,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,"Throughout my life I have been fascinated by all things Asian. I as a child I saw my first Japanese Spinning Sex Basket. My father brought it home on my 3rd birthday...he had no present for me...unless you call a slap and ""don't ever come in my room again"" a present. Knowing him...I do. Years later he passed out and his Swisher Sweet fell out of his hand and burned down our trailer...for the 5th time.  I cried for the chair that had made it through 4 fires, 8 wives, 9 waitresses named ""Rose"" and a guy in a dress...named ""Rose""...and it was gone. Craftsmanship, luck...and an incredible amount of lubricant has protected it over the years.  My father wept. He cursed God. He flogged himself with the red plastic track for my toy cars.  He ran away...neither me or his badly burned 9th female Rose ever saw him again.  I heard he spent decades trying to replicate the feel of that basket. an obsession that nearly killed him. Rose despite his burns was a good stepmother to me....until...well...that is another story.

Rex remembered...he remembered the squeals of delight...the screams of ecstasy...the snapping of the chain and the cries of help from my father and his companion of the day. He was insastiable...and animal...I was insatiable...and animal. I read everything i could about the Pacific rim...i nicknamed my anus ""The Atlantic Rim""...I was a scholar of all things Asian. I even bought pictures of tigers on black velvet...very Asian.  I had two true Asian loves...Margret Cho and sushi.  Margret left me for some film director...I was crushed...but my search for all things sushi never subsided.  I would go to the finest sushi houses. I would eat canned tuna straight from the can. I was hardcore.

In these times of want and woe....I want roe...as much of it as I can eat.  All you can eat sushi is usually like having a naked dance party in a Weight Watchers...never good...and not good examples of what fun you COULD be having...if you were in a different situation.  Kai Sushi and Steakhouse is like having a naked dance party in the backstage area of the Victoria Secret modeling show.  It is heaven. It is perfection. It is better than Margret Cho in my father's basket. My dream of good all you can eat sushi is realized...great all you can eat sushi for under 25 bucks!!  If this is dreaming...don't wake me up.

I will start out with something not necessarily brought up first when reviewing all you can eat sushi...they have the best mussels in town! Bar none. Amazing. A touch spicy. A touch sweet. The best ever. Their sushi rolls are perfect. Great mix of some sweet, some crunchy, some with acidity, some with a combination.  The best roll...the Lion roll. Second best...the Stacy roll.  Everyone i had, in the many times I have been there, are great. The fish is so fresh, the roll is perfectly built, the sauces are spot on.  It is a miracle they do this for all you can eat.  They even do substitutions!!! I listened to a person ask to have a Stacy roll with cream cheese...and they did it! The salmon roe is excellent and the sashimi is very good as well...because the fish, and i can't say this enough...is so fresh, so tasty, that anything that is made with this kind of care is going to be good. 

The tempura is perfect in the roll, out of the roll...and most importantly...for the soft shell crab. The soft shell crabs are included and they are great...you would think perfect...OH NO...not until you get the Charlie handroll.  The Charlie is the single greatest roll in all of Las Vegas...and the best I have ever had. People who come from NYC, Philly and other major cities have sat in silence with me and ate bite after bite in sheer amazement. The crab is crunchy. The sauce is creamy and spicy. It is the single best thing I have had in my mouth since the time I met Emma Stone. 

Amazing service. Great people. The sushi chef is helpful and funny. The free refills of soda keep coming. The drinks are made strong and good! 

The menu is full and very little isn't included. Much more than most all you can eat sushi joints.

Go. Eat. Think of Asia. Think of Rex. Think of the basket. Be in the basket with Rex...but he won't be with you.",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,24,20,5,CDr7ZakJASHjKhABEsFQiQ

- Garlic tuna sashimi - good and fresh. We got two orders, the cuts of fish in the second order were a lot bigger than the first order. A little consistency would be nice.
- Hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeños and ponzu - delicious
- Garlic tuna roll - yellowtail and avocado were on the inside and the garlic tuna was on top. The roll was soaked in sauce, making the rice mushy. meh...
- Garlic tuna sushi - soaked in sauce. Again, mushy rice...ugh.
- Dragon roll - the eel was delicious.
- Hamachi sushi - two large slices of yellowtail. Rice was firm and sticky, no sauce. Perfect.
- Albacore sushi - the fish was delicious but again a little too much sauce for me.
- Crab - imitation crab. Not my favorite.

Went on a Sunday evening.  Not a lot of people and everyone was sitting at the sushi bar, so that's where we sat.  We tried:

Cucumber Salad
Oyster Shooters (2 orders)
Poncho Roll
Viagra Roll - Really loved this
What the Heck Roll (1/2 order)
Something Wrong Roll  
Crazy Chic Roll (1/2 order)

First, let me say how freaking happy I was to learn you can do half orders.  When I go to a new sushi place, I want to try everything and rank it in comparison with other places.  So this was a super bonus.  

Second, let's talk $$.  Again, while I love Sin City, Kai was much cheaper!  $23.95 for AYCE dinner, $35.95 for all you can eat AND drink and Kai apparently has a happy hour daily from 2 p.m. - 5 p.m.  when AYCE is only $18.95.  The 80 year old grandma inside of me rejoiced!  

I tend to steer clear of AYCE establishments with a time limit, because I'm a slow eater and the idea of being timed stresses me out.  From what I could tell, there's no time limit here.  We were there about 2 hours.

All rolls were good, nothing spectacular about it. It took probably a good 45 minutes for everything to come out.....they would bring one thing out at a time and then we would wait another 15 minutes for something else.

Honestly, their service was a bit slow and bf and I were starving! But of course I have more patience than most people do, so I ordered two at a time. Plus, the sushi chef was also working on a table of six that got there before us (and they were ordering the BIG rolls). I went for my usual nigiri (salmon, yellowtail, halibut, and eel), I would've gone for tuna, tamago, and shrimp but I got full on the ""Stacie"" roll and Shrimp Lovers roll. We also ordered some sides: baked mussels, seaweed salad, skewers, dynamite, edamame--which were all good. Tried quail egg for the first time, which I actually liked lol. They also have some good ""meat"" options like teriyaki chicken and tonkatsu (which comes with rice). Their prices are on the lower end when it comes to AYCE sushi, which is what I like about this place. I wouldn't say they skipped on the quality either. For dessert, they have a good variety of flavors of regular and mochi ice cream. Not to mention they also have an a la carte menu to order from. Overall, not bad! I don't like reviewing places that aren't 5-stars, but I just have to mention that this place's happy hour is such a good deal!",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,1,0,4,tLKMH25W1zuvGPZcj02NOQ
4628198,2011-09-18,0,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,"I love great-tasting and fresh sushi at a steal! This is what this place offers. Make sure you have Anthony as your sushi chef. He is the best! Poor guy practically lives there, he said he works 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even though he works that much, he still makes awesome sushi consistently.

We came across this place when we found out that Naked Fish was closed for renovations. We're very glad we made that accidental discovery!

Their fish is so fresh and buttery, I don't even think I'm eating raw fish. I only started eating raw fish recently, when I discovered how good yellowtail nigiri was at SushiMon. No offense to SushiMon, but this joint made me love eating yellowtail nigiri so much more! Another one I love is the garlic tuna, it is so flavorful and so fresh!

For the price of $23.99 (dinner) and $18.99 (happy hour 2-5 pm), I think this place is so worth checking out. They have really great tasting specialty rolls too, one of them which is the Stacie Roll. Two thumbs up to Anthony for making sushi taste so great.

One more thing, their tamago is probably the freshest tamago I have ever tried anywhere. I could probably go to this place and just order tamago after tamago after tamago, because it is that good! It takes forever to make though, but it is so worth the wait.

The service has been excellent during both times we were there. This place was not crowded both times (I don't get why it isn't, the food is so good!) so the servers and sushi chef are dedicated to you and probably two other groups.

Do check out this place! The location isn't too good, it's on Durango (and there's never any traffic on Durango) and Flamingo, by the Salvation Army. But trust me, it is worth the trip!

By the way, they have $35.99 All you can eat and drink (alcohol) too if you're a heavy drinker.",tXoJxIcIGlEPmcSs_v-Oog,0,0,5,t-D_cMD9mjiiLJezdM0Wiw

This place is my favorite sushi spot in Vegas.  The Quality of food is incredible!  Yung, the owner, will never serve you less than high quality FRESH fish.  You can definitely taste the freshness.  Its kinda like having an epiphany.  (BTW, prices are cheaper than most other sushi restaurants)

Service is superb!  The waiters and sushi chefs really make you feel like you've been a long time customer even if its your first time.  

Every time I eat at another sushi joint I kinda feel guilty and upset that I didn't eat sushi at Kai.  They have definitely raised the bar on cheap, FRESH, good tasting sushi.",3Qml6_MBY3Sf0WMXLiissg,0,0,5,K-meO4X-izUmtcim32bcYQ
4888572,2011-08-27,0,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,The sushi here is good especially the stacy roll! The prices aren't super expensive and it's actually pretty fair compared to other places like Naked Fish. Majority of the time the service is great but when it gets really busy sometimes they only have 1 waitress so it's a bit slow when you need service. Other than that I go to this place often because the rolls are good and the prices are decent.,XBvqoM6BaeAA-zdpB4Vctg,0,0,4,1cBXwjbnCT6FSczDRPcJ1w
5320635,2011-07-15,0,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,"I went here on many occasions because I used to live right across the street from Kai. For a Japanese restaurant located in an almost deserted parking lot, it really blew my mind away the first time I tried its cheap all you can eat menu. Unlike other Japanese restaurants, Kai's AYCE is only about $23.95 and if you wanted to include all you can drink, it is about $35 (which is cheap if you are a heavy drinker and can stomach it all). 
Kai is a large restaurant, however the many times I've gone there.. There is always 1 woman waitress and about 2 people at the sushi bar. It is never crowded and the staff has not changed for a while now. I rather enjoy the seclusion because of its location, and due to the small occupancy, the service is always fast and genuine.  
Their menu is a typical all you can eat sushi menu, however, it is more concentrated on the sushi rolls, than the appetizers. Kai is one of the few places that has Mango rolls, or rolls with mango in them. The combination is amazing and definitely worth a try. They also have the best tuna handrolls. The tuna handrolls are so fresh and spicy, it is definitely one of the best in town. Im a big fan of super white tuna, and so everywhere I go I have to order it. Their super white tuna is very fresh, extremely buttery and the cut is well proportioned. Dont be afraid to ask the sushi chef to accommodate for you, they are very nice and will give you a reasonable amount of fish. Unlike ichiza, which is well known for their more traditional dishes, Kais dishes are more creative and will have rolls that are influenced by different tastes all around. I dont remember the specific name of the rolls but when you look at their menu, you will notice the varieties in their sushi. 
Their signature sushi dish is also very delicious. I believe it was called their Kai roll. 
Overall, if you are looking for a quiet night with friendly services, I would definitely suggest going there. If anything, for the cheap price of an all you can eat sushi experience that will not damage your wallet but leave you full and happy in return.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,0,0,4,3DxDH0vprDqlI7BYBtBvzw

Nevertheless! I recommend the baby tako, kasia roll, vampire roll, and green mussels to name a few! So see for yourself! Enjoy :)",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,1,1,4,N8xKcrh46F0l0ld-5MMWyw

When we got our yellowtail, salmon, & tuna nigiri the rice easily fell apart and didn't taste good. The fish was good though because we ordered their freshest fish. 

My sushi friends weren't very happy with the rice falling apart and whatnot. Me and two other friends had a stomachache during and after.

I mainly liked Dancing Tiger Roll. Stacie Roll was okay.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,0,2,GJF2usFJIUe6V5nDKJKX5w
5959854,2010-12-20,0,LGNvGY5UxlP1GUnv5Uni9Q,"I adored this place even before they offered the AYCE option. This place has some of the freshest sushi in town. If you want the better quality rolls and nigiri, I suggest you don't get the AYCE... but it's delicious and either way. 

They advertise the best green mussels in town and they're right! I stick with the nigiri in this place. You end up getting the best bang for your buck that way. Everything is wonderful and the servers are so nice. It can get busy and slower when they get busy, so I recommend sitting at the bar then.

Ask the chefs/servers what's freshest and just trust their judgment. It's all really good here. They have some awesome specialty rolls too and they're very accommodating if you have special requests. 

Try it, you'll like it.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,2,5,tFzw9sC0o2UQ_CkSQXQGYg
