I do feel a bit sorry for the owner tonight though since it was only her in the restaurant taking care of customers. Service was bad, we didnt get water til almost 10 min after we sit down. I think only one person was doing the cooking so everybody had to wait for their order. Appetizer didn't come until after the main entree was served (happened the last time we went there too, PLS appetizer should go first). I went to the counter to pay and the owner suggested ""the tips is normally 15%"" and even done the math for me, trust me when I say I didn't ask for that (maybe she thought I looked hesitant?), and I think that's just rude.  She punched in the numbers on an adding machine and just stapled that to the ordering form. Oh one more thing, the ""15% tip"" she suggested was based on the total AFTER TAX, not the subtotal (which is what's supposed to be), the difference was just $1 and I paid what she suggested, because I didnt feel like arguing with her in front of all the people. It's a very bad move for your business, very cheap move. 

The food is good, I don't deny that. Just the service needs BIG improvement. I don't think I will ever dine in there again, perhaps I will order food to go.",YRTVIlQL2-LjKog1uobh8w,2,1,2,_Bzn2wjXotr2V2MqcvYc3Q

So when we were asking them to get more food that we ordered, they said I thought you guys already got yours ! It was so ridiculous! And we were hungry and tried .. The other tables got their food slowly too. There is a table of people left because the food was coming slow too. And when we were trying to argue with manager, she told us I am sorry and that's it !! I mean good job .... The most slowest food I never ever get in my life .. I never come to this restaurant again !!!",XUPxU-fPN15FnirDCAIaDg,0,0,1,tHPkdHAykVF5YH3uwKJesA

I think the owner's friends and families sat next to us. They were talking very loud while we were there. It is very bothering us! Violated our enjoyment.However, nobody seems to care. I hope you can find a better comforter place to dine. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",r380U51OPjHRFbm7fXHmiw,2,0,1,Q-KHNPmtRJO2hOsucKcH_g
2919502,2015-12-18,0,ei7S4WnSWzu18XwE8PDOtg,"Listen to me on this. Trust me on this. Do NOT come here. DO NOT COME TO THIS RESTAURANT.

Here's a few reasons:

Reason 1... Customer server is complete and utter trash. My family of 3 and I did not received our menus until 15 minutes in. We were not asked the first question that every waiter/tress should ask ""what would you like to drink?"" until 15 minutes in.  When we did order hot water, it took another 15 minutes for that to come out. 30 minutes wasted. 

Reason 2... The time it takes them to cook their food, I could drive down to SoCal, have dinner, drive back to Vegas, come back to their restaurant and it STILL WON'T BE READY. We waited ANOTHER 15 minutes and the appetizer of 
""cold potato salad"" was nowhere to be seen. Not even going to ask about our entrees. 

Reason 3... You don't need any more reasons. Don't. 

OH' and the menu is in Chinese only. So if you can't read it, don't go to this restaurant. 
All in all, DO. NOT. COME. TO. THIS. RESTAURANT.",Ddnx_5hrDPZlB5bvYOJgbQ,2,1,1,rnSO1ZMavPk0PQJLXUdTjw

There are other people too in the restaurant at the same time. Not only me, every one else was mad too. They are so rude. and the receipt was not unclear. they just gave me a total without itemize the item. and ask me 20% tips right in front my face when they gave me the bill. that wasn't cool. I am sure I and other people that day won't go back there again.",9pxZt-TyQsx4HL49j-fZUg,1,0,1,D0335VHifpHvHEy0XoSvMA
