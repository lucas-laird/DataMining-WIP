Tonight a lady decided to interrupt a conversation I was having with my brother and the bartender decided to take her side and kick us out.this is after I paid my tab and left the bartenders a above average tip.he told us that he was kicking us out because she was a local, you dumb bastard I'm a local also but you decided to kick me out with my family and I hope you burn in hell and your mother also. I should have known not to go into the bar because there was a Donald Trump rally in front of the bar, me being the patriot that I am said fuck it. If you want to be treated like dog shit I suggest you go to Luckys lounge on Farm Road.",g91eg7UTLGdK96SiPMpTRg,3,1,1,QLa0H-mQZZnbRXiMkGCAaQ

The dining room is separated from the bar...in a completely walled off room, but you wouldn't have known it from the smell.  Absolutely disgusting smell of stale smoke everywhere.  We turned and left and won't be back.  Too bad...a few years back this was an o.k. place, but a liberal smoking policy has turned it into a toilet.",ZdUFyF5eNyZxete-T4bmZA,1,0,1,MgYbfg38yAqaZuYIY0kbGA

No ""hi, hello, how are you?"" -nothing. Not even a smile! Anyway, afterwards she kept coming back, insisting i put $10 more in the machine to make $20 while my bf had put in even more than so, after we both bought drinks (& I really didnt want to gamble, however my man had other ideas and gave me a 10bto anyway, but w/e!).. Idk... She just wasnt nice/kind/friendly/inviting whatsoever while she treated this other crowd 110% percent better who was sitting next to us.
  On top of that , once we started playing pool and got more drinks, my soon-to-be told me she'd pocketed yet another $10 on top of the 10 he'd already given her for a tip in the mean time! What a shame she to go and screw something good (that could have been for both of our while)!ยก",lAD-OcvibNqietvZiIbYaw,0,0,1,2kuhUIKSMEpskmD1stmhiQ

-VERY smokey, you will leave smelling like an ash tray 
-inattentive and unfriendly service. bartender is more interested in flirting with girls than serving beverages

The bar was smokey and definitely had a ""local or out"" feel to it, well considering myself a local, just not to this crowd, I decided to sit down and and enjoy a blue moon, after my first sip I knew something was wrong with my drink, it had a sour vanilla ""ish"" taste to it, don't know if the key was bad, the glass, was bad, the orange was bad, or if our server had vanilla lotion on and it got on the orange. The bar was quaint and small, and all the seats were packed. The locals were yucking it up and so it seemed everyone knew someone here, which is a plus once your are known.

We literally call it ""Stinkies"" rather than ""Lucky's"" because it's so full of smoke. They are very typically slow to serve, cranky, tonight were just plain rude because we are not ""regulars."" Not to mention, I tried to play a slot machine that had a sign on it ""reserved for slot players,"" well, I'm a slot player, right? I was told I couldn't play it, because it was reserved for a specific customer, and if he came in, the machine needed to be available.

The other Jill C's review lured me in with the description of this being a local Cheers bar. It is most definitely that! I think I was the only one new to the place. Not long after sitting down I was greeted by the overtly friendly bartender Kelly. After playing for a little over an hour (and winning) I left for home.

This is the first time we've ever been here and we really enjoyed our time last night. Despite the smell of smoke, which is something most people should be used to since basically everywhere in Las Vegas is a smoking zone. The bartender, Johnathan, was extremely nice. I told him to surprise me with a drink and I'm not sure what it was but the drink was great. We talked to a few regulars that come to this bar and they were great to entertain us with their conversations. And the HAPPY HOUR is great! They have a few different times that they have happy hour in the day, we had no idea we were there during happy hour 12am-2am and when we closed out on the tab we were expecting a lot more and we were ecstatic to find this out. There is also pool tables, darts, and an electric jukebox where you can request your own music.

Lucky's is just what I expected- a smoky tavern where everyone seemed to know each other. And by smoky, I mean ridiculous. The place has a retro feel to it, and I liked the old school chairs, which were pretty comfortable. There isn't much seating other than at the bar, and pool tables take up the rest of the space.

I joined the slot club to get the new member bonus of $10 free play. 
The bartender got my whiskey and ginger so fast, she must have made me when I walked in!  When my fellow ugly sweater contestant arrived, we found a table away from the bar to await the contest. They had a buffet set up for the party, and we enjoyed some Italian food before the festivities began. Other than pool tables, they have a free throw basketball game and I believe a few video games. 

The trees and other holiday decorations were nice and added to the atmosphere. We had a good enough time, and the contest was fun. I was impressed with the prizes for the winners, and the gift basket my friend got (with a bottle of booze) for second place was great. I even got a consolation prize stocking which had $25 free play! Awesome.",Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,5,4,3,uPYMuxvmwrFRSESxuVmEOg

Once we came in and sat down the bartender looked and asked what we wanted, we didn't know yet so he walked away. 
Here is why this place has a one star review and will never have my service. 
A woman walked up to me and my boyfriend right when we got there and asked us how we were doing. We were weirded out by this random woman who had dead eyes and looked like she was strung out on heroin so we weren't very responsive and she walked away. Then a minute later came back to me and said ""so did you come with anyone?"" And I pointed to my boyfriend and said ""yes, him"". Then she goes ""I'm with these two guys and they're taken by you"" (insert old guy and creepy younger guy here) and I said ""Oh well no sorry"" and she said ""they're interested in doing a porno movie with you"" and my jaw literally dropped and I just said no. She goes ""maybe next time"" and gives a creepy smile and walks away. 
If these are the patrons that frequent this bar and make another guest feel incredibly uncomfortable I'm shocked they are still in service. We left immediately after this happening.",oT4-j7Kht8P-8EfE9FZCKw,7,2,1,cVNdhZSAy-XaZC312KQOgg
