They had a triple play deal for $8.99 where you can choose a pasta, a salad, and either chicken parmigiana or sausage with peppers (there might have been another entree option).  I chose the baked ziti as the pasta and found it delicious.  I also chose the chicken parmigiana.  The girl cashier was very nice and the portion was very good. It also came with bread.   I was pleased and full by the time I was finished.  I would eat there again.  I walked around to see what nearby eateries were charging and was glad I went with this place.",_3pE1FZT2L_-vfRGnnnP6w,0,0,4,YTbLvq1OpmHFT3Vx9r1ZKg
1582673,2017-02-14,0,zQp4fij2fBaZawyO_ymIEg,Worse service...worker got mad at me when she thought I ordered something else and gave all kinds of attitude.  Customer service matters a lot and this place is lacking (well at least the one employee).  I asked for managements number and when I called they said manager wasn't there and to call back.  Unbelievable. Not good for the airport to leave customers with this type of service,hfX6Hl0Fi6hahpR0s0ohLg,0,0,1,6Wmn4GsdG8qBUBFm1rvMJw

When my turn came up in line, the woman at the register ignored me and  walked away, just to wander around doing nothing. After a minute, she looked at me from across the room and yelled out to me to give her my order. All I wanted was a salad with no cheese, but she told me to go a few gates down to get that, because their salads were pre-made, even though I could see them in the back making salads.

Clearly they did not want my business so they won't get it.",H21gSGFp--EXy2hL4lushA,1,0,1,YWhojso0KE4EhFkUOlj7Mw

They a multitude of other italian/pasta dishes that I didn't get to try out, but I can certainly vouch for their pizza! They are located next to C24 in the Southwest terminal in a mini food court with the popeyes and Wendy's. Some place to sit, but not a whole lot.",X_DkwPTzdO_VWzUcbUXREg,0,0,4,zvjV9Jl7bx-ue1VPa2kwJA

They were out of the chicken panini--even though they had one on display, and there was also food in a steam table (noodles, meatballs, sauce, and mac n'cheese) that wasn't on the menu--which I found strange.
